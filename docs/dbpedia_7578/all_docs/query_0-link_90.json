        "text": "Codes of ethics establish basic principles by which public servants must abide, such as integrity, selflessness and openness. A code of conduct draws on the code of ethics to formulate standards and practices that should be applied to the particular circumstances of an institution.\n\nA code of conduct sets out specific standards of professional behaviour expected in a host of situations and provides public officials with guidance for handling them. In addition, codes of conduct bring transparency and public accountability into governmental operations.\n\nInternational standards\n\nWell-designed codes of ethics and codes of conduct will help meet the growing expectations from the public, business leaders and civil society for greater transparency and integrity in government, and will places an onus on governments to ensure high ethical standards amongst public officials and elected representatives. As such, they can support the development of trust between the public and government institutions and officials. It is important that codes of conduct are in place for both civil servants and elected officials, and that training and guidance is provided to ensure a full understanding of the codes by all office-holders. Disciplinary measures and sanctions should be clearly stipulated and consistently applied in the event of noncompliance with the codes.\n\nThe following international conventions and standards relate to codes of ethics and professional conduct:\n\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe’s Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials and the European Code of Conduct for all Persons Involved in Local and Regional Governance are the reference texts for local and regional authorities in Europe for ensuring political integrity.\n\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe’s Guidelines on Public Ethics consolidate in one single document Council of Europe core principles, standards and recommendations in this field, covering all categories of public officials, be they elected, appointed or employed. They are complemented by the Guide on Public Ethics: Practical steps to implementing public ethics in public organisations, a living document which provides case studies and examples from Council of Europe member states.\n\nThe OECD Recommendation on Public Integrity shifts the focus from ad hoc integrity policies to a context-dependent, behavioural, risk-based approach with an emphasis on cultivating a culture of integrity across the whole of society.\n\nThe Transparency International paper on Implementing Effective Ethics Standards in Government and the Civil Service provides practical mechanisms for institutionalising high standards of ethical integrity for elected officials and civil servants.\n\nDomestic context\n\nThe development of the public ethics system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is primarily related to public administration reform projects and the support of various international donors to the development of administration in BiH. Taking into account the very complex constitutional and administrative structure, a number of laws and bylaws are in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina that regulate the obligations of competent (local, cantonal, entity, state) bodies to adopt codes of ethics and codes of conduct for elected officials and civil servants. This especially relates to local authorities, which follow the entity or cantonal governments' regulations, which are fragmented and uneven. From 2018, the Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina includes ethical behaviour in building public bodies' broader concept of building integrity. The lack of a code of ethics or ignorance of its content from the side of elected officials or civil servants is one of the systemic risk indicators that can lead to the development of corrupt behaviour, ethical and professionally unacceptable procedures and other irregularities in the work of public administration bodies. Although codes of ethics and codes of conduct in public institutions have been adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, more attention needs to be given to their role and implementation.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe legal framework for the adoption of codes of ethics and codes of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be observed in relation to the level of government at which the regulation is adopted and whether it is intended for civil servants or elected officials.\n\nThe provisions of all applicable laws on civil service in BiH state-level institutions, the Federation of BiH, Republika Srpska, Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina and cantons prescribe the obligation of the competent Civil Service Agencies to develop a code of conduct for civil servants adopted by the competent governments.\n\nFor elected officials at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, the Federation of BiH and the cantons, the drafting of codes of ethics or codes of conduct is prescribed by the Rules of Procedure of the competent legislative bodies, assemblies, or parliaments.\n\nIt should be noted that all executive and legislative power levels have adopted codes of ethics or codes of conduct for civil servants or elected officials. In addition, ethics commissions or committees have been set up within the legislature to report the unethical conduct of elected officials according to the rules of procedure.\n\nWhen it comes to the legal framework for local authorities, Article 39, paragraph 2, item 27 of the Law on Local Self-Government of the Republika Srpska stipulates that the Assembly of the local self-government (municipality or city) is responsible for adopting codes of ethics for elected officials.\n\nIn Republika Srpska, a special Law on Civil Servants and State Employees in Local Self-Government Units has been adopted. Article 33 of this Law stipulates that an official is obliged to act in accordance with the law and the Code of Conduct issued by the Minister of Administration and Local Self-Government of Republika Srpska.\n\nThe Law on Principles of Local Self-Government has been in force in the Federation of BiH since 2006, but it does not explicitly prescribe the obligation to adopt a code of ethics or a code of conduct for elected officials. This is a framework law defining the principles under which cantonal levels of government should harmonize existing cantonal laws on local self-government enacted before 2006 or enact new ones to be harmonised with the federal law. The current laws on local self-government of the Federation of BiH do not prescribe the obligation to adopt a code of ethics or code of conduct. The practice is varied, given that a large number of local governments follow standards in this area and have adopted codes of ethics or codes of conduct for elected officials, which have been adopted based on strategic documents, statutes and other bylaws of local self-government units.\n\nThe provisions of Article 17, paragraph 7, of the Law on Civil Service in the Federation of BiH, which prescribes the adoption of the Code of Ethics, and cantonal laws on civil service apply to civil servants in the bodies of local self-government units. Out of a total of 10 cantons in BiH, seven cantons have adopted civil service laws. Some cantonal laws prescribe the adoption of cantonal codes of ethics, and some require the application of the Code of Ethics for civil servants in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Strategy 2015-2019 of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the accompanying Action Plan recognize the strengthening of ethics and integrity in public administration as one of the key preventive mechanisms in the fight against corruption.\n\nBack in 2015, Transparency International Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the financial support of the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, developed the Manual: Introduction of Integrity Plans at the Local Level to design effective methods for creating ethical and professional quality of work in public institutions.\n\nThrough their strategic plans for the fight against corruption, all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina have recognised the importance of improving ethical behaviour and strengthening integrity. For example, the Tuzla Canton Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2021-2024 envisages the introduction of programme plans to strengthen ethics and integrity in primary, secondary, and higher education.\n\nIn 2018, the Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina developed the Manual: Rules for Development of Integrity Plans in BiH Institutions with the aim of providing guidance to institutions at all levels of government on how to approach the development of internal plans to prevent corruption, unethical behaviour and strengthen integrity of public institutions.\n\nGood practices\n\nThe Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in cooperation with relevant institutions and international donors, regularly organises training and capacity building activities in the field of integrity, conflict of interest, ethics, and the fight against corruption for public institutions and the private sector.\n\nThe Civil Service Agencies of state-level Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH include training in integrity, corruption prevention, and application of codes of ethics within the annual training programs. Every year, the Civil Service Agency of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina prepares special training programs for local self-governments, within which training in the field of application of codes of ethics and integrity are provided.\n\nAs already pointed out, local self-governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina have adopted codes of ethics and an institutional framework for their implementation. For example, the City of Trebinje has adopted and published on its website the Code of Conduct for Elected Representatives in the Administrative Service and the Assembly of the City of Trebinje. For that purpose, the Ethics Commission of Honour was formed, whose task is to monitor and analyse the Code of Conduct of Elected Officials. The Commission has drafted and published the Rules of Procedure of the Ethics Commission of Honour , which regulate the competencies and composition of the commission, procedures before the Commission, execution of measures and recording of the deletion (expiration) of measures. The Commission consists of seven members and the sessions of the Commission are public.\n\nIn June 2021, the Stari Grad Sarajevo Municipal Council adopted by a majority vote the Conclusion of the Ethics Commission by which Mr Damir Saračević, Vice-Chairman of the Stari Grad Municipal Council, was sanctioned for violating the provisions of Article 11 of the Code of Ethics for elected officials in the Municipality of Stari Grad Sarajevo. Namely, the report against Mr Saračević was filed to the Ethics Commission by Ms Adela Plakalo, Assistant Mayor, for a verbal attack, intimidation, violent behaviour, insulting human dignity, abuse of authority and violation of the provisions of the Code of Ethics. The Ethics Commission confirmed that Mr Saračević violated the Code of Ethics and proposed the monetary sanction by which Mr Saračević’s monthly lump sum was reduced by 50 %. On this occasion, Mr Mirza Balatović, the Chairman of the Municipal Council of Stari Grad, stated, “the sanction imposed today should indicate to all councillors that any violation of the Code of Ethics shall not be tolerated, just as a violation of anyone’s rights or provoking any conflict and violation of the culture of dialogue.”\n\nComplaints mechanisms allow citizens to provide feedback to public authorities on the standards of services they receive. They provide an important accountability mechanism which allows civil servants and elected officials to identify where public services are being delivered ineffectively, inefficiently or inequitably. When such mechanisms result in the prompt and effective handling of complaints , they can help to create the conditions for increased trust of citizens in government administration.\n\nInternational standards\n\nTo ensure confidence in the mechanisms, local authorities should endeavour to consider and resolve each complaint promptly and comprehensively. Complaints mechanisms can be made more accessible by applying a one-stop-shop approach so that citizens do not need to search among different offices and websites.\n\nIf government takes a proactive approach to pre-empt the repeat of similar causes for complaint, complaints mechanisms can also help governments to identify new approaches to service delivery and to increase citizen participation. To this end, complaints mechanisms should be combined with periodic evaluations of service delivery, including the use of public opinion surveys, and exchange of experience and tools with other local authorities to encourage wider adoption of good practice and tried and tested tools.\n\nThere are no specific international standards for complaints mechanisms relating to public services. However, mechanisms and procedures for responding to complaints are incorporated into an international legal guarantee to the right to participate in the affairs of a local authority, and there are a number of helpful civil society guidelines and handbooks. See for example:\n\nThe Additional Protocol to the European Charter of Local Self-Government on the right to participate in the affairs of a local authority (CETS No. 207) provides an international legal guarantee to this right, including the establishment of mechanisms and procedures for dealing with and responding to citizen complaints and suggestions.\n\nTransparency International’s Complaints Mechanisms: Reference Guide for Good Practice sets out guiding principles and good practices for establishing and implementing complaint mechanisms that provide safe channels for citizens to alert a public or private institution about any corruption risks or incidences.\n\nThe Danish Refugee Council’s Complaints Mechanism Handbook describes how to set up and manage a complaints mechanism.\n\nWorld Vision’s Overview of NGO-Community Complaints Mechanisms, with an overview of mechanisms and tools used by development agencies to receive complaints.\n\nDomestic context\n\nComplaints mechanisms about the work of administrative bodies belong to the segment of service delivery, that is they form a significant pillar of the reform area related to the creation of a citizen-oriented administration. Through SIGMA/OECD1 reports and European Commission reports for Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is continuously pointed out that public administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inefficient and that the legal framework for citizen-oriented administration differs significantly from one level of government to another. In general, the perception of citizens about public services, namely services provided by public administration bodies, is very low.\n\nAlthough it is stated that the territorial and administrative structure significantly affects the differences in administrative procedures, not only between the entities and the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but even between individual cantons in the case of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, citizens' trust in local government is growing.\n\nAccording to the findings of the TI BiH Perception of Public Administration, in 2014 30.4% of citizens stated they mostly have trust in local administration, compared to 2017 when this percentage was 42.3%. Asked if they have complained about the work of public administration officials, in 2014 11% of surveyed citizens replied that they complained orally to the superior of the public administration official, while in 2017 8.9% of surveyed citizens provided this answer. In 2014, 2.5% of surveyed citizens complained in written form, while in 2017 this percentage was 1.4%.\n\n1. SIGMA (Support for Improvement in Governance and Management) is a joint initiative of the OECD and the European Union. Its key objective is to strengthen the foundations for improved public governance, and hence support socio-economic development through building the capacities of the public sector, enhancing horizontal governance and improving the design and implementation of public administration reforms, including proper prioritisation, sequencing and budgeting. We have been working with our partners on strengthening their public governance systems and public administration capacities since 1992.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe mechanism of citizens' complaints about the work of administrative bodies in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be viewed from different levels of government that communicate with citizens in the performance of their constitutionally and legally defined competencies. Thus, the mechanism of citizens' complaints about the work of the state, entities and Brčko District bodies is regulated by the current laws on administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska and Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These laws prescribe the obligation of administrative bodies to enable all natural and legal persons to submit petitions and complaints about the work of administrative bodies and the improper attitude of employees in those bodies when citizens turn to them to exercise their rights and interests, or fulfil their civil obligations.\n\nWhen it comes to the mechanism of citizens' complaints about the work of local authorities, it is guaranteed by Article 46 of the Law on Principles of Local Self-Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Article 117 of the Law on Republic Administration of the Republika Srpska.\n\nThe state-level administration law and the law of the Federation of BiH each define sanctions for the responsible person in the administrative body and administrative organisation if (s)he does not act upon petitions or complaints of citizens (Article 104 BiH Law on administration prescribes sanctions as fines ranging from BAM 150 to BAM 500; Article 150 of the Federal Law on Administration prescribes sanctions as fines ranging from BAM 300 to BAM 2000). In contrast, the laws of the Republika Srpska and Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina do not prescribe any sanctions. Based on the above-mentioned laws on administration and laws on local self-government, local governments issue rulebooks, instructions, guidelines, and other similar acts that regulate in detail the procedures for citizens' complaints about the work of local government institutions.\n\nGuidelines\n\nAs previously mentioned, there is no centralised approach to the system of citizens 'complaints about the work of administrative bodies and their employees. Each local government regulates the system independently, adopting, based on the previously mentioned laws, its procedures, guidelines, and instructions for citizens' complaints. Some local governments publish their guides on their websites along with a “form” for citizen complaints. Thus, for example, the Municipality of Ugljevik has published Instructions for submitting and resolving citizens' complaints on its website. The City of Bijeljina published Instructions for submitting and resolving complaints on its website, together with the form for submitting complaints. The Municipality of Tomislavgrad and other cities and municipalities have done likewise.\n\nGood practices\n\nAn excellent example of digitalisation of complaint and grievance procedures and general communication of citizens with local government is the mobile application eCitizen, developed for 18 local governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the Municipal Environmental and Economic Management Project (MEG) funded by the Government of Switzerland and implemented by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). In this way, citizens can send an inquiry or complaint to the local government in just five steps and receive a response from the administration within 48 hours. In addition, through the eCitizen application, citizens can be informed about unforeseen disruptions and emergencies, such as service interruptions and service information. The application is adapted for Android and iOS devices and is also available as an online platform www.ecitizen.ba, which will soon activate modules for communication between citizens and councillors, a module for public hearings, a module for preparing council sessions/assemblies, and the like.\n\nGrievance redress mechanisms (GRMs) are tools that go beyond complaints mechanisms and other feedback channels as citizens can use a GRM to address government institutions and local municipalities with concerns about the impact of policies and their implementation on the citizens themselves. When the policy of a public agency affects the interests of the citizens, or the decision made by the central or local governmental bodies causes a grievance on the part of the citizens, interested parties can use the redress system created by the government agencies and local municipal bodies to present their grievance. A grievance redress mechanism is not used to replace the court or audit system or formal investigation; nor is it the appropriate mechanism for grievance about potentially criminal acts, such as instances of corruption. GRMs are designed for collaborative solutions of grievances.\n\nInternational standards\n\nRedress mechanisms serve as a frontline service to be used by citizens to effectively resolve complaints and/or grievances. Furthermore, business organisations can use GRMs to mitigate risks to their business operations and GRMs can become a prompt and effective mechanism for dispute settlement short of legal action.\n\nEffective redress mechanisms can serve to identify patterns of corruption and malpractice, and to forge corruption prevention policies. To ensure greater access, it is important to raise public awareness about GRMs and to provide free advice to citizens on the formulation of grievance claims and how to proceed when seeking redress.\n\nStandards for grievance redress mechanisms are mostly set by international organisations such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and European Commission. These standards are mostly connected with setting the legal framework for the protection of citizens’ rights. These standards are presented in the following guidelines:\n\nReliability of Public Services: Ensuring Citizens’ Rights from the OECD addresses citizens’ rights to be heard using the legal framework established by state institutions.\n\nOECD, Recommendation of the Council on Public Service Leadership and Capability, OECD/LEGAL/0445 – the recommendation has 14 principles and defines the responsiveness of public service.\n\nHow to make a complaint at EU level by European Commission is a pamphlet outlining the opportunity for citizens to contact and submit a complaint to the European Commission.\n\nGuidance developed by the international institutions on the protection of citizens’ rights during the implementation of a business project includes the ADB‘s Building Capacity for Grievance Redress Mechanisms.\n\nDomestic context\n\nThe grievance redress mechanism falls under the concept of institutional accountability. The organisation of public administration has a significant impact on its general functioning and its democratic legitimacy in terms of citizens' expectations. The responsibility of public administration implies, in fact, several segments within which administrative bodies must act to perform their functions efficiently and adequately (rationality, transparency, accountability, accessibility). Responsible institutions should provide citizens with a fair resolution in cases of wrongdoing or illegal actions. This is one of the five SIGMA principles within the area of liability. It implies that public bodies take responsibility in cases of violations and guarantee redress and/or appropriate compensation. This institute is partially regulated by law in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and even less is known in practice.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe Yugoslav Law on Obligations of 1978, adopted by Bosnia and Herzegovina, the entity levels of government and the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and ultimately applied by local levels of government, is the most comprehensive legal framework for public accountability, regulating in detail the principles of liability and redress procedures. In the context of the right to seek compensation for damages caused by illegal actions or omissions of administrative bodies, Article 172 of the Law on Obligations is relevant, which, however regulates \"only\" the liability of legal entities for damage caused by its bodies. This article does not explicitly refer to the responsibility of public bodies. It does not explicitly state the responsibility of public administration bodies for adopting public policies and regulations that harm citizens or liability for violating regulations. However, its application includes liability for detriment caused by actions or omissions of administrative bodies and private bodies performing public functions.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Law on Administration and the Law on Republic Administration of the Republika Srpska established the general principle of liability of administrative bodies for damages caused to a natural or legal person by their illegal actions.\n\nThe Strategic Framework for Public Administration Reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period 2018-2022 envisages the measure entitled \"Improve the mechanism for protection of the right of individuals to good governance and public interest\". It means ensuring functional internal and external mechanisms for protecting this right, including providing consistent and fair handling of administrative disputes guaranteed through administrative appeals and judicial control, as well as improvement of procedures and mechanisms for public bodies to take responsibility in cases of violations of regulations with redress and/or adequate compensation. The accompanying Action Plan for Public Administration Reform envisages a number of steps to implement the Strategic Framework measure in question.\n\nGuidelines\n\nA well organised and functional public administration is a key precondition for transparent and effective democratic governance. Good public administration is the foundation of the functioning of the state because it is the administration that determines the ability of the governments to implement key reform processes and provide quality services to citizens. The criteria for the accession of countries to the European Union (EU), including Bosnia and Herzegovina's aspirations for membership, emphasize the need to create and have strong public administrations that will have the capacity to follow the principles of good public administration. SIGMA Principles of public administration are the result of the European Commission's focus on reforming the public administrations of countries aspiring to membership in the EU.\n\nThe SIGMA principles cover six key areas, including the area of “Responsibility”. The basic requirement of this area implies the existence of appropriate mechanisms that will ensure the accountability of public administration bodies, including transparency of action.\n\nThe latter implies that:\n\n1. the legislation contains a requirement to correct or compensate the damage to individuals who suffer damage from illegal actions of public bodies,\n\n2. the regulation on public responsibility is coherent, complete, logically structured, formulated in a simple and clear manner, and easily accessible,\n\n3. the scope of public accountability is wide and includes the exercise of powers by the public and the performance of other public duties, regardless of who performs them (a public body or a private person performing public duties),\n\n4. the rules concerning time limits and the burden of proof do not jeopardize the effective exercise of the right to bring an action for damages.\n\nOne of the key recommendations of SIGMA in the 2017 Report for Bosnia and Herzegovina is to simplify and clarify the official typologies of administrative bodies at all levels of government. It is crucial to ensure that all bodies subordinate to the government are subject to a single and comprehensive accountability scheme in the context of planning, reporting and monitoring. Given that the legal framework for public accountability exists, but there is no information on its practical application, one of the recommendations is that governments at all levels establish mechanisms to monitor court cases that result in increased government accountability to improve administrative procedures and decisions and reduce the risk of cases of public liability in the future.\n\nGood practices\n\nThe issue of stray dogs is a long-standing issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the Law on the Protection and Welfare of Animals was adopted in 2009, to date no conditions have been created for the proper implementation of the law. Hygiene services have not been established (or exist in rare cases), nor have shelters for abandoned animals been introduced, and the competencies and obligations of the cantons, cities and municipalities related to animal shelters, hygiene services and financing are not delimited and precisely defined. All the above further complicates the implementation of this law.\n\nHowever, there are cases in which citizens are de facto provided with the right to compensation due to inadequate implementation of regulations, namely the competence of local authorities in the obligation to take care of stray dogs. Some local authorities have enacted regulations that allow the payment of compensation for damage caused by an attack or bite by a stray dog. For example, in 2019, the Board of Directors of Public Company “Komunalno Brčko” adopted the Rulebook on the Procedure and Manner of Resolving Citizens' Requests for Compensation for Damage Caused by Stray Dogs. This is non-pecuniary damage caused by stray dogs to natural persons – citizens in the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina – while material damage on this basis is still being resolved through the Basic Court of Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. If such a case occurs, the injured citizen can initiate a procedure for compensation of damage caused to Public Entity \"Komunalno Brčko\" by submitting a request with basic data, supported by appropriate documentation (police, medical, veterinary inspections, bank account number). The commission decides on the claim for damages within 15 days. If the commission concludes that the claim for damages is founded, the injured party will agree on one-time compensation, without going to court.\n\nIn this way, the procedure for payment of damages to injured persons, who suffered dog bites, was shortened because they no longer have to seek justice in court so that both parties save on legal and/or court costs and claims are resolved in record time. In 2019, there were six such requests, all of which were accepted and resolved in favour of the injured citizens.\n\nCorruption and other actions harmful to the public interest, including to public health, are more prevalent in organisations that lack a culture of transparency and oversight. A whistle-blower is a person who exposes information on illegal or unethical activities in a private or public organisation, and the rights of a whistle-blower who discloses wrongdoing, or acts and omissions harmful to the public interest, should be protected under “whistle-blowing” laws. Although usually an employee, the whistle-blower could also be a sub-contractor, supplier, unpaid trainee or volunteer. The protection of whistle-blowers is important also in the private sector, not least where they might uncover bribery to public officials or practices damaging to the environment or public health and safety.\n\nInternational standards\n\nMost whistle-blowers raise their concerns internally or with regulatory or law enforcement authorities rather than blowing the whistle in public. The protection of whistle-blowers, and an organisational culture that prioritises transparency and dialogue, serves to promote accountability, builds confidence in the integrity of government, and encourages the reporting of misconduct and corruption. Whistle-blower protection can motivate employees to report wrongdoing without fear of reprisals, and fosters transparency and trust within an organisation as well as outwards to citizens that ethics are upheld and misconduct detected and remedied.\n\nThe rights of whistle-blowers can be strengthened by stipulating clear processes and providing secure confidential channels for disclosure. Explicit remedies, including penalties, to redress reprisals against whistle-blowers should be introduced and consistently applied. Training of human resources staff in local government and government agencies needs to be complemented by awareness-raising among the public so that citizens and government employees alike understand the positive results from whistle-blowing in terms of sustained value for money, trust in public authorities, and quality of services.\n\nThe following international conventions and standards relate to the protection of whistle-blowers:\n\nCreating comprehensive and effective mechanisms to protect those who disseminate information in the public interest is a recommendation of both the United Nations and the Council of Europe, as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s resolution and recommendation on The protection of whistle-blowers Challenges and opportunities for local and regional government call on ”local and regional authorities to establish and disseminate a whistleblowing policy, with appropriate internal and anonymous reporting channels and to ensure that independent designated institutions exist to oversee and process the disclosure of information.”\n\nThe United Nations Convention against Corruption is the only legally binding universal anti-corruption instrument.\n\nIt is supported by the Technical Guide to the Convention.\n\nThe EU Directive on the Protection of Persons who Report Breaches of Union Law requires EU governments to meet minimum standards for establishing reporting channels and ensuring legal protection for whistle-blowers.\n\nThe Council of Europe’s Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS No. 173) aims to co-ordinate criminalisation of corrupt practices and to improve international co-operation in the prosecution of offences.\n\nThe Council of Europe’s Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS No. 174) defines common international rules for effective remedies for persons affected by corruption.\n\nDomestic context\n\nBack in 2019, the European Commission published the Opinion on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for membership of the European Union, which identified 14 key priorities that Bosnia and Herzegovina must meet in order to open membership negotiations and gain candidate status. The opinion emphasizes in particular that corruption is widespread and that the strategic policy framework and the institutional and legal framework for the fight against corruption are fragmented and show significant shortcomings. In this regard, one of the key priorities within the \"rule of law\" area that BiH must meet is the adoption and implementation of regulations on conflicts of interest and the protection of whistle-blowers.\n\nThis was confirmed in the independent report of experts on the rule of law in BiH (\"Priebe's report\") from 2019, where it was emphasized that the criminal justice system in BiH does not fight corruption. Although there are preventive institutional mechanisms in BiH to fight corruption, their role is minimal. The Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the umbrella institution for adopting and implementing key policies in the fight against corruption. However, the role of the Agency is very limited. Priebe's report states that the Agency failed to impose itself as a central institution in the fight against corruption, including in the field of whistle-blower protection, where whistle-blower protection is cited as a key mechanism in the fight against corruption.\n\nThe field of whistle-blower protection in BiH is fragmented and limited – in both the legal and institutional framework. Currently, there are three laws in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina related to the protection of whistle-blowers – in the Republika Srpska, in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (state level), and in the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. When it comes to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the past few years, there have been several attempts to adopt a law, but it has not passed the necessary parliamentary procedure. The drafting of the new Law on the Protection of Whistle-Blowers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently underway. Its drafting is planned by the Work Programme of the Federal Ministry of Justice in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe Law on Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina Institutions, which entered into force in January 2014, regulates the status of persons reporting corruption only in state-level institutions and legal entities established by Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions. It regulates the reporting procedure, obligations of institutions regarding reporting corruption, protection procedure and sanctions for violations of the provisions of this law. Therefore, this law applies only to whistle-blowers within the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which represents a relatively “small number” of potential whistle-blowers and it is not applicable to other levels of government (and thus not to local levels of government).\n\nThe Law on Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption of the Republika Srpska, adopted in 2017, regulates the protection of persons reporting corruption, the procedure for reporting corruption, the obligations of the responsible person and competent authorities regarding the reporting and protection of persons reporting corruption, and other issues important for persons who report corruption. Unlike the state law, the Law on Protection of Whistle-Blowers of the Republika Srpska prescribes protection for all natural and legal persons who report corruption in the public or private sector in the Republika Srpska, as well as local authorities in the Republika Srpska.\n\nThe Law on Protection of Whistle-Blowers of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in 2018 and is very similar to the state law. It protects a broader number of persons – all employees in public institutions and other legal entities in the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nOn the other hand, the Law on the Protection of Whistle-Blowers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet been adopted but is being drafted. According to a report by Transparency International Bosnia and Herzegovina, the analysis of the draft law that is being prepared indicates a great similarity with the legal solution adopted in Republika Srpska. Therefore, with the draft Law still under discussion, the legal protection of whistle-blowers is not yet regulated in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it is not known, once enacted, what level of whistle-blowers protection will law provide. This means that potential whistle-blowers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina do not enjoy legal protection, as in Republika Srpska, the Brčko District or institutions at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGuidelines\n\nThere is no single legal and institutional framework for whistle-blower protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The existing legal framework is inconsistent, and whistle-blower protection rights are uneven in the context of internal or external protection. In addition, the current laws in force cover \"half\" of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so persons who are and work in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina do not enjoy legal protection in accordance with the prescribed standards. Despite the lack of a legal framework for protection, whistle-blowers in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina can also turn to the Centre for Free Legal Aid of Transparency International, providing protection to all persons who report corruption since 2003. According to the last published Report for 2020, out of 240 reports acted upon by the Centre, 18 reports were categorised as \"whistle-blowing\".\n\nThe existing laws in force stipulate that the institutions to which the application of the law applies must issue instructions or other internal acts regulating the procedure upon internal reporting of corruption and protection of the person who reported corruption. When it comes to state law, in 2015 the Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina published an example of the Rulebook on Internal Reporting of Corruption and Protection of Persons Reporting Corruption in State-Level Institutions to facilitate its adaptation and adoption in all BiH institutions. In addition, the Agency published a short brochure explaining the procedure for reporting corruption.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, civil society organisations have a very important role to play in promoting and advocating for whistle-blower protection activities. The Manual for the Protection of Whistle-blowers in State-Level Institutions was developed within the project Anti-Corruption Network of Civil Society Organisations in BiH - ACCOUNT with the financial support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In addition to the review of key international standards of protection and the review of the legal framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the manual contains a special section dedicated to providing explanations and instructions on the procedure for reporting corruption and the protection procedure covered by the law on reporting corruption in state-level institutions.\n\nGood practices\n\nAlthough existing laws provide for internal and external protection of whistle-blowers, there is very limited data on the number of reported cases. In Republika Srpska, according to available data, one case of judicial protection of whistle-blowers was recorded in 2018. while at the state level, since the law came into force in 2014, the Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the competent institution, has granted formal whistle-blower status to 11 out of 24 reports. In this regard, the good practice of whistle-blower protection is very limited, because in the reported cases people encountered very difficult and lengthy institutional processes and a kind of institutional \"retaliation\" in the form of disciplinary proceedings, degradation in the workplace, and ultimately in some cases dismissal.\n\nOne of the first examples of good practice is the case of Mr Danko Bogdanović, Head of the Brčko Customs Office, Indirect Taxation Authority of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Namely, Mr Bogdanović reported corruption in good faith in 2013, followed by police actions \"Master\" and \"Pandora\", which resulted in the arrest of dozens of people. However, Mr Bogdanovic went through illegal disciplinary proceedings as a form of retaliation for reporting corruption, resulting in a two-year suspension from his job. The Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as the competent institution for the protection of whistle-blowers in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, only after half a year, granted Mr Bogdanović, in accordance with the Law, the status of a whistle-blower. This initially had no significant effect because the suspension lasted for two years. In March 2015, the Agency for Prevention of Corruption and Coordination of the Fight against Corruption issued the first Instruction on the elimination of harmful actions committed against the protected whistle-blower that was delivered to the Indirect Taxation Authority. After the Agency’s Instruction, as well as media and civil society pressure Mr Bogdanović returned to work in June 2015, a year after acquiring the status of a whistle-blower. Although most of those arrested in the \"Master\" and \"Pandora\" actions were released, Mr Kemal Čausević, former Director of the Indirect Taxation Authority, was sentenced in May 2021, after a seven-year trial, to nine years in prison and confiscation of illegally acquired property. In addition, in the same proceedings, Mr Anes Sadiković was sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nDisclosure is the act of routinely publishing and updating particular types of information, sometimes required by law, such as the financial interests of public officials. It can support anti-corruption measures by requiring the routine publication of assets and interests that could represent a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest arises, or can be perceived to arise, when the private assets or interests of public officials can improperly influence policies and decisions taken during the exercise of their official duties.\n\nInternational standards\n\nDisclosure requirements can build citizens' trust in the transparency and integrity of local decision-making. They also assist public officials in having regularly updated information that prevents conflicts of interest arising among employees. Disclosure of financial assets also provides important information to help clarify if elected officials or civil servants do not have wealth that is disproportionate to their income, either protecting them from false accusations or serving as evidence in the case of suspected illicit enrichment.\n\nService delivery at the local government level, whether it be construction or tendering of waste-management services, is often subject to conflicts of interest due to the proximity of local entrepreneurs to government officials. Confidence of the public and business that competition for local government tenders, for instance, is open to all without discrimination will be much greater if both elected officials and civil servants involved in design of the tenders and assessment of tender submissions have completed declarations of assets and interests (including of close family members).\n\nIt is important that the institutions responsible for gathering and monitoring declarations are provided with protection against political or other interference in their work, for instance through oversight by independent ethics committees. Likewise, local government officials should be provided with clear guidance on what to declare, and also on prevailing anti-corruption legislation. A well-implemented and regularly updated and monitored assets declaration system can complement the work of an effective prosecution service.\n\nDisclosure is an important element in the conventions and standards against corruption listed elsewhere in this handbook. Of particular relevance are:\n\nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe’s Recommendation on Codes of Conduct for Public Officials and the European Code of Conduct for all Persons Involved in Local and Regional Governance require private interests to be declared, made public and monitored.\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s Resolution and Recommendation on Conflicts of interest at local and regional level call on local and regional authorities to promote the proactive disclosure of declarations of interest prior to public request and to ensure that disclosure policies are accompanied by appropriate measures for resolving conflicts of interest.\n\nThe OECD’s Managing Conflict of Interest in Public Service: Guidelines and Country Experiences provides practical instruments for modernising conflict-of-interest policies.\n\nThe OECD’s Asset Declarations for Public Officials: A Tool to Prevent Corruption identifies the key elements of asset declaration systems.\n\nConsultation, Participation & Disclosure of Information, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank.\n\nDomestic context\n\nWhen it comes to declarations of assets and conflicts of interest, it is necessary to distinguish between the obligation to report data on income and ownership of assets and financial interests on the one hand and the existence of a possible conflict of interest of public servants or employees in administrative bodies and elected officials on the other hand.\n\nDepending on the level of government, the areas of disclosure of assets and conflicts of interest are regulated differently. At some levels of government, the obligation to report assets and the existence of conflicts of interest are regulated for both civil servants and all employees in administrative bodies, while at some levels of government, such as the level of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this is not the case. The obligation to report assets data for appointed officials is more or less centralised.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe legal framework for conflicts of interest is regulated through several laws, primarily depending on whether it affects civil servants and employees or elected officials. All civil service laws at the level of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina (state level), the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska, the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the applicable cantonal laws prescribe the incompatibility of certain functions with the work of a civil servant. In addition, when appointed as civil servants, civil servants are obliged to present all information on the property available to them or their family members, as well as on the activities and functions performed by the civil servant and his family members. Unlike the state law, which more broadly prescribes the obligation to provide property information, the Law on Civil Service in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulates the responsibility of a civil servant to present all information on property available only to the civil servant (without mentioning family members) when being appointed in civil service.\n\nThe Laws on Civil Service in the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina additionally prescribe the obligations of the competent authorities to keep this data in the records or registers of the civil service in accordance with the regulations on data protection.\n\nAlthough the Law on Civil Servants of the Republika Srpska similarly prescribes incompatibilities with the duties of a civil servant, it does not contain provisions on the obligation of a civil servant to present all information about the property (s)he has at her/his disposal during his appointment. On the other hand, unlike other valid laws on civil service, articles 22 to 22b of the law of the Republika Srpska contain special provisions that define conflicts of interest, and appropriate actions in case of conflicts of interest. Article 22a stipulates that if a civil servant has kept silent about the existence of a conflict of interest during employment, the head of the institution is obliged to initiate disciplinary proceedings. In accordance with article 22b the same applies to the case when the civil servant has not eliminated the reasons leading to the conflict of interest within the prescribed time limit. Article 67 of the Law on Civil Servants and Employees in Local Self-Government Units of the Republika Srpska stipulates that a person can be employed in the city or municipal administration who, among other things, is not in a conflict of interest, namely does not perform a duty incompatible with duties of officials in the city or municipal administration.\n\nThe Election Law of Bosnia and Herzegovina regulates the election of members and delegates of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina and members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina and determines the principles that apply to elections at all levels of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. When it comes to property statements of elected officials, Article 15.7 of the Election Law stipulates that “candidates elected at all levels of government, including local self-government, are required to submit to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Central Election Commission, on a certain form, a signed statement of their total assets…”, and that “the elected member at all levels is obliged to submit a report on the financial situation to the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina within 30 days after the expiration of the mandate for which he was elected, as well as in case of termination of mandate… within 30 days from the end of mandate ”. In accordance with article 19.10, in the case of non-compliance with the obligations, fines in the range of 300.00 to 3,000.00 KM are prescribed.\n\nThe issue of conflicts of interest of elected officials, executive office holders and advisers is regulated through four laws - the Law on Conflict of Interest in Government Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Law on Conflict of Interest in Government Bodies in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest Srpska, and the Law on Conflict of Interest in the Institutions of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina.1 Laws are enacted to prevent and / or sanction situations in which public officials may benefit themselves or persons with whom they are family or otherwise related may benefit through the performance of their functions.\n\nThe Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina is responsible for law enforcement at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Brcko District. In the Republika Srpska, there is a special Commission for the Prevention of Conflicts of Interest in the Republika Srpska authorities, as a first instance body formed by the Republika Srpska National Assembly and as a second instance body the Commission for Appeals. Sanctions are envisaged for violating the law – including measures prohibiting candidacy for any elected position for four years, and fines ranging from BAM 1,000 to 10,000.\n\nGuidelines\n\nAware of the risk of illegal acquisition of property and conflicts of interest and the need to fight corruption, a new Regulation on the manner of keeping the register of employees in the civil service of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in July 2020. The new Regulation expanded the scope of application, namely record keeping, not only for those who have the status of a civil servant but also for all employees in the civil service bodies in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Regulation also envisages the introduction of a card of assets for all employees. The same applies to all employees in the civil service bodies of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, cantons, cities and municipalities, and other bodies and services unless otherwise regulated by cantonal regulations. On the website www.adsfbih.gov.ba, in the section \"Register\" it is possible to download all the forms that constitute the so-called e-card of the employee, which is entered in the above-mentioned Register.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to assets records and conflicts of interest of elected officials, on the website of the Central Election Commission (www.izbori.ba) the following are available: instructions on the appearance and manner of filling out forms of declarations of assets, forms of declarations of assets, and a user guide for completing the application to submit a statement of assets. The Central Election Commission has also developed a manual in the field of conflict of interest laws, which explains in detail everything related to the laws, procedures, and case law.\n\nGood practices\n\nCommitted to the fight against corruption, increasing transparency and accountability of public office holders in Sarajevo Canton, in 2019 the Sarajevo Canton Assembly adopted the Law on Reporting and Verification of Data on Property of Public Office Holders in Sarajevo Canton. This Law determines the obligations of elected and appointed officials, holders of executive functions and advisers, to report existing property and income, origin and changes of property and income, as well as gifts they receive during the performance of public office.\n\nThe Office for the Fight against Corruption and Quality Management of Sarajevo Canton is responsible for implementing this Law, which means that the Office has the authority to collect, verify and process property data of public office holders, and establish and maintain the Property Data Register. In addition, the Office can launch misdemeanour proceedings and initiate criminal proceedings for violation of the provisions of the Law. The Register of Data on the Assets of Holders of Public Functions in the Canton of Sarajevo is publicly available on the website www.anticorrupiks.com, as is the Form of Reporting Assets, the Table for Submission of Data Provided by Law, and the User’s Guide for Filling in the Form of Reporting Data on the Property of Holders of Public Office in the Sarajevo Canton. In addition, Sarajevo Canton is the only canton that has an established and publicly available Register of Public Sector Employees in Sarajevo Canton.\n\nAccess to information is the legal right for citizens to request and receive information from public authorities. It is often enacted by Freedom of Information legislation. As an integral part of the right of freedom of expression, access to information is a human right and everyone should have the right to access information from public bodies and public agencies in accordance with the principle of maximum disclosure subject to only a narrow, clearly defined, set of exceptions proportionate to the interest that justifies them (e.g. grounds of security or data privacy). More information here and here.\n\nInternational standards\n\nAccess to information supports accountability, oversight of government, and monitoring of corruption. It is also critical to informed citizen participation in decision-making, and is therefore fundamental for the effective functioning of democracies. Free access to information empowers civil society to monitor and scrutinise the actions of local authorities, it serves to prevent abuse of power by public officials, and provides data for informed public debate.\n\nThe proactive publication of the maximum amount of information in the most accessible formats serves to reduce the need for citizens and stakeholders to file individual requests for the release of information. As well as providing the maximum amount of information electronically, local authorities should prioritise the designation of Freedom of Information officers in their municipalities. Such officers should prepare and publish detailed recommendations for both citizens and local authorities, and provide clear guidance on the appeals process in the event that a request for information is not granted. It is also important to analyse information requests from citizens and stakeholder groups, in particular trends and duplication, so that the authorities can subsequently release such information on a proactive basis.\n\nAccess to information is a fundamental component of a number of the conventions and standards against corruption listed elsewhere in this handbook. It also underpins a number of key UN human rights documents. The following specifically relate to Access to Information:\n\nThe Council of Europe’s Convention on Access to Official Documents (CETS No. 205) affirms an enforceable right to information.\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s Resolution and Recommendation on Transparency and open government call upon local and regional authorities to increase the use of open data and records management by their administrations, and to publish these in comprehensive, accessible and reusable ways.\n\nThe Aarhus Convention grants rights, including access to information, in decisions concerning the environment.\n\nThe OECD Recommendation of the Council on Open Government identifies on-demand provision of information and proactive measures by the government to disseminate information as an initial level of citizen participation.\n\nResolution 59 of the UN General Assembly adopted in 1946, states that “freedom of information is a fundamental human right”, and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) states that the fundamental right of freedom of expression encompasses the freedom to “to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers”.\n\nDirective 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information, nowadays called the Open Data Directive, previously known as the PSI Directive, encourages EU member states to make as much public sector information available for re-use as possible.\n\nDomestic context\n\nAs an integral component of the right to freedom of expression, the right to access to information is a human right guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights and other international conventions and declarations. Although the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not explicitly guarantee it, the right to free access to information indirectly derives from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is an integral part of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is directly applicable, and therefore has supremacy over all other regulations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina was the first country in the Western Balkans to adopt regulations on free access to information in the 2000s. This was primarily the result of the international community's efforts to develop a democratic society and a functioning public administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, since the 2000s, there have been no major developments in the context of the development of the legal and institutional framework for free access to information, which is why existing regulations have weaknesses and shortcomings in implementation. The regulations in force are not harmonised with international standards, which was confirmed by the institution of the Human Rights Ombudsman of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Commission. Another problem is the inconsistency of laws and the lack of adequate institutional mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing laws in force in BiH.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe freedom of access to information in Bosnia and Herzegovina is regulated at the state and entity levels of government. The Law on Freedom of Access to Information of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in 2000, while the Law on Freedom of Access to Information of the Republika Srpska and the Law on Freedom of Access to Information of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina were adopted in 2001.\n\nThe applicable laws on freedom of access to information of the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina apply to all public bodies in the Republika Srpska or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including all executive, legislative, judicial bodies, as well as bodies performing public office, or any other administrative body and legal entity owned by a public or administrative body. Thus, local governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina apply entity laws, depending on whether they are administratively located in the Republika Srpska or the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All laws regulate the procedure for access to information and the obligation of public authorities to provide the necessary information at the request of a natural or legal person, except for exceptions that are clearly defined by law, such as \"crime prevention and any detection of crime.\" In addition, the applicable laws stipulate the obligation of all public bodies to appoint information officers, but also to publish or submit a guide on access to information, an indexed register of information, statistical data, and annual reports. The latest published Report of the Human Rights Ombudsman of Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that most of the surveyed public bodies meet these obligations under the law.\n\nAlthough the existing laws on freedom of access to information were amended and changed on several occasions, there was no significant harmonisation with international and European standards. Some of the key shortcomings of the three current freedom of information laws are:\n\n- Lack of provisions on proactive transparency in all laws in force\n\n- Lack of provisions on mandatory adoption of an administrative act (Decision) in case of denial of the right to access information in the Law on Freedom of Access to Information of the Republika Srpska, which prevents the right to appeal\n\n- Very limited and inefficient supervisory and grievance mechanisms\n\n- Lack of provisions on fines in the laws on freedom of access to information of the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n- impossibility of electronic submission of requests for free access to information\n\nGuidelines\n\nAll laws on freedom of access to information in Bosnia and Herzegovina prescribe the obligation to issue instructions on the application of the law on freedom of access to information. In 2001, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued the Instruction on the Implementation of the Law on Freedom of Access to Information, which regulates issues that should contribute to the effective implementation of the law. Considering that the state law is applied in the Brčko District, the Instruction on the application of the Law on Freedom of Access to Information of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in Brčko.\n\nIn 2013, within the project \"Monitoring and Advocacy for Good Governance in Municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina\", Transparency International in Bosnia and Herzegovina developed a manual for local government representatives \"How to Improve Transparency and Accountability of Local Governments\". The Manual has a section dedicated to the application of the law on freedom of access to information in local governments, with explanations and examples of guides for access to information, a model of the Decision on approval of a request for access to information, an example of an information access request form, a model of a Decision to reject a request for access to information, and an example of an information register index.\n\nIn the last Special Report on Freedom of Access to Information in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2020, the Ombudsman for Human Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina made a number of recommendations to the competent institutions to improve the current situation in the field of the right to free access to information. Among other things, it is recommended to all competent institutions to develop guidelines for applying applicable laws that will be intended for holders of information and to establish closer cooperation with civil society and media that can inform the public about the right to freedom of information.\n\nGood practices\n\nIn 2015, the Public Administration Reform Coordinator's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina, prepared through the Program for Strengthening Public Institutions implemented in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the German International Cooperation Agency (GIZ), a report entitled Policy and Standards for Proactive Transparency. In 2018, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted this document and instructed all Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions to act according to it and update their websites. To this end, a self-assessment questionnaire was developed containing 38 standards of proactive transparency and an accompanying online tool for research purposes. Data for 2021 show that the fulfilment of the proactive transparency standard is 67.57%, which is an improvement compared with 2020, when the number was 64.04%.\n\nThe Directorate for European Integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina is an institution that strives to meet all the prescribed standards of proactive transparency. A register of all responses to requests for freedom of access to information from 2018 has been published on the website of the Directorate for European Integration https://www.dei.gov.ba/hr/pristup-informacijama, although this obligation is not prescribed by law.\n\nThe City of Gracanica can also be mentioned as an example of good practice. On the website of the city, https://gracanica.gov.ba/slobodan-pristup-informacijama/, there is a freedom of information section. Citizens can download the valid Law on Freedom of Access to Information in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with a Guide for Access to Information, Instructions on the Application of the Law on Freedom of Access to Information, Application Form for access to information as well as index register information. In addition, citizens can submit requests for access to information through an integrated online form on the website, with the possibility of receiving a response by e-mail.\n\nOpen data is the publication of data and information in a format that may be freely used, modified and shared. The OECD states that open data is “a set of policies that promote transparency, accountability and value creation by making government data available to all”. By making data generated through the activities of public bodies available, government becomes more transparent and accountable to citizens. It also supports business growth and the development of services centred on citizens, and provides important data for research and innovation by public bodies, the private sector, and civic stakeholders.\n\nInternational standards\n\nThe promotion of open data through one-stop portals can further increase the scope for interoperability of datasets in terms of search and analysis. The results can improve the efficiency and reach of service delivery and reduce corruption. Awareness-raising among stakeholder groups, the media, businesses, and the wider public can result in effective co-operation among different stakeholders and improvements in solutions on transportation, recreation facilities, parking zones, health services, and much more.\n\nIt is important to adopt consistent open data standards for all open data to ensure maximum interoperability and searchability of data. Local authorities should also ensure that qualified staff manage the municipality's open data publication, and train relevant employees in open data standards.\n\nOpen data is a relatively new phenomenon without officially endorsed standards. However, a number of useful guidelines exist:\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s Resolution and Recommendation on Open data for better public services explain its importance for improving local democracy.\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s Resolution and Recommendation on Transparency and open government call upon local and regional authorities to increase the use of open data and records management by their administrations.\n\nThe United Nations Guidelines on Open Government Data for Citizen Engagement introduce policy guidelines and good practice recommendations.\n\nThis World Bank Toolkit starts from the basics, through to planning and implement, as well as avoiding common pitfalls.\n\nThe Five Star Open Data Deployment Scheme provides five steps to fully opening data, explaining the costs and benefits of each.\n\nThe International Open Data Charter sets out six principles for open, timely and interoperable government data.\n\nThe OECD Recommendation of the Council on Open Government identifies on-demand provision of information and proactive measures by the government to disseminate information as an initial level of citizen participation.\n\nDomestic context\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is in the early stages of implementing open data standards. Although government institutions at all levels \"produce\" large amounts of data, currently in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are no regulations on the obligation to publish such data in an open format. Open data has been on the government agenda more actively since Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Open Government Partnership (OGP) in September 2014. In addition to certain strategic documents prescribing the importance of open data, limited efforts have been made to implement open data standards in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nLegislation\n\nNo level of government in Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted a regulation regarding the obligation to publish data according to an open standard. Some progress has been made at the state level, where several strategic documents have been adopted to recognize the importance of open data. In 2017, the Council of Ministers of BiH adopted the Policy for the Development of the Information Society of Bosnia and Herzegovina 2017 - 2021, within which the establishment of a database of public data for public use is envisaged. Additionally, in 2018, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Interoperability Framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina, within which the concept of open standards and open codes in public administration was promoted. The Strategic Framework also confirms open data as an important area of public administration reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the framework provides for the preparation of the Analysis of the Readiness of BiH institutions to open data and the adoption of Open Data Policy until 2022.\n\nGuidelines\n\nSince Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the „Open Government Partnership“ Initiative, the role of civil society in promoting open data standards has intensified. In 2016, two open data management manuals were adopted. CPI Foundation, in cooperation with the Centre for Budget Monitoring from Amsterdam, prepared the Manual for Public Data Management, and in the same year through the project \"Proactive Transparency of Public Institutions\" funded by the Government of the United Kingdom, Transparency International in Bosnia and Herzegovina prepared an Open Data Readiness Assessment in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This analysis has shown that significant political, financial and institutional preconditions are needed to introduce open data.\n\nNew activities have been started through the Program for Strengthening Public Institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, funded by the German GIZ. In September 2020, the Open Data Readiness Assessment in Bosnia and Herzegovina was published based on the recognised methodology of the World Bank. This is part of the activities envisaged by the Strategic Plan for Public Administration Reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The preparation of such an analysis is also planned for the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This document provides an overview of key institutional shortcomings and the necessary steps for introducing open data into Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions.\n\nGood practices\n\nThe first open data portal www.opendata.ba was the result of the work of the CPI Foundation with the financial support of the Embassy of the Netherlands in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although this was the first open data portal in Bosnia and Herzegovina, due to the lack of financial resources and the need for government institutions to take responsibility for opening data, the portal has been shut down. The first commitments of the authorities on the introduction of open data were made through the first OGP Action Plan of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina for implementation in 2019 - 2021. This Action Plan envisages the introduction of open data standards in public procurement and statistical data in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn October 2021, the Public Administration Reform Coordinator's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina presented the first pilot open data portal for the level of institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but it has not yet been officially published.\n\nThrough the United Nations Development Program initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNDP) and with the support of the Embassy of Sweden in Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2021, the beginning of the project \"Open Data Portal of the City of Prijedor\" was announced. This is the first local community in Bosnia and Herzegovina to start activities on introducing open data.\n\nPublic procurement refers to the process by which public authorities, including local authorities, purchase work, goods or services. It is an essential part of public service provision for local and regional authorities; efficient and cost-effective procurement is key to good governance.\n\nInternational standards\n\nAs procurement involves a large proportion of public expenditure and the transfer of public resources to the private sector or non-profit organisations, it is particularly vulnerable to corruption. Public authorities should deploy new technologies to increase transparency over public procurement and encourage new economic actors to enter bidding processes in the confidence that free and fair competition is applied. By posting all tenders on a common online platform, the occurrence of unpublished tenders and direct awards will be minimised. Use of open contracting and open bidding solutions also allows greater scrutiny of the process, further reducing the scope for corrupt practices. Open contracting systems include a preventive effect, because officials will refrain from manipulating the contracting process if they know that comprehensive disclosure of the bidding and contracting processes will be revealed.\n\nLocal authorities should ensure that there is a comprehensive system in place to monitor compliance with public procurement legislation, and that there is a responsive mechanism for reviewing appeals and complaints, including prompt and comprehensive replies. Authorities should also monitor contract implementation, in particular time extensions and cost increases, to ensure that the benefits in terms of value for money and quality of delivery are not compromised during contract implementation.\n\nThe following international conventions and standards relate to public procurement:\n\nThe Congress of the Council of Europe’s Resolution and Recommendation on Making public procurement transparent at local and regional levels and the OECD Checklist for Enhancing Integrity in Public Procurement provide guidance for enhancing transparency and promoting integrity in procurement.\n\nThe OECD Recommendation of the Council on Public Procurement promotes a strategic and holistic use of public procurement systems across all levels of government and state-owned enterprises. The online Public Procurement Toolbox provides policy tools, specific country examples as well as indicators to measure any public procurement system.\n\nThe WTO Agreement on Government Procurement establishes rules requiring that open, fair and transparent conditions of competition be ensured in government procurement.\n\nThe EU Directive on Public Procurement ensures the best value for money for public purchases and guarantees the respect of the EU’s principles of transparency and competition.\n\nThe UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement is a legal template available to governments seeking to introduce or reform public procurement legislation for their internal market.\n\nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (ERBD) Guide to Electronic Procurement Reform provides information on and assistance with designing and implementing domestic eProcurement reforms.\n\nOpen Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), providing open data standard for publication of structured information on all stages of a contracting process: from planning to implementation.\n\nUNODC’s (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) Guidebook on anti-corruption in public procurement and the management of public finances, which provides good practices in ensuring compliance with article 9 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption.\n\nWorld Bank’s Annual Reports – Benchmarking Public Procurement, which have been assessing public procurement regulatory systems in different countries.\n\nDomestic context\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, about BAM 2.5 to 3 billion are spent annually on public procurement, representing about 7-8% of GDP. In the EU, it is estimated that about 13% of public procurement funds \"disappear\" due to corruption. Although there are no reference data for Bosnia and Herzegovina, these percentages are estimated to be higher. The public procurement system in Bosnia and Herzegovina was significantly improved in 2014 with the adoption of new regulations and the gradual introduction of electronic public procurement. Although this was a significant improvement over the previous legal and institutional framework, significant irregularities and corrupt practices are still observed in public procurement procedures in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was particularly evident in public procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the public procurement system still shows shortcomings in legal and institutional terms. The need to harmonize the Law on Public Procurement with the EU Directives on public procurement from 2014 and strengthen the capacity of competent institutions is stated as one of the key priorities set by the European Commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to gain the status of a candidate country for EU membership.\n\nLegislation\n\nNew regulations on public procurement in Bosnia and Herzegovina were adopted in 2014. The Law on Public Procurement of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the accompanying bylaws were a significant step forward from the regulations in force since 2004. The law prescribed procedures and rules, defined the obligations of contracting authorities and bidders, legal protection and the role of competent institutions. The Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina has the task of ensuring the adequate application of the Law and accompanying bylaws, while the Office for Review of Complaints is an independent and autonomous institution that handles complaints procedures in the second instance.\n\nFrom the local to the state level, all contracting authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina are obliged to conduct public procurement procedures through the central electronic public procurement portal https://ejn.gov.ba. According to the current level of functionality of the public procurement portal and in accordance with the law and accompanying regulations, information can be found on the portal: procurement notices, contract award notices, notices of cancellation of public procurement procedures, contract award notices through negotiated procedures without publication of notices, voluntary ex-ante transparency notices, reports on the public procurement procedure in small value procedures, decisions of the Office for Review of Appeals and decisions of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The tender documentation is available to the public only for completed procedures, while only registered bidders have access to the tender documents for the ongoing procedures. It is the tender documentation that contains technical specifications and qualifications that are crucial for effective monitoring. However, although a good part of the data from the procedures has been published on the portal, the data were not published in an open format and as such are not machine-readable or cross-searchable. The Law on Amendments to the Law on Public Procurement of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would further improve the public procurement system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is currently under consideration in the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nGuidelines\n\nIn accordance with Article 92 of the Law, the Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is, among other things, in charge of publishing manuals and instructions for more efficient application of the law, but also providing technical assistance and advisory opinions to contracting authorities and bidders regarding proper application of the law and bylaws.\n\nOn its website https://www.javnenabavke.gov.ba/bs-Latn-BA/practical-application, the Public Procurement Agency has created a module with a list of questions and answers regarding the practical application of the Law on Public Procurement and the e- procurement portal. In addition, the Agency issued a series of instructions prescribing models of tender documentation and bids, publication of basic elements of contracts and contract amendments, conditions and methods of publishing notices and submitting reports in public procurement procedures in the e-procurement portal, instructions on managing and establishing qualification systems, minutes on the opening of bids and instructions on how to keep the minutes on the opening of bids. In order to efficiently implement the e-procurement portal, the Instruction on how to use the information system for e-procurement was adopted. In addition, the Public Procurement Agency has open telephone lines and e-mail addresses through which technical and advisory assistance to contracting authorities and bidders is provided twice a week within the prescribed period.\n\nA significant number of manuals, guides, and instructions on the application of laws and bylaws in the field of public procurement in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been developed by civil society organisations. In cooperation with the Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Centre for Security Studies has published a Guide to Public Procurement in Bosnia and Herzegovina to promote transparency and accountability in the public procurement process. For the purpose of more efficient prevention and abuse and more efficient prosecution and sanctioning of criminal acts of corruption in public procurement, in 2019 the Network of Civil Society Organisations \"Account\" presented the Manual for Judges and Prosecutors: Corruption Risks in Public Procurement Procedures.\n\nGood practices\n\nWith the introduction of electronic public procurement through the e-procurement portal https://ejn.gov.ba, a significant step forward has been made in public procurement procedures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, a mobile e-procurement application for iOS, Android and Windows devices has been developed. The e-procurement portal is gradually developing and improving, and in the next period it is planned to introduce functionality for submitting electronic bids and electronic evaluation of received bids, as well as the obligation to publish procurement plans on the e-procurement portal. In the OGP 2019 -2021 Action Plan, the Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina proposed a measure introducing open contracting data standards in public procurement (OCDS) whose introduction will enable the implementation of effective monitoring mechanisms to prevent irregularities.\n\nAlthough significant information and data on public procurement procedures are available on the e-procurement portal, some of the key information to achieve greater transparency is still missing. According to Transparency International BIH, it is necessary to make mandatory the publication of Procurement Plans and Reports on the implementation of public procurement contracts, the publication of notices on contract awards in competitive request procedure, and the publication of procurement contracts. The tender documentation for ongoing procurement procedures in the e-procurement portal is available only to registered bidders. In 2018, the Public Procurement Agency made the tender documentation for completed procurement procedures available to the public. However, in terms of procurement transparency, it is still crucial to make the tender documentation for ongoing procurement procedures available to the public in the e-procurement portal.\n\nThrough the USAID project \"Support to Citizens in the Fight Against Corruption\", the Centre for Civil Initiatives, in partnership with Transparency International and the Association Centre for Media Development and Analysis, created a web portal https://pratimotendere.ba, which was launched in early 2021. This public procurement monitoring portal is based on a methodology within which seven risk indicators have been defined in seven phases of the procurement procedure. The level of risk is indicated by “red flags” – high, medium and low. By November 2021, 432 contracting authorities were monitored, covering 10,003 public procurement procedures with a total value of KM 182.5 million. In that period, a total of 8,707 risky public procurements were identified. This portal is also supported by the Public Procurement Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which a Memorandum of Cooperation was signed in order to prevent corruption and irregularities in public procurement.\n\nExternal audit is the regular, independent scrutiny of accounts and financial information to ensure that public money is used appropriately and effectively. External audits are undertaken in accordance with relevant laws and rules to support those external to government to hold it to account. As well as audit of the financial statements of local budget institutions, external audit can look beyond finances to assessing the performance of government against its own objectives, or in providing programmes and services.\n\nInternational standards\n\nThe International Public Sector Accounting Standards focus on the accounting, auditing, and financial reporting needs of central, regional, and local governments, related governmental agencies, and the constituencies they serve.\n\nThe International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions website contains a complete collection of professional standards and best practice guidelines for public sector auditors.\n\nA number of the conventions and standards for combatting corruption include provisions and clauses relating to external audit.\n\nDomestic context\n\nA legal and institutional framework for external audit has been established in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The external audit is performed through four institutions, the Audit Office of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Audit Office of the Institutions of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Main Audit Service of the Republika Srpska, and the Audit Office of the Public Administration and Institutions of the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with four accompanying laws.\n\nAlthough the legislative framework is sound, SIGMA states that one of the problems is that audit offices do not have a constitutional basis in accordance with international standards. This means that, although the laws guarantee the independence and autonomy of audit institutions, they are not adequately protected because laws can be changed more easily than the constitution. In the early 2000s, Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the international and European organisation of audit institutions – INTOSAI and EUROSAI. All audit institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina have accepted the application of relevant International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAI) and other international audit standards. In accordance with the laws, the financial audit of local authorities is carried out by the competent entity audit institutions.\n\nLegislation\n\nFour laws regulate external audit in Bosnia and Herzegovina –Law on Audit of Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Law on Audit of the Public Sector of the Republika Srpska, Law on Audit of Institutions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Law on Audit of Public Administration and Institutions in the Brčko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina. All four laws are in line with relevant international regulations and standards. In order to more efficiently coordinate and implement joint internal and international activities, a Coordination Board of Audit Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established. All audit offices/services, in accordance with the four mentioned laws on external audit, conduct financial audits, performance audits, and special audits. Local levels of government are subject to external audit by the Audit Office of the Institutions of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or the Public Sector Audit Service of the Republika Srpska. Given a large number of institutions subject to mandatory annual audit, the audit of local levels of government in the Federation of BiH and the Republika Srpska is carried out according to annual plans. When adopting annual audit plans, risk analyses are performed to identify other agencies or institutions in need of audit. Indicators considered include financial significance, previous audits, available human resources, requests for audit from other competent authorities, collected business information, and other data.\n\nGuidelines\n\nImproving the work of external audit institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the strategic goals of public administration reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This primarily refers to strengthening the role and capacity of audit institutions and mechanisms for better implementation of audit recommendations. Although parliamentary mechanisms for examining audit reports have been established at all levels of government, the level of control varies and is very limited. The European Commission states that the influence of all audit institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina is limited, and that it is necessary to improve the level of implementation of recommendations. It further states that all audit institutions need to have better media coverage and develop their communication strategies to enhance the impact of their work. In the period 2006-2016, the Coordination Board, within its competencies, adopted a number of guides and guidelines for financial audit, quality control in auditing, performance audit guide, IT audit guidelines and a guide for quality assurance of audit performance. SIGMA states that all audit institutions need to compile a document that would include all audit processes, listing templates and models to be completed alongside other supporting documents. Such a document would allow employees to understand better the processes and roles that each of them has. In order to approximate the work of external audit, in May 2019, a Short Guide to the Audit Office of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina was published.\n\nGood practices\n\nAll audit offices of institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina transparently publish all performance audit reports, financial audits and special reports on their websites. The Audit Office of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Audit Office of the Institutions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina have also published the Registers of Performance Audit and Financial Audit Recommendations. These registers contain a systematic overview of all recommendations, responsible institutions and the degree of their implementation. Every year, the Audit Office of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina publishes abbreviated reports and infographics on the conducted audits with key findings in order to give the interested public a better insight into the results of the conducted external audits.\n\nThe Audit Office of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina holds regular consultative meetings with civil society organisations. The aim of these meetings is to acquaint civil society organisations with the procedures for creating annual performance audit programs and obtain information to identify topics of social importance that could be subject to audit. At the Civic Initiatives Centre initiative, a Working Group for the Improvement of the Audit Process was formed in October 2020, which, in addition to the mentioned organisation, consists of representatives of the state-level legislative, judicial, and executive authorities.\n\nFinancing of political parties and election campaigns is a necessary component of the democratic process. It enables the expression of political support and competition in elections. Principles governing the financing of political parties should include fairness in the distribution of state funding, strict rules concerning the transparency and limits on the size of private donations, ceilings on campaign expenditure, full transparency of funding and expenditure, independent election commissions, independent audit of campaign finance, and the consistent imposition of proportionate sanctions on candidates and political parties that violate the rules (such as fines or a reduction in state contributions to future election campaigns).\n\nInternational standards\n\nClear rules and transparent reporting of political campaign financing and expenditures are essential to sustain trust in political candidates, political parties and government institutions. An imbalance in funding of political parties may result in an unfair advantage, handing undue influence to powerful narrow interests, running the risk that policies will be \"captured\" by narrow private interests, serving their goals over the public interest.\n\nMechanisms and rules on limits on party political financing, and on state financing of political campaigns, should be designed in a way that provides a level playing field for the different political candidates and parties competing in elections and serves to preserve the political forces' independence from financial supporters.\n\nThe following international conventions and standards relate to the financing of political parties:\n\nDomestic context\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the issue of financing political parties is attracting a lot of attention from politicians, officials of election bodies and commissions, and representatives of the academic community, especially civil society, which is closely following this issue. A democratic society can function successfully only if the access of political parties to resources is equal, fair and transparent because \"political parties not only create a political agenda but also shape the institutional, economic and overall social development of the country, and supervise the administration and control the distribution and management of public resources.\" The greater the degree of control of political parties over state institutions and society, the greater the risk of corrupt practices. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a legislative framework regulating the financing of political parties. However, as in many other areas, the legislative framework is not sufficient to prevent abuses.\n\nArticles 3 to 7 of the Law on Financing of Political Parties of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulates that a political party can be financed from the membership fee, voluntary contributions from legal and natural persons, publishing activities, sales of propaganda material and organisation of party events, incomes generated by property owned by a political party; the budget of Bosnia and Herzegovina, entities’ budgets, cantonal budgets, the budget of Brčko District of BiH, and from a budget of other units of local government in accordance with the law; profit from the income of the enterprise owned by a political party only for culture-related or publishing activities, loans from the banks.\n\nThe annual income of the political party generated by owning property or through the owned enterprise may not exceed 20% of the amount of the total annual income of the party. According to Article 4 of the Law, any income exceeding 2"
