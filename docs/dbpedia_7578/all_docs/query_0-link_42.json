        "text": "Milorad Dodik, the president of the Serb-dominated entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has signed into law controversial changes approved by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska that effectively allow it to disregard decisions made by the country's international envoy.\n\nThe move on July 7 by Dodik, who has led an increasingly inflammatory campaign for years to encourage support for his secessionist hopes, comes six days after Bosnia's international envoy, Christian Schmidt, canceled several controversial rulings that defy a peace deal which ended the country's civil war.\n\nUnder the 1995 Dayton accords, Schmidt has the power to impose laws as the final interpreter of the state constitution, though his decisions can be reviewed and questioned by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia, if the Office of the High Representative (OHR) approves.\n\nThe accords, which ended the 1992-95 Bosnian War, established an administrative system under which the Bosnian state remains partitioned between Republika Srpska (RS) and the Muslim Bosniak-Croat Federation, connected by a weak central government.\n\nEthnic Serbs of RS have for years resisted Bosnia's central authorities, with the entity’s assembly voting on June 27 to suspend recognition of any decisions by the Bosnia's multiethnic Constitutional Court.\n\nThe change in the law signed by Dodik removes the OHR from the list of authorities whose acts are published by the official gazette, which publishes the decisions passed by the highest authorities, including the high representative.\n\n\"The recent decisions taken by the Assembly of Republika Srpska represent a direct violation of the constitutional order of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also of the Dayton peace agreement,\" Schmidt told journalists in Sarajevo on July 1.\n\nSerbs in Republika Srpska, the predominantly Serbian entity of Bosnia, say they do not recognize Schmidt, who was appointed in 2021 as the high representative because the UN Security Council did not endorse his appointment. China and Russia disputed his appointment because he was not confirmed by the council, but other nations said it was not required.\n\nThe British Embassy has said it backed Schmidt's actions and expressed the joint support of the so-called Quint nations in Bosnia -- the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on August 29 that he stands fully behind the decision to grant citizenship to Pavel Durov, a day after the Telegram co-founder and CEO was indicted in Paris on charges of failing to control illegal content on the popular messaging app.\n\nMacron, speaking in Belgrade at the start of a two-day state visit, said granting Durov citizenship was part of a strategy to enable star athletes, performers, and other foreigners who learned French to become French citizens.\n\n“I granted citizenship to Durov, who learned French, just as I did for some athletes and artists, and I think that's something good for our country. I will continue to do that every time,” Macron said.\n\nDurov, 39, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris over the weekend and he was charged on August 28 with several crimes related to alleged illicit activity on the messaging app.\n\nFrench prosecutors accuse Durov of complicity in allowing drug trafficking and the sharing of sexual images of children on Telegram, and of refusing to share documents demanded by authorities investigating illegal activity on the app.\n\nThe Russian-born Durov, who also has citizenship in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean archipelago of St. Kitts and Nevis, was granted conditional release on a bail of 5 million euros ($5.5 million) and on the condition that he report to a police station twice a week as well as remain in France, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said in a statement.\n\nThe French president said he didn’t know Durov was coming to France and that he didn’t invite him to visit.\n\n“I don't know anything more about it, and it's normal that I don't know because we are a state governed by the rule of law, where state institutions are independent,\" Macron said at a press conference in Belgrade after meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.\n\nThe question arose after French media reports said that Durov told police upon his arrest on August 24 that he was planning to meet with Macron.\n\nDurov's lawyer said it was \"absurd\" to suggest his client could be implicated in any crime committed on the app.\n\n\"Telegram complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology,\" lawyer David-Olivier Kaminski said.\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned France against turning the case into \"political persecution,\" emphasizing that Durov is a \"Russian citizen\" and \"we will be watching what happens next.\"\n\nThat is likely to be that the case will be sent to trial. The charge of \"complicity in the administration of an online platform to enable an illicit transaction\" alone carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of 500,000 euros ($550,000).\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine confirmed that an F-16 fighter jet crashed while repelling a missile and drone strike by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine.\n\nThe General Staff said in a Facebook post on August 29 that Ukrainian F-16s engaged in an air battle against the Russian barrage and shot down four enemy cruise missiles.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"During the approach to the next target, contact was lost with one of the planes. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died,\" the military said on August 29 on Facebook.\n\nA special commission of the Defense Ministry has been appointed to determine the causes of the accident, the General Staff said.\n\nSabrina Singh, deputy spokeswoman for the Pentagon, said she had seen the reports about the crash of the F-16, adding that she was not aware of any request for assistance since the incident. She told a briefing that she had no further information, but added that pilots have been training in the United States and referred to the difficulties they face once in battle.\n\n\"I will say, broadly speaking, combat aviation is very complex,\" Singh said. \"We are very proud to train pilots here in the United States, and our allies are also training pilots for Ukraine. Everyday they fly these aircraft. There are brave men and women who defend the skies.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force reported that the pilot was Oleksiy Mes and said he died while repelling a massive Russian strike. During the air battle, three cruise missiles and one drone were destroyed, the air force said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that an F-16 was destroyed in a crash on August 26. An unidentified U.S. official quoted by the newspaper said that, although the incident occurred during a massive Russian missile barrage, initial reports indicated that the jet wasn’t shot down by enemy fire, and it was likely crashed as a result of pilot error.\n\nCNN reported, however, that according to sources, the Ukrainian military does not believe that pilot error was the cause of the incident. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, and international experts will be invited to participate in it.\n\nEarlier on August, the Netherlands said it allowed the use of F-16s it donated to Ukraine to be used on Russian territory.\n\n\"We have not imposed any restrictions on the use and range of the F-16s, provided that the laws of war are observed,\" General Onno Eichelsheim, the commander of the Dutch armed forces, told public broadcaster NOS.\n\nSpeaking from the United States, Eichelsheim said his American colleagues \"partly\" agreed with his position. The Netherlands has pledged 24 F-16s to Ukraine, with the first due to arrive soon. Eichelsheim declined to say if any are currently in operation.\n\nSweden's Migration Agency says it will revise asylum applications filed by Belarusian citizens amid criticism that it had made decisions based on erroneous information and ignored an ongoing crackdown on dissent and democratic institutions in Belarus.\n\nSveriges Radio quoted Anna Lindblad of the Migration Agency on August 29 as saying \"we are aware of the information and criticism directed at us.\"\n\nSwedish Migration Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard told RFE/RL in a message sent by her press service that the her ministry \"will conduct a legal review this autumn regarding the handling of cases from asylum seekers from Belarus.\"\n\n\"I will refrain from further comments on the matter until I have reviewed the results,\" the minister said.\n\n\"Questions regarding the Swedish government’s foreign policy is kindly directed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" the minister's response to RFE/RL's query said.\n\nA day earlier, RFE/RL's Belarusian Service reported that a Belarusian man was arrested last week at the Lithuanian-Belarusian border after Swedish authorities rejected his asylum application and deported him to Belarus. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nZmitser Vaserman, who represents a Belarusian group in exile known as the People's Embassy of Belarus, told RFE/RL on August 29 that the Migration Agency's decision to revise Belarusians' asylum applications this autumn was made before the news about the Belarusian man's arrest following his deportation by Sweden broke a day earlier.\n\nAccording to Vaserman, his group revived its talks with the Migration Agency in July after noted Belarusian opposition activist Kanstantsin Syarohin's asylum application was rejected again.\n\n\"[Syarohin's] case confirmed that despite the information on the current situation in Belarus updated in February to properly reflect the reality of mass terror in the country, the Migration Agency continues to support its previously made rulings in courts,\" Vaserman said.\n\nVaserman added that it was important that Sweden update the information but stressed that the process of decision-making on asylum applications filed by Belarusian citizens must be held with a moratorium in place on the deportation of Belarusian citizens. This would prevent the deportation of those whose applications have been denied, he said.\n\nEarlier in August, Vaserman said at the New Belarus conference that more than 100 Belarusians applied for political asylum in Sweden and only three received it. Vaserman said then that many filed appeals against denials, while some moved to other countries to seek asylum there.\n\nFollowing the disputed August 2020 presidential election in Belarus that gave authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka a sixth presidential term, mass pro-democracy demonstrations broke out across the country.\n\nThe demonstrations were brutally suppressed. In the ensuing years, officials have imprisoned hundreds of demonstration participants, often holding leading activists in near-complete isolation and denying many prisoners adequate medical care.\n\nThe Specialized Inter-District Court in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, on August 29 sentenced the already imprisoned ex-wife of a convicted nephew of the Central Asian nation's former authoritarian president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, to 12 years in prison.\n\nGulmira Satybaldy was found guilty of forcibly holding her relative and former business partner Abai Zhunusov in isolation against his will for 165 days in 2019 to force him to give up his stakes in several businesses.\n\nHer former driver Madi Batyrshaev was convicted of assisting to forcibly hold a person in isolation and sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nSatybaldy is concurrently serving two sentences -- eight years for embezzlement and the illegal appropriation of shares and assets of several enterprises, and seven years for abduction and actions aiding the commission of a crime.\n\nThe sentences were handed down by a court in May and June last year.\n\nThe court ruled that Satybaldy must serve the new 12-year sentence concurrently, meaning that the total time to be spent in prison by Satybaldy would be 12 years.\n\nGulmira Satybaldy was arrested along with her ex-husband Qairat Satybaldy in March 2022. He was tried separately in September 2023 and sentenced to six years in prison after being found guilty of fraud and embezzlement.\n\nOn August 16, a court in Kazakhstan's eastern city of Oskemen replaced Qairat Satybaldy's six-year prison sentence with a suspended sentence.\n\nCourt No. 2 in the capital of the East Kazakhstan region ruled on August 16 that Qairat Satybaldy must be released with a suspended 40-month sentence, saying the once powerful businessman and politician had returned all the money he was accused of embezzling to the State Treasury.\n\nThe probes launched against the couple were part of a series of investigations targeting relatives and allies of Nazarbaev following unprecedented anti-government protests that turned into deadly mass disorders in early January 2022.\n\nAfter the deadly events, the Kazakh regime began to quietly target Nazarbaev, his family, and other allies, many of whom held powerful or influential posts in government, security agencies, and profitable energy companies.\n\nWith reporting by Vlast.kz\n\nA court in Moscow has extended the detention and released the names of five more men suspected of being involved in the terror attack at the Crocus City entertainment center that claimed 145 lives near the Russian capital in late March.\n\nThe press service for Moscow's courts of common jurisdiction said on August 29 that the pretrial detention of Shahromjon Gadoev, Zubaidullo Ismoilov, Husein Hamidov, Mustaqim Soliev, and Umedjon Soliev had been extended until at least December 1.\n\nTheir names in the high-profile case had not been made public previously.\n\nThe men are accused of membership in a terrorist organization, preparing and implementing a terrorist attack, illegally possessing firearms, and illegally manufacturing explosive devices.\n\nThe attack at the Crocus City hall took place on March 22, 2024. A group of armed men rushed into the entertainment center where a concert was to be held, opened fire on civilians, and set the building on fire before fleeing.\n\nSome 145 people, including six children, died in the attack, while more than 550 were wounded or injured.\n\nIn May, the chief of the Federal Security Service, Aleksandr Bortnikov, said more than 20 people suspected of involvement into the attack had been detained.\n\nLater, the authorities said 12 men had been arrested in the case.\n\nOn August 16, a Moscow court extended the pretrial detention of four Tajik citizens -- Dalerjon Mirzoev, Saidakram Rajabalizoda, Shamsiddin Fariduni, and Muhammadsobir Faizov, who are suspected of carrying out the attack.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:17 0:00\n\nThree other natives of Tajikistan, all members of one family -- Isroil Islomov, Dilovar Islomov, and Aminjon Islomov, as well as an ethnic Uzbek from Kyrgyzstan and Russian citizen Alisher Kasimov, were arrested for allegedly providing the attackers with accommodation, transportation, and communication.\n\nAn offshoot of the extremist Islamic State group known as Islamic State-Khorasan claimed responsibility for Russia’s worst terrorist attack in two decades.\n\nTajik authorities have officially condemned the treatment of the Tajik suspects amid allegations that the detainees were tortured in custody.\n\nThe Kremlin has insisted without evidence that Ukraine, with the help of the United States, was responsible for the attack. Both Kyiv and Washington have dismissed the accusation.\n\nThe attack was seen as a major failure for Russia's security and intelligence services. The United States has said it gave specific information ahead of time, warning of a possible terrorist attack. Iran also reportedly provided a tip ahead of time.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron began a landmark state visit to Serbia on August 29 with the signing of an agreement on the purchase of 12 Rafale multipurpose fighter jets, which he said represented a shift toward Europe.\n\nShortly after Macron arrived in Belgrade, Serbia signed a contract to purchase the warplanes from France's Dassault Aviation. Under the agreement, Serbia will receive nine single-seat and three two-seat Rafale jets by 2029, according to Dassault chief executive Eric Trappier.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said the deal was worth 2.7 billion euros ($3 billion). Serbia will pay tranches of 420 million euros in 2024 and 2025 for the Rafale jets, he said.\n\nMacron described the agreement as historically significant. The European Union needs a strong and democratic Serbia, he said, and the decision to purchase the fighter jets is a strategic and long-term choice in that direction.\n\n\"I see so many people criticizing Serbia for having partnerships with Russia or China, and now it has a partnership with France. This is truly a major change,\" he said in response to a question posed at a news conference.\n\n\"I respect Serbia's sovereignty and its partnerships with other countries, but this is an opening -- a strategic change that must be emphasized because it takes great courage and is a chance for Europe. This truly shows a European spirit,\" Macron added.\n\nVucic said the purchase doesn't mean that Serbia will change its stance on joining EU sanctions imposed on Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"I know that [Macron] would like us to impose sanctions on Russia...but we have not done it, and we are not ashamed of our decision,\" Vucic said. He added that he didn't feel compelled to justify his decision because he explains his political moves directly to the Serb people.\n\nVucic reiterated Serbia's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, describing it as a \"friendly nation\" and affirming that Belgrade has taken no hostile actions against it.\n\nFollowing the meeting between the two presidents, memorandums and agreements on cooperation between Serbia and France in the fields of energy, defense, ecology, and culture were signed.\n\n\"We have an agreement between our governments and 11 other agreements that enable us to deepen our cooperation, strengthen our ties, and improve our capacities,\" Macron said, noting that cooperation between Serbia and France has been \"increasingly strong\" in recent years.\n\n\"Our economic cooperation has strengthened, we are engaged in long-term infrastructure projects, and our international relations have experienced a new upswing,\" Macron said, adding that France wants Serbia to make progress in its negotiations on joining the European Union.\n\nMacron's two-day visit will include further meetings with Serbia's populist nationalist president, during which they are expected to discuss Belgrade's progress toward integration into the European Union and cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nMacron will also unveil a plaque marking the completion of modernization works at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport; travel to Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, to visit the Gallery of Matica Srpska, one of the largest and oldest art galleries in Serbia; and give a speech at the Forum on Youth and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nMacron's speech at the forum is seen as recognition of Serbia's progress in the burgeoning AI industry.\n\n\"Serbia's international credibility in the field of AI was recognized through its successful candidacy for the presidency of the Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence 2025,\" the French Embassy told RFE/RL on August 29. The Global Partnership for Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) is an international initiative founded in 2020.\n\nThe Elysee Palace previously announced that Macron will confirm his support for Serbia's EU integration and that his visit will be an opportunity to talk with Vucic about the economy, health care, energy, culture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nMacron's visit comes less than five months after he hosted the Serbian president in Paris. It will be the second visit of the French president to Serbia in the last five years, following the strengthening of relations between the two countries.\n\nSerbia, which has been a candidate for membership in the European Union since 2012, has irritated the European Union by maintaining ties with Russia during its war of aggression against Ukraine and by refusing to impose sanctions on Moscow over its war.\n\nThe European Union told Serbia on August 15 that this behavior is not compatible with EU values and the accession process. Brussels also said the EU \"wants to count on all candidate countries as reliable European partners for common principles, values, security, and prosperity.\"\n\nThe reaction followed meetings between Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Kremlin officials in Moscow along with claims of intelligence cooperation with Russia.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Vulin repeated that he is proud that Serbia is \"not part of the anti-Russian hysteria\" and has not joined the Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee said on August 29 that it has launched a probe on fraud charges against former Deputy Defense Minister Pavel Popov, part of an ongoing campaign against top military officials.\n\nThe Investigative Committee added that Popov, who is a general in the Russian Army, was detained.*\n\nPopov, who was sacked from the post in June after serving 11 years as a deputy defense minister, is suspected of illegal enrichment via fraudulent activities linked to his supervision of the operations of the Defense Ministry's Patriot Park near Moscow in 2021-24.\n\nInvestigators say Popov carried out his alleged illegal activities along with Patriot Park Director Vyacheslav Akhmedov and the deputy chief of the Defense Ministry's Department for Innovative Development, Major General Vladimir Shesterov.\n\nSubscribe To RFE/RL's 'The Rundown'\n\nGet a curated digest of all our essential news, features, and analysis, plus our best visual journalism, in your inbox every day.

It includes military museums, a site for the reconstruction of historic battles, and the military's main Russian Orthodox cathedral, the Cathedral of Christ's Resurrection.\n\nSome media reports said the construction and development of the park was supervised by Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov.\n\nIvanov, who holds the rank of major general, was arrested in April on bribe-taking charges. He pleaded not guilty. Shortly after his arrest, two businessmen -- Sergei Borodin and Aleksandr Fomin -- were also arrested in the case.\n\nIn mid-May, the chief of the Defense Ministry's Main Human Resources Department, Lieutenant General Yury Kuznetsov, was also arrested on bribe-taking charges.\n\nOn May 21, Major General Ivan Popov (no relation to Pavel Popov), the former commander of Russia's 58th Army who once complained about his forces' lack of support from Moscow, was arrested on fraud charges. Last month, he was transferred to house arrest.\n\nOn May 22, a Moscow court sent to pretrial detention the deputy chief of the armed forces' General Staff, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, on bribery charges.\n\nAlso in May, investigators arrested Vladimir Verteletsky, a top official of the Defense Ministry's Department for Handling Armament Orders, on a charge of abuse of power.\n\nLast month, Russian officials confirmed the sudden death of Ivanov's direct subordinate, Magomed Khandayev, in June.\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this story identified Popov as a former defense minister. He was a deputy defense minister.\n\nEthnic Germans from the former Soviet Union have held their first international \"memory marathon\" to raise awareness of the deportation and persecution of the group under brutal dictator Josef Stalin and through into post-Soviet Russia.\n\nThe chairman of the Association of Ethnic Germans of Ukraine Vyacheslav Bodrov (aka Redekopp) told RFE/RL that the event, which began on August 26 and ended on August 28, was held in Germany, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the United States.\n\n\"This is the first [international] event held by ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet space to express solidarity in different countries and attract attention to the big problem,\" he said of the single largest and one of the oldest diaspora groups in the former Soviet Union that is connected to a foreign state.\n\n\"Through the marathon, we remind about the suffering of the German minority in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia, and also focus on the destinies of the successors of those who survived the deportation,\" Bodrov added.\n\nSubscribe To RFE/RL's 'The Rundown'\n\nGet a curated digest of all our essential news, features, and analysis, plus our best visual journalism, in your inbox every day.

German authorities responsible for solving problems faced by ethnic Germans in post-Soviet countries report that there are no problems. But it is a big problem to enter Germany for ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet states because of German law,\" Bodrov added.\n\nAs part of raising awareness over the situation, ethnic Germans held pickets in front of the German Consulate in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty; the UN Office in Bonn; the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in Strasbourg; Amnesty International's headquarters in Dusseldorf; the Federal Administrative Office in Cologne; the White House in Washington; and in several U.S. cities.\n\nAt least one single-person picket was held in Russia.\n\nThe picketers held placards with slogans saying: \"Kremlin Sends Russia's Germans to Die,\" \"80 Years of Assimilation and Ethnocide,\" \"Save German Minority in the Former Soviet Union,\" and \"Russia's Germans Are Hostages Of Russian-German Business.\"\n\nBodrov said he and his organizations have sent letters of awareness to several European institutions, urging them to help ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet space obtain refugee status in Germany and other European nations.\n\n\"Germany and Russia have been unable to solve the problem of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union in the last 30 years. It means the problem is now international,\" Bodrov said.\n\nEthnic Germans in the post-Soviet space are successors of Germans invited to the Russian Empire in the 18th century by Russian empress Catherine the Great, who was German herself.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, shortly after Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Soviet authorities dissolved the German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the Volga area and deported at least 400,000 ethnic Germans to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Siberia.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early '90s, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans emigrated from the former Soviet Union, mostly from Kazakhstan, to Germany.\n\nHuman rights groups and media reports have said that since Russia started its invasion against Ukraine, Moscow has been mostly recruiting representatives of ethnic minorities to the war.\n\nKYIV -- Ukraine on August 29 commemorated those who have fallen defending the country's independence as Russia unleashed fresh strikes on Kyiv and across the country.\n\nUkraine's air defenses shot down more than 10 Russian drones over Kyiv in the third large-scale attack on the Ukrainian capital in four days, the city's administration reported.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

This time, they used exclusively attack UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),\" Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said on Telegram, adding that the attack came from the occupied part of Ukraine's Kherson region and from Russia's Kursk region.\n\nPopko said drone debris ignited a fire that was put out by firefighters and added that there were no immediate reports of casualties or material damage.\n\nThe latest attacks on Ukraine came as Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with the EU foreign ministers in Brussels and urged them to expedite deliveries of promised air defense systems.\n\n\"I conveyed a sense of urgency regarding the delivery of already pledged military aid, including air defense systems,\" Kuleba said on X on August 29 as Ukraine marked the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine.\n\nThe holiday marked the 10th anniversary of the battle of Ilovaisk, in the Donetsk region, when hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were killed by Russian troops on August 24, 2014, as they began to withdraw from the Russia-encircled town, despite the Russian military giving assurances that the withdrawal would be allowed to proceed peacefully.\n\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said the holiday serves as a perpetual warning about what he called the treachery of the Russian aggressor.\n\n\"Ilovaisk is not only a tragic event in the history of Ukraine but also a page of Ukrainian indomitability. It is an act and feat of the Ukrainian military. Let's remember that despite the loss and deception of the enemy, our soldiers did not give up but kept attempting to break out of the trap and fight,\" Syrskiy said in a message on Telegram.\n\n\"This day will always remind us of the treachery of the Russian aggressor [and will remind us] that any negotiations with terrorists and murderers are a mortally dangerous business, and that they cannot be trusted,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's General Staff on August 29 confirmed that it was behind three drone strikes the previous day that targeted Russian oil depots and an ammunition storage facility.\n\nThe General Staff said that the strike on the oil depot in the Kamensky district of Russia's Rostov region was carried out by units of the Special Operations Forces of the military and the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) in cooperation with other branches of Ukraine's defense forces.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for a strike on the Zenit oil depot in the Kirov region, some 1,500 kilometers northeast of the Ukrainian border, and one on the ammunition depot of the artillery group Zapad in Russia's Voronezh region.\n\nIn Russia's Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on August 29 that one person had been killed and two wounded by Ukrainian strikes.\n\nGladkov said on Telegram that \"the town of Shebekino was targeted by Ukrainian forces\" and \"unfortunately, one person was killed.\"\n\nUkraine has not commented on the claim, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe Romanian government on August 28 approved the start of negotiations with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the purchase of a major stake in Moldova's Danube River port of Giurgiulesti.\n\nThe port, located near Moldova's borders with Romania and Ukraine, is 134 kilometers from the Black Sea and can be accessed by river and sea vessels.\n\nTwo different port infrastructure entities operate in Giurgiulesti -- Giurgiulesti State Port and Giurgiulesti International Free Port. The Moldovan government said on August 28 that it does not intend to sell the state port.\n\nThe negotiations will take place with the operator of the Giurgiulesti International Free Port, Danube Logistics SRL, which was acquired by the EBRD in 2021.\n\nThe Romanian government approved a memorandum to form a negotiation commission and begin talks with the EBRD to acquire Danube Logistics SRL. The purchase would be made through a company controlled by the Romanian state through the Transport Ministry.\n\n\"The Romanian state has expressed interest to buy the shares given competition between Constanta port and the other Black Sea ports and those of other EU states, as well as the expansion of Constanta port and its transformation into a market leader for central and southeast Europe,\" the memorandum said.\n\nA Moldovan government spokesperson said EBRD is negotiating with several potential investors, including from Romania, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\n\nThe Romanian government did not specify when it expected negotiations to take place or how much it was willing to pay, but it appears to be under pressure to start negotiations because the Bulgarian company MBF Port Burgas has already shown interest in Giurgiulesti.\n\nMBF Port Burgas operates two terminals in the Port of Burgas in southern Bulgaria and is part of Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar). Until 2008, Navibulgar was the largest shipping company owned by the government in Sofia.\n\nAfter the privatization, Navibulgar ended up in the portfolio of billionaire brothers Kiril Domuschiev and Georgi Petrov Domuschiev, who are close to former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.\n\nRFE/RL contacted MBF Port Burgas for comment but didn't receive a response.\n\nAn EBRD official confirmed to RFE/RL that the bank wants to sell its stake in the port of Giurgiulesti and is interested in making the process transparent.\n\n\"EBRD wants to find a reputable buyer for the port. We are often approached by various interested buyers, but we are currently focusing on working with the government of the Republic of Moldova to pave the way for a transparent sale process,\" the EBRD official said.\n\nRomania's main Black Sea port of Constanta has seen an influx of investment, including EU funds to increase its capacity, since becoming Ukraine's biggest alternative grain export route following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nAccording to the memorandum, taking into account the competition between the Port of Constanta and the other ports of the Black Sea basin and of the EU member states, the purchase of Giurgiulesti International Free Port would help to expand the port of Constanta and transform it into a market leader for Central and Southeastern Europe.\n\nThe Romanian state's interest in the port was announced last year by Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.\n\nThrough this investment, Romania will become one of the most important international hubs for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the end of the war, he said at the time.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nIt is \"positive news\" that French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Serbia, said the head of the Delegation of the European Union, Emanuele Giaufret, in Belgrade on August 28, assessing the visit as an important step in Serbia’s path to the European Union.\n\nThe two-day visit, set to begin on August 29, will include a meeting between Macron and President Aleksandar Vucic and is also expected to see the signing of an armament deal to sell French fighter jets to Serbia.\n\nAlong with the signing, Macron will unveil a plaque marking the completion of modernization works at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, visit the Matica Srpska Gallery in Novi Sad, and give a speech at the Forum on Youth and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"It is part of the engagement of the member countries working to strengthen bilateral relations with Serbia, and it is also important in the context of Serbia's European path,\" Giaufret told reporters at a school exchange program event in Belgrade, Beta agency reported.\n\nThe Elysee Palace previously announced that Macron will confirm his support for Serbia's European integration and that his visit will be an opportunity to talk with Vucic about the economy, health care, energy, culture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nMacron's visit comes less than five months after he hosted the Serbian president in Paris.

Other administrative buildings, shops, and civil infrastructure were also damaged, Synyehubov said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the air strike on Kupyansk had resulted in several deaths but didn't say how many. He also again urged Western leaders to allow Ukraine to use the weapons their countries have provided for long-range strikes against Russian targets.\n\nZelenskiy in his evening video message said the situation in Pokrovsk and other areas in Donetsk region was \"extremely difficult.\"\n\n\"The key Russian efforts and the largest forces are concentrated there, and the stability of each of our units, our ability to destroy the occupier, is very important now,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nIn Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhya, a Russian drone attack killed three people -- two women and a man -- the region's Governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\n\"Two women aged 83 and 86 and a 61-year-old man died, three more women aged 19, 30, 56, and a 59-year-old man were wounded as a result of a Russian drone attack,\" Fedorov said.\n\nKryviy Rih, in the southern region Dnipropetrovsk region, was again targeted on August 28 by a Russian missile strike that wounded three people, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, a day after another Russian Iskander missile hit a hotel in the city, killing four people.\n\nLysak said infrastructure and cars also sustained damage in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported Ukrainian drone strikes on three regions of Russia, including a first attack on a remote Russian region.\n\nUkraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been battered by relentless Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, has in turn resorted in recent months to targeting oil and fuel installations inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nThe governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, confirmed reports on Russian Telegram channels of a fire at an oil depot in the Kamensky district.\n\nA strong explosion occurred before the fire broke out at the depot located close to the village of Molodezhny, reports on Telegram said.\n\n\"In the Kamensky district, as a result of a drone attack, a fire broke out at a fuel depot. There are no casualties. Emergency response forces are involved in the extinguishing the blaze. There is no threat of fire spreading to residential buildings,\" Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nGolubev said earlier that four drones had been shot down by Russian air defense systems above his region.\n\nBaza, a Telegram channel with close ties to Russia's security services, said debris from two drones ignited a fire at three storage tanks in the Kamensky district.\n\nVideos posted on Telegram purported to show what appeared to be large fuel tanks burning in the dark.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the information, which could not be independently confirmed immediately.\n\nIn another Rostov district, Proletarsk, fuel tanks were reportedly still on fire some 10 days after they were hit by Ukrainian drones.\n\nIn the southwestern Voronezh region, Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported a fire \"near explosive objects,\" likely an ammunition depot.\n\nHe said there were no casualties among civilians, but the residents of two nearby villages had been temporarily evacuated by bus as a precaution before being returned to their homes.\n\nSuspected Ukrainian drones also attacked the Kirov region, some 1,500 kilometers northeast of Ukraine's border. The drones targeted an oil storage facility in the regional city of Kotelnich.\n\nKirov Governor Aleksandr Sokolov reported that there were no casualties as a result of the attack and no fire ensued. According to him, \"the situation is under control.\"\n\nThe government in Russia's Kursk region said on August 28 that it would introduce additional security measures in the Kurchatov district and at the Kursk nuclear plant from August 29.\n\nAleksei Smirnov, governor of the Kursk region, said entry to the town of Kurchatov, where the plant is located, would be temporarily restricted.\n\nUkrainian forces began an incursion into the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has taken place within about 40 kilometers of the nuclear facility.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it had shot down a Russian Su-25 plane in Kramatorsk, in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"In the direction of Kramatorsk, our military shot down a Russian Su-25 aircraft that was trying to fire at the positions of units of the Defense Forces. Antiaircraft forces employed \"a well-aimed shot from a MANPADS system,\" to destroy the plane, the military said in a statement.\n\nMANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) are lightweight and highly mobile antiaircraft weapons.\n\nNATO members meeting in Brussels on August 28 reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen Ukraine's defenses.\n\n\"Ukraine continues to intercept Russian missiles on a daily basis, saving countless lives. But Ukraine's ability to maintain their defenses requires increased supply and more support,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\n\"In the wake of the latest Russian assault, Allies today reaffirmed they are stepping up their military aid to Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We must continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions it needs to defend itself against Russia’s invasion. This is vital for Ukraine’s ability to stay in the fight.\"\n\nTelegram chief Pavel Durov has been indicted on charges of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app and placed under judicial supervision, the Paris prosecutor's office said on August 28.\n\nDurov is required to report to the police station twice a week and is prohibited from leaving France, the prosecutor's office said in a statement posted on X. Investigative judges in Paris also ordered the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of Telegram to pay 5 million euros bail.\n\nDurov was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. According to French media reports, this was done at the request of a special unit within France's Interior Ministry in charge of investigating crimes against minors.\n\nThe allegations against Durov include that his platform is being used for child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking, and that Telegram refused to share information or documents with investigators as required by law.\n\nThe first preliminary charge against him is for \"complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group,'' a crime that can lead to sentences of up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine, the prosecutor's office said.\n\nPreliminary charges under French law mean magistrates have strong reason to believe a crime was committed but allow more time for further investigation.\n\nTelegram said in a statement on August 25 that Durov had nothing to hide, adding it was absurd to hold an owner responsible for the abuse of the messaging and social media platform.\n\nHis lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, echoed that statement after the preliminary charges were announced on August 28.\n\n\"It is totally absurd to think that the head of a social network...could be involved in criminal acts\" that could be committed on the messaging service, Kaminski said, adding that Telegram \"complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology.\"\n\nIn addition to Russian and French citizenships, Durov holds passports from the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis.\n\nThe U.A.E. Foreign Ministry said it was \"closely following the case\" and had asked France to provide Durov \"with all the necessary consular services in an urgent manner.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were \"very serious\" and that \"they require evidence that is just as serious\" to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,\" Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France is \"deeply committed\" to freedom of expression but that \"freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.\"\n\nTelegram was founded by Durov and his brother in 2013 in the wake of the Russian government's crackdown after mass pro-democracy protests that rocked Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nOne of its main advantages is the encryption of communications and the anonymity of users. In groups, the user's phone number is not visible.\n\nIn his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nTelegram, based in Dubai, boasts more than 900 million users, the majority of them in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, and is the third-largest communication platform worldwide after WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut Telegram has proved to be a powerful tool in spreading disinformation. A 2023 investigative journalism report found it to be the largest platform for disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2022 it ran it afoul of authorities in Germany, who issued fines of 5.1 million euros ($5 million) against the operators of Telegram for failing to comply with German law."
