Fujitsu Relay Computer and Historic Museum Tour

The Linux Foundation would like to offer a chance to visit the Fujitsu Relay Computer and Historic Museum, exclusive to Open Source Summit Japan attendees!

At the Fujitsu Relay Computer and Historic Museum, attendees can see and learn about past generation computers and their history. One of the must-see items is the oldest Relay Computer in the world that is still functioning! It was built nearly 60 years ago and is certified as an Information Processing Technology Heritage.

Here is a little trivia! Did you know the word CORE used in Unix is derived from the word FERRITE CORE? These really small (1.78 mm in diameter) donut shaped cores were used in memories to store information. This, and many more fun facts can be learned on this tour!

English speaking staff will guide attendees through the facility and provide lots of information for the maximum educational experience! After the museum tour, the group will have lunch at an authentic Japanese restaurant in Numazu.

The Fujitsu Relay Computer and Historic Museum is located in Numazu in the Shizuoka Prefecture. It is about 2.5 hours away from the Hilton Tokyo Odaiba. Transportation is included in the tour fee.

Please note, pre-registration for this event is required and on a first come, first serve basis. Don't delay! Registration for this tour will close on May 22, 2017.
