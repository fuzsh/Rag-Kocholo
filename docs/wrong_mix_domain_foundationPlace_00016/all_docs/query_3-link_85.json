        "text": "“[11:11 Systems] is responsive in a very flexible way, and it’s a big benefit to us. It makes them a better business partner and frees us up to innovate in other ways.”\n\n“When they say ‘managed service’, [11:11] means managing the whole process, from top to bottom. Don’t let the procurement process keep you from pursuing greater capability in risk management. This kind of expertise and capability is reasonable from a risk adjusted perspective, and well worth it.”\n\n“We evaluated other cloud service providers, but they simply couldn’t meet our needs for global availability and compliance. It’s clear that 11:11 is recognized as an industry leader for a reason.”\n\n“From the beginning, it was our goal to ensure that all of our mission-critical applications would be securely stored offsite in case of a major disaster. We ended up doing a pretty thorough market analysis, which is where 11:11 Systems entered the picture.”\n\n“We are where we are thanks to the technology and, perhaps most importantly, the people over at [11:11 Systems]. There’s a lot that has to happen in the wake of an attack like this. It’s a tough time. But the [11:11] support team immediately answered our call and we were in a position to recover with just the click of a button.”\n\n“[11:11] just blows everyone away. I don’t know what they do, but there’s some sort of magic going on in the background that keeps costs down and the quality up. From my point of view, [11:11] Cloud Backup met all the criteria we had in mind for an enterprise-level, scalable solution.”\n\n“We haven’t had anything go wrong since we’ve been with 11:11 and AWS. We haven’t had a single outage. It runs 24x7x365 without issues. Our SLA has been kept 100 percent. That reliability has absolutely been our number one benefit since beginning\n\nour partnership.”"
