        "text": "oUr pArtnerS <strong>UC</strong> SANTA CRUZ A progress report on philanthropy <strong>of</strong> the <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong> Foundation, 2007–08 What a difference a year makes Entering my second year as president, I’m as<strong>to</strong>unded by the differences a year can make. Most notably, we saw the inauguration <strong>of</strong> Chancellor George Blumenthal, who honored <strong>UC</strong>SC’s founders by reminding us that we were <strong>to</strong> become a “campus for the next century”—a campus <strong>of</strong> brilliant scholars dedicated <strong>to</strong> educating <strong>to</strong>morrow’s leaders and breaking new ground in their chosen research fields. It is gratifying <strong>to</strong> see faculty, students, and staff embarking on bold programs <strong>to</strong> build the world’s largest telescope, protect coastal and marine communities, bring health services <strong>to</strong> underserved populations, and develop s<strong>to</strong>rage technology <strong>to</strong> securely house increasingly complex data sets. True <strong>to</strong> the founders’ vision, the continuing emphasis on undergraduate education leads <strong>to</strong> a disproportionately high percentage <strong>of</strong> alumni who pursue graduate and pr<strong>of</strong>essional degrees (not <strong>to</strong> mention, the receipt <strong>of</strong> Pulitzer, MacArthur, and countless other awards). These achievements, however, would not have been possible without your support. Gifts <strong>to</strong> the campus increased 25 percent last year, and the Foundation is rapidly mobilizing itself <strong>to</strong> launch even more ambitious efforts in the coming years. Supporting <strong>UC</strong>SC’s unique brand <strong>of</strong> scholarship is testimony <strong>to</strong> your commitment and passion for seeking excellence amidst the beauty <strong>of</strong> the redwoods on the hill. On behalf <strong>of</strong> the Board, I cannot thank you enough for your dedication and support. What can we do <strong>to</strong>gether <strong>to</strong> make next year even better? Gordon Ringold president, <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong> Foundation 1"
