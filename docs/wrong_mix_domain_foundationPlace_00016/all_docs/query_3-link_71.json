        "text": "Designed to Foster Interaction\n\nThe Gates Building is named for Bill Gates, co-founder and CEO of Microsoft Corp., who gave a $6 million gift to the project. It was completed in January 1996 and is the home of the Computer Science Department. The 150,000-square-foot building houses 550 faculty, staff, and students and cost $38M to build and furnish. Robert A. M. Stern Associates of New York and Fong and Chan of San Francisco were the architects, selected following an invited national competition. Rudolph & Sletten of Foster City was the general contractor. There were 47 subcontractors working over a 16-month period.\n\nThe Gates Building was designed to promote interaction.\n\nThe Gates Building offers two new state-of-the-art classrooms which are equipped with computer presentation tools and equipment, large screen projectors, and accommodation for multiple computer platforms.\n\nA coalition of Stanford computer scientists and the Computer History Museum has installed exhibits within the Gates Computer Science building containing historical equipment and documents focusing on Stanford's role in the history of computing. The exhibits are being changed and updated as time permits. The first exhibit, installed November 1997, focuses on the early history of the Stanford Computer Science Department and its founder, George Forsythe."
