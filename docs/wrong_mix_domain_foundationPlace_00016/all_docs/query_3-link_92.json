        "text": "Before 2017, Helsinki had more than 30 independent agencies. ICT was fragmented across over 900 information systems and dozens of different networks, with vast quantities of data in silos, and many duplicated and legacy systems. Centralizing the city wide infrastructure and basic IT services needed a complete reform of Helsinki’s digital base – as well as partners who understood the priorities and values of the city.\n\nMikko Rusama, Chief Digital Officer at the City of Helsinki, and his team see digitalization as the key to their ambitious goals for the city. As he explains: “an anti-fragile city is able to use digital technologies to anticipate and predict different crises and also adapt to changing situations quickly.”\n\nHelsinki is developing enhanced data capabilities, to identify different life situations and deliver proactive services and information, and to stimulate business activity and growth. This will support the development of new services to effortlessly anticipate and meet the particular needs of the residents, and enable the city to see and deal with problems before they happen. As people feel more connected and involved, the city and all who live in it will see greater advances in prosperity, education, health, and sustainability.\n\nFujitsu is built around connecting people, technology and ideas, so working with the City of Helsinki team was an ideal fit for their vision. When the Digitalization Program was set up in 2019, Fujitsu was a core partner in giving Helsinki the solid digital foundations it needed to build its future on. This created a new kind of service organization, with centralized information security, infrastructure and network services, as well as common IT support for all the city’s businesses and industries.\n\n“Basic infrastructure and IT services are like our water and electricity. Fujitsu is helping us to fix our digital plumbing, improving our telecommunications, cyber-security capacity, and support services.” – Mikko Rusama\n\nThe lives of Helsinki’s citizens and employees are already being made easier. Parents are offered a proactive pre-school placement for their children through text-message or email that they can immediately accept. A healthcare chatbot gives advice and support 24/7. Residents can vote on new ideas for improving the city. And the public can see and use all the open data from the Helsinki metropolitan area in a standard format, at no cost.\n\nThis is just the start. From 2023, Fujitsu will also partner DigiHelsinki Oy, the city’s new ICT-infrastructure and basic IT service company - to provide a solid digital foundation on top of which innovative, proactive and preventative services can be developed.\n\nFor example, giving user support services to all the city’s personnel and monitor Data Security threats 24/7.\n\nWorking with Fujitsu, the City of Helsinki is showing how digitalization can help our cities be connected at a more human level."
