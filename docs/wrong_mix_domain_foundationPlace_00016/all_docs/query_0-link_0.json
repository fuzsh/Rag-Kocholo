        "text": "July 12 is the end of an era in my life. After nearly six years of working at Fujitsu Research of America, it is time for me to hand over my badge. It is hard for me to express in words the positive impact Fujitsu has had on my life. Back in 2010 I had a wonderful eight-month internship at Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd. in Kawasaki, Japan. It was my introduction to Fujitsu and to life in Japan. I worked on a very interesting project, met many wonderful people who would become lifelong friends, and fell in love with Japan. In 2018 I returned to Fujitsu, this time at the Silicon Valley research lab. In Silicon Valley I experienced the same kindness and camaraderie that I experienced in Kawasaki. When I visited the old Kawasaki lab in Fall 2019 for a business trip, it felt like a homecoming. One of the best parts of working at Fujitsu, no matter the location, is Fujitsu's professionalism, strong sense of ethics, and its promotion of camaraderie among colleagues. Alongside Fujitsu's technological achievements, these qualities make Fujitsu stand out in a highly competitive tech landscape. Since I was a high school student, one of my dreams has been to become a professor. I have long been passionate about teaching and mentoring students. I am pleased to announce that beginning on August 19, I will become a full-time tenure-track instructor of computer science at Ohlone College in Fremont, CA. I am very excited to have the opportunity to teach introductory computer science to freshman- and sophomore-level undergraduates, and I will apply the skills and wisdom that I learned throughout my career to be an effective professor. Even though I will be leaving Fujitsu, my memories of working at Fujitsu will not leave me. I had a wonderful time working at Fujitsu; it is truly a great company! This is not \"sayonara,\" but this is \"mata aimashou!\" Until we meet again, Fujitsu!\n\nThis week I officially begin my volunteer role as an industry mentor for the LINXS program run by Stanford's computer science department. LINXS is an undergraduate research program for students attending historically black colleges and universities. Students will spend eight weeks at Stanford working on research projects supervised by a Stanford professor. This is an excellent opportunity for these students to gain research experience at one of the top computer science departments in the world. Undergraduate research was a life-changing experience for me. 16 years ago I participated in a National Science Foundation-funded undergraduate research program at UC Santa Cruz called SURF-IT, where I worked at the university's computer storage lab and did an interesting project on non-hierarchical file systems. This opened up many doors in my life, including my career at Fujitsu (both my 2010 internship in Kawasaki, Japan and my full-time role in Silicon Valley) and admission to UC Santa Cruz for graduate school. Being an industry mentor for LINXS is an opportunity for me to give back and to hopefully be a good influence on a young researcher starting out.\n\nIf you're an undergrad who is part of an underrepresented minority group and who is interested in doing research this summer in machine learning, I recommend applying to this program hosted at the University of Kentucky and is organized by Professor Corey Baker, Ph.D.. The deadline is April 15, so please apply soon! Please pass this along if you know students who are interested! Participating in summer research activities like this can lead to life-changing results. During my undergraduate career I spent two summers participating in UC Santa Cruz's SURF-IT program, a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates site. These summers at UCSC opened up many opportunities for me, including an eight-month internship with Fujitsu in Japan and grad school at UCSC. I now work as a Member of Research Staff at Fujitsu Research of America, and I don't know if I would have this opportunity today if it weren't for my two summers at SURF-IT.\n\nTwelve years ago, one of my lifelong dreams was realized. After ten years of studying the Japanese language and culture, I finally went to Japan for my first time on January 11, 2010. I was an intern at Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd. in Kawasaki, Japan from January to August 2010. It was an amazing opportunity and was one of the best experiences I had in my life. I made wonderful lifelong friends inside and outside the company, was mentored by excellent colleagues, learned a lot about the Japanese work culture, and experienced the camaraderie that makes Fujitsu special. Both Fujitsu and Japan have a special place in my life. To this day, every time I visit Japan (which I've had the privilege of doing six more times since 2010), I visit the friends I made in 2010. Also, in September 2018, I returned to Fujitsu Labs (now Fujitsu Research) and started work at the Silicon Valley location in Sunnyvale. Of all the companies I've worked for, I have a particular fondness for Fujitsu. I am looking forward to making more contributions at Fujitsu, and I'm also looking forward to more trips to Japan once the country reopens to tourism!"
