        "text": "oUr pArtnerS <strong>UC</strong> SANTA CRUZ A progress report on philanthropy <strong>of</strong> the <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong> Foundation, 2008–09 A message from the President For over 140 years, the <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>California</strong> has given more than one million <strong>California</strong>ns the opportunity <strong>to</strong> contribute <strong>to</strong> the wealth and quality <strong>of</strong> life in our Golden State. Current financial hurdles facing the state <strong>of</strong> <strong>California</strong> challenge the <strong>UC</strong> system <strong>to</strong> provide affordable access <strong>to</strong> this internationally recognized standard <strong>of</strong> public higher education. Reductions in state support over the past decade—especially severe in recent years—have put the long-term beneficial relationship between <strong>UC</strong> and the people <strong>of</strong> <strong>California</strong> at risk. Private philanthropy has nurtured opportunity at <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong> from the start, and this year has been no different. The outpouring <strong>of</strong> support from alumni, parents, staff and faculty, and our community friends has strengthened this uncommon place. Together we are building a new state-<strong>of</strong>-the-art library, uncovering the secrets <strong>of</strong> the universe and the human genome, creating new methods for communicating important ideas, and making a college education a reality for an increasing number <strong>of</strong> talented students with financial need. Your support has allowed <strong>UC</strong>SC <strong>to</strong> provide the same opportunities for <strong>to</strong>day’s students that I experienced as an undergraduate. Your generosity allows <strong>UC</strong>SC <strong>to</strong> accomplish its mission <strong>of</strong> academic excellence. Thank you again for your support <strong>of</strong> <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong>. Gary D. Novack, Ph.D. president, <strong>UC</strong> <strong>Santa</strong> <strong>Cruz</strong> Foundation"
