        "text": "Fujitsu and Delft University of Technology today announced the establishment of the Fujitsu Advanced Computing Lab Delft at Delft University of Technology, an industry-academia collaboration hub dedicated to the development of quantum computing technologies. The new collaboration hub will be positioned as part of the Fujitsu Small Research Lab initiative, which dispatches Fujitsu researchers to technology incubators at leading global universities to conduct joint research with some of the top researchers in their fields, including professors as well as the next generation of innovators.\n\nThe Advanced Computing Lab will be established at world-leading quantum technology research institute QuTech – a collaboration between Delft University of Technology and the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) – and aims to accelerate R&D of diamond-spin quantum computing, a technology that Fujitsu and Delft University of Technology have been jointly researching since October 2020.\n\nVivek Mahajan, SEVP, CTO and CPO, Fujitsu Limited, comments:\n\n“Strengthening our collaboration with Delft University of Technology offers a chance to unlock new possibilities in quantum. With Fujitsu’s top-class technologies and talented researchers from one of world’s leading institutions in this exciting field, we can further work toward potential breakthroughs in quantum hardware development, while nurturing a new generation of innovators.”\n\nProf. Tim van der Hagen, Rector Magnificus/President of the Executive Board at Delft University of Technology, comments:\n\n“At Delft University of Technology, we develop and deliver technology-driven, innovative solutions to societal problems and explore potential applications of quantum computers in a broad range of fields. TU Delft is the ideal place for industry and science to collaborate on advancing this key technology. We are very proud that Fujitsu, building on their already successful collaboration with QuTech, has chosen the Netherlands and Delft to establish their Advanced Computing Lab.”\n\nDr. Shintaro Sato, Fellow SVP & Head of Quantum Laboratory at Fujitsu Research, Fujitsu Limited, comments:\n\n“We have been working closely with Delft University of Technology on diamond spin qubit technology for the past three years—I am proud of what we have achieved together so far, and I am confident that this new lab will form the foundation for fruitful future collaboration. We are excited to extend this collaboration deeper into the field of quantum applications, and hopefully produce results that surprise the world.”\n\nKees Eijkel, Director of Business Development at QuTech, Delft University of Technology, comments:\n\n“At QuTech we build scalable technologies for Quantum Computing and a Quantum Internet. We value our strategic partnership with Fujitsu in Quantum Computing. It is a partnership that is founded on our complementary strengths and a shared vision for economic impact. We are very proud that Fujitsu has chosen Delft, with its exceptional concentration of quantum talent, as the location for the Advanced Computing Lab. We are excited about the prospect of extending our already deep and significant collaboration to additional opportunities that Delft presents.”\n\nCollaboration to focus on diamond-spin quantum technology\n\nAs part of efforts to strengthen collaboration with cutting-edge research institutions through global open innovation, Fujitsu has been conducting basic research and development into quantum computers using diamond-based spin qubits with TU Delft.\n\nFTQC:\n\nAbbreviation for fault-tolerant quantum computation; performance of quantum computation without errors while correcting quantum errors\n\nAbout Fujitsu\n\nFujitsu’s purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. As the digital transformation partner of choice for customers in over 100 countries, our 124,000 employees work to resolve some of the greatest challenges facing humanity.
