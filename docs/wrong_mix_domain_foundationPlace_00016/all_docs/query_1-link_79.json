The site consists of managed lawn gardens, tea plantations, a natural biotope, as well as natural woodland and other green spaces to continuously maintain the natural environment. Fujitsu further opened up a wide area of the site to local residents as a place for leisure. Fujitsu also holds seasonal events, including a tea harvest festival and a nature experience walking event, and leverages the green spaces to promote community exchange in the region. Fujitsu is further actively engaged in biodiversity conservation, including weeding by grazing goats, removal of certain harmful invasive species, and cultivation of the ancient \"Japanese rice fish\" species in biotopes. Fujitsu’s Numazu Plant has been certified as a “Shizen Kyosei Site” in recognition of its continued greening efforts.\n\nFujitsu will continue to promote activities to contribute to the achievement of the “Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework” (4), an international agreement to protect biodiversity to realize nature positivity. In addition, Fujitsu will implement disclosure in line with the TNFD (5) framework.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n\nRelated Links\n\nFujitsu - Living in Harmony with Nature (Conservation of Biodiversity)“Vision and Short- to Mid-term Targets”\n\nFujitsu - Living in Harmony with Nature (Conservation of Biodiversity)\"Management Approach\"\n\nFujitsu’s Numazu Plant awarded with Japanese Prime Minister's Award for achievement of greening promotion in 2023 (Press Release, April 17, 2023) (in Japanese)\n\nFujitsu’s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nAbout Fujitsu\n\nFujitsu’s purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.
