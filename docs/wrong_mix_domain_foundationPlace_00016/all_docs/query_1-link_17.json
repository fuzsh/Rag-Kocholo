        "text": "Fujitsu Limited\n\nKawasaki, June 17, 2024\n\nFujitsu Limited today announced that it has expanded the investment scope of the Corporate Venture Capital (CVC) fund managed by Fujitsu Ventures Limited to begin impact investing, in which Fujitsu will invest in companies that are taking on the challenge of solving social issues.\n\nImpact investing is investing with the aim of simultaneously generating both economic returns and a measurable positive impact on society and the environment. Fujitsu, through impact investing, will support a wide range of companies that are addressing the challenge to solve social issues in areas that are not limited to Fujitsu’s direct business areas, but will also contribute to achieving a sustainable society.\n\nIn May 2024, for its first impact investment, Fujitsu invested into Gojo & Company, Inc., which provides financial services, such as microfinance (1), to low-income households in developing countries.\n\nOverview of the impact investing\n\nThe CVC fund established by Fujitsu in April 2021 and managed by Fujitsu Ventures has contributed to solving social issues through its business activities by investing in startups that collaborate with Fujitsu both in and outside of Japan.\n\nIn addition, in May 2023, Fujitsu identified three areas for its Materiality (Essential contributions). These areas are solving global environmental issues, developing a digital society, and improving people’s well-being. Fujitsu will collaborate with like-minded partners where there is mutual empathy for purpose and material issues, and not limited to Fujitsu’s direct business areas. Fujitsu believes that it is essential to build an ecosystem that transcends industry boundaries, and has started impact investing in a variety of companies that are tackling the challenge of solving social issues.\n\nAbout Gojo & Company\n\nGojo & Company’s mission is to extend financial inclusion (2) across the globe. The company provides microfinance to low-income clients and has continued to experience impressive growth since its establishment in July 2014. With 2 million clients as of the end of April 2024, Gojo & Company is having a significant social impact in improving access to financial services and empowering women. The value that the company provides also aligns with Fujitsu’s Materiality of developing a digital society and improving people’s well-being. Fujitsu believes that supporting Gojo & Company will be very significant.\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\nRelated Links\n\nFujitsu Ventures Limited\n\nFujitsu Accelerates Investment in Promising Tech Startups with Establishment of 10 Billion Yen Corporate Venture Capital Fund and Management Subsidiary\n\nSustainability at Fujitsu Group\n\nMateriality in the Fujitsu Group\n\nFujitsu’s Commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nAbout Fujitsu\n\nFujitsu’s purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.
