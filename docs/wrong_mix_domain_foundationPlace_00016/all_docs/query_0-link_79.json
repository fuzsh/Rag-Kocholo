        "text": "1. Break through to a better way to learn Built for Education. Ready for the Future. Powered by Intel® Core™ i7 vPro™ processor. Fujitsu Mobility Education Solutions Discover a Better Way to Work with Intel® Inside™\n\n2. Classrooms today are dramatically different from the classrooms of previous generations. Interactive learning is replacing teacher-led classrooms. Students are learning by leveraging mobile devices like tablet PCs to connect and collaborate with teachers and each other and with the world beyond the school. As an educator, how can you best take advantage of these trends? How can you use technology to truly transform the way you teach? Fujitsu education customers consistently point to Fujitsu as the best way to make this transformation. Patrick Vigneron, IT Manager at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame, says that Fujitsu enables teachers to have access to practically limitless information resources at the touch of a button that they can share instantly. Similarly, students have a single repository for all the information they need. According to Vigneron, “The students love the Fujitsu tablets and they really have found it easier to prepare for exams, which brings better results.” In addition to enabling a 21st century classroom, the school is saving $60,000 per year on its textbook budget and $1,000 each month on paper costs. At St. Joseph’s Academy, one of the key benefits of using Fujitsu solutions is the student-run help desk, which has empowered the students to be in charge and learn in the process. Students are fully trained and work side by side with the Fujitsu team to ensure they can effectively troubleshoot issues and provide timely support. Linda Harvison, Principal, believes her students are at an advantage based on the school’s integration of pen and touch technology into their teaching and learning programs, and that the students are already leaders in the world of technology. Fujitsu solutions for education will enable you to migrate your classrooms from textbooks and lectures to an interconnected, student-driven learning environment – a learning environment for the 21st century.
