The Leutnant-Colonel is responsible for information gathering, intelligence, supply, and equipping the entire regiment.[1]\n\nThough this rank's duties may seem to overlap with those of the Hauptmann-Kommandant, in reality the Leutant-Colonel has a much better understanding of the strategic situation and can take command of regimental sized forces.\n\nLAAF Military Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Leutnant-Colonel\n\nLeutnant-Kaptain\n\nDraconis Combine Mustered Soldiery[edit]\n\nIn the DCMS a Lieutenant Colonel is called a Chu-sa. Like other Inner Sphere militaries, they command battalions of troops. In the Draconis Combine Admiralty, the equivalent rank is Sho-sa. As their symbol of rank they wear an apple green katakana numeral 2.[2]\n\nDCMS Officer Ranks by branch of service Rank MechWarrior AeroSpace Fighter Infantry Armor Artillery Naval Crew Technical\n\nService Chu-sa\n\n(Lieutenant Colonel)\n\nSho-sa\n\n(Commander)\n\nArmed Forces of the Federated Suns[edit]\n\nThis is the AFFS equivalent to the Lieutenant Colonel rank used by other militaries. The Leftenant Colonel is usually the executive officer and second in command of a regiment of ground forces. The Leftenant Colonel handles most of the daily administrative chores of the regiment so the commanding Colonel has more time to formulate regimental strategy. The equivalent rank in the AFFS Navy is Light Commodore[3]. These officers command DropShips or Assault ships.[4]\n\nLeftenant Colonels and Light Commodores wear an epaulette with one broad band and one narrow band as their rank insignia.\n\nAFFS Leftenant Colonel (Light Commodore) rank insignia by branch of service Rank MechWarrior AeroSpace Fighter Infantry Armor Naval Crew Technical\n\nService Administrative Medical Legal Logistics/\n\nTransportation Leftenant Colonel\n\n(Light Commodore)\n\nCapellan Confederation Armed Forces[edit]\n\nAfter Sun-Tzu Liao became Chancellor of the Capellan Confederation, he created a new rank system for the CCAF as part of his Xin Sheng movement. Officers who hold the rank of Lieutenant Colonel are called Zhong-shao; Naval officers add Kong- as a prefix to show their rank of Kong-zhong-shao.\n\nAs part of their unique position in the Capellan Confederation, the Warrior Houses use the rank of Ying-zhang for the commanding officer of the Warrior House infantry battalion. Usually this officer also acts as the Executive Officer of the 'Mech battalion.\n\nRegardless of service branch (CCAF or Warrior House;'Mech or infantry), officers use a brass bar with three silver pips as their rank insignia.\n\nCCAF Military Ranks CCAF Rank Warrior House rank Insignia Zhong-shao\n\nKong-zhong-shao\n\n(Lieutenant Colonel) Ying-zhang\n\n(Lieutenant Colonel [Infantry])\n\nFree Worlds League Military[edit]\n\nIn the FWLM the Lieutenant Colonel rank was created to allow Majors to command regimental sized formations. This promotion was only supposed to be taken when a Major was destined to be promoted to Colonel or a until a new Colonel took command of the regiment. In reality this rank can be held by either regimental commanders or senior battalion commanders.[5] After the Military Reorganization Act, these officers commanded regiments of infantry or armor, though they would sometimes be a senior battalion commander in a 'Mech regiment.[6]\n\nIn the FWLM Navy, an officer could only reach the rank of Captain after they had two years of command experience. Frequently officers lacking this experience would act as a Lieutenant-Commander or Commander to get the experience they needed.\n\nA Flag Captain is a FWLM Navy Captain who has more experience and can lead multi-ship operations. Typically these officers are being groomed to become a Commodore. They do not bear a special rank insignia.\n\nIn both branches, officers with this rank wear three broad gold bars on a purple background as their rank symbol.\n\nFWLM Lieutenant Colonel Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Lieutenant Colonel\n\nThe Clans[edit]\n\nThe Clans do not use this rank. Instead a Star Colonel is likely to be assisted by a senior Star Captain.\n\nComstar/Word of Blake[edit]\n\nDue to their unique force structure, the Lieutenant Colonel rank doesn't exist in the Com Guards or Word of Blake Militia. Instead, the commanding officer of a Level III (battalion sized formation) is either an Adept or Demi-Precentor.\n\nComStar doesn't officially use the rank of Demi-Precentor, but informally they use a ComStar logo with a blue-yellow-red halo to show their rank. Word of Blake Demi-Precentors use a gold medallion with their branch insignia in silver to show their \"midway\" position between Adepts and Precentors. Insignia shows theta symbol, indicating JumpShip/WarShip crew. Other service branches replace theta with appropriate Greek letter.\n\nCom Guard/Word of Blake Militia Insignia Rank Com Guards Insignia Word of Blake Militia Insignia Demi-Precentor\n\nFree Rasalhague Republic[edit]\n\nIn the KungsArmé officers with this rank are called Överste-Löjtnant, Swedish for Lieutenant-Colonel.[7] These officers wear an inverted version of the Kapten's insignia: A green patch with a vertical silver bar crossed at the top by a small silver bar.\n\nKungsArmé Military Rank Insignia Rank Insignia Överste-Löjtnant\n\nPeriphery Powers[edit]\n\nMagistracy of Canopus[edit]\n\nA Magistracy Armed Forces Force Major is the equivalent of a Lieutenant Colonel, created with the updating of the MAF's ranking structure. It is awarded to Majors who have accomplished great feats as a way of giving them additional prestige and influence within the MAF. Unlike other officer-grade ranks, Force Major cannot be bought at any price.[8][9] Their rank insignia is a gold diamond topped by a silver star.\n\nMagistracy Armed Forces Insignia Rank Insignia Force Major\n\nTaurian Defense Force[edit]\n\nThis rank isn't used by the TDF.\n\nMarian Hegemony[edit]\n\nThis rank isn't used by the Hegemony Armed Forces.\n\nOutworlds Alliance[edit]\n\nThis rank isn't used by the Alliance Military Corps.\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nRanks, when not preceding a name, are not capitalized.[10]\n\nEx: The major stood and rendered a salute to General DeChavilier.\n\nNon-English ranks, with the exception of those used by the Federated Suns or Lyrans, are italicized.[10]\n\nFor more information, see BattleTechWiki:Manual of Style\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]"
