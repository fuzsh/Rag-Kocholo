        "text": "Veterans Day will be celebrated on Monday, Nov. 12, at 11 a.m. on the front lawn of the Copiah County Courthouse. The speaker for the day will be Donald R. Taylor, Executive Director of the Department of Human Services for the State of Mississippi.\n\nBefore entering civilian service Taylor retired from the United States Army with the rank of Lt. Colonel.\n\nTaylor is serving his second tenure as Executive Director of MDHS. In 1995, he was appointed to this position by Governor Kirk Fordice, and in January, 2004, he was appointed by Governor Haley Barber. During his years with MDHS he has instituted a number of reforms and begun several programs that have saved the taxpayers millions of dollars. His efforts in the area of youth services resulted in his being named Mississippiâ€™s Juvenile Justice Advocate of the Year.\n\nDuring his military career Col. Taylor served the State of Mississippi by being responsible for the Senior Army ROTC program at the University of Mississippi and additionally, having the responsibility for the military science programs at Mississippi Valley State, Delta State, Northeast Community College and Rust College.\n\nIn 1996, Taylor was inducted into the U.S. Army Officers Candidate School Hall of Fame. He is a life member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. He is a board member of the Mississippi Department of Rehabilitive Services, the Mississippi Leadership Forum and the American Public Human Services Association Policy Council.\n\nEveryone is encouraged to join us on Monday to honor our veterans and to hear Col. Taylor."
