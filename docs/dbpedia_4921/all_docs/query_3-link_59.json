        "text": "Most discussions of military ranks in books or online tend to ignore the fact that these ranks are intended to be held by men performing specific functions within a unit for which that rank is necessary. Every army couples rank structure and appointments differently, and as can be seen below, even the Canadian Army has changed the way it handles these matters over the years.\n\nThe discussion of responsibility is in general terms and refers to textbook practices; in reality, field units in time of war rarely saw action at full strength, and junior ranking soldiers and officers were often placed in positions not normally permitted in peacetime or normal circumstances.\n\nThese tables, then, are merely a guide to intended practice, but may still serve to illuminate basic questions of authority and responsibility, and how the ranks of the Canadian Army might compare to other nations. Only when one understands what responsibilities were usually assigned to soldiers holding these ranks can an accurate comparison to other militaries be made. One then finds that a Canadian corporal in the Second World War actually wielded as much authority as a US Army sergeant, for example, in that both commanded a section or squad of 10 to 12 men. The examples given below are for an infantry battalion; there were different appointments and titles for officers and men in other types of units, such as artillery, armoured, or engineer regiments, as well as units of the supporting arms.\n\nFirst World War\n\nRank Tables\n\nCanadian Militia Table of Ranks August 1914 - November 1918 General Officers Officers WOs NCOs Men\n\nLieutenant-General Major-General Brigadier-General\n\nColonel Lieutenant-Colonel Major Captain Lieutenant\n\nSecond Lieutenant\n\nAug 1914-May 1915\n\nWarrant Officer\n\nMay 1915-Nov 1918\n\nWarrant Officer Class I Warrant Officer Class II\n\nStaff Sergeant Sergeant Corporal\n\nLance Corporal1\n\nPrivate\n\n1. Not a rank, but an appointment.\n\nSecond World War\n\nRank Table\n\nResponsibility Table\n\nResponsibilities in an Infantry Unit\n\nKey Appointments\n\nThe rank system has evolved over the years to permit different soldiers with different functions within a unit to operate with the proper level of authority. Some ranks will only be found once within a unit, other ranks are held by soldiers performing many functions.\n\nAppointments in Infantry Units and Sub-Units\n\nMany of the ranks in the table above were associated with specific appointments - a Warrant Officer I Class, for example, was the rank held by a man appointed Regimental Sergeant Major of a battalion. The RSM was the senior enlisted man. Staff Sergeants were generally found in the position of Company Quartermaster Sergeant; no other staff sergeants were found in an infantry battalion. The WO II was most commonly found in an infantry battalion as either the Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant, or as the Company Sergeant Major of one of the companies.\n\nA Lance Sergeant was a corporal wearing three stripes and performing a sergeant's duties; for example, some establishments called for a six-gun Anti Tank platoon to have three of the guns commanded by sergeants, with the other three commanded by lance sergeants.\n\nPost-Unification\n\nRank Table\n\nAppointments in Infantry Units and Sub-Units\n\nThe rank system evolved over decades to permit different soldiers with different functions within a unit to operate with the proper level of authority. Some ranks were only found once within a unit, other ranks were held by soldiers performing many different functions. The following is a list of the major appointments in an infantry battalion.\n\nComplete Table of Pre-Unification and Post-Unification Ranks of All Services"
