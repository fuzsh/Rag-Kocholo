        "text": "Author Archives:\n\nSouthern AgCredit CEO Phillip Morgan Testifies Before U.S. Senate in Support of the 2023 Farm Bill\n\nPhillip Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern AgCredit, a rural lender serving Mississippi and Louisiana, recently testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee hearing on Commodity Programs, Credit, and Crop Insurance in support of a 2023 Farm Bill.\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss), ranking member of the Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade Subcommittee, helped lead the two-part hearing. Part One of the hearing was earlier last week, focusing on the perspective of ag producers and the need for a farm safety net. Part Two of the hearing, held last Thursday, featured a panel of rural lenders, crop insurance agents and providers. Both hearings were conducted in part to assist the Senate Agriculture Committee as it works on the new five-year farm bill. The 2018 Farm Bill expires on Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nMorgan provided testimony on behalf of the Farm Credit Council in support of a strong farm bill.\n\n“Agricultural producers in Mississippi and Louisiana need a strong farm bill, including a robust farm safety net, to manage the ongoing risks presented by weather, markets, supply chain pressures, rising input prices and declining profit margins,” said Morgan.\n\nFor complete coverage of the hearing and to download Morgan’s testimony, visit https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/hearings\n\nSouthern AgCredit Awards $23,000 in Ag Scholarships to Mississippi and Louisiana Students\n\nSouthern AgCredit, a rural financing cooperative, is pleased to announce its 2023 scholarship recipients.

Rolling Fork, a town in our servicing territory, was devastated.\n\nSaturday morning, the team at Southern AgCredit began making plans to provide relief to those affected by the deadly storms. They planned to provide hot meals to locals, first responders, or whoever needed them. They pulled the large Southern AgCredit grill to Rolling Fork and cooked hamburgers, hot dogs, or chicken with side items and cold drinks.\n\nThis relief effort went on for 11 days, and the team served approximately 2,750 hot meals to those who needed them.\n\nSouthern AgCredit would like to thank Bobbie and Angie Casavechia, Tripp Cain with Taylor Rental and First South Farm Credit for helping in this relief effort.\n\nMoseley Meadows\n\nBenton and Kate Moseley are the owners and operators of Moseley Meadows, an agricultural-focused, family-friendly, agritourism farm in Madison County, Mississippi. The farm features a pumpkin patch, hayride, petting zoo, hay castles, corn pit, and other farm-related attractions. Currently, they are open every weekend in the month of October, and their operation has become quite a popular place for families in the area to visit.\n\nBenton grew up working on his family’s Christmas tree farm, Santa’s Choice, in Florence. The tree farm was a community favorite, and Benton attributes his current success to learning the importance of hard work at an early age.\n\n“I loved working on the Christmas tree farm. When I was 15 years old, my family expanded the farm, and I was able to help them run the operation”, said Benton. “It’s been my lifelong dream to own my own land and run an operation of my own.”\n\nBenton and Kate began Moseley Meadows in Florence and operated the farm on rented land. “We really wanted ownership of the land and also more of it to add more attractions”, said Kate. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t find a piece of land in Florence that would suit our goals for Moseley Meadows, so we started looking at other locations.”\n\nThe Moseleys found the perfect farm in Madison County and quickly jumped on the opportunity of owning it.\n\n“There were other financing options, but we were not interested in any other lender besides Southern AgCredit,” said Kate. “It just made sense because Southern AgCredit understands agricultural financing, so it was a natural fit with our business”.\n\nBenton knew Pate DeMuth, their loan officer at Southern AgCredit, through prior connections and reached out to Pate when they found the land that they wanted to purchase. “Pate has an ag background, and he understood our business model and our unique financing needs. He’s been amazing to work with,” said Benton.\n\nThe Moseleys have lofty goals and aspirations for Moseley Meadows. Their current focus is during the fall when pumpkins are in season. However, they plan to add other activities that can be enjoyed year-round.\n\n“We want to offer more family-oriented, fun, safe, community events like farm-to-table dinners, farmers markets, and events tailored to educating the younger generation on how to grow food and fiber,” said Benton. “Also, I would love to have Christmas trees at the farm during December.”\n\nKate’s favorite part of the whole aspect is getting to watch Benton’s dreams and goals become a reality. She also gets to take part in something that brings families together. Not just families in their local community, but their own as well.\n\n“When it’s pumpkin season, we all pitch in to help run the farm”, said Kate. “My parents are out on the farm working alongside us, and my sister is helping by running our social media. Benton’s family helps us, too. I love that this farm has brought our families so much closer.”\n\nBenton and Kate have been borrower-owners of Southern AgCredit since buying their Madison County farm in May of 2022.\n\nSouthern AgCredit Hires Loan Officer in Hattiesburg Branch Office\n\nSouthern AgCredit recently hired Garren Berry as a loan officer in its Hattiesburg office.

The (LIBOR) Act “provides for the transition of certain financial contracts away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), a reference interest rate based upon the lending terms certain banks offer to each other for various lengths of time.\n\nLIBOR is set to be retired in 2023. Various financial contracts reference LIBOR as a benchmark for prevailing interest rates and use LIBOR in calculating certain payments or obligations. In the event a contract referencing LIBOR does not have a fallback or replacement rate provision in effect when LIBOR is retired, or a replacement rate is not selected by a determining person as defined by the bill, the bill provides for a transition to a replacement rate selected by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The (LIBOR) Act also provides for conforming changes to these contracts, the continuity and enforceability of these contracts, and protections against liability as a result of such a transition.”\n\nSummary: H.R.4616 — 117th Congress (2021-2022)\n\n“Our Southern AgCredit team has worked diligently over the past two years to transition our LIBOR indexed loans to other variable and fixed loan rate products. We are pleased to have the additional assurances and guidance from congress regarding the financial market’s transition away from the LIBOR index.”\n\nPhillip Morgan, Southern AgCredit Chief Executive Officer\n\nSouthern AgCredit Awards $31,000 in Scholarships to Local Students\n\nCollege Scholarhips\n\nSouthern AgCredit, a rural financing cooperative, is pleased to announce its 2022 agricultural education scholarship recipients. The co-op awarded a total of $31,000 in scholarships to 28 students.\n\nTo qualify, each applicant had to be a current Southern AgCredit borrower, or a current borrower’s child, grandchild or spouse. Selection criteria included academics, leadership, extracurricular activities and an essay by the student.\n\nA total of 26 students each received a $1,000 agricultural education scholarship.\n\nIn addition, two recipients were awarded $2,500 scholarships. These special scholarships honor two former longtime Southern AgCredit board members — Jimmie Dick Carter and Emery Skelton. They are awarded to deserving students attending or planning to attend Mississippi State University and major in agriculture or a related field.\n\n“These young people represent the future of agriculture, and we are proud to do our part to help them pursue their dreams. We wish them all much success.”\n\nSouthern AgCredit Chief Executive Officer Phillip Morgan\n\nBy supporting ag education with 28 scholarships, Southern AgCredit seeks to fuel the future of the agriculture industry.\n\nScholarships Recipients\n\nFollowing are the recipients and the colleges they attend or plan to attend.\n\n$2500 – Jimmie Dick Carter Scholarship\n\nKaroline Heathcock\n\nWaynesboro, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\n$2500 – Emery Skelton Scholarship\n\nAustin Rexrode\n\nHollandale, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\n$1000 Scholarships\n\nDock Adams\n\nSmithdale, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nFaith Barry\n\nSumrall, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nLainey Brumfield\n\nFoxworth, MS\n\nWilliam Carey University\n\nGrayson Childress\n\nBrookhaven, MS\n\nUnited State Air Force Academy\n\nKobly Donahoo\n\nBelzoni, MS\n\nMississippi Delta Community College\n\nMolly Garner\n\nMadison, MS\n\nUniversity of Arkansas\n\nAyden Gautreau\n\nTylertown, MS\n\nPearl River Community College\n\nTaylor Gautreau\n\nTylertown, MS\n\nSouthwest Mississippi Community College\n\nJames Hunter Hearn\n\nBenoit, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nTristen Herrington\n\nLucedale, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nThomas “Trey” Knott\n\nBogue Chitto, MS\n\nMississippi College or Copiah-Lincoln Community College\n\nJayden Latham\n\nWalnut Grove, MS\n\nEast Mississippi Community College\n\nSavannah Rose McMillan\n\nBraxton, MS\n\nBelhaven University\n\nVivian McRee\n\nWesson, MS\n\nCopiah-Lincoln Community College\n\nLila Murphy\n\nJackson, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nGeorgia Neill\n\nMcCarley, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nFrancesca Pham\n\nLawrence, MS\n\nEast Central Community College\n\nShelby Richardson\n\nBiloxi, MS\n\nUniversity of Southern Mississippi\n\nEmmie Shaw\n\nBruce, MS\n\nNorthwest Community College\n\nElizabeth Skelton\n\nGreenville, MS\n\nMississippi State University\n\nZachary Ty Skelton\n\nGreenwood, MS\n\nMississippi Delta Community College\n\nLilli C.

The rural lending cooperative specializes in financing land and agricultural operations in Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nSpence holds a bachelor’s degree in marketing from Mississippi State University. She comes from a tenured career at Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, where she held various positions and most recently was a claims examiner. She is married to Kevin Spence, and they reside in Madison with their daughter.\n\n“Casey brings wide-ranging customer service experience to the team, and we are excited to have her in our Ridgeland branch office,” said Phillip Morgan, Southern AgCredit chief executive officer.\n\nBlue-Ribbon Red Angus\n\nWhen Erin and Todd Vowell were newlyweds, Erin hoped to someday see cattle from every window.\n\n“It sounds silly, but it goes back to my grandfather’s ranch,” Erin says. “Those were my favorite childhood memories.”\n\nIt wasn’t silly to Todd, who grew up on a cattle farm.\n\nFifteen years later, their Forest, Mississippi, home is surrounded by pasture. And in 2020 they expanded their Red Angus seedstock operation by purchasing a ranch in Oklahoma.\n\nThe plan came together thanks to good friends, good timing and a loan from Southern AgCredit.\n\nGoing for quality\n\nSandridge Land & Cattle has quickly grown in six years. It started small when daughter Addison, now 14, was old enough to show animals.\n\n“Red Angus are very efficient cattle with a great disposition, so they were a great fit for our young showman,” says Erin, who manages the cattle operation. “And Angus beef has excellent marbling and quality.”\n\nIn fact, the Vowells stock Angus beef at their 13 Vowell’s Marketplace stores and three other grocery stores in Mississippi and Alabama.\n\n“Our brand is truly built around the meat department,” says Todd, president of the grocery business his grandfather started in 1945. “We still cut all of our meat in the store.”\n\nAddison Vowell’s heifer Ellie was named Dixie National Junior Round-Up Supreme Beef Female in 2021. Ellie now lives at the family’s Oklahoma ranch.\n\nBut the family’s purebred cattle aren’t destined for the meat case. They’re winning in the show ring.\n\nLast year, Addison won a $1,500 scholarship to Mississippi State University when her Champion Red Angus heifer was named the Dixie National Junior Round-Up Supreme Beef Female. Her brother, Cade, 12, showed the heifer’s week-old calf. That’s just one of several wins for the siblings.\n\nMaking a westward expansion\n\nRed Six Mile Ellie 205G, Addison’s cow, now enjoys the moderate climate and more diverse forages of their new ranch near Stillwater, Oklahoma.\n\nThe ranch helps the family access new markets, better cattle prices, and lower freight and feed costs.\n\n“Oklahoma is a hub for cattle sales and operations,” Erin says. “There’s more opportunity there for our seedstock operation. We do a lot of embryo transfer and AI work, and use the same type genetics at both locations.”\n\nThe Vowells market their bulls and females through an annual bull sale, private sales and consignment sales across the U.S. They also offer show heifers and embryos.\n\nPurchasing the turnkey operation was an opportunity they couldn’t pass up. But they had to act quickly to pull it off.\n\nFinancing with Southern roots\n\nThe Vowells called Southern AgCredit based on the lender’s patronage program and competitive interest rates. It turned out Kevin Brown — whom Todd helped coach for high school football — was on the staff in Ridgeland, Mississippi.\n\n“Kudos to Kevin,” Erin says. “He had the best rates and made it as easy as possible. Everybody at Southern AgCredit jumped through hoops to close the loan on a tight schedule.”\n\nTodd, who serves on the board of a local bank, says he and Erin always shop around.\n\n“We like to diversify in business and financing,” he says. “But the most rewarding experience thus far was with Kevin and Southern AgCredit.”\n\nA few months later, the Vowells refinanced their Mississippi land with the lending co-op.\n\n“I think they appreciate the way we understand their operation,” says Brown, now Ridgeland branch manager. “Southern AgCredit is involved in the local ag community and is the title sponsor of the Dixie National Rodeo. We have a passion for ag financing.”\n\nBonding through the cattle industry\n\nThe Vowells are now focused on building and improving their herd in both locations.\n\nBred heifers graze near the Vowells’ home in Forest, Mississippi.\n\n“Our goal is to be on the forefront of improving the breed as a whole,” Erin says. “We’ve partnered with great people who have extensive breeding and development knowledge. We’ve also met lifelong friends.”\n\nThose friends and partners include Tony Tolar and his family, as well as Cody Maske and his wife.\n\n“Tony, our Oklahoma ranch manager, and Cody, our ranch manager in Forest, help with breeding decisions and day-to-day operations,” Erin says. “And the kids are very hands-on. It’s been a huge character-builder for them and an opportunity to learn to take the good and the bad.”\n\nBut lately, they’ve been on a winning streak.\n\nAfter the 2021 Dixie National, Ellie and two calves from an embryo flush all had division wins at the North American Junior Red Angus Event. And one, a calf they Vowells sold to a family in Colorado, went on to be named Reserve Champion Other Purebred Heifer at the Colorado State Fair.\n\n“We love to see our customers successful,” Erin says. “And those cattle are special to us, too. We are just tickled.”\n\nMolpus Woodlands Group LLC\n\nMolpus Woodlands Group is one of the oldest timber-related companies in the United States with a storied history that dates to 1905. Over its 117-year history, Molpus has evolved from a mercantile store to a lumberyard, to a sawmill, and now to a timberland investment management organization (TIMO). Since its inception as a TIMO in 1996, Molpus has invested, on behalf of its clients, more than $4 billion across 4 million acres of timberland across the U.S.\n\nMolpus acquires, manages and sells timberland as an investment vehicle for a variety of investors. It focuses on earning optimal cash returns while also being a good steward of the forests that it manages. Molpus incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and practices into all its investment analysis and decision-making. The team at Molpus believes their strong ESG initiatives have positive implications for the environment and the communities in which they live and work.\n\nMolpus has achieved many significant milestones in its ESG initiatives. Most recently, it celebrated the planting of 251 million trees since 1998 as part of its sustainable forest management program. Molpus recognizes the importance of land-based solutions and healthy forests in climate change mitigation and carbon sequestration. It is also actively engaged in nature- based carbon-offset projects that help preserve forests as carbon sinks. Carbon offsets represent an increase in carbon storage to compensate for carbon emissions that occur elsewhere. The company was awarded, on behalf of a client, the 2018 Carbon Project Developer of the Year award by the California Climate Action Reserve at the 2019 North American Carbon World conference held in Los Angeles, California.\n\nPrivate working forests, such as those Molpus manages, are a fundamental part of the underlying infrastructure of the U.S. economy. These forests produce renewable, recyclable, and reusable wood and paper products that our economy depends on. These forests also absorb and store carbon, produce clean water and air, sustain vital biodiversity, provide recreation experiences and supply a growing resource for renewable energy.\n\nMolpus also boasts many other ESG initiatives. It currently offers an annual scholarship program at five different universities that targets students in under-represented populations. Its objective is to help bring more diversity to the forestry management profession. Molpus also prides itself on employing qualified natural resources professionals to manage forests who have completed training programs that focus on issues like water quality and enhancing biodiversity. Molpus helps monitor and protect over 6,000 miles of streams and rivers to ensure clean water. It also monitors and preserves species of concern, including the grizzly bear, gopher tortoise and forest songbirds. All of Molpus’ management forests are certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative program (SFI) Forest Management Standard, which is recognized by the globally recognized Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). Where beneficial, additional certification to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards is also obtained.\n\n“Southern AgCredit has been a constant champion for Molpus and its success for more than a decade now. It is not just a transactional relationship for each party, it’s a partnership,” says Hunter Barlow, Southern AgCredit’s agribusiness portfolio manager. “It’s been Southern AgCredit’s knowledge of timber financing and unique loan products that has helped this relationship grow and flourish as it has.”\n\n“We have worked with Southern AgCredit for many years as they understand our business and the needs of our sustainable forestry management. Their deep knowledge of our industry enables them to address our objectives and tailor lending solutions to our clients needs,” says Michael Cooper, Molpus’ senior director of client relations and business development. “Southern AgCredit comes from the rich history of the Federal Land Bank System, and their level of expertise in lending to the forestry industry is unique.”\n\nFrasier Farms\n\nRandy Frasier has been in the poultry business for over 30 years. Although this wasn’t where he started, he is proud of where he ended up. Poultry wasn’t the only thing that kept Randy busy. He also had a 30-year career with the City of Ruston, where he managed the city’s water and sewer systems. He’s since retired from the City of Ruston and is semiretired from the poultry business.\n\n“I still go check on the chicken houses each day, and when I see something that needs attention, well, I tell the managers that they need to get to it,” Randy says with a laugh. The managers are Randy’s son and daughter-in-law, Travis and Leslie.\n\nFrasier Farms consists of 29 acres and eight Class A broiler houses in Dubach. Randy built his first four chicken houses in 1990. After Randy retired from the city, he decided to expand his operation. “I thought, well, if I’m going to be in the chicken business, then I need to have more chicken houses.” So, that’s exactly what he did. He added 4 more houses to his poultry operation.\n\nRandy knew Devin Davis, Southern AgCredit’s Ruston branch manager, from a previous job when Devin was in commercial banking. When Devin accepted the job at Southern AgCredit, he was asked if he knew anyone who raised chickens. “I sure do,” said Devin. “Mr. Randy was one of the first people I went to talk to about Southern AgCredit.”\n\nIt wasn’t long after this conversation that Randy walked through the doors of the Ruston branch and told Devin he’d like to move all his loans to Southern AgCredit. “Devin is just a good guy, and I like doing business with him and with Southern AgCredit,” Randy says.\n\nFrasier Farms grows larger birds in the 10-pound range for the House of Raeford, their integrator. Their birds are NAE (no antibiotics ever) poultry. The Frasiers see a low mortality rate among their flocks, and their housing specs are in line with Raeford’s guidelines. “We produce a really good breed of chicken and we’re proud of that,” Randy says.\n\nWhen Travis and Leslie got involved with the business, they decided to add cattle. They now have cows, heifers, calves and one bull. “My grandad always had cows when I was a little boy, and having my own cows was just something I always dreamed of,” says Travis.\n\nTravis and Leslie manage the day-to-day operations of the farm. “My favorite part of all of this is knowing that I am helping to contribute to feeding America,” Leslie says. “That’s very important to us.”\n\nWhen it comes to Travis, he enjoys being his own boss and working closely each day with his family. Travis and Leslie see their business expanding to hopefully include even more chicken houses in the future.\n\nRandy’s wife, Kathy, works off the farm but is never too far away. “I’ve done my share of cleaning out chicken houses and feeding chickens,” Kathy says. She works in the office furniture business. She recently sold her business, but the new company asked her to stay on for guidance and direction, which she gladly accepted.\n\nRandy is also a world-famous foxhound breeder. His tagline is Faith, Family, Foxhounds. “The good Lord has blessed us and keeps on blessing us,” he says.\n\nCarson Smyly\n\n“Southern AgCredit was one of the key factors allowing me to achieve my dream of becoming a farmer.”\n\n—Carson Smyly\n\nCarson Smyly is a fifth generation row crop farmer from the Mississippi Delta. He farms on acreage in Washington, Sunflower and Humphreys counties in Mississippi. Carson grows primarily soybeans, although he’s also raised other grain and cotton in previous years.\n\nWhile Carson is only 28 years old, he has tremendous farming experience since he’s worked on a farm most of his life. His father, Doug Smyly, is also a full-time farmer and owns Smyly Planting Company in Hollandale. Carson has worked alongside his father for many years and attributes much of his farming knowledge to him. Doug and his wife, Nichole, became Southern AgCredit stockholders in 2004. They primarily farm soybeans and corn.\n\nCarson signed on his first production loan with Southern AgCredit in 2015 and has had successful years since then. “Southern AgCredit was one of the key factors allowing me to achieve my dream of becoming a farmer,” said Carson.\n\nCarson is married to the former Anna Coker of Stuttgart, Arkansas. Anna is a graduate research assistant at Mississippi State University and is studying to receive her Ph.D. in agronomy. Together, she and Carson have two young children, Sutton and John Douglas.\n\n“I guess you could say that farming is most definitely not just an occupation to our family,” Carson says. “It is a way of life, and I couldn’t imagine it any other way.”\n\nThe Smyly family is a close-knit one. Being able to farm together is something that they truly enjoy. “Family is a big deal to us, and having the opportunity to work alongside my family day in and day out is an opportunity that cannot be topped,” Carson says.\n\nThe future is bright for the Smyly family and their farming operation. Their goals are to continue to grow in all aspects and ensure that farming is an option for their children to pursue should they desire to farm when they are grown.\n\n“I couldn’t be more thankful to have had the pleasure of dealing with the hard-working, friendly and knowledgeable staff at Southern AgCredit — specifically our loan officer, Colton Thomas, who is also a friend,” Carson says.\n\n“Carson and I have known each other for most of our lives,” says Colton, a Southern AgCredit loan officer in Greenville. “We attended grade school together, and we both attended Mississippi State at the same time. I am fortunate to get to call Carson a friend of mine with whom I enjoy sharing a duck blind or making a farm visit.”\n\nColton, who also comes from a Delta farming family, knows the Smyly family’s work ethic because he’s seen it firsthand. Their families have been farming next to each other for many years.\n\n“The Smylys take great pride in their operation. I look forward to working with them for many years to come,” says Colton.\n\nSouthern AgCredit Promotes Britny Hester to Chief Financial Officer\n\nRIDGELAND, Miss. – Southern AgCredit, a rural lending cooperative, recently promoted Britny Hester to chief financial officer.\n\nHester is a certified public accountant and holds a bachelor’s degree from Mississippi College. She joined Southern AgCredit in April 2013 as the association’s treasurer later was promoted to the association’s controller.\n\nHester was previously in public accounting, providing auditing and consulting services primarily to Farm Credit System institutions. She lives in Jackson, Mississippi with her husband, Trey; together they have two children.\n\n“Britny is a valuable team member to our association, and I’m thrilled to promote her to the position of chief financial officer,” said Phillip Morgan, Southern AgCredit’s CEO. “I look forward to working alongside her as she leads our finance and accounting areas.”\n\nSouthern AgCredit Hires New Employees\n\nSouthern AgCredit, a rural lending cooperative, recently hired three new team members:\n\nStephen Bass is vice president of lending for the Newton branch office. He was vice president of Community Bank in Meridian for the past 8 years. Before Community Bank, he had a combined 10 years of experience in Farm Credit. He is a graduate of Mississippi State University with a bachelor’s of science degree in forest management and a master’s degree in agribusiness management. Bass resides in Meridian with his two children.\n\nMichelle Robinson is a loan administrator for the Hattiesburg branch office. Before joining Southern AgCredit, she worked 19 years as a real estate paralegal with Jackson, Tullos, Rogers & Morgan, PLLC. She earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Southern Mississippi. She and her spouse, Dustin have two children.\n\nAdam Young is a senior loan officer for the Shreveport branch office. Before joining Southern AgCredit, he spent 18 years with the David Toms Foundation before most recently serving as vice president of commercial lending for B1Bank in Shreveport. Young holds a bachelor’s degree in mass communication from Louisiana State University. He and his spouse, Lucy have four daughters.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Stephen, Michelle and Adam to the Southern AgCredit team,” said CEO Phillip Morgan. “They each bring their own unique set of skills to our association and I look forward to working with them as we continue to meet the needs of our customer-owners.”\n\nSouthern AgCredit Holds Ceremonial Groundbreaking for New Headquarters and Branch\n\nSouthern AgCredit held a groundbreaking ceremony on December 14, 2021, celebrating the start of construction on its new headquarters and branch. The new building will be located at 306 Commerce Center Drive in Ridgeland, Mississippi.\n\nThe rural lending cooperative specializes in financing land and agricultural operations. Its territory includes the southernmost 50 counties in Mississippi and 11 parishes in Northwest Louisiana.\n\nThe new building will encompass 19,000 square feet of office space, as well as 10,000 square feet of outside event space. It’s expected the project will be completed in January 2023.\n\n“The new building will allow us to continue to grow, but more importantly it will give us more space to better serve our borrower-owners,” said Phillip Morgan, Southern AgCredit chief executive officer. “We outgrew our current space in 2018 and had to purchase a second building, so our administrative team has been split between two buildings in Ridgeland for a few years now. I look forward to the day we can all come back together and operate in one building.”\n\nMorgan said the new space will also give Southern AgCredit the ability to host outdoor events for its borrower-owners.\n\n“We are outdoor people by nature. We love to host our stockholders and others in the community, and the new outdoor event space will be the perfect setting for events to come.”\n\nParticipating with Morgan in the symbolic ground-breaking were the Southern AgCredit board of directors, H.C. “Buster” Bailey Jr., the Honorable Gene McGee, Dale Partners Architect, P.A., and Alliant Construction.\n\n2022 Event Preview: Southern AgCredit at the Dixie National Rodeo and North Louisiana Agri-Business Council Ag Expo\n\nSouthern AgCredit is preparing for our biggest year yet!
