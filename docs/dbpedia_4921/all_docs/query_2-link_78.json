The Choctaws pay $250,000 annually to the State for promoting their Silver Star and Golden Moon Casinos. The tribe is also exempt from a 12 percent tax on gross gaming revenues.(The Sun Herald, June 11, 2005, p. A1)\n\nJackson County plan\n\nFederal process requires five steps for an Indian gaming project to come to fruition: Indian land must be placed in trust for the purposes of gaming; environmental impact study; approval of Mississippi’s Governor; Interior Department provides a legal review of the project; Bureau of Indian Affairs regional director will prepare a “finding of fact” brief that will be submitted to the Department of Interior’s Office of Indian Gaming Management. Chief Phillip Martin, leader and spokesman, of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians predicted that the process will take a minimum of five years.(The Sun Herald, June 19, 2006, p. A4)\n\nTrust land conversion\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the Choctaw nation submitted an application to convert forty-acres of trust land in Jackson County, Mississippi into a casino site. At Biloxi, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation is planning a $1.2 billion casino resort near Biloxi as a private sector operation. Mashantucket Pequot owns Foxwoods Resort Casino at Connecticut.(The Sun Herald, September 11, 2006, p. B2)\n\nTribal Casino bill loses\n\nIn mid-September 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives failed to pass an initiative by the Republican Party to deny Indian tribes the right to build casinos off their reservation lands. The vote was 247-171 to pass, but the measure failed since a two thirds majority vote was required to pass the legislation.(The Sun Herald, September 14, 2006, p. D8)\n\n2006 Casino hearing\n\nOn October 18th, the Bureau of Indian Affairs planned to convene its first public hearing on the Mississippi Band of Choctaw proposed casino on Mississippi Highway 57. The meeting was booked for the Civic Center in Ocean Springs, Mississippi and was the incipient action in the preparation of an environmental impact statement for the casino, hotel, and retail center planned for the site.(The Sun Herald, October 6, 2006, p. A2)\n\nAlthough First American Printing and Direct Mail, a Mississippi Band of Choctaws owned business, had paid a deposit for the Civic Center in early August to reserve space for a public hearing for September 20th, a week before the rescheduled Bureau of Indian Affairs mid-October hearing, members of the Ocean Springs Board of Aldermen and John McKay, Jackson County District Five Board of Supervisor whose District the proposed Choctaw casino would open, complained that their first notice of the meeting was when they had read it in The Sun Herald.(The Sun Herald, October 13, 2006, p. A13)\n\nPrior to the first public hearing by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Chief Phillip Martin announced that his Mississippi Band of Choctaws plan to build a $375 million casino resort in Jackson County, Mississippi. The casino proposal would be for 2230 slot machines, 70 gaming tables, and 15 poker tables. The hotel would have 1100 rooms. This new announcement is exponential compared to the Choctaw’s first proposal, which was to only install bingo-based slot machines in its existing factory building on the Mississippi Highway 57 site, which is within the jurisdiction of the City of Ocean Springs. The Mississippi Band of Choctaws own and operate the Silver Star and Golden Moon Casinos at their Philadelphia, Mississippi reservation.(The Ocean Springs Record. October 19, 2006, p. A1 and The Sun Herald, October 18, 2006, p. A1)\n\nAt the Ocean Springs Civic Center on the evening of October 18th, the proposed Jackson County Choctaw Indian casino hearing was well attended, especially by followers the Baptist Church. The audience size was estimated at 350 people. After opening remarks by representatives of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, environmental consultants, and the Mississippi Band of Choctaws, the remainder of the session consisted of three-minute talks from people wishing to address the casino issue from the floor. The overwhelming consensus from the people in attendance was that casino gaming is undesirable in Jackson County, Mississippi.(The Sun Herald, October 19, 2006, p. A1 and Ray L. Bellande, an attendee)\n\nCoast Businesses for Fair Play\n\nIn early October, the public was informed that Coast Businesses for Fair Play, a new PAC, a local political-action committee, was being formed to be antagonistic towards the proposed Jackson County Choctaw casino. In their first public comment, Coast Businesses for Fair Play opined that the public had not been notified of the first public hearing by the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Governor’s office, which opposes the Indian casino.(The Sun Herald, October 7. 2006, p. A1)\n\nIn February 2007, Coast Businesses for Fair Play filed litigation against the U.S. Department of the Interior alleging that the Federal agency had not complied with their request for the release of public documents concerning the proposed Choctaw casino in Jackson County. Interior through their legal representative retorted that that Coast Businesses for Fair Play has not used all of the resources available to them under the Freedom of Information Act and that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi has no jurisdiction in this matter.(The Sun Herald, February 16, 2007, p. A5)\n\nSun Herald’s editorial opinions\n\nOn October 15, 2006 The Sun Herald’s editorial staff were very negative on the idea of The Mississippi Band of Choctaws’ proposal to open a casino resort in Jackson County.(The Sun Herald, October 15, 2006, p. B6)\n\nIn March 2007, after Mayor Connie Moran announced her conditional support of the proposed Choctaw casino on Mississippi Highway 57 at Ocean Springs, The Sun Herald opined that (see The Sun Herald, March 28, 2007, p. B4)\n\nBiloxi Investment delays?\n\nIn late October 2006, Harrah’s Entertainment announced that it was putting a moratorium on its proposed $1 billion dollar plans for expanding its gaming operations at Biloxi. Among the reasons cited for their suspension of activity in the Biloxi market were: high cost of construction; market volatility; and the proposed Mississippi Band of Choctaw’s casino for neighboring Jackson County. The threat of an untaxed Indian casino with its excellent location on US Interstate 10 at Ocean Springs, which would permit it to be first gaming site to available for the lucrative Alabama-Florida trade has created an angst among casino operators to the west in Harrison and Hancock Counties. Although Haley Barbour, Governor of Mississippi, has repeatedly announced to the public and Bureau of Indian Affairs that he opposes the Choctaw casino at Ocean Springs, Chief Phillip Martin, leader of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws, is moving forward with an environmental impact study and desires a non-binding referendum on the issue during the 2008 Presidential election. Casino executives believe that this issue must be resolved now and that delay will curtail future investment and growth in the gaming and tourist markets along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.(The Sun Herald, October 27, 2006, p. C12)\n\nGovernor Haley Barbour\n\nIn November 2006, the Biloxi City Council passed a resolution requesting Republican Governor Haley Barbour to take “all measures within his power to oppose and prohibit” [the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to put a casino in Jackson County. The Council asked the Governor to “act quickly to end this threat to the economic recovery to the Mississippi Gulf Coast.” Governor Barber opposes the Indian casino and has notified the Bureau of Indian Affairs of his dissatisfaction. Despite the Governor’s negative position to the Choctaw casino proposal, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has allow the Mississippi Band of Choctaws to pursue and environmental impact statement.(The Sun Herald, December 6, 2006, p. A7)\n\nLawyer hired\n\nThe Biloxi City Council higher Michael Cavanaugh, a Biloxi attorney, to fight the Choctaw casino project for Jackson County. Mr. Cavanaugh will assist the Biloxi casino market which is united to oppose the aspirations of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws in neighboring Jackson County. Cavanaugh’s remuneration, a monthly retainer, will range between $1500 and $18000.(The Sun Herald, December 6, 2006, p. A7)\n\n2007\n\nBible thumpers and casino crusaders\n\nMore opposition to the proposed Choctaw Casino at Ocean Springs surfaced on January 22, 2007, when Jackson County United for Families [JCUF], a group of pastors, and Coast Businesses for Fair Play [CBFP], an association supported by Biloxi casinos, met to discuss means to negate the Choctaw’s plans for a local casino. In defending the meeting, the Reverend Carl King, chairman of the Jackson County United for Families, stated that his group was not an ally of CBFP, but was wagging war against the Native Americans to protect the quality of life and moral values of the community. One result of this conference was that the religious leaders may ask the Jackson County Board of Supervisors to hold a nonbinding referendum on the public’s desire to have a casino in Jackson County at an earlier date than that proposed by the Mississippi Band of Choctaws, which was recommended for the 2008 Presidential elections.(The Sun Herald, January 23, 2007, p. A5)\n\nA meeting of JCUF and two Jackson County Supervisors on January 31, 2007 to request that a non-binding referendum on the proposed Choctaw casino in western Jackson County be held this election year rather than 2008 resulted in the Supervisors declaring that they were unknowledgeable about this particular election process. Shortly thereafter, the Mississippi Attorney General’s office released a statement, which related that: “a local government may conduct a non-binding referendum pursuant to its ‘home rule’ authority.” Tishomingo County, Mississippi in 2001 held a non-binding referendum when the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians wanted to build a casino in this northeast Mississippi county. It was defeated by local voters 55 percent to 45 percent and consequently the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians ceased their pursuit of a local casino. (The Sun Herald, February 1, 2007, p. A. , February 2, 2007, p. A7, and February 3, 2007, p. A3)\n\nVote decision\n\nJCUF met again with the Jackson County Board of Supervisors and the County leaders decided to seek approval from the State Legislature before holding a referendum on the proposed Choctaw casino on Ms. Highway 57. Danny Guice, R-Ocean Springs offered to introduce the proposal for legislative action on a non-binding casino vote to coincide with State and County elections to be held in November 2007. The ministerial group had hope for a quicker decision as they believe that the anti-casino sentiment is stronger now than it will be in the future, as they believe that Chief Martin of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws will propagandize the benefits of the casino to the local populace.(The Sun Herald, February 16, 2007, p. A5 and The Ocean Springs Record, February 15, 2007, p. A1)\n\nOn February 20, 2007, the Jackson County Board of Supervisors formally submitted to the Legislature their request to have the Legislature pass local and private legislation granting the citizens of the County the right to hold a non-binding referendum on the proposed Choctaw Casino at Ocean Springs. Supervisors expected to hear from the Legislature on the matter within two weeks.(The Sun Herald, February 21, 2007, p. A4)\n\nBy mid-March 2007, JCUF leaders began to show frustration with the Jackson County Board of Supervisors for their slow response to the pastor’s demands for a November 2007 referendum. The holy men felt that a November 2008 vote as suggested by Chief Phillip Martin would give the Choctaws more time to influence the outcome of the election. Chief Martin is convinced in order for the Mississippi Band of Choctaws to have a casino in Jackson County, the local populous must approve a non-binding referendum to show the Governor and Secretary of the Interior that casino gaming is desirable in the County.(The Sun Herald, March 17, 2007, p. A15)\n\nAttorney General’s opinion\n\nOn March 8, 2007, the Office of the Attorney General of Mississippi released its opinion concerning the non-binding referendum on the proposed Choctaw Casino at Jackson County. In essence the opinion stated that the proposed vote “would be a proper subject of a non-binding referendum”, as long as the County determines the use of County funds to have the vote, “is in the County’s best interest.” The opinion further noted that Federal Government does not ask for local approval when determining if tribal gaming is being considered. Also the County may take private donations to underwrite an election cost and the Board of Supervisors do not have to wait until 2008 to have this election.(The Sun Herald, March 9, 2007, p. A2)\n\nSeveral members of the Jackson County Board of Supervisors opined that the Attorney General’s opinion on the Choctaw Casino referendum might not be binding since the Board of Supervisors did not request it. The request was made by Representative Danny Guice, R-Ocean Springs. John McKay, representing Jackson County District 5 said, “An attorney general’s opinion has got to be specific to the entity requesting it. Danny Guice got an attorney general’s opinion. If he has an opinion and holds an election, he’s free and clear. It won’t cost him a dime if the Choctaw’s challenge it in court. If on the other hand, the Board of Supervisors decides to do it, we have not been given that green light. If the Choctaws overturn it, we each are individually liable. That’s why you have to have an attorney general’s opinion specific to you.”(The Sun Herald, March 17, 2007, p. A15)\n\nOn March 23, 2007, the Jackson County Board of Supervisors asked the Attorney General’s Office to expedite an opinion on whether the Board of Supervisors can propose a non-binding referendum on the proposed Mississippi Band of Choctaw’s casino at Ocean Springs. The Supervisors anticipated having an answer to their request by April 2nd.(The Sun Herald, March 25, 2007, p. A2)\n\nPolitical opinions\n\nIn early June, John Windsor, a Democratic Party candidate for Secretary of State for Mississippi, expressed his opposition to the Mississippi Band of Choctaws proposed casino at Ocean Springs. He cited the favorable tax situation for the Native Americans; the expansion of inland gaming beyond the intent of the State legislature; and the negative precedent of allowing tribal casinos to be build indiscriminately in the State, as salient reasons for his opposition.(The Sun Herald, June 9, 2007, p. A6)\n\nChoctaw elections\n\nIn early June 2007, the Mississippi Band of Choctaws held its election for a new chief. Chief Phillip Martin (b. 1927), the incumbent who has been the Choctaw tribal leader for twenty eight years, lost the first primary to Beasley Denson (b. 1950) who campaigned for change. Denson outpolled Chief Martin 1403 votes to 1347 votes. Opponents to the proposed Choctaw casino in Jackson County, Mississippi fear that if Chief Martin is unseated that his promise to abide by the results of the proposed nonbinding referendum, which will poll the sentiment of the residents of Jackson County as to their desire for the Choctaw casino, will be voided by the new chief.(The Sun Herald, June 14, 2007, p. A1.)\n\nFollowing the June 2007 primary election, Chief Martin accused Beasley Denson of receiving support from protagonists, the Gulf Coast casino lobby, of his proposed Jackson County casino. A letter mailed to tribal voters was the vehicle of, Chief Martin’s allegation against Mr. Beasley. Chief Martin further added that a Choctaw Coast casino could generate $200 million in its first five years of operation to be spent on housing, increased distribution payments, and more jobs. Beasley Denson rejected Chief Martin’s allegation and criticized his for unilateral decision to erect the Choctaw Coast Casino, as he believed that the Mississippi Band of Choctaws should have been polled on this critical issue. After several attempts to unseat Chief Martin as tribal leader, Mr. Denson achieved his first success in the June 2007 primary. His success was attributed to his ‘door to door’ campaign to discover the salient issues to the voter. The issue of a new chief for the Choctaw tribe will be settled on July 3rd.(The Sun Herald, June 21, 20007, p. A3)\n\nDenson wins\n\nEarly returns from the July 3rd election for Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws demonstrated Beasley Denson, the challenger, leading 1528 votes to 1369 for Chief Philip Martin. Counting of absentee ballots had Chief Martin with 94 votes and Denson with only 39. On July 6th, Chief Martin, the incumbent, conceded the election to Beasley Denson. Unofficial returns had Chief Martin trailing his opponent by 211 votes-Denson 1697 and Martin 1486. He had until July 8th to challenge the election results. Beasley Denson is expected to be sworn in as Tribal Chief on July10th. He would become the third elected tribal chief since the 1830 Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek.(The Sun Herald, July 5, 2007, p. A1 and July 7, 2007, p. A7)\n\nChief Denson pursues Jackson County casino\n\nChief-elect Beasley Densonwas sworn into office at the Silver Star Casino and Convention Center near Philadelphia, Neshoba County, Mississippi. One of Chief Denson’s first statements following his election as leader of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws was to declare that outcome of the non-binding referendum to be held in Jackson County in early November 2007, as regards the construction of a Choctaw casino in the county would be disregarded. He said that the Choctaw people have decided to build a casino on Ms. Highway 57.(The Sun Herald, July 11, 2007, p. A1)\n\nIn mid-July, Franklin Leach, District 4 Supervisor, sent a letter to Chief Denson to request a public hearing on the proposed Jackson County casino. Mr. Leach expressed his desire that the Choctaw leadership respect the results of the November non-binding referendum, proposed by former Chief Philip Martin. Franklin Leach is listening to his constituents as there is a high degree of certitude that they oppose a casino of any kind in Jackson County. He wishes that Chief Denson will development the Mississippi Band of Choctaw lands on Mississippi Highway 57 in a manner that will please and appease the citizen’s who live and work here. It is generally held that Department of the Interior, the ultimate deciding entity for the proposed casino, will listen to the opinion of elected officials and not the results of the November 2007, non-binding referendum. The religious community opines that the local politicians will abide by the wishes of their electorate.(The Sun Herald, July12, 2007, p. A7)\n\nPascagoula powwow\n\nOn August 28, 2007, Miko Beasley Denson, miko is the Choctaw word for chief, met with Mayor Connie Moran of Ocean Springs, Mayor Xavier Bishop of Moss Point, Gautier City Councilman Jeff Wilson, and a group of Jackson County businessmen in Pascagoula. The Choctaw group asked that the details of the ‘powwow’ be kept confidential. The community leaders were exposed to some of the casino plans and illustrations were presented. Miko Denson and staff spoke of the Choctaw printing plant and injection molding company that they operate on their Ms. Highway No. 57 property, and how the revenues from these businesses contribute to the quality of life in Jackson County. They also spoke of their casino could benefit the County. The Jackson County coalition admonished the Mississippi Band of Choctaws that if they are not more specific with their casino plans and more convincing about how gaming will better the lives of the Counties voters, their quest to win the November 6th non-binding referendum on gaming will be a total failure.(The Sun Herald, September 5, 2007, p. A1 and A7)\n\nPascagoula powwow II\n\nMelissa Mullinax, political advisor to Chief Beasley Denson, announced in mid-September 2007, that she had contacted Tim Broussard with the Jackson County Board of Supervisors in regards to a future meeting. The Mississippi Band of Choctaws are poised to present their plans to build a $375 million casino to the Board of Supervisors at their public meeting in the near future. The meeting time with the Jackson County Board of Supervisors was set for September 27th. District 5 Supervisor John McKay related that in order for the Mississippi Band of Choctaws to convince the electorate in Jackson County to favor a casino they must sell the people and provide them with adequate information to make a decision on their proposed gaming project. McKay said that unless more information is coming forth, the voters that participate in the November non-binding referendum “will vote it down big time, but they’ll probably do that anyway.”(The Sun Herald, September 14, 2007, p. A2, September 18, 2007, p. A3)\n\nPublic presentation\n\nOn September 26th, Beasley Denson, Tribal leader of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws and former resident of Pascagoula, addressed the Ocean Springs Rotary Club at its noon luncheon. Here the Mississippi Band of Choctaws $375 million casino resort proposal for east Ocean Springs was unveiled to the public for the first time. In addition to a casino, the Choctaw proposal includes: a hotel movie theatre, convention center, 27-hole golf course, and retail shops and boutiques. Denson related to the one-hundred plus audience that after 3800 construction workers complete their task that 2800 permanent positions will be created at the Choctaw casino which will create $3.3 million dollars in State payroll taxes. He also pledged that impact fees for roads, fire and police protection, and schools will be paid to local governments. Chief Denson was assisted in the casino resort development presentation by John Hendrix, director of economic development for the Choctaw Nation. (The Sun Herald, September 27, 2007, p. A1 and A5)\n\nThe ante\n\nMeeting with the Jackson County Board of Supervisors at Pascagoula, Mississippi on September on September 27, 2007, Chief Beasley Denson offered 4% of the gross revenues from their proposed Mississippi Highway No. 57 casino resort to the citizens of Jackson County. Denson related that he expected that the casino would generate about $7 million for the County and local governments. These funds could provide the money for roads and services that would be needed to support the increase in traffic and population caused by the growth and development from casino gaming within the County. Chief Denson also told the Supervisors that it is the casino operators in Harrison and Hancock County that are opposed to the Choctaw casino and that future employment and revenues for the County are in jeopardy as well as the possibility that tax burdens could be lowered by the additional revenue generated from the Choctaw casino resort.(The Sun Herald, September 28, 2007, p. A1)\n\nThe aint’s\n\nAs the November non-binding referendum approached, several public ? came out against the Choctaw casino resort at Ocean Springs. In early October, The Sun Herald lashed out at Chief Beasley Denson\n\nThe vote\n\nElection held on November 6, 2007.\n\n2011\n\n2008 Moratorium rescinded\n\nIn June 2011, Larry Echo Hawk, assistant secretary for the Bureau Indian Affairs rescinded the 2008 moratorium issued during the Bush presidential administration which blocked an attempt by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to open a casino on their lands in Jackson County, Mississippi. Mr. Hawk stated. \"The 2008 guidance memorandum was unnecessary and was issued without the benefit of tribal consultation. We will proceed to process off-reservation gaming applications in a transparent manner, consistent with exisiting law.\"\n\n2011 Elections\n\nOn June 14, 2011, The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians held an election for their new chief [miko]. Nine candiates ran for the tribe's leadership and a run-off between Beasley Denson, incumbent, and Phyllis J. Anderson will be held in July 2011. Mingo Denson polled 1598 votes and P.J. Anderson garnered 872.(The Sun Herald, June 18, 2011, p. A3)\n\nIn early, September 2011, Phyliss J. Anderson (b. 1961) defeated Beasley Denson (b. 1950) to become the first woman elected as Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws. On July 15, 2011, Ms. Anderson defeated Miko Beasley Denson and Shirley Berg garnering 55% of the vote in a runoff. She had been named the winner, but the results were declared void forcing the September 6, 2011 election. Phyllis Anderson was sworn in as Chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaws on October 5, 2011.(The Sun Herald, September 8, 2011, p. A8 and October 6, 2011, p. A5)\n\nCenter Pointe Non-Denominational Church\n\nPastor Ted Pagel trying to get the church building ready for an October 2, 2011 worship service.(The Sun Herald, September 21, 2011, p.
