She was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, attending High School at Loretto Academy. She obtained her degree in Nursing and graduated from Avila University as a Registered Nurse and dedicated her life to public health. Denise worked for the Johnson County Health Department for over 30 years and her efforts were tireless, persistent and passionate. She served in various capacities in the Public Health Clinic and became a Supervisor, then became a Nurse Epidemiologist after studying at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. She was also the contagious disease info nurse lady on local TV for many years! An incredibly intelligent woman, she never flaunted her vast knowledge and ability to manage massive statistics of various illnesses. In fact, most people did not know and may not have guessed, that she was probably one of the smartest people you could ever meet. She learned by listening and attention to detail. There were four things that were most important to Denise Brennan: her faith in God and her three sons Bill, Matthew and Jason. Somehow, she managed to balance raising these three young men to adulthood while working long hours. She never missed an event or a birthday with a morning call. As her sons had children, she adored each of her precious grandchildren. Anyone who met Denise knows that she truly knew no strangers. She knew everyone in the building, hospital or store that she may have passed through during her life. She had a knack for finding joy and happiness and faced adversity with dignity and faith. She was truly a gentle lady, raised with extreme etiquette, who showed kindness and compassion to each person that she met every day.\n\n1983 (Health Information Management) - In Memoriam: Janet M.
