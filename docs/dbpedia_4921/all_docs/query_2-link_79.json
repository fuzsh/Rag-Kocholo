Scope of Chapter This chapter covers resignations from the House of Representatives (with occasional illustrative instances from the Senate). Also addressed are resignations from committees, boards, and commissions and resignations of certain officers and staff of the House. Because the process of resignation relates to a number of other House procedures, the reader may wish to consult other chapters, particularly those dealing with the assembly of Congress (Ch. 1, supra), party organizations in the House (Ch. 3, supra), officers, officials, and employees (Ch. 6, supra), committees (Ch. 17, supra), and House-Senate conferences (Ch. 33, supra). [Page 351-353] CHAPTER 37 Resignations A. Introduction Sec. 2. Background The resignation of a Member from the House, whether presented to the executive authority of the State concerned or to the Speaker of the House, becomes effective on its stated terms and ordinarily may not be withdrawn.(1) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 1213 and 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. 65 (addressing whether a proposal to withdraw a resignation may be privileged). Extracts from the Judiciary Committee report in 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. 65 state without citation that resignations are ``self-acting'' and may not be withdrawn. In one case a Member was not permitted by the House to withdraw a resignation. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 1213. However, the House has allowed withdrawal in the case of defective resignation. 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. 229 (Member had not actually transmitted, or withdrawal had overtaken, letter of resignation); Sec. 5.1, infra (Member had transmitted resignation to improper State official). A Member may appoint a future date for his resignation to take effect and, until the arrival of the date, participate in the proceedings of the House. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 1220-1225, 1228, 1229; 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. Sec. 227, 228; Sec. 5.1, infra. The modern practice of resignations with prospective effective dates has engendered a possible distinction between those including explicit language of irrevocability and others (see Sec. 5, infra). For a State to prospectively perceive a vacancy by reason of a prospective resignation, it presumably must be assured that the resignation is irrevocable. A Member may include in a letter of prospective resignation a statement of intention that the resignation be ``irrevocable'' in order to allay any concern about the prospect of withdrawal. See 147 Cong. Rec. 9892, 107th Cong. 1st Sess., June 5, 2001; 149 Cong. Rec. 1750, 1751, 107th Cong. 1st Sess., Jan. 27, 2003; and Sec. 5.1, infra. In some cases executive authorities of States have been able to issue writs of election on the basis of time- contingent resignations, thereby producing Representatives- elect to fill vacancies almost immediately (see Sec. 5.1, infra [Rep. Neugebauer succeeding Rep. Combest]). In at least one case a Representative-elect was chosen to fill a vacancy even before the vacancy existed in fact (see Sec. 5.1, infra [Rep. Sullivan succeeding Rep. Largent]). In Sec. 5.6, infra, a resignation was effective on the election of a successor (Virginia; Dec. 1, 1944). In Sec. 5.7, infra, a resignation was effective on the scheduling of a special election (South Carolina; Jan. 18, 1965). In Sec. 5.12, infra, a delayed effective date for a resignation was disallowed (New York; Nov. 26, 1951). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 352]] Acceptance of the resignation of a Member is unnecessary, and the refusal of the executive authority of a State to accept a resignation does not operate to continue membership in the House of the individual who submitted the resignation.(2) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. 65. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The resignation of an individual from office as a Representative creates a vacancy in the representation in the House of Representatives from the resigned Representative's State within the meaning of clause 4, Sec. 2 of art. I of the Constitution, such that the executive authority thereof may issue a writ of election.(3) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. On occasion a Member who resigned has been reelected to the same House. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 1210, 1212, 1256; 111 Cong. Rec. 1452, 89th Cong. 1st Sess. Jan. 28, 1965; 111 Cong. Rec. 13774, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., June 16, 1965; 129 Cong. Rec. 114, 98th Cong. 1st Sess., Jan. 6, 1983; and 129 Cong. Rec. 2575, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., Feb. 22, 1983. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Letters of resignation are presented as privileged.(4) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 1167. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A Member may submit his resignation whenever he or she considers it necessary, whether the House is in session or adjourned. A resignation ordinarily becomes effective on its stated terms or on receipt by the executive authority of the State concerned. The fact that the House is not in session to receive notification of a resignation does not delay a resigning Member's appointment to another office.(5) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Compare 117 Cong. Rec. 32413, 92d Cong. 1st Sess., Sept. 20, 1971 and 117 Cong. Rec. 32239, 92d Cong. 1st Sess., Sept. 17, 1971 (relating to the appointment to the Senate of Mr. Robert T. Stafford [VT], who previously had submitted his resignation to the House). See also Sec. 5.11, infra, where the resignation of Rep. Melvin R. Laird (WI) bearing the date of his swearing in as Secretary of Defense, was laid before the House two days later. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 353]] The first resignation from the House took place in 1791, after lengthy debate as to its permissibility.(6) The British Parliament did not allow resignations,(7) and it was asserted in the House that the U.S. Congress should adhere to this practice. However, the view prevailed that there was little analogy between the House of Representatives and Parliament and, further, that the U.S. Constitution does not prohibit the resignation of a Member of Congress. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 1230. 7. See Todd, Alpheus, Practices and Privileges of Parliament, Rogers & Thompson, Toronto, 1840, pp. 89-91. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is desirable that a Member's resignation be sent to the House as well as the executive authority of the Member's State. It is necessary, on one hand, for the executive authority of the State to know when a Member resigns so the executive authority can fulfill the constitutional obligation to issue a writ of election to fill the vacant seat and, on the other hand, for the House to know of the resignation so that its records may accurately reflect the current membership.(8) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 2; Rule XX clause 5(d), House Rules and Manual Sec. 1024b (2007). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A Member who is resigning generally submits the Member's resignation simultaneously to the House and to the executive authority of the Member's State. When this is not done, it is customary for whomever has received the resignation to notify the other.(9) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. Sec. 3.2, infra. See also Ch. 8, Sec. Sec. 9.1-9.3, supra. When a Member purports to resign directly to the Speaker, rather than to the pertinent official of the Member's State, the Executive authority of the State concerned is notified. House Rules and Manual Sec. 22 (2007). When a Member does not inform the House, the Executive authority of the Member's State has done so. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 1193, 1194; 6 Cannon's Precedents Sec. 232. On occasion the House has learned of the resignation of a Member by the presentation of credentials of the Member's successor. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 1195, 1356. When the fact of a resignation has not appeared either from the credentials of a successor or otherwise, the Clerk has been ordered to inquire, or the House has ascertained the vacancy from information given by other Members. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 354]] [Page 354-373] CHAPTER 37 Resignations B. Resignation of a Member From the House Sec. 3. Procedures and Forms A Member customarily resigns from the House by transmitting a letter of resignation directly to the executive authority of the Member's State and customarily informs the House that he has done so by letter to the Speaker, the latter communication being satisfactory evidence of the Member's resignation.(1) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 2 Hinds' Precedents Sec. Sec. 1167-1176; 1 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 567. When the executive authority of the State concerned takes cognizance of a resignation, that executive declares a vacancy and issues a writ of election to fill it. U.S. Const. art. I, Sec. 2, clause 4; Ch. 8, Sec. 9, supra. The House in the 108th Congress changed Rule XX clause 5 to codify the longstanding practice that the whole number of the House is reduced when a vacancy arises. The change also provided that the Speaker announce such reduction (without appeal) and lay before the House any documentation he might deem pertinent. See 149 Cong. Rec. 9, 10, 108th Cong. 1st Sess., Jan. 7, 2003. The House also adopted changes to Rule I clause 8(b), House Rules and Manual Sec. 632 (2007) for the event of a vacancy in the Office of Speaker. See Ch. 38, Sec. Sec. 1, 2.2, infra. ------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Resignations Submitted to the Executive Authority of a State; Procedure Sec. 3.1 A Member properly submits his resignation from the House to an official designated by State law and simply informs the House of his doing so, the latter communication being satisfactory evidence of the resignation,(1) and the Speaker lays before the House a letter from a Member transmitting a copy of his resignation by letter to the executive authority of his State. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 1 Hinds' Precedents Sec. 567. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Jan. 20, 2004,(2) the following proceedings occurred: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 150 Cong. Rec. 65, 108th Cong. 2d Sess. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES The SPEAKER laid before the House the following resignation from the House of Representatives: Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, January 14, 2004.

Hon Pete Wilson, Governor, State Capitol, Sacramento, CA. Dear Mr. Governor: Obviously, you are aware of the recent turn of events in my life. While I finally received my day in court, I, unfortunately, was not judged by a jury of my peers and in my opinion, did not receive a just verdict. Nevertheless, that verdict is a reality pending appeal. As I stated to the media immediately after my verdict, it was never my intention to put the Congress through a vote on expulsion if I were convicted. Therefore, I am hereby tending my resignation as representative of the 37th Congressional district effective December 15, 1995. Contrary to what anyone has ever said or intimated, I have never sold out my constituency or my oath of office. I am fully persuaded that in the near future God will vindicate my name.

Receipt During Adjournment Sine Die Sec. 3.4 When the Speaker, during a period of adjournment, receives notice of the resignation of a Member from the House, he informs the House when it reconvenes. On Aug. 16, 1960,(1) following the adjournment of the 86th Congress, the resignation of a Member was laid before the House as follows: 1. 106 Cong. Rec. 16535, 86th Cong. 2d Sess. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- August 8, 1960. Hon. Sam Rayburn, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. Dear Sir: I hereby resign my office as Representative in the Congress of the United States from North Dakota. Respectfully, Quentin N. Burdick. Parliamentarian's Note: On this occasion, the Speaker announced to the House that, pursuant to a previous order of the House authorizing the Speaker to accept resignations during the August recess of the House, he had, on Aug. [[Page 363]] 8, 1960, accepted the resignation of Mr. Burdick as a Representative and had informed the Governor of North Dakota of the receipt of said resignation. However, in this case the Speaker misspoke, with respect to acceptance of the resignation, as the Speaker's authority to accept resignations during a recess is applicable to House officers and employees and other positions as to which the Speaker makes appointments, and not to Members, as to whose resignations no acceptance is necessary. On Jan. 7, 1959,(2) the resignations of certain Members, submitted after sine die adjournment of the 85th Congress, were laid before the House by the Speaker following the organization of the 86th Congress. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 105 Cong.

Dear Mr. Speaker: I hereby resign as a Member of the House of Representatives of the United States, effective at 12 o'clock midnight, December 31, 1958. Very truly yours, Henry J. Latham. Sec. 3.5 The Speaker lays before the House, or, in case the House has adjourned sine die, submits for the Congressional Record following such adjournment, a letter from a Member advising of his resignation (usually accompanied by a copy of the actual letter of resignation that the Member submitted to the State official concerned).(1) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Parliamentarian's Note: Although the letter was dated Dec. 8 (the last day of the first session), the original was not received that day. Thus, the Speaker was not able to lay the letter down and make an announcement of the reduced whole number of the House under Rule XX clause 5(c) (now 5(d)), House Rules and Manual Sec. 1024b (2007). He did make that announcement before the call of the roll at the start of the second session. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- On Dec. 15, 2003,(2) the following proceedings occurred: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. 149 Cong. Rec. 32411, 108th Cong. 1st Sess. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 364]] Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, December 8, 2003. The Speaker, House of Representatives, The Capitol, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Speaker: It has been a privilege to work with you. I am grateful for the support, guidance and opportunities you have provided during my years in the House--especially by allowing me to play a leadership role in so many important healthcare initiatives. As I begin a new path in Kentucky, I will appreciate even more the trials of leadership and the courage of conviction you have exemplified. Thank you for your friendship, and know that I have come to admire the gracious and professional manner in which you lead the House. During the past 5 years, I have had the great honor to serve as the Representative for the people of the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky. My service in the U.S. Congress has been a rewarding professional experience. I thank every one of my constituents who put their trust and faith in my leadership. Having recently been selected by the people of Kentucky to serve as the next Governor of that great Commonwealth, I will resign my seat representing the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky effective, upon taking the gubernatorial oath of office at midnight on Tuesday, December 9, 2003. I look forward to working with the distinguished Members of the House in my new position, and have appreciated their friendship, support, and collegiality during my years in Congress. Sincerely, Ernie Fletcher, Member of Congress. Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, December 8, 2003. Hon. Paul Patton, Governor, Commonwealth of Kentucky, Frankfort, KY. Dear Governor Patton: For the past five years, it has been my honor and privilege to serve the people of Central Kentucky in the U.S. House of Representatives. This past November, I was offered another opportunity to serve the Commonwealth of Kentucky as the next Governor. I hereby wish to tender my resignation as Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District Representative effective upon taking the gubernatorial oath of office on Tuesday, December 9, 2003. Sincerely, Ernie Fletcher, Member of Congress. On Jan. 20, 2004,(3) at the convening of the House on the day set for commencement of the second session, the Speaker called the House to order and, following the opening prayer and without motion from the floor, ordered a call of the House to establish a quorum. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. 150 Cong. Rec. 64-66, 108th Cong. 2d Sess. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Where a resignation letter had been received by the Speaker and printed in the Congressional Record following sine die adjournment of the first session, the [[Page 365]] Speaker announced a reduction in the whole number of the House pursuant to Rule XX clause 5(c)(4) before the call of the House to establish a quorum. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. House Rules and Manual Sec. 1024b (2007). Rule XX clause 5(c) was redesignated Rule XX clause 5(d) in the 109th Congress. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Parliamentarian's Note: Because Rep. Fletcher's resignation was effective before the instant day and because his letter was printed in the interim Congressional Record between sessions, his name was removed from the Clerk's roll before its call. Contrast this with the case on the roll of Rep. Janklow, whose letter was laid down this day (See Sec. 3.1, supra), but whose resignation was not effective until midnight: his name was included on the roll, and the Speaker announced the adjustment to the whole number of the House on the next day.(5) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. See 150 Cong. Rec. 137, 108th Cong. 2d Sess., Jan. 21, 2004. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER The SPEAKER. Under clause 5(c) of rule XX, the Chair announces to the House that, in light of the resignation of the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Fletcher), as indicated in the Record of December 15, 2003, the whole number of the House is adjusted to 434. Sec. 3.6 At the beginning of a new session, the Speaker calls the House to order and, after the opening prayer, lays before the House any letters notifying the Speaker of resignations from the House since the last meeting of the House. On Jan. 15, 1968,(1) the Speaker laid before the House communications from two Congressmen(2) tendering their resignations. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 114 Cong. Rec. 7, 90th Cong. 2d Sess. 2.

Dear Mr. Speaker: Herewith please find copy of my resignation submitted to the Secretary of State, State of New York, as required by law, effective January 1, 1968.

Johnson, Governor of the State of Mississippi, tendering my resignation as a Member of the United States House of Representatives effective on my taking the oath of office as Governor of Mississippi on January 16, 1968. Mr. Speaker, I came to the Congress believing it to be the greatest deliberative body on earth. After twenty-one years, I will leave the Congress even more secure in that belief. I cherish the many friendships I have made here; and I take this means through you to express profound appreciation to my colleagues for their friendships and courtesies throughout the years. My service in this body has brought satisfaction in accomplishment, disappointment in defeat, heartache in frustration, and joy in triumph. In all, [[Page 367]] Mr. Speaker, these have been the most interesting and rewarding years of my life. I will always be thankful for the privilege of having been a part of this great institution. As I leave the Congress to assume a public position of greater responsibility, I seek the prayers and good will of you and my colleagues as we strive in common purpose to build a greater and finer Republic. With sincere best wishes, I am, Respectfully, John Bell Williams. Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., January 1, 1968. Hon. Paul B.

Dear Governor Johnson: I hereby tender to you my resignation as a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States from the Third District of Mississippi, to become effective on January 16, 1968, on my taking the oath of office as Governor of the State Of Mississippi. Respectfully yours, John Bell Williams. Sec. 3.7 Election of a new Speaker being the first order of business when a new Congress convenes (or when the Office of Speaker is otherwise vacant), the resignation of a Member received during an adjournment sine die is not laid down before the election of a Speaker (although the names of resigned Members are stricken from the roll and are not called to establish a quorum or to elect the Speaker). On Jan. 10, 1962,(1) at the convening of the second session of the 87th Congress, the Clerk, Ralph R. Roberts, called for nominations for the Office of Speaker. Nominations were made, a vote taken, and a Speaker elected. The newly elected Speaker(2) then laid before the House resignations of Members from the House received during the adjournment sine die between the first and second sessions of the 87th Congress: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 108 Cong. Rec. 7, 87th Cong. 2d Sess.

Sec. 3.8 When the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico resigns from the House, the resulting vacancy is filled, pursuant to Federal law, by appointment by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, subject to confirmation by the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. On Mar. 4, 1992,(1) the Speaker laid before the House a letter from the Resident Commissioner to the United States from Puerto Rico, giving notice of his resignation, and a letter from the Governor announcing the appointment by the Governor of a new Resident Commissioner.(2) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. 138 Cong. Rec. 4386, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. 2. Appointment (rather than special election) to fill a vacancy in the position of Resident Commissioner is provided for by law (Sec. 36 of Act of Mar. 2, 1917; 48 USC Sec. 892). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Members representing the New York City areas of Harlem and the Bronx were invited by the Speaker to escort the newly appointed Resident Commissioner to the well to be sworn in.

So help you God. The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are a Member of the House of Representatives. Sec. 3.9 State law may require that the State executive authority to whom a Member's resignation is to be submitted is the State secretary of State rather than the Governor. By letter to the Secretary of State of New York dated Nov. 7, 1997,(1) Rep. Floyd H. Flake resigned as a Member effective Nov. 16, 1997.

Hon. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House, The Capitol, H-232, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Speaker: This missive comes as an official announcement of my resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives, effective October 15, 1997. My duties and responsibilities as pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, New York, has grown to such a level that I am needed there on a more consistent basis. I have enjoyed the opportunities that you have given me to converse with you regarding my ideas for community, education, and economic development. I hope that my leaving does not preclude our ability [[Page 370]] to, in some way, continue these discussions in the future. With warmest regards, I am Sincerely, Floyd H. Flake, Member of Congress. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, August 1, 1997. Hon. George E. Pataki, State of New York, Office of the Governor, Albany, NY Dear Governor Pataki. This missive comes as an official announcement of my resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives, effective October 15, 1997. My duties and responsibilities as pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church have grown to a level which necessitates my presence on a more consistent basis. I have called your office, and hope to be able to speak with you in the near future. With warmest regards, I am Sincerely, Floyd H. Flake, Member of Congress. . . . Congress of the United States, House of Representatives Washington, DC, October 8, 1997. Hon. Alexander Treadwell, Secretary of State, Albany, NY. Dear Secretary Treadwell: After considering the needs of my constituents and the short time remaining in this session, I intend to remain in Congress at least until our legislative business is completed. I have reviewed section 31 of the Public Officers law, and I understand that my retirement announcement to the Governor on August 4, 1997 was an erroneous interpretation of the statutory requirements for resignations. Therefore, it is also my belief that, according to section 31, any record of my resignation is not effective since I have never directly notified your office of my plans. I will, however, inform you of my plans at the appropriate time, which in this case will be no more than thirty days prior to my resignation. If there are any questions regarding my plans, please feel free to contact me, or Sean Peterson, my Chief of Staff. With warmest regards, I am Sincerely, Floyd H. Flake, Member of Congress. House of Representatives, Washington, DC, November 7, 1997. Hon. Alexander Treadwell, Secretary of State, Albany, NY. Dear Secretary Treadwell: Pursuant to section 31 of the Public Officers law, I hereby inform you that I am resigning from the United States House of Representatives. My resignation will become effective at midnight on November 16, 1997. As you and the citizens of New York are well aware, I am returning to my pastorate at the Allen A.M.E. church in Jamaica, Queens. Although I have been called back to Allen to devote my energy and full-time attention to its congregation, I am proud of my service in Congress. It has been my distinct privilege to represent the people of the 6th Congressional District of New York, and an honor to serve the people of the United States of America. [[Page 371]] With warmest regards, I am Sincerely, Floyd H. Flake, Member of Congress.

Reason for Resignation; Inclusion in Letter of Resignation When a Member resigns as a Representative, the basis of, or reasons for, the Member's resignation may or may not be included in the Member's letter of resignation. In recent years, the general practice has been for a Member resigning from the House to include in the Member's letter of resignation the reasons for the Member's termination of service in the House. Among the reasons for which Members have resigned have been to serve in the Armed Forces,(1) to accept an appointment as a cabinet secretary or in another Executive branch position,(2) to assume office as a Member of the Senate,(3) to accept an appointment as a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations,(4) or as an ambassador to another nation,(5) to assume office as a State Governor or city Mayor,(6) to accept an appointment as a Federal(7) or State(8) judge, to create a vacancy and run for the vacant seat, in the case of a change in party affiliation (9) or a contested election,(10) to serve a jail sentence on conviction of a crime,(11) and, in the case of a Senator, to create a vacancy to be filled by appointment by a State Governor.(12) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

I have also written to Governor Schwarzenegger to advise him of my resignation.

I thank the people of the First District for the opportunity to serve them, this country and this institution. It has been a great honor. Thank you. Sincerely, Thomas M. Foglietta. . . .
