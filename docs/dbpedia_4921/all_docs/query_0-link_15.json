Due to his courage, intelligence, discrimination and zeal, he successfully led his men up the cliffs by means of bamboo ladders to a height of 200 feet. The cliffs were of soft stone of volcanic origin, in the nature of pumice and were honeycombed with caves. Tons of rocks were suspended in platforms held in position by vine cables (known as bejues) in readiness to be precipitated upon people below. After driving the insurgents from their position which was almost impregnable, being covered with numerous trails lined with poisoned spears, pits, etc, he led his men across the river, sealed the cliffs on the opposite side, and destroyed the camps there. He and the men under his command overcame incredible difficulties and dangers in destroying positions which, according to reports from old prisoners, had taken three years to perfect, were held as a final rallying point, and were never before penetrated by white troops. General Bearss also rendered distinguished public service in the presence of the enemy at Quinapundan River, Samar, PI, on January 19, 1902.”\n\nDuring World War I, he served with distinction in command of the 102nd infantry, 52nd Brigade, 26th Division, American Expeditionary Forces, France.
