        "text": "General Lyndon Buckingham and Commissioner Bronwyn Buckingham\n\nThe Salvation Army International Headquarters\n\nGeneral Lyndon Buckingham and Commissioner Bronwyn Buckingham, originally from the New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga and Samoa Territory, are passionate representatives of The Salvation Army.\n\nThey have served as officers since they were commissioned in 1990 as members of the Ambassadors for Christ Session. Commissioner Lyndon was appointed Chief of the Staff on 3 August 2018 and Commissioner Bronwyn as World Secretary for Spiritual Life Development on 1 January 2021, having previously served as World Secretary for Women’s Ministries.\n\nThey assumed their current responsibilities as General and World President of Women’s Ministries on 3 August 2023.\n\nOver the years of their officership they have served in corps appointments in New Zealand and Canada, as Territorial Youth and Candidates Secretaries, Divisional Leaders and Territorial Programme Secretaries.\n\nOn 1 February 2013 the Buckinghams were appointed to the Singapore, Malaysia and Myanmar Territory, firstly as Chief Secretary and Territorial Secretary for Women’s Ministries respectively, before assuming territorial leadership in June 2013. On 1 January 2018 they were appointed to lead the United Kingdom and Ireland Territory, Commissioner Lyndon Buckingham as Territorial Commander and Commissioner Bronwyn Buckingham as Territorial Leader for Leader Development.\n\nBronwyn and Lyndon are blessed to be parents and grandparents. They are continually encouraged and challenged by the desire of their adult children to serve God in their generation.\n\nIn each of their appointments the Buckinghams have displayed a desire to see the great news of the gospel shared.\n\nBronwyn is inspired by the belief that God has a new truth to reveal to her daily and compelled by the promise that he is continuing to grow and stretch her (Philippians 1:6 NIV). She desires to be the woman God is calling her to be and is passionate to be part of an Army where the next generation will choose to embrace their leadership calling.\n\nLyndon is passionate about finding ways for The Salvation Army to be more effective in fulfilling its mission. He is determined to be faithful to the covenants he has made and is motivated by verses from Paul’s letter to the Colossians: ‘Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men’ (Colossians 3:23 NIV 1984).\n\nBoth are intent on enjoying life, endeavoring to stay fit by walking and rowing. They enjoy reading, watching good movies and are avid supporters of New Zealand’s ‘All Blacks’ rugby union team!\n\nCommissioners Kenneth G. and Jolene K. Hodder\n\nThe Salvation Army National Headquarters\n\nCommissioners Kenneth and Jolene Hodder serve as the National Commander and National Secretary for Program, respectively, for The Salvation Army in the United States.\n\nAs National Commander, Commissioner Kenneth Hodder oversees the work of two million officers, soldiers, employees and volunteers at almost 7,000 local units that provide help to more than 24 million people across the country each year. He represents the organization to the Federal government, the corporate community, and the nonprofit sector, and he has served as a member of the DHS Faith-Based Security Advisory Council, testifying before Congress in 2022 on the needs of veterans. Commissioner Hodder serves on the Boards of Directors for the Christian Leadership Alliance and the National Association of Evangelicals, and he is a member of the Generosity Commission, Leadership 18, and the JustServe National Advisory Council.\n\nIn 2023, Commissioner Hodder was selected by The NonProfit Times as one of the top 50 nonprofit leaders in the nation. A sixth-generation Salvationist, he is a graduate of Harvard College (A.B. magna cum laude, 1980) and Harvard Law School (J.D., 1983).\n\nAs National Secretary for Program, Commissioner Jolene Hodder is responsible for the development and national coordination of a wide variety of operations, including evangelism, church growth, youth character-building programs, and women’s ministries. She also serves as The Salvation Army’s representative for She Leads America, Christian Churches Together, and the JustServe National Advisory Council.\n\nCommissioner Jolene Hodder holds a Bachelor of Science degree from California State University, Los Angeles (1982), and a Master of Religion degree from Trevecca Nazarene University (2018). She is also the author of three books, Walking in White, A Bend in the Road and Sensational Grace.\n\nCommissioners Hodder have been Salvation Army officers for more than 35 years, with appointments throughout the United States, Kenya, and the United Kingdom.\n\nSalvation Army Officers\n\nOperations of The Salvation Army are supervised by trained, commissioned officers. They proclaim the gospel and serve as administrators, teachers, social workers, counselors, youth leaders, and musicians.\n\nThese men and women have dedicated their lives, skills, and service completely to God. Lay members who subscribe to the doctrines of The Salvation Army are called soldiers. Along with officers, they are known as Salvationists.\n\nCandidates for officership undergo an intensive two-year course in residence at Salvation Army colleges in Chicago; Suffern, New York; Atlanta; and Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The curriculum combines theory and field practice, including Salvation Army doctrine, sociology and social work, psychology, Salvation Army regulations, homiletics, public speaking, Bible studies, church history, composition, community relations, business administration, accounting, and vocal and instrumental music.\n\nAfter two successful years of training, cadets are commissioned as lieutenants, ordained as ministers, and assigned to active duty while continuing their education. Lieutenants are required to devote five years to additional studies.\n\nNumerous advanced training courses are available for officers wishing to specialize in a particular discipline. Institutes, seminars, and conferences have been established to ensure that officers are informed of new and innovative programs and developments.\n\nPromotion is based on length of service, character, efficiency, capacity for increased responsibility, and devotion to duty. The ranks are lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and commissioner. The international leader holds the rank of general and is selected by a high council of active-duty commissioner and territorial commanders.\n\nSalvation Army officers must devote full time to Army work. An officer who marries must marry another Salvation Army officer or leave his or her officer status. Married captains and majors will individually carry the rank applicable to their own length of service, not that of their spouse. In case of married officers, the conferred ranks of lieutenant colonel, colonel, and commissioner will be held jointly. As ordained ministers of the gospel, they are authorized to perform marriage ceremonies, funeral services, and infant dedications. They also provide counseling and consolation to the bereaved.\n\nThe Salvation Army provides officers' living quarters, furnishings, and official transportation. Officers qualify for retirement once they are eligible to receive full Social Security benefits.\n\nSalvation Army Soldiers\n\nThe soldiers of The Salvation Army (wearing blue epaulets), the committed laity, are local citizens in communities throughout the U.S. who give allegiance to the doctrines and disciplines of the Army. There are approximately 450,000 soldiers in the United States.\n\nThese soldiers may take on volunteer responsibilities in the congregation or help in the Army's social service outreach. Many soldiers give valuable service in directing and leading youth groups in character-building activities. Many take part in the Army's musical programs and teach young people to sing and play.\n\nAs a valuable means of service to the community, soldiers visit the sick and lonely in hospitals, nursing homes, and correctional institutions. Social service programs are enhanced by the commitment of soldiers who often give their time in the Army's basic ministries of shelter and food provision.\n\nSoldiers abstain from the use of alcoholic beverages, drugs, and tobacco. Trained and qualified soldiers are appointed as \"local officers.\" This corresponds to a non-commissioned officer in the armed forces. Other members of the congregation are adherents who participate in church activities but have not signed on as soldiers. Adherents may take on some lay responsibilities, such as teaching Sunday School classes.\n\nVolunteers\n\nFrom its inception, The Salvation Army has relied heavily on volunteers who support its programs. Often referred to as \"the army behind The Army,\" volunteers play a crucial role The Salvation Army's ability to provide quality social services for the entire community.\n\nVolunteers are valuable assets in The Salvation Army's efforts to meet the changing needs of our world. Through the skills and experience they bring to The Army, volunteers make significant contributions to society by positively impacting the lives of those they assist. Salvation Army volunteers change lives, uplift families, and support communities throughout our nation every day.\n\nThank you for exploring the many opportunities to help those in need and enhance your community as a volunteer within The Salvation Army."
