        "text": "For the rank structure of the Original Series and 1980, see Military Ranks (TOS) and Military Ranks (1980)\n\nRank table\n\nThis table was originally based on an older blog entry by Ronald D. Moore posted in 2005, in which he replies to a question about the show's rank structure (see Official Statements below). It has been expanded and altered since that time to include additional ranks that have been established since then (lieutenant colonel, rear admiral) and heavily supplemented by sources close to the show as well as a recently released rank pin chart. It should be noted that some of the ranks on the pin chart are listed differently elsewhere on this page for practical reasons. In some cases this is done because the rank given on the pin chart is assumed to represent a position rather than a specific rank (i.e. the only reference to term senior chief on screen (in \"Blood on the Scales\") appears to use it as a position rather than a rank, since only Tyrol holds the position of senior chief but both he and Peter Laird are chief petty officers) or because the the rank on the pin chart is consistently referred to differently on screen (i.e. crew specialist has always been referred to as specialist).\n\nThe ranks are a mix of naval and marine ranks inherited from the Original Series, but mirror naval practices in execution and are elaborated during the series both on-screen and in production notes. It is possible to create a rough equivalence to real world armed forces. However, while the Colonial Fleet has many parallels with modern armed forces it is a fictional organization and diverges from reality in certain places, for example in the duties of commanders and admirals, or the place of the CAG within the ship's hierarchy.\n\nThe officer ranks of the Colonial Marine Corps (CMC) have yet to be established on screen (with the exception of lieutenant) or by official sources and thus are not listed here. The Marine Corps's enlisted ranks largely mirror real world ranks.

With more recent device created by members of the battle star wiki community using his original designs as templates.\n\nSenior officers' ranks can also be identified by the color of the piping on their uniforms. The rank for lieutenant colonel is depicted as worn by Jack Fisk in \"Razor\", although the same insignia has also been worn by others with the simple junior officer white piping.[4]\n\nProduction images\n\nSenior Commissioned Officers\n\nLieutenant Colonel\n\nJunior Commissioned Officers\n\nJr. Lieutenant/\n\nEnsign\n\nWarrant Officer\n\nWarrant Officer\n\nSenior Enlisted Personnel/Non-Commissioned Officers\n\nMaster Chief (CF)\n\nSenior Chief (CF)\n\nSergeant First Class (CMC)\n\nCrew Sergeant (CMC)\n\nJunior Enlisted Personnel\n\nSpecialist (CF)\n\nCrewman (CF)\n\nCrewman Apprentice (CF)\n\nAs mentioned above some of these ranks differ from that listed elsewhere on Battlestar Wiki for practicality purposes. In addition it is important to remember that each enlisted device corresponds to two ranks: the colonial fleet version and its colonial marine corps rank equivalent.\n\nOfficial Statements\n\nIn a blog entry on February 19, 2005 Ronald Moore gave a little insight into the rank structure of Battlestar Galactica:\n\n\"What is the rank structure? It doesn't seem consistant [sic] with the Navy.\"\n\nThe rank structure is derived from the original series. I didn't want to change Commander Adama to Captain Adama or Colonel Tigh to Commander Tigh, so I elected to simply embrace the co-mingled nature of the original rank structure. For our internal purposes, we've decided that the ranks are indeed a mixture of naval and army nomenclature and are basically as follows:\n\nOfficers:\n\nAdmiral\n\nCommander\n\nColonel\n\nMajor\n\nCaptain\n\nLieutenant\n\nLieutenant Junior Grade\n\nEnsign\n\nEnlisted:\n\nMaster Chief Petty Officer\n\nChief Petty Officer\n\nPetty Officer (1st, 2nd Class)\n\nSpecialist\n\nDeck Hand\n\nRecruit\n\nJust to complicate matters further, there are also Marines aboard Galactica which conform more closely to the traditional enlisted Marine ranks, with Sergeants, Sergeant-Majors (sic), etc. Unresolved is the question of whether the Marine officers would also adhere to the mixed rank structure (which sounds odd) or if they are strictly army equivalents (which makes no sense given that the \"Navy\" ranks seem oblivious to there being any such distinction). Aren't you glad you asked?\n\nSee Also\n\nUniforms (RDM) - Uniforms of the Re-imagined Series.\n\nInsignia (RDM) - Additional insignia and patches for uniforms in the Re-Imagined Series.\n\nMilitary Ranks (TOS) - Ranks of the Original Series.\n\nA detailed analysis of Battlestar Galactica's uniform devices by Jim Stevenson.
