        "text": "Major General, Lieutenant Colonel, Captain — all common military ranks you’ve probably encountered before; but where do these ranks fall in the chain of command, and why are they important?\n\nWhen interacting with military personnel to influence policy or enter the military contracting space, it is important to have a general awareness of how the armed forces are organized. Outside of the military, departments and agencies use appointment types, and top offices are usually headed by a requiring Senate confirmation (PAS), Senior Executive Service (SES) member, or Schedule-C appointee. However, in the military, each service branch has its own complex structure.\n\nNevertheless, most military organizations follow a clearly defined, rank-based hierarchy, meaning one of the best ways to gain insight into where a service member sits in that hierarchy is by — you guessed it — examining rank. Rank highlights a service member’s responsibility and authority.\n\nAnother significant part of this equation is pay grade, which offers further insight into levels of seniority. By comparing military ranks and pay grades to civilian pay grades, you can strategically contact the right people in the military who wield authority and have a voice in decision-making.\n\nAfter you’ve identified rank, it’s on to military pay grade. While pay grades are administrative classifications used for salary purposes, they are also tied to ranks. U.S. military pay grades are the same for each branch:\n\nEnlisted Personnel (E1-to E-9)\n\nComprised of junior enlisted, non-commissioned officer (NCO) and senior NCO ranks, enlisted service members make up more than 80% of the military and are responsible for carrying out missions.\n\nWarrant Officers (W-1 to W-5)\n\nLess common than enlisted service members and officers, warrant officers rank above non-commissioned officers and serve as highly skilled technical experts in areas like engineering and intelligence.\n\nCommissioned Officers (O-1 to O-10)\n\nOccupying the highest ranks in the chain of command, commissioned officers require additional training and education. Officers manage and lead enlisted personnel, and are also comprised of three tiers.\n\nCivilian/Military Equivalent Rates\n\nSo, how do civilian pay scales come into play with military ranks and pay grades? Although the military follows a different pay structure than civilians, pay scale information is still comparable:\n\nCivilian Grade Military Grade Military Rank GS-13 O-4 Major, Lieutenant Commander GS-14 O-5 Lieutenant Colonel, Commander GS-15 O-6 Colonel, Captain SES (ES Level V) O-7 Brigadier General, Rear Admiral Lower Half SES (ES Level IV) O-8 Major General, Rear Admiral Upper Half SES (ES Level III) O-9 Lieutenant General, Vice Admiral SES (ES Levels I and II) O-10 General, Admiral\n\nAt the top of the chain of command, pay grades O-7 through O-10 can be compared to the Senior Executive Service (SES) and consist of the most senior-level commissioned military personnel — flag and general officers. Generals and admirals (grade O-10) technically fall under SES Level 1, but these ranks align more with PAS in terms of authority.\n\nBecause it can be more difficult to schedule a meeting or develop a relationship with a PAS appointee or with a member of the SES due to busy schedules and constant messages from various vendors, targeting a GS-13-15 may prove to be more successful.\n\nThese senior GS roles are comprised of supervisory positions that wield influence and have direct access to SES appointees, Schedule Cs, and other policymakers. In the military, grades O-4 through O-6 are equivalent to GS-13 through GS-15.\n\nThese ranks also make up most military and special assistant positions that directly support military leaders. In addition, other junior officers in equivalent or lower grades may serve in support roles, such as Aide-de-Camp or Military Aide.\n\nPlanning the Call\n\nRegardless of whether you plan on contacting military or civilian defense leaders, comprehending rank dynamics will lead to better interactions overall. Remember, preparing a strategy is essential, especially with shifting dynamics across the globe. Knowing who to contact, when to contact them, and having alternatives to accomplish your mission will be key in short-term and long-term policymaking."
