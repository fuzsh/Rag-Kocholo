        "text": "Helen Gene Ford Ansari, Lillie Burney, Oliver William Johnson, II and Marjorie & Alfonso Clark\n\nHelen Gene Ford\n\nHelen Gene Ford, a 1971 graduate of L.J. Rowan and Jackson State University student, was crowned the nation’s Miss Black America in 1975. At Jackson State, Ms. Ford was one of the original Prancing J-settes.\n\nLillie Burney\n\nLillie Burney served as an educator for almost half a century. For 37 years, she was the Principal at Mary Bethune Elementary in Hattiesburg, MS. She retired on February 28, 1959 which was her 70th birthday. Her commitment to educating the children of Hattiesburg was so valued that in 1963, the Hattiesburg Public School District named a Junior High School in her honor.\n\nOliver William Johnson II\n\nOliver William Johnson II was a Eureka Junior High graduate and a 1958 graduate of Rowan High School. He attended Alcorn A&M College where he was a drummer in the marching band and a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity. After graduation from college, he taught various classes and coached several sports at Earl Travilion before becoming a teacher and the baseball coach at North Forrest High School. At North Forrest, he led his baseball team to four consecutive state championships.
