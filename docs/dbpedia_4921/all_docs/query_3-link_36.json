        "text": "The military services use military rank to signify a service members level of leadership and the responsibilities inherent with that level of leadership. The insignia is a representation of rates, ranks or designations.\n\nBelow are U.S. military rank and insignia charts for enlisted, officer and warrant officer ranks by service branch: Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, Marines and Space Force.\n\nThe charts are ordered by service branch, pay grade and rank. The corresponding rates and ranks have different names across branches and more than one may fall under the same pay grade.\n\nU.S. Military Ranks & Pay Grade by Branch\n\nPay ScaleArmyAir ForceMarinesNavy and Coast Guard Commissioned Officers **General of the ArmyGeneral of the Air ForceFleet Admiral O-10Army Chief of Staff\n\nGeneralAir Force Chief of Staff GeneralCommandant of the Marine Corps\n\nGeneralChief of Naval Operations\n\nCommandant of the Coast Guard\n\nAdmiral O-9Lieutenant GeneralLieutenant GeneralLieutenant GeneralVice Admiral O-8Major GeneralMajor GeneralMajor GeneralRear Admiral (Upper Half) O-7Brigadier GeneralBrigadier GeneralBrigadier GeneralRear Admiral (Commodore) O-6ColonelColonelColonelCaptain O-5Lieutenant ColonelLieutenant ColonelLieutenant ColonelCommander O-4MajorMajorMajorLieutenant Commander O-3CaptainCaptainCaptainLieutenant O-21st Lieutenant1st Lieutenant1st LieutenantLieutenant, Junior Grade O-12nd Lieutenant2nd Lieutenant2nd LieutenantEnsign Warrant Officers W-5Master Warrant Officer 5Chief Warrant Officer 5Master Warrant Officer W-4Warrant Officer 4Chief Warrant Officer 4Warrant Officer 4 W-3Warrant Officer 3Chief Warrant Officer 3Warrant Officer 3 W-2Warrant Officer 2Chief Warrant Officer 2Warrant Officer 2 W-1Warrant Officer 1Warrant OfficerWarrant Officer 1 Non-Commissioned Officers SpecialSergeant Major of the ArmyChief Master Sergeant of the Air ForceSergeant Major of the Marine CorpsMaster Chief Petty Officer of the Navy E-9Command Sergeant Major\n\nSergeant MajorFirst Sergeant (Chief Master Sergeant)\n\nChief Master SergeantSergeant Major\n\nMaster Gunnery SergeantMaster Chief Petty Officer E-8First Sergeant\n\nMaster SergeantFirst Sergeant (Senior Master Sergeant)\n\nSenior Master SergeantFirst Sergeant\n\nMaster SergeantSenior Chief Petty Officer E-7Sergeant First ClassFirst Sergeant (Master Sergeant)\n\nMaster SergeantGunnery SergeantChief Petty Officer E-6Staff SergeantTechnical SergeantStaff SergeantPetty Officer First Class E-5SergeantStaff SergeantSergeantPetty Officer Second Class E-4CorporalCorporalPetty Officer Third Class Enlisted Personnel E-4SpecialistSenior Airman E-3Private First ClassAirman First ClassLance CorporalSeaman E-2PrivateAirmanPrivate First ClassSeaman Apprentice E-1Private (Recruit)Airman BasicPrivateSeaman Recruit\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout Military Ranks\n\nEnlisted Military Ranks\n\nService members in pay grades E-1 through E-3 are in training status or serving in initial assignments. The training includes basic training or boot camp, where recruits are immersed in military culture and values and learn the core skills their branch of service requires.\n\nAfter basic training, junior enlisted members go to an advanced technical school for their job. In the Army and Marines, jobs fields are sorted by military occupational specialties or MOS. The Navy calls them rates and the Air Force and Space Force call them specialties.\n\nNoncommissioned Officer Ranks\n\nA non-commissioned officer (NCO) is an enlisted member who has risen through the ranks by promotion. NCOs are the link between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers, and are responsible for training troops to execute missions. Training for NCOs includes leadership, management, specific skills and combat.\n\nWarrant Officer Military Ranks\n\nWarrant officers hold warrants from their service secretary for specialization and expertise in certain fields, technologies or capabilities. The lowest ranking warrant officers serve under a warrant officer, but receive commissions from the president with promotion to chief warrant officer two. Commissioned warrant officers are specialists in a particular field, as opposed to commissioned officers, which are generalists. There are no warrant officers in the Air Force.\n\nOfficer Military Ranks\n\nOfficer ranks in the military consist of commissioned officers and warrant officers. The commissioned ranks are the highest in the military, holding presidential commissions with confirmation at their ranks by the U.S. Senate. Army, Air Force, Marine Corps and Space Corps officers are called company grade officers in the pay grades of O-1 to O-3, field grade officers in pay grades O-4 to O-6 and general officers in pay grades O-7 and higher. The equivalent officer groupings in the Navy are called junior grade, mid-grade and flag.\n\nNavy Military Ranks\n\nNavy officers wear distinctive rank devices depending upon the uniform they wear. The three basic uniforms and rank devices used are: khakis, with collar insignia pins; whites, with stripes on shoulder boards; and blues, with stripes sewn on the lower coat sleeves. The ranks are comprised of three main groups: enlisted, warrant officer and officer.\n\nArmy Military Ranks\n\nThe Army’s motto is “This We’ll Defend.” The Army is continually looking for those willing to do their part in defending our nation. The ranks are comprised of three main groups: enlisted, warrant officer and officer ranks. Rank and precedence are determined by pay grade.\n\nAir Force Military Ranks\n\nThe Air Force is the second youngest of the six military branches. According to the official website of the Air Force, they have five core missions: “Air superiority; global strike; rapid global mobility; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and command and control.” Their rankings are two groupings: enlisted and officer.\n\nSpace Force Military Ranks\n\nThe Space Force was established Dec. 20, 2019 as the sixth branch of the armed forces to protect U.S. interests in space. It is organized under the U.S. Air Force but uses service-specific ranks. Air Force rank insignia was in use until the Space Force finalized its own on Sept. 20, 2021.\n\nMarine Corps Military Ranks\n\nThe Marine Corps is one of the most competitive branches of the armed forces, requiring outstanding physical, mental and moral strength. The ranks are comprised of three main groups: Enlisted, warrant officer and officer ranks.\n\nCoast Guard Military Ranks\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is unique in that it is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and the Navy in wartime. The Coast Guard and Navy rank insignia are the same except for color."
