        "text": "These abbreviations are taken directly from the DoD Visual Information Style Guide except where noted. Reference the table below to identify the correct abbreviation for each service.\n\nPay grades, also referred to as grades, each correlates to a rank throughout the services. When referencing a service member, always include their rank as a formal title before their name upon the first reference. If you are referring to a person conversationally, spell out the rank. For example, “His grandfather was a lieutenant general.” When referring to a person by their title, use their service and the abbreviated form of their rank. For example, “Army Sgt. John Doe is a photographer for the 173rd Airborne Brigade.”\n\nReference the table below to identify the correct abbreviation for each service.\n\nArmy\n\nAir Force"
