Rejected by a half dozen major labels, the song was eventually released by Stax Records in 1971 where it quickly rose to No. 1 for five weeks on the Billboard Soul Singles chart, was certified double platinum, and was named the No. 1 Soul Single of the year. Knight had modest success with other songs later in her career, including a cover of the zydeco hit “My Toot Toot” in 1985. But it was \"Mr. Big Stuff,\" recorded in Jackson, that remained her signature anthem.\n\nGreg “Fingers” Taylor, 71, died Nov. 23.

In 1974, Buffett called Taylor to ask him to join the first Coral Reefer Band where he continued to play until 2000. Taylor's nickname, “Fingers,” was given to him in 1969 by John “Johnny Rock” Buffalo during their time in The Buttermilk Blues Band in Jackson. At the time, Taylor played keyboards, hence the nickname “Fingers,” but he later began playing harmonica in the same band. Taylor released five studio albums: Harpoon Man (1984), Chest Pains (1991), New Fingerprints (1992), Old Rock ‘n’ Roller (1996) and Hi Fi Baby (2003).\n\nDecember\n\nJames L. Robertson, 83, died on Dec. 10. Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Robertson grew up in Greenville where he became a cub sports reporter for the Delta Democrat Times newspaper. At the University of Mississippi, he rose to become editor-in-chief of the Daily Mississippian. In that position, he challenged the school’s approach to race-related matters, and his outspoken editorial policy sparked efforts to impeach him as editor by both the Campus Senate and the Mississippi Legislature. Later in 1965, he earned his Juris Doctor degree from Harvard. In 1983, Gov. William Winter appointed Robertson to fill a vacancy on the Mississippi Supreme Court, after which he was elected for a full eight-year term. From 1977 to 1992 he also served as a member of the faculty of the University of Mississippi School of Law. Robertson was a prolific writer, having published two books, “Heroes, Rascals, and the Law” (2019) and “Rowdy Boundaries” (2023), published by University Press of Mississippi.\n\nJames Dale Ashmore, 88, died on Dec. 15.

He was inducted into the Mississippi State Sports Hall of Fame in 1974, the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1983 and named an SEC Legend in 2000.\n\nCheri Merritt Barry, 68, died Dec. 24. Barry served as Meridian’s first female mayor, elected in 2009 by 293 votes. Her single term in office was marked by a groundbreaking for the new Meridian Law Enforcement Center on 22 Avenue South.

Prior to entering politics Barry had worked with the Lauderdale County Welfare Department, taught in the Meridian Public Schools, and served as Executive Director for the regional chapter of the American Red Cross."
