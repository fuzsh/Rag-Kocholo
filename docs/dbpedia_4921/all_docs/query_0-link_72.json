In areas of population and industrial growth such as the coastal zone between Stonehaven and Peterhead, the need for a thorough understanding of the local natural resources, hazards and ground conditions is paramount. A major aspect of this need is a comprehensive knowledge and understanding of the geological, geomorphological and environmental changes that have occurred over the past few million years, and which were responsible for the present distribution of drift deposits and landforms. To this end the British Geological Survey is directing research towards the Quaternary period, particularly concentrating on major centres of population, as well as surveying neighbouring rural and wilderness areas where relatively little geological information is currently available.\n\nThis memoir is a synthesis of the Cainozoic (Palaeogene, Neogene and Quaternary) deposits over a wide area of north-east Scotland and represents a departure from the previous survey styles. It focusses on the nature, origin and distribution of the drift deposits, their use as a resource and as foundation materials. As such it represents part of the large geoscience database that BGS holds for the UK that is available to provide solutions to geological problems as well as underpinning the scientific understanding of glacial processes, landforms and deposits. It describes areas that have been resurveyed by BGS over the last few decades in the coastal areas of north-east Scotland and portrayed on the Drift or Solid-and-Drift editions of eleven 1:50 000 geological sheets. Much of the mapping was undertaken as commissioned research specifically for sand and gravel resource appraisal or as part of environmental geology portfolios. Although the drift deposits on some of the sheets have been documented elsewhere in BGS publications, most have not been described systematically.\n\nSeveral classic concepts of the British Quaternary have been formulated in north-east Scotland over the past 150 years, including the pioneering research work of Thomas Jamieson and James Croll during the 19th century. Croll first suggested that ice ages were caused by changes in the amount of solar irradiance received at the poles as a result of changes in shape, tilt and wobble of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. This memoir summarises and builds on a wealth of research work published in the literature, particularly in publications of the Quaternary Research Association and Scottish Natural Heritage. It includes an analysis of how the landscape of north-east Scotland evolved throughout the Cainozoic era and it summarises our present understanding of the Quaternary events that have affected the district. Several research workers outwith the British Geological Survey have contributed to this memoir, in particular A M Hall and E R Connell, testifying to the co-operation of university academics with BGS’s core programme. This collaboration together with the combination of publically funded and commissioned research furthers understanding of British geology and enhances the national database of earth science information available to the public.\n\nDavid A Falvey, PhD Director.

The nature, origin and distribution of the superficial deposits are described, together with their use as a resource and as foundation materials. It draws on the results of surveys undertaken over the past 30 years or so, and acts as a guide to the large archive of more detailed information held by the British Geological Survey. It also incorporates and synthesises much information stemming from university research, and is co-authored by leading research workers out with BGS.\n\nThe complexity and variety of the Quaternary succession in the district is unrivalled in Scotland particularly for the record it contains of cold stages represented by periglacial deposits and the presence of sediments with a biological or pedological record of interstadial and interglacial climates. The widespread preservation of ancient peneplanation surfaces associated with deeply weathered rock and enigmatic flint and quartzite gravels is unique in north-west Europe. These features, together with a significant offshore stratigraphical record, provide unique information illustrating the effects of Pleistocene glaciation and Cainozoic landscape evolution. The area offers a broad range of future research and teaching opportunities that can draw on the definitive account presented here.\n\nMuch of north-east Scotland was peripheral to the main centres of ice accumulation in the west of Scotland during the Pleistocene glaciations resulting in minimal glacial erosion. It repeatedly witnessed the interaction between sluggish, cold-based ice flowing from an inland source and relatively fast, low-gradient ice streams flowing over deformable sediments offshore. A partial record of at least three major glaciations and intervening ice-free periods is preserved. During the last (Main Late Devensian) glaciation, the district was crossed by several distinct ice streams that partially retreated and then re-advanced on more than one occasion. This resulted in the deposition of complex sequences of glacial, glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits of varied provenance together with of a range of glacitectonic phenomena including numerous glacial rafts derived from the floor of the Moray Firth. Large rafts of Jurassic clay are particularly common. The pattern of deglaciation is also recorded in an extensive network of meltwater channels, and in the raised beach, estuarine and glaciomarine deposits, formed as a result of the considerable glacio-isostatic depression of the ground. Following a period of low sea level in the early Holocene, the Main Postglacial Transgression resulted in marine inundation of the river estuaries and the deposition of estuarine silts, sands and clays, locally over peat.

The image is a false colour composite, with bands 7, 4 and 1 displayed in red, green and blue. Bands 7 and 4 record infrared solar radiation reflected by the land surface, and highlight rocks/soil and vegetation, respectively, while band 1 records reflected visible blue light. Pink areas represent areas of snow and bright greens represent active vegetation. Coniferous forests are displayed as dark greens and moorland appears brown. Bare fields, rock and cultural features are seen as tones of red, while lowland areas appear in blue hues. Water is black due to absorption of solar radiation by the spectral ranges displayed.\n\nThe Black Burn and Blackhills glacial drainage channels are conspicuous in the vicinity of Elgin, as are the channels associated with the Tore of Troup, east of Banff. The former inselberg of Mormond Hill dominates the low ground between Fraserburgh and Peterhead and the Insch and Alford basins show up particularly well.\n\n(Table 1) Summary of events preserved in the marine and onshore records in and around north-east Scotland (after Holmes, 1977).\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThe region described here (and referred henceforth as ‘the district’) spans the coastal hinterland and Buchan Plateau of north-east Scotland stretching from Elgin, on the southern coast of the Moray Firth, to Inverbervie, on the North Sea coast (Figure 1a), (Figure 1b). This account summarises the Quaternary geology (Table 1) presented on the Drift (or Solid-and-Drift) editions of the 1:50 000 Series sheets 66 Banchory, 67 Stonehaven, 76E Inverurie, 86E Turriff, 87W Ellon, 87E Peterhead, 96W Portsoy, 96E Banff and 97 Fraserburgh. It also encompasses sheets 77 Aberdeen and 95 Elgin, for which modern memoirs including full descriptive accounts on the Quaternary are available. Details of the coverage and availability of maps, memoirs, sheet explanations and other publications are given in Information Sources.\n\nThe aim of this memoir is to consider landscape evolution throughout the Cainozoic era (Table 2), as well providing a description of the Quaternary deposits shown on the above-mentioned maps. Many elements of the landscape were created prior to the Quaternary, and furthermore, important deposits of Palaeogene to Neogene age have been shown as drift deposits on some maps. Place names mentioned in the text and a selection of geomorphological features, deposits and other Cainozoic phenomena are shown on Maps 1 to 11 at the back of this publication.\n\nThe coastal lowlands of north-east Scotland flank the Grampian Highlands, which rise south-westwards towards the Cairngorm Mountains. Much of the district lies below the 250 m contour and is characterised by a series of ancient plateau surfaces eroded across a wide variety of rock types. The predominant surface is the rolling Buchan Plateau (Figure 1a), (Figure 1b) lying between 60 and 150 m OD (Chapter 3). Only the most resistant quartzitic rocks form distinct hills, such as the conspicuous Mormond Hill (234 m OD), between Fraserburgh and Peterhead, and the more subdued Hill of Dudwick to the north-east of Ellon. The Buchan Plateau is crossed by a broad, gently undulating ridge that trends south-westwards from the coast at Troup Head (Sheet 96E) and which is developed mainly on relatively flat-lying Old Red Sandstone lithologies and Dalradian slates (Figure 2). Other similar trending ridges, some 220 to 310 m high, are formed mainly of steeply dipping Dalradian quartzite, and reach the high, rugged coastline of the Moray Firth between Banff and Portknockie. These ridges merge westwards, towards the River Spey, into a dissected plateau standing between 180 and 265 m OD. It is developed across Old Red Sandstone lithologies, Dalradian flaggy micaceous psammites and semipelites and more massive quartzites.\n\nThe Buchan Plateau is overlooked on its south-western margin by Bennachie (528 m OD) (Sheet 76E), a local granite landmark that has become part of the folklore of the region (Plate 1). Farther south, other large hills of granite also dominate the scenery inland from Aberdeen, including the Hill of Fare (471 m OD), Brimmond Hill (266 m OD) and Kerloch (534 m OD). Many of the rocks of the district have been deeply weathered and these weakened strata have been eroded into wide basins, for example the basic igneous rocks around Maud and Insch (Figure 2). However, some basic rocks are relatively fresh and form isolated hills, such as the broad ridge that extends from Pitgavenny Hill (236 m OD) towards Belhelvie. Another belt of high ground largely underlain by granite forms the eastern continuation of The Mounth. It is bounded to the south by the Highland Boundary Fault and to the north by the Dee valley, which is a major topographic corridor descending from the Gaick Plateau and the Cairngorm Mountains to the west of the district. The extreme south of the district falls within the gently undulating vale of Strathmore, which is underlain mainly by Old Red Sandstone lithologies and associated late Silurian to Devonian volcanic rocks. Although Strathmore is generally low lying, conglomerates near the Highland Boundary Fault form ridges parallel to the fault and volcanic rocks form hills such as Hill of Bruxie (216 m), south-west of Stonehaven.\n\nThe coastal communities of the district owe their existence mainly to the fishing industry, whereas those inland have relied on farming. Both industries have been in decline in recent years. Beef production was once prevalent, but arable farming has become increasingly important following the application of modern methods of land drainage to the notoriously poorly drained and stony soils of the region. Indeed, much of the Buchan Plateau now resembles parts of East Anglia following the widespread removal of boulders and stone walls. The production of aggregates makes an important contribution to the local economy, but the large stone quarrying industries formerly centred on the granites of Aberdeen and Peterhead have gone. Peat is still worked commercially around Strichen, but all of the clay-based brick and tile works in the district have closed. Forestry has become increasingly important, especially in the west of the area, but provides relatively little employment. Tourism is a steady, albeit mainly seasonal industry.\n\nWithout doubt, the North Sea oil- and gas-related industries are the mainstays of the present economy of northeast Scotland. However, while they have provided much-needed employment and wealth, they have brought about, or speeded up, irrevocable demographic and other changes across the region. This is especially so in the vicinities of Aberdeen and Peterhead where there has been a significant increase in population during the past 25 years or so. Large numbers of people have moved in from farther south. House prices have risen substantially and the increased demand for housing has placed pressures on local authorities to release land for building, some of which is not entirely suitable for such purposes (e.g. prone to flooding). Wage inflation has occurred causing the declining traditional activities to become uneconomic, especially the more marginal areas of agriculture where many hill farms have been bought to become residences and ‘hobby’ farms. There has been a dramatic increase in commuting across the entire region placing pressure on the infrastructure and leading to new road building and widespread road improvement projects.\n\nSolid geology\n\nA simplified map of the solid geology of north-east Scotland is shown in (Figure 2). The nature of the bedrock that underlies the Pleistocene deposits has exerted some measure of control on their development and form. The hardness of the differing types of bedrock, their weathering profiles, propensity to jointing, and overall response to subglacial deformation are all important factors that have controlled the pattern of glacial erosion and deposition. Resistant rock types such as granite and quartzite generally form positive topographical features that have diverted the ice, while readily releasing large erratic clasts into tills. The gabbros and ultramafic rocks generally form areas of negative relief, but like the granites, they have widely spaced joints and have readily yielded large erratics boulders, many of which were originally ‘corestones’ within saprolites (Chapter 4). Their distribution can be used in the reconstruction of ice movement directions.\n\nEasily fractured and finely jointed lithologies are also readily incorporated into ice sheets. Graphitic pelite and felsite are two examples of particularly common and widespread clasts, although neither are particularly resistant rock types. In general, the nature of the till in upland areas that formed beneath sluggish, possibly cold-based ice sheets strongly reflects the underlying bedrock.\n\nThe bedrock of the district ranges in age from late Precambrian to Early Cretaceous. Deposits of Palaeogene to Neogene age also occur (Chapter 4). An outline of the solid geology is given below, but further details can be found in Stephenson and Gould (1995) and Craig (1991). A wider view of the Precambrian Dalradian succession may be found in Harris et al. (1994, pp.43–50).\n\nDalradian\n\nA large part of the district is underlain by crystalline metamorphic rocks of the Neoproterozoic Dalradian Super-group. These metamorphic rocks represent original sedimentary rocks, now much altered by heat and pressure. Sandstones are thus represented by quartzites and quartzfeldspar-granulites (psammites), shales by various types of mica-schist and slate (pelites), and rocks intermediate between these two by quartz-mica-schists (semipelites). Limestones are now crystalline (marble), and originally muddy gritty sandstones have been weakly metamorphosed to become cleaved metagreywacke and schistose grit. The Dalradian sediments were deposited in a large intracontinental basin and later on a continental margin with small offshore oceanic basins.\n\nAn almost continuous succession from the upper part of the Grampian Group to a high level in the Southern Highland Group is exposed along the Moray Firth coast between Buckie and Macduff. The lowest part of the succession, assigned to the Grampian Group, consists of well-bedded quartzite and psammite that is mostly thickly bedded (Cullen Quartzite Formation), and was deposited in shallow water. The succeeding Appin Group was also deposited under shallow marine conditions, but the amount and grain size of the clastic material progressively decreased, and increasing quantities of limestone and organic material were deposited. The Lochaber Subgroup is represented by thinly bedded, flaggy psammite and semipelite; it becomes more calcareous upwards, eventually passing into conspicuous tremolite-rich semipelites, calc-silicate rocks and impure limestones (Findlater Flag and Cairnfield Flag formations). The overlying Ballachulish Subgroup consists of semipelite and pelite, commonly graphitic, interbedded with limestone units up to 35 m thick (Mortlach Graphitic Schist and Tarnash Phyllite and Limestone formations). The Blair Atholl Subgroup is represented by the Fordyce Limestone Formation, another interbedded pelite and limestone.\n\nThe Islay Subgroup at the base of the succeeding Argyll Group is marked by a discontinuous bed of metadiamictite, the ‘Boulder Bed’, which records a glacial event correlated with the widespread Neoproterozoic Varanger glaciations of the North Atlantic region. Associated psammite and quartzite units (Arnbath and Durn Hill formations) are succeeded by mixed semipelitic, pelitic and calcareous rocks (Easdale Subgroup: Castle Point Pelite and Portsoy Limestone formations), and then by striped, thinly bedded psammites and semipelites (Crinan Subgroup: Cowhythe Psammite Formation). The overlying Boyne Limestone Formation (Tayvallich Subgroup) includes a 200 m-thick unit of ‘relatively pure’ limestone exposed on the coast section, surrounded by calc-silicates and calcareous semipelites.\n\nThe Southern Highland Group is locally unconformable on the Argyll Group west of Whitehills. The basal White-hills Grit Formation is characterised by calcareous psammites and semipelites, while the overlying Macduff Slate Formation consists of micaceous semipelite and pelite with abundant units of gritty psammite. The group is characterised by turbidites, and was deposited from density currents in deeper water than the rest of the Dalradian Supergroup. The group includes the Macduff Boulder Bed, which preserves a record of distal glaciomarine sedimentation in the form of ice-rafted dropstones and related bedding-deformation structures (Stoker et al., 1999). The Macduff Slate Formation may extend from the Neoproterozoic into the Cambrian and possibly even Ordovician, but the evidence for this is contradictory and inconclusive.\n\nTo the east of Macduff and in the more southerly parts of the district, only the Southern Highland Group (Collieston, Glen Effock and Glen Lethnot formations) and the upper part of the Argyll Group (Aberdeen, Ellon and Strichen formations) are represented. The rocks are dominantly psammites and semipelites, with rare calcsilicate beds. Significant areas of limestone outcrop (Deeside Limestone Formation) are confined to the area immediately south-east of Banchory.\n\nCaledonian orogeny and magmatism\n\nThe Dalradian rocks were folded and metamorphosed during the Caledonian orogeny, which reached its acme at about 490–470 Ma. Four phases of folding and deformation, D1 to D4, are recognised, but are rarely all present in any one place. In the district, the large-scale effects of the earliest phase, which produced the Tay Nappe, are seen in the Collieston area and south of Aberdeen, where the strata are regionally inverted. The abundant upright, open to tight, northerly plunging early folds on the Banffshire coast section may also relate to this early phase. The large-scale structure of the area north of Aberdeen and east of Portsoy is dominated by the later ‘open’, upright northnorth-east-trending Turriff Syncline and the parallel Buchan Anticline to the east. They are D3 or possibly D4 in age. South of Aberdeen, gently dipping, inverted strata of the Southern Highland Group are tilted to the vertical along the Highland Border Downbend. This is a late regional east-north-east-trending monoform; its axial trace runs a few kilometres north of the Highland Boundary Fault. Major zones of ductile shearing occur both west of Portsoy (probably a continuation of the Keith Shear Zone), and in and just east of Portsoy (the Portsoy Shear Zone). They are also found between Inzie Head and Ellon, and along the northern and southern boundaries of the Insch basic intrusion. The Keith Shear Zone is associated with early granite intrusions and may itself reflect an early, Proterozoic structure. Other shear zones are closely associated with the emplacement of the basic and ultrabasic intrusions and are probably of early Ordovician age, although they may also reflect older lineaments in basement gneisses at depth.\n\nTo the east of Portsoy and to the north of Aberdeen, the regional metamorphism was of a relatively low-pressure type (Buchan metamorphism), and the characteristic minerals formed in pelites and semipelites were andalusite and cordierite. To the west of the Portsoy Shear Zone and south of Aberdeen, regional metamorphism took place at higher pressures, and the characteristic minerals to form in pelitic rocks were garnet, staurolite and kyanite.\n\nLarge volumes of basic magma were intruded into the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks at about 470 Ma. It crystallised as several large layered bodies of basic and ultrabasic rock. The Insch, Haddo House, Arnage, Maud, Belhelvie and Portsoy masses lie within the district, and the nearby Huntly and Knock masses have also provided erratics to the till of the area. The commonest lithologies are serpentinite (derived by hydration of ultrabasic rocks), olivine gabbro, olivine norite, and gabbros and norites (both cumulate and granular types). Troctolite, monzonite and syenite are more restricted in outcrop. Contact metamorphism associated with the basic intrusions produced horn\\p\\pfelses rich in sillimanite and cordierite, and also produced characteristic ‘contaminated’ and ‘hybrid’ rocks such as cordierite-bearing norite. Locally these metamorphic effects appear to have reinforced the regional pattern giving rise to areas of semipelitic and psammitic gneisses.\n\nA phase of late Neoproterozoic (about 600 Ma) acid plutonic intrusion produced the Windyhills and Boggierow granitic intrusions, which now lie along the Keith Shear Zone, and are deformed by it. Acid magmas were also intruded about 470 Ma and at 425–395 Ma. The earlier intrusions, confusingly termed the ‘Older Granites’, are grey muscovite-biotite granites (S-type) and are typically foliated. This group includes the Aberchirder, Strichen, Forest of Deer, Kemnay, and Aberdeen granites. The later intrusions show calc-alkali differentiation trends (B-type) and are more voluminous. They comprise an earlier group of quartz-diorites, tonalites and granodiorites, typically grey in colour, which include the Torphins, Crathes, Balblair and Clinterty intrusions, and a slightly later group of biotite-granites, generally pink and in some cases megacrystic, which show a highly evolved geochemistry. These include Peterhead, Bennachie, Hill of Fare and Mount Battock. The distant Cairngorm, Ballater and Glen Gairn plutons also belong to this suite.\n\nA suite of minor intrusions is associated with the 420–390 Ma plutons. They are widely distributed, but their outcrops are too small to be shown on smaller scale maps. The principal lithologies are felsite, microgranite, quartz-feldspar porphyry, microdiorite, and the lamprophyres, spessartite and vogesite. The more acid lithologies can form hard and resistant blocks that have yielded erratics and, in places, form a conspicuous though minor component of sand and gravel deposits.\n\nOrdovician, Devonian and Carboniferous\n\nA very narrow, discontinuous strip of early Ordovician rocks, the Highland Border Complex, crops out just north-west of the Highland Boundary Fault. They include metabasalts, slaty pelites, gritty psammites and rare impure limestones.\n\nDevonian rocks formed in arid intermontane basins following the Caledonian orogeny. They are found as outliers in the East Grampian area to the north of the Highland Boundary Fault, around Elgin, in the Turriff basin and in several smaller outliers including one found recently on the Moss of Cruden, near Peterhead (Appendix 1).\n\nThe Lower Devonian Crovie Group crops out mainly along the eastern side of the Turriff Basin. It consists of sandstones and conglomerates deposited on river floodplains and alluvial fans. The conglomerates underlying parts of Aberdeen are also assigned to the Lower Devonian. The unconformably overlying Middle Devonian rocks belong to the Inverness Sandstone Group. In the Turriff Basin, they form the Gardenstown Conglomerate Formation. This consists of a sequence of breccias and conglomerates, but also includes the Findon Fish Bed. Inland, the conglomerates are commonly deeply weathered. To the southeast of Elgin, and in outliers as far east as Deskford, the Spey Conglomerate Formation at the base of the Inverness Sandstone Group comprises a basal breccia overlain by a conglomerate with rounded cobbles mainly of quartzite set in a loose sandy matrix. It is overlain by red-brown and purple-brown flaggy sandstones of the Fochabers Sandstone Formation, which also contains beds of red- and purple-brown and green-grey mudstone. The unconformably overlying Upper Devonian Nairn Sandstone Formation, a gritty to pebbly arkose with scattered clasts of micaceous mudstone, crops out in the Alves–Elgin area.\n\nTo the south of the Highland Boundary Fault, between Edzell and Stonehaven, there is a thick sequence of late Silurian to early Devonian mainly fluviatile rocks that was deposited adjacent to the rising Highland block. The basal Stonehaven Group consists largely of sandstones with some siltstone and a thin andesitic lava flow. The Dunnottar–Crawton and Arbuthnott–Garvock groups here consist largely of conglomerate, derived partly from older metamorphic and igneous rocks and partly from contemporaneous lavas. Flows of andesite and mugearite are conspicuous in the coastal section. The uppermost Strathmore Group consists of sandstones and siltstones, some notably red, interspersed with fans of conglomerate, where large Devonian river systems drained the embryonic Highlands.\n\nA suite of east–west-trending quartz-dolerite dykes of latest Carboniferous age occur throughout the district, though they are most abundant in the southern part. The dykes are typically wider than an earlier felsite to lamprophyre suite of Siluro-Devonian age, and large blocks are commonly found as erratics close to these dykes.\n\nMesozoic\n\nMesozoic sedimentary rocks are widely preserved offshore and reflect the stability of the land masses in the East Grampians and adjacent sea areas since Permian times. Permian and Triassic rocks are preserved only in the extreme north-west of the district, in a strip from Burghead to Lossiemouth. The Upper Permian to Lower Triassic Cutties Hillock and Hopeman sandstones comprise aeolian sandstones with large-scale dune-bedding and sparse fluviatile deposits. The overlying fluviatile sandstones and conglomerates of the Burghead Beds are succeeded by the Upper Triassic Lossiemouth Sandstone, which is also of aeolian origin. This grades upwards into the Stotfield Cherty Rock, a calcrete-dominated sandstone with chert concretions. Jurassic rocks have been proved at depth near Lossiemouth. They consist of basal calcareous mudstones (or marls) overlain by a rhythmic sequence of sandstones, siltstones and mudstones, and succeeded by coarse-grained, kaolinitic sandstones. A hitherto unknown outlier of Lower Cretaceous glauconitic sandstone has been found recently on the Moss of Cruden (Hall and Jarvis, 1994; Appendix 1). No Upper Cretaceous rocks are known in north-east Scotland, but evidence of a Late Cretaceous transgression is given by the presence of nodular flints at the base of the Buchan Ridge Gravel Member (Chapter 4), which contains abundant flint pebbles yielding Cretaceous fossils.\n\nA thick and more complete succession of Mesozoic rocks occupies the Moray Firth basin. Triassic sandstones rest unconformably on sandstones and conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone and are overlain by sandstones, black shaly mudstones and siltstones of Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The Lower Cretaceous rocks also include glauconitic and calcareous sandstones. Upper Cretaceous chalk and calcareous mudstones crop out on the sea bed at the eastern end of the Moray Firth and parallel to the North Sea coast some 15 km offshore from Peterhead.\n\nSummary of Cainozoic geological history\n\nPalaeogene and Neogene (formerly the Tertiary)\n\nThe geological record of this period of time on the mainland is largely one of landscape evolution by subaerial erosion and the development of deep weathering profiles. The Paleocene was marked by considerable volcanic activity along the western seaboard of Scotland. Uplift of as much as 1.5 km was associated with this event, causing an eastward tilting of peneplains formed across north-east Scotland during the Late Cretaceous and earlier. Cretaceous sediments in the developing Inner Moray Firth Basin and on the Buchan Plateau were exposed to erosion and many of the major valleys of the region were initiated as river systems (Chapter 3). They became established on the tilted peneplains and drained towards the deepening Moray Firth and North Sea basins, where sedimentation was rapid. For example the chalk is overlain by a thick succession of Paleocene sandstone, mudstone and siltstone with beds of lignite, which crop out in the eastern North Sea basin (Gatliff et al., 1994). The kaolinitic flint and quartzite-rich deposits of the Buchan Gravels Formation preserved on isolated hilltops in central Buchan were laid down in the catchments of such rivers, their present position resulting from subsequent topographical inversion (Chapter 3). A warm, humid climate prevailed until the late Miocene, during which time the effects of chemical weathering penetrated deeply below the land surface forming ‘clayey gruss’ saprolites (Chapter 4). Mechanical weathering became increasingly intense during the Pliocene and early Pleistocene as the climate deteriorated and granular disintegration occurred, particularly of coarse-grained igneous rocks, to form ‘gruss’ saprolites. Subsequent glacial erosion has failed to remove these ancient regoliths over large areas of the district, and they locally extend to depths of 20 m or more.\n\nIn this volume ‘Tertiary’ is used as an informal term in contexts where it would be inappropriate to be more specific.\n\nQuaternary (Pleistocene and Holocene)\n\nThe history of the Pleistocene period is described fully in Chapter 5, where both the onshore and offshore evidence is examined. The Scottish mainland has experienced numerous glacial episodes during the past two million years or so, but only the last glaciation, the Main Late Devensian, has left an appreciable sedimentary record (Table 1). Despite over 150 years of research, the extent of this ice sheet in north-east Scotland remains controversial (Figure 3). Sparse pre-Devensian deposits representing stages back, possibly, to the Anglian occur locally, and many geomorphological features, such as some former glacial meltwater channels, have clearly evolved during several glacial episodes. The Quaternary succession is more complete offshore, where it thickens towards the axis of the North Sea basin.\n\nThe Quaternary deposits and features of the district occur in four distinct geomorphological domains and can be related to five distinct ice masses that co-existed during the Late Devensian and earlier glaciations (Figure 4). The eastern Grampian Highlands were mainly affected by relatively sluggish ice that flowed outwards from centres of accumulation in the Cairngorms and Gaick. It deposited mainly thin, sandy diamictons in this domain, followed during deglaciation by meltwater deposits that are mainly confined to major valleys such as the Dee and Spey.\n\nA northern domain was affected by a powerful ice stream that flowed out of the Moray Firth and impinged on the northern coast of the district. It typically laid down dark bluish grey diamictons containing abundant erratics and rafts of Mesozoic rocks and cold-water Quaternary sediments dredged up from the bed of the firth. Ice from the Spey merged with the Moray Firth ice stream to the west of Portsoy. An eastern domain was influenced by ice that flowed north-eastwards from Strathmore and was deflected back onshore to the north of Aberdeen where it left a distinctive suite of reddish brown sediments. These contain clasts of Permo–Triassic sandstone and dolomite and possible Mesozoic calcareous siltstone from the adjacent North Sea basin, in addition to material from the Old Red Sandstone and Devonian volcanic rocks of Strathmore. The deflection was probably caused by Scandinavian ice offshore. Red till is widespread in Strathmore itself, but is relatively thin, demonstrating that this third domain was mainly one of glacial erosion.\n\nThe fourth distinctive geomorphological domain is that of the Buchan Plateau. This area was once thought by some to be ‘moraineless’, but glacial deposits do occur, although they are thin and patchy (Figure 4). Features of glacial erosion are very poorly developed, but they do indicate that the final ice movement was from the west. This observation is supported by the presence of tills with erratics derived from the west, and by the pattern and distribution of glacial drainage channels across the area that indicate westwards retreat of the ice. However, an earlier, south-eastward movement of ice deposited dark bluish grey tills which occur sporadically at depth. The widespread presence of deeply weathered rock in central\n\nBuchan coupled with the survival of the Buchan Gravels indicates that minimal glacial erosion has occurred there throughout the Quaternary period, probably as a consequence of the ice being sluggish and cold-based in this peripheral part of the mainland. Periglacial deposits and structures such as ice-wedge polygons are relatively common across the Buchan Plateau leading to the belief, now considered unlikely, that it was unglaciated at least during the whole of the Late Devensian (Chapter 5).\n\nCoastal glacigenic deposits commonly overlie tills derived from inland suggesting that the East Grampians ice had retreated from the coast prior to inundation by the Moray Firth and Strathmore ice streams (Figure 4). This view is supported by the presence, in the lower valleys of the Deveron, Ugie, Ythan and Don, of laminated glaciolacustrine deposits that locally interdigitate with the coastal tills, but which generally rest on tills derived from inland. The lakes were dammed by the coastal ice streams and, for some time, meltwaters ponded in the catchment of the Deveron may have flowed into that of the Ythan via a prominant glacial spillway between Turriff and Fyvie. In Strathmore, red deposits are widespread in the lower reaches of the Grampian valleys, but here there is local evidence that the East Grampian ice expanded after the Strathmore ice had begun to retreat.\n\nThe global lowering of sea level during the last glaciation brought about by the abstraction of water to form the continental and local ice sheets was more than offset in most of mainland Scotland by glacio-isostatic depression of the land caused by ice loading. As a result some glaciomarine sediments, laid down at the retreating ice margins, are now raised above sea level. The oldest of these sediments occur in the vicinity of the St Fergus gas terminal, near Peterhead, where they have been dated to around 15 000 BP (radiocarbon years before present). Glaciomarine clays near Elgin can be compared to the ‘Errol Beds’ of the Firth of Tay, which were laid down in arctic conditions while the main Late Devensian ice sheet retreated. The whole district was probably deglaciated by 13 000 BP. However, relative sea level continued to fall for several thousand years, leading to the incision of deep channels that are now buried at the mouths of major rivers like the Dee and Ythan (Chapter 7).\n\nEvidence of the relatively warm Windermere Interstadial (13 000–11 000 BP) is restricted to a few sites where buried organic deposits have been found, such as at Glenbervie, in Strathmore (Appendix 1 Site 25). No glaciers existed in the district during the subsequent Loch Lomond Stadial (11 000–10 000 BP), but many periglacial phenomena were formed during this very cold period. The climate warmed abruptly at the beginning of the Holocene epoch, the present interglacial stage. Intense erosion would have occurred initially on the bare ground before soils developed and vegetation became established. At first, braided rivers flowing across gravelly floodplains were common, but they later stabilised into the mainly single-thread and locally meandering streams of the present day. Relative sea level rose during the Main Postglacial Transgression of the mid-Holocene, peaking at a few metres above OD about 6000 years ago (Chapter 7). This resulted in marine inundation of the lower reaches of river valleys and deposition of estuarine silt, sand and clay, commonly on terrestrial peats and fluvial sediment laid down earlier in the Holocene. There is evidence preserved near Fraserburgh (Appendix 1 Site 9) and in the lower Ythan valley that at least one huge tidal wave (tsunami) hit the coast about 7000 years ago. It was generated by a massive submarine slide on the Norwegian continental margin.\n\nClassification of deposits\n\nThe Drift editions of most BGS 1:50 000 scale maps covering north-east Scotland show deposits that have been classified using a morpho-lithogenetic scheme and identified by standard colours and symbols (Figure 5), for example ‘Glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits’ in pink or crimson and ‘Peat’ in brown. This method of classification has proved to be a practical means of mapping deposits cropping out at the surface and it is particularly appropriate for air photo interpretation. The Quaternary deposits classified in this way are described systematically in Chapter 6.\n\nThe symbols have been embellished on more recently published maps, such that lithostratigraphical map codes are added as superscripts, lithological codes as prefixes, chronostratigraphical qualifiers as subscripts and inferred depositional environments as suffixes (Figure 5). More subcategories are generally found on the detailed 1:10 000 or 1:10 560 ‘clean copies’ that are available for large parts of the district (see Information sources). The symbol scheme has been modified over the years with the result that there are variations in presentation between sheets, although the differences are largely semantic (Table 3).\n\nLithostratigraphy\n\nThe morpho-lithogenetic scheme does have some failings. For example, it does not easily accommodate complicated sequences of deposits or bodies of sediment that contain a mix of lithologies. In order to overcome these difficulties, the more recently published maps depict some deposits that have been classified lithostratigraphically in accordance with internationally agreed codes (Hedberg, 1976). The Neogene deposits have also been classified in this way. It is beyond the scope of this publication to inaugurate a formal lithostratigraphical framework that systematically encompasses all the Quaternary deposits occurring across the district, but a start has been made with the glacigenic deposits (Chapter 8). For example, deposits laid down in association with ice that flowed out of the Moray Firth are placed within the Banffshire Coast Drift Group (formerly the ‘blue-grey series’), whereas deposits laid down by more local ice from the Grampian mountains are allotted to the East Grampian Drift Group (formerly the ‘inland series’). The former ‘red series’ is divided so that deposits laid down by ice flowing through Strathmore (Mearns Drift Group) are distinguished from those deposited by ice moving onshore from the North Sea (Logie-Buchan Drift Group). Deposits laid down by ice entering the district from the Monadhliath mountains and the Spey valley are placed in the Central Grampian Drift Group. Subdivisions at formation, member and bed level are described in Chapter 8 and the type localities of most units are described in Appendix 1. The original names of units are retained whenever possible.\n\nA new mapping-related lithostratigraphical framework for the Quaternary of Britain has been proposed recently by McMillan and Hamblin (2000). For example, fluvial, lacustrine, estuarine, coastal and aeolian deposits are defined geographically within a series of Catchment Groups defined by major river drainage systems. It is proposed to change the ranking and naming of the glacigenic groups described here slightly. The Central Grampian Drift Group may be subdivided in order to identify the sandy tills of the Inverness area, which extend towards Elgin.\n\nChronostratigraphy\n\nChronostratigraphy is the definition of internationally agreed boundaries to units of strata (systems, series and stages) that correspond to intervals of geological time (periods, epochs and ages). The Cainozoic era is divided here into three periods, the Palaeogene, Neogene and Quaternary (the first two formerly known as the ‘Tertiary’; (Table 2)). The Quaternary period embraces two epochs, the Pleistocene (‘Ice Age’) and the Holocene (the last 10 ka), but the latter is really the last of a series of relatively short-lived, warm interglacial stages separating longer glacial stages. The Quaternary has been divided traditionally into climato-stratigraphical stages because climatic change has had a dominant influence on sedimentation. The British chronostratigraphy embraces an alternating sequence of glacial and interglacial stages that have been defined principally in East Anglia ((Figure 6); (Table 1)), but problems have arisen because the geological record there is incomplete. The more comprehensive north-west European scheme has been adopted offshore. The placing of the base of the Quaternary is discussed in Chapter 5. In northern Britain, glacial, periglacial (tundra) and boreal (like central Scandinavia) environments existed during the glacial stages, and both boreal and temperate environments occurred at times during the interglacial stages.\n\nThe Pleistocene Series is divided formally into Lower, Middle and Upper as shown on (Figure 33). The Quaternary Period is divided here into Early, Middle and Late as shown on (Table 1). Although capital letters are used here for these divisions of the Quaternary, the precise definition and formal status of many of them are not agreed internationally.\n\nThe terrestrial record of the Quaternary is fragmentary because later glaciations have removed most of the evidence of earlier events. In contrast, cores taken from deep ocean floors provide a more continuous record. A complete chronostratigraphy has been based on the analysis of calcareous microfossils preserved in these sediments. The changing microfaunal assemblages preserve a record of fluctuating oceanic water temperature (Ruddiman and Raymo, 1988) and the relative proportions of the two common isotopes of oxygen contained in the tests provide a proxy record of global ice volume and sea level (Imbrie et al., 1984). During glacial periods, water is lost from the oceans to form ice sheets. The oceans consequently become relatively enriched in water containing the heavy isotope of oxygen (O18). The oscillating O18 content of ocean water (as determined from the carbonate tests of organisms that lived in it) can thus be used as an index of ice sheet growth and decay. The oxygen isotope stages thus defined now provide a universal means of dividing the Quaternary (Emiliani, 1954; Shackleton and Opdyke, 1973). The even numbered stages generally refer to cold periods and the odd numbered stages to the warm part of each global glacial–interglacial cycle. An exception is Stage 5, which is broken down into 5a–5e where only 5e is generally accepted to represent a full interglacial (Figure 7). The oxygen isotope stages (OIS) are used in this publication in association with the ‘long’ British stratigraphy onshore and the north-west European scheme offshore (Figure 6), although many correlations with oxygen isotope stages remain uncertain and are the subject of active research.\n\nGeochronometry\n\nRadiocarbon dating\n\nRadiocarbon dating is the principal method for determining the age of organic materials from the present to about 60 000 years ago. The method takes advantage of the natural occurrence of a radioactive isotope of carbon (14C), which is produced in the upper atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic ray neutrons with nitrogen-14. The carbon-14 is taken up by plants during photosynthesis and then passes up the food chain to other organisms. Once an organism dies the 14C in its structure is gradually lost by radioactive disintegration back to 14N. Carbon14 decays by beta particle emission with a half life of 5730 years. Conventional radiocarbon dating involves the measurement of beta particle transformation and is primarily limited by the amount of raw carbon that is available for counting. The Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) technique involves counting the carbon atoms rather than the beta particles emitted during decay. AMS radiocarbon dating is generally superior to conventional methods and, importantly, only very small samples (from 2 mg to 5 mg) are required for dating.\n\nDates quoted in this memoir in the style 12.5 ka\n\nBP are conventional (uncalibrated) radiocarbon years before present (taken as 1950). Dates on shell material should have been adjusted to take into account the ‘marine reservoir effect’ for British waters, which involves subtracting 405 ± 40 years from the conventional radiocarbon age. It should be noted that calendar (sidereal) ages based on historical records, annual layering in ice cores, tree rings, varve counting etc are somewhat older than conventional radiocarbon ages. If ages quoted in this publication have been calibrated to take this disparity into account, the Calib 3.0 radiocarbon calibration program (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) has been used, and they are quoted as ‘cal yr BP’.\n\nAmino-acid dating\n\nAmino-acid dating has been used widely in north-east Scotland to date deposits older than the last glaciation. The technique mainly involves the analysis of proteins locked-up in the shells of certain molluscs and tests of foraminiferids (Sykes, 1991). Several time-dependent chemical reactions occur upon death that provide a means for relative dating. The most useful reaction is racemisation, where L-isomers of individual amino acids transform to the D-configuration. North-east Scotland has been important in the development of British aminostratigraphy, where amino-acid ratios have been used to rank fossils and their associated sediments according to relative age (for example (Figure 43)).\n\nLuminescence dating\n\nLuminescence dating is the collective term that covers a variety of dating methods, specifically thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). These methods are based on the principle that naturally occurring minerals like quartz and feldspar can act as dose meters, recording the amount of nuclear radiation that they have been exposed to (Miller, 1990). The total radioactive dose can be calculated by making a series of luminescence measurements, either where the sample is heated (TL) or exposed to a monochromatic or narrow band source of light (OSL). The methods are particularly applicable for dating loess and wind-blown sand, but less reliable for glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits. Several dates have been obtained from the sequences at Kirkhill Leys, Teindland and Howe of Byth (Appendix 1).\n\nChapter 2 Applied geology\n\nThe Quaternary sediments of north-east Scotland play a major role in the economic development of the district. Although these deposits are generally thin, they cover some 90 per cent of the land surface onshore and most of the sea bed in the surrounding offshore area. Quaternary strata form the foundations for most urban, and industrial buildings, as well as road and rail links. They are also the source of most of the aggregate used in their construction. Much of the district’s drinking water has passed through these sediments and its most fertile soils are developed upon them. Many nature reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), especially those concerned with wetland and dune habitats, result from accumulations of peat and blown sand during post-glacial times. Domestic and industrial waste is disposed by landfill into former workings in Quaternary sands and gravels or tipped on top of undisturbed permeable Quaternary sediments. Knowledge of the extent and nature of these deposits and other types of made ground, and the engineering properties of in situ Quaternary strata and deeply weathered bedrock, is crucial in determining ground conditions for future urban and industrial developments and protecting groundwater resources.\n\nBulk mineral resources\n\nConstruction and industrial minerals form an important resource in north-east Scotland. Sand and gravel deposits are by far the most important and reserves with planning permission accounted for 25 per cent of the Scottish total in 1993 (BGS, 1998). The value of naturally occurring aggregate extracted from north-east Scotland was approximately £6 million in 1997. Of this, 431 000 tonnes were used for fill, 350 000 tonnes for concreting sand, 290 000 tonnes as coarse aggregate for concrete and 109 000 tonnes for building sand. In 1997, twenty-two major workings (Figure 8) were notified to BGS as being operational within the district (Cameron et al., 1998). Brick clay and peat also constitute significant bulk resources in north-east Scotland, although there is little current commercial peat extraction and no large-scale brick clay working from these deposits.\n\nA brief general account of the most extensive spreads of sand and gravel in north-east Scotland is given below, but, because of their economic importance, abundance and variability, these resources are more fully described in Appendix 2.\n\nSand and gravel\n\nSands and gravels of several types occur in north-east Scotland (Chapter 6). Each type reflects its mode of deposition and the rocks from which it was derived. The extensive glaciofluvial deposits that flank the lower reaches of most of the major river valleys, and extend onto the adjacent interfluves, are the principal sources of naturally occurring coarse-grained bulk aggregates. Most were laid down at the close of the Main Late Devensian glaciation (Chapter 5). Less extensive spreads of sand and gravel accumulated around the coast as raised beach and marine deposits (Chapter 7), when sea level was higher than at present (during the Late-glacial and mid-Holocene). Sands and gravels that were deposited by postglacial streams and rivers also commonly underlie floodplains and river terraces, while extensive dunes of blown sand fringe the coast, particularly in the eastern part of the district.\n\nThe most important sand and gravel resources occur as moundy and flat topped glaciofluvial deposits. These flank the lower reaches of the valleys of the rivers Don and Dee, and extend onto the adjacent interfluves around the city of Aberdeen (the largest market for aggregate in northern Scotland). However, many of the most attractive deposits around Aberdeen have been extensively worked, and some of the resources close to the city have been sterilised by urban expansion. More extensive spreads of good quality sand and gravel, suitable for most end-uses, occur in the coastal lowlands between Forres and Elgin. They form coarsening-upward sequences that were laid down as fans at the mouths of drainage channels or in temporary ice-dammed lakes, kettled terraced spreads that were laid down on bodies of stagnant ice during deglaciation and gravelly Late-glacial raised beaches. Thick deposits of gravel and sand are locally present beneath river floodplains, but none is exploited at present, as the bulk of the resource lies beneath the water table.\n\nThick, easily worked resources of sand and gravel, lying above the water table, form flights of terraces flanking the North Ugie Water, South Ugie Water, and the rivers Lossie, Spey, and Ythan. The Ythan terrace gravels contain a high proportion of boulders, but have been extensively worked on both sides of the river downstream of Methlick. Gravels were also won from several pits sited on the Ugie terraces. Moundy glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits that crop out inland of Fraserbrugh, between Aberdeen and Peterhead, and between Stone-haven and Auchenblae are also major resources. However, these accumulations are commonly discontinuous and individual deposits may vary considerably in thickness and quality over relatively short distances. Typically, they contain waste partings of silt and clay and may be concealed beneath a thin overburden of till.\n\nMost deposits, particularly those in the upland areas, contain high proportions of clasts derived from crystalline resistant rock types (Appendix 2), and after on-site screening, washing, crushing and grading, they produce high-quality aggregates that suit most end-uses (Merritt et al., 1988). However, the spreads of sand and gravel overlying Devonian bedrock, such as those in the south-eastern part of the district, tend to yield weaker aggregates, as they locally contain significant amounts of friable sandstone, mudstone and porphyritic lavas. Much of the sand and gravel in north-east Scotland is used in the production of ready-mix concrete and concrete products, as a source of mortaring and plastering sand, and as fill in civil engineering works (Plate 2). Some sand is used for coated aggregate in road building, but little gravel is used for road surfacing, as crushed-rock aggregate provides clasts with better resistance to abrasion and polishing. Poorer quality sand and gravel is used extensively in the construction of unmetalled roads and tracks.\n\nPotentially workable deposits of coarse-grained aggregate also occur within the Buchan Gravels Formation, an unlithified gravelly deposit of Palaeogene to Neogene age, which crops out between Peterhead and the upper reaches of the Deveron and Ythan valleys (Chapter 4). In some areas, sands, and less commonly gravels, derived from decomposed igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary bedrock are also worked as fill for untarred roads.\n\nBrick clay\n\nClays suitable for brick and tile making are widely distributed within the Quaternary deposits of north-east Scotland, and have been worked at almost 20 sites during the last two centuries. Most workings were small-scale and served local markets; no commercial brick or tile making currently takes place. The widely scattered, variable quality and remote nature of many deposits, the small size of reserves at most sites and the relatively high costs of firing superficial clays, all contributed to the decline of the industry.\n\nThe only comprehensive evaluation of clays in northeast Scotland suitable for brick, tile and pipe-making was undertaken by Eyles et al. (1946). This work, which forms the basis of the following account, provided geological descriptions of all of the worked and potentially workable clay deposits that had been identified in the district prior to the end of the Second World War. It also reported the results of physical and chemical tests on deposits at a selection of clay pits, which were primarily undertaken to establish the suitability of each clay deposit for brick making. The results showed the material to be of variable, but generally rather poor quality, but suitable for the production of drainage pipes, tiles and common bricks.\n\nThe data provided by Eyles et al. (1946), together with that gleaned during more recent geological surveys have been used to compile a map of the main sources of brick clay in the district (Figure 9). A total of 29 brick clay sites are recognised, of which 21 have been worked commercially. Eyles et al. (1946) established that common bricks had been made from a wide variety of clayey Quaternary sediments, including, ‘boulder clay’ (till), ‘fluvioglacial clay’ (clayey glaciolacustrine deposits), clayey raised marine deposits and alluvium. Workings for brick clay were also recorded in large glacially transported rafts (‘erratics’) of Jurassic mudstone. Data on the type of clay deposit and its maximum thickness at each site are summarised in (Table 4). This shows that clays of marine, glaciomarine and glaciolacustrine origin (Chapter 6) have been the most widely worked for brick making, possibly because they are the least heterogeneous, widespread clayey deposits in the district.\n\nSilty clays of marine origin (Spynie Clay Formation) were formerly worked for brick and tile making in two pits close to the town of Elgin ((Figure 9); (Map 1)). The clay deposits occur close to sea level, beneath shelly sands and peat near Loch Spynie. Considerable resources are thought to be present north of Milltown Airfield [NJ 266 658] and beneath Lossiemouth Airfield [NJ 210 695] (Peacock et al., 1968).\n\nDark blue-grey clay with wisps of sand was worked for pipes, bricks and tiles in a clay pit at Tochieneal [NJ 521 652] (Map 2), south of Cullen, though test results indicate that mixing sand with the clay would improve its suitability for brick making. Previous accounts are undecided as to whether the worked deposits are part of a large erratic of Jurassic mudstone or a Quaternary marine deposit. It is probable that they are rafts within the Whitehills Glacigenic Formation (Chapter 8). Similar rafted material was also worked in pits at Blackpots [NJ 659 657] near Whitehills (Map 3), and at Plaidy [NJ 730 550], north of Turriff (Map 5).\n\nGreenish grey laminated clays and silts, containing dropstones and marine shells of Late Devensian age, have been worked for brick making in a pit near Annachie [NK 105 529], north of Peterhead (Appendix 1 St Fergus). Much of the resource is concealed beneath alluvium, but 16 m of laminated silt and clay were recorded in a nearby BGS borehole (NK15SW/1).\n\nMost recent brick production has been concentrated on Quaternary clay resources between Peterhead and Aberdeen, which are reviewed by Ridgeway (1982). Until the middle part of the 1980s, reddish brown laminated silty clays and associated clayey tills were worked for brick making at the Cruden Bay Brick and Tile Works at Errollston [NK 088 368], south of Peterhead (Appendix 1 Errollston; (Map 7)). Laminated silts, sands and clays, interbedded with silty clayey diamicton, were recorded to a depth of 6.2 m, in a section at the working pit examined during 1974 by Peacock (1984). A comparable section was recorded in 1944, by Eyles et al. (1946), although the workable deposits were reported to extend to more than 24 m depth in places. The test results indicate that the Errolston deposit is suitable for the manufacture of facing bricks as well as common bricks.\n\nReddish brown clay and silt was also worked by the Cruden Bay Brick and Tile Company in a pit in the valley of the Tarty Burn at Tipperty [NJ 971 268] (Map 9) until the middle part of the 1980s. Eyles et al. (1946) record 5.3 m of laminated clay resting on sand and gravel in the working face exposed in 1944. The form and extent of the deposit, which was investigated by mapping and trial pitting during the 1970s, is illustrated in Munro (1986, fig. 37). At the time, 2 m of unstratified ‘red’ clay passing downward into 2 m of laminated silt and clay was recorded from the working pit. The laminated unit was seen to overlie sand and gravel resting on red-brown till. In 1944, the clay was only worked for the manufacture of agricultural drain tiles, but facing bricks were produced during the 1980s.\n\nIn and around the city of Aberdeen several clay pits were worked in the past; for example Seaton, Blackdog, Ferryhill, and Torry (Map 9). The sites of all but the first mentioned have long been abandoned and the exact extent of each working is unclear. About 1 m of crudely laminated ‘bluishyellow’ clay was exposed in the pit at Seaton Brick Works in 1944, but 4.9 m of similar material, beneath 0.9 m of gravel was recorded from the site by Jamieson (1858). Bricks were produced at Seaton during the 19th century. By 1944, however, the deposit was worked solely for the manufacture of earthenware pottery and horticultural ware, such as flower pots. The worked deposits are assigned to the Tullos Clay Member of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group.\n\nPeat\n\nWidespread commercial exploitation of peat in north-east Scotland has been limited by transportation costs and environmental concerns. Production for horticultural use and as fuel has been concentrated around New Pitsligo and Strichen in Buchan, but resources there are almost exhausted. Other patchy deposits of peat are widespread, but there are few major resources. Most are restricted to relatively inaccessible spreads of hill peat, many of which are covered by forestry (Chapter 6). Areas of basin peat occur on lower ground, but the bulk of these have been worked to the water table, or are preserved as nature reserves and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The use of peat as fuel by farmers and crofters has not been important in the recent past, but persists on a small scale. In western parts of the district it has a specialised application in whisky distilling.\n\nThe first systematic assessment of the peat deposits in Scotland began during the Second World War (Fraser, 1943), with the aim of evaluating their potential uses as fuel and in agriculture. The results from the first of a planned series of surveys, dealt with the deposits of Aberdeenshire, Banffshire and Morayshire (Fraser, 1948) and are summarised in (Table 5); subsequent systematic surveys were abandoned in the immediate postwar period. Assessments recommenced in 1949, but concentrated only on major deposits with a view to their potential use as fuel for peat-fired power stations (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, 1962). These surveys evaluated resources in south-west Scotland, the Western Highlands and Islands, Central Scotland, and Caithness, Shetland and Orkney (Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, 1964, 1965a, b, 1968). None of the deposits in north-east Scotland was included in these surveys, but the overall potential of Scottish peat for electricity generation was reviewed by Dryburgh (1978).\n\nFraser (1948) identified 46 areas of peat in north-east Scotland that were considered potentially workable (Table 5), but none of the deposits on 1:50 000 sheets 66E and 67 was investigated. In general terms, the hill peats are extensive, but thin, with much of the resource forming hags above the water table. The basin peats are thicker, but less extensive and predominantly water-saturated; many are relict and now eroding.\n\nBy the mid 1940s, most of the 4845 hectares (ha) of peat identified by Fraser, between Aberdeen and Elgin had been worked in a piecemeal fashion for fuel. In the 1960s, eight of the major peat mosses between Aberdeen and Fraserburgh (Table 5) were examined in detail by the Soil Survey (Glentworth and Muir, 1963). In general, the extent of the peat and amount of cutting that had occurred at each site, recorded in the later survey, were comparable to the figures given in Fraser (1943). The detailed later survey showed that maximum thickness of peat at each site was generally greater than that recorded by Fraser. The average thickness of peat that remained in cut areas, ranged between 25 per cent of maximum thickness recorded at Moss of Air, to 60 per cent of the maximum at St Fergus Moss. Recent geological mapping indicates that piecemeal working has continued, particularly up to the late 1970s, and many of formerly identified resources are now too thin and waterlogged to be attractive for commercial extraction.\n\nCommercial extraction of peat around New Pitsligo and Strichen reached its peak in the early 1990s. Seven to eight thousand tonnes per year is currently extracted from Lambhill Moss, by the Northern Peat and Moss Company, although remaining reserves here are small. Some 15 to 20 per cent of production is sold throughout Scotland for domestic fuel; the remainder is exported, via Fraserburgh, to southern Sweden, for use as fuel in a district heating plant. Commercial extraction of peat from St Fergus Moss commenced during 1998, with 7–8000 tonnes being produced in the first year of working; most of the material is also exported to Sweden for use as fuel, but some peat for horticultural use is also produced.\n\nMore than 3000 ha of peat has been mapped on Sheet 66E Banchory, most of which occurs as extensive hilltop spreads on the watershed between the catchments of the River Dee and Water of Feugh and the rivers and burns that drain south-eastwards into Strathmore. The hill peat is generally less than 2.5 m thick and much of it rests either on thin till or directly on the dominantly granite bedrock. The most notable spreads occur on the uplands, north and south of Glen Dye (1500 ha), between Little Kerloch [NO 674 874] and Leachie Hill [NO 739 853] (900 ha) and around Little Sheil Hill [NO 796 917] (350 ha). The hill peat has been worked on a piecemeal basis in several places, but much of the resource is currently sterilised by extensive forestry plantations. Minor deposits of thin, waterlogged basin peat are present around Loch of Park, on the northern edge of Sheet 66E.\n\nAbout 400 ha of basin peat occurs in the northern part of Sheet 67 Stonehaven within rock basins and in the floors of glacial drainage channels. Significant deposits (160 ha) occur in basins, linked by drainage channels, between Broomhill [NO 844 901] and Forester’s Croft [NO 873 883], and at Red Moss (120 ha), near Netherley [NO 855 934]. Mapping indicates that, apart from the deposit at Red Moss, the basin peat is generally thinner (1–2 m) than that commonly found north of Aberdeen, and it has not been worked as extensively.\n\nHydrogeology\n\nAcross the whole of north-east Scotland groundwater occurs within a wide range of superficial deposits as well as in bedrock (Robins, 1990). Storage capacity and permeability are the main controlling factors determining both the volume of groundwater stored within the aquifers and the rate of flow.\n\nAlluvial deposits\n\nThe deposits with the largest storage and highest permeability are the coarse alluvial gravels within the main river basins (Figure 10). The rivers Spey and Dee contain significant volumes of alluvial gravels below the water table; the Spey deposits are of particularly high permeability. Other rivers, notably the Deveron around Banff, and the Lossie, near Elgin, also have well developed alluvial gravel deposits and there are many other minor watercourses containing smaller amounts of water-saturated granular alluvium.\n\nRiver gravels beneath valley floors typically contain large amounts of groundwater relative to the volume of the deposits. The gravels have greater lateral continuity than the more heterogeneous deposits, such as glaciofluvial sand and gravel, resulting in more predictable flow routes for groundwater in the alluvial sequences. They are also generally characterised by high rates of through flow.\n\nThe relatively homogeneous nature of alluvial deposits and the presence of shallow water tables under the river floodplains means that there is considerable potential for exploitation of this type resource for supply. The potential for recharge to alluvial aquifers is also high, because they are located in valleys and, as surface run-off moves towards the main watercourses, a significant proportion of it infiltrates into the ground. Alluvial deposits act as an important storage medium for groundwater prior to its discharge (sometimes after several years storage) as base flow to rivers.\n\nGlaciofluvial deposits\n\nGlaciofluvial sand and gravel deposits are much more widespread than alluvial sediments, particularly along the Moray coast, but they commonly have a lower overall permeability. The heterogeneous nature of many glaciofluvial deposits also results in complex groundwater flow paths, for example via gravel-filled channels, many of which are discontinuous.\n\nGlaciofluvial sheet deposits commonly form terraces flanking the alluvium of the major river systems. They form higher ground on the valley sides and mostly lie above the water table. Glaciofluvial ice-contact sand and gravel forms extensive moundy deposits and much of this material also occurs above the local water table. The sandy nature of the soils developed on these terraced and moundy deposits means that recharge by rainfall to the water table is high where they occur, and both play an important role in the water cycle by providing base flow to rivers and wetland areas.\n\nBlown sand\n\nBlown sand deposits are very well sorted and have high intergranular storage capacity, but are generally of very limited thickness and lateral extent. Where underlain by peaty or clayey material above sea level, the basal parts of blown sand deposits are commonly saturated with groundwater and relatively high values for hydraulic conductivity are present. However, the deposits are restricted to coastal areas and the total volume of groundwater stored within them is generally quite small in comparison with that stored in other, less permeable material. The rate of recharge to these deposits is very high, with no surface runoff present, except where peaty interbeds form perched water tables.\n\nTill\n\nTill deposits are widespread across the district, most of them being relatively sandy. Owing to its compaction, higher clay content and heterogeneous nature, till contains less groundwater than the more porous sandy and gravelly deposits and, overall, its hydraulic conductivity is significantly lower. It is important, however, on a regional scale, for determining the movement of shallow groundwater. For example, many springs and seepage lines are present within this type of deposit, where sandier horizons and gravelly interbeds crop out. These can help sustain relatively high rates of groundwater flow. Springs and seepage lines are also commonly developed at the base of till units, particularly where they overlie less permeable fresh bedrock. Recharge to till deposits can be high where sandy horizons are present and more than 200 mm of rainfall per year can infiltrate to the water table.\n\nBedrock\n\nFresh pre-Palaeozoic igneous and metamorphic bedrock generally has a low permeability, but where shallow zones have been subjected to weathering, fractures may be enlarged allowing groundwater to move relatively freely. Flow and storage are dependent entirely on the presence of secondary voids such as joints and fractures within fault zones. This results in highly complex, unpredictable flowpaths. The Devonian and Permian sandstone aquifers near the Moray coast contain greater volumes of groundwater than the older rocks owing to their greater porosity and intergranular permeability. In spite of this, a large proportion of the total groundwater flow uses secondary voids to move through the aquifer.\n\nGroundwater quality\n\nShallow groundwater quality in the district is variable, although many shallow aquifers contain potable groundwater. Chemical quality depends to a large extent on the nature of the surface deposits. For example, groundwater in the Spey gravels is normally of good quality, but where overlain by waterlogged layers of peat or silt, significant local concentrations of iron and manganese may occur. This is due to the groundwater having a relatively low content of dissolved oxygen and higher than normal acidity, causing the dissolution of these elements. Elsewhere, the effects of intensive agricultural practices have influenced the quality of the groundwater, with the presence of locally high concentrations of nitrate derived from fertilisers. This is particularly noticeable around the Ythan estuary. Groundwater is particularly vulnerable to pollution where the water table is less than 5 m below the ground surface, and where sand or gravel deposits are present below the soil layer. In general terms, groundwater is of very good quality in bedrock aquifers.\n\nGroundwater exploitation\n\nGroundwater from springs as well as shallow and deep sources is abstracted for many hundreds of private domestic supplies in north-east Scotland. In addition, public supply sources include two deep boreholes and many shallow bores into alluvial aquifers. The industrial usage of groundwater has, to date, been limited to maltings, distilleries and agriculture-related activities, and the absence of high-yielding aquifers in urban areas such as Aberdeen has hindered development. However, several water boreholes were sunk into Devonian sandstones in the Elgin area, between 1990 and 1998. This relatively unexploited source appears to have the potential for further development.\n\nHistorically, groundwater has provided a safe, reliable water supply to many communities and individual dwellings across the area. The absence of public supply networks across much of the more rural parts of the district has necessitated the exploitation of hundreds of springs in many different settings. Where natural occurrences of groundwater were absent, shallow wells were constructed, commonly to depths of 4 to 10 m. Most farms had private wells, many of which exploited gravelly interbeds in till or the more permeable zone at rockhead. Where high-yielding springs were present, communities would organise a limited water distribution network. The larger towns, such as Peterhead and Aberdeen, relied on groups of springs to supply large numbers of people. The Peterhead spring supply was still in use until after the Second World War and was based around a group of seven springs on the Hill of Longhaven, 5 km south-west of the town.\n\nBeneath Aberdeen, superficial aquifers with more than 30 m of saturated granular material were exploited for factory supplies in the 19th century. The variable nature of the Quaternary deposits and indifferent water quality restricted usage, especially adjacent to the tidal sections of the rivers, where the shallow groundwater is brackish. The main supply for Aberdeen presently comes from intakes on the River Dee, including one at Cairnton [NO 665 965].\n\nThe nature of groundwater exploitation began to change towards the end of the 18th century when deep boreholes were first drilled into bedrock. Depths ranged from 10 m to greater than 100 m. However, the absence of widespread, highly permeable groundwater resources in the bedrock of the district has meant that relatively few deep boreholes have been drilled across north-east Scotland. Examples of public supply boreholes (Figure 10) include those at Turriff, where a Middle Devonian conglomerate aquifer is exploited, and at Burghead, where the local supply is sourced from Triassic, Permian and Devonian sandstones, but almost all the supply comes from the Permian strata. Deep boreholes in the Moray area produce low to moderate supplies for distilleries and maltings.\n\nOwing to their favourable hydraulic characteristics, shallow superficial aquifers remain the most heavily exploited type of aquifer for public supply. The River Spey groundwater scheme, located immediately to the south of Fochabers, is the latest scheme to abstract groundwater from gravel deposits and was commissioned in 1996. The main well field lies just outside the district, but is a good example of large-scale groundwater development. A total of 40 boreholes, some up to 20 m deep, have been sunk within the river gravels on the eastern side of the Spey. Each is capable of an abstraction rate of 10 litres per second. Recharge to the aquifer is by leakage from the Spey into the gravel beds between the boreholes and the river, by lateral groundwater movement from the valley sides and by direct infiltration of rainfall on the floodplain. Another example of alluvial aquifer exploitation occurs in the valley of the River Deveron, south of Banff. This is a much smaller abstraction scheme than on the Spey at Fochabers. It uses a horizontal infiltration design to collect water from the gravel, rather than a vertical borehole.\n\nThe exploitation of natural springs for public supply is now rare within north-east Scotland, with most supplies having a surface origin. A total of 20 springs are maintained by the North of Scotland Water Authority including one in Moray, eleven in Gordon and eight in Banff and Buchan. Owing to continual improvements in supplies, many of these springs may be decommissioned, either to comply with European requirements on water quality, or because of the replacement of several previously separate supplies by a single regional network.\n\nPlanning considerations and conservation issues\n\nOne of the most fascinating attributes of the landscape of north-east Scotland is the degree to which the topography reflects the interplay between rock type, structure and geomorphological processes, the latter largely driven by climate changes throughout the Cainozoic. As a consequence, the district contains many sites where geological sequences are preserved; these contain evidence critical to understanding the landscape evolution not only of north-east Scotland, but also northern Britain and north-west Europe during the Cainozoic. This latest part of Earth history is particularly important, as it provides the environmental setting within which the whole of human cultural and economic development has taken place. It is only during the last thirty years, however, that the importance of the Cainozoic geological record of the frequency and rate of naturally occurring environmental changes has been generally recognised. It provides base-line data against which anthropogenic degradation of the environment, such as temperature changes caused by increased CO2 emissions, elevated sea levels, or vegetation changes due to farming intensification, can be gauged.\n\nDecisions as to which Cainozoic sites should be conserved are based upon guidelines that try to encapsulate the range of scientific interest at each site. Some are designated as SSSIs on geological and geomorphological grounds. Short descriptions of several of these SSSIs are given in Appendix 1. Most of the key Quaternary sites were included in the Geological Conservation Review (GCR), initiated by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1977 and are fully described in Gordon and Sutherland (1993).\n\nSeveral important Quaternary sequences are also preserved within SSSIs, National Nature Reserves (NNRs), Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reserves and local nature reserves, which were originally designated mainly on the basis of their botanical and wildlife importance. An example is the NNR covering the Sands of Forvie, north of Newburgh; this covers an extensive area of active and stabilised dunes of blown sand up to 60 m in height (Ritchie, 1992). The reserve was first established in 1959. The area was designated a SSSI in 1971, for its coastal plant communities, colonies of sea birds (it is home to Britain’s largest population of Eider duck), as well as its coastal geomorphology. Holocene sediments on the banks of the Ythan estuary, within the SSSI, include a thin bed of grey sand, deposited by tsunami waves from the second Storegga slide. It occurs beneath blown sand, peat and clay, in boreholes at Waterside [NK 007 267] on the eastern side of the estuary (Smith, 1984; Smith, et al., 1983, 1999). This ‘tsunami deposit’, which was generated by a massive submarine landslide on the Norwegian continental margin, is analogous to that recorded from the cores taken in the Philorth valley near Fraserburgh (Appendix 1), about 40 km farther north.\n\nImportant Quaternary biogenic sequences are sometimes recorded from waterlogged peat mosses and lake basins, which are primarily conserved for their modern flora and fauna. For example, the Loch of Park, northeast of Banchory, is a local nature reserve that was established to protect its population of breeding birds, its reed beds and Alder woodland. Pollen records and radiocarbon ages, determined from Holocene and Late-glacial peats and organic muds recovered in cores taken from the lake basin, have been critical in establishing climatic and vegetational changes in north-east Scotland since deglaciation (Vasari, 1977). The Loch of Park succession is described in more detail in Appendix 1.\n\nKnowledge of the nature and distribution of Quaternary sediments are fundamental to decisions made regarding the economic and environmental well being of the district. Planning in the hinterland of Aberdeen, for example, not only requires forecasts of demand for housing, infrastructure and industrial construction, but also needs to ensure that adequate supplies of aggregates are available and that new building developments are not sited on the most attractive remaining aggregate resources. It was partly to this end that the detailed assessments of sand and gravel resources, described in Appendix 2, were undertaken between 1979 and 1990.\n\nDevelopment planning also benefits from knowledge of ground stability and foundation conditions and seismic hazard, which are discussed below, and groundwater vulnerability, described in the preceding section on hydrogeology. These and other factors, such as coastline evolution were initially evaluated for the hinterlands of Aberdeen and Peterhead, in two projects funded by the Scottish Office. The results of these two studies are presented in Smith (1983) and Peacock (1983).\n\nGround stability and foundation conditions\n\nEngineering properties of glacigenic sediments\n\nIt is well known that glacial deposits often present problems to the ground engineer owing to their inherent variability and the complex sequences in which they lie. Observations on modern glaciers have enabled the development of a process-based model (Boulton and Paul, 1976) that has been found applicable to several areas of lowland Britain (Paul and Little, 1991). This model distinguishes erosion and transport processes, which are responsible for the grading and plasticity of the sediments, from depositional and postdepositional processes, which are responsible for the packing and strength of the materials. At the larger scale, the model identifies a number of recurrent landform-sediment associations, which describe the geomorphology and facies architecture of the glacigenic sequences as a whole.\n\nBased on the analysis of commercial site investigation data held at the British Geological Survey, it is possible to classify foundation materials in the study area into three broad assemblages.\n\nRelatively thin (usually less than 5 m) glacigenic sequences, which lie on bedrock and may be weathered or glacially tectonised. They usually extend to surface, and comprise coarse glacial tills, sands and gravels. These sequences are normally found in upland areas and may be locally extensive.\n\nThick (5–10 m or more), generally complex glacigenic sequences of interdigitated tills, glacioflu vial sands, and glaciolacustrine/glaciomarine silts and clays, typically found as local valley or low ground embayment infills.\n\nThick (over 10 m), postglacial sequences of clays, silts and sands, together with interbedded peats, which overlie glacigenic sequences, found locally in bedrock depressions.\n\nAssemblage i is widespread across the area and appears to be present in the outcrop of each of the drift groups shown in (Figure 4) and described in Chapter 8. It seems common within the outcrops of the Central Grampian, East Grampian and Banffshire Coast drift groups, where it has been encountered in excavations for several road improvement schemes. Assemblage ii, by contrast, is more restricted in extent, being confined to the coastal lowlands and the lower parts of the adjacent valleys. To the west and north of Aberdeen excavations in the Don and Ythan valleys have shown local development of this assemblage involving sediments of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group. Similarly, excavations in the Feugh valley to the south-west of Aberdeen have revealed analogous sequences in sediments of the East Grampian Drift Group. Assemblage iii has been reported only rarely, mainly from coastal settings. In the Peterhead area, excavations to 20 m depth have revealed peats, sands and gravels resting on glacial deposits of both the Banffshire Coast and Logie-Buchan drift groups. Around St Fergus, similar sequences have been reported extending to 15 m depth.\n\nMost of the geotechnical properties described below deal with glacigenic successions, dominated by glacial diamictons (tills) and sampled from shallow boreholes and trial pits. A more detailed study of engineering properties of glacial sediments from sites throughout northeast Scotland (Ramsay, 1999) shows, however, that at any particular location, site investigations are required to adequately characterise the geotechnical properties of specific Quaternary sequences. Geotechnical information is not presented for the Central Highland Drift Group owing to the sparse, and unrepresentative coverage of site investigation data within its area of outcrop in the district.\n\nParticle size\n\nTernary composition plots (Figure 11) show that the glacial and glaciofluvial deposits within all of the drift groups are broadly sandy gravels, with an admixture of fine (silt and clay) particles. They are thus classified as clast-dominant to well-graded diamictons in the scheme of McGown and Derbyshire (1977). In detail, the sediments of the East Grampian Drift Group have a relatively constant proportion of fines (15–20%), although the proportions of sand and gravel can vary greatly. The sediments of the Mearns Drift Group appear indistinguishable from those of the East Grampian Drift Group on granulometric criteria alone. By contrast, sediments of the Logie-Buchan and Banffshire Coastal drift groups differ granulometrically both from those of the other two and from one another. Those of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group contain up to 40 per cent fines and around 30 per cent each of sand and gravel, whereas those of the Banffshire Coast Drift Group, although sandy, generally contain less gravel (less than 40 per cent) and have a fines content in the range 20 to 40 per cent.\n\nLiquid and plastic limits\n\nGlacial tills show a relationship between their liquid limit (LL) and plasticity index that arises from their characteristic particle-size distributions, which are themselves, in part, the result of crushing processes and subsequent modification (Dreimanis and Vagners, 1971; McGown, 1971), and also reflect the provenance of the deposits. This relationship is expressed on the plasticity chart as a straight line (the T-line of Boulton and Paul, 1976). Plasticity charts for glacial sediments from four of the north-east Scotland drift groups considered here (Figure 12) illustrate that they conform to this linear relationship. Comparison of these charts shows a number of differences between the drift groups, which reflect the differences in their grain-size and source material. Sediments of the East Grampian Drift Group ((Figure 12)a) are of relatively low plasticity (LL 20–30%) and values are scattered around the T-line, probably owing to their low fines content, and the possible inclusion of some weathered bedrock in the ‘till’ category. The field of values for sediments sampled from the Mearns Drift Group ((Figure 12)b) overlaps that for samples from the East Grampian Drift Group, which is expected from the apparently similar granulometry and clay-size mineralogy of both sets of samples.\n\nThe sediments of the Banffshire Coast Drift Group ((Figure 12)b) also plot along the T-line. Those from the Lhanbryde area are of generally low plasticity (LL 25–35%), which reflects their sandy character and incorporation of material from the local sandy bedrock. In fact, the tills at Lhanbryde are probably representative of the Central Grampian Drift Group. Those from St Fergus have a generally greater range of liquid limits (25–50%), possibly reflecting their derivation from offshore clayey strata, and also as a result, in some instances, of a concentration of fines by resedimentation processes. In a similar manner, sediments of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group ((Figure 12)a) also have generally high liquid limits (25–50%), presumably as the result of their large fines content. The probable inclusion of a number of glaciomarine and glaciolacustrine silts and clays, clayey deformation tills and resedimented deposits (‘flow tills’) in this group, in addition to lodgement tills, may be responsible for the spread of points below the T-line.\n\nThe mineralogy and grading of the sediments exert the fundamental control on their plasticity. (Figure 12) indicates that the sediments of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group are the most plastic of the four groups examined and those of the East Grampian Drift Group the least. Hall and Jarvis (1995) have reported the clay mineralogy of glacial sediments in the Ellon area, and have shown that the Hatton Till Formation of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group is dominated by illites and mixed illite smectites. By contrast, the Pitlurg Till Formation of the Banffshire Coast Drift Group, near its southern limit, contains a mixture of illites, illitesmectite and kaolinite. Although their composition has not been reported in the literature, the East Grampian and Mearns drift groups, which contain largely locally derived lodgement and deformation tills, may be expected to be dominated by kaolinite and quartz flour. This is supported by a study of the clay mineralogy of soils developed on the Logie-Buchan and Mearns drift groups (Glentworth et al., 1964), which showed that the latter contain higher proportions of kaolinitic clays and vermiculite and lower proportions of illite. If all of these results, taken together, are broadly representative of the groups as a whole, then at a given clay content, sediments of the Logie-Buchan Drift Group should behave more plastically than those of the Banffshire Coast Drift Group. The sediments of the East Grampian and Mearns drift groups will be less plastic still. The results shown in (Figure 12) confirm these comparisons.\n\nWater content and liquidity index\n\nThe in situ water content of a fine-grained sediment is determined by its stress history (the sequence of load changes in terms of effective stress) and is thus indicative of its geological origin and subsequent postdepositional history. In general, subglacial sediments have experienced larger loading events than those from ice-marginal settings and so, for a given composition, their water contents are normally lower. This is not to imply that the stress history of a glacial sediment is a simple function of the superincumbent weight of ice: it is now recognised (e.g. Boulton and Dobbie, 1993) that pore-water pressure plays a complex role in the control of subglacial stress and that for ice-marginal sediments, episodes of drying or freezing are often the most significant events in their stress histories (Boulton and Paul, 1976).\n\nFor a given stress history, the water content of a sediment is determined by the quantity and type of its clay content, which is reflected by its liquid and plastic limits. They are generally compared in terms of their liquidity index, a normalised value of water content that is relative to their liquid (LI=1) and plastic (LI=0) limits. A review of glacigenic deposits (Paul and Little, 1991) has shown that, in many areas of Britain, subglacial lodgement tills usually have liquidity indices in the range – 0.1 to – 0.5, whereas resedimented ice-marginal diamictons normally have higher liquidity indices in "
