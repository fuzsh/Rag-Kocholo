        "text": "Part I. Rank and Responsibilities!\n\nThe rank of a Civil War soldier indicated his duties and responsibilities within the army. The vast majority of soldiers were enlisted menï¿½they made up the bulk of the fighting force. Above them were noncommissioned officers (also considered enlisted soldiers) and commissioned officers. While officers had more prestige than privates, they also carried added burdens, since they were accountable for all the soldiers under their command.\n\nIn addition to the regular ranks, Civil War armies had several specialist ranks. Each regiment had a contingent of staff officers, which included surgeons, quartermasters, adjutants, and, on occasion, chaplains. There were also special ranks for soldiers in specific parts of a regiment, such as the field music (fife and drums), the regimental band (brass instruments and drums), and the color guard. The color guard was an honorary group chosen to carry the flag, or colors, of the regiment. It usually consisted of eight color corporals and one color sergeant.\n\nUSA Volunteers/Enlisted & Non-Commission Officers (Non-Com)\n\nPRIVATE:\n\nPrivates served as the backbone of the army and did most of the fighting in battle. Privates moved together shoulder to shoulder in straight battle lines and acted on the commands of their company officers. Privates rarely acted independently but rather worked as a group with the single purpose of fighting as a sheer force of numbers. CORPORAL:\n\nC orporals served either in the regimental color guard or in the individual companies of the regiment. During combat, infantry corporals who were not part of the color guard were positioned in the line of battle. They helped to keep a uniform line in the movement of the company. Privates looked to corporals to help guide them during combat. SERGEANT:\n\nSergeants served either in the Regimental Color Guard or in the individual Companies of the Regiment. There could be Divisions, related to administrative duties, within the rankï¿½for example, \"First Sergeant, Ordnance Sergeant, and Quartermaster Sergeant\" etc. Infantry Sergeants advanced either in or behind the line of battle, depending on individual responsibilities. They helped guide troop movements and kept the men in their positions by example and force of command and the true work horse of the Army. SERGEANT MAJOR:\n\nA Sergeant Major was a regimental staff member responsible for keeping reports for the regiment. In battle, he advanced on the left, behind the line of battle, to help guide troop movement.\n\nUSA Officers\n\nLIEUTENANT:\n\nL ieutenants were second in command of infantry and cavalry companies and artillery batteries. Infantry lieutenants assisted the company captain in their positions behind the line of battle by guiding the troops in their movements and firing. CAPTAIN:\n\nA Captain had command of a Company of Infantry or Cavalry, or an Artillery Battery of guns. In addition to his administrative duties, an Infantry Captain led his Company into battle by giving the proper commands for the movement and fighting of his troops, in concert with the other companies in the regiment. MAJOR:\n\nA Major was third in command of an Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery regiment and assisted the Colonel in administrative and combat duties. In battle, an infantry Major led the regimental attack, positioning himself at the front with the color guard. If the Colonel and the Lieutenant colonel were killed or wounded, the Major took command of the Regiment. LIEUTENANT COLONEL:\n\nA Lieutenant Colonel was the second in command of an Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery regiment. He had to assist the Colonel in all duties, and in battle, he helped lead the regiment into the fight. If the Colonel was killed or wounded, the Lieutenant Colonel immediately took command of the Regiment. COLONEL:\n\nA Colonel had the command and administrative duties for an Infantry, Cavalry, or Artillery regiment, made up of varying numbers of Companies. The Colonel was expected to lead his regiment into battle personally to ensure that it performed to its utmost ability. For this reason, Colonels were often killed or wounded in action. BRIGADIER GENERAL:\n\nA Brigadier General had the command and administrative duties for an Infantry or Cavalry Brigade, made up usually of four Regiments. He had to keep his men in good condition and ready to fight. In battle, he led his Brigade by instructing his regiments on where to fight. MAJOR GENERAL:\n\nA Major General had the command and administrative responsibilities for an Infantry division. He had to ensure that his Division was well cared for and ready to fight when needed. In battle, he commanded his division by issuing orders to his Brigade Commanders on where to position their troops. Part II. USA Cavalry\n\nCOMPANY or TROOP:\n\nThe The basic unit is the troop or company, organized pretty much the same way as an infantry company. The nominal strength was 100. If the troop dismounted for battle, 1 man in 4 would stay behind to guard the horses. BATTALION and REGIMENT:\n\nIn the Union Volunteers, 12 Cavalry Troops form a Regiment commanded by a Colonel. The Confederate Cavalry used a 10 Company Regiment. Again, the (Union) Regulars had a different organization: in the Regular units 2 Troops form a Squadron, 2 Squadrons form a Battalion, and 3 Battalions formed a Regiment. And again, there were groups of 4-8 Companies of Volunteer Cavalry which are called Battalions. BRIGADE, DIVISION, and CORPS:\n\nInitially, each Union Cavalry Regiment was assigned to an Infantry Division. The Confederates brigaded their Cavalry together. The Union eventually adopted this organization as well. As the war progressed, both sides formed Cavalry Divisions (again the South took the lead). The North also formed Cavalry Corps, and the South later also adopted this innovation. Part III. USA Artillery\n\nBATTERY:\n\nThe The basic unit of Artillery is the Battery, which has 4 to 6 guns, is commanded by a Captain, and has 4 Lieutenants, 12 or so NonComs, and 120 or so Privates. It typically had 4 guns in the South and 6 guns in the North. Batteries were a subdivided into gun crews of 20 or so, and into sections of 2 gun crews, 2 or 3 sections per Battery. A Gun Crew was commanded by a Sergeant and a section by a Lieutenant. BATTALION or BRIGADE:\n\nAt the start of the War, each side assigned one Battery attached to each Infantry Brigade, plus an Artillery reserve under the Army Commander. By mid-1862, larger organizations were used. The basic unit contained 3 or 4 Batteries of Artillery; it was called a Battalion in the South and a Brigade in the North (same unit, just a different name) and it was commanded by a Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, or Major. ARTILLERY RESERVE:\n\nAfter 1862, it was typical for each Infantry Division to have an Artillery Battalion attached, and each Corps or Army to have a reserve of two to five Battalions. Each Division's Artillery usually fought along side the Infantry, while the Corps/Army reserves were used to form the massed Batteries. The Artillery Reserve was commanded by a Brigadier General or Colonel. HEAVY ARTILLERY:\n\nThe Union organized some \"Heavy Artillery\" units, Regiments containing 10 Artillery Batteries (about 1,800 men) which had training both as Infantry and as Artillerists. They were organized in much the same way as Infantry units, but were quite a bit larger to provide enough men to run the guns. Originally raised to man the defenses of Washington, in 1864 they joined the Grant's Army, and then served more as Infantry. ENGINEERS:\n\nBoth sides raised special regiments of Engineers. They were organized similarly to the Infantry Regiments and were expert in building forts, entrenchments, bridges, and similar military construction. They were combatants but usually didn't do any fighting, instead continued to work on construction even when under fire."
