        "text": "It is the dawn of the 25th Century. As the Alpha and Beta Quadrants begin to heal after the destruction of Romulus and the Synth Attack on Mars, the Federation is only recently turning its gaze back towards the stars. Border territories, once bastions against foreign aggression, lie neglected and infested with crime. New powers rise from the ruins of the old; enemies become allies, and allies become enemies, seemingly in the blink of an eye.\n\nAs the stories of the legends of old come to an end, a new era of Starfleet Officer arises. New Legends are born every day; these are their stories.\n\nWelcome to Federation Space! A Star Trek RPG set in the same timeframe as Star Trek: Picard (25+ years after the events of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and Star Trek: Voyager). Players take the role of Starfleet officers stationed on Federation starships. The game combines Star Trek’s favorite species (both friend and foe) while also exploring new and unique species.\n\nUnder the resources menu to the left, you will find canon information about the Federation Space Universe.\n\nPlease note, this information may, or may not, follow official Star Trek Canon, but is the definitive source for all things related to Federation Space. If you are looking for specific information, it may be easier to use the Search function on the menu bar in the upper right.\n\nFederation Space was founded on March 1, 2000.
