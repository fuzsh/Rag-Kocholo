        "text": "Full Page Mustang Roundup\n\nAlumni Edition Stumbles\n\nWhen we began this full page edition in July, 1999, we had hopes of publishing it monthly. We have failed to do so. The page has not been updated since August until this issue.\n\nThe primary cause of the underachievement is the lack of time on the part of the editor to produce this page monthly. There is no lack of story ideas. However, researching the stories and producing the page, while a rewarding experience, does take time. Although this issue finally broke the long delays in publication, it does not contain the stories we had planned because of the time required to produce them.\n\nInvitations for seasoned alumni with high interest in alumni affairs, and East itself, to assist as editors of The Mustang Roundup Alumni Edition were unsuccessful in getting continuing help.\n\nAt this point the editor cannot determine what the likely schedule for publication of this page may be. Monthly consideration is still a possibility, though quarterly might be a more realistic expectation. For now, publication will be on an ad-hoc schedule. The editor regrets that lack of specificity."
