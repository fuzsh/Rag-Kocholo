He is currently the Principal and Founding Member of Machado | Patano and M|P Design Group, a conglomerate that provides full service engineering, surveying and architectural design services based in Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nAfter graduating from MSU in 2000 with a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering, Machado went to work for Moran, Seymour & Associates and Carubba Engineering as a project engineer. After 4 years of completing his engineering internship and obtaining his professional engineering license, he left consulting engineering and endeavored in the construction industry with Necaise Bros. Construction, an underground utility general contractor based in Gulfport, Mississippi. From 2004 – 2007 Machado served as a Project Executive for Necaise and partnered in a subsidiary company specializing in underground utility video inspections and infrastructure asset management called Gulf Coast Hydro-Vac.\n\nIn 2005 – 2006 Necaise and Hydro-Vac played a large role in the emergency response and disaster recovery efforts along the Mississippi Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina. The team was responsible for assisting First Responders with heavy equipment and debris clearing for search and rescue operations in the immediate aftermath of the storm. The team also performed numerous recovery projects including Long Beach debris hauling, US Hwy 90 Emergency Cleaning and Repairs, Harrison County Sand Beach Debris Sifting and Restoration, and many others. In 2006 Machado and Necaise testified at a Congressional Hearing in Washington D.C. regarding governmental contract procurement practices in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMachado eventually went back to pursuing his dream of owning a professional services design firm…something that started in the Study Lounge of McCain Hall while at MSU in the late 1990’s. In 2007, he started Machado | Patano, a small consulting civil engineering and surveying firm in Biloxi, Mississippi. In 2008 Machado obtained his MBA from Tulane University and sought to grow his new company. Through strategic partnerships and fortunate opportunities, Machado | Patano has grown into a full service engineering design firm that provides civil, structural, mechanical, electrical and surveying services. In 2013, Machado and his partners created M|P Design Group, an architectural design firm, in order to provide clients with turn-key design capabilities for architecture and engineering.\n\nMachado is married to Donna Cravens Machado and they have two daughters, Savannah and Addison. He is currently serving as Captain of Carnival for Gulf Coast Carnival Association, the oldest Carnival Association in Mississippi (111 years), and he is an active member of the MS Gulf Coast Big Game Fishing Club. He is also an active Board Member of the Mississippi State University Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering Advisory Board, a member of the Patrons Council of the Bulldog Club and a proud supporter of the MSU Foundation.\n\nTrent A.

He is also a founding Board Member of the FirstBanc Shares Inc., a holding company of The First, A National Banking Association, the sixth largest bank in the state.\n\nHe is a past chairman of the Mississippi Manufacturers Association. In 2004, he was appointed by Governor Haley Barbour to the Mississippi State Work Force Investment Board and has served on the Momentum WIRED Steering Committee. As Lieutenant Governor, Phil Bryant appointed him to the Mississippi Small Business Regulatory Review Committee in 2013. He is on the board of the Mississippi Automotive Manufacturer’s Association and was recently elected to serve on the board of the Business and Industry Political Education Committee (BIPEC).

He and his wife Elizabeth have two children, Sloan and Henry.\n\nGeorge Walker\n\nA native Mississippian, George grew up in Leland, Mississippi. After graduating from Washington School he went to the University of Mississippi, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity, and earned his Bachelor’s degree in Banking Finance in 1990.\n\nGeorge’s father, the late George Rea Walker, Jr., was an avid outdoorsman and 3rd generation farmer in the cotton seed industry, owning and operating Stoneville Pedigree Seed Company. George spent his summers working on the family farm and recalls vivid memories of duck hunting with his father on the Mississippi River and Shell Lake. Thus began his lifelong relationship with the outdoors. If he wasn’t working or duck hunting he was deer hunting on the family owned farms Stoneville and Panther Burn. All of these experiences and memories ingrained in George a passion for the outdoors and the necessity for its conservation.\n\nPresently George is the owner and Chief Executive Officer of Heritage Properties, Inc.; a property management real estate company, which focuses primarily on multifamily apartment communities. While the majority of properties are located in Mississippi, George has continued to expand Heritage Properties’ portfolio by developing communities in seven states across the U.S.; predominately across the south but as far reaching as North Dakota. Throughout the expansion and development process Heritage Properties has continued to win Home Builder’s Best in Mississippi awards consecutively for 12 years.\n\nGeorge has served on the Board of Directors for Metropolitan Bank, and serves on the board of District Six of Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He has been a member of the Mississippi Multi-Family Council, Home Builders Association of Jackson, and Home Builders Association of Mississippi. He was previously the President of the Mississippi Multi-Family Council from 1998-1999, and sat on the Board of Directors for the Mississippi Multi-Family Council in 2003. He also served on the Board of the Home Builders Association of Mississippi. He was previously on the Administrative Board of Christ United Methodist Church in Jackson, Mississippi. George has served on the board of Wildlife Mississippi and was past president.\n\nEvery year George looks forward to an annual turkey hunt in Texas; however, he enjoys going west and hunting for mule deer and elk as well. He has the benefit of taking friends, family, and youth to personal hunting camp known as Walker Farms in Kilmichael, Mississippi each year. In doing so, with any luck, he’s able to witness a young hunter get their first deer. If he can’t be found in Kilmichael, you can find him at one of his favorite spots to hunt, located at his camp in Canton, Mississippi on the Big Black River.\n\nGeorge’s young background in farming, and the personal time he’s spent outdoors throughout the last 30 years, created a desire to purchase numerous hardwood and pine tracts of land while using CRP & WRP programs. He has a down-to-earth, levelheaded, approach to conservation, and his hunting goal is to help make people aware of what Mississippi has to offer.\n\nWhen he isn’t working or hunting, he is spending time with his family – his wife of more than 30 years Christie and his four children – Caroline, Ann Elizabeth, Lillie, and Sarah Grea.\n\nSassy Draper Mauldin, Ex officio\n\nSassy, a native of Forrest City, Arkansas, serves as Scholarship Chair for the Foundation for Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. She holds a B.A. in mathematics from Mississippi State University and is a\n\nretired math teacher and retired paralegal, formerly with Chapman, Lewis, and Swan in Clarksdale. She serves part-time as the James C. Kennedy Wellness Center Garden Manager and is Director of the Growing Produce for Giveaway Project sponsored by James C. Kennedy.\n\nShe is on the Executive Committee of the Garden Clubs of Mississippi Board of Directors and coordinates it’s BeeGAP program to increase awareness about the importance of pollinators. She is the state director for Personal Ponies organization which places ponies with special needs children and is on the Board of the Charleston Arts Revitalization Effort.\n\nSassy and her husband Doug Mauldin have three children (Mary Ashley McNeely, Draper Mauldin and Doug Mauldin) and live in Cascilla where their family owns and operates Honeyheads Bee Company. She enjoys hunting deer and turkey and riding horses on her family farm."
