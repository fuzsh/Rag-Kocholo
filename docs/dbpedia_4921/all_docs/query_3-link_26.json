        "text": "Understanding military ranks can be tricky, especially when it comes to knowing the military ranks in order.\n\nSome of the military services -- the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps -- have their own enlisted military rank structures; the Coast Guard and Navy generally mirror each other; and the Space Force relies on the Air Force rank system with the exception of specialists, who replaced airmen.\n\nA service member's military rank doesn't just determine their level of responsibility, but also their pay. That's why each service's ranks are tied to paygrades in an \"enlisted,\" \"warrant officer\" and \"officer\" number system, written as the letters \"E,\" \"W,\" \"O\" and a number.\n\nFor example, the lowest military enlisted rank is \"E-1,\" while the highest military officer rank in use is \"O-10.\" While each service may call them something different, they all can be boiled down to \"E\" and \"O.\" The only rank names and abbreviations that are exactly the same across all services who use them are those for warrant officers.\n\nRelated: Calculate your military pay\n\nThese military ranks are displayed on service member uniforms through a series of symbols, such as chevrons, stripes, stars and bars.\n\nWhat Are the Military Ranks?\n\nTo learn the military ranks, you need to know what each service specifically calls the E and O levels, their abbreviations and how they look in the symbols, also known as insignias. For officers, Air Force, Army and Marine Corps symbols are largely the same, while the Navy and Coast Guard generally mirror each other.\n\nThe rank symbols can vary broadly for enlisted troops, with the Marine Corps and Army having many commonalities, and the Coast Guard and Navy again mirroring each other.\n\nAdditionally, while all the military services stick to the same paygrade structure, the Navy and Coast Guard organize their enlisted ranks in a \"rate\" system. Learn more about Navy enlisted rates and Coast Guard enlisted rates.\n\nWhat Is the Highest Military Rank?\n\nGenerally, the highest U.S. military rank is O-10, or a four-star general. A five-star rank, created during World War II, was meant to be reserved for wartime or exceptional circumstances. Only nine Americans ever have held this rank. The last living five-star general was Omar Bradley, who died in 1981.\n\nArmy Ranks\n\nThe best way to understand Army ranks in order is to see each pay grade paired with what the service calls the rank and the abbreviation used by the Army. You also can read more details for Army enlisted ranks and Army officer ranks.\n\nPaygrade\n\nRank\n\nMilitary Rank Abbreviation\n\nArmy Enlisted Ranks\n\nE-1Private (Recruit)PVTE-2PrivatePV2E-3Private First ClassPFCE-4SpecialistSPC\n\nArmy Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO) Ranks\n\nE-4CorporalCPLE-5SergeantSGTE-6Staff SergeantSSGE-7Sergeant First ClassSFCE-8\n\nMaster Sergeant\n\nFirst Sergeant\n\nMSG\n\n1SG\n\nE-9\n\nSergeant Major\n\nCommand Sergeant Major\n\nSGM\n\nCSM\n\nE-9 (special)Sergeant Major of the ArmySMA\n\nArmy Warrant Officer Ranks\n\nW-1Warrant Officer 1WO1W-2Chief Warrant Officer 2CW2W-3Chief Warrant Officer 3CW3W-4Chief Warrant Officer 4CW4W-5Chief Warrant Officer 5CW5\n\nArmy Commissioned Officers Ranks\n\nO-12nd Lieutenant2LTO-21st Lieutenant1LTO-3CaptainCPTO-4MajorMAJO-5Lieutenant ColonelLTCO-6ColonelCOLO-7Brigadier GeneralBGO-8Major GeneralMGO-9Lieutenant GeneralLTGO-10\n\nArmy Chief of Staff (special)\n\nGeneral\n\nGEN\n\nGEN\n\nAir Force Ranks\n\nThe best way to understand Air Force ranks in order is to see each paygrade paired with what the service calls the rank and the abbreviation used by the Air Force.

You also can see more specifics for Navy enlisted ranks, organized by rates; Navy officer ranks; Coast Guard enlisted ranks and rates; and Coast Guard officer ranks.\n\nMarine Corps Ranks\n\nThe best way to understand Marine Corps ranks in order is to see each paygrade paired with what the service calls the rank and the abbreviation used by the Marine Corps.
