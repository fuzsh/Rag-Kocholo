        "text": "The body of former Mississippi first lady Pat Fordice will lie in state at the Governor's Mansion on Sunday.\n\nGov. Haley Barbour and his wife Marsha have invited the public for the viewing, which will be from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nFordice died Thursday at her Madison home. She was 72. She had announced in December that she had cancer, but declined to identify the kind of cancer or to discuss her treatment.\n\nFuneral services were scheduled for 11 a.m. Monday at Galloway Memorial United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson.\n\nFordice's ex-husband, Kirk Fordice, served as governor from 1992 to 2000, becoming Mississippi's first governor to win consecutive terms. The Fordices divorced in 2000 after 44 years of marriage. Kirk Fordice died of leukemia in 2004 at age 70.\n\nPat Fordice championed arts, literacy and beautification projects, but close friends remember her as a woman with an adventurous spirit who embraced life and loved her family.\n\nFordice died Thursday at her Madison home, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. She was 72. She had announced in December that she had cancer, but declined to identify the kind of cancer or to discuss her treatment.\n\nFordice was described as someone who displayed dignity and grace, even through difficult periods in her own life.\n\n\"She was strong and resilient,\" said Joanna Heidel, a friend of Fordice for more than 20 years. \"In these last months, she was always optimistic. She did not want anybody to worry about her.\"\n\nFordice became a public figure after her then-husband Kirk Fordice, a brash, millionaire construction company owner, was elected in 1991 as Mississippi's first Republican governor since Reconstruction.\n\nShe was instrumental in bringing two popular international art exhibitions to Jackson. In 1996, \"Palaces of St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style\" featured tapestries, china, paintings and other glittering objects. Two years later, the \"Splendors of Versailles,\" featured French treasures.\n\n\"She was key to bringing all those things as a spokesperson. She did it so well,\" said Marty Wiseman, a political scientist and director of Mississippi State University's Stennis Institute of Government. \"Every time that she made an appearance, she made the state proud. She was the absolute model of class as far as playing the role of first lady and former first lady.\"\n\nBorn Patricia Owens in 1934, she attended Christian College in Columbia, Mo., and Memphis State University in Tennessee. She and Kirk Fordice had known each other since they attended high school in Memphis, Heidel said.\n\nThe Fordices married in 1955 and moved to Vicksburg in 1962 so Kirk could join the family business, Fordice Construction Co.\n\nIt was during the years in Vicksburg that Joanna Heidel and her husband, Jimmy, got to know Pat and Kirk Fordice. Jimmy Heidel was state economic development director when Kirk Fordice was governor.\n\n\"We traveled a lot with them. Not many people got to know her on the level that she could let go and have a good time. She loved to laugh. She adored her grandchildren and had a very good time with them,\" Heidel said.\n\nIn 1998, Pat Fordice showed her adventurous side in a parachute jump from an airplane. Her husband wasn't there to witness her tandem jump, and by then there were signs that their marriage was in trouble.\n\nThe Fordices divorced in 2000 after 44 years of marriage. Kirk Fordice died of leukemia in 2004 at age 70.\n\nState Rep. Rita Martinson, R-Madison, said Pat Fordice had strong family values.\n\n\"She was one of the 'Steel Magnolias' that you hear about,\" Martinson said. \"She stood by her principles at times when other people may have buckled. She stood firmly her ground in keeping her marriage intact as long as she possibly could.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Governor's Mansion in January 2000, Pat Fordice remained active as host of a radio talk show and co-host of a television talk show for Mississippi Public Broadcasting.\n\nShe also appeared in a series of commercials for Keep Mississippi Beautiful and the Mississippi Department of Transportation as part of an antilittering campaign.\n\nIn one ad, Fordice stopped a truck driven by a litterer, pointed a finger at him and chastised: \"I'm not your mama.\"\n\nThose ads left an indelible impression, said Barbara Dorr, executive director of Keep Mississippi Beautiful.\n\n\"Mrs. Fordice has become an icon for Keep Mississippi Beautiful on the same level as the crying Indian in the 1970s for Keep America Beautiful,\" Dorr said.\n\nIn recent years, Pat Fordice had supported the children's hospital at the University of Mississippi, the Mississippi School for the Arts, the International Ballet Competition and the Special Olympics.\n\nIn November 2005, she resigned as the city of Jackson's interim head of human and cultural services. At the time, Fordice said the full-time job was more than she could handle.\n\nIn 2005, she was presented the outstanding Mississippi Woman Award from the Mississippi State University President's Commission on the Status of Women for her charity work.\n\nIn accepting the award, Pat Fordice said she didn't set out to win anything when she began volunteering and advocating her causes.\n\n\"I've only done things I've loved to do,\" she said.\n\nPat Fordice continued taping her television talk show, \"Woman To Woman,\" with Juanita Doty until fall 2006. The show had been on the air since 2000.\n\nDoty said she spoke to Fordice's son, Hunter, on Thursday.\n\n\"He said Pat was the most incredible mother that there was. He said she died with the same grace and dignity that she was known for,\" Doty said. \"They had the chance to laugh and to cry and to say goodbye.\"\n\nPat Fordice is survived by three sons, a daughter and 12 grandchildren.\n\nAmong the reactions to her death:\n\n\"Pat Fordice was the most elegant and gracious first lady Mississippi has ever seen. When she was first lady, she used the resources of that office to promote the mission of Keep Mississippi Beautiful. She was always willing to do whatever she could to improve the lives of Mississippians who she loved so well.\" - Barbara Dorr, executive director of Keep Mississippi Beautiful.\n\n\"Pat Fordice was a model first lady. She represented our state with strength, dignity, and grace. As a respected ambassador for Mississippi, Pat became a symbol for making the state a better place. Her compassion and leadership served as an inspiration to those who knew her, and she will be missed.\" - Gov. Haley Barbour.\n\n\"I am deeply saddened to learn of my friend, Pat Fordice's, death. We shared a friendship that I will always treasure. She was a gracious lady with a great sense of humor and she was a tremendous ambassador for our state. Mrs. Fordice championed many worthy causes that have greatly impacted the lives of many people.\" - Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck.\n\n\"Pat Fordice served as Mississippi's first lady with grace and refinement. Her unwavering strength encouraged Mississippians to persevere during difficult circumstances. Regal yet approachable, she possessed a natural southern elegance that transcended her term and endeared her to our hearts.\" - U.S. Rep. Chip Pickering, R-Miss.\n\n\"Pat was the most gracious of ladies, the perfect hostess, Mississippi's star goodwill ambassador and truly one of the most admired and respected first ladies to ever grace the Governor's Mansion. Pat Fordice's passing leaves a large void in all that is good and representative of Mississippi.\" - State Auditor Phil Bryant.\n\n\"She was tremendously involved with many worthwhile endeavors while serving as first lady and continued to be active and involved after her tenure as first lady ended. She had a caring spirit for everyone. She will be missed. - Senate President Pro Tem Travis Little, R-Corinth.\n\n\"(She) was the epitome of grace and strength, the epitome of what's best about Mississippi.\"- state Sen. Charlie Ross, R-Brandon."
