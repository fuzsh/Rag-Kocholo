        "text": "The Governor of Mississippi, Kirk Fordice, was seriously injured in a fiery accident late Tuesday afternoon in which the car he was driving flipped on a rural stretch of highway in the northern part of the state.\n\nMr. Fordice, traveling alone at the time of the accident, was rushed to the state's major hospital here suffering from fractured ribs, a collapsed lung, multiple cuts and a possible spinal fracture. His left ear was also partly severed.\n\nLate this afternoon, doctors at the University of Mississippi Medical Center here said Mr. Fordice's life was no longer in danger. They said it was not clear when the Governor would be able to leave the hospital.\n\nMr. Fordice, a former construction company executive known for his blustery, blunt style, was on his way to an election-night party here in the state capital at the time of the accident, aides said. It was not uncommon, they said, for the Governor to drive on his own, adding that he has made a practice of taking Election Day off.\n\nHe had spent yesterday as a ''personal day,'' said the Governor's spokesman, Heath Hall.\n\nHighway patrol officers assigned to the Governor were traveling three miles in front of him, said the state's Commissioner of Public Safety, Jim Ingram.\n\nOfficials declined to speculate about why Mr. Fordice apparently lost control of his car, saying they would wait until an investigation was completed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
