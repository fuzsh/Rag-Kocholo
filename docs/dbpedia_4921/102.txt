Veterans Day will be celebrated on Monday, Nov. 12, at 11 a.m. on the front lawn of the Copiah County Courthouse. The speaker for the day will be Donald R. Taylor, Executive Director of the Department of Human Services for the State of Mississippi.

Before entering civilian service Taylor retired from the United States Army with the rank of Lt. Colonel.

Taylor is serving his second tenure as Executive Director of MDHS. In 1995, he was appointed to this position by Governor Kirk Fordice, and in January, 2004, he was appointed by Governor Haley Barber. During his years with MDHS he has instituted a number of reforms and begun several programs that have saved the taxpayers millions of dollars. His efforts in the area of youth services resulted in his being named Mississippiâ€™s Juvenile Justice Advocate of the Year.

During his military career Col. Taylor served the State of Mississippi by being responsible for the Senior Army ROTC program at the University of Mississippi and additionally, having the responsibility for the military science programs at Mississippi Valley State, Delta State, Northeast Community College and Rust College.

In 1996, Taylor was inducted into the U.S. Army Officers Candidate School Hall of Fame. He is a life member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and the Military Order of the Purple Heart.
