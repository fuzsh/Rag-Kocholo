        "text": "The traditional preoccupation of the French with the oddities of love, displayed with as much enthusiasm in French movies as in French literature, is once again hotly demonstrated in the new French picture, \"Manon,\" which a slyly winking Santa deposited at the Little CineMet yesterday.Inspired, in a manner of speaking, by the French novel, \"Manon Lescaut,\" which the Abbe Prevost unlimbered some 200 years ago, this strikingly candid picture tells the bold tale of faith and faithlessness between two strangely restless young lovers in the vortex of postwar France. But because it is much the same story the Abbe wrote centuries ago—that is, the ageless story of a fickle woman's corrupting influence on a man—the time and environment of the drama in this picture are of secondary account, the characters are—or at least should be—the important elements here.The characters are simply a young woman and a Resistance fighter who bravely rescues her from a mob of outraged French citizens bent upon vengeance at the war's end, takes her off to Paris and attempts to make a decent life with her while she persistently deceives him in the most corrupt and brazen ways. Loving luxury, the young woman falls in with black marketers and has affairs which her own brother arranges, while her lover frets and fumes. Eventually she drives her man to murder and then faithfully escapes with him on a ship which carries them to Palestine, where she poignantly dies in the desert sands.As a demonstration of human nature, we're afraid that this film Henri-Georges Clouzot has helped adapt and has directed fails to convey why a man would throw himself at the feet of an obviously no-good dame. Michel Auclair, who plays the fellow, is an apparently healthy, normal chap with no established reason for being the fool of love. And, Cecile Aubry, while attractive in a girlish and piquant way, is not the sort of woman for whom a fatal fascination seems in line. The two really carry no conviction of any more than a vigorous puppy love.However, the atmosphere of Paris in its demi-monde aspects after the war is graphically recreated. Serge Reggiani and Raymond Souplex, who appear as underworld black market characters, do so with considerable élan. And, there's one scene which takes place in a bordello that has both humor and viciousness. It is for these aspects, we imagine, that this picture received the grand prize at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nMANON, screen play by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jean Ferry; adapted from the novel. \"Manon Lescaut,\" by Abbe Prevost; directed by M. Clouzot; produced by Paul Edmond Decharme and presented by Discina International Films. At the Little CineMet.Manon . . . . . Cecile AubryRobert Des Grieux . . . . .
