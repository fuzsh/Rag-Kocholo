        "text": "Henri‐Georges Clouzot, the French master of suspense films, died of a heart attack Wednesday night in Paris. He was 69 years old.\n\nThe word auteur, used to mean the creator of a motion picture, fitted Mr. Clouzot more than most directors, for he wrote or rewrote the scenarios of most of his films. Among them were such triumphs of the suspense genre as “Diabolique” (1954) and “The Wages of Fear” (1952).\n\nHe was often likened to Alfred Hitchcock and, indeed, Mr. Hitchcock was regarded as seeking to meet a rival when he made a film, “Vertigo,” on the theme of “Diabolique”—about a plot to destroy a woman by making her believe she is mad.\n\nBuildup of Tension\n\nA different sort of tension marked the unforgettable “The Wages of Fear,” which follows two drifters driving truckloads of nitroglycerine through mountain terrain in South America. When the film, which won the grand prize at Cannes in 1953, was shown here, Bosley Crowther wrote: “Seldom have we experienced such a ride and such a buildup of nervous tension as are brilliantly developed in this film.”\n\nWith one eye, perhaps, on the box office, Mr. Clouzot barred the public from his stages during the filming of some of his suspense pictures, explaining that he did not want to give the ending away.\n\nExplaining the common mood of most of his pictures, he said: “The director is always his own first spectator, and when I am a spectator, I must have suspense.”\n\nFragments From Life\n\nA small, stocky, dark man with a tense gaze under bushy eyebrows, Mr. Clouzot said many of his plot devices were fragments recalled from life: a tramp through Brazil, the image of papers falling into a grave (in “The Raven”), the click of a typewriter in a police station (“Jenny Lamour”).\n\nThe film “Manon,” he said, was inspired by the sight of an overcrowded train just after the Liberation of France, and by the idea of a love scene played mutely against the whistle of the train. There is a difference from Hitchcock, however, in that Clouzot films tended to be somewhat more aware of society.\n\nNo Happy Police Films\n\n“The Raven” concerns the ravages of a poison‐pen writer in a French village, and “Jenny Lamour” and other Clouzot police stories are stronger on characterization than on violence.\n\n“I do know it is necessary for me to show the black side of men as well as the white side,” he explained. “I do not like the happy police film. To play with death is to cheat, and that is indecent.”\n\nHis films helped bring fame to Brigitte Bardot (in “The Truth”) and new types of roles to Yves Montand (as the truck driver in “The Wages of Fear”) and Louis Jouvet (as the detective in several pictures).\n\nMr. Clouzot, who was born in Niort in western France, studied law, then became a newspaperman in Paris, before turning to the movies. This occurred when he met Anatole Litvak, the director, and became his assistant.\n\nWon Major Awards\n\nHis own style, and emphasis on detail, quickly made a mark. He once observed that a single scene justified the whole of “Jenny Lamour”—a policeman and a criminal walking handcuffed down a corridor, “without being able to tell for certain who is the criminal and who is the policeman.”\n\nMr. Clouzot won major awards in Venice and Cannes, and a special award at Cannes for the documentary, “Le Mystère Picasso.” Among his other films were “The Murderer Lives at No. 21” and “Miquette.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Inez de Gonzales Clouzot, whom he married in 1965. His first wife, Vera, who co‐starred with Simone Signoret in “Diabolique,” died in 1963."
