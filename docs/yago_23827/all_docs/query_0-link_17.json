        "text": "“The best film Bunuel never made.” — karljkiplin, LETTERBOXD\n\nA masterful adaptation of Prévost’s novel, MANON is a decadent post-war noir from Henri-Georges Clouzot (THE WAGES OF FEAR, LES DIABOLIQUES). Manon (Cécile Aubry) is a village girl accused of collaborating with the Nazis who is rescued from imminent execution by a former French Resistance fighter (Michel Auclair). The couple move to Paris, but their relationship turns stormy as they struggle to survive. Clouzot’s astute portrayal of doomed young lovers caught in the disarray of post-war France wowed the jury of the 1949 Venice Film Festival, where it won the Golden Lion award. Unjustly overshadowed by the director’s suspense films, Manon now returns to screens in a glorious restoration."
