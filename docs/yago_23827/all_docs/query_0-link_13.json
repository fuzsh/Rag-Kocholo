        "text": "One of the earliest literary imaginings of a femme fatale, Manon has sparked the imagination of artists and their public across eras and genres – including choreographer Kenneth MacMillan, whose ballet you can rent on Ballet on Demand.\n\nCheck out this timeline of works of art (high and popular) inspired by the immortal heroine.\n\n1731\n\nL’Abbé Prévost publishes the novel L’Histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut.\n\nIt tells the story of a well-meaning young man, Des Grieux, led astray by his love for a young woman, Manon, who he finds irresistible. Many other men also fall for her – some willing to buy her off with a luxurious lifestyle. The original Material Girl, Manon cannot resist their offers. But she has Des Grieux wrapped around her finger, driving both of them to perdition.\n\nFull of twists, the plot includes gambling, theft and prostitution, and Manon is a character so unscrupulous that the book proved too scandalous for its time: it got banned in 1733 and 1735.\n\nIn 1753 its writer published a new edition, with a foreword warning its readers that this tale is “a terrible example of the force of passions”. Quite. Even today, the book is regularly on the curriculum of French high school students.\n\n1856\n\nThe first opera based on the story is composed by Daniel Auber. The story deviates slightly from Prévost’s novel, and this opera is not performed often. It features a popular aria for coloratura sopranos called C’est l’histoire amoureuse, also known as The Laughing Song:\n\n1884\n\nJules Massenet composes an opera based on the story: Manon – his most popular. Hear one of its most notable arias called Adieu, notre petite table. In it, Manon remembers her happy, carefree days with Des Grieux when they shared meals at “our little table”: “Will the future have the charms of those beautiful days already passed”, she asks. (Sadly not, in her case).\n\nTen years later he would write a one-act sequel, Le portrait de Manon, where Des Grieux is now an old man.\n\n1893\n\nGiacomo Puccini also writes an opera, this time called Manon Lescaut, which premieres in Turin. It shows how extraordinary Manon’s story is that it would inspire three operas, two of which remain very popular to this day.\n\n“Manon is a heroine I believe in and therefore she cannot fail to win the hearts of the public”, said Puccini at the time. “Why shouldn’t there be two* operas about Manon? A woman like Manon can have more than one lover. Massenet feels it as a Frenchman, with powder and minuets. I shall feel it as an Italian, with a desperate passion.” [*Puccini was only aware of Massenet’s opera, not Auber’s.]\n\n1949\n\nFamous for suspense films, director Henri-Georges Clouzot adapts the story to post-World War II France, turning up its dark overtones: Manon is a former Nazi collaborator, Des Grieux a Resistance fighter and Manon’s brother a black marketeer.\n\nThe unscrupulous choices of Manon and her brother, opposed to Des Grieux’s struggles, become a mirror for France’s own divided society.\n\nThe film goes on to win the Golden Lion at the 1949 Venice Film Festival. The not-so-subtle US publicity claims “Ooh-la-la! All the screen’s famous sirens stand in the shadow of this tempestuous French sizzler!”.\n\nA more traditional melodrama, the French-Italian Les Amours de Manon Lescaut (directed by Mario Costa) comes out five years later, set in the original time period of the book.\n\n1970\n\nThe film Manon 70 comes out, directed by Jean Aurel, starring Catherine Deneuve. Living in the swinging 60s, Manon is fashion conscious, free thinking and sexually liberated – the perfect vehicle for the challenge to social conventions surging at the time.\n\nSerge Gainsbourg writes and sings the title song, from the perspective of a man who loves her: “Cruel Manon… no, you will never know, Manon, how much I hate what you are… I must have lost my mind… I love you Manon”\n\nIn 1981, the story is also transposed to modern times by Japanese director Yoichi Higashi.\n\n1974\n\nKenneth MacMillan premieres his new ballet, Manon, with dancers Antoinette Sibley in the title role, Anthony Dowell as Des Grieux and David Wall as Lescaut, Manon’s brother.\n\nWhen asked to summarise the plot to a journalist, he replied: “you have a sixteen-year-old heroine who is beautiful and absolutely amoral, and a hero who is corrupted by her and becomes a cheat, a liar and a murderer. Not exactly your conventional ballet plot, is it?” From that non-conventional ballet story, he created a true classic.\n\nMacMillan also once said: “I wanted to make ballets in which an audience would become caught up with the fate of the characters I showed them”. With Manon, he certainly succeeded.\n\nNone of the music from Jules Massenet’s opera features in Kenneth MacMillan’s ballet version – MacMillan instead selected some of Massenet’s most well-known pieces, including an orchestrated version of his song Ouvre tes yeux bleus."
