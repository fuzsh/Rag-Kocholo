Criminal activities and charges can vary significantly, with offenses falling into two main categories in the United States: felonies and misdemeanors. While felonies are deemed more severe, misdemeanors are of a lower degree.

Misdemeanors themselves are further divided into different levels, with the third degree being less serious compared to the first degree. However, itâs important to note that a conviction for a third-degree misdemeanor, also known as an M3, can still warrant consequences, such as imprisonment for up to one year.

When facing such a situation, it is crucial to seek professional assistance from a skilled Pittsburgh DUI Attorney. Hiring an experienced lawyer, adept at handling similar cases, can prove invaluable in preparing a robust defense that would strategically work in your favor during legal proceedings.

Details of a Misdemeanor of Third Degree or M3 (Crimes and Punishments)

There are various acts that fall under this category of crime, including but not limited to:

Obstructing emergency vehicles

Disorderly conduct

Selling alcohol to minors

Defiant trespassing

Receiving stolen property with a value under $50

Providing false identification to law enforcement

Punishments and Penalties for M3 Offenses:

Incarceration for up to one year

Fines of up to $2,500

Itâs important to recognize that the actual repercussions for these crimes are determined after considering several factors, including the Offense Gravity Score (OGS). OGS is a numerical representation of the offenseâs severity as outlined in the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines.

OGS or Offense Gravity Score

Under the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, every offense is assigned an Offense Gravity Score (OGS), which is represented by a numerical value. The seriousness of the crime determines the increase in the OGS number.

Judgment

When it comes to declaring penalties, the judge considers various factors. These include:

OGS score: A low score leads to a reduction in the guideline sentence.

Prior criminal records: The judge examines your previous convictions and assigns a Prior Record Score (PRS). Having few or no prior arrests or convictions will result in a reduced guideline sentence.

Both scores are taken into account when determining the sentencing.

Itâs important to note that there is a wide range of potential sentences, and alternatives such as community service or probation may be considered.

Mandatory Minimum Sentences

Mandatory minimum sentences apply to certain crimes in Pennsylvania, which means the judge is obligated to sentence you to a specific number of years in prison, regardless of your prior record.

Professional Help

Seeking professional help is crucial in such cases. Hiring a Pittsburgh Criminal Lawyer ensures a detailed explanation of the process, guidance throughout, and protection of your rights. They will build a defense case that works in your favor, discrediting evidence and ultimately reducing your penalties.
