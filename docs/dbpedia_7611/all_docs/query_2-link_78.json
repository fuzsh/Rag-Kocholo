        "text": "In Texas, if you intentionally cause a bodily injury to another person, you can be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. However, if you commit the offense by impeding the breathing or circulation of a family member, this misdemeanor could turn into a third-degree felony.\n\nWhen it comes to domestic violence, avoiding a third-degree felony conviction can be complicated. With an experienced criminal defense lawyer on your side, you have an opportunity to prove your innocence or reduce the charge.\n\nLaws You Need to Know\n\nAccording to Texas Penal Code, Title 5, Chapter 22, Class A misdemeanor turns into a third-degree felony if the assault is committed against a person whose relationship is described by specific sections (71.0021(b), 71.003, 71.005) of the Family Code AND there is strangulation involved.\n\nSection 22.01 states that strangulation is an offense committed when you intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impede the normal breathing or blood circulation of another person by applying pressure on their throat or neck or by blocking their nose or mouth.\n\nWhile the wording seems clear, the circumstances of an assault rarely are. You need to work with a criminal defense attorney to navigate the legal nuances and ensure your rights are fully protected.\n\nWho Is a Family Member?\n\nThe third-degree felony charge for impeding breath or blood circulation only stands if the assault is domestic. The prosecution would have to demonstrate that the victim is:\n\nSpouse (current or former)\n\nParent of your child\n\nAdopted or foster child\n\nFoster parent\n\nChild\n\nGrandchild\n\nParent\n\nGrandparent\n\nSibling,\n\nAunt or uncle,\n\nCousins\n\nBesides immediate family, the law also protects dating partners.\n\nPenalties for Assault by Strangulation\n\nAccording to the Texas Penal Code, if you are convicted of attempting to strangle a family member for the first time, you could get a prison sentence of not less than 2 and not more than 10 years. In addition, you may have to pay a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIf you’ve been charged with the same type of assault for the second time, the charge gets bumped up to second-degree felony. The punishment includes a prison term between 2 and 20 years and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nBesides the immediate punishment, felony convictions may lead to such unpleasant consequences as:\n\nVoting restrictions\n\nLimitations of the right to carry firearms\n\nChild custody limitations\n\nEmployment issues (inability to hold a public office position)\n\nProblems with home loan approval\n\nMeanwhile, the punishment for a Class A misdemeanor is a fine that doesn’t exceed $4,000, a prison term of up to one year, or both.\n\nDefense Strategies\n\nTo reduce or drop the charge, the defense attorney would have to prove that the prosecution’s case doesn’t hold up. When it comes to assault with strangulation, common defense strategies include:\n\nLack of Intent\n\nYour criminal defense attorney may argue that you did not have the intention to impede the breathing of your family member. They may also present evidence to suggest that it was accidental.\n\nSelf-Defense\n\nIf you believed you were in imminent danger of harm from the alleged victim, your attorney could argue that you take your actions in self-defense.\n\nThis defense may require demonstrating that you reasonably believed that using force to impede the breathing of the family member was necessary to protect yourself.\n\nLack of Evidence\n\nYour defense attorney can challenge the prosecution’s evidence. They can question the reliability or credibility of witnesses, or point out inconsistencies in the accounts provided.\n\nThey may also argue that the evidence does not sufficiently support the charge of impeding breathing.\n\nFor example, if there aren’t any visible signs of bruising or abrasions, it usually means that the pressure wasn’t serious enough to strangle a person. This creates an opportunity to lessen the charges or prove your innocence.\n\nConsent\n\nIf there is evidence to suggest that the family member consented to your actions, your attorney may argue that you had the right to engage in the behavior in question.\n\nFor example, if the strangulation was part of the consented sexual activities.\n\nFalse Accusation\n\nThere is always a possibility to argue that the accusation itself is false, motivated by ulterior motives such as revenge, anger, or manipulation. Your attorney may present evidence or arguments to undermine the accuser’s credibility.\n\nSince each case is different, a criminal defense attorney always designs a unique defense plan with your special circumstances in mind. The goal is to protect your rights and ensure a fair outcome.\n\nWhat to Do If You Are Charged With a Third-Degree Assault on a Family Member\n\nIf you’ve been charged with a third-degree assault on a family member, it’s imperative to stay calm. The first thing to do is to obtain legal representation. Contact a qualified criminal defense attorney with experience in handling assault cases. Once you start working with a lawyer, they can explain exactly how to proceed further.\n\nThese legal professionals will be in charge of:\n\nConducting an independent investigation\n\nObtaining discovery materials (police reports, witness statements)\n\nCollecting and preserving evidence\n\nBuilding a strong defense strategy\n\nFiling all relevant documents on time\n\nExploring possibilities for plea negotiations (if applicable)\n\nRepresenting you at trial\n\nBy being honest with your attorney and assisting them whenever possible, you can improve your chances of reducing or dropping the charges.\n\nThings NOT to do after being charged with a third-degree assault on a family member are:\n\nCommunicate the details of your case to third parties, especially in a digital format (social media, messengers, email)\n\nConfronting the alleged victim\n\nYour criminal defense attorney will guide you through the do’s and don’ts of your behavior to prevent any actions that may hurt your case.\n\nHiring an Experienced Criminal Defense Lawyer\n\nIf you’ve been charged with a third-degree felony, you need professional legal representation.\n\nAt Starr Law, we have a team of experienced criminal defense lawyers who have successfully defended the rights of hundreds of clients in Plano and Frisco.\n\nDon’t wait.
