        "text": "Driving with a Suspended License\n\nIn New York State, Aggravated Unlicensed Operation in the Third Degree (AUO3) is the official name of the charge for driving with a suspended license. It is a misdemeanor criminal charge that is codified in Section 511 of Vehicle & Traffic Law. A conviction of this charge carries a maximum fine of $500 + $93 surcharge. More importantly, it will give the defendant a criminal record and the possibility of jail time.\n\nNot to be Confused with Unlicensed Operator\n\nAUO3 should not be confused with the charge of Unlicensed Operator (VTL 509-1). AUO3 is a criminal charge and Unlicensed Operator is a traffic violation. Sometimes motorists are charged with AUO3 and Unlicensed Operator. Sometimes motorists are just charged with Unlicensed Operator where they could have been charged with AUO3. A conviction of Unlicensed Operator will not leave you with a criminal record but will leave you with a violation on your driving record. Car insurance companies can increase their insurance rates with such a violation on the driving record. While less serious than an AUO3, a 509-1 should still be handled properly, preferably with an attorney.\n\nSuspended License vs. Suspended Privileges\n\nThere is no legal difference between someone who has a suspended license and someone who has suspended privileges. Suspended License refers to someone with a New York driverâs license. Suspended Privileges refers to someone with an out-of-state license. Technically, New York State cannot suspend the driverâs license of an out-of-state motorist. The most they can do is suspend their privileges to drive in New York. However, for all legal purposes, they are the same.\n\nBenjamin Goldman Law Office\n\nThe Benjamin Goldman Law Office is a New York State law firm.
