Official documentation of the personâs status as a victim of this section, âtrafficking in personsâ, or âa severe form of traffickingâ from a federal, state, or local government agency shall create a presumption that the personâs participation in any crime, except those deemed to be violent felonies pursuant to Â§ 4201 of this title, committed was a direct result of having been a victim of human trafficking but shall not be required for the court to grant a petition under this paragraph. If the petitioner can show to the satisfaction of the court that such petitioner is entitled to relief in a proceeding under this paragraph, the court shall grant the motion and, pursuant to this paragraph, enter an order vacating the adjudication of delinquency or judgment of conviction and dismissing the accusatory pleading, and may take such additional action as is appropriate in the circumstances or as justice requires.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any provisions of Chapter 43 of this title, Chapter 9 of Title 10, or any other law to the contrary, any person filing a motion under paragraph (j)(2) of this section in Superior Court or Family Court may also seek in that motion expungement of the criminal or juvenile record related to such conviction. If the court grants the motion to vacate the adjudication of delinquency or conviction under paragraph (j)(2) of this section and the movant also requested expungement, the courtâs order shall require expungement of the police and court records relating to the charge and conviction or adjudication of delinquency.

This order must contain a statement that the expungement is ordered under this paragraph (j)(4) and, notwithstanding any limitations to the contrary, that the provisions of Â§ Â§ 4372(e), 4376, and 4377 of this title apply to the order.\n\n(k) (1) The Human Trafficking Interagency Coordinating Council is renamed as the Delaware Anti-Trafficking Action Council (Council).
