        "text": "Sexual assault of any type is a serious offense. While many people understand the basic concepts of what constitutes sexual assault, the law differentiates between various degrees of the crime in order to more effectively prosecute offenders. In total, there are four degrees of sexual assault in California.\n\nFirst degree sexual assault is the most severe type of offense, while fourth degree is the least. In some cases fourth degree sexual assault may be charged as sexual battery, and it’s up to the prosecutor to make that decision.\n\nFirst Degree Sexual Assault\n\nFirst degree sexual assault (sometimes referred to as aggravated sexual assault) is the most severe degree of the crime.\n\nTo be convicted of first degree sexual assault, the prosecution must prove that:\n\nSexual penetration occurred\n\nOne of the following situations:\n\nThe victim was under the age of 13\n\nThe victim ranges in age from 13-18, and one of the following:\n\nA member of the same household as the perpetrator\n\nA relative of the perpetrator\n\nThe perpetrator was in a position of authority over the victim\n\nThe perpetrator was aided by another person or assailant, and one of the following:\n\nThe victim was incapacitated\n\nThe perpetrator used some form of force or coercion to assault the victim\n\nThe perpetrator was armed with a weapon\n\nThe victim was injured\n\nThe assault occurred while another crime was being committed by the perpetrator\n\nPunishments for first degree sexual assault, while ultimately up to the judge, can result in a life sentence to prison.\n\nSecond Degree Sexual Assault\n\nSecond degree sexual assault differs slightly from first degree in that it doesn’t include sexual penetration. However, from a legal standpoint, it is considered equally as damaging as first degree assault due to the violent nature of the crime and/or the victim’s inability to consent.\n\nTo be convicted of second degree sexual assault, the prosecution must prove that:\n\nSexual contact occurred\n\nAny of the situations listed in the requirements for first degree sexual assault (other than sexual penetration) occurred.\n\nConvictions for second degree sexual assault typically do not result in life imprisonment, but sentences of up to fifteen years are common.\n\nThird Degree Sexual Assault\n\nThird degree sexual assault, while less violent that first and second degree, is still a very serious crime.\n\nTo be convicted of third degree sexual assault, the prosecution must prove that:\n\nSexual penetration occurred\n\nOne of the following circumstances:\n\nThe victim was a minor\n\nThe victim was forced and/or coerced\n\nThe victim was incapacitated at the time\n\nThird degree sexual assault also carries a sentence of up to fifteen years in prison.\n\nFourth Degree Sexual Assault\n\nTo be convicted of fourth degree sexual assault, the prosecution must prove that:\n\nSexual contact occurred\n\nOne of the following circumstances:\n\nThe victim was a minor\n\nThe victim was forced and/or coerced\n\nThe victim was incapacitated at the time\n\nPunishments for fourth degree sexual assault vary more widely than the first three degrees, and heavily depend on the circumstances of the case.\n\nSexual Penetration vs Sexual Contact\n\nThe definitions for sexual penetration versus sexual contact are as follows:\n\nSexual Penetration: Includes sexual or anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, or the intrusion of any body part or any foreign object into the vaginal, anal or oral cavities.\n\nSexual Contact: Includes intentional touching of another person’s intimate parts (groin or buttocks, or the breasts of a female), or the clothing covering the intimate parts of another person with the aim of sexual gratification or arousal.\n\nDefending Against Sexual Assault Charges\n\nAlthough the above descriptions of the degrees of sexual assault are neatly laid out, it is important to remember that in reality, assault is never neat and tidy. Each sexual assault case is completely different, and thus it is important to work with an experienced criminal defense attorney if you’ve been charged with this type of crime.\n\nAt Quinnan Law, we have extensive experience defending clients from charges of sexual assault at all levels.
