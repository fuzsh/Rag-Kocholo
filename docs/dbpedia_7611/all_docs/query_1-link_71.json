Because of the high quality information and style of presentation, I knew that if I looked away I was going to miss out.\n\n—Quinten Graves, Oregon State Police\n\nThis training by far has been the most informative and most effective I’ve attended.

I have been taking law enforcement classes for over 30 years and by far this is the best presented and most useful.\n\n—Det. Brian Dale, Portland Police Bureau\n\nThe information presented was highly relevant to my job and was presented in a manner that was organized and very easy to digest.\n\n—Michael McGarvey, California State Prison, San Quentin\n\nThis was, by far and away the best training I have received in 15 plus years of Law Enforcement. The instructors are experienced, engaging, articulate, and very entertaining. I will be recommending this training to multiple agencies.\n\n—Mark Paynter, Oregon DOC\n\nYour training has made the greatest and most direct impact on my assignment of any training class that I’ve taken.\n\n—Ken Gelskey, National City Police Department\n\nThis training provided the useful tools necessary for assessing the veracity of a suspected child abuser, which goes a long way in helping to protect children.\n\n—Sunny Burgan, MSSW, LCSW, Social Work Supervisor, Santa Clara County DFCS\n\nI will continue to use and pass on this information because I really believe in the instructors and their approach.\n\n—Kimberly Meyer, Washoe County Sheriff’s Department\n\nYour training gave me the confidence and tools to interview the suspect for over 5 hours and to bring a closure to the case.\n\n—Daniel Phelan, San Jose Police Department"
