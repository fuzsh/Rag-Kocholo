        "text": "According to Open Doors, in 2019, more than 431,000 international students studied at the undergraduate level in the US, including bachelorâs degrees programs. If you hope to pursue a bachelorâs degree in the US, this guide can help you understand your options. Read on to find out what a bachelorâs degree is in the US, the different types of undergraduate degrees available, and career opportunities after graduation.\n\nWhat Is a Bachelorâs Degree in the US?\n\nA bachelorâs degree is the most common undergraduate degree awarded by universities and colleges in the US. Typically, a bachelorâs degree takes four to five years to complete and consists of 120 to 130 semester credit hours. You are expected to choose a major concentration (a specific area of study) and take additional required courses outside of your chosen major. While this may seem unconventional, it helps you receive a well-rounded education and develop critical thinking skills that can be applied in any career you decide to pursue.\n\nWhat Are the Types of Bachelorâs Degrees in the US?\n\nThe three most common bachelorâs degrees offered by the universities in the US are:\n\nBachelor of Arts (BA degree)\n\nBachelor of Science (BS degree)\n\nBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA degree)\n\nBachelor of Arts (BA Degree)\n\nA BA degree is designed for students who are interested in following a program in the liberal arts. Here are a few examples of areas you could focus on:\n\nCommunication\n\nEducation\n\nEnglish\n\nForeign languages\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPsychology\n\nSociology\n\nBachelor of Science (BS Degree)\n\nA BS degree is one of the most common undergraduate degrees in the US and (just like the name) focuses on science-related courses. Some common majors include:\n\nBiology\n\nBusiness\n\nChemistry\n\nComputer science\n\nEngineering\n\nMathematics\n\nNursing\n\nPhysics\n\nBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA Degree)\n\nIf you are interested in studying visual or performing arts, a BFA degree would be the best fit for you. Approximately two-thirds of BFA coursework focuses on the study of visual or fine arts, and one-third on liberal arts such as history, literature, philosophy, and psychology. Here are some examples of BFA degrees:\n\nCreative writing\n\nFilm and photography\n\nMusic\n\nTheater and dance\n\nVisual arts\n\nStart of Sticky Service Ad\n\nWhat Types of Schools Offer Bachelorâs Degrees in the US?\n\nThere are three different types of institutions in the US offering bachelorâs degrees:\n\nUniversities\n\nCommunity colleges\n\nLiberal arts colleges\n\nUniversities\n\nThere are two types of universities: public (or state) universities and private universities. Public universities are funded by the state in which they are located, while private universities are funded by endowment funds and tuition fees. The most common bachelorâs degrees offered by public and private universities are BA and BS degrees.\n\nCommunity Colleges\n\nCommunity colleges, sometimes known as junior colleges, offer a limited number of bachelorâs degree programs. Generally, community colleges award two-year associate degrees designed to help students transfer to a four-year degree program.Â\n\nLiberal Arts Colleges\n\nLiberal arts colleges focus on undergraduate programs. Students take a variety of courses in the humanities, arts, sciences, and social sciences. Liberal arts colleges offer BA, BFA, and BS degrees (and may offer associateâs and graduate degrees, too).Â\n\nLetâs take a look at a few Shorelight universities that provide undergraduate degree programs.\n\nAuburn University\n\nAuburn University is a public institution ranked #99 in National Universities by U.S. News and World Report. It offers more than 150 undergraduate degree programs including engineering, business, supply chain management, design, and more.\n\nLocated in the state of Alabama, Auburn University offers international students a welcoming and friendly environment to pursue their education. The student-faculty ratio is 20:1, with 35.3% of its classes having fewer than 20 students.\n\nFind out more about bachelorâs degree programs offered at Auburn>\n\nFlorida International University\n\nFounded in 1972, Florida International University is one of the largest public research universities in the US.

In a bachelorâs degree program in the US, you can:\n\nEnroll without declaring a majorâThis allows you to take courses from a variety of focus areas before deciding which track to pursue. During your first two years of study, you may be required to take classes in different subjects such as literature, science, social science, arts, and history.\n\nTransfer to another university or collegeâIn the US credit system, course credits can be transferred (relatively) easily between colleges and universities. Often, you can transfer to a university or college that is a better match with your goals, and without having to repeat courses!\n\nSpecialize in more than one areaâYou can select a major and a minor (secondary area of focus). You may even choose to pursue an interdisciplinary major, in which you design your own course of study across multiple departments, or opt for a double major (where you complete two majors over the same period of study).\n\nParticipate in co-op programs for real-world work experienceâSome universities offer paid internship programs, known as co-ops, for students to work in their related field while still enrolled in college. For example, the University of the Pacific provides international students in the School of Engineering and Computer Science the opportunity to enhance their skills through their CO-OP program.\n\nBe eligible for OPT internship/employment opportunities after graduationâWith Optional Practical Training (OPT), you can work full time in the US for a maximum of 12 months. If you are pursuing a bachelorâs degree in STEM, you can apply for an extension of 24 months.\n\nBenefits of Getting a Bachelorâs Degree\n\nA bachelorâs degree is a credential typically earned after four years of study at a US university or college. Many global employers require a bachelorâs degree for entry-level roles. Here are just a few benefits of obtaining a bachelorâs degree:\n\nAccess to More Job Opportunities\n\nMore than 80% of job opportunities advertised online in the US require a bachelorâs degree qualification. Employers find that the skills developed during a bachelorâs degree program, not only in oneâs major but also in communication, analytics, research, and problem solving, indicate more qualified candidates compared to applicants without a bachelorâs degree.\n\nAbility to Pursue a Career in Your Preferred Field\n\nA bachelorâs degree develops the required qualifications for your ideal career path. For example, if you are a creative individual and want to explore roles in marketing, by majoring in marketing and/or advertising, you can apply to a wide range of marketing jobs, from social media manager or sales manager, to market research analyst or data scientist. No matter what you study, a bachelorâs degree can open a wide range of career opportunities for you to pursue.Â\n\nHigher Earning Potential\n\nIn the US, obtaining a bachelorâs degree increases your earning potential by 75% compared to those with only a high school diploma. In 2019, professionals with a bachelorâs degree earned an average of $70,000 annually!Â\n\nThe academic and practical knowledge gained through a typical bachelorâs degree curriculum increases your professional skills and widens the scope of work you are able to perform. This allows you to apply to more skilled jobs with higher salaries and opportunities for growth.\n\nNetworking Opportunities\n\nWhether you are studying online or on campus, during your bachelorâs degree program you have the chance to meet people from around the world. Your fellow students may one day pursue a job in the same industry and become your coworker, a visiting professor may become your employer, or an internship opportunity can introduce you to your future job. A bachelorâs degree program can build your professional network, a most valuable resource for your professional and personal growth.\n\nPursuing a bachelorâs degree has many benefits, and for many students it is a pathway to build a better future. A Shorelight advisor can help you identify how to get a bachelorâs degree, which program and university will best suit your goals, current skills, budget, and more.\n\nEnd of Sticky Service Ad\n\nCost of Getting a Bachelorâs Degree at a College or University\n\nYour tuition will likely be the largest part of your costs of studying at a US college or university. Total costs can vary depending on where you choose to enroll for your bachelorâs degree program, whether your school is public or private, whether you qualify for financial aid and/or scholarships, and the amount of time you are enrolled. (How long does it take for a bachelorâs degree? Most students take four or five years to graduate.)Â\n\nAn engineering, pre-medical, or pre-law bachelorâs program may have higher tuition compared to business, language, or physical education majors, because of the length of the program and the resources required to obtain the qualification. For example, a pre-medical degree can take up to six years to complete. Lab equipment and hospital resources may be required for coursework, which cost more compared to the resources required to complete a four-year language degree.\n\nThe university you choose also affects your costs. Public universities offer degrees that cost 73% less compared to private universities. Typically, this is because a public university receives government funding, whereas private universities rely on tuition, endowments, and donations from individual benefactors, foundations, and private organizations.\n\nIn addition to tuition, it is important to consider living expenses while you are studying for your bachelorâs degree, including rent, food, utility expenses, medicine, and other daily essentials.\n\nThere are a multitude of resources available for you to manage the cost of your education, such as scholarships, grants, and other financial aid.Â\n\nSpeaking to an advisor can help you to get a better understanding of how to get a bachelorâs degree, and they can provide step-by-step guidance on how to submit your application. It is also important to start preparing your application early, as arranging all the requirements for your application in advance can help you stay ahead of unexpected delays.\n\nRequirements to Apply for a Bachelorâs Degree Program\n\nOnce you have an idea of which bachelorâs degree program you would like to apply for, the next step involves gathering the documents needed to proceed with your application.Â\n\nHere is a sample college application process checklist:\n\nHigh school transcript (if it is in another language, a certified translation to English is required)\n\nEnglish language proficiency test\n\nSAT/ACT test scores\n\nProof of finances\n\nPersonal statements or essays\n\nLetters of recommendation\n\nCopy of your passportÂ\n\nApplication fees\n\nThe requirements to apply for a bachelorâs degree may vary based on the university. Some universities may require a resume or CV along with your application, while others may want a record of your extracurricular and volunteer activities. Speak with your advisors and university representatives to understand whatâs required for your preferred schoolsâ application process, so you can stay on track with application deadlines and avoid delays.Â\n\nWho Should Seek a Bachelorâs Degree\n\nWhether you are a student or professional of any age or background, obtaining a bachelorâs degree in the US can get you closer to your goals. A bachelorâs degree program helps you become an expert in your preferred field of study by developing your theoretical and practical knowledge â which can then be useful for your career in the US (or anywhere in the world). Anyone who has a keen interest to learn, develop their skills, and expand their future opportunities can consider seeking a bachelorâs degree.\n\nNo matter which bachelorâs degree program you choose, studying in the US can be an exciting and rewarding experience. If you need help applying or deciding which university or college is the best fit for you, you can always reach out to an education advisor for personalized guidance.Â"
