        "text": "Criminal activities and charges can vary significantly, with offenses falling into two main categories in the United States: felonies and misdemeanors. While felonies are deemed more severe, misdemeanors are of a lower degree.\n\nMisdemeanors themselves are further divided into different levels, with the third degree being less serious compared to the first degree. However, it’s important to note that a conviction for a third-degree misdemeanor, also known as an M3, can still warrant consequences, such as imprisonment for up to one year.\n\nWhen facing such a situation, it is crucial to seek professional assistance from a skilled Pittsburgh DUI Attorney. Hiring an experienced lawyer, adept at handling similar cases, can prove invaluable in preparing a robust defense that would strategically work in your favor during legal proceedings.\n\nDetails of a Misdemeanor of Third Degree or M3 (Crimes and Punishments)\n\nThere are various acts that fall under this category of crime, including but not limited to:\n\nObstructing emergency vehicles\n\nDisorderly conduct\n\nSelling alcohol to minors\n\nDefiant trespassing\n\nReceiving stolen property with a value under $50\n\nProviding false identification to law enforcement\n\nPunishments and Penalties for M3 Offenses:\n\nIncarceration for up to one year\n\nFines of up to $2,500\n\nIt’s important to recognize that the actual repercussions for these crimes are determined after considering several factors, including the Offense Gravity Score (OGS). OGS is a numerical representation of the offense’s severity as outlined in the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nOGS or Offense Gravity Score\n\nUnder the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, every offense is assigned an Offense Gravity Score (OGS), which is represented by a numerical value. The seriousness of the crime determines the increase in the OGS number.\n\nJudgment\n\nWhen it comes to declaring penalties, the judge considers various factors. These include:\n\nOGS score: A low score leads to a reduction in the guideline sentence.\n\nPrior criminal records: The judge examines your previous convictions and assigns a Prior Record Score (PRS). Having few or no prior arrests or convictions will result in a reduced guideline sentence.\n\nBoth scores are taken into account when determining the sentencing.\n\nIt’s important to note that there is a wide range of potential sentences, and alternatives such as community service or probation may be considered.\n\nMandatory Minimum Sentences\n\nMandatory minimum sentences apply to certain crimes in Pennsylvania, which means the judge is obligated to sentence you to a specific number of years in prison, regardless of your prior record.\n\nProfessional Help\n\nSeeking professional help is crucial in such cases. Hiring a Pittsburgh Criminal Lawyer ensures a detailed explanation of the process, guidance throughout, and protection of your rights. They will build a defense case that works in your favor, discrediting evidence and ultimately reducing your penalties.\n\nIf you are facing charges, contact the Pittsburgh Criminal Lawyers at Logue Law Group today at (844) PITT-DUI or reach out to us online.
