        "text": "3rd Degree DWI\n\n3rd Degree DWI in Minnesota is a gross misdemeanor offense. It is charged as a 3rd degree DWI because there was one aggravating factor present at the time of the offense (a prior offense within the past 10 years or a reading above .16) or the defendant refused to submit to the chemical test. There are possible mandatory penalties and long-term monitoring that may apply. In addition, your license plates will be revoked, unless you refused on a first-time offense.\n\nThe outcome will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some, you may be able to get a Careless Driving – rather than a plea to a DWI – or a stay of imposition, but a plea to a 4th Degree DWI as a misdemeanor is also a positive, and more likely, outcome when facing gross misdemeanor consequences.\n\nConsequences\n\nThe likely outcome will depend on why it's a 3rd Degree DWI - i.e. it's a second-time offense within 10 years, the reading was above .16, or it's a refusal.\n\nSecond Offense within Ten Years - If the 3rd Degree DWI charge stems from this aggravating factor, mandatory penalties come into play. Namely, statute requires the driver to serve 30 days, with 48 hours to be serve consecutively in local jail and the remaining 28 days to be served on house arrest. Despite this being a mandatory penalty, there is always room for negotiation. With a proper legal strategy and team to implement it, this mandatory penalty can be overcome to avoid the time in custody, for instance.\n\n.16 or more reading - A third degree DWI will be charged for first-time offenders who had elevated readings - i.e. twice the legal limit or more. There are no mandatory penalties. Often, the State attorney will want lengthier community service or even some jail time due to the high reading. But, like before, this is where a properly developed and implemented 3rd Degree DWI defense strategy can lead to very favorable results - such as a 4th Degree DWI plea, with a standard disposition to follow (no jail, minimal community service, and small fine).\n\nRefusal - A 3rd Degree DWI Refusal is similar to a situation in which the driver had a high reading. There are no mandatory penalties, but prosecutors often seek stiffer penalties than a standard first-time offense. This is overcome easily with the right strategy, as detailed before.\n\nAlong with the criminal penalties, the collateral consequences are just as significant. The driver will lose their license for one-year. If it was a first-time refusal, the revocation period may be reduced to as little as 30- or 90-days if the driver was convicted of a misdemeanor 4th Degree DWI or 3rd Degree DWI Refusal, respectively. In addition, license plates may be impounded. Getting a fully valid license after the revocation period costs more than $700. These are the hidden costs associated with a DWI that make getting a 3rd Degree DWI attorney on your side immediately so critical.\n\nFinally, even though a 3rd Degree DWI is only a gross misdemeanor, it is still a criminal offense and will force you to reveal to future employers that you have been convicted of a crime. Having an attorney to represent you will give you a greater chance of not serving jail time, possibly even allow you to plea down to a 4th degree DWI, or a careless driving conviction, depending on the circumstances of the offense.\n\nCase Results\n\nWe have successfully defended countless DWI's for our clients, including negotiating DWI charges down to speeding tickets.
