        "text": "New Brunswick NJ Third Degree Offense Lawyer\n\nThe largest block of indictable charges heard at the Middlesex County Superior Court are third degree crimes. Irrespective of the nature of the criminal offense, the greatest probability is that an indictment will involve a third degree crime. Although this may be the case, an offense falling within this grade is a felony carries of $10,000 in potential fines and can result in as much as 5 years in prison. In you were arrested and/or charged with a third degree crime in Piscataway, Woodbridge, Monroe, Old Bridge or Edison, there is little doubt that you need to be represented by a skilled attorney.

A lawyer with the knowledge and tools to successfully defend you at the county courthouse in New Brunswick is ready to meet you for a free consultation or over the telephone at 732-246-7126.\n\nPenalties For A Third Degree Crime: Fines & Jail Time\n\nThe fines and jail time that apply in the event of conviction for a third degree crime are significant. The fine can reach $15,000. As if this wasn’t intimidating enough, a conviction can result in a five (5) year jail sentence.\n\nCommon 3rd Degree Crimes\n\nAs stated, there is a wide range of offenses that fall within this grade of offense. There are some charges that are, however, filed more often than others. The following are some of them:\n\nShoplifting Involving Merchandise With a Value Between $500 and $75,000\n\nPossession of Heroin\n\nIntent to Distribute Marijuana (if weight is between 1 ounce and 5 pounds)\n\nAggravated Assault (except where “serious bodily injury” is involved)\n\nPrescription Drug Fraud\n\nTerroristic Threats\n\nPresumptions When It Comes to Jail\n\nIf a defendant has no prior record, there is a presumption that he or she should be subject to probation rather than jail. If, however, the individual has a previous criminal conviction, the presumptive range of prison is between 3-5 years.\n\nPretrial Intervention for 3rd Degree Charges\n\nNew Jersey law permits “diversion” of certain criminal offenses by way of a program known as Pretrial Intervention or PTI. An individual can avoid prosecution through this program, as well a criminal record.\n\nImmigration Consequences If Convicted\n\nFederal law provides for removal of non-citizens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony. While there is an array of third degree charges that are considered aggravated felonies, possession and distribution of scheduled drugs like heroin, cocaine, and other forms of CDS are the biggest issues at this offense grade.\n\nExperienced Middlesex County Third Degree Crime Lawyers\n\nThe Law Offices of Jonathan F.
