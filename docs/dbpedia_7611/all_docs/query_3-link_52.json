        "text": "This page provides general information about criminal penalties. After a person has been convicted of a crime, a judge considers many factors before imposing a sentence. A judge can impose a sentence that includes a jail or prison term, probation, a fine, community service, restitution, or a combination of these penalties. One of the factors a judge considers when deciding what penalties to impose is the type of crime that was committed.\n\nClassification of Criminal Offenses\n\nCrimes are classified into three categories: felonies, misdemeanors and infractions. To determine what category a crime falls into, look at the law in the Utah Code (if state law), or the appropriate city or county code. Most criminal statutes will say how the crime is classified.\n\nFelonies\n\nA felony is a major crime that can be punished with imprisonment, a fine, or both. There are four categories of felonies.\n\nSee Utah Code ยง76-3-204 and ยง76-3-301\n\nInfractions\n\nAn infraction is punishable by a fine up to $750, compensatory service, forfeiture, disqualification, or a combination of those punishments.\n\nCompensatory Service\n\nIt may be possible to perform service or unpaid work instead of paying a criminal fine. This is called \"compensatory service.\" Each hour of compensatory service is worth $10.00. Compensatory service can be performed for:\n\na state or local government agency;\n\na nonprofit organization; or\n\nany other entity or organization if prior approval is obtained from the court.\n\nUtah Code 76-3-301.7.\n\nHow a Sentence is Determined\n\nThe judge determines the sentence of a person convicted of a crime using the Utah Sentence and Release Guidelines. These are available on the Utah Sentencing Commission's website.\n\nThe Guidelines also provide aggravating and mitigating factors that can be considered in sentencing.\n\nAggravating factors\n\nThese are facts of the case that can make the punishment more severe, including:\n\nwhether the victim suffered substantial bodily injury;\n\nwhether the offense was extremely cruel or depraved;\n\nwhether the offender was in a position of authority over the victim;\n\nwhether the victim was unusually vulnerable.\n\nwhether the victim was selected because of a personal attribute. Utah Code 76-3-23.14.\n\nA penalty can also be more severe if:\n\nthe person committed the crime with two or more other people;\n\nthe person used a dangerous weapon on or near a school;\n\nthe person committed the crime in the presence of a child;\n\nthe person is determined to have committed a hate crime;\n\nthe person is determined to be a habitual offender;\n\nthe offense was committed while in prison.\n\nMitigating factors\n\nThese are facts of the case that can make the punishment less severe, including:\n\nwhether the offender was exceptionally cooperative with law enforcement;\n\nis a good candidate for treatment;\n\nhas developmental disabilities.\n\nThe Sentencing Process\n\nHow the sentencing process works depends on the type of case. There are two types of cases: non-capital cases, where the possible punishment does not include the death penalty and capital cases, where a defendant could be sentenced to death.\n\nNon-Capital Cases\n\nA person convicted of a crime has the right to be sentenced in no fewer than two and no more than 45 days after conviction or entry of a plea. The defendant can waive that time frame and be sentenced on the day of conviction or plea. The defendant may also choose to be sentenced after 45 days if they need more time to prepare for sentencing.\n\nIn felony cases, the judge often orders the Department of Corrections' Division of Adult Probation and Parole (AP&P) to prepare a pre-sentence report. This confidential report for the judge includes:\n\nthe police report;\n\nthe defendant's prior adult and juvenile record;\n\nthe defendant's statement;\n\ndrug and alcohol history;\n\nfamily history;\n\nprobation history;\n\nimpact of the crime on the victim;\n\na sentencing recommendation for the judge's consideration.\n\nVictims and the defendant have the right to speak at the sentencing hearing. A judge making a sentencing decision considers their remarks along with the pre-sentence report and other evidence.\n\nCapital Cases\n\nA sentencing hearing is held at which defense counsel introduces evidence to show mitigating circumstances, and the state may introduce evidence to show aggravating circumstances. The jury or judge then deliberates to determine whether the person should be given the death penalty or a life sentence."
