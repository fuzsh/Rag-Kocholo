        "text": "This summer, we witnessed a new chapter in our nation’s fight against racism, as citizens marched together in protest against multiple extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. It was an “aha” moment felt across the country, and around the world. The tragic events that led to this moment were the first of what has become a “one-two punch,” with the Capitol insurrection marking one of the darkest days in America’s history as we witnessed a breach of our Capitol—an unprecedented moment in modern history. With the world watching, we saw something that wasn’t new: the difference in treatment between White Americans committing treason and Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor walking out of a store or sleeping in their home. It was impossible to process that those who attacked the Capitol could simply walk away, unhindered as they left the scene of a grievous violent crime.\n\nThe collective reaction to this type of injustice made waves throughout our society this summer, extending to corporate America. Many corporations issued statements against racism, but they were quickly met with backlash from Black employees who strongly asserted that their lived experiences were fundamentally different than the expressions of solidarity articulated. This backlash elevated DEI to what is now an enterprise risk for every major company, and a risk for every CEO at its helm.\n\nThe simple truth is that those occupying the C-suites have an incredible opportunity to lead us toward greater equality in our society. Racial equity in the workplace is crucial to changing the narrative on race in our communities. Until White Americans work in diverse organizations and share social circles with Black Americans, the narrative won't change. Advancing racial equity within our businesses and organizations is key for changing racist attitudes and building a society that ensures social and economic mobility for everyone. But we must first understand what constitutes racist behavior, the different forms of it, and what we can do about it.\n\nDefining What Constitutes Racist Behavior\n\nMy father, Emmett Rice, and I had hundreds of conversations about race and racism from the time I was a boy until a few weeks before he died, in 2011, at 91 years old. He was the most intellectually curious person I have ever known. He grew up in South Carolina during the Jim Crow era of the 1920s and ’30s. Despite losing his father when he was only seven, he graduated from college, served in World War II with the Tuskegee Airmen, earned a doctorate in economics, and became one of the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board in the 1980s. Racism still chased him and burdened him every day of his life. So, he armed me with the knowledge he’d amassed, in hopes I could do even more.\n\nThirty years ago, my dad gave me his playbook to put racism to rest, and it inspired me to dedicate my career to executing his vision. Dad’s playbook included one insight that all Americans should hear, at least those who hope that when it comes to addressing racism, we can do better.\n\nAs an economist, he told me that we have to “increase the cost of racist behavior.” Doing so, he said, would create the conditions for Black people to harness the economic power essential to changing the narrative in white America’s mind about race.\n\nWe can drive up that cost in several ways, starting today. The first step is to clarify what constitutes racist behavior. Defining it makes denying it or calling it something else that much harder. There are few things that Americans dislike more than being exposed as racist. To be identified as a racist is to be associated with America’s highest moral crime. Once we align on what racist behavior looks like, we can make those behaviors costly.\n\nThe Different Degrees of Racism\n\nThe most well-understood dimension involves taking actions that people of color view as overtly prejudiced—policing Black citizens much differently than whites, calling somebody the N-word to show them who is boss, or the events we’ve seen more recently. This is racism in the first degree. If officers anticipated that they would be held fully accountable for bad policing, they would do more good policing and we could begin healing the wounds they’ve inflicted on Black people for centuries.\n\nThen there is opposing or turning one’s back on anti-racism efforts, often justified by the demonization of the people courageously tackling racist behavior. I call this racism in the second degree, akin to aiding and abetting. George Floyd’s death, under yet another police officer’s knee, exposed the NFL’s four-year effort to avoid confronting racist policing by way of demonizing Colin Kaepernick. When the NFL’s sponsors could no longer stay silent and its star players (both Black and white) spoke out, the costs were so high that the commissioner felt compelled to apologize—though notably not to Kaepernick himself.\n\nThe final, most pernicious category undergirds the everyday Black experience. When employers, educational institutions, and governmental entities do not unwind practices that disadvantage people of color in the competition with whites for economic and career mobility, that is fundamentally racist—not to mention cancerous to our economy and inconsistent with the American dream.\n\nWhen these executives are challenged on hiring practices, their first excuse is always “The pipeline of qualified candidates is too small, so we can only do so much right now.” Over the past 20 years, I have not once heard an executive follow up the “pipeline is too small” defense with a quantitative analysis of that pipeline. This argument is lazy and inaccurate, and it attempts to shift the responsibility to fix an institution’s problem onto Black people and the organizations working to advance people of color. When asked why they have so few minorities in senior leadership roles, executives’ most common response is “There are challenges with performance and retention.” To reinforce their meritocracy narrative, white leaders point to the few Black people they know who have made it to the top, concluding inaccurately that they were smarter and worked harder than the rest. This dimension of racism is particularly hard to root out, because many of our most enlightened white leaders do not even realize what they are doing.\n\nThis is racism in the third degree, akin to involuntary manslaughter: We are not trying to hurt anyone, but we create the conditions that shatter somebody else’s future aspirations. Eliminating third-degree racism is the catalyst to expanding economic power for people of color, so it merits focus at the most senior levels of education, government, and business.\n\nIncreasing the Cost of Racism\n\nWe can increase the cost of this behavior by calling on major employers to sign on to basic practices that demonstrate that Black lives matter to them as we’ve done through MLT’s Black Equity at Work Certification. These basic practices include: (1) acknowledging what constitutes third-degree racism so there is no hiding behind a lack of understanding or fuzzy math, (2) committing to developing and executing diversity plans that meet a carefully considered and externally defined standard of rigor, and (3) delivering outcomes in which the people of color have the same opportunities to advance.\n\nCompanies that sign on will be recognized and celebrated. Senior management teams that decline to take these basic steps will no longer be able to hide, and they will struggle to recruit and retain top talent of all colors who will prefer firms that have signed on. The economic and reputational costs will increase enough for behavior and rhetoric to change. Then more people of color will become economically mobile, organizations will become more diverse and competitive, and there will be a critical mass of Black leaders whose institutional influence leads to more racially equitable behavior.\n\nThis is the path that will finally lift racism’s enormous burden off the backs of Black people—the burden that my dad spent his nine decades working to shed, and that he hoped to avoid passing down to me, and that I am trying not to pass down to my son as he graduates from high school and moves away. But if I am fortunate enough to someday have a grandson, and if he can grow up in a world where he can dedicate his full energy to becoming the best American he can be in a less divided America—as white people have been doing for 400 years—then my dad, so many other Black fathers, and maybe even George Floyd will be able to rest in peace."
