        "text": "Experienced Lynnwood Theft Crime Attorney\n\nTheft may be categorized into different degrees depending on the value of property involved and other factors. There are three degrees of theft (First Degree, Second Degree and Third Degree) and each is charged differently.\n\nWhat is Theft In The Third Degree?\n\nTheft in the Third Degree is defined as taking the property or services of another of a value of less than $750. Shoplifting is most commonly charged as Theft 3. Theft 3 is a Gross Misdemeanor carrying a maximum penalty of a $5000 fine and 364 days in jail.\n\nTheft in the Third Degree convictions often make it difficult to gain employment or housing; an experienced theft crimes defense lawyer may be able to help you and your future.

We care about what happens to you and will work tirelessly to ensure your rights are protected.\n\nWhat Is Theft in the Second Degree (Theft 2) in Washington?\n\nTheft in the second degree (theft 2) is a class C felony offense that may be punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nFighting Second Degree Theft Charges\n\nChallenging second degree theft charges can be difficult, but with the right approach you may be able to avoid a conviction or formal charges altogether. One of the most important pieces of advice we can give in this regard is to consult with an attorney as early in the process as possible – even if you are currently under investigation but formal charges have not yet been filed against you.\n\nAs a former prosecutor with thousands of cases handled, our lead attorney understands all of the best strategies employed by defense attorneys and prosecutors alike. This diverse knowledge helps us anticipate the prosecution’s next move. We know what we're doing and will fight tirelessly on your behalf to protect your legal rights.\n\nTheft in the first degree is the most serious categorization and may be charged as a class B felony offense in Washington. A defendant may be at risk of facing a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000 if convicted of first degree theft.\n\nThere are specific circumstances that will lead to theft in the first degree charges, as opposed to those involving theft in the second or third degree, which are less serious.\n\nImmediately involving a competent Lynnwood criminal defense attorney is one of the most important steps you can take if you have been accused of or arrested for theft in the first degree.\n\nPenalties for Theft in the First Degree in Lynnwood, WA\n\nYou may be at risk of facing:\n\nYears in state prison\n\nFines and probation\n\nAs well as a ruined career\n\nLimited employment opportunities\n\nAnd the burden of living with a criminal record long after you serve your sentence\n\nIt is important to avoid the serious criminal penalties and other consequences of a theft conviction, and you can accomplish this by involving an experienced lawyer to represent your interests.\n\nThe good news is that there are many ways to keep a Theft in the Third Degree charge off of your record, even if you have committed the offense. We may be able to negotiate a favorable offer on your behalf, especially if you have a clean record.\n\nA favorable offer may involve attending a class and staying out of trouble in return for a dismissal of the charge. Often, it is possible to work things out with the victim store or property owner by paying a civil demand and getting a release in return.\n\nWhile this release does not automatically make your charge go away, we can sometimes use the release to petition the court for something called a Compromise of Misdemeanor under RCW 10.22.020. If the Court grants our motion, your case may be dismissed without any penalty to you whatsoever.\n\nGet a Former Prosecutor On Your Side"
