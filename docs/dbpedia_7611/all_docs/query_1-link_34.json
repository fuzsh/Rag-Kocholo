        "text": "Thinking about a degree abroad? I did my Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD in the USA, Germany, and the UK. Here’s how the education systems compared.\n\nMy Education Around the World\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, I did a Bachelor’s degree in biology at a small university in Maryland (United States). Following graduation, I left for a ten month Fulbright research grant, which then turned into a two year Master’s degree in bioinformatics. Alongside my Master’s degree, I worked in a bioinformatics research group where I worked on biomedical artificial intelligence (AI). This led me to pursue a PhD in computer science, and, specifically, AI at a university in Scotland (yes, I changed fields- which you can read about here!). Frequently, people ask me how the different education systems and cultures compared: “Which did you like best?,” “Was the culture different?,” or “Is it worth paying such a large tuition for an American or British education?” Obviously, I can only speak for the individual programs at the specific universities I attended, but in each country, I befriended fellow students and also got to hear about their experiences.\n\nI give you, therefore, a summarized comparison between the three countries with respect to some of the major considerations in choosing a place to pursue higher education. Comments on other personal experiences are more than welcome!\n\n“Students should NEVER email me directly” — The Student-Professor Relationship\n\nSometimes, during my education, I was invited to private dinner parties with professors, and other times, I was reprimanded for emailing the professor. Let’s get into how the student-professor relationship differs dramatically across universities.\n\nThe United States\n\nIn the U.S., I went to a medium-sized university with nearly 9,000 students, so the classes were often small enough that I could really get to know the professors. Professors held weekly office hours, and when I would go to ask questions, they’d tend to be very welcoming and helpful. When I got to know professors quite well after multiple visits, they’d usually tend to look for more ways to help me learn- suggesting journal clubs, research conferences, and teaching opportunities to pursue. The professors seemed highly involved and personally invested in student success. This is also where professors would invite me to dinner parties or coffee to chat- the student-professor relationship was friendly and engaging, to say the least. I must admit that this friendly type of relationship might be more characteristic of medium or smaller universities in the U.S., but it was the first academic culture that I had grown accustomed to. It was a shock, then, when I went to Germany, and the culture was incredibly different.\n\nGermany\n\nOne of my first experiences with a professor in Germany was being scolded for addressing a professor as “Dr. — ” rather than “Professor — .” In Germany, there is a clear distinction between someone who has achieved a professor status and someone who has “only” gotten their Ph.D., and this distinction is important to many people. So, while I had gotten used to addressing my American professors interchangeably as “Dr. — ” or “Professor — ,” it was a huge mistake to address a professor in Germany as the former. This really set the stage for the German student-professor relationship in my mind.\n\nOften, professors seemed to be more closed off than what I had known. It was rare (but not completely unheard of) for professors to have regular, open office hours for students to come get help. Some younger professors implemented the idea, but it seemed that the traditional idea was that class-time was the main time to ask questions. One of the older professors even responded quite negatively when students would email him with questions: he would not permit students to email him directly, and any queries should always go through his assistant!\n\nIt’s important to note, though, that many younger or more progressive professors are attempting to change this academic culture in Germany by holding office hours, facilitating help sessions, or encouraging emailed questions. It’s a bit of a tricky situation, though, when you’ve got to figure out which professors you can approach and which ones you must avoid speaking to!\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe U.K. seems to lean toward the U.S. in terms of the student-professor relationship. Professors tend to foster a friendly attitude toward students- especially any research students with whom they might work. This includes grabbing coffee, stopping by the pub, or having lunch. The lecturers tend to hold regular office hours, so one-on-one help is provided and encouraged.\n\nWhile my experience as a PhD student is, in general, likely to be different than my experiences as a bachelor’s and master’s student, I chose to go to my university in Scotland because the faculty were so friendly and encouraging. Once again, I felt a sense that the professors genuinely cared about my success. For example, when I received my offer, my PhD advisor personally called me to cheer for me and congratulate me. Also, another professor with whom I talked but did not end up working with still offered me help and guidance even though she was not going to be my supervisor. I sought to return to the kind of academic culture I had grown to love in the U.S.\n\nRespecting the Hierarchy — How Easily Can You Rank Up?\n\nWith respect to the student-professor relationship, there is also the idea of an academic hierarchy. By this, I mean: professor > post-doc > PhD student > Master’s student > Bachelor’s student. Let’s review how strict this hierarchy is in each country.\n\nThe United States\n\nNot very strict at all. As I mentioned before, I could even call a professor as “Dr. — ” without an issue. In my research lab, I was mentored directly by the professor, and I was often given more responsibility than a senior or a Master’s student. A couple times, in lectures, I was asked to informally lead a class with more senior students in it. In my undergraduate university, the hierarchy denoted your level of education, but not necessarily the amount of responsibility you held or what you were capable of. When you were advanced, you could move up the ranks with responsibility (within reason, of course).\n\nGermany\n\nThe same could not be said for my time in Germany- at first, at least. In Germany, the academic hierarchy is not only taken very seriously, but the tier above you was expected to supervise you. That meant that, usually, only PhD students were mentored by professors, while master’s students were mentored by PhD students. This was very frustrating for me to go from having lots of one-on-one time with my undergraduate research professor to being expected to report directly to a PhD student during my master’s research. I also felt, at first, as though I was not challenged enough, and I yearned for one-on-one time with the professor to get more involved with research. Eventually, I worked on interacting with the professor enough that I ended up working with him directly and gained lots more responsibility! So, while the hierarchy is more rigid in Germany, a bit of persistence can bend it.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe U.K. is quite in-between the U.S. and Germany. While there is still a sense of hierarchy in the way mentorship is achieved, with PhD students mentoring other students, master’s and bachelor’s students still get plenty of one-on-one time with the professors as well. The mentorship responsibility appears to be split between the PhD students and the professor. Personally, as a PhD student, I co-mentor a Master’s student with my professor, sharing the responsibility equally. Also, responsibilities toward the research project seem to be adjusted to the master’s or bachelor’s students’ abilities- more advanced students seem to get more difficult projects. The U.K. seems to strike the perfect balance here.\n\nCampus Life — Student City\n\nOn the other side of academic culture is the student life. Each of the three countries has very different types of student communities, each with its own benefits and perks.\n\nThe United States\n\nThe American college campus is a unique setting. It’s like a “bubble” in the middle of a city or town where all university-related buildings are placed. If you live in on-campus student housing, your class might be less than five minutes by foot from where you live. You might have a meal plan, so you also eat meals nearby your classes as well. It’s the perfect layout to accommodate all of your student needs in one small area. I loved the American-style campus, personally, but it costs a lot to live and eat on-campus. Others I know hated it- they wanted to start living off-campus as soon as possible to get away from the rules and the academic environment. It definitely makes it more difficult to separate “work / Uni” and “life,” but it was extremely convenient.\n\nThere was also a strong sense of student community on American campuses. There were lots of student-run clubs and sports, and the University even held regular social events for students. There was never a moment with nothing to do. Your neighbors were almost always students, so there were always parties nearby or people to go grab milkshakes with during a late-night study session.\n\nGermany\n\nI was surprised, when I went to Germany, that there was no centralized area where all of the university-related buildings were. There were certainly little campus areas where, perhaps, three university buildings might be clustered together, but the university buildings were mostly spread around the city. Furthermore, the university housing was also spread across the city- not always the easy five-minute-walk from class. Rather than living in an academic “bubble,” the German university was intertwined with the rest of the city, mixing student-life and real-life.\n\nWhile I missed the American campus bubble, this style was much preferred by many others. There were some student-run groups, but they were less prominent. Social life came more from real-life interactions, including those you might work with, your neighbors (who may or may not be students), or perhaps your classmates. There was more of a separation between University and the rest of your life- you could really go home and forget about your courses for the evening if you’d finished all of your assignments.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nOnce again, the U.K. strikes a balance between the U.S. and Germany here. While my U.K. university is more spread out than an American campus, it is slightly more centralized into distinct campuses than my Germany university. For example, there might be an area where all of the math students have their courses and do their research, and there is another area where all of the computer scientists go. My U.K. university also provides lots of on-campus resources for students to use so that these campus areas really feel like a student hub; there is even a student bar near the library where students can go just to hangout with a coffee or a beer.\n\nStudent clubs are also equally as prominent as they were in the U.S., with frequent events and active advertising. Similarly to Germany, though, student housing is quite spread out in the city, and many students choose to live in private housing. Essentially, students have quite the “bubble” when they choose to work or study within one of the university areas, but they can also escape the university “feel” when going home.\n\nMoney, money, money — Germany wins “Most Affordable”\n\nMoney is obviously a key deciding factor in pursuing a higher education. So how do the U.S., Germany, and U.K. compare in terms of finances?\n\nThe United States\n\nWe all know that the United States is infamous for its expensive higher education. At best, tuition might be under $10,000 per year, and at worst, it can be more than $50 or 60 thousand per year. If the university is funded with public funds, the tuition is typically even more expensive for students who live outside of the state where the university is. It often doesn’t stop there, though. Many universities require you to live on-campus for the first year or two, and on-campus housing tends to be significantly more expensive than off-campus housing. Lastly, there are the fees added to your bill which might accumulate to an extra few hundred. With everything included, my undergraduate bill tended to be more than $25,000 per year.\n\nGermany\n\nGerman higher education is nearly free- even for international students. Yep, you read that right! Typically, students pay approximately €300 / semester, and this often contributes toward a regional train ticket and other services within the area. This was the case for my university in North Rhine-Westphalia. Additionally, when I studied in Germany, I found that there were a decent number of paid student research assistant positions available, making it possible for students to earn enough money to cover the semesterly fees and possibly even their rents.\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nU.K. universities are slightly more affordable than U.S. universities, especially for British students. It seems that “home” students might be required to pay up to £10,000 per year. For international students, however, the price can be quite comparable to U.S. tuition and fees. My annual tuition in the U.K. (luckily, covered by my position) is almost £25,000, making it quite similar to my undergraduate (American) tuition and fees. If you’re an American looking to study in the U.K., the financial aspect might not be any better than a domestic program.\n\nThe Verdict?\n\nSo where should you do your degree? Well, if you’re looking for a quality education for a bargain, Germany is a smart choice. If finances are not a problem for you, you’re all about Uni life, and want to live in a nice, academic bubble, then try an American university. If you want something in between, the U.K. might be your best bet.\n\nThe good news is that all three systems have high quality classes, so if it’s the quality of the lessons you’re looking for, all three are a safe bet.\n\nI’d love to hear about the higher education systems in other countries or different experiences in these systems.
