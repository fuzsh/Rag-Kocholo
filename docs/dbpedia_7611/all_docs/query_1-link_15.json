        "text": "A person can be charged with corrupting the government in the third degree if they intentionally offer or give any benefit to a public servant with the intent to influence their performance of an official duty. The benefit offered or given must be of a substantial nature and must not be authorized by law. For example, if a person offers a bribe to a police officer in exchange for not receiving a traffic citation, they may be charged with corrupting the government in the third degree.\n\nAdditionally, a person can be charged with corrupting the government in the third degree if they, as a public servant, accept any benefit with the intent to be influenced in the performance of their official duties. The benefit received must be of a substantial nature and must not be authorized by law. For example, if a public official accepts a bribe to award a government contract to a specific company, they may be charged with corrupting the government in the third degree.\n\nExample\n\nPeople v. Soto, 138 A.D.3d 1248 (3d Dept. 2016). In this case, the defendant was charged with corrupting the government in the third degree for his involvement in a bribery scheme related to the award of contracts by a New York State agency. According to the indictment, the defendant had accepted bribes from a contractor in exchange for using his influence to secure the award of contracts for the contractor. The defendant allegedly submitted false and inflated bids on behalf of the contractor and used his position within the agency to ensure that the contractor was awarded the contracts.\n\nAt trial, the prosecution presented evidence of the defendant's involvement in the bribery scheme, including recorded conversations between the defendant and the contractor, as well as testimony from other witnesses who had knowledge of the scheme. The defendant argued that he had not intended to defraud the government or commit any illegal acts, and that he had simply been trying to help the contractor secure the contracts. However, the court rejected this argument, finding that the evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient to support a finding of guilt under New York Penal Law § 496.03. The court ultimately convicted the defendant of corrupting the government in the third degree, a Class D felony under New York law.\n\nThis case highlights the serious nature of bribery schemes and the potential consequences for those who engage in such conduct. It also underscores the importance of seeking legal representation if you are facing charges under New York Penal Law § 496.03, as a skilled attorney can work to build a strong defense strategy and advocate on your behalf in court.\n\nRelated Offenses\n\nCorrupting the government in the fourth degree.
