        "text": "What Physical Therapists Do\n\nPhysical therapists examine, diagnose, and treat individuals of all ages, from newborns to people at the end of life. Physical therapists work with patients who have injuries, disabilities, or other health conditions that need treatment. They help patients avoid surgery and prescription drugs, maximize mobility, manage pain and chronic conditions, prevent future problems, and improve physical function and fitness.\n\nPhysical therapists examine each patient, develop a treatment plan to improve movement, reduce or manage pain, restore function, and prevent disability. Physical therapists will work with patients to implement the treatment plan or ask a physical therapist assistant to carry out the treatment plan. Physical therapists will monitor and adjust the treatment plan throughout the patient’s treatment. When appropriate the physical therapist will discharge the patient or move the patient to the next phase of the treatment plan.\n\nPhysical therapists can have a profound effect on people’s lives. They help people achieve fitness goals, regain or maintain their independence, and lead active lives. Movement is a key factor of life and physical therapist help to keep people moving.\n\nVisit ChoosePT.com, APTA's official consumer information website, to learn more about the benefits of physical therapy.\n\nWhere Physical Therapists Work\n\nPhysical therapists practice in a wide range of settings, including but not limited to hospitals, outpatient clinics, people's homes, schools, sports and fitness facilities, workplaces, and nursing homes.\n\nHow Much Physical Therapists Earn\n\nThe median salary for a physical therapist is $97,720. Salaries vary based on position, years of experience, degree of education, geographic location, and practice setting.\n\nDemand for physical therapists varies by geographical region and area of practice, but PT unemployment rates are typically low across the country. The need for physical therapists is expected to remain strong as the United States population ages and the demand for physical therapist services grows.\n\nPhysical Therapist Education and Licensure\n\nTo practice as a physical therapist in the U.S., you must earn a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from a Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education-accredited physical therapist education program and pass a state licensure exam.\n\nThe length of professional DPT programs is typically three years. Primary content areas in the curriculum may include, but are not limited to, biology, anatomy, cellular histology, physiology, exercise physiology, biomechanics, kinesiology, neuroscience, pharmacology, pathology, behavioral sciences, communication, ethics/values, management sciences, finance, sociology, clinical reasoning, evidence-based practice, cardiovascular and pulmonary, endocrine and metabolic, and musculoskeletal.\n\nApproximately 77% of the DPT curriculum is classroom (didactic) and lab study and the remaining 23% is dedicated to clinical education. Physical therapy students spend on average 22 weeks in their final clinical experience.\n\nIf you are an internationally educated PT or PTA, please read more information on internationally educated PTs and PTAs.\n\nGetting Into a DPT Program\n\nMost DPT programs require applicants to earn a bachelor's degree prior to admission. Other programs offer a 3+3 curricular format in which three years of specific preprofessional (undergraduate/pre-PT) courses must be taken before the student can advance into a three-year professional DPT program.\n\nA few programs offer freshman entry, recruiting students directly from high school into a guaranteed admissions program. High school students accepted into these programs can automatically advance into the professional phase of the DPT program, pending the completion of specific undergraduate courses and any other stated contingencies, e.g., minimum GPA.\n\nThe PTCAS Directory provides a list of DPT programs participating in the Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service and includes requirements for each program.\n\nFind a DPT Program\n\nChoosing the Right Program\n\nAPTA does not rank DPT education programs. Programs are accredited by CAPTE, which assures quality in physical therapist education. Among the factors you should keep in mind when choosing your program:\n\nCost and financial aid opportunities. Most DPT students graduate with student loans. Make sure that you are financially aware and prepared. Programs offer distinctive student experiences and have different costs. APTA does offer scholarships and awards to eligible DPT students, as well as the APTA Money Smart website to prospective students to learn more and prepare financially for the future.\n\nProgram length. The traditional DPT program is two and a half years on average, but some programs compress academic requirements into a shorter time span, which could help you manage the total cost of your education experience and enter the field faster.\n\nDemographics and setting. Pursing DPT education will be an investment of your time and resources. Make sure that you select a program where you feel at home.\n\nYou may wish to contact current students and recent graduates of the program, or interview employers who hire new graduates, to ask about a program's strengths and weaknesses. Visit the PTCAS Program Directory to find the direct contact information for DPT programs.\n\nAdmissions\n\nThe Physical Therapist Centralized Application Service allows applicants to use a single web-based application and one set of materials to apply to multiple DPT programs.\n\nLearn About the Admissions Process\n\nAfter Graduation\n\nLicensed physical therapists may choose to pursue a residency or fellowship program to enhance their knowledge and practice.\n\nA clinical residency is designed to advance a physical therapist's preparation as a provider of patient care services in a defined area of clinical practice. It combines opportunities for ongoing clinical supervision and mentoring with a theoretical basis for advanced practice and scientific inquiry.\n\nA clinical fellowship is a planned program of postprofessional clinical and didactic education for a physical therapist who demonstrates clinical expertise in an area of clinical practice related to the practice focus of the fellowship. (Fellows are frequently postresidency prepared or board-certified clinical specialists.)\n\nPhysical therapists also have the opportunity to become board-certified clinical specialists through the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties. Specialization is the process by which a physical therapist builds on a broad base of professional education and practice to develop a greater depth of knowledge and skills related to a particular area of practice. PTs are not required to be certified in order to practice in a specific area.\n\nThere are currently 10 specialty areas of physical therapy: cardiovascular and pulmonary, clinical electrophysiology, geriatrics, neurology, oncology, orthopaedics, pediatrics, sports, women’s health, and wound management."
