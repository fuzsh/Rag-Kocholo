The laws that determine this time frame are called criminal statutes of limitations—and they vary by state and situation. RAINN’s statutes of limitations tool provides a visual representation of where states fall on key aspects of these laws. What follows is a more in-depth look at how and why these states have been categorized in the tool.",
