        "text": "In the state of Minnesota, criminal sexual conduct offenses are classified by five levels, depending on the severity. Offenses range from first-degree offenses, which are felonies, down to fifth-degree offenses, which are gross misdemeanors.\n\nSexual conduct offenses are classified by circumstance, available evidence, or any prior criminal sexual offenses the offender might have.\n\nWhat Is Criminal Sexual Conduct in the Third Degree in Minnesota?\n\nUnder Minnesota law, sexual penetration is a third-degree sexual conduct crime under the following circumstances:\n\nThe victim is under 13 years old, and the offender is no more than three years older;\n\nThe victim is at least 13 years old, but less than 16 years old and the offender is no more than two years older;\n\nThe victim is at least 16 years old, but less than 18, and the offender is more than four years older and in a position of authority;\n\nThe victim is at least 16 years old, but less than 18, and the offender has a significant relationship with the individual;\n\nThe victim is a patient of a psychotherapist, and there is an active patient-therapist relationship;\n\nThe offender is a member of the clergy, the victim isn’t married to him or her, and the victim was seeking the offender’s advice or counseling;\n\nThe offender is an employee or volunteer at a juvenile correctional facility, and the complainant is in custody there; or\n\nThe actor knows or has reason to know that the complainant is mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless.\n\nWhile these are the most common circumstances, situations are assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhen Alcohol is Involved\n\nThird-degree criminal sexual conduct is often seen in situations where alcohol is involved, and an individual complains of sexual misconduct while intoxicated and unable to give consent. When alcohol plays a part and people participate in sex while inebriated, it is challenging to accurately reconstruct the incident.\n\nPunishments for Third-Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct in Minnesota\n\nThe penalty for criminal sexual conduct in the third degree in Minnesota includes up to 15 years in prison and/or fines up to $30,000. Registration as a sexual offender is also required.\n\nRemedies for Third-Degree Criminal Sexual Conduct in Minnesota\n\nWhen charged with criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, your criminal defense attorney may raise several possible defenses. A successful defense may reduce the penalty or, in some cases, help achieve a not-guilty verdict.\n\nMistake of age is a defense only when the complainant is at least 13 years of age but less than 16. In this situation, the burden is placed on the actor to prove that they reasonably believed that the victim was at least 16 years old. Outside of this, mistaken age is not typically used as a defense.\n\nConsent may be raised as a defense in some instances. Under Minnesota law, there are various limitations on the use of consent. Even if the complainant can prove consent, it may be limited in:\n\nCases where the victim is below the age of consent;\n\nEncounters where the offender holds a position of authority over the victim;\n\nSituations where there is a significant relationship between the offender and victim, including parents, step-parents, guardians, or any relation by blood; or\n\nSituations where special trust exists, like patient-therapist relationships.\n\nYour criminal defense attorney can assess your particular situation and help you decide what defense to raise.\n\nHiring a Criminal Defense Attorney\n\nCriminal sexual conduct in the third degree is a serious offense. A trustworthy and reliable attorney is an invaluable ally in this fight.\n\nOur team at Arechigo & Stokka has gained extensive criminal defense skills through decades of experience and hundreds of cases.
