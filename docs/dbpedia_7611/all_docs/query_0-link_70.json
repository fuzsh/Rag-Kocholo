        "text": "In Miami, crimes can be classified in a number of ways. Most commonly, they will be described as either felonies or misdemeanors. As you might already know, a felony is the more serious crime when compared with a misdemeanor.\n\nWithin the felony category, there are several different levels of felonies. For example, there are first degree, second degree, and third degree felonies. When you speak with felony attorney in Miami, it is important that you learn which of these charges you are facing and the full extent of what that means. This way, you can discuss the best way to fight your case and you can begin to build a good defense for yourself.\n\nThird degree felonies are the least severe of all of the felonies, however, they still carry the risk of significant prison time, fines and other penalties.\n\nWhat Classifies as a Third Degree Felony?\n\nThird degree felonies can include but are not limited to:\n\nAggravated stalking\n\nBattery of a person 65 years of age or above\n\nBattery of an officer\n\nBattery with strangulation\n\nBribery\n\nBurglary of a conveyance\n\nBurglary of a structure\n\nChild abuse or child neglect\n\nCultivation, purchase or sale of marijuana\n\nDriving with a suspended license\n\nExploitation of an elderly person\n\nEmployee theft\n\nFleeing and eluding an officer\n\nFelony battery\n\nForgery\n\nGrand theft\n\nIntroducing contraband into jail\n\nPossession of burglary tools\n\nPossession of marijuana over 20 grams\n\nPossession of marijuana with the intent to sell\n\nPossession of a controlled substance\n\nResisting arrest with violence\n\nUnemployment compensation fraud\n\nAll these different crimes may be considered third degree felonies and may incur: up to $5,000 in fines and up to five years in prison.\n\nAny of these punishments is potentially life-changing, which makes it highly important that you be sure to protect yourself in court and get the aid of a criminal law attorney in Miami.\n\nThe Role of Your Criminal Defense Attorney\n\nMiami criminal lawyers have many roles in these situations.\n\nTheir first role will be explain the severity of your charges and the strength of the case against you. From here, they will then help you build a defense for your case, which can be aimed at having you acquitted or they might work towards having your charge reduced from a third degree felony to a misdemeanor.\n\nThere are many reasons this may be possible. For instance, possession of burglary tools is certainly a description that is open to interpretation. It is very possible that a Miami criminal law firm could help to convince the jury that those items were possessed for different reasons. There are many similar examples of cases where a charge can be challenged and this is precisely what your Miami criminal attorney can help you accomplish."
