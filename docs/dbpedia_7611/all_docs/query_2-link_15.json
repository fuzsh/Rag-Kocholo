Based in West Chester (Chester County) in the Philadelphia Metro Area, the Ciccarelli Legal Team defends the rights of murder and homicide defendants throughout Pennsylvania.\n\nInformation on a Chester County Third Degree Murder Charge\n\nThe definition of murder in the third degree in the state of Pennsylvania is the killing of another human being which does not meet the requirements of first-degree or second-degree murder.\n\nThere are currently only three states in the United States which have a category of murder known as third-degree murder. These states are Florida, Minnesota and Pennsylvania.\n\nMalice aforethought—premeditation with malice—is not a required mental state in murder in the third degree charges, however “malice” in and of itself is still a requirement. The standard of “malice” required for a conviction of murder in the third degree is the same as that required for a conviction of aggravated assault. This means it must be more than negligence or recklessness and must disregard the threat posed to human life by the conduct exhibited. Charges of murder in the third degree in the state of Pennsylvania are extremely serious, as a conviction can result in up to forty years in prison. Third-degree murder statutes were introduced in the state of Pennsylvania in a 1974 amendment, at the same time second-degree murder was redefined as felony murder.\n\nIn some instances, a defense of diminished capacity can reduce first-degree murder charges to third-degree murder charges. In short, if you are being charged with murder in the third-degree, you took the life of another person in a way that was not necessarily intentional and was not perpetrated while you committed a felony offense. As an example, if you knowingly give or sell someone a controlled substance that you know to be dangerous in some way, and the person dies as a result of using that drug, you could potentially be charged with third-degree murder.\n\nConspiracy to Commit Third-Degree Murder\n\nSeveral years ago, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court dealt with a particularly puzzling issue, which was whether a person can be found guilty of conspiracy to commit-third-degree murder. On its face, a person could not intend to commit an unintentional killing. After carefully considering the language of the statutes of Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court found that such a charge is actually possible. While one appeal argued that since conspiracy is a specific intent crime and third-degree murder does not include specific intent, there could be no conspiracy to commit third-degree murder.\n\nThe court read the statute a little more broadly, stating that since the statute is silent regarding required mental state, the requisite mental state must then be intentional, knowing or reckless. Taking a step from this conclusion, conspiracy to commit third-degree murder is possible, since you can intend to kill another human being in a reckless manner. In other words, since third-degree murder is one which is committed intentionally, knowingly or recklessly, conspiracy to commit third-degree murder is not as “paradoxical” as it may sound.\n\nDefenses to Charges of Third-Degree Murder\n\nLike first and second-degree murder charges, there may be specific defenses your attorney can employ on your behalf for your third-degree murder charges. Perhaps you are actually innocent of the crime. You may have a solid alibi which will show you could not have committed the third-degree murder or if you were identified as the murderer by a witness, that witness may have misidentified you. Or, perhaps you are not asserting that you did not commit the crime, rather are saying you had some type of justification. You may have acted in self-defense if you committed the act of murder to protect your own life or the life of another. If so, your charges may be reduced to a lesser charge, or dropped altogether.\n\nYour attorney will determine the best defense on your behalf, based on the facts and circumstances of your case, however it is extremely important that you speak to a knowledgeable Pennsylvania criminal defense attorney as soon as possible after you have been charged with third-degree murder. The sooner your attorney is on your case, the more likely you are to have the most positive outcome possible to your third-degree murder charges. Your attorney will consider the evidence the prosecution has, determining the best way to have that evidence discredited or thrown out entirely. Once all discovery items have been carefully considered, a defense will be crafted which is the most likely to present you in a positive light to the jurors and allowing you to escape a sentence of up to forty years in prison.\n\nGet The “Right Defense” When facing Pennsylvania Third Degree Murder Charges\n\nWhen you or a loved one is facing third degree murder allegations or charges, gain the benefit and experience of the Ciccarelli Legal Team.
