        "text": "This page explains what a hate crime is in simple terms, defines the terms \"hate\" and \"crime,\" and provides answers to the frequently asked questions: \"Why have hate crime laws?\" and \"Why report hate crimes?\" In addition, you can find definitions for hate crime and bias/hate incident, as well as view example scenarios for of all the bias categories.\n\nWhat is a hate crime?\n\n​\n\n​A crime + Motivation for committing the crime based on bias = Hate crime\n\nIn the simplest terms, a hate crime must include both “hate” and a \"crime.\"\n\nHate\n\nThe term \"hate\" can be misleading. When used in a hate crime law, the word \"hate\" does not mean rage, anger, or general dislike. In this context “hate” means bias against people or groups with specific characteristics that are defined by the law.\n\nAt the federal level, hate crime laws include crimes committed on the basis of the victim’s perceived or actual race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.\n\nMost state hate crime laws include crimes committed on the basis of race, color, and religion; many also include crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and disability.\n\nCrime\n\nThe \"crime\" in hate crime is often a violent crime, such as assault, murder, arson, vandalism, or threats to commit such crimes. It may also cover conspiring or asking another person to commit such crimes, even if the crime was never carried out.\n\nWhy have hate crime laws?\n\nHate crimes have a broader effect than most other kinds of crime. Hate crime victims include not only the crime’s immediate target but also others like them. Hate crimes affect families, communities, and at times, the entire nation.\n\nWhy report hate crimes?\n\nThe Hate Crimes Reporting Gap is the significant disparity between hate crimes that actually occur and those reported to law enforcement. It is critical to report hate crimes not only to show support and get help for victims, but also to send a clear message that the community will not tolerate these kinds of crimes. Reporting hate crimes allows communities and law enforcement to fully understand the scope of the problem in a community and put resources toward preventing and addressing attacks based on bias and hate.\n\nExperts estimate an average of 250,000 hate crimes were committed each year between 2004 and 2015 in the United States. The majority of these were not reported to law enforcement.\n\nTerminology\n\nHate Crime: At the federal level, a crime motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.\n\nBias or Hate Incident: Acts of prejudice that are not crimes and do not involve violence, threats, or property damage.\n\nExamples of Bias Categories"
