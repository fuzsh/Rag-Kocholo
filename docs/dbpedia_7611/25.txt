The Third Degree is a rock band formed out of a shared passion for the stage, rock, and the rhythm and blues. The band formed while in high school and has since grown up together on stage performing across the mitten state. The Third Degree has opened the Petoskey Fourth of July fireworks, closed/headlined the Michigan Stage at the 40th annual Blissfest Music Festival and has even rocked to hell and back (Hell, MI). They are young but their stage presence and energy is unmatched with originals and sets spanning the decades with everything from Janis Joplin to Greta Van Fleet.
