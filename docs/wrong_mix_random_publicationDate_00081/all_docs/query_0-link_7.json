        "text": "Ben Lomond is located on Highway 9 in the San Lorenzo Valley area of the Santa Cruz Mountains, where the San Lorenzo River and Love Creek meet.\n\nHistory\n\nBen Lomond was originally called Pacific Mills from 1877 to 1887. It was named for the lumber company started by James P. Pierce. When Pierce applied to the Federal Government for a Post Office, the federal government was concerned about the name being alike to so many other towns. It was decided to re-name the town for the mountain it is on, Ben Lomond.\n\nBen is Celtic for Mountain. (Lomond is Celtic for beacon.) The mountain Ben Lomond in Santa Cruz County is named for the mountain in Scotland, northwest of Glasgow. To distinguish the town \"Ben Lomond\" from the mountain \"Ben Lomond\" The USGS maps and other maps have often used \"Ben Lomond Mountain\" for the mountain and \"Ben Lomond\" for the town.\n\nIn 1917 the movie A Romance of the Redwoods with Mary Pickford was filmed in Ben Lomond.\n\nCommunity\n\nBen Lomond is just less than 1 square mile in area and has 873 homes (according to the 2000 census). Ben Lomond is located in the 11th California Senate District, and in the 27th California Assembly District. Federally, Ben Lomond is located in the 14th congressional district of California.\n\nCommunity Organizations\n\nBen Lomond Business Association\n\nBen Lomond Community Library\n\nMountain Community Theater\n\nPark Hall\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley Chamber of Commerce\n\nSanta Cruz Mountains Art Center - Thomas Gallery\n\nSenior Center Of San Lorenzo Valley\n\nValley Churches United\n\nVolunteer Centers of Santa Cruz County\n\nSpiritual Organizations\n\nBen Lomond Quaker Center\n\nSaint Andrews Episcopal Church\n\nSaints Peter & Paul Antiochian Orthodox Church\n\nGeography\n\nBen Lomond Mountain\n\nSan Lorenzo Valley\n\nRivers & Creeks\n\nLove Creek\n\nSan Lorenzo River\n\nBusinesses\n\nGeneral\n\nAndersen Jewelry Design\n\nBay Federal Credit Union\n\nBen Lomond Liquors\n\nBen Lomond Market\n\nBen Lomond Mini Market & Liquor\n\nBucci, Inc.\n\nPlant Works\n\nRooted Hydroponics & Organics\n\nSanta Cruz Mountains Art Center - Thomas Gallery\n\nScarborough Lumber\n\nFood & Drink\n\nAll American Hotdogs\n\nCasa Nostra\n\nCoffee Nine\n\nHenflings\n\nSpanky's\n\nTyrolean Inn\n\nHotels & Lodging\n\nFairview Manor\n\nHowden Castle\n\nJaye's Timberlane Resort\n\nQuality Inn & Suites Santa Cruz Mountains\n\nDeparted Businesses\n\nCiao Bella\n\nCiao Bella Act II\n\nParks\n\nBen Lomond County Park\n\nHighlands County Park\n\nStreets\n\nHighway 9\n\nMain Street\n\nRiverside Avenue\n\nRelated Links"
