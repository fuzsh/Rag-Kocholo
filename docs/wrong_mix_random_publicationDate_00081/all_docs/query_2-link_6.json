He is credited with inventing the cable car in 1873 and fathering the San Francisco cable car system. Both claims are disputed.\n\nOverland Journeys in 1908\n\nMr. and Mrs Jacob Murdock left Los Angeles driving their Packard on the first cross-country car trip.

It was formed from Trinity County and covers the northwestern part of the state. The Klamath and Salmon River Indian War (1855) and the Bald Hills War (1858-1864) kept the area unsettled and the county dissolved in 1874.\n\nGovernment in 1851\n\nNevada County was formed.
