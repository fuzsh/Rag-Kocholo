        "text": "Remember, Acknowledge, and Learn: Engaging with the Watsonville-Santa Cruz Japanese American Citizens League Collection\n\nCurated by Meleia Simon-Reynolds, 2023-2024 Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training (CART)\n\nOn view June - December 2024\n\nLOCATION: 3rd floor hallway, McHenry Library\n\nRemember, Acknowledge, and Learn showcases materials in the Watsonville-Santa Cruz Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) records that document early Japanese immigration to the Pajaro Valley, forced removal and incarceration during World War II, and postwar revitalization of the Japanese American community. The exhibit highlights the vital and ongoing memory work conducted by JACL members in Santa Cruz County and the Pajaro Valle.\n\nCelebration and Self-Representation: Asian American and Pacific Islander Student Life at UC Santa Cruz\n\nCurated by UCSC undergraduates Benyamin Alfaro, Alana Corona, Samantha Elfiqhi, Sophia Gallaga-Rabinowitz, and Prema Reyes.\n\nLOCATION: 3rd floor hallway, McHenry Library\n\nThe exhibition highlights archival materials from the Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center Records, the UCSC Poster Collection, and a number of student publications, and it's organized around the themes of cultural celebration, collective action, and education and resources. There's also an interactive space where student visitors can reflect and respond to discussion prompts about their own experiences.\n\nPower Through Organization\n\nCurated by UCSC undergraduates Benyamin Alfaro (lead), Abiagael McNelis, Diego Macedonio Andres, Prema Reyes, Samantha Elfiqhi, and Alana Corona.\n\nLOCATION: Californiana Room, McHenry Library\n\nStudent organizing is a part of the fabric of college campuses, and through awareness campaigns, protests, and embodying shared ideals, these movements resonate with profound solidarity for strongly held beliefs and local and global issues. This exhibit–conceived and organized by current UCSC students–highlights campus organizing efforts in order to preserve and promote the voices of student activists. In order of display, the exhibit focuses on student response to the Persian Gulf War, the Vietnam War, the Cambodian campaign, apartheid in South Africa, the Delano grape strike, women’s rights, the naming of College 7, and affirmative action.\n\nThis exhibit also serves as a tribute to student voices that refuse to be silenced by the passage of time. It's a reminder of the power of collective action and the impact it has in shaping our society.\n\nJoin us as we honor the legacies of those who dared to challenge the status quo, and whose voices echo through our campus and beyond. This is not just a collection of events; it's a celebration of the resilience and resolve of student activism.\n\nThe Thread that Runs so True: Archival Connections of the Grateful Dead\n\nLOCATION: Dead Central, on the main level of McHenry Library\n\nSince their start in the 1960s, the American band known as the Grateful Dead showed immense capacity for creating a sense of radical welcome, connecting with fans, fellow musicians, and many others who shared their interest in the creative possibilities of experimentation and improvisation. The Thread that Runs so True draws on a variety of archival collections at UC Santa Cruz to explore the many threads running between the Grateful Dead and other artists, thinkers, and supporters who also have left behind archival traces within the archives held at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nAt UC Santa Cruz's University Library, the band’s papers keep company with musical scores of avant garde composers, recorded interviews of jazz and rock innovators, photographs and papers of Black Panther Party members, scholarly studies on sound, and even the writings of a certain gonzo journalist. A look into some of these other archives reveals the threads that run between the Grateful Dead and a diversity of artists, authors, journalists, and activists whose archives also have their homes at UC Santa Cruz today.\n\nSelected Previous Exhibits at McHenry Library\n\nIngeborg Gerdes in Process: The Making of an Artist\n\nCurated by CART Fellow Yulia Gilich (Film & Digital Media)\n\nJune 15 - December 8, 2023\n\nLOCATION: Third Floor Gallery, McHenry Library\n\nThis exhibition features materials from the newly acquired collection of Ingeborg Gerdes Photographs and Papers.

This exhibit is based on Ligmond's digital research project of the same name. See it here.\n\nWhen We Paint Our Masterpiece: The Art of the Grateful Dead Community\n\n3 February 2020 - 22 December 2022\n\nThe creative works presented in When We Paint Our Masterpiece, drawn from the Grateful Dead Archive, reveal a richly envisioned and varied world of design practices, international traditions, visual icons, and art forms. Sent to the band from around the world, these works document the blossoming of a transnational community of Dead Heads even in countries where the band never toured, like Japan.\n\nThis artwork also reveals the deep affection that the band and its staff—who curated the collection piece by piece—had for Dead Heads’ unique and broadly conceived notions of what Grateful Dead-related art could and should be. Pencil sketches, abstract works, portraits, and screenprints share space with sculptures in paper and metal. Repurposed found objects as well as comic art and drawings inspired by the English Arts & Crafts movement a century ago all have a place here. The Grateful Dead’s universe made space for all of these patterns and images. These works, considered collectively, offer a powerful example of the possibilities of fan culture. Dead Head artists like Miki Saito and others continue to make new art, and as stewards of the Grateful Dead Archive, we “hang it up and see what tomorrow brings,” as Robert Hunter counseled so long ago. (image: card sent to the Grateful Dead from Dead Heads Japan, with art by Miki Saito)\n\nResist / Record / Repair: New Works in Special Collections & Archives\n\nThis exhibit, featuring artists’ books, games, zines, and other art works we acquired during one and a half years of pandemic isolation, explored how creative work can act as a means of help and an aid to memory as we all continue the work of creating new futures together.

(15 August 2018 - 24 February 2019)\n\n\"See you when I see you...\": Black Student Life at UCSC 1965-present\n\nCART Fellow Jazmin Benton (Visual Studies) created this exhibition showcasing the many experiences of Black students at UC Santa Cruz from its establishment in 1965 through the present day. Benton spent dozens of hours leafing through archival collections including the J. Herman Blake papers, Merrill College records, and unprocessed university archives and ephemera, finding flyers, reports, photographs, and firsthand accounts of how Black students have experienced the campus and how the campus has responded (or not responded) to their needs.\n\nIn Benton's own words:\n\nAs this exhibition shows, official reports and initiatives from UCSC crop up repeatedly. Recruitment and retention efforts cycle through, failing to address the daily realities of Black life on UCSC’s campus. Black students throughout the years have faced similar barriers since the first handful of us were admitted. The narratives and documents listed here will show how students were subjected to conditions such as being the only Black student in their classes, not having the resources available to center their work around Blackness, and no recourse available when faced with racist behavior.\n\nMore than their Labor: Sites of Manong Labor and Leisure in the Pajaro Valley\n\nCART Fellow Christina Ayson Plank (Visual Studies) is part of the project team for Watsonville is in the Heart, a public history initiative led by Dioscoro Recio, Jr. from The Tobera Project and UCSC faculty and students, including professors Kathleen Cruz Gutierrez and Steve McKay. Christina's exhibit highlights audio recordings and photographs documenting the plight, struggles, vitality, and resilience of the manong generation of Filipino migrants who first settled in the Pajaro Valley in the early twentieth century. More than their Labor offers a glimpse into the full lives of these families and identifies geographical spots they often frequented around the Pajaro Valley.\n\nViva los Libros: Latinx Artist Books in UCSC Special Collections\n\nKatie Ligmond (Visual Studies) created this digital exhibit to showcase, analyze, and compare a selection of artists' books within UCSC's Special Collections & Archives that are created by Latinx artists, authors, publishers, and communities.\n\nThe five books featured are The Book of Sand/El Libro de Arena, Everything I Kept/Todo lo que Guardé, Codex Espangliensis: from Columbus to the Border Patrol, Incantations by Mayan Women, and El Alfabeto Animado/The Lively Alphabet/Uywakunawan Qelqasqa.\n\nseeds and whispers: a glimpse into the Karen Tei Yamashita Papers\n\nAnny L. Mogollón (Literature PhD student and Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training) utilized the papers of Karen Tei Yamashita (MS 465) to create an exhibit exploring \"the question of how...how did the author write this? And perhaps too, how long did these stories haunt them before they were set down on paper.\" Yamashita is an author, playwright, and UCSC professor known for her works of Asian American literature and magic realism, including I Hotel (2010) and Tropic of Orange (1997), both of which Mogollón explores in this exhibit through early drafts, photographs, and research materials from Yamashita's papers.\n\nAnother Renga\n\nEric Sneathen (Literature PhD student and Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training) wrote this essay reflecting on his time using archival materials, and the distance felt during the COVID-19 pandemic. He used Out in the Redwoods, a collection of oral histories documenting the LGBTQ experience at UC Santa Cruz from 1965-2003, as a starting point in his reflections. Sneathen also wrote a poem during his fellowship, which will be printed and bound, and available in the Special Collections reading room.\n\n\"If I had to live my life over again, I would be a botanist\": John Cage's Mycology Collection\n\nJoseph Finkel (Musicology PhD student and Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training) tells the story of John Cage's interest in mushrooms and its connections with his career as a composer and artist. Finkel also recounts the history of how the John Cage Mycology collection (MS 74) at UC Santa Cruz came to be part of Special Collections & Archives. He used archival materials and books from this collection, among other sources, to complete this multimedia project\n\nEchoes of Seema\n\nCurated by Brock Stuessi (musicology graduate student and Fellow in the Center for Archival Research and Training), Echoes of Seema is a creative rearrangement of the Sara Halprin interviews of Seema Weatherwax collection. The multi-media exhibit includes original musical compositions by Brock Stuessi which he collaged with selections of audio recordings of interviews with Seema. These audio compositions are arranged alongside examples of Seema's own photographic work, as well as photos taken of Seema and her friends and family.\n\nIf Only All Barriers Could Be Removed...\n\nMichael Conlee, a senior majoring in Sociology and Art History at UCSC, has completed his HAVC service-learning practicum with the Library's Special Collections & Archives.\n\nFor his practicum, he chose to create a digital scholarship project on the theme of prison abolition and Bay Area histories of related activism. He worked with Bettina Aptheker's archive, photography by Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones, and other visual collections from Special Collections & Archives.\n\nSeeds of Something Different\n\nCreated as a companion for Seeds of Something Different: An Oral History of the University of California, Santa Cruz, edited and published by the UCSC Library's Regional History Project, this exhibit features an array of photographs, oral history clips, posters, and other archival objects that reveal the richness of UCSC's archival collections.

The team of students gained valuable and versatile professional skills and personalized knowledge in the areas of interviewing, project design and execution, communication, recording, team-building and collaboration, storytelling, and oral history research. The project was funded by a Radical Resilience small grant from the Division of Student Affairs and Success and funding from The Humanities Institute and the University Library.\n\nWhile the pandemic can be mapped and tracked and tallied with numbers, for it to be understood and felt for many, if not most people, we need stories. The Empty Year calls for the deep listening of another to bind and cohere into something more whole, something more sustainable and resilient. The book is an impressionistic illustration of an unstable present and documents that present as part of the historical record, for an unknown future. The 540-page book is published in both hardbound and electronic format and illustrated with full-color images by Shmuel Thaler and several other local photographers.\n\nYou may read and download The Empty Year for free via UCSC E-Scholarship. Copies of the hardback book will be available in the University Library and are also available for purchase from Lulu.com. For more information contact Irene Reti, Director of the Regional History Project at ihreti@ucsc.edu.\n\nJoin Us on Jan. 28th for a Conversation with Book Artist Felicia Rice\n\nJoin Special Collections & Archives, in partnership with the Institute of the Arts & Sciences, for an evening with internationally renowned book artist Felicia Rice.

At this event some of Rice’s closest collaborators, including UCSC Arts Faculty, T.J. Demos and Jennifer González, will join Rice in conversation about her work, the process of collaboration, and the power of artists’ books to fuel our collective imaginations as we work to cultivate futures of social justice.\n\nLearn more and register for this Jan. 28th event here!\n\nAudio Archive of Cabrillo Music Festival Recordings Now Available\n\n23 October 2020\n\nUCSC Library is is pleased to announce the completion of an exciting music preservation project, Digitizing the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music: Putting Experimental Music in Conversation with Classical Tradition.\n\nFounded in 1963, the Cabrillo Festival is distinctive in its focus on contemporary symphonic music by living composers. This project preserves and makes available significant works by experimental artists such as Annea Lockwood, John Cage, Lou Harrison, and many others. Recordings were drawn from two collections held by UCSC Special Collections: the Cabrillo Festival records and the Other Minds records.\n\nThe recordings are now discoverable on the UC Santa Cruz University Library Digital Collections site. Learn more at the UCSC News Center.\n\nOver 10,000 photos documenting over a century of Santa Cruz history now published online\n\n6 October 2020\n\nTaken between 1866 and 1995 and collected by local journalist, photographer, and documentarian Preston Sawyer, the collection includes photographs he took as well as many taken by others over decades. (Preston as a young man is pictured at right.) These images offer glimpses of the region’s past: industries, homes, parades, schools, street and waterfront scenes, disasters, schools, and quite a few once-famous actors participating in the region’s early 20th-century film industry. And as of October 1st, visitors to the Library’s Digital Collections can now browse and explore the entirety of this significant collection from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Historic Photograph Collection has always been of great interest for students as well as visiting researchers who would pore over the boxes of printed photographs (the collection fills 154 boxes) in the Special Collections & Archives Reading Room in search of details of history, genealogy, vernacular photography, and film history. Teresa Mora, Head of Special Collections & Archives, describes the collection as “a boon to local historians, genealogists and amateur researchers, providing unique insights into various aspects of Santa Cruz history as well as a better and deeper understanding of how the Santa Cruz of today came to be.”\n\nFall 2020 workshops hosted by Special Collections & Archives\n\n14 September 2020\n\nThe Fall 2020 calendar of archives-focused workshops is now available on the Library's calendar.
