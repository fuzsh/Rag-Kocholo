        "text": "There’s not much that hasn’t already been said about the Lancia Delta HF Integrale. Every bona fide petrolhead knows that this compact family hatchback, designed by Giugiaro, won the World Rally Championship six times, back-to-back, between 1987 and 1992, raising the Italian marque to an uncontested number one ranking among rallying’s elite. With a total of 44,296 built, the Integrale evolved through four separate stages. Its success story began by chance in one of rallying’s darkest years, 1986. A string of serious crashes, some fatal, prompted the FIA to call an urgent halt, cancelling Group B and its 500bhp supercars. When it became clear that cars would be allowed to compete under Group A regulations the following year, Lancia was the first to respond, by submitting a homologation model based on…\n\nPart of the great wave of immigrants to Los Angeles before World War II, the Hungarian-born, Viennese-trained architect and interior designer Paul László had a softer take on midcentury modernism that incorporated unexpected color choices, luxurious textures, and a European savoir faire. Working in Beverly Hills from the 1930s to 1960s, he had a wide-ranging career designing homes for Elizabeth Taylor, Barbara Hutton, and Cary Grant, alongside stores for Bullocks Wilshire and Robinson’s, hotels and casinos for Howard Hughes, and furniture for Herman Miller. For Pamela Shamshiri, who cofounded her eponymous L.A.-based studio alongside her brother, Ramin, in 2016, the restoration of a 1957 László beach house in Pacific Palisades presented the opportunity to have an imagined dialogue with one of her 20th-century design heroes. “He had a sense of humor…\n\nThis year’s iPhone upgrades were never going to be as dramatic as last year’s when Apple overhauled the smartphone and introduced 5G connectivity for the first time, but that’s not to say the iPhone 13 series doesn’t pack its punch. With improved cameras, more storage, and a bunch of under-the-hood features, the world’s greatest smartphone just got even better. INTRODUCING THE iPHONE 13 FAMILY At a virtual event titled California Streaming, Tim Cook and Co took to the stage to show off what they had been working on over the past year. True to form, this year’s iPhone upgrades aren’t quite as dramatic as the year prior - in fact, this year’s iPhone could very much be sold under an iPhone 12S moniker - but they’re still worthy additions. Apple has tweaked…\n\nSimone Ashley is waiting for me, perched serenely near the window of a Greek grocery shop just off the main drag of London’s Broadway Market. I’m not late, so that makes her early. Dressed in athleisure and tennies, she greets me with a relaxed hug like we’re old pals—surprising, since hugging strangers is not particularly English. I melt awkwardly into it like the American expat I am, thawing out after having avoided physical contact with other people for two years during the pandemic. It all makes more sense when she tells me that, despite being British, she’s a California girl at heart, having moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue acting, which kicked off a decade of living between L.A. and London. “I love the ocean so much,”…\n\n“EVEN IF PRINTING SOCIAL HOUSING FOR THE MASSES WERE TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE TODAY, THE TECHNOLOGY CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM.” In March 2021, Germany’s first 3D printed house in Beckum is set to be completed. In China, Russia and many other countries, first trial neighbourhoods consisting exclusively of 3D printed houses are starting to mushroom. In Mexico’s federal state of Tabasco, a non-profit organisation has built several complete homes using 3D printing. This works with a combination of cement and advanced additives. The mixture is printed from a huge printer that layers the material. Within days, a whole house can be printed. Advantages of 3D printing houses seem convincing: the material is very resistant, withstands even extreme climatic conditions and can be manufactured anywhere in the world. Completion of a 3D printed house is…\n\nAfter lifelike timbres and speed-train momentum, how a loudspeaker projects its energy into my room is the main thing that determines how my sound system feels as I listen to it. When I review loudspeakers, I try to notice the unique tone and force of their “voice” as they speak into my room. Do they stand too close, stick out their chests, and brag loudly in third harmonics? Or do they have small voices that force me to lean in to make out what they’re saying? With a miniature box speaker like my reference Falcon Gold Badge LS3/5as or the similarly sized Harbeth P3ESR XDs, which I’m auditioning this month, I have to sit very close to experience any of their direct, “off-the-cone” energy. If my listening position gets too far…\n\nHOW UPSET WOULD you be? One lovely May afternoon you are cruising along, doing no-one any harm, in your Ferrari 275 GTB/4, resplendent in Rosso Rubino. Your pride and joy, paid for over many years by the sweat of your brow. As you slow carefully behind a truck for some traffic lights, the idiot in the white van behind you is texting on his mobile. He fails to notice the red light, and suddenly SCREECH, BANG, CRUNCH! Your most-prized asset has become the red meat in the sandwich. That gorgeous Kamm tail has been shortened by at least six inches and the petrol tank is ruptured, fuel everywhere. The shapely grille, nose and those delicate bumperettes are squashed horribly into the truck in front. Not only a broken radiator and both…\n\nFor a profession built on expressing other people’s tastes, it can be slightly confounding when the tables turn and the client is yourself. That was the situation that Richard Angel, CEO and co-founder of design firm Angel O’Donnell, found himself in when he embarked on a major renovation of his family home. Located in the leafy suburb of Streatham in south London, the handsome house was a real find when Angel discovered it 10 years ago. “My wife and I were looking for a home we could grow into and raise a family in. We were already living south of the river in a place called Balham, but property is pricey so we cast our net a little wider. That’s when we found Copley Park, a large and rather grand…\n\nREMEMBERING ANDREW SINGER Michael Trei Andrew N. Singer, founder and owner of New York City high-end audio retailer Sound By Singer, died Sunday, April 21, 2024, following a lengthy illness. He was 73 years old. Born and raised in New York City by a Jewish father and a French mother, Andy did what any good Jewish kid would do to please his parents: got a law degree and went to work for a prestigious New York City law firm. All went well at first, but after about three years he came to realize that the legal profession bored him to tears. Switching gears, he decided to follow his real passions—music, audio equipment, and building audio systems—and established Sound By Singer in 1978 in the living room of his parents’ Manhattan apartment. Within a couple…\n\nTHE NIGHTS ARE THE HARDEST, when he lies there on his cot, the whine of the air-raid sirens in his ears and his phone still buzzing beside him. Its screen makes his face look like a ghost in the dark, his eyes scanning messages he didn’t have a chance to read during the day. Some from his wife and kids, many from his advisers, a few from his troops, surrounded in their bunkers, asking him again and again for more weapons to break the Russian siege. Inside his own bunker, the President has a habit of staring at his daily agenda even when the day is over. He lies awake and wonders whether he missed something, forgot someone. “It’s pointless,” Volodymyr Zelensky told me at the presidential compound in Kyiv, just…\n\nIt's highly likely that at some stage, you'll come face to face with a sheep eye-balling you through the floor-to-ceiling windows in this house. Led by Fiona Dunin of Melbourne's FMD Architects, the design of this rural dwelling on Tasmania's Bruny Island quite deliberately planned for that kind of calm ovine contemplation when responding to a brief for a low-maintenance home with a close connection to its immediate and wider surrounds — a contemporary interpretation of the Australian farmhouse. The homeowners — a couple who divide their days between this working sheep farm and city life in Melbourne — also sought a house that could accommodate just the two of them for most of the year, and 20 or more guests at other times. The resulting shed-like dwelling (named Coopworth after…\n\nAFTER THE MOST Januaryish January ever, finally there’s some joy on the horizon that doesn’t involve tequila or the expense of jetting off to far-flung sunny shores. All it requires is a trip to the cinema. Which is where I was when I saw the trailer for a romcom that ticks every box on my wish list. Aerial shot of a dramatic New York skyline? Tick. Thumping, just the right side of cheesy soundtrack? Tick. The bloke who played Samwell Tarly in Game Of Thrones? Tick. Completely implausible plot? Tick. Jennifer Lopez as the female lead? Giant tick, plus an extra gold star for campness. Everyone loves a wedding and everyone loves J-Lo. Put them together and you get Marry Me , a film whose starting premise seems inspired by J-Lo’s…\n\n“We wanted a house that would take us on a voyage, to a place removed from the hustle and bustle of the city” When architect Raëd Abillama and his Austro-American wife Laura Braverman decided to move away from the centre of Beirut in Lebanon several years ago, their intent was quite clear. “We wanted a house that would take us on a voyage, to a place removed from the hustle and bustle of the city, from the stress and breakneck speed of Lebanese life,” he says. The site they chose is located on a hillside in Dbayeh some 15km to the east of Beirut, which until the 1970s was largely home to orange and clementine orchards. Today, the seafront district is built-up, but the Abillamas have managed to create what…\n\nIt happens every time, in every city, with every book tour. I’ll do a reading, and talk about my new book—where I got the inspiration, how I decided on a setting, which characters were my favorites, what messages I hope readers take away. I’ll answer questions from the audience; then, when there’s no global pandemic, I’ll sit and sign books and pose for pictures. Readers wait in line patiently. They wrap their arms around me, and press their cheeks close to mine as we smile for the camera. And every time, at least one woman touches my arm, and says, “I feel like we could be best friends!” I smile back, and say something polite. And every time, my heart breaks a little bit. Because, every time, a voice inside of me…\n\nWe don’t often get a chance to peer into tomorrow, but spending half an hour for a free demo of Vision Pro at an Apple store is one of those opportunities not to be missed. My first encounter with the virtual reality headset that Apple refers to as “a spatial computer” was a jaw-dropping experience that had me reaching for my wallet—almost. Since last year when Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, announced this groundbreaking product, I’ve been intrigued by the prospect of revisiting a type of personal technology that’s been kicking around for 30 years but has never broken into the mainstream. Once Vision Pro went on sale in February, I was able to book a demo at my closest Apple store through the company’s website. The Apple Store at Queens Center was…\n\nFRANKENTERIOR: A HOME THAT’S been renovated, piecemeal, by different owners over the years. That’s what Laguna Beach, California, designer Sheldon Harte, founder and principal of Harte Brownlee & Associates, found in this 1920s Spanish-style Palm Springs home, a victim of seven uninspiring updates that had introduced everything from clashing wood floors and off-center windows to a jarringly modern stainless steel kitchen—and four different types of chimneys. “The house just didn’t make sense,” says Harte of the cobbled-together design. “We tried to unify it and give it a lot more continuity.” The owners, a couple with grown kids and grandkids, would be using it as a second home. So “it was important that the house feel livable and not too serious,” says the homeowner. After overhauling the plumbing and electrical systems, Harte worked…\n\n@brendanmarkcole “A person can become globally depleted to the point where they have no resources” » P.16 ÉRIC ZEMMOUR BECOMING PRESIDENT OF France would be a “disaster,” one political operative in Paris tells Newsweek as the shadow of the far-right TV host looms increasingly over next year’s election. Over the last few weeks, Zemmour—who was born in Paris to a Jewish family from Algeria—has been promoting his best seller France Hasn’t Had Its Last Word, which claims that Islam and immigration will destroy the country. On screen and on the front pages, the 63-year-old is riding a wave of media prominence built upon his popular talk show on CNews, a right-wing television network likened to Fox News that in May became France’s No. 1 news network for the first time. He openly promotes the “Great…\n\nMovavi’s goal for its video-editing software is to enable simple movie and clip creation, avoiding the sometimes needless complexity of the competition. That sounds great, but does it pan out in practice? After all, creating compelling videos often requires lots of advanced tools and capabilities. You also want a program that’s responsive and renders the final product quickly. The short answer? Yes. Movavi Video Editor Plus is one of the best we’ve seen at packing a lot of capability into a non-intimidating interface. PROS: Easy-to-understand user interface. Transitions with sound. Motion tracking and picture-in-picture tools. Chroma keying. Quick movie-creation tool. CONS: Lacks advanced trim modes and clip pre-trimming. Rendering on the slow side. Not compatible with Apple Silicon M1. BOTTOM LINE: Movavi packs a lot of video editing power into a clear, simple…\n\nRoku’s 2020 model of the Ultra media streamer is an iterative update to the line. The previous Ultra was already a powerful, feature-filled media hub, so the fact that the new model simply adds Dolby Vision support and faster processing isn’t a letdown. The Ultra can stream 4K HDR content, supports loads of apps and services, and its remote includes a headphone jack for privately listening to whatever you’re watching. It remains a top pick among high-end media streaming devices, but at $99.99, it feels a bit pricey compared with some other new models. PROS: Fast performance. AirPlay and Dolby Vision support. Remote has a headphone jack for private listening. CONS: Expensive. Still doesn’t have a fully functional voice assistant. Missing Twitch. BOTTOM LINE: The 2020 model of the Roku Ultra media streamer…\n\nThe ECS Liva Z3 Plus may not look like much of a system, but packed inside this not-quite-palm-size device is a Core i5 desktop capable of running office tasks with ease. The model seen here is held back by its skimpy 4GB of standard onboard RAM, but if you don’t mind springing for a second SO-DIMM stick to upgrade it to 8GB and a Windows 10 license (an OS is not preinstalled), you’ll find the Liva Z3 Plus a highly affordable, potent mini PC for everyday computing in places where you don’t have room for a tower of any kind. PROS: Highly compact design. Core i5 processor. Wi-Fi 6 support. Alexa-compatible internal mic array. Affordable price tag. Easy to work on and maintain. CONS: Ships with just 4GB of RAM. Old-school BIOS.…\n\nThe Hisense 350-sq. ft. Window Air Conditioner is a reasonably priced Wi-Fi-enabled window AC unit that you can control with your voice, your phone, or the included remote. It’s easy to install and did an admirable job of cooling in our tests. It doesn’t offer power usage reports or compatibility with Apple HomeKit and IFTTT like some other smart air conditioners we’ve tested, but it also costs less than many 8,000-BTU models, making it an affordable option for small to medium spaces. PROS: Reasonably priced. Easy to install. Fast cooling. Voice control. Relatively quiet. CONS: Lacks usage reporting. Doesn’t support HomeKit or IFTTT. BOTTOM LINE: The Hisense 350-Sq. Ft. Window Air Conditioner is a smart AC unit that can be controlled by your phone, voice, or remote, and does a fine job of…\n\nAdecentralized approach to management may become more prevalent in a post–COVID-19 world, and it is true that autonomy can be empowering in an organization. But it also has risks. When I asked the managing partner of a US-based multinational brokerage firm how he makes sure that autonomy and initiative-taking in an organization do not end up in disaster, his reply was: “I give my people the canvas and the paint. It’s up to them to decide what they paint and how.” What he meant by this was that his people can have autonomy but within certain boundaries: yes, they can paint whatever they want, but it has to be on our canvas, using only the paint that we give them. A similar analogy was given to me by the CEO…\n\nHow to Survive: Self-Reliance in Extreme Circumstances, by John Hudson, Countryman Press, 2021 If you think meetings are bad, try getting lost in remotest Australia and rigging up floats from aircraft parts to ride down a crocodile-infested river to safety. Or staying alive in the jungles of Southeast Asia for three and a half years while enemy troops endeavor to hunt you down. The most compelling parts of How to Survive: Self-Reliance in Extreme Circumstances are about just such astonishing feats of stamina and ingenuity, the sort of resourcefulness that has enabled humans to withstand adverse conditions for remarkable periods of time. Salvador Alvarenga, for example, the world’s longest documented survivor at sea, “spent 438 days drifting across the Pacific Ocean when his fishing trip from Mexico went wrong in 2012.” Yet the takeaways…\n\nASHLEY WILSON KNOWS WHAT YOU’RE THINKING. AQUA BLUE KITCHEN CABINETS, A PINK REFRIGERATOR, TIGER-PRINT WALLPAPER, AND STAIR RISERS SWABBED WITH EVERY COLOR OF THE RAINBOW? “People always ask me what I’m going to do when I sell the house, and the answer is, ‘I don’t care!’” she says. “The beauty is that I get to have a house that’s designed for our family rather than live in a beige house.” There’s certainly nothing beige or blah about the Wilsons’ two-story Victorian built in 1905 in Logan, Utah. Each wall and surface radiates with Ashley’s signature girly-glam style, which combines happy vibes and statement wallpaper with modern light fixtures and glamorous gold accents. “What is my formula?” she asks. “I like white painted walls because that balances out the crazy colors. I do…\n\nThey are the epicenter of daily life in the residences at the Grand Traverse Pavilions—seven beautiful courtyards at the heart of each pavilion, a place where the senior residents can gather, relax, grow and share vegetables and flowers, enjoy a picnic or watch the birds flit in and out of the feeders. But this year finds the rose bushes unpruned, the hydrangea drooping and overgrown, a mix of scrappy weeds springing up in the raised beds instead of the vibrant crop of Big Boys, Early Girls, zinnias and sunflowers that residents would so proudly harvest and share. With the pandemic, the priority on resident safety meant staff were focused on immediate care needs, and vendors and volunteers were unable to freely access the internal courtyards, leaving the gardens uncharacteristically untended. But as the…\n\nINTERLOCHEN STATE PARK Michigan’s oldest state park has a precious 187 acres between Green and Duck lakes in Grand Traverse County. In winter, people walk or snowshoe the camp roads or atop the ice on Duck Lake. The beauty of this park is how quiet it is. With no marked trails, it’s a local best-kept secret. You can hike and immerse yourself in a late-rising sunrise (around 8 a.m. in winter) and admire the ice fishermen and women making their way out onto the lake. The boat launch is plowed so fishermen can park and hike out, pulling their jet sleds to fishing holes either on foot or with four-wheelers. If you want to try ice fishing, expect perch, bluegill or northern pike. Each has a season, limits and size restrictions. Fishing licenses…\n\nTHE PETOSKEY-BASED FIRM WHITE & LIEBLER Architects specializes in designing period homes for 21st-century living. So, when the new owner of a 1990s log home on Walloon Lake came to Nick Liebler with the hopes of updating the interior and transforming the exterior into a classic shingle-style home, he was all in. “The owner is well-traveled and has a great appreciation for architecture,” Liebler says. Shingle style was first popularized in the 19th century on the New England coast, around the time of the American centennial. Among those to embrace and popularize the style were legendary New York architects McKim, Mead & White, who were drawn to the simpler, more American trend rather than the ornate styles that had reigned during the Victorian era. The blueprints to transform the log home…\n\nIt’s super trendy to green your home with houseplants these days – just check out #houseplantclub and #plantshelfie on Instagram. Besides being pleasing to the eye and calming to the mind, indoor plants have been scientifically proven to be good for your health. For one, some plants can purify the air by removing harmful substances such as benzene, formaldehyde and ammonia. This ability was studied by America’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in its Clean Air Study, conducted in the late 1980s, when the agency was looking for ways to clean the air in its space stations. Additionally, a study, published last year, by the UK’s Royal Horticultural Society, found that because of transpiration (when plants lose water through their leaves), certain indoor plants can significantly increase the moisture in the…\n\nWhat are you hoping to achieve through your images? My personal mission statement is three words – communicate, educate, inspire. When it comes to imagery, there are no language barriers, so using pictures to educate and inspire people can be a powerful way of communicating with a global audience. Despite the many success stories, we continue to hear comments which decry many conservation efforts. I believe that powerful images which reveal the beauty and intricacy of wild nature are critical in raising awareness and keeping people’s interest, faith and hope alive. There’s a deceptively simple cinematic quality to much of your work – how do you achieve this? Simplicity is something I strive towards. I believe that overcomplicated images are confusing for the viewer, and this confusion can lead to detachment. By keeping…\n\nEACH MORNING WHEN CHRIS ALDRIDGE unlocks the doors to Country Retreat Family Billiards & Grill, his little pool-table paradise located on a stretch of NC Highway 105 about midway between Linville and Boone, he feels a sense of pride. This is not your typical rowdy pool hall. Conspicuous in its absence: alcohol. There’s no drinking at Family Billiards. No fighting. No cursing. “Pool rooms have kind of a negative connotation,” Aldridge says over the din of an afternoon rush — the thwack of cues sending balls skittering across felt, the sounds of burgers sizzling on a grill in the back. “But we’ve been very family-friendly.” He’s surrounded by blue walls lined with signed photographs of professional pool players and 10 commercial-quality Gabriels billiards tables, whose surfaces glow under bright LED lights. Another…\n\nEACH TIME CHERRY BEASLEY walks into the Weinstein Health Sciences Building at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke, she steps across a tiled image of a turtle, a sacred Lumbee symbol. Its round shell is a Native American medicine wheel split into four colors — black, red, yellow, and white — that represent the stages of life, as well as the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual parts of a person. The design is intentional: Each element embraces central parts of Lumbee culture. “It reminds me of my call to practice,” Beasley says. “My call to be a nurse, to care for people, to be holistic.” Beasley is one of 55,000 members of the Lumbee Nation, the largest Native tribe in the state and the largest tribe east of the Mississippi.…\n\nWhen a big stock dives, as Meta Platforms Inc. did on Oct. 27, dropping almost 25%, investors are often urged to take the long view of its performance. In this case, it hardly helps. If you bought Meta five years ago—back when the company was still known as Facebook—you’d be down about 49%, in a period when the S&P 500 climbed 45%. Meta has not only erased its gains from the pandemic, which turned social media into an essential technology, but also fallen back to where it was in 2015. Meta isn’t just another stock—it was a constituent of the FAANG group, investors’ shorthand for a set of seemingly invincible technology companies. Along with the former Facebook, there were Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. Despite their high valuations, many…\n\nAmerica’s sway over the world economy is being eroded by self-inflicted policy wounds, with a dangerous standoff over the debt ceiling putting renewed scrutiny on the dollar’s preeminent status in global trade and finance. A behind-the-curve Federal Reserve struggling to corral inflation, a string of bank failures and now a political deadlock over the government’s ability to borrow are chipping away at US authority. At the same time, geopolitical fault lines are hardening, with the US assisting Ukraine in its war against Russia and locked in competition with China, two adversaries poised to exploit any misstep by policymakers in Washington—such as a first-ever US debt default. Warnings about the decline of American prestige are everywhere. “Anything that moves us away from being viewed as the world’s reserve currency, of being the safest,…\n\nIn a Thursday night in spring, the lobby of the Hotel Danieli, near Piazza San Marco in Venice, stirs awake and, with the twilight at its windows, comes to life in dazzling evening dress. Women weave between the furniture in yellow suits and beautifully draped dresses. Men tread the stone floors and Old World rugs in interesting shoes. The travellers are glamorous and restless, with a charge of misbehaviour spilling out on to the edge of the canals. Venice, the unchanging city, seems in the thrall of energy that is brand-new. Matthieu Blazy of Bottega Veneta appears as if from nowhere and whirls down the hotel’s main staircase toward the crowd below. He is tall, with cropped light-brown hair, and wears a loose tan summer suit – double-breasted, open, with the…\n\nAs Apple continues to ramp up its subscription services to bolster revenue streams, the Cupertino company is now reportedly considering moving into the hardware subscription sphere, offering some of its most iconic products, like iPhones and iPads, on monthly plans. The scheme could revolutionize the way we purchase tech and unlock new possibilities. A GROWING SUBSCRIPTION ARM In recent years, Apple has made no secret of the fact it wanted to reduce its heavy reliance on hardware and increase profit margins from its service division. Indeed, as iPhone sales began to plateau with the company seemingly ‘perfecting’ the iPhone and only adding small changes year by year, the company began to invest heavily in a string of new service offerings that have had mixed rates of success. Indeed, Apple Music, which launched…\n\nWhen the Queen came to the throne, Prince Philip’s ambitious uncle boasted “the House of Mountbatten now reigned”. But Queen Mary, fearing the name of the Windsor dynasty created by her husband in 1917 was under threat, persuaded the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, to raise the issue with the Queen. The new monarch issued a proclamation that she and her descendants “shall be styled and known as the House of Windsor”, leaving the Duke to fume: “I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children. I’m nothing but a bloody amoeba.” Eight years later the Queen modified her decree to announce her descendants, if non-royal, could be called Mountbatten-Windsor. But while he might have had to settle for second best in their public…\n\nON A COLLISION COURSE (“Is the Universe Infinite?”, Dec 2020) In the article is this statement: “Soon they learned the universe was expanding, too, with galaxies retreating from each other at ever-accelerating speeds.” If this is correct, there can be no collisions between galaxies. But then how does one explain spiral galaxies, the origins of which are explained by the collision of two or more galaxies? James AdieEnterprise, Ala. Author Eric Betz responds: For brevity’s sake, we omitted a detail pertinent to your question. Galaxies in general are retreating from each other, or red-shifted. This was first established observationally by Vesto Slipher and Edwin Hubble, and it’s been confirmed by repeated observations over the past century. However, from our local perspective, a handful of galaxies, like Andromeda, are actually blue-shifted, or moving closer to us.…\n\nThe New York Times described Super Apps as the “Swiss Army knife of apps.” Super Apps are multifunctional applications that unify numerous mobile app services into a common interface - sometimes through an ecosystem of different providers whose components are integrated into a seamless mobile experience. Super Apps are especially popular with Gen-Z and Millennial consumers, and as ASEAN is home to one of the youngest populations in the world, it is tipped to become a Super App supermarket. According to the Singapore Economic Development Board, the ASEAN Super App market will be worth US$23 billion in revenue by 2025 (up from US$4 billion in 2020) on the back of five main revenue drivers - ride sharing, food delivery, fintech, digital banking, and e-commerce. ASEAN’s demographics, emerging Super App ecosystems, and strong…\n\nThe tools of talent management — hiring, on-boarding, performance reviews — are changing, some for now, others for good. Teamwork, collaboration, and tacit knowledge-sharing have also been disrupted. The mere fact that many people are separated from friends and colleagues, which can strain their relationships, is a big deal: Affirmative answers to the question “Do you have a best friend at work?” consistently correlate with higher employee retention, better customer metrics, increased productivity, and greater profitability, according to Gallup. Quite simply, work is different today. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended workplace routines and destroyed norms. Team rooms have become Zoom rooms. Gone are the informal chats in the hallway or by the coffee machine. Bullpens and hoteling designs are out, private offices are in, off-sites are over, and business travel has…\n\nTo many Singaporean designers, the chance to work on a shophouse project is certainly an opportunity to be relished or even a dream come true. Known for their distinctive facade, airy internal courtyard and light-filled spaces, these historical buildings offer many creative possibilities to the adventurous designer, even as they come with all the technical and regulatory complexities innate to any conservation project. When Cube Associate Design was tasked by a family office to redesign the interior of one such beautiful pre-war building in Singapore’s Ann Siang Road, the firm’s founder, Sarah Tham, embraced the challenge with gusto. The client was clear that the 4,500 sq ft workspace should not be “boring or typical”, while being open to creative ideas and suggestions from the designers. “The brief was simple: ‘don’t…\n\nCeltic Kyogo Furuhashi hit the ground running in August at his new club Celtic, with a hat-trick in his home debut against Dundee and the goals have kept on coming. As of late August, he was also still top scorer in this season’s J.League, which kicked off in February, with15 goals in 21 appearances for Vissel Kobe. Arriving as he does from the star-studded Vissel team, where he has played alongside the likes of Andres Iniesta, David Villa and Lukas Podolski, he might easily be taken for a golden child ofJapanese football, marked out for success from an early age. In fact, few fans even in Japan had heard of him in his early years. He did not represent Japan through the youth levels, went to university, and failed to find a…\n\nSince the launch of Apple Pay back in 2014, Apple has changed the way we shop and spend money, with subsequent refinements and additions like Face ID and Apple Card that have made shopping even more convenient. Now, the Cupertino company plans to add yet another string to its bow and make iPhone and Apple Pay truly invaluable for merchants. SHOPPING WITH APPLE In markets like the United Kingdom, Apple has a stronghold over contactless payments, with a reported six in ten shoppers in the UK using Apple Pay in-store. And although the United States is behind European markets when it comes to shopping via their smartphones thanks to consumers favoring credit cards and platforms like PayPal and Venmo, Apple Pay is now growing its dominance in the market. Indeed, over the…\n\nTHE U.S., WHERE computer chips were invented, hasn’t manufactured leading-edge chips since 2017. From then until now, the world’s fastest, most valuable chips, the kind that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Apple’s newest iPhones, and the world’s biggest super computers, have been made only in Taiwan and South Korea. But sometime next year, if all goes as planned, the U.S. will reclaim global leadership when Intel starts producing in volume a next-generation chip in the U.S. The chip technology, which Microsoft has already committed to use as the foundation for Intel-made proprietary chips, probably won’t be fully matched elsewhere for at least many months. The dramatic turnaround owes much to the CHIPS and Science Act, which was signed into law in 2022 to revive semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. Some $52 billion in…\n\nSt-Estèphe 1 TOP SCORING Château Montrose 2CC 99 £113.33 (ib)-£145 A generous and abundant nose full of fruit and aromatic intensity followed by a gorgeous mouthfeel showcasing fruit density and concentration wrapped up in soft, velvety-smooth tannins. Just so much depth but also refinement, with just the right amount of fruit, toasty spice, tannins, freshness and acidity. The overall structure gently frames all the elements – big and bold but quietly confident. The tannin impact is also enjoyable, giving a feeling of approachability despite the long life ahead. Superb. Drink 2029-2046 Alcohol 14.5% TOP SCORING Château Cos d’Estournel 2CC 98 £120 (ib)-£185 Vivid red-purple rim to the glass; blue fruits, plums and black cherries presented with a pleasant floral aspect alongside a wonderful freshly brewed coffee aroma, soft and delicate but just noticeable. This is absolutely…\n\nIt’s been more than a year since Apple discontinued its HomePod speaker, and though its mini successor has helped the Cupertino company increase its smart home market share, there’s still a long way to go. Apple is now planning to reinvigorate the space by launching an all-new HomePod with advanced capabilities - and rumors suggest could arrive this year. ALL-NEW HOMEPOD According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has correctly predicted a number of recent Apple launches, like the Mac Studio and AirPods 3, Apple is planning to launch a new version of its HomePod later this year. The company made the unusual decision of discontinuing the original model back in 2021, presumably due to low sales, and instead launched a more affordable $99 HomePod mini, which offered many of the…\n\nSometimes, the best way to overcome a difficult situation is to embrace the problem. Tasked to redesign an apartment in the Trillium condominium, Singapore design practice Mr Shopper Studio looked at the unconventional shape of its living room as an opportunity rather than an inconvenience. The firm aimed to give the 1,850 sq ft home a number of design elements that capitalise on its peculiarities, coupled with a modern classic scheme for an enduring aesthetic. “We faced a couple of challenges on this project, such as the oddly shaped layout of the living space,” says Johan Ng, senior interior designer at Mr Shopper Studio, who worked on the revamp of the three-bedroom unit. CURVES AHEAD To play up the unique contours of the living room, which is curved along one…\n\nChanging the aperture of your lens is one of the fundamentals of photography, allowing you to alter both the exposure of a picture and how much of it appears sharply focused. The aperture itself requires little explanation: it’s a physical hole in the lens that light passes through to reach your camera’s imaging sensor. In most lenses, this hole is formed by overlapping blades that create a diaphragm, the size of which regulates how much light is let into the camera. Large apertures let more light into the camera, while small apertures reduce the amount of light; that bit is easy to understand. What can be more confusing is the set of numbers that represent the size of the aperture. The first thing to understand is that f-numbers aren’t a physical measurement of…\n\nI first heard about Soulution (the name is a concatenation of “soul” and “solution”) from solid-state amp/preamp maven and loudspeaker-designer Alon Wolf way back in 2008. At the time, I knew nothing about the brand, and when I looked it up on-line and discovered it was owned by another Swiss company called Spemot that specialized in building electrical motors and refrigeration units for the automotive industry, I was not enthralled. Shades of Crown, thought I. Then I chanced upon a rave review of a Soulution product—the 120Wpc dual-mono Soulution 710 stereo amp—in the tough-minded German hi-fi magazine Stereo and got more interested. You see Stereo had pronounced the 710 a sonic and technological wunderkind. Indeed, the amp had tested so unprecedentedly low in distortion, so high in channel separation, so…\n\nIt’s been one heck of a year in the world of desktop graphics cards. From silicon shortages to cryptocurrency craziness, the average price of a graphics card in 2021 has surged past all expectations, with models both used and new selling for multiples more than the original prices, even years after their initial release. Realities of the current marketplace aside, though, we’re here to talk about the objective performance of the latest object of desire for GPU shoppers (and likely newest target for scalpers), the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and how it stacks up against its own (hopefully, one day!) objective manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $1,199. PROS: Beautiful, functional design, like other Founders Edition cards. Low-noise operation, even under stress. Compact profile given the raw muscle. Improves upon original…\n\nSmart thermostats make it easy to control your home’s heating and cooling system from just about anywhere, and the Sensi Touch Smart Thermostat ST75 is no different. But in addition to phone and voice control, it offers a responsive color touch-screen control panel. Easy on the eyes and simple to install, the ST75 is a bit more expensive than our Editors’ Choice winner for affordable thermostats, the Nest Thermostat ($129.99). That said, the Sensi model adds support for Apple’s HomeKit and Samsung’s SmartThings home automation platforms, as well as native Siri voice control, making it an excellent alternative to the Nest Thermostat for those who use any of those systems. PROS: Reasonably priced. Works with Alexa, Google, and Siri voice commands. Supports Apple HomeKit. Usage reports. CONS: Lacks remote sensors. Doesn’t support…\n\nThe ThinkPad T series has been Lenovo’s quintessential bread-and-butter business laptop for years, offered in both Intel and AMD flavors in models landing both above and below the 3-pound mark. At 2.8 pounds, the new ThinkPad T14s is one of the lightweight variants, splitting the difference between the 3.2-pound ThinkPad T14 and 2.4-pound ThinkPad X1 Carbon ultraportable. It lacks the cachet of the Carbon, but the eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 Pro processor of the T14s seen here might make it the best price and performance pick on Lenovo’s 14-inch business menu. PROS: Potent eight-core Ryzen Pro processor. Exemplary keyboard. Usual sterling ThinkPad build quality. CONS: No 4K screen option. No Thunderbolt 3 port. So-so webcam quality. BOTTOM LINE: Lenovo’s Ryzen-based ThinkPad T14s is by and large a spectacular success. Our one caveat: The…\n\nYour antivirus may protect your computer, but a VPN protects your computer where it touches the internet, sending your web traffic from your computer to the internet via an impenetrable tunnel. Golden Frog VyprVPN has a robust offering of servers across the world as well as a strong privacy policy, but it offers fewer features than its competitors and at a higher monthly price. VyprVPN does the job, but you simply get more (sometimes for less) with our Editors’ Choice picks. PROS: Strong commitment to customer privacy. Latest VPN technology. Good geographic distribution of VPN servers. Snazzy new client. Affordable annual subscription. CONS: Expensive monthly option. Few additional privacy features. Poor speedtest results, pre-WireGuard. BOTTOM LINE: Golden Frog VyprVPN offers the latest VPN technology in a simple and approachable package, along with excellent…\n\nThere’s no end to innovation in home video technology, whether that means 3D, 4K, or 360-degree VR video—and the software you use to edit all that content must keep up. Corel VideoStudio Ultimate does so admirably, and is chockablock with powerful video-editing tools. It lets you perform stop motion, multicam, motion tracking, time remapping, video masking, and audio ducking. Since the program is already so packed with capabilities, the 2021 release, while adding a few new features, is mostly about performance and reliability improvements, which were much needed based on my previous testing. The result is a solid, impressive product with a clear, simple interface that’s loaded with fun editing tools. PROS: Clear, simple interface. Extremely fast rendering. Support for 360-degree VR, 4K Ultra HD, and 3D media. Multipoint Motion tracking.…\n\nWhen COVID-19 forced much of the world to quickly shut down offices, factories, schools, shops, and restaurants, and pushed hundreds of millions of people into remote, makeshift workspaces, no one knew how it would all turn out. Now we know a lot more — and a lot is quite positive. For millions of people, working from home is feasible, welcomed, and productive, even if many companies had to scramble to go digital. Sorting out the fine points will occupy companies throughout 2021, as they analyze the workforce data they’ve been collecting and put what they’ve learned into action. But there were negatives, too: The knock-on economic effects of COVID-19 were particularly rough for women, minorities, and low-skilled workers, not to mention emerging economies such as in Africa, where 70 percent of…\n\nWhen governments came together at Bretton Woods, N.H., in 1944, they relied on a spirit of compromise to found the international institutions that would help rebuild a devastated world. Even as the Second World War raged on, leaders looked ahead to a brighter future, and agreed to a monetary system aimed at avoiding future trade wars. As we strive now through vaccination to put the global pandemic in our rearview mirror, are we at a Bretton Woods moment for the global tax system? The perennial question COVID-19, like war, created human, economic, and fiscal carnage. Deficits, which were already large at the start of 2020, now stand at levels not seen for more than 80 years. And even when we start to return to some semblance of normalcy, governments will need to…\n\nWhile it remained in production, the original Defender was the Land Rover that many people aspired to. When production stopped, we held our breath and waited. Finally, the superb new Defender was here, but it came with a huge price tag. The knock-on effect was predictable; prices of ‘traditional’ Defenders in good condition left the planet, leaving a lot of would-be owners out of the market. Interestingly, a similar scenario unfolded with the much-anticipated Discovery 5 when it was launched in 2017. It received mixed reviews, mostly regarding it’s looks in general, and especially its lack of a split tailgate – a crucial ingredient for any Disco 3 or 4 replacement. Ironically, some say that the new Defender would have made a fine next-generation Discovery, but that’s another story. Amid this unrest,…\n\nAshley & Ameel ASHLEY GILLIES & AMEEL TRABELSY | JULY31, 2021 When their story began, Ashley (now a librarian) was a clerk at one of the courts that Ameel (an attorney) pleaded cases in. Their relationship began casually, going to lunch together when their schedules allowed. Those lunches often included discussions about life—and how neither ever wanted to be married. And then one day they found themselves agreeing that well, maybe they could be “married to someone like you.” Not long after, they spent a weekend at Ashley’s family’s cabin in Oscoda where Ameel built a fire, popped a bottle of champagne and then the question. Ameel and Ashley are both avid campers, so given their shared love of the outdoors, they wanted an outdoor wedding. Their venue search ended when they arrived…\n\nFor a Q&A with couple Ben and Megan Fellows on their intimate Riverside Inn wedding and reception, visit MyNorth.com.

A property for sale on Torch Lake got them interested in the east side of Traverse City and, while they didn’t purchase that property, it did make them realize that the lakes on the east side of town are just as blue and beautiful as the westside lakes. So, when a circa 1930s-40s log cabin on Elk Lake came up for sale, they had a look. If the quaint cabin with its log siding and even more…\n\nRisotto de cangrejo, limón y alga dulse Dificultad: Fácil Tiempo: +60 min.

Quickly, though, she realizes that the noise that’s alarmed the campers is not what it seems to be. “If you’ve never heard a fox at night, it is terrifying. It definitely sounds like a small child or a young woman is screaming.” Her explanation calms nerves, but screaming foxes still freak people out. Luckily, Lloyd has a solution: Listen to an episode of her podcast, in which she demystifies sounds of the night and other topics related to being out in the woods. “I can play [a recording] for folks and be like, ‘Hey, did it sound like this?’…\n\nSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication. I know that Leonardo da Vinci (whose words those were) was a visionary, but even I was amazed that he had already imagined a product such as the Aurender A30 Music Server ‘way back in 1493. In the modern age where state-of-the-art high fidelity reproduction requires that you carefully choose and buy multiple components, work out how best you should connect them, and then work out how to operate everything, Aurender’s A30 is a breath of fresh air. It is just so simple to operate, despite its complexity and the fact that it’s the Swiss Army knife of music playback devices. The Aurender A30 will simplify your music playback experience. Put one in your system and you won’t need your CD player, you won’t need your computer,…\n\n• = caps, goals, clubs and ages (as of 14.05.21) GOALKEEPERS Dean HENDERSON Manchester United Age 24 (12.03.97) A strong finish to the season between the sticks at Manchester United could make him a candidate for the No.1 jersey. Jordan PICKFORD Everton Age 27 (07.03.94) In spite of some sketchy form, Southgate has remained loyal to the Everton goalkeeper since the World Cup, largely due to his distribution skills. Nick POPE Burnley Age 29 (19.04.92) Arguably the best shot-stopper at Southgate’s disposal, Pope’s weakness with the ball at his feet were exposed during March’s World Cup qualifiers. DEFENDERS Ben CHILWELL Chelsea Age 24 (21.12.96) Started five of England’s eight qualifiers before joining Chelsea for £45m, yet the left-back’s place in the side is still not guaranteed. Conor COADY Wolverhampton Wanderers Age 28 (25.02.93) Coady’s experience at the heart of Wolves’ back three over the last few seasons has made him a valuable…\n\nIf there was one sporty bike which I thought would never be available with a fairing, it was the Speed Triple, the bike Triumph initially promoted with a Rottweiler. When it was first launched it was a naked beast of a machine – all no-nonsense attitude. I came very close to buying one, but couldn’t get the deal I wanted. Since those early days the Speed Triple has evolved to be much, much better, but it’s always been a naked with attitude. Never dressed up, never compromised. Until now? OK, I’ll confess: I’ve fallen in love with the Speed Triple, again. The RR, with its svelte half fairing, is stunning to my eyes. I loved it in the pictures and when I threw my leg over one the love of that first model…\n\nIN JUST over five years I will turn 60, which is a daunting prospect. I already have one age-related disease – hypertension – and, given the odds, will be lucky not to have been diagnosed with at least one more by then. After that, age-related conditions are likely to pile up until the inevitable end. It will be a similar story, no doubt, for many of you. We are living longer than before, but those extra years aren’t necessarily healthy ones. Yet if recent developments are anything to go by, my sons may be luckier. Rather than face a laundry list of common ailments in their 70s and 80s, they may be able to immunise themselves against them. They could celebrate middle age with a vaccination that will make them immune…\n\nBuilt at the confluence of two rivers, the city is famous of its oldtown – one of the largest surviving medieval urban fabrics in Northern Europe, listed by UNESCO as a world heritage site. During the Industrial Revolution, which spurred the growth of many European cities, Lithuania was under the rule of the Russian Empire. Its capital Vilnius was a provincial centre at the periphery, therefore the urban development of that period was rather slow. Although it sounds disadvantageous, it allowed Vilnius to preserve its meandering, somewhat accidental medieval oldtown street structure as a foundational ground for the future character of the city – diverse, spontaneous and organic. Highly multicultural due to its history, Vilnius was often the place where the interests of various countries and political groups collided. Even…\n\nCan Martha Argerich really be 80? Sure enough, her contemporaries – the pianists we grew up with – are reaching similar milestones: Brendel turned 90 a few months back, Ashkenazy has passed 80, Barenboim does so next year. But there is something eternally youthful about Argerich, which may in part be down to the very human qualities we perceive in her personality – and a smile that charms now just as it did when she was younger – but fundamentally stems from her piano-playing. Brendel retired at the age of 77, while Ashkenazy and Barenboim have long been more prominent on the conductor’s podium. Argerich, uniquely, still plays the piano with the energy and effervescence that have defined her music-making for as long as we can remember. It is well known…\n\nThe Corbetts had one of the biggest lawns in the cul-de-sac. One Saturday, after David Fritzsche finished mowing his own lawn, he walked over to help Jason Corbett with his. Afterward, the neighbors grabbed chairs and sat in the driveway. Kids flitted in and out, their wives dropped by to chat, and each man drank several beers as afternoon turned to evening. The “driveway social” that unfolded on August 1, 2015, wasn’t uncommon in Meadowlands, a closeknit subdivision in North Carolina. When Jason’s in-laws arrived around 8:30, the Fritzsches went out for dinner and the Corbetts ordered pizza. Before dawn, Jason was dead. The fatal altercation involved his wife, Molly Martens Corbett, and her 65-year-old father, former FBI agent Thomas “Tom” Martens, who, according to an appeals court judgment in the…\n\nMonochromatic, minimalist interiors may be easy on the eye, but with fewer embellishments acting as visual distractions, they can be a challenge to pull off without leaving a space cold and austere. So, to successfully achieve this elegant yet simple aesthetic for a semi-detached house located near Orchard Road, Summerhaus D’zign decided to draw inspiration from the abode’s neoclassical exterior architecture. “We wanted to match the design of the interior to the facade, which bears elements of neoclassical design. We used a dark shade of walnut by staining the wood flooring. This complements the overall whites of the home to evoke a sense of living in a classic colonial house,” says co-founder Larry Lim. It helped that the design studio had also designed this client’s first home back in 2014,…\n\nIn 2008, things were looking grim for Generac. The 49-year-old firm, which makes natural-gas-powered backup generators, had been acquired a couple of years earlier by CCMP Capital, a New York City private equity shop. To buy out the 81-year-old founder’s 70% stake, CCMP had loaded up the Milwaukee-based firm, which had just $700 million in sales, with $1.4 billion in debt. The timing was terrible. In 2006 and 2007, only one hurricane (a big driver of generator sales) made landfall on the U.S. mainland. Then the housing crash and Great Recession scored direct hits, cutting Generac’s earnings by a third before debt service and merger-related charges. CCMP was forced to pony up more cash to prevent a technical debt default and tapped Aaron Jagdfeld, a 33-year-old accountant who had risen internally…\n\nWhen you decided to join your family business, what were your goals? Seematti (seematti.com) was started in 1910 by my grandfather, S Veeriah Reddiar. I joined it in 1980 after my graduation. I was interested in Indian ethnic wear, bridal wear, and celebratory wear from different parts of the country. I wanted to associate with the artisans who created these beautiful pieces, especially those from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, and help them create new designs through Seematti. What was it like to grow up in a household that cherished textiles? Do you remember the first sari you owned? My father adored Seematti. He used to work day in and day out to build it up. He looked after the family as well as the business. I was the only daughter, and…\n\nI GREW UP in Central Java. My first job was working as a travel guide for visitors, then for student interns from Europe. That’s when I started using a camera, and then I knew I wanted to be a photojournalist. I began to freelance, but I wanted more training. In 2015 I got to go to Bali for the Foundry Photojournalism Workshop, where professional photographers teach students like me at low cost. And that’s the start. In the workshop class taught by [National Geographic contributing photographer] Maggie Steber, it’s like I was a baby, or blind, or starting from zero. But I tried to learn and to hear every single word that Maggie said. At the end, there was a festival and awards for the best students in each class. Maggie called…\n\nREMEMBER WHEN cars ran on gasoline, cell phones flipped, and you needed a forklift to get a flagshipmodel AV receiver onto your equipment rack? Denon does. Its new pennant-flying model, the AVR-A1H, clocks in at an impressive 71 pounds. And while I managed to hoist our sample onto my rack unaided—mostly because I was too abashed to ask for help—if I’d had a forklift I for damned sure would have used it. To say that the AVR-A1H is fully featured is like saying that Shohei Ohtani is multitalented. If you can think of it, the new Denon flag probably does it. But the lead story has to be this: Fifteen. As in 15 channels of on-board, built-in amplifier power, ready to drive a 15-channel Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, Auro-3D, or IMAX system, or…\n\nThird European club competition is a welcome restoration At Villa Park on May19, 1999, Christian Vieri and Pavel Nedved scored the goals that gave Lazio a 2-1 win over Mallorca and secured their place in football history as the last-ever winners of the European Cup Winners’ Cup. UEFA president Lennart Johansson and his executive committee had decided that the competition was an anachronism. Never mind that in its 39-year history, winners had included the likes of Ajax, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Juventus, Manchester City and United, and Milan. However, the romance of the game had to bow to the bottom line. For Johansson’s UEFA, the lottery of a cup competition did not conform to the all-commanding cash-safe concept of mini leagues. Patronisingly, in an ominous pointer to the future, they decided…\n\nLong before herd immunity became humanity’s shared obsession, the phrase referred to sick cows. More than a century ago, veterinarians observed that outbreaks of a highly contagious bacterial infection menacing cattle died down once they’d burned through a certain percentage of a herd, so long as new animals weren’t introduced. Soon the concept was extended to a variety of human outbreaks, where it became a staple of epidemiology. Since the beginning of the pandemic, exactly when the U.S. might reach herd immunity for Covid-19 has been furiously debated in congressional hearings, on TV shows, and among the many armchair epidemiologists on Twitter. In the popular imagination, the phrase has become shorthand for the end of the pandemic—a finish line that will suddenly cause the virus to subside and allow maskless normalcy…\n\nThe small group of economists who’ve been maintaining that the US can dodge a recession, despite the most aggressive Federal Reserve tightening in decades, is starting to breathe easier. Many of their peers had expected surging interest rates—up 5 percentage points in just over a year—would have put a more material dent in hiring and personal consumption by now. Instead, the unemployment rate is hovering at a more-than-five-decade low, consumers are still spending, and the housing market is beginning to stabilize. At the same time, inflation has slowed appreciably. That combination is reviving hopes among the true believers, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for a “soft landing” scenario in which price pressures dissipate without massive job losses or an economic downturn. It’s still an out-of-consensus call. Of the 27 forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg…\n\nAS INDIA DESCENDED INTO A COVID-19 tragedy that dwarfed anything the country had experienced in the pandemic so far, with hospitals inundated, oxygen supplies short and vaccines reportedly being stolen from warehouses, American politicians seven thousand miles away were clamoring to end pandemic restrictions. Representative Jim Jordan railed at Dr. Anthony Fauci in the House chambers, “You don’t think Americans’ liberties have been threatened the last year, Dr. Fauci? They’ve been assaulted!” Alabama Governor Kay Ivey told Fox News, “We have been at this for more than a year now, and we have simply got to move forward. Endless government mandates are not the answer.” Many Americans are looking forward to a summer of quasi-normal human interactions, where it’s okay to invite your friends for a barbeque, belly up to a crowded…\n\nConnection, community and the experience of togetherness are central to the Sámi people and their identity – an Indigenous group inhabiting the region of Sápmi, which encompasses large northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Joar Nango not only seeks to build awareness of the tribe’s history, culture and ethos, but also to decolonize the built environment. ‘My point of departure in everything I do is my Sámi identity,’ he explains. ‘We don’t build monuments in landscapes, and our idea about space is a very lightweight, ephemeral one. I think that the types of values that my ancestors practised are very meaningful for us to learn from and to reintroduce to a contemporary form of architecture or design.’ Nango’s work isn’t only grounded in educating…\n\nThe whole “new year, new you” maxim is undoubtedly a cliché. But the truth is that there’s never a bad time to improve your health. So if starting a new orbit around the sun lights a fire under your butt to get moving, run with it (literally). Thanks to all the smart home gym equipment, workout apps and streaming services, fitness trackers, and other consumer health technologies available today, you don’t even need to go to the gym to get lean and make gains. For anyone who’s less than comfortable with the idea of breathing heavily in a confined public space or wearing a mask while working out, this technology is a true blessing. And for those who are new to the world of fitness or just getting back into it…\n\nI don’t like fantasy. Game of Thrones? Lord of the Rings? World of Warcraft? Nope, not for me. I also don’t like battle royale games. Whether it’s the realism of PUBG or the wackiness of Fortnite, I find games where you compete to be the last one standing more boring than tense. So how did Spellbreak, a game whose whole hook is being a fantasy battle royale, become one of my favorite PC game surprises of the year? Ironically, by using the creative potential of the fantasy genre, it breathes new life into the tired battle royale formula. PROS: Engaging, approachable take on battle royale genre. Creative magic combat system. Pretty, post-apocalyptic fantasy art style. Cross-play multiplayer and profiles carry over across devices CONS: Forgettable cosmetics. Unengaging progression system. BOTTOM LINE: Spellbreak’s fast-paced,…\n\nWorking out on your own can be a struggle, or it can be a blast. It all depends on whether you’ve found a fitness activity that excites you and motivates you to get up and move. Here’s the good news about workout apps: App stores are absolutely saturated with them, which means there’s something for everyone at a range of prices. Whether you like to lift weights on your own, want to join a high-intensity cardio class, or need guidance while training for a marathon, you’re sure to find an app for you. Want more good news? Prices for fitness apps are often lower than they appear; the prices given below are list prices, which is not necessarily what you’ll pay. Workout subscriptions are perpetually on sale. App makers would love for…\n\nBending Branch Winery, Comfort BENDINGBRANCHWINERY.COM WINNING WINE 2017 Tannat Tasting Notes“It’s amazing to see how well Tannat is doing in Texas. This wine is big and robust with dark red fruit, blackberry, and dewberry, baking chocolate, spice. It’s full-bodied, with dense, well-integrated tannin.”— Jack Mason“Chewy, leathery, and ripe tannins exemplifying the best of the Tannat grape variety. Note how the baking chocolate from oak complements the blueberry and blackberry liqueur notes. It’s big, but long and fine; a well-made Tannat that shows what the variety can do.”—James TidwellWinery details In 2007, Bending Branch co-owner and winemaker Robert Young, a physician interested in the health benefits of red wine, chose Tannat, a deep-purple grape with high levels of antioxidants, as a focus for the winery. Established in 2009, Bending Branch sits on 56 scenic acres near the…\n\nRecommendation Engines, by Michael Schrage, MIT Press, 2020 I don’t set much store by the endless stream of recommendations offered by Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, and most other online businesses. Occasionally, a book, flick, or song pops up that delights me, but most of the suggestions I get either miss the mark or appear suspiciously advantageous to recommendation engine operators and their advertisers. Michael Schrage, visiting fellow at the MIT Sloan School of Management’s Initiative on the Digital Economy and s+b contributor, awakens us to the potential of delightful discovery in his latest book, Recommendation Engines. “Recommendation inspires innovation: that serendipitous suggestion — that surprise — not only changes how you see the world, it transforms how you see — and understand — yourself. Successful recommenders promote discovery of the world and one’s self,”…\n\nBusiness leaders who persevered through a trying 2020 got some affirming news when Edelman released its latest Trust Barometer in January. Not only is business, for the first time, the most trusted institution in the world, it also is the only institution seen as both competent and ethical. To be sure, the doubts about government, nongovernmental organizations, and the media reflected in this year’s Barometer are nothing to celebrate. But there’s also no doubt that today’s trust dynamics create an opportunity — and a responsibility in many cases — for business leaders to take tough stands on issues that affect society. One critical priority: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). While many in the business community have been focusing on DEI for several years, the data indicates there’s still plenty of room…\n\nYou probably remember her. It was 2012 or so and this high school girl from the New York City suburbs started popping up at pro meets and beating athletes 10 years older. Her post-race interviews were peppered with giggles, appearances by her stuffed duck Puddles, and updates on her AP Latin exam and impending driver’s license test. She was everything you’d expect from a brainy teen who also happened to run abnormally fast. Mary Cain, now 25, was the next big thing for U.S. track and field. Spectators were drawn to her talent, as well as her exuberance. But when her talent outgrew what her high school could support, it got serious. Alberto Salazar—the Nike Oregon Project coach who had watched her set an American high-school record in the 1500 meters…\n\nFROM A SLOW, QUIET TREK IN THE WOODS to a heart-pumping climb atop a bluff (or maybe even a break-the-trail run!), exploring the season’s sparkling white landscapes by snowshoe is an ideal way to embrace winter. Here are three of our favorite adventures. The adventure: Walk or run this month’s Bigfoot Snowshoe 10K & 5K, taking place Jan. 29 on the east side of Traverse City.

Richmond’s keen eye and passion for the historic landscape and lifestyle of the North—from lakeside Victorian cottages to rustic cabins and farmhouses—shape his designs. The results are homes that blend exquisitely into their sites, while offering all the amenities his clients desire to live their best Up North lives. “I have always looked toward the vernacular in architecture as inspiration for my work: in the natural, in the manmade, in the cultural, in anything that defines the origin of a place.

But Vadim Sherbakov (vadimsherbakov.com) wasn’t going to let anything – or anybody – get in the way of this wonderful shot from the Rialto Bridge in Venice. “I have seen many images of and from this bridge, so I wanted to take something different. I went to the spot before sunset in the hope of some great golden hour light. “Fighting an army of tourists to get to the spot I wanted, placing the tripod and guarding the camera wasn’t easy. Anybody who has been there and tried to take a decent photo will understand the struggle! The epic sunset I had in mind never…\n\nDESPITE THE FACT THAT PATTY Horoho took her first breath on an Army base, and that her dad was part of the Greatest Generation and a three-time war veteran, and despite her upbringing in Fayetteville — one of the most military-friendly cities in the country — she laughs when you ask her whether joining the armed forces was a foregone conclusion. “It wasn’t at all!” she says with a chuckle. “Think about it: When I was in high school, women did a couple of things. They were secretaries, teachers, or nurses.” They were not typically soldiers. When Horoho graduated from E.E. Smith High School in 1978, it had only been 11 years since the law capping women at 2 percent of the enlisted forces had been lifted. So Horoho considered the slim…\n\nBILTMORE ASHEVILLE The Biltmore Blooms event kicks off in April with a showstopper in the Walled Garden: thousands of tulips. The flowers — thought to be a nod to the Vanderbilts’ Dutch heritage — have been a springtime tradition since at least 1922. Each November, Biltmore’s horticulture team plants around 96,000 bulbs estate-wide that transform into resplendent blooms throughout April. The tulips range from deep purple to fiery orange to buttery yellow, creating a magnificent rainbow — one close enough for guests to see each layered detail.

The rain fly hangs limp over the front door of the tent, ready for us to insert the poles to give it some structure. I look down at the table in front of me, where not just two, but three sets of disassembled poles lie in a heap. There’s an extra one. Somewhere in the process of setting up the tent, we missed a step. “Didn’t this happen last time?” I ask my mom, holding up the extra poles. Her face falls. “Oh, no!” she says, picking up the fly to look at the tent underneath. “Those are supposed to go through the front of the tent.” My mind flashes back to the last time we went camping together. That time, we realized our mistake before we staked down the…"
