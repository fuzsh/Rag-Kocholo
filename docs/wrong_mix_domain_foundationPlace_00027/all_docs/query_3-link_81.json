        "text": "I have upgraded from Eagle v7.7 to v9.2. After some challenging hours with license activation, I have Premium Eagle 9.2 running on Windows 7 (and another machine windows 10). I have several years of Eagle experience and when I try to do a group move, the right click context menu does not appear. When I move the mouse a round and keep testing right click-ability, eventually I get the full context menu which when 'move' is selected moves the single 'thing' closest, NOT the selected group. I have tried this on several updated schematics and board layouts as well as a new fresh design.\n\nDid this feature get replaced? Is there some new gyration necessary? I have googled and searched the yawning chasm of the autodesk knowledge network. The help files dont seem to help either.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nThom\n\nSolved! Go to Solution.\n\nThanks for the pointer to Options -> Set -> Misc and the checkbox about \"Group command default\" needing to be unchecked. That does restore the GROUP select and MOVE (as well as other GROUP commands). Thanks!\n\nI would be interested to understand the procedure for a GROUP MOVE with the check box checked... There must have been a motivation for changing the behavior of the tool, and the new way appears to be so simple I'm not able to figure it out with trial and error and reading the help file.\n\n@Anonymous wrote:\n\nI would be interested to understand the procedure for a GROUP MOVE with the check box checked... There must have been a motivation for changing the behavior of the tool, and the new way appears to be so simple I'm not able to figure it out with trial and error and reading the help file.\n\nThe motivation was to satisfy requests from a very vocal minority of users who insisted a different way was better. You haven't missed anything, the \"new\" way is just horrible hence everybody who knows how to use EAGLE turns that option right back off again\n\nBest Regards,\n\nRachael\n\nHi,\n\nI might be running into something similar... How do I move a group in the MacOS version of Eagle? After defining a group, both ctrl+click (suggested here) and right click and drag (suggested in the help file) just bring up the context menu. Changing the group command default setting doesn't seem to make a difference. I must be missing something...\n\nHi @carlJTW5Q,\n\nIt should be a left click and drag. Make sure that you click on one of the items of the group, otherwise it won't drag.\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I can do for you.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n​Jorge Garcia\n\n​Product Support Specialist for Fusion 360 and EAGLE\n\nKudos are much appreciated if the information I have shared is helpful to you and/or others.\n\nDid this resolve your issue? Please accept it \"As a Solution\" so others may benefit from it."
