What would be the considerations and/or caveats you'd communicate to your stakeholders?Write at least a couple sentences of your thoughts in a string assigned to the variable answer_to_9.The cell below should look something like this:answer_to_9 = '''I think that based on the visualization that ****.Therefore I would communicate with the stakeholders that ****'''answer_to_9 = '''Based on the visualization, it appears that certain product categories are more popular in each product line. For the 'cat' product line, the most popular categories are X, Y, and Z, while for the 'dog' product line, the most popular categories are A, B, and C. Therefore, I would communicate to the stakeholders that focusing on these popular categories could potentially increase sales. However, it's important to consider that this data only shows the quantity of products sold, not the profit generated from each sale. It's possible that less popular categories could be more profitable due to higher prices or lower costs. Additionally, this data is historical and may not accurately predict future trends. Market conditions, customer preferences, and other factors can change over time. Regularly reviewing sales data and adjusting the product strategy accordingly would be a prudent approach.'''

Why are experimental methods better to measure advertising effectiveness than observational methods?In experimental methods you have more control over how similar the different groups are that will be compared to evaluate resultsYou need less budget for experimental methods.Both methods don’t really differ. What could the effect be of using ITT (Intention to Treat) on the incremental impact of your campaign results?Result remains the sameThe incremental impact you observe may be lower. There are two parts to experiment results, the number of incremental results from your treatment and what else?A winnerA measure of confidence in the resultsA report output Week 4: Optimizing Your Marketing Mix PRACTICE QUIZ: MARKETING MIX MODELING Your manager is asking you to put a report together that shows how much incremental sales was generated by the TV campaign you ran last quarter and she also wants to know how that compares to the money that you invested in ads on Facebook during that same time. Which would be the best metric to highlight in your report:Cost per AcquisitionReturn on Investment (ROI)Customer Lifetime Value Which of the following are typical outputs of a MMM?An overview of which of my TV ad creatives worked best in the past year.Marginal return associated with each marketing channel.An overview of how my spending in different marketing channels contributed to success.A report that provides detail on how much influence each of your marketing activities had on sales. For which of the following questions could a marketer use a Marketing Mix Model to get the answer:Which ad creative performed best in my holiday ad campaign on Facebook?What was the ROI of my fall TV campaign I ran last year?What would the influence be on sales if I doubled the budget I spend on Instagram Stories next year?What would happen to sales if we increase the price of our product? Marketing Mix Modeling is an interaction between a team of modelers and an econometric model. What is the role of the team of modelers?Come up with a set of variables that may affect sales and iterate on these variables until a robust model is achieved for the particular company in question and the KPI they are trying to modelAcquire data for a set number of variables that they know always influence sales in a similar wayAdvise marketers on how to effectively create ads to build successful campaigns Imagine you are working in the marketing department of a restaurant chain and your manager asks you to provide management with a monthly report that provides an update on the effect of each of the media channels used by your company on sales volume. What would be your best response?I can provide you with an estimate of the ROI for every media channel based on our monthly spending. And, every 6 months, I will include an update on the actual effect the different channels had on our sales.Of course, I will re-run our MMM monthly so we can include the results in the report.

DATA ANALYTICS METHODS FOR MARKETING FINAL QUIZ For this final project, we are going to follow James at Snackwall. James launched Snackwall a year ago, and so far, it’s been a real success. Now, James is eager to expand his audience and he is preparing to give his manager an overview of the past year’s success and ask for an advertising budget to help him grow the business.James knows that going to his boss with a solid plan will help to convince him to allocate marketing budget to the expansion of Snackwall.As a starting point, James identifies the segments that he should focus on for his advertising campaign. After all, James knows that it would not be a good use of his money to market to everyone. James relies on K-means clustering, using last year’s data on business size and amount spent for Snackwall clients. James worked with Alya, his analyst, and together they ran several iterations of their K-means clustering. Now they are using the chart below to determine the number of clusters James should focus on in his campaign.Meta Marketing Analytics Chart 1 – SnackwallHow many segments do you suggest James defines for his marketing campaign based on this plot?2 Clusters3 Clusters1 Cluster4 Clusters Based on the K-means clustering, James found 3 clusters that seem to define his current client base. Since James used the dollar amount spent and the business size as the starting variables for his cluster analysis, he knows that the segments are quite distinct in terms of these variables.Meta Marketing Analytics – K-means clusteringHow would you define Cluster 1?None of these are trueSmall businesses that spend a medium amount.Medium businesses that spend little.Large businesses that spend a little. James decides that he should focus on the third cluster for his marketing campaign. He believes this segment has more potential, because he has seen from his previous campaign that it is a little harder to convince large businesses to subscribe. After the profiling exercise, he decides to call the segment the ‘Health conscious startups’ to help other people understand and remember this segment.Next, James turns to showing his management that the advertising budget he was given last year was money well spent. So, James calculates the Return on Ad Spend for last year, and he looks at ROAS by cluster.He shows the following results based on the total ad spend last year of $200K. The total revenue generated was $800K. The total cost invested last year was $500K, so the profit for the year for Snackwall was $300K.The ROAS for Snackwall last year was: 400%.The ROAS for Snackwall last year was: 150%.The ROAS for Snackwall last year was: $800K.The ROAS for Snackwall last year was: $200K. James understands that his management will also want to know the ROI for the advertising campaign he ran last year. The equation to calculate ROI is ROI = (net spend / net profit) * 100. True or False?FalseTrue James is hoping to get a substantial advertising budget for next year. To achieve that, he knows that it would help to show the CLTV for his clients. That may help convince management that their investment now will really pay off in the future. But, since James only launched Snackwall a year ago, it is going to be difficult to show CLTV. The problem is the value of the Customer Retention Period. True or False?FalseTrue James decides to estimate the retention period for his clients. He believes that he can keep a client for 3.5 years, which is similar to the retention period for the cleaning subscription side of his business. With this in mind, what is the CLTV for Snackwall if the following is true:Average order value = $1800Average number of orders per year = 9Profit Margin = 63%$3,717,000$35,721$258.125$10,629 Finally, for his budget presentation, James showed the following chart from a linear regression analysis he ran, evaluating the influence of advertising spending on sales, based on last year’s experience. What does this chart help James prove?Meta Marketing Analytics – Linear Regression AnalysisThere is a positive correlation between advertising spending and sales, and R2 suggests that we can be confident that our data fit this result.There is a positive correlation between advertising spending and sales in 93.5% of the casesThere is a negative correlation between advertising spending and sales.Sales and advertising spending are 93.5% correlated. James’ management is happy with the progress he made last year, and his presentation was a success. He is given a large advertising budget for the next year, in fact, his budget will now be $250K. James’ manager told him that he trusts he will use the budget well, but that he wants to see that the advertising campaigns James runs are resulting in additional subscriptions.James should plan to run an attribution study. True or False?FalseTrue Before spending any of his budget, James wants to compare the results from all of his different marketing channels over the past year, to see where his budget would make the most impact. What study should James run to analyze the impact of all of his marketing initiatives on sales?A/B TestingRandom Control TrialMarketing Mix ModelAttribution While optimizing the sales process, James creates a visualization to represent the sales funnel.Based on this visualization, which approach should James take to increase subscriptions?This is a reverse funnel, he needs to increase awareness of his product.This funnel is a blocker, he should consider why customers are getting stuck at this stage.This is a tornado funnel, he needs to check out the flow.This is a classic funnel, things are looking healthy, James does not need to change anything in his approach. Based on the K-means clustering, James found 3 clusters that seem to define his current client base. Since James used the dollar amount spent and the business size as the starting variables for his cluster analysis, he knows that the segments are quite distinct in terms of these variables.Meta Marketing Analytics – K-means clusteringHow would you define Cluster 3?Medium businesses that spend a medium amount.Large businesses that spend little.None of these are trueSmall businesses that spend a lot. James understands that his management will also want to know the ROI for the advertising campaign he ran last year. Which of the following formulas should James use to calculate the ROI?ROI = (revenue made from ads / advertising spend) * 100ROI = (net profit / net spend) * 100ROI = (net spend / net profit) * 100ROI = (net profit * net spend) / 100 James is hoping to get a substantial advertising budget for next year.
