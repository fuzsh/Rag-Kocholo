        "text": "Reviewed by Elizabeth Johnson-Young, Associate Professor, University of Mary Washington on 6/14/24\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis text provides excellent coverage of a variety of foundational communication material, subjects, and concepts. Easy to find what you need throughout the book and would serve well for an introductory course as a stand alone text or to be used in part for a variety of courses.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nAccurate information and various viewpoints provided when necessary.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nContent is up to date both in examples used and in the historical portions of the text. The chapter on new media covers a variety of content and can likely continue to be used even as we move to other forms of new technology and serve as a starting point for understanding context and then for further discussion.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nVery clear with examples and explanations of terminology. Relatable to students in many of courses.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nUses consistent terminology throughout, which makes for ease in understanding.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe modularity of the text is strong. I can easily see, and plan to, using various portions of the text in different classes, from campaigns, to health communication, to seminars when I'd like to cover some media history and theories. It's easy to find the material and chunking it into smaller sections is provided and simple to do.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nStructure is clear and logical from beginning to end. The order makes sense--if one wanted to use the text as is they could and have a great course.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nAll components seem to work well with no errors.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nInclusive, diverse examples and photos.\n\nReviewed by Laura Seroka, Assistant Professor, Berea College on 3/25/24\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThe textbook covers everything that should be standard in an Introduction to Communication textbook. It has basic topics such as identity through communication, media, and foundational info which give a solid base for more specialized upper-level courses in small group communication, interpersonal communication, and rhetoric. More introductory information to prepare for organizational communication and social media would be helpful.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe text is easy to read and contains accurate up-to-date concepts. Some examples are becoming dated, however, they were accurate for when the book was written.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThis book is now becoming dated with examples. The world has changed a great deal since it was published and students are sure to notice the omission of discussions of the rhetoric of former President Trump and current President Biden. Several new social media platforms are out and Twitter is now X making the language clearly dated within this text. There is also new information about microagendasetters and the role of influencers which are now important communication concepts to include. Instructors could still easily use this text, however, they would need to provide updated examples and possibly some additional readings to give current relevancy.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThis is very easy to read and digest and vocabulary terms are clearly labeled, explained and easy to look up again if needed.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThis book meets the standards of other texts, has quality sources, and utilizes a clear epistemology.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe book has good modularity and would be easy to chunk out when creating a schedule. The chapter on Informative/Persusive Speaking is the most challenging due to its length. As many students will be doing each of these speech styles independently, it may help to separate the chapter. However, having it in one chapter means either presentation style could be done first.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nI wish that culture as well as new media were integrated throughout the text rather than assigned to specific chapters. For example, the chapter on culture comes in the middle of the text, after verbal, non-verbal, and interpersonal communication. As culture is deeply embedded in other topics, I think culture coming first or being discussed throughout the text would improve students' knowledge and they way they identify with the text.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI did not have any issues.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI see no blatant errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nAs with many other texts, this text tries to provide inclusivity in examples and end-of-chapter questions. I think my previous comments about including cultural communication throughout would improve this as well as using content from more BIPOC authors.\n\nReviewed by Yejin Shin, Assistant Professor, Northeastern Illinois University on 5/5/23\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis textbook includes important aspects of basic communication courses. Chapter 1 - Introduction to communication studies highlights the history and different forms of communication, which should be the basis of a basic communication course. Overall, the chapters were well-developed in different fields of communication, which can be used for 100-level courses, and encouraging students to take higher-level courses in different areas of communication (e.g., verbal, nonverbal communication, culture and communication, media). One caveat for some instructors - chapters 9-12 focus on public speaking, so if your institution has a separate class for it, it might not be helpful. Overall, good coverage of topics.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nI do not have any problem with the accuracy of the textbook; References were used well, and most were from well-established journals or books. Even though there is a need for an update for better relevance, it is understandable, as it was published in 2016. Besides this issue, I found all the information accurate and provided accurate, effective discussions and exercises at the end of each sub-chapter. The contents were not biased, but the images should represent more diversity.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThis book was published in 2016, and some areas change rapidly (e.g., intercultural communication, gender, new media technologies); some examples or terms should be updated. As this is not an issue of the textbook itself, the instructor can develop supplementary materials to encourage a discussion about \"new\" concepts or examples they experience (e.g., Tiktok, Zoom, gender identity, LGBTQIA), it will actually make the class more engaging.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThis is one of the strengths of the textbook - the writing is not complicated and straightforward, precise for students who have never been exposed to any communication courses. I liked how new or essential terms were in bold and well-defined for the target students. If instructors were using this book for a basic communication course, students would understand the terms and why it is important to understand them as they are explained well with in-depth information or examples.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe text is internally consistent with a logical order; the first chapter is the introduction to communication studies and then provides the different fields in communication. I wish the public speaking chapters (Chapters 9-12) were separated to recognize the differences or more of an application framework, but in general, the terminology and the flow are all consistent. I also found key takeaways at the end of the sub-chapters beneficial for students to understand the sub-chapters separately.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe modularity of this textbook is great - each chapter was divided into small(sub) chapters, which were well divided by the objectives. Each sub-chapter has its learning objectives, so it was clear to readers how each has specific ideas and can be connected well across chapters. For example, it will not be a problem for the instructor to cover Chapter 1.4 (communication apprehension) and Chapter 10.1 (managing public speaking anxiety) together, as this text was easily divisible into smaller chapters.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThis textbook is well-organized. It uses a simple but logical structure; it starts with the history of communication studies and ends with new media. All sub-chapters were also organized well within the frame of the chapter; each highlights the important concepts or ideas, breaking down into at least 3 or 4 sub-chapters.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI had no problem with this textbook's interface. It was user-friendly, and the layout (e.g., picture, different background colors for exercises or key takeaways, \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons on the bottom) was great for focusing on reading. The online version was easy to navigate; hyperlinks worked great for examples or supplemental materials. For example, students could take PRPSA online as the link was provided in Exercises: http://www.jamescmccroskey.com/measures/prpsa.htm. PDF and e-book forms are also available for students who prefer the printed version.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe textbook used effective grammar and was free of grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nGenerally, this textbook is culturally appropriate; it is not offensive. However, as this is a communication course textbook, I think the communication field has strengths in acknowledging and appreciating cultural differences, which is why this needs to be updated. Again, the images, photos, and examples should include more diverse perspectives to enrich what we value.\n\nComments\n\nOverall, this is a good textbook for a basic communication course; it covers a wide variety of topics and fields, and covering them will guide students in which specific area they will consider taking classes at a higher level. It is also easy enough for the gen edu course. If your institution had combined basic communication and public speech courses, this book fits the purpose well. Students will take advantage of it, using different versions at no cost. Some areas need to be developed, such as providing more recent examples or concerns about diversity, but if instructors are prepared for open discussions with students, this book will do fine. One of the great, effective books Open Textbook Library.\n\nReviewed by Pleasant Karen, Adjunct Instructor, Rogue Community College on 3/10/23\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThe textbook covers the key aspects of basic communication and would serve as an excellent resource for students in an introductory course. From the historical elements of communication to current research and trends, the book is comprehensive in its coverage of basic communication pedagogy. Topics range from communication and perception, through verbal and nonverbal communication in a variety of relationships, to small group and media and technology in relation to communication concepts. Several chapters present the basics of public speaking in a variety of contexts as well.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe content seems accurate throughout the textbook, but since it was published in 2016 certain chapters could probably use an update. One such chapter is the one on cultural communication and identity. I feel additional up-to-date information about co-cultures would be pertinent to include in future editions, such as gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political viewpoints, ability/disability, age/generation, and socioeconomic status as well as a discussion about race and ethnicity.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nThe text is relevant and accessible to all levels of students. It contains very realistic and relatable examples and information to keep students interested, including a section of each chapter entitled \"Getting Real.\" . Each chapter begins with learning objectives and ends with key takeaways and exercises. An update is needed for parts of the book since it was published in 2016. One chapter that needs updating is Chapter 15 regarding media, technology, and communication. It would be helpful if it included information about Zoom and online platforms. Periodic updates will insure that the relevance of the textbook continues. In between updates, instructors can supplement the textbook with outside readings, activities, and more. The chapter on communicating in relationships is very relatable and relevant because it discusses the \"Dark Side of Relationships,\"including lying, cheating, and anger issues. This is a topic that I have not encountered in other basic communication textbooks.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe book is written in an easy to follow format with terminology, given in bold, that is well-defined. It might be beneficial to have a glossary of terms. A times, images and diagrams help to clarify the information presented.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe book presents real world applications of the information in each chapter. I like how each chapter follows the same format and starts with learning objectives and ends with takeaways and exercises. This consistency makes it easy for both instructors and students to connect with the information while at the same time allowing instructors various opportunities for innovation in the activities they utilize in the classroom or online.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nReaders can maneuver easily through the chapters and don't need to follow them in order. Each chapter includes foundational information and practical applications. However, I would like to see separate chapters for informative versus persuasive public speaking.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nEach chapter can stand alone and they don't need to be followed in order for students to benefit from the book. As I've previously mentioned the consistency of the chapter organization lends itself well to making the book easy to navigate.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe layout of the book, and each chapter, is user-friendly and easy to access. The book is available in several formats as well, such as e-book, PDF, and more.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI didn't notice any grammatical issues as I perused the book.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nThe relevance of the cultural chapter would improve with the inclusion of information about co-cultures. It is important to keep up-to-date about intercultural and gender communication terms, too.\n\nComments\n\nThe title of the book, Communication in the Real World, is a very appropriate title for this book as it includes so many real and relatable communication issues. I think both college instructors and students would enjoy using this book as their classroom textbook. I am going to adopt it for my Basic Communication class.\n\nReviewed by Ibrahim Yoldash, Adjunct Professor, Prairie State College on 2/8/23\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThe text is very comprehensive, although there is not an in-depth chapter dedicated to ceremonial/commemorative speeches. I did like the sample speeches and topics that were offered within the chapters. I also think that students can benefit from what I consider to be \"additional\" chapters 6-8, 13-16 that focus on subjects that some public speaking textbooks do not. Overall, I think it's very thorough and would be an excellent choice to utilize in the classroom. My only suggestion would be to include a chapter about ceremonial/commemorative speeches.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nFrom what I perused, it is well-written without errors.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nI think relevancy is subjective (\"Aristotle to Obama\" instantly dates this textbook), and too many present references will date the text in the years ahead. This textbook does a good job at staying relevant while maintaining traditional communication pedagogy.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nI feel, that, as educators in higher education, we cannot continue to \"water down\" information to make it \"easier to digest.\" I think it is the student's responsibility to seek guidance if there is something that he/she is having difficulty understanding. This textbook is well-balanced between providing correctly defined terminology while also avoiding being too lofty and overwhelming.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nSome may view this text as organizationally distinct, since it does not address speech organization and preparation until Chapter Nine; yet I find it appropriate in giving students the necessary foundation of communication history, concepts, and its applications before having them begin on speech presentations.\n\nModularity rating: 4\n\nPerhaps Chapter Eleven could be divided into two separate chapters, one with Informative Speaking and the other with Persuasive Speaking. It is a very lengthy chapter, and I think students may benefit from separating the two.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nEven though the chapters do somewhat build upon one another, I feel that they are also standalone in the sense that you do not necessarily need to understand the chapter unless you have read all of the ones before it (like its own self-contained unit).\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI haven't had any issues with this.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nAgain, I haven't noticed any grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nIt does a good job of being objective by presenting information from a neutral standpoint instead of trying to take sides of an issue, historically or otherwise.\n\nComments\n\nI would see no reason why this textbook shouldn't be used by many educators in this area of study.\n\nReviewed by Brian Healy, Lecturer, Metropolitan State University of Denver on 11/26/22\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis book is an excellent foray into Communication Studies. Communication in the Real World runs the gamut from Intrapersonal Communication to Mass Communication while presenting content that reflects historical and current research trends. This textbook provides the reader with myriad opportunities for entrance into Communication theory. This book is acceptable for fundamental courses while also maintaining relevance as a companion reader to higher-level courses in communication. It is an excellent resource for any student moving through the discipline.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nI find the book to be relatively accurate throughout. The foundational Communication theories are helpful and connected to the reader's lived experiences. However, I believe there are a few Intercultural Communication and Gender Communication terms that could use a touch-up and reexamination. This is to be expected as the cultural milieu changes over time, and I look forward to future iterations as the text continues to grow and develop.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nThe text, as a whole, speaks to the student well while maintaining its academic and terminological integrity. The overarching communication principles are presented in ways that are as relevant today as they were when I first learned them. As commented above, as the world shifts and our experiences and understandings deepen, so will the text, hopefully.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe writing in this textbook is accessible for all level students while maintaining an intellectual acuity. In addition, the terms are interconnected throughout the text allowing the student to grasp the more important terms, ideas, and theories at play as a whole. Each bold term presented is clear and well-defined.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe text follows an evident organizing pattern that makes referencing the text in class easy for students to recognize. The text also makes each important term bold so that the student can easily identify the key terms for each section.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nWith clear headings and short, consumable chapter sections, this text makes reading assignments comprehensible. Students can maneuver through each chapter section by section with ease.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe text is traditional in its information organization, from foundational communication theories in the first few chapters to practical applications in the latter chapters. This step-by-step style allows for a clearer understanding of how communication forms, shapes, and maintains our relationships with others in the myriad relationships students encounter.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe layout of this text is easily accessible and intuitive. Working through the text, the terms, supplemental images, and references are clear and easily discernible.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe text is grammatically clear and consistent.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nThis text provided a snapshot of the cultural time when it was compiled. As with any text in this ever-evolving and changing world, there are aspects like technological use and identity markers that will need updating soon and could use the support of more research as it becomes available.\n\nComments\n\nAfter implementing this text in my class, students' responses have been very positive. I find the application of this text within differing web-based learning management systems to be a game changer as an instructor. My students have one space they need to go to read and do their homework, each working synergistically with the other. This text creates many opportunities for innovation in the classroom.\n\nReviewed by Michele Mahi, Assistant Professor, Leeward Community College on 3/11/22\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nCommunication in the Real World is a comprehensive textbook for an introductory communication course. The textbook includes the standard topics addressed in typical 100-level speech courses. Something this textbook lacks is an index or glossary; however, I did not find this to be an issue.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe content reflects current communication research. This textbook provides a nice introduction to major communication concepts, theories, and principles and provides a solid foundation for class discussions and activities. I found the content to be error-free and unbiased.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThis textbook was published in 2016, so an update with more contemporary examples would be nice. For instance, I think Chapters 15 and 16 (media, technology, communication) could use an update. A lot has changed in 6 years. However, instructors can easily develop supplementary materials with contemporary examples to increase relevancy for their students.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe writing of this textbook is clear and concise. All course terminology is properly explained.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is consistent in terms of terminology and framework. Additionally, I appreciated the consistent layout of each chapter. I liked how each chapter opened with the learning objectives and closed with key takeaways and exercises. I also liked how each chapter included a section that addressed real-world applications.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nCommunication in the Real World is divided into chapters with multiple sections. Instructors can obtain links for the entire textbook, specific chapter, or even specific sections within each chapter. I appreciated this functionality. I liked that the textbook is divisible and customizable. In addition to allowing instructors to choose with sections they address, instructors can easily reorder the sections to their liking.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nThe textbook uses a clear and consistent organizational pattern for each chapter. However, I think informative speaking and persuasive speaking should have been separate chapters instead of combined into one chapter. Additionally, I think this textbook would have benefited from an index or glossary.\n\nInterface rating: 4\n\nI found the interface user-friendly. I thought the textbook was easy to navigate. All links worked and I did not experience problems accessing the material. However, I think the textbook could be more visually appealing.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI did not notice any grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nGenerally, I found the textbook culturally appropriate. However, I think the textbook could use benefit from more inclusive examples.\n\nComments\n\nOverall, I think this textbook is an appropriate choice for an introductory communication course.\n\nReviewed by Art Khaw, Professor, Kirkwood Community College on 12/13/21\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThe Communication in the Real World text is an effective textbook for students in two-year programs and introductory communication courses at four-year institutions. Too often, texts try to accomplish too much in one course. This textbook allows for a greater understanding and growth in the discipline of communication studies. One advantage of the text is the assessments, cases, discussion questions and exercises can be accomplished in a semester.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe major content areas are fully covered in an introduction communication studies course. The book is accurate, research-based and up-to-date with communication information supported with citations and references. The communication concepts, principles and theories are accurate which includes relevant sources. The text provides a nice foundation for class discussions and lectures. Sources are referenced at the end of every chapter. The author writes with consistent, inclusive language. There was no evidence of bias or errors that I detected, perhaps more diversity in photographs are encouraged.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nThe textbook includes the necessary content for an introductory communication course. The framework and organizational structure of the text is arranged in a manner that any updates could easily be implemented. Political and social references can easily be updated through contemporary examples and issues in media. Instructors can supplement contemporary information to increase relevance for their students.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nCommunication in the Real World - An Introduction to Communication Studies is a well-written text. The textbook’s approach helps students transfer and apply the skills learned from the text to their future academic and professional environments. In addition, the textbook emphasizes practical application and is written in a manner that is easily understood. The design of the book is inviting. The writing style is reader-friendly and the presentation is appropriate for my students. The major strength of the text is the user-friendly, conversational method/style of the text. I stress the need for my students to become critical consumers of communication, as well as producers, and this text helps with that task.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThere is consistency in the layout of this text. The chapters are consistent in flow, language, organization and structure. Each chapter is arranged in a way that is well-organized. Each section is clearly labeled and begins with Learning Objectives and ends with Key Takeaways, Exercises, and a bibliography (references). I like \"Exercise\" sections where students are given activities and questions to promote application and understanding.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe outline of the book is impressive. The textbook is broken down into logical and manageable sections that could be divided for instructors and students. The text is readily divisible with reading sections and sub- headings that are precise and uncomplicated. The headings of each module provide structure to the text. The text has several headers and sub-headers that are logical and consistent across chapters, as well as \"key takeaways\" at the end of each section. An instructor could easily break down a chapter into smaller assignments for students without causing high levels of confusion. The text is divided into sections that can easily be reordered as desired, and the chapters make sense as arranged in each module. There are no areas with large “sections” of text with an overload of written material that require further subdivision. The learning objectives are implemented with ease and flow.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe book is thoughtfully organized with a clear and simple structure. The textbook is in line with existing Introduction to Communication textbooks. The book nicely aligns with how I already structure my own class. This is an effective book as it will allow you to provide information that consistently builds upon the information before it. Finally, the learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter and the discussion questions and key takeaways at the end assist with applying theory into practical application.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe interface is user-friendly. The textbook exhibits no interface issues. Images, illustrations and pictures are not distorted. They are appropriate and clear. Links are active and in working order at the time of review. Furthermore, illustrations and images add interest and divides lengthy text sections. The text is visually appealing. Navigation was easy and user-friendly. In summary, the book is well constructed and the various formats available are easily accessible to the reader.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe text is thorough and well-written. I did not note any grammatical errors during my review of the text.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nThe book is inclusive and is fairly appealing to all races, ethnicity, and backgrounds. The text is not culturally insensitive or offensive.\n\nComments\n\nStudents of, and practitioners in, the field of communication studies will find this text a valuable learning tool. The work is easy to follow and understand. Also, valuable information and learning arenas are presented. The exercises allow enough opportunity for the mind to expand and the student to become creative. Overall, this is a very good text for students enrolled in an introduction to communication studies course. I highly recommend the text.\n\nReviewed by Madeleine Costa, Adjunct Faculty, Bristol Community College on 6/1/21\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 3 see less\n\nThis book is very thorough and comprehensive as it begins discussing communication since 3500BCE up until today's new media components. It had areas that discussed how students could use this information in specific other courses and in the business world. I thought this was very effective. Each chapter had subsections that delved into the details of the overriding chapter topic. However, I did not see an index nor a glossary. These would have been very helpful if they had been included. I also would have liked an entire chapter written on the informative speeches and demonstration speeches since these are an important parts of my classwork.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nI found the book's topics to be accurately discussed and error-free. It was also unbiased and offered chapters that covered ethics and sensitivity to culture and how to understand, communicate and appreciate diversity at all levels.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nFor the most part this book was very up-to-date. In the past I have had communication books directly quote current USA presidents or other popular political leaders of the time. I didn't see that here as much which in one way would make it less important for updating to more current political times. There was one mention of a popular TV program, law and Order which ended in 2010 so perhaps a more current reference could have been utilized.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nI really enjoyed how clear the writing, chapter divisions and other components of this text were presented. The text provided many interesting features that kept my interest and would also keep the interest of students. There were clear explanations/definitions of terms especially in the chapter on new media. Key new phrases or terms are in bold and followed by definitions and more detailed explanations of the terms. There are also special sections entitled Getting Critical or Getting Competent where personal stories from the author are included to make the information clearer yet. In these sections there are questions for students to think critically about and respond to that would help clarify concepts and their application in various circumstances.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nI like the way that each major chapter is divided into either 3, 4 or one includes 7 sub chapters that delve into more detailed information. Most of the chapters had four sub chapters. This made the book very detailed and comprehensive as mentioned before and the way it was divided into these specific frameworks made it consistent. Each chapter ended with a section called Key Take Aways which I thought was a great review of what the important concepts of the chapter were. Also, the chapters had \"Exercise\" sections where students were given activities and questions to help further their understanding.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nAs mentioned previously, the main chapters had 3, 4, or 7 sub chapters within them. Even these had many section divisions that were clearly indicated by a topic title in bold, larger font letters such as \"Interpersonal Communication\" or \"Intrapersonal Communication\" that would be followed with plenty of detailed information about those highlighted headings. This made the text easy to mentally digest as the smaller, clearly indicated sections were not too lengthy with too many new concepts introduced. I believe these could be easily reorganized and realigned within the course itself.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nI found the book very well organized since it started with the historical background of communication and ended with new media, technology and communication in today's world. You could go to any chapter and be sure that it would be appropriately divided into the various sub chapters and headings that would further explain the major topic. There were 16 chapters that covered a multitude of communication circumstances, usages, situations and strategies that were all clearly and logically laid out for easy student comprehension. Each chapter had colorful photos, images or charts/graphs to further assist in students understanding.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI did not find any interface issues that would distract the student reader.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI did not find any grammatical errors in the text as far as I could see.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nThe book actually had chapters/sub chapters that dealt with handling diversity in audiences, groups and workplaces, so it was culturally sensitive. It had quite a few of the photos and images that included people of color although I think the majority of photos were of white people. The examples that included different ethnicities, races and backgrounds often had to do with actual topics that were covering race, biracial and interracial issues.\n\nComments\n\nI think this would be a great book for a general communication course that dealt with the wide variety of communication types/topics as it provided a very detailed and broad coverage of many areas since 3500 BCE. However, I would not choose this book for my class on Public Speaking since it did not have enough detailed information on the various speeches that I teach, visual aids and components to be used in speech creation and delivery. It did have some of this particularly for the information and persuasive type of speeches, but I do more than those.\n\nReviewed by Nancyruth Leibold, Associate Professor, Southwest Minnesota State University on 5/3/21, updated 6/1/21\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThis textbook is an undergraduate-level textbook that is comprehensive about introductory communication with five primary types: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, public, and mass communication. The contents were precise in the PDF version. The online version had a sidebar that included a clear list of the contents. An index and glossary would improve the comprehensiveness. The learning objectives at the start of each chapter are fabulous.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nThe textbook includes mostly accurate communication information with supporting evidence citations and references. Including more representation of cultures would improve the accuracy.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThe textbook is up to date for the most part. Some of the media communication areas that are quickly evolving in society could use an update. The author could add detailed tips and information about web-based professional interviews and meetings could be added. An overall section about interviews would be helpful.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe Introduction to Communication textbook is clear and well-written.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nTerminology, framework, and navigation are internally consistent in the text.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe format of the chapters throughout the Communication in the Real World: An Introduction to Communication Studies is consistent. Each chapter includes headings with sub-sections to organize the content into easy-to-read chunks of information. Each chapter starts with an introduction, then learning objectives, content, pictures, and ends with key takeaways, exercises, and references.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe topics in the text include a logical presentation. The text consists of a Table of Contents page that is helpful and easy to follow (sidebar on online version and front of text in PDF version). The learning objectives at the start of chapters are fabulous. Vocabulary words in the text are bolded. I like the use of videos per video link. Other strengths are the key takeaways, exercises, and references at the end of each chapter. Tables, images, and figures used are helpful to communicate the information.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe text is free of significant interface issues, including navigation problems, distortion of images/charts, and any other display features that may distract or confuse the reader. The links were all in working order.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 4\n\nThe text does include passive voice diction and split infinitives. Some nouns lack a determiner. However, writing styles vary from one discipline to another.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nCultural responsive pedagogy is an area for improvement. Some of the references to gender and race are less personal in the text than perhaps in reality. The images used of people are biased as most are of White people. Revising the text with the incorporation of a diverse mix of people in photos is a suggestion.\n\nComments\n\nCommunication in the Real World: An Introduction to Communication Studies is overall a good introductory textbook. Increasing the images to be diverse would improve the book overall. Many thanks for the work to create this text!\n\nReviewed by Scott Makstenieks, Instructor, Winona State University on 11/11/20\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nFor any institution or educator looking for a textbook that covers both communication theory and skill-building, this book is an excellent resource. Beyond the initial discussions of communication as a concept and phenomenon, the text covers various forms and contexts of communication that are necessary content in an introductory communication studies course.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nOn the whole, the material in each chapter is clearly drawn from established communication research and theory. Quite obviously, as communication technologies and cultures change, some aspects of the material may need to be supplemented in class discussions or through supplemental readings. Likewise, chapter 8.2 (in the Culture and Communication section) is a bit problematic in its discussion of race, gender, sexuality, and ability, mainly in terms of its causal logics. In other words, the chapter seems to make an essentialist claim - race is itself a cultural identity, rather than being a product of culture (or discursively shaped by culture).\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nAs noted above, the textbook covers a wide breadth of communicative forms and contexts, making it relevant for students, irrespective of the major or career trajectory. Likewise, the sections on mass communication do address the evolution of media, along with a sense of old versus new media technologies, but some minor updates in response to new trends may be helpful for students. In terms of public speaking skills, the textbook does include a section on speaking on radio and television that can be adapted to discussions about speeches and interviews via Zoom and other online platforms.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is certainly accessible to a range of learners, using vocabulary that retains complexity without losing conceptual integrity. In various ways, diagrams and images throughout the chapters often help to illustrate basic concepts, and sample outlines/speeches are provided in the later sections on public speaking.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nEach chapter is structured well and organized in a consistent manner, generally begin with broad concepts and then covering more specific topics or theories. Chapters then end with clear summaries and discussion questions for class prompts or for homework.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is exceptionally divisible into a weekly or even daily units, and the subdivisions within chapters allows instructors to take a deep dive into a topic area (assigning all sections of a chapter) or lets them introduce basic concepts quickly (assigning only the first one or two chapter sections).\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe organization of the textbook fit perfectly into the flow of my introductory communication studies course, splitting the semester into one half about theory and topics and the second half about public speaking skill-building. Within those sections, the structure makes sense as broad concepts first and then specific topics (or speaking genres) second.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI have only used the pdf version of the textbook, but the integrity of the document seemed perfect - text is clear, and images are not pixelated. The table of contents is also dynamic, allowing readers to click on page numbers and jump to sections of the textbook (without scrolling through entire document manually). Other versions of the text are available on the U of MN OER page, which would seem to allow for even greater functionality as well.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo grammar errors noticed.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nAs noted above, the chapter 8.2 section does have some potentially confusing or problematic discussion of race, gender, sexuality, and ability. However, throughout the textbook, it is clear that the author(s) is trying to include context and culture as a significant factor in human communication. The 8.2 section also seems to be intended to give time to these important identity positions, but it needs some revision or some class discussion to clarify the complexity of these subjects.\n\nReviewed by Amber Worthington, Assistant Professor of Communication, University of Alaska Anchorage on 10/21/20, updated 1/10/21\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis book provides a great overview of many areas of communication. I use this book for an introductory communication course that covers interpersonal communication, public speaking, and small group communication. This book also covers more introductory areas including, for example, culture and communication, leadership, and media/technology and communication. I am not sure if there is an index/glossary, but the Table of Contents page is very easy to follow and navigate.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nI believe most of the content in this textbook is accurate.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nI think the textbook uses relevant and up-to-date examples. Any necessary updates can be included as additional examples, and I also think the text is organized in a way that will allow easy and straightforward updates to content areas as well.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nI think the text is written clearly and in a way that is accessible to students.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nI believe the textbook is internally consistent and follows a consistent framework and use of communication terminology.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nI think the textbook does a great job dividing the sections into smaller subsections and so on. I assign many different subsections to my students, which I think works really well with this text. I think it is especially easy to navigate to different subsections when reading the textbook online. The PDF version of the textbook is somewhat more difficult to navigate to particular sections, but it is not too complicated and a simple \"search\" is often effective to jump to the correct section in the PDF.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nI like the way the textbook is organized. I do, however, have my students read some chapters of the textbook out of order to align with my particular course, but I think that works quite well.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI have not had any problems with this. Students also seem to like the book and have not had any interface or navigation problems.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI have not found any major grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nI think the examples in the text could include more examples that integrate diversity, but, generally speaking, I think the text does a good job covering culture and communication.\n\nComments\n\nI think this is a great book for an introductory communication class.\n\nReviewed by Carleen Yokotake, Professor of Speech, Leeward Community College on 6/25/20\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThe book does an excellent job covering all areas of the subject matter except for Interviewing. Interviewing is an important aspect of dyadic communication and taught in our Speech courses as one of several important communication skills. Interviewing is only briefly covered in section 9.1 and in the context of finding sources. I would love for the author to include more robust and comprehensive coverage of this concept.\n\nThe history of communication in the first chapter was a little longer than necessary, albeit very informative.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nOverall great content! The communication principles, theories, and concepts are very accurate. However, the pictures used throughout do suggest a strong bias toward white people and this is extremely problematic.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nWhile the concepts covered are relevant and timeless, some of the research does need to be updated. Since technology continues to rapidly evolve, more current research needs to be included as far as how current technological trends, especially social media, etc... continues to shape our interactions and ultimately, our relationships. The text is written and arranged in a way that any updates could definitely be easy to implement/insert.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThis is a well-written book. It is very easy to read and many important communication concepts are explained very clearly!\n\nConsistency rating: 4\n\nFor the most part terminology and framework contain appropriate text consistent with the topic area. I do think the Motivated Sequence Pattern did not belong in the section on organizing your main points. I consider that to be an organizational structure in and of itself.\n\nModularity rating: 4\n\nOverall the text is divisible into appropriate reading sections, although there are some sections that are a bit too long. However, what I really like about the way the text is organized is that some concepts covered in other chapters include a direct link to the chapter the concept is discussed in. I love that!\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nThe chapters tended to be a bit long even though the topics were presented in a logical and clear manner. It was very helpful that the author included section breaks via key takeaways and exercises.\n\nInterface rating: 4\n\nFor the most part all text are presented clearly. However, there were some important concepts covered that got a bit \"buried.\" Perhaps those concepts can be highlighted/bolded. For example in section 1.2 under \"Communication is a Process,\" principles such as, communication messages vary in terms of their, \"level of conscious thought and intention, communication is irreversible, and unrepeatable,\" should all be in bold. This would make it easier to read the larger patches of text that include important terms.\n\nAnother area that could be adjusted a bit is in section 9.3 Organizing. All of the headings are the same size thus making it a little confusing and or difficult to distinguish sub points. It would be helpful the chance font sizes of headings to distinguish sub headings more clearly.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo problems here.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 1\n\nFor the most part the content in the text reflect inclusivity of a variety of cultures. However, most of the pictures throughout the entire book are only of white people and should be updated and/or changed. One picture in particular in section 1.1 under the Group Communication heading, should be updated/changed. The picture shows a group of all white men and women and can be seen as biased especially given the recent events surrounding the death of George Floyd. I recommend changing this picture to reflect a more diverse group of individuals. This same issue is found in section 1.3 under the heading \"Academic\" there is a picture of three white men in regalia suggesting only white people pursue higher education. In subsequent chapters whether showing a classroom full of students or two people interacting, most of the pictures are of white people. Pictures of people of other ethnicities were grossly outnumbered. This really should be mitigated/updated.\n\nComments\n\nI really like the \"Key Takeaways\" sections, it helps draw students back to the important points made in the chapter. The \"Exercise\" sections are also very helpful to stimulate class discussion or self reflection.\n\nWhile it was helpful that the author included links to chapters that covered concepts more in depth, there was a tendency to cover more information than necessary when introducing a concept that was covered more comprehensively in another chapter. For example, in Chapter one, the concept of compliance gaining was introduced. Instead of listing the common tactics used for compliance gaining in this section, a one sentence definition along with the link to Chapter 11 would have been sufficient.\n\nOverall, a great textbook, well done!\n\nReviewed by Brenden Kendall, Associate Professor, Metropolitan State University of Denver on 3/6/20\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 2 see less\n\nSubjects within the text are covered well, though the author is not particularly clear about the scope of their major sections (and reasons for those choices). Put another way, the text is framed as a neutral account of the field, when of course no text can provide a wholly complete account.\n\nThe text does not engage the major subfield of organizational communication in any way. Group and team communication are covered well enough. But the area of organizational communication is an obvious and serious omission. There are whole majors, disciplinary interest groups, conferences, and international/trans-disciplinary subjects in organizational communication.\n\nNo index, glossary, or cross-tabulation is available.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nThe text is accurate in what it covers, highlighting and spending appropriate time with emphasized content.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 1\n\nWhat is covered in this text is covered accurately and in a conversational, student-friendly style appropriate to the level of course for which this text is intended. Significant, long-standing ideas are addressed.\n\nThe trouble here is that the references that form the basis of the text are quite outdated. Certainly, textbooks are not encyclopedias or literature reviews, but the major concepts and theories addressed are “classics” up until about 2000. I write this in 2020. As such, the text is somewhat imprecise when it comes to representing contemporary views on communication dynamics – the perspective is not consistent with some major recent disciplinary shifts. I think here of constitutive views on organizational discourse, representations of gender and transgender dynamics, etc.\n\nThat this text’s subsequent editions are in print with a for-profit publisher means it’s unlikely to be made more relevant or current anytime soon, nor very easily.\n\nClarity rating: 3\n\nFor a text to be clear at the basic level, I use Gerald Nosich’s SEE-I model for critical thinking: State, Explain, Exemplify, and Illustrate. This textbook varies in the degree to which it offers these elements of conceptual presentation and exploration. It is thus moderately good in terms of clarity. Some notes:\n\nState: the book provides clear definitions, useful highlighting of significant concepts. Subsections are of greatly varying lengths, however. This provides some confusion when it comes to which parts of the text deserve students’ greatest attention, because these differences in length seem to be relevant to the author’s interest rather than the import to the reader.\n\nExplain: I’ll note again the unevenness of the depth of attention to certain passages or ideas. Some concepts are bolded in passing, though important, and some receive detailed explanation. Not all things deserve the equal attention, sure, but these discrepancies seem problematic in the case of this book.\n\nExemplify: examples are often personal, interesting, and vivid. An update would deepen the range of examples regarding persons’ identities and lived experience (e.g., according to race, gender, socio-economic status, etc.).\n\nIllustrate: the text is clear and concrete, but does not go much beyond the standard illustrative writing of the textbook genre: the extended story at the outset or closing of the chapter. Give students metaphors, more lively diagrams, media references… any creative analogy!\n\nConsistency rating: 1\n\nThe most obvious example of problematic consistency is at the highest level, chapter organization. The media chapter addresses technology, and yet there’s also a chapter on “new” media and technologies. The team and group chapter covers some ‘workplace’ issues, but no chapter is presented on organizational communication, where there is more depth on this subject. Rhetoric isn’t present in a big way. And so forth. The content, overall, has little balance.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nBecause of the text's frequent use of subsections, this book can be remixed and rearranged quite readily at both granular and broad levels.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 1\n\nNope. The book articulates no specific logic or plan for the organization, and offers little in the way of bridging elements of the book. But, as noted in the modularity section, the book can be usefully chopped up in this format.\n\nInterface rating: 4\n\nThe book is easy enough to read, print, etc. The use of learning objectives for minor sections, combined with its formatting can make for odd on-line reading, with movement between sub-sections sometimes feeling like transitions between chapters. On the whole, the format works and the price is right!\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 4\n\nEditing seems thorough and writing is generally effective. The text assumes both a familiar, colloquial voice and a more authoritative voice in different parts. This can make for a feeling of disjuncture re: being addressed as a reader. But this is a minor issue.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nThe text is culturally appropriate and includes important concepts in this area through 2010 or so. But concrete examples or example fictional narratives rarely engage lived experiences of persons of color, low socio economic status, and similar kinds of common marginalization. Narrative examples are often reserved for a more generic kind of concept, an attempt at normalization and generalization that can in a subtle way reinforce hegemonic depictions of communication. The book is not offensive or condemnation-worthy on this point, but it's limited.\n\nComments\n\nThis textbook should be used with complementary materials (e.g., borrowed chapters from other textbooks) in any class, especially for covering areas of significant omission relevant to the \"intro course\" in Communication Studies.\n\nReviewed by Thomas Townsend, Lecturer, East Tennessee State University on 10/31/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThe text is comprehensive within its publishing date. It covers the basics of Communication Studies and two chapters of Mass Communication.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nThe book is accurate. My only point of contingency was in the sample outlines which do not include traditional outlining with Roman numerals. As we would use the text i a first year gen. ed course, were we to teach that tradiaonl outlining message, we would need to redo the examples.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThe text through 2016 is updated and relevant. In addressing the change in mediated communication from 2016, the text is obviously silent as it had not been written yet. Instructors hoping to address contemporary issues with social media, particularly in relation to current events, will need to supplement their course.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe book is clear, well-organized, and clear. Terms are well defined and presented succinctly. The chapter reviews are particularly helpful to readers.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe author(s) has written a text that reads the same from chapter to chapter. The information is equally accessible throughout. The organization of the \"getting real,\" \"key takeaways,\" and \"exercises\" reinforce the well-written chapters and engage the readers.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe modularity of the book makes using only selected chapters easy for instructors for adapting to any course.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nThe organization on the whole. The only drawback in organization is found in the chapters on public speaking. In the author's defense, I find the same issue with most beginning communication textbooks in that the way the public speaking chapters are included is a bit jarring I have no suggestion on how to avoid it.\n\nInterface rating: 4\n\nThe textbook exhibits no significant interface issues. The charts and images are not distorted. The images are appropriate and clear.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is well-written. I found no grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nThe author puts forward efforts towards making the text inclusive. The chapter on culture reinforces the tone of the text. Cultural competence is a theme of the text.\n\nComments\n\nI am recommending us to replace our current text with this one.\n\nReviewed by Tim Ball, Associate Professor, James Madison University on 7/24/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThe textbook does cover all areas and ideas that are appropriate for an introductory human communication course (e.g., the communication process, perception, culture, verbal and nonverbal communication, listening, interpersonal and relationship communication, and public speaking). Chapters 14 and 15 focus on mass communication topics, so we would not include them in the version we would make available to our students. The textbook does have a table of contents, but I did not find a back-of-the-book index or a glossary of terms.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nFor the most part, the textbook is accurate and free of overt bias. However, I found some errors. For example, in 9.4 (Outlining) of Chapter 9, the speech outline examples were not formatted correctly. Roman numerals (which identify the main points), capital letters (which identify sub-points), and lower case letters (which identify supporting details) were missing. The outline examples only used Arabic numerals. This is an important error because my students do not know how to create an outline for their speeches. I can make those formatting changes, but I wish I did not have to.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nTextbook content is generally up-to-date, but some sections are already obsolete. For example, 1.1 (Communication: History and Forms) provides a brief history of communication from Aristotle to President Obama. President Trump’s use of Twitter to communicate directly with the American public is new and needs to be acknowledged and addressed if we are going to use this textbook for years to come.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe prose throughout the textbook is accessible and the author provides adequate context for any jargon or technical terminology used. Accessibility is important in an introductory human communication textbook because we do not want to turn off the students with ideas and concepts that are not understandable because of jargon or technical terms.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nOverall, the text framework demonstrates an agreement or harmony of parts/features to one another. For example, every chapter has at least four sub-sections in which the author describes the main idea of the chapter in detail. Not every introductory textbook author does this.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nEach chapter includes at least four smaller reading sections. Each section can be edited for length, easily reorganized, and realigned without too much trouble.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nThe topics in the textbook are arranged in a logical fashion. The communication fundamentals, interpersonal communication, public speaking, small group communication, and new media chapters are grouped together. I would rearrange the order somewhat by placing the culture chapter with the other fundamentals chapters.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nI did not find any significant interface issues. Navigation was easy and no images or charts were distorted. In short, I did not find any features that may distract or confuse readers.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 4\n\nFor the most part, the textbook does not contain any grammatical errors. I did not find subject-verb agreement errors, sentence fragments, misplaced or dangling modifiers, vague pronoun references, or incorrect word usage. Occasionally, I would find a missing comma after an introductory element or a missing comma in a compound sentence.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nI believe this introductory textbook is culturally sensitive and not offensive in any way. The examples used, especially those in the cultural communication chapter, are inclusive of a variety of races, ethnicities, and backgrounds.\n\nComments\n\nI wish that the references and the in-text citations of sources were written according to the American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines, but they are not. I want students to include references in APA style, but I cannot point to references in the textbook as examples. I can make those changes, but it adds to the workload.\n\nReviewed by Robert Jersak, Faculty Instructor, Communication Studies, Century College on 6/21/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nCommunication in the Real World is fairly comprehensive. In eighteen chapters, interpersonal, intercultural, small group, leadership and media dynamics in our field are introduced discussed in beginning-level depth. That’s quite a breadth of topics for a single text.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nCrucial COMM concepts are included for each sub-discipline and highlighted within the text, and a citation often follows immediately to give readers a sense of the origin of that particular concept. Discussions of these ideas are often useful and applicable to real life. Even if readers are less-than-captivated by the text itself, this would still be a resource for exploring these core concepts further through other assigned activities.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 3\n\nThe text is general enough to give an overview of ideas that aren't tied exclusively to current events. However, any text that addresses communication through mediated channels will need frequent updating as research catches up with the impact of social media channels. As my needs for this text pertain to Interpersonal Communication, I spent less time reviewing Chapter 15. However, the timelines featured for different mediated channels may be useful in providing historical context for those being introduced to mass media.\n\nClarity rating: 3\n\nLucid, yes. The book is competently written. But accessible? The writing truly is dry and typically textbookish. The author has made the curious choice of occasionally speaking in first-person - “For example, I consider myself a puzzle lover” (p. 375) - but not offering a brief introductory biography or foreword. As a result, the text feels impersonal and a bit detached - and it may be quite hard to get into for those not comfortable with academic readings.\n\nConsistency rating: 4\n\nThe book is consistent, yes, but there is room here for expansion and growth. Communication in the Real World is consistently academic in structure and tone, though it would have been marvelous to have short essays written by students/alumni who are using these skills and ideas in their \"real worlds,\" so as to bring these ideas to life and to help readers see more clearly how communication skills are a benefit in practice.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe book's great strength is it's ability to be used in multiple beginning-level courses. It will be easy for me to separate the Interpersonal Communication content that I want my students to read.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 3\n\nWhile there are subheadings within chapters, they aren’t quite as helpful as they could be, and instead often seemed a bit random and haphazard. A tighter outline would have been helpful to direct students to explore, or re-review, key ideas. I did appreciate the historical framing of the discipline itself at the start, though. Many faculty may choose to skip the introductory chapter in order to move into the specific course-related content, but I believe it is important for students to be exposed to the roots of the discipline early on, and why Communication Studies is a vital part of the Liberal Arts.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nNo significant interface issues that I could readily identify. The .pdf version was fully functional and clear.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe book appears to have been clearly written and proofread, yes.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nWhile there are fundamentally important issues related to intercultural interaction and diversity in Communication in the Real World, these issues are undermined a bit by the choice of images. The book lacks representative images and voices, and often feels more like it’s talking about marginalized cultural groups, rather than talking to them or with them. This is perhaps the book's greatest weakness.\n\nComments\n\nI’m very thankful that this text exists as a starting point for our discipline, and students will greatly appreciate the no-cost option. But I expect to do a good deal of work building supplementary material so that the negatives can be addressed and the positives can be strengthened for student learning. If you’re unsure in your decision to adopt Communication in the Real World, you may want to stick with your trusted, affordable resources until more supplements, or an updated edition, can be created.\n\nReviewed by Bradley Wolfe, Adjunct Professor, Minnesota State University, Mankato on 5/21/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThe textbook covers all the basic topics for an introductory communication course. I've used the textbook for my introduction to communication course, along with selections of the text for small group communication. The book covers plenty of topic for a professor to customize what to cover in the semester and what to leave out. The book is easy to read and I've heard no complaints from students. Only positive comments about how it was free!\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe book covers all the topics in good introductory detail. I like to supplement the text with diverse perspectives, such as voices from different ethnic or cultural backgrounds. Claiming an \"unbiased\" perspective puts a claim on what is \"true\" and what voice matters the most. We never can be free of bias, but the textbook does well at providing foundational information that can be agreed upon as the whole.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nSome additions could be made to center diverse voices and perspectives. The information contained is relevant, but not fully inclusive to the full diversity of communication among and across cultures.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nStudents have no trouble reading and understanding the assigned readings. When I have used this book, students have comprehended everything well with limited follow up explanation needed from me. We were able to use class time apply what was learned from the readings.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe organization and flow is consistent throughout. Some sub-chapters are longer than others, but overall students know what to expect.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThe book does a great job of having flexibility for what is assigned. The sub-chapters allow professors to customize the text for their class without much hassle. Some things I can cover myself in class so the section doesn't need to be assigned, but others I can have the students read beforehand to apply in class.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nI use the textbook out of order, but the pattern is typical for introductory communication texts.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is easy for students to navigate. I ensure to hyperlinks the specific assignments on our learning management system to make it easy for students to find the assigned readings.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo issues that I found.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nThe text is fairly basic in covering introductory communication concepts. I've seen better work done in terms of including diverse voices and perspectives into the text. There is some diversity represented in the text, but those concepts are isolated and not integrated throughout. This is the one downside of this textbook.\n\nComments\n\nGreat book overall. Free and easy to use for students. I definitely recommend taking advantage of this resource.\n\nReviewed by Lucas Hackenburg, Graduate Teaching Assistant, University of Nebraska - Lincoln on 4/3/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis textbook includes the major ideas and topics as most other introductory communication studies texts. This text is appropriate for a 100/1000-level course. Four chapter are devoted to public speaking, so consider the structure of the course. In a class that requires a public speaking component, this would be appropriate; these sections may not be useful in large lecture settings.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThere are no major content errors.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nVideos and examples are still relevant. I imagine that they will need updated within the next five years or so (i.e. \"Shows like The Office and The Apprentice...\" may not be as easily recalled in a few years). The text focuses predominantly on larger theoretical ideas and themes. Updating the examples and images would be fairly easy.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThis book presents theoretical ideas in ways that could be understood easily by underclassmen. The definitions are accessible through the reading and does not require prior knowledge of the subject area. One recommendation would be to include a glossary where bolded terms are easily accessible.\n\nConsistency rating: 4\n\nThere are several instances where the author uses \"I\" to demonstrate experiences or ideas (\"I argue... I suggest...\"). Some sections do not have any of these anecdotes, whereas other sections have several. This inconsistent shifts from theory to personal account are distracting. Not detrimental, but it does disrupt the flow of reading.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThis texts is divided well. As previously mentioned, there is a significant public speaking section in this book, but that could easily be removed or altered to align with course goals.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nOverall, this book is organized well and similarly to other textbooks I have used in my course. I understand why the public speaking section is positioned where it is (after intercultural communication), but it is a difficult transition from communication theory and practice to public speaking. (I have had the same complaint for every textbook I have used, so this is not a unique situation, as the textbooks I have used are organized in the same way.) Breaking the course into units may help alleviate the tension of this transition.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nOverall, the interface is user-friendly. An option to continue to the next section at the conclusion of each section would be more convenient than scrolling back to the top and selecting from the Table of Contents. Links to videos and other sites all appear active and in working order.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo major grammar issues to note.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nThe intercultural chapter is more engaging than other similar textbooks on the market! Overall, I think it provides a great opportunity to facilitate classroom discussion, especially when helping students apply the information they are learning outside of the classroom. It is important to remember that this textbook is written from an American perspective, and instructors should be prepared to engage in conversations about privilege when using this textbook.\n\nComments\n\nOverall, I would use this text for an introductory communication course. For general education requirements across majors, this text covers theoretical and practical topics which students can easily translate outside of the classroom. For communication studies majors specifically, I would recommend supplementing the material with texts specifically related to the discipline.\n\nReviewed by Carolyn Weber, Communication Faculty, Minnesota State on 3/18/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThis text provides what it claims - an \"an introduction\" to range of communication concepts and focuses on skills, predominantly in the area of public speaking. I chose to use segments of this text for an online interpersonal communication course - as this was the best \"OER\" that I was able to find to use for this course.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nI have not encountered any glaring errors. The author writes with consistent, inclusive language.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nThe examples used are current - and based on the political references the text will become outdated in a few years. Supplementing these areas with current names and analogies will not be difficult. The last \"generation group\" identified is Generation Y. Again, the concepts are relevant and supplements will provide timely data.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe text is well-written and appropriate for an introductory college communication course. The text appears to follow the thesis driven, North American Writing style. The author presents the information in a format that flows well and holds my interest.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe text is constructed in an easy to follow-format with a consistent pattern. Learning objectives followed by modules, key takeaways, exercises, and references.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nEach chapter contains a consistent number of modules to help the instructor deliver the content to the learner in a systematic manner. The headings of each module provide structure and agility to the text.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nDoes the term \"New Media\" fit? It may, however, I think that \"the evolution of New Media\" and the discussion of this mode of communication may fit better toward the beginning of the text.\n\nInterface rating: 4\n\nA few of the images appear distorted or stretched. The format in which the text is available is abundant.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nWell-written!\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nAlthough the language is \"inclusive,\" as noted by other reviewers, the images are not diverse. A variety of ethnicities are not represented in pictures.\n\nComments\n\nThis text has been extremely helpful and, until there is an OER developed, I will continue to use the book for interpersonal communication. I will also consider using segments of the text for an online introductory public speaking course.\n\nReviewed by Skye Chernichky-Karcher, Assistant Professor, Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania on 3/14/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThe range of topics for this book is comparable to other leading textbooks of this area from popular publishers. This would be perfect for a course that seeks to cover communication studies with a public speaking component, but lacks topics that may be relevant for a course that is strictly communication studies without a speaking component. I echo other reviewers in that this book lacks emerging areas of communication studies such as health communication. This may, however, be a critique of the larger \"brand\" of introduction to communication studies textbooks and not this book specifically.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThis textbook cites the appropriate literature for the major concepts covered. The strength here is citation and discussion of key literature that is the foundation of each topic (e.g., noise as a barrier to listening). I wish that the book would also consider adding in the most current applications of some of this literature as I will discuss below in the relevance section. Examples are unbiased.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThe textbook includes the necessary content for the concepts covered. However, it lacks specific examples or current applications of some of this content. For example, in the discussion of Family Communication Patterns theory it would have been helpful to cite some of the more relevant literature using this theory. This textbook gives a great foundation for the most important concepts related to communication, but as an instructor, I need to fill in the gaps with the most relevant applications of these concepts. This is one of the major pieces that sets this book apart from the current publisher textbooks that I've used previously in my course.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is written in a clear and appropriate tone. I also like the repetition of major concepts in each unit. For example, the chapter on family communication processes includes a discussion of two major communication processes in family communication literature: conversation and conformity orientations. The text also provides a visual image of these processes. They also come up again in the key takeaways section and are reinforced in the exercises at the end of the unit. This clarity and consistency is wonderful for students and instructors alike.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe book has a consistent structure throughout the units. The book is also consistent in highlighting important terminology. Related to modulation (below), the way that each unit was presented was consistent: learning objectives, content, key takeaways, and exercises.\n\nModularity rating: 4\n\nOverall the break down of the content makes sense. The topics are also appropriately split within each unit. My only suggestion would be to include a symbol for the subheadings within each unit. For example, in section 6.4 Self-Disclosure and Interpersonal Communication there are three subheadings: Theories, Process, and Effects. It would be nice if each of these sections also had a numerical indicator: 6.4.1, 6.4.2, and 6.4.3 for example. This would make it easier to assign short reading for each of these sections if I were to take more than one class period to discuss self disclosure.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nThe public speaking sections seems to come in the middle of the textbook. I would suggest moving these units to the end. The learning objectives at the beginning of each unit and the discussion questions at the end are very helpful.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe interface is easy to use and visually stimulating. The mobile interface is very impressive and easy to use.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe book appears to be free from grammatical errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nThe book is very sensitive to include examples of diversity and culture throughout the textbook and was not restricted to only chapter 8 which discusses culture and communication.\n\nComments\n\nThis is a great textbook for a class seeking to cover communication studies with a public speaking component. You could also use this as a foundation for a human communication course, but would need to supplement this book with other reading material. I really appreciate the ease in accessing this textbook on mobile devices - this is a huge advantage of the online platforms that publishers offer for their textbooks which I have found to not be very good.\n\nReviewed by Leigh Kelley, Instructor, Radford University on 2/19/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nI use this textbook in an Introduction to Communication course that covers both Communication and Mass Communication. It does a good job providing an overview of such topics such as history, process, perception, listening, verbal, nonverbal, group and other areas that align with program objectives for our academic unit. This resource ensures all students have immediate access to the content from the first day of class, and allows the instructor to focus on supplementing the material with lectures, discussions and in-class exercises. As mine is a large class I do not use the public speaking chapters. In addition, I use other resources for the Mass Communication topics because of the nature of the discipline.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe content is accurate. I have not noticed any errors, and the author has an unbiased approach to the content, with research supporting the information presented.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nThe text provides useful and relevant content but will need updates from those who choose to use it. Instructors need to be mindful of current events as they relate to the content. An example would be Including discussion of events such as the 2018 Charlottesville riots, during which marchers carried Nazi symbols and Confederate battle flags, which are an important coda to the \"history/past-present/future dialectic” and discussion of controversy over what the Confederate flag symbolizes in the chapter dealing with Intercultural Communication. This can be achieved by updating examples in the text and providing up-to-date content in lectures. Also worth note: I was pleasantly surprised that there were fewer 404 errors than anticipated in the links to external references.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nKey takeaways, definitions, highlighted and hyperlinked text provide a great resource for students navigating an introduction to the study of communication. It makes the text accessible, clear and easy to understand. Example and illustrations help communicate key points, and terms are clearly defined.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe organization helps guide readers through the content, lets students focus and organize their studies, and facilitates instructor updates. The organization of content areas into subchapters, learning objectives, key takeaways, suggested exercises, and well-cited sidebars provides a clear and consistent format for the material presented.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nThere is continuity in the way the text is structured, so that a linear progression through the text allows students to build on prior knowledge. At the same time, important topics have sufficient repetition and reinforcement so that instructors can effectively teach select chapters, and teach chapters out of sequence.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe order of the chapters themselves, as well as the content within chapters, provides a clear and logical presentation of the material. The content builds and extends ideas presented elsewhere in the text.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nWhile students could use any format, I used the .epub file. Charts and images were clear, and digital reading tools made it easy to mark the text, make notes, and reference content as needed. I did not notice any problems with the interface or in navigating through the content.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nI did not notice nor was I distracted by grammatical or spelling errors.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 3\n\nThis text may limited by freely available photography; instructors should be aware that images in the text heavily features Caucasian subjects. Instructors using this text may want to specifically seek out presentation/lecture images that are more representative. Textual content and examples selected strive to be inclusive.\n\nComments\n\nThe textbook is appropriate for an introductory level course in communication. This is a fantastic contribution to the field and is a great resource to ensure students have affordable access to a resource that provides a solid foundation for the study of communication.\n\nReviewed by Merissa Bunton (Brown), Lecturer of Speech and English, Leeward Community College on 2/14/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nI plan to begin using this book for my Human Communication course. All of the topics I address are adequately covered in this text. When I began my initial review of the book, I loved the online glossary with the easy to navigate \"dropdown\" menu that quickly links users to the desired topics. Additionally, the learning objectives outlined at the beginning of each section are especially helpful.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe writer's adherence to inclusive language throughout the text demonstrated best practices in modern communication. No glaring errors distracted me from the content.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nI appreciated that the book had two separate chapters addressing media and communication. The first of the two, Chapter 15, provided a general, history and overview of the development of media over time (especially as related to technology), theories associated with media, and a section on ethics. The second, Chapter 16, looked specifically at new media. Separating the chapters in this way, I believe, will make the book easier to update and media continues to evolve.\n\nClarity rating: 4\n\nI like that the wording is approachable for most readers. I would prefer the author(s) not use \"we\" in the discussions because that word inherently discriminates against those who do not share the same experience as the author(s). Additionally, although key words are highlighted in the text, I would also like to see those same key words defined in the margin or at the end of chapters to help students study as they build their lexicon. The \"Key Takeaways\" listed at the end of each section are nice.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe writer(s) did a lovely job scaffolding the information throughout the text. Terminology was consistent.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nI really appreciate the attention to detail employed when preparing the various sections of the text. As I build my resources for both my online and face to face sections I will be able to embed links easily in my online classroom and handouts for student reading/reference/discussion.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe organization of the first six chapters align exactly with the way I prefer to teach. I love being able to assign chapters to students in sequential order. The division of the two chapters about media and communication, at the end of the book, is perfect for updating. Listing learning objectives at the beginning of each section and key takeaways at the end of each chapter is extraordinarily useful.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nNavigation is simple, intuitive, and user-friendly for both digital natives and digital immigrants. The option to download and print a pdf of the entire book is also helpful.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nApart from an occasional error, the book is well edited for grammar and clarity.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nThe book employs inclusive language throughout with no instances, I perceived, of direct cultural insensitivity.\n\nComments\n\nI look forward to using this book for not only my introduction to human communication course, but as a supplementary resource for many of the English courses I teach as students approach group projects. Specifically, I plan to use the information from Chapter 5 (listening) and Chapter 13 (small group communication).\n\nReviewed by Valerie Young, Associate Professor, Communication, Hanover College on 1/25/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nEach chapter supports both the \"typical\" topics in similar breadth and depth as the traditional hybrid Intro to Communication text and I was pleasantly surprised to see the integration of topics within and between chapters. For example, rarely to Communication texts engage with the National Communication Association resources in the way that this one does. The chapters reference NCA's work in learning outcomes, skills, ethics, and employment in the field.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nThe content is very accurate, from my perspective and background. For instructors who find something missing, it should be easy to supplement with a journal article or two. Personally, the major content areas are fully covered and there are plenty of references to content that is omitted from other Intro texts due to space constraints. I did not notice many (any?) errors or bias in the content during my initial read. The Chapter 16 acknowledges that new tech changes occur rapidly. The author links to a personal blog (no thanks; not my favorite way to update textbook content), and the blog is not written in English.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 4\n\nPlenty of examples are embedded into the text, up to the Obama/2012 election era. It would be fantastic to update the political and social references again to connect with readers and contemporary examples in media.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nThe book is written in a conversational, approachable writing style that should be appealing to lower-level undergraduate students; it makes for an “easy read” even though chapters are broken down into several sections and the text is plenty lengthy. I could easily assign this text in a 100-200 level course without reservation, based on the clarity of writing. I don't love the occasional use of first-person language/writing, but that's a minor, personal annoyance.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nLike a traditional text, each chapter begins with a list of learning outcomes; ends with takeaway summaries and a list of discussion prompts, rhetorical questions, or activities appropriate for the classroom. The learning outcomes and content is consistent with those used in the broader communication field. The text provides a broader scope for the historical framework of our discipline, couching the discipline in rhetoric, as many Intro texts mention the ancient evolution of the field (including technical and mediated communication) rather flippantly. There are not as many journal article source citations as I’d like, and it would be fantastic to link some web content or other content into the citations or as video examples earlier in the text. Some of the chapters have videos embedded; others do not.\n\nModularity rating: 4\n\nI appreciate that the lengthy chapters are easy to divide into sections. Each section is easy to navigate on screen and would allow an instructor to divide reading assignments by chapter subsection, based on the pacing of the course reading assignments. Sometimes, reading the entire nonverbal chapter (for example) can be overwhelming; yet dividing the content into an overview, a focus on types, then competence and context makes the chapter easier to approach in subsections. Each subsection contains subheadings for readability. My complaint here is still praise: even the subsections are very detailed and lengthy. I'd much rather have too much content than too little; however, my students may feel overwhelmed if asked to read more than one or two subsection per class period. With that said, if you've ever hesitated to assign a full chapter of reading per day for fatigue reasons, this modular format will allow you to break apart each chapter and cover content as students keep up with reading subsections.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nExcellent organization and flow between topics. Very similar to the previous texts I have used for this level of class. The chapters are presented in a nearly identical order. There are two topics- culture and organizational communication- that are *typically* reserved for separate chapters in other Intro texts. Here, I appreciate that concepts regarding culture and organizational communication are interwoven into several chapters, where relevant- and cultural communication and leadership development have their own chapters, as well. Makes for seamless organization (and plenty of content!).\n\nInterface rating: 3\n\nIt is fairly easy to navigate through the pages and subheadings using links at the bottom of the pages. The subheadings would be easier to navigate if a list of chapter subheadings/content appeared on the upper left side of the screen and followed the reader, so that as I read subsection 4.3, I can easily click back to content in 4.2 and 4.4 without scrolling to the bottom of the page. (like the content dropdown menu bar, but one that follows the page and only pertains to the chapter open).This is a minor concern. I do appreciate the links embedded into the chapters; however, as I link backward or forward to content that is already covered (for example, Chapter 15 references Chapter 9; I click on the link and I'm tossed to the beginning of Chapter 9, but it's not simple to navigate back to the area of Chapter 15 where I was at). The cheesy stock photos could be improved. Chapter 16 ends rather abruptly. It would be helpful to have a final page/glossary that links and reviews each chapter's content or learning objectives.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nNo issues encountered\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 4\n\nNo issues encountered. I appreciate how several topics are separated out from other chapters and linked in to the chapters where appropriate. We often want our students to draw these links, but it is impossible (literally) in a print copy to do this while reading or studying. Stock photos could be improved. Additional research on under-served / under-studied and non-Western populations, also, could enhance chapters beyond cultural communication.\n\nReviewed by Christy Takamure, Associate Professor of Speech, CC, Leeward Community College on 1/18/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 5 see less\n\nThis text clearly covers all subject areas and concepts that may be found in most communication textbooks. It is very comprehensive and does not leave out any key terms pertinent in a speech communication course yet, it does not provide too much information to overwhelm the reader.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 5\n\nThe content is accurate, unbiased, and contains supporting research findings. Data and information are current and contextually appropriate.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nThe content is straightforward with clear definitions. Examples are not clearly dated so modifications or changes can be easily made to the content. Dated information can be easily added to increase relevance to your current students. After teaching communication courses for over twenty years, I have found this text to be all that you would need since you can add any of your own material to supplement the material.\n\nClarity rating: 5\n\nTerms and concepts are clearly defined. There are appropriate explanations if jargons or technical terminology are used. It is easy to understand and straightforward. At the end of each section there are “key takeaways” which summarizes concepts to help the reader identify and remember the main points. It is the perfect text for students at all reading levels.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe textbook is written in the same format and organization from chapter-to-chapter. It is clearly organized and easy to follow. Every chapter is divided into separate sections. Each section includes the learning objectives at the very beginning; text covering the subject; a \"getting real\" section that connects the topics to the readers to make it more meaningful and relevant; a summary of the \"key takeaways\"; and exercises to engage the reader with the information.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nEvery chapter is divided into separate sections that allows the reader to fully comprehend the material. Each section includes the learning objectives at the very beginning; text covering the subject; a \"getting real\" section that connects the topics covered to the readers to make it more meaningful; a summary of the \"key takeaways\"; and exercises to engage the reader with the information.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 5\n\nThe organization of the text follows a clear, consistent, and logical fashion. Learning objectives before each section helps the reader to identify the key points so that they know what to focus on. The reader will appreciate the straightforward structure of this text.\n\nInterface rating: 5\n\nThe text is clear and easy to read. Pictures and illustrations add interest and breaks up lengthy text sections. It is visually appealing.\n\nGrammatical Errors rating: 5\n\nThe text is free of grammatical errors. Terms are clear and technical/jargons are defined.\n\nCultural Relevance rating: 5\n\nAt the end of each section, there are exercises to possibly use in the classroom. These exercises help to engage the reader to make the concepts more relevant to their lives to make it more meaningful. My student population is very diverse and the exercises allows for open discussions and self-reflections.\n\nComments\n\nI have been teaching communication courses for over twenty years and was ecstatic to discover this textbook that is comprehensive and satisfies the learning outcomes of my communication course. I am certain that my colleagues will appreciate this textbook because of its simplicity, compatibility, and accessibility.\n\nReviewed by Jonathan Anderegg, Assistant Professor, George Fox University on 1/16/19\n\nComprehensiveness rating: 4 see less\n\nThis textbook offers a broad look at communication theory, particularly through a rhetorical lens. While the social scientific theoretical side may be a bit lacking, the book makes up for this in the breadth of topics it covers. I appreciated the depth at which it covers issues related to public speaking, like communication competence, speech anxiety, and outline and organizing speeches.\n\nContent Accuracy rating: 4\n\nThe book definitely has some weak areas, especially as communication theory connects with other social science disciplines like psychology and sociology. However, for introductory communication courses, there are few things that are of concern.\n\nRelevance/Longevity rating: 5\n\nMost of the content of this text is and will be useful for all freshman communication courses for the foreseeable future. The focus is generally on timeless ways humans have connected.\n\nClarity rating: 3\n\nWhile the content is rich and broad, the overall sense when reading the text is that it's a firehose of content: the reader is often pummeled with term after term. Often, I find that the best communication texts are those that are more narrative in style, which helps many freshman connect with new terms and ideas, especially when they should be connected to what we see in everyday life.\n\nConsistency rating: 5\n\nThe structure of the book is solid and consistent across chapters. Especially helpful are the key takeaway blocks at the end of every sub-chapter. These unfailingly offer strong summary statements of the important points for each page.\n\nModularity rating: 5\n\nWhile the text as a whole is too large to be assigned in a semester-long class, the chapters are divided into easily assigned readings that can be arranged as necessary.\n\nOrganization/Structure/Flow rating: 4\n\nI think that as a whole "
