        "text": "There is no disabled attribute for hyperlinks. If you don't want something to be linked then you'll need to remove the <a> tag altogether.\n\nAlternatively you can remove its href attribute - though this has other UX and Accessibility issues as noted in the comments below so is not recommended.\n\nThe <a> tag doesn't have a disabled attribute, that's just for <input>s (and <select>s and <textarea>s).\n\nTo \"disable\" a link, you can remove its href attribute, or add a click handler that returns false.\n\nYou need to remove the <a> tag to get rid of this.\n\nor try using :-\n\n<a href=\"/\" onclick=\"return false;\">123n</a>\n\nThe best answer is always the simplest. No need for any coding.\n\nIf the (a) anchor tag has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink. Supported by all browsers!\n\n<a href=\"/\">free web counters</a><br /> <a \"/\">free web counters</a>\n\nUse buttons and links correctly.\n\n• Buttons activate scripted functionality on a web page (dialogs, expand/collapse regions).\n\n• Links take you to another location, either to a different page or different location on the same page.\n\nIf you follow these rules there won't be any scenario when you need to disable a link. Even if you make a link look visually disabled and blank onclick\n\n<a href=\"\" ng-click=\"Ctrl._isLinkActive && $ctrl.gotoMyAwesomePage()\"\n\nYou won't be considering accessibility and screen readers will read it as a link and visually impaired people will keep wondering why is the link not working.\n\nHere are various ways to disable the a tag :\n\n<a >Link Text</a> remove the href from your anchor tag <a href=”javascript:void(0)”/>Link text</a> put javascript:void(0) in href <a href=\"/\" onclick=\"return false;\">Link text</a> using return false\n\nAs there is no disabled attributes for anchor tag. If you want to stop anchor tag behavior inside a jQuery function than you can use the the below line in the start of the function :\n\n$( \"a\" ).click(function( e ) { e.preventDefault(); $( \"<div>\" ) .append( \"default \" + e.type + \" prevented\" ) .appendTo( \"#log\" ); });\n\nevent.preventDefault()\n\nI see there are already a ton of answers posted here, but I don’t think there’s any clear one yet that combines the already mentioned approaches into the one I’ve found to work. This is to make the link both appear disabled, and also not redirect the user to another page.\n\nThis answer assumes you’re using jquery and bootstrap, and uses another property to temporarily store the href property while disabled.\n\n//situation where link enable/disable should be toggled function toggle_links(enable) { if (enable) { $('.toggle-link') .removeClass('disabled') .prop('href', $(this).attr('data-href')) } else { $('.toggle-link') .addClass('disabled') .prop('data-href', $(this).prop('href')) .prop('href','#') }\n\na.disabled { cursor: default; }\n\nIf you're using WordPress, I created a plugin that can do this & much more without needing to know how to code anything. All you need to do is add the selector of the link(s) that you want to disable & then choose \"Disable all links with this selector in a new tab.\" from the dropdown menu that appears and click update.\n\nClick here to view a gif that demonstrates this\n\nYou can get the free version from the WordPress.org Plugin repository to try it out.\n\nAnything in the href tag will display at the bottom-left of the browser window when you mouse over it.\n\nI personally think having something like javascript:void(0) displayed to the user is hideous.\n\nInstead, leave href off, do your magic with with jQuery/whatever else and add a style rule (if you still need it to look like a link):\n\na { cursor:pointer; }\n\n<a href=\"/\" disabled=\"true\" onclick=\"return false\">123</a>\n\nJust adding: This works in general, however it wont work if user has disabled javascript in browser.\n\n1) You could optionally use Bootstrap 3 class on your anchor tag to disable the href tag, after integrating bootstrap 3 plugin do\n\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"btn btn-primary disabled\">123n</a>\n\nOr\n\n2) Learn how to enable javascript using html or js in browsers. or create a pop-up telling user to enable javascript using before using the website\n\nThere is an easy and clean way like so:\n\n<a href=\"/shopcart/\"> <button class=\"btn\" disabled> Make an Order </button> </a>\n\nHaving disabled attribute on a <button> by default does not let clicks go through <button> element up to <a> element. So <a> element does not even know that some clicks happened. Manipulate by adding/removing disabled attribute on a <button>."
