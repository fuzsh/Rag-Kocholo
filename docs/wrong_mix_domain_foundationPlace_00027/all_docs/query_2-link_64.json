        "text": "If you’re like me, your personal geography of your city is based mostly on its streets, but you’ve never really given their names a second thought. A few months ago, I realized that those street names would probably make a great window into local history, full of local heroes and pivotal events from every different layer of a city’s past, so I decided to try mapping those stories for my hometown of San Francisco.\n\nA question worth asking before starting a project like this: why put it on a map? After all, if someone wants to learn the histories, there are plenty of existing books and websites for that. But I felt that connecting it to the geography of the streets was the key. That would put the stories on a user’s mental map of the streets they walk every day and allow them to see their own neighborhood and city in a new way (indeed, the first thing almost any SF resident seems to do with the finished product is zoom to their own street and start working their way outwards).\n\nI had a general vision for the project in my head, and I knew the basic recipe would look like this:\n\nGet the geographic data on streets from OpenStreetMap.\n\nGet the histories behind the street names anywhere I could find them.\n\nUse Leaflet to combine them into a lush, clickable full-screen map.\n\nSeems simple enough, right? What followed was a textbook case in the unavoidable messiness of real-world data and how the smallest design detail can make the biggest difference.\n\nWhat’s Next?\n\nI was pleasantly shocked by how many non-San Francisco people enjoyed the map and reached out about building the same thing for their hometowns. I got emails from places like New York, London, Boston, Memphis, Belize City, Paris, Berlin, and Belgrade. The next step? Work on that should-have-done-it-to-begin-with admin interface and package it up into a toolkit that anyone can use to build the same thing for another city!"
