        "text": "In layman’s terms, the technical functionality of a website is the interaction between the site and the site visitor, addressing the site’s purpose. We work to ensure that elements of functional design (i.e., blogs, forums, flash or audio, e-commerce) include a consistent display and optimization across different browsers and platforms (i.e., computers, tablets, and mobile devices).\n\nUsability refers to the ease of your users’ interactions with your website. Users should be able to comfortably navigate your website to access the information or tools that they need. Another important element of web usability is ensuring the site’s technical functionality. Our designers can build an online contact us form or chat for easy visitor interaction and follow the latest developments and best practices in usability to ensure that your site is structured in a logical and engaging way that is appropriate for your targeted audience.\n\nYour website should be an extension of your vision, and we take great care to ensure that your site is consistent with your company’s brand and image. Because people often visit your website to learn more about your business, we feel that it’s important to highlight your mission, strengths, and what sets you apart from competitors.\n\nGraphic designers have a particular role of building solid designs and executing brand strategies on websites. The graphics on your site should complement your content and enhance your company’s professional image. Our skilled designers will create a visual map using graphics, pages, layouts, and interactive pieces for your website. We strive for the balance between distinctiveness and consistency in selecting and creating graphics that correspond with your company’s brand and mission.\n\nA content management system (CMS) is software that houses the content of your website, whether it be text, photos, videos, music, or more. We create your site with a CMS so that your site can be easily maintained even by those with little to no technical skill. We also incorporate open-source software (OSS), which means that each element that we use on your site allows modification in its licensing so that your site is perfectly unique to you.\n\nYour web dashboard of data should be easy to use, and should display in a clean layout. Our web designers will work with you on designing a website dashboard that is easy to use by your admin and has a simple visual display of your data, view a sample here. By focusing more on your content and the features of the dashboard your reader experience will be improved. Hover details and data snippets will help to keep your dashboards simple. What are some of the metrics you want to see in your dashboard display?\n\nWe can build single, multi-page, and hybrid web applications using MEAN stacks, which have robust features allowing you to create, read, update,and delete records in a user-friendly interface. It can be a contact management application, a property management application, a marketing survey application, or just anything you want.\n\nThe dynamic nature of technology requires websites to adapt to the latest platforms, browsers, and applications. Let us ensure that the software that comprises your site continues to fuction properly and evolve long after launch.\n\nThe most important maintenance function for your website is performing regular site backups. Backing up your site regularly provides you with a reliable safety net (essentially a snapshot of all your important components needed for site regulation), just in case anything goes wrong with your site from a flawed software update to hacking. Examples of such components include: website code files, databases, images, add-ons, or plugins used on your website. We will help you determine how often your particular site should be backed up and then regularly back it up for you so that you can keep your peace of mind.\n\nWebsites that are updated frequently with fresh content are crawled by search engines more often. Your users are also more likely to return to your website if it provides them with new information each time they visit. Let us assist you with creating new image-centric content or text-based content for your site to keep it up-to-date and encourage users to return whether they are using their PC, tablet or mobile device.\n\nCollecting and analyzing data about your site and its users are two key components in determining whether your site is successfully fulfilling its purpose. We’re happy to assist by managing your website’s analytics, setting goals, performing A/B testing, assessing outcomes and more.\n\nIf your website allows users to author text in any capacity, from forum posts to blog comments, you’ll want to monitor your site for any inappropriate content. We’ll moderate your user-generated content to ensure that all text, images, or videos meet your site guidelines.\n\nWebsite copywriting and editing are one of the most important aspects of your website. The best copywriters you’ll find will speak directly to your website reader. Let our writers provide you with copy that is consistent with your brand, your voice and speaks directly to your reader. The copywriter will bring you SEOed traffic, and provide content for display that gets your readers attention. Let us market the content to your readers, and add more reach to your website."
