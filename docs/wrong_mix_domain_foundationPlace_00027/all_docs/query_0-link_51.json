        "text": "AI in SAP-Leading the New Age Digital Transformation\n\nIn today’s fast-paced market dynamics, staying competitive requires constant innovation and the strategic implementation of advanced technologies. Among these, Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a transformative force, revolutionizing how enterprises function, make decisions, and interact with customers. SAP, an enterprise software giant is fast integrating AI into its platforms, delivering innovative solutions that optimize business processes, improve decision-making, and augment efficiency. Let’s explore the role of AI in SAP, highlighting how optimizing AI in SAP applications drives business benefits. The Role of AI in SAP SAP’s strategy for incorporating AI involves embedding intelligent technologies directly into its core products, including SAP S/4HANA, SAP Customer Experience, SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Ariba. This seamless integration allows businesses to leverage AI capabilities without extensive customization or additional infrastructure. With AI integration in SAP, it aims to provide its users with more intelligent, automated, and efficient solutions that drive better business outcomes. AI in SAP-The Roadmap AI-driven Analytics for SAP-Predictive Analytics and Insights AI-powered predictive analytics in SAP systems enable businesses to anticipate market trends, customer behaviors, and operational challenges. AI algorithms can provide actionable insights by analyzing vast amounts of historical and real-time data. This allows companies to make proactive decisions, such as adjusting their inventory based on predicted demand, thereby reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction with AI-driven analytics for SAP. Enhanced Customer Experience SAP’s Customer Experience solutions offer personalized interactions and recommendations through AI. AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants handle customer inquiries, enabling manual resources to focus on more intricate tasks. This improves customer satisfaction and optimizes resource allocation. AI can analyze customer data to provide product or service suggestions tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the overall customer journey. Automated Processes Automation is one of AI’s most significant contributions to SAP environments. SAP Automation with AI, such as with Robotic Process Automation (RPA), can handle repetitive tasks such as data entry, invoice processing, and compliance checks. This reduces errors, speeds up processes, and allows employees to focus on higher-value activities. With SAP AI applications, companies can automate these mundane tasks, achieving greater efficiency and accuracy. AI for SAP Application Development opens up immense business opportunities to streamline and optimize their operational processes.

However, as we integrate more sophisticated tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and generative creative technologies, we often encounter outputs that feel unnatural, flat, or irrelevant. The challenge is not to reinvent the core tenets of great digital experiences but to evolve them. How might we leverage new capabilities in a way that remains deeply connected to the essence of our businesses and the expectations of our users? Generative AI is a potent actor on the stage of DX, yet inherently limited without deep customer insights. DX practitioners are the directors – we must expertly edit, continuously adapt, and carefully select outputs that contribute to the overarching story we wish to tell. Key Abilities for DX “Directors” As we reshape guide creative executions and think about delivering compelling digital narratives, there are key abilities that organizations must foster: 1. Creativity In an AI-enhanced world, creativity involves coming up with innovative ways to harness new outputs. This means driving narratives that bring humor, sarcasm, levity, and gravity to digital executions. It’s about using AI not just as a creator but as a collaborator in your creative process and being at the helm of a cohesive vision. 2. Specificity AI requires precise guidance—a “script.\" The more specific the input, the more authentically AI can bring the scene to life. This involves having the insight and language to guide how digital actors produce experiences that are not only engaging but also aligned with the brand’s voice and customer expectations. 3. Purpose Technology for technology’s sake, or creativity that does not serve a clear business purpose, is all just special effects with no substance. Outputs that lack cohesion and vision will likely miss the mark and risk alienating the audience. Purpose-driven digital experiences are those that leave lasting impressions and yield tangible business results. Conclusion: Crafting Moments Through the Lens of DX Digital experience is both a consumer of emerging technologies and a driver of innovation – much like a Director observing a performance behind the lens of a camera. We are orchestrating moments, guiding the narrative arc, and ensuring that the end product resonates with the audience. Artificial Intelligence (AI), like a versatile actor, brings to life the vision of the DX director, transforming scripts into memorable performances that can captivate and charm. Yet, without the director's vision, the actor’s performance may lack context and emotion, rendering the story unconvincing. When the DX director and AI actor are in sync, the result is a seamless fusion of innovation and intuition.\n\nSAP S/4 HANA Strategy and Assessment\n\nA successful SAP S/4HANA digital transformation requires an enterprise-wide assessment of the current and future business needs, the existing and forthcoming technology ecosystem, and the organizational readiness to adapt to change – starting from the top. Stated differently, a holistic approach that analyses different value levers across your organization’s people, processes, and technologies is time well spent to bolster what good can look like. A well-defined strategy driven by insights from a strategy and assessment phase can reinforce the success of an SAP S/4HANA transformation and bolster the intended results. Ineffective strategic planning with incomplete or a lack of a strategy and assessment often leads to delays in implementation, suboptimized operational processes, poor user adoption, and ultimately does not give the intended benefits. Such implementations can lead to heavy losses in costs incurred, adaptability and can lead to failure. Optimizing the S/4HANA implementation is only possible when you have the right strategy and assessment up front. SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment is not limited to a single technology shift to S/4HANA or a migration from SAP ECC but is also essential for optimizing when an organization is faced with a merger, acquisition, or divestiture. If your organization is moving to an SAP S/4HANA adoption, there are a few things you should consider to make the Strategy and Assessment phase more aligned with your enterprise business goals. What Makes a Successful SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment? Your Existing Data and Operational Processes The fundamental aspect you need to consider is what you will do with your existing data and operational processes from the options below, which will provide the direction to the right S/4HANA deployment model. SAP S/4HANA can be deployed on-prem, in the cloud, or as a hybrid deployment model. This stage is crucial to SAP S/4HANA strategic planning and must be well-aligned with your organization’s requirements across the various functions that serve your enterprise. A Greenfield deployment model may suit your requirements if you start afresh by discarding all your legacy data and operational processes. The Greenfield deployment model also fits cases where you wish to have SAP-standardized data and processes. If existing transactional data and operational processes need retention, a Brownfield approach could suit the purpose. If you wish to use some of your existing data and processes and start fresh for others, a Bluefield model (Selective Transition) might be ideal. Optimizing the S/4HANA deployment strategy paves the way for a successful SAP S/4HANA implementation. In the case of multiple SAP and non-SAP landscapes, such as with Mergers and Acquisitions, a Landscape Transformation may be the suitable model. Such scenarios require the ERP landscape to be harmonized and consolidated with a selective approach. Other cases include merging multiple SAP deployments across various business units and geographies. If you are in the process of a divestiture, you need to have a carve-out approach to create different SAP landscapes from your existing deployment. For scenarios with numerous vital interfaces to SAP and third-party applications, a Brownfield or Bluefield approach may suit the requirements best for retaining existing interfaces and their linked processes. Choosing from the above models is an integral part of the S/4HANA assessment services and paves the way for a successful implementation. The Role of Change Management within Your Organization Many SAP S/4HANA implementations fail to get from the old to the new by making Change Management an end-phase exercise and often keep this capability at arm’s length in the initial phases of the program. The role of Change Management plays is integral to every phase of a deployment model. The inclusion of Change Management is vital in the SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment phase to understand and gauge the necessary levers to pull when moving from old processes and procedures to new ones. Training Effective employee training also needs to be well-defined and implemented. Conventional training systems often don’t efficiently deliver the intended results when you have a remote working or hybrid working model for your employees. The S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment phase considers the best training approach that suits your organization’s requirements and needs. Digital training assistants such as OnScreen can accentuate employee learning and adaptability by guiding employees, step-by-step, through various transactions that will be used to support their functions. Such solutions come with the flexibility of being accessed anytime and anywhere without any usage limitations. Support Flexible post-implementation support must be well-defined in your SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment phase. It needs to factor in your in-house technical capabilities and the required internal resources to effectively maintain the application, enhance existing processes, and innovate existing operations by developing new methods. All this is a necessary part of the S/4HANA assessment services and needs a well-defined strategy. In addition, an ideal SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment must include the strategy for providing required analytics and reports. It also needs to define how to deal with system integrations and extensibility. The Choice of a Technology Partner A successful SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment needs a reliable and experienced technology partner for well-defined SAP S/4HANA strategic planning based on S/4HANA assessment services. You need to factor in costs, resource engagement, post-implementation support, and, most importantly, their strategy for Change Management. Such requirements are vital to optimizing the S/4HANA deployment strategy to align with your organizational requirements. These considerations are crucial to a successful SAP S/4HANA implementation. New Era Technology, an SAP Solution Partner, provides comprehensive SAP S/4HANA Strategy and Assessment services, combined with a wealth of implementation experience.

WordPress or HubSpot CMS. We stand by the fact that no one solution works for all cases, but we recently weighed in on this discussion in a mini-blog series that you can read here. To start, we know that WordPress powers about 43% of all websites, which makes it the clear market share leader. In that regard, it is the most popular. But a slowing trend can be seen in that popularity as other solid alternatives have advanced. Also, just because it’s the most popular or the one you’re most familiar with does not make it the best choice! There are 3 main points that certainly should be considered in this discussion: Maintenance and cost, security, and ease of use. 1) Some would argue that WordPress is better because it is FREE. Many would also argue, us included, that it is NOT free. The software itself is free, but there is cost in web hosting, SSL and firewalls, multiple third-party plugins with license fees, and the huge element of time involved in the ongoing upkeep of the site and environment. Time is money. There’s also something to be said for your peace of mind that is hard to find when fighting with WP site maintenance. 2) Security is a significant and widely known issue with WordPress. Sophos reports that over 30,000 websites are hacked every day, which means about 13,000 WP sites are hit daily. This of course makes it easy to believe that WordPress is by far the most hacked CMS... by a huge margin. According to Sucuri, 4.3% of WordPress websites scanned with SiteCheck in 2022 had been hacked. That's about 1 in every 25 websites... and of course, not all WordPress sites use SiteCheck, so that is not even a complete picture. The higher platform usage makes it a larger target for hackers. The main security issue is tied to the third-party plugins, which are often not being updated and account for 92% of WP security vulnerabilities. 3) Ease of use is a big deal as a WordPress site, in most cases, leaves you with a very restrictive management environment. This forces the marketing team to have to rely on developers much too often, calling them in for what should be routine site updates. There are options to load more user-friendly plugins that give drag-n-drop content editing abilities, but these not only add cost to the equation, they also add a lot of bloat to your website, negatively affecting site performance. We have found that HubSpot CMS is a very effective solution for most websites. You actually CAN setup a HubSpot website on a free account, but there are paid versions of the CMS with a much deeper toolset of course. You can also find many free themes in the Marketplace, including some very popular options developed by New Era There are no third-party plugins, server updates, platform updates or anything else like that to maintain, so you can focus on your business instead of applying band-aids to your website. Security is well-handled also with built in Cloudflare, SSL, and a full collection of security settings that can be enabled and configured. Check out the blog posts linked above to dig more into this debate and reach out to us if you would like to talk about migrating your site from WordPress to HubSpot!

The learning curve becomes steeper in their absence, and potential users might need more guidance to use GenAI effectively. Ethical and Responsible Use Beyond the technical aspects, leaders face the critical challenge of ensuring responsible and ethical adoption of GenAI technologies. With GenAI becoming an integral part of business processes, the burden of aligning their deployment with the organization's values and ethical norms is ever-growing. Tools designed with ethical considerations and responsible GenAI principles in mind are crucial for the safe adoption of it. Lack of such tools can lead to unethical use or unintended harmful consequences, tarnishing the reputation of GenAI technology. In conclusion, you must recognize the instrumental role of tooling in successfully integrating and adopting GenAI. The responsibilities of CIOs and CTOs extend beyond the technical aspects, pushing them to facilitate the choice of the right tools that meet the technical requirements of GenAI and align with their organizations' ethical norms and values. Tools offer a gateway to accessibility, innovation, quality assurance, seamless integration, education, and ethical use of GenAI. A strategic approach to tooling defines the path for organizations to harness the true potential of GenAI, laying a solid foundation for the accelerated innovation, heightened quality, and competitive edge that this technology promises. Therefore, the choice of tools becomes a vital determinant of the tech strategy and overall organizational direction in this digital era.

Limitations of Generative AI in SAP and Ways to Mitigate Inaccuracy With the above features that make Generative AI in SAP more efficient and productive, the solution comes with its limitations, such as only having relevant information until the creation of the model. There are also several scenarios where the output will be inaccurate, such as providing biased data and generation of Hallucinations (wrong but seemingly accurate results), which calls for a need to align them with business requirements. Take a brief look at the various methods to help align Generative AI in SAP to your business processes and data, collectively termed “Grounding” of your foundation models. Aligning Generative AI in SAP to Your Business Context Prompt Engineering Large Language Models are stateless and do not have prompt recollection features. This challenge requires users to give task-specific information in the prompt, and that’s where rapid engineering comes into place. Prompt engineering involves elaborating the prompt, giving specific instructions, examples, and references, or making a well-defined structure of the desired output to give in-context learning to the model. Embeddings and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Data can also be stored in the model using vectors, which are numeric representations of information with a semantic meaning. Using a machine learning algorithm, vectors are stored as embeddings in the LLM and can be recalled by referencing the required numeric code using vector similarity scoring. Embedding grounds the prompt with the required information and references the output’s source. Orchestration Tools Using orchestration tools is an advanced technique to augment the effectiveness of prompts. The LLM accesses the tools that retrieve the required API specification, uses it to connect to the system having the relevant data, and creates the output. Fine-tuning Fine-tuning is a widely accepted grounding solution for enhancing output quality. It retrains a foundation model on a different data set and examples of the required input/output format. This practice improves the domain-specific task performance with the required solutions. Inherent drawbacks of this approach are being computationally complex and expensive in collecting the vast training data. However, Fine-tuning is well suited for improving task-specific efficiency for medium-sized foundation models but is not recommended as a first approach to ground your foundation models. Best Practices for Adaptation of Foundation Models Generic Generative AI models might not be accurate in giving output as per a specific business context. To ensure accuracy, you must ground and train these models on your particular business data. Ensure that the grounding begins within simpler processes such as prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) rather than Fine-tuning. Test, adapt, and optimize different models based on performance and pricing. Ensure proper governance and change management within your organization. The above features of SAP Copilot-Joule will greatly simplify business operations across the SAP suite.
