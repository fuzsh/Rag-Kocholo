It was sticking through its face and out its shoulder.\"\n\nMudd said the animal was \"walking around like it was no big deal.\"\n\nMudd contacted Colorado Parks and Wildlife and was advised to put the rabbit in a box and bring it to their office.\n\nHowever, once wildlife officials saw the rabbit, they knew it should be put down.\n\n\"We recommend euthanasia for any animal that is suffering and will likely not survive or recover on its own,\" Vogrin said.\n\nOfficials now investigating how and why the rabbit ended up with an arrow in its body.\n\n\"If someone shot it for sport, there might be a case for harassment or animal cruelty. Or it could be an illegal take, as it is out of season,\" Vogrin said.\n\nHowever, Vogrin said there are some instances where it would not be considered a crime.\n\n\"Rabbits are classified on the list of nuisance species. If it was on private property and causing damage, there are regulations in place that a landowner can utilize to legally take it.\""
