During running, the peak force increases to 3-fold over the static force ( FIGS. 2A and 2B ).\n\na suspended-load ergonomic-backpack has been developed that dramatically reduces the dynamic forces on the body (e.g., 82-86%) and consequently reduces the metabolic rate for carrying the load (e.g., by 40 W for a 60 lb load), providing the ability to carry significantly greater loads for the same metabolic cost (5.3 Kg more).\n\nthe suspended-load ergonomic backpack of the invention can be used to transport loads more quickly and more comfortably at running speedsâin contrast with a conventional backpack where running with a heavy load is essentially impossible.\n\nthe suspended-load ergonomic backpack with such attributes includes shoulder straps, a load storage bag (pack body) for accepting a load to be carried by the backpack; and a suspension system having a first portion connected to the shoulder straps and a second portion connected to the load storage bag.\n\nthe suspension system incorporates a compliant mechanism that permits the second portion of the suspension system and the load storage bag to move up, relative to the first portion of the suspension system, when a gait of a wearer of the backpack causes the first portion to move downward relative to the ground and to move down, relative to the first portion of the suspension system, when the gait of the wearer of the backpack causes the first portion of the suspension system to move upward relative to the ground, thereby reducing up and down motion of the load relative to the ground during the gait of the wearer of the backpack.\n\nthe compliant mechanism comprises a bungee cord connected on one end to the first portion of the suspension system and on another end to the second portion of the suspension.\n\nthe bungee cord is routed over low-friction pulleys so that the bungee cord is stretched a lower percentage of the stretch at equilibrium.\n\nthe first portion of the suspension system includes a first frame that has vertical rods for accepting bushings that move up and down the vertical rods.\n\nthe second portion of the suspension system includes a second frame connected to the bushings for permitting the second portion of the suspension system to move relative to the first portion of the suspension system by virtue of the bushings moving on the vertical rods.\n\nthe first and second frames are preferably formed of very light materials such as aluminum tubing.\n\nthe first frame comprises at least two vertical rods connected to each other by a horizontal bar\n\nthe second frame comprises an H-frame comprising vertical rods connected to the bushings and a horizontal bar connecting the vertical rods of the H-frame.\n\nthe load storage bag is ideally connected to the vertical bars of the H-frame, while the compliant mechanism is connected to the horizontal bar of the H-frame.\n\nthe compliance of the compliant mechanism is selected to prevent resonance with the up/down movement of the load.\n\na natural frequency of the compliant mechanism is below a frequency of up/down movement of the second frame relative to the first frame or the step frequency of the wearer.\n\na compliant mechanism is selected that may dissipate energy so as to prevent resonance as a result of up/down movement of the second frame relative to the first frame.\n\nthe compliant mechanism also may be connected to a top and a bottom portion of the first portion of the suspension system to increase its spring constant.\n\nthe suspension system may also include adjustment means, such as a cleat, for adjusting the stiffness of the compliant mechanism by, for example, adjusting the length of the bungee cord between the first and second portions of the suspension system.\n\nthe suspension system may connect directly to the shoulder straps or through an interface assembly that connects the first portion of the suspension system to the shoulder straps and/or a hip belt so as to permit adjustment of the shoulder straps and/or hip belt to the suspension system based on trunk length of the wearer.\n\nFIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate that during walking at a fast pace, the peak force can increase to almost 2-fold larger (1.7 fold is shown) than the static or average force as a result of the load oscillating with the movement of the wearer.\n\nFIGS. 1C and 1D illustrate the reduction in the force on the wearer when walking wearing the backpack of the embodiment of FIG. 7 .\n\nFIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate that during running, the peak force can increase to almost 3-fold larger over the static force as a result of the load oscillating with the movement of the wearer.\n\nFIGS. 2C and 2D illustrate the reduction in the force on the wearer when running wearing the backpack of the embodiment of FIG. 7 .\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a suspended-load day pack in accordance with the invention.\n\nFIGS. 4A-4C respectively illustrate side, front and bottom views of the ergonomic suspension system for the day pack of FIG. 3 .\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates the portion of the harness portion that connects to the suspension system for supporting the backpack on the wearer via shoulder and optionally waist straps.\n\nFIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate an embodiment in which the moving portion of the frame is a plate with slots for mounting the load storage bag.\n\nFIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate an ergonomic backpack mounted on an external frame in accordance with another embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate the embodiment of FIG. 7 with a fan for dissipating the excess mechanical energy and cooling the wearer.\n\nFIGS. 9-13 illustrate alternative embodiments of the frame assembly of the suspension system of the invention.\n\nFIG. 14 illustrates how the optimal diameter of the bungee cord is determined for use as the compliant mechanism.\n\nFIG. 15 illustrates a backpack in exploded view that is adapted to connect to H-framed moving portions of the backpack suspension system.\n\nFIG. 16 illustrates the panel portion for connecting the shoulder strap assembly to the suspension system of the backpack of FIG. 15 .\n\nFIG. 17 illustrates an exploded view of the backpack of FIG. 15 where the connection to the suspension system is more apparent.\n\nFIG. 18 illustrates an embodiment of a backpack for carrying golf clubs and having reduced forces on the shoulders of the golfer.\n\nFIGS. 1-18 A detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1-18 . Although this description provides detailed examples of possible implementations of the present invention, it should be noted that these details are intended to be exemplary and in no way delimit the scope of the invention.\n\nthe suspended-load ergonomic backpack of the invention reduces the dynamic forces on the body by suspending the load from the backpack frame. Then, as the frame moves up by 5-7 cm during a step of the wearer, a compliant coupling is designed to stretch by a similar distance. This principle has been historically exploited by Asian merchants running with springy bamboo poles as described by Kram in an article entitled âCarrying Loads With Springy Poles,â Journal of Applied Physiology , Vol. 71(3), pp. 1119-22 (1991). To achieve this condition in the more compact backpack, a long compliant coupling is introduced for attaching the load to the frame. As the frame moves up 5 cm with the hip, the load moves downwards within the frame the same distance, thereby stretching the coupling by 5 cm.\n\na coupling is selected such that the 5 cm stretch represents only about 10% of the distance stretched at equilibrium.\n\nbungee cords 20 are used that stretch 50-70 cm when a 60 lb mass is attached.\n\na 1 â 2 inch bungee cord was run over five low friction pulleys 40 , traversing a frame of a suspension system 30 two and one-half times as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 7 .\n\nthe backpack also may be fitted with a lock 210 that, when engaged, converts the suspended-load ergonomic backpack into a conventional rigid backpack.\n\nthe ergonomic backpack of FIG. 7 has been found to reduce the accelerative force by 82% during walking as shown in FIG. 1D as a result of the limiting of the absolute movement of the load relative to ground as illustrated in FIG. 1C .\n\nThis not only reduces the forces on the shoulders, but also reduces the downward force on the body and hence the upward ground reaction force. This has two effects. It reduces the force on the joints and also reduces mechanical energy losses.\n\nthe lower mechanical energy losses reduce the actual metabolic power need for walking with a load. For example, while carrying a 60 lb load, there is a reduction in 40 W metabolic power. Hence, a wearer of the suspended-load ergonomic backpack of the invention will be able to walk using a smaller metabolic rate.\n\nthe suspended-load ergonomic backpack of the invention reduces the accelerative forces by 86% during running.\n\nRunning or jumping with heavy loads is extremely harmful to joints. For instance, soldiers in Iraq often break their ankles jumping out of trucks with a heavy backpack. This is even more of a problem from high distances during training. In fact, running any distance with a large weight often results in knee and ankle injury because the of the 3-fold higher forces experienced (see FIG. 2B ).\n\nthe suspended-load backpack of the invention permits running with backpacks with significantly reduced forces on the body (see FIGS. 2C and 2D ), which is very useful for first responders, disaster relief and military applications. Further, even if more conventional equipment must be used during the actual mission, the suspended-load backpack provides an excellent tool for training, where considerable injury can occur.\n\neach embodiment is characterized by a suspension system from which the load is suspended whereby the load moves relative to a portion of the frame attached to the body so as to limit movement of the load in the vertical plane relative to ground during walking or running.\n\neach embodiment of the invention preferably includes one or more (preferably all) of the following characteristics:\n\nany friction affecting the load such as rubbing against the wearer's body, will lead to less counter-movement of the load with respect to the frame, and hence larger displacement with respect to the ground and therefore larger accelerations and higher forces. It is desirable that the load move with low friction to reduce the displacement with respect to the ground and to thus minimize the forces applied to the body. This is can be achieved a multitude of ways by connecting the load to the frame via bearing races, bearings around a rod ( FIG. 3 ), using wheels, or by using a lever system that principally allows the load bag to move vertically with little side-to-side motion.\n\nSuspending the load with respect to the frame using a compliant coupling permits the 5-7 cm displacement of the load within the frame (and hence stretch of the coupling), with no more than 10-15% increase in force over and above the static weight. This keeps the forces on the body low and prevents resonance (i.e., provides low stiffness, K). This can be achieved by lacing a bungee cord over pulleys in several lengths of the backpack frame and utilizing low friction pulleys as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 7 , for example. It could also be achieved using a torsional spring at the top and other spring arrangements known to those well-versed in the art.\n\nthe rubber in a bungee cord as well as in its covering dissipates a small amount of energy, which helps prevent resonance. If the material is not dissipative (e.g., metal springs) a small amount of friction can be added into the system if necessary to dissipate some energy to prevent resonance.\n\nWalking occurs with a step frequency of about 1.3 Hz.\n\nthe frequency increases to over 3 Hz during running.\n\nthe natural frequency of the coupling system of the backpack ( â K/m, where k is the spring constant (stiffness) and m is mass) should be set at 1 Hz or below.\n\na low k is equivalent to a high compliance.\n\na lower frequency is achieved by using only a compliant coupling from the top. In some configurations, it may be necessary to dampen the compliant coupling during running; however, with different couplings in different configurations, dampening of the coupling may not be necessary.\n\nthe illustrated suspended-load backpack 10 includes a suspension system 30 including a compliant coupling, such as the illustrated bungee cord 20 wrapped around low-friction pulleys 40 to allow the load to move relative to the fixed portion of the suspension system 30 .\n\nthe suspension system 30 is connected directly or indirectly to shoulder straps 50 (and optionally waist straps 160 as shown in FIG.\n\nthe suspension system 30 comprises a suspension cassette containing the compliant coupling, for example, a bungee cord 20 that is run over several low friction pulleys 40 to get the length necessary for the large compliance as noted above.\n\nthe suspension system 20 also includes bushings 70 that run up and down vertical rods 80 . Vertical movement of bushings 70 on vertical rods 80 is limited by stops 90 at the top and bottom of the vertical rods 80 .\n\na moving plate 100 made of a light, but sturdy, materials such as aluminum is connected so as to move up and down with the bushings 70 as they slide on the vertical rods 80 as a result of the load in the load storage bag 60 connected to the plate 100 using slots 140 (see FIGS. 4B and 6 ).\n\na fixed plate 110 may optionally be provided on the side of the suspension system 30 facing the wearer. Fixed plate 110 prevents the wearer's clothing from interfering with the operation of the low-friction pulleys 40 and bungee cord 20 .\n\nthe entire suspension system 30 may optionally be encased in a cloth mesh or plastic cover 120 on the top, bottom, and sides so as to further prevent frictional contact with the low-friction pulleys 40 and bungee cord and to prevent mud, sand, and the like from affecting the operation of the pulleys 40 .\n\nthe cover 120 is stripped away for ease of illustration.\n\na frame structure 130 is optionally provided to support the suspension system 30 and to connect the suspension system 30 to the shoulder straps 50 .\n\nthe frame structure 130 may contain pads 150 at points of contact with the wearer. Also, as shown in FIG. 5 , the pads 150 may provide connection points for the shoulder straps 50 and waist strap 160 .\n\nthe suspension system 30 may connect directly to the shoulder straps 50 and/or a panel integral with the shoulder straps 50 as illustrated in FIG. 16 , for example.\n\nthe suspension system 30 which, in an exemplary embodiment, is sized to squeeze down to less than 3 inches in thickness so it can easily fit into lockers at school, for instance. In such an embodiment, frame structure 130 would need to be bendable or removed altogether.\n\nthe embodiment of FIG. 7 is based on a backpack having an external frame 220 .\n\nthe suspension system 30 of the embodiment of FIG. 7 is similar to that of the embodiment of FIG. 3 except that the moving frame portion 200 and fixed frame portion 240 of the suspension system 30 are designed to be very light weight. Exemplary arrangements of the suspension system 30 are described below with respect to FIGS. 9-13 .\n\na cleat 230 is used to clamp the bungee cord.\n\nthe cleat 230 makes it possible to adjust the spring constant for different weights and stiffnesses by adjusting the length of the bungee cord 20 and cleating it in place.\n\na jam cleat ideally with a fair lead\n\na bungee cord has different properties than a rope, making cleats less effective for bungee cords than for rope (the elasticity of compressed rubber makes it pop out of some devices), particularly for large sizes.\n\na toothed cam device used both in sailing and rock climbing and derived from ascender and self-belay devices used in rock-climbing\n\na winch type device are most effective.\n\nthe spring stiffness is in theory separable from the length of the bungee cord 20 .\n\nthe spring constant of the bungee cord 20 may be changed by connecting the bungee cord 20 to the top and the bottom portions of the fixed frame portion of the suspension system 30 so that the portions of the bungee cord 20 on either side of the load will pull against each other.\n\nAn automatic method of adjustment of the stiffness of the suspension system 30 may be preferable, particularly for children who may not have the dexterity to adjust one of these devices for different conditions.\n\nthe principles illustrated above can be applied to any type of load carrying device in use for profession or sports. For example, it has become common for runners or long distance trekkers to run with backpacks carrying water, food, and potentially clothing. Running backpacks are generally made to attaching tightly to the body, hence the load must be accelerated on every step. However, if the load were suspended in accordance with the invention so that it stayed at nearly a constant vertical height and would not have to be accelerated on every step, then a significant reduction in forces would be achieved. To reduce such forces, the backpack of the embodiments of FIGS. 3-6 or 7 may be used with the addition of a frictional device to take out a bit more energy than is dissipated in the compliant coupling. For example, the embodiment of FIG.\n\nFIG. 8 shows the addition of a rack 300 and pinion 310 that drive a fan 320 .\n\na generator may be used to generate electricity.\n\ncleats 230 allow the runner to adjust the compliance of the bungee cord 20 based on the running speed of the runner, for example.\n\na locking mechanism 210 also permits the wearer to prevent the oscillation of the load by locking down the suspension system 30 , as when the wearer is at rest.\n\na completely mechanical system would also work. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 8 , the mechanical force from the moving load could be transferred to fan 320 which could cool the runner as he or she runs.\n\nthe amount of energy removed from the system can be adjusted to optimize either ergonomics or electricity-generation based on the use. For example, a more effective system for electricity generation can be achieved by adding a coupling at the bottom as well as on the top of the frame of the suspension system 30 . As noted above, by stretching both the top and bottom coupling against each other (while keeping the load in the center of the travel), one can adjust the spring constant to maximize the power output while walking or running at a given frequency.\n\nthe backpack can be converted from an optimized ergonomic backpack into a near optimal electricity-generating backpack in the field by simply employing the bottom coupling and turning on the generator to remove electricity.\n\na coupling at the top is typically used.\n\nthe kinetic energy of the load need not be dissipated at the same time; instead, the load can simply move down inside the frame and the kinetic energy can be stored in the compliant coupling over a longer time.\n\nFIGS. 9-13 illustrate variations on the design of the suspension system 30 , particularly the compliant coupling mechanism.\n\nthe fixed plate 110 of the embodiment of FIG. 3 is reduced to top and bottom bars 400 that form a frame with vertical rods 80 .\n\nthe moving plate 100 is reduced to an H-shaped section including vertical rods 410 connected to bushings 70 and a horizontal bar 420 that connects the vertical rods 410 and is connected to the bungee cord 20 or other compliant mechanism as illustrated.\n\nFIG. 10 illustrates an embodiment of the suspension system 30 similar to that illustrated in FIG. 9 except that the compliant mechanism includes a spring 430 that provides a large compliance without having to utilize a very long bungee cord 20 , for a large compliance requires a large displacement for a small change in force.\n\nFIG. 10 shows the familiar block and tackle.\n\na cord or cable 440 is run through a series of pulleys 40 before connecting to the H-frame crossbar 420 .\n\nthe force is set by the stretch of the spring 430 .\n\nthe length of the cord 440 undergoes a length change of, for example, 6 centimeters.\n\nthe system thus has a 6-fold higher compliance (1 â 6 the stiffness) than the compliance of the spring 430 by itself.\n\nthe stiffness is adjusted by pulling the cord 440 against the spring 430 and cleating it using cleat 450 .\n\nFIGS. 11 and 12 show a device that achieves a similar effect using a lever 610 connected to cords or cables 600 to provide the large length change.\n\na small stretch in the spring 630 will be accompanied by a much longer vertical displacement of the H-frame, based on the ratio of the distance the attachment points of the cords 600 routed over low-friction pulleys 620 on the lever 610 as compared to the axis of rotation of the lever.\n\nthe spring force is adjusted by using a rotating threaded piece 635 which threads itself down the spring 630 , thereby adjusting how many coils are active.\n\nthe spring 630 is replaced by a portion of bungee cord 640 , whose length is adjusted by cleating it at different lengths using cleat 230 .\n\nFIG. 13 illustrates an embodiment of the suspension system 30 where the load 60 is connected to the vertical rods 80 via levers 610 on each side thereof, much like jalousie windows.\n\nthe levers are connected to the vertical rods 80 using springs 650 that have lengths and stiffnesses designed to provide the requisite degree of vertical displacement of the load 60 based on vertical displacement of the vertical rods 80 as a result of walking or running motion by the wearer.\n\nthe key to minimizing accelerative forces in accordance with the invention is for the load to stay at the same vertical height with respect to the ground as the backpack frame, which is connected to the hip, undergoes a 5 cm fluctuation in height off the ground.\n\nthe load would move downwards within the frame the same distance, thereby keeping the load at the same height. This would also result in stretching the bungee cords by 5 cm.\n\nbungee cords are chosen such that the 5 cm stretch represents only about 10% of the distance the bungee cord was stretched against the static load.\n\nbungee cords are chosen since they may be stretched approximately 50 cm or more beyond their resting length when the load was attached while still operating in the linear portion of the stress-strain curve.\n\nHooke's law an additional stretch of 5 cm (during walking) would not increase force by more than 10% of the load.\n\nFIG. 14 is a theoretical graph of the force versus stretch length illustrating this point. Under these conditions an extension or shortening of the cord by 5 cm will result in about a 10% change in force. To achieve this condition there are several considerations. First, the bungee cord must stretch by at least 50 cm to support the load, and hence the bungee cord must be quite long. In the embodiment of FIG. 7 , for example, the overall stretched length of the bungee cord 20 is about 1.8 m. Of course, this cannot fit within the 67 cm backpack frame height in a single pass. To accommodate the long coupling, the 1 â 2 inch diameter bungee cord was run over two low friction pulleys, traversing the frame 21 â 2 times. Hence, as noted above, the length of the cord is one consideration.\n\nthe diameter of the bungee cord 20 is the correct width, the force-diameter curve is linear, as shown in FIG. 14 (top panel). However, if the bungee cord 20 is too thin, then the strain becomes too high and reaches the non-linear portion curve of the rubber or other material as shown in FIG. 14 (middle panel). Hence a 5 cm change in length stretched would result in a larger alteration in force. (Note that the material covering the bungee cord affects its stress-strain relationship as well.) If by contrast, the bungee cord 20 is too thick, then for a given length of bungee cord the length stretched would be too short as shown in FIG. 14 (bottom panel).\n\nthe compliance of the suspension system should be adjustable.\n\na characteristic of a compliant suspension is that a small change in force causes a large change in position. If one adds or removes a pound or two to the load storage bag, the suspension will either bottom out or top out. Hence, it is desirable to be able to readjust the compliance based on the weight of the load. As noted above, bungee cords may be stretched and cleated and offer a very simple way to achieve this adjustability.\n\nFIG. 15 illustrates an alternative technique for connecting the pack body 60 to the H-shaped frame in the embodiments of FIGS. 9-13 .\n\nthe pack body 60 is connected on respective sides thereof to the vertical rods 410 using molded plastic integrators 700 and 710 that are snapped onto corresponding bearing attachments of the vertical rods 410 .\n\nthe molded plastic panel interface assembly 720 ( FIG. 16 ) may then be connected to the fixed portion of the frame including vertical rods 80 and crossbars 400 , provided the interface assembly 720 does not interfere with the movement of the bushings 70 on the vertical rods 80 .\n\nthe shoulder strap assembly 50 ( FIG. 16 ) is then connected to the interface assembly 720 .\n\nFIG. 17 illustrates an exploded view of the backpack of FIG.\n\nthe load storage bag 60 is connected to the molded plastic integrators 700 and 710 for attaching the load storage bag (pack body) 60 to the vertical rods 410 of the H-frame.\n\nthe H-frame attaches to bearings 70 on the vertical rods 80 of the fixed frame between the pack body 60 and the suspension system 30 .\n\nthe interface assembly 720 bolts to bearing rods of vertical rods 80 and the bearing rods are placed so as to allow a full range of motion of the bearing housings of the bushings 70 .\n\na flange 800 at the lower end of the interface assembly bolts to the lower bar 400 of the fixed frame.\n\ncompression molded foam and air mesh suspension panel 810 including shoulder straps 50 and optionally waist straps 160 is mounted to the interface assembly 720 via vertical holes 730 in the interface assembly 720 by screwing the shoulder straps 50 into one of the holes 730 in accordance with the trunk length of the wearer.\n\na very useful application of load suspension is for a golf bag.\n\nModern golf bags are often worn in a backpack configuration-with two straps going over the shoulders.\n\nthe suspension system of the invention in between the straps and the club container 900 as illustrated in FIG. 18 , one obtains a suspended-load golf bag.\n\nGolfers can wear the backpack of FIG. 18 as they moving along the golf course and the suspension system 30 will reduce the peak accelerative forces felt by the wearer.\n\nThose skilled in the art will also appreciate that it is further possible to use a stiffer suspension as described above and to generate some electricity to keep cell phones and iPods charged up as the wearer moves along the course.\n\nthe lock on the suspended load may be designed to engage automatically.\n\nmicrogenerators may be used to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy.\n\nother suspension mechanisms may also be used. For example, one might use an array of air-filled cylinders or pistons as a sheet of roller bearings between the fixed part of the pack (against the wearer's back) and the suspended load.\n\nthe frame elements may comprise aluminum tubing.\n\nthe suspension system of the invention may be used to facilitate carrying of any of a variety of loads on the back of the wearer.\n\nfiremen may use the suspension system to carry water, hoses, and/or tools used to fight fires, particularly forest fires.\n\nthe loads themselves could be any size or shape and the load storage means need not be a bag but may have any suitable size or shape in accordance with the load to be carried. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not intended to be limited to the preferred embodiment described above, but only by the appended claims.\n\nLandscapes\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nChemical & Material Sciences (AREA)\n\nCombustion & Propulsion (AREA)\n\nMechanical Engineering (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nToxicology (AREA)\n\nPurses, Travelling Bags, Baskets, Or Suitcases (AREA)\n\nPortable Outdoor Equipment (AREA)\n\nUS11/957,222 2003-03-17 2007-12-14 Suspended load ergonomic backpack Active 2025-01-05 US7931178B2 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US11/957,222 US7931178B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2007-12-14 Suspended load ergonomic backpack\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (6)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title US45547703P 2003-03-17 2003-03-17 US10/803,112 US6982497B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2004-03-17 Backpack for harvesting electrical energy during walking and for minimizing shoulder strain US11/056,849 US7391123B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2005-02-11 Backpack for harvesting electrical energy during walking and for minimizing shoulder strain US87509206P 2006-12-14 2006-12-14 US87523806P 2006-12-14 2006-12-14 US11/957,222 US7931178B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2007-12-14 Suspended load ergonomic backpack\n\nRelated Parent Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US11/056,849 Continuation-In-Part US7391123B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2005-02-11 Backpack for harvesting electrical energy during walking and for minimizing shoulder strain\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date US20080185411A1 US20080185411A1 (en) 2008-08-07 US7931178B2 true US7931178B2 (en) 2011-04-26\n\nFamily\n\nID=39537020\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date US11/957,222 Active 2025-01-05 US7931178B2 (en) 2003-03-17 2007-12-14 Suspended load ergonomic backpack\n\nCountry Status (5)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US7931178B2 (cs) EP (1) EP2094126B1 (cs) AU (1) AU2007333874B2 (cs) CA (1) CA2674230C (cs) WO (1) WO2008076932A2 (cs)\n\nCited By (14)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20100308095A1 (en) * 2008-11-21 2010-12-09 Ricky Hon Hung Lam Backpack with an intelligent automatic adjusting inflation aircushion and a pneumatic shock absorber system US8172117B2 (en) 2009-11-02 2012-05-08 C&P Hiam Associates LLC Stable backpack US20140339275A1 (en) * 2013-03-15 2014-11-20 Donald James Krikorian Carrier for sports and other equipment KR20150000143A (ko) * 2013-06-24 2015-01-02 ëì°ì¡°ì í´ì ì£¼ìíì¬ ì°©ì©ê° í¥ìì ìí ì°©ì©ë¡ë´ì ë±í ì¡°ë¦½ì²´ ë° ê·¸ ì°©ì©ë°©ë² US20150076195A1 (en) * 2013-07-19 2015-03-19 Jeremy Nathan Coleman Articulating Backpack Frame US20160360865A1 (en) * 2015-06-14 2016-12-15 Shinji Marui Portable bag with adjustable inner container WO2018089712A2 (en) 2016-11-09 2018-05-17 Randall Alley Load distribution systems and load carrying equipment US10383427B1 (en) * 2018-04-10 2019-08-20 Ralph Walker Backpack support device US10441442B2 (en) 2015-08-07 2019-10-15 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
