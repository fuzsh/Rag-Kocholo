        "text": "[ ] Yeah, it’s definitely – it’s actually climate record also, because you have snowfall, of course, being precipitated on the surface of the ice, and then you have layers upon layers being compacted. So if you try to drill through these ice sheets, it’s actually going back in time, and just like tree rings, you can count out as individual years of precipitation. So it can go back thousands of years and understand what happens in terms of precipitation change and climate change, also going back in time. So that’s the direct measure on the ice sheets themselves within the ice… But you can also look at previous extent of ice sheets and see how they grew from the Northern latitudes and spread on Northern America and the European Lowland, and you can see how it just drastically reshaped the surface during previous glaciations.\n\nWe know from the past that these ice sheets can really cause massive change on a global scale, and we’re trying to wrap our heads around exactly how that happens, physically speaking.\n\nI work on improving the physical mechanisms and physical parameterizations in these ice sheet models. I’m sitting in front of the computer, trying to understand and model this system to a better degree than we can do today… So specifically what I’m working on at the moment is the fact that the glacier is actually not really governed by how the ice itself flows.\n\n[ ] You probably both know that glaciers and ice sheets move from high altitudes to lower altitudes, because ice is a viscous fluid. But it’s actually not to a primary extent the ice flow itself that really controls how the ice sheet moves and why it moves in the patterns that we see… But instead, it’s actually sediments like sand, and clays, and gravel, and stones at the base that are very weak, because we have a lot of melt water down there. So these sediments are actually breaking, and what we see on the surface is actually an expression at the base of the ice sheet of where these sediments are failing and where they are weak, and where they actually are contributing to lubricating the glacier flow.\n\nThese physics are actually not very well understood, and more or less not included in the models that we today use to quantify the sea level rise in future climate scenarios. So the estimates that in the year 2100 say that we will have maybe half a meter of sea level rise, maybe one meter of sea level rise, they are based on more primitive models… And it’s really hard to exactly quantify these maybe less or maybe more important mechanisms such as the one that I’m working on.\n\nWe really have to be smart about our computing, and we have to be very efficient also, because the computation costs are just very, very large. I’ve worked a lot with GPU computing, and it’s really painful, I have to admit, but there is also a lot to be gained when you have something that’s working, and working efficiently.\n\nWhat I find maybe - I don’t know if “ironic” is the right word; maybe unfortunate… It’s that here we have this need for advanced technical research in order to improve our abilities to make these models, to get accurate predictions and results, and we have a field of academics who are bumping up in your case against these technical hurdles of what is really kind of a – ancient is not the right word… But old-school, non-technical field of sharing and publishing, and all the things that you think “These people should be bleeding edge, because they’re on the bleeding edge of their research.” Well, it turns out the scientists aren’t software people. I mean, not in every case. And there’s just like tons of Academia, and may I say bureaucracy in certain cases…\n\nThere’s lots of reasons – same thing with the government publishing of open data that belongs to the citizens, and it’s in formats that are inscrutable… That seems like a terribly unfortunate circumstance, where it’s like “You’re just wanting to do your research, but now you’re writing your own tooling in order to collect that information you need in certain cases. Is that just the state of the world? What are your thoughts on that?\n\nWell, I specifically had the problem that it was hard to – or it took a lot of time to get all the publications together that I would need to have access to during my research. Often, when you are stepping into new research areas, you need to spend a lot of time to sit down and really check the literature.\n\nI would say pretty much anybody who has gone online and tried to look for papers and so on - they’ve probably felt frustrated at some point… Because the web pages of many of these publishers are just horrible. They are extremely bloated, and slow, and you have to often struggle to find PDF download links… Because PDFs are still a good way to just having precise copies of papers on your own machine. And every publisher is different in exactly how they set up their web page, and so on… So I’ve found that to be quite a struggle.\n\nI chose to spend a little bit of time to sharpen my toolset and build something that could help me get around all of these issues and streamline the workflow… And I guess many of your listeners are probably the same way. We probably all have a set of dotfiles which we just very much value and continuously tweak in order to just get rid of little hurdles that might occur every day in our workflow.\n\nYeah, so I’ve been working on something similar for a little while, and I just decided to properly wrap this up so it could be more useful for me and maybe others as well. That’s what gave birth to the Scholarref Toolset. It consists of a few tools which can be chained together. They’re written in an old-school way. They’re based on the Unix philosophy, so everything should be text-based, and each tool should do one thing and do it well.\n\nThe idea is that there are different tasks that are common in this kind of work. One task is, as you mentioned, Jerod, you need to get a reference for a publication. Say you read a nice paper and you want to cite it in a paper that you’re writing. Most journalists use something called LaTeX, and you would need to get something called a BibTeX reference. The traditional way is to go to the journal web page, download the text reference in this BibTeX format, which is kind of like JSON, but not exactly… And you would then put it into your own bibliography, which is just a massive text file, paste it in there, and then cite it from your LaTeX document.\n\nThe problems with that kind of workflow are actually many. As you mentioned, I’m not a fan of the journal web pages, as I wrote in the blog post, but also there are more practical issues in terms of the formatting of these references. So even though they share this common BibTeX format, they’re actually very different in content. For instance, the author’s first name might be written out, or they might be abbreviated, and often journals that you want to submit your own paper to will only accept one type of author styling. And the same goes for the journal name. That also needs to have a consistent style… So there are a lot of things that you need to go through once you get a hold of this reference from the journal webpage.\n\nI’ve found out that there’s this API publicly-available, which I can simply query from a search query. That actually works really well. Alternatively, I also make it possible to just feed in a PDF document. One of these tools in the Scholarref Toolset will try to extract the UI, which is the unique identifier for that publication. So you’re not getting any kind of wrong results. The last thing you want is to get the reference for the wrong publication, and even worse is if you don’t manage to actually correct that mistake before submitting.\n\n[ ] I’ve tried to make these tools modular so in some instances you might only need the UI of the publication, in other instances you might need the full reference in a consistent format… And finally, in some cases, you might actually need the PDF itself.\n\nAnother benefit from keeping these tools really minimal and simple is that they are quite portable, so they have very minimal dependencies on the host system, which makes them easier to distribute. And secondly, it also makes it possible to work with them from your favorite editing environment. For instance, I’m a guy that likes to stick to old-school terminal text editors, vi specifically. And there are [unintelligible ] set of keys and get the reference in a very convenient manner. You can do that in pretty much any editor that you can think of, because these are just shell scripts, so that just makes them much more portable than many other solutions.\n\nSure. POSIX is a standard which really exists to create a common platform for these computing interfaces. Back in the day you had quite a few different Unix variants, and many of these would have their own implementations of basic tools, and they start with different options. For instance, the GNU toolset, which is common now in Linux distributions, is really expanded with a lot of command options and so on that are not necessarily the norm on other systems. So if you want to have something which is really portable beyond just a specific environment, you need to adhere to the broadest common standards, and those would be the POSIX standards for scripting and for the different tools in the Unix environment. So that’s why I chose to go with those tools.\n\nAlso, something like just a POSIX shell is much more rapid than a more complex shell interpreter like Bash, or ZSH, or something like that. So by keeping it minimal and adhering to these strict standards, you should also get very good performance, besides the portability… So that’s a definite advantage.\n\nThe other decision that you have to make, which you have made, is when to formalize a project and make it a public thing, make it an open source, available thing. Many of us have random scripts laying around on our machines; I know I’ve written plenty of things that will never see the light of day… And sometimes you write them just enough to take the pain away, but not enough to take other people’s pain away… And so you know, then you never get the limelight, you never get to come on the Changelog, but you have your own little scripts. I’m curious, what was the process of writing these? Did you have it formalized for a long time, or you just didn’t have the help text? What made you eventually say “Okay, this is very useful for me. This can help out hundreds, thousands, who knows how many other researchers out there. Feeling these pains, I’m gonna go ahead and put the extra effort in.” Because even a thing that’s almost ready for the public is not ready for the public. A lot of the window dressing, so to speak, is the effort, as you probably realized in this project, if you haven’t had other open source projects. So when did you decide to formalize it and take it public?\n\nYeah, so I have a couple of thoughts on this. First of all, we should note that GitLab because of this - it was self-hosted, it was supposed to be federated with regards to collaboration… There’s been Gitorious, there’s been other software projects that were basically like “What if we had GitHub’s niceties without the GitHub?” Of course, GitLab has turned into another large corporation that services the enterprise, and I think so far their open, social, public side has not taken off like their enterprise side has – or, I should say, like GitHub’s has… Many hackers out there running their own instances of Git, for sure, and they just make that trade-off.\n\nI do agree, to a certain degree, Anders, where what GitHub and the bringing together of all the developers in one place has provided for projects is visibility and casual contribution niceties… But software collaboration was happening before at GitHub, you just didn’t see it, because it was emailing patches around, it was behind the scenes, and it wasn’t quite as public.\n\nI think to a certain degree, people who are serious and benefitting from the software, and already understand Git tooling - they can get around the hurdles, that is “This is a non-GitHub setup.” That being said, you’re probably missing out on some people who would contribute, but aren’t, and may start off as a casual contributor and turn into a more serious one.\n\nI was curious, Anders, if your move off of GitHub was around the Microsoft purchase, or if it was before or after that; if that was a major contributing factor in your move away.\n\nOne thing that’s fascinating - of course, we’ve tracked the acquisition of GitHub by Microsoft since the day it was announced, and we’ve had many people on the show since then, and different reactions… And my personal reaction thus far - it was kind of a wait and see, and now we’re a couple of years into it, and I think in terms of the product that is github.com, it has improved dramatically since then. I feel like the relationship between the corporation and the community has improved in many ways since then… So I’ve seen mostly positives from that acquisition.\n\nThat being said, there are casualties along the way. Adam, I interviewed Ned Batchelder for our Maintainer Spotlight series, Ned told me a story of a guy who was like a – I told you about him; he was like this traveling contributor… Remember that? He would pick a project for three months or so, and he would contribute to that project heavily, not casually. He’d get all into it, he’d make major contributions, and then he’d move on to the next project. It’s just the way he did open source, which was very unique. And his name is Loïc Dachary, I think is how you say his last name in French; a French fella.\n\n[ ] And Ned had benefitted from his contributions and was just kind of singing his praises, and I said “We should get Loïc on the show.” And the other day I went looking for Loïc, and he’s not on GitHub. I couldn’t find him. I found his website, and he left GitHub. Similar to Anders, he closed his account… And his was specifically the day Microsoft acquired GitHub; he was gone.\n\nI’m curious if he’s still doing open source. He’s not doing it on GitHub like he was, so there’s definitely been downsides along the way.\n\nI think similar in nature, in the way you might do what Anders does here, which is research glaciers for this deep data; you can sort of hypothesize where things are going based upon past, present, and potentially the future… People are doing similar aspects of that towards open source, and then also GitHub. What suffers from this is, I would say, the improvement to software, and then as an effect of that, the human race, because our lives change and get better or worse because of new software in our world to do different things, or in this case do research… You sort of get to this point where the loss really is at the open source level. GitHub is there, trying to do one thing – and this is totally not even a GitHub show, gosh…\n\nBut anyways, we’re in this mix here where you have this sort of love/hate for this corporation that owns it… And I’m kind of with you, Jerod; I didn’t have the same opinion at first, but when you said “Let’s wait and see”, I said “I agree. Let’s wait and see.” And I think most of the things that have come from it have been fairly positive… But what you see is – and I’d love to talk deeply with Anders and others, like Loïc, to see what specifically has their open source life been like since leaving GitHub, and is it worth the loss that the software/community/open source would benefit from to leave, to not participate.\n\nBecause everyone’s there. And when I say “everyone”, it’s only in masses, not everyone. The critical mass is there, so you, Anders, and others, have decided to not participate.\n\nYeah, definitely. And as long as people have an interest, like yourself, in sciences and what’s going on there, there are definitely a lot of contributions that can be made by people like you.\n\nFor instance, a lot of the modeling tools that are out there under open development - I’d say the far majority of them are developed openly. And a simple contribution to some of these models could be to take a look at the source code, and just check it out and kind of get a feeling for what’s going on.\n\nThey often have quite good documentation also, that kind of helps developers or people that look into the source code to try to understand how it all works… And maybe you find something that’s missing, maybe you find something that you as a person with your background could contribute to maybe the development, or maybe the code itself… Maybe a way of optimizing some kind of algorithm, maybe you know a lot about a certain set of test tools…\n\nFor instance, it’s pretty easy to get things up and running on Travis and similar CI platforms, so it doesn’t necessarily take a lot of effort to get different models up and running on these testing frameworks. That allows the developers behind these models to really make much more clever development as they go, because they can see if the intended changes do the correct thing that they wanted to do.\n\n[ ] So there are a lot of things that maybe people with purely developer backgrounds can contribute just from their skillset to these kinds of models and communities… So we’re all opened arms in that regard, and I think people would be very well welcomed to that community."
