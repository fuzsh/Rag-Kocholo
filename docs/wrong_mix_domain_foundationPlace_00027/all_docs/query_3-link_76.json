        "text": "UPDATE (April 8):\n\nAccording to Revlan Hill, the executive director for the Harrisonburg and Rockingham Community Foundation, the fund has raised a total of $195, 504.\n\nJust over $100,000 in grant funding will be distributed this week to these local organizations: Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, Lacey Spring Community Food Pantry, Emmanuel Episcopal Church Food Pantry, Valley Program for Aging Services, The Salvation Army Harrisonburg Corps, New Community Project/Vine & Fig, Hope Distributed Community Development Corporation, Church World Service Refugee Resettlement, Elkton Area United Services, Way to Go, Inc., First Step, Harrisonburg Rockingham Child Day Care Center, Second Home Learning Center and Open Doors.\n\n______________\n\nThe United Way of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County has partnered with the Harrisonburg and Rockingham Community Foundation to create a COVID-19 Response Fund.\n\nThe fund is aimed toward granting money to local non-profits that help to meet basic human needs like providing food, medication and shelter for people impacted by the pandemic.\n\nRevlan Hill, the executive director for the Harrisonburg and Rockingham Community Foundation, said that they are hoping that people who are still employed and not as impacted by the pandemic will donate.\n\n\"I mean, can you imagine: thinking about waking up, there's no money coming in to buy food, to pay utilities, to pay rent,\" said Hill.\n\nLaura Toni-Holsinger is the executive director for The United Way of Harrisonburg and Rockingham and said that the goal is for the funds to help in the short term and long term since the pandemic is such a fluid situation.\n\n\"This is the rainy day a lot of people have been saving up for, you know, you never want it to rain, and you don't want those days to come, but we're in it right now, and so if you're in a position where you are able to give generously, maybe more generously than you were before, I would encourage you to do that,\" said Holsinger. \"We certainly don't want to deplete everyone's charitable resources, but at the same time, it's raining. So, I encourage people to give where they can.\"\n\nSo far, the groups have raised around $140,000 and hope to see the number continue to grow. They are encouraging individuals, businesses, civic groups and families to put funds together and give.\n\nYou can donate\n\nor by mailing a check to:\n\nThe Community Foundation\n\nP.O. Box 1068\n\nHarrisonburg, Va 22803\n\nIn another part of the Shenandoah Valley, the United Way NSV (Northern Shenandoah Valley) announced on Friday that they've launched a COVID-19 Relief Fund in which they'll match, dollar-for-dollar, $50,000 in donations for emergency funds.\n\nThose relief funds will go directly to COVID-19 response and relief efforts, including meeting people's needs for food and food supplies, prescription and medical supplies, paying mortgage payments or rent, car repairs or payments, utility payments, child care, and more.\n\nAll funds collected by the United Way NSV will stay in the Northern Shenandoah Valley, helping families in Winchester City, Frederick, Clarke, Shenandoah and Page Counties. You can donate to their fund at\n\n."
