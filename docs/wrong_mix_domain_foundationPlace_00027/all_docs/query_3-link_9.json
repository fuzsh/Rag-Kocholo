        "text": "Dubai, 8 January 2019 – CharterPad, an online tool for air charter professionals, has been acquired by Click Aviation Network, a global network of aviation partners specialising in trip support services.\n\n“This is an important step in our exciting journey. It enriches Click’s Collective Intelligence and places a network of opportunities in the hands of operators and charter brokers,” said Aiham Bader, founder and CEO of Click Aviation Network.\n\nCharterPad is an air charter search platform headquartered in the U.S. The company was founded in 2011 and runs a member business model, promoted as The Global Jet Charter Exchange.\n\nCharterPad’s platform enables operators’ available fleets to appear on the Trip Board, a proactive and innovative flight search tool that allows users to filter by trip types, dates, and route. Other features of the tool include virtual assistance, trip alerts, aircraft search, company profile access and an airport locator.\n\nWith a live database of over 20,000 aircraft available worldwide for charter and cargo, CharterPad offers versatile digital solutions to charter brokers and operators through one, user-friendly tool.\n\nEhsan Shaheen, co-founder and CIO of Click Aviation Network said: “We are certain that Click Aviation Network and its Omega technologies will greatly benefit CharterPad members, as well as the entire ecosystem as a whole. We are proud to be building upon a foundation that will serve the aviation community for years to come.”\n\nCharterPad’s buyer, Click Aviation Network, developed a similar platform in 2016, called Click Omega. While this platform also offers a database of information, available around-the-clock in one digital location, Click Omega takes this concept one step forward through the added value of Click’s networking concept.\n\n“We celebrate the recent acquisition of CharterPad by Click Aviation Network, as we bring these two companies together to allow our clients to expand beyond the shores of the United States and enable a direct link to every charter operator, broker, FBO, ground handler, catering company and other aviation professional that is within Click’s network,” added Jason Johnson, CharterPad CEO.\n\nClick Aviation Network is built on the concept of global connectivity in the aviation industry, designed to enhance efficiency and reduce risk through innovative solutions. Through the platform, users can gain access to a network of aviation professionals and utilise their combined expertise to carry out flight planning, ground handling, aircraft charter, catering and other aviation-related activities at greatly reduced costs.\n\nAcquiring CharterPad further expands Click’s ability to serve the North American market while enhancing CharterPad’s existing capabilities and potential for growth in the coming years.\n\nArmando Antonini, president of ChaterPad said: “We couldn’t be more excited about joining forces with Click Aviation Network and to accomplish our shared vision of connecting the private aviation industry through intelligent technology. Their expertise in creating operational efficiency will only enhance our service offering for our members buying and selling aircraft charter around the world.”\n\nCharterPad’s current customers will see improvements in the existing system that incorporate a new layer of artificial intelligence software for enhanced efficiency. The transition is expected to be seamless, with no major disruptions or loss of existing data for CharterPad users.\n\nJason Johnson and Armando Antonini, CharterPad’s current CEO and President, will remain on the CharterPad board while welcoming Click CEO Aiham Bader as Chairman and Click CIO Ehsan Shaheen as CTO."
