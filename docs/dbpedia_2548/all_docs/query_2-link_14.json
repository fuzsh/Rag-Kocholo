        "text": "Explorance is dedicated to protecting the data our customers entrust to us. This Privacy Policy outlines in clear and simple terms our approach to information security and data protection. It has recently been expanded to meet and exceed the requirements for the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and continues to uphold the regulations of other countries and states.\n\nOur privacy policy governs both our sales & marketing practices and products & services. We have separated these two topics on this site to make it easier for you to find the information you are looking for. In both cases, we describe what information we collect, how it is used, our lawful basis for this usage, how we keep it secure, and your rights and the rights of all users of our products and services.\n\nSales & Marketing\n\nWhat information do we collect?\n\nWe collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey or fill out a form. When requesting information or registering on our site, you will be asked to enter your name, e-mail address and/or phone number. You may, however, browse our site anonymously. Additionally, we use Google Analytics to track website usage metrics. Please see our cookie policy for more details.\n\nHow do we use this information?\n\nThe information we collect from you may be used to respond to a request for more information, personalize your experience, improve our website and customer service, and send you periodic emails such as newsletters, company news and related product information. All such email communications from Explorance will offer the option to opt-out of any similar notifications.\n\nWhat is the lawful basis for using this information?\n\nThe primary basis is known as “legitimate interests”, that is, we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not infringe on your rights and interests. The second basis is to support our contractual obligations with our customers.\n\nHow is your data kept secure?\n\nWe use world-class software systems to securely store all information collected from our website and other sources related to sales and marketing. As well, Explorance has several internal data security policies and programs, including a direct marketing policy, an information security and data protection policy, a breach notification policy, and a company-wide security awareness training program. These policies are reviewed on a regular basis by our data protection governance team.\n\nIs your data shared with third-parties?\n\nNo information collected through our website is sold to or shared for use by third parties. Information collected on our website is stored in secure systems and is accessed only by authorized personnel. However, we may release your information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others rights, property, or safety.\n\nWhat are your rights?\n\nIn addition to the right to know how your data is used and who it is shared with (which is covered above), your rights include the right to know what personal information we have collected, the right to receive a copy of that data, the right to make corrections, and to request that it be deleted. For all such requests, please contact your account manager or send an email to privacy@explorance.com. We will be happy to address any concerns you have and assist in any way we can.\n\nProducts & Services\n\nWhat information do we collect?\n\nThe set of personally identifiable information is defined by our customers (aka “controllers”), and is typically demographic data associated with the recipients of evaluations and surveys provided by our products.\n\nAdditionally, we collect and store certain types of information through passive collection tools, such as cookies and encrypted authentication tokens. Cookies are small text files placed on your computer which our products can retrieve later.
