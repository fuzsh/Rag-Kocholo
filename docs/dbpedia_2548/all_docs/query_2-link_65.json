        "text": "What is assessment for learning?\n\nAssessment for learning (AFL) is an approach to teaching and learning that creates feedback which is then used to improve studentsâ performance. Students become more involved in the learning process and from this gain confidence in what they are expected to learn and to what standard.\n\nOne way of thinking about AFL is that it aims to âclose the gapâ between a learnerâs current situation and where they want to be in their learning and achievement. Skilled teachers plan tasks which help learners to do this.\n\nAFL involves students becoming more active in their learning and starting to âthink like a teacherâ. They think more actively about where they are now, where they are going and how to get there.\n\nEffective teachers integrate AFL in their lessons as a natural part of what they do, choosing how much or how little to use the method. AFL can be adapted to suit the age and ability of the learners involved.\n\nAFL strategies are directly linked to improvements in student performance in summative tests and examinations. Research shows that these strategies particularly help low-achieving students to enhance their learning.\n\nAFL and the relationship with formative and summative assessment\n\nTraditionally, AFL has been closely associated with formative assessment because practices such as questioning and providing feedback help âformâ or âshapeâ student learning. This differs from summative assessment which typically is an attempt to measure student attainment at the end of a period of learning.\n\nThe following table, based on the UKâs National Foundation for Educational Research report (NFER 2007), classifies types of formative and summative assessment as either formal or informal.\n\nIt can be argued that all of the assessment strategies in this table support AFL if their ultimate use is to help the student progress in terms of their learning.\n\nA good example of using a summative assessment strategy in an AFL context is where a test or exam is used to identify a lack of understanding (e.g. in a particular area of the syllabus) and subsequently targets are set to rectify this.\n\n\"In AFL, it is the purpose of assessment, rather than the nature of it, that is important.\"\n\nThere are five main processes that take place in assessment for learning:\n\n(i) Questioning enables a student, with the help of their teacher, to find out what level they are at.\n\n(ii) The teacher provides feedback to each student about how to improve their learning.\n\n(iii) Students understand what successful work looks like for each task they are doing.\n\n(iv) Students become more independent in their learning, taking part in peer assessment and self-assessment.\n\n(v) Summative assessments (e.g. the studentâs exam or portfolio submission) are also used formatively to help them improve.\n\nIn the rest of this unit, we will look at the basics of AFL in more detail. We will examine the theory behind AFL and some of the misconceptions that people often have. Then we will focus on some practical strategies you can use in the classroom. We will also hear from both learners and teachers about their experiences of AFL in the classroom.\n\nThroughout the unit, you will be encouraged to reflect upon AFL and to think about how you can integrate it into your own classroom practice. At the end of the unit there is a glossary of key words and phrases.\n\nIn this video, teacher trainer James Woodworth discusses the relationship between assessment for learning and assessment of learning:\n\nTranscript\n\nWhat is the theory behind AFL?\n\nAFL helps in making understanding and knowledge, as John Hattie describes it, âmore visibleâ. AFL helps learners understand what excellence looks like and how they can develop their own work to reach that level.\n\nFeedback has a positive effect on learner achievement. In John Hattieâs seminal work on educational effectiveness, Visible Learning for Teachers (2011), Hattie ranked feedback strategies 10th out of 150 factors that bring about significant improvements in learner outcomes. This was particularly true if the strategies involved feedback about the learnerâs own work.\n\nBlack and Wiliam argue that if teachers use formative assessments as part of their teaching, students can learn at approximately double the rate. Hattie's research also shows that using formative assessment in the classroom brings about real-world differences in learner achievement.\n\nAttribution theory\n\nAttribution theory says that people explain their own successes or failures to themselves in different ways. Some factors that lead to success or failure are controllable and some are not.\n\nExamples of factors that a learner might feel able to control include how much effort they make and how interested they are in the subject. Non-controllable factors include luck or the amount of help the learner receives from the teacher.\n\nLearners who take part in self-assessment (as part of AFL) learn to attribute failures to controllable factors. For example, a learner doing badly on a homework assignment might realise that they focused on the wrong subject matter. Because the choice of subject matter was in their control, they can review, edit and improve the work. Being in control in this way will boost the learnerâs confidence and achievement.\n\nMetacognition\n\nMetacognition is a term used to describe âthinking about thinkingâ and supports the idea of self-assessment. Metacognition suggests that all learners need to be able to reflect on their own learning, to understand how they learn best and to reinterpret any new knowledge, skills and conceptual understandings that they have acquired.\n\nLearning happens when students are given opportunities to build upon previous knowledge and experiences. Research consistently shows that only telling learners what they need to know is much less effective than helping them construct meaning for themselves.\n\nWant to know more?\n\nIn this video, Dylan Wiliam talks about his work on AFL and how it helps to improve learner achievement.\n\nWhat are the benefits of AFL?\n\nAFL improves learner outcomes\n\nResearch shows that effective formative assessment is one of the most important contributors to success in summative assessment. This is because learners have a clear idea of what good work looks like and what they need to do to reach this standard.\n\nAFL increases confidence\n\nAFL helps create a sense of self-efficacy (a learnerâs confidence in their ability to reach targets through hard work and determination). This is an essential quality for learners to develop. Self-efficacy will help them succeed throughout their life, both professionally and personally.\n\nA student who receives a poor grade for a test may withdraw from learning, preferring to be thought âlazyâ rather than âstupidâ. With an AFL approach, teachers give learners task-specific feedback that focuses on the work rather than ego-specific feedback that focuses on personal qualities of the learner. This encourages every learner to feel that they can improve. You can find out more about different types of feedback in this article from the American Psychological Association http://www.apa.org/education/k12/using-praise.aspx\n\nAFL techniques, such as peer feedback, can help more able learners to reinforce their learning by explaining ideas to less able classmates. Furthermore, peer feedback helps learners to develop diplomacy and communication skills that will be essential in many aspects of later life.\n\nAFL increases independence\n\nAFL enables learners to become less passive in the classroom, especially when combined with other methods that promote this type of approach, such as active learning techniques. Students will develop the ability to assess themselves and to take responsibility for their own learning. This supports the development of the Cambridge learner attributes which says that Cambridge learners are confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. An AFL approach also helps students to become enthusiastic life-long learners.\n\nAFL also helps teachers. When students are taking a more active role in their learning, teachers have more time to talk to them individually. In addition, teachers have more time to reflect on what is going well in their lesson and what can be improved.\n\nAFL changes the culture of the classroom\n\nCarol Dweck argues that high-achieving learners avoid taking risks because they are afraid of making mistakes. This reduces the amount they can learn. An AFL approach helps to create a supportive and cooperative classroom. In this environment, everyone, including the teacher, should feel able to try new things without worrying that they might fail. If the teacher presents mistakes as an opportunity for learning, this will help every student to reach their full potential. Students will start to see that by learning from failure, they can improve outcomes in the future.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this video, teacher trainer James Woodworth discusses some of the benefits of using AFL strategies in the classroom.\n\nTranscript\n\nAssessment for learning in practice\n\nAFL emphasises the creation of a learner-centred classroom with a supportive atmosphere, where students are not afraid to make mistakes and learn from them.\n\nWe are going to look at five approaches or strategies that you can use in a lesson or programme of study.\n\n1. Questioning\n\nQuestions are a quick and important way of finding out what your learner understands about a subject. You can use this information to plan their teaching.\n\nThere are two main types of question: closed and open.\n\nA closed question requires a short answer, such as remembering a fact. The answer is usually right or wrong.\n\nFor example, a Geography teacher might ask: âWhat is the capital of Peru?â\n\nOn average, teachers only wait 0.9 seconds after asking a question before taking an answer from a learner. Mary Rowe suggests that increasing âwait timeâ to three seconds improves the quality of answers.\n\nOne way to help increase âwait timeâ, and to ensure the whole class is actively engaged, is to ask your learners to write down the answer to a closed question on a piece of paper, mini whiteboard or tablet, and hold it up. This immediately gives you feedback about who understands, who does not, and therefore what the next steps in the learning might be.\n\nA good strategy to use if a learner gets the answer wrong is to make this into a positive event. You could say: âIâm glad you said that, as Iâm sure lots of other students have the same misunderstanding.â\n\nIn an AFL classroom, finding out what learners do not know is as valuable as finding out what they do know. This knowledge will help you to see what material your learners need to spend extra time on to make sure that they all understand.\n\nOpen questions need longer answers, and often require the learner to provide an opinion.\n\nE.g. A Physics teacher might ask: âWhat will happen to the flow of water through a hose pipe if a smaller nozzle is fitted to it? Explain how this relates to the study of voltage, current and resistance in a simple electric circuit.â\n\nOpen questions like this allow all learners to try to answer the question and be part of a discussion. You can then facilitate this discussion, asking questions to develop the discussion such as âTell me more about thatâ and âWhy do you think that?â\n\nâDialogic teachingâ is a term that describes on-going talk between teachers and learners, which leads to effective learning. If you discuss ideas with your learners, you can get a clearer view of what understanding your learners have about a topic, and put right any misunderstandings.\n\nReflection\n\nWatch the video of a teacher talking about how he uses questioning. Do you use any of these techniques in your own classroom?\n\nTranscript\n\n2. Feedback\n\nFeedback is the process in which learners come together with their teachers to discuss where they are in their learning, where they want to be in their learning, and how they are going to get there. It usually involves looking at a particular piece of work done by the learner. Feedback can be described as the âbridgeâ between teaching and learning.\n\nThe aims and objectives of any assignment must be clearly understood by both the teacher and the learner. You can help by providing âsuccess criteriaâ before your learners start work.\n\nFeedback might involve marking. However, a learner may only remember the mark/grade and not act on any comments to improve their work. In an AFL classroom, a teacher will give âcomment onlyâ feedback on their learnersâ work. If you do want to add a grade, give this later on, so that the learners read the comments before they receive the grade. Effective feedback depends on task-focused comments, rather than ego-focused comments.\n\nHere is an example of ego-focused feedback: âGreat work Melanie, the best in the class.â This kind of feedback can make strong learners complacent, thinking that they do not have anything to do to improve. They might also be scared of trying something they find difficult in case they lose their high place. Weak learners can feel as if there is nothing they can do to get better.\n\nYou should aim to provide feedback to each learner that praises task-focused aspects of their work, but also contains targets about how to improve their learning.\n\nE.g. âAli, you have written a good introduction to your story. Now, can you think how you can make the description of the main character more striking?â\n\nReflection\n\nThink about a time when you gave feedback to a learner that could be described as more ego-specific than task specific. What might you have done differently?\n\nWant to know more?\n\nIn this video, Dylan Wiliam explains why task-focused feedback is more effective than ego-focused feedback.\n\nThere are some good examples of how to give effective feedback in different subject areas on http://www.teachthought.com.\n\nIn this handout, by the RAPPS project, you will find lots of suggestions for different ways of giving classroom feedback.\n\n3. Peer assessment or peer feedback\n\nPeer feedback, or peer assessment, is the process by which learners assess each otherâs work and give each other feedback. This feedback is based on an understanding of what makes a successful piece of work. The teacher is vital to this process, as teachers know their learners and can help them to develop their critical and reflective thinking skills.\n\nGiving learners independence is a great way for them to take responsibility for their own learning. Peer feedback also helps learners to develop their social skills and to use higher-level skills such as thinking critically and analytically.\n\nA successful peer feedback session requires learners to 'think like a teacher' for each other. Each learner will apply the success criteria to another learnerâs work, and make value judgements based on these. The learner then has to give their partner ideas for how to improve the work. In doing this, they will both be increasing their own understanding of what makes a successful piece of work.\n\nAt primary school level, the theory behind AFL is the same, but the tasks might be different, to reflect the different stages of the pupilsâ cognitive development. For example, learners could use pictures to describe positive and negative aspects of the work.\n\nReflection\n\nWatch the video of learners taking part in a peer feedback session. Notice how independently they are working. Would this be effective for your learner?\n\nTranscript\n\nWant to know more?\n\nIn this video, learners explain what they like about peer feedback.\n\nTranscript\n\n4. Self-assessment\n\nâStudents need to learn for themselves how they move up to the next level â¦ they need to internalise the process. Learning cannot be done for them by the teachers.â (Mary James, 1998)\n\nIn self-assessment a learner evaluates their own work, and thinks about their own learning. This helps them to make sense of what the teacher says, relate it to previous learning and use this for new learning. Ultimately, self-assessment enables learners to set their own learning goals and be responsible for their own learning. However, be aware that learners cannot become reflective learners overnight. It takes time and practice to develop these skills, and the role of the teacher is crucial in encouraging this.\n\n\"Students need to learn for themselves how they move up to the next level.\"\n\nIntroducing learners to self-assessment\n\nWhen you introduce self-assessment to your learners, carefully guide the process. To start with, give learners a list of questions to ask themselves, and write down the answers. Starting a âlearning logâ or âreflective journalâ is good practice. This is a notebook in which the learner documents their recent experiences, asking themselves questions such as:\n\nâWhat made sense and what didnât?â\n\nâHow does this subject fit in with what I already know?â\n\nâWhat did I do well and what could I have improved?â\n\nIdeally, you will talk to each of your learners individually to guide their thinking until they feel comfortable with the process. Self-assessment is an activity which requires one-to-one tutorials to be fully successful. In these short sessions, you can ask questions to help your learners to reflect on their studies.\n\nHaving thought about how their work could be improved, your learners can then set themselves targets to make their work better. These targets can cover any aspect of learning, from time management to asking more questions in class if they do not understand something.\n\n5. The formative use of school tests and exams\n\nThis âGetting startedâ guide has focused mainly on formative assessment strategies and checking learning in the classroom. However, learners often have to take summative school tests such as end-of-year exams or final exams.\n\nReturn marked test or exam papers to learners, so that they can spend time understanding where they earned most marks and where they had misunderstandings.\n\nAfter the exam or test, find out which questions were answered less well by most learners. This will give you important information about what subjects, ideas and skills your learners need to work on. You can then focus on explaining the areas of the syllabus that gave problems to most learners. Your learners could also re-work exam questions in class in pairs or groups as a peer-learning activity.\n\nwww.headguruteacher.com explains in more depth how internal school tests and exams can be used to maximise learning.\n\nNext steps: Four ideas to put into practice\n\nWhat is the best way to get started with AFL? Here are four straightforward ways to introduce AFL into your teaching.\n\nTry out as many of these activities as you can. Afterwards, reflect on your experiences and consider how you can develop the technique to fit into your regular teaching schedule.\n\n1. Questioning and discussion: Think Pair Share\n\nWhat is it?\n\n'Think Pair Share' involves posing a question to learners and giving them a few minutes to consider their response on their own. Then each learner discusses their ideas with a partner before the conversation is opened to the whole class.\n\nThis strategy encourages all learners to get involved in classroom participation. It gives them time to formulate their own ideas as well as an opportunity for all learners to share their thinking with at least one other learner. Furthermore, it encourages learners to listen to each otherâs ideas, and helps them to understand different viewpoints.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nYou can use this routine after asking the class any open question. For example, after reading a chapter of a book, the teacher asks all learners to reflect quietly on a question about it for one or two minutes. During this time learners record their own ideas on paper.\n\nNext, the teacher instructs them to turn to their neighbour, or a small group of neighbours, and discuss the question for several minutes. This time they record their pair or groupâs thoughts. Then, the teacher calls on several pairs to tell the class what their ideas were.\n\nThe first time you try this technique in class, scaffold your learnersâ pair or group discussions by reminding them to listen to each otherâs ideas and to ask questions of one another. A useful technique to make sure that your learners really listen to each other is to tell them that they will have to explain their partnerâs ideas to the class. The records of learnersâ ideas can be displayed in the classroom for all learners to share.\n\nHarvard's Project Zero has more information about 'Think Pair Share'.\n\n2. Feedback from the teacher: Comment-only marking\n\nWhat is it?\n\nWhen marking learnersâ homework assignments, give a constructive comment instead of giving a grade and a comment (or only a grade).\n\nWhat happens?\n\nChoose one piece of work per month on which to give detailed written feedback to your learners. The feedback should be focused on success criteria that the learners are made aware of. Include specific praise about aspects of the work that the learner has done well and give learners specific targets for improving their work. Feedback can be given orally if you prefer.\n\nAt the start of the next lesson, give back the work with the comments. Then allow time for the learners to improve the assignment, responding to your comments. After the learners have improved their work, you could give out grades so that the learners know what level they were working at.\n\n3. Feedback from the learner: Traffic lights\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis technique is a quick way to find out how confident learners feel about a new concept or skill that has been covered in a lesson.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nYou could give each learner a set of small coloured circles to hold up.\n\nAnother way of doing this with several topics or concepts would be to give your learners a handout with a grid on which they can identify their understanding level with a smiley, sad or neutral face.\n\n4. Peer feedback on an assignment\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis activity introduces learners to the peer feedback process. Learners give each other feedback about an assignment that they have just completed.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nFirst, introduce the âsuccess criteriaâ. These are the qualities that make a good piece of work such as the effective use of language or using evidence to support an argument in an essay.\n\n(The first time you try peer assessment with your class, it is useful to scaffold the activity so that your learners know what to do. Use a previous learnerâs assignment, and read this through with the class. Then ask them to rate the work, noting how much each âsuccess criterionâ was achieved.)\n\nLearners read each otherâs assignments and make notes on how much each success criterion was achieved. Then, in pairs, the learners give each other written and/or and verbal feedback, based on the success criteria.\n\nWhile your learners are giving each other feedback, walk around the class to monitor the feedback that each pair is giving. You can join in discussions to add your opinion if learners need some help giving feedback.\n\nAt the end of the session, ask your learners how they found the experience. Encourage them by praising how they have done the task and emphasise how this process takes time and practice to be effective.\n\nHere is some helpful advice for implementing AFL in your classroom:\n\nTranscript\n\nWant to know more?\n\nHere is a printable list of interesting articles and websites on the topics that we have looked at.\n\nGlossary\n\nActive learning\n\nLearning which engages students and challenges their thinking, using a variety of activities.\n\nAssessment for learning\n\nEssential teaching strategies during learning to help teachers and students evaluate progress in terms of understanding and skills acquisition, providing guidance and feedback for subsequent teaching and learning.\n\nClosed question\n\nA question that can be answered with either a single word (usually âyesâ or ânoâ) or a short phrase and the choice of answers is limited.\n\nCold calling\n\nQuestioning technique in which the teacher selects a learner at random to answer a question, instead of learners putting up their hands to answer a question.\n\nCritical thinking\n\nThe ability, underlying all rational discourse and enquiry, to assess and evaluate analytically particular assertions or concepts in the light of either evidence or wider contexts.\n\nEgo-specific feedback\n\nFeedback to the learner that focuses on their personal qualities.\n\nFeedback\n\nInformation about how the learner is doing in their efforts to reach a goal.
