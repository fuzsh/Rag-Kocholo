        "text": "Explore subjects in art\n\nThe term subjects in art refers to the main idea that is represented in the artwork. The subject in art is basically the essence of the piece. To determine subject matter in a particular piece of art, ask yourself: What is actually depicted in this artwork? What is the artist trying to express to the world... what is his or her message? And how are they conveying that message?\n\nIn this section, we'll learn about 6 main subjects that artists have been exploring in art for centuries:\n\nStill life - a collection of inanimate objects arranged together in a specific way\n\nLandscape - natural scenery such as mountains, cliffs, rivers, etc\n\nNature - a focused view or interpretation of specific natural elements\n\nPortraiture - an image of a particular person or animal, or group thereof\n\nAbstract - a non-representational work of art\n\nDay of the Dead - a Mexican holiday with a vibrant artistic tradition\n\nClick on a subject matter above to read an in-depth description and see examples of artwork focusing on that subject. You will also find a depiction of what specific mediums can achieve within that subject matter."
