        "text": "Some composition texts illustrate the “writing situation” or the “rhetorical context” as a triangle, with the three interlocking sides consisting of the reader, the writer, and the subject matter. For me, the illustration looks more like the four points of a compass. This concept is also helpful because I tend to think of a piece of writing as something that takes my reader on a journey. That piece of writing, then, ends up being something like a map; but in order for me as the writer to create the map, I need to work with a tool like a compass.\n\nAt the top of this compass (the “north” side) is my purpose for a particular piece of writing. It’s a bit like the thesis of an essay, but it makes more sense to me to think of it as “a sense of purpose”: for this piece of writing, just what is it that I really want to achieve? What is it that I want to have accomplished through the writing? And if we stick with the compass metaphor, then “sense of purpose” is what most directly and clearly drives the overall direction of the essay: I move forward in the direction that is pointed out by the compass needle, and I keep moving as directly as I can towards the destination. This doesn’t mean that I can always move in a straight line; on any complex journey, we have to swerve around obstacles or take an indirect approach. But efficiency is a good thing, and so I try to be as direct as possible.\n\nThe two compass points on the sides (the “east” and “west” points) are the reader and the subject matter. They are important in helping me figure out where “north” (my sense of purpose) lies. If I drift too far towards either reader or subject, I’ll get off course. I always need to keep in mind what my reader knows and needs to know. I need to figure out the sequence of steps (as I move northwards) that will be the most successful ones to help the reader make that journey in the same way that I am making it. Is the route clear? Logical? Interesting? What kinds of directions does the reader need in order to follow me on this journey? How much detail needs to go into that map?\n\nMy reader may already know this territory a bit, and so I don’t want to provide needless detail. At the same time, the reader may never have been here before and need somewhat more guidance. The writing needs somehow to create a map that works for both readers.\n\nAnd I also need to keep my subject matter in mind. I need to respect the complexities of that subject so that I don’t misrepresent it – by oversimplifying or distorting. I need to give my readers a sense of the fullness of that subject, although of course my piece of writing doesn’t simply copy the subject (if it’s a piece of literature), since the readers could otherwise just read the literary piece themselves.\n\nFinally, at the “south” point of the compass comes the writer. Each writer has a different sense of style, a different agenda and interests. But if I focus too much on my own style and my own interests, I’m sort of looking in the opposite direction from where I really want to go. I can get too hung up on my sense of myself as a writer, and that might lead me to create an overly artificial style, to give the sense that the writing is too forced. I don’t want to be self-conscious, I want to be purpose-conscious. At the same time, I need to keep in mind (and maybe at the back of my mind) what I can actually accomplish as a writer, what I’m capable of doing with the written word.\n\nSo those are the different compass points, although I’m also suggesting a kind of hierarchy here: sense of purpose is the most important, sense of self as writer is least important. This compass certainly won’t always lead me in the right direction, but it works a lot of the time."
