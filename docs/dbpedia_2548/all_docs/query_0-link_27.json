        "text": "Saint Mary Magdalene was a Jewish woman who, according to texts included in the New Testament, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers. She is also said to have witnessed Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.\n\nIn The Da Vinci Code, Mary Magdalene was depicted of being royal descent (through the Jewish House of Benjamin) and was the wife of Jesus, of the House of David. After Jesus's Crucifixion, she fled to Gaul, where she was sheltered by the Jews of Marseille. She gave birth to a daughter, named Sarah. The bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene became the Merovingian dynasty of France.\n\nLong after Mary Magdalene's death, the Catholic Church has suppressed the truth about Mary Magdalene and the Jesus bloodline for 2000 years. This is principally because they fear the power of the sacred feminine in and of itself and because this would challenge the primacy of Saint Peter as an apostle.\n\nDocuments that testify to the bloodline and were uncovered by the Crusaders after they conquered Jerusalem in 1099. The Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar were organized to keep the secret."
