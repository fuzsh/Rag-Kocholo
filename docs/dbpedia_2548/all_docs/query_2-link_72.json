        "text": "What is subject matter in photography and how can you use composition to better define the subject in your photos? Many years of practical photography, and lots of research along the way, enables me to describe and illustrate this fundamental, yet quite profound image making consideration.\n\nThe term subject matter in photography relates to the primary focal point (i.e., point of interest) onto which the photographer's lens is focused. Popular examples of subject matter in photography includes people; structures (e.g., buildings, cars); flora; and fauna.\n\nA more artistic approach to photography may involve the distinction between object, as a visual element within the frame, and the message, story or compositional element or elements that the image explores, which become the subject of the photograph.\n\nTechnique, composition and the relationship between the subject and background need to be considered to convey the feeling or mood the photographer wants to explore in the final image.\n\nTechniques you can employ to clearly define the primary subject matter in your photos include the following:\n\nLighting\n\nWhite Balance\n\nSharpness\n\nMovement\n\nDepth Of Field\n\nSubject in Photography\n\nTo help us better understand the importance of subject in photography let’s deconstruct the above photo.\n\nI photographed this old ship, now no more than a rusting hulk, in the Beagle Channel near the city of Ushuaia in the far south of Argentina.\n\nThe orange color of the ship is illuminated by the gentle sunlight and presents a striking contrast against the predominantly bluish light from gathering storm clouds.\n\nAs we’ll discover this photo explores notions of both subject and object in photography and shows how important composition is to making great photos.\n\nHighlighting Subject in Photography\n\nThe term complimentary can be used to describe the notion of opposites in photography.\n\nFor example, there’s the relationship between primary colors and the complimentary colors that sit directly opposite them on the color wheel.\n\nWe can describe that particular relationship as follows:\n\nPrimary and Complimentary Colors\n\nRed and Cyan\n\nGreen and Magenta\n\nBlue and Yellow\n\nJust as opposites (e.g., male and female) attract and can form harmonious relationships, so to can seemingly disparate elements within the frame.\n\nIn the case of the photo at the very top of this post you can see the warm (i.e., orange) and cool (i.e., blue) colors within the scene and how well those colors compliment each other.\n\nThe cool colors seem to make the warm colors even warmer.\n\nYou might even say that complimentary colors seem to vibrate against each other producing, as a result, a more dramatic image.\n\nWe can describe this relationship between warm and cool colors in this particular photo as being high in color contrast.\n\nColor is so important in this image that I think it’s just as much the subject matter as the ship, mountains, sky and water.\n\nFrom a story telling or narrative point of view there's also a range of other contrasts within this image that are worth exploring.\n\nIt's these kinds of dualities (i.e., opposites) that give our images an added dynamic and a greater sense of visual potency. For example:\n\nThe man made ship within the natural landscape\n\nThe smoothness of the water and sky against the highly textured rock\n\nThe hardness of stone and ship compared to the smoother areas of water and sky\n\nSubject Matter and Meaning\n\nA large part of the creative journey involves self discovery. By understanding what your photos are about you’ll be more able to understand your own, unique worldview.\n\nWhile the photo of the old ship contains both natural and man made subject matter, I'd argue that it's the characteristics (e.g., warm and cool, hard and soft) inherent within those elements that become the most important subjects within the picture.\n\nThe primary object depicted is the old, rusty ship. The story being told involves the fact that the ship is now in an otherwise pristine, natural landscape.\n\nTo enhance that narrative I’ve employed color, shape and surface textures to visually engage the viewer and bring them into the story.\n\nThe theme that follows concerns damage to our environment and, arguably, explores how all man made objects (eventually) return to nature.\n\nSubject versus Object In A Photo\n\nA critical question which needs to be addressed is the difference between subject and object in photography.\n\nAn object is a visual element within a photo, while the subject of that photo is what the image is actually about.\n\nExamples of objects that might inhabit part or all of the photographic frame might include the following:\n\nFace\n\nBicept\n\nTree\n\nSky\n\nTextile\n\nFood\n\nEyes\n\nMoon\n\nObjects that appear to visually dominate within the scene could also be considered to be focal points (i.e., points of interest) in the photograph.\n\nAs a consequence they deserve attention in the overall composition.\n\nIt might be helpful to recognize that, while the notion of object (e.g., flower) is usually indisputable, what the photo is actually about is often somewhat subjective.\n\nTake a look at this image of a flower in the Calcutta Botanical Garden in Howrah, just over the majestic Hooghly River from Kolkata.\n\nThe flower is an object which, if you care to, you might further define by its species.\n\nHowever, at a deeper level, the image may suggest notions associated with nature, growth and visual aesthetics such as color, shape and repetition.\n\nUltimately, these are examples of the ideas and concepts that attract our attention and, as a consequence, become the subject of our photographs.\n\nWhat Is Subject Matter In A Photograph?\n\nThe term subject matter deserves consideration. But what is subject matter and how does the photographer make use of subject matter to produce a compelling image?\n\nHow would you define subject matter?\n\nWhat is the actual subject of a particular photograph?\n\nWhat does a photograph explore and, ultimately, what is it about?\n\nIf you’re wanting to move beyond the snapshot and embrace your creativity through the art of photography it’s a very useful exercise to spend a few moments to define the notion of the subject within a photograph.\n\nThe way to do this is by closely analyzing the composition of a specific photo as a way of distinguishing and separating notions of subject and object within the image.\n\nNaturally you’d want to do so with some of your own photos. However, to learn a process, it’s often helpful to do so by first looking at photos that you don’t have a personal attachment to.\n\nWhat’s the Subject in a Portrait Photo?\n\nMost folks would consider the subject in a portrait to be the person being photographed.\n\nOn one level that’s certainly the case. You could take this portrait of my friend, Col Pearson, in the La Boca neighborhood of Buenos Aires in Argentina as a case in point.\n\nHowever, I’d argue that the composition has somewhat challenged the notion of what’s actually the primary subject matter in this photo.\n\nIf the composition makes you stop and explore the image, more closely than you otherwise would, then I’d say that’s a good thing.\n\nNotice how the photo has been divided, roughly, in half. How does this help the composition?\n\nThe blue wall on the left of the frame is acting a little like negative space, both contrasting and connecting with elements on the right side of the picture.\n\nThere’s a similarity between the color of the wall and the color of Col’s camera bag strap and shirt.\n\nNotice also how the yellow part of the wall acts to both divide and connect both sides of the photo.\n\nSo, while the picture is a portrait, I think that elements of composition like color, space and pattern are so pronounced in this image that they’ve become subject matter in their own right.\n\nThe photo has moved beyond mere documentation and become a much richer visual experience. I love it when that happens\n\nBut it’s still a portrait and Col is still the most important visual element within the frame.\n\nThat’s appropriate because, as it’s a rather straight portrait, I think it’s important that the composition hasn’t taken over from the primary purpose of the photo, which was to create a pleasing likeness of my friend, Col, exploring the streets of Buenos Aires.\n\nSubject Matter in Landscape Photography\n\nWhat about a landscape comprising of, for example, a relatively even mixture of rocks, water, hills and sky? Could they all be considered subject matter in the photograph?\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nIn this context the word landscape is a very broad term that would normally be considered to be a genre in photography.\n\nIt follows then that the rocks, water, hills and sky define the subject matter within the picture.\n\nHowever, depending on the composition, one element might be more of a focal point, or point of interest, than other visual elements within the image.\n\nThat would make that particular focal point the primary subject within the photograph.\n\nIn the case of a portrait photo you’d most commonly see this as a sharply defined face portrayed against an out of focus background.\n\nIn a nature photo the same technique could be used to portray a flower against an out of focus mountain.\n\nHowever, as a way of retaining as much detail as possible, most landscape photos are recorded as sharp as possible, via a large depth of field, from foreground to background.\n\nIn such cases a primary focal point might be separated from it’s surroundings in a range of ways, including the following:\n\nSubject photographed against a much darker background\n\nSubject photographed against a distant background\n\nSubject isolated from the background through the use of a telephoto lens\n\nSubject separated from the background through scale\n\nSubject color contrasts against that of the background\n\nSubject Matter and Composition In Photography\n\nFrom an artist’s point of view rocks, water, sky and people can all be considered to be objects within the frame.\n\nHowever, it’s the elements of composition (e.g., shape, texture and color) inherent to those objects that can actually become the primary focal points or subject matter in the photograph.\n\nThis was my approach when making the photo of the abandoned hulk at the very top of this post.\n\nI photographed the old ship in the Beagle Channel after the conclusion of a photography tour I co-ran to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia Island and Antarctica.\n\nSeveral members of the tour group decided to hire a couple of helicopters for a scenic flight over the mountains near the city of Ushuaia at the bottom of Argentina.\n\nIt was a brilliant flight, though I missed my opportunity for a turn in the front seat where photography opportunities were superior.\n\nTowards the end of the flight the pilot landed on a remote beach for the celebratory champagne and nibbles part of the tour.\n\nI gave that a wide birth, having more important things on my mind, and headed off to make pictures.\n\nAfter all, I can drink cheap booze from a plastic cup anytime.\n\nSubject Of A Photograph and The Color Of Light\n\nLet’s take another look at the image of the rusted hulk in the Beagle Channel at the very top of this post.\n\nIt was quite a somber day, which is evident in the predominantly blue light from the rain filled clouds above.\n\nThe color of the water is a less intense blue. That’s because it’s reflecting light from a brighter and more aqua colored sky directly above.\n\nI noticed the old ship, partly submerged, and wanted to photograph it.\n\nHowever, as the ship was a considerable distance off shore, it was going to be tricky to define the subject of the photograph as the dominant element within the frame without losing a sense of its grandness within the surrounding environment.\n\nI decided to incorporate the ship as a complimentary element within the broader landscape by exploring both harmony and contrast within the scene.\n\nSubject Matter And Duality In Photography\n\nAfter about a 20-minute stopover, during which time I made a range of photos of that rusted hulk in the Beagle Channel, we climbed back into our helicopter for the flight back to Ushuaia.\n\nWe were treated to an amazing sunset and an incredible afterglow that brought a fitting end to a wonderful adventure.\n\nAs you can see the photo, made from within the helicopter, depicts spectacular clouds illuminated by a glorious sunset.\n\nBut I’d say that the purpose of the subject matter in this image is to explore the quality of light and the relationship between earth and sky.\n\nGoing forward I’d ask you to carefully consider the power of duality and composition when exploring interesting subject matter in your own photos.\n\nI hope you’ve found this post worthwhile and that you can see the value of making visually interesting images that challenge how you define the notion of subject in the photos you make.\n\nGetting past technique and thinking about how your photos allow you to connect, at a deeper level, with the world around you is at the heart of an artistic practice.\n\nDid you enjoy this post? How to Photograph Unconventional Subject Matter is the next post in the series, which I think you’ll find particularly interesting.\n\nGlenn Guy, Travel Photography Guru"
