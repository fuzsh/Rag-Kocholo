        "text": "The components of Domain 2: Learning Environments describe conditions and qualities of environments that are conducive to learning and support student success. These aspects of teaching are not associated with the learning of any particular content but rather support the understanding of all content and attend to the social-emotional needs of students. The components of Domain 2 center on establishing a safe and respectful classroom environment and require explicit attention and responsiveness to the individual identities of students, such as race and culture, and the values of the broader community the school serves. Fostering an inviting culture for learning that focuses on student wellbeing, encourages academic risk-taking, and promotes habits and mindsets that support student success is the ultimate goal of these components.\n\nLearning environments should be supportive and challenging. Though what this looks like and how it is established varies, the components of Domain 2 describe common attributes that enhance student success in the context of school, including intentional non-instructional routines and procedures, positive student relationships and behaviors, and spaces that support instructional purposes. When students remember their favorite teachers years later, their memories are often connected to the components and elements of Domain 2. They recall the empathy and caring teachers demonstrated, their high expectations for achievement, and their commitment to students’ well-being. Students feel safe with these teachers and know they can count on them to be fair, equitable, honest, and compassionate. Successful teachers know their natural authority with students is grounded in their knowledge and expertise rather than in their role alone. They recognize that their role and their interactions with students are also situated within a larger societal context, so they carefully reflect upon their own identity and biases to better connect with students.\n\nTeachers who excel in Domain 2: Learning Environments also create an atmosphere of excitement about the importance of learning, significance of the content, and the capacity of their students to master the materials. They are themselves curious, care deeply about their subject, and invite students to share the journey of learning. These teachers affirm their students’ humanity: their culture, histories, interests, concerns, intellectual potential, and sense of purpose. They take into account the individual identities and brilliance of each student when planning and leading learning. Respectful and challenging learning environments support not only the development of intellectual skills and traits (e.g., autonomy, curiosity, academic tenacity, and reflection) but also social and emotional ones (e.g., self-regulation) that are essential to the development of the whole child, including identity and purpose development, social awareness and relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. Excellent teachers support students as they develop and practice compassion, empathy, honesty, respect for others, wisdom, courage, and a sense of justice. Through the environment, they help students learn the importance of dialogue, civility, responsibility, collaboration, and community.\n\nThe components of Domain 3: Learning Experiences describe the engagement of students in learning experiences and reflect the primary mission of schools: enhancing student learning and growth. These components are unified through a vision of students developing complex understanding, achieving goals, cultivating purpose, and participating in a community of learners. The components of the other domains provide a foundation for purposeful, engaging, and successful learning experiences. In many ways, success in Domain 3 is the direct result of success in Domains 1 and 2 in particular. Teachers prepare experiences that are grounded in deep understanding of the content, aligned with appropriate standards, designed to engage students in important work, and planned or adapted with the goals, strengths, needs, and lives of each student in mind. Learning experiences can only be consistently successful for each student when the environment, nurtured by the teacher in collaboration with students, is a space where students are affirmed and challenged.\n\nDuring effective learning experiences, students are engaged in meaningful work, which carries significance beyond the next test and can provide skills and knowledge necessary for answering significant questions or contributing to important projects. Their engagement is relevant and meaningful to them as individuals. Teachers use practices and take actions that not only advance student learning, but also affirm the humanity of their students. Through learning experiences, successful teachers build on students’ strengths and assets, support the ongoing development of intellectual habits and mindsets (such as curiosity, reasoning, and reflection), encourage the development and pursuit of individual and collective purposes, and further strengthen motivation, confidence, and perseverance. Such teachers prepare and support students to assume responsibility for their own learning, and the student initiative they expect motivates students to excel. The work undertaken through experiences in the learning community is real and significant; it is important to students as well as to teachers.\n\nTeachers who excel in the components of Domain 3: Learning Experiences have finely honed instructional skills. Their work in the classroom is fluid and flexible; they can shift easily from one approach to another when the situation demands it. They seamlessly incorporate ideas and concepts from other parts of the curriculum into their explanations, relating, for example, what the students have just learned to previous learning or real-world experience. Their questions probe student thinking and serve to extend understanding. They monitor understanding and are attentive to different students in the class and the degree to which the students are thoughtfully engaged; when they observe inattention or struggle, they make adjustments. And above all, the most successful teachers teach, model, and coach their students to take responsibility for and ownership of their own learning. When this is the case, students are the ones asking questions, maintaining the momentum of discussions, suggesting alternative approaches and new lines of inquiry, and consistently monitoring their own progress.\n\nThe components of Domain 4: Principled Teaching capture and reflect the practices of educators that extend beyond their classrooms and the learning experiences they facilitate. These activities are critical to preserving and enhancing the profession and to the success of students. Teaching is a purpose-driven profession. It is a calling. Those who take up the work have a lasting and profound impact on the lives of students. Their purpose, and the purpose of education more broadly, is not solely to impart academic knowledge; it is the intellectual and moral development of human beings who will themselves flourish and help create a just society.\n\nDedication to this work is revealed through a teacher’s ongoing, deliberate process of growth and evolution, their contributions to the school community, and their ongoing partnerships with the families and communities with whom they work. Their actions in these areas are directly connected to the components in other domains, such as knowing and valuing their students and providing safe and supportive environments that promote each student’s learning and personal development.\n\nFor teachers, success relies on an ability to reflect, recognize, and analyze strengths and opportunities. More importantly, the collective impact of teachers depends on their ability and desire to learn and grow, their resilience and determination, and the strength of their character. They ultimately measure their success by the success of students – each one – and especially the success of those whose identities and potential have not yet been affirmed or realized in schools.\n\nLike students (and all human beings), teachers are on a journey of personal development and discovery. This journey is fueled by curiosity and compassion; it requires creativity, resourcefulness, humility, leadership, and wisdom. As it relates to the work of teaching, this journey centers around students, their lives, their families, and their purpose.\n\nThe components in this domain emphasize what it means to be a full member of the teaching profession, to serve students, and to be dedicated to the collective values and goals of the school and the community it serves. Teachers who excel in Domain 4: Principled Teaching are highly regarded by colleagues and parents. They serve students’ best interests and those of the larger community, and they are active in professional organizations in school, the district, and beyond. They are known as dependable educators who go beyond the technical requirements of their jobs and contribute to the general well-being of the institutions of which they are a part, which sometimes means they question and work to change those institutions.\n\nAt its best and at its core, teaching is an act of service and moral leadership rooted in an ethic of care and focused on the success of each and every student."
