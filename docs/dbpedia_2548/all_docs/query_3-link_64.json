        "text": "I like to think of the artist statement as the wedding toast of the art world. If you wing it, suddenly youâre on the spot in front of a crowd of expectant faces, trying to put into words a relationship (between you and your art) that youâve always felt intuitively. Weâve all seen those toasts. They donât go well.\n\nBut if you put time and energy into crafting your message beforehand, youâll actually add to that crowdâs understanding of the significance of this event (your art) and help them feel all the feels more deeply.\n\nIâve been wrestling with my own artist statements for as long as Iâve been making art. And I must confess, itâs never a task I look upon with glee. This, despite the fact that I write about art for a living. But reading other peopleâs statements has taught me a lot about what works and what doesnât, and how to reverse-engineer a killer toast: a clear, concise and compelling artist statement.\n\nâ Artist and writer Sarah Hotchkiss\n\nFirst things first: What is an artist statement?\n\nIn the interest of clarity, letâs define âartist statement,â since Iâve already needlessly complicated things by introducing a wedding metaphor into the mix.\n\nAn artist statement is a not-too-long series of sentences that describe what you make and why you make it. Itâs a stand-in for you, the artist, talking to someone about your work in a way that adds to their experience of viewing that work.\n\nHere are a few things an artist statement is not: a manifesto, an art history lecture, a story about discovering art, short fiction, self-psychoanalysis, a string of adjectives, a grand theory of everything youâve ever made, or a list of your career accomplishments.\n\nYouâll be called upon to submit artist statements when you apply for residencies, grants, and sometimes, exhibition opportunities. I wrote my first substantial one when I applied to MFA programs. And hereâs the secret: even though they can be hard to write, theyâre immensely useful. It truly helps me understand my own practice to sit down every few months and translate this nonverbal solitary thing I spend countless hours on into words for a specific audience.\n\nIf youâre reading this guide and itâs not the night before an important application is due, youâre already in good shape. Artist statements take time, but they donât have to be torture. If you can get into the habit of stepping back, evaluating your work, and writing a few sentences about it, you wonât have to start from scratch when youâre down to the wire.\n\nThe brainstorming phase\n\nAll that said, sitting down and writing clear, concise, and compelling sentences about your art is daunting. So donât start with sentences. Ease your way into it with a writing exercise that feels exciting, or generative, or natural to you. A few suggestions:\n\nGather your art in one digital or physical space and really look at it. Itâs possible youâve been working on such a micro level you havenât taken a macro view in a while. What commonalities and differences do you see? Think holistically about a specific body of art.\n\nWrite out a list of adjectives that describe your work. Use both visual and tonal descriptors. Be specific and avoid art jargon. If your art follows in the footsteps of minimalism, could you describe it as quiet? Or rhythmic? Is your work funny, raunchy, messy?\n\nRecord yourself describing your art to a friend, family member, or fellow artist. Chances are youâre making statements about your work all the time. Have a studio visit coming up? Record the conversation (with the other personâs permission), transcribe the audio, and mine it for pertinent details.\n\nThink about the emotions and reactions you want your audience to come away with. An artistâs intent may have little bearing on an audienceâs interpretation, but an artist statement is one of the few places you get to nudge that audience towards your desired result. Do they learn something from your art or make new connections between disparate subjects? Are you trying to make people feel agitated, joyful, incensed?\n\nWrite a casual letter to your best friend about what youâve been up to in the studio. âDear Laurie, today I spent five hours papier-mÃ¢chÃ©-ing a cardboard version of a hamster toy. It came out looking like a first-graderâs craft project, but thatâs what I was going for. I think itâll make you laugh.â\n\nJeopardy your practice. What are the questions you hope to answer in your work?\n\nArtist statement basics\n\nSuddenly, you have a bunch of words describing your art. Now you get to pick the best ones to fulfill the very basic elements of an artist statement: what, why, and (possibly) how.\n\nWhat. Make sure to state what medium you work in (paintings, sculptures, installation, non-narrative video, durational performance, etc.). Itâs amazing how many statements donât include that basic fact.\n\nWhy. Try not to overthink this one. Look back at your brainstorms and your casual conversations. You make this work because youâre excited about it. What, exactly, are you excited about? Be confident: Your art shouldnât âhopeâ or âtryâ to do something to the viewer, it should just do it. Here is where you can also bring up, without going too far into the art historical weeds, your influences and inspirations.\n\nHow. If you have a truly unique process thatâs important to understandâor one that images canât accurately conveyâbriefly describe how you make your work. (Please note: Collage is not a unique process and thereâs no inventive way to describe it as such, even if you use the word âjuxtapose.â)\n\nBeyond fulfilling these basic âwhat, why, and howâ requirements, an artist statement can be relayed in whatever tone and sentence structure feels best to you. (I encourage the use of full sentences, as fragments sound flighty.)\n\nThatâs it! Really!\n\nRed flags, bad practices, and other traps to avoid\n\nIn my many years of reading artist statements (and gallery press releases), Iâve developed an ever-growing list of banned words and phrases. While these ways of writing may sound fancy, theyâre actually empty. And using them makes a piece of writing look lazy and nonspecific. Artist statements are particularly susceptible to these traps because we write what we think people want to hear instead of whatâs actually true to our work.\n\nYour artist statement should feel like itâs written by you, the artistânot by a critical theorist or an art history professor or a dealer or a curator. The people reading it are looking for an enriched experience of your work and proof that youâve put some thought into what youâre making. They want to hear your voiceânot that of some formulaic art-jargon robot.\n\nSo, some things to avoid:\n\nExtreme binaries. Is your work really âexamining the strangeness of both interior and exterior spaces?â Is it âboth casual and formal?â âLight and dark?â (Similarly, ask yourself, is your work truly âblurring the boundaries between text and subtext?â)\n\nLazy clichÃ©s. Only you make your artworkâso shouldnât the words you use to describe it be unique and specific as well? If you find yourself using certain words as crutches, or as highfalutin stand-ins for hard-to-articulate ideas, I highly recommend creating your own âbanned wordsâ list and keeping it somewhere handy. Then, go back to your brainstorm notes and pick out words or phrases that feel concise, fresh, and truly related to your work.\n\nâInternational Art English.â Chances are youâve seen it, read it, and felt unsettled by it in press releases, wall labels, and other peopleâs artist statements. This muddled and imprecise language seeks to elevate what it describes through nonspecific word choices, invented âspacesâ (the space of the real, the space of the dialectical), and complicated grammatical structures. For an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, propagated most intensely by the art world announcement email service e-flux, please see this fantastic article in Triple Canopy.\n\nFalse range. Does your practice ârange from drawing to sculpture to video to artist booksâ or do you simply make âdrawings, sculptures, videos, and artist books?â False range is a rampant and completely accepted form of writing these days, but the discerning reader will notice it and judge you for it. A false range creates a continuum between one thing and another when there is no actual continuum. Yes, your palette can ârange from blues to redsâ (color is a spectrum). But your influences cannot include âeverything from Wanda Sykesâ stand-up to Tamagotchi pets to tinselâ (there is no middle point between Tamagotchi and tinsel).\n\nTheory. My extremely wise friend and colleague Bean Gilsdorf, longtime art world advice-giver, says this best: âArt theory only has a place in an artist statement if it has a direct bearing on your day-to-day studio practice. Otherwise, skip it.â\n\nYou have a draft, now what?\n\nYouâve brainstormed, youâve answered the what and the why. Youâve avoided all of the above. But chances are you still have a lot of extra baggage in that statement, or itâs not striking quite the right tone, or you feel like it could be more fun to read. Now you get to edit, revise, tweak, trim, and whip that statement into shape.\n\nRead your statement out loud. Trust me, this works. As you read, ask yourself: Is it accurate? Is it descriptive? Is it compelling? Is it me? Could this statement just as easily be applied to someone elseâs work? Make sure itâs specific to what you makeâand provides a sense of who you are to the reader.\n\nLook at your art while you reread. Remember, your artist statement should be current. You donât need to sum up a wide-ranging practice from the beginning of your baby artist days to the present moment. It should reflect whatever images youâre providing alongside it. Put another way, your artist statement shouldnât be so aspirational that you talk about making room-sized installations while your images are a few small-scale watercolors.\n\nWork it into submission. Read aloud, edit. Read aloud, edit. Take a break (a day, a week), come back to it, read it aloud and ask the above questions again. Remember that this doesnât have to represent your work forever and ever. Like the U.S. Constitution, an artist statement is a living document. You can update it as often as you like.\n\nShorter is better. Being economical with words proves you know what youâre doing, that youâre confident in your work, and that you donât have to couch it in elaborate language to legitimize it. Your statement should be somewhere between 100 and 300 words in length. (This is an example of true range.)\n\nConsider your audience\n\nThe tone that you strike in an artist statement for a local group show should probably be different from an artist statement you write for a $100,000 grant opportunity. Every time you start reworking your statement, remember to ask yourself who or what this particular piece of text is for. Write a basic statement that can serve as the foundation for all future artist statements, but make sure you revisit and reevaluate for each application, exhibition, and request.\n\nIn order to truly know how your artist statement will be received, and if itâs doing the work you want it to do, you need to have other people read it. I recommend finding a diverse audience of art friends and non-art friends, family, and mentors. This statement should be as legible as possible. Tell them to be brutally honest with you and listen to what they say.\n\nHave a writer friend read your statement for typos. Have someone else read it for typos. Triple-check for typos!\n\nAnd most importantly, give the people you ask for feedback enough time to read your statement and reply to you. Do not do this: âHiiiii, this is due in an hour can you look it over for me pls thx bye!â\n\nIn summaryâ¦\n\nAs those who exercise say: no pain, no gain. Statements are hard to write, but theyâre good for you. They can help someone gain a deeper understanding of your art, feel more connected to that art and, ultimately, value it. They can make or break an application. And they can help you put words to your practice, giving you the language to understand just what youâre doing and why itâs amazing."
