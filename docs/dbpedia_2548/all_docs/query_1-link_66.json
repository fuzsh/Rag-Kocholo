        "text": "Dear friends - I am so delighted to share my latest choral project! It is an arrangement of an Acadian folksong entitled “Marie Madeleine” (more commonly classified in the French-Canadian folksong repertoire as “Une petite vache noire”). This short, lively SATB piece is loads of fun and highlights the quintessential elements of the Acadian folksong tradition: podorythmie (seated foot-tapping), diddlage (mouth music), and the spoons. But, it also stretches the tradition to include more modern elements. Don’t be fooled by thinking this is just a simple folksong. It is a challenging and complex piece that reflects the innate musicality of this long-standing Canadian oral tradition. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XTLTQlZQtM\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the language, I have created an accompanying video that helps tell the song’s funny story of a young woman, Marie Madeleine, who has a rather difficult relationship with her father’s mischievous little black cow. Dressed in a little checkered skirt and fitted petticoat, Marie tries to milk the cow but finds that it not only produces sour milk, but constantly tries to corner her. Though she manages to tie the cow up, it escapes and tosses her into a pile of manure. When she gets up, she is such a mess it takes her three days to clean herself up!\n\nI have a deep interest in folksong because each song contains a history: sometimes cultural, sometimes personal, sometimes both. For instance, the Acadians are a French-speaking diasporic community who largely live in Canada’s east coast provinces. During colonial times, the Acadians were deported from Canada by the English in small groups beginning in 1755. Though many returned after a seven-year exile, some Acadians found new home, including those who are the ancestors of the Cajuns in Louisiana.\n\nThis folksong can be found in other parts of French Canada, but I chose to feature the Acadian dialect in this rendition because it is emblematic of the role that language plays in creating social inequity. Acadian writer and historian, George Arsenault, generously helped me to include various elements of the Acadian dialect. Due to their colonial past, the Acadians have a different sense of history and linguistic identity to that of the Québecois. This piece shines a light on the social and linguistic stratification of the Acadians who – up until more recent years – were thought to be ‘lesser’ in social status than other Canadians.\n\nThis song is part in my family story. It often was sung by my father, my Auntie Lily, and my Uncle Richard, all Acadians who suffered the impacts of these historic wrongs. My father, Paul Gallant (1917-2008), was the youngest of ten children and had a grade eight education. He was the lucky one; most of my Acadian aunts and uncles could not read or write. Folksong would remain the only remnant of my father’s Acadian past because he had to lose his French accent to find work and was told by a nun from Québec to stop speaking French at home because it was a ‘low class’ form of French. I dedicate this piece to his memory with love.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to listen. It means the world to me! Scores can be purchased at: www.jeanettegallant.com/shop.\n\nJeanette"
