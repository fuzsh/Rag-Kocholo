        "text": "Penn will not require applicants to submit the SAT or ACT for the 2024-25 application cycle. This applies to all first-year, domestic, international, homeschooled, transfer, and QuestBridge applicants. Applicants who do not submit SAT or ACT scores will not be at a disadvantage in the admissions process.\n\nIf you can take the SAT or ACT and wish to report your scores, you may continue with that plan. Applicants may self-report test scores at the time of their application. For applicants who do wish to submit their scores, we use standardized testing as part of our comprehensive review process to gain more insight into the academic preparation of our applicants. These tests represent only one component in our dynamic admissions process in combination with other academic and non-academic factors.\n\nFor more information on our test-optional policy, please view our announcement on the Penn Admissions Blog and our FAQs about Testing.\n\nTestEarly DecisionRegular DecisionTransfer DecisionLatest SAT Test DateNovember 2024December 2024March 2025Latest ACT Test DateOctober 2024December 2024February 2025\n\nPenn will continue to follow the guidance and policies of the Ivy League regarding testing requirements for applicants who expect to participate in the varsity athletic program. For more information, please see the Ivy League’s website for prospective student athletes.\n\nSAT and ACT Testing Deadlines (2024-2025 Admissions Cycle)\n\nTests must be taken by the appropriate application deadline. Applicants may not self-report scores from exams taken beyond the deadlines indicated above.\n\nTesting codes: SAT – 2926; ACT – 3732; TOEFL – 2926\n\nThe SAT and ACT\n\nThere is no minimum score required to apply to Penn. We understand that standardized testing only provides a fraction of insight into your academic performance, and through our comprehensive review process, we consider multiple factors to determine your preparedness for Penn.\n\nNo preference is given to the SAT or the ACT. If an applicant submits both tests, we will pay attention to the higher score from either test.\n\nThe College Board and ACT provide free resources that can help you prepare for the exams.\n\nLearn more about preparing for the SAT.\n\nLearn more about preparing for the ACT.\n\nScore Choice\n\nAlthough we permit applicants to use Score Choice to discern which score reports you want to submit, we encourage students to submit their entire testing history for both ACT and SAT exams to provide more context and to avoid inaccuracies.\n\nIf you submit multiple sets of test scores, we will combine your highest Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing with your highest Math score in either format to calculate a superscore.\n\nSuperscoring\n\nFor the SAT, we will combine your highest Evidenced-Based Reading and Writing with your highest Math score across multiple tests to calculate a superscore.\n\nFor the ACT, we consider the highest individual English, Math, Reading, and Science scores across multiple tests to calculate a composite superscore.\n\nIf you are self-reporting exams from multiple dates to create your superscore, then we expect you to provide official reports for each test that contributes to your superscore prior to enrollment in line with our self-reported testing policy.\n\nDigital SAT\n\nStarting in spring 2024, the SAT test will be available digitally in the U.S.\n\nPenn will accept the digital SAT if a student opts to submit testing scores. The exam is scored (or superscored) the same as the paper and pencil SAT.\n\nWhile we encourage students to submit their entire testing history for SAT exams, we will accept a combination of scores from both formats of the exam.\n\nSelf-Reported Scores\n\nApplicants who choose to report test scores under Penn's test-optional policy have the option of self-reporting their SAT and ACT scores when they apply—with some exceptions:\n\nRecruited athletes who submit standardized testing as part of their application are required to submit official testing through the appropriate testing agency or University-approved source.\n\nAny student required to submit English-language proficiency exams must have official results sent through official testing agencies to be considered with a student’s application.\n\nPrior to enrollment, admitted students who submitted self-reported test scores on the application are required to submit official test scores to Penn.\n\nTo self-report your scores, use the testing section of the Common App, the Coalition Application, or QuestBridge Application.\n\nTo ensure accurate “super scoring” (recognizing the highest composite score across multiple sittings), we recommend you self-report each test you have taken to select the highest score in each section.\n\nYou may also self-report your scores directly through your Penn Applicant Portal once your application is received. (Note: if you are using the Common App, your scores will not appear in the PDF preview but we will still receive them.)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Testing\n\nA strong command of the English language is essential for successful study at Penn. If you meet one or both criteria below, we consider you proficient in English:\n\nEnglish is your native language.\n\nEnglish has been your primary language of instruction for the duration of high school.\n\nIf neither of these statements is true, we require the TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo English Test to demonstrate your English proficiency. Where the TOEFL iBT is not available due to COVID-19, you can take the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition. Please note that Penn does not currently accept the IELTS Indicator exam or MyBest scores for the TOEFL.\n\nTo learn about the TOEFL, IELTS, and Duolingo English Test and to register for the examinations, please visit the websites below. Penn's school code for the TOEFL is 2926.\n\nTOEFL\n\nIELTS\n\nDuolingo English Test\n\nBe sure to designate Penn as a recipient university each time you register for an examination. If you have already taken a test but did not designate Penn as a score recipient, please do so afterwards.\n\nIf I choose not to report my test scores, what other ways can I demonstrate my academic preparation?\n\nScore reports can be sent directly to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions through official testing agencies. Penn does not accept self-reported scores for English proficiency examinations at this time."
