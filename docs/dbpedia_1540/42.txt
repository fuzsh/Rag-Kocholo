George Bernard Shaw once said, “When a thing is funny, search it for a hidden truth.” Well, I’ve searched… and searched… and searched and the hidden truth in Brickleberry is nowhere to be found.

For those of you who may not have killed brain cells watching it yet, Brickleberry is an adult animated sitcom series produced by Daniel Tosh on Comedy Central. The show follows the daily lives of a group of park rangers who work in Brickleberry National Park. The humor on Brickleberry is crude, tasteless, and highly offensive. And while it is true that the same could be said about the humor of similar adult cartoon shows such as South Park and The Simpsons, Brickleberry seems to be in a league of its own… and not a in a good way.

I’ll admit, I am a sucker for physical humor and borderline offensive jokes up to a certain point. There were way too many times while I was watching Brickleberry that the cringe-worthy humor made me extremely uncomfortable rather than giggly.

Brickleberry doesn’t have a sense of direction and instead of hammering away at one or two offensive topics per episode, it tries to throw in as many offensive topics as possible. In the pilot episode alone, jokes are made about handicapped kids, old people, masturbation, black people, Asian people, Latino people, rednecks, AIDS, abortion, BDSM, sexual and physical violence towards animals and alcoholism. These topics are not addressed in a satirical manner meant to spark deep thought or change within society. Read more about the importance of humor as social commentary here.

I would be more accepting of the humor of Brickleberry if it had a hidden truth to it. Comedy has and always will be a form of social commentary that should not be taken lightly. The bad jokes on Brickleberry have little to do with the plot line and absolutely nothing to do with the betterment of society. In hindsight, I’m not even sure why I wasted so much time watching this show.
