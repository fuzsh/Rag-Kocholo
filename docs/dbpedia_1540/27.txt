Brickleberry, the fan-favorite-but-cancelled animated series from Comedy Central, will continue in comics form from Dynamite Entertainment, following up on the success of Loren Bouchard and Bento Box Entertainment's Bob's Burgers.

Brickleberry, which premiered in 2012, was a comedic take on the lives of park rangers working in the fictional national park of the same name. The series ran for three seasons and chronicled the daily misadventures of Brickleberry National Park's longtime ranger Woody Johnson and a supporting cast of federal employees as they bumble through their daily duties.

Picking up where the series finale left off in 2015, Dynamite will work directly with the show's creators Waco O'Guin and Roger Black for the official continuation of the series, featuring the same off-beat humor and backwoods politics for which it's known.

"We are so excited to be in business with Dynamite to tell more Brickleberry stories! Our first issue is an insane tale that picks up where the Brickleberry finale left off," said series co-creator Waco O'Guin.

"We truly believe this series will make all our Brickleberry fans very happy," said co-creator Roger Black. "Also, we are thrilled at the possibility of reaching the tons of comic book fans who might not yet know of the show."

"We are excited to expand our partnership with Bento Box to bring Brickleberry to comic books," said Dynamite CEO/Publisher, Nick Barrucci. "Bob's Burgersis one of our most rewarding programs, due largely to the direct involvement of the writers and artists working on the show. We know we have a repeatable recipe for success with the help of Bento Box and the series' creators."
