        "text": "Who says cartoons are just for kids? In fact, some of the most popular TV shows for adults fall into the animation category. From fan-favorites, like Futurama, to the longest-running primetime TV show ever, The Simpsons, Hulu has a number of adult cartoons waiting for you to explore.\n\nWondering where to watch your favorite adult animation series, including brand new episodes of The Simpsons, Bob’s Burgers, Family Guy, and Rick and Morty? Look no further — Hulu is your home for everything Animayhem.\n\nCheck out the 22 most awesome adult animation shows streaming now on Hulu.\n\nThe Best Adult Animation Shows on Hulu\n\n1. Rick and Morty\n\nIf you’re late to the party, this fan-favorite centers around the eccentric Smith family — Jerry (Chris Parnell) and Beth (Sara Chalke), their two kids, Summer (Spencer Grammer) and Morty (Harry Belden), and Beth’s father, Rick (Ian Cardoni).\n\nThe thing is, Rick is a slightly sociopathic, alcoholic-mad scientist, who drags his grandson on wild adventures through the multiverse, where they both tend to cause a lot of trouble.\n\nWatch Seasons 1 – 6 of Rick and Morty now. All caught up and ready for Season 7? Check out our Adult Swim guide for more information about how to stream new episodes on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Rick and Morty\n\n2. Bob’s Burgers\n\nIn a nondescript New England beach town, Bob Belcher (H. John Benjamin) and his family live in a tiny apartment above their small family restaurant, Bob’s Burgers. Bob and his wife, Linda (John Roberts), and their three kids, Tina (Dan Mintz), Gene (Eugene Mirman), and Louise (Kristen Schaal), aren’t fancy. But what they lack in sophistication, they make up for in humor, heart, and the occasional fart joke.\n\nWatch Seasons 1 – 13 of Bob’s Burgers streaming now on Hulu with new episodes of Season 14 dropping weekly.\n\nWatch: Bob’s Burgers\n\n3. The Simpsons\n\nKnown for potentially predicting many of the major events in recent history, the Golden GlobeⓇ-winning series, The Simpsons, is one of the longest-running TV shows ever, with an astounding 35 seasons and counting.\n\nWhy has this adult animated comedy lasted so long? Our guess is the show’s satirical take on the average American family, current events, and pop culture.\n\nWhile Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and baby Maggie are a bit on the dysfunctional side, the show centers around their love for each other and the connections they make in Springfield, the small town they call home.\n\nWondering where to watch The Simpsons? Stream new episodes now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: The Simpsons\n\n4. Family Guy\n\nThe EmmyⓇ-winning series, Family Guy, follows the Griffins — an eclectic, middle-class family from Rhode Island who aren’t always the most politically correct. Peter Griffin (Seth MacFarlane) and his wife, Lois (Alex Borstein), do their best to keep their three children, Meg (Mila Kunis), Chris (Seth Green), and Stewie (MacFarlane), alive with the help of their talking dog, Brian (MacFarlane).\n\nStream Seasons 1 — 21 of Family Guy now on Hulu with new episodes of Season 22 dropping weekly.\n\nWatch: Family Guy\n\n5. Futurama\n\nWhile delivering pizza on New Year’s Eve at the turn of the new millennium, Fry (Billy West) was cryogenically frozen. In the year 2099, 1,000 years later, his body is thawed, and he’s thrust into a futuristic and unfamiliar world.\n\nWith the help of his friends and coworkers, Captain Leela (Katey Sagal) and Bender (John DiMaggio) the flawed robot, Fry begins working for Planet Express Corporation — a delivery service that transports packages to locations across the universe.\n\nWondering where to watch Futurama? Watch all 11 seasons now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Futurama\n\n6. Adventure Time\n\nWhat is Adventure Time about? That’s a great question. Much of Adventure Time is very random, but fans think the show’s unusual and whimsical nature is what makes it so great. Get lost in the enchanted land of Ooo with Finn (Jeremy Shada), a teenage boy, and Jake (John DiMaggio), a 28-year–old dog with magical powers.\n\nWatch: Adventure Time\n\n7. The Venture Bros.\n\nRunning from 2003 – 2018, The Venture Bros. was one of the last major network cartoons to be completely hand drawn. A satirical take on the superhero genre, The Venture Bros. follows the hilarious misadventures of brothers Hank (Christopher McCulloch) and Dean (Michael Sinterniklaas) Venture, their pseudo-scientist father, Dr. Venture (James Urbaniak), and their frenzied bodyguard, Brock (Patrick Warburton).\n\nWatch: The Venture Bros.*\n\n*Live TV plan required to watch live content on Hulu. Regional restrictions, blackouts, and additional terms apply.\n\n8. Solar Opposites\n\nThis Hulu Original follows a team of four aliens who escape their exploding home planet and land somewhere in middle America, where they live together in a suburban home.\n\nThe group disagrees on how they feel about Earth. Korvo (Dan Stevens) and Yumyulack (Sean Giambrone) are focused on the pollution and rampant consumerism, while Terry (Thomas Middleditch) and Jesse (Mary Mack) are enthralled with the human lifestyle — namely TV shows, snacks, and other indulgent activities.\n\nSeasons 1 – 4 of Solar Opposites are streaming now on Hulu.\n\nWatch: Solar Opposites\n\n9. Aqua Teen Hunger Force\n\nWhat do you get when a milkshake, an order of fries, and a meatball room together in the suburbs of New Jersey? Aqua Teen Hunger Force, that’s what.

American Dad\n\nFrom the creators of Family Guy, American Dad is a raunchier and more unhinged take on the life of an American family. CIA agent Stan Smith (Seth MacFarlane) is a paranoid man who will stop at nothing to protect his country and his family from terrorists. In addition to Stan, there’s his wife, Francine (Wendy Schaal), and their two kids, Steve (Scott Grimes) and Hayley (Rachel MacFarlane).
