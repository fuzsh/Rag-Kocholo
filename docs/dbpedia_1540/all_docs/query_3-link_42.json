        "text": "NEW YORK, Sept. 21, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- COMEDY CENTRAL has turned over the controls to its Facebook fans. The brand has rolled out its multiplatform marketing campaign for its new animated series \"Brickleberry,\" which features the release of segments of the premiere episode based on the number of Facebook \"Likes\" it receives on the show's page. This innovative approach along with the release of additional exclusive content on Tumblr, Decksi Cards and custom \"Brickleberry\" E-Cards will engage COMEDY CENTRAL fans and encourage them to share content with their friends. Executive produced by Daniel Tosh and series Creators Waco O'Guin and Roger Black, \"Brickleberry\" will premiere on COMEDY CENTRAL on Tuesday, September 25 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT.\n\n\"This innovative launch campaign taps into the savvy social media fan-base that propelled 'Tosh.0' into a multiplatform hit,\" said Walter Levitt, Executive Vice President, Marketing at COMEDY CENTRAL. \"Using platforms like Facebook, Tumblr and Decksi, COMEDY CENTRAL is giving our fans the tools to become brand ambassadors for this new series.\"\n\nThe multiplatform marketing initiatives for \"Brickleberry\" include:\n\nFacebook: \"Like To Unlock\"\n\nThe campaign features an exclusive look at the \"Brickleberry\" pilot, which is being incrementally unlocked on Facebook: with every \"Like\" milestone set and reached, COMEDY CENTRAL will release a few more minutes of the pilot episode. Fans are encouraged to share the \"Brickleberry\" page on their Facebook Timelines and invite friends to \"Like To Unlock\" to view more of the pilot.\n\n\"A Countdown To 'Brickleberry'\"\n\nLeading up to the September 25 on-air premiere, COMEDY CENTRAL is posting daily behind-the-scenes stills, sketches, character designs, memes and GIFs to its Tumblr and \"Brickleberry\" Facebook pages. Fans can reblog the posts easily onto their own Tumblr and Facebook pages.\n\nDecksi Cards\n\nPartnering for the first time with a major media brand, this online trading card service will encourage users to \"collect\" and consume digital \"Brickleberry\" content. COMEDY CENTRAL's deck currently features 17 cards, including two previews clips and four character mash-up videos. The deck will expand to 50 cards by the end of the season and active users will have the chance to unlock extra exclusive content.\n\nAnimated E-Cards\n\nIn keeping with the show's \"Nature is Filthy\" theme, fans can create animated E-Cards to share with Facebook friends by selecting their preferred animal, sex position and dirty message. Once the E-Card is completed, it will appear on the selected friend's Facebook Timeline along with a link to create and send one of their own. Also as an added bonus, the E-Cards include voiceover audio recorded by Daniel Tosh.\n\nAdditionally, in anticipation of the series premiere, COMEDY CENTRAL is extensively promoting \"Brickleberry\" through advertising on television, online, radio, outdoor and in subways. Also, as a part of the campaign, COMEDY CENTRAL will launch a one-day marketing stunt during the week of the premiere, sure to attract the attention of fans nationwide.\n\nWhen commuters in select cities head to work on the morning of September 24, they will be greeted by more than 1,500 life-size cut-outs of \"Malloy\" the bear at major landmarks and intersections across the country. Malloy will be seen uttering something inappropriate and fans will be invited to visit NatureIsFilthy.com for more information.\n\nFrom Executive Producer Daniel Tosh (\"Tosh.0\") and series Creators, Writers and Executive Producers Waco O'Guin and Roger Black (MTV2's \"Stankervision\"), \"Brickleberry,\" co-produced by Fox 21 and COMEDY CENTRAL, is a new animated series revolving around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second tier national park.
