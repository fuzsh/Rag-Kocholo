        "text": "Thursday, June 18 to Monday, June 29\n\nLLESFF stands with Black Lives Matter and is committed to continuing efforts that elevate and empower BIPOC voices in the independent film landscape. We acknowledge that there are many financial barriers for indie filmmakers, especially in final production and festival submission stages. LESFF will announce a new pilot program that financially supports BIPOC filmmakers through grants, submission fee waivers, and access to resources and partnerships with the existing LESFF alumni network to ensure that more of their films have the opportunity for festival circuit visibility and impact. More details on the initiative to be announced at this year’s event.\n\nThe 2020 Lower East Side Film Festival (June 18 – 29, 2020) invites you to experience innovative feature films and specialty short showcases, exclusive industry livestream Q&A’s, trivia nights, and more throughout the virtually interactive festival. The Lower East Side Film Festival (“LESFF”) has moved online and is excited to expand viewership to a broader audience demographic while continuing their mission of supporting independent filmmakers. The first five days of the online festival will roll-out premieres of feature films, short film showcases, and virtual events. The entirety of the program will remain live for the following week to allow festival goers 11 full days to soak up everything LESFF 2020 has to offer.\n\nThis year, LESFF is thrilled to announce they are spotlighting immigrant and 1st/2nd generation filmmakers with their 2020 film line-up echoing the ethos of The Lower East Side itself, a neighborhood that has been home to many of the country’s immigrants. LESFF understands the value a diverse culture brings to the unique storytelling that the cinematic language has offered for the past 100 years, and has championed that ideal in their programming in the past decade.\n\nNotable presentations will include a conversation with Ramy Youssef that will offer audiences free access to a talk with the Golden Globe winner and the writers behind the highly lauded second season of Hulu’s Ramy, hosted in partnership with The Writers Guild of America East discussing the process behind writing about comedy, relationships and religion, moderated by Huffington Post’s Rowaida Abdelaziz. As well as the premiere of Joshua Edelman’s Mentally AI, which features Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) and Sarah Silverman (Bob’s Burgers,The Simpsons), and is an exploration of how artistic success is defined. Judges will include Indya Moore (Pose, Queen & Slim), Samantha Bee (Full Frontal with Samantha Bee), and more.\n\nABOUT LOWER EAST SIDE FILM FESTIVAL\n\n2020 will mark the 10th Anniversary of the Lower East Side Film Festival. Since its inaugural year, the festival has premiered hundreds of short and feature films, hosted thousands of audience members, and has been deemed “one of the most exciting under the radar film events in all of New York City” by Film.com and was featured in New York Magazine’s ‘Approval Matrix’ under “Highbrow/ Brilliant”. Past judges and alumni have included Ethan Hawke, Rami Malek, Rosario Dawson, Susan Sarandon, Willem Dafoe, Denis O’Hare, Laverne Cox, Parker Posey, Ilana Glazer, Dolly Parton, Natasha Lyonne, Marky Ramone, Rebecca Miller, Judah Friedlander, Lizzy Caplan, Amy Arbus, Justin Bond, Nick Kroll and many more. LESFF believes great films are made with creativity, innovation, and heart and always seeks undiscovered and underdog filmmakers who understand that a huge budget does not always equal a great film.\n\nLESFF 2020 Schedule\n\nThursday, June 18th – 6PM\n\nOpening Night -All Films Go Live!\n\nThe Complete 2020 Film Line-Up is available online.

Directed by Rachel Beth Anderson & Timothy Grucza (First to Fall).Unschooled is beset by drugs, violence and apathy the Philadelphia public school system is failing. Desperate for a solution, some inner-city parents turn their hopes to an unlikely place; a newly opened educational resource center in the north Philadelphia neighborhood of Germantown called the Natural Creativity Center (NCC). Founded by veteran educator Peter Bergson, NCC (as it is known) is built on the belief that formalized education is just part of a larger systemic problem-the dehumanization of our children’s education. Bergson has set out to prove once and for all that the power and efficacy of self-motivation isn’t limited by race or economic background and that there is a more humane way to educate our children-one that taps into every child’s innate desire to learn. Undeterred in his belief, Bergson practices “unschooling” – a program developed over several decades at a center he and his wife Susan started 30 years ago in the suburbs – called Open Connections – empowering students to direct their own education, favoring dialogue, discovery and self-discipline over tests, teachers and timelines. When three young Philadelphia teens; Amani, Miles and Jaya enroll at NCC, all of Peter’s radical ideas are put to the test.\n\nSHORT SHOWCASES:\n\n‘I LOVE NY’ SHORTS\n\nMissing your city a little bit right now?

Three Indian people starring Danny Pudi (Community, Star Trek Beyond), Karan Soni (Deadpool, Deadpool 2, Always Be My Maybe, Ghostbusters) & Kausar Mohammed (Silicon Valley, What Men Want) imagine their personas as their “coffee shop names,” the names they give baristas because their real names are hard to pronounce.\n\nMarcy Learns Something New.

Marcy Learns Something New stars Rachel Dratch (Saturday Night Live, Broad City, Wine Country) as a widow who goes to a dominatrix class, “Marcy Learns Something New” explores themes of loneliness, connection and finding confidence in unexpected ways. Rather than portray BDSM as either a dismissable joke or a dark secret, as it’s often seen, the film seeks to show Marcy’s agency in finding joy during a difficult period of her life.\n\nEagle. Written & Directed by Jose Acevedo (Alternatino with Arturo Castro). Eagle stars Roy Wood Jr. (The Daily Show with Trevor Noah) and Antonio Ortiz Jr. (High Fidelity, Orange is the New Black) about a Brooklyn High School senior who receives some good news.\n\nBalloon.
