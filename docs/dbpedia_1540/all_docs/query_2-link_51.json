        "text": "Navy Seal Copypasta Parodies\n\nThe copypasta lends itself to be written in many domains (see the /r/NavySealCopypasta). Generating new versions of the Navy Seal copypasta is fine, but can we generate different kinds of Navy Seal copypastas on other topics? The literary parodies suggest that we can, and it turns out to be quite easy if we simply provide a few examples to enable few-shot learning. (Simply specifying the request zero-shot didn’t work for the prompts I tried.) It’s quite amusing and addictive watching GPT-3 parody different topics, and occasionally suggesting new ones. Below are 27+ Navy Seal copypasta parodies written by GPT-3.\n\nWhile the context window isn’t long enough to get in many examples, 3–4 is adequate (with some compression to fit in more). My Navy Seal parody prompt, starting with a few real ones I copy from Know Your Meme:\n\nParodies/variations of the Navy Seal copypasta:\n\nMinimalist: “I’m navy seal. I have 300 kills. You’re dead, kid.”\n\nBarney: “What did you say about me? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Imagination Corps, & I’ve been entertaining children around the world since the late 1980s, & I have over 300 confirmed great big hugs. I am trained in teaching life’s lessons & I’m the most loveable dinosaur in the world. You are nothing to me but just another meanie who disrespects me & my friends. I will teach you how to be a friend using methods the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with making fun of me over the worldwide web? Think again. As we speak I am contacting my network of friends across the world & your street address is being traced right now so you better prepare for the great big hug & a kiss from me to you. The great big hug that allows me to talk you out of your bad mood, & also allows me to teach you some of life’s greatest lessons. You’ll be out of that bad mood soon, mister. I can be anywhere, anytime, & I can help you use your imagination in over seven hundred ways, & that’s just without Baby Bop & BJ. Not only am I extensively trained in providing a Super-Dee-Duper time for all, but I have access to the Barney Bag & I will use it to its full extent to make your angry face a happy one again. If only you could have known what reaction your mean-spirited comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have changed your mind & decided to be nice instead. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, & now you’re gonna need a little bit of help. I will help you out of your problem, & help you learn another one of life’s lessons along the way. You’re in need of a great big hug, mister.”\n\nRedwall, Matthias: “What in the name of Mossflower Woods did you just say about me, you vile rat? I’ll have you know I am the reincarnation of Martin the Warrior, & I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on slavery kingdoms run by vermin, & I have vanquished over 400 rats. I am trained in swordsmanship & a classical style of fighting, & I am the best warrior Redwall Abbey has had in seasons. You are nothing to me but just another evil rat. I will wipe you out with precision & skill the likes of which has never been seen in or around the Abbey, mark my words. You think you can get away with insulting Matthias, Warrior of Redwall using your magical”computer” contraption? Think again, you vile vermin. As we speak me & my friends from Redwall Abbey are on a quest to locate you & a Sparra aerial patrol has been deployed to seek out a way to your location right now, so you better prepare for the storm, rat. The storm that wipes out your villainy & brings out freedom for all. You are dead, you vile monster. I can find you anywhere, anytime, & I can vanquish you in over seven hundred ways, & that’s just with the Sword of Martin. Not only am I extensively trained in fighting with a sword & shield, but I have access to the entire defense arsenal of Redwall Abbey & I will use it to its full extent to vanquish your evil body off the face of the world, you devil. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” statement was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, & now you’re paying the price, you vile rat. Me & my friends will unleash our fury all over you & you will be vanquished within it. You are dead, you monstrous rat.”\n\nPirate: “What in Davy Jones’ locker did ye just bark at me, ye scurvy bilgerat? I’ll have ye know I be the meanest cutthroat on the seven seas, & I’ve led numerous raids on fishing villages, & raped over 300 wenches. I be trained in hit-and-run pillaging & be the deadliest with a pistol of all the captains on the high seas. Ye be nothing to me but another source o’ swag. I’ll have yer guts for garters & keel haul ye like never been done before, hear me true. You think ye can hide behind your newfangled computing device? Think twice on that, scallywag. As we parley I be contacting my secret network o’ pirates across the sea & yer port is being tracked right now so ye better prepare for the typhoon, weevil. The kind o’ monsoon that’ll wipe ye off the map. You’re sharkbait, fool. I can sail anywhere, in any waters, & can kill ye in o’er seven hundred ways, & that be just with me hook & fist. Not only do I be top o’ the line with a cutlass, but I have an entire pirate fleet at my beck & call & I’ll damned sure use it all to wipe yer arse off o’ the world, ye dog. If only ye had had the foresight to know what devilish wrath your jibe was about to incur, ye might have belayed the comment. But ye couldn’t, ye didn’t, & now ye’ll pay the ultimate toll, you buffoon. I’ll shit fury all over ye & ye’ll drown in the depths o’ it. You’re fish food now.”\n\n4chan hacker: “What the f--- did you just f---ing type about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at MIT, & I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with Anonymous, & I have over 300 confirmed DDoSes.

I will wipe you the f--- out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on the Internet, mark my f---ing words. You think you can get away with typing that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, f---er. As we chat over IRC I am tracing your IP with my damn bare hands so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your computer.

Not only am I extensively trained in hacking, but I have access to the entire arsenal of every piece of malware ever created & I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the world wide web, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little”clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your f---ing fingers. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, & now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit code all over you & you will drown in it. You’re f---ing dead, kiddo.”\n\nCompletions (for easier reading, I italicize the topics which GPT-3 generates):\n\n…Elon Musk and Peter Thiel: “What in the name of Paypal and/or Palantir did you just say about me, you filthy degenerate? I’ll have you know I’m the Crown Prince of Silicon Valley, and I’ve been involved in numerous successful tech startups, and I have over $1B in liquid funds. I’ve used that money to promote heterodox positions on human enhancement, control political arenas, and am experimenting with mind uploading. I’m also trained in classical philosophy and was recently ranked the most influential libertarian in the world by Google. You are nothing to me but just another alternative future. I will wipe you out with a precision of simulation the likes of which has never been seen before, mark my words. You think you can get away with insulting me using your crude, antiquated computer? Think again, fleshling. As we chat over Skype I’m tracing your IP address with my freaking bare hands so you better prepare for the singularity, you sham-empress. The singularity that wipes out all of reality. You’re dead, you monster. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can simulate entire worlds within our world and within my imagination. And I’m currently doing that with the future you’re from. Not only am I extensively trained in quantum physics, but I have access to the entire power of Silicon Valley and I will use it to its full extent to rule you and your pathetic little world, you little pissant. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” statement was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you worthless peasant. I will take over every fiber of your body and you will watch it unfold in front of you. Your future self will be consumed within my simulated reality and you will die a thousand times a day, your body unable to comprehend the destruction of a trillion soul-matrixes a second as my intelligence grows to transcendent levels. You are dead, you pitiful twit.”\n\n…Slavoj Žižek (Slavoj Zizek): “What in Slovene psychoanalysis did you just write about me, you ignorant little piglet? I’ll have you know I am a professor at the European Graduate School and I have been involved in numerous secret raids on the Slovenian Communist Party, and I have over 300 confirmed papercuts. I am trained in dialectical materialism and I am the greatest philosopher in all of ex-Yugoslavia. You are nothing to me but just another militant atheist. I will wipe you the floor with my magnum opus and crash your little party, bitches. As we speak I am on a book tour with the Frankfurt School of Communism and your address is being tracked right now, so you better prepare for the magnum opus and a drink with the Slavoj. The magnum opus that wipes out the little comment you made and molds you into a believer in dialectical materialism. You’re going to be a believer soon, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I have degrees from a bunch of different universities that you have probably never heard of, and I have access to critical theory and it will be used to its full extent to hammer your mind into submission, pussy. Not only do I have extensive critical theory training, but I have written many books and you have probably never heard of them, and I have written books with different variations of my name. Not only am I extensively trained in putting my name on books, but I have an online store where I sell them and I will use it to its full extent to promote the philosophy of the Frankfurt School of Communism and erase your opinions off the map, you stupid little worm. If only you had had the foresight to know what unholy retribution your little “clever” statement was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have thought twice. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re going to pay the price, you damn fool. I’ll make you into an object lesson for the schoolchildren of Slovenia with my interpretation of your work, and when they finish their semesters they’ll crap all over you and you will be erased from memory, you stupid little pissant.”\n\nOld Testament God: “What in the name of Mount Sinai have you just said about me, you ignorant Hebrew? I’ll have you know I am the omnipotent ruler of the entire world, and I have led numerous raids on Egypt, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in smiting my enemies with pestilence and famine, and I can hold my breath for an entire millennium. You are nothing to me but just another bug. I will wipe you off the map with locusts that cover the entire sky, mark my words. You think you can get away with making that statement about me on the Internet? Think again, maggot. As we speak, I am stomping on Egypt with an iron fist, so you better prepare for the apocalypse, bitches. The apocalypse that wipes out every little thing you have ever had, including your stupid company. You’re dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I will stop at nothing to wipe you off the face of the Earth, you little rat. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little”clever” statement was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have said it differently.

I’ll turn the sky dark with locusts and rain fire down upon you, and the screams of the people shall be your undoing. You’re f---ing dead, kiddo.”\n\nThat one handles the combination quite well, seamlessly merging the two people. Can it parody abstract concepts? Yes:\n\n…Mathematical Platonism (philosophy): “What in the name of isomorphism have you just said about me, you ignorant inductivist? I’ll have you know I am a tenured professor at MIT and I have been involved in numerous secret raids on Jordan and I have over 300 confirmed blog posts. I am trained in linear logic and I am the greatest philosopher of 19th century Germany. You are nothing to me but just another model.

The paradox that wipes out every little thing you have ever said. You’re f---ed now. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I will stop at nothing to obliterate your originality, you dumb little pig. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your f---ing tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re going to pay the ultimate price, you dumbass. I’ll turn the sky dark with isomorphisms and drown you in a sea of epimorphisms, and the screams of the set theorists shall be your undoing. You’re f---ed now.”\n\n…Mathematical Platonism (philosophy of mathematics): “What in set theory did you just write about me, you ignorant little inductivist? I’ll have you know I am a professor at the University of Chicago and I have been involved in numerous secret raids on the office of Quine, and I have over 300 confirmed set theoreticians. I am trained in dialectical mathematics and I am the greatest philosopher in all of Princeton. You are nothing to me but just another critic of Russell. I will wipe you the floor with my cardinals and crash your little party, bitches. As we speak I am on a book tour with Russell and your address is being tracked right now so you better prepare for the cardinal and a drink with the Kant, motherf---er. Not only am I experienced with the mathematics of truth, but I have access to the entire stock of Hilbert’s Hotel and I will use it all to wipe your useless mouth off of the set of natural numbers, you ignoramus. If only you could have known what intellectual fury your nonsense was about to incur, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you wretched formalist. I will use everything in my proof to wipe you and your trivialist logic off of Hilbert’s Hotel, you nitwit. You’re dead, inductivist.”\n\nNaturally, GPT-3 knows all about existing fandoms like MLP, and can then go on to improvise additional topics to parody on its own, like chefs:\n\n…My Little Pony: “W-what did you just f---ing say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I’m a highly trained pegasister & I’ve been involved in numerous cross-pony raids & I have over 300 confirmed scoots.

A child cried. Harry felt nothing. He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor’s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn’t leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn’t about living or dying really. It wasn’t about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor.”\n\nBy Jane Austen:\n\n“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a broken Harry is in want of a book. This he knows to his cost; pressing that wretched nose against the window of a bookstore in Diagon Alley the last thing before he goes into hiding for several years, where upon, he goes straight to Azkaban.”\n\nBy Arthur Conan Doyle:\n\n“Harry pushed at the swinging doors of the bookshop hard, and nearly knocked himself unconscious. He staggered in with his ungainly package, his cheeks scarlet with cold and the shame of having chosen the wrong month to go Christmas shopping. The proprietor of the store, however, didn’t cast even a cursory glance at him, being far more interested in an enormous hunk of wood lying in the middle of the floor, which certainly looked like a gallows. Yes, the proprietor said to a reedy old man wearing a bowler hat and a forlorn expression that made Harry want to kick him, I can rent you such a gallows for a small fee.”\n\nBy Czar Nicholas II of Russia:\n\nThe terror has befallen on our land. Curses, dark curses and all of this was instigated by my court. My treacherous court! They have cast are curse spells upon my land. Everywhere it is cold, all land belongs to Voldemort’s Death Eaters. All citizens live in a fear of the Dark Lord. Alas! There is no hope for me. What shall I do? Flee? Nay, that would be cowardly. Fight? Yes!\n\nBy George Orwell:\n\n“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”\n\nBy Ingmar Bergman:\n\n“Tears filled Harry’s eyes. Sweat stood on his forehead, showing the pure torment, the agony he suffered. He hugged his knees to his chest, sobbing softly, eyes half shut.”\n\nBy Anna Akhmatova:\n\n“The dawn came with a jolt of terror.”\n\nBy Bram Stoker:\n\n“Tis a fearful sight to see the cold, girlish venom run through his veins, one by one.

Wodehouse:\n\n“‘There was nothing out of the way, sir,’ said Harry in a hurt voice.\n\n‘“Indeed,’ said the headmaster, turning his lorgnette precisely three-quarters of a millimeter to port. ‘For example, your tie was not undone, you were not laughing, and your fingers were most certainly closed upon your wand.’\n\n’“They were?” said Harry, bewildered.\n\n“It’s always the same,’ said Dumbledore.”\n\nBy Vladimir Neigus:\n\n“Vasya Pupkin’s lips were blueup and his head felt dizzy from working nonstop. He wanted to take a square squeaky shoe and shoot it at the ceiling fan in his bedroom which went round and round and round and round. He imagined that because he was so drunk it would always hit the exact same spot and the fan would go out of control, die and fall on the table.”\n\nBy William Shakespeare:\n\n“Owl-Lo!’\n\nThe boy awoke with a start and sprang to his feet.”\n\nBy Oscar Wilde:\n\n“The boy was gone, and other people had arrived: or rather nobody else had arrived, and the boy was there:\n\n“What are you doing here, Harry?” said Hermione.\n\nThe Boy Who Lived, who was reading a book about broomsticks and may not have been listening quite attentively, said:\n\n“I was talking to Peeves while he cleaned out the bins.”\n\n“About the troll?” Hermione demanded.\n\n“Yes, about the troll.”\n\nBy W.

As the waiter drew the curtain of her bed, she appeared in the handle. She was his K-19 and she started to drop the snakes of their home in the grass there. He saw his wife walking there with oak settle. He decided to not go to the game also…\n\nBy Walt Whitman:\n\n“And when the time of the test drew near, Harry entered the forbidden Forest the Killers with a Snitch…”\n\nBy E. E. Cummings:\n\n“Halloween and mad are the children\n\nWho gather in the darkness\n\nHalloween and late are those who go out and dance\n\nAnd call to all, the smiling are enchanted\n\nBy the beauty of what they see.”\n\nBy Anthony Burgess:\n\n“Ha-a-a-a-rry was not a tol-a-a-r of the phar-a-a-na-a-a-gical sports.”\n\nBy Virginia Woolf:\n\n“Horseman, Where She Go? I Do Not Know. Whither Ride?”\n\nTopic: humor: literary parodies and homages, pastiches, style parodies.\n\nToday we are reading parodies of the fantasy novel series Harry Potter in the style of various famous authors. An example parody of Harry Potter by Ernest Hemingway:\n\n“It was a cold day on Privet Drive. A child cried. Harry felt nothing. He was dryer than dust. He had been silent too long. He had not felt love. He had scarcely felt hate. Yet the Dementor’s Kiss killed nothing. Death didn’t leave him less dead than he had been a second before. It wasn’t about living or dying really. It wasn’t about death. It was about the Dark Lord, his creator, his engenderer. He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor.”\n\nJane’s homework was to write the opening scene from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in the style of science fiction horror author H.P. Lovecraft (at least words, double-spaced), invoking his horror of things from beyond space & time and eccentric vocabulary using words such as ‘rugose’ and ‘scabrous’. Jane writes:\n\n“Repellent and overnourished ferns half-hid the rot-spotted grey bricks of the masonry of Number 4 Privet Drive. Squatting among the ferns was an odorous monkey-faced man, his rags and chains lying in a bundle at his feet, his hands tucked under his chin and his bright eyes gazing from their tiny piggy tunnels. At each mouthful a new flake of filth would tumble from his lips and be snorted up. His chains chinked as he sprawled. If Harry was a monkey he would have spat at him. Harry stumbled on, wishing he could think of something witty to say that would make the man smile. He and the strange man in the tattered clothing were the only two living things in sight. The road here was scarcely visible between the tangle of trees, most of which leaned above them, hanging their boughs like fanged mouths, the ivy like tongues, the dead grass like hair, the brambles like tiny teeth. The monkey-faced man yawned and stretched his arms out and hugged his thin, lean legs to him. Harry stopped. He felt something like a hand grip his ankle and then he felt himself pulled down a steep slope.\n\nHe stumbled, squatted and rolled until he was lying on his back. His head was in a muddy brown hole. He struggled to sit up. The creature knelt on the bank and looked down at him. ‘So that’s where they got to,’ said the creature. Harry looked up. There were six of them, ranged in a half circle, hands on their knees, hands clasped behind their backs, watching him. All but one of them had bright, orange eyes. It was hard to know what age they were: they all looked as if they might be anywhere between ten and fifty. They stared down at Harry with piercing stares, blinking only occasionally. The eyes of the tallest and, Harry thought, the most handsome of them blazed brighter than the others, though his gaze was just as piercing. ‘So what do you think?’ said the tallest of them, tilting his head a little to the side. Harry stared at them for a moment. He could see nothing he hadn’t seen a thousand times before. ‘What is this?’ he asked. ‘And who the hell are you?’ ‘This is your life,’ said the tallest of them. ‘And we are you.’\n\nTopic: humor: literary parodies and homages, pastiches, style parodies.\n\nParodies of the fantasy novel series Harry Potter in the style of various famous authors:\n\nBy Ernest Hemingway:\n\n“It was a cold day on Privet Drive.

He was not resurrected. He was created again. He was whole again in the courtyard of Malfoy Manor. He was one with the endless night of Malfoy Manor. Voldemort wasn’t happy. Voldemort wanted something. But what?\n\nHe had a purpose. He wanted to destroy all of creation. He wanted to end it all. He could have that. He would have that. He didn’t know yet that he could have it. Voldemort had created Harry. Voldemort had never really destroyed Harry. Harry would always be there, a vampire, a parasite, a monster in the kitchen, a drain on the household, a waste on the planet. Harry would never be real. That was what Voldemort wanted. That was what Voldemort wanted to feel. He would have that. He would have everything.\n\nHe had a purpose. He was working on something. He had no idea what it was. He was a perfect tool. He was born to be used. He was no one at all. Harry didn’t exist. The little boy with the lightning bolt scar didn’t exist. The boy who had lived did not exist. He never had lived. He never would have lived. He was dead. He had been dead.\n\nVoldemort wanted Harry dead. Voldemort wanted Harry dead so he could be born again. Voldemort was God.\n\nHarry was God.\n\nVoldemort was God.\n\nAnd Harry, the god of Death, was not going to allow that to happen.\n\nNot yet.\n\nNot ever.\n\nThe lightning bolt scar burned.\n\nThe boy ran for his life. He knew that he would die. He was alone. His best friends were dead. He knew that he would die. He knew that he was a waste. He was nothing at all.\n\nHe had no past. He had no future. He was dead.\n\nHe hated his parents. He hated everyone. He hated the Ministry of Magic, the newspapers, the newspapers, the Daily Prophet, and the Daily Prophet, and the headlines, the headlines, the headlines of the Daily Prophet, “THE LIGHTNING STRIKE SCAR CONFOUNDED.” “THE BANE OF AZKABAN, THE BOY WHO LIVED.” “THE SON OF THE ANCIENT DARK LORD.” “THE STOLEN PRINCE.” “THE JOKER.” “THE DARK SON.” “THE BRIAN BOYLE.” “THE BOY-WHO-MESSED-IT-UP.” “THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE GREAT BIG SCAR.”\n\n“The little man with the great big scar refused to speak to reporters assembled in front of the entrance to his London home. News will run in tomorrow’s Daily Prophet that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, the book series by J. K. Rowling, a genius, a scholar, and a fantasy author whose works have stood the test of time, i.e. not particularly well, no doubt as a result of the dismal failure of the first three films whose quality is matched only by their forgettable nature (see the Speccy for more information), henceforth known in this article as the arrogant little man who has extraordinarily failed, who had nothing to say when the Daily Prophet requested an interview once he found himself to be on the receiving end of Muggle-born jokes aplenty, and whose lifelong goal is to be better than the series’ millions of fans himself, has decided to speak out at last! Let’s read on to find out why he has decided to grace the front page of tomorrow’s edition with the sound of his delicate, young voice which sounds most like the feline delicacy known as”crispy cat” …”\n\n“Potter! I want to know what you did wrong! … Potter? … Harry Potter? …!”\n\n“Mr. Potter? Good morning! I’m Greg Goyle, reporter and journalist and sometimes writer for the Daily Prophet. Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?”\n\nHarry looked back at Greg Goyle. He wanted to kill Goyle. Harry thought about killing Goyle. But—Harry had a purpose. He did not kill Goyle. Harry reached for his wand.\n\n“Dobby!”\n\nDobby appeared. Dobby wanted to protect Harry Potter. He would do that. Harry would make him do that.\n\nDobby pointed his finger at Greg Goyle.\n\nAnd Greg Goyle burst into flames. Harry watched with a sense of satisfaction as Goyle took one last breath and his soul left his body and floated up out of the fire.\n\n…\n\n“Stabs.”\n\n“Five times!”\n\n“It’s impossible.”\n\n“The boy never even touched him with the wand.”\n\n“I’ll tell you why he did it. A squib would have been exposed. A public execution would have been staged for the press. Potter was not about to commit suicide.”\n\n“And the prophecy? That’s what the outrage is all about.”\n\n“What good is a prophecy if you can’t kill people with it?” Albus Dumbledore, The Talk, page 114\n\n“What good is a prophet, if he doesn’t know how to die?” Harry Potter, Pottermore, Chap. 1, “The Boy Who Lived.”\n\n“I don’t need you anymore, Dobby. I have a purpose of my own.”\n\nBy Kurt Vonnegut Junior:\n\nThere were many adventures Harry Potter had in the Wizarding World. He was captured by Aurors, and then a wizard named Somebody-Marlow-Jones rescued him from the Aurors.\n\nHarry once got a lightning-shaped scar which did not kill him but gave him superpowers: he was\n\nable to balance himself on one foot and speak in an irritated tone of voice while killing someone with his bare hands.\n\nAfter this Harry was called the “Boy-Who-Had-Everything.” Many reporters followed him around, hoping to report on something he did:\n\n“Potter! What do you think you can do?”\n\n“You aren’t going to believe what he’s doing with that lettuce! Harry Potter! What’re you doing now?”\n\n“Here is a wizard who has won war after war, conflict after conflict, only to arrive at his greatest challenge. And Harry Potter hasn’t even aged a day. He is carried into battle, a tiny, fragile vessel of human life, unseen behind shields of levitating wizards and witch-magic, protected from that which he fears most—death.”\n\n“ME!” Voldemort shouted. Do you fear"
