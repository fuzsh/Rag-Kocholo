At the end of each review of each episode on the list, I will recommend an \"Alternative\" episode that focuses on the same character or conveys the same idea, but the \"Alternative\" episode is actually good. I will review these episodes calmly and not go over the top angry and try not to attack Trey Parker or Matt Stone because I really do enjoy this series. Even the greatest and most talented creators and show-runners make mistakes, and these, in my opinion, are this series' ten worst ones.",

        "text": "Well, here it is. The worst episode that South Park has ever done.\n\nIn my opinion, this episode completely annihilates at least half of everything you loved about South Park. It actively insults Terrance and Phillip related episodes of the show and the movie. It ruined PC Principal by making him forfeit his purpose to devote his life to Strong Woman. By the way, Strong Woman is a stupid name. Miss Conduct is literally just Mr Mackey in female form. Lazy. Kyle stops liking Terrance and Phillip, which is out of place because the boys always loved Terrance and Phillip. It derails Kyle’s character by making him cause Canada, his own adopted brother's birth country, to be nuked, because he wanted Terrance and Phillip gone, just like his mother did in the movie. The episode makes you think Kyle is doing this for a good cause but he isn't. It is revealed that he was crushed that Heidi became a female version of Cartman. And that’s the thing: everyone in the episode acts like Cartman in this episode for some reason. Terrance and Phillip also have their characters ruined. Not just their personalities, but their character designs because they got old and grey because I don't know why. The Terrance and Phillip segments here are boring and slow.\n\nThis may be the last episode with Terrance and Phillip in it, and if that is the case, that makes this episode’s existence even sadder. There is nothing redeemable about this. For the longest time, Going Native was my most hated episode off the series due to its offensive character portrayals, lazy writing, and insulting ending, but this episode somehow managed to be even worse. I hope they never make an episode this atrocious again.\n\nAlternative Episode: South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut\n\nHere's why I loathe this episode with every fiber of my being:\n\nButters was uncharacteristically angry and hostile towards everyone. I thought that Butters was supposed to be the sweet, naive and innocent little boy with a heart full of magic? His behavior comes from nowhere (actually not nowhere because it is revealed in the end) Butters’ speech isn't funny because again, it’s out of character, and it could imply that Butters never liked anyone except Kenny and that Butters’ friendly and cheerful personality was a facade. The episode reveals that Butters was from Hawaii, which should have been established during his introduction. None of the jokes regarding native Hawaiians work in the slightest. It reveals that the reason Butters was furious towards everyone was that he was jealous of Ben Affleck because he had a secret crush on Jennifer Lopez, which has nothing to do with the rest of the episode. I find that a slap in the face. People defend this episode because \"it shows that nice guys like Butters can have a dark side\". Once again, it's out-of-character for Butters to act the way he does in the episode. I don't know about you, but I find out-of-character moments in media irresponsible writing. You created a character, established a personality, and should already know your character. Besides, we already have an episode about Butters’ dark side: Professor Chaos. That episode is better because because Butters is so kind and innocent that even Professor Chaos, his alter ego, can’t really hurt anyone, so this episode goes against that concept. That's the magic of Butters Stotch. Most bad episodes at least were meant to prove a point or parody something. This episode doesn’t even try to go into either of those categories. I believe it only exists just so we can see Butters act like an asshole, and that goes against his character. The only redeeming quality this episode has is Kenny's subplot. Kenny wandering around Hawaii was decent and although it was completely divided from the plot, on its’ own it told a better written story than the actual episode itself. It's a real shame that this episode is so bad because Butters and Kenny are some of my favorite characters in the show, and that this is the only episode where they share a plot together.\n\nAlternative Episode: The Last Of The Meheechans\n\nApparently, this episode was made in response to Isaac Hayes, Chef's voice actor, leaving the show due to outrage over poking fun at Scientology, his religion, in Trapped In The Closet from the previous season. This episode is a disgrace in every sense of the word. It ruins Chef by making him a pedophile. Why? What made Chef special was that he was always there to help the boys in their time of need and was basically a father figure to them. If they had the episode be about the boys going to Chef's house but is approached by his father, who was seen in The Succubus, telling them that Chef died in a shooting or a drunk driving accident, and the boys being sad that Chef is gone and that they missed their chance to see him again, that would be better because no Chef at all would be better than what this episode did. Another issue is that it recycles audio from Isaac Hayes, Chef’s voice actor, because Isaac wasn’t there to record Chef’s voice. No funny moments. Chef gets killed violently by animals. Chef gets revived as Darth Chef as a parody of Star Wars for absolutely no reason. This episode’s sole purpose was to spite Isaac Hayes for leaving the show.\n\nAlternative Episode: The Succubus\n\nKeep in mind, this is about Season 20 in general. The only reason I picked Wieners Out is because it's the episode in the season I hated the most, and it is a strong contender for the worst episode of the series. Season 20, in my opinion, is overall the worst season of South Park, and here's why:\n\nThe episodes range from mediocre to downright abysmal. The member berries are useless. President Garrison’s plot is boring, although it probably the best written of the season’s plots. The season ruined Gerald, Kyle’s dad, by making him an internet troll. Not helping is that this was Gerald’s first major role in the series. The entire cast of characters seem out of character throughout pretty much the whole season (ex: Cartman falls in love with Heidi, Gerald trolls, Butters becoming a misogynistic activist, Kyle apologizing to Cartman) Not as extreme as episodes higher up on my worst list but this is still some of the worst characterization in the whole series. Several plots were left unfinished. Not many jokes were funny. Trey and Matt rushed one of the episodes when they learned that Trump was elected for president when they should have been prepared for both outcomes.\n\nAlternative Episodes: Season 19\n\nI don't even know what the hell I just watched. Apparently in this episode everyone is gay for some reason and the characters even dress differently with very little explanation as to why. There is nothing funny or interesting about this episode. Not only that, there seems to be very little plot. It's just everyone in South Park automatically turns gay when homosexuality becomes the biggest trend in the town. I find it really sad that Brickleberry did this exact premise and had more substance in it, made more sense, and was funnier. I don't know about you, but I can barely consider this an episode. And you know what the worst part is? This is only number 6 on my worst list!\n\nAlternative Episode: Tweek X Craig\n\nUgh, this one. We're getting into the real atrocities of this show. This episode is boring and stupid. It was about the goth kids fearing that one of their members, Henrietta, who came back from a camp meant to cure her goth, is becoming emo. The episode tries to satirize goth, emo, and vampire cultures and fails miserably. One, there is very little difference between emos and goths, both seem to have the attitude of \"F the world!\". Two, plotholes such as Edgar Allen Poe. Did you really need to summon Edgar Allen Poe? What does he have to do with any of the aforementioned cultures? Three, don't even get me started on the \"goth\" version of the opening theme. I don't know who sang that but it's awful. If Matt Stone sang it in key using Firkle's voice that would be better,\n\nAlternative Episode: Raisins"
