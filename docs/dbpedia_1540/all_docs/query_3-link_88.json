        "text": "New York, NY -- The animated hit series, Brickleberry, produced by Fox 21, from Executive Producer Daniel Tosh (Tosh.0) and series Creators, Writers and Executive Producers Waco O'Guin and Roger Black (MTV2's Stankervision), returns for a second season. Thirteen new episodes kick off on Comedy Central on Tuesday, September 3 at 10:30 p.m., following the fall premiere of Tosh.0.\n\nIn the premiere episode, Miracle Lake, Woody discovers that Brickleberry Lake possesses mysterious healing powers and he, along with help from Malloy, attempts to cash in on the phenomenon. Meanwhile, Denzel tries to break the world record for having sex with the oldest woman on Earth.\n\nBrickleberry voice talent includes Natasha Leggero (Burning Love) as Ethel, the smoking hot top ranger; Tom Kenny(SpongeBob SquarePants) as Woody, the head ranger who has good intentions, but not always the best ideas; Dave Herman (Futurama) as Steve, the overconfident Ranger of the Month; Jerry Minor (Eastbound & Down) as Denzel, the African American ranger who isn't comfortable in the woods; Roger Black as Connie, the unusually strong and masculine female ranger; and Tosh as Malloy, the cuddly, yet vulgar and spoiled resident bear. Jim Sharp and Ian Friedman are the Executives in Charge of Production for Comedy Central.\n\nThe Brickleberry Web site will feature episode previews, highlights and photo galleries of concept artwork from the upcoming episodes. The Brickleberry Facebook page has spent the summer giving excited fans an early look at the upcoming new season including episodic artwork created by Bento Box Entertainment, as well as video and photos from the show's appearance at San Diego Comic-Con. The page will be updated daily throughout the season with new artwork.\n\nSource: Comedy Central"
