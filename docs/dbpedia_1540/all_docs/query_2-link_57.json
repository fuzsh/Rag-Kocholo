        "text": "The Venture Bros. - yup, people are right to suggest this. It's funny but it's also emotional, surprising and has some the best world-building in an adult animated series. The first season isn't great the finale tied into the beginning of Season 2 will definitely give you a true sense of what you're in for.\n\nThere's also an animated movie on the way that will serve as the ending.\n\nBojack Horseman - it starts as a milquetoast animated sitcom and gradually pivots into a drama that evokes bits of Mad Men and Breaking Bad. People are not pulling your leg when they say that it has some of the most accurate portrayals of depression in modern media. It can get almost too heavy at times but it's also quite beautiful and life-affirming as well.\n\nHarley Quinn - Since you list Black Dynamite, I trust that animated comedy is something that will work for you. HQ is comedy first but it's not a sitcom, feels nothing like a Family Guy or a Bob's Burgers. It does feel extremely similar to Venture Bros as most of the humor feels dry, conversational or self-aware of its own oddities. The first episode or two are misleadingly violent and crass, the pilot itself is a bit too \"try hard\" at times (the Joker scene in particular) but the show quickly finds its voice and increases it's priority on long-term character development.\n\nblood of zeus. the animation resembles castlevania. I enjoyed the show quite a bit.\n\nSeis Manos, and Trese on Netflix are pretty good.\n\nOkay, I'll add these two to my list. Thank you both for the recommendations. :3\n\nAre you avoiding comedies? If not, based on what you're saying, i'd suggest Bob's Burgers. It's the best show like what you're describing since King of the Hill. Later seasons get even more toned to the level of being a family show IMO.\n\nI'm specifically avoiding shows that are in the pool of crass animated sitcoms, such as Family Guy (and it's various spin offs like American Dad or it's knock offs like Brickleberry), South Park, etc. I'm not the humorless sort, but if the joke has a weak punchline or is just tasteless, then I'm out.\n\nThe Venture Brothers, if you haven't seen it already.\n\nA parody of genre tropes that became its own expansive universe of lore, it focuses on the adventurers of the titular Venture brothers, their super-scientist father, and gruff bodyguard. It's darkly hilarious and offers some of the best action in any Western cartoon.\n\nI've kind of fallen off the horse of that series after the Season One finale, but I guess it's as good as any to check it out the rest of the seasons with the movie being in production. Still, thank you for the recommendation.\n\nStar Wars: Clone Wars\n\nStar Wars: Rebels\n\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch\n\nNot sure if it qualifies as \"animated\", but Undone on Amazon Prime is also pretty good.\n\nI have checked out Clone Wars (both the 2D and CG series) and Rebels, but I'll check out Bad Bunch. Also, Undone looks neat, and I'll save it on my wish list.\n\nYoung Justice started as a kid's show but it's latest season have a TV-14 rating or at least has the sort of subject matter that'd warrant that rating on network TV.\n\nI actually liked the first season being heavily character-driven & sporting some fun (and engaging) character arcs with the main team, along with some solid romantic sub-plots that were built organically over the course of that first season. But I didn't like how the original team is gone and what time I've spent getting invested with their dynamics are nowhere to be seen, along with not having the new blood interact casually during their downtime or the team dynamics were never repaired/replaced.\n\nAnd don't get me started with how select members of the old squad had this big undercover operation and NEVER LET THE TEAM'S RESIDENT TELEPATH IN THAT HER \"FORMER\" BFF \"KILLED\" THEIR OTHER BFF. And despite Ms. Martian never figuring this out at any point during the beginning of the season, she only learns after she scrambles Aqualad's brains in retribution.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a team's dynamic changing overtime, but Season Two didn't have anything that I liked in the initial first season. So I'm hesitant to dive into Season 3.\n\nBojack Horseman - it starts as a milquetoast animated sitcom and gradually pivots into a drama that evokes bits of Mad Men and Breaking Bad. People are not pulling your leg when they say that it has some of the most accurate portrayals of depression in modern media. It can get almost too heavy at times but it's also quite beautiful and life-affirming as well.\n\nHarley Quinn - Since you list Black Dynamite, I trust that animated comedy is something that will work for you. HQ is comedy first but it's not a sitcom, feels nothing like a Family Guy or a Bob's Burgers. It does feel extremely similar to Venture Bros as most of the humor feels dry, conversational or self-aware of its own oddities. The first episode or two are misleadingly violent and crass, the pilot itself is a bit too \"try hard\" at times (the Joker scene in particular) but the show quickly finds its voice and increases it's priority on long-term character development.\n\nI'll check out Bojack Horseman, but I avoided it initially BECAUSE I thought it was going to be yet another Family Guy-style sitcom with anthropomorphic animal characters.\n\nBut given that everyone here is saying it's a good time, I'll give it a chance. I'll also check out Harley Quinn, as again, I don't hate comedy. I just hate comedy that's overtly crass for the sake of being crass."
