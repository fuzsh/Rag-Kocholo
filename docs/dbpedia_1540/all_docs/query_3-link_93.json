        "text": "Move over Yellowstone, there's a new national park in town! From Executive Producer Daniel Tosh (\"Tosh.0\") and series Creators, Writers and Executive Producers Waco O'Guin and Roger Black (MTV2's \"Stankervision\"), BRICKLEBERRY, co-produced by Fox 21 and COMEDY CENTRAL, is a new animated series revolving around a group of dysfunctional park rangers at a second tier national park. Ten episodes kick off on COMEDY CENTRAL on Tuesday, September 25 at 10:30 p.m., following the fall premiere of \"Tosh.0.\"\n\n\"Brickleberry\" voice talent includes Kaitlin Olson (\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\") as \"Ethel,\" the smoking hot top ranger who is transferred to Brickleberry, Tom Kenny (\"SpongeBob SquarePants\") as \"Woody,\" the head ranger who has good intentions, but not always the best ideas, Dave Herman (\"Futurama\") as \"Steve,\" the overconfident Ranger of the Month, Jerry Minor (\"Eastbound & Down\") as \"Denzel,\" the African American ranger who isn't comfortable in the woods, Roger Black as \"Connie,\" the unusually strong and masculine female ranger, and Tosh as \"Malloy,\" the cuddly, yet vulgar and spoiled resident bear. Jim Sharp and Ian Friedman are the Executives in Charge of Production for COMEDY CENTRAL.\n\nIn the premiere episode, \"Welcome to Brickleberry,\" long-running Ranger of the Month, \"Steve,\" feels threatened when a new ranger, \"Ethel,\" comes to work at the park to help turn it around. \"Steve\" does everything in his power to get her fired, even trying to expose her alcoholic past. Meanwhile, \"Woody\" feels that his roommate and pet bear cub, \"Malloy,\" could stand to lose a few pounds and puts him on a strict diet.\n\nThe \"Brickleberry\" Web site will feature episode previews, highlights and photo galleries of concept artwork from the upcoming episodes. In mid-September, the site will roll out vignettes to introduce each of the show's main characters. The \"Brickleberry\" Facebook page has spent the summer giving excited fans an early look at the production including animatic shots from BentoBox Studios, as well as video and photos from the show's appearance at San Diego Comic-Con. The page will be updated daily throughout the season with new artwork from the season.\n\nAvailable on-air, online and on-the-go, COMEDY CENTRAL (www.cc.com) is the #1 brand in comedy and is owned by, and is a registered trademark of, Comedy Partners, a wholly-owned unit of Viacom Inc.
