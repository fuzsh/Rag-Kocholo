        "text": "A Huey Freeman Christmas\n\nAs a leader in the United Church of Santa, no one is more excited about the arrival of Christmas, and Santa Claus -- than Jazmine. However, her excitement turns to horror when, while she's at the Woodcrest Mall to celebrate his arrival, Santa is attacked by an assailant who turns out to be none other than Riley Freeman. His identity as the Santa Stalker still secret, Riley then writes a threatening letter to Santa, complaining about having not been given the fancy car wheels he asked for. After he's offered complete artistic control over the project by his teacher, Mr. Ooberwitz, Huey agrees to direct his school's annual Christmas play. As planning for the project gets underway, Ooberwitz worries after seeing how far Huey is prepared to go to realize his creative vision when hires of Quincy Jones as the musical director. But when Huey arrives on the set to find his cast fooling around, he fires nearly everyone and prepares to start from scratch with an A-list Hollywood cast. As the manhunt for the Santa Stalker continues, Uncle Ruckus dons an elf costume and goes undercover to protect the mall's new Santa Claus. Still determined to get revenge, Riley takes dead aim at with a BB gun and, in the ensuing pandemonium, the new Santa narrowly escapes. Meanwhile, despite protests about the production's lavish cost, Huey and Quincy assemble a cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson, Regina King, and Alicia Keyes and, ignoring orders from the principal not to casts a black Jesus, they put on a critically-acclaimed production that ends up costing Mr. Ooberwitz his job. Finally, after he's recruited to fill in for the mall's Santa, Uncle Ruckus is left to console a disillusioned Jazmine."
