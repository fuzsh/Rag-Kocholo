        "text": "Shuler King, the world’s only comedian, actor and licensed funeral director, has taken the world by storm through his hilarious, real, and relatable videos commenting on everything that’s happening on the internet and in pop-culture. An accomplished stand-up and performer, King had to adapt during the pandemic and started broadcasting his thoughts from his car instead of from a comedy club stage. He quickly resonated with audiences and amassed a following of over 2 million fans across platforms with millions upon millions of views. King now tours nationwide to sold out audiences and is one of the most energetic rising comedians in the business.\n\nKing was born Frank Williams III in Sumter, South Carolina. He knew at an early age that he was destined to be an entertainer especially since he was the kid known for cracking jokes. King grew up in a traditional 2-parent household in the Bible Belt of the South, where Faith, Hard Work and Education were the foundations of what his parents imparted on him and his two siblings. Comedy is his passion, but he has taken a rather unusual path to get to where he is thus far. He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in Media Arts where he joined The Mighty Illustrious Zeta Zeta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Incorporated. In 2013 he graduated from Gupton Jones Mortuary College with a degree in Mortuary Science. When he isn’t on the road performing at comedy clubs and special events across the country, King works as a licensed funeral director and embalmer in Georgia and South Carolina at his family’s funeral business in South Carolina.\n\nCredits include WILD N OUT and the features HALLOWEEN KICKBACK, A DEGREE BUT NO DOLLAR, and A STRIPPER IN CHURCH.\n\nWEBSITE\n\nINSTAGRAM - 1.5 MILLION FOLLOWERS\n\nThe Earliest Show On Friday And All Saturday Shows Are 21+ | All Other Shows 18+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\nTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\n\nValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\n\nManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPLEASE DON'T PURCHASE TICKETS FROM ANY OTHER SITE.

With a recognizable name and an impressive reputation, Bruce’s steady style of comedy has been showcased across the country – on stage, on TV, in film and on the written page. His wit, ability to improv, and infectious personality set him apart from other standup comedians. Although known for his adult comedy, Bruce prides himself on not using vulgarity to win a laugh. He is no stranger to winning over new audiences - young, old, from all backgrounds - with every appearance he makes.\n\nBruce is one of the nation’s favorite standup comedians and can currently be seen on three national comedy tours, \"LIT AF Tour\" with Martin Lawrence, \"The Real Mike Epps Tour,” and the “Royal Comedy Tour” with Sommore. When not on tour, Bruce can be found performing at premiere comedy clubs across the United States. He is also featured on the Netflix original comedy series “Family Reunion” as \"Brother Davis\", a hilarious foil for Loretta Devine's character.\n\nOn the feature film front, Bruce has made cameos in Ice Cube’s “XXX: State of the Union”, “Idlewild,” and “Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector.” He also appeared in the Steve Harvey comedy “Think Like a Man,” the Chris Rock- directed, “Top Five,” and most recently in \"The Trap,\" \"Undercover Brother 2,\" and “Miracles Across 125th Street” with Nick Cannon.\n\nIn addition to standup comedy, film and tv, Bruce Bruce can also add author to his list of credits. Penguin Publishing released Bruce’s first memoir Baby James Brown, which regales its readers with hilarious stories from his childhood and experiences that shaped Bruce Bruce into the comedian he is today.\n\nBruce’s comedy can be traced back to when he was working as a chef directly out of high school, entertaining his customers with his humor while cooking up mean BBQ dishes. He then worked as a Frito-Lay salesman and managed to get hired to do standup comedy sets for their corporate meetings. Eventually, Bruce brought his comedy routine to the Comedy Act Theater in Atlanta, where he instantly became an audience favorite. When BET’s “Coast to Coast” came to town searching for talented up-and- coming comedians, Bruce was selected and ultimately appeared on the show three times.\n\nHis career skyrocketed from there. In 1993, Bruce made his first appearance on HBO’s “Def Comedy Jam”; followed quickly by an impressive appearance on the “Showtime at the Apollo.” BET executives noticed and signed him on as host for two seasons of “Comic View”, and then as host of the popular comedian competition show on BET “Coming to the Stage.”\n\nBruce’s bigger than life personality has transcended onto the music scene as well. He has made guest appearances in music videos with Ludacris and the Ying Yang Twins (after being named in their hit song “Salt Shaker”), Quad City DJ’s “Come On Ride the Train (Ride It)”and Outkast’s “So Fresh, So Clean.” Most recently, Bruce appeared in the KEM music video, “You’re On My Mind.”\n\nWith great skill, Bruce easily weaves real life situations into comedic stories. He is a frequent guest on national radio shows and podcasts, including Kevin Hart’s “Comedy Gold Minds”, Marc Maron’s “WTF,” “85 South Show,” with DC Young Fly, and Netflix’s “Strong Black Lead.”\n\nBruce’s memorable comedy festival appearances include the prestigious, Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in both Chicago and Montreal, Laffapalooza in Atlanta, GA, and the US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, CO.\n\nWhen not performing, Bruce spends his time at home with his extended family in Atlanta. He is also extremely dedicated to his impressive car collection, which boasts two Harley Davidson trucks and four Buick muscle cars, among many others.\n\nWEBSITE | INSTAGRAM | FACEBOOK | TWITTER\n\nThe Earliest Show On Friday And All Saturday Shows Are 21+ | All Other Shows 18+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\nTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\n\nValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\n\nManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPLEASE DON'T PURCHASE TICKETS FROM ANY OTHER SITE.
