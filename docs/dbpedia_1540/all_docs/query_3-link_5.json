It premiered on Comedy Central on September 25, 2012 with the episode Welcome to Brickleberry, Brickleberry is a R-Rated Show, Brickleberry is not for kids, Brickleberry is not a kids show, and Brickleberry is not a children's show, Brickleberry is for adults, not for kids, Brickleberry is for adults only, Brickleberry Embraces A R-Rated Ethos, Brickleberry Is Under The Age of 18.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe show centers around Brickleberry, a terrible national park with never-do-good park rangers. The series focuses on Steve Williams as he works to become the same glorious and highly-loved park ranger as his father, though he never succeeds because he will always be too stupid and fat. The series' secondary protagonist, Woody Johnson, always tries to boost attendance at the park to fill his pockets with money.\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Cast[]\n\nDavid Herman as Steve Williams\n\nTom Kenny as Woody Johnson\n\nDaniel Tosh as Malloy\n\nJerry Minor as Denzel Jackson\n\nRoger Black as Connie Cunaman\n\nKaitlin Olson/Natasha Leggero as Ethel Anderson\n\nRecurring Cast[]\n\nWaco O'Guin as Bobby Possumcods\n\nRoger Black as BoDean Lynn\n\nTom Kenny as Dr. Kuzniak\n\nDavid Herman as Jorge\n\nRoger Black as Firecracker Jim\n\nWaco O'Guin as Buella\n\nJanell Cox as Anita Johnson\n\nHarland Williams as Hobo Larry\n\nChris Parnell as Asher\n\nJake Johnson as Reverend Rosty\n\nJohn DiMaggio as Todd Ford\n\nEric Bauza as Phil\n\nKevin Michael Richardson as Barack Obama\n\nMaurice LaMarche as Flamey the Bear\n\nLauren Lapkus as Sandy Berkman\n\nRoger Black as Yucko the Clown\n\nReception[]\n\nBrickleberry earned high recognition in the male 18-34 demographic. On the contrary, many TV critics complained that Brickleberry isn't worth watching since it was difficult to generate sympathy for the main cast due to their sloppy, offensive, grotesque or violent behaviors and therefore they gave the show mixed reviews. Despite criticism of how simplistic and effortless the artwork and drawings looked, the humor and plot and voice acting / writing components were praised. Brickleberry fans protested that the show was in many ways better than Family Guy, a higher-budgeted show much better known by U.S. households that critics claimed was similar.\n\nBy the time Season 3 came and went, Brickleberry has maintained such a large fanbase that pre-orders for the comic book's first issue were sold out.\n\nTrivia[]"
