        "text": "Dynamite Entertainment has partnered with Bento Box Entertainment to release a new series based on the Comedy Central animated series Brickleberry.\n\nCreated by Waco O’Guin and Roger Black, the series premiered in 2012 and followed the lives of federal park rangers, including Woody Johnson, who worked in a fictitious Brickleberry National Park. The series ran for three seasons. Dynamite is now working with the show’s creators to craft a series which picks up right where the show’s season finale left off.\n\n“We truly believe this series will make all our Brickleberry fans very happy,” said co-creator Roger Black. “Also, we are thrilled at the possibility of reaching the tons of comic book fans who might not yet know of the show.”\n\nDynamite previously partnered with Bento Box to produce Bob’s Burgers comic books (see “New 'Bob's Burgers' Ongoing Series”)."
