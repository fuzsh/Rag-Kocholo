        "meta_description": "As an enduring and iconic symbol of post-World War II Japanese cinematic history, Godzilla is frequently referenced and parodied in popular culture. Godzilla and other icons of the kaiju genre have appeared in a variety of mediums ranging from cartoons, films, literature, television series, comics and video games. Often it is Godzilla's name, his design and/or the style of his films (e.g., where he demolishes cities) that is parodied the most. Godzilla's name is also often referenced by attaching the suffix \"-zilla\" to a word and/or phrase in order to denote size or monstrous/destructive behavior. The following is a list of such references, organized in alphabetical order. While this page aims to be comprehensive, due to the broad subject matter, it is always ever-growing.",

As Sheen approaches Bonzilla's cage, the monster fires a yellow beam at him. Angry Birds Toons \"Dogzilla\" 2014/12/28 Everything about this episode of this Finnish animated TV series is a parody of the Godzilla film series.

Animaniacs \"Hercule Yakko\" 1993/10/21 In a pre-opening credits parody of Masterpiece Theater, Yakko introduces a series of catastrophic events culminating in the appearance of Godzilla who, after delivering his distinctive roar, proceeds to deluge the screen in a wall of fire. \"Sir Yaksalot\" 1993/10/22 A fire-breathing dragon is terrorizing a medieval town and the Warners are called in by the king to deal with the situation. They suggest consulting the war room and the cartoon cuts to a high-tech facility where several people are operating large computers and others are sitting around a large circular table. A Japanese general and scientist, whose voices are both out of sync (a parody of a common trope in Japanese giant monster films), are present, along with Doctor Strangelove and Perry Mason, the television lawyer made famous by Raymond Burr, who appeared as newspaper reporter Steve Martin in the 1956 U.S. version of the original 1954 film Godzilla known as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!. Mason has only one line in the entire scene: \"I fear for humanity.\" The intended parody of the aforementioned film and its subsequent franchise is clearly evident. \"The Warners and\n\nthe Beanstalk\" 1994/02/10 While trying to convince a giant (who looks and talks like Ralph the Guard) to eat gold eggs and meat instead of them, the Warners end up in Tokyo where civilians begin to flee.

Back at the Barnyard \"Animal Farmers\" 2008/02/02 Bessy calls Otis \"Cowzilla\" when he gets an idea of resuming Farmer Buyer's market after he has been sent to the hospital by a tractor accident that was unintentionally caused by Otis. \"Plucky and Me\" 2011/10/03 When the other barn animals discover Plucky, who is a dinosaur, Pip says \"That's a Godzilla!\". Later, when Mrs. Beady is captured by Plucky, she calls the police and says \"I've been captured by a Godzilla!\". The policeman later says \"Time to hunt some Zilla.\" Afterwards, Plucky gets on top of the farmhouse holding Mrs. Beady in his hand, and the policeman comes in a plane and starts shooting at Plucky (which is a reference to the original King Kong film). The policeman hits Plucky with a giant ball of cheese and he falls off, pretending to be dead. Mrs. Beady then says that \"it was beauty that killed the beast\". Back to the Future: The Animated Series \"Forward to the Past\" 1993/9/28 Doc Brown, Jules, Verne and Einstein accidentally destroy the asteroid that was meant to kill off the dinosaurs and create a new time line where dinosaurs are in humanity's place.

Big Hero 6: The Animated Series various episodes In Richardson Mole's store, first appearing in issue #188, various action figures and posters based on the Monsterverse version of Godzilla are shown. The in-universe film character Kentucky Kaiju is also based on Godzilla. \"Baymax Returns\" 2017/11/20 While visiting Fred’s mansion, Wasabi accidentally sits on a Kentucky Kaiju toy that causes it to roar, scaring him. \"Big Roommates 2\" 2018/6/9 An advertisement billboard for a Godzilla-like monster film is seen on Gogo's hometown street which is based on the Monsterverse Godzilla. A Kentucky Kaiju poster is also in one scene where Hiro and Fred investigate a monster sighting (later revealed to be Globby). \"Aunt Cass Goes Out\" 2018/7/28 A film that Aunt Cass rents on home video is titled \"Kentucky Kaiju vs. Zombiesaurus\", though it is unknown what the Zombiesaurus looks like. \"Kentucky Kaiju\" 2018/8/4 A poster for \"Kentucky Kaiju\" references Godzilla 2000: Millennium’s tagline, \"If you can’t take the heat, run\". Fred buys a Kentucky Kaiju animatronic which portrays the monster in its films much like Godzilla was portrayed with suitmation. Baymax mentions that it was a mutant lizard like Godzilla was. Fred then builds a robot version of Kentucky Kaiju, making it the robotic counterpart of the monster just as Mechagodzilla is Godzilla's mechanical counterpart. Later on, when it is hijacked by Noodle Burger Boy, its eyes glow red and it goes berserk much like Kiryu did in Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla, where it rampages in San Fransokyo. It also breathes fire much like the Marvel Comics and Hanna-Barbera Godzillas did. Hiro lures it to the power lines of a railroad track, mirroring two scenes in Godzilla where Godzilla both destroys railroad tracks and confronts electrical towers; however, unlike Godzilla who endured the towers' electricity, the Kentucky Kaiju robot is not able to endure the power lines, causing it to short circuit and thus defeating it. \"Rivalry Week\" 2018/8/11 Fred’s Godzilla-like costume from the film returns. Fred also mentions that the San Fransokyo Art Institute mascot, Sabatini the Sea Snail, is a rip-off of his costume, making it a rival monster like Gamera is to Godzilla. \"Countdown to Catastrophe\" 2018/11/13 Fred rebuilds his Kentucky Kaiju robot after the events of \"Kentucky Kaiju\" (see above) to stop Obake from creating a explosion that will destroy the city, so Hiro hooks up a power source to it to make it jump and create a wave to counteract it. While it does succeed, it also ends up severely damaging it and rendering it inoperable. \"Nega-Globby\" 2019/5/10 When Globby and Nega-Globby are fighting, Globby turns into his dinosaur form and Nega-Globby retalitates by turning into his own dinosaur form with dorsal spikes similar to Godzilla's dorsal fins. When he transforms, he uses either the Showa Godzilla's roar or the Tristar Godzillla's roar. \"Supersonic Sue\" 2019/5/16 When Fred and Mole plan on seeing a marathon of all seven Kentucky Kaiju films, Fred mentions the final film being titled \"Son of Kaiju\", a reference to Son of Godzilla, which likely features a son of Kentucky Kaiju that is likely based on Minilla. Mole described it as a \"surprisingly emotional end to the whole saga\". Fred and Mole watch \"Son of Kaiju\", which was shown as Kentucky Kaiju holds his son while going out to sea and looking at one of the human characters as they both nod at each other, then Kentucky Kaiju leaves with his son, after which the film ends. \"Lie Detector\" 2019/5/23 Fred wears a Kentucky Kaiju costume as part of a monster training exercise for Big Hero 6 to prepare for possible monster attacks. \"Write Turn Here\" 2019/9/3 At some time in the past, Fred rebuilds his Kentucky Kaiju robot after the events of \"Countdown to Catastrophe\" (see above) and reinforces its exterior. Noodle Burger Boy makes copies of himself to distract Big Hero 6 so that he can hijack it again for his sister, Trina. Big Hero 6 tricks Noodle Burger Boy by asking him for help on how to finish Hiro’s story (which he had been struggling to do throughout the entire episode). This lasts long enough to defeat his copies and have Hiro and Baymax sneak into the control room of the robot in order to shoot rockets, which makes Noodle Burger Boy lose control and causes it to fall down. \"The Globby Within\" 2019/9/10 When Globby and Nega-Globby are fighting, Globby transforms into a moth-like form that is similar to Mothra while Nega-Globby transforms into a giant snake that is similar to Manda, but with its head looking similar to one of King Ghidorah's three heads. \"The Present\" 2019/11/7 When Hiro is looking for Tadashi’s present, he dumps out the contents of his backpack. A Kentucky Kaiju toy is one of the items that falls out and it starts moving on its own, only for Hiro to quickly grab it. \"Fred the Fugitive\" 2020/1/18 During montages of Fred attempting to convince Big Hero 6 to go on patrol by making homemade fake threats, one of these threats includes Mini-Max in a Kentucky Kaiju suit attacking a city background, referencing the suitmation used in Japanese giant monster films; however, the background falls down and reveals that it is a trick. \"Legacies\" 2020/2/8 When Trina is powering up the Buddy Guardians in order to generate enough heat to destroy the city, during the sequence a poster of a monster film is shown with a monster on it that bears a striking resemblance to the Monsterverse Godzilla, only with smaller dorsal fins. \"Mayor for a Day\" 2020/9/28 During a vision sequence by Fred explaining why traveling by kaiju would be awesome, in the sequence a Kentucky Kaiju-based bus is battling Richardson Mole's own kaiju bus. When the Kentucky Kaiju-based bus tosses Richardson Mole’s kaiju bus and breathes fire, it uses either the Showa Godzilla's roar or the TriStar Godzilla’s roar. The actual Kentucky Kaiju robot appears again at the very end of this episode, now being used as public transportation. Bill Nye the Science Guy \"Electricity\" 1994/11/02 While talking about how there is enough electricity coming out of a wall to stop your heart, Bill shows a giant plug and outlet, saying that it is \"Godzilla's hair dryer\" before a clip of Godzilla destroying New York from Destroy All Monsters is shown.

Challenge of the GoBots \"Destroy All Guardians\" 1985/11/19 The episode's title is a take on Destroy All Monsters, where a scientist named Dr. Eiji Tsuburaya creates three giant monsters from cloned dinosaurs created from fossils and uses a ray gun to turn them into the monsters Ichigar, Kaitodan and Jerigan (based on Godzilla, Rodan and Baragon, respectively), only for Cy-Kill, the leader of the Renegades, to take control of the monsters in order to cause destruction. Cy-Kill's weapon, a dinosaur-like monster named Zod which appears in the episode to fight Ichigar while he tries to mind-control him, has the Hanna-Barbera Godzilla's roar.

It takes place in Tokyo, Japan in the year 1956 at Acmeshita Labs (a play on words of Acme Labs, Pinky and the Brain's home and base of operations in this TV series). In order to accomplish their latest plan to take over the world, Brain plans to use a newly-invented shrinking ray in the laboratory which he converts into an enlarging ray in order to turn Pinky (dressed up as \"Gollyzilla\") and himself (using the name \"Brainodo\") into giants so that \"Gollyzilla\" can go on a rampage through the city and \"Brainodo\" can save Japan, after which Brain expects that the Japanese people will thank him for saving them and their country by making him their ruler; however, the real Gollyzilla appears as well and hilarity ensues from this point on. In the end, the enlarging ray is eventually damaged and then goes haywire as a result, shooting out rays in all directions all at once and enlarging anything and everything around it (including Earth itself) so that the lab mice, even though they are still giants, are small once more in comparison to everything else around them; thus, the plan is defeated yet again. There are also a number of cutaways featuring a nameless Raymond Burr stand-in who only says \"Yes, I see\" several times throughout the episode (in the last of these, the Burr stand-in is then hit by the enlarging ray before he can finish his statement and is also turned into a giant, after which he enters into the story, fights Gollyzilla and then picks up the kaiju and throws him into the enlarging ray, causing both the aforementioned damage to it and it going haywire as a result). In addition, all of the human characters' lines in the episode (except for the Burr stand-in's) are out of sync, a parody of a common trope in Japanese giant monster films.
