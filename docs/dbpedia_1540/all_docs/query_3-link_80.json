        "text": "The American series Brickleberry, an adult animated sitcom, was created by Roger Black and Waco O’Guin. It premiered on Comedy Central on the 25th of September 2012. Brickleberry is about a group of park rangers who work at Brickleberry National Park. The series only lasted three seasons ending on April the 14th 2015, totalling 36 episodes. The composers consisted of Nicolas Barry, Tomas Jacobi, Rene Garza Aldape and Alejandro Valencia. The voices were performed by Daniel Tosh as Malloy, David Herman as Steve, Jerry Minor as Denzel, Kaitlin Olson as Ethel, Roger Black as Connie, Tom Kenny as Woody.\n\nBrickleberry Theme Song\n\nClick HERE to Listen\n\nThe welcome to Brickleberry theme song and score was created by a team that consisted of; Nicolas Barry, Rene Garza Aldape, Alejandro Valencia, Matthew Chastain, Benny Holst and Tomas Jacobi. It begin’s with flutes, soon followed by pianos, violins and I believe I can also here clarinet. This piece was performed by an orchestra in a slightly reverberant room. The extra noises on top of the orchestral piece, such as the ambience of birds and forest noises and also the noises of the animals mating, hides a lot of the reverberance very well. This gives the song a very open and clean feel. After the first bit of dialogue comes the main Brickleberry theme song. This is the same orchestra, however, the trumpets, trombones and also chimes come in at this part and take lead.\n\nList Of Foley and ideas of what it could have been made from\n\nScene 1 (Outside in Bush):\n\nHead scratch = I think this sound was made from a head scratch\n\nFootsteps on grass = = I think this sound was made from someone walking on fake grass inside a studio\n\nwheeling wheelchair= = I think this sound was made from a really squeaky old wheel\n\nhitting wheelchair against bin= I think this was made from someone hitting a big hard metal object with a lot of items inside.\n\nlighting fire (sparks rubbing metal together) = I think this sound was made from a two pieces of metal rubbing together.\n\nThrowing metal on the ground = I think this sound was made from two metal object bring thrown on the ground.\n\nLiquid in bottle (Lighter fluid slushing around) = I think this sound was made from a bottle with liquid in it being shaken.\n\nSquirting lighter fluid on fire = I think this sound was made from liquid being squirted out of a bottle.\n\nShaking lighter fluid = I think this sound was made from a bottle with liquid in it being shaken around.\n\nThrows through air = I think this sound was made from throwing a bottle through the air.\n\nLights match = I think this sound was made from lighting a match\n\nRunning = I think this sound was made from someone running on the inside grass\n\nThumping into bear = I think this sound was made from something being thumped against a human body, with possibly some low-end EQ being added.\n\nWhoosh of flames = I think this sound was made from something being whooshed through the air and then being cut up to make it short and then possibly pitched.\n\nSizzling of fire = I think this sound was made from scratching cellophane together.\n\nHitting on head with shovel = = I think this sound was made from a shovel being hit against a hard object. Probably could have added some low end or hit it against something more solid as the sustain and transience are very long and large.\n\nPause button on remote = I think this sound was made from a click on an umbrella.\n\nScene 2 (Ranger Station):\n\nFootsteps on wooden floor = I think this sound was made from footsteps on a wooden floor\n\nWhooshing through air as photos change = I think this sound was made from something light but medium size being swooshed really fast through the air.\n\nChips crunching = I think this sound was made from a someone eating chips.\n\nPlacing box of chocolate down = I think this sound was made from a box full being placed on a table.\n\nScratching back of neck = I think this sound was made from scratching on the back of a neck.\n\nLeg slap = I think this sound was made from a slap on the leg.\n\nThrows/ pushes box of chocolate on ground = I think this sound was made from a box full of light small objects being thrown on the floor.\n\nSweeping chocolate together = I think this sound was made from the objects in the box being pushed around the floor.\n\nPulls down graph = I think this sound was made from an umbrella being pulled up.\n\nFootsteps on wooden floor = I think this sound was made from footsteps on a wooden floor\n\nEating ice cream = I think this sound was made from someone making eating noises.\n\nGong hit= I think this sound was made from an actual gong hit or possibly a cymbal hit, EQed.\n\nEating bun = I think this sound was made from someone making eating noises.\n\nHead rub = I think this sound was made from someone rubbing their head.\n\nShaking the aids = I think this sound was made from shaking a shaker.\n\nDoor squeak open = I think this sound was made from a squeaky door.\n\nTurns on light switch = I think this sound was made from any switch being flicked.\n\nSwooshing change of scene = I think this sound was made from something light but medium size being swooshed really fast through the air.\n\nGrowling = I think this sound was made from a sampled animals growl\n\nTaking lollipop out of mouth = I think this sound was made from mouth noises.\n\nPatt on back of bear = I think this sound was made from patting a stuffed toy layered with patting a human because of the high and low end.\n\nDoor opening and closing = I think this sound was made from an actual door opening and closing.\n\nSliding feet backwards= I think this sound was made from someone sliding their feet backwards along a wooden floor.\n\nFalling over = I think this sound was made from dropping something large.\n\nSound Design\n\nI don’t believe that there is much sound design in this scene if any. a lot of the sounds sound extremely common and sampled. For example, the chimes when there is a change of scene and the car crashes.\n\nReferences\n\n“Brickleberry” Welcome to Brickleberry (2012). (2015). IMDb.
