        "text": "Brickleberry: That Brother's My Father is another outstanding and nuanced riff on high impact issues through the guise of a cartoon show. The writers must be applauded for their handling of hot button topics such as race, caring for the elderly,ageism and the cost entertainment game-shows can have on their fan bases. Without going into specifics I can only say that the show tactfully touches on these multiple issues and provides a rather comedic backdrop to it all. This was a Ethel and Woody episode with those two normally supporting characters taking center stage to deal with family and fame respectively. I don't want to give away the fun so I'll just say run don't walk to secure a viewing of this episode, preferably in a discussion group, or at a high society museum get together. Also highly appropriate for after church viewings during Sunday school, that cute little bear will keep the little one's attention with out exposing them to the plethora of negative influences that abound the liberal media."
