The short ends with Yoshi going down the same road the Bros. did, but instead going left at the fork in the road. He ends up in Raccoon City, the setting of various Resident Evil games after exclaiming, \"Raccoon City sounds lovely!\". While driving through the destroyed city, Yoshi is attacked and eaten by several zombies, with his head falling off.\n\nDuring the sketch, Mario and Luigi's wanted level rises to a maximum of five stars; the Grand Theft Auto series does not use this as a maximum until Grand Theft Auto V.\n\nIn one skit, \"I Keep It Now\", Donkey Kong throws barrels at Mario, but Mario takes one and leaves because DK does not know that his barrels have significant cash value.\n\nToad appeared in the Robot Chicken sketch called \"I'm the Best\" in the episode, \"Due to Constraints of Time and Budget\". In the sketch, Toad appears as the getaway driver for a group of robbers following a bank heist and had outrun the cops using his own kart from the Mario Kart series. During the chase, Toad used many items from the Mario Kart games as well including Banana Peels, Koopa Shells, Stars and even the Golden Mushroom. The items were easily accessed as he just had to press buttons in his kart. However he and the robbers were sent over a cliff once one panicking robber pressed a button that launches a spiny blue shell which soon hits them, as Toad claims that these shells seek out the lead kart (referencing its function in the Mario Kart series). When they were hit, the word \"BOOM\" appeared below the kart, and the kart begins to smoke. This references to Mario Kart 64 when a player is hit with something other than a Banana, Green Shell, and/or some course obstacles and how they use many examples of onomatopoeia (such as \"CRASH\" and \"WHIRRRRRR\"). The scene is based off of the beginning scene from the movie The Transporter. The setting at the end seems to be Yoshi Valley, as Toad mentions that the police would not be able to find or catch up to them there.\n\n\"I'm the best!\" is one of Toad's quotes from Mario Kart 64; he says this when he wins a race or battle.\n\nAnother segment features Mario meeting Princess Peach's parents. After Mario eats some mushroom soup, he sneezes and turns into Super Mario, claiming he \"has a few allergies\". Mario accidentally knocks a flower pot which turns him into Fire Mario and then he sneezes fireballs. Mario sneezes again causing a Green Shell to rebound from three Question Blocks and Peach's Castle begins to collapse.\n\nIn the \"Ballad of Gay Tony\" sketch, during the first few seconds, the Nintendo logo and various other video game logos are shown. In the top-right corner, there is a red logo which is cut off, featuring a \"SU\" over a \"MA\", a reference to the Super Mario logo. Princess Peach also makes an appearance, when Anthony \"Gay Tony\" Prince of the Grand Theft Auto series sings \"Everyone's trying to save the Princess, but who's gonna save the Prince?\" another nod to Super Mario. The Wii is also referenced.\n\nMario appears in \"The Fattest Fat Loser\" as one of the contestants, along with Miss Piggy, Winnie the Pooh, and Garfield the cat. He explains that he is on the show because while he and \"his brother\" used to be identical (referencing Luigi's status as a palette swap in the earliest Mario games), he has gradually grown fatter over the years, and if he does not shape up, doctors predict that he will become a grotesque, hideous blob. Barbie, the host and personal trainer of the show, calls him \"Super Lard-io\" to motivate him in the gym. Mario comes in second place in the \"Trigger Food Wheelbarrow Race\", losing to Miss Piggy; when Piggy comments on the heat, Mario hallucinates that she is actually his \"mama's prosciutto\" and tries eating her, inadvertently knocking Miss Piggy into the campfire that served as the group's finish line. He then tells Winnie and Garfield to \"let her cook\", and joins them in devouring her, growing enormously fat in the final moments of the show and losing to her, despite that she died.\n\nMario has appeared in his own skit, \"Thank You Mario!\" In this skit, Mario defeats Bowser, and Toad says his line \"Thank you Mario! But our Princess is in another castle!\", and Mario jumps offscreen. It turns out it was all a trick because Princess Toadstool claims that Mario is a stalker.\n\nMany other characters debut in Robot Chicken (such as Toadette, Birdo, Bowser, Waluigi, and Baby Mario) in the skit, \"Mario Party\". On a routine Mushroom Kingdom stroll, the Bros. happen upon a pair of multi-coin blocks. The two abuse the block's resources to buy a mansion, several Karts, and to generally drown in debauchery, much to Bowser's disappointment. Reality sets in as bills pile up and the block's coins run out. With the mansion demolished and Bowser satisfied with his new wife, Peach and the Bros. eventually turn into a stereotypical Italian family, as we see in a future scene.\n\nIn one skit, \"Kirby's Secret Problem\", Yoshi is talking with Kirby on the phone. Yoshi said he \"was a pig\" on this day and ate about 50 pieces of fruit. Kirby brags that he literally inhaled 20 enemies, and said he was glad that he exhaled most of them. A shocked Yoshi asked if Kirby was still doing that (Kirby promised he would not \"binge and purge\" anymore), but then Kirby hangs up, saying he \"does not need that noise\" and then suddenly vomits out a Waddle Dee, who says \"Hey, it's none of my business, but, you have a problem.\"\n\nThere was a Nintendo E3 event skit that starred Mario, Wario, Peach, Bowser, Ganondorf, Fox McCloud, Link, Toon Link, and Little Mac. Mario walked out of the event, while Bowser was trying to apologize to Peach for abducting her too many times. Mario later came back to help Reggie Fils-Aimé fight off the villains. In that same skit, Reggie also uses a Fire Flower, which turns his clothes red and white.\n\nIn the January 2018 skit, \"The Smashing Games\" (a double parody of the Super Smash Bros. series and The Hunger Games, centered on the female Villager), Mario, Wario, and a Bob-omb appear alongside several other characters and objects featured in the Smash Bros. games. Also, Mario is Missing! and Donkey Kong Hockey are jokingly name-dropped as previous works of Nintendo.\n\nAnother skit parodies the Mario Kart series again, this time by having Mario give a girl a driving exam by having her partake in a Balloon Battle against Toad, Donkey Kong, and Bowser. While she succeeds in defeating all three using various items from the series, such as a Banana Peel and a Super Star, she is forced to start over due to not activating her turn signal while taking a left turn. Mario tells her to \"press Start to try again\". The \"Start\" button is on his groin, to the student's disgust.\n\nIn one skit made in tandem with Nintendo for E3, a Fire Flower appears, with Reggie Fils-Aimé, at that time the head of Nintendo's American branch, presenting it to the audience before putting it inside himself, causing his clothes to flash colors.\n\nA sketch from \"Spike Fraser in: Should I Happen to Back Into a Horse\" reveals a Bullet Bill to be involved in the 1963 assassination of the 35th U.S. president John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn the episode \"Max Caenen in: Why Would He Know If His Mother's a Size Queen\", there is a skit called \"Mario Golf\" that involves Mario and Bowser playing golf together and having a casual conversation together. Bowser asks Mario if it was weird kidnapping Peach a lot in the past, to which Mario shrugs it off and Bowser hits the golf ball.\n\nA sketch from \"May Cause Bubbles Where You Don't Want 'Em\" has Peach break up with Mario in favor of Timothée Chalamet.\n\nA sketch from \"May Cause a Squeakquel\" reveals a family of farmers to be living in Moo Moo Farm, where they get paid twenty thousand dollars to have Mario and his friends race a few laps on it. During the race, Bowser runs over and kills a few Monty Moles, the racers set the farm house ablaze, and the daughter gets killed when she touches a Fake Item Box.\n\nA sketch from \"May Cause Involuntary Political Discharge\" has Yoshi killing Mario and Luigi as retribution for abandoning him. A later sketch has a Lakitu rescuing Thelma and Louise when they drive their car off a cliff.\n\nRock Lee and his Ninja Pals[edit]\n\nIn the episode \"We're Here to Welcome Gaara!\", Lee decides that he and Gaara will first do kart racing, as he thought of it as a realistic version of playing Mariko Kart, which is a reference to the Mario Kart series.\n\nRugrats[edit]\n\nIn one episode, entitled \"Diapies and Dragons\", Tommy, Chuckie, and Kimi dodge dragon eggs Donkey Kong style. Tommy also grows bigger when he gets a power up similar to Super Mario.\n\nSailor Moon[edit]\n\nIn the episode \"Jupiter, the Powerful Girl in Love\", when Usagi, Rei and Ami watch Joe \"the Crane Troll\" win a Sailor Mercury plush and a dinosaur from a crane game, one of the toys inside resembles a Super Star.\n\nIn the episode \"Total Chaos: The Messy Love Rectangle\", after Usagi and Makoto get in a fight with Mamoru about Motoki only liking them as friends, Usagi decides to play the Sailor V game after finding out that Motoki has a day off. The setting of the Sailor V game vaguely resembles the overworld levels in Super Mario Bros.\n\nSailor Moon Crystal[edit]\n\nIn the episode \"Usagi -Sailor Moon-\", Usagi dreams that she is Sailor V after playing the Sailor V video game, with the setting of the dream loosely resembling the background of the 6th world in the New Super Mario Bros. series. While being Sailor V, she attempts to rescue Luna from a dragon-like character, with Luna being a stand-in for Princess Peach and the dragon character being a stand-in for Bowser.\n\nSanjay and Craig[edit]\n\nIn an episode, when Sanjay comes out of the vid"
