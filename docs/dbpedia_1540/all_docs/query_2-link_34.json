        "text": "As a 80s British gayling with only 4 channels but much more interesting content loved Brothers and Hooperman.\n\nAlso have a vague recollection of a BBC series with a Phil Collins theme song about ex cons, some gay.\n\nOn British TV now other than the occasional high profile series, usually with Ben Whishaw, it's just wooden but attractive hunks in every soap. Much less interesting\n\nTwo shows that immediately came to mind are Third Rock from the Sun and Nowhere Man, starring Bruce Greenwood. Nowhere Man I understand being forgotten (it was on UPN), but I'm particularly stunned by Third Rock because that had a successful run and ran on NBC at the height of the network's popularity but it's like no one has ever heard of remembered or even seen the show. I don't even think it gets referenced in any stories about Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I can't remember one time anyone going, \"Oh, yeah, he was also the kid who played the old alien on Third Rock.\"\n\nOne last forgotten show was The Job, starring Denis Leary. This was one of the funniest, edgiest TV shows to ever appear on network TV (ABC). I'm amazed it never lasted more than a season.\n\nThe Pruitts of Southampton. (1966-67)\n\nIt was on at 9:00, which was my bed time (I was 9) so never got to watch it. My parents said I could watch it in summer reruns, but I don't think it ever made it that far, and it's never been released on DVD.\n\nI would stall long enough to at least see the opening credits where Phyllis Diller would flounce around her mansion singing \"Howcha do howcha do, howcha do my dear. What a LOVELY surprise, nice to see you here.\"\n\nI would throw a blanket over my shoulders, grab a Tinker Toy to use as a cigarette holder and mimic her any chance I got.\n\nStill wonder how my parents could've been surprised 9 years later when I turned out to be a big 'mo.\n\n\"Woops.\" about survivors of THE nuclear holocaust. Very quirky, only lasted one season.\n\n\"He and She.\" I enjoyed the series, but it never caught on. Too NYC/sophisticated perhaps?\n\nWhat was the series where we saw four disparate parts of a man's brain, and how they were going to control and/or comment on his everyday life?\n\n\"The Tony Randall Show,\" and not just because it was set in Philadelphia. Well-casted, funny and fast, snappy dialogue. \"What's your name?\" \"Mario Lanza.\" \"Are you related?\" \"To who?\" And co-starring DL fave Rachael Roberts. What's not to love?\n\n\"Hank,\" about a young man who would sneak INTO college to attend class, aided and abetted by his girlfriend, the dean's daughter. Starring another DL fave, Dick Kallman.\n\nI loved Herman's Head. Some really funny scenes from that one. There was another show that I watched but I can't remember what it was called but I remember one line from the show;\n\n[quote]You look like you're going to happy hour at the Man Hole. - spoken by a female co-worker to a guy in a cowboy outfit.\n\nI think it was \"Up in the Air\" or something. I remember the main character worked in some capacity for an airline.\n\n[quote]\"The Tony Randall Show,\" and not just because it was set in Philadelphia. Well-casted, funny and fast, snappy dialogue. \"What's your name?\" \"Mario Lanza.\" \"Are you related?\" \"To who?\" And co-starring DL fave Rachael Roberts. What's not to love?\n\nA man after my own heart! I remember that so well. It was actually a \"water cooler show\" at my office and we used to love to talk about the episodes the next day. I STILL think of the \"Mario Lanza\" line every time I hear the singer mentioned.\n\n\"Hot L Baltimore\", a sitcom based on an off-Broadway play by Lanford Wilson. It was considered controversial and had a disclaimer cautioning viewers about its mature themes. The characters included two prostitutes (one an illegal immigrant) and a gay couple. It was produced by Norman Lear but didn't catch on with viewers and was cancelled after 13 episodes. Cast members included James Cromwell, Richard Masur, Conchita Ferrell, Al Freeman Jr and Charlotte Rae. I vaguely remember an episode where Ferrell, who plays one of the prostitutes, in convinced that Cromwell's character doesn't care about her. She changes her mind after he hits her! She thinks that if she can make him mad enough to hit her he MUST have deep feelings towards her. No wonder that show didn't last.\n\n\"Nanny and the Professor\" with Juliet Mills as a sort of Mary Poppins, Richard Long and young Kim Richards as Prudence. Very charming show.\n\nReruns of \"Love That Bob\" with Robert Cummings and Ann B. Davis as Shultzy; also, \"The People's Choice\"with a talking basset hound.\n\n\"The New People\" some sort of hippies on an island with Tiffany Bolling (her name was memorable) . I remember it was slotted for 45 minutes, instead of 30 or 60, and there was another show that either was on before or after that was also 45 minutes. Kind of weird, but I guess some sort of experiment.\n\n\"Davy and Goliath\" - a boy and his dog - on early mornings, it was claymation show which had a religious bent to it.\n\n\"Mr. Terrific\" and \"Captain Nice\", both shows with similar premises\n\n\"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\" - gone but never forgotten - so lovely they were, and from such a different era\n\n[quote]Get a Life- The weird sitcom that starred Chris Elliot as a thirty something paper boy. I liked the bizarre aspect of the show.\n\nI loved that show; it was so underrated. BTW, South Park ripped off the \"OMG, we killed Kenny!\" bit from Get a Life. It annoys me that SP gets so much credit for that gimmick.\n\n[quote]Parker Lewis Can't Lose\n\nA ripoff of Ferris Bueller's Day Off that was actually 10x better than the official one that debuted on NBC, which didn't even last the season.\n\nOh, you reminded me of another gem from FOX in its earlier days: Oliver Beene. This was a hilarious half hour sitcom in the vein of The Wonder Years, except it took place in the early 1960s. It was kind of groundbreaking. It did the whole Mid Century Modern thing before Mad Men, and the best friend was gay. When it was canceled, I was so heartbroken. It was such a cute, irreverent and charming sitcom.\n\nThe Goode Family by Mike Judge, who made a huge mistake pitching the show to ABC (because, IIRC, he was pissed off at FOX). The show didn't last a season and I don't think there's a soul that watched it or even knows it existed.\n\nSome other forgotten animated shows:\n\nBrickleberry--very Family Guyish cartoon show produced by Yucko the Clown.\n\nAllen Gregory--about an obnoxious smart kid who tries to go to \"regular\" school. I think he had two dads. Was hated, I guess because it was produced by Jonah Hill but I thought it was entertaining.\n\nNapoleon Dynamite--quirkiness meets King of the Hill, voiced by the original cast.\n\nR147, yes it was the ABC Movie of the Week that used Burt Bacharach's \"Nikki\" as the theme song, albeit in a highly orchestral version. It gives me the chills, too, for good reason. Some of those flicks scared the living hell out of me as a kid.\n\nP.S., There's another DL thread devoted specifically to those chilling ABC TV movies of the 70's. I tried to figure out how to link to it, but couldn't find it under the Help/FAQ's. (I see, \"Related Datalounge Thread\" all over threads on this site, but I can't seem to find out how to do this myself. Yes, I'm a dummy, I guess. If anyone can point me in the direction of Albuquerque, I'd be grateful!)\n\nBack when I was a kid in the mid-70s, (maybe '76-'77) there was a show called \"Almost Anything Goes\". It was a game show where people from one town/city competed against people from another town/city in really wacky games. It might have been syndicated, I seem to recall watching it in the early evening on Saturdays. There was a kids version too.\n\nAround 1979 was an hour long show called Cliffhangers. I think it was on Tuesday nights on NBC, not sure why I remember such random things. It had a few different serialized programs within the hour, that would end every week on a (wait for it...) cliffhanger. I recall one serial was \"Get Susan Williams\" starring Susan Anton, I think she was a woman on the run. But the favorite of me and my friends was a vampire serial starring Michael Nouri as a Dracula character.\n\nA couple of years later was \"The Two of Us\" on CBS Monday's for a year or two. It starred Mimi Kennedy as a single mother to Dana Hill, and Peter Cook was the butler who moved in. Dana Hill's character was named Gabrielle, and my sister and I would always laugh because the butler would refer to her as \"Miss Gabrielle\". It probably sucked, but 11 or 12 year-old me thought it was great.\n\nMid-80s, NBC had a show called All Is Forgiven for a while on Thursday nights. It starred Bess Armstrong as a soap opera producer (Carol Kane played one of her staff), who on a whim marries Terence Knox (who I had a crush on), formerly of St. Elsewhere. Shawnee Smith played Knox's teenage daughter who didn't care for her new step mom. I remember watching it on YouTube a couple of years ago, and while it wasn't hysterically funny, it had its charms.\n\nThere was a game show called \"The Baby Game\" where among other contests, people would put down their babies and have them crawl along a course to win points and prizes. I kid you not.\n\n\"On Our Own\", another Bess Armstrong comedy series. I seem to remember an episode similar to \"The Golden Girls\" where Bess and her co-star ended up at a nudist resort and using props to hide nudity from the camera, decided to give it a go. Someone was really pushing Bess back then, though she seemed to disappear after a few years.\n\n\"The Paul Lynde Show\", which I remember the promos, where someone asked him how the rat race was going, to which Paul snidely replied \"The rats are winning!\"\n\n\"My World and Welcome To It\" with William Windom, and sometime DL fave, Bess from \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" herself, Lisa Gerritson, about an animator based on James Thurber and his family. It was kind of whimsical if I recall.\n\nI remember many of these shows that have been mentioned.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, we subscribed to TV Guide, and I can remember the excitement I would feel at the end of every summer when they would publish their \"Fall TV Preview\" describing all the exciting new shows. Just writing this brings up the memory of the smell associated with flipping through a freshly printed guide, with its mix of full color glossy pages on the outside, and cheap pulp black and white for the local listings on the inside.\n\nA few that I don't think have been mentioned yet...\n\nLucan was a show on ABC in the mid1970s about a young man who had been raised by wolves. I had a boy crush on Kevin Brophy and wanted to go live out in the woods with him. Canceled after 12 episodes.\n\nLiquid Television ran on MTV in the early 1990s, in a late night slot. It was a surreal collection of animation and experimental live action shorts. There were many recurring bits -- Dog Boy, Aeon Flux, Stick Figure Theater were the most memorable to me. I can remember my roommates never wanted to watch it with me, because they didn't get it. Only made 24 episodes.\n\nSimilar to Liquid Television, KaBlam! ran on Nickelodeon in the late 1990s. I loved Prometheus and Bob (an alien tries to teach things to a caveman), and Action League Now! (a collection of action figures goes on stupid adventures). This was another show that most of my friends didn't get, but at least it lasted for four seasons.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I hated the ABC Friday Night Movie theme. I always associated it with that Travolta movie, “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble,” which scared the hell out of me. I was terrified by the idea of someone having to live in a plastic bubble their entire life, or else they would just die.\n\nI also remember getting an issue of The Weekly Reader at school, which came out around the same time as the movie, talking about the real-life “Bubble Boy” who inspired the movie (David something). Knowing someone was really living like that freaked me out even more.\n\nThe NBC Mystery Movie family of rotating crime shows. Along with [italic]Columbo, McCloud, McMillan and Wife,[/italic] and [italic]Quincy,/italic] there were these and other now-forgotten series:\n\n* [italic]The Snoop Sisters,[/italic] a proto–[italic]Murder, She Wrote[/italic] starring Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick\n\n* [italic]Hec Ramsey,[/italic] starring Richard Boone as an Old West gunfighter-turned-detective\n\n* [italic]Tenafly,[/italic] starring James McEachin as a private investigator and family man; this and the TV version of [italic]Shaft[/italic] (which aired concurrently on ABC) were the first crime dramas with black lead characters\n\n* [italic]Amy Prentiss,[/italic] starring Miss Jessica Walter as the fictional chief detective of the San Francisco PD\n\nLove on a Rooftop - with Judy Carne and Pete Duel (who later on was in midst of the successful \"Alias Smith and Jones\" when he killed himself, unfortunately.)\n\nBarefoot in the Park - with a mostly black cast\n\nTammy - based on the Debbie Reynolds et al. movies\n\nThe Tammy Grimes Show - not related to the above\n\nThe Debbie Reynolds Show - good theme song and with Don Chastain (from \"Its a Bird/Plane/Superman\") and Tom Bosley\n\nYes, R309! I loved NOW & AGAIN! I think it would have fared MUCH better in today's t.v. landscape....or even just 10 years later. The digital effects they were using in 1999-2000 were much more expensive than they are now. And also, because of the way Glenn Gordon Caron worked. He was an auteur (sounds so pretentious, but true). He wanted to have his fingers in EVERYTHING...not just the writing, but the directing, which slowed down production. NOW & AGAIN would have been much better suited to a 10-13 episode season-format like we see now, not just on premium cable networks, but USA, FX, and other platforms.\n\n\"Lucan\" starring Kevin Brophy as the title character. He was perfect for the role; he looked very \"wolfish.\" The show wasn't on long, but I watched it because I thought he was hot.\n\n\"David Cassidy: Man Undercover.\" David Cassidy in an attempt to shake his teen idol status by playing of all things a cop. Tiny, cute David Cassidy as a cop? Viewers didn't buy it.\n\n\"Bosom Buddies\", starring a young Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari. They played two guys in New York who dressed as women in order to live in a building for females only, where the rent was cheap. It also starred Wendie Jo Sperber and Holland Taylor.\n\n\"The Powers That Be\", a sitcom about a Reagan-like President and his cabinet. The President was played by John Forsythe and the Nancy Reagan wife was brilliantly played by Holland Taylor. It also starred Peter MacNichol and David Hyde Pierce.\n\nMayberry, RFD - a spin-off of \"Andy Griffith Show\" w/Ken Berry and other members of Mayberry plus Arlene Golonka\n\nThe Brian Keith Show - set in Hawaii and co-starring Shelley Fabares\n\nFriends and Lovers - with Paul Sand - had the spot right after \"All in the Family\" back in the 1970s for a season\n\nThe Girl with Something Extra - Sally Field and John Davidson\n\nThe Courtship of Eddie's Father - Bill Bixby, Brandon Cruz and DL fave Miyoshi Umeki - actually well-remembered show but rarely seen nowadays\n\nGigantor - Japanese animation\n\nFelix the Cat - as opposed to Felix Unger from the 'Odd Couple\"\n\nQuincy, Medical Examiner - Jack Klugman starred - before all those NCIS shows\n\nMe and the Chimp - w/Ted Bessell (from \"That Girl\")\n\nMedical Center - Chad Everett and James Daly (Tyne and Tim's Dad)\n\nMr. president with George C. Scott on an early FOX network. I only watched a couple of episodes because I knew the daughter at the time (who is now married to Jane Alexander’s son - who was busted surfing porn of something like that) but I digress....\n\nThe Nut House from c. 1990 with Harvey Korman, Cloros Leachman and that whole Mel Brooks crew.\n\nPrincesses with Fran Drescher and Julie Hagerty.\n\nAnd of course, my favorite, Just the Ten of Us\n\nInteresting to consider the memorable stars of forgotten TV shows. Ted McGinley is considered the star of shows that had already \"Jumped the shark,\" (there were very few shows that he was on when they premiered, but he joined the cast on the tail end of Happy Days, Dynasty, The Love Boat, and Married ... with Children and saw them through until cancellation). But who is the memorable star of forgotten TV shows?\n\nI nominate Robert Urich. He was the lead on quite a few shows, but none of those shows made it into syndication; none of them came close to making 100 episodes. He was obviously very likable -- even after a show got cancelled, it would not be long before Urich had another job lined up.\n\nMy second nominee is Ken Berry. He had a lot of appeal in the 1960s, but was on forgettable shows like F Troop and Mayberry RFD. The Wow Show was probably the best thing he ever did, but nobody was watching. He did a bunch of guest spots in the 1970s, and today he's remembered as Vinton Harper on Mama's Family. Can you imagine the show without him? It's not a great show, but Ken Berry made it better.\n\n[quote]The one where we heard a baby's thoughts. \"Happy\"?\n\nI think you are thinking of Baby Talk, which was on ABC. It was loosely based on Look Who's Talking?. It was a single woman who pregnant from an affair instead of artificial insemination like in Look's Who Talking?. Julia Duffy played the woman in the first season who had a baby boy. The baby's voice was done by Tony Danza and George Clooney played one of the mom's love interests. In season 2, the mom was recast as Mary Page Keller and Scott Baio joined on as the love interest. I think the mom and Baio's character married towards the end of that season and then it got cancelled by ABC,.\n\nShowtime had a series called Leap Years that followed a group of friends from NY.\n\nEach of the episodes would jump back and forth between the present day and years earlier.\n\nThe only thing I remember about it (other than the fact that it wasn't a good series) was that Bruno Campos was in his underwear in at least one scene per episode.\n\nNBC shows I finally remembered, which all had decent runs: Caroline in the City, Suddenly Susan, Just Shoot Me\n\nFlying Blind, which ran on FOX and starred Tea Leoni.\n\nSpeaking of FOX, anyone remember Comic Strip Live? It ran Saturday night for years. I still have some old VHS copies of it. Also, Comedy Club, which was produced by Laugh In's George Schlatter.\n\nI think the Benny Hill Show has been completely forgotten. From what I understand, there was a concerted effort in the UK to completely bury his legacy, so it's as if he and the show never existed.\n\nOh, and one last show--Night Stand with Dick Dietrick! Anyone remember that one? It was a parody of a TV talk show but filmed with a real live audience. Not only was it funny, it had one of the funniest TV bloopers ever.\n\nI remember a TV show that was on in syndication in the 70s (kind of like \"In Search Of\", but it was all about natural disasters. They would tell stories of different hurricanes, or tornadoes, or blizzards, etc. My dad used to watch it, and it would totally be something I'd watch today.\n\nAnd... For anyone who was a TV Guide fan, I present the following Fall Preview edition.\n\nThat Was the Week That Was, it was a British satirical comedy news show. I recall seeing it here as a kid in NYC. David Frost was the host. Millicent Martin was on the series, my mom was a big fan, that's why we watched it. Most of the writers who went on to become famous: Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Peter Cook, Roald Dahl, Bill Oddie, Dennis Potter, Eric Sykes, Kenneth Tynan to name a few.\n\nThere was also a US version, with David Frost, Harry Morgan, Buck Henry and Alan Alda. Regular contributors included Gloria Steinem, William F. Brown, Tom Lehrer, Steve Allen and Calvin Trillin.\n\nR280 Harold Robbins' The Survivors is one show I've always wanted to see, since I first learned about it. It was the first hour long prime time soap about the super wealthy people, predating Dallas by almost a decade. It was based on the work of Harold Robbins, and it featured Lana Turner, Jan-Michael Vincent, George Hamilton, and Clu Gulagar. I don't understand why it wasn't a hit. It is the one show I have searched in vain for, for just a sample of it on youtube, but I've never been able to find even a short clip.\n\n\"Kevin Can Wait\" …. as a big fan of \"The King of Queens\" I was excited, but due to the competition with \"The Voice\", which I really don't understand my appreciation of, because none of these rather talented singers ever goes on to anything bigger, well, anyway, I kept watching The Voice even when in the second season of Kevin Can Wait, the actress from King of Queens, Leah Remini, sort of replaced the wife from the first season..... oh well, even all of that did not convince me to watch Kevin Can Wait. and now Kevin Can Wait cannot wait anymore. And I still have no idea why I keep watching The Voice, maybe this will be the end of that, i.e. me watching \"The Voice\". thank god for reruns of The King of Queens on TV Land.\n\nThe Uncle Floyd Show. It started as a local New Jersey kids show, but the host Floyd Vivino noticed the mom's were laughing more at the jokes than the kids.\n\nThen the show became more topical and oriented towards an older audience. They had musical parodies and sketches, with the cast portraying Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Meatloaf and many others. The show was very low budget, but hilarious. They also had some major musical guests, such as The Ramones and Squeeze. The show had the distinction of being the only English language show on the Spanish channel it was aired on in the East Coast.\n\nFloyd's two musician brothers ended up in Conan O'Brien's band.\n\nSlightly off topic..... What are the chances of success for a TV series with the following premise: Take an episode of an old/iconic/forgotten TV series and re-shoot it with an ensemble cast, and every week pick an episode from a different series. Play it straight, so to speak, and have the actors do it as originally done. Obviously, not all the actors would be in every episode, but it would be interesting to see how a new cast's \"take\" would be different from the original one. The same faces would pop up here and there, and, I believe, add some contemporary interest.\n\nI'm sure the copyright fights would be hell, but barring those, do you think this would fly? Would people think it interesting enough to watch? What if the old episode preceded the newly-made one?"
