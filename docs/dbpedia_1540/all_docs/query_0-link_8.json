This is nature in all it's majesty. Welcome to Brickleberry.\n\n[Recording of a Flamey the Bear (Parody of Smokey the Bear) commercial]\n\nFlamey: Only you can prevent forest...\n\nSteve: [runs into Flamey] FIRE!!!\n\n[Flamey screams]\n\nSteve: [He's using the shovel to beating Flamey out the fire] Hold still! I'll beat the flames out. [He continues using shovel to beating Flamey to lying on the ground, bloody, broken, and nearly dead]\n\n[Screen shows reviewer of the commercial watching the incident]\n\nReviewer: I like it!\n\nSteve: Good morning, Malloy. How are you?\n\nMalloy: Your head is enormous.\n\nSteve: Hey. Don't forget I'm the one who rescued you after some crazy tourist ran over both your parents.\n\n[Cutaway gag to Steve reading a book on safe driving, while driving]\n\nSteve: The key to being a safe driver...[He runs over and injures Malloy's parents] Oh my God! Wait! You're both still alive! I'll go call for help! [He tries to call for help but he trips over his gun and accidentally shoots them both dead] Shit.\n\nWoody: Malloy, you should be out there greeting all those tourists, because you're the cutest thing on the planet.\n\nSteve: Malloy. We don't want him talking to anyone. He's a dick.\n\nMalloy: Even your whispers sound fat.\n\nWoody: How could you say that?! Malloy does so many thoughtful things for us.\n\nSteve: Yeah, like what?\n\nWoody: Like for starters he made that delicious breakfast you enjoyed this morning.\n\n[Cutaway gag to Malloy shaking a salt shaker full of AIDs into a pot]\n\nWoody: And don't forget, he planned that surprise party for Denzel.\n\n[Cutaway gag to Denzel walking into a room with the KKK in it]\n\nKKK: Surprise!\n\n[Back to scene]\n\nWoody: Bottom line, if we don't get this park in shape they're gonna shut down Brickleberry. So, I've decided to hire someone to help get this park on a track.\n\nConnie: A new Ranger?\n\nDenzel: Old lady, old lady, old lady.\n\nWoody: Yes, a new ranger she was ranger of the month at Yellowstone.\n\nSteve: Ranger of the Month?\n\n[Ethel appears, Connie's vagina growling]\n\nConnie: Sorry, that's my vagina growling.\n\nEthel: ... Well, uh, okay. Uh, I-I'm really excited to...\n\n[Connie's vagina growls]\n\nEthel: I'm really...\n\n[Connie's vagina growls]\n\nEthel:...excited...\n\n[Connie's vagina growls]\n\nEthel: Excited to work...\n\nSteve: You! You're no den mother. You were here to take my ranger of the month title all along!\n\nSteve: [He walking away backwards, flipping Ethel off] Ooooooh! [trips and falls over a chair...gets back up and continues walking backwards, flipping Ethel off] Ooooooh! [offscreen; walking backwards almost crushing to the trash cans]\n\nWoody: I'm so glad everything turned out okay.\n\nMalloy: No, everything turned out fine. Except for the part where I was raped.\n\nWoody: Well, Ethel, looks like you get your job back.\n\nMalloy: Who gives a shit?! I got raped.\n\nWoody: Uh-huh. Steve, I guess you deserve to keep this for a while. [gives Steve the ranger of the month pin]\n\nSteve: You know what? I think it's time for a change. [He makes it look like he's gonna give the badge to Ethel but he just puts it on the other side of his shirt] Wow, looks even better on this side. It's like a whole different shirt now.\n\nEthel: You're an asshole, you know that?\n\nSteve: [laughing wickedly] She thinks I'm an asshole now. She doesn't even know that I spiked her coffee. Good think I'll never tell a soul. It...Wait a minute. Am I thinking this or saying this?!\n\nEthel: You spiked my coffee!?\n\nSteve: Oops.\n\nFlamey: Only you can prevent big vats of acid. [he gets knocked into a vat of acid by Steve, burns, and screams as he disintegrates]\n\n[Camera shows the reviewer watching the commercial again]\n\nReviewer: I fucking love it!\n\nTwo Weeks Notice [1.02]\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody: Trust me, I don't need a gun to get respect. [lays his gun down on the table]\n\nEthel: Steve?\n\n[gunshots, animals stampeding]\n\nSteve: [slurring] Damn it! Come back here, chipyunk! Fight like a man!\n\nEthel: Hey, Steve! Stop it!\n\nSteve: Why? There is no god. What's the difference?\n\nEthel: The difference is you're not dying. [sighs] The doctor called last week and told me. I just didn't tell you because I...I really...I really like the new Steve.\n\nSteve: Bullshit! You're just lying to me so I don't blow Bambi's brains out. [gun cocks]\n\nEthel: Wait, Steve! Okay! Okay! Okay. Su--Suppose you are dying. Is this really how you want to spend your last few days?\n\nSteve: You know what? You're right. I'm wasting precious time.\n\nEthel: Thank you.\n\nSteve: There's way more messed up shit I've always wanted to do!\n\nDenzel: [walks up to Woody] What's up ya fat old mother--- [Woody grabs the gun] handsome strong [hand off gun] stupid ignorant-ass [hand on gun] all-around nice guy?\n\nMyrtle: Mother? I need to speak to you about Denzel. You can't tell me who to date.\n\nEdith: Myrtle! I thought you had a dialysis appointment.\n\nMyrtle: How could you, mother? You're going down, bitch!\n\nEdith: I just did, on the colored kid. And it was heavenly.\n\n[Myrtle and Edith are begin to fight]\n\nSaved by the Balls [1.03]\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve: Grow! Grow, damn you, grow! Or do you want this to happen to you? They don't even respond to threats.\n\nDenzel: We dead. I knew it.\n\nSteve: Wait a minute. I remember something.\n\nEthel: His testicles are producing large amounts of testosterone. He'll be full grown practically overnight. Overnight. Overnight.\n\nSteve: That's it!\n\n[At night, Steve uses Malloy's balls to squirting some testosterone liquid into the field]\n\nDenzel: Steve, have you lost your goddamn mind? This is your plan? bear ball juice?\n\nSteve: It's testosterone. Didn't you see my thought bubble?\n\nDenzel: Man, I'm getting outta here. White people do some fucked up shit.\n\nSquabbits [1.04]\n\n[edit]\n\nNative American Weather Reporter: Look like sun.\n\n[Another Indian runs by making noises and then it rains]\n\nNative American Weather Reporter: Make that rain.\n\nWoody: [mocking] Yellowstone! Yellowstone! Hmmph! They've got a cute animal. They didn't have 25 campers die in their park this month. BLAH BLAH BLAH!\n\nConnie: We shouldn't worry about Yellowstone. We could just make some improvements.\n\nMalloy: Here's one. [puts a bag over Connie's head]\n\nDenzel: I hate animals.\n\nMalloy: To be fair, most animals hate black people...............and Mexicans.\n\n[Steve has a squirrel and a rabbit]\n\nSteve: Which is cuter? I don't know. The tourist loved the squirrel. The hiker, God rest her soul, loved the rabbit. If only I could have both...but how? [goes into ultimate thinking mode] That's it! You guys just need to fuck each other!\n\nWoody: [shouting] Get out of my sight!! You're dead to me, bear cub! GET OUT!!!\n\nEthel: What a rabid gustation period. It must be their mutant DNA that might-\n\nWoody: [mocking] Deh deh deh, Science. Deh deh deh deh, SHUT UP!!!\n\nConnie: Ethel's right. Aren't you concerned about how fast they're reproducing?\n\nWoody: Yeah, of course, you agree with your GIRLFRIEND! I'm not concerned at all. More Squabbits. More tourists. [in a blaccent] More tourists, more money. Right Denzel?\n\nWoody: I am declaring open season on Squabbits! I want every poacher in the state here to shoot, stab, run over, decapitate, eat, kick, or fist those little bastards!\n\nConnie: Or we could just relocate them.\n\nWoody: We're gonna relocate them alright. TO HELL!\n\nPamela Anderson: Hello! Sorry, I'm late guys.\n\nSteve: Pamela Anderson?\n\nDenzel: Jackpot!\n\nWoody: What's that skinny old man with that tit-job doing here?\n\nMalloy: Winnie the Pooh never had to deal with this bullshit.\n\nPamela Anderson: So, cute! Need to hug. [she tried to hug Malloy and then she fall downs onto the ground and she get eaten by the Squabbits, and her poisonous body killed off the entire Squabbit species]\n\nRace Off! [1.05]\n\n[edit]\n\nKirk Sanders: Wait, you're not Vietnamese. [takes a closer look at Connie] Now I remember you! You are that waste of space that washed out of my program! I knew you would wind up in a garbage dump like this!\n\nDenzel: Hey, no matter what color I am on the outside, on the inside, I'll always be a dignified black man.\n\nSteve: That makes two of us!\n\nGay Bomb [1.06]\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve: Hi, brown sugar. You gettin' pretty for me?\n\nDenzel: Maybe.\n\nSteve: These are for you.\n\nDenzel: Oh..My..[shrieked] GOD!\n\nSteve: Wow. You really like roses, huh?\n\nDenzel: Oh, Woody, Woody, I love it, I love it, I love it!\n\nHello Dottie [1.07]\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody: What the hell do you want, Steve?\n\nSteve: Woody, as you know, I'm the representative for the rangers here, and we have some demands we'd like met.\n\nWoody: Demands?\n\nSteve: Well, maybe suggestions.\n\nWoody: Suggestions?\n\nSteve: Well, more of a wish list, actually.\n\nWoody: Alright, Steve. [cracking his knuckles] You want to negotiate or we'll negotiate.\n\n[Steve gulps and comes out to see the rangers]\n\nSteve: Good news, guys. We don't have that crappy health insurance anymore.\n\nEthel: Really? That's great! What insurance do we have now?\n\nSteve: None but this way, we'll be more careful.\n\n[Everybody groans]\n\nSteve: Also, you know what I really hate? When you're in your groove, rangering it up and then boom, you get interrupted by having to take a lunch break. So uh, Woody's gunna get rid of those.\n\nEthel: Steve, you're a spineless turd! You can't stand up to anyone!\n\nSteve: Yes I can!\n\nDenzel: Sit yo ass down!\n\nSteve: Okay.\n\nJorge: I've been looking for an act so unconventional, that it will SHAKE UP THE INDUSTRY! I've got BIG PLANS! I'm going to make you a STAR!\n\nConnie: Hmm, I don't know, Mister.\n\nJorge: It's Jorge. Come on, I'll even hire these two freaks.\n\nConnie: Okay, I'll do it.\n\nJorge: YES! [to Denzel] You'll be our new DJ and [to Ethel] you can mop up the peep booths.\n\nEthel: What?\n\nDenzel: Man, I hate DJ-ing. Wanna switch jobs?\n\nEthel: Really?\n\nDenzel: Hello no! I love DJ-ing. Have fun mopping up that semen.\n\nSteve's Bald [1.08]\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve: \"Fear not humanoids. Bigfoot is your friend, unlike that Jew-hating Loch Ness Monster.\"\n\nLoch Ness Monster: \"I HATE THE JEWS!!!!\"\n\nEthel: [shoots a deer in the head with a handgun] WHYYYYYYYYYYYY....did I enjoy that so much?\n\nDaddy Issues [1.09]\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody: Dammit you bastards! This is the bottom of the 9th! It's our last chance! [to Malloy] Come on, rally bear! Show some spirit! Why can't you dance like those black bears? [points to the Yellowstone black bears chanting \"Go Yellowstone!\"]\n\nMalloy: I am fighting the urge to say something horribly racist.\n\nThe Dam Show [1.10]\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody: I've got exciting news.\n\nDenzel: Let me guess! Judge Judy here, she buck-ass naked and a horny as hell!\n\nWoody: No, today's my birthday!\n\nSeason 2 (2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nMiracle Lake [2.01]\n\n[edit]\n\nEthel: So, what's this big important news?\n\nConnie: Yeah, Woody, what are we doing...[gunshots] uh!\n\nMalloy: Yes!\n\n[Ethel gasped]\n\n[bubbling; healing]\n\nEthel: Oh, my God. She's completely healed.\n\nConnie: And my rash is gone.\n\nMalloy: I wonder if it cures bitch.\n\n[bubbling]\n\nEthel: I think my hymen just grew back.\n\nMalloy: Don't worry. It'll be gone after happy hour.\n\nWoody: Rangers, old Woody has discovered a miracle. As you can see, this lake cures any ailment, from the common cold to cancer.\n\nSteve: You could have just told us.\n\nWoody: Yeah, sure, but this way was more fun.\n\nSteve: How were you sure it would work? Connie could have...[gunshots] uh!\n\nMalloy: I could get used to this.\n\nEthel: There must be a scientific explanation.\n\nWoody: Yeah, asshole, there is. I was chosen by God to heal the sick.\n\nEthel: And another reason not to believe in God.\n\nWoody: The Lord works in mysterious ways, and right now, he wants me to be rich. Sick people, lost souls, deep pockets, blah blah blah. Religion equals money! Now, we've got a lot of work to do.\n\nMalloy: Work? You were supposed to take me snowboarding today.\n\nWoody: Sorry. No time, Cubbykins. Daddy is God's prophet now, and I do plan to profit.\n\nMalloy: Yeah. Another scam that'll blow up in your face. I want to shred the slopes like Shaun White. He gets lots of ass for an ugly woman.\n\nSteve: Shred the slope? You've never even seen snow.\n\nDenzel: Wait. You've never seen snow?\n\nMalloy: Could somebody explain to the diversity hire that bears hibernate? That means sleep for a long time, Denzel, something you should be familiar with.\n\nSteve: Take it easy on Denzel. He's had a rough day...[gunshots] uh!\n\nConnie: What's wrong, Denzel?\n\nDenzel: Ever since I was a little boy, I had a dream. And then, I realized that dream. And now...[gunshots] Shit!\n\nEthel: Sorry, I couldn't listen to any more of that.\n\nMalloy: God, this would be so much more satisfying if that lake wasn't there.\n\nWoody: Connie, Steve, go round up every sick, gullible, emotionally needy, dumbass, lonely loser with a bank account. Denzel, Ethel, take Malloy up the mountain to snowboard. Stat!\n\nEthel: So, that's it? You're gonna exploit this lake?\n\nWoody: Exploit the lake and help the sick and disabled. Imagine what they'll do with a new lease on life.\n\n[Lyrics to Miracle Lake]\n\nWoody: Let me tell you a little story 'bout this here lake.\n\nChoir: Talkin' 'bout miracle lake.\n\nWoody: Michael J. Fox jumped in. Now he don't shake.\n\nChoir: Talkin' 'bout miracle lake.\n\nWoody: We got Stephen Hawking walking and talking.\n\nChoir: Yeah! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: If you've got cancer, this lake's the answer.\n\nChoir: Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: You got crohn's disease. Well, put your mind at ease.\n\nChoir: Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: If you go glaucoma, make yourself at home-a.\n\nChoir: Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: Thrombosis, therosis. It'll change your prognosis.\n\nChoir: Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: You got irritable bowel? Jump in. Grab a towel.\n\nChoir: Miracle lake!\n\nWoody: If you got leukemia, you can...(speaking) eh ... bulimia? Emphysemia? ... Screw it, just jump in!\n\nChoir: Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Take me to the water right now! Take me right on in. It's a miracle! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Miracle lake! Yeeeeeeaaaaaah!\n\nThe Comeback [2.02]\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve: Oh no! My leftover Chinese food! It's gone!\n\nDenzel: [has Chinese food] Steve, if I'd have known, I never would have-\n\nSteve: And look at that. Someone drew a mustache on my ranger of the month picture! Don't you people understand!? There's only one explanation! It's the ghost!\n\nDenzel: Yeah, uh, a ghost at your Chinese food. [hides the Chinese food]\n\nEthel: [holds a marker] And drew a mustache on your picture.\n\nConnie: And uh, got drunk and took a shit on your toothbrush ... Uh, I mean uh, what ghost?\n\nSteve: I never told you about the ghost that ruined my childhood? It all started 25 years ago. I got up on Christmas morning and there were no presents. My dad said the ghost stole them. Then the ghost gambled away my college fund, backed over my dog, and gave my mo two black eyes on her birthday!\n\nWoody: Back in the 70's, I made a living as a pornographic actor named Rex Erection.\n\nEthel: Woody Johnson wasn't a good enough porn name for you?\n\nWoody: Huh? I-I don't get it. Anyhow, porn was just one of those jobs you stumble into when you're young and new to the city and you got a DISHONEST PINOCCHIO NOSE FOR A DICK! [laughs]\n\nPorn Actress: Oh, no. It's my husband and his brother! They just finished playing 18 holes.\n\nWoody Johnson (Rex Erection): I got 2 more holes you guys can play.\n\n[Ethel protests against porn]\n\nMalloy: Oh, God. What is this now?\n\nEthel: Do you have any idea how demeaning this is to women?\n\nMalloy: ... Yes ... And no, you can not be in it.\n\nEthel: I would never be in this movie ... Wait, why can't I be in this movie? ... [self-conscious] You don't think I have trucker arms, do you? Is it my nose? [gasp] Are my boobs to small!? ... You know what? I'm not gunna fall into your little trap. [walks away before runs back; desperate] DON'T PUT ME IN THIS GODDAMNED MOVIE! PUT ME IN! MALLOY! PUT ME IN THIS MOVIE!\n\nMalloy: Fine, but I'm not gonna pay you.\n\nEthel: Yes, I'm pretty!\n\nMedium: Don't tell me about yourself. I'll tell you about yourself. You like to eat candy.\n\nSteve: Yes!\n\nMedium: You don't have a girlfriend.\n\nSteve: No!\n\nMedium: And you brought me here for some information on ... some subject.\n\nSteve: Oh my God! Yes! I'm looking for an evil ghost. Where do you think he is?\n\nMedium: Uh,...Ooh! The graveyard!\n\nSteve: I knew it!\n\nDenzel: Steve, can't you see this woman's playing you? This is bullshit.\n\nMedium: Oh, a non-believer. Well, let me go check in with the other side. [gasp] I'm sensing, your grandmother mispronounces words like \"Libary\" and \"Baffroom\".\n\nDenzel: ... Holy shit.\n\nChastity: I think I might wanna go to nursing school.\n\nMalloy: I'm pretty sure they drug test.\n\nChastity: Oh, well.\n\nDr. Kuzniak: You're a very lucky man, Woody. Everything's going to be fine.\n\nWoody: Great! So I can perform?\n\nDr. Kuzniak: [chuckles] Of course you can perform ... in stage plays, Lifetime original movies, even blackface minstrel shows. Just not pornography. You see, Woody. You're suffering from a rare ailment. Multiple sclerosis.\n\nWoody: I have multiple sclerosis!? SHIT!\n\nDr. Kuzniak: Oh, Heavens no. I wish you did. I said \"multiple scrote cysts\". As in, multiple cysts in your scrotum. Each cyst is a little ticking time bomb. Every single bounce of your ball bag brings you closer to death.\n\nWoody: Level with me, Doc! How many thrusts do I have left!?\n\nDr. Kuzniak: I can't give you an exact number, Woody but it's somewhere between, say 70 and 72.\n\nWoody: Soooo, ... 700000 ... 1? [pronounced: seh-ven-dee-wun]\n\nDr. Kuzniak: [laughs] If only medicine could be that precise.\n\nWoody's Girl [2.03]\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody: [about Astral] Hey, buddy, I would like to position myself in her lotus. You know what I mean?\n\nEthel: Pre-school field trip, and not a single fatality? Oh, how refreshing. Just doing my job. Head Ranger Ethel, over and out. [sighs] Good job, Ethel. Oh, thank you, Ethel.\n\nMalloy: Connie, I need your help. Woody's girlfriend is bat-shit crazy.\n\nConnie: She seemed nice to me. Maybe you're just jealous.\n\nMalloy: Yeah, and maybe you're just...ugh, I don't even have the energy to insult you. Just step on a scale.\n\nSteve: Hey! Where's all the Danish? It's Bear Claw Wednesday!\n\nEthel: Now, it's fresh fruit Wednesday.\n\nSteve: [he tries to eat a blueberry and he spits] This doesn't taste anything like a doughnut! I hate it! [he pushes some fruit all over the floor]\n\nEthel: Hey! I didn't get to eat yet! Uh, but it's okay. My motto is \"efficiency through positivity\". By working together, we can achieve greatness.\n\n[phone ringing]\n\nEthel: Sorry, probably really important. Brickleberry National Park. Head Ranger Ethel speaking. The park expense reports are late? We have those? I'll get right on that. [phone beeps] Sorry, can you hold? Hello, Head Ranger Eth...What do you mean the lake's on fire? [phone ringing] Oh my god, hold on.\n\nDenzel: [On a phone] Ethel, I can't come to work today, I'm sick.\n\nEthel: Denzel, I need you here. Hey, are you on your jetpack?\n\n[phone ringing]\n\nDenzel: No.\n\nBobby: [On a phone] Hey, look, it's a flying black guy!\n\nGuy: [On a phone] Maybe?\n\nEthel: Calm down. A badger ate your baby's face? [beeping and ringing] Hold on. My emergency scanner's going off! This is Ethel, what's your emergency!?\n\nSteve: [On a phone] Ethel, it's Steve. Did you know that Connie is afraid of raw fish?\n\nEthel: WHAT?!\n\n[Connie screaming as she running around from Steve is holding a raw fish while he's chasing at her around and she's jumps to breaking out the window]\n\nTrailer Park [2.04]\n\n[edit]\n\nBobby: Now before we do this threesome I just wanna make sure it ain't gonna mess up our friendship.\n\n[sheep bleats]\n\nBobby: Aah! Ow! What the hell y'all doin'?\n\nWoody: Evicting you for tearing up my park!?\n\nBobby: That wasn't me, that was \"Drunk Bobby\". If you wanna talk to him, he'll be here in 12 ounces.\n\nWoody: Happy hour's over, swamp people! You are hereby being kicked the hell out of my park!\n\n[An old air conditioner falls down with a piece of paper goes off and onto the ground]\n\nSteve: Huh. This looks like it's from the olden times. What is it?\n\nBobby: How am I supposed to know what the hell is? It's got words and shit on it.\n\nSteve: Wow...1880's, da da da. Civil War...Your cousin...\"Reginald Wooten Possumcods\"... Oh, my god. According to this, you're the heir to Brickleberry Park.\n\nBobby: Wooo!! Wait a minute, did he call me a queer?\n\nWoody: Give me that! Ooh...Actually, Robert, what it really says is, and I quote, there is no goddamn way in hell that asshole Bobby Possumcods owns this park!\n\nBobby: Don't get more official than that.\n\nSteve: That's not what it says. It says right here Bobby owns the park, and..[Woody kicks him]\n\nBobby: Oh, I know what it says now. It says get the hell off my property!\n\nMalloy: Great! So what's your Wi-Fi password? [pulls out his iPhone]\n\nBobby: The fuck's a Wi-Fi?\n\nBoDean: \"ObamaFan21\", capital \"O\", capital \"F\". Upper-case sensitive. [while BoDean gives Malloy the answer, Bobby slowly turns his head in shock to point BoDean]\n\nBobby: I don't even know who you are anymore.\n\nBobby: I'm gonna ask you all as nice as I possibly can: GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY TRAILER PARK!!!! Please!\n\nRandom Redneck: Well he did say please. Let's go. [all the rednecks start to leave]\n\nSteve: Drive carefully!\n\nSame Redneck: What the hell's that supposed to mean? [riot starts]\n\nCrippleberry [2.05]\n\n[edit]\n\nDenzel: Oh hey, Jerry! What's up?\n\nConnie: You two know each other?\n\nDenzel: Yeah, we went to middle school together. Hey, Jerry, remember when you sneezed and got Wanda pregnant?\n\nJerry: I'm still paying for that cold.\n\nSteve: [via computer voice] People of Earth. You are in no danger. Please remain in your homes. Ha. Ha. Ha.\n\nMalloy: [swipes the stick away from Steve] Give me that! You can still talk, you moron.\n\nSteve: Hey, give that back. It makes me sound smart like that crippled scientist, Tony Hawk.\n\nWoody: [referring to Steve's handicap] Oh, look, everybody!

This is not about some racist pill-popper with nice tits!\n\nAmber: Aw, thanks, Ethel. And thanks for coming to my welcome party. You look so cute.\n\nWoody: Amber, you are so sweet for lying to Ethel like that. Give me a hug. Now one from behind.\n\nEthel: Enough of this bullshit, Woody! We both know that she's not fit to do any job at Brickleberry.\n\nWoody: Sure she is. [to Amber] What job would you like, Amber?\n\nAmber: I like the baby \"aminals\".\n\nWoody: Good idea. From now on, this is the Amber Orphan \"aminal\" sanctuary, and you're in charge.\n\nEthel: Woody, you can't do that!\n\nWoody: Already done. Now cut out, Nanny McPhee. You're bringing down the party.\n\nEthel: Can I get something strong?\n\nBartender: Beat it, sea world.\n\nEthel: How's about you put me back in charge of my orphan animals?\n\nWoody: How about I put you in charge of getting you wall-eyed nipples away from me?\n\nEthel: What? I'm hot! I'm a ten!\n\nMalloy: I guess that makes Connie a 13.\n\nWoody: Look, Scare-A-Reid. As long as Amber's around, She's in charge of the \"aminals\"!\n\nAmber: Aw, look how happy he is since I took over. I got to buy some more pills. The red kitty dogs love them. Fly away, god's creature. [she throw the baby fox under a ceiling fan to get sliced into both the upper body and lower body to fall on the floor] Yay! Now there's 2 kitty dogs!\n\n[Ethel angrily groans]\n\nEthel: Jesus Christ. I can't believe I fell for her too. But that ass is so...no, no, no.\n\n[Amber sobbing]\n\nEthel: Amber, are you crying?\n\nAmber: I thought you were the only one here that didn't look at me like piece of meat. I'm sick of getting by on my looks. and because I never had to work for anything, I suck at everything.\n\nEthel: You could be a ranger, and I can help you.\n\nAmber: Really?\n\nEthel: It's not about looks. I know for a fact that you have greatness inside of you.\n\nAmber: You think so?\n\nEthel: Smell for yourself.\n\nSee 'n Say Farmer Says: The coyote says...\n\nAmber: A-roo!\n\nEthel: That's right! You're on your way to being a great ranger.\n\nAmber: Yay!\n\nEthel: I think we're ready for the \"plant or animal\" coloring book. Be right back. Oh, in the meantime, study these forest flash cards.\n\nAmber: Oh, my god. That's a...fiery! And it's right where the sanctuary is! This is it, Amber. It's time to be a great ranger! [she runs off]\n\nEthel: Amber, where'd you go? I was thinking we could do arts and crafts next. We can work our scissoring.\n\nConnie: Did someone say \"scissoring\"?\n\nEthel: Amber? Amber! Has anyone seen Amber?\n\nWoody: Ethel, I...I think we lost her.\n\nAmber: I did it! I saved them! [she release some animals after she save them]\n\nEthel: Whoa.\n\nAmber: Did I get burned a little? I can't really feel anything.\n\nEthel: It's not...bad. Here. Ooh, much better.\n\nAmber: You were right, Ethel. I can be a great ranger!\n\nEthel: So, um...thank you for your bravery, and um...\n\nWoody: Amber, you're fired.\n\nAmber: Oh! Because I have a couple of burns?\n\nWoody: No, because I can see through your face.\n\nAmber: Ethel, tell them what you told me, that it's not about looks. It's about what's on the inside?\n\nEthel: You know what, Woody? Amber's right. Looks or no looks, she does belong to Brickleberry. And I know the perfect place for her.\n\nCops and Bottoms [3.11]\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve: Dad, you busted more criminals in this park than any ranger, I'll find a way to make you proud. [his pants falls down] Starting now. [his spanx rip it off] Starting now. [farts] Ah, fuck it.\n\nMalloy: I haven't seen this many screaming Mexicans since bus passes went up.\n\nWoody: This is your fault, Malloy.\n\nMalloy: Why don't you just show it to them?\n\nWoody: NO! there's no way I'm showing my disgusting hemorrhoid to anybody! I bought this cream to shrink the bastard.\n\nSteve: I should've known I couldn't be a cop. I'm sorry I couldn't make you proud, Dad.\n\nJonah: [offscreen] You make me proud every day, son.\n\nSteve: [screams] Dad?\n\nJonah: You're a Brickleberry ranger just like I was. What more could a father ask?\n\nSteve: Didn't you ever get bored here?\n\nJonah: If I did, I'd just go behind the bush and masturbate.\n\nSteve: Okay.\n\nJonah: Son, be proud of yourself and what you are, a Brickleberry Park ranger. Now, get out there and take your park back, and If you need me, I'll be jacking off behind that bush.\n\nSteve: Yes, sir.\n\nSteve: I was wrong for not appreciating my job. Sure, being a park ranger can be boring and lame and put you at a high risk for lyme disease.\n\nDenzel: Now you got me wanting to quit.\n\nSteve: Oh, sorry. Fog brain. You know I have lyme disease. Now, I've got a plan to get these a-holes out of our park.\n\nEthel: Sorry, I was zoning out. I have lyme disease.\n\nDenzel: We know!

And it gives the park a chance to make a buttload of money off some sucker parents. So you sure as shit better show them a good time.\n\nDenzel: So we're supposed to chase these kids around and do all this extra work? What do we get?\n\nWoody: Well, the counselor whose tribe is voted the best at the end of the week wins...[imitates fanfare] the legendary tribal shield.\n\nMalloy: Like anyone with a brain could be motivated by a painted trash can lid.\n\nEthel: I'm winning this!\n\nConnie: No, it's mine!\n\nDenzel: Hands off my painted trash can lid!\n\nWoody: Settle down, morons! Put these on.\n\nSteve: Woody, I, uh, didn't get a shirt.\n\nWoody: There's no way I'm letting you be a counselor again. You're the reason we had to close the camp in the first place.\n\nEthel: What happened?\n\nSteve: I remember it like it happened 15 years ago.\n\nConnie: Steve?\n\nSteve: Oh, sorry. I thought you guys could see my brain movie.

And I don't want you to be my co-counselor anymore!\n\nSteve: You want to split-up the tribe? Fine. Let's let the kids decide who they want to be with. Me, the world's best counselor, or...\n\nFat Camper: Connie, we picked Connie.\n\nSteve: What?! I guess you four are my only campers. At least you guys like me.\n\nWheelchair Handicap Camper: We don't like you. You have our insulin.\n\nSteve: And don't you fucking forget it.\n\nEthel: There's a finish line!

But it's because of my animal instinct. I have heightened senses. Trust me, I don't want this gift.
