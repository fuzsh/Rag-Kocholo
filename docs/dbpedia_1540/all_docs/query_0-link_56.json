        "text": "Contemporary pop culture and media, especially the ones targeted at young individuals, are beginning to get the rightful recognition, deservedly so. Psychologists, researchers are shifting the focus on the validity of media (Broadcast media in particular like Television, Podcasts, in shaping one's perception of mental health and illness. OTT platforms such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hotstar, among many others, and the content produced on those have exponentially influenced the lives of so many. As they exercise more freedom than traditional media, they explore uncharted territories in terms of their content, as is obvious because of the lack of censorship. OTT platforms have observed an upward curve in their popularity and usage, especially on account of the depiction of varied themes and subjects like mental illness, therapy, and millennial psychology. Consumption patterns have shifted tremendously, especially in unprecedented confinement. Millennials prefer to consume a lot of online content streamed on these platforms. Qualitative descriptive data in the form of the visual text comes from the Netflix original, Bojack Horseman, while simultaneously applying autoethnographic research technique to understand the depiction of mental health in the show; analyzing the show's existentialist tools to relieve millennial angst brought on by the unbearableness of human existence.\n\nThe representation of mental illness and individuals suffering from a specific mental illness in films is a phenomenon encountered since the first years of cinema. Mental diseases in many film genres such as horror, science fiction, comedy, and crime are used as scary, laughing, or drama elements. The representations of various psychopathologies in the films give an idea about these disorders to the ordinary viewer. However, these representations can accurately describe the reality and also have the risk of being defective and incomplete. It is seen that people who have mental disorders in cinema are generally presented in the way that 'dangerous, violent, unpredictable characters' within the frame of limited and distorted patterns. It is possible to say that these cliché representations differ according to gender. Female characters with mental disorders are described as 'beautiful and troubled women' in cinema. Related films were taken as an example in this study and it is aimed examine the representation of female characters with mental disorders in these films.\n\nThis research sets out to analyse the current depictions of mental illness within movies released in this decade. The aim is to analyse mental illness portrayals through a medium that many within the public are familiar with and could have been influenced by (MPA, 2020). By doing this, the study aims to show what stigmatizing and stereotypical views the general public is exposed to. From 2010 to 2019, the most popular film of each year depicting mental illness was calculated using an instrumentation system and was included in the final list of 10 films portraying mental illness (one film from each year) which were the basis of the data analysis. The findings show that films were linking acute trauma with the emergence of mental illness, as 9 out of 10 movies show trauma in the forms of loss of a loved one and/or child abuse (psychical and sexual) as being the source of the manifestation of the mental illness. This is in line with research (Mueser, et al., 1998) which shows that trauma increases chances of mental illness within the individual and shows that there are elements of mental illness that are being depicted in a realistic view. Furthermore, 6 out of 10 movies referenced diagnosis or depicted characters receiving help from mental health professionals. Unfortunately, 4 out of these 6 films depicted these characters to be extremely violent during and after professional mental help which perpetuates the notion of mental care being ineffective in helping those in need, which takes away the positive influence the portrayal of persons seeking help could have achieved. Violence was seen to be one of the most prevalent stereotypes in relation to mental illness as half the films depicted characters with mental illness to be extremely violent towards other individuals, this shows that violence in relation to mental illness is still a popularized portrayal and could further enhances the view of fear towards mental illness. On another note, while violent depictions are still present, an element of empathy towards such characters was very apparent. This is a step in the right direction as even when the characters are seen to be committing violent acts, the audience will see the character as a person who has suffered and has cause for such acts rather than just being a ‘psychotic’ killer. Findings also showed that these violent acts were closely related to severe mental ii illnesses such as psychosis, anti-social disorder and DID. In comparison, more socially accepted illnesses such as PTSD and depression (Tsai, et al., 2018; Wood, et al., 2014) did not have connotations to violence but were rather shown as characters trying to overcome their mental disorder. These findings show that while there are some realistic and positive portrayals, mental illness is still being stigmatized and stereotyped. This highlights the need for future policies to target educating the public on mental illnesses, while also indicating the need for further research to better understand the gaps that need to be analysed and improved within the field of mental illness. Keywords: Mental Illness, Mental Health, Film Depictions, Stereotype, Stigma, Violence\n\nThis open access book examines the conversations around gendered mental health in contemporary Western media culture. While early 21st century-media was marked by a distinct focus on happiness, productivity and success, during the 2010s negative feelings and discussions around mental health have become increasingly common in that same media landscape. This book traces this turn to sadness in women’s media culture and shows that it emerged indirectly as a result of a culture overtly focused on happiness. By tracing the coverage of mental health issues in magazines, among female celebrities, and on social media this book shows how an increasingly intimate media environment has made way for a profitable vulnerability, that takes the shape of marketable and brand-friendly mental illness awareness that strengthens the authenticity of those who embrace it. But at the same time sad girl cultures are proliferating on social media platforms, creating radically honest spaces where those who suffer get support, and more capacious ways of feeling bad are formed. Using discourse analysis and digital ethnography to study contemporary representations of mental illness and sadness in Western popular media and social media, this book takes a feminist media studies approach to popular discourse, understanding the conversations happening around mental health in these sites to function as scripts for how to think about and experience mental illness and sadness"
