However, within the episode, there was a parody of the theme song with Bobby Then BoDean, Firecracker Jim, his obese wife and two rednecks, show up. Bobby and Jim give each other a friendly fist-to-stump bump. Then Jim bites BoDean in the gonads to defend his obese wife. The wooden sign with \"Trailer Park\" appears underneath the title, \"Brickleberry\". Lastly, a bird is seen flying until it was shot to death.\n\nCrippleberry: Malloy's robot is set on auto-pilot and wrecking up the forest.\n\nRanger Games: The skeleton of Malloy's pet pony who committed suicide by hanging itself from a tree appears in the background.\n\nMy Way or the Highway: The dolphin for Woody's governor campaign appears in the lake.\n\nLittle Boy Malloy: The animals Stephanie Bridges ran over are shown on the road.\n\nThe Animals Strike Back: Moose Nazir is hiding behind the ranger station.\n\nScared Straight: A tower for Comic Con was seen off in the distance.\n\nTrip to Mars: The intro is set at night-time and a shooting star can be seen.\n\nMy Favorite Bear: Flesh Devil, the leather-clad midget from the cold open, appears holding his dildo while cheering \"Yeah yeah yeah!\"\n\nA-Park-a-Lypse: Mt.

In response, Steve happily smiles.\n\nOld Wounds: Woody shakes his hips which he calls the \"Veiny Husseini\".\n\nBaby Daddy: The Scottish sock puppet sticking out from Steve's dick (since he uses it to absorb his jizz after jerking off) from the cold open is bitten by Malloy.\n\nSteve the Fearless Pilot: A pirate flag shows up in the opening.\n\nHigh Stakes: A giraffe appears when the logo is being shown, since Mayor Todd Ford was flying in animals from Africa for the sport of hunting them down.\n\nAmber Alert: Harold appears outside the ranger station.\n\nCops and Bottoms: Steve is seen with a beaten and demented face, thanks to the Kid having beaten him up as revenge for Steve's police brutality.\n\nCamping Ain't Easy: Ethel, Connie and Denzel are wearing colorful shirts to show their Camp Counselor ranks.\n\nGlobal Warning: Jesus is seen flying (leaving a trail of fire) in the sky.\n\nOther[]\n\nParadise PD Meets Brickleberry: The rangers are all replaced with the cops of Paradise PD, doing their standard intro stances.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nSeason 3[]"
