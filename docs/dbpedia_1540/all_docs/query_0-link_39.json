        "text": "Washington State is home to many interesting people.\n\nWashington has raised many great athletes such as Cooper Kupp, Brian Urlacher, Drew Bledsoe, and Hope Solo. A lot of great musicians have come from Washington, with a few even coming out of Tri-Cities, including an entire rock band.\n\nWhen it comes to technology and enterprise, who can forget Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos? Heck, Washington even has the whole serial killer phenomenon. (Hey, we have our quirks in the Pacific Northwest.)\n\nBut what about Hollywood? Yeah, we've got that covered, too.\n\nWashington is home to several actors and actresses.\n\nYou might not think Washington has a big footprint on the film and television industry, but it does and it's pretty impressive. Several movies have been filmed in Washington (like Benny & June), and others have been set here (yes, Sleepless in Seattle is the first that comes to mind). Seattle seems to have a creative aura to it with all of the artists coming from the Emerald City.\n\nIt's not all about Seattle, however. Spokane, Moses Lake, and even Tri-Cities have been home to some of the biggest stars in Hollywood.\n\nCheck out our list of blockbuster stars, television mainstays, and other accomplished actors who have called Washington home!"
