        "text": "Comedy Central might have ended the animated series in 2015, but the park rangers of Brickleberry National Park (and Malloy, the narcissistic bear) will live on in a new Brickleberry comic book series, announced by Dynamite Entertainment Friday.\n\nBrickleberry, a sitcom about a group of park rangers that featured the voices of Daniel Tosh (who also served as executive producer of the show), Natasha Leggero and Bob’s Burgers‘ David Herman, ran on the network for three seasons from 2012 though 2015. The show was created by MTV2’s Stankervision veterans Waco O’Guin and Roger Black, both of whom will be working on the new comic book.\n\n“We are so excited to be in business with Dynamite to tell more Brickleberry stories,” O’Guin said in a statement accompanying the news. “Our first issue is an insane tale that picks up where the Brickleberry finale left off.” Black added that the new comic “will make all our Brickleberry fans very happy.”\n\nThe announcement, made during comic retailer conference ComicsPro, follows Dynamite’s success with its Bob’s Burgers comic book series, which launched in 2014 and has become one of the New Jersey publisher’s most consistent best sellers. Both Brickleberry and Bob’s Burgers comic book series are produced in partnership with Bento Box Entertainment and 20th Century Fox.\n\n“We are excited to expand our partnership with Bento Box to bring Brickleberry to comic books,” Dynamite CEO/Publisher Nick Barrucci said in a statement. “Bob’s Burgers is one of our most rewarding programs, due largely to the direct involvement of the writers and artists working on the show. We know we have a repeatable recipe for success with the help of Bento Box and the series’ creators.”\n\nThe new series will launch digitally and in comic book stores in June."
