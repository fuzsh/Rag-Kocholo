Steve Williams

Steve is an overconfident, bumbling park ranger who takes himself and his job way too seriously. Even though Steve has been named Ranger of the Month at Brickleberry every month for several years, he’s not nearly as good at his job as he thinks he is. Steve’s Ranger of the Month title means everything to him and he will do anything to keep it. Steve’s father was also a Brickleberry ranger, so Steve was raised in the park, and despite his flaws, he does know the park like the back of his hand. Steve dreamed of working at Brickleberry since he was a child but put his dream on hold after his father went missing in the park and was never found.

Ethel Anderson

Ethel is a twenty-five-year-old smoking hot (in a granola-hippie-living-in-the-woods kind of way) ranger. She was the top ranger at Yellowstone National Park and was transferred to Brickleberry in an effort to get the park back on track. Ethel possesses extraordinary ranger skills learned while being raised by her adopted Native American parents, but she is quite humble about it. Other skills she learned from her parents include splitting eights and downing a fifth of vodka in five seconds without triggering her gag reflex.

Denzel Jackson

Denzel is an African-American ranger who is horrible at his job, but can’t be fired because he works for a government agency. Denzel has a strange fetish for elderly white women that gets him into hot water: he worked for the park service in New York City, but after some harassing phone calls to Barbara Bush, he was transferred to Brickleberry. Denzel finds his new job much more challenging than working in Central Park because he’s afraid of bugs, snakes, and pretty much anything else that inhabits the woods.

Connie Cunaman

Connie is a female ranger who is unusually strong, which comes in handy when she has to wrestle a bear or drag a downed redwood off the road. Connie was born to be a park ranger; she has never worn makeup in her life and loves living in the woods.

Malloy

Malloy is a grizzly bear cub that Woody has taken in as a pet and spoils to death. Woody lets Malloy play video games and eat junk food all day. Though he may be cute and cuddly, Malloy has a dirty mouth, a superiority complex and is a bit of a narcissist. He enjoys putting down the rangers on a daily basis, especially Steve. Every cartoon has to have a wisecracking animal, right?
