Brickleberry Theme Song

The welcome to Brickleberry theme song and score was created by a team that consisted of; Nicolas Barry, Rene Garza Aldape, Alejandro Valencia, Matthew Chastain, Benny Holst and Tomas Jacobi. It begin’s with flutes, soon followed by pianos, violins and I believe I can also here clarinet. This piece was performed by an orchestra in a slightly reverberant room. The extra noises on top of the orchestral piece, such as the ambience of birds and forest noises and also the noises of the animals mating, hides a lot of the reverberance very well. This gives the song a very open and clean feel. After the first bit of dialogue comes the main Brickleberry theme song. This is the same orchestra, however, the trumpets, trombones and also chimes come in at this part and take lead.
