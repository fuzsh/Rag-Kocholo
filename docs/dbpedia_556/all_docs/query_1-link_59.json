        "text": "The Biological Databases of South Australia (BDBSA) is South Australia's flora and fauna database that stores and manages specimen and observation records. This record is the flora component that contains 1,050,631 plant measurements collected from 224,572 sites, across 5565 plant species since 1976. This dataset includes vegetation structural attributes, observations on individual plants such as stem diameter, crown extent and crown density, as well as occurrence data. The resulting database provides a comprehensive record of plant diversity across sites ground-truthed during a diverse range of biodiversity projects undertaken in South Australia and provides a basis for future updating of mapping or other relevant work such as species modelling.\n\nOnly validated BDBSA data is made publicly available and all records of confidential taxa have been masked from the dataset. Data is accessible from the TERN Data Infrastructure, which provides the ability to extract subsets of vegetation data across multiple data collections and bioregions for more than 31 variables including stem diameter, tree crown extent, and number of individual plants."
