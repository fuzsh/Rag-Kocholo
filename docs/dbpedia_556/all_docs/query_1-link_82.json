        "text": "These crape-myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica) trees seem like something out of this world, standing out as strange among the other trees with their unusual bark and unmissble, even garish flowers. I have not uploaded any observations of the crape-myrtles themselves, because they are all cultivated; I have seen no evidence of their becoming naturalized, or even reproducing on their own, despite thriving here. Nevertheless, I have been observing them carefully, looking for anything wild to observe which I can notate as being associated with crape-myrtle.\n\nSo far, I have found nothing except for a very occasional powdery mildew. No herbivorous insects, no galls, no pollinators, no seed-predating birds, nothing.\n\nI’m not finding much online either. This blog article agrees about the powdery mildew, and suggests that the trees here are the pure species, not the hybrid; and this article only mentions two insect pests, the crape myrtle aphid and the glassy-winged sharpshooter. Glassy-winged sharpshooters are a quarantine pest in the California wine country, and the control measures seem to be working, because I have never seen one. I have not found any crape myrtle aphids, either.\n\nCrape-myrtle must be native somewhere in the world. The specific epithet suggests South Asia. It may be that the lack of associated animals I’m finding is just because they are so exotic here that their ecological connections have been severed; perhaps in their native habitat they have more wildlife value. Has anyone observed wild crape-myrtles, who can speak as to their ecological relationships?\n\nCrape myrtle are landscaping plants. Smaller than Lagerstromemia speciosa and the other related species. It is known to flower well in sunny environment. I’ve noticed tropical mistletoe (Dendrophthoe pentandra) growing on it. This means that the sunbirds or other small birds might be present to sow the seeds on the plants. Local articles say honey bees visit the flowers. Cultivated trees may be frequently maintained. When grown in dry areas of the world, the associated wildlife may be different or lesser. The typical gardeners don’t want a semi-parasitic plant growing on the tree. The tree is probably suited to dry regions where not many plants can grow. Some other trees might be more resilient in desert-like conditions. So it adds variety , has some commercial value in the horticulture trade. Don’t know if the wood is worth anything. Carbon capture. Can try grow orchids on the fork of branches. However, its smooth bark means more watering needed otherwise the orchids won’t grow well.\n\nArticles say finches feed on crape myrtle seeds. I’ve not observed that yet, probably there is no finch around here, except some munias species.\n\nThey’re definitely able to spread; I cut down a few dozen a year in my yard that I guess come out as runners from the established ones that a previous homeowner planted\n\npretty enough trees for landscaping but they damn well take over if you let them. I have seen very small ants of some sort on them (tried to get pictures, too small), as well as aphids, and wasp have built nest on the established ones in my yard. I see honey bees use them but not our native bees.\n\nI’ve seen them reproduce although they don’t seem to be very assertive about it. They come up in my yard regularly but not excessively. I moved a couple to my back yard but mostly I pull them from flower beds when young. Elsewhere in the yard, they get mowed over which does them in (unlike the volunteer oak trees, some of which survive the lawn mower the first few times). I’ve seen a few saplings in the greenbelts around Austin, TX, but they don’t seem to naturalize. I suspect they get shaded out in the moist places where the seeds might be deposited.\n\nThey’re considered invasive in many areas, but native birds in the US (and presumably elsewhere) do eat the seeds:\n\nhttps://www.si.edu/stories/crape-myrtle-trees-arent-native-us-birds-find-them-tasty\n\nIn Florida they’ve been documented as a pollen source for native and non-native bees:\n\nhttps://bioone.org/journals/florida-entomologist/volume-99/issue-1/024.099.0108/Use-of-Crape-Myrtle-Lagerstroemia-Myrtales--Lythraceae-Cultivars-as/10.1653/024.099.0108.full\n\nThere are many species all across South to East Asia (about 50 species), and in India one of the species is important for the Antheraea paphia moth, which is a local silk producing species.\n\nIn Vietnam they’re important habitat for a range of moths and butterflies, both as larvae and adults.\n\nSome species of Crape-Myrtle, such as Lagerstroemia minuticarpa, are endangered (Critically Endangered in this case)"
