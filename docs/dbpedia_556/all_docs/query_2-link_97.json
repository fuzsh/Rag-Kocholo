        "text": "Rosewoods are tricky- especially Madagascan Rosewood. I believe there are dozens of \"Madagascan Rosewoods.\"\n\nBois de Rose is one of many types of Rosewood that grows in Madagascar. From my reading, there are many species and subspecies of rosewood an Madagascar, including Bois de Rose, Palisander/Voamboana, Manipika and Santos Rosewood (not a true \"Dalbergia\" rosewood). There are so many, that often they are just generically named \"Madagascan Rosewood\" when sold.\n\nDont' just take my word for it, though. \"Dalbergia spp. of the family Fabaceae. There are numerous Dalbergia species that are given the common name of (among others) Madagascar rosewood. These include at least the following: D. baronii, D. greveana, D. madagascariensis, D. maritima, D. perrierim, and D. trichocarpa.\" ~From http://www.hobbithouseinc.com -\n\nGreat clarification Beau. What is shown is not Bois de Rose although as you are indicating is does come from Madigascar. The piece in this cue was at least 10 years old when I bought it. The stuff is usually dense like ebony or African Blackwood. It tones like glass and is fairly closed grained. In reality, I don't where it came from but it was labelled Madigascar Rosewood by a respectable exotic wood dealer.\n\nAnother great cue wood not often used is Grenadillo. I love lots of woods from the Mexican Yuccatan peninsula.\n\nMartin\n\nGreat clarification Beau. What is shown is not Bois de Rose although as you are indicating is does come from Madigascar.

It was no longer available from the vendor I bought it from after I went back for more. It is likely the species used in the cue you posted. The few pieces that I have are straight grained and have a nice long tap tone.\n\nBois de Rose is Dalbergia maritima."
