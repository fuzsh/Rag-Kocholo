        "text": "Puccinia psidii Wint. is a very unusual rust with an extremely wide host range within the Myrtaceae. The fungus currently occurs only in South and Central America, the Caribbean, and Florida, where it causes disease of both indigenous and introduced species. The hosts of most economic importance are Eucalyptus species, grown as plantations on a very large scale, especially in Brazil. The rust is a serious threat to tropical, sub-tropical, and possibly temperate plantations in Australia, and in other regions world-wide. In Australia, there is an additional threat to native vegetation as many communities are dominated by Myrtaceae. A collaborative project between Australia, Brazil, and South Africa aims to assist in the management of the disease by screening a wide range of myrtaceous genera for susceptibility to the disease, mapping areas in South America, Australia, and other areas globally in eucalypt-growing regions for potential disease hazard, and developing molecular tools for ...\n\nPuccinia psidii causes a rust disease on a broad range of hosts in the Myrtaceae and Heteropyxidaceae. It is native to South America where it can cause severe disease in eucalypt plantations and other introduced Myrtaceae. The pathogen has recently expanded its geographical range to Hawaii, increasing concerns about the potential for an incursion in Australia. This paper reviews the taxonomy, biology, impact and options for control of P. psidii. It also discusses the probable impact if an incursion were to occur in Australia and the preparations that must be made to mitigate adverse consequences.\n\nManaging unwanted pests and diseases is a growing concern. Recent shifts in state-led biosecurity policy have seen a movement towards ‘shared responsibility’ between government, industry and communities. We use social practice theory to show how materials, skills and meanings come together to shape how people understand the spread of myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii), an unwanted disease in Aotearoa New Zealand. We show how ‘shared responsibility’ has emerged in the shift from a government-led incursion response to myrtle rust, to passive disease reporting using iNaturalist. We offer a reflective aid to help biosecurity practitioners better consider participatory practices for plant health."
