        "text": "Discussion\n\nGenera 11, species ca. 500 (5 genera, 8 species in the flora).\n\nCombretaceae are clearly placed within Myrtales, a major angiosperm order whose monoÂ­phyly is well supported by anatomy, embryology, and morphology (L. A. S. Johnson and B. G. Briggs 1984), as well as by plastid and nuclear DNA sequences (M. W. Chase et al. 1993; E. Conti et al. 1996, 1997; V. Savolainen et al. 2000, 2000b; D. E. Soltis et al. 2000, 2001; K. W. Hilu et al. 2003; Wang H. et al. 2009; O. Maurin et al. 2010, 2017). Morphological characteristics of Combretaceae supporting this placement include vessel elements with vestured pits, stems with internal phloem, stipules absent or present as very small lateral structures, flowers each with a short to elongate hypanthium, stamens incurved in bud, and a single style (W. S. Judd et al. 2008).\n\nC. A. Stace (2007) recognized two subfamilies within Combretaceae: Strephonematoideae Engler & Diels (only Strephonema Hooker f. of western tropical Africa) and Combretoideae Burnett (all remaining genera); DNA-based phylogenetic analyses have supported this distinction (Tan F. X. et al. 2001, 2002; O. Maurin et al. 2010). Within the latter subfamily, two tribes are distinguished: Laguncularieae Engler & Diels (Dansiea Byrnes, Laguncularia, Lumnitzera, Macropteranthes F. Mueller) and Combreteae de Candolle [Combretum, Conocarpus, Finetia Gagnepain, Getonia Roxburgh, Guiera Adanson ex Jussieu, Terminalia]. Phylogenetic relationships within the family are imperfectly understood, and problems of generic circumscription exist (Stace).\n\nCombretaceae are distributed pantropically, with extensions into warm temperate regions; within the geographical coverage of this flora, the species here treated are usually considered to be restricted to Florida; however, Conocarpus erectus and Laguncularia racemosa likely have become established on South Padre Island (Willacy County), Texas (B. L. Turner et al. 2003; Texas Non-Native Plants Group, http://www.texasnonnatives.org). The family is ecologically significant in coastal regions of southern and central Florida due to the presence of the mangrove species Laguncularia racemosa and the mangrove-associate C. erectus. Both occur in extensive coastal stands [along with Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle]. Lumnitzera racemosa is also a mangrove species; it occurs in southern Florida only in a single naturalized population and shows potential to be an invasive species (J. W. Fourqurean et al. 2010). Combretum indicum, Terminalia catappa, T. muelleri, and, probably, T. buceras are also non-native; only the first two are considered invasive. Fruit dispersal in Conocarpus, Laguncularia, and Lumnitzera is by floating in water; the fruits of Terminalia are eaten by mammals and birds; they float and may be secondarily water-dispersed.\n\nCombretaceae are not of great economic importance, although Terminalia buceras, T. catappa, and T. molinetii are widely used as shade trees and/or ornamentals in southern Florida due to their distinctive growth architecture, and cultivars of Conocarpus erectus with densely pubescent leaves are widely used as ornamental shrubs or small trees because of their distinctive coloration and salt tolerance. Terminalia catappa has fruits with edible kernels. Combretum indicum is often grown as an ornamental vine because of its showy flowers, which open white and change to pink and then red as the day progresses."
