        "text": "Although leaves of Myrtaceae are easily identified to family level, very few studies have convincingly identified fossil Myrtaceae leaves to living genera. We used a broadly comparative approach with a large data set of extant taxa to confidently assign the mummified remains of myrtaceous leaves from early Miocene sediments at Kiandra (New South Wales, Australia) to a living genus. Fossils were identified using a nearest living relative approach, against a database of 232 extant broadleaf rainforest species of Myrtaceae. Leaf cuticles were prepared from 106 species, sourced from herbarium specimens as well as some living individuals, and a further 127 records were assembled from the literature. A set of simple but phylogenetically informative cuticular characters were observed, described, and recorded under both scanning electron microscopy and standard light microscopy. A new fossil species of Syzygium Gaertn. is described from mummified remains found in early Miocene (21.5-21.7 Ma...\n\nAustralia&#39;s Great Sandy Region is of international significance containing two World Heritage areas and patches of rainforest growing on white sand. Previous broad-scale analysis found the Great Sandy biogeographic subregion contained a significantly more phylogenetically even subset of species than expected by chance contrasting with rainforest on white sand in Peru. This study aimed to test the patterns of rainforest diversity and relatedness at a finer scale and to investigate why we may find different patterns of phylogenetic evenness compared with rainforests on white sands in other parts of the world. This study focussed on rainforest sites within the Great Sandy and surrounding areas in South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. We undertook field collections, expanded our three-marker DNA barcode library of SEQ rainforest plants and updated the phylogeny to 95% of the SEQ rainforest flora. We sampled species composition of rainforest in fixed area plots from 100 sites. We c..."
