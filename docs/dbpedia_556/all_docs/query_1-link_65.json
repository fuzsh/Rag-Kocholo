        "text": "ADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nIn this article we will discuss about:- 1. Characters of Myrtaceae 2. Distribution of Myrtaceae 3. Economic Importance 4. Affinities 5. Important Types.\n\nCharacters of Myrtaceae:\n\nLeaves aromatic, gland dotted, exstipulate, entire margin; flower hermaphrodite, actinomorphic, epigynous; calyx 4-5, gamosepalous, sometimes thrown off as a lid; corolla 4-5, free or united; stamens indefinite; carpels 2-5 syncarpous, ovary inferior, placentation axile; style and stigma simple; fruit a berry or drupe.\n\nA. Vegetative characters:\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nHabit:\n\nThe members of this family are mostly trees (Eucalyptus, Syzygium, Psidium) or shrub (Carreya) very rarely herbs. Some of the species of Eucalyptus may attain a height of 300 ft.\n\nRoot:\n\nTap root and branched.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nStem:\n\nErect woody, branched, bark very shining, smooth and goes off in old trees (Eucalyptus); vascular bundle bicollateral.\n\nLeaves:\n\nSimple, opposite, alternate (Eucalyptus), or whorled, shortly petiolate, exstipulate or with minute stipule, gland dotted, coriaceous, evergreen. Leaves of Eucalyptus show adaptation to dry climatic and intense sunlight conditions and may become needle like and take up vertical position.\n\nB. Floral characters:\n\nInflorescence:\n\nUsually of cyme type, sometimes panicle cyme or corymbose cyme, proliferous drooping spike in Callistemon; axillary in Psidium; solitary axillary (Myrtus communis); trichotomous cyme (Syzygium); paniculate cyme (Eucalyptus).\n\nFlower:\n\nPedicellate (Eucalyptus) or sessile (Callistemon), bracteate usually with two bracteoles (Callistemon), ebracteate (Eucalyptus) actinomorphic, hermaphrodite, epigynous sometimes perigynous; complete.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nCalyx:\n\nSepals 4-5, polysepalous or united, rarely reduced or thrown off like a lid as the flower opens (Eucalyptus) or entirely absent in some of Eucalyptus spp; quincuncial aestivation.\n\nCorolla:\n\nPetals 4-5 more or less circular in form, polypetalous sometimes gamopetalous and forming cap (Eucalyptus), quincuncial aestivation.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nAndroecium:\n\nStamens indefinite, arranged in several whorls at the edge of the receptacle, polyandrous rarely mondadelphous (Callistemon); 5 and antipetalous in Melaleuca. In Melaleuca leucadendron the stamens are numerous but in five bundles opposite to petals, anthers dorsifixed or versatile, dithecous, small, introrse, connectives of anthers are usually gland dotted. In the bud condition the stamens are bent.\n\nGynoecium:\n\nCarpels 2 to indefinite, syncarpous; perigynous to fully epigynous; inferior, two to many locular, axile placentation rarely parietal (Rhodamnia), 2 to indefinite anatropous or campylotropous ovules per loculus; style simple, long, stigma capitate.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nFruit:\n\nA berry (Psidium), capsule (Eucalyptus, Callistemon)-, drupe (Eugenia).\n\nSeed:\n\nNon-endospermic.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nPollination:\n\nEntomophilous. Insects are attracted by coloured stamens and floral parts.\n\nFloral formula:\n\nDistribution of Myrtaceae:\n\nThe family contains 100 genera and 300 species out of which India contributes 116 species. The chief centres of distribution are Australia and America.\n\nEconomic Importance of Myrtaceae:\n\n1. Fruits:\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nSome members of the family produce edible fruits e.g. Syzygium cumini (syn. Eugenia jambolana) (H. Jamun), Psidium guajava (Amrood) with edible fruits.\n\n2. Oil:\n\nThe essential oils are obtained by the steam distillation of leaves and branches of Eucalyptus species.\n\n3. Spice:\n\nSyzygium caryophyllata (syn. Eugenia caryophyllata) yields the cloves of commerce. Clove oil (H. Laung ka tel) is extracted out of them.\n\n4. Medicine:\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\nEucalyptus oil is used in influenza. It is mixed with clove oil and used in rheumatism. The roots of Eucalyptus are purgative. Clove oil is antipyretic and largely used in gum troubles. The leaves of S. cumini are used in indigenous medicine for dysentery.\n\nThe fruits of Myrtus communis are carminative and given in dysentery, diarrhoea, and rheumatism.\n\n5. Wood:\n\nThe wood of Eucalyptus and Psidium is used in engraving and making handles. In Australia the wood of Eucalyptus is used for railway sleepers, bridges and plywood industries.\n\n6. Ornamental:\n\nMany plants viz., Callistemon, Myrtus, Melaleuca leucadendron, Tristania, Eucalyptus are cultivated for their showy nature in the gardens.\n\nAffinities of Myrtaceae:\n\nEngler and Prantl placed the Myrtaceae in the order Myrtiflorae along with other 17 families. Wettstein, Bessey, and Hutchinson adopted the name Myrtales. Bentham and Hooker placed the family Myrtaceae along with Lythraceae, Combretaceae and Onagraceae.\n\nBessey supported the view that the order Myrtales is allied to Rosales in many respects and probably derived from it. The order Myrtales is also allied to Umbellales in epigyny, the number of carpels and in pendulous ovules. Hence the systematic position of Myrtales is just before the Umbellales.\n\nPrimitive characters:\n\n1. Plants trees, shrubs and climbers.\n\n2. Leaves simple and alternate.\n\n3. Flowers hermaphrodite and actinomorphic.\n\n4. Petals free.\n\n5. Stamens numerous and free.\n\nAdvanced characters:\n\n1. Flowers epigynous.\n\n2. Calyx gamosepalous.\n\n3. Gynoecium syncarpous and reduction in the number of carpels to two (Eugenia, Eucalyptus).\n\n4. Ovules campylotropous.\n\n5. Fruit simple.\n\n6. Seeds non-endospermic.\n\nCommon plants of the family:\n\n1. Callistemon (Bottle brush tree):\n\nFilaments of the anthers are scarlet in colour and form brush like structure.\n\n2. Eucalyptus:\n\nBeautiful tall tree.\n\n3. Eugenia caryophyllata:\n\nThe dried flower buds form the spice – the cloves (H. Laung).\n\n4. Psidium guajava:\n\nSmall tree yielding the fruit guava (H. Amrood).\n\n5. Myrtus:\n\nAromatic shrub with shinning leaves.\n\n6. Carreya:\n\nLarge deciduous tree of shady places.\n\nDivision of the family and chief genera:\n\nThe family Myrtaceae has been divided into sub-families on the basis of fruit character.\n\n1. Myrtoideae:\n\nFruit berry rarely drupe; leaves always opposite.\n\nTribe (i) Myrteae:\n\nOvary 2-5 locular. Psidium, Myrtus, Eugenia, Myrcia.\n\n2. Leptospermoideae:\n\nFruit dry, leaves opposite or alternate.\n\nTribe (i) Leptospermeae:\n\nGynoecium multilocular, fruit loculicidal capsule. Eucalyptus, Callstemon, Tristania.\n\nTribe (ii) Chamaelaucieae:\n\nGynoecium monolocular, fruit one seeded usually dry. Calycothrix, Darwinia, Verticordia.\n\nImportant Types of Myrtaceae:\n\n1.
