Our journal editors work within the guidelines of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Further information on our policies can be found at http://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/PublishingPolicies.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nPeer review\n\nAustralian Systematic Botany is a peer-reviewed journal that uses a single-blind peer-review. The Editor-in-Chief is responsible to maintain high-quality peer-review of papers submitted to the journal and works together with Associate Editors to ensure a thorough and fair peer-review and the highest scientific publishing standards. All submissions undergo preliminary assessment by the Editor-in-Chief, who may reject a paper before peer review when it is outside the journal’s scope or is of insufficient quality. Associate Editors select reviewers and after at least two review reports are received, they make the decision whether to accept/reject or send a manuscript for revision. The final decision is made by the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nUnder our single-blind policy, reviewers’ names are not disclosed to the authors. To increase transparency, reviewers may choose to sign their reports. We ask reviewers and authors not to directly contact each other while the manuscript is under consideration, rather keep all communication through ScholarOne with the Editor’s involvement.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nAuthorship\n\nThe conditions around authorship for Australian Systematic Botany should follow the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), for more information see http://www.publish.csiro.au/sb/PublishingPolicies.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nLicence to publish\n\nFor details regarding copyright, please see Copyright/Licence to Publish.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nOpen access\n\nAuthors may choose to publish their paper Open Access on payment of a publication fee. See Open Access for more details.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nJournal policy and notes\n\nPapers will be considered for publication in the Journal if they make an original contribution to any branch of systematic botany. Descriptive taxonomic papers should normally constitute a comprehensive treatment of a group. Short papers on individual species and nomenclatural papers must contain significant new information of broader interest to be considered. Papers dealing with groups of unrelated species or miscellaneous collections of species are not considered. Numbered series of papers are discouraged. Review articles will also be considered. Authors interested in publishing a review article are invited to contact the Editor-in-Chief or an appropriate member of the Editorial Board. All papers are refereed. There are no page charges.\n\nSubmission of a paper implies that the results have not been published and are not being considered for publication elsewhere. It also implies that all coauthors of the paper have consented to its submission. Authors of multi-authored papers may wish to assign relative values to their contributions, or to indicate that two or more authors contributed equally to a paper. This can be done in a note at the end of the address field on the paper. The Journal will use its best endeavours to ensure that work published is that of the named authors except where acknowledged and, through its reviewing procedures, that any published results and conclusions are consistent with the primary data. It takes no responsibility for fraud or inaccuracy on the part of the contributors.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nDistribution information and lodging specimens\n\nIn cooperation with other botanical institutions, distributional data for rare and threatened plant taxa will be masked. Precise distributional data are not published for species that are listed as known only from the type locality, or whose conservation status is given as E or V in the relevant State/Territory and Commonwealth legislation. Where specimen citations for rare taxa have been deliberately abbreviated to achieve less precision in order to protect the taxa, this should be stated. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation) of Exports and Imports Act of 1982 (amended in 1986) states that all type material and unicates collected in Australia must be lodged in an appropriate national or state institution. Consequently, Journal policy requires that type material of all of the taxa collected in Australia after 1982, and discussed by the author of a manuscript, be lodged in a suitable Australian herbarium.\n\nFor all papers, whether presenting morphological, cytological or molecular data, voucher specimens must be cited, along with the herbarium where lodged. For population studies where large series of specimens of one taxon are examined, citation of exemplar specimens is acceptable. In tables that list material examined, the voucher specimen (collection) and the herbarium where lodged are to be listed for each entry. If there are one or few herbaria involved, this can be indicated instead of in the materials and methods, or in the table caption.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nData archiving policy\n\nAustralian Systematic Botany requires, as a condition for publication, that data supporting the results in the paper are archived in an appropriate public archive. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences must be deposited in GenBank (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) or partnered database. Other types of data (e.g. sequence alignments and other phylogenetic matrices) should be submitted to a public archive, or provided as supplementary material for publication online. Data are important products of the scientific enterprise, and they should be preserved and usable for decades in the future. Authors may elect to have the data publicly available at the time of publication, or, if the technology of the archive allows, may opt to embargo access to the data for a period up to 1 year after publication. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor, especially for sensitive information such as the location of endangered species. It is recommended that authors finalise data archiving prior to submission of their manuscript, and make accession numbers and confidential reviewer links available during the peer-review process. Authors should take care to provide accurate and informative annotations and metadata. Once the manuscript is accepted for publication and bibliographic details are available, these details should be added to archived data records in order to enable correct citation of the data’s source.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nOnline publication\n\nPapers are published 'early access' online in the final paginated form ahead of assignment to an issue when possible.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nPaper categories\n\nResearch Papers are complete reports of original research not previously published, except possibly in the form of a preliminary communication. There are no word/page limitations for research papers.\n\nReview articles are encouraged, and should critically summarise relevant work in a specific field and indicate fruitful lines of further research. Reviews should be submitted in the same way as research papers and are subject to peer-review. It is advisable to discuss the review with the Editor-in-Chief or a member of the Editorial Board before submission.\n\nViewpoint papers present a novel view on a topical issue of current international concern. Authors are welcome to take a controversial standpoint but, overall, articles should provide a clear and balanced discussion to inform non-specialist readers about an issue and its new developments. Viewpoints should not be used as a refuge from the trouble of precise thought. The length is usually 1000–1500 words.\n\nNotes and Resources are submissions on new research methods, infrastructure and equipment, data resources, software, short survey results, etc. Submissions for this section should be concise and may not be subject to full peer review (at the Editor-in-Chief’s discretion). Submissions that describe a dataset or group of datasets need not include analyses of the dataset(s) but should explain why the data was collected, and for what it might be used. As with all papers published by Australian Systematic Botany, citations and references to published sources must be included as appropriate.\n\nComments on papers published in the journal within the past 12 months will be considered by the Editors. If the Comment is negative or critical, the authors of the published paper will be offered the right to reply in a Response. Both the Comment and Response will be peer reviewed, and if accepted, will be published in the same issue. In order to be considered for publication, Comment and Response articles must be concise and impersonal, must contribute to knowledge and must advance the discussion beyond opinion. Comments should have a short abstract (<75 words) and should not exceed 2000 words. Responses should have no abstract and should not exceed 1000 words. They should comprise no more than one typeset page in total (including figures, tables and references). If the corresponding or contributing authors of the previously published paper decline their right to reply or fail to do so in a reasonable timeframe, the Comment will be published without a Response.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nL.A.S. Johnson Review Series\n\nAustralian Systematic Botany publishes critical state-of-the-art evaluations that advance knowledge in current key areas of research in systematic botany. The series - The L. A. S. Johnson Reviews - is commissioned by invitation, and is numbered in sequence. We appreciate suggestions on prospective reviews for this important series. Please note that these papers are subject to peer-review and the editors reserve the right not to publish any material.\n\nL. A. S. (Lawrie) Johnson (1926–1997) was an Australian systematic botanist notable for his studies of the eucalypts (Eucalyptus, Angophora and Corymbia), cycads, Juncaceae, Oleaceae, Restionaceae and phylogenetic studies of Myrtaceae, Myrtales and Proteaceae. His career was at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, as Botanist (1948–1972), Director (1972–1985) and Honorary Research Associate (1986–1997). During his directorship the Royal Botanic Gardens saw major developments and broadening of its scientific programs. Alone or with colleagues, he distinguished and described many genera and species, as well as reclassifying numerous further taxa. He contributed to the theory of systematics during the early development of phylogenetics and to understanding of the evolution of southern hemisphere floras. The hypotheses of relationships developed through Johnson's phylogenetic studies have served as starting points for much further investigation by others, especially through molecular systematics. He was noted for the breadth of his scientific interests and expertise and his forthright expression of scientific conclusions.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nSupplementary material\n\nSupplementary material of a detailed nature that may be useful to other workers, but which is not essential to the printed paper, may be lodged with the Editor-in-Chief, provided that it is submitted with the manuscript for inspection by the referees. Such material will be made available online.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nGeneral presentation\n\nThe work should be presented concisely and clearly in English. Introductory material, including a review of the literature, should not exceed what is necessary to indicate the reason for the work and the essential background. Authors are advised to note the typographical conventions and the layout of headings, tables, and illustrations exemplified in recent issues of the Journal. Observance of these and the following requirements will shorten the interval between submission and publication.\n\nCorresponding authors will be sent a free PDF of their paper upon publication. The conditions under which the paper is distributed is as follows:\n\nAuthors may\n\nPrint out the PDF\n\nStore the PDF on their personal hard disk\n\nSend copies to individual colleagues for non-commercial purposes\n\nInclude the PDF in a course pack, subject to the usual copyright licencing agency fees\n\nPost the PDF on their personal website.\n\nAuthors may not\n\nAggregate the PDF with other papers on related topics (other than the author´s own papers).\n\nReturn to Index\n\nUse of inclusive language\n\nThese guidelines should be used to assist in identifying appropriate language, but are by no means exhaustive or definitive. Inclusive language comprises carefully chosen words and phrases that are respectful and promote the acceptance and value of all people. It is language which is free from words, phrases or tones that demean, insult, exclude, stereotype, or trivialise people on the basis of their membership of a certain group or because of a particular attribute. As such, inclusive language should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader, and contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on any grounds including but not limited to: age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition. We encourage the use of plural nouns (e.g., 'they' as default wherever possible instead of 'he/she'), and recommend avoiding the use of descriptors that refer to personal attributes, unless there is scientific or clinical relevance. For further guidance on inclusive language see Inclusive language | Style Manual. If there are questions about language use and/or publishing with regards to First Nations people, please contact the Journal.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nSubmission and preparation of manuscripts\n\nTo submit your paper, please use our online journal management system ScholarOne Manuscripts, which can be reached directly through this link or from the link on the journal´s homepage. If a first-time user, register via the ´Register here´ link, or use your existing username and password to log in. Then click on the ´Author Centre´ link and proceed.\n\nA covering letter must accompany the submission and should include the name, address, fax and telephone numbers, and email address of the corresponding author. The letter should also contain a statement justifying why the work should be considered for publication in the journal, and that the manuscript has not been published or simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.\n\nIf you encounter any difficulties, or you have any queries, please contact:\n\nAustralian Systematic Botany\n\nCSIRO Publishing\n\nLocked Bag 10\n\nClayton South, Vic. 3169\n\nAustralia\n\nTelephone +[61 3] 9545 8400\n\nEmail publishing.asb@csiro.au\n\nAuthors are advised to read recent issues of the journal to note details of the scope of papers, headings, tables, illustrations, style, and general form. Observance of these and the following details will shorten the time between submission and publication. Poorly prepared and unnecessarily lengthy manuscripts have less chance of being accepted.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nLarge papers\n\nAuthors of large papers are requested to contact the Editor-in-Chief prior to submission to negotiate arrangements to accommodate them.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nTitle\n\nThis should be concise and informative and should contain all keywords necessary to facilitate retrieval by modern searching techniques. Titles including generic or specific names should also contain the name of taxa at higher rank, e.g. Division, Class, Order or Family. Nomenclatural authorities should be omitted from the title. An abridged title that does not exceed 50 characters should also be supplied for use as a running head.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nSummary text for the Table of Contents\n\nAuthors are asked to provide a short summary that captures the essence of the work and puts it clearly into context. These summaries will appear in the journal´s online Table of Contents, email alert and RSS feed to promote the paper and is an opportunity to enlarge the audience for your article. Please provide a three-sentence paragraph of 50 to 80 words written for interested non-experts, such as journalists, government workers, and other social media contributors etc. The text should be free from scientific jargon, and written at the level of an article in a science magazine. Your first sentence should engage the reader, convincing them that this is an important area. The second sentence should introduce the problem addressed in the paper, and state your main discovery. The final sentence should describe how the results fit into the bigger picture (i.e. implications or impact of the discovery).\n\nTo accompany the text, authors are strongly encouraged to provide an appropriate image that highlights an important aspect of the work. If a photo credit is required, please provide this. The image should be submitted as a 96 dpi JPEG file and must be no wider than 9 cm and no higher than 4 cm.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nAbstract\n\nThis should state concisely, preferably in fewer than 200 words, the scope of the work and the principal findings, and should be suitable for use by abstracting services. Species names mentioned in the abstract should include nomenclatural authorities. Acronyms and references should be avoided.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nKeywords\n\nA minimum of 8 key words or phrases are required to improve online discoverability of your work. These terms can be repeated from the title if necessary. List the keywords under the abstract, with terms separated by commas.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nText\n\nThis should normally be divided into sections, e.g. Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Taxonomy, Acknowledgements, References. These sections should use Times New Roman font, with 12 point size, except as otherwise specified, and should be typed with 1.5 or 2.0 line spacing. All main headings should be bold type, with the first letter capitalised, aligned at the left. Minor headings should be unbolded italics. Manuscripts should include line numbers to assist in the editing process. The following also should be adhered to: spell out numbers lower than 10 unless accompanied by a unit, e.g. 2 mm, 15 mm, two plants, 15 plants, but 5 out of 15 plants; leave a space between a numeral and its unit; use the ´ise´ construction, not ´ize´; indicate approximate positions of figures and tables in the text.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nNomenclature and Taxonomy\n\nNomenclature and taxonomic citations must follow the rules and recommendations of the most recent edition of the International code of nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN; currently Turland et al. 2018; available online at http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php).\n\nAbbreviations for taxonomic ranks should follow ICN Rec. 5A.1. Abbreviations indicating taxonomic circumscription should be formatted as follows: aff., cf., p.p. max., p.p. min., sens. lat., sens. strict.\n\nBook titles must be abbreviated following Taxonomic literature II (TL2; Stafleu and Cowan 1976–1986; available online in a searchable format at http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/tl-2/ and also via the Biodiversity Heritage Library at http://biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/48631, and journal citations in the synonymy must follow abbreviations in Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum (online at http://fmhibd.library.cmu.edu/HIBD-DB/bpho/home.php?-link=Home).\n\nTaxon authorities must follow the standard forms in the International Plant Names Index (IPNI; online at http://www.ipni.org) and/or Index Fungorum (IF; online at http://www.indexfungorum.org) author databases but should have minimal spacing (e.g. K.R.Thiele, not 'K. R. Thiele' or 'K.R. Thiele'). The first time that a taxon name of the rank of genus or below is given the authority should be cited in its standard form, with subsequent mentions using the taxon name only. For suprageneric ranks, authors should only be cited if the text is related to a taxonomic concept, there is ambiguity in the taxonomic concept being applied, or if there is an issue of authorship. For example, 'The Orchidaceae are the largest plant family on Earth.' vs 'Traditionally, this group of orchids has been classified as subtribe Drakaeinae Schltr.'\n\nDesignations of herbaria should follow Index Herbariorum (online at http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/).\n\nIf a publication, authority, or herbarium code is not listed in the above sources the details should be provided in full in the text (e.g. give author surname in full, preceded by all initials, each followed by a full stop, e.g. 'A.H.L.Jones'). These may be abbreviated during the editorial process.\n\nTaxonomy Section\n\nIn the Taxonomy section, provide information in the following order as known or required:\n\nAccepted name and typification; synonymy; description; illustration citations; specimens examined, distribution; habitat and ecology; phenology; conservation status; etymology; notes.\n\nAccepted names\n\nInclude the authority in its standard form and a protologue citation after the name (see Examples).\n\nNew names\n\nNew scientific names should be in bold italics, followed by the author citation in normal type, then an indication of the nomenclatural action in bold italics, e.g. Lecidella flavovirens Kantvilas and Elix, sp. nov.; Acacia amputata Maslin, nom. et stat. nov.\n\nFollowing the acceptance of a paper with new scientific names for fungi, authors must provide a MycoBank registration number for each name.\n\nAny newly-published phrase names should follow the standard format specified in Barker (2005).\n\nDescriptions and diagnoses\n\nUnder ICN Art. 39.2 (Shenzhen Code, 2018), a description or diagnosis must be provided in English or in Latin in order to validly publish a new scientific name. For Australian Systematic Botany, full descriptions in English are required; authors are discouraged from including Latin descriptions or diagnoses. Authors are encouraged to follow Recommendation 39A of the Code by additionally providing an English diagnosis in the Notes, including a thorough comparison of the taxon against similar and/or related taxa.\n\nSynonymy and typification\n\nSynonymies should be indicated by use of 11 point font size and paragraphs should be indented from the left hand margin by 2 cm. Synonyms must be listed in chronological order, with nomenclatural synonyms of the accepted name (i.e. those based on the same type) first and taxonomic synonyms of the accepted name (i.e. those based on different types) in succeeding paragraphs. Works cited merely to list the place of publication of a name do not need to be listed in the references unless they have also been cited elsewhere in the paper.\n\nNomenclatural synonyms\n\nNomenclatural synonyms of the accepted name (if any) should be listed in the first paragraph, followed by details of the type (see Examples 2 and 4).\n\nTaxonomic synonyms\n\nThe citation details for taxonomic synonyms of the accepted name, given in the second and subsequent paragraphs of the synonymy, should follow the same conventions used for the first paragraph (see Examples 1 and 2).\n\nType citations\n\nThe verbatim type citation may be included if it differs from the label information on the type specimen/s (see Examples 3 and 4). Enclose the verbatim citation in single quotation marks.\n\nType specimens and status\n\nDetails of the type specimen(s) should always be cited where these exist, with an indication of their type status. This may include an initial 'Type citation' sentence from the protologue (if applicable; see Examples 2, 4–7), but must include a separate 'Type' sentence with full citation of details from the relevant specimen(s). Authors should avoid combining type information from the protologue or subsequent publications with label details from type specimens.\n\nFor any existing lectotypes, reference should be given to the publication in which they were designated. Author/s should also indicate which of the type specimens they have seen (noted by an !). The location and accession numbers of type specimens (where available) must be included. If a type specimen is no longer extant, this should be indicated by explanatory text (e.g. ‘destroyed’ or ‘missing’), rather than symbols.\n\nThe type section of the synonymy should give only the necessary details. More details of typification should be treated in a separate Notes subsection.\n\nMisapplied names\n\nList misapplied names chronologically in paragraphs following the last taxonomic synonym paragraph (see Examples 1, 2 and 4).\n\nOrthographic variants\n\nOrthographic variants that have been widely used in the literature should be included, in the format shown in Example 3.\n\nExamples of formatting\n\nExample 1\n\nSeringia cacaobrunnea C.F.Wilkins, sp. nov.\n\nType: Western Australia: Norseman to Esperance Road [exact locality withheld for conservation reasons], 22 Sep. 2010, C.F.Wilkins & J.A.Wege CW2399 (holo: PERTH 08345686!; iso: CANB!, K!, MEL!).\n\nKeraudrenia cacaobrunnea C.F.Wilkins ms, FloraBase\n\n(http://www.florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au, accessed 28 May 2015).\n\nKeraudrenia velutina subsp. cacaobrunnea C.F.Wilkins ms, FloraBase\n\n(http://www.florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au, accessed 28 May 2015).\n\n[Keraudrenia integrifolia auct. non Steud.: B.J.Grieve, How to Know W.

Type citation: 'N.S.W., V., in rich soil, frequently on limestone ridges surrounded by high hills.' Type: n.v.\n\nTaxon descriptions\n\nTaxon descriptions should immediately follow the synonymy block. The main morphological characters should be italicised in the taxon description:\n\nPerianth segments 10–17 mm long, 4–10 mm wide, concave, apex acute to obtuse, often shortly apiculate; dorsal sepal ovate; lateral sepals lanceolate to ovate, slightly asymmetric; petals ovate; labellum elliptic to oblanceolate, usually slightly smaller than other segments.\n\nSpecimens examined\n\nSpecimens examined should be listed under a separate minor heading at the end of the taxon description using 11 point font size. No more than 20 specimens per taxon should be cited. The following sequence for listing the details of specimens should be followed: location; date of collection; collector's name and number; list of herbaria where lodged.\n\nMaterial from different countries is arranged alphabetically by country. Different states and/or counties are separated by a full stop. Within Australia, specimens should be listed by State/Territory in the following order: Western Australia, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island, Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, Coral Sea Islands, New South Wales, Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania, Heard Island, McDonald Island and Macquarie Island. Citations for specimens collected within the same Australian State/Territory should be separated by a semicolon, listed alphabetically by the surname of the first member of the collecting team. For other countries, citations for specimens collected within the same geographical division should be separated by a semicolon.\n\nThe inclusion of collecting dates is optional. If provided, collecting dates should be given in the order 'day month year'. Months should be given as a three-letter English abbreviation, with the exception of May, June and July being used in full. Roman numerals to indicate months are also acceptable. Examples: 10 Mar. 2013, 27 June 1994, Sep. 1960 [if no day is listed on the specimen], 10.iii.2013, 27.vi.1994, ix.1960 [if no day is listed on the specimen].\n\nCollectors' names and collecting numbers should be in italics. Use leg. ign. where the collector/s are unknown and s.n. to indicate where no collecting number was used.\n\nStandard herbarium codes (from Index Herbariorum; online at http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/) should be listed in parentheses after the specimen citation, in alphabetical order. Where accession numbers are cited, these should be listed following the code for the herbarium in which the specimens are held, in ascending numerical order.\n\nFor example:\n\nSpecimens examined: QUEENSLAND. Mundubbera, 1.5 km W of 'Mimosa'\n\nHomestead, D.I.Turner 2243 & R.T.Gott (BRI, MEL). VICTORIA. Victoria Gap, N of Gap Track,\n\nA.C.Beauglehole 17343 & M.Corrick (MEL); corner of Serra and Syphon tracks, P.Matthews\n\ns.n. (MEL 524561).\n\nConservation status\n\nConservation status should be listed under a separate minor heading using 11 point font size. In order to help protect vulnerable populations, precise distribution data of rare or threatened taxa should not be given in the designation of types, nor listed under Specimens examined.\n\nEtymology\n\nEtymology should be listed under a separate minor heading using 11 point font size. Authors are strongly encouraged to include etymology statements for new and replacement names to assist with the interpretation of orthography.\n\nNotes\n\nNotes should be listed under a separate minor heading using 11 point font size. These may include detailed information on nomenclatural decisions and interpretation (e.g. reasons for choice of a lectotype or neotype, matters of orthography and priority etc.). For newly described or recircumscribed taxa information on their affinities with related taxa should be outlined. Authors are also encouraged to include affinity information for existing taxa when publishing revisions of a taxonomic group.\n\nOther relevant information not included under any of the other minor headings of the Taxonomy section can also be included in the Notes.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nCSIRO Publishing encourages authors to share the research data underlying their papers to support transparency and reproducibility of research. A Data Availability Statement must be included at the end of the manuscript indicating whether the data used to generate the results in the paper are available and, if so, where to access them. For more information on CSIRO Publishing’s data sharing policy and for examples of what to include in the data availability statement please see https://www.publish.csiro.au/journals/publishingpolicies#6.\n\nAuthors can get credit for their work by citing their research data in the reference list of their article. Citations should include at a minimum: all authors, year of publication, title of dataset, record ID, publisher. DOI or URL if available.

It should identify any financial or non-financial (political, personal, professional) interests/relationships that may be interpreted to have influenced the manuscript. If there is no conflict of interest, please include the statement \"The authors declare no conflicts of interest\".\n\nReturn to Index\n\nDeclaration of Funding\n\nUnder a subheading 'Declaration of Funding' at the end of the text authors are required to declare all sources of funding for the research and/or preparation of the article, and the inclusion of grant numbers is recommended. Authors should declare sponsor names along with explanations of the role of those sources if any in the preparation of the data or manuscript or the decision to submit for publication; or a statement declaring that the supporting source had no such involvement. If no funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence: \"This research did not receive any specific funding\".\n\nReturn to Index\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe contribution of colleagues who do not meet all criteria for authorship should be acknowledged. Anyone included in the Acknowledgements section should have granted permission to be listed. Sources of financial support should be acknowledged in a separate ‘Declaration of Funding’ rather than here.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nReferences\n\nIn the text, where multiple references are cited these should be listed in chronological order separated by semi-colons. Where two or more of these references were published in the same year these should be ordered by the first author’s surname. Multiple references published in the same year by the same author/s should be distinguished by addition of a lower-case letter (e.g. Murphy (2007a); Murphy (2007b) and so on) in the order that they appear in the text. In the text the surnames of two co-authors are linked by ‘and’; for three or more co-authors, only the first author’s surname is listed followed by ‘et al.’. Do not use a comma between the author’s surname and the date. References occurring only in synonymy should not be given in the reference list. Make sure that all other references cited in the text are listed at the end of the paper and vice versa. At the end of the paper, list references in alphabetical order by the first author’s surname and within that by ascending date. Give titles of books and names of journals in full. Papers that have not been accepted for publication may not be included in the list of references and must be cited in the text either as ‘unpublished data’ or as ‘pers. comm.’; although the use of such citations is discouraged.\n\nExamples:\n\nJournal article\n\nWoelkerling WJ, Irvine LM, Harvey AS (1993) Growth-forms in non-geniculate coralline red algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta).

Non-SI units such as day and year are acceptable. Measurements of radiation should be given as irradiance or photon flux density, or both, and the waveband of the radiation should be specified. Luminous flux density units (e.g. lux) should not be used. Do not use the double solidus in complex groupings of units, e.g. mmol/m2/s; use the negative index system instead, i.e. mmol m-2 s-1.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nMathematical formulae\n\nCorrectly align and adequately space all symbols. Avoid two-line mathematical expressions wherever possible, especially in the running text. Display each long formula on a separate line with at least two lines of space above and below it.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nEnzyme nomenclature\n\nNames should conform to Recommendations (1992) of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on the Nomenclature and Classification of Enzymes as published in ´Enzyme Nomenclature 1992´ (Academic Press: San Diego). If you wish to use a name other than the recommended name, at the first mention of the alternative name identify it by giving the recommended name and its EC number.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nChemical nomenclature\n\nThe recommendations of the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature should be followed when naming compounds such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, steroids, vitamins, etc. Refer to other biologically active compounds, such as metabolic inhibitors, plant growth regulators, buffers (in accordance with IUPAC Rules of Chemical Nomenclature), once and then by their most widely accepted common name.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nTables\n\nThe heading should be in bold upper and lower case and should be in a separate paragraph from the headnote. Include in the headnote, any information relevant to the table as a whole, and where applicable, the levels of probability attached to statistics in the body of the table. Use *, **, *** only to define probability levels. Use footnotes only to refer to specific items in the body of the table; use A and B etc. for footnotes. Insert horizontal rules above and below the column headings and across the bottom of the table; do not use vertical rules. If using Microsoft Word, use table formatting to prepare tables (i.e. use table cells, not tabs), otherwise use tabs, not spaces to align columns. The first letter only of headings of rows and columns should be capitalised. Include the symbols for the units of measurement in parentheses below the column heading. Each table must be referred to in the text. Author citations for taxon names should be omitted from tables, unless there is ambiguity in the taxonomic concept being applied.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nIllustrations\n\nLine diagrams and photographs must be prepared using either a draw or chart/graph program such as MacDraw, Illustrator, CorelDraw, Excel, Sigmaplot, Harvard Graphics or Cricket Graph and files should be saved in one of the following formats: encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Illustrator or Excel (provided the Excel files have been saved with the chart encapsulated in it). The submission of scanned images or illustrations prepared in a paint program, e.g. Photoshop (and PICT and JPEG files) is discouraged, because of the difficulty in making editorial corrections to these files. If illustrations are created in a paint program, save the file as a TIFF or EPS (these files should be 600 dpi for line drawings and 300 dpi for halftone figures).\n\nRefer to each figure in the text, and number each according to the order in which it appears in the text. All lettering must be of a standard suitable for reduction (if necessary) and reproduction. Use a sans-serif typeface (e.g. Helvetica, Univers, Futura) that contrasts with its background, and which will be 1.5-2 mm high when printed. Use hatching not shading in bar graphs.\n\nAuthor citations for taxon names should be omitted from figure captions, unless there is ambiguity in the taxonomic concept being applied.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nPhotographs\n\nThese must be of the highest quality possible. Arrange photographs so that they abut each other without gaps, but allow 2-3 mm for the printer to insert a ´gutter´. Figures should be sized to fit either on 1 column (8.5 cm width) or over 2 columns (17.5 cm width). Length of figures should not exceed 22 cm. Include a scale bar on all micrographs. Important features mentioned in the text should be indicated. Lettering should be in sans-serif type that contrasts with its background. Colour photographs will be accepted, but the cost of production must be borne by the author.\n\nReturn to Index\n\nLine drawings\n\nThe following symbols should not be used: +, x or *. Explain the symbols used in the caption of the figure or in a legend. State on the axes of a graph what is being measured and give the appropriate units in parentheses.\n\nDense stippling does not reproduce well, and should be avoided. Lettering should be in sans-serif type (Helvetica is ideal) with only the first letter of the first word and any proper names capitalised, and should not be in bold type. Grid marks should point inwards."
