        "meta_description": "Eucalyptus crebra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironbark or narrowleaf red ironbark, is a type of Ironbark tree native to eastern Australia. A member of the large genus Eucalyptus, this tree is in the Myrtaceae family and can grow to a large spreading tree up to 35 m (115 ft) high. It is an important source of nectar in the honey industry and its hard, strong timber is used in construction. (Source: Wikipedia, '', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_crebra, CC BY-SA 3.0 .
