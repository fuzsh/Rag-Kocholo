        "text": "I have some questions on materials suitable for Luthiery. I was planning on making a bridge for a home built mandolin and I have plenty of mahogany and was wondering if it would work and how it might sound. I can get ebony, but the local specialty lumber shop has very little and it is quite expensive (same with ebony veneer).\n\nAlso, I have quite a supply of white (silver) maple (Acer Saccharinium) in my shop and was wondering if it is a good wood fit the ribs and back or if I should spend some money to go buy a different variety of maple.\n\n-Tristan\n\nIf you want to do your own bridge you might check into pen making blanks. I was in the local Wood Crafters store and they had some very nice ebony that seems very reasonable to me (and I'm cheap!). They have 80 stores in the USA and I'm not suggesting it is the best place to source the material but it is one place I've seen the blanks. The pen blanks were varying dimensions but I saw several in a bucket that would have been ample size to make a bridge from.\n\nKip...\n\nMahogany is too soft for a bridge, IMO. I like ebony bridges best.\n\nSilver maple is pretty variable. Some of it is great for sides and back, some is soft, stringy and difficult to work. I have a stash of it that is much better than any other silver maple I've used, and actually better than I expected, so it's definitely worth a try.\n\nThere is also a wood, never found it in person, called ironwood. Its so hard that people have made gun barrels from it. Yet, I can't find it and it's probably more expensive than ebony, despite being a domestic wood since it grows in the southwest.\n\nThere are several woods called ironwood. Some of them might be harder than ebony, but I don't know, and I doubt if it would be much harder if it is.\n\nJust a curiosity (and crazy question), is bamboo a hard wood or soft wood ? Can it be used for mandolin bridge ?\n\nI just use a short piece (about 1\") bamboo chopstick as the \"bridge\" of a special instrument I just built (only one string). I belive this little bamboo stick is OK as there is only one string at pretty low tension (the string is about 3 feet long !!!).\n\nBamboo is actually a grass (graminoids), but a lot of cultures in the world use it like we use timber or wood. There's a local mob here in Oz that chop and compress bamboo, mix it with epoxy and use the product for a hard durable flooring. I don't see why it couldn't perform as a bridge material. There are a few Balinese and Chinese instruments that use Bamboo as a form of bridge for some wild looking and sounding instruments.\n\nAs John mentioned, the term \"Ironwood\" covers a lot of different timbers. We have several here in Oz that commonly go by that name. In general your \"Ironwoods\" are not only hard, but usually very dense. Dense, heavy timbers don't always make good bridges (too heavy).\n\nThe ironwood that grows in the Southwest is called desert ironwood. It is a protected species, and the only legal harvest is from dead trees. The wood on the market tends to contain a lot of defects. It is extremely dense and hard. Other ironwoods from the Eastern US are hornbeam and hop-hornbeam. These woods are quite hard, but not so hard or dense as ebony.\n\nI made a lot of bridges from Beech. it is as hard or harder than Maple. Maple is considered suitable as well.\n\nYou need a closed grain wood, generally. Ash is open grained, so is Oak, Mahogany and Walnut. This is just my opinion.\n\nThis discussion lead me to do some web research and I found some interesting resources that I posted in a new thread HERE if anyone is interested in digging more into the nature of wood material properties.\n\nRegards,\n\nKip...\n\n[QUOTE=Mando Tristan;1018809] I can get ebony, but the local specialty lumber shop has very little and it is quite expensive\n\nEbony's not the only wood to use, for sure. It is the standard however. Try a bunch of different styles & materials; you'll learn a fair amount about fitting bridges. Here's an informative link about different bridge designs & materials:\n\nhttp://blog.murphymethod.com/category/mandolin-bridges/\n\nI, for one, am looking forward to what Stephen Perry is coming up with on his violin bridge refinements - translated to mando. (from this thread, post #-9):\n\nhttp://www.mandolincafe.com/forum/sh...t-f-quot-holes\n\nHere's a Desert Ironwood bridge I made for an archtop guitar. Great wood to work . . . but even stinkier than ebony.\n\nThe shape and density of the bridge had a very positive impact on the brightness and clarity of the redwood top.\n\nSteve"
