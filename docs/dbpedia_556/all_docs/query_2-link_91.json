        "text": "A question for the wood specialists. I need to replace a short section of rub rail. I was told that it is Philippine Iron Wood also know as Mangkono, Xanthostemon verdugonianus. What I was told the builder fell the trees for this and was unable to float them out of the forest, had to go back in and pull them out with a tractor. This makes sense as the boat was built in Subic Bay. Back on point, I have not been able to source this wood and wonder what might make a suitable replacement or better a source for the iron wood. I would need about 3 feet ot 8/4 X 4\"\n\nWet\n\nI have the same list, but my question to the wood nerds is a proper match for what is have with a source in Southern Cali of even within the US. That is why I included the proper name.\n\nRed Locust shouldn't be too hard to find. It barely floats and would likely be a good match for hardness. Similar to Greenheart. Just don't sand or cut it without a good mask, pretty toxic dust from either one. You may also find that you get a nasty rash from sanding dust where it gets on bare skin especially at waistline of pants or cuff and neck of a shirt. Sticks to sweaty skin and gets ground in. Treat it like fiberglass dust in that respect. Used to get it in the VI from Guyana I think. Sometimes called Brazilian Red Cheery or Jatoba.\n\nYeah, Jatoba is pretty easy to find. Guaranteed it has blood on it though.\n\nI never had a problem with the dust, but I do know of one guy who said it made his throat swell up.\n\nI have no firsthand experience with it. I've got a lot with Ipe and except for a tendency to check on unsealed cut ends, it's a fantastic material. Also, like all very hard species you absolutely must drill suitable pilot holes for any fastenings.\n\nAmerican Hornbeam (an east coast tree) was prevalent in military wooden ship building and used where a component would take severe stress, such as knees, early wooden capstan axles and the like. Real fun to cut with a chainsaw, BTW. Wouldn't do it atop dried leaves or dead grass unless I was interested in clearing them out really quickly, along with any surrounding brush, let's put it that way."
