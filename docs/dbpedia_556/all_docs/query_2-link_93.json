        "text": "What a disappointing three months it has been. When the rains started in January, I felt such relief to see the end of the 2019 drought. When the meteorologists then forecast a wetter-than-average autumn and winter, I was so optimistic about finally getting a good planting season. With my nursery overflowing with young trees desperate to go in the ground, the promised wet autumn couldn’t come soon enough. However, it has been exactly three months since we received our last proper rain. Since then, we’ve received nothing but the lightest drizzle, barely enough to wet the mulch. I’m still holding out some hope for rain in the near future, but so far the forecasts couldn’t have been further from the truth.\n\nNot surprisingly, the trees are feeling the stress. Many species still haven’t grown their leaves back from the heavy attacks by caterpillars in late summer. Those with leaves have barely recovered from the last drought. Apart from the reliable White Cedars (Melia azedarach) and figs (Ficus rubiginosa and F. obliqua), very few species have fruited this year. One exception is Elattostachys xylocarpa. Freed from a carpet of weeds in early 2019, one particular tree has produced a bumper crop of fruit. Being a member of the family Sapindaceae, its seeds are probably dispersed by birds; however, you wouldn’t guess it by looking at the fruits. The hard, woody capsules are a green-brown colour, and are certainly not appetising to any birds. However, when ripe they split open to show a bright pink inner surface. Presumably, this is to attract birds to the seeds inside. However, the rewards to birds for eating the seed are meagre; the only nutrition to be gained lies in a tiny, white, fleshy aril attached to the base of each seed. It’s so small, it is not even visible in this photo.\n\nI must confess that I have never seen any birds feeding on these seeds, but they must do so; I occasionally get seedlings sprouting around our bird baths and these baths are too far from a parent tree for an ant or other disperser to have carried the seeds.\n\nWith few fruits to report this month, and even fewer flowers, I figured it was as good an opportunity as ever to do a bit of trunk appreciation! Many of our local vine-scrub trees have very decorative bark, yet it is a feature that is rarely considered when people select trees for their garden. It’s a shame really, considering that flowers and fruits are so fleeting, yet trunks are there to enjoy year round. So here is a list of my top four local trunks:\n\n4) Cryptocarya sp. World’s End Pocket: This is actually a tree that has not yet been formally described by botanists, so does not yet have a scientific name. It was first collected here at World’s End Pocket, but also occurs elsewhere in the drier types of rainforest across southeast Queensland. It is by far the most common of the laurels (family Lauraceae) in Pine Mountain. This is a very important group of plants for local fruit-eating birds, due to their energy-rich fruits. Unfortunately, due to successive dry years, this species has not fruited in the four years we’ve lived at Pine Mountain. The foliage of the tree is relatively nondescript, but the trunk has curious patterns that look like they’ve been carved into them. This has given rise to the very fitting coloquial name, Totem Pole Tree.\n\n3) Flindersia collina: This is another tree that is often referred to by a colloquial name that honours the striking bark pattern: Leopard Ash. It is a very common tree in our local vine-scrubs, yet is far less recognised than its relative, the Crows Ash Flindersia australis. Crows Ash is often planted as a street tree in Ipswich and Brisbane, but I have no idea why the Leopard Ash is not equally (or more) popular. The grey bark of F. collina continually sheds in round patches to reveal orange and green spots, so it is decorative year round.\n\n2) Gossia bidwillii: Known as the Python Tree, for its smooth, blotchy bark, this is more of a large shrub than a tree. It’s the perfect size for most surburban gardens. They are related to lilly-pillies, but are more drought-tolerant and have far more decorative bark. It would criminal to clip them into a hedge, though, where the stems would be hidden by the foliage. Their main limitation is that they are quite slow-growing, and it’ll take many years before you will be able to appreciate the beautiful trunks.\n\n1) Choricarpia subargentea: Related to the previous species, it also has a similar bark pattern. The striking combination of silvery grey and orange make it my favourite local trunk! Unlike the previous species, it grow into a sizeable tree (with large buttress roots) in favourable locations. This is quite a rare species in southeast Queensland, and to my knowledge there is only a single colony in the Pine Mountain vine-scrubs. This is located at World’s End Pocket. A few smaller trees can be seen along Riverside Drive (where this photo was taken), but the largest specimens are to be found further down the sheltered southern slopes towards Brisbane River.\n\nSpeaking of trunks, each year we harvest one or two trees of Acacia disparrima from our property for fire wood. This is a species that does not naturally occur within intact rainforest, but readily establishes when there are large-scale disturbances like fire or clearing. On a property like ours, which has formerly been cleared of all its original vegetation, this is an abundant tree. It is also far more flammable than most rainforest species, so it can pose a fire hazard in large densities. Such fires would of course benefit the acacias, as it would enable more seeds to germinate, but it could kill many of the rainforest plants, not to mention pose a threat to people and property! Removing some each year therefore helps to reduce the threat of bushfires, and I fill the space left behind with some original vine-scrub plants. Anyway, we had long flagged two particularly large acacias beside our shed for removal this year. Not only are they a fire risk, their fallen foliage regularly blocks the gutters. I would much rather replace them with some smaller vine-scrub species. However, a pair of Tawny Frogmouths had other plans. About a week before we were scheduled to remove the trees, they moved into one of them as a daytime roosting spot. They then proceeded to stage a peaceful protest for two whole months, safe in the knowledge that I was never going to remove a tree that was being actively used by wildlife. They finally decided on a change of scenery and have since moved to another tree across the driveway (they have been there for two weeks now), allowing us to eventually proceed with our original plans.\n\nThere have actually been a few interesting bird sightings over the past month, but unfortunately I don’t have photos to show. A Noisy Pitta has returned to our property for the winter. We hear it call every dusk, but have never seen it. Doing so would require bashing through a mass of lantana to reach the patch of scrub it calls from, and I have neither the time nor the will.\n\nLast week, a flock of Cockatiels flew over the property one morning and headed east across the Brisbane River towards Kholo. This is only the second time I’ve recorded this species on the property, as they are normally found in dry countryside further west. The following day, a Satin Bowerbird appeared on our property ever so briefly. I heard the distinctive raspy call while I was down in the bush watering newly planted trees. By the time I ran back to the house to fetch my camera, it had flown from our creekside trees to the next ridge. This distant silouette is all I have to show for it.\n\nSatin Bowerbirds breed in the wet rainforests of the D’Aguilar Range and regularly move to the foothills around Brookfield, Pullenvale and Dundas in the winter months. I have always expected the odd one to wander over to Pine Mountain, but this is the first one I’ve found here.\n\nAnother species I rarely see at home is the little dragon Diporiphora australis, or Tommy Roundhead. One I spotted last weekend was only the third I’ve seen on the property. Curiously, all three were in the same general spot, which is a very open, disturbed, grassy area. It is also the only spot on our property that has a small outcrop of sandstone, which the species is known to favour. I have never encountered one near the house or in the vine-scrubs, despite spending most of my time there. I wonder how isolated our little population is.\n\nIn other exciting news, the summer rain has triggered the germination of several Codonocarpus attenuatus in areas I have previously weeded and planted. The reason this is exciting is that this is a species that appears to have disappeared from the vine-scrubs of Pine Mountain. Knowing that there were several historical records of the species locally (as recently as the 1990s), I have planted several on our property. My planted trees have had two fruiting seasons already, as it is a very fast-growing and maturing tree. However, it can’t handle competition with pasture grasses, lantana and other weeds, and it generally requires disturbance of the soil to germinate. All of the seedlings I’ve found are in patches of open soil in areas that I’m maintaining free of weeds and grass. I have propagated the species with difficulty (I generally get about 1% germination rates), so it is exciting to have the species spreading on its own accord. One seedling has even germinated near a spot where I tried planting one last year, only to lose it during the drought. Fate has decided that it was a good spot regardless."
