Horticultural (garden) plants are covered only incidentally.\n\nThis bibliography is intended to be of most use to those who are not professional botanists. For this reason, it lists mainly books, booklets, and electronic resources that have been released in the mainstream retail trade or free on-line. With a very few exceptions, it does not list the many authoritative and technical botanical monographs and journal articles that are the first point of publication of most of our botanical knowledge, and from which most of the more popular books are ultimately derived. Such journals are more difficult for the public to access – but you may still need to do so (see Disclaimer above). The easiest point of access for the more technical journal literature in hardcopy is usually the library at your State/Territory herbarium or botanic garden, or university libraries. For digitised material a specialist search engine (e.g. Google Scholar) or one of the scientific indexing services is recommended.\n\nThis bibliography provides guidance as to what resources exist for what regions or plant groups, a general indication of currency, and assessments of authority and comprehensiveness.\n\nFeedback\n\nWe have undoubtedly missed good regional, local or specialised publications – we would like to hear about them for future editions. Please contact email anpc@anpc.asn.au and start your subject line with ‘ID Bib’. We are aware that very few social media plant identification resources are included here – we would like to include these if they are demonstrably stable and have a history of providing authoritative identifications or referrals.\n\nNote to authors and publishers\n\nPlease be aware that the ANPC bulletin Australasian Plant Conservation is a good avenue for publicising new publications to the botanical and conservation communities. Please consider providing a review copy of new works or editions (see https://www.anpc.asn.au/apc/)\n\nOrganisation and content of the bibliography\n\nThe categories used are self-evident from the Contents list above. Not all plant groups have dedicated works outside the scientific literature – for such groups, and indeed for some of those for which there are sections here, the best available identification tools may not be group-specific publications, but others listed under FLORAS AND GENERAL FIELD GUIDES.\n\nEntries in each category are alphabetical by first author. Some publications by local authorities or enthusiast societies do not have a designated author, in which case publisher is listed as author.\n\nFor each work (book, CD-ROM/USB, or website), we give:\n\nTitle\n\nAuthor/s\n\nDate of publication\n\nPublisher\n\nNumber of pages\n\nISBN number. For pre-2007 publications, the ISBN is in the ten-digit format that applied at the time of publication; the corresponding ISBN numbers in the newer 13-digit system have mostly only been captured for post-2007 material.\n\nWebsite URL (if available in digitised form)\n\nThen follow a few lines describing the content and standard of the publication.\n\nAvailability of listed works\n\nMany listed publications are no longer in print, but we include them because many out-of-print titles are still in active use and circulation, may still be useful, or because individuals and libraries may want to assess their older books against newer options before making the investment – new books are expensive! Only latest are shown for most titles, but in some cases earlier editions may still be of use, although obsolete to some degree.\n\nSome out-of-print works may be found in specialist libraries only, but others have a long career on the household bookshelf or through second-hand bookshops, and may remain popular for decades. New, very local field guides (some of them excellent for the limited areas covered) are being produced every year, and may only be available locally or from private publishers.\n\nIf your local bookshop cannot obtain a publication, we suggest you contact the shop, visitor centre, or library at the Botanic Garden or Herbarium in your nearest capital city. These institutions, along with regional botanic gardens and regional offices of conservation and primary industries agencies, will also often have a public reference library containing some of these books.\n\nWhy are so many works included?\n\nPlant enthusiasts often have preferred and much-loved books for identification, but these may be increasingly out-of-date, or include only a small proportion of the species that occur in the area they cover. We have nevertheless thought it best to try for a fairly comprehensive list that allows some comparison of content and relevance, rather than to cull by date, size, or other criteria.\n\nOlder books should be used with caution, as many scientific names and much other information will be obsolete. Botanical knowledge of Australian plants has advanced greatly in the last thirty years, largely as a result of the Flora of Australia project, a continuing national cooperative effort of scientific research and publication, aimed at documenting all the plant life of the continent. The Flora of Australia is coordinated by the Australian Biological Resources Study (see http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications), and content is being progressively put on-line (http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/flora/main/) The Flora, and other State and Territory research programs, have resulted in recent years in the recognition of very many new genera, species and subspecies, with names and descriptions that do not appear in older publications.\n\nThis national scientific effort has led to not only many more technical papers, but also a faster flow-through of information from specialist journals to the more accessible Floras, handbooks and field-guides. Even so, for fully authoritative identification and up-to-date information in many plant groups it is often still necessary to supplement books with a careful examination of recent scientific journal papers, or to refer specimens to an expert.\n\n“Recommended” works\n\nWithin each category, some works are flagged as RECOMMENDED. For the sake of brevity we have used this single tag, rather than a hierarchy of ratings, but the ‘recommended’ rating should be interpreted against the taxonomic and geographic scope of the work, its date, and the evaluation comments provided.\n\nFor example, for FLORAS, a ‘recommended’ tag will mean that the work is authoritative and/or comprehensive, and should be used as a benchmark for all really serious identification work (subject to its date of publication!). Floras contain technical language but are still usable by a lay person prepared to learn terminology for the group of interest.\n\nFor GENERAL FIELD GUIDES and BOOKS ON MAJOR PLANT GROUPS, a ‘recommended’ tag is applied based a combination of authoritativeness, comprehensiveness, breadth of geographic or taxonomic area covered, reliability and ease of use, excellence of illustration, or simply that it is the best available for a poorly documented group or area.\n\nLack of a ‘recommended’ tag against any work does not necessarily mean that the work is not a good one for its defined scope. With a few exceptions, we have not assigned ‘recommended’ status to small-region handbooks and works of purely local scope, however good.\n\nDifferent users will have their own criteria for deciding which book is best for them – extensive images, plain-English versus technical terminology, availability of identification keys, relevant geographic scope, or size and robustness of a book for use in the field.\n\nWhere a user needs to identify and name plants for reasons that may carry implications of legal or professional liability (e.g. contract surveys for development proposals, threatened plant surveys, and other risk-related work), the literature listed in this guide should not be regarded as exhaustive. Recourse to both recent specialist journals and expert guidance is advised.\n\nPLANT IDENTIFICATION – WHERE TO START\n\nThe notes following each entry in this bibliography are intended to give guidance as to how comprehensive, current and authoritative each one is. In general, more recent resources are more reliable. Most reliable and comprehensive of all are the national, State and regional works called Floras. If recently published, these will be the most scientifically up to date, and other types of handbooks tend to draw their information from these Floras (or from the research publications on which the Flora treatments are based). Floras do have technical terms in their text, especially for tricky groups like orchids, grasses, daisies, fungi, etc. These terms are usually well-explained, and often illustrated, in a glossary or in the text. Floras always contain keys to species (a key is a series of yes/no questions about the features of a plant or plant specimen, that helps you to identify the species you have by progressively eliminating others). Keys, if up to date, are a very reliable way to identify plants, but the technical language can put people off.\n\nAn alternative approach is offered by many field handbooks, which emphasise illustrations of plants, often grouped by flower-colour, life form, or habitat type, and with only supplementary text. The user can browse the photographs and compare them with the specimen to be identified. These handbooks tend to be less than comprehensive, and less reliable as a definitive resource for identification, although some are very good.\n\nIf you are uncertain where to start, or how to use an identification key, an excellent introduction to identification techniques can be found in:\n\nClarke I & Lee H (2003) Name that flower: the identification of flowering plants. 2nd ed. Melbourne University Press, Carlton, Vic. 299 pp. ISBN 052285060X.\n\nThis provides an easy introduction to understanding the parts of the plant and the necessary terminology. It is not for identification to species, but is an excellent “how to” book, and for many Australian native plants may allow identification to family or genus level.\n\nA similar “how to”, specifically for apetaloid monocts, is:\n\nClarke I (2015) Name those Grasses. Identifying Grasses, sedges and Rushes. Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, Vic. 536 pp. ISBN 9780980407648.\n\nA how to identify’ guide for these groups, rather than a comprehensive species guide, although 206 species are covered as examples, many of them common. As with Clark & Lee’s (2003) general Name that Flower, this is a fabulous primer for improving your identification skills – in this case in three large groups that are often found intimidating. Illustrated throughout with excellent and well-labelled line drawings that help to decrypt the most difficult characters.\n\nFor field use in understanding plant parts (morphology) for beginners, a handy resource is:\n\nMager S & Burrows G [undated, c. 2010?] Botanical Field Guide (5th edition). Aracariaguides Publications (http://www.aracariaguides.com is non-operational at April 2019) ; postal: Aracaria Biodynamic Farm, PO Box 480 Mullumbimby NSW 2482; $15.00 rrp in 2015). ISBN lacking.\n\nThis A4 8-leaf laminated foldout guide is tough enough for field use, and very clearly explains some 400 terms of plant morphology via about 280 colour images.\n\nAlso handy for learning about plant morphology are the following resources:\n\nCharles Sturt University Virtual Herbarium http://www.csu.edu.au/herbarium/ (ELECTRONIC RESOURCES: ON-LINE – some interactivity):\n\nThe Virtual Floral Formula: a ‘floral formula’ is a concise, coded way of characterising the arrangement of flower parts. It is occasionally provided in identification literature and in more detailed texts on genera and families; perhaps its main use for plant-spotters is to enable rapid recording of the floral arrangement in the field or during the ID process when cross-checking literature. This website provides definitions, examples and an on-line tutorial in how to determine and use floral formulae.\n\nAustralian Plant Family recognition: this provides a summary of useful diagnostic characters for a dozen or so of the main Australian plant families, plus tutorials and interactive tests.\n\nGynoecium – a guide to flora structure: “Aspects of the sepals, petals and androecium (stamens) are usually relatively straightforward but interpreting the structure of the gynoecium often causes problems. This guide aims to reduce these problems by illustrating various aspects of the gynoecium”, such as ovary position and carpel structure, via definitions and a pictorial glossary.\n\nFloral symmetry: an illustrated glossary of terms to help you identify presence and type of symmetry (a common character in family keys).\n\nLeaves – a guide to leaf structure: an illustrated glossary covering leaf arrangement, insertion, and (in overly simplified form) leaf division.\n\nFor more advanced use, an excellent and extensively illustrated glossary of key characters for all plant families occurring in Australia can be found on the interactive resource:\n\nThiele KR & Adams LG (2014) Families of flowering plants of Australia – an interactive identification guide. Second revised edition. ABRS Identification Series, CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Vic./Australian Biological Resources Study, Canberra. FLASH DRIVE, ISBNs: 9781486301997. ELECTRONIC RESOURCE: INTERACTIVE\n\nThe first (2002) edition CD-ROM (ISBN 0643067213) is equally useful for this glossary aspect.\n\nFor very difficult identifications to family and genus level, especially where cultivated or newly naturalised plants are concerned, the following specialist work may be useful (ask your herbarium or university library if they have it):\n\nKubitzki K (general editor) (various dates from 1990) The families and genera of flowering plants. Springer, Heidelberg.\n\nThis encyclopaedic work, global in scope and still in progress, includes a vast amount of information, including morphological descriptive data and identification keys to subfamilies and genera, along with phylogenetic, biological, and ecological information.

CSIRO Publishing. 176 pp. ISBN-10: 0643094407, ISBN-13: 9780643094406. ELECTRONIC RESOURCE: e-book version: Also available as an e-book (ISBN-10: 9780643097162, ISBN-13:0643097163) — see http://www.publish.csiro.au/pid/5707.htm for details.\n\nThis excellent book covers the naming of wild and domesticated plants, why plant names change, their pronunciation, and hints to help remember them. The final section provides a detailed guide to web sites and published resources useful to people using plant names. (This edition supersedes earlier ones of the same title by Lumley & Spencer, which remain useful).\n\nPart 1: Resources by geographical region:\n\nnational, State/Territory, and local,\n\nincluding public identification services, flora information systems, floras, censuses, and general field guides.\n\nFloras are scientifically authoritative books used to identify all plants of a particular region. They are usually comprehensive (up to date of publication), and provide moderately to highly technical identification keys and short descriptions for all families, genera and species, together with explanatory glossaries, and sometimes line drawings or photographs. In several jurisdictions the printed Floras have been, or are being, translated into on-line electronic form as flora information systems, allowing wider and free delivery and more frequent updating. Both types of product are usually produced by a government Herbarium, that will often also have a plant identification service.\n\nHandbooks and field-guides tend to be more heavily illustrated and written in a more plain-English style than Floras. However they are often not fully comprehensive (concentrating on the more common or conspicuous species), the descriptions are often very abbreviated, and they may or may not contain identification keys.\n\nIdentification services listed here are those offered by major metropolitan or some regional herbaria. Be aware that some regional botanic gardens, and some some offices of environmental, primary industry and forestry agencies, may also house herbarium-style reference collections (specimens or photos) and/or be able to provide expert advice. Only space and time have prevented us from surveying and including these as specific options.\n\nNATIONAL\n\nHerbaria with identification services\n\nAustralian National Herbarium (Canberra) (part of the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research, Canberra)\n\nwww.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/plant-enquiry-service/index.html Scope: Plant, lichen and and macrofungal identifications and advice on most botanical subjects. No service for algae.\n\nCharges: Free for members of the public and for not-for-profit organisations (limit of 10 specimens per batch). Undergraduate students needing identifications as part of assignments must have tried using the Public Reference Herbarium first (see below); postgraduate students should discuss needs well ahead of time via the Herbarium Curator. Fees apply for commercial inquiries or batches of more than 10 specimens (reductions may apply for good collections useful for the herbarium and for collaborative projects)..\n\nSubmission of specimens: See website for guidance on collecting and preparing specimens and on data requirements. Specimens should be submitted at the Visitor Centre at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, Black Mountain (9.30-4.30 every day except Christmas Day). For mail submission please ensure specimens are prepared and air-dried (see website guidelines). Postal address: Plant Enquiry Service, Australian National Botanic Gardens, GPO Box 1777, CANBERRA, ACT, 2601.\n\nSelf-help: A Public Reference Herbarium is located in the Botanical Resource Centre at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, Clunies Ross St, Acton. This is a reference set of pressed specimens covering native and naturalised plants of the A.C.T., and the NSW Southern Tablelands, Australian Alps and South Coast. It is open for use by the public 9:30am – 4:30pm daily (but please book via the Visitor Centre on 02 6250 9450). First -time users must have an introductory session from one of the Facilitators. The Resource Centre has a microscope, botanical books, and a computer with interactive identification tools and links to the Internet.\n\nThe main State and Territory Herbaria (listed under jurisdiction headings below) can often also tackle enquiries on a national scale, with cross-referral where necessary.\n\nNational – Plant Census and Plant Name Index\n\nCouncil of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (ongoing) Australian Plant Census\n\nhttps://www.anbg.gov.au/chah/apc/\n\nThe Australian Plant Census (APC) is not an identification guide, but provides essential background information on the taxonomy and authorship for the Australian flowering plants, ferns, gymnosperms, hornworts and liverworts, both native and introduced. It also includes a coded summary statement of national distribution of each taxon. This may help narrow the field for difficult identifications within a group.\n\nAPC provides a list of currently accepted names, but does not provide full details of their usage in the taxonomic literature. For comprehensive bibliographic information, see the Australian Plant Name Index database (APNI, below). Be aware that a few species names may vary from one Australian jurisdiction to another, depending on what is recognised by the local authority (e.g. State Herbarium) – the APC designation of ‘currently accepted’ represents a more-or-less consensual national view but differences of scientific opinion do occur. Also note that plant names on legislative lists may sometimes be scientifically obsolete, but this does not affect the validity of their listing. APC is a work in progress – the nomenclatural inventory of some families is not yet completely up to date.\n\nAustralian National Herbarium (ongoing) Australian Plant Name Index (APNI).\n\nhttp://www.cpbr.gov.au/apni/index.html\n\nAPNI is another background resource for the plant identification process. APNI is a comprehensive index of plant scientific names applied to the Australian flora and their authorship, publication history and usage, irrespective of whether the name is currently recognised or is regarded as a synonym. APNI does not recommend any particular taxonomy or nomenclature – for a listing of currently accepted scientific names for the Australian vascular flora, see the Australian Plant Census (APC, above), which is linked from the APNI site.\n\nFlora of Australia series (and Fungi~ and Algae of Australia series)\n\nNote that depending on dates of publication, some State and Territory Floras and flora information system websites may be more up to date for some regions or taxonomic groups – see separate sections of this bibliography.\n\nFlora of Australia (various authors and editors, many volumes, publication proceeding).\n\nPublished initially by Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, and later by CSIRO Publishing, 1981-to present.\n\nThis series is an ongoing national project (target 60 volumes) to document all the native and naturalised plant and lichen species occurring in Australia. Each plant family is critically reviewed for the series. An index listing the families in each published or projected volume can be found inside the covers of each volume, or at the ABRS Website: http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/flora-of-australia/list.html\n\nEach volume is comprehensive up to date of publication (a few volumes are now very out of date). All species and subspecies are described, many are illustrated, and technical identification keys are provided. Depending on date of publication and allowing for some new research results since, many volumes remain authoritative texts for theoir groups and are here RECOMMENDED – see Plant Groups section below for some of these. Vol. 1 (2nd edn) has a useful glossary, an evolutionary history of Australian vegetation and of Australian botanical science, and a key to families occurring in Australia.\n\nELECTRONIC RESOURCE: Flora of Australia Online: Content of the printed Flora of Australia volumes is progressively being placed on-line, available from http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/flora/main/ .\n\nThis site allows search by taxon name and access to full text files including keys,but omits introductory chapters.\n\nFor a quick check of what families have or have not yet been digitised, see http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications/flora-of-australia (includes in/out-of-print status of hardcopy volumes, and links to the on-line database for those with digitised content.).\n\nAlgae of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications/algae) and\n\nFungi of Australia (http://www.environment.gov.au/science/abrs/publications/fungi-of-australia) are companion series covering those groups. Several hardcopy volumes have been published in each (see relavant sections of this bibliography) but as at 2015 there are no near-term plans for digitisation.\n\nAustralian Plant Image Index\n\nAustralian National Botanic Gardens (ongoing) Australian Plant Image Index (APII). Australian National Botanic Gardens and Australian National Herbarium (Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research), Canberra. ELECTRONIC ON-LINE: http://www.anbg.gov.au/photo/\n\nAPII comprises a very large set of authenticated plant images, actively curated (but allow for some time lags in adjustment to new nomenclature, hence some obsolete identifications). There are a number of search options. The Index includes both digitised images (presented in low-res), and entries for as-yet undigitized images held in the ANBG collection. Access to high-resolution versions require contact with the Index staff.

Easy-to-use interactive key, running on the LucID system, with links to an illustrated glossary of terms. Both full and short-diagnostic family descriptions are given, with lists of genera, notes, and over 1500 colour photos and line drawings of representative species.

In: (pp 521-584) Flora of Australia vol. 1: Introduction. 2nd edition. (AE Orchard & HS Thompson, eds). ABRS/CSIRO Australia. ISBN 0643059652 hbk.\n\nA standard dichotomous key to the families of flowering plants that are recorded as having species (native or naturalised exotic) in Australia. This volume also includes a series of background chapters on the Australan flora, not directly related to identification.\n\nThe Flora of Australia series is being progressively digitised and placed on line (http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/flora/main/), but as at June 2015 this volume is not digitally available.\n\nKeyBase: teaching old keys new tricks. (Multiple authors; ongoing).\n\nELECTRONIC RESOURCE, ON-LINE: limited interactivity: http://keybase.rbg.vic.gov.au/\n\nKeyBase is a large scale project that is synchronising separately published dichotomous keys within various plant groups, after parsing the key elements into a relational database. The aim is to allow (among other things):\n\nThe generation of ‘seamless’ composite keys (e.g. stitching together a good and up-to-date key to genera within a family at national level, with previously separate keys to species and subspecies within one or more of those genera).\n\nAllowing the generation by the user of ‘filtered’ or tailored keys (e.g. abridging a national key to a State, region, or locality of interest).\n\nRapidly ascertaining what character-states the authors of the contributing keys have regarded as most diagnostic between any two related taxa.\n\nKeyBase is a work in progress, but is already of significant potential use. However some familiarity with the structure and use (and preferably generation) of dichotomous keys is an advantage in using it, and keep a weather eye out for the vagaries that may arise from different original authors using the same terminology in somewhat different ways.\n\nAs at April 2019, partial or comprehensive keys are available for: Flowering plants of Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia; Floras of NSW, Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory,and ACT; Mosses and Ferns/Fern Allies of Australia; and the Horticultural Flora of South-eastern Australia.

Nevertheless a second-hand copy can be occasionally useful for placement to family, used in conjunction with more up to date resources.

Descriptive data is directly available on the above website, or as a DVD; the interactive identification component requires downloading (free) of the linked Intkey app. The characters scored for each family, in addition to fairly obvious morphological features, include geographical distributions, details of leaf and stem anatomy, embryology, germination syndrome, physiology, biochemistry and cytology. These data elements are all available for identification purposes or as part of a consolidated text diagnosis. Illustrations are provided for a few selected genera from each family. The latest edition of this package (April 2015) incorporates the family-level reclassification of flowering plant families by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG III, 2009).\n\nMiscellaneous national-scope general interest guides\n\nA number of handbooks attempt a snapshot approach to identification across the Australian flora or parts thereof. These are inevitably not comprehensive, and are more for general interest – they should not be relied upon for diagnostic identification, although the information they contain on particular species may be perfectly valid.\n\nBoland DJ et al.
