        "text": "Introduction\n\nWith over 5,000 species, Melastomataceae represents one of the largest Angiosperm families distributed in the subtropical and tropical regions around the world (POWO 2019). Members of this flowering family have a complicated evolutionary history (Renner 1993, Stein and Tobe 1989) and exhibit diverse morphological traits (Dellinger et al. 2018, Renner 1989, Varassin et al. 2008) and reproduction biology (Dellinger et al. 2019, dos Santos et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2014). The diversification of Melastomataceae is partially a result of hybridisation events. Interspecific hybridisation within a genus (Dai et al. 2012, Hawkins et al. 2016) and between genera (Hawkins et al. 2016, Zhou et al. 2020) have been reported. Empirical studies suggest that hybridisation in some genera of Melastomataceae are likely mediated by specialised insect pollinators. The pollination syndrome in Melastomataceae is mainly, but not exclusively, dependent on bees (superfamily Apoidea) that are able to vibrate pollen from poricidal anthers by sonication (Renner 1989). Although interspecific hybridisation via insect pollinators has been observed in Melastomataceae native to Asia, studies on insect-flower interactions in Melastomataceae are largely focused on New World species (e.g. Brito et al. 2016, Brito et al. 2017, Pereira et al. 2011, Renner 1989).\n\nThere are 18 species belonging to 12 genera of Melastomataceae in Taiwan (Huang and Huang 1996). Of these, Melastoma is the most speciose genus with four species. Two of which, namely Melastoma kudoi Sasaki and M. scaberrima (Hayata) (previously known as Otanthera scaberrima, but see Yang and Liu 2002) are endemic to the Island country, whereas the other two species, M. candidum D. Don and M. malabathricum L. are widely distributed in Asia, the Pacific and Australia (GBIF Secretariat 2019). Amongst the four species, M. kudoi is the rarest species, which has only been recorded from the type locality in central Taiwan. The population of M. kudoi is considered highly threatened and included in the national Red List (Editorial Committee of the Red List of Taiwan Plants 2017, listed as M. intermedia Dunn, but see the recent taxonomy revision by Dai et al. 2019) due to habitat disturbance and lack of inclusion in protected areas (Huang and Huang 1996). The other three Melastoma species can be commonly found in the lowlands up to mid-altitude mountainous areas (Huang and Huang 1996). Despite the great richness of Melastoma species in Taiwan, information about pollinators of these species is limited.\n\nTo date, only one study on the pollination biology of one Melastoma species, M. candidum, in Taiwan has been published (Liu et al. 2008). Noteworthy, interspecific hybridisation in this genus is often observed in both wild and cultivated plants in China and Southeast Asia (Cai et al. 2019, Wu et al. 2019, Zhou et al. 2017). Although genetic introgression has not been reported from Taiwan, co-occurrence of congeners, including the endangered and endemic M. kudoi, is common in Taiwan (C.J. Lin, unpublished data). Moreover, studies show that the primary pollinators for Melastoma species are non-specialised bees (e.g. Amegilla, Nomia (Maculonomia) and Xylocopa bees for M. affine (M. malabathricum), Gross 1993; Bombus, Nomia (Maculonomia) and Xylocopa bees for M. candidum, Liu et al. 2008). These generalist bees are also widely distributed in Taiwan (WCY and SSL, unpublished data) and their habitats commonly overlap with Melastoma species in the country. Whether these bees would visit all Melastoma species remains unknown. Therefore, understanding the pollinator fauna of all Melastoma species in Taiwan is essential to protect the Melastoma diversity, particularly the two endemic species, from potential genetic introgression. In the present project, we present the first checklist of flower-visiting insects of all known Melastoma species in Taiwan, based on empirical data.\n\nSampling methods\n\nStudy extent\n\nEstablished in 1990, Fushan Botanical Garden (FBG) (24°45'21.2\"N, 121°35'43.5\"E) is located in the mountainous area in the northeast of Taiwan Island (Fig. ). The garden is part of the Fushan Experimental Forest, which covers approximately 1,098 ha. The vegetation is characterised mainly by natural broad-leaf forest, dominated by trees of the families Lauraceae and Fagaceae (Su et al. 2010). The region has a subtropical monsoon climate and is generally humid throughout the year. The mean temperature of 18.4℃ ranging from 10℃ to 30℃ and peaks in the summer season (June-August). The annual rainfall is 3,787 mm, with more rain during the typhoon season (late August-October) (Lu and Huang 2013). The study was conducted at the garden’s nursery and surrounding trails.\n\nSampling description\n\nMelastoma flower visiting insect survey\n\nData on the diversity of insects that visited the flowers of all Melastoma species were obtained biweekly at FBG from 7 May 2020 to 19 August 2020. Melastoma species included M. malabathricum L., M. candidum D. Don, M. kudoi Sasaki and M. scaberrima (Hayata). We primarily follow the taxonomy of Yang and Liu (2002), but treat M. septemnervium as a synonym of M. candidum as suggested by the backbone of most catalogues (GBIF Secretariat 2019). Melastoma malabathricum is the only species of the four that is native to this region of Taiwan (CJL, unpublished data). For M. candidum, we included both the typical purple-flowered form and the white-flowered form. Ten wild M. malabathricum individuals were selected along the trails adjacent to the nursery. For the remaining species, including the white flower variant of M. candidum, 10-15 planted individuals for each type/species were used from the nursery. Ten planted individuals of a horticultural hybrid of M. scaberrima and M. kudoi (tentatively named as Melastoma kudoi x Melastoma scaberrima) were also included. For each survey session, observations of insects were made by 2-4 people at the same time for two consecutive days. The observation began roughly 45 mins after sunrise, usually between 6:30 am and 6:45 am and ended at around 11:30 am when flowers began closing or were out of pollen (JCCH, unpublished data). In the early stage of the study by mid-June 2020, continuous observations were made for M. malabathricum in the trails and the rest of the species in the nursery alternatively at 20-min intervals. After the end of M. malabathricum flowering season in mid-June, the observations were made continuously for all samples in the nursery site. Additional data, made by random observations outside of the scheduled survey sessions during the weekly phenology suvey (usually one hour in the morning) in another project during the same period, were also included to maximise our understanding of the diversity of flower-visiting insects. Taxa and behaviour (see the next section for details) of insects with body length > 3 mm present on the adaxial surface of flowers were recorded. Insects were identified visually in the field to the finest taxonomy level, whenever possible. For pollinators that could not be identified in the field, 1-3 individuals of each morphospecies were collected using a butterfly net or a plastic bag. All insect species were identified morphologically, following existing keys (Dubitzky et al. 2008, Hsu et al. 2018, Johnson and Triplehorn 2005, Starr 1992).\n\nBehaviour and insect-flower interaction classification\n\nTypes of behaviour of insects visiting flowers of Melastoma species were recorded by direct observations in the field. Further confirmations were made, based on pictures and videos taken using phone cameras. Seven behaviour categories were defined, depending on how insects interact with the flower and the location on the flower where the behaviour occurred, namely sonication, visiting, stamen herbivory, petal herbivory, recycling, drinking and passing (Table , Fig. ). We did not include pollen theft, another important insect behaviour related to interactions with flowers reported in other studies (e.g. Hargreaves et al. 2009). Despite bees often being observed placing their mouth parts at the porous dehiscence of the anther during our observation, there was no evidence that they removed pollen grains from the anthers. In many cases, bees stepped on anthers before they inserted their tongues and then sonicate the anthers afterwards. In other cases, especially near the end of the flowering season or at the last two hours before flowers closed, bees often left the flowers without sonicating the anthers after they performed such behaviour. Therefore, instead of pollen theft, we assume that bees assess pollen capacity of the anthers using both mouth parts and legs before they decide to buzz flowers. Under this context, both types of behaviour were included into the category of visiting. The observations of insect behaviour were further assigned into four types of insect-plant interactions, namely pollination, herbivory, commensalism and neutralism, based upon expected direct effects of each behaviour category for both insects and flowers (Table ).\n\nTable 1.\n\nInsect-flower interactionType of behaviourSign of expected effectDefinitionPollinationSonication+/+Emit buzz sounds when contacting stamens or pistil, producing vibrations that attempt to expel pollen out from anthersVisiting0/0, 0/+Contact any part of pistil and stamens without consuming and collecting materials and cause no obvious damage to the reproductive organsHerbivoryStamen herbivory+/-Damage stamens, but not the anthersPetal herbivory+/-Damage petalsCommensalismRecycling+/0Consume pollens expelled by other insects from the flower and water, usually on the petals, but occasionally at the female and male organsDrinking+/0Consume secretion from the flowerNeutralismPassing0/0Contact only the petals without consuming and collecting materials and cause no obvious damage to the petals\n\nAdditional information\n\nResults\n\nA total of 1,298 insect visits were observed, which generated 911 occurrence records of flower-visiting insects, of which more than one-third of the visits were made to the horticultural hybrid species, Melastoma kudoi x Melastoma scaberrima (n = 437). Of the remaining observations, 12-19% were recorded for each of the remaining species/forms and only 3.8% of the observations were recorded for M. scaberrima. Around 15.6% and 56.3% of the insects sampled could be identified to species and genus, respectively and the rest are identified to family or higher levels (Table ). The number of insect taxa recorded from each Melastoma species ranged from 9 to 39 morphospecies, for a total across all Melastoma species of at least 63 insect morphospecies of seven orders (Table ).\n\nTable 2.\n\nM. malabathricum M. candidum\n\npurple-flowered form M. candidum\n\nwhite-flowered form M. kudoi M. scaberrima Hybrid Blattodea Blaberoidea Ectobiidae Symploce sp.1 Coleoptera Chrysomeloidea Chrysomelidae Arthrotus tricolor 1 Basilepta varians 3Lagria sp.1 Monolepta hieroglyphica 1 Monolepta signata 55126 Nonarthra chengi 1Nonarthra sp.1 Theopea sauteri 216Unidentified leaf beetle7414 Elateroidea Elateridae Elateridae gen. sp.2 Scarabaeoidea Scarabaeidae Cetoniinae gen. sp.3 Popillia livida 4 Popillia taiwana 12Scarabaeidae gen. sp.12 Tenebrionoidea Mordellidae Mordellidae gen. sp.1Unidentified coleopteran11 Diptera Ephydroidea Drosophilidae Drosophilidae gen sp.3 Muscoidea Anthomyiidae Anthomyia illocata 1 Oestroidea Calliphoridae Calliphoridae gen. sp.3113Chrysomya sp.15422Chrysomya sp.23213 Sciaroidea Sciaridae Sciaridae gen. sp.2 Syrphoidea Syrphidae Episyrphus balteatus 1Paragus sp.1Sphaerophoria sp.1Syrphidae gen. sp.9211 Tephritoidea Tephritidae Spathulina acroleuca 11Unidentified dipteran84228 Hemiptera Coreoidea Coreidae Coreidae sp.1 Fulgoroidea Unidentified planthopper1 Lygaeoidea Geocoridae Geocoris varius 1 Miroidea Miridae Eurystylus sp.11 Pilophorus formosanus 26Miridae gen. sp.21 Reduvoidea Reduviidae 1 Reduviidae gen. sp.1Unidentified bug531 Hymenoptera Apoidea Apidae Amegilla calceifera 1Amegilla sp.5121 Amegilla urens 21 Apis cerana 64 Bombus eximius/flavescens 3124 Bombus flavescens 1 Ceratina pulchripes 42 Ceratina sauteri 2Ceratina sp.4111 Xylocopa dejeanii sauteri 12 Xylocopa rufipes 12 Xylocopa tranquebarorum 8714 Halictidae Lasioglossum formosae 82512 Lasioglossum scaphonotum 2 Lasioglossum subopacum subopacum 11112Lasioglossum sp.153392315105 Maculonomia planiventris 1 Maculonomia proxima 212Maculonomia sp.150316315162 Megachilidae Megachile rufovittata 1Megachile sp.2 Vespidae Vespa velutina 22Vespidae gen. sp.1Unidentified bee1114 Formicoidea Formicidae Crematogaster sp.1741Formicidae gen. sp.223223271251Myrmicinae sp.11Polyrhachis sp.11417 Tetraponera thagatensis 1 Ichneumonoidea Unidentified parasitoid wasp17717 Braconidae Braconidae gen. sp.1311 Ichneumonidae Ichneumonidae sp.1Unidentified hymenopteran1 Lepidoptera Arctiidae Arctiidae gen. sp.1 Erebidae Euproctis sp.2271 Noctuidae Noctuidae gen. sp.1 Papilionoidea Hesperiidae Borbo cinnara 1Hesperiidae gen. sp.12313 Lycaenidae Lycaenidae gen. sp.1 Nymphalidae Athyma selenophora 1 Papilionidae Graphium sarpedon 1Unidentified butterfly91132 Orthoptera Unidentified orthopteran11 Acridoidea Unidentified grasshopper25 Acrididae Xenocatantops brachycerus 3 Tettigonioidea Unidentified bush cricket5 Tettigoniidae Conocephalus melas 3Mecopoda sp.2Mecopodinae gen. sp.3\n\nVisiting, sonication and passing were the three most commonly-recorded types of behaviour, comprising 37.3%, 32.8% and 20.0%, respectively, of the total observations of behaviour (n = 1,240). The other four behaviour categories only accounted for less than 10.0% of the total observations. With 870 observations, pollination was the most dominant insect-flower interaction recorded on Melastoma species, followed by neutralism (n = 248), herbivory (n = 78) and commensalism (n = 44).\n\nPollinating insects that demonstrated sonication behaviour were exclusively bees in families Apidae and Halictidae (Hymenoptera: Superfamily Apoidea). Amongst all sonicating bees, sweat bees of genera Lasioglossum and Maculonomia were the two most common taxa, accounting for 89% of all flower visits (Fig. ). There was a higher diversity of pollinator taxa showing visiting behaviour than other types of behaviour on Melastoma flowers, including insects of 22 families of all seven orders. Lasioglossum and Maculonomia bees, adult insects of Coleoptera (mainly families Chrysomelidae and Elateroidea) and Formicidae (Hymenoptera) were the four most frequently encountered taxa in our samples (Table Fig. ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study provides the first checklist of flower-visiting insects to all Melastoma species in Taiwan with an emphasis on insect-plant interactions, based on our field observations. Our data show a diverse flower-visiting insect fauna of at least 63 morphospecies which is higher than observations in similar studies on Melastoma (Gross 1993, Liu et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2014, Peng et al. 2012). The majority of the insects exhibited sonicating and visiting behaviour, which presumably can be linked to pollination interaction. Buzz-pollinating bees of the families Apidae and Halictidae and particularly members of the genera Lasioglossum and Maculonomia, were the most common pollinators of Melastoma plants in our study site. These findings support the previous conclusion that this genus is primarily buzz-pollinated and highly dependent on bees for pollination.\n\nDespite the commonality in the dependence of buzz-pollinating bees, our results reveal a different bee pollinator composition to other studies on Melastoma plants, even for the same plant species. Liu et al. (2008) studied pollination biology of Melastoma candidum and other three confamiliar species in Melastomataceae in central Taiwan and found that bees of genera Bambus and Xylocopa (both Apidae) are the primary pollinators. Studies on M. malabathricum (affine) in Australia (Gross 1993) reported Xylocopa, Amegilla (family Apidae) and Nomia (Maculonomia) as the main pollinators. Studies on several Melastoma species in southern China suggested that Bambus and Xylocopa, as well as Amegilla bees, are the most important pollinators (Liu et al. 2008, Luo et al. 2008, Peng et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2014). Except Maculonomia bees, these common bee pollinators of Melastoma, particularly the genus Amegilla, represent the minority in our observations.\n\nThe discrepancy between studies could be explained by the variations in local bee fauna. Landscape features (Ferreira et al. 2013, Sritongchuay and Bumrungsri 2016), elevation effect (Hoiss et al. 2015) and biogeography (Traveset et al. 2016) could greatly shape bee assemblages and associated pollination networks via trait-filtering resource partitioning and phenological mismatches between pollinators and plants. This might not be the case in this study, because Amegilla and Bambus bees are both considered common and abundant at the Fushan Botanical Garden (WCY and SSL, unpublished data). For example, Amegilla were abundant at the nursery, but rarely visited Melastoma flowers throughout the study period (JCCH, YCH, WCY and SSL, unpublished data). A possible cause of the shifted pollination niches is that local bees might not recognise the experimental Melastoma plants as an available food resource (Williams 2002) since three of the four plant species are not native to Fushan. Nevertheless, lack of experience cannot completely explain why these bees did not visit the native M. malabathricum often. Other studies show that inter-specific competition of pollinators and pollens mediated by floral neighbourhoods (Bruckman and Campbell 2014) and the presence of a super pollinator (Gross and Mackay 1998, Thomson 2004), respectively, could also significantly change the pollinator-plant partnership. Further studies are necessary to clarify the causes of the shifted pollination network in Fushan.\n\nThe occurrence of herbivores and their damage to flower structures could supress the pollination process in several ways. First, complete loss of stamens and pollens inside certainly terminate the further chances of pollen transferring. Konzmann et al. (2020) demonstrated that physical modification of anthers could greatly affect the efficiency of pollen-spreading to bees in a neotropical Melastomataceae species. In this case, bees may fail to load pollen to their body if they sonicate damaged stamens, regardless of the amount of pollen remaining inside. Loss and modification of stamen(s) and petal(s) could also reduce the chance of flowers being visited by bees as these floral traits are often found as a resource guide in Melastomataceae plants (Larson and Barrett 1999, Luo et al. 2008). Moreover, in our observations, many herbivorous insects, particularly those with large body size, hindered other flower visitors by active-guarding behaviour or simply covering the reproductive organs with their body (as shown in Fig. c). Such trait-mediated processes, mediated by flower herbivores, could also diminish the pollination process at an early stage (Gonçalves-Souza et al. 2008).\n\nWhile reproduction biology is recognised as an essential part of plant conservation, identifying key pollinators and pollination mechanisms becomes fundamental (Havens et al. 2006, Moza and Bhatnagar 2007). Without such information, cultivation of closely-related species with high hybridisation potential, as observed in Melastoma (Dai et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2014, Wu et al. 2019) in ex situ collection sites, may increase chances of genetic introgression (Lozada-Gobilard et al. 2020). The hybridisation risk in ex situ collections might be more severe for sanctuaries in the tropics as most countries in the tropical regions usually have mega-diverse flora, but often grow high numbers of species in a confined area due to lack of sufficient infrastructure. Noteworthy, Target 8 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation aims to preserve at least 75% of threatened species of global flora by 2020. Following the Target, many national and regional botanical gardens, for example, Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, have been expanding their ex situ collections since 2012 (Botanic Gardens Conservation International 2012). Further studies on how environmental and ecological factors may drive pollination networks are helpful in preventing ex situ plant conservation from accidental hybridisation events."
