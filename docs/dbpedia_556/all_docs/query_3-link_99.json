Studies in Euphorbiaceae s.lat. 6. A revision of the genus Poranthera Rudge {Antidesmeae, Porantherinae) in Australia. Austrobaileya 7(1): 1-27. The genus Poranthera Rudge is revised for Australia. Oreoporanthera Hutch, is accepted as a taxonomic synonym of Poranthera. Fourteen species of Poranthera are recognised in Australia and a key is provided for their identification. The following are described here as new: P. dissecta Halford & R.J.F.Hend., P. florosa Halford & R.J.F.Hend., P. leiosperma Halford & RJ.F.Hend., P. obovata Halford & R.J.F.Hend. and P. oreophila Halford & R.J.F.Hend. The new combination P. petalifera (Orchard & J.B.Davies) Halford & R.J.F.Hend., based on Oreoporanthera petalifera Orchard & J.B.Davies, is made. New species are illustrated, all species are described and distribution maps provided, and notes on their distribution, habitat and phenology are given. Lectotypes are chosen for P. microphylla var. intermedia Mull.Arg. and P. arbuscula Sond. Poranthera coerulea Schwarz is neotypified.

Introduction Poranthera Rudge, as accepted here, is a genus of fifteen species that are annuals or herbaceous perennials. The genus has representatives in all Australian states as well as in New Zealand, with thirteen of the species endemic in Australia and one endemic in New Zealand. Centres of diversity are found in south-eastern Australia and south-western Western Australia. The species endemic in New Zealand is P. alpina Cheeseman ex Hook.f. which is not dealt with here. A description of this species is given in Cheeseman (1925). Webster (1994) included Poranthera Rudge, as well as Oreoporanthera Hutch., in Euphorbiaceae subfamily Phyllanthoideae Ascherson, tribe Antidesmeae (Sweet) Hurusawa, subtribe Porantherinae (Mull.Arg.) Kohler. The genus Poranthera was established by Rudge in 1811 to include a single species, P. ericifolia Rudge, based on material collected from Port Jackson, New South Wales (Rudge, 1811). The generic name is derived from Greek poros, pore, and anthera , anther, in reference to the species’ anther cells dehiscing by terminal pores. In his protologue of the genus and Accepted for publication 30 June 2005 species, Rudge mistakenly described its flowers as lacking a calyx. He was apparently deceived by the petaloid nature of their calyx lobes and was not aware of the presence of small, inconspicuous petals within the calyx whorl. Over the subsequent 55 years, another nine species of Poranthera were described by various authors. Brongniart (1833) described P. microphylla and P. corymbosa, Klotzsch (1848) described P. drummondii, P. ericoides, P glauca, P. huegelii and P. piceoides and Sonder (1857) described P. arbuscula while Baillon (1858) described P. linearoides , the name of which is an illegitimate synonym of P. corymbosa. Later, Baillon (1866) and Muller (1866) independently accepted Poranthera as containing only six species and both placed P. drummondii, P. piceoides and P. arbuscula in synonymy under P. microphylla, P. ericoides and P. corymbosa respectively. Muller (Joe. cit.), however, also recognised seven varieties; P. corymbosa var. arbuscula (Sond.) Mull.Arg., P. corymbosa var. genuina Mull.Arg. (= P. corymbosa Brongn. var. corymbosa ), P. microphylla var. diffusa Mull.Arg., P. microphylla var. drummondii (Klotzsch) 2 Miill.Arg., P. microphylla var. genuine/ Miill.Arg. (= P. microphylla Brongn. var. microphylla ), P. microphylla var. glauca Miill.Arg. and P. microphylla var. intermedia Miill.Arg. Seven years later, Bentham (1873), in his account of Poranthera in Flora Australiensis, accepted only five species in the genus, combining P. glauca with P. ericoides. In the most recent comprehensive work on Poranthera , Griining (1913) recognised the five species Bentham enumerated, re-instated P. drummondii as a species distinct from P. microphylla , distinguished a number of varieties in P. microphylla and P. corymbosa and included P. alpina, a species described by Hooker (1881) from New Zealand. Griming was the first to formally divide Poranthera into subgeneric groups describing Poranthera subgen. Euporanthera Griining (= Poranthera subgen. Poranthera ), characterised by having flowers of both sexes possessing petals and in terminal racemose or corymbose inflorescences, and with stipules thin and membraneous, and Poranthera subgen. Oreoporanthera Griining, distinguished by its flowers lacking petals, being solitary and axillary, and with stipules more or less leathery. Since Griining’s treatment, two other species have been described, namely P. triandra (Black 1916) and P. coerulea (Schwarz 1927). The genus Oreoporanthera was erected by Hutchinson in 1969 to accommodate the species from subalpine communities on the South Island of New Zealand previously known as Poranthera alpina Cheeseman ex Hook.f. (Hutchinson 1969). He distinguished Oreoporanthera from Poranthera by its dioecious habit, arrangement of flowers singly in upper leaf axils, opposite leaves with strongly recurved margins, and by its flowers which lacked petals in both sexes and a vestigial ovary in male flowers. Orchard & Davies (1985) added a second species, O. petalifera , to this genus. In their discussion, they noted that their newly described species, although closely related to O. alpina , disagreed with Hutchinson’s description of the genus in having petals in male and female flowers and a vestigial ovary in male flowers. The new species described in this paper as P. oreophila , is similiar to O. alpina and O. petalifera in its dioecy and strictly opposite Austrobaileya 7 (1): 1-27 (2005) leaves with strongly recurved margins. However, its flowers are borne in short dense terminal racemes. There is also a high-altitude form of P. microphylla occurring in the Australian Alps which resembles P. oreophila in having opposite leaves with more or less strongly revolute margins, but it differs from both those in its monoecy. It is our opinion that the distinctions used to separate Oreoporanthera from Poranthera are extremely tenuous. We therefore concur with Webb et al. (1988) that the separation of Oreoporanthera from Poranthera cannot be upheld and that the species concerned are best placed in a single genus named Poranthera. No formal subgeneric classification is followed in this revision though two informal groups can be recognised based on habit. These are either small annuals or small herbaceous perennials with annual stems dying back to a more or less woody rootstock (P. microphylla , P. dissecta, P. drummondii, P. triandra, P. coerulea, P. leiosperma, P. petalifera, P. florosa and P. oreophila ) or comparatively large annuals or perennials with ± woody stems (P. ericifolia , P. huegelii, P. corymbosa, P. obovata and P. ericoides). Materials and methods The present study involved examination of herbarium specimens by both authors, together with field investigations by the second author from 1988 to 1992. Altogether, approximately 1100 specimens have been examined and annotated. These comprise collections from the following herbaria: AD, BRI, CANB, DNA, HO, K, LD, MEL, NE, NSW, P and PERTH. The above acronyms and ones used in the text are those given by Holmgren et al. (1990). Author abbreviations follow Brummitt & Powell (1992). All specimens cited have been examined unless indicated as unseen n.v. (non visus). The species treated in the present paper are listed alphabetically. Descriptions of taxa were made from dried herbarium specimens, material preserved in 70% ethanol or dried material reconstituted by placing in boiling water for a few minutes. Measurements listed are based upon the total variation observed in the herbarium specimens examined. Colour of fresh Halford & Henderson, Revision of Poranthera vegetative and floral parts, where given, are either from herbarium label notes or from photographs taken by the second author during field studies. Plant size, habit, flowering and fruiting times, and habitat data were obtained from herbarium labels. The morphological data for this revision were recorded using the DELTA system (Dallwitz etal. 1993). The distribution maps were produced with Maplnfo Version 3 and are based on herbarium specimen locality data. Taxonomy Poranthera Rudge, Trans. Linn. Soc.

Distribution and habitat : Poranthera coerulea has a disjunct distribution. It occurs from the Darwin area east to Yirrkala, Northern Territory, with one isolated population in the Kimberley region, Western Australia. It is recorded as growing in open forest or woodland communities sometimes with a grassy understorey. The soils are sandy with ironstone gravel or lateritic red earths, in damp areas on plains or along damp creek beds. Map 1. Phenology : Flowers and fruits have been collected in March, April, July and September. Affinities : Poranthera coerulea is easily distinguished from P. microphylla, with which 5 it has been confused, by having a generally more robust habit, an alveolate seed coat and generally longer and broader leaves. Typification: No type material of the name Poranthera coerulea has been located by us. Schwarz (1927) published the name P. coerulea based on a specimen at B collected in the Darwin area by F. A.K. Blesser labelled “Port Darwin, 8 miles E (Bleeser no. 237)”. This type is believed to have been destroyed during the Second World War (McKee 1963). According to Orchard (1999), Bleeser also sent specimens from the Northern Territory to K, MEL and N SW. No duplicates of the above Bleeser collection have been located in material of Poranthera on loan from K, and searches in MEL and NSW (by the first author) have also been unsuccessful. The collection Chippendale 7856 (DNA) from approximately 16 km south east of Darwin is therefore chosen here as neotype of P. coerulea O.Schwarz. This collection agrees with the protologue description except that its leaves are slightly shorter in length than what Schwarz recorded for the species. 2. Poranthera corymbosa Brongn., Ann. Sci.

Distribution and habitat : Poranthera corymbosa occurs in south-eastern Australia from near Stanthorpe and the McPherson Range, in south-eastern Queensland, through New South Wales to East Gippsland, Victoria, with disjunct records from the Grampian, Pyrete and Brisbane Ranges, in western Victoria. It is recorded growing in heath, open eucalypt woodland or forest communities in mostly well- drained sandy soils overlying a variety of substrates. Map 2. Phenology : Flowers have been collected throughout the year, but mainly from September to November, fruits from September to January. Typification: In his protologue of/ 3 , corymbosa, Brongniart cited two collections, namely “ad Port-Jackson in Nova-Hollandia ( Gaudichaud et d’Urville in herb. Mus. Par.)”. These Gaudichaud and Dumont d’Urville collections Halford & Henderson, Revision of Poranthera have been located at P (numbered 152752 and 152751 respectively). The Gaudichaud specimen is selected here as lectotype of Poranthera corymbosa Brongn. as it is part of the original material, agrees with the protologue and is more than likely the material illustrated in the protologue. In his protologue of P. arbuscula, Sonder cited two collections, namely “Nov. Holland, austral. (Dr F. Mueller)” and “SieberHerb. Nov. Holl. no. 116 ex parte”. In MEL, there are three sheets of Sieber’s collection, numbered 2062901, 2065789 and 2062902, and one specimen labelled “P. arbuscula, P. cicabricosa, Nov. Holla. Austr. Ferd. Mueller”, numbered 2062936. They are all from Sonder’s herbarium. There is also a specimen in MEL numbered 694305 which is labelled “Poranthera cicabricosa f mueller (1847) Encounter Bay [SA]” which matches the Mueller collection in the Sonder herbarium. We believe it to be a duplicate of that specimen. The Mueller and Sieber collections Sonder cited actually comprise two distinct taxa. The Sieber collection is conspecific with P. corymbosa , while the Mueller collection is undoubtedly conspecific with P. huegelii as circumscribed here. The Sieber specimen numbered 2062902 is selected here as lectotype of P. arbuscula Sond. as it is part of the original material, agrees with the protologue and is possibly annotated P. arbuscula by Sonder himself. Notes: The plant Griming named P. corymbosa var. sparsifolia is probably conspecific with P. corymbosa as treated here but we have been unable to examine the syntypes to verify this. However, from Gruning’s description it is reasonable to assume the two taxa are conspecific and not worthy of formal recognition. The supposed locality of collection of the syntype “Queensland, Sandy Island” is somewhat unusual for P. corymbosa as no other collections of this species we know of have been made on any of the coastal islands of Queensland. However, the locality of collection given for the other syntype, “Parramatta, F. Mueller”, is within the presently known geographical range of P. corymbosa. Poranthera corymbosa is somewhat variable in leaf size and plant stature. However, there seems no justification for recognising 7 varieties within this species. Some small forms can be confused with P. ericifolia but can be distinguished from that by having entire stipules and generally more open, lax inflorescences. 3. Poranthera dissecta Halford & R.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera dissecta occurs in scattered populations in southern Western Australia, in an area more or less bounded by Norseman, Ravensthorpe and Karlgarin. It is recorded as growing in well- drained granitic loamy sand near granite outcrops. Map 3. Phenology : Flowers and fruits have been collected from August to October. Affinities: Poranthera dissecta resembles P. triandra in stature but differs from that by having narrow-ovate or oblong leaves, deeply dissected stipules, a 5-lobed calyx and a minutely striate seed surface. Collections of P. dissecta have been referred in the past to P. microphylla. Poranthera dissecta differs from P. microphylla by its deeply dissected stipules, smaller flowers and capsules and its striate seed surface. Etymology: The specific epithet is derived from Latin, dissectus, dissected, in reference to the species’ deeply dissected stipules. 4. Poranthera drummondii Klotzsch in J.G.C. Lehmann, PI.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera drummondii is confined to the coastal and subcoastal districts of south-west Western Australia, from Dirt Hartog Island southward to Augusta and eastward to Dillon Bay near Albany. It is recorded as growing in heathland, shrubland or open woodland communities in mostly sandy soils. Map 4. Phenology: Flowers have been collected from August to November, fruits from September to November. Affinities: Muller (1866) reduced this species to a variety of P. microphylla , while Bentham (1873) included it in P. microphylla without giving it formal recognition. Although P. drummondii is somewhat similar to the Western Australian populations of P. microphylla , it can easily be distinguished from that by its larger flowers and alveolate seed surface. 10 Notes : The collection Henderson H3148B (BRI) has seeds that are more or less reniform with a faintly reticulate surface. This gathering was part of the collection Henderson H3148A (BRI) which is typical of P. drummondii with wedge- shaped seeds and an alveolate seed surface. More collections and further research are required to determine if this specimen represents a form requiring formal recognition. 5. Poranthera ericifolia Rudge, Trans. Linn. Soc.

Distribution and habitat : Poranthera ericoides is confined to south-western Western Australia from Winchester south east to near Ravensthorpe. It is recorded as growing in closed heath or mallee communities with a heath-like understorey in sand or sandy loam soils sometimes with gravel in the profile. Map 6. 12 Phenology : Flowers have been collected from September to November, fruits in November. Affinities: Poranthera ericoides has been confused in the past with P. huegelii. Poranthera ericoides differs from that in the texture of its seed surface and in usually having a more compact habit. Notes: The inflorescence of P. ericoides is typically a more or less compact corymb, but there is a variant which has a more open and lax inflorescence somewhat resembling those in some forms of P. huegelii. This variation is particularly prevalent in material from the northern end of the range of P. ericoides , e.g. Craven 6964 (MEL), Phillips 1855 (CANB), Royce 9491 (PERTH) and Scrymgeour 1308 (PERTH). There is a collection at PERTH ( Coleby - Williams 312 ) from near Winchester which is c. 130 km north of the nearest other locality of collection of P. ericoides (in the Moore River National Park). This specimen is a plant which has a low compact habit typical of P. ericoides but its inflorescence is more corymbose than what is typical in P. ericoides. The collection Newbey 4593 at PERTH, from near Chillicup Pool, is a plant with a more open spreading habit than that of the typical form of P. ericoides. More collections, especially of fruiting material, and further field investigations are required to determine if any of these forms are worthy of formal recognition. 7.

Halford & Henderson, Revision of Poranthera Distribution and habitat : Poranthera florosa is confined to south-western Western Australia from Scott River and Boggy Lake eastwards to the Stirling Range, Thumb Peak Range and Cape Arid. It is recorded as growing in heath, eucalypt mallee or woodland communities in stony sandy clay or clayey loam soils, or on the edge of granite outcrops. Map 7. Phenology : Flowers have been collected from September to December, fruits from October to December. Affinities : Poranthera florosa is most closely related to P. drummondii with which it shares many attributes. However, it differs from that by having spathulate leaves which are generally broader than the narrow-oblanceolate leaves of P. drummondii. Poranthera florosa also differs from that by its slightly more robust growth habit and more floriferous inflorescence. Typification : In his protologue of P. microphylla var. intermedia , Muller cited Preiss no. 2045 at the Berlin Herbarium. The type material of P. microphylla var. intermedia has not been located at B, and it is believed to have been destroyed during World War II. Duplicates of Preiss no. 2045 have been located at LD (one sheet) and MEL (two sheets). While the MEL sheets are all of one species, the sheet at LD contains material of two species. The smaller of the two specimens on that sheet, the fragment on the right, has flowers, fruit and seed and is referable to P. microphylla as circumscribed here. The specimen on the left of the sheet has flowers and is what we consider to be the species here named P. florosa. The Preiss duplicates at MEL match the specimen on the left of the LD sheet. Both specimens on the LD sheet would fit the brief description in the protologue of P. micropylla var. intermedia. To fix the application of the name then, the specimen on the left of this sheet is chosen here as lectotype of P. microphylla var. intermedia. Etymology: The specific epithet is derived from Latin, florosus, profusely flowering, and refers to the more floriferous inflorescences produced by this species in comparison with those of P. drummondii. 13 8.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera huegelii has a disjunct distribution. It occurs in south¬ western Western Australia from New Norcia southwards to Augusta and eastwards to Israelite Bay, and in South Australia on Kangaroo Island and in the South Mount Lofty Ranges. It is recorded as growing in Eucalyptus woodland and open forest, and heath-mallee communities, often in sandy or gravelly lateritic soils. Map 8. Phenology : Flowers have been collected in March and from August to December, fruits in January, October and December. Affinities: Poranthera huegelii seems most closely related to P. corymbosa but is distinguishable from that and all other species of Poranthera by its fenestrellate seed coat. Notes: Poranthera huegelii shows variation in habit and the form of the inflorescence which relates somewhat to the geographical distribution of the species. Specimens from the western part of its range (from near NewNorica southward to Augusta) have an erect, more or less unbranched habit with widely spaced leaves along the stem and a diffuse corymbose inflorescence. Specimens from the eastern part of its range (from Mt Barker eastward to Israelite Bay, Western Australia, and from Kangaroo Island and the South Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia) tend to have a shorter and more branched habit, more crowded leaves and a more compact corymbose inflorescence. This eastern form has in the past been incorrectly identified as P. ericoides (e.g. by Weber 1986). Specimens from the Stirling Range, Western Australia, (e.g. Keighery 1195 (PERTH) and Spratt 19 (PERTH)) tend to have an even shorter stature than those from the eastern part of the species’ range. More collections and further investigations would be required to determine whether or not either of these forms warrants formal recognition. 15 9.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera leiosperma is recorded from across southern Australia with scattered occurrences near Southern Cross, Western Australia, eastwards through southern Northern Territory, South Australia, north-western Victoria to near Coonabarabran in western New South Wales. It is recorded as growing in open shrubland and mallee communities frequently with Triodia spp. in the understorey in red sandy soils. Map 9. Phenology : Flowers and fruits have been collected in January and from July to November. Affinities: Poranthera leiosperma is most closely related to P. microphylla with which it shares many attributes. However, it differs from that by having seeds with a smooth rather than tuberculate surface, longer leaves (11-15 mm long as compared with 6-11 mm long) and longer stipules (1.3-1.6 mm long as compared with 0.8-1.3 mm long). Poranthera leiosperma also differs from P. microphylla in its slightly more robust growth habit. Etymology: The specific epithet is derived from Greek, leio -, smooth, and spermus , seed, and Austrobaileya 7 (1): 1-27 (2005) refers to the smooth seed coat in this species which contrasts with that in the majority of Poranthera species which is variously ornamented. 10.

Distribution and habitat : Poranthera microphylla is widespread and is recorded in all Australian states though it is not found in the more arid regions of Australia. It also occurs in New Zealand. It is recorded as growing in a wide variety of habitats from coastal dunes to alpine mountain slopes in grassland, heathland, woodland and open forest communities on a range of substrates. Map 10. Phenology : Flowers and fruits have been collected throughout the year. Typification: In his protologue of P. microphylla, Brongniart cited two collections, namely “in Nova-Hollandia In Montibus Caeruleis near Port-Jackson (Lesson)” and “ad fretum Entrecasteaux (Vog. de Baudin, in herb. Mus. Par.)”. Two sheets of the Lesson collection and one sheet of the Baudin collection have been located amongst material on loan to BRI from P, and are numbered 152754,152755 and 152753 respectively. The Lesson specimen 152754 is selected here as lectotype of Poranthera microphylla as it is part of the original material, agrees with the protologue description and is more than likely the material illustrated in the protologue. Notes: Poranthera microphylla displays a large degree of morphological variation. However, the variants are not considered sufficiently distinct enough to warrant formal recognition here. In general, those plants from populations in the Kimberley in Western Australia, central Northern Territory and the Cook District in northern Queensland have more or less erect stems, linear leaves and generally comparatively smaller flowers, fruits and seeds than those of other forms; plants from south-western Western Australia and South Australia have a procumbent to erect habit and leaves narrow- obovate with a cuneate base; plants in eastern Australia, from north-eastern Queensland to Tasmania, generally have a sprawling to weakly ascending habit and spathulate leaves with an attenuate base. There is also a high-altitude form in the Australian Alps and in the higher altitudes in Halford & Henderson, Revision of Poranthera Tasmania which resembles P. oreophila and P. petalifera in having opposite leaves with more or less strongly revolute leaf margins and stout style branches. Some specimens of P. microphylla seem to possess a perennial rootstock ( e.g. Pullen 73 (CANB), Beardsell s.n. (MEL 1562983) and Telford EMC2227 (CANB)). This form of P. microphylla differs from the other mentioned species by having monoecious rather than dioecious plants. It also differs from P oreophila in having tuberculate rather than smooth seeds and from P. petalifera in having its flowers in terminal umbel-like racemes rather than being solitary in leaf axils. 11.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera oreophila occurs in alpine areas of south¬ eastern Australia from the Brindabella Range in the Australian Capital Territory, through Kosciusko National Park, New South Wales, to Nunnjong Tableland and Bogong High Plains, Victoria. It is recorded as growing mostly in stony clay loam soils in alpine tussock grassland and herbfield communities, at altitudes higher than 1300 metres. Map 12. Phenology : Flowers and fruits have been collected from November to May. Affinities: Poranthera oreophila has been identified as P. microphylla in the past but can be distinguished from that species by being dioecious and having smooth light brown seeds. Poranthera oreophila seems most closely related to P. petalifera but can be distinguished from that by having its flowers in tenninal racemes and its generally smaller male flowers. Poranthera oreophila is similar to the New Zealand endemic P. alpina but can be distinguished from that by having its flowers in short dense terminal racemes, both the male and female flowers possessing petals and male flowers with a vestigial ovary. Etymology: The specific epithet is derived from Greek, oreo-, mountain, and philus , loving, in reference to the species’ habitat. 22 Austrobaileya 7 (1): 1-27 (2005) Fig. 5. Poranthera oreophila.

Distribution and habitat: Poranthera petalifera is confined to Mount Anne in south¬ western Tasmania, occuring at altitudes from 800 to 1000 m above sea level. It is recorded as growing in crevices of exposed dolomite rocks in dwarf subalpine rainforest. Map 13. Phenology : Flowers have been collected in December and February, fruits in June. Affinities: Poranthera petalifera seems most closely related to P. oreophila and the New Zealand endemic P. alpina. It can be distinguished from the former by having its flowers borne singly in the axils of the upper leaves and generally by the larger male flowers.

It is recorded as growing in open eucalypt woodland, low shrubland or open mallee communities in sandy or loamy sand soils. Map 14. Phenology: Flowers and fruits have been collected from July to November Notes: The Central Australia collections Thomson 86 (DNA) and Beauglehole ACB20473B (NSW) are from populations somewhat isolated from the others of this species. These specimens differ from others of the species in having a colliculate rather than granulate seed surface and the calyx lobes of its female flowers are narrower than those observed in other collections. They also lack the reddish-brown marks that are prominent in other dried specimens of P. triandra. These specimens are tentatively included here within our concept of P. triandra but further collections and field studies are warranted to establish their correct identity.
