Abstract

Backhousieae is a small tribe of Myrtaceae composed of two genera (Backhousia and Choricarpia) endemic to Australia. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian) were performed on a combined chloroplast (matK, trnH–psbA, trnC–psbM, trnL–F, rps16) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacers) dataset for all nine species of Backhousia, two species of Choricarpia and two undescribed species. Backhousieae is monophyletic; however, Choricarpia is embedded within Backhousia. In all analyses there were four strongly supported clades containing two to four taxa, with no support for relationships among clades, and the relationships of B. bancroftii and B. citriodora remain unresolved. Bayesian relaxed-clock molecular dating indicated that the Backhousieae has been potentially present in rainforest across Australia for more than 50 million years. The current distribution of Backhousia is inferred to be largely due to the contraction of Australian rainforest in the Neogene. New combinations in Backhousia are made for the two species of Choricarpia, and B. gundarara and B. tetraptera are described as new species. B. gundarara is known only from the Kimberley region of Western Australia, widely disjunct from the remaining Backhousia in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, and appears to be a lineage isolated by increasing aridity during the Miocene.
