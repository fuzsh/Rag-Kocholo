        "text": "One of the elements that characterises the world of Romanesque churches, is undoubtedly the infinite play of stylistic mirrors and thematic cross-references, that transforms the whole of Sardinian Romanesque structures into a veritable pulsating and coherent architectural organism.\n\nThe church of Santa Maria, belonging to the medieval village of Sibiòla, registered from 1215 to the end of the 16th century, belonging to the curatorìa of Dolia and belonging to the giudicato of Cagliari, is a clear testimony of this.\n\nThe oldest attestation of the church's title appears in the last inventory, dating back to 1338, regarding the property owned in Sardinia by the Vittorini of Marseille.\n\nThe structure, with a double-nave plan, is one of the best preserved in Sardinia.\n\nThe two naves are unequal, the largest being the south, and are divided by four arches on low pillars with capitals.\n\nBoth naves are covered with a barrel vault, punctuated by sub-arches, which are a precious dating element: in fact, they can be compared to those present in the church of San Saturnino in Cagliari (1089-1119), which was an inspiring model for the construction of several Sardinian churches by the workers in the service of the Vittorini family.\n\nWhile the internal masonry is made of sandstone cantons, the external masonry has sub-square cantonments on the sides and in the apses, and rows of squared ashlars on the façade, between which are ashlars of various colours and the housing for the ceramic basins, now lost except for one fragment.\n\nWorthy of note, is the geometric solution followed for the rectangular arrangement of the cavities in the upper part of the façade.\n\nIn the centre of the façade, we note the presence of an ashlar with grooves for tarsìe, now restored, which presents a radiating circle.\n\nThe façade is square, circumscribed by corner pilasters; the sloping roof and the bell gable, of which only the base ashlars remain, have been lost.\n\nA small external staircase, built on the left side of the bell tower, allowed access.\n\nNine rounded hanging arches resting on decorated corbels mark the façade, and continue along the sides with more hanging arches.\n\nHaving paid our respects to this beautiful building, we can now resume our walk, ready for the next encounter."
