        "text": "My Wife and I stayed here for 9 nights from 8th July 2023. Having booked the whole trip Including transfers on EasyJet holidays we were whisked by private minivan from Olivia airport in a title over 90 minutes. We were greeted on arrival by a gentlemen who many others call out upon staying here - Ben who throughout our holiday was a credit to the hotel and so friendly efficient and welcoming as indeed were so many other of his colleagues. We were shown to the small Terrace overlooking the pool and gardens and welcomed with an upgraded room and two chilled flutes of. Prosecco. We stayed in the beautiful Superior Junior Suite - room 23, which is part of a block of three rooms down a steep slope from the Reception level. Our room, which housekeeping kept clean every day was large and fry almost like a “boathouse” in style with a wooden slopes ceiling, large double bed and walk in shower with Rainfall head. Our outdoor balcony have us a beautiful view down over fields and deep valleys to pretty Castelsardo village about 1.5kms away by road. If you decide against hiring a car, as we did, the hotel provides a free shuttle from 10 am to a local beach in a Bagnu. We paid the €10 per trip to into the town to meet a couple we know who were staying. Upon a quick phone call the hotel sent a car or mini van to take us home allowing us to visit so many other things including the Town beach in Castelsardo as well as a great snorkelling trip at The Se Project from the local port area. Both are worth checking out. We dined in the hotel on our first and last nights and ate beautiful fish dishes which the hotel specialises in. The in house Sommeliers are knowledgeable and will help you select from their varied wine cellars. Local Beers by the bottle are also available and can be served around the pool. Thank you to Tony who served us with a smile throughout our holiday. Saturday and Fridays are often busy in the restaurant with local couples and small groups coming for Dinner so worth reserving a table at Reception. Sunset was about 9 pm whilst we were there. Breakfast was a decent selection including fresh melon pineapple and other fruits, cereal, yoghurts as well as hot and sweet selections. Hot drinks and eggs (scrambled or boiled) or omelettes to order were always served with a smile by the ladies. As I said in the title this is a resort to kick back enjoy the views and relax in well appointed rooms and enjoy the food. Many other guests seemed to use the hotel as a base to explore the area. We also wen with our friends to a wine tasting at one of the many local wineries. The hotel even has its own Vines! The hotel is up a very steep slope and with no walkable path into town you should either budget for car hire or the hotel shuttle. The pool area is clean with a small Pool with integrated jacuzzi with two standalone whirlpools in the hotel grounds. Highly recommended Thank you to the whole team for a lovely holiday in the heatwav\n\n- Guest User\n\nHotel was lovely and clean with friendly staff. We did have a broken mug in our room which was quickly replaced but it was nice to have a kettle to make a drink anyway (a rarity it seems!). There was no English tv despite the hotel reception saying there was, but that was a minor issue. They sent a man to our room to try and fix it but he couldn’t which wasn’t too much of an issue. We were only there for 2 nights. Castelsardo itself was lovely. The hotel was a short drive away from there but there wasn’t a lot else around the hotel. The breakfast was lovely in a big airy room with lots of choices. Not much parking outside the hotel but people seemed to park down the street opposite if it was full. We didn’t use the pool but it all looked ok. One thing that was an issue for us (and not sure if this is just where our room happened to be located) but you could hear the guests using their toilet next door!!! And them flushing it woke us up in the night!\n\n- Guest User"
