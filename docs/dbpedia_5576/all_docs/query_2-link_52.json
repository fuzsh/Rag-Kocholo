Marked by its warm lagoons, white sands and wide secluded bays, Italy's sleepiest island is a traveller's paradise. Comparatively untouched by modern tourism, it offers up tranquillity and beaches characterised by pretty coves and crystal-clear waters. Stay close to the sugar-white sand, gorgeous inlets and glacier-blue water, or, alternatively, explore the island’s rugged inland hikes and the Bronze Age ruins known as \"nuraghi\".\n\nOn this self-drive tour, you'll get to know this beautiful island at your own pace. You'll start your tour on the north coast of Sardinia, where an unforgettable highlight awaits you: a bird-watching boat tour. Your journey will then take you to the west and east coasts, where culinary delights, beautiful nature and paradisiacal bays await you. You'll also get the chance to savour a taste of the regions with a wine tasting.\n\nGastronomic Sardinia\n\nSardinia’s inland is rugged and mountainous, while its coasts are characterised by exquisite beaches and turquoise waters: here, you will find the best of both worlds. And this can be extended to the island’s food culture, too. Inland, traditional dishes are based on meat and mountain produce, while at the coast you can enjoy some of the world’s best seafood dishes. Just like on mainland Italy, food is serious business here and simple dishes using locally sourced ingredients feature heavily in Sardinian cuisine.\n\nTypical island dishes include Su Porceddu, roasted pork – either on spit or in a fire pit – Zuppa Gallurese, a traditional casserole made with bread and cheese, and Fregula ai frutti di mare, a typical pasta dish made with delicious seafood, typically served in a saffron broth, another of Sardinia’s delicacies and also referred to as the island’s “red gold”.\n\nBird-watching boat tour on the Coghinas River\n\nAt the mouth of the Coghinas River is a 275-hectare nature reserve, which is the most important wetland area in northern Sardinia - it's populated by numerous species of resident and migratory birds that nest in the reed beds on the banks, and on the small river islands. The boat trip takes place about seven kilometres upstream through the idyllic surroundings. During the trip, not only will you learn about the migratory routes of the different species that are sighted, and their nesting and usual way of life, but you'll also get to know about the flora that is an important complement to this environment, as well as the terrapins, myriad species of dragonflies, and more.\n\nBefore boarding, binoculars are distributed, and life jackets put on for little ones. Some basics will also be explained to help with the sighting.\n\nPayment\n\nIf you book this deal before 35 days of your departure, you can choose to pay in parts. The deposit will be 50% of the deal’s price, plus the booking fee and travel and/or cancellation insurance (when applicable). You will find the payment amounts and deadlines to pay every installment at the last step of the booking process.\n\nSome of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. This website will provide you with information on the protection that applies in the case of each holiday and travel service offered before you make your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected.
