        "text": "Excursions and Points of Interest\n\nThe International Camping Valledoria, located near Castelsardo, between Stintino and Santa Teresa di Gallura, advises its guests about the following excursions: “SAN PIETRO BEACH”, “THE COGHINAS RIVER”, “TERME DI CASTELDORIA”, “MONTE USSONI AND BAIA OSTINA”, “THE ELEPHANT ROCK”, “CASTELSARDO”, “BADESI”, ” ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM “,” CALA TINNARI “,” COSTA PARADISO “,” AGGIUS “,” NURAGHE MAJORI “and” TEMPIO PAUSANIA “.\n\nThe beach of San Pietro\n\nThe beach of San Pietro is one of the beaches of the municipality of Valledoria that are located along the northern coast of Sardinia and overlook the Gulf of Asinara, in the province of Sassari. It is characterized by an expanse of soft and light-colored sand. There are posidonias beached in small quantities: the classic marine balls. It is bounded by the the river Coghinas on the right of the beach. The sea has a medium-low backdrop with a color scheme comprising the different shades of emerald green and blue. Medium-frequented during the summer months. Behind the beach there are small dunes and the Mediterranean scrub. How to get there: from Valledoria, proceed on Provincial Road 90. At the roundabout, turn right and continue straight until you reach the rest area. Services: available on the beach, possibility to rent equipment, deck chairs, sunbeds, umbrellas. Several hotel facilities and restaurants available in the area. Dominated by the small country church of San Pietro Celestino on a small promontory, San Pietro a mare is the beach par excellence of Valledoria. White sand dunes and a very wide beach that is reflected for about a kilometer on the turquoise sea. Continuing to the west, the tongue of golden sand becomes narrower to Maragnani to become extinct near the first houses of La Ciaccia, where it gives way to a new scenic beauty, the cliff, which will accompany us up to Castelsardo.\n\nThe Coghinas river\n\nThe Coghinas is the most important river in northern Sardinia; with a length of 116 km it is the third river of the island after the Tirso and the Flumendosa, but it results in 2 ° for basin width after the Tirso and the 2nd after the Flumendosa for average water flow. The term Coghinas, which in Logudorese means “kitchens” derives from the presence of hot water sources that, at the height of Casteldoria, a village near Santa Maria Coghinas, gush out giving life to a thermal complex already known in Roman times. The presence of salt-bromine-iodic waters that flow at a temperature of 76 ° C has allowed the development of modern facilities that, together with the beauty and richness of the flora and fauna of the places and the presence of protected areas, increase the potential of tourist development in the area, located less than 10 km from the most beautiful beaches of the Gulf of Asinara. There is the possibility to take daily excursion along the river with a kayak. The departure takes place near the thermal spring, where you can admire the steam games that the hot water causes on the surface of the river, and then continue between reeds and meditterranea scrub until the arrival in the lagoon a few steps from the sea. A challenging route where the camera is obligatory, you can immortalize White and grey herons , kingfishers, falcons, ducks, gabbelles and for those who are lucky the stork that has a nest about one kilometer before the bridge in the middle of the route. The experience can be carried out all year.\n\nFrom Monte Ussoni to Baia Ostina\n\nFrom Monte Ussoni to Baia Ostina is an itinerary that offers unique sceneries ranging from the mouth of the river Coghinas and its fertile valley to the uncontaminated coast between the end of the beaches of San Pietro and La Ciaccia and Baia Ostina close to Castelsardo. On the ss 134 proceeding from Castelsardo to Sedini-Valledoria you turn to Multeddu towards the forest yard on the left and proceed for several kilometers in the dense forest and among the vegetation consisting of the typical Mediterranean maquis with mastic bushes and holm oaks and other essences introduced with the work of forestation such as the domestic pine and the Aleppo pine. Arriving at the top of Monti Ussoni (348 m) you have a spectacular panoramic view of the entire Asinara Gulf. In the days without haze, you can enjoy the view from the coast of the Red Island, to Punta Canneddi and Tinnari (often you can also see the mountains of Corsica) to Porto Torres, Stintino and the whole island of Asinara. In the south-west there is Castelsardo and its promontory. Returning back you can choose to go and visit the beautiful oak forest of the Holy Spirit, which takes its name from the ruins of the church of the same name, or continue towards Baia Ostina.\n\nThe Elephant Rock\n\nThe Elephant Rock is a large trachytic and andesitic boulder, with a strong rust color, remarkably eroded by the atmospheric agents that have given it the singular aspect of a seated pachyderm. The rock, which has a height of about four meters, is located in the municipality of Castelsardo in the locality ‘Multeddu, at km 4.3 of the SS 134 that connects the aforementioned municipality to Sedini. Originally the boulder was part of the rocky complex of Mount Castellazzu from which it detached itself ‘rolling downstream. In addition to a certain tourism-landscape importance, the Elephant Rock also has a significant archaeological importance for the two domus de janas, dating back to the pre-nuraghic period, which are housed inside. The domus de janas, realized in two successive moments, are positioned on two different levels. The upper one, the first to be excavated, has only three rooms and lacks the covered pavilion that preceded it, probably collapsed together with the prospect of the tomb. The walls, flat and straight, have no sculptural motifs. The second hypogeum, which opens up below, on the contrary is very well preserved: it consists of four rooms and was originally preceded by a dromos, that is a short corridor, partly covered and open in the initial stretch. It is accessible via a narrow quadrangular door of 0.50 by 0.55 m. Of notable interest is the presence of a bovine protome, a decorative element common to several domus de janas, carved in relief on the wall of a cell. Its particular curvilinear style, which denotes a rather advanced artistic phase, allows the construction of the tomb to be traced back to the first half of the third millennium BC. This type of protome is stylistically similar to those found in the Tomba maggiore of the necropolis of S’Adde ‘and Asile di (Ossi), in the Tomba V of the necropolis of Montale’ (Sassari), in the tombs IV and VI of the Calancoi necropolis ( Sassari) and in the domus of the Orto del Beneficio Parrocchiale di Sennori.\n\nCastelsardo\n\nCastelsardo is a medieval village located in Northern Sardinia, in front of the Gulf of Asinara. It preserved practically intact thanks to its particular geographical position, a promontory close to the sea, which has preserved it from attacks and destruction over the centuries. Founded by the Genoese family of dorias with the name of Castelgenovese, it was then conquered by the Aragonese and renamed Castellaragonese. The current name Castelsardo dates back to the mid-18th century, when it replaced the Spanish one. Castelsardo today is a tourist-equipped town, with a marina and beautiful beaches and coves ideal for pleasant summer stays. During the year, rituals and traditions, such as the famous Lunissanti Festival, mark everyday life, characterized by the hard work of basket makers, fishermen and farmers.

There are glimpses of remarkable beauty that are characterized by the calcareous rocks that form plateaus and plateaus, dug by erosion phenomena that form valleys or cliffs. The prevailing vegetation is that typical of the Mediterranean maquis, which also developed in the hinterland and not only on the coasts, while the woods extend for no more than a few tens of hectares. In many of these slopes the watercourses, of which the main one is the Coghinas river, dig very deep valleys where the formation of medium-sized caves is not rare. In the areas of the hinterland there are flocks of sheep or grazing cows, which characterize the Sardinian landscape.\n\nBadesi\n\nA wide white beach stretches for kilometers, crossed by the Coghinas river, one of the most important river in Sardinia.

Thanks to its exposure to the mistral wind, this shoreline is the ideal destination for sailing enthusiasts throughout the year. Furthermore, the coast of Badesi has been recently declared a site of community interest, due to the richness of its flora and the peculiarities of its fauna, particularly the resident and migratory birds that nest in the middle of the reeds on the banks of the Coghinas river and of the river islets . But also the rest of the territory of the municipality is attractive and above all very varied, with hills covered with dense vegetation and flat, sandy soils where lush vineyards grow, from which the prestigious and award-winning Vermentino di Gallura (DOCG) is obtained.
