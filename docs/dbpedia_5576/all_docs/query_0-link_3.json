        "text": "An otherworldly festival with masked knights, maiden seamstresses and double-edged scepters, Oristano’s signature Carnival celebration is a race back in time with a coveted tin star as its prize.\n\nAt least 30,000 (and potentially up to 50,000) ancient Roman coins have been recovered in Sardinia after a recreational diver alerted authorities of spotting “something metallic.”\n\nOur recipe of the week is made with \"fregula\", similar to couscous but with a more toothsome bite. This grain is typical to Sardinia and best serves with a delicious clam sauce.\n\nFlights from Rome to Sardinia\n\nDoes anyone know if RyanAir is the only airline that flies from Rome to Sardinia, direct.\n\nHi, I am starting the process of building a simple minimalist studio space in Sardegna (no interiors walls, no bathroom and just a small kitchen) and I am looking for a good and trustworthy Geometra. I was wondering if anyone here had a good experience and could recommend one."
