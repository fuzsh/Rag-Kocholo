        "text": "Valledoria (Codaruina)\n\nValledoria (in the center of the north coast - only 11 km from Castelsardo) is a young, up-and-coming community with a long history. Although our town was officially founded in 1961, it is still possible to find evidence from a distant past in the area of the municipal borders.\n\nSardinia has been regarded as a very hospitable and peaceful cultural country for thousands of years, but it had to suffer a lot under its conquerors. As early as the Punic Wars, Iuliola (later also referred to as Ampurias) was an active and important trading center at the mouth of the Coghinas River.\n\nUnfortunately, these testimonies of the first settlement of Valledorias were largely destroyed by barbarian incursions, but this can not make forgotten in the distant past.\n\nThe name of the village of Valledoria (translated as Doria Valley) dates back to the Genoese family Doria, who dominated the northern land of the Middle Ages and built a castle on a nearby mountain range. The remains of this Casteldoria castle overlook the large valley of the river Coghinas.\n\nDuring the occupation by Aragon there were numerous epigrams, which almost completely depopulated the valley.\n\nAgriculture has greatly influenced the development of today's Valledoria. The strategically important position along the river Coghinas and the intensified cultivation of the fields have allowed the place and its immediate surroundings to flourish and become one of the most important producers of numerous agricultural products. The fields of Valledorias provide whole Europe with artichokes (November-April), melons and tomatoes (summer).\n\nThe wealth of water ensures that Valledoria has the necessary \"fresh wet\" in the warm and dry summer months.\n\nSince the 1970s, tourism has developed at a rapid pace and has become a major source of income. Along the Coghinas and the seacoast, always in harmony with nature, camping sites, hotels, holiday houses and apartments has been built. Tourist castles along the beaches are frowned upon here.\n\nValledoria offers a large selection of shopping opportunities of all kinds. Supermarkets (partly open all year round also on Sundays), fashion shops, shops and shops for holiday items are available.\n\nFurthermore, some jewelry stores and jewelers invite you to visit. They offer almost exclusively works of local goldsmiths (especially Sardinian filigree jewelery). In case of \"money shortage\", there are 2 banks (each with cash machine) which can help you.\n\nRestaurants, pizzerias and agritourism (= farms) make sure, that you want get hungry during the holidays. Guests can enjoy not only Italian dishes, but also regional, typical Sardinian dishes.\n\nAlso not quite unimportant is the presence of several specialized doctors(dentists, pediatricians, general practitioners, ....) and a pharmacy. During the summer months (mid-June to mid-September), a Guardia turistica also opens its doors. This is a medical service organized by the Sardinian Region for all local holidaymakers to who can be given medical assistance 24 hours a day./p>\n\nValledoria has developed over recent years into an important center of the north coast of Sardinia. For this reason, all shops, services and almost all restaurants are open and available all year round.\n\nTourism has contributed decisively to the positive development of Valledoria. In contrast to many other localities, Valledoria has succeeded in making the respective offers on the site even more generous and far-reaching than before - without affecting the Sardinian-Italian charm.\n\nWhatever the individual needs, our resort offers the possibility of an optimal holiday: whether you are looking for a relaxing holiday or an active holiday, whether you are alone or in a company, or if you want to transform your life experience into a pleasant memory - Valledoria can meet many needs.\n\nThe beaches of Sardinia are among the most beautiful in the world. Wide unspoilt, white beaches alternate with rocky secluded coves. The water quality is perfect.\n\nThe sea shines in many colors from turquoise blue to emerald green. The transparent water reflects bizarre rock formations of pink and gray granite. Valledoria is situated on one of the most beautiful and largest sand beaches in Northern Sardinia, the beach of San Pietro.\n\nAlong the river, on the sea coast, immersed in nature, to discover the lights, colors and smells of the seasons ... Valledoria offers the possibility to relax between a relaxing time on the beach, an adventurous discovery of the countryside, a quiet day-time between relaxation and healthy pleasure , Or cultural tourism from artisan to outstanding gastronomy .. or just a bit of everything. The beauty of Valledoria is that you do not have to choose: you can experience everything.\n\nOn the spot you can enjoy one of the longest and most beautiful sandy beaches of our island Sardinia. Due to the expansiveness of the sandy beach you can easily find your place on the beach in the summer without necessarily having to make acquaintance with a neighbor.\n\nThe water sports offer is wide. On the beach of La Ciaccia, you can rent inflatable boats with outboard engines in the summer months, while in the further course towards Valledoria you can also find a surfing school. In the area of ??the sandy beach of San Pietro a Mare (Valledoria) and the mouth of the river Coghinas you will find another, very professional surf school, a sailing center and a big canoe rental for unforgettable canoe excursions.\n\nIn addition, boat trips and birdwatching tours are offered on the river.\n\nTo the west are also rocky beaches, ideal for snorkeling, diving and fishing.\n\nThe fishing and yachting port of Castelsardo is located 11 km from the west, and the small fishing and marina of Isola Rossa is 15 km east. Both motor boats and sailing boats can be rented at both ports."
