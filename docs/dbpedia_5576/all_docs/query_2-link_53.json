        "text": "Valledoria overlooks the Gulf of Asinara, in Northwestern Sardinia. It was built in 1961 on the site of the ancient Roman city of Codes. Though fairly recent, this small town quickly gained popularity thanks to its proximity to the coast and its strategic location as a starting point for visiting nearby locations like Castelsardo, Isola Rossa and for visiting other historical and natural wonders of Northern Sardinia.\n\nValledoria offers its visitors 7 km of coastline, from Castelsardo to Badesi. It boasts beaches such as La Ciaccia and San Pietro, unique landscapes due to the contrast between the sand and the double blue horizons given by the sea and the Coghinas River.Valledoria is also entertainment and fun: from windsurfing to boat trips or hiking in the forests and surrounding rivers. This is an area that holds many surprises in store for you every day.\n\nLocated only 15 km from Valledoria, Castelsardo is a medieval village built on a rock that dominates over the Gulf of Asinara. Founded by the Doria family from Genoa, who originally named it Castelgenovese, Castelsardo still retains all of its original features: narrow streets, stairways and underpasses with little shops and boutiques selling local arts and crafts. You can visit the remains of the medieval Doria Castle, where the Museum of Mediterranean Weave is set, or the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie and the Cathedral of St. Antonio Abbate. In the evening the town lights up, providing for a magical background to a stroll from the port to the center, maybe stopping at the many bars along the way.\n\nThe Gulf of Asinara stretches out along Sardinia’s Northwestern coast, from Cape Falcone to Cape Testa. This coastline provides for some of the most beautiful beaches in Northern Sardinia, such as Platamona, Stintino, La Marinedda and Cala Li Cossi, set in a valley of granite and Mediterranean maquis: a truly breathtaking landscape. And then of course the most famous island on the northwestern coast, the Asinara: once an ancient penal colony, today it is a National Park.\n\nThe Gulf of Asinara stretches out along Sardinia’s Northwestern coast, from Cape Falcone to Cape Testa.
