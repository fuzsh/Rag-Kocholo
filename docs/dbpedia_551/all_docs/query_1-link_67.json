        "meta_description": "The floriculture industry includes cut flowers, cut greens, flowering potted plants, foliage potted plants, and bedding/garden plants. In the nation, U.S. floriculture is a strong industry, with wholesale (w) farm-gate receipts of $4.22 billion in 2008, grown by n=7,189 greenhouse growers. The Minnesota horticulture industry is robust ($2.1 billion, retail) and continues to grow. The bedding plant market continues to dominate floriculture production with 46% of sales. Herbaceous perennial sales continue to grow, valued at $526 million (w) for 2008. Horticulture trade is a global phenomenon throughout the distribution channel. E-commerce and internet sales have enabled any customer anywhere in the world to purchase materials on the global market. Our modern industry is characterized by quickly moving large quantities of products everywhere. Live plant imports into the U.S. have increased ~50% since 1995. A high percentage of the increase in sales of floricultural products is due to consumer-driven national or international marketing campaigns (branding, trade marking) and aggressive plant breeding/genetic programs. As a function of a competitive market, the industry thrives on novelty products with proven performance over a wide range of environments. Recently domesticated floriculture crops include a wide range of seed and vegetatively propagated annuals and perennials. The rise of garden chrysanthemums as the No. 1 herbaceous perennial was due, in part, to the innovative breeding of the MammothTM series at the University of Minnesota. This series possesses a new plant phenotype (shrubs) with superior winter hardiness, flower power, convenience, and butterfly attraction. Despite the robust floriculture industry, public sector flower breeding programs in the U.S. have been declining in number in recent years from n=34 in 1983 to n<20) and recruitment of flower breeders/geneticists with graduate degrees has declined due to acquisitions. Demand for flower breeders with classical breeding and molecular training to conduct long-term, high-risk research is primarily being met by this flower breeding program; other public sector programs focus more on molecular training. The continued growth of the bedding plants and the increased demand for herbaceous perennials in the market creates an important need for public sector research. Both new and re-tailored old crops are being researched and bred to fit this market niche. Research objectives reflect our focus on long-term, high-risk questions, which are not being conducted by private sector programs, on seed and vegetative crops, particularly geophytes. These research objectives include germplasm enhancement and risk assessment of invasive potential in flowering crops. Flowers have many beneficial components for the consumer that are created, enhanced, or improved by flower breeding programs using classical or molecular techniques. Combination of traditional and new traits will enable both public and private sector advancement of flower breeding.",

Sarah is currently writing two manuscripts on Prunus seed germination and pollen viability under long-term storage for her thesis; Jaser Aljaser (Ph.D. student, Applied Plant Sciences Graduate Program) joined the program in fall of this year; he is pursuing research on gladiolus seed germination and rapid generation cycling. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?This year&#39;s research findings have been reported via journal articles (primary literature), web-based communications (popular press), and extension events at Research and Outreach Centers to target audiences of floriculture breeders, geneticists, producers, distributors, brokers, growers, and retailers (particularly in chrysanthemum, gladiolus, iris, lily, and gaura crops) in both the public and private sectors; plant ecologists working with risk assessment and invasion biology; plant physiologists working with cold and stress tolerance; extension specialists working with ornamental, flowering horticultural crops; public gardens and arboreta; landscape designers and architects; the gardening public, particularly Master Gardeners and Junior Master Gardeners. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?Gladiolus breeding will progress with asexual and sexual propagation of selections and seedlings, respectively, to enhance the frequency of winter hardy and/or dwarf phenotypes to determine heritability of these traits. Mini-flowered phlox will be clonally propagated for the first year of replicated trials for garden performance and winter hardiness. Phlox seedlings will also be screened to determine heritability of flower diameter and petal lengths. Iris domestica seedling selections and advanced generation screening will be accomplished with multiple location trialing over years. Continued breeding and selection of enhanced pyrethrum levels (PyI, PyII compounds) in Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium disk florets will be coupled with increased flower number, synchronicity of flowering, annualization, winter hardiness, and stability of expression in multiple environments (greenhouse and fields in Minnesota vs. field trials in central Africa). The heritability of flower colors and patterns will commence. Molecular analyses of reed canarygrass and interspecific lilies will continue to answer questions of genetic variation and gene expression.\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? In continuance of research with dwarf Gladiolus xhybridus, discovery of novel traits in floricultural crops continued unabated. Hybridizations between dwarf genotypes have been made to determine heritability. Germination (week) in the plug phase and correlation with flowering date, fast generation cycling (2-3/year), along with selection for high leaf number and early stem stalk emergence in cycles 1-3 were analyzed in populations (from 71 crosses; N=1,026 seedlings). Seedlings germinated primarily in weeks 2-4 after sowing (G2-G4) although some crosses took until G7. All seedlings had one leaf/plant in cycle 1. Whereas in cycle 2, leaf counts ranged from one to seven. By cycle 2, 6% of the seedlings (primarily from six crosses) also had elongated stems with 1-4 leaves/stem. Stem elongation in cycle 2 is a highly heritable trait and alleles were concentrated in &lt;10 parents. Cycle 3 plants with elongated stems flowered, reducing the typical generation time of five years (from seed to flowering) to as few as 3 years or cycles. A subsequent set of progeny had significantly reduced juvenility period to annual equivalency. This was accomplished with &gt;15 years of reduction in juvenility with selection for early germinating seedlings (G2-G3 weeks after sowing) and rapid generation cycling techniques. Three sets of interspecific Gladiolus xhybridus seedlings (N=3,110) among &gt;250 populations were analyzed for juvenile growth (no. of leaves, stems, stem height) and occurrence of phase change (visible bud date, anthesis). Selection for early germination, high leaf number and stem elongation resulted in 0.4% flowering in year one among N=1,056 seedlings. Among the flowering seedlings, mean number of days from sowing to visible bud and flowering was &lt;16 wks. The lack of selection pressure for short juvenility periods in wild populations of geophytes is unknown. Breeding of dwarf, winter hardy Iris domestica with short flower scapes has continued with analysis of 73 crosses and 1,626 seedlings leading to the discovery this year of more novel flower colors, bicolored patterns, picotee types, and one nearly double-flowered hybrid. Double flowers would be ideal to easily eliminate seed set and prevent their potential invasive spread. Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium (pyrethrum) are being crossed in a full diallel to study the sporophytic self incompatibility system and determine the number of S alleles operating in the species. This will aid in determining S allele configuration of selected parents for use to create hybrid seed. Yield of % PyI/PyII was variable across flowers and harvest weeks in field production of winter hardy genotypes. Concentration of alleles for high % PyI/PyII, coupled with winter hardy, high flower count and early germinating &amp; flowering alleles continues. Phalaris commercial ornamental/forage cultivars sold within the Czech Republic were compared with wild genotypes from native populations along major Czech rivers to characterize the extent of phenotypic and genetic variation. Several phenotypic traits differentiated between genotypes and populations (tiller initial fresh weight, stem biomass, above- and below-ground biomass, tiller number, % cover, crown area, height, leaf and node number), while the remaining traits did not differ. Genetic markers (inter-simple sequence repeats) for the first time ever, clearly differentiated ornamental cultivars from wild P. arundinacea. &#39;Chrastava&#39;, the Czech forage and biomass cultivar was genetically similar to wild genotypes, which have most of the genetic diversity within, rather than among, populations. Cluster analyses showed ornamental cultivar ramets to be heterogeneous most likely due to clonal mix up or mutations. Ten garden chrysanthemum genotypes from the University of Minnesota and South Korean breeding programs were tested in four environments (low, LT; high, HT temperatures and short- [SD], long-day [LD] conditions to determine the extent of heat delay for visible bud date (VBD), flowering and other phenotypic traits, evaluate relative injury (RI) and cell membrane thermostability (CMT), and to select future parents with lowered RI values, higher CMT, shorter heat-induced flowering delay and/or HDI. Magic Ball and Minnwhite had the shortest plant height in HTLD and HTSD whereas Geumbangul had stability for height in all treatments. Lowest long day leaf numbers (LDLN) occurred under LTSD in seven genotypes. However, both Geumbangul and Magic Ball had complete stability for LDLN across all environments. Only Mellow Moon had stability or equal VBDs in HTSD, LTSD, and LTLD conditions. This is the first-ever report of stability for VBD across inductive and non-inductive high/low temperature treatments. Only Centerpiece flowered in all environments and also had 0 d of heat for VBD in LT and 1 d of heat delay in HT, as well as three others genotypes. Few had linear regressions with positive slopes for heat-induced VBD or flowering delay regressed with RI%. Surprisingly, Geumbangul had linear regression with a slope of R2=1.0. These responses are all novel in chrysanthemums. Selecting the best parents in both breeding programs to maximize stability of all traits across these four environments with minimal crossing and selection across generations could be accomplished by stacking parental traits. A crossing scheme involving just three parents is proposed to incorporate stability for all traits in just a few generations.\n\nPublications\n\nType: Conference Papers and Presentations Status: Published Year Published: 2015 Citation: Anderson, N.O. 2015.

Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided? Drs. Jan Kvet, Dasa Bastlova, Vladislav Curn, Keith Edwards, Hana Cizkova and Barbora Kubatova, affiliated with the Faculties of Science &amp; Agriculture, Departments of Ecosystems Biology, Plant Production &amp; Plant Physiology, Jihoceska Univerzita (University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) and the Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences, Trebon, Czech Republic, participated in the morphological and molecular data analyses of the Czech reed canarygrass populations. One manuscript has already been submitted for publication. Our cooperative research with invasive Phalaris arundinacea, Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and Leucanthemum samples continues under the auspices of our joint Czech-US AMVIS grants. Two research Chrysanthemum scientists are conducting breeding and selection experiments for cold-tolerant garden and greenhouse chrysanthemums in South Korea. Drs. Dong-Chan Kim and Mi-Kyoung Won, The Chungcheongnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services (CNARES), Republic of Korea, are in the 3rd year of joint chrysanthemum breeding research with our program. Hybrid selections are in their 2nd trialing year, allowing for winterhardiness and garden performance selection both in Minnesota and Sout Korean trials. Dr. Robert Suranyi, McLaughlin Gormley King Company, Minneapolis, MN works with us in the pyrethrum breeding program. Mike Nelson defended his Ph.D. this spring in the Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program. His five papers on invasiveness of reed canarygrass are submitted or already published. David Munter, an M.S. student in Applied Plant Sciences and co-advised with Dr. J. Luby, conducted his 2nd year of reproductive biology and intraspecific and intergeneric crossing studies in Prickly Ash, Zanthoxylum americanum. Sarah Kostick, an M.S. student in Applied Plant Sciences and co-advised with Dr. E. Hoover, began her 1st year of studies and experimentation with Prunus seed germination and pollen stainability. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? This year&rsquo;s research findings have been reported via journal articles (primary literature), web-based communications (popular press), and extension events at Research and Outreach Centers to target audiences of floriculture breeders, geneticists, producers, distributors, brokers, growers, and retailers (particularly in chrysanthemum, gladiolus, lily, and gaura crops) in both the public and private sectors; plant ecologists working with risk assessment and invasion biology; plant physiologists working with cold and stress tolerance; extension specialists working with ornamental, flowering horticultural crops; public gardens and arboreta; landscape designers and architects; the gardening public, particularly Master Gardeners and Junior Master Gardeners. The University of Minnesota Herbaceous Perennial Breeding Program is recognized as one of the premiere public-sector flower breeding project programs in the world. Our creation of new chrysanthemum plant habits (from large shrubs to groundcover types), discovery and breeding of reflowering, non-vernalization requiring lilies, release of USDA Z4 winter-hardy gladiolus, and cold-tolerant gaura are example research efforts enabling the generation of revitalized floricultural crops for the 21st century. The new shrub chrysanthemums resulted in increased U.S. chrysanthemum sales from $104.8M (wholesale) in 2001 (when the first shrub type was released) to $123.65M (wholesale) in 2012, helping make mums the #1 herbaceous perennial in U.S. sales. Shrub types also prompted growers to sell traditional cushion cultivars in larger containers to mimic shrub types. Winter hardy gladioli would not require digging the corms in the fall for overwintering; multiple flowering stems on each plant would increase cut stem yields. Our advancements in lily breeding have resulted in the creation of colored, seed-propagated hybrids for continued development and domestication. Lilies which flower &lt;1 yr. from seed and continuously flower thereafter will significantly alter production and use of this crop as a cut flower, flowering potted plant, and garden perennial. Cut flower growers could harvest multiple stems/plant (rather than the standard 1/bulb) continuously throughout the growing season (field) or in greenhouses (year-round)&mdash;rather than having to purchase and force a new crop of bulbs for each harvest. Flowering potted lilies would become dual-use products, enjoyed indoors for a holiday and then reflowered either indoors or outdoors for the growing season. As garden perennials, such lilies would allow for flowering throughout the season rather than just for ~1-month. Focus on preventing the creation of invasive ornamental floriculture crops prior to their release onto the market has led to research on contributing factors within the horticultural distribution channel, risk assessment, as well as plant traits to select against during domestication. Reed canarygrass, an ornamental herbaceous perennial, is being used as a model plant in which to study these factors. Continual incorporation of new traits, such as non-invasiveness and drought/heat tolerance will enable continued growth of the floriculture sector with readily adaptable germplasm. Testing for invasive potential of ornamental crops, prior to market release, must involve genotype-specific testing in multiple sites and locations over years, similar to the methodology used to assess winter hardiness. While costly, the long-term gains in preventing horticultural crop invasions are greater than selling non-winter hardy perennials. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? Gladiolus breeding will progress with asexual and sexual propagation of selections and seedlings, respectively, to enhance the frequency of winter hardy and/or dwarf phenotypes to determine heritability of these traits. Mini-flowered phlox will be clonally propagated for the first year of replicated trials for garden performance and winter hardiness. Phlox seedlings will also be screened to determine heritability of flower diameter and petal lengths. Iris domestica seedling selections and advanced generation screening will be accomplished with multiple location trialing over years. Continued breeding and selection of enhanced pyrethrum levels (PyI, PyII compounds) in Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium disk florets will be coupled with increased flower number, synchronicity of flowering, annualization, winterhardiness, and stability of expression in multiple environments (greenhouse and fields in Minnesota vs. field trials in central Africa). The heritability of flower colors and patterns will commence. Molecular analyses of reed canarygrass and interspecific lilies will continue to answer questions of genetic variation and gene expression.\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? Breeding for novel traits in floriculture crops continued this year with the discovery of a new dwarf phenotype of interspecific Gladiolus xhybridus with a compact inflorescence. These will have use as a potted flowering plant for indoor or container uses. Commercial trials of USDA Z4 winterhardy &lsquo;Beatrice&rsquo; gladiolus continue with potential licensees. Eight selections of a new mini-flowered, intraspecific Phlox paniculata phenotype that are &frac12; the size of standard flower types (0.6&rdquo; vs. 1.25&rdquo; dia.) have potential uses for landscape gardens and as cut flowers. Breeding for winterhardy Iris domestica has expanded to include dwarf types with short flower scapes. Among the 378 elite seedlings of Iris domestica screened for new flower colors and patterns, new pure colors, bicolors, picotees, blush, striated, and alternating petal coloration were found across a wide range of yellows, oranges, reds, pinks, and purples. Flower color and pattern inheritance has commenced with 87 crosses producing 796 seeds for evaluation and backcrossing. Progeny of interspecific Lilium xformolongi were found from parents that were either homozygous recessive or homozygous dominant for VER1 and VER2 genes, controlling reflowering with or without vernalization, respectively&mdash;all of which will be useful for bulk segregant analysis. Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium (pyrethrum) genotypes have high levels of male fertility (grand mean=90.98% stainable pollen), cross compatibility (bulk pollinations), and varying levels of self incompatibility and pseudo-self compatibility. High levels of pyrethrum compounds, PyI and PyII, were found in disk florets our ornamental Chrysanthemum xhybridum MammothTM Yellow Quill, as well as Chinese-bred accessions of C. cinerarifolium. In our invasive species discoveries this year with drought tolerance and range expansion of Phalaris arundinacea, genotypes produced approximately equal numbers of reproductive tillers in both the wet and drought treatments. While significant genotypic differences were found for most phenotypic traits (crown area, total tillers, reproductive tillers, total biomass, above and belowground biomass, biomass ratios, specific leaf area), indicating that populations harbor a high level of genetic variation, significant moisture treatment effects were only found for some traits. Using a novel GC-MS detection method for amino acids in the drought stress treatment, three amino acids (proline, glycine, isoleucine) had significantly enhanced production. Local adaptation was not detected, but significant genetic variation in drought tolerance traits in the metapopulation suggest the capacity for adaptive evolution and an associated risk of spread to adjacent upland sites. To characterize growth in upland and wetland habitats, we conducted a 13-month field experiment of the unconstrained growth of P. arundinacea in upland and wetland conditions. A suite of traits was measured in genotypes collected from upland and wetland habitats. Although P. arundinacea most often occurs in wetlands, there was significantly higher growth and fecundity in the upland treatment. Genotypic responses differed for all traits and habitat of origin and its interaction with soil moisture was important for some traits. The significant genetic variation observed suggests that there is potential for local adaptation to upland habitats. The higher growth and fecundity in upland conditions highlights the need for additional research to investigate the establishment capacity and competitiveness in upland habitats.\n\nPublications\n\nType: Journal Articles Status: Accepted Year Published: 2014 Citation: Anderson, N.O. and P.

Four manuscripts are in preparation from this research. Four visiting faculty and research Chrysanthemum scientists are conducting breeding and selection experiments for cold-tolerant garden and greenhouse chrysanthemums in South Korea and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. Drs. Dong-Chan Kim and Mi-Kyoung Won, The Chungcheongnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services (CNARES), Republic of Korea, are in the 2nd year of joint chrysanthemum breeding research with the program during 2013. Hybrid selections have been made in Minnesota trials for future testing/selection in South Korea. Crosses between American greenhouse and garden cut flower chrysanthemums were made for subsequent greenhouse trials to select new hybrids adapted to South Korean greenhouse production. Dr. Shen Man, Dept. of Plant Science &amp; Technology, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beijing, P.R. China, conducted research to identify unique proteins produced during cold acclimation of hardy and non-hardy Minnesota cut garden chrysanthemum cultivars. Dr. He Miao, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, P.R. China, focuses her research on tissue culture and cytogenetics of fragrant Chrysanthemum indicum var. auranticum. Dr. Robert Suranyi, McLaughlin Gormley King Company, Minneapolis, MN works with us in the pyrethrum breeding program. Mike Nelson, Ph.D. Candidate, Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program, continued his reed canarygrass research, published two manuscripts, submitted an additional one for publication and is concluding his final two papers for a 2015 dissertation defense. Dr. Carrie Eberle, a recent graduate, is now working for the USDA in Morris, MN; two papers from her dissertation were published in 2013. David Munter, a M.S. student in Applied Plant Sciences and co-advised with Dr. J. Luby, conducted one year of reproductive biology and intraspecific and intergeneric crossing studies in Prickly Ash, Zanthoxylum americanum. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest? Results have been widely distributed in a variety of mid- to high-impact journals (scientific publications), through abstracts for poster/oral presentations at national and international scientific meetings, with talks at grower and industry conferences, talks for Master Gardeners and press releases/radio talks/TV spotlights. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? In 2014, continued molecular genetics and classical breeding experiments and directed selection will be conducted within Phalaris, Chrysanthemum xgrandiflorum, Chrysanthemum cinerarifolium, Gladiolus x hybridus, Lilium spp., Iris domestica, and Gaura spp. to produce enhanced germplasm with enhanced adaptation to northern latitudes (particularly winter hardiness, drought/heat tolerance) and reduce invasive potential of ornamental crops.\n\nImpacts\n\nWhat was accomplished under these goals? Invasive species research discoveries included the first-ever molecular (ISSR markers) genetic differentiation between cultivated and wild populations of Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) along rivers in the Czech Republic. Simulated data sets from Phalaris were used to determine the number of dominant marker loci needed to obtain satisfactory results when using ISSRs and/or AFLPs from two population genetic analyses: STRUCTURE and AMOVA. AMOVA provided accurate results with a modest quantity of markers (30) while STRUCTURE required a greater number (90-200), especially when populations were closely related. The &Delta;K method correctly determined the number of genetically distinct groups when sampling was balanced, but underestimated with unbalanced sampling. A protocol and the programming scripts were developed for determining the number of markers needed for future dominant marker studies. The level of genetic variation in Phalaris from Midwestern wetland and upland sites for drought tolerance was significant for most phenotypic and biochemical traits, indicating that populations harbor a high level of genetic variation. Significant moisture treatment effects were only found for some traits. Local adaptation was not detected, but significant genetic variation in drought tolerance in the metapopulation suggest the capacity for adaptive evolution and an associated risk of spread to adjacent upland sites. Breeding for novel, greenhouse cut flower chrysanthemum cultivars in South Korea discovered at least one heat tolerance genotype from the garden chrysanthemum breeding program. Ten chrysanthemum genotypes were screened for heat tolerance (20/15C and 30/25C day/night temperatures) under inductive (short day) and non-inductive (long-day) photoperiods. Ten (100%) initiated and developed flower buds in short days at 30/25C whereas 60% did so at 20/15C; 60% did so in long days at 20/15C, but only 10% at 30/25C. Thermal stability was variable between genotypes with relative injury scores being highest in the high temperature. Pyrethrum breeding discoveries included screening select accessions of seed-propagated Leucanthemum, Chrysanthemum xgrandiflorum (garden types), and Calendula for Pyrethrin (Py) production; none was produced. Chrysanthemum cinerarifolium seed lots differed significantly for visible bud date, flowering date, stem height, inflorescence height, no. of vegetative shoots, no. of flowering shoots, no. of ray petals/flower, flower diameter, disc diameter, mean petal length, 1st flower dry weight (DW), 2nd flower DW, 3rd flower DW, 4th flower DW, 5th flower fresh weight (FW) and DW, 10th flower DW, 1st flower %Py, 3rd flower %Py, and 7th flower %Py. Seed germination week proved to be an early selection tool (significant for visible bud and flowering dates only) and has little interaction with seed lots, allowing it to be a powerful flowering selection tool regardless of germplasm source(s). On average, it takes 34 to 39.4 weeks to reach visible bud date and an additional 3-4 wks to flower. This time period is significantly longer than cultivated chrysanthemums take from seed (16+ wks). While flower fresh weights varied widely, dry weights were remarkably similar for the 1st through 10th flowers (0.09 &ndash; 0.12 g/flower) for all seed lots and then decreasing slightly to 0.06 g/flower for the 11th and 12th flowers. Winter survival of pyrethrum in USDA Z4 was 340/4080 (8.3%) and varied widely between populations. Winter-hardy forms were analyzed for Py content and rooting potential. Zanthoxylum americanum, Prickly ash, a dioecious species native to Minnesota was forcible to flowering in 20 days during the dormant winter period with the use of floral preservatives. Male plants produced viable pollen and, occasionally, fruit. Prickly ash is apomictic and parthenocarpic (stenospermocarpic).\n\nPublications\n\nType: Journal Articles Status: Published Year Published: 2013 Citation: Anderson, N.O., E. Berghauer, D. Harris, K.

This garden and cut flower cultivar sports ruffled pink and white flowers with yellow throats. Corms of Beatrice do not have to be dug in the fall and will overwinter to produce large clumps of flowering stalks throughout the growing season. New hybrid gladiolus selections, for potential market release for a new series of hardy glads, are in extensive statewide and national trials to determine performance. Twenty new hybrid selections were made for potential release as landscape, garden chrysanthemums for the South Korean market. Breeding for novel, greenhouse cut flower chrysanthemum cultivars in South Korea was also initiated. Chrysanthemum cinerarifolium (pyrethrum) breeding research discovered very low seed germination/yield potential (18-38%) and flowering (6-66.1%) in wild and cultivated lines (141,120 genotypes). In reproductive biology research, a class III pistil-specific extensin-like protein (PELPIII) is an interspecific incompatibility protein responsible for pollen tube inhibition in transmitting tract-ablated Nicotiana tabacum x N. obtusifolia crosses. Reproductive biology and floral anatomical studies of Minnesota native prickly ash are underway with the long-term goal of creating winter-hardy, intergeneric hybrids with citrus. Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) techniques (elliptical, sharp and soft outlines) were developed to aerially measure invasive reed canarygrass growth in field and wetland conditions. Soft outline KAP aerial measurements of plant growth were faster to perform and statistically similar to sharp outline measurements conducted on the ground which will enable researchers to accurately measure plant growth in challenging field conditions. Invasive species research continued with the first year of dry matter accumulation and plant growth measurements of Czech cultivars and river populations of reed canarygrass in Trebon. Molecular genetic research to study invasive traits and conduct risk assessment of invasive Phalaris focused on an extensive collection in Minnesota for comparative assays with our previously collected riparian populations in the Czech Republic. Phalaris samples were collected from six rivers in Minnesota, sampling populations at sites 30 km apart. Four rivers (St. Croix, Mississippi, Minnesota, Des Moines) empty into the Gulf basin while two (Red River of the North, Roseau) feed into Lake Winnipeg / Hudson Bay watershed. At each sampling site, at least five locations along the river edges (100 m apart) were sampled (76 populations total; 863 genotypes) as well as perpendicular transects (412 genotypes) to determine whether the genetic variation along the rivers was the same or different from the populations extending back from the waters edge. Six transects of three major wet meadows and cultivated fields (166 genotypes) and 13 herbaria specimens (1800s) plus 62 genotypes from the same locations were also collected. DNA has been extracted and molecular genetic analyses are proceeding. PARTICIPANTS: Drs. Pavel Travnicek, Institute of Botany (Academy of Sciences, Pruhonice, Czech Republic) and Barbora Kubatova, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant Production, Jihoceska Univerzita (University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) both participated in the collection of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) and Leucanthemum samples throughout Minnesota lakes for the determination of cytogenetic differences between Minnesota (USA) and European species. Drs. Jan Kvet, Dasa Bastlova, Vladislav Curn, Keith Edwards, Hana Cizkova and Barbora Kubatova, affiliated with the Faculties of Science & Agriculture, Departments of Ecosystems Biology, Plant Production & Plant Physiology, Jihoceska Univerzita (University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) and the Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences, Trebon, Czech Republic, all aided in the growth analyses of the Czech reed canarygrass populations, as well as the collection, DNA extraction and molecular analyses of comparative Minnesota reed canarygrass populations. Two manuscripts are in preparation from this research. Fang Du, a visiting scholar from the College of Agriculture & Biotechnology, Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, P.R. China) published one manuscript on bulb tissue cold-tolerance in Lilium longiflorum Nellie White and L. formosanum. Four visiting scholars and research Chrysanthemum scientists are conducting breeding and selection experiments for cold-tolerant garden and greenhouse chrysanthemums in South Korea and the Peoples Republic of China. Drs. Dong-Chan Kim and Mi-Kyoung Won, The Chungcheongnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services (CNARES), Republic of Korea, are in the 2nd year of joint chrysanthemum breeding research with the program during 2012-2013. Hybrid selections have been made in Minnesota trials for future testing/selection in South Korea. Crosses between American greenhouse and garden cut flower chrysanthemums were made for subsequent greenhouse trials to select new hybrids adapted to South Korean greenhouse production. Dr. Shen Man, Dept. of Plant Science & Technology, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beijing, P.R. China, is conducting research to identify unique proteins produced during cold acclimation of hardy and non-hardy Minnesota cut garden chrysanthemum cultivars. Dr. He Miao, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, P.R. China, focuses her research on gene silencing in chrysanthemum. Dr. Robert Suranyi, McLaughlin Gormley King Company, Minneapolis, MN works with us in the pyrethrum breeding program. Mike Nelson, Ph.D. Candidate, Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program, continued his reed canarygrass research, wrote two manuscripts, and is concluding additional studies in 2013. Dr. Carrie Eberle completed her Ph.D. in 2013 and was a Post-doctoral Research Associate in the laboratory. She submitted her final dissertation paper on PELPIII for publication. David Munter, a M.S. student in Applied Plant Sciences and co-advised with Dr. J. Luby, is pursuing reproductive biology and intraspecific and Intergeneric crossing studies in Prickly Ash, Zanthoxylum americanum. TARGET AUDIENCES: The following are target audiences for this project: floriculture breeders, geneticists, producers, distributors, brokers, growers, and retailers (particularly in chrysanthemum, gladiolus, lily, and gaura crops) in both the public and private sectors; plant ecologists working with risk assessment and invasion biology; plant physiologists working with cold and stress tolerance; extension specialists working with ornamental, flowering horticultural crops; public gardens and arboreta; landscape designers and architects; the gardening public, particularly Master Gardeners and Junior Master Gardeners. PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Not relevant to this project.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe University of Minnesota Herbaceous Perennial Breeding Program is recognized as one of the premiere public-sector flower breeding project programs in the world. Our creation of new chrysanthemum plant habits (from large shrubs to groundcover types), discovery and breeding of reflowering, non-vernalization requiring lilies, release of USDA Z4 winter-hardy gladiolus, and cold-tolerant gaura are example research efforts enabling the generation of revitalized floricultural crops for the 21st century. The new shrub chrysanthemums resulted in increased U.S. chrysanthemum sales from $104.8M (wholesale) in 2001 (when the first shrub type was released) to $113.8M (wholesale) in 2011, helping make mums the No. 1 herbaceous perennial in U.S. sales. Shrub types also prompted growers to sell traditional cushion cultivars in larger containers to mimic shrub types. Winter hardy gladioli would not require digging the corms in the fall for overwintering; multiple flowering stems on each plant would increase cut stem yields. Our advancements in lily breeding have resulted in the creation of colored, seed-propagated hybrids for continued development and domestication. Lilies which flower less than 1 yr. from seed and continuously flower thereafter will significantly alter production and use of this crop as a cut flower, flowering potted plant, and garden perennial. Cut flower growers could harvest multiple stems/plant (rather than the standard 1/bulb) continuously throughout the growing season (field) or in greenhouses year round, rather than having to purchase and force a new crop of bulbs for each harvest. Flowering potted lilies would become dual-use products, enjoyed indoors for a holiday and then reflowered either indoors or outdoors for the growing season. As garden perennials, such lilies would allow for flowering throughout the season rather than just for 1-month. Focus on preventing the creation of invasive ornamental floriculture crops prior to their release onto the market has led to research on contributing factors within the horticultural distribution channel, risk assessment, as well as plant traits to select against during domestication. Reed canarygrass, an ornamental herbaceous perennial, is being used as a model plant in which to study these factors. Continual incorporation of new traits, such as non-invasiveness and drought/heat tolerance will enable continued growth of the floriculture sector with readily adaptable germplasm. Testing for invasive potential of ornamental crops, prior to market release, must involve genotype-specific testing in multiple sites and locations over years, similar to the methodology used to assess winter hardiness. While costly, the long-term gains in preventing horticultural crop invasions are greater than selling non-winter hardy perennials.\n\nPublications\n\nAnderson N.O., E. Gesick, and P.D. Ascher. 2012.

American (Minnesota, Midwest, forage/ornamental cultivars) populations (2010). Phalaris samples were collected from six rivers in the Czech Republic, sampling populations at sites every 30 km along each river, including above and below confluences. Five rivers (Berounka, Labe, Luznice, Orlice, Vltava) empty into the North Sea basin while one (Dyje River) feeds into the Black Sea basin. At each sampling site (population), at least five locations along the river edges (100 m apart) were sampled (30 populations total; 465 genotypes) as well as perpendicular transects (n=38; 370 genotypes) to determine whether the genetic variation along the rivers was the same or different from the populations extending back from the waters edge. One forage cultivar and three ornamentals were also included. Molecular genetic variation, using inter-simple sequence repeat fragments (ISSRs) of nuclear DNA in 835 Czech genotypes comprised 21 polymorphic loci (3 primers). Most genetic variation was between genotypes within populations, rather than among populations within rivers or between rivers, similar to our N. American reed canarygrass findings. No evidence for clonal spread of reed canarygrass along the river edges or the transects were found. The distribution of genetic variation between Czech rivers overlapped significantly. Comparative analysis of the 372 Minnesota and other Midwestern Phalaris genotypes (2010 results) with the Czech populations for specific loci also showed significant overlap and little genetic differentiation. A theory for this common genetic background between Minnesota, the Midwest and the Czech Republic reed canarygrass is that forage cultivars produced in Roseau, MN and sold in Europe may serve as conduits for invasiveness since the cultivars male parents are unknown and the grass is wind pollinated. In lily breeding, the recombinant, interspecific L. xformolongi x L. martagon hybrids were backcrossed and full sib mated to determine whether the recombinant traits segregated. Six additional interspecific gladiolus hybrids were identified to be USDA Z4 winter-hardy. In some hybrids, only the small, non-flowering and juvenile cormels overwintered which is less desirable than those genotypes with a surviving, mature corm. PARTICIPANTS: Drs. Jan Kvet, Dasa Bastlova, Vladislav Curn, Keith Edwards, Hana Cizkova and Barbora Kubatova, affiliated with the Faculties of Science & Agriculture, Departments of Ecosystems Biology, Plant Production & Plant Physiology, Jihoceska Univerzita (University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic) and the Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences, Trebon, Czech Republic, all aided in the collection and molecular analyses of the Czech reed canarygrass populations. One manuscript is in preparation from this research. Dr. Adnan Younis, Assistant Professor of Floriculture, Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, conducted the molecular genetic (ISSR) studies on Gladiolus hybrids and species for studying winter hardiness, which led to 1 publication in 2011. Silvina Soto, a Visiting Scholar from the Instituto de Floricultura (INTA), Buenos Aires, Argentina, continues characterization of self incompatibility of wild Calibrachoa species from Argentina. This germplasm may also be an important new source of resistance or tolerance to powdery mildew in this crop. Dr. Dong-Chan Kim, The Chungcheongnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services (CNARES), Republic of Korea, is conducting a joint chrysanthemum breeding research with the program during 2011-2013. Crosses between Minnesota and Korean germplasm were made for subsequent field trials, along with analysis of Korean cultivars for Minnesota adaptability. Dr. Jennifer Drew wrote a manuscript for submission on intellectual property aspects of horticultural crops, including chrysanthemum. Mike Nelson, Ph.D. Candidate, Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program, continued his reed canarygrass research, including writing a manuscript on N. American molecular genetic analyses. His current research includes greenhouse and field experiments on drought tolerance evolution to formulate risk assessment models. Carrie Eberles pollen tube growth assay manuscript was published in 2011; she is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program.

This has resulted in an increased and sophisticated consumer demand with an aggressive collection of new crops, most of which are introduced into the market without risk assessment or sufficient testing for invasive tendencies. Traditional approaches to invasive horticultural crop control (regulation, self-regulation), which target players in the distribution channel before and/or after cultivar release, have had limited effectiveness and buy-in because these approaches do not address the industry's complexities and economic incentives. Involvement and education of consumers may provide better oversight by addressing the moral hazard problem while acknowledging the key industry characteristics. U.S./European reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) is being used as a model plant to study invasive traits and conduct risk assessment. Molecular genetic variation, using inter-simple sequence repeat fragments (ISSRs) of nuclear DNA in 372 reed canarygrass genotypes (wild MN, NE, WI populations; forage, ornamental cultivars), comprised 32 polymorphic loci (3-5 primers). Most genetic variation was between individuals within (81%) rather than among populations (17%) or regions (2%). There was low population divergence with a high degree of genetic variation. Geographically close populations failed to cluster together, despite wind pollination. Human-mediated gene flow could explain the observed pattern of genetic diversity. In lily breeding, among the 37 rosetted 07L-14 F1s from the cross L. xformolongi (00L-111-343 x 51-202-1) x L. martagon Cadense, six (16.2%) had morphology deviating significantly from the parents and all other obligate or non-obligate vernalization-requiring siblings. A comparative but closer cross, L. regale x L. xformolongi Augusta F1 SD(5) (=06L-11) showed similar morphology. Among the 37 rosetted 07L-14 F1s, six (16.2%) and one 06L-11 hybrid (1/48, 2.1%) had morphology deviating significantly from the parents and all other non-rosetted full-sibs. All of these hybrids had long, thin linear leaves, which were nearly whorled on the main stem axis, significantly higher leaf counts and l:w ratios than the parents. The leaf phenotype and phyllotaxy resembled Nicotiana sylvestris lam-1 and Oryza sativa narrow leaf1 (nal1) mutants. Three genotypes were apetalous and sterile while 3 07L-14 and one 06L-11 flowered with low fertility. Notably, however, the number of tepals and petals equaled two each, making the total corolla count 4 (rather than 3+3=6 in monocots and the Liliaceae); there were also 4 anthers (instead of 6). All such recombinants had deep golden throat color and open-faced flowers similar to Oriental types, rather than either parents (trumpet or Turk's cap). Since L. xformolongi was the female in one cross (07L-14) but male in the other (06L-11), these recombinant phenotypes are not maternal effects. PARTICIPANTS: Dr. Adnan Younis, Assistant Professor of Floriculture, Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, conducted the molecular genetic (ISSR) studies on clonal populations of Lilium longiflorum Nellie White and L. xformolongi x L. martagon interspecific hybrids, which led to 2 publications and 1 abstract in 2010. Fang Du, Assistant Professor, College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agriculture University, Taigu, Shanxi, Peoples Republic of China, is submitting a manuscript on cold tolerance of Lilium longiflorum and L. formosanum bulbs, based on her 1-year Visiting Scientist position in the lab. Silvina Soto, a Visiting Scholar from the Instituto de Floricultura (INTA), Buenos Aires, Argentina, continues characterization of self incompatibility of wild Calibrachoa species from Argentina. This germplasm may also be an important new source of resistance or tolerance to powdery mildew in this crop. Dr. Dong-Chan Kim, The Chungcheongnam-do Agricultural Research and Extension Services (CNARES), Republic of Korea, will be conducting joint chrysanthemum breeding research with the program during 2011-2013, to secure a diversity of gene sources for and breeding of landscape garden chrysanthemums (Chrysanthemum xgrandiflorum, C. xhybridum). Dr. Jennifer Drew finished her Ph.D. in 2010. One publication on the horticultural distribution channel has been published in 2010. She is now writing 3 additional manuscripts on intellectual property aspects of horticultural crops, including chrysanthemum. Alex Plattes completed his UROP grant on \"Reciprocal crossing and morphological variability of interspecific ((Lilium xformolongi) x L. rubellum) and (L. xformolongi) x L. martagon hybrids\" in 2010. He was an author on 1 publication in 2010; hybrids created in his research will aid in the continuing objective to create colored, seed-propagated lilies that flower in <1 year. Mike Nelson, Ph.D. Candidate, Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program, has conducted the reed canarygrass molecular genetic analyses. His dissertation focuses on risk assessment and the evolution of drought-tolerant forms of this species in the Midwest. Carrie Eberle, Ph.D. Candidate, Plant Biological Sciences Graduate Program has developed a pollen tube growth assay (PTGA) that supports normal in vivo pollen tube growth rates and morphology while allowing manipulation of the growth environment and evaluation of factors on pollen tube growth; created an ablated pollination assay as a tool for pollen tube growth manipulation; isolated factors from the N. tabacum transmitting tract extra-cellular matrix and used the ablated pollination assay to show inhibition of interspecific incompatible pollen tube growth in the ablated style by the isolated factors. She has 1 manuscript in preparation.

We are soliciting for potential licensees for the groundcover chrysanthemums; at least one major propagator/distributor is interested in picking up these lines. Additionally, the MammothTM mum series is being carried by Burpee Seed Company and will be entered into 2010 trials by Ball Colegrave in the United Kingdom. Nuclear DNA inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers have been used to demarcate hybridity in interspecific [Lilium xformosanum x L. martagon] hybrids, N. American populations of invasive Phalaris arundinacea, and interspecific Gladiolus hybrids. Reciprocal interspecific crosses between L. xformolongi and 7-colored L. martagon generated 8,826 segregating hybrid F1 seeds and inbred (F2) progenies. Embryo rescue was employed when L. martagon was the female, although viable embryos never germinated after ~1 yr. in culture. Mean germination ranged from 0% - 1.02% for in situ ripened seed. Hybridity for one successful cross (07L-14; L. xformolongi [00L-111-343 x 51-202-1] x L. martagon Cadense) was analyzed using morphological (flowering, leaf & internode number, leaf length:width ratios, compatibility, no. flower stalks & flowers, rosetting) and molecular markers (ISSR primers). Twenty-two 07L-14 genotypes were genetically similar to the female parent whereas 86 aligned closely with the male (Cadense). The number of shoots/plant was the only quantitative trait co-segregating with ISSRs. Flowering traits were intermediate to, but significantly different than, either parent. A majority of the plant height and inflorescence lengths were significantly greater than the parents. Two F1s had slight flower coloration in the petals and tepals; one hybrid had an open-faced rather than trumpet flower (similar to an Oriental type). ISSRs (using 2 polymorphic primers) conducted on 100 reed canarygrass (P. arundinacea) genotypes collected across the Midwestern US indicate that most forage cultivars are distinct from wild, invasive populations. Beatrice, our Z3 winter-hardy gladiolus (slated for potential release in 2-3 years), an open-pollinated seedling, is closely related to Gladiolus dahlenii and G. byzantinus based on ISSR markers. PARTICIPANTS: Dr. Adnan Younis, Assistant Professor of Floriculture, Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan, completed his 1-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship. His funding is from the Higher Education Commission of the Government of Pakistan (Roll No. 220058; Ref. 2-2/PDFP/HEC/2007/4). Adnan conducted molecular genetic (ISSR variation) studies on clonal populations of Lilium longiflorum Nellie White, L. xformolongi x L. martagon interspecific hybrids, hardy/non-hardy Gladiolus, and seed-propagated, non-vernalization requiring VER1/VER2 Lilium xformolongi hybrids. To date, two manuscripts have resulted from this work (1 published; the other is under review); 2 others are under preparation. Fang Du, Lecturer, College of Horticulture, Shanxi Agriculture University, Taigu, Shanxi, Peoples Republic of China, also completed her 1-year Visiting Scientist position in my lab. Her research endeavor was funded by the Shanxi Scholarship Council of China. Fang is preparing a manuscript on her work with cold tolerance and its effect on lily bulb tissues. Silvina Soto, a Visting Scholar from the Instituto de Floricultura (INTA), Buenos Aires, Argentina, conducted reproductive biology and interspecific hybridization studies with wild Calibrachoa species collected in Argentina. After her return to Argentina, she continues characterization of self incompatibility in these Calibrachoa species. Alex Plattes, an undergraduate student who received a UROP grant for Reciprocal crossing and morphological variability of interspecific [Lilium xformolongi] x L. rubellum and [L. xformolongi] x L. martagon hybrids is working in my lab during 2009-2010. His research continues our objective to obtain colored flowers in our seed-propagated, reflowering lily hybrids. TARGET AUDIENCES: The following are target audiences for this project: floriculture breeders, geneticists, producers, distributors, brokers, growers, and retailers (particularly in chrysanthemum, gladiolus, lily, and gaura crops) in both the public and private sectors; plant physiologists working with cold and stress tolerance; extension specialists working with ornamental, flowering horticultural crops; public gardens and arboreta; landscape designers and architects; the gardening public, particularly Master Gardeners and Junior Master Gardeners PROJECT MODIFICATIONS: Not relevant to this project.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe University of Minnesota chrysanthemum breeding program is recognized as one of the premiere public-sector flower breeding project chrysanthemum programs in the world. Our creation of new chrysanthemum plant habits (from large shrubs to groundcover types), discovery and breeding of reflowering, non-vernalization requiring lilies, breeding and selection of USDA Z3-4 winter-hardy gladiolus, and release of a new, cold-tolerant gaura (Gaura lindheimeri Snowstorm) are example research efforts enabling the continuous generation of revitalized floricultural crops for the 21st century. Continual incorporation of new traits, such as non-invasiveness and drought/heat tolerance will enable continued growth of the floriculture sector with readily adaptable germplasm.\n\nPublications\n\nAnderson, N.O. 2009.
