        "text": "Article by Dean Ravenscroft, Ph.D. - Updated 25th Oct 2023\n\nIn this Gardener's HQ guide, we'll explore cultivating Zantedeschia plants in your garden, indoor spaces, and other settings.\n\nArum Lily, Calla Lily, Lily of the Nile, & Varkoor: Cultivation & Garden Use\n\nZantedeschia are beautiful plants that are usually grown as an annual in the garden though they are really half hardy perennials.\n\nZantedeschia range in height from 30 cm to 2.5 m and have large arrow shaped leaves.\n\nThey bloom in the early summer when they carry exquisite funnel flowers consisting of white, pink, yellow or red petals surrounding a spadix that can be purple, white or yellow.\n\nSome of the common varieties of Zantedeschia that are grown in the garden include Arum Lily, White arum lily, Lily of the Nile and Calla Lily.\n\nLatin names of these plants include Zantedeschia aethiopica; Zantedeschia calla; Zantedeschia elliottiana; and Zantedeschia rehmannii.\n\nAntedeschia aethiopica - Calla lily by Warrenski; Creative Commons.\n\nHow to Grow Zantedeschia, Arum lilies\n\nZantedeschia species such as Arum lilies and Calla lily can be grown from rhizome of seeds; plant zantedeschia bulbs at about 5 cm (2 inches) deep and 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 inches) apart.\n\nIf growing Arum lilies from seed, then it is best to start off indoors.\n\nFirst soak the lily seeds for a day in warm water, then sow on the soil surface at the start of spring.\n\nIt will take about one to three months for Arum lilies to germinate at a temperature of 21 to 28 degrees centigrade (70 to 82Â°F) in the light.\n\nOnce ready, transplant the young Arum Lily seedlings in the spring, well after the last chance of frost.\n\nIdeally the soil that plants grow in will be acidic, humus rich, and enriched with manure.\n\nCalla Lily by Cygnus921; Creative Commons.\n\nCaring for Zantedeschia Plants\n\nIt is easy to look after Zantedeschia species such as Arum lily and Lilies of the Nile.\n\nThey require regular watering to keep the soil moist, and as they are quite hungry they should be fed regularly with a liquid fertilizer during their growing period.\n\nIf you require more plants then propagate Arum lilies by division of the tubers in the spring.\n\nCommon Questions\n\nHow many members does the Zantedeschia genus have?\n\nThe Zantedeschia genus contains eight species known for their elegant, trumpet-shaped flowers commonly referred to as Calla Lilies.\n\nDo members of Zantedeschia make a good garden or landscaping plant?\n\nYes, Zantedeschia species, or Calla Lilies, are popular in gardens for their striking flowers. They also make excellent cut flowers.\n\nWhich Zantedeschia species are most frequently grown by gardeners?\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica, known as the Arum Lily, is frequently grown by gardeners due to its stunning white flowers.\n\nAre members of the Zantedeschia plant genus fragrant?\n\nSome species of Zantedeschia, particularly Zantedeschia aethiopica, are known for their mild, pleasing fragrance.\n\nWhat is the perfect location to grow Zantedeschia?\n\nZantedeschia grows best in a sunny to lightly shaded location with well-drained soil that is kept moist during the growing season.\n\nIs Zantedeschia invasive in the USA, if so in which states?\n\nCurrently, Zantedeschia aethiopica is considered invasive in some parts of California and the southeast US. Always check local regulations.\n\nHow do I remove Zantedeschia plants from my garden?\n\nRemoving Zantedeschia involves digging up the plant's rhizomes, making sure all parts are removed to prevent regrowth.\n\nSummary\n\nZantedeschia, commonly known as Calla Lily, belongs to the family Araceae. This genus comprises about 8 species of perennial herbaceous flowering plants native to southern Africa.\n\nZantedeschia plants prefer full sun to partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. They are typically grown from rhizomes, which should be planted in spring. The plants are celebrated for their elegant, trumpet-shaped flowers and arrow-shaped leaves."
