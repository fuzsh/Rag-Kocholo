        "text": "Yellow is definitely one of the favorite colors of the avid gardener. The color yellow is seen as a reflection of hope and energy, and yellow flowers are one of the most visible plants in nature. There are plenty of yellow perennial flowers for your garden, so how do you choose?\n\nWe have chosen an assortment of 20 yellow perennial flowers for your garden. Our selection encompasses a wide variety of plant needs, bloom times, heights, zones, and much more.\n\nThis means there is something here for everyone and every gardener. There are many other colors you can pair them with as well. Even black perennial flowers exist, which can pair well with yellow perennials to give your garden some extra “pop.” Let’s jump in and take a look at our favorite bright, sunny yellow perennial flowers for your home or garden space!.\n\nHow to Make Yellow Perennial Flowers Work\n\nMany gardeners find the color yellow challenging to work with. For this reason, some gardeners refuse to work with it altogether. Sure, yellow can be an overwhelming color when not used in the right way. But in small doses, it can be brilliant, so don’t let anyone put you off. Yellow is the most luminous color in the light spectrum, meaning that yellow flowers provide a source of brightness even on the dullest of days.\n\nIt’s important to know that there are two shades of yellow in the flower world, and these are cool and warm. Cool yellow flowers are either pure yellow or slightly green in color. And warm yellow flowers are hues that are either tinted with red or are richer in color.\n\nThere are four ways to make the color yellow work in your garden:\n\nSprinkle yellow flowers sparingly around the garden, either in beds or pots\n\nPlant yellow-colored ribbons throughout your beds using one flower or one shade of yellow\n\nUsing color theory, pair with opposite-colored flowers, such as purple, to make them both pop\n\nUse herbaceous perennials to brighten dark areas or to create focal points\n\nJust like perennial vegetables, flowering perennials return year after year. Meaning that once they are established, you don’t need to spend as much time on them compared to annuals that need replanting. Some perennials are super hardy and require little protection during the winter months. Whereas some are more delicate, and these are called tender perennials. Perennials tend to pile their energy into a shorter blooming time too. Which often means fantastic shows of color.\n\nList of Popular Yellow Perennial Flowers\n\nNow that you know how to make the color yellow work in your garden let’s look at our favorite yellow perennial flowers. Keep in mind that many of these flowers are not one-size-fits-all applications and will flourish better at certain times of year and in certain climates. Looking for annuals too? We have a comprehensive list of yellow flowers that includes both annuals and perennials.\n\nAmerican Gold Rush\n\nScientific Name: Rudbeckia\n\nThe common name is Black-Eyed Susan, and it’s easy to see why it’s earned that description.

This rose looks spectacular when placed next to light blue flowers such as lavender or campanula.\n\nThe Graham Thomas Rose is a rebloomer, lasting from spring to the first frosts. Combining this with the fact that it is relatively easy to care for means it is a rewarding perennial to give space to in your garden.

It has dark green foliage with narrow leaves, allowing the flower to be the star of the show.\n\nThe Yellow Coneflower is best known for its long-lasting blooms and tolerance of almost everything. This flower does best in zones 5 to 9, and it craves exposure to full sun. When planted in mass, they attract pollinators and hummingbirds. The cones provide seeds for birds when they dry out too.

It is a relatively new strain of Ox-Eye. The daisy-like flowers are bright golden in color and are making a comeback thanks to the bold color trend hitting gardens across the country.
