        "text": "Embodiment:\n\nBelow in conjunction with embodiment, the present invention is further illustrated, but do not constitute limiting the scope of the invention.\n\nThe chemical reagent that embodiment adopts is the commercially available prod, and microscope is that multiplication factor can reach 100 times light microscope.\n\nLactophenol acid fuchsin solution formula belongs to the existing conventional prescription, and lactophenol acid fuchsin solution formula is: 20g phenol+20ml 90% lactic acid+40ml 98% glycerine+20ml water+80mg acid fuchsin.\n\nThe pinkish red prescription of its dyeing liquor of improvement phenol is: stoste A: get in the alcohol that the 3g basic fuchsin is dissolved in 100ml 70% (but long preservation); Stoste B: get A liquid 10ml and add 90ml 5% phenol (the being carbolic acid) aqueous solution (using in 2 weeks); Stoste C: get the formaldehyde (but long preservation) that B liquid 55ml adds 6ml glacial acetic acid and 6ml 38%; Dyeing liquor: get C liquid 10-20ml, add acetic acid and the 1.5g sorbierite of 80ï½90ml 45%, place the back use of two weeks.\n\n(1) for the examination material\n\nMale parent is: chrysanthemum common calla (coloured Zantedechia' Black magic '), female parent is: safflower common calla (coloured Zantedechia' Pink persuasion '), be commercial liploid variety of cultivating, the plant that blooms that is for experiment is available from the red brightness calla lily in Yunnan company, i.e. and hybrid combination is Pink persuasion * Black magic.\n\nThe chrysanthemum common calla ' feature of Black magic ': blade halberd shape, bright green, full edge, blade has translucent white dot; The spadix foresythia stands on Buddhist flame central authorities; The spathe yellow, edge-smoothing, there is the black patch in the throat of its petal.\n\nThe safflower common calla ' feature of Pink persuasion ': blade halberd shape, bright green, full edge, blade has translucent white dot; Become yellow and punctation is arranged when spadix milky, maturation; Spathe top rose, base portion milky, edge undulate.\n\n(2) determine suitable developmental stage of 2n pollen induction\n\nGet and do male parent chrysanthemum common calla ' Black magic ' just extracts out from the leaf bar from petal, petal closes, be emerald green to petal extraction 20cmï½25cm, petal scatters slightly, the petal of the plant of yellow green different developmental phases is changed at petal position over half from bottom to up into, with its microsporocyte reduction division progress of microscopic examination, it is the suitable stage of 2n pollen induction during I that microsporocyte more than 50% enters early stage, and the morphological feature of record this plant this moment, described morphological feature is the spathose color of this plant, spadiceous color, the degree of packing of spathe and spadix parcel and the length that scape endures out.\n\n' Black magic ' more than 50% when microsporocyte enters the morphological feature of early stage during I is: spathe is emerald green to the chrysanthemum common calla, spadix is white, scape endures out 5cmï½8cm, in the field its plant is carried out the 2n pollen induction with the stage of this morphological feature of showing;\n\nWhen the little sporocyst of bud of having determined its plant by microscopic examination enters the period of I in early stage, the morphological feature that also will put down in writing its plant is to provide foundation for field experiment, the microsporocyte that passes through to be put down in writing in the field enters the morphological feature of I in early stage, can be easily described early stage I this plant is carried out inducing of 2n pollen because be impossible carry out the processing of 2n pollen induction in microscopic examination limit, limit in the field.\n\n(3) preparation of pending style\n\nTo the plant of described morphological feature with step (2) record, cooperate with middle finger gently to rub with right thumb to be wrapped in spadix spathe outward, scatter until spathe, expose spadix; Note not damaging bract and style.\n\n(4) colchicine is handled and is induced 2n pollen\n\nWhen outdoor temperature is 10 â-25 â, with absorbent cotton the spadix post of the described calla lily plant of step (3) is close to parcel, with mass fraction is inducing of 0.15% the colchicine three days enterprising behavior of absorbent cotton phases being added drop-wise to the parcel style, replenishing described colchicine in the time of inducing makes the cotton maintenance of parcel moistening, the 4th day, pluck absorbent cotton and remove colchicine 5 times residual with distilled water flushing with tweezers.\n\n(5) evaluation of 2n pollen\n\nWhen step (4) processing plant flower bud development maturation is overflowed pollen, operation routinely, get the film-making behind lactophenol acid fuchsin solution-dyed of this pollen, observe pollen grain size and photograph down at microscope (16 * 40 times), compare with untreated paternal plant pollen, observe the pollen grain size under the same visual field, the pollen grain diameter comparison of processing plant is a 2n pollen according to the pollen grain of the pollen grain diameter big 30%ï½70% of plant;\n\n(6) collection of 2n pollen\n\nHandled the back 7ï½10 days in colchicine, when the spadiceous stamen maturation of the calla lily of handling but before not going out pollen, its stamen is cut down, put into culture dish and place drier to treat that pollen maturation overflows.The sign of different cultivars stamen maturation is widely different, mainly be to judge by its change color, represent its maturation when becoming buff as chrysanthemum and safflower common calla stamen by milky, the sign of the stamen maturation of atropurpureus common calla then is to become atropurpureus by white.\n\n(7) sexual polyploidization hybridization\n\nRipe and partly excise with the male flower of blade of sterilizing when not going out pollen when stamen with the maternal plant style, and to the style column cap bagging of maternal plant, when the column cap projection justacrine mucus of maternal plant, the processing pollen that step (6) is collected is granted on the column cap of maternal plant, obviously expand until the plant ovary, and scape is removed bagging when down curved. the hybrid seed of gathering when treating seed maturity.\n\n(8) seed collection\n\nPollinating, fruit begins to expand gradually after 15 ~ 20 days.Seed maturity approximately needs about 80ï½90 days, last month control moisture, reducing moisture gradually waters to stopping, treat that plant leaf is withered and yellow, the pericarp jaundice and when showing slightly shrinkage hybrid seed ripe, the seed of gathering is sowed at medium and carries out axenic germination after placing under 4 â of conditions 60 days breaking dormancies of low temperature storage, and stored seeds all can be sprouted in two years, the tip of a root of adopting the axenic germination seedling carries out chromosome observation, identifies the filial generation ploidy.\n\nThe method of axenic germination is, the hybrid seed of disinfecting is cultivated in medium MS+6-BA 2.0mg/L+NAA0.1mg/L+sucrose 30g/L+agar 7g/L, under the illumination 2000lxï½3000lx, 18 âï½25 â conditions of temperature.\n\n(9) sexual triploid offspring identifies\n\n1. pore is identified\n\nThe calla lily that is taken at the plantation of the adjoining tree planted under the isometric growth condition and step (8) is educated the laggard promoting the circulation of qi of hybridization hole and is identified, the calla lily that tears the plantation of the blade lower epidermis of getting adjoining tree and step (8) is educated the blade lower epidermis film-making respectively after the hybridization, observe in the OLYMPUS microscopically then and measure pore opening, big 30%ï½70% Preliminary Identification index as the polyploid variation that increases is shone in the blade pore opening comparison that the calla lily of step (8) plantation is educated after the hybridization;\n\n2. chromosome is identified\n\nThe pore of learning from else's experience identifies pore opening comparison and adopts the pinkish red decoration method film-making of improvement phenol according to the tip of a root of big 30%ï½70% plant, examine under a microscope then and make a video recording, how much judge its ploidy with the chromosome number purpose, chromosome number increases to 48(2n=3x=48) plant be the calla lily triploid hydrid offspring that the inventive method obtained; Calla lily liploid plant chromosome is 32(2n=2x=32), show that above-mentioned colchicine is handled successfully to induce 2n pollen to produce and obtain the triploid hydrid offspring by sexual hybridization with normal oogamete."
