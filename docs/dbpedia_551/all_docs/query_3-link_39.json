        "text": "This introduction from California's famed Western Hills Nursery forms upright clumps composed of large, hastate, white-spotted leaves that, for us, reach 3' or taller when mature. We have not found this to grow as large as Zantedeschia 'White Giant'. In late spring, Zantedeschia 'Hercules' clumps are topped with 4' tall spikes ending in a large white chalice. Our plants are from the clone that has been grown for years at Strybing Arboretum.\n\nMaintenance:\n\nCalla lilies (Zantedeschia) are low maintenance. To keep them at their most attractive state, merely remove leaves and flowers as they fade. When grown in an area with alternating warm and cold spells in the winter, the lush growth produced by Zantedeschia aethiopica during a warm spell can be frozen by a cold spell; merely cut away the damaged foliage and they will soon put up new growth. They do not seem to be harmed by this interruption. The other commonly grown species remain dormant through the winter.\n\nGrowing Conditions:\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica is at its best when grown in a wet site. Indeed it will thrive grown in a pot submerged in water. Its performance in a drier location will be disappointing. Please note that this applies to this one species of calla lily, Zantedeschia aethiopica. The other commonly grown species:the yellow flowered Zantedeschia elliottiana, the white flowered, white speckled leafed Zantedeschia albomaculata and the pink flowered, Zantedeschia rehmannii will thrive in soils of medium moisture level. This also applies to the hybrids between these 3 species. All are winter hardy in zone 7 so the tubers can be left in the ground over winter.All want sun for at least half a day. It is best to remove spent flowers so seeds are not produced. Named cultivars could be swamped by inferior seedlings if the seed was allowed to drop and grow.\n\nNatural Impact:"
