        "text": "A protocol for in vitro propagation in flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus L.) has been developed. Shoot apices or nodal segments from aseptically grown seedings or shoot apices from adult trees were used as initial explants. Highest shoot multiplication rates were obtained when the explants were cultured for 30 days in liquid Rugini induction medium supplemented with BA followed by 30 days on solidified Rugini multiplication medium without growth regulators. Regenerated shoots were rooted on Heller medium containing auxins alone or in combination with BA. Rooting percentages up to 71% (juvenile material) or 50% (adult material) were obtained in the presence of NAA and BA, and were not improved by treating the basal end of the shoots with concentrated NAA solutions. Following conventional procedures, regenerated plants were transferred to soil with more than 80% success. Chemical names used: N-(phenylmethyl)-1H-purin-6-amine (BA); 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).\n\nIn order to conquest of ash seed dormancy, we used seeds of this species that were collected from Haftkhal region, northern Iran, during 2005, 2007 and 2008 years by Forest Seed Center of Khazar (FSCK). Seeds were sterilized with mercuric colorid 1% for 20 min, and using 70% ethanol for 30 sec. Then half of seeds put in Gibberellic acid 500 mg/l density, the other half of seeds put in sterile distilled water for 24 hours. Then each group of seeds cultured on MS and enrich - MS medium with Ascorbic acid, Casein hydrolisat and yeast each 100 mg/l and 5 mg/l activated charcoal. In general for each year seeds 6 treatments, for each treatment 5 replication and in each replication 6 ash seeds have been cultured. Analysis of variance is showing that storage period had an influence on germination index in %5 confidence limit. Also for plantlet length, germination index and vigour after that period had a difference in %1 confidence limit. In this study the most desirable period for seed stor..."
