        "text": "Zantedeschia is a plant that is simply beautiful. It bejewels itself with its most beautiful flowers in summer.\n\nZantedeschia facts sheet\n\nName – Zantedeschia aethiopica\n\nFamily – Araceae\n\nType – rhizome perennial\n\nHeight – 20 to 32 inches (50 to 80 cm)\n\nExposure – full sun, part sun\n\nSoil – rich, well drained\n\nFlowering – June to October outdoors\n\nAlso used as an indoor plant, it is quite easy to care for and blooms year after year outdoors and indoors. Follow our advice to produce magnificent zantedeschia:\n\nPlanting Zantedeschia\n\nZantedeschia bulbs are planted at the beginning of spring, around 1 ½ to 2 inches deep, from March to May.\n\nSpace bulbs around 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) apart, because zantedeschia has wide-reaching leaves and needs space.\n\nChoose a location that is in full sun but stays cool.\n\nDon’t plant in very dry soil, because zantedeschia requires cool, moist soil.\n\nWatering your Zantedeschia\n\nWatering outdoor zantedeschia\n\nYou can grow your Zantedeschia outdoors provided you observe a period of dormancy of at least 2 months within the year without watering a single drop.\n\nAfter the blooming, reduce the watering until the leaves turn yellow.\n\nWhen the leaves have withered, stop watering altogether.\n\nSlowly start watering again at least 2 months later.\n\nWater sparingly at the beginning and then more regularly once flowers have appeared, until the end of the blooming season.\n\nArum grows very well adjoining a body of water, which indicates how much it needs water.\n\nTake note, though, that the term used for this plant is semi-aquatic, because it does need a water-free period of at least 2 months, generally during summer.\n\nWatering indoor Zantedeschia\n\nYou can grow your Zantedeschia indoors, in pots, but again you must respect a period of dormancy of at least 2 months within the year without watering a single drop.\n\nAfter the blooming, reduce the watering until the leaves turn yellow.\n\nWhen the leaves have withered, stop watering altogether.\n\nSlowly start watering again at least 2 months later.\n\nPruning and caring for zantedeschia\n\nCut short just when the first frost spells hit.\n\nDo not cut before leaves have turned completely yellow, since this is the span of time when they are building up their nutrient reserves for the next blooming cycle.\n\nFor spectacular blooming, add special bulb plant fertilizer.\n\nProtecting Zantedeschia in winter\n\nZantedeschia is quite hardy even in cool winters.\n\nIn areas that are prone to cold winters, protect the rhizomes with a thick layer of mulch.\n\nThe mulch can either be a bed of dried leaves, hemp or flax straw, or ferns.\n\nSmart tip: transfer Zantedeschia indoors!\n\nBefore winter, dig a portion of the rhizome out and plant it in a pot in your house, and you’ll have Zantedeschia arums in winter!\n\nA video on caring for Zantedeschia\n\nPotted zantedeschia, how to care for it\n\nOnce the leaves are completely yellow, you can cut them to the shortest.\n\nRemove the bulb from its pot, cleaning the dirt off delicately.\n\nSet it for the winter in a cool spot where it doesn’t freeze.\n\nThis storage spot must also be very dry and dark, for example a small shoebox with a ventilation hole pierced in it.\n\nIn March, you can bring your bulb out and plant it again in new soil mix.\n\nStart watering again when the soil is dry and your arum will bear flowers again.\n\nYou can also stow the bulb or rhizome away without removing it from its pot, but the soil mix needs replacing every two years anyway.\n\nPropagating your Zantedeschia flower\n\nWhen provided with rich soil that is full of humus and sufficient sun and water, Zantedeschia tubers (roundish rhizomes) will multiply underground:\n\nIn the dormant phase, when the leaves have died back (a couple months after blooming), unearth these tubers.\n\nSpread them apart to cover more ground, about one to a foot (every 25 cm).\n\nDon’t bury them too deep: ensure the top of the tuber is just under the soil surface.\n\nProtect the rhizomes or tubers from the cold with a thick layer of plant mulch.\n\nThey’ll grow back in the following season and keep multiplying year after year.\n\nLearn more about Zantedeschia\n\nThis bulb perennial is native to South Africa, not from Ethiopia as its scientific name seems to imply.\n\nIt grows naturally in damp marshy areas that are drenched during the rainy season and dirt dry during winter.\n\nParticularly exotic, it is perfectly suited to wet areas like water bodies and ponds, and it’s also the perfect plant for your flower beds, edges or standalone spots."
