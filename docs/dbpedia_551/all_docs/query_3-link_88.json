        "text": "Zantedeschia, often known as Calla lilies, are popular exotic-looking plants that are native to South Africa. If you're new to gardening or would like to learn how to plant Zantedeschia, you've come to the right place! This handy guide includes everything you need to know about how to plant calla lily bulbs (Zantedeschia).\n\nHow to Plant Calla Lily Bulbs\n\nPlanting Zantedeschia is as easy as pie! You'll need moist, well-drained soil for calla lilies. They prefer to be planted closer to the surface. Where possible, plant them in a sunnier location. As a native of Africa, they will appreciate it!\n\nPlant the tubers shallow, so the top of the tubers are slightly exposed. Water freely and apply a balanced fertiliser every two weeks until the flowers have faded. Keep slightly moist in winter.\n\nEach tuber will produce several stems, perfect for creating cut flowers. Brighten up any room with a delightful bouquet or surprise your friends and family with a bunch of these stunning flowers.\n\nCalla Lilies can be lifted after flowering and stored throughout winter, allowing you to plant them again in spring. Simply dig them up once they have died back. The best time for this is usually in autumn, around the time the first frosts are beginning to set in. Dust off the soil for calla lilies and place them somewhere cool and dry on some old newspaper for several days to allow them to dry off. They can then be stored in a dark, dry area and a cool spot in some peat moss over the winter.\n\nOnce spring arrives again and the temperatures turn mild, you can replant your Calla Lilies for a gorgeous show throughout the season!\n\nCan You Leave Calla Lilies In the Ground?\n\nHardier Zantedeschia aethiopica and its varieties can be left in the ground over winter in most areas of the country. However, it's still recommended that you cover them with a thick layer of mulch where the roots are growing. The older the plant, the hardier it should be. Younger plants should always be given extra protection, wherever they're grown.\n\nWhen to Cut Back Calla Lilies\n\nWondering when to cut back calla lilies? Thankfully, this is an easy task. Spent blooms can be deadheaded, but leave the green leaves to die back naturally. This is important, as it allows the plant to soak up as many nutrients from the sun as it can, helping it grow impeccably the following year.\n\nHowever, once the foliage dies back, you can then cut them back. Ensure their leaves are browning, as this is a clear indicator that it's time to cut them back."
