I've seen others in my area that are 4 to 5 foot tall. Are there particular conditions they need to get this big?\n\nA few taxonomy related points to make.. the first is the picture posted in regard to the original plant shows an Arum Lily (Zathedeschia aethiopica), the plant referred to as Calla Lily is Victoria's photo (Zantedeschia rehmanii)\n\nArum Lilies grow big, I have put a picture below showing it is around 6 feet tall.. the only requirement to get plants this big is light frosts in winter, and humidity all year around - you might think that's logical to the point of state the obvious.. however when you look at the growth cycle of Zanteschia aethiopica, things get a little bit interesting. In its native South Africa, this plant endures a wet season, and a dry season, so therefore in much of its range is it seasonally deciduous/herbaceous. Therefore in these seasonally dictated areas, Arum lilies will never grow that big. However in the small but hard to find areas where they grow in water, or humid places that get adequate rainfall all year round.. they will stay evergreen and get big. What we see in the UK, where climate allows, is Zantdeschia getting huge because of adequate rainfall all year around.. interestingly that means this plant grows better here than it does in some of native range.\n\nMy Plant:\n\nI have both.\n\nThe arum lily hitchhiked across in a pot containing a hydrangea when I moved last year It's been blooming for the past week or two.\n\nMy calla lily was bought to be a yellow one, but is actually a purple one (still hasn't grown much this year - yet)\n\nI thought Calla Lily applied to the whole Zantedeshia Group... Indeed the first species on Google is aethiopica....\n\nThe plant in Victoria's picture isn't Z rehmanii ( which has narrow spear shaped plain green leaves and dull pink flowers), it is a hybrid, possibly 'picasso'.\n\nRef the size, I did wonder if it was s climate thing, but there are plenty of huge plants in the local area that are planted out permanently and are exposed to the same conditions as mine. I suspect that it either comes down to genetics or growing conditions.\n\nI have just ordered myself a Z Hercules, be interesting to see how this compares [emoji1]"
