        "text": "This white lily with large spathes is widely used as a cut flower. However, the plants of the Arum Lily will engulf gutters, streams, waterways and wetland bogs. It is now a widespread environmental weed. The green form called 'Green Goddess' is also invasive and can be found clogging up natural waterways.\n\nThough closely related to the Arum Lily, they are not regarded as invasive. Calla Lilies are available in a wonderful range of colours of pink, cream and burgundy to purple-black. With care in the selection of growing position and cultivation, they will provide a wonderful show of flowers in the garden or in containers. When picked as cut flowers for a vase or bouquet Calla's make a wonderful and artistic statement.\n\nAn attractive, native plant with strappy dark green foliage to 0.75 m high. Large mauve/ purple showy flowers appear on raised stems in spring and summer. The flowers are shortlived but on mature plants there will be a procession of them. This wonderful Tasmanian native that will grow in full-sun to semi-shade locations and in moist soils. Extremely water wise and frost-hardy.\n\nThis is a small tufted perennial rush with long strap-like green leaves to 1 m high. This tall, slender, yellow flower spike appears from the leaf base in the early growing season and persists for many weeks. As the spike matures, the structure is replaced by a tan, fruit-bearing shaft, composed of attractive clusters of small nutlets. This species is extremely hardy and tolerant of climatic extremes and most soil conditions. Widely grown for soil stabilisation."
