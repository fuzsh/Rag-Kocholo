This study investigated the effects of pre-treating Oriental lily bulbs with benzyl adenine (BA) and gibberellic acid (GA3) on breaking dormancy, time to emergence, flowering time, and bulb multiplication as alternatives to chilling treatment. Bulbs were soaked in various concentrations of BA and GA3 alone and in combinations. Results showed that soaking bulbs in 50 mg/L of BA or GA3 significantly broke dormancy and increased sprouting, comparable to chilled bulbs. Combining GA3 and BA also decreased time to emergence and flowering compared to the control. The highest sprouting occurred with 50 mg/L BA (92%) and 50 mg/L GA3 (96.67",
