        "text": "Common Name Canna lily, canna, arrowroot Botanical Name Canna × generalis Family Cannaceae Plant Type Annual, perennial, rhizome Mature Size 1.5-10 ft. tall, 1.5-6 ft. wide Sun Exposure Full Soil Type Moist Soil pH Acidic, neutral Bloom Time Summer Flower Color Yellow, orange, red, pink Hardiness Zones 6a-10a (USDA) Native Areas Caribbean, East and West Africa, Central and South America\n\nCanna Lily Care\n\nGive canna lilies full sun. In hotter regions, some afternoon shade is welcome.\n\nWater generously, especially in hot climates. Make sure the soil stays consistently moist.\n\nFeed them in early spring and mid-summer with a well-balanced, slow-release fertilizer.\n\nPrune away old and faded growth as it appears.\n\nUse rich, evenly moist soil but make sure it is well-draining.\n\nLight\n\nCannas do best in full sun. This means they may need more water in really hot climates, but they need heat to spur their growth. In the hottest areas, some afternoon shade helps flowers last longer.\n\nSoil\n\nPlant cannas in rich, moist soil, ideally with a slightly acidic to neutral soil pH.\n\nWater\n\nCannas need consistent water and evenly moist soil. Water often, especially in extreme heat. Insufficient water will cause the leaves to tear or crack.\n\nTemperature and Humidity\n\nBlooming depends on the climate and weather. In areas with cool springs, the plants may be slow to get started. Potting them up indoors, before your average last frost date, and moving them out while they are already growing, will help them bloom earlier. As tropical plants, cannas prefer humid air but can tolerate relative dryness, especially if they are properly watered.\n\nFertilizer\n\nIn addition to needing lots of water, cannas are hungry plants, although they store some food in their rhizomes. Feed them in early spring and midsummer, using a balanced fertilizer. For the amount, follow the product label instructions.\n\nTypes of Canna Lilies\n\n'Lucifer': This type hosts red flowers with yellow borders, has green leaves and grows up to two feet tall.\n\n'The President': A variety with scarlet blossoms and green leaves, it grows three to three and one-half feet tall.\n\n'Pretoria' ('Bengal Tiger'): Named for it's yellow and green striped foliage and orange flowers, this type can reach four to six feet tall\n\n'Stuttgart': This canna features orange flowers, green and white variegated foliage, and grows up to three or four feet tall.\n\n'Tropicanna': Perhaps the most exotic canna variety, it has dark variegated leaves with large, orange flowers or black leaves and gold flowers. It can reach six feet tall.\n\nPruning\n\nWhen it comes to canna lilies, pruning is not only for aesthetic purposes but for the health of the plant. Trimming away old growth removes pathogens that can cause diseases and promotes better air circulation If your canna lily has more space, the leaves and blooms will dry faster and the risk of fungal infection is lowered. Pruning also gives your plant the signal to direct its energy towards new growth.\n\nPropagating Canna Lily\n\nSince most of the newer varieties are hybrids, canna lilies are generally grown from rhizomes rather than seeds. If you live in a climate with frost and would like to preserve cannas for the next season, take the following steps.\n\nCut the foliage and stem to six inches.\n\nDig up the rhizomes and let them dry in a protected, shady spot.\n\nShake off the excess soil once dried.\n\nWrap the rhizomes in newspaper, and store them in a dark, cool location until spring.\n\nCheck on them periodically to make sure they are not rotting or drying out.\n\nLook for shoots that have at least two to three growing points or \"eyes\" over the course of the growing season. A single canna rhizome can become much larger, developing offshoot structures.\n\nCut away well-developed offshoots from the main rhizome to become new plants. Do this in spring, after you bring the rhizomes out of storage or dig them up for storage in the fall.\n\nThe size and amount of blooms of cannas are linked to the number of \"eyes\" on a rhizome. The more eyes, the bigger the plant, and the better its blooms. Look for rhizomes with three to five eyes, and plant them in spring with the eyes facing up four to five inches deep.\n\nPotting and Repotting Canna Lily\n\nCanna lily grown in a pot will need rich potting soil and good drainage. Adding pebbles at the bottom of a pot with ample drainage holes is recommended. The pot itself should be rather large, at least 12 inches in diameter, and made of any medium as long as the aforementioned drainage holes are abundant. It should also be very sturdy, as these plants can grow rather tall. The rhizomes should be planted four to five inches deep.\n\nThere may come a time when you will need to repot your canna lily. If it's appearing to outgrow its current container, check on the bottom. If roots are peaking through the drainage holes, it is time to move to a larger container. Early in spring is the best time to repot your canna. Fill the new container with rich soil, but don't pack it in - a gentle pat down will do. Water amply to help the roots settle.\n\nOverwintering\n\nIn warmer zones, canna lilies often survive winter in the ground. If the temperatures dip below freezing for several months, it's best to bring canna lilies inside to overwinter. Do this by gently lifting the clump of rhizomes and placing the plant in a pot. Cover the pot and tuck it away in a cool, dry place, such as an unheated garage. Set the lilies back into the ground as soon as the soil is soft enough to work.\n\nCommon Pests & Plant Diseases\n\nCanna leaves are covered with a waxy substance that repels water and protects against fungus. They may be bothered by rust or bacterial blight, especially in poorly drained soils. Pest problems can include leaf rollers and caterpillars, while slugs and snails may munch on the leaves.\n\nHow to Get Canna Lily to Bloom\n\nCanna lilies are treasured for their flowers and foliage. Their large, paddle-like leaves come in greens, blue-greens, and bronze and can be variegated and striped. Their blooms are equally showstoppers.\n\nBloom Months\n\nCanna lilies typically bloom from June to October. In planting zones 8 and up, cannas will repeat-bloom throughout summer, and throughout the year in zones 9 and above.\n\nHow Long does Canna Lily Bloom?\n\nA single canna lily bloom can last for up to a week before fading.\n\nWhat do Canna Lily Flowers Look and Smell Like\n\nCanna flowers are somewhat tubular and lily-like, coming in shades and combinations of yellow, orange, red, and pink, and are borne on tall stalks poking out of the foliage. Canna lilies are not fragrant.\n\nHow to Encourage More Blooms\n\nTo keep canna lily blooming all season, make sure the plant has full sun, as well as a spring feeding of 5-10-5 fertilizer. For the amount, follow the product label instructions. Give them plenty of water weekly and deadhead the blooms as they begin to fade, thus encouraging more growth. Check to be sure the rhizomes are no more than two to three inches deep in the soil, as planting them too deep will stunt the plant's growth.\n\nCanna lilies that are too crowded will fight for nutrients, and that means fewer blooms. To remedy this situation, divide the lilies every two to three years.\n\nCaring for Canna Lily After It Blooms\n\nOnce your canna lily's blooms begin to fade for good, you should snip them all off so the plant doesn't waste energy on spent flowers. The space above the second flowering node is where you want to cut. As you head into winter, wait for the first frost. The foliage will turn black. This is your sign to cut the plant all the way back to about 6 inches above ground level and add a layer of mulch.\n\nDeadheading Canna Lily Flowers\n\nAlways deadhead fading flowers during the blooming season. This will encourage more blooms and extend the flowering period.\n\nCommon Problems With Canna Lily\n\nThough canna lily often grows beautifully for years, the plant might encounter some problems. Here are the most common.\n\nLeaves Stuck Together or Covered in Black Droppings\n\nThis is the work of the leaf roller, a tiny pest that can pull together leaves with silky strands to hide and feed. A good insecticide will do the trick.\n\nHoles in Leaves\n\nWhen you see holes in leaves, that's the telltale sign of snails or slugs. Remove these by hand or use a horticultural oil to keep them away.\n\nCurling Leaves\n\nAphids leave a sticky sap behind that can curl up the leaves of your plant, leaving it quite unsightly. Blast them away with a water hose or use insecticide for serious infestations.\n\nFuzzy Mold\n\nA plant covered in fuzzy mold is infected with Botrytis blight. This fungus can be treated with a fungicide. If the infection is severe, consider removing the plant."
