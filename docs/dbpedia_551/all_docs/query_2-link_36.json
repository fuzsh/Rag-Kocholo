        "text": "The genus Zantedeschia, or Calla (Zantedeschia), unites 9 species of perennial herbaceous rhizomatous plants. The leaves are basal on long petioles, the rhizome is thickened. The most common species is the Ethiopian calla (Zantedeschia aethiopica). The shiny arrow-shaped leaves are painted a bright dark green color; petioles can reach a length of 60 cm. On an erect peduncle, a yellow inflorescence is formed-an ear (the swollen end of the inflorescence axis), wrapped in a large white blanket. If the calla is planted in the open ground in a shaded, moist place, it can grow up to 1 m in height. When growing in pots and containers, the plant height is 40-80 cm. There are several dwarf cultivars of Calla ethiopica suitable for growing in pots, for example, 'Stuttgart Pearl' and 'Little Jewel'. Other species are also of decorative interest. The oval-lanceolate leaves of Calla Elliot (Z. elliottiana) are covered with silvery spots, the cover is yellow, the plant height is 80-100 cm. Calla Pentland (Z pentlandii) is distinguished by lance-shaped leaves and a cover painted in a dark golden yellow color; it grows up to 60 cm in height. Elegant narrow calla leaves Remanna (Z. rehmannii) also with silvery-white spots, the inflorescence is wrapped in a pink blanket; height 30-40 cm.\n\nThe genus Zantedeschia, or Calla (Zantedeschia), unites 9 species of perennial herbaceous rhizomatous plants.

Elegant narrow calla leaves Remanna (Z. rehmannii) also with silvery-white spots, the inflorescence is wrapped in a pink blanket; height 30-40 cm.\n\nCultivation\n\nCalla calla species are unpretentious, moisture-loving, shade-tolerant (in a cold climate zone, they should be closed for the winter). Grown most often for cutting. Ideal location in the garden-near the pool, lake or stream. But calla lilies have long been cultivated as a pot culture for living rooms and other rooms, as well as balconies and terraces. During the growing season, calla lilies are fed once every 2 weeks, adding 10 g of complex fertilizer per bucket of water. Calla lilies grow better in slightly acidic soil.\n\nLocation\n\nCalla lilies prefer a place protected from the wind in the open sun or in partial shade.\n\nTemperature\n\nSome species, in particular, Calla ethiopica can tolerate short-term frosts (-4 and even -10 °C). The ideal winter air temperature is 7-10 °C. As for the period of intensive growth, these plants can withstand temperatures above 27 °C; however, the optimal values are 18-22 °C.\n\nWatering\n\nDuring the growing season, watering should be regular. In autumn, when the leaves dry up, watering is gradually reduced. If the air temperature is maintained in the range of 18-22 °C, then during the whole winter you can water only a few times.\n\nTransplant\n\nCalla ethiopica is transplanted into a new pot in October once every 2-3 years, while dividing the rhizome. Other species are transplanted in early spring.\n\nCare\n\nWilted flowers and damaged or yellowed leaves are regularly removed.\n\nReproduction\n\nCalla lilies are usually propagated by vegetative-root offspring, resting buds, and division of tuberous rhizomes. Plants obtained from seeds bloom only after 5 years (the optimal germination temperature is from 21 to 27 °C). More often, calla lilies are propagated by dividing the rhizome. In autumn, when the leaves begin to turn yellow, watering is reduced, and when the foliage dries completely, the rhizomes are removed from the ground (open ground or pot) and divided with a sharp knife, the blade of which is previously disinfected with a fungicidal preparation. Then the resulting parts are placed in 12-14-cm containers or on a permanent stand. place in the garden, covering with a 5-8-centimeter layer of soil. When preparing the soil, humus, peat, sawdust and other organic materials are used.\n\nDiseases\n\nCalla lilies are parasitized by a number of fungi, including Phytophthora. As a result of infection, yellowing of the edges of the leaves, rotting of the petioles and root system occurs, which can also affect the rhizome. The disease develops more intensively with high humidity. The infected plant is usually discarded. When infected with Phylosticta, brown spots with a discolored border appear on leaves, stems and bedspreads of various sizes. You can get rid of this fungus by using a fungicide treatment, after removing the diseased plants. With a black leg (pathogen-Erwinia carotovora), it rots rhizome - as a result, the leaves turn yellow, and then the plant dies. The most common pests are green apple aphids, which appear on leaves and blankets; thrips, which affect leaves and blankets; nematodes (in particular, the gall nematode - Meloidogyne), which form galls on the roots, which inhibits the development of the plant. Various pests are eliminated with the help of suitable preparations (insecticides, aphids).\n\nAcquisition\n\nPotted calla lilies go on sale in flower shops and gardening centers in the spring. Choose well-formed plants without signs of decay. Parts of rhizomes are acquired in autumn and winter. Buy medium-sized specimens, and larger ones should have a larger number of flowers. There should be no soft rotting areas on the rhizomes."
