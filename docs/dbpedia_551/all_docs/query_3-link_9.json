        "text": "Zantedeschia pentlandii\n\nOne of South Africa's most well loved bulbous plants is the common white arum lily, or Zantedeschia aethiopica to give it its scientific name. Commonly known as \"Pig Lily\", \"Cape Arum\", \"Varkblom\", \"Varkoor\", and \"Aronskelk\", amongst other local names, Zantedeschia aethiopica is common in many areas of the Western Cape where it usually frequents marshy habitats in full sun and is seen flowering in profusion from August until as late as January. This white arum also occurs in the summer rainfall areas of KwaZulu-Natal, in the Limpopo Province, Mpumalanga and even in Lesotho and it is widely cultivated abroad as a pot plant in cold climates and outdoors in milder parts.\n\nA lesser known, but much more beautiful arum lily is Zantedeschia pentlandii, a plant with a striking lemon chrome yellow petal like spathe with a dark purple blotch in the centre. There are two other yellow flowered arums, Zantedeschia jucunda from the Limpopo Province, and Zantedeschia elliottiana, the latter being a species which is only known in cultivation, its origin not yet having been found with certainty. At a glance, Zantedeschia. jucunda and Zantedeschia. elliottiana are at once distinguished from Zantedeschia. pentlandii in that Zantedeschia. pentlandii has unspotted leaves. The leaf shapes of these three species also differ from one another.\n\nUnlike the common Zantedeschia aethiopica, Zantedeschia pentlandii has a rather restricted natural distribution in Mpumalanga, where it is found between rocks and beside streamlets on grassy mountains in the Belfast, Dullstroom and Lydenburg districts. The Tonteldoos Valley, near Dullstroom, is home to the delightful golden arum lily (Zantedeschia. pentlandii). The older generation recall the Tonteldoos Mountains beaming with yellow flowers in summer only 50 years ago; today the arums are a rare sight. They make excellent cut flowers - lasting for over a month - and were in great demand during the 1960's. Harvesters simply pulled the flowers out by the stem, and in less than a decade the beautiful lily nearly disappeared.\n\nIts flowering period is November and December and, as with the other yellow-flowered species, it is a summer growing plant which dies down completely during the dry and cold winter months. Zantedeschia pentlandii is widely grown as a pot plant overseas, but here in its native South Africa, the complaint is often heard that the tuberous stems produce good leaves, but don't flower regularly.\n\nAt Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden, the plants have been found to require a rich, well drained soil containing plenty of well rotted compost, a full sun position and liberal watering during the summer growing months from October until the end of March. During the winter dormant period, the tuberous stems must be kept absolutely dry, and should be stored in dry soil at this time."
