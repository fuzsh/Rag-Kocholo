        "text": "The genus Zantedeschia, family Araceae, includes 8 species of rhizomatous herbaceous plants native to Africa. Some species are: Zantedeschia elliottiana, Zantedeschia rehmannii, Zantedeschia albomaculata, Zantedeschia aethiopica, Zantedeschia odorata.\n\nCommon names: Golden arum, Golden calla lily. This species is native to Mpumalanga, South Africa.\n\nThey are rhizomatous herbaceous plants that reach 60 cm (23.6\") in height. They have large arrow-shaped leaves (25 cm/9.84\") long) dark green with white or yellow spots. The flowers are trumpet-shaped and bright yellow (there are varieties of other colors). They bloom from late spring to summer. The fruits are quite decorative yellow berries.\n\nThey are used in pots and planters for terraces and patios, as indoor and greenhouse plants or in ponds and waterways.\n\nZantedeschia elliottiana prefers an exposure facing east or southeast in warm climates. In temperate climates they can be located in full sun. They do not resist temperatures below 12 ºC (53.6 ºF).\n\nThe soil must be well drained and contain abundant organic matter. The rhizomes are planted in spring or autumn at a depth of 5 cm (1.96\").\n\nWater moderately when the plant begins to sprout, waiting until the substrate has dried at least on the surface. When the leaves sprout, water frequently so that the soil is always moist (never flood). Do not water when the leaves begin to dry; let them dry completely.\n\nFertilize every 15 days with mineral fertilizer when the leaves sprout and once a week when flowering begins. Fertilize with organic matter at the time of transplanting or planting.\n\nPrune faded flowers because fruit and seed production weakens the plant.\n\nThey are quite resistant plants to pests and diseases; they can sometimes be attacked by snails and slugs."
