        "text": "Zantedeschia //[5] is a genus of eight species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southern Africa from South Africa north to Malawi. The genus has been introduced on all continents except Antarctica. Common names include arum lily for Z. aethiopica, calla, and calla lily for Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmannii although it is neither a true lily (Liliaceae), nor an Arum or a Calla (related genera in Araceae). The colourful flowers and leaves are highly valued, and both species and cultivars are widely used as ornamental plants.\n\nDescription[edit]\n\nZantedeschia also known as the Calla Lily species are rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plants with some species (Zantedeschia aethiopica) growing to 1.2m tall, while Zantedeschia rehmannii does not exceed 60 cm in height, growing in clumps or clusters.[6][7]\n\nRoots: Contractile, emerging from the top of the tubers in Group II.[6]\n\nStem: The underground portion is variously described as a thick underground stem (rhizomes or tubers).[8][9][10] While the literature is confusing as to the exact terminology, generally the Zantedeschia aethiopica-Zantedeschia odorata group (Group I) is referred to as having rhizomes, and the remaining species tubers.[6] The rhizomes are fleshy and branched.[11]\n\nLeaves: Petioles are long, spongy in nature, sheathed at the base and of varying length from 15 cm (Zantedeschia rehmannii) to 1.5 m (Zantedeschia aethiopica) in length. The lamina is simple, elongated and coriaceous with a variety of shapes, including triangular, oval (ovate) with or without a point (elliptic), heart (cordate), spear (hastate), lance (lanceolate), oblong, or circular (orbicular). 15–60 cm in length, 5–25 cm in width. The leaves are dark green in colour and feather-veined (pinnate), and may be erect or spreading with undulate margins. Some species exhibit transparent flecking (maculation), and are therefore referred to as maculate, while others are immaculate. (see Table I, also New Zealand Calla Council Leaf Shape Images[12])[6][7][8] The leaves contain hydathodes that result in guttation.[7][11]\n\nTable I: Descriptive features of Zantedeschia species foliage[6] Species Leaf shape Leaf size[8] Maculation Z. aethiopica Ovate-cordate or hastate 15–45×10–25 cm[8] rare Z. odorata Ovate to cordate none Z. albomaculata\n\nsubsp. albomaculata Oblong-hastate 20–50×6–8 cm[8] rare Z. albomaculata\n\nsubsp. macrocarpa Triangular-hastate 18–20×5–7 cm[8] sparse Z. valida Ovate to cordate to ovate-orbicular-cordate none Z. elliottiana Orbicular-ovate 22×18 cm[8] present Z. jucunda Triangular-hastate dense Z. pentlandii Oblong-elliptic to oblong-lanceolate seldom Z. rehmannii Lanceolate 20–30×3 cm[8] none\n\nInflorescence: Takes the form of a solitary pseudanthium (false flower), with a showy white or yellow spathe (a specialised petal like bract) shaped like a funnel with a yellow, central, finger-like spadix, which carries the true flowers. Both spathe and spadix are carried on or above the leaves on the fleshy flower stem. The shape of the spathe whose overlapping margins form the tubes varies from trumpet shaped (Z. pentlandii) to a tight tube with a tapering tip (Z. rehmannii). The spathe is initially green, but as it unfolds becomes coloured. This may be white as in Z. aethiopica, but other species include yellow and pink. Cultivars have a wide variety of other spathe colours including orange and purple. Inside the spathe, the throat may be darkly coloured.[6][13] The spathe acts to attract pollinators.\n\nFlowers: Zantedeschia is monoecious in which separate male (staminate) and female (pistillate) flowers (imperfect or unisexual flowers) are carried on the spadix. The flowers are small and non-blooming with an absent perianth. The male flowers contain two to three stamens fused to form a synandrium, and the female flowers have a single compound pistil with three fused carpels and three locules.[6][8][11]\n\nTable II: Descriptive features of Zantedeschia species inflorescences[6] Species Spathe colour Flowering period Throat darkened Z. aethiopica white-pink late winter - late spring No Z. odorata white late winter - late spring No Z. albomaculata\n\nsubsp. albomaculata white-pale yellow-coral pink late winter Yes Z. albomaculata\n\nsubsp. macrocarpa yellow summer Yes Z. valida cream summer Yes Z. elliottiana gold-yellow summer Yes Z. jucunda gold-yellow summer Yes Z. pentlandii lemon-chrome yellow summer Yes Z. rehmannii white-pink-maroon summer No\n\nFruit: Beaked orange or red berries.[11]\n\nTaxonomy[edit]\n\nSpecies[edit]\n\nEight species are currently recognized:[2][14]\n\nZantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng. – giant white arum lily or common arum lily - South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho\n\nZantedeschia albomaculata (Hook.) Baill. – spotted arum lily - widespread from South Africa north to Nigeria and Tanzania\n\nZantedeschia elliottiana (W.Watson) Engl. – yellow or golden arum lily - Mpumalanga Province of South Africa\n\nZantedeschia jucunda Letty - Leolo Mountains of northern South Africa\n\nZantedeschia odorata P.L.Perry - Western Cape Province\n\nZantedeschia pentlandii (R.Whyte ex W.Watson) Wittm. - Mpumalanga Province of South Africa\n\nZantedeschia rehmannii Engl. – pink arum lily - South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique\n\nZantedeschia valida (Letty) Y.Singh - KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa\n\nEtymology[edit]\n\nThe name of the genus was given as a tribute to Italian botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773–1846) by the German botanist Kurt Sprengel (1766–1833).\n\nDistribution and habitat[edit]\n\nAll species are endemic to central and southern Africa, from Nigeria to Tanzania and South Africa. Z. aethiopica grows naturally in marshy areas and is only deciduous when water becomes scarce. It grows continuously when watered and fed regularly and can survive periods of minor frosts. Z. aethiopica is a very strong and sturdy plant, being able to grow in many soils and habitats, multiplying by rhizome-offsets; it is naturalised and regarded as a weed throughout much of the world. Z. odorata is a rare species, resembling Z. aethiopica, but deciduous and smelling like freesia, endemic to a few localities in South Africa. Z. albomaculata is a widespread and variable species, growing from South Africa north to Kenya, varying in shades of white to cream and pink to orange-shades. Z. jucunda and Z. pentlandii are rare species with beautiful large yellow showy flowers. Z. rehmannii is a pink-flowered species with sword shaped leaves. Z. elliotiana is known from horticultural sources only and is probably of hybrid origin.\n\nIntroduction[edit]\n\nZantedeschia was introduced to Europe in the seventeenth century as Z. aethiopica[7] and is now widely naturalised[2][15] including Europe,[16]North America, Central America, South America, Oceania and Australasia. In many places it is considered a dangerous invasive species, displacing native vegetation.[17] In the South-West of Western Australia, Z. aethiopica was introduced for horticulture, but has become a widespread and conspicuous weed of watercourses, heath, and wetter pastures. Zantedeschia is represented in North America primarily as cultivars used as ornamental house plants.[11]\n\nHabitat[edit]\n\nZ. aethiopica grows naturally in marshy areas and is only deciduous when water becomes scarce. It grows continuously when watered and fed regularly and can survive periods of minor frosts. Z. aethiopica is a very strong and sturdy plant, being able to grow in many soils and habitats, multiplying by rhizome-offsets.\n\nCultivation[edit]\n\nAll Zantedeschia produce large, showy flowers spathes and are often grown both as ornamental plants and for cut flowers. Zantedeschia are relatively hardy plants, but some are more winter-hardy than others. In this regard there may be considered two groups, a hardy outdoor group with large white flowers (arum lilies) and less hardy group with white-spotted leaves and flowers in many colours (calla lilies), such as yellow, orange, pink and purple.[18]\n\nHardy forms (arum lilies)[edit]\n\nThese include Zantedeschia aethiopica and Zantedeschia pentlandii and their cultivars. Zantedeschia aethiopica and some of its relatives can survive at minimum winter temperatures below -23 °C (USDA Zone 6) and many others can be grown in even warmer areas where all the ground does not freeze (USDA Zone 7).[18]Z. pentlandii hybrids include 'Millenium Gold'.[19]\n\nTender forms (calla lilies)[edit]\n\nThe more tender specimens are mainly cultivars (hybrids) of Zantedeschia elliotiana and Zantedeschia rehmannii (referred to as elliotiana or rehmannii cultivars or hybrids, or as e.g. Z. x rehmanii), but also Zantedeschia albomaculata and Zantedeschia jucunda.. These less hardy forms can only survive winter temperatures to -12 °C (Zones 8). This plant must be grown as tender bulbs or houseplants in cooler areas. Species and hybrids between Z. elliotiana, Z. jucunda, Z. pentlandii and Z. rehmannii appear to have an optimum temperature for growth near 25 °C, with growth being suppressed once daily average temperatures persist at 28 °C.[18][20]\n\nZ. rehmannii hybrids include 'Amethyst'.,[21] 'Crystal Blush'.[22] and 'Neon Amour',[23] while an example of a Z. elliotiana x Z. rehmannii hybrid would be 'Blaze'.[24]Z. elliotiana x Z. maculata hybrids include 'Lemon Drop'.[25]Z. elliotiana hybrids include 'Solar Flare'.[26]\n\nSeasonal grouping[edit]\n\nOther classifications consider two groups based on their seasonal habits. Zantedeschia aethiopica and Zantedeschia odorata form one group (Group I) typified by retaining their leaves in winter, and flowering from late winter to late spring, while the remaining species (Group II) are in leaf from spring to late autumn shedding their leaves in winter (deciduous) and flower during the summer. Zantedeschia aethiopica may retain its leaves all year round (evergreen), otherwise from autumn to late summer, while Zantedeschia odorata retains its leaves from late winter to late spring. The two groups also vary according to the arrangement of the male and female organs. In the first group they are arranged together in the lower part of the spadix, whereas in the latter they are separate, with the female at the base. The Z. aethiopica group also have a fruit that turns soft and orange, whereas the other retains a firm green fruit.[6]\n\nToxicity[edit]\n\nZantedeschia shares the general properties of the Araceae family in causing contact irritation. Zantedeschia species are also poisonous due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the form of raphides. All parts of the plant are poisonous, typically producing local irritation or a burning sensation in the mouth and occasionally vomiting and diarrhea.[27][28] However leaves are sometimes cooked and eaten.[11][29]\n\nUses[edit]\n\nExtensive commercial production of Zantedeschia for cut flowers and/or planting material occurs in California, Colombia, New Zealand and Kenya.[20] Plant breeders in California and New Zealand continue to produce an extensive range of new hybrid cultivars. The so-called white calla is derived from Z. aethiopica. All varieties with flowers with shades of yellow, orange, red, purple are mainly derived from Z. albomaculata, Z. pentlandii, Z. elliottiana and Z. rehmanni.\n\nCulture[edit]\n\nZantedeschia has often been used in paintings, and is visible in many of Diego Rivera's works of art (see The Flower Vendor, amongst others). It was a favourite subject of the painter Georgia O'Keeffe. Zantedeschia or Calla lily is a very beautiful flower. During the flower language boom in the Victorian period of the 19th century, there were strict social codes and if one had to express ones feelings, flowers were the best medium. Flowers delivered the feelings subtly and every part of gifting a flower, carried secret flower meanings. The person who made the offer to the way the flowers were arranged, all had a specific meaning. Thus passionate messages were delivered to the recipient, without the use of words through flowers. During this time, calla lily was used to express many such hidden symbols. Calla lily due to its physical resemblance to female genitalia was called an overtly sexual one. This sexual calla lily meaning was brought forward to admirers by Freud and other artists like Georgia O'Keeffe.[30]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\nZantedeschia\n\nCalla Lily Origins\n\nThe calla lily originates from the southern parts of Africa, namely South Africa up to the country Malawi, which is positioned in alignment with the northern border of the African island Madagascar. This area has a tropical climate in which the calla lily really finds itself at home with a steady temperature, rainy seasons and dry seasons. As there is no real winter with cold winds and snow to worry about there are calla lilies that bloom all year around as long as they have a sufficient supply of water, energy and nutrition.\n\nCalla Lily History – Names\n\nThe name of the calla lily is not only just a common name that never is used professionally, it is also totally misinformative since the calla lily is neither a calla nor a lily. Once it was considered to be a calla and the discoverer, famous Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, actually categorized all similar plants under the calla genus. When further testing proved that not all callas were not closely related enough to be considered as one genus it was split up by the German botanist Karl Koch and the calla lily genus became known as the zantedeschia genus, named after the Italian botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi. However, all the genera are related to each other, as members of the family of Araceae.\n\nThe Calla Lily - Travelling to Europe\n\nIt is not really clear when the calla lily showed up in Europe, but based on an illustration from the Royal Garden in Paris in 1664, it is safe to say that it was grown in Europe at that time. The calla lily became a very popular flower after that, showing up at funerals, weddings and practically any festivity in Europe. It was especially popular since it could be made to bloom all year around in the southern to centre parts of Europe using simple greenhouses. It was a flower that could be grown even when the sky seemed dark."
