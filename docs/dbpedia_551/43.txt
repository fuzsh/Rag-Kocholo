Zantedeschia aethiopica

Common Names

Zantedeschia aethiopica is widely known by several common names, including the calla lily and the arum lily. These names reflect its popularity and widespread recognition in horticultural circles.

Conservation Status

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Zantedeschia aethiopica is classified as “Least Concern.” This status indicates that the species is not currently at significant risk of extinction in its natural habitat.

Scientific Classification

Kingdom: Plantae

Clade: Tracheophytes

Clade: Angiosperms

Clade: Monocots

Order: Alismatales

Family: Araceae

Genus: Zantedeschia

Species: Z. aethiopica

Binomial Name: Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng., 1826

Description

Physical Characteristics

Zantedeschia aethiopica is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant that can be evergreen or deciduous, depending on environmental conditions. It typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 1 meter (2.0 to 3.3 feet) and forms large clumps of broad, arrow-shaped dark green leaves, each up to 45 cm (18 inches) long.

Inflorescence and Spathe

The plant produces large inflorescences characterized by a pure white spathe, up to 25 cm (9.8 inches) long, surrounding a yellow spadix that can reach up to 90 mm (3.5 inches) in length. The spadix emits a faint, sweet fragrance, adding to the plant’s allure.

Toxicity

Zantedeschia aethiopica contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it toxic if ingested. Consuming any part of the raw plant can cause severe burning sensations and swelling in the lips, tongue, and throat, along with stomach pain and diarrhea.

Distribution and Habitat

Native to southern Africa, Zantedeschia aethiopica is found in Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa, and Eswatini. It has also naturalized in various regions worldwide, including Kenya, Madeira, the Azores, Malawi, New Zealand, Tanzania, Zambia, coastal California, and Australia. In Western Australia, it is classified as a toxic weed and pest, particularly in coastal prairies, wetlands, and riparian areas.

Cultivation and Uses

Notable Cultivars

Several cultivars of Zantedeschia aethiopica have been developed for ornamental purposes:

‘Crowborough’: More cold-tolerant, growing to 90 cm (35 inches), suitable for cooler climates.

‘Green Goddess’: Features green stripes on the spathes and a longer-lasting bloom.

‘Pink Mist’: A delicate cultivar with a pinkish base to the spathe and pink spadix, best developed in partial shade.

‘Red Desire’: Rare, with a red spadix instead of yellow.

‘White Sail’: Noted for its broad spathe and robust growth.

Hybridization Efforts

Efforts to hybridize Z. aethiopica with Z. elliotiana to introduce new colors have so far resulted in non-viable albino progeny, showcasing the challenges in creating hybrid varieties.

Wastewater Treatment

Zantedeschia aethiopica is used in the treatment of wastewater due to its ability to tolerate high levels of iron and thrive in wet conditions, demonstrating its utility beyond ornamental horticulture.

Symbolism

Zantedeschia aethiopica holds significant cultural symbolism. Until 2011, it was the national flower of Saint Helena, where it grows extensively despite being an invasive species. In Ireland, it is a symbol of Irish republicanism and nationalism, used to commemorate the dead of Easter 1916 and subsequent events.

Zantedeschia (Genus Overview)

Species Count and Distribution

The Zantedeschia genus consists of eight species of herbaceous, perennial, flowering plants. These species are native to southern Africa, from South Africa northeast to Malawi. The genus has been introduced in various forms to every continent except Antarctica, often for ornamental purposes.

Common Names and Misconceptions

Common names for Zantedeschia species include arum lily, calla lily, and golden calla lily. However, it is important to note that these plants are not true lilies (family Liliaceae). Additionally, despite visual similarities, the genera Arum and Calla are distinct from Zantedeschia.

Description

General Physical Characteristics

Zantedeschia species are rhizomatous, herbaceous perennials. Depending on the species, they can grow from 15 cm to over 1 meter tall. They typically form clumps or clusters and have thick underground stems, either rhizomes or tubers.

Inflorescence

The inflorescence of Zantedeschia takes the form of a solitary pseudanthium, featuring a showy spathe and a central spadix. The spathe is a specialized bract that can be white, yellow, or pink, while the spadix contains the true flowers.

Flower Structure

Zantedeschia is monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same spadix. Male flowers contain fused stamens, and female flowers have a compound pistil with fused carpels.

Recognized Species (Table of Eight Species)

Etymology

The genus Zantedeschia was named by the German botanist Kurt Sprengel in honor of the Italian botanist Giovanni Zantedeschi (1773–1846).

Distribution and Habitat

Natural and Introduced Ranges

Zantedeschia species are native to central and southern Africa, from Nigeria to Tanzania and South Africa. They have been introduced to many parts of the world, including Europe, North America, Central America, South America, Oceania, and Australasia, where they are often considered invasive.

Habitat Preferences

Zantedeschia species prefer marshy areas and can thrive in a variety of habitats, from wetlands to riparian zones. They are adaptable to different soil types and can survive minor frosts. In their native habitats, they grow continuously when water is available and can become deciduous in dry conditions.

Cultivation of Zantedeschia Species

General Cultivation Practices

Zantedeschia species are grown for their ornamental value and are popular in gardens and as cut flowers. They require well-drained soil, regular watering, and partial to full sunlight. Fertilization and protection from strong winds are also beneficial for optimal growth.

Hardy Forms (Arum Lilies)

Examples and USDA Zones

Hardy forms like Zantedeschia aethiopica and Zantedeschia pentlandii can survive winter temperatures below -23 °C (USDA Zone 6) and are suitable for areas where the ground does not freeze completely. Examples include the ‘Millennium Gold’ cultivar of Z. pentlandii.

Tender Forms (Calla Lilies)

Examples and USDA Zones

Tender forms, primarily hybrids of Zantedeschia elliotiana and Zantedeschia rehmannii, can only survive winter temperatures down to -12 °C (USDA Zone 8). These plants must be grown as tender bulbs or houseplants in cooler regions. Examples include ‘Amethyst’ (Z. rehmannii hybrid) and ‘Solar Flare’ (Z. elliotiana hybrid).

Seasonal Grouping

Evergreen vs. Deciduous Species

Zantedeschia species can be grouped based on their seasonal habits. Z. aethiopica and Z. odorata are evergreen or retain their leaves in winter, while other species are deciduous, shedding their leaves in winter and flowering in summer.

Toxicity and Safety Concerns

All parts of Zantedeschia plants are poisonous due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. Contact with the plant can cause irritation, and ingestion can lead to severe symptoms, including burning sensations and gastrointestinal distress. Despite this, cooked leaves of some species are sometimes consumed. It is essential to handle these plants with care and keep them away from pets and children.
