Zantedeschia elliottiana is a herbaceous plant up to 60 cm (2 ft) tall, with large deep green leaves spotted with white. It is summer-flowering plant with a yellow spathe marked with purple at the base.[2] The spathe surrounds a yellow spadix which occasionally produces a spike of bright yellow berries that are attractive to birds.[citation needed]

It (or its cultivar(s)) is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[citation needed] It has been shown that, as with other members of the family Araceae, immersing Zantedeschia elliottiana bulbs in gibberellic acid (GA3) solution and planting them at the end of February increases the emergence rate and the number of emerging shoots.[3]
