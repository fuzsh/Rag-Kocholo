Zantedeschia is a genus of eight species of herbaceous perennial flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southern Africa from South Africa north to Malawi. The genus has been introduced on all continents except Antarctica. Common names include arum lily for Zantedeschia aethiopica, calla, and calla lily for Zantedeschia elliottiana and Zantedeschia rehmannii although it is neither a true lily, nor an Arum or a Calla. The colourful flowers and leaves are highly valued, and both species and cultivars are widely used as ornamental plants.

Extensive commercial production of Zantedeschia for cut flowers and/or planting material occurs in California, Colombia, New Zealand and Kenya. Plant breeders in California and New Zealand continue to produce an extensive range of new hybrid cultivars. The so-called white calla is derived from Zantedeschia aethiopica. All varieties with flowers with shades of yellow, orange, red, purple are mainly derived from Zantedeschia albomaculata, Zantedeschia pentlandii, Zantedeschia elliottiana and Zantedeschia rehmanni.
