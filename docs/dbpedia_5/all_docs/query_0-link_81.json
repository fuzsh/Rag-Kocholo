        "text": "A 30-point fourth quarter pushed Devon Dynamos Taranaki to an upset 99-96 road win over the Easy LPG Bay Hawks in Taradale in tonight's Dominion Finance National Basketball League round four.\n\nThe Waikato Pistons had too much firepower for the struggling Manawatu OzJets 99-61 in Hamilton, while league-leading Youthtown Auckland Stars downed the feisty Cartridge World Otago Nuggets 92-82 in the Sky TV game in Auckland. American import Keith Salscheider scored a game-high 29 points, including the last five points in a 17-4 run that put Taranaki ahead for good, as the visitors rallied from an eight-point halftime and six-point three-quarter deficit to stun the Hawks. Salscheider finished 10-of-16 from the field, including 3-of-6 on three-pointers, while Tony Rampton added 12 points and 10 rebounds for his second double-double of the season, forward Link Abrams had 21 and Aaron Nowell 15 points. The Dynamos trailed by five, 82-77, with 6:23 to play but went on a 17-4 run to take their first lead of the game and led by eight points with 2.30 remaining. A Kevin Smith basket with 28sec to play pulled the hometown Hawks within two points, but Taranaki point guard Ben Jeffrey made one-of-two free throws, then Aidan Daly missed a three with 16sec remaining and the Dynamos ran out the clock and improved to 2-2 Paora Winitana top-scored for the Hawks, who drop to 1-2 with the loss, with 24 points, while big American Kareem Johnson had 22 and Paul Henare 16 points. The Stars got all they could handle from the winless Nuggets, eventually stretching the margin to double digits in the final two minutes. With just over four minutes to play, the Nuggets trailed 84-81 but went scoreless on their next four trips down the floor, featuring two great defensive plays from ex-Tall Black Dillon Boucher, first a block on Jason Greig near the hoop and a crucial steal from new Otago import Lemar Gayle, which led to a basket. Adrian Majstrovich led the Stars with 25 points and 12 rebounds, while Casey Frank, who capped the Stars 8-1 run in the final two minutes with a thunderous dunk, ended with 23 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Dylan Perfect-Tait kept Auckland out in front in the second and third quarters with his 15 points, including five-of-six from distance. Every time the Nuggets looked out, staring at double-digit deficits, the put in a run and trailed by just one point, 82-81 with five minutes to go. Gayle, who arrived on Monday to replace centre Rashaan Smith, finished with a team-high 20 points, five rebounds, six assists and four steals, while fellow American Jay Anderson had 18 and seven boards and Brent Charlton 17 points and seven rebounds. It was a bad return to Hamilton for former Waikato coach Tim McTamney and former import Kantrail Horton as the Jets were out-classed by the Pistons. Pistons guard Brian Wethers top-scored with 22 points as seven Pistons scored in double figures. Jason Crowe finished with 13 points and 12 assists, after having 11 assists at halftime before sitting out much of the second half as coach Murray McMahon gave the end of his bench some action. Keith Davis led Manawatu with 15 points, while Horton was held to single digit points.
