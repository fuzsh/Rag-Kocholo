        "text": "The No. 12-seeded Rockwell boys basketball team knew it faced a tough test in the second round of the 2A state playoffs. The Marshalls were going on the road to face No. 5-seed American Heritage, a team that had more than twice as many players available while also being taller and stronger.\n\nOh, and — as the Patriots proved early and often — they have some very good shooters too.\n\nAmerican Heritage blitzed Rockwell right out of the gate, scoring the first 16 points of the game and hitting eight 3-pointers in a 35-point first quarter.\n\nThe Marshalls, who were on the other end of a 95-56 blowout in their 2A first round game against UMA Hill Field on Tuesday, kept playing hard but couldn’t narrow the gap and ended up losing to the Patriots, 95-60.\n\n“Rockwell is a team we have full respect for,” American Heritage head coach Paora Winitana said. “They are an awesome group of young men. They might be small but they have the hearts of lions. We are so in awe of the way they play. We try to play like they do.”\n\nThe two teams had met twice before in Region 18 competition and the Patriots had won both, but those contests were much more competitive. American Heritage won by 14 at Eagle Mountain, then by just two points in American Fork.\n\nWinitana said that difference this time was having the full team available and doing what they were supposed to do.\n\n“This year has been a journey, learning and growing,” Winitana said. “They are learning what it takes to be good at basketball, learning to play together. A key tonight was rebounding. Rockwell normally kills it because they go so hard, but they only had two offensive rebounds at halftime. That might be a season low for them.”\n\nIt’s the end of a solid season for Rockwell, who finish the year with a 12-11 record, second in their region at 8-2 and with a state tournament win.\n\nThe Patriots have enjoyed a lot of success in 2022-23, sporting a 14-5 record overall and a perfect 10-0 mark in Region 18. Their only 2A loss was to No. 1-seed Enterprise, so this is a team that believes it can make a deep run.\n\n“We are so excited,” Winitana said. “We are blessed and feel a lot of gratitude. We have been working to prepare for this. It’s basketball, not rocket science. We need to stick to the game plan, stick together, stick to the scouting report. If we do that, I like our chances.”\n\nAmerican Heritage advances to the 2A quarterfinals, where they will face the winner of the game between No. 4-seed South Sevier and No. 13-seed North Summit.\n\nThat game will take place at Salt Lake Community College on Feb. 23 at 2:30 p.m. with a spot in the semifinals on the line.\n\nNewsletter"
