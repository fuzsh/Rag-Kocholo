        "text": "Today it was our school photos. Pippa and I had our sibling photos. The background was under a tree with a golden glow, from the sun, behind the tree. Tor\n\nBernie the photographer came to our school to take pictures of us and our siblings. I had a photo with my sibling Keeva. It was really fun. Isla\n\nYesterday Bernie Nepe came and took our school photo as well as individual and sibling photos. The Kavanaghs went first because I had to go to PTP. Tiana\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAll year we have been working with Papanui and Mangaweka schools, and whaea Leah, on Matauranga Maori. On the twenty third of November, the three schools went to the Kapahaka Festival in Raetihi to demonstrate all that we have achieved this year. After the powhiri we were given a class room to get ready in and to have a final practise. Then we waited in line until one of the pre school groups had their turn. Finally it was our turn. Once we were on stage we didn’t feel nervous any more. After everyone had stopped clapping Tor led us for our first song, Te Aroha. We did five songs that were exciting to sing. The audience gave us a huge pakipaki.\n\nAfter the festival we went to the Waiouru pool for a swim. We had an amazing day and can’t wait until next year.\n\nWritten by Pukeokahu School.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPet Day is fun, although the animals pee and poop everywhere. They did cool tricks and we lead our pets around to get judged. Kawana and Bayden.\n\nOn Pet Day I took Tome and Isla took Kate. I dressed up Tome up in a devil outfit and Isla dressed Kate up as a Queen. I won best groomed with Tome. Isla\n\nOn craft day we put a glass in a old gum boot and we arranged flowers to put in the glass in the gum boot,. Next we did our sand garden. We used lots of decorations from home, and decorated the whole sand garden until there was not much sand showing in the silver tray. After that we decorated the cup cake and put icing on top with lots of delicious colours. Next we put on sparkles and decorations like chocolate chunks. Then we did the confectionary necklace by using lollies and icing instead of using a glue gun or pva glue. We also did a vegetable and fruit animal creation, we had to use tooth picks to stand the vegetable or fruit up. Then we did the unusual flower arrangement with all sorts of weird things to place the flowers inside.\n\nThe next day was Pet day. There were lambs, dogs, puppies, a chicken and a calf. First the lambs went and the competitions were, hungriest, best calling, best led, best name. Then the dogs had their turn. They had, best led, best name, most obedient, best groomed, and calling. After that was most unusual pet, and the chicken won. After all of the pets were done we had best dressed pet, and best tricks. Once the competitions were over there were parents vs children challenge and races. Before the challenges we had a sausage sizzle and then we ate our lollies and cup cakes. It was YUMMY! Then we packed up and went home to relax. Tiana, Isla and Tor\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday we did some gardening. First we pulled out the weeds, then we turned over the soil. We have decided we would have strawberries, rainbow silverbeet, carrots, tomatoes and beetroot.\n\nHopefully we will get to eat the strawberries before the birds get there.\n\nBayden\n\nOn October the 20th we drew up a plan on the little whiteboard of what we are going to plant in our school garden. Then we went outside and started to pull out all the bad weeds growing in our special garden – Tiana and I did that. Then we turned the soil over with two gardening forks and a shovel. Kawana and Bayden worked on the snow pea pots. After that we started to clean up another part of our garden. Keeva and Tor did a part and Tiana and Pippa did a part. Then I had to put away the worm gloves and put the small gardening fork back in Mrs Gilbert’s car. I am excited about planting all the vegetables we decided on. Isla\n\nToday, which is the nineteenth of October, we went outside and did some gardening. Three of us had gloves on, including Mrs Gilbert. Every one had to dig up the garden. We pulled out the weeds and mixed up all the soil. We had to use a gardening fork to mash up the big chunks of soil. Kawana, and Pippi pulled some weeds out behind the bushes. Bayden pulled out some weeds from three gardens. Tor, Pippa and Tiana\n\nYesterday I pulled a big weed out. I also flattened the dirt. My favourite plant is yummy strawberries. Keeva\n\nWatch out for part 2 next week.\n\nAll photos remain the property of Pukeokahu School.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday a very important person came to our school. His name is Paora Winitana and he played basketball for New Zealand at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. He is 6ft 4in tall. His youngest brother came too.\n\nPaora talked about his family and growing up in a small community. He faced a lot of challenges in his life and spoke about how he overcame them.\n\nHe talked to us about always setting a goal and he gave us the challenge to make our own goals for when we grow up. He is inspired about always having a challenge ahead that he wants to achieve.\n\nHe believes that having good friends is the first step to achieving these goals so everyone should choose their friends wisely.\n\nTo be continued….\n\n26.9.17\n\nToday we talked about being a good friend, being kind to each other, being confident, positive, and learning to understand one another. We looked at our school values and how they encourage us to be a good friend and show friendship, respect and honesty.\n\nWe each had to put down three friendship steps that will help us be a good friend.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWe went to a park and met up with a man named Keith. Then we all grabbed a tray and a clipboard that had a piece of paper in it. The piece of paper had sea animals on it and we had to tick off the sea animals that we found. I went with Pippa. Pippa and I were the only ones who found a Rock Fish. I found a huge, colourful crab, we tried to get it out by, splashing water on the crab, but it did not work.\n\nAfter that we walked to a Fish & Chip shop that was near Chaddy’s Charter and ordered some fish and chips. The fish and chips were really, really, nice.\n\nOnce everyone had finished their fish and chips we went to Chaddy’s Charters. Dave gave everyone a life jacket, then we all hopped on board. Dave said, “It feels like you’re on a train.”\n\nThen we set sail, it was cool because there was a fishing line that you could chuck out and go fishing. On one part we caught a fish but then some how it unhooked itself. We went around an island and saw a whole bunch of seals and we saw a seal swimming in the water. I was scared a seal was going to jump up and get me. After we went around that Island we went to go to another Island, but then it started raining, so we went back to Chaddy’s Charters. I found a machine that could turn one cent coins into a cool coin, that had a seal on it, everyone got one.\n\nThen everyone ran to their cars and went to Puke Ariki. When we got there, there was a pieces of paper and a pencil at the counter so I grabbed a piece of paper and went down some stairs and went into a art gallery. We had to write down the artists names. Once we were done we had to go to the lady in the art room and check if it is correct and then go to the counter and get our badge. Tor and I did all of it together.\n\nTiana\n\nAll photos remain the property of Pukeokahu School\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
