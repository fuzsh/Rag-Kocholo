        "text": "NBL Standings\n\nAUCKLAND (NBL) - Bottom-of-the-table Otago Nuggets dealt a blow to St Laurence Wellington Saints' NBL post-season chances, rallying in the final quarter for a thrilling 81-79 victory in Dunedin - their second win of the season.\n\nSaints, who achieved an impressive road win over the NBS Nelson Giants midweek, seemed headed for a comfortable two competition points as they carried an 11-point advantage in the fourth period. But Americans Branduinn Fullove and Brandon Morris sparked a furious comeback to gradually haul the deficit back, combining for 18 points in a 26-13 quarter, and guard Shaun Tilby drove the lane for winning basket in the dying seconds.\n\nFullove lead all scorers with 30 points (11/16 FG, 4/5 3pt, 4/5 FT), while forward Brendon Polyblank, building on his starring role in Nelson, was again the best of the Saints with 21 points (7/12 FG, 2/4 3pt, 5/5 FT).\n\nSaints fell to 7-5 and round off their South Island triple header against Scenic Circle Canterbury Rams tomorrow. The Nuggets (2-10) have a chance to climb off the bottom of the table when they host Waikato Pistons - one spot ahead of them on 2-9 - next Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Auckland Stars and Easy LPG Bay Hawks - last season's NBL finalists - continued their journey towards the 2006 title game with wins over NZCT Taranaki Mountain Airs and Nelson respectively.\n\nReigning MVP Lindsay Tait led the Stars with 23 points (10/14 FG, 3/4 3pt) and six assists as they prevailing 91-72 over an undermanned Taranaki side missing Tall Black centre Tony Rampton and injured American Garry Hill-Thomas, the league's scoring leader. The visitors drew away in the second quarter with Casey Frank adding a \"double double\" of 19 points/12 rebounds, along with five blocks.\n\nAmerican Cody Toppert tried to pick up the slack for the Airs, scoring 32 points, while veteran forward Link Abrams had 23 points/10 rebounds.\n\nThe Stars (11-1) continue to lead the competition, but face a real challenge next Friday when they visit the Hawks for the televised game.\n\nThe Hawks tuned up for the top-of-the-table clash with a 71-63 home result over the Giants, who are starting to slide down the rankings with their third consecutive loss. Nelson actually led by 11 points after the opening quarter and were still 44-36 up at halftime before their performance turned to custard.\n\nTall Black Phill Jones, in his second outing since returning from a season in Italy, was slapped with two technical fouls in the third period and tossed from the game. His team seemed to fall away, managing just 19 points in the second half.\n\nInternational Paora Winitana (6/12 FG, 3/4 3pt, 5/8 FT) had 20 points for the Hawks (9-1), while American Josh Pace led Nelson with 22. The Giants will try to break their free fall against Inspire Net Manawatu Jets tomorrow.\n\nResults\n\nAuckland Stars 91 (Lindsay Tait 23, Brock Gillespie 20, Casey Frank 19)\n\nNZCT Taranaki Mountain Airs 72 (Link Abrams 23, Cody Toppert 32)\n\nEasy LPG Bay Hawks 71 (Paora Winitana 20, Kareem Johnson 14, Aidan Daly 11, Field Williams 10)\n\nNBS Nelson Giants 63 (Josh Pace 22, Eric Freeman 20)\n\nOtago Nuggets 81 (Branduinn Fullove 30, Brandon Morris 20, Shaun Tilby 12)\n\nSt Laurence Wellington Saints 79 (Brendon Polyblank 21, Nick Horvath 16, Chris Anderson 13)\n\nGrant Chapman"
