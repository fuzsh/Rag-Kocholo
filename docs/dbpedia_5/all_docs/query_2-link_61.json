        "text": "AUCKLAND (NBL) - NBS Nelson Giants coach Nenad Vucinic chalked up his NBL-record 144th win as his team rallied to an 88-84 home win over high-flying Easy LPG Bay Hawks.\n\nVeteran centre Ed Book (35), who retired from the national team after winning a silver medal at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in March, showed there was still petrol in the tank with 25 points (11/19 FG, 1/4 3pt, 2/3 FT) in a game that seemed to be the Hawks' for the taking entering the final period. After an even first half, the visitors drew away in the third quarter, stretching their advantage as far as 10 points late in that period.\n\nBut Nelson began to rally right about the time they totally capitulated during their 63-71 loss in Napier two weeks ago. They scored the final four points of the third period, then continued on a 15-2 run that carried them into the lead (73-70) with 6m 17s remaining.\n\nThe Hawks, in turn, fell nine points astray, but drew within one off a three-pointer from American Field Williams with 22 seconds left. They had to foul to regain possession, though, and Nelson were allowed to close out the win from the free throw line.\n\nAmerican Josh Pace again contributed a fine all-round effort - 19 points/eight rebounds/seven assists/three steals - for the winners, while Tall Black Mika Vukona had a \"double double\" of 10 points/11 rebounds, including nine offensive boards.\n\nCaptain Paora Winitana led the Hawks with 26 points (10/15 FG, 3/7 3pt, 3/4 FT).\n\nThe Giants (10-4) still lie third on the points table, but now trail Hawks only on countback. They host NZCT Taranaki Mountain Airs next Saturday.\n\nThe Hawks (10-2) must regroup from their first road loss of the season to take on St Laurence Wellington Saints tomorrow night."
