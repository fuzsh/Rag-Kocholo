        "text": "By Admin, 23rd May 2015\n\nCategory: News\n\nCoach Mark Dickel believes the Canterbury Rams have only shown flashes of their potential this season on the National Basketball League. Canterbury delivered their most consistent NBL showing in last Friday night’s 83-62 win over the Bay Hawks in Christchurch. With the exception of a sloppy five-minutes span at the start of the second half it was a pleasing display from the Rams, who set the tone defensively. The quirks of the NBL draw mean the Rams match-up against the Hawks again at Cowles Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Dickel hopes the victory over the Hawks was a starting point for the 6-5 Rams, who need to keep winning to boost their top-four playoff aspirations. Canterbury play four of their last seven matches at home and Dickel said it was imperative they built on their last performance. “There’s seven games left and we really need to start playing some of our best basketball. We’ve got a string of home games coming up … If you want to reach your [playoff] goals, you’ve got to win your home games. Our team has such huge room for improvement.”\n\nWellington, Nelson and Super City look set to secure three of the four final spots, meaning Canterbury, Southland and possibly Hawke’s Bay will be scrapping it out for the final berth. Dickel expected the Hawks, who have a 3-5 record, to be a far tougher challenge than last time out, where they trailed 21-9 after the first quarter. Former Tall Black veteran Paora Winitana is fit again after a calf strain, but the Mormon bishop won’t play on Sunday due to his religious beliefs. “It’s going to be a far more difficult encounter, for sure,” Dickel said. “They’re playing for their season and they’re going to be desperate. We have to be equally desperate because we’re playing for our season too.” The Rams will have to be wary of the Hawks’ standout import Suleiman Braimoh, who finished with 25 points last week, having scored just five in the first half. Marques Whippy did a fine defensive job on Braimoh in the first half and Dickel said they had to try and keep him out of foul trouble.\n\nThe coach was also encouraged by the performances of the Rams’ former NBA duo, Jermaine Taylor and Mickell Gladness, who both made telling contributions in their last game. Gladness was busy with 12 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks. Taylor, who had been poor in his opening three games, looked far more comfortable, finishing with 19 points, which included five three pointers. If the Rams are to make the top four, they will need strong productivity from both players over the final stage of the season.\n\nDickel has rewarded young guards Toby Gillooly and Richard Rodger, who have been included in the Rams’ gameday 12 for the first time. The pair had been outstanding at training in recent weeks and deserved their call up, he said.\n\nGillooly, 17, is a Year 12 student at Burnside High School.\n\nAT A GLANCE:\n\nCanterbury Rams vs Bay Hawks; Sunday 2pm, Cowles Stadium.\n\nCanterbury: Ethan Rusbatch (c), Marques Whippy (c), Jermaine Taylor, Richie Edwards, Mickell Gladness, Jeremy Kench, Sam Timmins, Tony Tolovae, Marty Davison, Gareth Dawson, Toby Gillooly, Richard Rodger.\n\nHawke’s Bay: Jarrod Kenny, Alonzo Burton, Suleiman Braimoh, Zack Atkinson, Morgan Natanahira, Luke Aston, Ana Haku, Darryl Jones, Mateus Marsh, Wilfred Dickson."
