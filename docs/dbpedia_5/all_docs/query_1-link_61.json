When he passed away, it was his wish to ensure that youth in Hawke’s Bay had access to sport and that they could compete to the highest level.\n\nThe Jarrod Cunningham Youth Sport Trust was set up in 2007 and since then over $150,000 has gone back into the local community and the nurturing of our sport talent.\n\nHow do we support youth, sports and our future sports stars?\n\nEach year the Trust makes contributions in a range of ways based on promoting physical activity (sport & recreation) to youth and assisting local athletes to perform on the international stage.\n\nCurrent initiatives we support:"
