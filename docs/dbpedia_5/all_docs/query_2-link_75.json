        "text": "ADELAIDE needs to remember how to win and South Dragons have slipped a new import under the radar.\n\nThose were the off-court overnight developments in the NBL while the world slept and the Boomers wept as another Olympic campaign fell short of expectations.\n\nIn truth, the Aussies finishing in the fifth-to-eighth bracket is an accurate reflection of where we sit on the world stage, though the Olympic Games abandoning the traditional positional play-offs is a letdown.\n\nNew 36ers coach Scott Ninnis found losing his first pre-season outing to Melbourne 92-96 on Wednesday a similar letdown and not one he wants to revisit tonight in Whyalla against the Tigers.\n\n\"I don't like to lose at a game of marbles so I'm never happy if we lose,\" he said after what was, after all, a practice game at the Dome and one for which the Tigers were infinitely better prepared.\n\nStephen Hoare, Daryl Corletto, Tommy Greer and Nathan Crosswell all are championship winners, Rod Grizzard at Singapore last season was one of the NBL's marquee imports while Adrien Sturt, Matt O'Hea and Daniel Johnson play together on Melbourne's Big V team which tomorrow hosts Forestville in an ABA quarter-final.\n\nWhen it mattered, they were much more in sync than a vastly retooled Adelaide which had Ryan Kersten at starting point guard and Dragons' returnees Jacob Holmes and Brad Hill a combined 6-of-29 from the floor.\n\n\"I think they were just trying too hard,\" Ninnis said in what was probably a fair assessment.\n\n\"I'm happy with our versatility.\n\n\"We have a lot of guys who can handle the ball. Paora (Winitana) is another one who can take the ball off the defensive boards and push it up the floor, with guards flying down the wings.\n\n\"That's how we want to play.\"\n\nAaron Bruce, the Boomers' 2006 world championship playmaker who joined the team on Tuesday, will suit tonight and Adam Ballinger also should see more court time.\n\nGnawing at Ninnis was not so much his team's inability to find the right shots at crunch time or its few defensive breakdowns.\n\n\"That stuff is fixable,\" he said.\n\n\"But we need to build a winning culture. We don't want to accept a loss at any time and certainly not one in our own building.\"\n\nJust as badly in need of the run as Ballinger and Luke Schenscher were the three local referees. They had far from their finest two hours.\n\nAcross the border, South has quietly slipped 196cm Niagara University off-guard/small forward Tremmell Darden into its line-up, clearly not anticipating Ebi Ere to take up his NBL option."
