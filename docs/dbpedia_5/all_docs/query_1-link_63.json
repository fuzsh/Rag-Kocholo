        "text": "If Luke Schenscher is not the best player in the NBL today, \"he's pretty damn close\" according to Adelaide 36ers coach Scott Ninnis.\n\n\"He had 37 points on 14-of-17 shooting and 15 rebounds last game against Wollongong,\" Ninnis said as his Sixers prepared to buck history in Thursday night's quarter-final against New Zealand Breakers in Auckland.\n\n\"If he'd been defended legally, he probably would have scored 50.\n\n\"He's been awesome at training all week and if he's not the best player in the country at the moment, he's pretty damn close to it.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Adelaide supporters, the 36ers are out of the country, playing in the historic first NBL play-off game outside of Australia.\n\nWhile the Sixers did win in Auckland this season, they also went down there by 38, their biggest losing margin of the year.\n\nIn Adelaide in their penultimate regular season game, the 36ers won by 11. But that was in Brett Maher's last scheduled game at the Dome.\n\nIn truth, there are no firm conclusions to be drawn from their three meetings.\n\n\"We had completely different line-ups every time,\" Ninnis said. \"It was extraordinary when you think that the first time, we lost Adam Ballinger and Aaron Bruce on game day, then in the second game, CJ (Bruton) hurt himself during the warm-up.\"\n\nNew Zealand were minus Paul Henare for the first match-up and Adelaide travelled without Tall Blacks international Paora Winitana. Bruton's shock pre-game withdrawal from the second match-up and the absence of Phill Jones was compensated by the 36ers missing injured guards Maher and Brad Davidson.\n\nAnd in their most recent meeting 12 days ago at Maher's emotional farewell game, New Zealand's league MVP candidate Kirk Penney was out injured.\n\n\"There have been some crazy circumstances in our series with them,\" Ninnis said. \"There's no secret to how to beat them, but it's just being able to do it.\n\n\"They execute their offence so well and are so thorough. They set physical screens to get shooters open and we have to disrupt that."
