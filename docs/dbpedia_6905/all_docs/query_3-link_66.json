        "text": "In this essay, we will \\discover&quot; the dual problem associated with an LP. We will see how to interpret the meanings of the dual decision variables in the context of the original problem, and we will present some theorems (\\facts&quot;) about the relationship between the optimal primal and dual solutions that will lead us to the key ideas of the simplex method for solving LPs.\n\nAbstract The theory of duality for linear programs is well-developed and has been successful in advancing both the theory and practice of linear programming. In principle, much of this broad framework can be extended to mixed-integer linear programs, but this has proven difficult, in part because duality theory does not integrate well with current computational practice.\n\nThe theory of flows in networks began to evolve in the early 1950’s.The various linear optimisation questions that could be asked of flows in conserving networks turned out to be neat combinatorial specialisations of linear programming. The simplex method (and its variants) turned out to have very pretty combinatorial interpretations on networks. The algebraic dexterity of linear programming duality led to a unified treatment of many deep theorems in graph theory and combinatorics. In this part, the last of the series on linear programming, we will see glimpses of the theory of network flows through a specific flow optimisation problem — the maximum flow problem."
