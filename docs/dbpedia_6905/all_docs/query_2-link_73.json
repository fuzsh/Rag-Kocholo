        "text": "Beloved husband of Jane E. Petry (nee Smith) for 56 years: dearest father of Jennifer J. (Brian) Coulter, Maureen J. (Chad) Dressing, and Theresa E. Petry. Much loved Papa of Nathan and Hanna Dressing and Maeve and Reid Petry Coulter. Dear brother of Dallas Petry, Marilyn Kuhn, Charlotte Bruce, Sandy Petry. Deceased Dorothea Hirtz, Shirley Jean Hirtz, and Albert John Petry. Dear father-in-law, brother-in-law uncle and cousin to many. Friend to many business acquaintances involved in Petry Roofing and Petry Roofing Supply.\n\nHarold came to St. Louis from Glennonville, MO in 1959, at 16 years-old, with a paper bag for a suitcase with all he owned. His first job was at 66 Drive Inn Theater making .75 cents an hour. He then went into construction making $1.00 an hour and from there into his lifelong career in roofing and sales.\n\nHe attended St. Gerard Majella Teen Town saw Jane and said, “I am taking that girl home tonight.” Not only did he take her home he married her at that very parish in 1962. He was drafted into the Army during the Viet Nam conflict and discharged quickly after they learned his fall from a roof had left him with two broken heels.\n\nHarold was an extremely hard worker. He and Jane accumulated real estate – building several warehouses and obtaining rental houses. He instilled his work ethics in his family. He loved his faith, family and country. He recognized that Trump, an imperfect human, might be able to save our country and he supported him with gusto – wearing his hat publicly to proclaim his beliefs.\n\nHe loved Fox News and fishing for crappie at the family lake house, in the Ozarks. He followed the Cardinals, loved planting tomatoes and winning free sodas for Jane on his I-Phone Mobile Ap. Closest to his heart were the family trips to Florida, Boston and Arizona. Watching his grandchildren, in person or on the internet, were his cherished times. Irish dancing, baseball, soccer, and volleyball – he loved all of it. He was always coaching from the sidelines in person or on the screen.\n\nFood, and the preparation of it, were important to Harold. As his health was failing, his concern was who would fry the crappie and fix the Thanksgiving dinner. He would lament that – it is what it is – regards the ever present health issues. He became a daily advocate of The Rosary and Pro Life. He was often present at the First Saturday of the Month Rosary at Assumption. Always an expected part of the numerous family events was a game of Rummy. To this day, there are a few scorecards for the big wins floating around.\n\nFuneral from Kutis Affton Chapel Friday November 16, 9:30am with mass celebrated at St. Paul’s Catholic Church (Fenton) 10am. Interment Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery. Visitation Thursday 3 to 8pm\n\nIn lieu of flowers Harold has asked that any In Memorials be made to Billboards for Life and to think of him and say a Hail Mary when you pass. Envelops are available with a history of the program at Kutis. Thanks to all who support our family and support us in our grief. The Rosary will be said at 8:00 P.M."
