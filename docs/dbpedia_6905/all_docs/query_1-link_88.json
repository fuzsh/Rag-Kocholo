        "text": "The Cornelia Clapp Auditorium recognizes Cornelia Clapp, the first female scientist to arrive in Woods Hole for the MBL’s inaugural summer in 1888. Clapp, who worked at the MBL as a student, investigator, instructor, and the first librarian, became the first woman trustee of the MBL in 1910 and held the position until her death in 1934. Since the 1930s, the auditorium has been the MBL’s epicenter of scientific dissemination and community engagement. Auditorium seats have been named after prominent members of the MBL community. We invite you to connect your legacy or recognize a colleague or loved one with a named seat in this historic and beloved venue.\n\nDownload Available Seats and contact Ashley Bolbrock (abolbrock@mbl.edu) to discuss next steps."
