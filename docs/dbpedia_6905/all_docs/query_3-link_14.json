        "text": "SEVERAL weeks before the 1994 Nobel prize in economics was announced on Oct. 11, two mathematicians -- Harold W. Kuhn and John Forbes Nash Jr. -- visited their old teacher, Albert W. Tucker, now almost 90 and bedridden, at Meadow Lakes, a nursing home near here.\n\nMr. Nash hadn't spoken with his mentor in several years. Their hour-long conversation, from which Mr. Kuhn excused himself, concerned number theory. When Mr. Nash stepped out of the room, Mr. Kuhn returned to tell Mr. Tucker a stunning secret: Unbeknownst to Mr. Nash, the Royal Swedish Academy intended to grant Mr. Nash a Nobel for work he had done as the old man's student in 1949, work that turned out to have revolutionary implications for economics.\n\nThe award was a miracle. It wasn't just that Mr. Nash, one of the mathematical geniuses of the postwar era, was finally getting the recognition he deserved. Nor that he was being honored for a slender 27-page Ph.D. thesis written almost half a century ago at the tender age of 21.\n\nThe real miracle was that the 66-year-old Mr. Nash -- tall, gray, with sad eyes and the soft, raspy voice of someone who doesn't talk much -- was alive and well enough to receive the prize. For John Nash was stricken with paranoid schizophrenia more than three decades earlier.\n\nMr. Nash's terrible illness was an open secret among mathematicians and economists. No sooner had Fortune magazine singled him out in July 1958 as America's brilliant young star of the \"new mathematics\" than the disease had devastated Mr. Nash's personal and professional life. He hadn't published a scientific paper since 1958. He hadn't held an academic post since 1959. Many people had heard, incorrectly, that he had had a lobotomy. Others, mainly those outside Princeton, simply assumed that he was dead.\n\nHe didn't die, but his life, once so full of brightness and promise, became hellish. There were repeated commitments to psychiatric hospitals. Failed treatments. Fearful delusions. A period of wandering around Europe. Stretches in Roanoke, Va., where Mr. Nash's mother and sister lived. Finally, a return to Princeton, where he had once been the rising star. There he became the Phantom of Fine Hall, a mute figure who scribbled strange equations on blackboards in the mathematics building and searched anxiously for secret messages in numbers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
