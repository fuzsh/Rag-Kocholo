ABC Family Worldwide is a subsidiary of the Disney Entertainment division of The Walt Disney Company that operates American basic cable channel Freeform and manages the programming libraries of Disney's currently-inactive subsidiaries BVS Entertainment and Fox Kids/Jetix.

The company was originally formed as International Family Entertainment, a spin-off of the Christian Broadcasting Network's cable network The Family Channel.

In 1993, IFE acquired the assets of defunct British ITV broadcaster Television South, whose holdings included the library of U.S. studio MTM Enterprises. In 1996, IFE was acquired by News Corporation; the MTM library was melded into 20th Century Fox Television's library, while the remainder was melded into Fox Kids Worldwide (a merger of its Fox Kids unit with Saban Entertainment), to form Fox Family Worldwide. Fox and Saban planned to leverage the popular Fox Kids lineup to turn The Family Channel (which was re-branded as the Fox Family Channel following the purchase) into a competitor to other children's-oriented cable channels such as Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network. The subsidiary also established international Fox Kids networks in Europe and Latin America.
