        "text": "Freeform, previously known as ABC Family, is a cable network owned by Disney ABC Cable Networks, featuring programming aimed at teenagers and young adults - In the 14-34 age range. as well as families during its Funday Weekend block and specials such as the 25 Days Until Christmas special.\n\nIt was originally founded in 1977 as The CBN Cable Network by Evangelical Minister, Pat Robertson, as an extension to his television ministry. Over time, the network started airing less and less “religious” programming and started to air family-focused programming. To reflect this major change in format and purpose, the channel changed its name to The Family Channel in 1988. By the year 1990, CBN spun off the network because it had become too profitable for the ministry. In 1997, News Corporation, owners of the Fox television network, and Saban Entertainment decided to buy the network and changed the name of the network to Fox Family Channel the next year. In 2002, ABC bought the channel and gave it the name ABC Family. Now, it’s rebranded under its current name, Freeform, on January 12, 2016, focusing on teens and young adults where it has experienced the most success\n\nShows[]\n\nEnjoy. :)\n\nCurrent[]\n\nMovies:\n\nMy Cousin Vinny (1992)\n\nMy Little Pony: The Movie (2017)\n\nWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n\nMr & Mrs Smith (2005)\n\nLilo & Stitch (2002)\n\nFinding Nemo (2003)\n\nFinding Dory (2016)\n\nBig (1988)\n\nThe Goonies (1985)\n\nThe Karate Kid (2010)\n\nTwilight Movie Marathon (2008-2012)\n\nHook (1991)\n\nThe Hunger Games Movie Marathon (2012-2015)\n\nA Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969)\n\nSnoopy, Come Home (1972)\n\nPretty Woman (1990)\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\nJumanji (1995)\n\nMatilda (1996)\n\nComing to America (1988)\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nAladdin (1992)\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nThe Incredibles (2004)\n\nIncredibles 2 (2018)\n\nWreck It Ralph (2012)\n\nRalph Breaks The Internet (2018)\n\nPlanes (2013)\n\nPlanes: Fire & Rescue (2014)\n\nMonsters Inc (2001)\n\nUglyDolls (2011)\n\nUglyDolls 2 (2014)\n\nHotel T (2012)\n\nHotel T 2 (2015)\n\nHotel T 3 (2018)\n\nTangled (2010)\n\nOnward (2020)\n\nBeauty And The Beast (2017)\n\nHercules (1977)\n\nZootopia (2016)\n\nThe Bad Piggies Movie (2017)\n\nThe Numberblocks Movie (2016)\n\nThe Numberblocks Movie 2 (2019)\n\nInside Out (2015)\n\nThere's Something About Mary (1998)\n\nI Feel Pretty (2018)\n\nClueless (1995)\n\nPretty in Pink (1986)\n\nLiar Liar (1997)\n\nShrek (2001)\n\nShrek 2 (2004)\n\nShrek the Third (2007)\n\nShrek Forever After (2010)\n\nSpace Jam (1996)\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nGhostbusters (1984)\n\nGhostbusters 2 (1989)\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989)\n\nThe Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea (2000)\n\nThe Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning (2008)\n\nHercules (1997)\n\nBeauty and the Beast (1991)\n\nHocus Pocus (1993)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)\n\nHoles (2003)\n\nCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009)\n\nMe, Myself & Irene (2000)\n\nThe Aristocats (1970)\n\nBon Voyage Charlie Brown (1980)\n\nArmageddon (1998)\n\nWhat Happens in Vegas (2008)\n\nSweet Home Alabama (2002)\n\nMr Deeds (2002)\n\nChristmas with the Kranks (2004)\n\nMadagascar 3 Europe's Most Wanted (2012)\n\nBambi (1942)\n\nBambi II (2006)\n\nCars (2006)\n\nCars 2 (2011)\n\nCars 3 (2017)\n\nFree Willy (1993)\n\nEasy A (2010)\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks (2007)\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nMeet the Robinsons (2007)\n\nAlvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel (2009)\n\nTarzan (1999)\n\nTarzan II (2005)\n\nMulan (1998)\n\nChip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers (2022)\n\nLuca (2021)\n\nLightyear (2022)\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nSoul (2020)\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)\n\nToy Story 3 (2010)\n\nToy Story 4 (2019)\n\nEarly Man (2018)\n\nOpen Season (2006)\n\nOver The Hedge (2006)\n\nSonic The Hedgehog (2020)\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 2 (2022)\n\nMulan II (2005)\n\nMary Poppins (1964)\n\nWonder (2017)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (2010)\n\nNational Treasure (2004)\n\nNational Treasure 2 Book of Secrets (2007)\n\nThe Bourne Identity (2002)\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy (2004)\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum (2007)\n\nThe Game Plan (2007)\n\nGood Burger (1997)\n\nAlien (1979)\n\nAliens (1986)\n\nIce Age: The Meltdown (2006)\n\nMy Science Project (1985) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Black Cauldron (1985) [COMING SOON]\n\nOliver & Company (1988) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Rescuers Down Under (1990) [COMING SOON]\n\nJames and the Giant Peach (1996) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949) [COMING SOON]\n\nHarriet the Spy (1996) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course (2002) [COMING SOON]\n\nPee-Wee's Big Adventure (1985) [COMING SOON]\n\nPinocchio (1940) [COMING SOON]\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) [COMING SOON]\n\nFerngully: The Last Rainforest (1992) [COMING SOON]\n\nOnce Upon a Forest (1993) [COMING SOON]\n\nAnastasia (1997) [COMING SOON]\n\nThumbelina (1994) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Pagemaster (1995) [COMING SOON]\n\nMouse Hunt (1997) [COMING SOON]\n\nPaulie (1998) [COMING SOON]\n\nGalaxy Quest (1999) [COMING SOON]\n\nSmall Soldiers (1998) [COMING SOON]\n\nForever My Girl (2018) [COMING SOON]\n\nI Can Only Imagine (2018) [COMING SOON]\n\nAntz (1998) [COMING SOON]\n\nChicken Run (2000) [COMING SOON]\n\nShark Tale (2004) [COMING SOON]\n\nWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) [COMING SOON]\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002) [COMING SOON]\n\nStuart Little (1999) [COMING SOON]\n\nStuart Little 2 (2002) [COMING SOON]\n\nMuppets from Space (1999) [COMING SOON]\n\nThe Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland (1999) [COMING SOON]\n\nThomas and the Magic Railroad (2000) [COMING SOON]\n\nBarney's Great Adventures!

Many shows on ABC Family have episodes that either deal with teen-drinking (Boy Meets World and Still Standing) or teenage pregnancy (The Secret Life of the American Teenager). Freeform encourages concerned parents to control what their children watch. In fact, Freeform will always put up a Disclaimer on TV-14 programs and movies with disturbing images such as The Sixth Sense.\n\nDuring its time as ABC Family, Disney was considering changing the channel's name to XYZ to reflect the programming changes. It was long rumored that it could not due to an agreement with Robertson that \"Family\" should always remain the channel's name. ABC Family president Tom Ascheim debunked this rumor, however, when announcing the channel's rebrand Freeform in October 2015.\n\nRebrand as Freeform[]\n\nIn a December 3, 2014 article in Variety, reports suggested that ABC Family executives were proposing a reboot of the network that would occur in 2015 at the earliest, which included a renaming of the channel, a redesigned graphics package (replacing the one in use since 2006) or an expansion of programming that appeals more toward a millennial-skewing audience – as opposed to families or teenagers – among the options. During the channel's 2015–2016 upfront presentation on April 14, 2015, ABC Family executives announced that it would establish a focus on teenagers and young adults between the ages of 14 and 34 – group representatives termed \"becomers\", instead of the standard \"millennials\".\n\nOn October 6, 2015, Disney–ABC Television Group announced that ABC Family would change its name to Freeform on January 1, 2016, with the rebrand – which kicked off with an extensive branding campaign launched on that date of the announcement and will encompass the network's popular \"13 Nights of Halloween\" and 25 Days of Christmas\" blocks – coinciding with the winter premieres of the network's new and existing original series. Public assumption was that such a name change would be negotiably impossible due to an alleged stipulation enforced by CBN in sale agreements since the initial acquisition by International Family Entertainment that the channel contains the word \"Family\" in the name permanently, regardless as to who owns the network (as proven by the failed relaunch as XYZ); in the name change announcement, network president Tom Ascheim never made reference to the \"Family\" brand clause supposedly contained within the sale agreement, leaving it unclear as to whether or not the clause actually existed."
