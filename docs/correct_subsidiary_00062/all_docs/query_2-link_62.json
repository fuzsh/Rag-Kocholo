        "text": "So, since we’re coming up on one week since they did it, let’s talk about the new name for ABC Family, Freeform.\n\nAnd really my question is….really? Freeform? Out of all the names you could’ve possibly used for this new restructuring of your network, ABC Family, you decide to go with Freeform? What the hell does that even mean to your lineup?\n\nOkay, let’s talk about how we got to the name Freeform before we talk about why that’s a terrible name.\n\nThe network was founded in 1977 as the CBN Satellite Service, an extension of televangelist Pat Robertson’s Christian television ministry, and eventually evolved into a family-focused entertainment network as The Family Channel by 1990. In 1998, it was sold to News Corporation subsidiary Fox Family Worldwide. and renamed Fox Family. On October 24, 2001, Fox Family Channel and Fox Family Worldwide were sold to The Walt Disney Company, in a sale that also included Saban Entertainment; the channel altered its name to ABC Family on November 10 of that year. On October 6, 2015, Disney–ABC Television Group announced that the network would rebrand as Freeform, a change that took effect on January 12, 2016.\n\nNow, ABC Family had talked about changing the name for months up to the time they actually announced the new name change. Back in December 2014, ABC Family executives were proposing a reboot of the network that would occur in 2015 at the earliest, which included a renaming of the channel, a redesigned graphics package (replacing the one in use since 2006), or an expansion of programming that appeals more toward a millennial-skewing audience – as opposed to families or teenagers – among the options. During the channel’s 2015–16 upfront presentation on April 14, 2015, ABC Family executives announced that it would establish a focus on teenagers and young adults between the ages of 14 and 34 – a group representatives termed “becomers”, instead of the standard “millennials.”\n\nThe testing revealed that although regular viewers understood the network’s youth-skewing concept, non-frequent viewers perceived the channel as being more of a “wholesome” family-oriented network. Public assumption was that any name change that did not incorporate “Family” would be negotiably impossible due to a stipulation thought to have been placed by Pat Robertson in the original sale agreement during the network’s acquisition by Fox Entertainment Group – a stipulation that the channel’s name would forever contain the word “Family,” regardless as to who owns the network (as proven by the failed proposal to re-launch as “XYZ”). The stipulation was eventually dismissed as urban legend by network president Ascheim in announcing the rebrand to “Freeform”.\n\nNow to give ABC Family credit, I don’t mind them changing the name of their network because let’s be honest, ABC Family isn’t really a network for families anymore when you really think about it. In the last few years, they’ve definitely tried to steer clear away from the ‘family’ labeling with more darker shows such as Pretty Little Liars, Stitchers, Greek, and Lincoln Heights and on top of that, they’ve gone for adding movies that would be considered way out of what the usual audience for ABC Family would be by having raunchy R rated comedies like Bridesmaids and Bad Teacher airing, which…yeah, there’s a reason why they probably changed the name so people like me can stop calling them out for airing those movies on a network specifically centered around families. So, yeah, change the name around to better suit what you want to do with your network but choose a name that actually makes sense.\n\nThe word Freeform means not conforming to a regular or formal structure or shape which….okay, that pretty much sums up ABC Family in its’ last few years so maybe they were on to something but again, that name Freeform doesn’t have a lot of marketing potential to it for a network that has spent the last 18 years under the name of a major entertainment medium like ABC or Fox. Hell, one of the names they came up with was ABC XYZ, which you know what, would’ve been awesome, it perfectly fits and it makes sense. You have a company that is the first three letters of the alphabet and you have a second part that’s the last three letters of the alphabet, that name makes sense, not something as dumb as Freeform.\n\nBut here’s the worst part about this name change. Guess how many names they went with before they decided on Freeform and this…this just baffles me to no end. 3,000. That’s right, the marketing team at ABC Family passed on 2,999 other names before they decided on Freeform. Yeah, that just proves to me that the team behind the name change didn’t even bother to really think about what name was going to good enough to replace the name of ABC Family and said “Fuck it, what’s the shortest and simplest one? Freeform? Fuck it, that’ll be the new name.” That’s exactly what I think happened because that’s just how lazy that network has gotten in the last few years.\n\nNow for all I know, I could be totally wrong and this change from ABC Family to Freeform is actually the best thing that could happen to this network but you know what, I was saying the same thing when The Hub changed its’ name over to Discovery Family Channel and look at what happened there, they took one of the best new networks for kids and butchered it. So, unfortunately, the possibility is there that they’ll fuck up ABC Family again. So, sorry Freeform, I’m calling you ABC Family until you show me that you are definitely changing for the better."
