        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said former President Trump expressed interest in holding a future rally in Nassau County.\n\n\"President Trump did mention to me many times, as recently as a few weeks ago, that he would like to have a rally here in Nassau County,\" Blakeman said.\n\nHe made the comments on Eyewitness News Mornings @ 10 on Monday.\n\n\"I don't know if anything charges after what happened this weekend,\" Blakeman said, referring to likely increased security around Trump's events following his attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. \"My feeling is that President Trump will continue to be out with the people.\"\n\nBlakeman noted he was on the stage with Trump at the Bronx rally back in May.\n\n\"That was very poignant what I saw this weekend because I was standing next to the president in the South Bronx at a rally where people were very, very excited and happy that President Trump was there,\" he said.\n\nBlakeman is a delegate traveling to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee later this week.\n\nTrump has also mentioned interest in holding a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\n\nALSO READ: RNC 2024, recast by Trump assassination attempt, kicks off Monday\n\n----------\n\n* More Long Island news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube\n\nSubmit a tip or story idea to Eyewitness News"
