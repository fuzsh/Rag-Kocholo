        "text": "Paramount Global, formerly known as ViacomCBS Inc., is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate. It is controlled by National Amusements and is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company was formed on December 4, 2019, through the merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom.\n\nParamount Global owns various properties in the entertainment industry. Its main divisions include Paramount Pictures, the CBS Entertainment Group, media networks (such as MTV, Nickelodeon, BET, Comedy Central, VH1, CMT, Paramount Network, and Showtime), and streaming services (including Paramount+, Showtime OTT, and Pluto TV). The company also has an international division that manages international versions of its pay TV networks and owns region-specific assets in different countries. Some of Paramount Global's subsidiaries include Bellator MMA, Simon & Schuster (a publishing company), and VidCon (a conference for online video content creators).\n\nAs of 2022, Paramount Global has over 170 networks and reached approximately 700 million subscribers in 180 countries. The company generates revenue through various sources, including licensing, broadcasting, publishing, streaming, and television. On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS Inc. changed its name to Paramount Global. The company continues to be a major player in the media and entertainment industry, producing films, television programs, music, and books, and providing various services to consumers worldwide.\n\nParamount Global, formerly known as ViacomCBS, is an American media and entertainment conglomerate with a storied history that spans over a century. Established in 1914 as Paramount Pictures., the company quickly rose to prominence as a leading film studio, captivating audiences with exceptional cinematic offerings.\n\nIn 1929, Paramount Pictures, then a part of Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation, provided vital financial support to CBS Inc., a recently established entity known as Columbia Broadcasting System. This strategic alliance proved instrumental in CBS's growth as an entertainment company, particularly in the emerging domain of television broadcasting.\n\nIn 1966, Paramount Pictures underwent a change in ownership when Gulf + Western Industries acquired the studio. The acquisition led to the rechristening of the company as Paramount Communications, signifying its expanded scope beyond film production and distribution.\n\nRecognizing the evolving landscape of media consumption, CBS made a significant move in 1971 by establishing Viacom as a separate entity to oversee its growing portfolio of cable television channels. Viacom swiftly acquired notable brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon, and Showtime, positioning itself as a dominant force in the television industry.\n\nHowever, financial challenges prompted CBS to divest several properties in 1987, resulting in Viacom becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of National Amusements, Inc., a prominent media and theatre company owned by the Redstone family. Under the stewardship of National Amusements, Viacom continued to expand its reach and influence in the entertainment realm.\n\nIn a transformative move in 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Communications and its various divisions, including the renowned Paramount Pictures. This merger brought together two formidable entities, solidifying Viacom's position as a powerhouse with a diverse portfolio spanning film, television, and other entertainment ventures.\n\nMeanwhile, CBS Corporation embarked on its own trajectory when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1995. This transaction led to the establishment of CBS Corporation as a distinct entity, operating independently from Viacom.\n\nThe year 2000 marked a significant milestone as Viacom, under the leadership of its CEO Sumner Redstone, orchestrated a historic $35 billion acquisition of CBS Corporation, reuniting the two companies. This landmark merger created a comprehensive media entity with an extensive presence across television networks, cable channels, and film studios.\n\nHowever, recognizing the need for strategic autonomy, Viacom and CBS Corporation underwent a demerger in 2006, resulting in the formation of two distinct companies. Both entities remained under the control of National Amusements, Inc., with Paramount Pictures continuing to be a part of Viacom's operations.\n\nThe enduring connection between Viacom and CBS Corporation resurfaced in 2019, as the two entities decided to merge once again, reestablishing their collective strength and influence. The resulting conglomerate assumed the name ViacomCBS, embodying the rich heritage and shared legacy of the two brands.\n\nIn a subsequent rebranding effort in 2022, the company transitioned to Paramount Global, embracing the iconic Paramount brand and emphasizing its global reach. Headquartered in New York City, Paramount Global retains a strong foothold in the media and entertainment landscape, with a primary focus on film and television, including the rapidly growing streaming services sector.\n\nWith a diverse and extensive portfolio, Paramount Global continues to captivate audiences worldwide, delivering exceptional content that resonates with viewers across various platforms. Drawing upon its extensive history and expertise, the company remains at the forefront of the industry, navigating the ever-changing landscape of media and entertainment with innovation, creativity, and a commitment to excellence."
