        "text": "Disney Branded Television is an American television production company and a unit of Disney General Entertainment Content which oversees development, production and acquisition of content geared towards children, teenagers and families for Disney+, Disney Channel, Disney Jr. and Disney XD.[2] The unit also oversees Disney-branded unscripted series, documentaries and specials for Disney+ and the Disney channels.\n\nThis article is about the Disney unit responsible for producing content for children, adolescents and families. For the current Disney Imagineering live show unit that also formerly used the name, see Walt Disney Creative Entertainment.\n\nPrior to the formation of Disney Branded Television, Disney Channels Worldwide oversaw all Disney television networks until the organization of the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International segment on March 14, 2018, when the company was split into two. The U.S. unit operated Disney Channels, Radio Disney. The international unit operated various children and family-oriented TV channels around the world, including variations of the U.S. channels plus Disney International HD, Dlife, and Hungama TV.\n\nDisney Channel was originally established in the United States in 1983 as a premium channel, and has since converted to a basic service; in addition, Disney Channel's programming has also expanded internationally with the launch of various country-specific and regional versions of the channel, as well as program licensing agreements reached with television networks not bearing the Disney Channel brand."
