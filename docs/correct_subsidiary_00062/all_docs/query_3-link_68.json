We’re proud to offer employees workplace flexibility, extensive learning and development opportunities, and access to mentorship programs and events to enhance the employee experience and foster connections.\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nMichelle Green\n\nManager, Audience Impact & Intelligence\n\n\"Paramount's commitment to employee growth shines through its Education Reimbursement Program. This invaluable resource enabled me to pursue a Social Media program at Cornell University, a decision that has profoundly impacted my career trajectory. Through this opportunity, I didn't just acquire new skills; I discovered a passion for digital marketing that continues to drive me forward. Paramount's support doesn't just open doors; it empowers individuals to chart their own paths and thrive within the organization.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nGeiddy Muñoz\n\nManager, Integrated Marketing\n\n\"I’m proud to serve as one of the East Coast Chairs of Somos, Paramount’s Latine Employee Resource Group (ERG). This role has inspired me to be my most authentic self in everything I do. By adapting this philosophy, I have leaned into challenges, stepped outside my comfort zone, and developed creative solutions that drive results. One of the greatest benefits of being an ERG member is that you can connect with employees - at all levels - across the company and collaborate on meaningful projects and events. From fostering mentoring relationships to creating activations that impact our communities, Somos members tap into their leadership skills that further their career trajectory.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nBradley Archer-Haynes\n\nSVP of Cross-Company Impact\n\n\"I owe so much of becoming a family to the benefit that Paramount afforded me. Figuring out the path to parenthood can be difficult. Paramount enabled my husband and I to do that. It provided a structured and supportive environment, helping me understand the complex process. And Paramount's benefits—including financial assistance, legal support, and tailored family leave policies—played a crucial role in minimizing the challenges we faced.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nHope Tanhoff\n\nSVP, Total Rewards, Finance & Report\n\n\"My favorite Paramount benefit is Bright Horizons. From the crib to college, Bright Horizons was there when I needed back-up childcare for my young children, and now as I send my youngest off to college, we used all their college support resources like essay review and college selection. As a working mom, I have felt taken care of by Paramount’s benefits.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nBo Rottenborn\n\nSenior Manager, Strategic Partnerships\n\n\"I'm so grateful to work at a place like Paramount that prioritizes the well-being of its employees so much. Having free access to Headspace meditations and minute-long resets from Thrive is so beneficial to my mental health - and it seems like there are always webinars available on various topics. Plus, I love that The Wellness Studio offers so many classes.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nRebecca Martinez\n\nSenior Recruiter, Talent Acquisition\n\n\"Working at Paramount has been an incredible journey, one that's seen me through some major life milestones! From transitioning from Ms. to Mrs. to becoming a homeowner and even adding not one, not two, but three fur babies to my family, these past five years have been nothing short of transformative. What's made it all the more remarkable is being part of a company that doesn't just talk the talk but walks the walk when it comes to prioritizing employee well-being. With flexible hybrid schedules and unlimited PTO, Paramount empowers its teams to find that perfect equilibrium between professional fulfillment and personal life.\"\n\nEMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE\n\nJhané Harris\n\nEvent Marketing Manager\n\n\"Participating in Paramount's Mentoring Program has expanded my network within the company tremendously. Last year, I participated as a mentee, and I found the experience so valuable that I have decided to participate as a mentor. My mentor provided great advice when it came to navigating ambiguity that I was experiencing in my role and advocating for my career growth. As a result, I have significantly progressed towards my goals.\"\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT CAREER\n\nFIND YOUR NEXT CAREER\n\nJob Function\n\nAdministrative\n\nBusiness Development\n\nCommunications/PR\n\nCreative\n\nFacilities\n\nFinance/Accounting\n\nGeneral Business\n\nHuman Resources\n\nLegal\n\nMarketing\n\nOther\n\nProduction\n\nProgramming\n\nResearch\n\nSales\n\nTechnology\n\nJob Type\n\nFull-Time\n\nInternship\n\nPart-Time\n\nTemporary / Per Diem / Freelance (Non-Staff)\n\nLocation\n\nAmsterdam, NL\n\nBoston, MA\n\nBudapest, HU\n\nBuenos Aires, AR\n\nBurbank, CA\n\nChicago, IL\n\nDenver, CO\n\nFort Lauderdale, FL\n\nFort Worth, TX\n\nIselin, NJ\n\nLondon, GB\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nMunich, DE\n\nNashville, TN\n\nNew York, NY\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nPyrmont, NSW, AU\n\nRosario, AR\n\nSouthfield, MI\n\nStamford, CT\n\nStudio City, CA\n\nWarsaw, PL\n\nWest Hollywood, CA\n\nWest Sacramento, CA\n\ndiversity & inclusion\n\nParamount is committed to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.
