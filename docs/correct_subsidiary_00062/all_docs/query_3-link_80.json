        "text": "Melania Trump calls for the country to “ascend above the hate” after assassination attempt on husband\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump issued her first public response since her husband, former President Donald Trump, was wounded in a shooting at one of his rallies on Saturday, reflecting on what the incident means for her and her family while calling for the country to “ascend above the hate.”\n\nTrump expressed condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the shooting and called the shooter “a monster” while speaking fondly of her husband.\n\nTrump called on the country to tone down vitriolic rhetoric and promote unity, and implored voters to consider the personal sides and loved ones of politicians going forward.\n\n“This morning, ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence,” Trump wrote.\n\nHouse Intelligence chairman joins growing calls for congressional investigation into assassination attempt\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner has joined the growing calls for congressional oversight into the security failings that led to what the FBI said was an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday.\n\nTurner said he wants to get a better sense of how the shooter got onto the roof near the venue, what security failures took place and whether the shooter was involved with anyone else.\n\n“We have oversight scrutiny and responsibility,” Turner said. “We got to see yesterday the most unbelievable commitment of the Secret Service to protect former President Donald Trump’s life and … how they put their own life at risk. But at the same time, we also saw the failure of the overall broader net that is supposed to provide protection for the president.”\n\nTurner said he had not yet been briefed about the incident.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson on Sunday also joined the calls for congressional oversight hearings.\n\nJohnson, the former chair of the Senate Homeland Security committee, said the ongoing investigation into Saturday’s incident must happen first, and then, he said, the Department of Justice, US Secret Service and FBI must be “completely transparent,” as he claimed the law enforcement agencies had not been in the past, so that Americans can have “comfort that this has been fully investigated.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is vowing a “full investigation” of the shooting, featuring testimony from the Secret Service, DHS and the FBI.\n\n\"We were fixated\" on Trump, GOP Rep. Meuser recounts being front row at rally when gunfire erupted\n\nRepublican Rep. Dan Meuser was in the front row at former President Donald Trump’s rally on Saturday when gunfire erupted.\n\nMeuser told CNN that when he recognized the sounds as gunfire, he and his colleagues “fixated on the president.”\n\nSome Secret Service members approached the crowd, telling them to get down, while the majority of them were protecting Trump, the congressman from Pennsylvania said.\n\n“The president, amazingly, had the fortitude and strength of character to lift up his fist and let everybody know he was okay,” Meuser added. “That really calmed things. Then it became more controlled, and people felt they were going to be okay.”\n\nAt least one person was killed during the attack, and Meuser said that person was sitting about 15 or 16 rows behind him.\n\nOthers were injured, included Rep. Ronny Jackson’s nephew, who was hit in the neck, Meuser said.\n\n“I saw him. To the best of my knowledge, he is absolutely fine, but I was with him. I walked with him for a couple minutes into a back tent,” he said.\n\nBiden returning to White House earlier than planned\n\nPresident Joe Biden will return to the White House from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, earlier than planned, according to a statement from White House officials.\n\nBiden is scheduled to arrive at the White House at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, the statement said.\n\nHe was originally scheduled to stay in Delaware until Monday and fly directly to Texas for events. He is returning to the White House so he can continue to receive briefings from law enforcement, a senior administration official said.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nRFK Jr. reflects on JFK, RFK assassinations following Trump rally shooting\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F.

He added that they notified police in the vicinity and that officers “didn’t know what was going on.”\n\nCNN cannot independently verify his account.\n\nJohn Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said the testimony raises many “serious questions.”\n\nHere are the US presidents, former presidents and candidates who have survived assassination attempts\n\nFormer President Donald Trump fell to the ground Saturday, clutching his face after what sounded like gunfire at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nBlood could be seen on his face as he was carried away by Secret Service.\n\nMultiple presidents and former presidents and candidates for president have been attacked in US history, according to a CNN report from 2011 and a list of instances of political violence that includes attacks on senators, congressmen and governors compiled by CNN’s research library.\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson: In the pre-Civil War era, he was shot at while attending a funeral in the Capitol.
