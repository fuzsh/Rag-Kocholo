Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said Sunday that a staffer who made an inflammatory post about the assassination attempt of Donald Trump is “no longer in (his) employment.”\n\nA post on Facebook associated with the staffer’s account suggested the gunman needed shooting lessons “so you don’t miss next time.”\n\nTrump said he was shot in the ear during the shooting Saturday night.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger reported Sunday the post has since been deleted.\n\nCNN has reached out to the staffer for comment.\n\nTrump’s Secret Service protection was recently strengthened, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s Secret Service protection was strengthened recently, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nTrump was first granted Secret Service protection in November 2015, and expressed relief at the time.\n\nAt the rally on Saturday, the gunman was killed by Secret Service agents.\n\nNot yet clear what impact the shooting will have on RNC security plans\n\nIt’s not yet clear what impact Saturday’s shooting will have on security plans for the Republican National Convention, scheduled to begin Monday in Milwaukee, according to a source familiar with planning for the event.\n\nThe incident is being reviewed, the source added.\n\nReince Priebus, the convention’s committee chair – also a former Trump administration chief of staff – said on Saturday night that the event was going ahead, with guests already beginning to arrive in Wisconsin.\n\nAnd Trump is still planning to attend, say his advisors.\n\n“President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States,” said a joint statement from his campaign advisors and the convention chairs.\n\nCarter Center calls on \"all Americans to embrace civility\" following Trump rally shooting\n\nThe Carter Center, a nonprofit founded by former President Jimmy Carter, condemned violence and called for civility following the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\n“Our thoughts are with President Trump and all those affected by this horrific act, and we call on all Americans to embrace civility in our democratic processes,” the statement continued.\n\nButler mayor said Biden offered full support to city in wake of rally shooting\n\nButler Mayor Robert Dandoy told CNN he was offered full support from the White House in a conversation with President Joe Biden after the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s rally Saturday night.\n\nDuring their conversation, Dandoy said Biden offered his condolences to the city, located in western Pennsylvania.\n\n“He offered anything they can do for us, and I offered the same,” Dandoy told CNN.\n\nBiden also spoke with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Trump on Saturday, according to the White House.\n\nHere are the US presidents, former presidents and candidates who have survived assassination attempts\n\nFormer President Donald Trump fell to the ground Saturday, clutching his face after what sounded like gunfire at a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nBlood could be seen on his face as he was carried away by Secret Service.\n\nMultiple presidents and former presidents and candidates for president have been attacked in US history, according to a CNN report from 2011 and a list of instances of political violence that includes attacks on senators, congressmen and governors compiled by CNN’s research library.\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson: In the pre-Civil War era, he was shot at while attending a funeral in the Capitol. The shooter fired twice, but the gun failed.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt: Like Trump, he was trying to get his old job back during the 1912 campaign. He was shot on the way to a speech in Milwaukee by a saloon keeper.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt: He was president-elect when a would-be assassin fired at him in Miami in 1933. The shooter, Guiseppe Zangara, missed Roosevelt but killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak.\n\nPresident Harry Truman: He took over the presidency after Roosevelt died and was shot at across from the White House by Puerto Rican nationalists in 1950.\n\nAlabama Gov. George Wallace: The segregationist was running for president for the third time in 1972, and was shot after a campaign event outside Washington, DC. The shooting left him paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford: He faced two assassination attempts in quick succession in 1975.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan: He was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton in Washington, DC, after giving a speech. His press secretary, James Brady, was more seriously wounded than Reagan and later became an activist for gun control.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: An Idaho man was charged with the attempted assassination of Obama when he fired shots at the White House in 2011.\n\nFour presidents — Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy — have been assassinated.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee chair calls for Secret Service director to appear for a hearing\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said he has contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and is calling on Director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing.\n\nThe Oversight Committee will send a formal invitation soon, Comer said in a statement Saturday night.\n\nShooter fired multiple shots from \"elevated position\" outside of Trump rally, Secret Service says\n\nA shooter fired multiple shots from an “elevated position” outside of the Trump rally before United States Secret Service personnel “neutralized” the shooter, the law enforcement agency said.\n\n“During Former President Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on the evening of July 13 at approximately 6:15 p.m., a suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position outside of the rally venue,” the Secret Service statement said.\n\nSecret Service personnel “neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” the statement continued.\n\n\"I saw the immediate attack\" from front row, says Senate Republican candidate Dave McCormick\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Dave McCormick, who was sitting in the front row at Donald Trump’s rally Saturday, said he saw the “immediate attack on the president” and a person behind him who appeared to be severely injured.\n\nMcCormick told CNN on air that the former president had just invited him onstage, when about a minute later he heard “a serious of shots — about seven or eight shots — just ‘pop, pop, pop.’”\n\n“It was all of a sudden just chaos. The Secret Service immediately covered the president, jumped on top of him, and the crowd immediately went to the ground,” McCormick said.\n\nThe Senate candidate said he looked over his shoulder and “it was clear that somebody had been hit.” People around the person were trying to administer first aid, he said, as it took several minutes for medical assistance to get into the crowd because it was so dense.\n\nMcCormick said he and all of the roughly 15,000 attendees in the crowd went through metal detector screening before they entered the rally.\n\n\"We haven't seen this since Reagan,\" Butler County district attorney says\n\nButler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “We haven’t seen this since Reagan,” after the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\nWhen speaking about Butler County, which is north of Pittsburgh, Goldinger said: “You just wouldn’t even think it would happen—especially in, where I live in Butler County. You would not expect this.” ​\n\nAs for the scene, the DA said, “I have been told it is chaos, and I can’t even give you a number of people that are there … it is really crazy right now.”\n\n##Reaction##\n\nBiden attacks Trump over \"Project 2025,\" his court cases and verbal slips in blistering speech\n\nSpeaking before an enthusiastic crowd in Detroit on Friday night, President Joe Biden declared unequivocally that he was staying in the 2024 race and attacked rival Donald Trump in a number of new ways.\n\nIf you’re catching up on the speech, here were some of the key moments:\n\nBiden says he won’t step aside: “I am running and we’re going to win,” the president said to cheers and chants of, “Four more years” and, “Don’t you quit!” Biden said voters made him the nominee and, “I’m not going anywhere.” Outside the friendly confines of a rally, Biden is now engaged in an outreach campaign to key groups of lawmakers to convince them of the same thing.\n\nTying Trump to “Project 2025”: Biden sought to draw policy contrasts with Trump, directly tying him to the controversial conservative policy platform known as “Project 2025.” The president called the policy document — which Trump has distanced himself from — a “blueprint for the second Trump term that every American should read and understand.” He accused his rival of lying about his proximity to the project, saying it’s “run and paid for by Trump people.”\n\nHis rival’s sexual abuse case: Biden explicitly said that Trump raped a woman, reading from a judge’s ruling against Trump in the defamation case of E. Jean Carroll. “The judge in that case wrote, ‘Mr. Trump’s attempt to minimize sexual abuse, finding it frivolous. Mr. Trump raped her,’” Biden said. “That’s the judge’s language, not mine,” Biden added. “He raped her.”\n\nFirst 100 days in office: For the first time, Biden also laid out what his priorities would be for the first 100 days of his second term, which included codifying Roe v. Wade, making the child tax cuts permanent, expanding Medicare and Medicaid, raising the minimum wage and banning assault weapons.\n\nOn misspeaking: Biden pointed to Trump’s own verbal slips, the day after Biden faced scrutiny for calling Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky “President Putin” and referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as “Vice President Trump.” “I guess they don’t remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ‘Nancy Pelosi,’” Biden said, referring to an incident from the Republican primary.\n\nLengthy remarks: Biden stayed engaged with the crowd throughout the 36-minute appearance. He mostly spoke using a teleprompter but did seem to veer off script at several points in the speech.\n\nSen. Sanders tells Democrats to \"stop the bickering and nit-picking\" and back Biden\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont continued to urge Democrats to back President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, writing in a Saturday op-ed for The New York Times that he “may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate.”\n\nSanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been one of Biden’s critical allies in Congress since the 81-year-old president’s dismal debate performance last month spurred calls for him to step aside from the race. Sanders, along with fellow progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have offered the president lifelines this week, publicly backing him during one of the tensest moments of Biden’s political life.\n\nIn his op-ed, Sanders acknowledged his disagreements with Biden, including about the US’ support of Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, but said “too many Democrats” have focused “on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world.”\n\nSanders added: “With an effective campaign that speaks to the needs of working families, he will not only defeat Mr. Trump but beat him badly. It’s time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking.”"
