For 20-plus years, I have had the privilege of touching every aspect of the television business, and now seems the appropriate time to start the next chapter and explore some new avenues.”\n\nThe new unit will combine several existing distribution-focused departments under the leadership of Ben Pyne, who has been named President, Global Distribution, Disney-ABC Worldwide Television & Disney Media Networks, reporting to Ms. Sweeney and Alan Bergman, President, The Walt Disney Studios.
