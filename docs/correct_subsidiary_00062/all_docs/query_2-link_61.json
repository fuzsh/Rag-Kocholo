Conglom also plans eventually to rebrand Fox Kids international TV operations that come along in the transaction.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPrior to the transaction, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. and Haim Saban’s Saban Entertainment each had 49.5% stakes in Fox Family Worldwide, parent company both to Fox Family and the international assets.
