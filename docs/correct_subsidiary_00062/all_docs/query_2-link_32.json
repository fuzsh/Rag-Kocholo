        "text": "On January 2016, Abc Family will be changing to Freeform. it will focus on ''becomers'' 18-25, and not kids. changing the network's name from abc family to freeform is a big mistake. freeform sounds like a clothing line or a music channel like mtv and fuse. there wasn't a lot of family-friendly networks on tv.\n\nChanging the name removes the element that I saw the most important; family. all abc family care about is young adults and not kids and families. Trying to target to only teenage girls and trying to make it sexy doesn't make sense. i know they changed the name to appeal to millennials, but the millennials that i met don't like the new name. freeform will be a moneyloser for disney. freeform will be the dumbest name change since xfinity and syfy. abc family should get public input before changing the name.\n\nEver since they changed their name to Freeform all of their shows have lost viewers… Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters, Baby Daddy, and Young and Hungry which are all returning series are drastically down this winter in the amount of viewers. New Show Recovery Road hasn’t even pulled in an episode that had 500K viewers yet, the other new series Shadow hunters Premiered with 1.82 million viewers and last nights episode only had 0.84 viewers so its just about lost one million viewers. i'm calling the people of abc family to change back the name abc family.\n\nI petition that they keep their original name. freeform will be the biggest error since new coke. disney is a family-friendly company. Together, we can win this battle, but I need every single concerned person who feels the same way and care about the future of abc family.\n\nNow stand with me and I need you to do it today. there's is no time to waste, please sign the petition and tell somebody, text somebody, email somebody, tweet somebody. come on, get it on your facebook.\n\nPlease save ABC Family."
