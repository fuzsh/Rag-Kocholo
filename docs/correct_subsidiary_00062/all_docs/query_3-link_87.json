        "text": "7/21: Sunday Morning\n\nGuest host: Mo Rocca. In our cover story, Robert Costa looks at an unconventional week in the 2024 presidential race. Plus: Tracy Smith talks with doctors and activists working to help children wounded by the fighting in the Gaza Strip; Ted Koppel meets 90-year-old track star Florence Meiler, training for the decathlon; Jim Axelrod sits down with Bruce Springsteen to explore the creation of his classic 1982 album, “Nebraska”; Faith Salie goes in search of the secrets of elephants; Seth Doane profiles sculptor Jacopo Cardillo; and Josh Seftel talks with his mother, Pat, about her summer plans.\n\n01:10:45\n\nLatest Videos\n\nMeet 90-year-old track star Florence Meiler\n\nOne Olympic sport that has not been open to women is the 10-event decathlon, whose winner is crowned \"world's greatest athlete.\" (Women instead compete in the seven-event heptathlon.) But there are women athletes, young and older, who would like to see that changed. \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel meets Florence Meiler, a 90-year-old track star training for the USA Masters Combined Events Championship in Charlottesville, Va.; and with Lauren Kuntz and Sophie Knudson, decathletes who are part of a growing movement to overcome the one hurdle that keeps women from competing in the decathlon in international competition.\n\n10:06\n\nRock star: Sculptor Jago on unveiling humankind in marble\n\nThirty-seven-year-old sculptor Jacopo Cardillo, better known in his native Italy as Jago, has earned a following with his contemporary approach to this classical art form, exposing on social media his process of shaping marble. When he embraced a group of teens who'd defaced one of his works, Jago won a new fan touched by his humanity: Whoopi Goldberg. Correspondent Seth Doane talked with the artist about his most ambitious project yet: creating what will be a 6-ton sculpture more than 16 feet tall.\n\n05:04\n\nChildren of Gaza\n\nThe Palestine Children's Relief Fund has helped rescue more than 200 children from Gaza who are in need of medical treatment, including two-year-old Jood Damo, who was injured by an Israeli airstrike. Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with doctors about conditions in the Gaza Strip ever since Israel responded to Hamas' attack last October, and how children have become the overwhelming victims of violence. (Warning: Contains disturbing images.)\n\n10:14\n\nBruce Springsteen on the soulful voice behind \"Nebraska\"\n\nIn-between his chart-topping album \"The River\" and his classic \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" Bruce Springsteen recorded a collection of songs on a 4-track cassette recorder in a bedroom at his rented farmhouse – dark, mournful, and rough-hewn songs that reflected the upheaval in his life at a time of rising success. The resulting album, 1982's \"Nebraska,\" would be one of his most personal, and helped solidify his status as one of music's most soulful voices. Springsteen talks with correspondent Jim Axelrod about how \"Nebraska\" spoke to his evolution as a songwriter. Axelrod also talks with Warren Zanes, author of the new book, \"Deliver Me from Nowhere: The Making of Bruce Springsteen's 'Nebraska'.\" (This story was originally broadcast on April 30, 2023.)\n\n08:44\n\nSecrets of the elephant\n\nThere is a lot we're still learning about the magnificent elephant, a creature that became a political animal after satirist Thomas Nast used it in cartoons in the 1870s. Correspondent Faith Salie visits the exhibition \"The Secret World of Elephants,\" at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and checks out the pachyderms at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., to uncover some of the elephant's secrets, from its means of communication, to its trunk, \"the Swiss army knife of organs.\"\n\n05:26\n\nAn unconventional week in presidential politics\n\nThe impact of this past week's Republican National Convention - where wrestling stars and former critics came to honor former President Donald Trump, whose 1.5-hour acceptance speech dwelled on familiar grievances and left some attendees dozing - is up for debate. At the same time, President Joe Biden continued to resist calls from some Democrats and donors to drop out. CBS News chief election & campaign correspondent Robert Costa reports on signs of unity and disarray on the road to Election Day.\n\n06:33\n\nFrom the archives: Bob Newhart\n\nBob Newhart, whose observational humor and deadpan delivery raised his comedy albums and TV sitcoms to classic status, died on Thursday, July 18, 2024, at the age of 94. In this \"Sunday Morning\" profile that aired on November 3, 2002, the comedian, recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, talked with correspondent Rita Braver about his journey from accounting to standup. Braver also talks with the comic's co-stars Jane Curtin (\"The Librarian\") and Tom Poston (\"Newhart\") about Newhart's gifts.\n\n09:09\n\nHow the GOP was born\n\nOn March 20, 1854, in Ripon, Wisconsin, several dozen citizens, alarmed by the prospect of slavery spreading westward, gathered in a little white schoolhouse, a meeting widely believed to be the birthplace of the Republican Party. Correspondent Mo Rocca looks at how the Grand Old Party was formed and how it was dominant in presidential politics in the years following the Civil War, until Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression.\n\n04:55\n\nFrom the archives: Richard Simmons' advice on exercise\n\nFitness guru Richard Simmons, who helped millions lose weight by preaching the value of exercise and movement, died Saturday, July 13, 2024, at age 76. In this November 30, 2003 commentary recorded for \"Sunday Morning,\" Simmons offered his advice on dealing with holiday feasts, diets, and the benefits of \"moving and grooving.\"\n\n02:00\n\nHoppin' clams! \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" turns 25\n\nIn the 25 years since his debut on Nickelodeon, SpongeBob SquarePants, the animated character who lives in a pineapple under the sea, has also appeared in video games, three feature films, and even a Broadway musical. For the voice actors behind SpongeBob and other denizens of Bikini Bottom, the show – a gentle, silly reminder about the value of optimism and friendship – also reminds us of the kid inside us all. Lee Cowan reports.\n\n08:28\n\nBruce Springsteen on the poetry of his classic album \"Nebraska\"\n\nAn album of dark songs recorded in a bedroom at his rented farmhouse in 1982, reflecting the upheaval in his life in-between \"The River\" and \"Born in the U.S.A.,\" helped solidify Springsteen's status as one of music's most soulful voices.\n\nAn unconventional week in presidential politics\n\nThe real impact of the Republican National Convention - where wrestling stars and former critics came to honor former President Donald Trump - is up for debate. At the same time, President Joe Biden continued to resist calls from some Democrats and donors to drop out.\n\nArts\n\nRock star: Sculptor Jago on unveiling humankind in marble\n\nThirty-seven-year-old sculptor Jacopo Cardillo, better known in his native Italy as Jago, has earned a following with his contemporary approach to this classical art form, exposing on social media his process of shaping marble. When he embraced a group of teens who'd defaced one of his works, Jago won a new fan touched by his humanity: Whoopi Goldberg. Correspondent Seth Doane talked with the artist about his most ambitious project yet: creating what will be a 6-ton sculpture more than 16 feet tall.\n\n05:04\n\nA Henry Mancini tribute album\n\nIn honor of the composer's centenary next year, the family of Henry Mancini has been recording a tribute album featuring some of the Oscar- and Grammy-winner's most beloved music, performed by some of the most celebrated artists today. Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with flutists James Galway and Lizzo, who are putting their paws on the \"Pink Panther\" theme; and Michael Bublé, recording the song that Audrey Hepburn made famous, \"Moon River.\" (Originally broadcast on October 22, 2023.)\n\n07:50\n\nThe timeless fashion style of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy\n\nFrom the moment she first began appearing at the side of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette became one of the most photographed women in the world. Her personal style continues to have an impact 25 years following her death.\n\nFrom The Archives\n\nFrom 2002: Bob Newhart\n\nBob Newhart, whose observational humor and deadpan delivery raised his comedy albums and TV sitcoms to classic status, died on July 18 at the age of 94. In this profile that aired on November 3, 2002, the comedian, recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, talked with correspondent Rita Braver about his journey from accounting to standup. Braver also talks with the comic's co-stars Jane Curtin (\"The Librarian\") and Tom Poston (\"Newhart\") about Newhart's gifts.\n\n09:09\n\nProfiles\n\nJude Law on \"Firebrand\" and the actor's \"long game\"\n\nOscar-nominated actor Jude Law's latest role is King Henry VIII, opposite Alicia Vikander as the royal's sixth wife Katherine Parr, in the historical drama \"Firebrand.\" It's just one in a long line of tortured and textured characters he enjoys inhabiting; in fact, he tells correspondent Lee Cowan, it's part of the actor's \"long game\" to avoid being typecast as a heartthrob.\n\n08:38\n\nJune Squibb on her action-comedy debut in \"Thelma\"\n\nCorrespondent Mo Rocca talks with Academy Award-nominated actress June Squibb who, at age 94, is playing her first leading film role in the comedy \"Thelma,\" about a grandmother who seeks revenge against a scam artist. There are even chase scenes (on scooters)! Rocca also talks with the film's writer-director, Josh Margolin, and his gritty and tenacious grandmother, Thelma Post, who at 103 inspired the tale of a woman fighting for what's hers.\n\n06:27\n\nDoug Emhoff on the role of second gentleman\n\nAs husband of the first female U.S. vice president, and as the first Jewish person in his position, Doug Emhoff has taken a leading role in the Biden-Harris administration's fight against antisemitism and hate crimes.\n\nKevin Costner on his saga, \"Horizon,\" and a possible return to \"Yellowstone\"\n\nThe actor-director Kevin Costner won two Academy Awards for \"Dances with Wolves,\" and now the \"Yellowstone\" star is back with another western: \"Horizon: An American Saga,\" a four-part epic about pioneers settling the West.\n\nLuke Combs on his new album \"Fathers & Sons\"\n\nIn less than a decade, Luke Combs has topped Billboard's country airplay chart 17 times, and was named Entertainer of the Year twice by the Country Music Association.
