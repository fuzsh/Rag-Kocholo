        "text": "August 25, 2015\n\nLOS ANGELES – The Directors Guild of America today released its annual report analyzing the ethnicity and gender of directors hired to direct primetime episodic television across broadcast, basic cable, premium cable, and high budget original content series made for the Internet.\n\nMore than 3,900 episodes produced in the 2014-2015 network television season and the 2014 cable television season from more than 270 scripted series were analyzed. The breakdown of those episodes by the gender and ethnicity of directors is as follows:\n\nWomen directed 16% of all episodes, an increase from 14% the prior year.\n\nMinorities (male and female) directed 18% of all episodes, representing a 1% decrease over the prior year.\n\nPositive Trends\n\nThe pie is getting bigger: There were 3,910 episodes in the 2014-2015 season – a 10% increase in total episodes over the prior season's 3,562 episodes.\n\nWith that expansion came more directing jobs for women, who directed 618 total episodes representing a 21% year-over-year growth rate (women directed 509 episodes in the prior season), more than twice the 10% growth rate of total episodes. Additionally, the total number of individual women directors employed in episodic television grew 16% to 150 (up from 129 in the 2013-14 season).*\n\nThe DGA’s “Best Of“ list – shows that hired women and minorities to direct at least 40% of episodes – increased 16% to 57 series (from 49 series in the 2013-14 season period).\n\nAreas of Concern\n\nHiring of first-time episodic directors – which has a significant impact on the diversity of the overall hiring pool over time – perpetuated the status quo. There were 128 directors hired in the 2014-15 season who had never directed episodic television before. Of those, 84% were male – up from 80% in the 2013-14 season.\n\nMinorities directed a total of 694 episodes (up from 660 in 2013-14). While that reflects a 5% bump in episodes over the 2013-2014 season, the increase lags behind the 10% growth of total episodes.\n\nSix series made for subscription video on demand (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, and Playstation) appeared on the “Worst Of” list indicating that new platforms may be carrying through the same hiring practices as traditional television and cable networks.\n\nThere are 27 series with 0% women and minority hires on the DGA’s “Worst Of” list – 17% more than in the 2013-14 season.\n\n\"The uptick in the number of episodes directed by women – modest but hopeful – is just a drop in the bucket of what needs to be done by studios, networks and showrunners before we can begin to realize equal opportunities in television for our members. With so many more episodes and work opportunities, employers should seize the opportunity for diversity with their choices, especially when it comes to first-time episodic directors,\" said DGA President Paris Barclay. \"Without employers making a concerted effort to bringing a more diverse mix of new entrants to the hiring pool, we won’t see meaningful and lasting change.\"\n\n2014-2015 In Comparison With Previous Years\n\nComparing figures for 2014-2015 with figures from 2013-2014, this year’s report shows that:\n\nThe percentage of episodes directed by Caucasian males remained static at 69%;\n\nThe percentage of episodes directed by minority males decreased from 17% to 15%1\n\nThe percentage of episodes directed by Caucasian females increased from 12% to 13%; and\n\nThe percentage of episodes directed by minority females increased from 2% to 3%.\n\n1. It should be noted that there was a 3% increase in the hiring of minority males in the 2013-14 season that was entirely attributed to the high number of episodes directed by a single director: Tyler Perry. Perry directed 54 fewer episodes in the 2014-15 season, contributing to a 2% reduction in the number of episodes directed by male minorities.\n\nFirst-Time Episodic Directors in 2014-2015\n\nThe number of total individual directors who directed DGA-covered episodic television in 2014-15 increased 18% to 915 (776 directors in the 2013-14 season). Of those directors, 128 (14%) were directing episodic television for the first time. For the sake of perspective, it is important to note that first-time directors direct an average of one episode in their first season – which is considerably lower than established episodic directors.\n\nThe hiring of new episodic directors is a significant area of opportunity as it can impact the overall diversity of the hiring pool over time. However, hiring of female first-time episodic directors went down in the 2014-15 season – from 20% to 16% – indicating that even when it comes to new directors, those with responsibility for hiring are perpetuating the status quo.\n\nBreakdown by Series\n\nOut of 277 series examined, 61 series made it to the DGA’s “Worst Of“ list. Looking closer, 27 (10% of all series examined) hired no women or minority directors. Additionally, 34 more series (12% of all series examined) hired women or minorities to direct fewer than 15% of episodes. This means that more than 22% of all episodic television series made under a DGA contract had hiring statistics poor enough to land a spot on the DGA’s “Worst Of“ list (which can be found at the end of the report). Several of those series made repeat appearances for the 2014-2015 season, having also been placed on the DGA’s “Worst Of“ list the prior season including: The Blacklist, Boardwalk Empire, Dog With A Blog, The Exes, Girl Meets World, Granite Flats, Hot In Cleveland, It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Masters of Sex, Justified, Mom, Ray Donovan, Resurrection, Supernatural, Witches of East End, and Workaholics.\n\nTaking a deeper dive into a few examples underscores the severity of the issue, particularly when extended to series hiring over multiple years. The Showtime-produced Ray Donovan hired no women or minority directors in the 2014-15 season and has hired just one woman and no minorities in the 23 episodes since the series started. Another example of a series with an even longer history of poor hiring is the Warner Bros. produced Supernatural, demonstrating that in the last 10 seasons, the series has hired only three minority male directors, and two female directors, to direct just five out of 197 total episodes (3%). Another example of a long-running television series with years of non-diverse hiring is It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, which hasn’t hired a single female or minority director since the show began production in 2005 and has since completed ten seasons and a total of 115 episodes.\n\nLooking at the other end of the spectrum, 57 series (21% of all series examined) demonstrated a commitment to diverse hiring practices, hiring women or minorities to direct at least 40% of episodes. Fox-produced Empire hired nine women and minority directors to direct nine of its 11 episodes (82%). Well-established series such as Showtime's Homeland, over a four season stretch, hired women and minority directors to direct 19 of 47 total episodes (40%). One example of a series that made a dramatic turnaround from the DGA’s “Worst Of” list to the “Best Of” list is Fox-produced Last Man Standing, which in the 2013-2014 season hired no female or minority directors. The series demonstrated a notable change in the 2014-2015 season hiring two minority directors to direct nine episodes and thereby improving their season-to-season statistics from 0% to 41%.\n\nThe following 19 television series made the DGA’s “Best Of” list again this year for hiring women and minorities to direct at least 40% of episodes in the 2014-2015 production cycle: Awkward, Devious Maids, The Following, The Fosters, The Game, Getting On, Girls, Grimm, Hart of Dixie, Hit The Floor, Homeland, Instant Mom, Lab Rats, The Middle, Modern Family, Nashville, Pretty Little Liars, See Dad Run, and Suits.\n\n“In our diversity work at the DGA, we hear a lot of reasons from studios, networks and series showrunners about why they are powerless to make a change when it comes to diverse hiring. It’s time for everyone to look closely at exactly how hiring decisions are made, and for employers to take ownership and develop plans outlining the steps they will take to bring their hiring practices into the twenty-first century,” said Bethany Rooney and Todd Holland, co-chairs of the DGA’s Diversity Task Force, in a statement.\n\nBest Of and Worst Of\n\nThe shows highlighted below are from major production companies ABC, CBS, Fox, HBO, NBC, Sony, Warner Bros. and other production companies whose shows appear on broadcast, basic cable, and premium cable networks as well as high-budget original content shows made under a DGA agreement for the Internet.\n\nPilots are not included in the statistics.\n\nAdditional data on the more than 277 series included in this year’s report can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nBelow are the shows with the worst records of hiring women and minority directors for the 2014-2015 television season. Shows that are BOLDED also appeared on the DGA’s “Worst Of” lists last year:\n\nSHOWS THAT HIRED WOMEN OR MINORITY DIRECTORS FOR FEWER THAN 15% OF EPISODES (SOME OF THESE SHOWS DIDN’T HIRE A SINGLE WOMAN OR MINORITY ALL SEASON)\n\nTitle (Network/Studio/Production Company) – % of Episodes by Women or Minority Directors:\n\nWORST LIST\n\nBanshee (Home Box Office, Inc./Cinemax/Home Box Office, Inc.) – 0%\n\nBlack Sails (Starz Pirates Productions, LLC/Starz!/Starz, LLC) – 0%\n\nBoardwalk Empire (Home Box Office, Inc./HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.) - 0%\n\nThe Brink (Home Box Office, Inc./HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.) - 0%\n\nThe Comeback (Home Box Office, Inc./HBO/Home Box Office, Inc.) - 0%\n\nThe Comedians (TVM Productions, Inc./FX/Fox Television Studios, Inc.) - 0%\n\nDominion (Universal Network Television LLC/Syfy/Universal Network Television LLC) - 0%\n\nThe Exes (King Street Productions Inc./TV Land/Hudson Street Productions, Inc., a subsidiary of MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International, Inc.) - 0%\n\nThe Expanse (Expanding Universe Productions, LLC/Syfy/Alcon Television Group, LLC) - 0%\n\nFlesh and Bone (Starz Ballet Productions, LLC/Starz!/Starz Ballet Productions, LLC) - 0%\n\nGalavant (Film 49 Productions, Inc./ABC/ABC, Inc.) - 0%\n\nGracepoint (Concord Productions, Inc./FOX/Concord Productions, Inc) - 0%\n\nGranite Flats (Remnant Pictures LLC/PBS/Remnant Pictures LLC) - 0%\n\nHenry Danger (Uptown Productions Inc./Nickelodeon/MTV Networks, a division of Viacom International, Inc.) - 0%\n\nIt's Always Sunny In Philadelphia (Sunny Television Productions, Inc./FXX/Sunny Television Productions, Inc.) - 0%\n\nMan Seeking Woman (Minim Productions, Inc./FXX/Minim Productions, Inc.) - 0%\n\nMarco Polo (Siggco Inc./Netflix/Siggco Inc.) -0%\n\nMasters of Sex (Remote Broadcasting, Inc./Showtime/CPT Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Television) - 0%\n\nMom (Warner Bros.

Similarly, foreign series shot abroad with a significant number of episodes that were not covered by a DGA agreement were also not included in the lists above, but the episodes that were made under a DGA agreement were included in the overall statistics. The shows that meet either criteria include: The Big Bang Theory, Big Time in Hollywood Florida, Intruders, The League, Narcos, One Bad Choice, The Real Husbands of Hollywood, The Red Road, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll, Reign, Silicon Valley, Transparent, Two And A Half Men, and Undateable.\n\nDGA Diversity Efforts\n\nAt the DGA, we believe storytelling should be as diverse as the world around us, and that a critical mass of different perspectives on screen is vital for the wellbeing and development of society. We’re committed to realizing the vision of a diverse and inclusive industry, and have worked toward this goal for decades.\n\nWe seek to wield our influence and utilize our collective bargaining power, relationships and resources to try to change industry practices. Currently, we employ a four-pronged approach to advance the issue: (1) engage with industry decision-makers; (2) negotiate with employers; (3) develop networking, career enhancement and training opportunities; and (4) report back to the industry.\n\nFor more information about the DGA’s diversity efforts, CLICK HERE.\n\nAdditional Data\n\nClick the links below to download PDF spreadsheets of the full DGA Episodic Diversity Report organized by specific criteria:\n\nReport by % of Episodes Directed by Women & Minorities (PDF)\n\nReport by % of Episodes Directed by Women (PDF)\n\nReport by % of Episodes Directed by Minorities (PDF)\n\nReport by Show Title (PDF)\n\nReport by Signatory Company (PDF)\n\nReport by Studio (PDF)\n\nReport by Network (PDF)\n\nFor any questions regarding the data included in these spreadsheets, please contact Lily Bedrossian at 310-289-5333 or email lbedrossian@dga.org.\n\nCLICK HERE to download a copy of this report as a PDF.\n\n*An earlier version of this report showed that Veep had 40% of episodes directed by women and minorities – now updated to 60% in the \"Best Of\" list due to additional data.
