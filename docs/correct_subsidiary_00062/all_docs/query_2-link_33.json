        "text": "I have to say The Hub. Fox Family had potential based on Fox Kids' already existing library of shows, but suffered from a lineup of reruns and imports, which would probably have been fine (this was back when cartoons made specifically for cable were considered the exception, not the rule) if said imports were worth watching. But nope. At best, we got forgettable fare like Angela Anaconda, while at worst, we got awful, unwatchable dreck like Mega Babies. While I don't consider ABC Family a real improvement, I don't feel too bad that its direct predecessor flopped.\n\nThe Hub had a similar lineup, but also had actual, honest-to-God original series to back it up, and ones people would willingly watch at that. The reruns also contained such beloved series as Batman, Animaniacs, and whatever cartoons Hasbro had on hand, even if it was ultimately their undoing.\n\nOverall, while both ended for similar reasons, I gotta go with The Hub.\n\nIt's close, but I'd have to give the nod to The Hub. The channel had a very strong and promising start. For the first 2 years, I really thought that The Hub had staying power and would eventually turn the kid-vid channel Trinity (Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel) into a quartet. However, after My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic became a success and spawned a unexpected adult fan following, Hasbro not only became complacent with that shows success and didn't try to launch any more new series unless it was to try and copy MLP's success such as acquiring Care Bears: Welcome to Care-A-Lot (which was a pretty blatant attempt to reppeat the Brony phenomenon) and especially Animaniacs, but they actually believed that they could build an entire schedule around MLP and A! reruns. The Hub's over reliance on Ponies, Pets and nostalgia ultimately became the channel's undoing.\n\nAs for Fox Family, that channel likewise had potential, even if FF didn't have a lot of memorable original programs it did at least have much of the Fox Kids library at it's disposal. What ultimately did Fox Family in (besides a generally mediocre lineup) was the fact that FOX had to share the channel with Pat Robertson's former Family Channel team, and the 2 companies were constantly at odds with each other over the channel's content and direction.\n\nThe Hub, if they had stayed on the path they were on their first year. Had Hasbro not fumbled the ball so hard by failing to support their original and exclusive productions like The Aquabats' Super Show!, Dan VS, The Twisted Whiskers Show and Cosmic Quantum Ray and eventually just giving up on trying to bring in original and contemporary productions altogether, by failing to generate original content for prime time and instead opting to run the same 12 movies every night and expecting reruns of Happy Days to carry them through the night when it's been proven that oldies don't attract mass audiences (a BIG mistake to make in prime time), by thinking that My Little Pony alone was enough to sustain them, by axing diverse programming blocks like Hub-Bub and HuBoom! (though the former was no big loss since the preschool market is pretty much saturated and said block wasn't getting huge ratings in the first place) and by shamelessly pandering to the Brony/nostalgic adult crowd by touting 3rd party reruns of Animaniacs as the Holy Grail and intentionally trying to promote Care Bears: Welcome to Care-A-Lot as their next would-be Brony phenomenon, then The Hub would've been well on its' way to standing alongside the Big 3.\n\nWith Fox Family, the potential was defintiely there, they had the whole Fox Kids library at their disposal at the time, but the channel's shows, both originals and imports, just weren't very good or memorable. What killed Fox Family was simply that they offered nothing that was worth rushing home to see.\n\nI wish I could've watched Fox Family more when it was still around. I was only able to watch it during the summer when I was in the States. Then again, I don't recall liking much of what it aired (Medabots, Tokyo Pig, Kids of Room 402). I do remember being shocked when I tuned in one day and Fox Family became ABC Family.\n\nAs for the Hub, though I liked their programming, I never thought it could truly compete against the Big Three.\n\nSo in short, I don't think either could. I think the only company that can come close to competing with the Big Three is media DHX.\n\nWhile I've only seen Fox Family out of the two, I think that The Hub had more potential as well. They had a pretty good lineup of shows and having one of their own series being such a huge hit definitely gave them an edge, but it seemed poorly handled after the first year or so. If they wanted to make it a big name like Cartoon Network, as I remember reading that in an article somewhere, then they really couldn't even compete against the likes of Disney XD. With better planning and pushing for the channel to become more widely available, it could have been more successful and lasted longer at least.\n\nI remember watching some of the shows on Fox Family. There were some shows that I really liked such as Monster Rancher, Flit the Time Detective, and Big Wolf on Campus. I think that it also had potential to at least last longer than it did, but I think it needed more shows to draw in more of a crowd. Although, I really miss Jetix more than Fox Family. Before it took over Toon Disney to become its own channel, I really enjoyed the block. They had some really cool shows and it was something different. Once that was gone, ABC Family wasn't really as fun to watch for me. Aside from some movies they air, especially around Halloween and Christmas, I don't watch the channel that much anymore.\n\nThe Hub easily. Fox Family, what little I've seen, wasn't all that appealing. Donkey Kong Country wass in the \"so bad it's good\" territory, but nowhere near Mario Super Show levels, Angela Anaconda was irritating, and Mega Babies...I'd rather not talk about it. I mean, it was nice to see Eek! the Cat and The Tick again, but it still wasn't worth swimming through the trash to get to it. ABC Family is better, I guess, but I only watch the channel for whenever a movie I like airs, but my sisters like Pretty Little Liars and Switched at Birth, so it's doing something right.\n\nHub at least had original shows, and while I really only watched My Little Pony and Dan Vs., it at least had some sort of effort in trying to be a new kids network with shows that weren't just Canadian or European acquisitions, or reruns of TV shows that ended years ago. Oh, they were there, but one could blame it on being a brand new channel. The real issue was a combination of Discovery and Hasbro issues, a huge favoritism towards My Little Pony, and said acquisitions and reruns leaving for either more acquisitions and reruns, or generic borefests for kiddies. Discovery Family seems much worse, and I really doubt this channel will last long.\n\nBoth had great potential and fumbled a LOT, but The Hub had a better launch, while Fox Family had a better finisher. You could say The Hub had the edge on animated girl shows that weren’t for preschoolers, but aside from MLP and it’s clones, The Hub didn’t really have much in that direction(and you could argue that they can be classified as preschool shows). Fox Family, meanwhile, had Braceface, Totally Spies(for like a week before becoming ABC Family), and Angela Anaconda(to some extent), so they have the edge there. The Hub has the edge on adult animation with Dan Vs.(Fox Family made plans that never went anywhere before the rebrand, but the closest they got was Committed, which was this close to airing), and action shows with Transformers and G.I. Joe(Fox Family had Digimon and Ghostbusters, but those were reruns). They also had better live action, but it was a closer call(Aquabats and Haunting Hour vs Big Wolf on Campus, Zack Files, and S Club). Same with classic cartoons(Hub’s Animaniacs and Tiny Toons vs. FF’s Ghostbusters and Harveytoons) and sitcoms(Happy Days and ALF vs Partridge Family and Weird Science), but The Hub depended on them too much. They also shared several shows(Goosebumps, Mork and Mindy, Step by Step, The Wonder Years). All in all, I say The Hub, but Fox Family was just a step behind, and honestly had a better chance of succeeding.\n\nThe Hub. No contest there.\n\nThe Hub had so much potential to become the next big kids TV network like CN, Nick, and Disney, but due to corporate mismanagement at Discovery and Hasbro, and lack of direction of the network between 2010-2012 and 2013-2014 when they became Hub Network, The Hub fell too short on what could've been.\n\nIt also doesn't help that they become too reliant on MLP and nostalgic sitcoms for their own good rather than pushing their brand forward with their 2010 launch slate.\n\nIf you want more information about the downfall of The Hub Network, then go check out the article back in 2015 by AdWeek and figure out just what went wrong.\n\nThe Rise and Fall and Rise of Hasbro's TV Strategy\n\nI'm not too familiar with Fox Family besides it's existence, but I heard their lineup wasn't all the good.\n\nIt's quite informative to know the evolution of Freeform...which I always thought was a new channel Disney/ABC created. I now know what happened to ABC Family.\n\nPlus, not to mention this somehow links to how Disney, for a while, owned Saban. My favorite era of Disney on Power Rangers alone, even though I was more likely to tune into Kids WB!, 4KidsTV, and PBS Kids.\n\nUnless there's a more comprehensive list of programming for FOX Family, I'm going with the most recent option here. The Hub was Hasbro's channel and that was probably the most enticing development of any family/kid network. A toy company was running a tv channel. Almost every original show was obviously a commercial for their toys.\n\nAnd...they were actually good, consistently better than most of Discovery Kids back catalogue and even their contemporaries' lineups (yes, that includes the rebooted Pound Puppies). That unfortunately didn't last that long because those earlier shows were gone one way or the other. The next generation (1-3 years later) was back to the feeling you get watching the Big 3's offshoots or Discovery Kids or at the absolute worst DiC/Wild Brain productions, where there wasn't even a budget/decent writers to speak of yet they still bothered making them. A year later the Hub was no longer and Disc Family is down to just new Transformers and Ponies.\n\nI keep thinking what if the Hub expanded to included other toy brands. Getting distribution rights for their competitors' original content? If that happened, how could this hub not be a total juggernaut, especially given how well its competitors' have exploded their media empires since the 2010s by comparison.\n\nwell i feel fox family had potienal because their fox kids shows on it and fox family is owned by 20th century fox (at least fox owned fox family worldwide with haim saban at the time), if fox has bought saban stake in the joint venture fox family could been the big kids network and complete with nick, disney, and cartoon network and fox wouldnt give up children television animation to focus on more adult animated series and blue sky\n\nthe hub didnt worked in my opinion because discovery is only caring about everything else like oprah winfrey network, if hasbro teams up with a studio like how 20th century fox fox and haim saban did for fox family with a studio later buying hasbro stake in the network, it would been more better\n\nthe problem for these 2 channels is that they joint ventures\n\nReally I think the only weakness with Fox Family's lineup, was its original animation. If they could've just fixed that, while also building on its anime and live-action lineups. The channel had the potential to be the best of Disney, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon rolled into one.\n\nYeah, I can see that.\n\nBTW, since your here on this topic, what's your opinion on The Hub and Fox Family and which one do you think it has the most potential and what should you do to fix it?\n\nAlso, do you think that either The Hub or Fox Family could make a comeback as a streaming service or just released their own content in pre-existing streaming services?"
