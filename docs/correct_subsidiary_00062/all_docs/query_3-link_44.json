        "text": "False Security in Diversity\n\nAs you flip through 3000 channels, listen to numerous radio stations, and cruise around the Internet – you may be thinking how great it is to have access to so many different ideas and shows. It is like going to the supermarket and having access to 100s of different kinds of cereal. Great! Except you look closer at the box and realize, the vast majority of those cereals are owned by 3 companies: General Mills, Kellogg’s & Post. Wait, 75% of all soft drinks are owned by Coke & Pepsi as well. What is going on here!?\n\nThe truth is that through years of mergers and acquisitions, very few powerful media corporations control the vast majority in almost every market. Media is no different. That same company that produces great children films probably produces the trashy movies as well – just under a different name. What is your favorite movie? Favorite TV Show? Favorite children film? Favorite Sports radio station? Don’t be surprised if it is all owned by the same company.\n\nUS Media Controlled by the Big 6\n\nThe U.S. media landscape is controlled mostly by six massive media corporations: General Electric, Walt Disney, News Corp., Time Warner, Viacom, & CBS. These six media corporations control most of what we hear, read, and see. Our perceptions, worldviews and our culture is dictated by the message portrayed by a few corporations. With so much influence and control it is very easy to capitalize on such influence to market products, create desires we never had, influence our emotions and ultimately use it all to make huge profits.\n\nIs that thought scary? Is it to much to think companies control media messaging for maximum profit? Chime in and let us know in the comments!\n\nJust to note, there are other big media companies who are big players in particular media markets (ex. Cox, Bertelsmann), but these six are easily the biggest both in terms of profits and sweeping influence. These companies are vertically integrated, meaning they control everything from production to distribution.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nZondervan – The largest Christian publishers, including the vast majority share of the “Bible” is owned by News Corp. Every time someone purchases a bible, the #1 bestseller in history, News Corp profits.\n\nLet us know what you think about these media facts!\n\nDid you know that six companies controlled most of media?\n\nDid any of the facts shown below surprise you?\n\nWhat is your biggest concern with a few companies controlling and dictating the vast majority of media?\n\nLet us know in the comments!\n\nSnapshot of the Big 6’s Control over Media\n\nGENERAL ELECTRIC\n\n2008 Revenues: $183 Billion\n\nSample Ownership: NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, Telemundo, USA, A&E, Universal Pictures, NBC.com, CNBC.com, iVillage.com, and Hulu.com (joint venture with News Corp).\n\nTV – Television networks: NBC Networks, Telemundo, Ion Media (partial stake).\n\nTV – Cable: NBC Entertainment, NBC News, NBC Sports, NBC Television, NBC Universal, CNBC, CNBC World (Arabia, India, Asia, Europe), MSNBC, Bravo, Sci Fi Channel, Telemundo, USA, Oxygen, Weather Plus, Mun2, Sleuth, Chiller, Universal HD, A&E Networks (25%; includes A&E, the History Channel, History en español, the Biography Channel, Military History Channel, Crime & Investigation Network, A&E HD, the History Channel HD, History International), the Weather Channel (partial), Sci-Fi Channel HD.\n\nTV – Production and distribution companies: NBC Universal Television Distribution, Universal Media Studios\n\n26 television stations, owned under the “NBC Universal” division.
