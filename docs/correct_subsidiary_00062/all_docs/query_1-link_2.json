        "text": "Background\n\nABC Family was a (formerly) family-oriented network owned by Disney-ABC Television Group, launched on November 10, 2001 after their acquisition of Fox Family. On August 14, 2007, ABC Family launched a production company ProdCo, Inc., which produces original scripted series. The company announced in October 2015 that ABC Family would be renamed Freeform, which took place in January 2016.\n\n1st Logo (2002-April 10, 2006)\n\nVisuals: On a green background, there is the ABC Family logo zoom in.\n\nTechnique: Simple computer animation from PMcD Design.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Appeared on Falcon Beach and Wildfire.\n\n2nd Logo (June 22, 2003-August 7, 2006)\n\nVisuals: On a green background, there is a asterisk rapidly flashing black and white. It then disappears to become the ABC logo, but slightly tilted. The logo moves slightly to the left so the words \"family\" like before can appear one by one also tilted.\n\nVariant: On some of their TV movies, the logo is shortened to the point where the ABC logo appears on screen.\n\nTechnique: Simple computer animation from PMcD Design.\n\nAudio: Silence, or the end theme of the show/TV movie, or a guitar theme.\n\nAudio Variant: On This Time Around, the WildRice Productions logo's audio (which consists of birds singing and chirping) plays over this logo.\n\nAvailability: Seen on the channel's original movies and series from the period like This Time Around and Switched! (not to be confused with one of the channel's original series Switched at Birth).\n\n3rd Logo (August 7, 2006-January 12, 2016)\n\nVisuals: There is a white background. First, there is the orange words \"a new\", \"kind\", \"of\" and \"family\" writing themselves in letter by letter and taking four lines under each other. Then it is followed by close-up of the white letters \"f\", \"a\" and \"m\", while the background turns orange. The ABC logo pops up and \"family\" writes itself in at the right side, along with the byline \"a new kind of family\". There is a reflection underneath. The logo zooms out.\n\nVariants:\n\nAt the end of ABC Family's original shows and TV movies, \"a new kind of family\" at the bottom is replaced by \"an original presentation of\" at the top of the logo.\n\nA still version exists.\n\nTechnique: CGI by SPILLT.\n\nAudio: An electric guitar with drums playing rock music, composed by Dan Foliart. The ending theme of the show/TV movie may be also used, or sometimes none.\n\nAvailability: The logo with the aforementioned byline appears before self-produced shows on ABC Family, such as Kyle XY, The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Pretty Little Liars, and Switched at Birth; it also appears as a home media logo on those DVDs released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment, in place of the latter's logo. It also appears before ABC Family programming on demand. This appears on the Disney+ print of 12 Dates of Christmas.\n\n4th Logo (2015)\n\nVisuals: The screen cuts in to a close-up of the ABC Family logo in orange, then cutting to \"fam\", closeups of the logo and at far away angles, then returns to the regular position.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation.\n\nAudio: An EDM-like theme corresponding to the cutting.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Becoming Us."
