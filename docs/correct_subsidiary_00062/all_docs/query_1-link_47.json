        "text": "Where ‘Modern Family’ is popular\n\nWhere ‘Modern Family’ is popular\n\nWhere ‘Duck Dynasty’ is popular\n\nWhere ‘Empire’ is popular\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nIf you had to guess how strongly a place supported Donald J. Trump in the election, would you rather know how popular ‘Duck Dynasty’ is there, or how George W. Bush did there in 2000? It turns out the relationship with the TV show is stronger.\n\nWhen we looked at how many active Facebook users in a given ZIP code “liked” certain TV shows, we found that the 50 most-liked shows clustered into three groups with distinct geographic distributions. Together they reveal a national culture split among three regions: cities and their suburbs; rural areas; and what we’re calling the extended Black Belt — a swath that extends from the Mississippi River along the Eastern Seaboard up to Washington, but also including city centers and other places with large nonwhite populations.\n\nIn the 1960s and ’70s, even if you didn’t watch a show, you at least probably would have heard of it. Now television, once the great unifier, amplifies our divisions.\n\nThis reflects the business of television as much as it does a fracturing national culture. In the past, notes James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for The New York Times, big network shows like “The Beverly Hillbillies” “reflected a business where sheer audience numbers were more important.” Now, advertising money is driven less by volume and more by demographics. You make more ad money, Mr. Poniewozik explains, by appealing to younger, more affluent, urban viewers.\n\nStill, there are shows that find broader appeal. We’ve created a fandom map for each of the top 50 shows, ranked in order of the difference between their highest and lowest fan percentages. As you get deeper in the page, you’ll find the shows with more consistent popularity — points of unity in a splintering culture.\n\n1.Duck Dynasty\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nMen with long beards and Christian values center the most geographically divisive show in the data set. “Duck Dynasty,” a reality show on A&E, follows the over-the-top lives of a Louisiana family that makes the Duck Commander duck call.\n\nIt is the prototypical example of a show that is most popular in rural areas. The correlation between fandom and the percentage of people who voted for Mr. Trump was higher for “Duck Dynasty” than it was for any other show.\n\nMost Similar\n\nFast n’ Loud\n\nThe Voice\n\nPawn Stars\n\nLeast Similar\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nSouth Park\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\n2.Love & Hip Hop\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nVH1’s “Love & Hip Hop” showcases real hip-hop and R&B musicians in several American cities. It is most popular in the Black Belt. Over all, the share of black and Native American residents in a county account for 90 percent of the variation in the level of “Love & Hip Hop” fandom. Controlling for the share of black and Native American residents, the show is especially popular in Humphreys County in Mississippi, and least popular in Prince George’s County in Maryland.\n\nMost Similar\n\n106 & Park\n\nEmpire\n\nThe First 48\n\nLeast Similar\n\nPawn Stars\n\nDeadliest Catch\n\nMythBusters\n\n3.NCIS\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“NCIS” is a police procedural on CBS about a team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Similar to “Criminal Minds,” another police procedural, it is most popular in rural areas.\n\nA Forbes article about Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, said that the Trump campaign may have specifically targeted “NCIS” viewers. It said data analysis “drove the scaled-back TV ad spending by identifying shows popular with specific voter blocs in specific regions — say, ‘NCIS’ for anti-Obamacare voters or ‘The Walking Dead’ for people worried about immigration.”\n\nMost Similar\n\nCriminal Minds\n\nPawn Stars\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\nLeast Similar\n\nEmpire\n\nFamily Guy\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians\n\n4.The Voice\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“The Voice,” a singing competition, is most popular in North Dakota and least popular in New York. It was behind only “Duck Dynasty” and “Fast N’ Loud” in its correlation with Trump voters.\n\nMost Similar\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\nFast n’ Loud\n\nPawn Stars\n\nLeast Similar\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nSo You Think You Can Dance\n\nModern Family\n\n5.The Daily Show\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“The Daily Show,” Comedy Central’s news satire and talk show, typically has a politically liberal point of view. It’s most popular in cities and other more liberal-leaning areas along the coasts. Peak popularity is in San Francisco; it’s least popular in Alabama.\n\nMost Similar\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nModern Family\n\nLeast Similar\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\n16 and Pregnant\n\nTeen Mom\n\n6.106 & Park\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“106 & Park,” on BET, used the classic radio countdown formula to showcase hip-hop and R&B music videos. The show was canceled in 2014, but it remains a popular digital-only brand. The show is popular in the Black Belt, generally. You can also see an increase in the show’s popularity on Indian reservations in South Dakota and Arizona, a pattern that repeats itself in several of the maps.\n\nMost Similar\n\nLove & Hip Hop\n\nEmpire\n\nReal Housewives of Atlanta\n\nLeast Similar\n\nRob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory\n\nDeadliest Catch\n\nMythBusters\n\n7.Modern Family\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“Modern Family” is an ABC mockumentary about an extended and blended Los Angeles family. Jay Pritchett’s family includes his much younger second wife; his cerebral stepson; his two neurotic adult children, one a gay man with a family of his own; and their spouses and children. The show has won many Emmy Awards over its eight-season run, including for outstanding comedy five seasons in a row.\n\nIts audience pattern is the prototypical example of a city show — most popular in liberal, urban clusters in Boston, San Francisco and Santa Barbara, Calif., and least popular in the more rural parts of Kentucky, Mississippi and Arkansas.\n\nMost Similar\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nThe Daily Show\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nLeast Similar\n\nTeen Mom\n\n16 and Pregnant\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\n8.Family Guy\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“Family Guy” is an animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane that sends up American culture. Like many satirical comedies on our list, it is most popular in cities. The show’s popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show.\n\nMost Similar\n\nSouth Park\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nLeast Similar\n\nNCIS\n\nFast n’ Loud\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\n9.Empire\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nFox’s musical-drama series “Empire” tells the story of a hip-hop music company, Empire Entertainment, and the family members who fight for control of it. The show, which The New York Times described as “a double-edged variation on a familiar genre, mixing not just hip-hop music and R&B, but also adding a contemporary sensibility to Aaron Spelling-era melodrama,” is most popular in the Black Belt and in parts of the country with a high percentage of Native Americans.\n\nMost Similar\n\nLove & Hip Hop\n\n106 & Park\n\nReal Housewives of Atlanta\n\nLeast Similar\n\nMythBusters\n\nDeadliest Catch\n\nPawn Stars\n\n10.Tosh.0\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nComedy Central’s “Tosh.0” subjects viral internet videos and other aspects of pop culture to the snarky commentary of the comedian Daniel Tosh. It’s very much a Northern show, but not necessarily an urban one. It is most popular in Colorado; least so in Mississippi.\n\nMost Similar\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nMythBusters\n\nLeast Similar\n\nThe Tom and Jerry Show\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\n16 and Pregnant\n\n11.The Big Bang Theory\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“The Big Bang Theory” is a comedy that follows the life of four socially awkward but brilliant young scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif. The show is most popular in central Iowa — particularly Ames, home to Iowa State University — and University Park, Pa., the home of Penn State.\n\nMost Similar\n\nMythBusters\n\nTosh.0\n\nWipeout\n\nLeast Similar\n\nThe First 48\n\nLove & Hip Hop\n\nBad Girls Club\n\n12.The Simpsons\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\n“The Simpsons,” which has run for 28 seasons on Fox, is set in the fictional town of Springfield (in an unknown state).

The show is full of treachery, murder, nudity, sex, dragons and, yes, zombies. It’s much more popular in cities than it is in the countryside, probably the only show involving zombies that is.\n\nMost Similar\n\nThe Daily Show\n\nIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nModern Family\n\nLeast Similar\n\nDuck Dynasty\n\nTeen Mom\n\n16 and Pregnant\n\n16.The Walking Dead\n\n← Less Popular\n\nMore Popular →\n\nFlesh-eating zombies, called “walkers,” pursue the still-alive characters of “The Walking Dead” across the South.
