        "text": "Background\n\nDisney-ABC Home Entertainment and Television Distribution is the domestic distribution unit of Walt Disney Television (formerly Disney-ABC Television Group, and not to be confused with the other one), a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was originally formed in 1985 as Buena Vista Television. Originally, it distributed Walt Disney Television and Touchstone Television shows and the Buena Vista film library (such as Disney, Touchstone, Hollywood, Miramax and Dimension titles) on TV. Later, it also took on the libraries of ABC (in 1996) and Saban (in 2002). It also distributed other Disney-owned libraries. When Disney retired the \"Buena Vista\" brand in 2007, BVTV was re-branded as Disney-ABC Domestic Television, with the logo making its debut in September. In 2015, the company adopted its current name.\n\nLogo (September 3, 2007-April 29, 2022)\n\nVisuals: Two stars fly downward on a black space background. They merge into a white star, and the logo starts to take form with \"DiSNEY\" (in the corporate font) and the ABC logo (tinted blue) coming in from each side. Clouds appear as the space background turns into a blue sky, and two lines draw themselves in underneath the Disney-ABC logo, while the finished product rotates to the center of the screen. As this is happening, the Disney logo and star fade from white to blue. The words \"Home Entertainment and Television Distribution\" are seen underneath the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is an unused version where two stars fly from the right. Also, the logo is slightly darkened and one cloud from on the top left is absent.\n\nBefore 2013, the camera at the beginning rotates, and the text at the end reads \"D O M E S T I C T E L E V I S I O N\".\n\nThe logo is typically seen in a short version where it cuts off before the clouds make any significant movement.\n\nOn the Nintendo DS version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, a still (off-air) version is used. The Disney/ABC logos and words are placed horizontally against a white background, with the Disney and ABC logos separated by a vertical line.\n\nAn updated version of the logo was introduced in September 2013. The sky color fade-in plays faster, and starts a second earlier. The ABC logo was modified into the 2013 (blue) rendition that made its debut that summer, but with a blue shine instead of a gold one (perhaps to match and represent the sky's color). The text underneath the lines is also modified, and are now no longer in spaced-out all-caps, instead having the first letter of each word capitalized and in what appears to be Benton Sans.\n\nUntil 2015, this uses the \"Domestic Television\" moniker.\n\nMost episodes of Live with Kelly (and Michael/Ryan), as well as later episodes of Live! with Regis & Kelly, have the logo cross-fade in from the show's closing credits.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Scott Williams at New Wave Entertainment.\n\nAudio: A reorchestration of the 1997 medium-length Buena Vista Television theme, composed by Sam Winans. Sometimes, the closing theme plays over the logo.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn most episodes of Live with Kelly (and Michael/Ryan), as well as later episodes of Live! with Regis & Kelly, a volume glitch is heard. The first half of the music plays over before the show fades to the logo and the second half is on the logo. The first half is on low volume while the second half is on the normal volume.\n\nOn Katie, FABLife, and Right This Minute, only the last seven notes are used.\n\nOn some Katie, FABLife, and Right This Minute episodes, from Sam Winans' website, as well as the unused version where the theme originated from the long version, the 2007 theme is extended.\n\nAvailability:\n\nAppeared on 2007-2020 episodes of first-run syndication programs such as Live! with Regis and Kelly/Kelly and Michael/Kelly and Ryan (the current version, Live with Kelly and Mark, uses the Disney Entertainment Distribution logo), and Tamron Hall among others.\n\nThe long version is available on Sam Winans' website, on the television section.\n\nIt was featured at the end of episodes of At the Movies during the Ben Lyons/Ben Mankewicz and Michael Phillips/A.O. Scott eras.\n\nAlso seen on Ludia's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? games in North America, namely the Wii, PS3 and PC versions for the 2007 version (the DS version uses a still version instead), while the 2013 version was seen in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 2012 Edition on the Xbox 360 (Kinect). Furthermore, the 2007 on-air print version was spotted in the North American version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Special Editions on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC.\n\nThe unused version was unused and may not be the extended version that was used.\n\nReruns of the Meredith Vieira version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on GSN plaster the Buena Vista Television logos with this logo. As of 2020, this is the only known instance of this logo plastering over another one. When GSN later began re-airing the Regis Philbin era in March 2023, the Buena Vista Television logo was preserved. Starting with the May 1, 2001 episode, the 2005 Buena Vista Television logo plasters the previous logo. This excluded the Top of the Charts Edition (July 22-27, 2001).\n\nIt doesn't appear on any other series in the Disney-ABC library, as this logo is seen only on first-run syndicated series.\n\nAlthough the company is still in operation, this logo has been retired, with Disney Entertainment Distribution's logo overshadowing this logo during the 2020-2021 television season.\n\nThis logo was retained on 2020-2022 episodes of Right This Minute, which was the final program that was still using it. Right This Minute ended on April 29, 2022, officially ending the usage of the logo."
