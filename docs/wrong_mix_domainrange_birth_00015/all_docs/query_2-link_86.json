        "text": "George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 – 2 November 1950), known at his insistence simply as Bernard Shaw, was an Irish playwright, critic, polemicist and political activist with a range incorporating both contemporary satire and historical allegory. He wrote more than sixty plays, including such works as Man and Superman (1902), Pygmalion (1913) and Saint Joan (1923). Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925.\n\nSee also:\n\nMan and Superman (1903)\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\n1890s\n\n[edit]\n\nThe old Whigs and new Tories of the school of Cobden and Bright, the \"Philosophic Radicals,\" the economists of whom Bastiat is the type, Lord Wemyss and Lord Bramwell, Mr. Herbert Spencer and Mr. Auberon Herbert, Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Arthur Balfour, Mr. John Morley, Mr. Leonard Courtney: any of these is, in England, a more typical Anarchist than Bakounin. They distrust State action, and are jealous advocates of the prerogative of the individual, proposing to restrict the one and to extend the other as far as is humanly possible, in opposition to the Social-Democrat, who proposes to democratize the State and throw upon it the whole work of organizing the national industry, thereby making it the most vital organ in the social body.\n\n'The Impossibilities of Anarchism', a paper read to the Fabian Society on 16 October 1891, reprinted in The Impossibilities of Anarchism (Fabian tract no. 45, 1895), pp. 4–5\n\nPatriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it...\n\nThe World (15 November 1893)\n\nPasteboard pies and paper flowers are being banished from the stage by the growth of that power of accurate observation which is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it...\n\nThe World (18 July 1894), Music in London 1890-1894 being criticisms contributed week by week to The World (New York: Vienna House, 1973)\n\nBut no public man in these islands ever believes that the Bible means what it says: he is always convinced that it says what he means; and I have no reason to hope that Mr Coote may be an exception to the rule.\n\n\"The Living Pictures\", The Saturday Review, LXXIX (April 6, 1895), 443, reprinted in Our Theatres in the Nineties (1932). Vol. 1.

These are the love duet in the first act, Brunnhilde's announcement of death in the second, the ride of the Valkyries and the 'fire-charm' in the third. For them the ordinary playgoer endures hours of Wotan, with Christopher Sly's prayer in his heart. 'Would 'twere over!' Now, I am one of those elect souls who are deeply moved by Wotan. I grant you that as a long-winded, one-eyed gentleman backing a certain champion in a fight and henpecked out of his fancy because his wife objects to the moral character of the champion, he is a dreary person indeed . . . but to one who has understood all its beauties, its lofty aspirations, its tragedy, there is nothing trivial, nothing tedious in Die Walküre.\n\ncomments after attending the 1896 Bayreuth Festival.

M. Gibbs, 1990, p. 401\n\nQuintessence Of Ibsenism (1891; 1913)\n\n[edit]\n\nA review of the works and ideas of Henrik Ibsen\n\nI have never admitted the right of an elderly author to alter the work of a young author, even when the young author happens to be his former self. In the case of a work which is a mere exhibition of skill in conventional art, there may be some excuse for the delusion that the longer the artist works on it the nearer he will bring it to perfection. Yet even the victims of this delusion must see that there is an age limit to the process, and that though a man of forty-five may improve the workmanship of a man of thirty-five, it does not follow that a man of fifty-five can do the same.\n\nWhen we come to creative art, to the living word of a man delivering a message to his own time, it is clear that any attempt to alter this later on is simply fraud and forgery. As I read the old Quintessence of Ibsenism I may find things that I see now at a different angle, or correlate with so many things then unnoted by me that they take on a different aspect. But though this may be a reason for writing another book, it is not a reason for altering an existing one.\n\nPreface to the 1913 edition\n\nJust as the liar's punishment is, not in the least that he is not believed, but that he cannot believe any one else; so a guilty society can more easily be persuaded that any apparently innocent act is guilty than that any apparently guilty act is innocent.\n\nThe Two Pioneers\n\nThe salvation of the world depends on the men who will not take evil good-humouredly, and whose laughter destroys the fool instead of encouraging him.\n\nWhat is the New Element in the Norwegian School?\n\nIt's well to be off with the Old Woman before you're on with the New.\n\nAct II\n\nThe fickleness of the women I love is only equaled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me.\n\nAct II\n\nThe test of a man or woman's breeding is how they behave in a quarrel.\n\nAct IV\n\nPeople are always blaming circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\n\nVivie, Act II\n\nThere are no secrets better kept than the secrets everybody guesses.\n\nCrofts, Act III\n\nI know Miss Warren is a great devotee of the Gospel of Getting On.\n\nPraed, Act IV\n\nHail, Sphinx: salutation from Julius Caesar! I have wandered in many lands, seeking the lost regions from which my birth into this world exiled me, and the company of creatures such as I myself. I have found flocks and pastures, men and cities, but no other Caesar, no air native to me, no man kindred to me, none who can do my day's deed, and think my night's thought.\n\nAct I\n\nMy way hither was the way of destiny; for I am he of whose genius you are the symbol: part brute, part woman, and part God — nothing of man in me at all. Have I read your riddle, Sphinx?\n\nAct I\n\nTHEODOTUS: Caesar: you are a stranger here, and not conversant with our laws. The kings and queens of Egypt may not marry except with their own royal blood. Ptolemy and Cleopatra are born king and consort just as they are born brother and sister.\n\nBRITANNUS (shocked): Caesar: this is not proper.\n\nTHEODOTUS (outraged): How!\n\nCAESAR (recovering his self-possession): Pardon him, Theodotus: he is a barbarian, and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature.\n\nAct II; sometimes paraphrased as: The customs of your tribe are not laws of nature.\n\nWhen a stupid man is doing something he is ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty.\n\nAct III\n\nAgain, there is the illusion of \"increased command over Nature,\" meaning that cotton is cheap and that ten miles of country road on a bicycle have replaced four on foot. But even if man's increased command over Nature included any increased command over himself (the only sort of command relevant to his evolution into a higher being), the fact remains that it is only by running away from the increased command over Nature to country places where Nature is still in primitive command over Man that he can recover from the effects of the smoke, the stench, the foul air, the overcrowding, the racket, the ugliness, the dirt which the cheap cotton costs us.\n\nNotes\n\n1900s\n\n[edit]\n\nThe novelties of one generation are only the resuscitated fashions of the generation before last.\n\nThree Plays for Puritans, Preface (1900)\n\nI delight in the war more & more. It has waked up the country out of its filthy wallowing in money (blood is a far superior bath); and it has put a fourpence on the Income Tax which will never come off it if the Fabian can help it; so that Old Age Pensions will be within reach at the end of the ten years repayment period, if not sooner. ... Charrington calls me a Tory because I declare for Imperialism as our social theory.\n\nOn the Boer War; letter to Henry Stephens Salt (12 March 1900), as cited in Dan H. Laurence (ed) Collected Letters: 1898–1910 (1985), p. 153\n\nThe worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them: that's the essence of inhumanity.\n\nThe Devil's Disciple, Act II (1901)\n\nMartyrdom, sir, is what these people like: it is the only way in which a man can become famous without ability.\n\nThe Devil's Disciple, Act II\n\nI was a cannibal for twenty-five years. For the rest I have been a vegetarian. It was Shelley who first opened my eyes to the savagery of my diet.\n\nInterview \"Who I Am, and What I Think\", in Frank Harris's periodical The Candid Friend (May 1901), reprinted in Sixteen Self Sketches, 1949, p. 53; quoted in Desmond King-Hele, Shelley: His Thought and Work, 1984, p. 42\n\nYou must not suppose, because I am a man of letters, that I never tried to earn an honest living.\n\nThe Irrational Knot, Preface (1905)\n\n[Chess] is a foolish expedient for making idle people believe they are doing something very clever, when they are only wasting their time.\n\nThe Irrational Knot (1905)\n\nTo understand a saint, you must hear the devil's advocate; and the same is true of the artist.\n\nThe Sanity of Art: An Exposure of the Current Nonsense about Artists being Degenerate (1908)\n\nAssassination is the extreme form of censorship; and it seems hard to justify an incitement to it on anti-censorial principles.\n\nThe Shewing Up of Blanco Posnet (1909): The Rejected Statement, Pt. I : The Limits to Toleration\n\nThis is the real enemy, the invader from the East, the Druze, the ruffian, the oriental parasite; in a word: the Jew.\n\nLondon Morning Post, December 3, 1925\n\nThis craving for bouquets by Jews is a symptom of racial degeneration. The Jews are worse than my own people. Those Jews who still want to be the chosen race (chosen by the late Lord Balfour) can go to Palestine and stew in their own juice. The rest had better stop being Jews and start being human beings.\n\nLiterary Digest, October 12, 1932\n\nLove Among the Artists (1900)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe way to deal with worldly people is to frighten them by repeating their scandalous whisperings aloud.\n\nThe public want actresses, because they think all actresses bad. They don't want music or poetry because they know that both are good. So actors and actresses thrive and poets and composers starve.\n\nThere are some men who are considered quite ugly, but who are more remarkable than pretty people. You often see that in artists.\n\nAll very fine, Mary; but my old-fashioned common sense is better than your clever modern nonsense.\n\nIf you leave your art, the world will beat you back to it. The world has not an ambition worth sharing, or a prize worth handling. Corrupt successes, disgraceful failures, or sheeplike vegetation are all it has to offer. I prefer Art, which gives me a sixth sense of beauty, with self-respect: perhaps also an immortal reputation in return for honest endeavour in a labour of love.\n\nPerhaps woman's art is of woman's life a thing apart, 'tis man's whole existence; just as love is said to be the reverse — though it isn't.\n\nI hate singers, a miserable crew who think that music exists only in their own throats.\n\nA man's own self is the last person to believe in him, and is harder to cheat than the rest of the world.\n\nComposers are not human; They can live on diminished sevenths, and be contented with a pianoforte for a wife, and a string quartet for a family.\n\nGeniuses are horrid, intolerant, easily offended, sleeplessly self-conscious men, who expect their wives to be angels with no further business in life than to pet and worship their husbands. Even at the best they are not comfortable men to live with; and a perfect husband is one who is perfectly comfortable to live with.\n\nEven the youngest of us may be wrong sometimes.\n\nMain article: Man and Superman\n\nThis is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.\n\np. xxxi\n\nThere is no love sincerer than the love of food.\n\np. 23\n\nThe only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.\n\np. 37\n\nThe confusion of marriage with morality has done more to destroy the conscience of the human race than any other single error.\n\np. 121\n\nEconomy is the art of making the most of life. The love of economy is the root of all virtue.\n\np. 235\n\nMaxims for Revolutionists (1903)\n\n[edit]\n\nFull text online\n\nDo not do unto others as you would expect they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.\n\n#1\n\nIf the lesser mind could measure the greater as a foot-rule can measure a pyramid, there would be finality in universal suffrage. As it is, the political problem remains unsolved.\n\n#16\n\nDemocracy substitutes election by the incompetent many for appointment by the corrupt few.\n\n#17\n\nHe who confuses political liberty with freedom and political equality with similarity has never thought for five minutes about either.\n\n#23\n\nLiberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.\n\n#25\n\nThe duke inquires contemptuously whether his gamekeeper is the equal of the Astronomer Royal; but he insists that they shall both be hanged equally if they murder him.\n\n#26\n\nWhere equality is undisputed, so also is subordination.\n\n#28\n\nA fool's brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry.\n\n#32\n\nThe best brought-up children are those who have seen their parents as they are. Hypocrisy is not the parent's first duty.\n\n#33\n\nEvery fool believes what his teachers tell him, and calls his credulity science or morality as confidently as his father called it divine revelation.\n\n#39\n\nNo man can be a pure specialist without being in the strict sense an idiot.\n\n#41\n\nThe man who has graduated from the flogging block at Eton to the bench from which he sentences the garrotter to be flogged is the same social product as the garrotter who has been kicked by his father and cuffed by his mother until he has grown strong enough to throttle and rob the rich citizen whose money he desires.\n\n#55\n\nCriminals do not die by the hands of the law. They die by the hands of other men.\n\n#57\n\nWhen a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport: when the tiger wants to murder him he calls it ferocity. The distinction between Crime and Justice is no greater.\n\n#62\n\nIt is not necessary to replace a guillotined criminal: it is necessary to replace a guillotined social system.\n\n#65\n\nThere are no perfectly honorable men; but every true man has one main point of honor and a few minor ones.\n\n#68\n\nBeware of the man whose god is in the skies.\n\n#83\n\nSelf-denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on rascality.\n\n#87\n\nObedience simulates subordination as fear of the police simulates honesty.\n\n#88\n\nDisobedience, the rarest and most courageous of the virtues, is seldom distinguished from neglect, the laziest and commonest of the vices.\n\n#89\n\nIn a stupid nation the man of genius becomes a god: everybody worships him and nobody does his will.\n\n#101\n\nHappiness and Beauty are by-products.\n\n#102\n\nRiches and Art are spurious receipts for the production of Happiness and Beauty.\n\n#104\n\nHe who desires a lifetime of happiness with a beautiful woman desires to enjoy the taste of wine by keeping his mouth always full of it.\n\n#105\n\nThe man with a toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound. The poverty stricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man.\n\n#107\n\nThe more a man possesses over and above what he uses, the more careworn he becomes.\n\n#108\n\nIn an ugly and unhappy world the richest man can purchase nothing but ugliness and unhappiness.\n\n#110\n\nNo elaboration of physical or moral accomplishment can atone for the sin of parasitism.\n\n#116\n\nThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

If the mischief stopped at talking and thinking it would be bad enough; but it goes further, into disastrous anarchical action. Because our marriage law is inhuman and unreasonable to the point of downright abomination, the bolder and more rebellious spirits form illicit unions, defiantly sending cards round to their friends announcing what they have done. Young women come to me and ask me whether I think they ought to consent to marry the man they have decided to live with; and they are perplexed and astonished when I, who am supposed (heaven knows why!) to have the most advanced views attainable on the subject, urge them on no account to compromise themselves without the security of an authentic wedding ring.\n\nPreface\n\nHome life as we understand it is no more natural to us than a cage is natural to a cockatoo.\n\nPreface\n\nWhen two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.\n\nPreface\n\nPlato long ago pointed out the importance of being governed by men with sufficient sense of responsibility and comprehension of public duties to be very reluctant to undertake the work of governing.\n\nPreface\n\nLove is an appetite which, like all other appetites, is destroyed for the moment by its gratification.\n\nPreface\n\nNever forget that if you leave your law to judges and your religion to bishops, you will presently find yourself without either law or religion.\n\nPreface\n\nJournalists are too poorly paid in this country to know anything that is fit for publication.\n\nPreface\n\nMonogamy has a sentimental basis which is quite distinct from the political one of equal numbers of the sexes. Equal numbers in the sexes are quite compatible with a change of partners every day or every hour. Physically there is nothing to distinguish human society from the farm-yard except that children are more troublesome and costly than chickens and calves, and that men and women are not so completely enslaved as farm stock. Accordingly, the people whose conception of marriage is a farm-yard or slave-quarter conception are always more or less in a panic lest the slightest relaxation of the marriage laws should utterly demoralize society; whilst those to whom marriage is a matter of more highly evolved sentiments and needs (sometimes said to be distinctively human, though birds and animals in a state of freedom evince them quite as touchingly as we) are much more liberal, knowing as they do that monogamy will take care of itself provided the parties are free enough, and that promiscuity is a product of slavery and not of liberty.\n\nPreface: \"The Personal Sentimental Basis of Monogamy\"\n\nThe secret of forgiving everything is to understand nothing.\n\nLeo\n\nNothing is more dreadful than a husband who keeps telling you everything he thinks, and always wants to know what you think.\n\nThe Bishop\n\nAll progress means war with Society.\n\nThe Bishop\n\nThe whole strength of England lies in the fact that the enormous majority of the English people are snobs.\n\nHotchkiss\n\nYou don't learn to hold your own in the world by standing on guard, but by attacking, and getting well hammered yourself.\n\nMrs. George\n\nI happen, like Napoleon, to prefer Mohammedanism.

You are all missionaries and proselytizers trying to uproot the native religion from your neighbor's flowerbeds and plant your own in its place. You would rather let a child perish in ignorance than have it taught by a rival sectary.

Censorship ends in logical completeness when nobody is allowed to read any books except the books that nobody can read. But as the ratepayer is mostly a coward and a fool in these difficult matters, and the committee is quite sure that it can succeed where the Roman Catholic Church has made its index expurgatorius the laughing-stock of the world, censorship will rage until it reduces itself to absurdity; and even then the best books will be in danger still.\n\nAs quoted in \"Literary Censorship in England\" in Current Opinion, Vol. 55, No. 5 (November 1913), p. 378; this has sometimes appeared on the internet in paraphrased form as \"Censorship ends in logical completeness when nobody is allowed to read any books except the books that nobody reads\"\n\nWell, I tell you again to get rid of your Constitution.

A child should begin to assert itself early, and shift for itself more and more not only in washing and dressing itself, but in opinions and conduct; yet as nothing is so exasperating and so unlovable as an uppish child, it is useless to expect parents and schoolmasters to inculcate this uppishness. Such unamiable precepts as Always contradict an authoritative statement, Always return a blow, Never lose a chance of a good fight, When you are scolded for a mistake ask the person who scolds you whether he or she supposes you did it on purpose, and follow the question with a blow or an insult or some other unmistakable expression of resentment, Remember that the progress of the world depends on your knowing better than your elders, are just as important as those of The Sermon on the Mount; but no one has yet seen them written up in letters of gold in a schoolroom or nursery.\n\nYou are so careful of your boy's morals, knowing how troublesome they may be, that you keep him away from the Venus of Milo only to find him in the arms of the scullery maid or someone much worse. You decide that the Hermes of Praxiteles and Wagner's Tristan are not suited for young girls; and your daughter marries somebody appallingly unlike either Hermes or Tristan solely to escape from your parental protection. You have not stifled a single passion nor averted a single danger: you have depraved the passions by starving them, and broken down all the defences which so effectively protect children brought up in freedom.\n\nThe secret of being miserable is to have leisure to bother about whether you are happy or not. The cure for it is occupation, because occupation means pre-occupation; and the pre-occupied person is neither happy nor unhappy, but simply alive and active, which is pleasanter than any happiness until you are tired of it.\n\nFull text online at Project Gutenberg\n\nDo not try to live for ever.

She saw death as you saw it when the fawn fell; and she knew then that she must find out how to renew herself and cast the skin like me. She had a mighty will: she strove and strove and willed and willed for more moons than there are leaves on all the trees of the garden. Her pangs were terrible: her groans drove sleep from Eden. She said it must never be again: that the burden of renewing life was past bearing: that it was too much for one.

Best of all, they are still not satisfied: the impulse I gave them in that day when I sundered myself in twain and launched Man and Woman on the earth still urges them: after passing a million goals they press on to the goal of redemption from the flesh, to the vortex freed from matter, to the whirlpool in pure intelligence that, when the world began, was a whirlpool in pure force.\n\nI can wait: waiting and patience mean nothing to the eternal.

In that hope and faith I have let them live for a moment; and in that moment I have spared them many times. But mightier creatures than they have killed hope and faith, and perished from the earth; and I may not spare them for ever. I am Lilith: I brought life into the whirlpool of force, and compelled my enemy, Matter, to obey a living soul. But in enslaving Life's enemy I made him Life's master; for that is the end of all slavery; and now I shall see the slave set free and the enemy reconciled, the whirlpool become all life and no matter. And because these infants that call themselves ancients are reaching out towards that, I will have patience with them still; though I know well that when they attain it they shall become one with me and supersede me, and Lilith will be only a legend and a lay that has lost its meaning. Of Life only is there no end; and though of its million starry mansions many are empty and many still unbuilt, and though its vast domain is as yet unbearably desert, my seed shall one day fill it and master its matter to its uttermost confines. And for what may be beyond, the eyesight of Lilith is too short. It is enough that there is a beyond.\n\nLilith, in Pt.

Whilst assenting to these proceedings, and even acclaiming and celebrating them, we dare not tell ourselves what we are doing or why we are doing it; and so we call it justice or capital punishment or our duty to king and country or any other convenient verbal whitewash for what we instinctively recoil from as from a dirty job. These childish evasions are revolting. We must strip off the whitewash and find out what is really beneath it. Extermination must be put on a scientific basis if it is ever to be carried out humanely and apologetically as well as thoroughly.\n\nPreface; Extermination\n\nIgnoring the satirical elements of Shaw's rhetoric, and that he is presenting many arguments of sometimes questionable sincerity for the \"humane\" execution of criminals, the last sentence here has sometimes been misquoted as if it as part of an argument for exterminations for the sake of eugenics, by preceding it with a selected portion of a statement later in the essay: \"If we desire a certain type of civilization, we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it ... Extermination must be put on a scientific basis if it is ever to be carried out humanely and apologetically as well as thoroughly\".\n\nIn law we draw a line between the killing of human animals and non-human ones, setting the latter apart as brutes. This was founded on a general belief that humans have immortal souls and brutes none. Nowadays more and more people are refusing to make this distinction. They may believe in The Life Everlasting and The Life to Come; but they make no distinction between Man and Brute, because some of them believe that brutes have souls, whilst others refuse to believe that the physical materializations and personifications of The Life Everlasting are themselves everlasting. In either case the mystic distinction between Man and Brute vanishes; and the murderer pleading that though a rabbit should be killed for being mischievous he himself should be spared because he has an immortal soul and a rabbit has none is as hopelessly out of date as a gentleman duellist pleading his clergy. When the necessity for killing a dangerous human being arises, as it still does daily, the only distinction we make between a man and a snared rabbit is that we very quaintly provide the man with a minister of religion to explain to him that we are not killing him at all, but only expediting his transfer to an eternity of bliss.\n\nPreface; The Sacredness of Human Life\n\nThe extermination of what the exterminators call inferior races is as old as history. \"Stone dead hath no fellow\" said Cromwell when he tried to exterminate the Irish. \"The only good nigger is a dead nigger\" say the Americans of the Ku-Klux temperament. \"Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\" said Shylock naively. But we white men, as we absurdly call ourselves in spite of the testimony of our looking glasses, regard all differently colored folk as inferior species. Ladies and gentlemen class rebellious laborers with vermin. The Dominicans, the watchdogs of God, regarded the Albigenses as the enemies of God, just as Torquemada regarded the Jews as the murderers of God. All that is an old story: what we are confronted with now is a growing perception that if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the sort of people who do not fit into it. There is a difference between the shooting at sight of aboriginal natives in the back blocks of Australia and the massacres of aristocrats in the terror which followed the foreign attacks on the French Revolution. The Australian gunman pots the aboriginal natives to satisfy his personal antipathy to a black man with uncut hair. But nobody in the French Republic had this feeling about Lavoisier, nor can any German Nazi have felt that way about Einstein. Yet Lavoisier was guillotined; and Einstein has had to fly for his life from Germany. It was silly to say that the Republic had no use for chemists; and no Nazi has stultified his party to the extent of saying that the new National Socialist Fascist State in Germany has no use for mathematician-physicists. The proposition is that aristocrats (Lavoisier's class) and Jews (Einstein's race) are unfit to enjoy the privilege of living in a modern society founded on definite principles of social welfare as distinguished from the old promiscuous aggregations crudely policed by chiefs who had no notion of social criticism and no time to invent it.\n\nPreface; Previous Attempts Miss the Point.\n\nThere have been summits of civilization at which heretics like Socrates, who was killed because he was wiser than his neighbors, have not been tortured, but ordered to kill themselves in the most painless manner known to their judges. But from that summit there was a speedy relapse into our present savagery.\n\nPreface; Cruelty's Excuses\n\nI dislike cruelty, even cruelty to other people, and should therefore like to see all cruel people exterminated. But I should recoil with horror from a proposal to punish them. Let me illustrate my attitude by a very famous, indeed far too famous, example of the popular conception of criminal law as a means of delivering up victims to the normal popular lust for cruelty which has been mortified by the restraint imposed on it by civilization. Take the case of the extermination of Jesus Christ. No doubt there was a strong case for it. Jesus was from the point of view of the High Priest a heretic and an impostor. From the point of view of the merchants he was a rioter and a Communist. From the Roman Imperialist point of view he was a traitor. From the commonsense point of view he was a dangerous madman. From the snobbish point of view, always a very influential one, he was a penniless vagrant. From the police point of view he was an obstructor of thoroughfares, a beggar, an associate of prostitutes, an apologist of sinners, and a disparager of judges; and his daily companions were tramps whom he had seduced into vagabondage from their regular trades. From the point of view of the pious he was a Sabbath breaker, a denier of the efficacy of circumcision and the advocate of a strange rite of baptism, a gluttonous man and a winebibber. He was abhorrent to the medical profession as an unqualified practitioner who healed people by quackery and charged nothing for the treatment. He was not anti-Christ: nobody had heard of such a power of darkness then; but he was startlingly anti-Moses. He was against the priests, against the judiciary, against the military, against the city (he declared that it was impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven), against all the interests, classes, principalities and powers, inviting everybody to abandon all these and follow him. By every argument, legal, political, religious, customary, and polite, he was the most complete enemy of the society of his time ever brought to the bar. He was guilty on every count of the indictment, and on many more that his accusers had not the wit to frame. If he was innocent then the whole world was guilty. To acquit him was to throw over civilization and all its institutions. History has borne out the case against him; for no State has ever constituted itself on his principles or made it possible to live according to his commandments: those States who have taken his name have taken it as an alias to enable them to persecute his followers more plausibly.\n\nIt is not surprising that under these circumstances, and in the absence of any defence, the Jerusalem community and the Roman government decided to exterminate Jesus. They had just as much right to do so as to exterminate the two thieves who perished with him.\n\nPreface, Leading Case of Jesus Christ\n\nAll government is cruel; for nothing is so cruel as impunity.\n\nPilate, as portrayed in Preface, Difference Between Reader And Spectator\n\nI am no mere chance pile of flesh and bone: if I were only that, I should fall into corruption and dust before your eyes. I am the embodiment of a thought of God: I am the Word made flesh: that is what holds me together standing before you in the image of God. ... The Word is God. And God is within you. ... In so far as you know the truth you have it from my God, who is your heavenly father and mine. He has many names and his nature is manifold. ... It is by children who are wiser than their fathers, subjects who are wiser than their emperors, beggars and vagrants who are wiser than their priests, that men rise from being beasts of prey to believing in me and being saved. ... By their fruits ye shall know them. Beware how you kill a thought that is new to you. For that thought may be the foundation of the kingdom of God on earth.\n\nJesus, as portrayed in Preface, Difference Between Reader And Spectator\n\nThe kingdom of God is striving to come. The empire that looks back in terror shall give way to the kingdom that looks forward with hope. Terror drives men mad: hope and faith give them divine wisdom. The men whom you fill with fear will stick at no evil and perish in their sin: the men whom I fill with faith shall inherit the earth. I say to you Cast out fear. Speak no more vain things to me about the greatness of Rome. ... You, standing for Rome, are the universal coward: I, standing for the kingdom of God, have braved everything, lost everything, and won an eternal crown.\n\nJesus, as portrayed in Preface, Difference Between Reader And Spectator\n\nLaw is blind without counsel. The counsel men agree with is vain: it is only the echo of their own voices. A million echoes will not help you to rule righteously. But he who does not fear you and shews you the other side is a pearl of the greatest price. Slay me and you go blind to your damnation. The greatest of God's names is Counsellor; and when your Empire is dust and your name a byword among the nations the temples of the living God shall still ring with his praise as Wonderful! Counsellor! the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.\n\nJesus, as portrayed in Preface, Difference Between Reader And Spectator\n\nThe last word remains with Christ and Handel; and this must stand as the best defence of Tolerance until a better man than I makes a better job of it.\n\nPut shortly and undramatically the case is that a civilization cannot progress without criticism, and must therefore, to save itself from stagnation and putrefaction, declare impunity for criticism. This means impunity not only for propositions which, however novel, seem interesting, statesmanlike, and respectable, but for propositions that shock the uncritical as obscene, seditious, blasphemous, heretical, and revolutionary.\n\nPreface, The Sacredness Of Criticism\n\n1940s and later\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sex relation is not a personal relation.

When the Arabs had run this sort of idolatry to such extremes ... they did this without black dolls and worshipped any stone that looked funny, Mahomet rose up at the risk of his life and insulted the stones shockingly, declaring that there is only one God, Allah, the glorious, the great... And there was to be no nonsense about toleration. You accepted Allah or you had your throat cut by someone who did accept him, and who went to Paradise for having sent you to Hell.

A combination of my beauty and your brains would startle the world,\" but he replied: \"I must decline your offer with thanks, for the child might have my beauty and your brains.\"\n\nAnecdote presented in \"Isadore Duncan : Dancer as Plaything of Fate\" in A Century of Sundays : 100 years of Breaking News in the Sunday Papers (2006), by Nadine Dreyer, p. 65; the anecdote provided here does not cite earlier sources, and though widely attributed to an exchange between Duncan and Shaw, the earliest form of it yet located is in 10,000 Jokes, Toasts & Stories (1939) by Lewis & Faye Copeland, which simply has an unidentified woman offering to have a child with Shaw, saying \"think of the child with your brains and my beauty\" and him replying \"But what if he were to have your brains and my beauty?\"\n\nShaw: Madam, would you sleep with me for a million pounds?\n\nActress: My goodness, Well, I'd certainly think about it\n\nShaw: Would you sleep with me for a pound?\n\nActress: Certainly not! What kind of woman do you think I am?!\n\nShaw: Madam, we've already established that. Now we are haggling over the price.\n\nSimilar remarks are also attributed to Winston Churchill, Groucho Marx and to Mark Twain\n\nI have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which appears to me to possess that assimilating capability to the changing phase of existence which can make itself appeal to every age. The world must doubtless attach high value to the predictions of great men like me. I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today. The medieval ecclesiastics, either through ignorance or bigotry, painted Muhammadanism in the darkest colours. They were in fact trained both to hate the man Muhammad and his religion. To them Muhammad was Anti-Christ. I have studied him — the wonderful man, and in my opinion far from being an Anti-Christ he must be called the Saviour of Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much-needed peace and happiness. But to proceed, it was in the 19th century that honest thinkers like Carlyle, Goethe and Gibbon perceived intrinsic worth in the religion of Muhammad, and thus there was some change for the better in the European attitude towards Islam. But the Europe of the present century is far advanced. It is beginning to be enamoured of the creed of Muhammad.\n\nInterview (April 1935), as quoted in The Genuine Islam, Vol. 1 (January 1936).

Lawrence, and Virginia Woolf.\n\nIsabel Allende Interview\n\nShaw knows at any moment, on any subject, what he thinks, what you will think, what others have thought, what all this thinking entails; and he takes the most elaborate pains to bring these thoughts to light in a form which is by turns abstract and familiar, conciliatory and aggressive, obvious and inferential, comic and puzzling. In a word, Shaw is perhaps the most consciously conscious mind that has ever thought — certainly the most conscious since Rousseau; which may be why both of them often create the same impression of insincerity amounting to charlatanism. Yet it is by excess of honesty that Shaw himself lent color to his representation as an inconsequential buffoon bent on monopolizing the spotlight.\n\nJacques Barzun, in \"Bernard Shaw in Twilight\" in The Kenyon Review (Summer 1943)\n\nSeeing clearly within himself and always able to dodge around the ends of any position, including his own, Shaw assumed from the start the dual role of prophet and gadfly.\n\nJacques Barzun, in \"Bernard Shaw in Twilight\" in The Kenyon Review (Summer 1943)\n\nShaw does not merely decorate a proposition, but makes his way from point to point through new and difficult territory.\n\nJacques Barzun, in \"Bernard Shaw in Twilight\" in The Kenyon Review (Summer 1943)\n\nHe never invested his whole moral capital in a man, a book, or a cause, but treasured up wisdom wherever it could be picked up, always with scrupulous acknowledgment ... His eclecticism saving him from the cycle of hope-disillusion-despair, his highest effectiveness was as a skirmisher in the daily battle for light and justice, as a critic of new doctrine and a refurbisher of old, as a voice of warning and encouragement. That his action has not been in vain, we can measure by how little Shaw's iconoclasm stirs our blood; we no longer remember what he destroyed that was blocking our view.\n\nJacques Barzun, in \"Bernard Shaw in Twilight\" in The Kenyon Review (Summer 1943)\n\nBernard Shaw remains the only model we have of what the citizen of a democracy should be: an informed participant in all things we deem important to the society and the individual.\n\nJacques Barzun \"Bernard Shaw,\" in A Jacques Barzun Reader: Selections from his works (2002), p. 231\n\nMr. Shaw cannot realise his own pertness, nor can he preserve his own gravity, for more than a few moments at a time. Even when he sets out to be funny for fun's sake, he must needs always pretend that there is a serious reason for the emprise; and he pretends so strenuously that he ends by convincing us almost as fully as he convinces himself. Thus the absurdity, whatever it be, comes off doubly well. Conversely, even when he is really engrossed in some process of serious argument, or moved to real eloquence by one of his social ideals, he emits involuntarily some wild jape which makes the whole thing ridiculous — as ridiculous to himself as to us; and straightway he proceeds to caricature his own thesis till everything is topsy-turvy; and we, rolling with laughter, look up and find him no longer on his head, but on his heels, talking away quite gravely; and this sets us off again. For, of course, when seriousness and frivolity thus co-exist inseparably in a man, the seriousness is nullified by the frivolity. The latter is fed by the former, but, graceless and vampire-like, kills it. As a teacher, as a propagandist, Mr. Shaw is no good at all, even in his own generation. But as a personality he is immortal.\n\nPosterity will not, I fancy, read his writings. He has not enough of the specific art-sense for writing. I will not exasperate him by complaining that he has no sense of beauty in the use of his medium: the idea of beauty is a red rag to him, as we know. I will merely suggest that he has in his writing the qualities of a public speaker rather than of a writer. He does not write with that closeness which is the result not of haste but of leisure, and which is the main secret of good literature. He is too glib, too fluent, too diffuse, and too loud. Glibness and fluency, loudness and diffusion, are just the qualities needed for addressing an audience. But between speaking and writing there is a vast difference. A good writer cannot make good speeches, and Mr. Shaw's seems an instance to prove that a good speaker cannot write well. We, his contemporaries, can read him with delight, even though we seem to miss the reporter's interpolation of \"laughter\", \"cheers\", \"interruption\", and so forth. But relentlessly, in course of time, lack of solid form \"tells on\" writing. However interesting a writer may be, he will not, unless he be a strict artist, be read by posterity. Style, as has been said, is the one antiseptic. But, though Mr. Shaw's writing be not good enough for the next generation, he himself, being so signally unique, is good enough for all time. I wish I had the leisure to be his Boswell, and he the kindness to be my Johnson.\n\nMax Beerbohm, in \"A Cursory Conspectus of G. B. S.\" in The Saturday Review of Politics, Science and Art (2 November 1901)\n\nThe writers of our century delight in the weaknesses of the human condition; the only one capable of inventing heroes was Bernard Shaw.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, Obra Completa (1996), Vol. IV, p. 487\n\n\"God spare you, reader, of long prefaces\". That was written by Quevedo, who, in order not to commit an anachronism that would have been found out in the long run, never read Shaw´s.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, Obra Completa (1996), Vol. II, p. 400\n\nHe was a Tolstoy with jokes, a modern Dr Johnson, a universal genius who on his own modest reckoning put even Shakespeare in the shade.\n\nJohn Campbell, The Independent, as quoted in Penguin Classics edition of Plays Unpleasant (1946)\n\nIn his works Shaw left us his mind ... Today we have no Shavian wizard to awaken us with clarity and paradox, and the loss to our national intelligence is immense.\n\nJohn Carey, The Sunday Times, as quoted in Penguin Classics edition of Plays Unpleasant (1946)\n\nI never read a reply by Shaw that did not leave me in better and not worse temper or frame of mind; which did not seem to come out of inexhaustible fountains of fairmindedness and intellectual geniality; which did not savor somehow of that native largeness which the philosophers attributed to Magnanimous Man.\n\nG. K. Chesterton, commenting on twenty years of debate with Shaw on political, religious and other social issues.\n\nHe said that one should never tell a child anything without letting him hear the opposite opinion. That is to say, when you tell Tommy not to hit his sick sister on the temple, you must make sure of the presence of some Nietzscheite professor, who will explain to him that such a course might possibly serve to eliminate the unfit. When you are in the act of telling Susan not to drink out of the bottle labelled \"poison,\" you must telegraph for a Christian Scientist, who will be ready to maintain that without her own consent it cannot do her any harm. What would happen to a child brought up on Shaw's principle I cannot conceive; I should think he would commit suicide in his bath.\n\nG. K.

Keynes et al., London, The New Statesman and Nation, (1934) p. 34\n\nShaw was a very great man indeed. The danger is that when all the froth and nonsense about his being a philosopher has died down (as it must) a reaction should set in and lead people to forget his real genius. He was a comedian, in his own time, of the very highest order ... He was a humorist of the more intellectual kind, a master of satire, art and fantasy like Gilbert, Wilde and Aristophanes. In that class no one had more continuous vitality. He is also, in his prefaces, one of the great masters of plain prose. I have often, in that capacity, held him up as a model to my pupils and have learned much from him myself. Peace to his ashes!\n\nC. S. Lewis, in \"Comedian of Highest Order\", in The Mark Twain Journal, Vol. 9, no. 4 (Summer 1954), p. 10\n\nHe did his best in redressing the fateful unbalance between truth and reality, in lifting mankind to a higher rung of social maturity. He often pointed a scornful finger at human frailty, but his jests were never at the expense of humanity.\n\nThomas Mann, as quoted in Penguin Classics edition of Plays Unpleasant (1946)\n\nDesmond MacCarthy, whom I tried to persuade to write a new appreciation of Shaw in old age, noticed a real deterioration in Shaw himself. The Shaw who had praised Mussolini and justified Hitler grew increasingly irresponsible in suggesting that people who were a nuisance should be killed. This strain in Shaw, and his characteristic inconsistency when he dropped back suddenly into individualism, after maintaining the State's right to liquidate anyone it disapproved of, had been growing steadily stronger from Major Barbara onwards. He ceased to have a genuine humanism such as he had shown in the splendid preface to John Bull's Other Island. In general, re-reading Shaw, MacCarthy said he could find nothing but \"a chaos of clear ideas\".\n\nKingsley Martin, Editor: A Second Volume of Autobiography, 1931-45 (1968), p. 110\n\nHe understood early the weakness of democracy; he was naturally impatient with the shallow humbug of much political talk. There was so much in it to laugh at, and so much to expose, that he even allowed himself to praise Mussolini and Hitler and to excuse all the darker deeds of Stalin. In 1948 he "
