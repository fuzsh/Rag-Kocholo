William Shaw was a Scots-Irishman born at County Wexford, Ireland on 2 Nov 1735. He was the son of Robert Shaw and Mary Markham, who lived at Sandpitts, in County Kilkenny.\n\nWishing to become a professional soldier, Shaw enlisted about 1754 in His Majesty's 42nd Regiment of Foot, a Highland regiment then stationed in Ireland and better known as the \"Black Watch.\" The 42nd were famous for having participated in the Battle of Culloden Moor in April 1746.\n\nWilliam married on 5 August 1755 to Miss Jane Wood, the daughter of Thomas Wood.\n\nIn 1756, the King sent the 42nd Foot to North America, and Shaw shipped out with them. He served the British Army throughout the French and Indian War. According to the unit's regimental history, \"the second battalion of the Black Watch was sent to the Caribbean, but after the losses of Ticonderoga, the two battalions were consolidated in New York.\"\n\nBetween the years 1756 and 1760, Shaw seems to have been stationed near Mt. Airy in Orange County, New York. Russel Headley's \"History of Orange County\" has a section on the Shaw family which indicates local land records show one William Shaw buying up land grants (bounty lands awarded to the military) in Orange county.\n\nAt about this time Shaw's unit was placed under the command of Gen. Eyre Massey. According to William Shaw's biographers, he was present at one of Massey's greatest victories, the Surrender of Montreal in 1760.\n\nSgt. William Shaw purchased a commission in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot in October 1761 and participated in the sieges of Martinique (January 1762) and Havana, Cuba (August 1762). Having acquitted himself well in Havana, he was promoted lieutenant in the 40th Regiment of Foot (which had participated in the Siege of Havana in June 1762).\n\nIn June 1763 the 40th Foot was rotated out of Havana and moved to Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, where it remained until 1767.\n\nAfter the French and Indian war, Maj. William Shaw settled at Granville, Nova Scotia. Some biographies indicate he married Jane Wood at Annapolis Royal in 1765 and served briefly as the Sheriff of Halifax County. His regiment returned to Cork, Ireland in 1767.\n\nWhile living in Ireland, William Shaw married secondly to Miss Esther English in 1769. They had at least four children.\n\nWilliam Shaw returned to North America in 1772, with the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot. Note: Some disambiguation is required. The Capt, William Shaw of this profile is not identical to the Capt. William Shaw born 1751 at Tillingham, Essex, (qv) who also served the British Army during the Revolution.\n\nWith the 47th Regiment, William served in New Jersey and Boston. According to Wikipedia: \"On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1773, the 47th was posted to New Jersey. It took part in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 and the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775.\"\n\nWilliam Shaw acted at various times as adjutant, paymaster, and deputy judge advocate for the regiment. He was forced to leave the 47th in 1775 \"thro' necessity, not choice.\" It is not clear why he left. It appears that he fell afoul of Gen. Sir William Howe (1729 - 1814), who commanded the British troops at Bunker Hill.\n\nCatherine Pross states in her article on William Shaw that he returned to Nova Scotia, where he \"engaged in commerce\" and was elected to the House of Assembly from Annapolis County. \"When he was commissioned in the Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers by Governor Francis Legge that year, he left his commercial activities, but he later lost his commission through the influence of Sir William Howe, a former commander.\"\n\nIn 1775 the inhabitants of Annapolis County petitioned Major-General Eyre Massey, commander of the 27th Enniskilling Foot regiment, which was then stationed in Nova Scotia, to ask William Shaw to raise a company of militia for the defence of the district.\n\nShaw was then Commissioned as a major in the militia in January 1776. \"Shaw raised the company by July and requested Massey that the men be furnished with pay, provisions, and equipment since they had only what Shaw had supplied.\"\n\nIn January 1777, Shaw was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Annapolis County, \"and in April succeeded in being recommissioned in the Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers.\" Shortly afterwards, however, he was asked to return his commission. Prosser assumes that this was because he was disliked: \"in spite of his efforts, Shaw remained out of favour in military circles.\"\n\nThe Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers never saw military action, and Shaw's activities for the key years of 1777 to 1781 remain unclear. He seems to have remained at Halifax, pursuing his family's commercial interests. Here it should be noted that the Shaw family of Greenock, as members of the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, had held interests in Nova Scotia since 1667.\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary war, many Loyalist troops and their commanders were moved to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\n\n\"By 1781,\" says Pross, \"Shaw had obtained the office of sheriff of Halifax County.\" Public service soon proved to be a serious headache, however. Shaw's political enemies quickly accused him of embezzlement. He supposedly kept many of the financial fines which he had levied as sheriff.\n\nFor William Shaw's accounts ledger, see: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine.\n\nIn 1783, William Shaw was removed from the office of Sheriff.\n\nAccording to Prosser's article, a bill regulating the Sheriff's office was approved by the local legislature. \"One of its stipulations was that the sheriff of Halifax County own at least a £1,000 freehold in the county. By November 1783 Shaw had lost his office.\"\n\n\"One year later [1784], for 'having refused to attend and produce vouchers to his accounts as a public accountant, having been Sheriff of Halifax County,' he was pronounced in contempt of the assembly, his seat declared vacant, and he was ordered taken into custody.\"\n\nShaw somehow managed to avoid arrest, and in response to the charges Shaw hotly declared that he had saved the government \"to the amount of £20,000\" in his work of \"Mustering the Loyalists &ca.\"\n\nShaw must have had supporters, for by 1784 we find he was still holding a public office. The Nova Scotia archives contain a petition of William Shaw asking for a salary in his new job as \"Clerk of the Supreme Court at Annapolis.\"\n\nBy early 1785 he had actually received an amazing promotion. \"Major-General John Campbell appointed him provost marshal of the British forces in Nova Scotia, describing him as 'an Officer of long service and respectable Character.' \"\n\nThis was no small act of patronage. Field Marshall John Campbell, the 5th Duke of Argyll and Marquess of Lorne (1723 - 1826) had commanded a regiment at the Battle of Culloden Moor, and he was one of the most highly respected Scotsmen in the British Army. When he extended his protection to Shaw, nearly everyone backed down.\n\nHow long Maj. William Shaw held the position of provost marshal is not clear, but \"by 1786 he had returned to England, where he petitioned Lord Sydney, secretary of state for the Home Department, for half pay as a provincial colonel, citing his services and complaining that he 'found himself without either Appointment or Provision whatever.' \"\n\nBetween the years 1786 and 1788, William Shaw returned to Ireland, where he lived near his family in County Kilkenny and County Wexford.\n\nAround 1788, when the British war office decided to reinforce the Canadian frontier, Maj. William Shaw returned to America, where he was granted additional lands north of the Bay of Quinte in Upper Canada (present-day Ontario).\n\nWilliam became one of the founders and pioneer settlers of the \"Cataraqui Townships\" and he is clearly listed on the land records there.\n\nMaj. William Shaw lived for many years at Fredericksburgh and Kingston, Ontario, where he became a prosperous farmer with a large family. Having married twice, he left many children and grandchildren behind him.\n\nMaj. William Shaw died 1813 at Kingston, Frontenac County, Ontario. There is a gravestone bearing the name William Shaw at St. Paul's Anglican Churchyard, next to the gravestone of his wife.\n\nSOURCES\n\nFamily Trees Online\n\nBushy Park Shaw Family Tree\n\nThe Clan Shaw: Historical Summary, ClanShaw.org\n\n\"Descendants of Adam and Eve to Shaw,\" Descendants of Shaw (Mac~an~Toisich) website\n\n\"Descendants of Shaw MacDuff to Bernard Shaw and Frances Carr,\" Descendants of Shaw (Mac~an~Toisich) website\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw Family Tree - WikiMedia Commons\n\nLaurence, Dan H. \"Part One: The Shaws and the Gurlys\" from Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies, Vol. 18.

This book is also available as a free and downloadable PDF at ElectricScotland.com.\n\nThe Two Bernards\n\nNote that Burke's Peerage seems to have flip-flopped the records of William's third son, Bernard Shaw (1773 - 1826), with that of his cousin Bernard Shaw (1775 - 1808), the son of Robert Shaw.\n\nThis mix-up has caused all sorts of confusion in the Shaw family tree.\n\nThe problem can be fixed very easily by simply making a reasonable estimate of the marriage dates and birth dates involved.\n\nConclusion: Bernard Shaw (1773 - 1826), the son of Maj. William Shaw of Kilkenny, is the Bernard Shaw who married Frances Carr and became the ancestor of playwright George Bernard Shaw. (To confirm this, see the image of the Shaw family tree, attached.) He is the first cousin of\n\nBernard Shaw (1775 - 1808), the son of Robert Shaw of Kilkenny. This is the Bernard Shaw who moved to Cork, became the Collector of Cork, and died there in 1808. He lived at Monkstown castle and became the head of the \"Shaws of Cork.\" His older brother, Sir Robert Shaw, 1st Baronet (1774 - 1849), moved to Dublin and became the head of the Bushy Park Shaws.\n\nBoth branches clearly stem from the Shaws of County Kilkenny.\n\nApril 1768 Marriage Record\n\nA marriage notice from Edward Finn's Leinster Journal, dated 30 April 1768, reads \"Married: Mr. William Shaw of Bessborough to Miss Esther English of Waterford.\"\n\nSource: Henderson, Archibald. George Bernard Shaw, Man of the Century (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1956) Vol. 1, p. 3.\n\nSee also Crawford, Fred D. \"The Shaws and the Gurlys\" from Shaw: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies, Vol. 18, p. 11. Indicates William Shaw, eldest son of Robert Shaw, married Esther English of Waterford, \"who may or may not have been dau. of the rector of Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, in 1768.\"\n\nMIlitary Service Records\n\nReference to British military records and the Dictionary of Canadian Biography make William Shaw's service record very clear. See the details below.\n\n1755 First Marriage to Jane Wood\n\nPross states that William Shaw married Jane, daughter of Thomas Wood, \"probably in 1764 at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia; they had a 'pretty large family'; fl. 1759 - 1789.\"\n\n1759 Enlistment in 42nd Regiment of Foot\n\nA detailed Canadian biography for the soldier William Shaw, who has no clear birth date or birth place, may be found in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, and it dovetails very nicely with the record of William Shaw of Kilkenny, Ireland. It commences in 1759, when William Shaw appears on the lists of the 42nd Regiment of Foot.\n\nIn her biography of William Shaw of Nova Scotia and Ontario, published in volume 4 of the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Catherine Pross says he was born \"probably in Scotland.\" In the opinion of this genealogist, she is mistaken: He is Scotch-Irish and a descendant of the Scottish Clan Schaw of Sauchie, but he was born in County Kilkenny, Ireland. He joined the 42nd Foot while they were stationed in Ireland.\n\nIn 1759 William Shaw \"served as a volunteer with the 42nd Regiment of Foot at the siege of Guadeloupe; he may also have been present at the British capture of Montreal in 1760. (See the Wikipedia article \"French and Indian War.\")\n\n1761 Commission in 43rd Regiment of Foot\n\nHe purchased a commission in the 43rd Foot in October 1761 and participated in the sieges of Martinique and Havana, Cuba. Having acquitted himself well in Havana, he was promoted lieutenant in the 40th Foot. In 1763 he accompanied his regiment to Nova Scotia.\n\n1765 Return to Ireland\n\nIn 1765 Shaw's regiment was sent to Ireland, and he lived there for several years. This adds weight to the claim that the William Shaw who served the British Army in Canada was identical to William Shaw of Sandpitts, Kilkenny, Ireland.\n\nIt is certainly interesting to note that William Shaw's son Bernard Shaw of Kilkenny and County Cork named one of his descendants Eyre Massey Shaw, after Eyre Massey, 1st Baron Clarina, the commander of the 27th Enniskilling regiment, an Irish regiment that served with distinction in Upper Canada during the 1750s.\n\nWikipedia tells us: \"In 1757 he [Eyre Massey] went out to North America as a major 46th foot, of which he became lieutenant-colonel in 1758, and the year after commanded the regiment in the expedition to Niagara, succeeding to the command of the king's troops when Brigadier-general John Prideaux was killed.\"\n\nIn other words, the Shaws of Kilkenny, Ireland named a descendant Eyre Massey Shaw because William Shaw served along side him in Canada, during the Niagara campaign. Their admiration for Eyre Massey was based on personal experience.\n\nWhere William Shaw lived while stationed in Ireland during the years 1765 to 1772 is unclear, but some sources say he lived at Cork.\n\nPross traced William through local church records. \"Originally educated for holy orders, he applied while in Ireland to be ordained as a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, but despite his father-in-law's support, his request was refused.\"\n\n1767 Land Grant in Granville, Nova Scotia\n\nAlthough his regiment continued to be stationed in Ireland, William Shaw was granted 500 acres in Granville Township, near Annapolis Royal, in July 1767, and he is listed as head of a household in Granville Township in 1770.\n\n1768: Second Marriage to Esther English\n\nBurke's Peerage (1949, cited below) lists William Shaw's second marriage on page 1822:\n\n\"William [Shaw], of Sandpitts [County Kilkenny], m. Miss English, and had issue,\n\n1) Robert (Rev.), Rector of St. John's Kilkenny.\n\n2) John.\n\n3) Bernard, of Kilkenny, m. 1 April 1802, Frances Frances Carr, dau. of Rev. E. [Edward] Carr, and d. 3 Feb. 1826 leaving a son [George Carr Shaw of Dublin].\"\n\nAccording to a marriage notice placed in Edward Finn's Leinster Journal on 30 April 1768, they married in April of 1768. William is listed as William Shaw \"of Bessborough\" and Esther is listed as \"Miss Esther English of Waterford.\" Some sources say she was the daughter of the vicar at Thomastown, County Kilkenny.\n\nTheir first son Robert as born about 1769, Bernard was born about 1770, John was born in 1771.\n\nEsther English disappears from the record with the birth of John in 1771. She may have died in childbirth.\n\n1772 Return to America with the 47th Regiment of Foot\n\n\"In 1772 he exchanged into the 47th Foot and served with it in New Jersey and Boston. While in the army he acted at various times as adjutant, paymaster, and deputy judge advocate. In 1774 he left the army 'thro' necessity not choice.' \"\n\n1775: Asked by Eyre Massey to Raise a Company of Militia\n\nPross states that William Shaw returned to Nova Scotia, where he \"engaged in commerce\" and was elected to the House of Assembly from Annapolis County. \"When he was commissioned in the Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers by Governor Francis Legge that year, he left his commercial activities, but he later lost his commission through the influence of Sir William Howe, a former commander.\"\n\nIn 1775 the inhabitants of Annapolis County petitioned Major-General Eyre Massey, commander of the 27th Enniskilling Foot regiment, which was then stationed in Nova Scotia, to ask William Shaw to raise a company of militia for the defence of the district.\n\n1776: Commissioned as a Major\n\nCommissioned as a major in the militia in January 1776, \"Shaw raised the company by July and requested Massey that the men be furnished with pay, provisions, and equipment since they had only what Shaw had supplied.\"\n\n1777: Justice of the Peace for Annapolis County, Nova Scotia\n\nIn January 1777, Shaw was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Annapolis County, \"and in April succeeded in being recommissioned in the Loyal Nova Scotia Volunteers. Shortly afterwards, however, he was asked to return his commission. Prosser assumes that this was because he was disliked: \"in spite of his efforts, Shaw remained out of favour in military circles.\"\n\n1781: Sheriff of Halifax County, Nova Scotia\n\nAfter the Revolutionary war, many Loyalist troops and their commanders were moved to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. \"By 1781,\" says Pross, \"Shaw had obtained the office of sheriff of Halifax County.\"\n\n1782 William Shaw's account as Sheriff of the County of Halifax\n\nFor William Shaw's accounts ledger, see: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine\n\nNova Scotia House of Assembly Nova Scotia Archives RG 5 Series A vol. 1b no. 78\n\n30 September 1782: Petitions for compensation\n\nPetition of William Shaw, Colonel of Militia for Annapolis County for compensation for losses sustained during 1776.\n\nSee: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine, Nova Scotia House of Assembly Nova Scotia Archives RG 5 Series A vol. 1b no. 77\n\n1783: Removed from office as Sheriff\n\nAccording to Prosser's article: \"Two years later an investigation in the assembly revealed that the sheriffs were not transmitting money collected from fines to the provincial treasury. A bill regulating their office and appointment was therefore considered; one of its stipulations was that the sheriff of Halifax County own at least a £1,000 freehold in the county. By November 1783 Shaw had lost his office.\"\n\n\"One year later [1784], for 'having refused to attend and produce vouchers to his accounts as a public accountant, having been Sheriff of Halifax County,' he was pronounced in contempt of the assembly, his seat declared vacant, and he was ordered taken into custody. He managed to avoid arrest, however . . . .\"\n\nShaw subsequently claimed that he had saved the government \"to the amount of £20,000\" in his work of \"Mustering the Loyalists &ca.\"\n\n1784: William Shaw requests a salary\n\nPetition of William Shaw, Clerk of the Supreme Court at Annapolis, asking for a Salary.\n\nSee: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine, Nova Scotia House of Assembly Nova Scotia Archives RG 5 Series A vol. 1b no. 134\n\n22 November 1784\n\nLetter from William Shaw, M.L.A. to Thomas Cochran, Speaker, excusing himself from attending the House.\n\nSee: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine, Nova Scotia House of Assembly Nova Scotia Archives RG 5 Series A vol. 1b no. 128\n\n29 November 1784: Speaker of House orders Shaw's arrest\n\nLetter from Thomas Cochran, Speaker to Peter Etter Senr., Messenger ordering him to take William Shaw into custody to answer a charge of contempt.\n\nSee: Nova Scotia Archives, Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Petitions and Correspondence 1758 - 1850 Search Engine, Nova Scotia House of Assembly Nova Scotia Archives RG 5 Series A vol. 1b no. 129\n\n1785: Appointed Provost Marshal of British Forces in Nova Scotia\n\nEarly the following year \"Major-General John Campbell appointed him provost marshal of the British forces in Nova Scotia, describing him as 'an Officer of long service and respectable Character.' \"\n\n1786 Return to England and Petition for Appointment\n\nHow long he held the position of provost marshal is not clear, but \"by 1786 he had returned to England, where he petitioned Lord Sydney, secretary of state for the Home Department, for half pay as a provincial colonel, citing his services and complaining that he 'found himself without either Appointment or Provision whatever.' \"\n\nPross says that by 1789 Shaw \"had once again returned to Granville, but no further record of him remains.\"\n\nIn fact, because he is the father of the Capt. William Shaw (1751 - 1822) who served as a muster officer in Sir John Johnson's Royal Regiment of New York, a great deal of record remains.\n\nIt seems that Shaw was indeed appointed as a provincial colonel and rewarded for his previous service with lands in Ontario. We find not one but two William Shaws settling on lands above the Bay of Quinte in Ontario, and a grave site for William and Jane Shaw at Kingston, Ontario that seems to exactly match the record of Maj. William Shaw of Ireland and Nova Scotia.\n\nWilliam Sr. Mentioned in The History of Orange County New York\n\nFrom: The History of Orange County New York Edited by: Russel Headley Van Deusen and Elms, Publishers Middletown, N. Y. 1908\n\n\"THE SHAW FAMILY. - The Shaw family was among the early settlers in the northeastern part of the town, and until within a few years the original tract of land settled upon them was in the name of some of the family.\n\n\"About 1750 William Shaw moved to the town and was agent for a large tract of land owned by New York parties, with instructions to take what he wanted, sell what he could and give some away. The descendants of some of his friends to whom he gave farms are living in Orange County.\"\n\nThe William Shaw of this profile, born ca. 1730, settled in Orange County, New York, around 1750, and had a son, William Jr., who was born about 1755. A History of Orange County, cited below, indicates William Sr. was entrusted with distribution of local land grants (military bounty land grants), which suggests he may have participated in the French-Indian War of 1754.\n\nFor this reason, one may wonder if he is identical to Maj. William Shaw (1738 - 1813), the son of Robert Shaw and Mary Markham, who was born in 1738, and who married Jane Wood ca. 1753. This William Shaw served in America with the 42nd Regiment of Foot during the 1750s, and may have been stationed for a time in Orange County, New York area.\n\nUnfortunately, proof of the connection is difficult: There is little documentation.\n\nIn any case, William Sr.'s son, William Shaw Jr., certainly participated in the American Revolution as a Loyalist. The Canadian record indicates William Jr. immigrated to Canada ca. 1783, claiming land near Kingston, Ontario. He is listed as having held the rank of corporal in Sir John Johnson's Royal Regiment of New York militia, a loyalist unit raised in Orange and Tryon counties, New York.\n\nThis connection to New York is important, because the legends surrounding William Junior's wife, Mary Waldron, are confused. When one searches on her name, one finds her listed on both Orange County, New York records and records for Ontario, Canada.\n\nSon William Junior mentioned in same History of Orange County\n\n\"Soon after he came from Ireland [ca. 1790] and had made a clearing, he sent for his intended wife (Mary Waldron). She came from New York to New Windsor on a sloop and was met by him and taken to his home on horseback, for at that time it was the only way he could travel between the two points.\n\n\"They had children and many of their descendants are still in that vicinity, among them being\n\nWilliam Shaw, who married Rachel Schoonoven, son of William and Mary W. Shaw, inherited the homestead and died there. Two of his [William Jr.'s] sons, Aaron and Howard, became quite distinguished. The former was state attorney, judge of the Supreme Court and twice elected to Congress in Illinois. The latter (Howard), who married Abby M. Tryon, was a noted auctioneer, and\n\nWickham T. Shaw, his son, who married Clara A. Mapes, is the last male descendant in that line living. He has three sons, Howard, Charles and H. James Aaron, and one daughter, Florence.\"\n\nThe local history for Orange County, New York indicates William and his bride Mary Waldron moved to Orange County, New Yorkaround 1790 and had children there. The records for Canada indicate that William Jr. brought his bride Mary Waldron from Ireland to Canada ca. 1792, to join his family near Kingston.\n\nIf William Shaw Jr. was the descendant of Maj. William Shaw (1738 - 1813) of County Kilkenny, Ireland, then both legends could be true: Major Shaw was born in Ireland and stationed both in New York and Ontario during the military engagements of the 1750s and the 1770s.\n\nIf Maj. Shaw had a son, William Junior, born to Esther English Shaw back home in Ireland in 1755, and that son, William Junior, joined his father's unit to fight in the American Revolution, then married a local New York girl in 1777, he would naturally join his father in Ontario after the war, and perhaps go back to Ireland for a few years to visit family, even while his wife had family remaining in Orange County, New York.\n\nIn other words, the Shaws of Ontario seem to have straddled the border between New York and Canada, living on both sides. In either case, it was William Jr., not William Sr., who married Mary Waldron Shaw (1759 - 1819) and brought her (back) to America.\n\nThis must be emphasized, because we have a contradictory Find A Grave page (cited below) which suggests Mary Waldron married to William Shaw Sr. (1735 - 1822). Given the age difference, that is highly unlikely. She was much closer in age to the son, not the father.\n\nThe following biography is taken from an article by Ernest G. Cook that may be found in the Watertown, NY Daily Times on Nov. 11, 1940. It is a seriously garbled re-telling of the Shaw family history for Orange County, New York, and how the Irish Shaws of New York wound up in Ontario.\n\nRomance of Old Ireland Is Recalled In Canada\n\n(By Ernest C. Cook)\n\nResidents near Lansdowne Tell Story of Shaw family, Early Settlers in Ontario William Shaw, Baker in Household of Irish Lord, Fell in Love And Eloped with Lady Mary, Only Daughter of the House - Couple set Out for Canada in 1792.\n\nLansdowne, Ont., Nov. 11, 1940\n\n\"Has any person ever told you about the romance of William Shaw and his settling on Hogs Back Hill just below Lansdowne Turn?\".\n\nI had stopped on the King's Highway, No.2, for information about certain pioneer families of that region when the people of that household asked the question and indicated that there was an interesting story connected with the pioneer Shaw family. Here is the story as it was told to me:\n\n\"William Shaw was born in the county of Armagh, Ireland, in the year 1767, his parents being of the fanner class. When a youth in his teens he was put to work in the home of a rich gentleman, a man of the nobility class with a large estate. William was put to work in the bakery of the castle and in time became quite an expert baker and was a great favorite in the household . A laughing, happy, ready-to-do-Iad, he even attracted the attention of Lady Mary, beautiful and only Daughter of the house\".\n\n\"In time the servants noticed that Lady Mary was seeking the company of William and that he seemed to think much of Lady Mary. This was reported to Sir and Lady Waldron but they laughed it off, saying that no girl in the position of Lady Mary would permit herself to fall in love with a servant\".\n\n\" Lady Mary, however, did just that and eloped with the handsome William Shaw. Her parents we re shocked, and angered by the act. They at once disowned Lady Mary and cut her off from the family and the large estate which would have been hers had she remained in the home\" .\n\n\"This did not seem to affect the happiness of William Shaw and Lady Mary for they found a place to live and he was able by his backing to support her comfortably. Three children were born to them and as William and his young wife talked over the future they found themselves thinking more and more about Canada that seemed to have wealth for all and an equal opportunity. Stories coming from the New World told of land in and about a place called Kingston. So they decided to go there\".\n\n\"In the year 1792 they set sail after bidding goodbye to all their relatives and friends, but with never a kindly or helpful word from Lady Mary's parents. William said they would gain a home and wealth in Canada and he was ready to work good and hard to gain that end. It was a long, hard trip. The ship was slow, the waters rough and the little family of five often wondered at night .if they would ever see Iland. At last, after much hardship and toil, they started their trip up the St. Lawrence River\".\n\n\"And that was a long, hard trip, especially to get around rapids of the river and start out anew from the Prescott port. But they knew they were now near their destination and William was happy in the fact that he would soon be able to start his home on his own land. But there was one sad note, - Lady Mary was ill. The ship doctor pronounced it a fever and probably a weakness caused by the long trip on ship. One morning the captain said that by night they would reach Kingston harbor, but Lady Mary reached the end of her trip just before Kingston was sighted. She died of the fever on board the ship within but a few hours of the goal\".\n\n\"William was heart-broken and the Captain, a kindly soul, brought the ship about and dropped anchor just off Amherst Island and on that island a grave was dug and Mary was buried. There was nothing left or William to do but to take his family to Kingston and there he sought a place to lodge them while he looked about for land. On the Hogs back, near Lansdowne, he picked his farm and there over 130 years ago he built a stone house. He prospered, and died an old man there. He is buried in Lansdowne cemetery, which is on the present King's Highway No.2\".\n\n\"And the descendants of William Shaw are many and prominent\", continued the party telling the story. \"But you will want to see the house, still standing on the Hogs back Hill, and learn about the gold that was buried there and how the descendants, many of them, made their homes in this area\".\n\nThe Shaw Family of Hogsback Hill Farm Escott\n\n\"In this issue we are featuring Hogsback Hill Farm in Escott Township where Confederate gold was thought to be buried. In the early days this farm was owned by William Shaw [Jr.] and his descendants. William Shaw [III] was born about 1786 in the Diocese of Ossary Co. Kilkenny Ireland. He married about 1811 Mary Waldron [Mary Ann Woods] who was also born in Ossary about 1790.\n\n\"There is no proof that she came from a titled family as tradition suggests. The Shaws of Kilkenny all seem to be related and connected to the estate given to William Shaw following the Battle of the Boyne in 1689. George Bernard Shaw's grandfather was born on this estate. At some point William [Jr.] and Mary [Waldron] moved to Wexford as their three children were born there. They came to Canada in 1820. Mary became ill and died while travelling up the St. Lawrence. The ship captain put in at Amherst Island where she was buried. William and the children found their way to Escott where the family appears on the census of 1821. He purchased the farm known as Hogs Hill Farm. He married Elizabeth Acton the widow of Joseph Acton. She died Aug. 6, 1845 and is buried in Lansdowne Cemetery. He married a third time to Mary Ann surname unknown. William died between 1861 and 1871.\"\n\nFind A Grave Memorial\n\nMaj.
