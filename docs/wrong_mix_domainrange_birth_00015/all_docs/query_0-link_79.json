        "text": "You may wonder why a village in Brittany is the setting for a story about Lafayette (as he is known in America). This is the Saint-Goustan quarter of Auray, a beautiful town situated on the Auray River, far from the action of the Revolutionary War. It's unlikely that Major General Lafayette ever visited but he was the brains and the name behind the landing of\n\na very famous American on these shores.\n\nSaint-Goustan welcomed American founding father Benjamin Franklin as he arrived to ask for support for the New World's fight against the tyranny of the British. It was December of 1776 when Franklin disembarked on the banks of the river town. Lafayette was instrumental in pushing for this support from the crown (King Louis XVI) of France. He used every bit of his own influence to beg for cash, arms and bodies to help America win her fight.\n\nIt seems like every other business in this town is named after the famous American. It's particularly perplexing that American visitors are more likely to find their former foe, the British who seem to favor this part of France, than their own American counterparts at this moving historical site. You'll rub your eyes as you see the name Benjamin Franklin on practically every corner of the village. The large and inviting cobbled square is a wonderful place to relax and contemplate the long-lasting friendship of France with the U.S.A.\n\nKnown in France as the Marquis de La Fayette (note the separation of La & Fayette), Gilbert du Motier was an aristocrat who hailed from the Auvergne region.\n\nBorn to a wealthy and titled French family, he was more interested in the fresh ideals of American independence from the British than he was\n\nin his own birth country's causes. Joining the American Revolution at the age of 19,\n\nhe served at his own expense, including buying the very ship that brought him\n\n(and many other Frenchmen) to our shores.\n\nDuring America's Revolutionary War, he become the right hand of another American hero, General George Washington. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Brandywine where he fought alongside General Washington (and was promoted to Major General) and at the Siege of Yorktown where he battled it out with Cornwallis.\n\nLafayette was enamored with the whole idea of America's independence and democracy.\n\n\"The Hero of Two Worlds\" brought these principles back to France to help influence their transition from the reign of kings. He wrote a large portion of France's Declaration of the Rights of Man & of the Citizen with the help of his good friend and ally, Thomas Jefferson.\n\nSadly, Lafayette found himself in dire straits during the French Revolution where he spent more than 5 years in prison during their Reign of Terror. Napoleon Bonaparte stepped up to release and recognize the imprisoned frenchman so he could continue good works to aid mankind.\n\nBenjamin Franklin at Court in France\n\nBoth Presidents held Lafayette in High Regard\n\nLafayette was an abolitionist, arguing to end the slave trade in both America and France. He urged George Washington to abolish the practice and establish former slaves\n\nas tenant farmers.\n\nGeneral Lafayette paid homage to his commander, the 1st American president,\n\nby naming his son after him - George Washington de La Fayette. Many towns in the U.S. have paid their respects to the French commander by naming towns,\n\nstreets and squares after him.\n\nHe received an honorary degree from Harvard as well as full American citizenship.\n\nBuried in Paris, Lafayette is interred in a small cemetery in the 12th arrondissement. Picpus Cemetery is better known as the resting place of 16 Carmelite nuns who went singing to their deaths in the murderous summer of 1794. Some 1300 people are buried in a mass grave at Picpus, all of them decapitated during the reign of terror. The soil on and around the general's grave was taken from Bunker Hill. He rests in peace, forever a friend to America and a reminder of the ties that bind France and the U.S.A.\n\nCelebrating American independence, immortalized at Galerie David d'Angers in the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Angers.\n\nThe man who wanted France to follow America's example was given full funeral honors by American President Andrew Jackson. Flags were flown at half-mast for 35 days and many\n\nU.S. citizens wore black in his honor for a full month just as they did when they honored both President Washington and President John Adams.\n\nLafayette, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson\n\nare forever our honored heroes in the fight for independence.\n\nSo, too, should we pay our respects to the history that took place\n\nin the little French village of Auray.\n\nMake sure to stop at the Saint-Goustan quarter on your next trip to France and think of a\n\nbrave American and a brave Frenchman who conspired to win support for the cause of\n\nliberty in the New World.\n\nMerci, General Lafayette, for your help in securing our freedom.\n\nThis is What I Crave When I'm Strolling the Streets of Paris\n\nLife on rue Daguerre is as authentic and purely Parisian as you'll find anywhere in the city.\n\nThis is not opulent Paris or even majestic Paris. It's ordinary -- and that's a good thing.\n\nIf you're looking for a slice-of-life neighborhood, this community is your place.\n\nLocated in the 14th arrondissement, the street is steps away from Denfert Rochereau,\n\na great stop that offers service on both the Metro and the RER\n\n(with quick access to Roissy-Charles DeGaulle Airport).\n\nIt's a destination I always return to, continually finding new surprises that delight.\n\nWith each and every visit, it always manages to tug at my heart strings.\n\nIsn't that why we come back to Paris again and again?\n\nI Dream of Cheese\n\nTwo destinations of particular interest await you on rue Daguerre.\n\nMaison Péret, sometimes called Le Rallye Péret, is a brasserie located in the middle of this hustle-bustle market street. It's open 7 days a week, convenient to both locals and travelers, worthy of a special trip to this neighborhood. I never miss the heavenly experience of dining\n\nal fresco on their patio where I can enjoy the engaging commotion of the shopping street.\n\nFeasting on a simple but delightful mix of salad greens, the plate showboats three different cheeses that crown grilled Poilâne bread (the blue is my favorite). Paired with a delightful glass of the grape from their wine shop located adjacent to the restaurant, Maison Péret is exactly what you crave in Paris. Bonus: Berthillon ice cream is on offer for dessert.\n\nFamily friendly, it's one of those dining experiences that isn't hot or trendy, just good.\n\nFour generations of the Péret family have been working hard at their craft since 1919.\n\nIt's a great chance to experience an authentic bite of Paris.\n\nBravo Family Péret!\n\nSpeaking of cheese, historic fromage purveyor Androuet has opened a boutique on rue Daguerre. Think historic, artisnal, delightful. Camembert, Brie de Melun, Ossau Iraty, Cantal, Comté, Roquefort, blue d'Auvergne and many more favorites can be discovered at this\n\ntiny shop. The lines are sometimes long but it's worth the wait. This is not grocery store cheese. It's the real deal and the staff is both knowledgeable and dedicated to getting it right.\n\nRue Daguerre is named after Louis Daguerre, the so-called \"Father of Photography.\"\n\nHe invented the Daguerreotype process of photography, well known in American as the process used by Matthew Brady to shoot those great American portraits of the day that\n\nhelped document the time of the Civil War.\n\nThis photo, taken in Paris, was captured some time around 1938. It's not that different from the Polaroids taken in my childhood. Isn't it hard to imagine life before still pictures?\n\nMonsieur Daguerre was gifted. He was well known, too, as an artist and theatre designer.\n\nBut I like him best because of the little street in Paris that he inspired. A street where you can find charcuterie, steaming paella, fresh figs and cherries, designer chocolate and much more.\n\nIt's a neighborhood to remember.\n\nPlease, if you haven't already discovered the charms of rue Daguerre, add it to your next adventure in Paris.\n\nFresher than Fresh Vegetables Decorate Rue Daguerre\n\nCan we ever really get enough of Paris?\n\nOne day I googled Paris fanatic, completely prepared to see my name in lights. It's true, I'm a bit deranged when it comes to my favorite city -- but then again, I suppose it's not much different from being an over-the-top sports fan or an obsessed shoe fanatic.\n\nCole Porter understood. When he penned the iconic \"I Love Paris\", every singer wanted to record it. Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Andy Williams, Maurice Chevalier, Jack Jones and even a recent cut by Lana Del Ray, \"I Love Paris\" never goes out of style. Kind of like the city.\n\n\"Every time I look down on this timeless town\n\nWhether blue or gray be her skies\n\nWhether loud be her cheers or whether soft be her tears\n\nMore and more do I realize That I love Paris in the spring time\n\nI love Paris in the fall\n\nI love Paris in the winter when it drizzles\n\nI love Paris in the summer when it sizzles\n\nI love Paris every moment\n\nEvery moment of the year\n\nI love Paris, why oh, why do I love Paris?\n\nBecause my love is near\"\n\nI don't care how corny I sound. When it comes to Paris, I just want to inhale it and preserve it.\n\nSee, eat, drink, do. Listen, taste, feel, breathe.\n\nWhat is it about Paris that makes some of us daffy?\n\nIs it the grand boulevards? The resplendent architecture? The soaring Eiffel Tower?\n\nMaybe, but I think it's the small things, those little pleasures we find unexpectedly.\n\nThe delicious sprig of parsley that startles your taste buds. Parsley? Really? Yes, parsley.\n\nOr little old men in Luxembourg Gardens slowly strolling down the garden path.\n\nIt could be the concierge sweeping the front hall of your apartment building\n\nas she pretends not to stare at you.\n\nOr perhaps it's the waiter who pauses a moment to notice that you're enjoying the house paté.\n\nIt's the whiff of the boulangerie every morning and\n\nthe stench of the cheese shop in the evening.\n\nThen again, I think it may be the lace curtains in the crèperie that bring back\n\nmemories of Grandma.\n\nParis. It just works.\n\nGo ahead, call me a Paris nut.\n\nI gladly accept the title -- in blazing neon lights.\n\nMr. Sinatra Loved Paris -- Any Time of the Year\n\nThey Love Paris, too\n\nMost people who have never been to Paris imagine sitting in a café for hours at a time, sipping a glass of red wine. It's a lovely thought but, in reality, somewhat of a fairytale.\n\nAsk any Frenchman or woman you know and they'll raise an eyebrow at the thought of sipping a red wine in the middle of the day. They're much more likely to order something different and save the red wine for lunch or dinner,\n\nalways pairing it with food.\n\nNow that I've burst your bubble, should that ruin your\n\nAudrey Hepburn moment in Paris?\n\nAbsolutely not! Here's what you may consider drinking in place of that mythical red:\n\nPastis\n\nLillet\n\nKir or Kir Royale\n\nSuze\n\nChampagne\n\nBeer\n\nCocktails: Sidecar, French 75 or Black Rose\n\nLove It or Hate It, Suze Has a Unique Taste\n\nToulouse Lautrec Enjoyed a Glass or Two\n\nPastis is an anise flavored aperitif, served cold and made famous in the south of France. In Paris, it has enjoyed a resurgence of popularity, particularly with bartenders who enjoy mixing it\n\ninto some pretty outrageous concoctions. Ricard and Pernod are the most famous brands. Drink it like a local by pouring some into a tall beverage glass (it's fairly clear), then add cold water (now it appears milky!). Whatever you do, don't add ice, at least not until the pastis and water have already mixed.\n\nIf you like black licorice, you're going to love this drink.\n\nLillet hails from the Bordeaux region. It comes in both white and red, the white being more available and popular as an aperitif. It's a mix of Bordeaux white, mysterious herbs and a variety of orange peels, both sweet and bitter. Served cold, it's often accompanied by the peel of either an orange or a lime. Sometimes served on ice in a short glass, other times it arrives in a wine glass. Popular but sometimes hard to find in Paris. Guess who else enjoys its honeyed flavors: Hannibal Lector, James Bond and Carmela Soprano. Draw your own conclusions!\n\nKir is white wine (usually chadonnay or chablis) mixed with creme de cassis (blackcurrant liquer) or occasionally with creme de mûre (blackberry), pêche (peach) or violet. Named after Felix Kir, one-time mayor of Dijon, it became famous after WWII when the famous red Burgundies were in short supply due to the plundering Nazis, who collected thousands of bottles of the precious red nectar. The bad guys left the whites behind for the most part so someone got enterprising and invented - ta-da - the Kir. A kir royale substitutes champagne for the white wine. Everyone pours this drink differently, sometimes it's a bit too sweet because of the ratio of liquer to wine. Light and refreshing plus easy to pronounce!\n\nSuze is truly out of the ordinary. At first startled by it's almost bitter taste, I grew into it, enjoying its slightly medicinal flavor. Invented in Paris in the late 1800's, it was sometimes used as an herbal medicine to treat digestive problems. Gentian and bitters make up most of the unforgettable flavor. You will probably love it or hate it so if you're into gambling, take a chance and give it a try. Picasso must have had a taste for this abstract beverage. He featured it front and center in his collage Glass and a Bottle of Suze in 1912.\n\nChampagne is synonymous with France, with wine, with sheer pleasure. Any time of day is right to drink the bubbly and in Paris, you'll see it as the beverage of choice in many different situations.\n\nWhen in doubt, just order une coupe de champagne. Stylish and delicious.\n\nBeer just makes sense. Both popular and spectacular, beer is the beverage of choice for many in Paris. After all, the French embraced brasseries as their own creation. The word brasserie doesn't just mean delicious food, it actually means brewery. Some popular brands are Kronenbourg 1664, Jenlain Blonde, Stella Artois (from next-door neighbor Belgium) and many micro-brews. Are you thirsty yet?\n\nCocktails are on-trend right now. They're everywhere and pretty much anything goes, especially with the younger crowd. A Sidecar is classic Hollywood fare and includes cognac, Cointreau (a delicious orange liquer that hails from Angers, France) and lemon juice. The French 75 (supposedly named after the kick you get from a French 75 gun) mixes gin, champagne, lemon and sugar in a lethal dose. Beware! I've seen several different recipes for a Black Rose which makes me wonder about its origin but most include grenadine syrup, cognac, and bitters with some muddled blackberries during the season. I must also\n\nmention Jack Daniels Whiskey from my home state of Tennessee. Whenever French people ask about where I'm from, they always smile and either say Elvis or Jack. That says a lot for their taste.\n\nBut then we knew that.\n\nSalut!\n\nEnjoy your wine but remember all the other choices out there.\n\nCheers to all of you and thanks for visiting my blog!\n\nBooking a room is getting more and more expensive every year,\n\nespecially in €€€€ Paris.\n\nThe challenge is daunting but after years of hits and misses,\n\nI think I've figured out a few words of advice:\n\n1. DO YOUR HOMEWORK UPFRONT.\n\n2. NARROW THE LIST DOWN TO A SPECIFIC CRITERIA.\n\n3. FORGET-ABOUT-IT.\n\nLet me explain.\n\n1. Do Your Homework. Check out every available option, including location and preferred\n\ntype of accommodation. Ask yourself three main questions:\n\n(1) Do I want to be in the center of the action or on the fringe where it's quiet?\n\n(2) Transportation issues count -- when in Paris, make sure you're near a Metro stop. If you're staying in a countryside village, consider ease of road access and parking.\n\n(3) Stick to your budget and read reviews (not always reliable but at least helpful)\n\nto avoid any big surprises.\n\n2. Many people ooh and aah over deluxe accommodations and make it the focus of their trip. Personally, I'd rather spend the extra cash on food, drink and fun.\n\nYou can choose a fancy schmancy hotel. But let's face it, Paris is Paris\n\nand you're twice as likely to feel fulfilled by absorbing the most beautiful and interesting city in the world than by the sound system in your room.\n\nDo you really need to stay at a 5-star hotel to be happy?\n\nIt's better to consider whether you'd prefer an apartment in the Marais\n\nor a B&B near Montparnasse. Location, location, location\n\ncounts more than the number of stars associated with a property.\n\nAre you bold enough to try a new neighborhood?\n\nIt's fun to return to a place you know but then again, it's amazing to find a new favorite.\n\nIf you've haven't traveled much, this is your opportunity to learn as you go.\n\nI love apartments with extras like a washing machine and a small kitchen\n\nso I feel more like a local.\n\nBE FLEXIBLE.\n\n3. Once you've arrived at your new Paris digs, make the best of it. Even the quirks. That's part of what makes travel an adventure. You're not moving in for life, you're crafting your memoir. Your hotel/B&B/apartment isn't even worth a chapter in the adventure you're writing. Maybe a paragraph. You hope for the best but if it's not, it shouldn't ruin the whole narrative. Save room ($$) for a sequel.\n\nWith years of travel in Europe under our belt, we've laughed ourselves\n\nsilly over some of the situations we've encountered.\n\n1. The beautiful house in the picture you see here is located near Narbonne, a gorgeous city in the Languedoc region of France. We loved everything about it --- except that the door to our room wouldn't lock.\n\nWho wants to leave their room wide open to just anyone, right? The proprietors just shrugged and said \"Oh, we got rid of all the locks. People would lose their keys, it was a hassle so we decided not to worry about it.\"\n\nThe first night, I placed a heavy chair in front of the door so I could sleep in peace but after that we, too, realized it was no big deal. I felt right at home as people casually wandered down to breakfast in their dressing gowns and the proprietor\n\nwashed and dried my undies on a line for all to see.\n\n2. Another time, we stayed in a hotel where the owner, a typically reserved (quiet and aloof) French woman, screamed to high heaven at her husband in the kitchen while everyone ate breakfast in the dining room. Other than her high pitched melodrama, you could hear a pin drop in the room.\n\nNo one (French clientele only) raised an eyebrow.\n\nDisturbing at the time but a fun story to tell when we returned home.\n\n3. Early in our travels, we \"winged it\" from time to time and made hotel reservations only after we arrived in a city. We learned our lesson as\n\nwe tried to book a room at the last minute in Senlis, a charming,\n\nhistorical, medieval (translation = popular) town just north of Paris.\n\nThere was no room at the inn. Finally, we found a little place,\n\nwell located but slightly shabby, and booked for one night only.\n\nThe room decoration was interesting.\n\nPortraits of Brigitte Bardot and Elizabeth Taylor\n\nwere framed just above our bed.\n\nMy man was happy.\n\n4. Staying in a wonderfully located apartment in Paris for a whole month, our landlord was mortified that he had to send a plumber over one morning\n\nto fix a leak dripping from our bathroom into the apartment below.\n\nIt was no big deal to us. He showed up on time and we all enjoyed a very pleasant conversation as he plied his trade.\n\nOur landlord apologized with a dozen macaroons from Ladurée and a top notch bottle of champagne for our trouble.\n\nLandlord 0; Gary & Michelle 10.\n\n5. We stayed in a lovely B&B in Honfleur (Normandy). The proprietor explained we'd have to let ourselves in if we stayed out after midnight. We arrived late and spent twenty whole minutes figuring out that you had to turn the key TWICE to open the door. We've never forgotten that lesson and have encountered the same type of lock several times through the years.\n\n6. Our hotels in Paris have varied from small to smaller. My husband still talks about the time the bathroom was so snug, you had to stick your butt out the door to wash your face and turn your whole body sideways to sit on the toilet.\n\nI believe it was called a Hotel of Charm in the guidebook. ;)\n\n7. Speaking of toilets, we once enjoyed a hotel stay in the Dordogne, where there was a skylight right above the commode. The view of the village's 14th century castle was pure perfection, seeming to hang over our heads and we fought over who got to enjoy the view,\n\nespecially at night when it lit up the sky.\n\nIf you watch and enjoy House Hunters International and you especially enjoy the Paris episodes with Adrian Leeds, the transplated American with an attitude (love it!), listen to her carefully. She never promises perfection. Her basic attitude is hey, this is Paris for crying out loud.\n\nAnd that's exactly how I feel. I'll take the stairs. I'll suffer with a curtainless, hand-held shower head. I'll live with paper thin walls. Whatever it takes, it doesn't matter in the long run.\n\nI get to \"live\" in the city of my dreams.\n\nThe same city where Napoleon and Josephine probably endured\n\ntoo many stairs and very little hot water.\n\nThe same city where Josephine Baker, Jim Morrison and Ernest Hemingway\n\nmay have encountered a tiny bathroom or two.\n\nWho cares?\n\nIt's still Paris, the same city where Audrey Hepburn once remarked,\n\n\"Paris is always a good idea.\"\n\nMore advice from Ms. Hepburn (as Sabrina):\n\n\"More isn't always better, Linus. Sometimes it's just more.\"\n\nShe gets it. Accommodations are just part of the trip. The magic is outside your door.\n\nWelcome to Paris.\n\nWanted: Hotel with Good View from the Toilet\n\nBrigitte Bardot\n\nElizabeth Taylor\n\nAudrey Hepburn Knew How to Get Around Paris!\n\nView of Pompidou Center from Paris Apartment is Extraordinary! Front and Center of the Action!"
