William Shaw Jr. served with Loyalists during the American Revolution.\n\nWilliam Shaw Jr. was born ca. 1756 on the New York frontier, at the beginning of the French and Indian War, also known as the Seven Years' War (1754 - 1763), which pitted the British Colonies of New England against the French soldiers living in Canada and New France.\n\nWilliam was the son of William Shaw Sr., a young soldier in His Majesty's 42nd Regiment of Foot (\"The Black Watch\") and Jane (Wood) Shaw, the daughter of Thomas Wood.\n\nWilliam and Jane had married in Ireland the previous year. Then they had crossed the Atlantic ocean together. William Jr. was their first child, and he was born near a crude British military encampment in New York: a rough beginning for a child with a good pedigree.\n\nWilliam Shaw Sr., born 1735 in County Wexford, Ireland, stemmed from the Shaws of Kilkenny, descendants of the Shaws of Greenock and Shaws of Sauchie. His family lived in a castle on the coast of Antrim, and they were relatives to the Shaw-Stewart Barons of Nova Scotia. Though he didn't know it, William was also an ancestor to the Irish playwright, George Bernard Shaw (who descends from William's half-brother, Bernard Shaw).\n\nWhile Jane and little William stayed in New York, William Shaw Sr. served valiantly throughout the French and Indian War and rose to the rank of Major. He reportedly fought at the Siege of Guadalupe and was present at one of the most extraordinary victories in military history: The Fall of Montreal in 1760.\n\nMany of the British soldiers who fought in the \"Seven Years War\" (1754 - 1763) were rewarded later with land grants in Canada and New York. Maj. William Shaw and Jane Wood settled at Granville, Nova Scotia, where William became the Sheriff of Halifax ca. 1765. Their names also appear on several land grants recorded at Orange County, New York in the late 1750s.\n\nAccording to A History of Orange County (New York), cited below, Maj. William Shaw Sr. was entrusted with distribution of local land grants, which indicates the British gave him considerable trust and authority.\n\nIn 1767 Maj. William Shaw (1735 - 1813) returned with the 42nd Foot to County Cork, Ireland, where the regiment stayed for several years before returning to America in 1772.\n\nWilliam Shaw Jr. grew up in County Cork with three brothers. They probably lived near the Shaw family's lands at Monkton Castle and Ballyduff House. They were educated at the local church schools, and brought up strictly in the Presbyterian faith.\n\nJunior had reached the age of 16 when his father's unit finally sailed back to America to participate in the great and dangerous military operations that led up to the American Revolution.\n\nBetween 1772 and the beginning of the war, the Shaw family seem to have lived on their old bounty lands near Mount Hope, in Orange County, New York.\n\nBy the year 1775 William Shaw Jr. had reached the age of 20, and he himself certainly participated in the American Revolution as a Loyalist officer, serving with Sir John Johnson's Royal Regiment of New York, which was raised from local militia in Tryon and Orange counties.\n\nWilliam Shaw Jr. chose John Johnson's regiment because his father, William Sr., had served with Sir William Johnson at the siege of Ft. Niagara during the Seven Years' War. The son was clearly following the father's advice when he chose Johnson's unit. They were crack shots and some of the best frontier rangers in the field.\n\nIn 1777, on the eve of his first battle, William Jr. married to a local woman, Maritje (\"Mary Jane\") Waldron, the daughter of John Waldron (of County Kilkenny, Ireland) and Wijntie Terhuyn, the descendant of an Old Dutch family from Bergen County, New Jersey.\n\nWilliam Junior's wife Mary Waldron does not appear on the Irish records for this period, but she very clearly appears on Old Dutch church baptism records for Bergen County, New Jersey in 1756 and for Haarlem, New York (which used to be a Dutch neighborhood) during the 1770s. She probably lived at her father's house in Haarlem or the Shaw family house in Mt. Hope, Orange County during the war.\n\nSome Ontario family histories call Mary Jane \"Lady Mary Waldron\" and claim that the couple first met while living in Ireland. Mary was supposedly the daughter of a nobleman and William's childhood sweetheart, at a time when William was simply the \"baker boy\" in the castle bakery.\n\nThey were forbidden to marry, but Mary Jane's father had changed his mind after they were stationed together in New York as fellow warriors.\n\nWilliam Shaw had grown into a fine young man.\n\nWilliam Shaw Jr. began the American Revolution as a corporal but rose steadily in the ranks, taking on greater and greater responsibilities as he became more experienced in battle. By the end of the war, he had reached the rank of Captain. He may be identical with the Capt. William Shaw on the muster rolls of the 42nd Foot, which suggests that he transferred to his father's old Highland unit, the Black Watch.\n\nAs everyone who has read American history knows, the Revolution ended badly for the British. After 1783, many Loyalist families were exiled to Canada and expelled from their lands. But strangely the Shaw family managed to hold onto their land in Orange County.\n\nAs editor Russel Headly tells us in his book The History of Orange County New York (Middletown, N.Y.: Van Deusen and Elms, Publishers, 1908):\n\n\"The Shaw family was among the early settlers in the northeastern part of the town [of Mount Hope], and until within a few years the original tract of land settled upon them was in the name of some of the family.\n\n\"About 1750 William Shaw [Senior] moved to the town and was agent for a large tract of land owned by New York parties, with instructions to take what he wanted, sell what he could and give some away. The descendants of some of his friends to whom he gave farms are [still] living in Orange County.\"\n\nIn other words the Shaw family and their friends (the Waldron family) remained at Mount Hope, New York throughout the war, and despite their loyalist sympathies they somehow managed to hold onto their property. They were respected, well-liked and (perhaps for the simple reason that William Sr. had generously granted large tracts of lands to half the farmers surrounding them) they were not uprooted by their patriot neighbors. They continued to own a house and farmland around Mt. Hope, New York, well into the 19th century (Headly wrote their biographies ca. 1880).\n\nYet, as loyalist soldiers, Capt. William Shaw Jr. and his father were very definitely expelled from the United States for at least 10 years. They emigrated to Canada after 1783. Canadian records indicate William Shaw Sr. moved back to his lands at Annapolis in Nova Scotia during the mid-1780s.\n\nMary (Waldron) Shaw's own migration to Canada seems to have taken place sometime after 1784. Because the records of Maj. William Sr. resemble those of Capt. William Jr., and because the two wives had similar maiden names (Jane Wood and Mary Jane Waldron) there is definitely some confusion among the Shaw family records in Nova Scotia, which require careful sorting.\n\nIndeed the Shaw family as a Clan were part of what is known as the Shaw-Stewart Baronets. They were one branch out of dozens of Shaw families who had participated in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia between 1625 and 1706. To say that there were many landed Shaws in Nova Scota would be an understatement.\n\nLocating Mary and her children in this tangle of records during a war-jumbled time when women seldom appeared on the written records is difficult. The difficulty is further complicated by the movements of the British Army.\n\nAround 1785, both Maj. William Shaw Sr. and Capt. William Shaw Jr. were sent back to Ireland, on direct orders of William's commander, Gen. Eyre Massey. As Scotch-Irishmen, with dozens of disloyal family members in New York who had enthusiastically participated in the American Revolution, they were not exactly well-liked or fully trusted by their British commanders. Indeed, William Shaw Sr. had been nearly court-martialed on charges of embezzlement, charges which he hotly denied.\n\nBy stepping in and sending them with the 42nd Foot back to Ireland, Gen. Massey had actually done them a great favor. But they were not out of the woods yet: they remained out of favor with the British high command.\n\nWhen they arrived back in Ireland, the Shaws were de-mobbed, given no new military assignments, and cut loose without pay or rations. Their women probably followed them back to County Cork, and they faced a very grim future of uncertainty and financial hardship.\n\nThe timeline for the Shaw family in the late 1780s and early 1790s is not entirely clear, but one may guess how they felt. They had just lost a war, they had been cut off from their allied families and lands in New York and Canada, the Shaw family in Kilkenny were not exactly thrilled to find the British Army camped on their doorstep again, and the Irishmen who had fought so bravely and so hard for King and country now had no pay, no rations and no way to find work. They were going broke.\n\nWhy had they come back? To oppress their own people! Irish unrest had begun to disturb the King of England, and he had brought back the Loyalist troops to \"keep order.\"\n\nThe cities of Belfast and northern Ireland were overcrowded and depressed slums. There were no jobs. The Irish people were broken, ragged and starving. Even with the pay of a commissioned officer, one could barely make ends meet. Meanwhile, the battle-tested soldiers of the 42nd Foot and the 27th Enniskillings couldn't shake the memory of all that beautiful, untouched farmland in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Ontario.\n\nWhy stay in Ireland? They were starving for an excuse to go back to America -- and to take their Irish friends and families with them. Maj. William Shaw Sr.'s letters from this period are filled with bitter bleatings. He was constantly pestering his commanders in London for land grants and a new military assignment, one that would take him back to Nova Scotia and Ontario.\n\nThe Shaws soon got their wish. British anxiety over the security of its Canadian border with the United States, and King George's grim realization that the restless young men of Ireland were grumbling about a revolution of their own (wanted him dead!) led the senior brass to conclude it might be best to send the King's loyal Irish troops back to Ontario pronto -- before they burned down Dublin.\n\nCol. John Graves Simcoe and many other Loyalist commanders were soon put in charge of building new communities along the Canadian border as a bulwark against incursion by the American army. British Army commanders began busily designing new forts, mapping new settlements and churning out land grants.\n\nThe Loyalist Shaws soon found that their ship had come in. They sailed back to Canada in 1788 with a new assignment: Defend the Canadian border.\n\nBy the early 1790s, Capt. William Shaw Jr. claimed bounty land near Kingston, Ontario, at exactly the same time that his father Maj. William Shaw (1735 - 1813) was claiming large tracts of land in the same region.\n\nIn fact Maj. William Shaw Sr. was one of the founders of the Cataraqui settlements, near Ft. Cataraqui (later called Ft. Frontenac). See the Wikipedia article on Kingston, Ontario for the historical background. His marriage to Jane Wood and the names of his family are very clearly documented, thanks to these records.\n\nCapt. William Shaw Jr.'s membership in the KRRNY (the King's Royal Regiment of New York) is also made very clear by the records at Kingston: These were bounty lands given to Loyalists troops for their service to the King of England during the American Revolution.\n\n\"Soon after he came from Ireland and had made a clearing,\" says Headly, \"he sent for his intended wife (Mary Waldron). She came from New York [emphasis added] to New Windsor on a sloop and was met by him and taken to his home on horseback, for at that time it was the only way he could travel between the two points.\"\n\nNew York? What was Mary Jane doing in New York?\n\nBy referring to Mary Waldron as his \"intended\" this passage clearly implies that they were not married yet, or that Mary was living with her father's family in New York. But their 1777 marriage record is clear, and there are equally clear records indicating that when Capt. William Shaw Jr. transferred with his regiment back to Ireland after the war, Mary Waldron went with him. Indeed at least one of their children, William Shaw III, seems to have been born in County Wexford, Ireland, in 1786.\n\nYet the local history for Orange County, New York definitely indicates William and his bride Mary Waldron returned to Mount Hope, Orange County, New York around 1790 and had more children there.\n\nThe family legends recorded in Ontario, Canada also indicate that Capt. William Shaw Jr. brought his \"Irish\" bride \"Lady Mary Waldron\" from New York to Canada ca. 1792, to join his family near Kingston.\n\nBoth legends agree: The Shaws seem to have lived in New York between 1790 and 1792. They held land in Ireland, New York and Canada, living in all three countries simultaneously.\n\nThe legends also refer to Capt. William Shaw Jr.'s son, William Shaw III, who was born in County Wexford and may have married to a Waldron cousin there. The Irish census records show two women named Mary Waldron born at County Wexford, Ireland, in 1792 and 1795 respectively. One of them supposedly arrived in Ontario, like a mail order bride, to marry to William Shaw III, but she died in 1819.\n\nThis was truly an international family, one very used to hopping back and forth across the pond. Although they had fought as Loyalists, they were not very bashful about returning immediately to New York.\n\nHow could the Shaws be so certain that they would be welcomed back in New York by their friends and family? Simple: They were turncoats.\n\nThe Shaws were traditionally Jacobites and Scottish Rite Masons -- members of secret societies that believed strongly in destroying the Hanoverian kings of England and replacing them with Stewart Kings\n\nDuring that short, bitter period between 1785 and 1790, when they had been beaten by the Americans and dumped by the British Army without pay, many of the Scotch-Irish Loyalists began to complain bitterly that they had been fighting on the wrong side. They had been fools to fight for the British. They should have joined their clever Jacobite cousins in America, who had fought so hard against King George -- and who now had their freedom.\n\nIndeed many of the bitter idealists of Belfast, ireland soon changed their tune during the 1790s, as Ireland's economy sank into new depths of misery and despair. Irish youth began joining secret societies like the United Irishmen, and they adopted Thomas Paine's book \"The Rights of Man\" as their new Bible. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson became their new heroes.\n\nThink of how quickly the Beatles invaded American culture in 1964, during the musical revolution known as the \"British Invasion,\" and you will have some idea how quickly American culture invaded Ireland in 1784.\n\nAfter four years of bloody war, the youth of Ireland became radicalized and transformed. Thomas Jefferson became their new rock star, and it was no secret to the Americans that the Irish now adored them.\n\nIn the summer of 1798 the Irish tried desperately to launch their own \"American Revolution.\" Huge, huge crowds mounted rowdy protests on the streets of every major city in Ireland. The Irish people denounced the British King, and started a very loud and violent uprising against British rule, armed in part by shipments of guns and ammunition from their American cousins.\n\nThe British responded swiftly and brutally. They immediately fielded troops, who opened fire on unarmed crowds and cut the large mobs of Irish protestors to ribbons. The idealists quickly broke and ran. Their headquarters were overrun, smashed and shut down. Hundreds of men were hung in the streets, without trial. Those Irish conspirators who weren't hung were shot, beheaded or immediately banished.\n\nMany of the wealthy Irishmen lucky enough to be banished (including the Shaws) decided almost instantly to move to New York, where they enthusiastically embraced American citizenship.\n\nAfter 1798, the United Irishmen who had participated in the Battle of Antrim were certainly seen as traitors in the eyes of the British Army. But they were now seen as friends and compatriots by Irish Americans -- forgiven for past sins by their American cousins -- as Irish revolutionaries and patriots who had belatedly seen the light.\n\nMany of the Irish in America, having read the grim news of bloodshed in Dublin, were simply glad to see their cousins were still alive. They were greeted with cheers and tears, welcomed home as prodigal sons, with open arms.\n\nThe new mood in Irish-American relations and the Irish Rebellion of 1798 therefore put the Loyalist Shaws of Mt. Hope, New York, into an odd and awkward new position. They were \"disloyal Loyalists\" -- a queer lot who had \"repented\" of their past loyalty to Britain.\n\nTo whom were they truly loyal now? They had obviously betrayed their country by siding with the British. But was Loyalty to one's king really such a sin?\n\nTo their surprise, they were not entirely shunned by their American neighbors and cousins when they returned to New York in the 1790s. But as former enemies (and some of the best fighters the British had!) they were not entirely loved or trusted either. They were always watched closely and kept at arm's distance.\n\nIt is possible that the Shaws, in order to prove their loyalty to the United States, began during this period, prior to the War of 1812, to provide useful military intelligence to their Scots-Irish cousins in New York. They may have begun to write letters containing vital news regarding troop movements and ship departures, knowing full well that it might be passed along to American military commanders.\n\nThis would explain why the Powers That Be grudgingly allowed the Shaws of Mt. Hope to keep their land in New York, and why the Shaws were now suddenly distrusted and treated like green cheese by their own British commanders.\n\nThey were playing a dangerous double game.\n\nAs former Loyalists, Maj. William Shaw Sr. and Capt. William Shaw Jr. would never be fully forgiven or trusted by the United States military again, yet as Irish militia they would never be fully respected or trusted by the military professionals in the English Army, either.\n\nIndeed, after 1798, the Shaws who had supported the United Irishmen were despised by the British General staff, and even those Irish Shaws who continued to protest their Loyalty and devotion to King George were viewed through narrowed eyes of suspicion.\n\nThe best the Loyalist Shaws could do, in 1790, was to keep their mouths shut, keep their heads low, and settle into a quiet sort of no-man's land on the border between New York and Canada.\n\nIt was a dodgy existence.\n\nThis helps to explain why they became what one might call \"Silent Shaws\" or \"Invisible Shaws\" -- quiet men who became shy and modest farmers. They set the war aside and simply put all that remained of their love and their hearts and their bodily strength into raising good families, being good citizens, caring for their land, and serving their neighbors.\n\nWhen asked, they strongly preferred not to discuss their family history.\n\nAs Scotch-Irish Shaws living in New York and Ontario, to which country were the family of William Shaw Jr. truly loyal? Official answer: No answer.\n\nFrom the paper trail, however, one thing becomes abundantly clear: These Irish Loyalists dearly loved their bounty land. They were land-hungry and land-starved Irish. Like kids in a candy shop, they amassed as much farm land as they could possibly grab up in Ontario, holding onto it with a Python-like death-grip for more than a century.\n\nIn the end, all that mattered to them was their family and their land. They may have given up on their country's government (more than once!) but they never gave up on their family or gave up their land.\n\nOne may also deduce a few other interesting tidbits from their paper trail. It was Capt. William Shaw Jr. (1755 - 1822), not Maj. William Shaw Sr., who married ca. 1777 to Mary Waldron Shaw (1759 - 1819) and brought her (back) to America in 1790. They temporarily settled in Kingston, Ontario from 1792 to 1817, and they quickly moved back to Mt. Hope, New York after the War of 1812.\n\nThis must be emphasized, because Capt. William Shaw Jr. has a contradictory Find A Grave page (cited below) which gives no photo of the headstone and which gives the wrong year of birth. It wrongly suggests that Mary Waldron married to Maj. William Shaw Sr. (1735 - 1813), who is actually buried in Kingston, Ontario, beside his wife Jane (Wood) Shaw.\n\nOstensibly the Shaws of Kingston, Ontario fought for the British Army and served the British Crown during the War of 1812. But there is no doubt about this: They remained on a friendly footing with their relatives in New York.\n\nTheir Find A Grave memorials show them buried next to their kin at Hopewell Cemetery in New York, and William Shaw's 1823 probate records also indicate very clearly that he died in Orange County, New York, not Ontario.\n\nFor all of the propaganda surrounding the wars with Britain, Christian charity and the love of family finally won out. The past, if not forgotten, was quietly forgiven.\n\nCapt. William Shaw Jr. and Mary Waldron Shaw had several children, and they are listed clearly and correctly in Edward M. Rutenber's History of Orange County New York (1881) on p. 169, as part of the biography for Robert M. Shaw, M.D., one of the sons of William Jr.\n\n\"The Shaw family are of Scotch-Irish extraction, having at an early period settled in the north of Ireland, from whence a branch emigrated to America about the year 1750. Among this number was William, who chose a residence in Orange County, purchasing land in Mount Hope township, which is still in possession of the family.\n\n\"He was united [ca. 1777] in marriage to Miss Mary Waldron, of New York, and was the father of the following children :\n\nJohn,\n\nRobert (1780 - 1848)\n\nSamuel,\n\nRev. Henry,\n\nAlexander,\n\nWilliam, the Third,\n\nJames,\n\nCharles,\n\nElizabeth, and\n\nMary.\n\n\"The death of William Shaw [Junior] occurred in 1822. The simplicity, integrity, and purity which governed his life are best illustrated by embodying in this sketch the following letter left by him on his death :\n\n\" This is to be read to my children when I am laid in the grave. My dear children, as God in his mercy has given you all the natural faculties and powers that are natural to man, I hope you will daily return thanks for the same, and that you will make the Scriptures your rule of life, and seek and serve God in the way and man- ner that he will approve and bless. As your mother has nursed you with the greatest tenderness, endeavor to give her a suitable return by honoring her person, and receiving her counsels and providing for her wants while God continues her in time. I hope you will love and cherish one another, not taking the least advantage, and if misfortune should befall any of you I hope the rest will, not only with your counsel, but with your property, assist your unfortunate brother or sister. Be just in all your dealings with mankind ; be content with your own, be it little or much, for it 'is not the quantity that makes men happy, but being content with your condition.\n\nSigned with my hand this third day of June, one thousand eight hundred and six.\"— William Shaw.\n\nHeadly says (in 1881) that many descendants of Capt. William Shaw Jr.'s family were were still living in the vicinity of Mt. Hope, New York, among them being:\n\nWilliam Shaw the 3rd, who married (firstly) Rachel Schoonoven and (secondly) Mary W. [Wood] Shaw, and who \"inherited the homestead and died there.\" Two of William the 3rd's sons, Aaron and Howard, \"became quite distinguished. The former was state attorney, judge of the Supreme Court and twice elected to Congress in Illinois. The latter (Howard), who married Abby M. Tryon, was a noted auctioneer;\" and\n\nWickham T. Shaw, \"a great grandson, practicing law at Middletown, N. Y., who married Clara A. Mapes, is the last male descendant in that line living. He has three sons, Howard, Charles and H. James Aaron, and one daughter, Florence.\"\n\nSources\n\nOnline Family Tree\n\nWilliam Shaw (1750 - 1822) Facts Page, Thomas Family Tree, Ancestry.com\n\nBiography of the Shaw Family, Orange County, NY Biographies, OnlineBiographies website (Retreived 18 March 2017) citing Headley (below)\n\nHeadley, Russel, ed.

Cook)\n\nResidents near Lansdowne Tell Story of Shaw family, Early Settlers in Ontario William Shaw, Baker in Household of Irish Lord, Fell in Love And Eloped with Lady Mary, Only Daughter of the House - Couple set Out for Canada in 1792.\n\nLansdowne, Ont., Nov. 11, 1940\n\n\"Has any person ever told you about the romance of William Shaw and his settling on Hogs Back Hill just below Lansdowne Turn?\".\n\nI had stopped on the King's Highway, No.2, for information about certain pioneer families of that region when the people of that household asked the question and indicated that there was an interesting story connected with the pioneer Shaw family. Here is the story as it was told to me:\n\n\"William Shaw was born in the county of Armagh, Ireland, in the year 1767, his parents being of the fanner class. When a youth in his teens he was put to work in the home of a rich gentleman, a man of the nobility class with a large estate. William was put to work in the bakery of the castle and in time became quite an expert baker and was a great favorite in the household . A laughing, happy, ready-to-do-Iad, he even attracted the attention of Lady Mary, beautiful and only Daughter of the house\".\n\n\"In time the servants noticed that Lady Mary was seeking the company of William and that he seemed to think much of Lady Mary. This was reported to Sir and Lady Waldron but they laughed it off, saying that no girl in the position of Lady Mary would permit herself to fall in love with a servant\".\n\n\" Lady Mary, however, did just that and eloped with the handsome William Shaw. Her parents we re shocked, and angered by the act. They at once disowned Lady Mary and cut her off from the family and the large estate which would have been hers had she remained in the home\" .\n\n\"This did not seem to affect the happiness of William Shaw and Lady Mary for they found a place to live and he was able by his backing to support her comfortably. Three children were born to them and as William and his young wife talked over the future they found themselves thinking more and more about Canada that seemed to have wealth for all and an equal opportunity. Stories coming from the New World told of land in and about a place called Kingston. So they decided to go there\".\n\n\"In the year 1792 they set sail after bidding goodbye to all their relatives and friends, but with never a kindly or helpful word from Lady Mary's parents. William said they would gain a home and wealth in Canada and he was ready to work good and hard to gain that end. It was a long, hard trip. The ship was slow, the waters rough and the little family of five often wondered at night .if they would ever see Iland. At last, after much hardship and toil, they started their trip up the St. Lawrence River\".\n\n\"And that was a long, hard trip, especially to get around rapids of the river and start out anew from the Prescott port. But they knew they were now near their destination and William was happy in the fact that he would soon be able to start his home on his own land. But there was one sad note, - Lady Mary was ill. The ship doctor pronounced it a fever and probably a weakness caused by the long trip on ship. One morning the captain said that by night they would reach Kingston harbor, but Lady Mary reached the end of her trip just before Kingston was sighted. She died of the fever on board the ship within but a few hours of the goal\".\n\n\"William was heart-broken and the Captain, a kindly soul, brought the ship about and dropped anchor just off Amherst Island and on that island a grave was dug and Mary was buried. There was nothing left or William to do but to take his family to Kingston and there he sought a place to lodge them while he looked about for land. On the Hogs back, near Lansdowne, he picked his farm and there over 130 years ago he built a stone house. He prospered, and died an old man there. He is buried in Lansdowne cemetery, which is on the present King's Highway No.2\".\n\n\"And the descendants of William Shaw are many and prominent\", continued the party telling the story. \"But you will want to see the house, still standing on the Hogs back Hill, and learn about the gold that was buried there and how the descendants, many of them, made their homes in this area\".\n\nThe Shaw Family of Hogsback Hill Farm Escott\n\n\"In this issue we are featuring Hogsback Hill Farm in Escott Township where Confederate gold was thought to be buried. In the early days this farm was owned by William Shaw [Jr.] and his descendants. William Shaw [Jr.] was born about 1786 in the Diocese of Ossary Co. Kilkenny Ireland. He married about 1811 Mary Waldron [Mary Ann Woods] who was also born in Ossary about 1790.\n\n\"There is no proof that she came from a titled family as tradition suggests. The Shaws of Kilkenny all seem to be related and connected to the estate given to William Shaw following the Battle of the Boyne in 1689. George Bernard Shaw's grandfather was born on this estate. At some point William [Sr.] and Mary [Waldron] moved to Wexford as their three children were born there. They came to Canada in 1820. Mary became ill and died while travelling up the St. Lawrence. The ship captain put in at Amherst Island where she was buried. William and the children found their way to Escott where the family appears on the census of 1821. He purchased the farm known as Hogs Hill Farm. He married Elizabeth Acton the widow of Joseph Acton. She died Aug. 6, 1845 and is buried in Lansdowne Cemetery. He married a third time to Mary Ann surname unknown. William died between 1861 and 1871.\"\n\nJuly 1776: Attached to Sir John Johnson's Royal Regiment of New York\n\nDuring the summer of 1776, Shaw apparently travelled to Tryon County, New York, to help Sir John Johnson raise Loyalist militia there. A man named William Shaw was enlisted as an officer in Sir John Johnson's regiment.\n\n\"William Shaw (A013/81/381) served in Sir John Johnson's Second Battalion. Was residing at the Bay of Quinte after the peace. Shaw estimated his loss at 48 pounds New York.\"\n\nSource: Palmer, Gregory. Biographical Sketches of Loyalists of the American Revolution (London: Meckler Publishing, 1985) p. 778\n\nNote: William Shaw's military unit (\"Sir John Johnson's Second Battalion\") is described briefly in Philip R.N. Katcher's Encyclopedia of British, Provincial, and Germany Army Unites, 1775 - 1783 (Stackpole Books) p. 88 as follows:\n\n\"John Johnson's Royal Greens (Johnson's Royal Regiment of New York, King's Royal Regiment of New York).

Detachments served at siege of Fort Stanwix, August 1777, and siege of Fort Schuler, 1777. A second battalion created 1780. Disbanded in Canada June, 1784. Strength: 1,290.

William marries Mary Waldron of New York\n\nFrom History of Orange County New York (1881) by Edward M. Rutenber et al., p. 169:\n\nRobert Shaw M.D.\n\n\"The Shaw family are of Scotch-Irish extraction, having at an early period settled in the north of Ireland, from whence a branch emigrated to America about the year 1750. Among this number was William, who chose a residence in Orange County, purchasing land in Mount Hope township, which is still in possession of the family.\n\n\"He was united [ca. 1777] in marriage to Miss Mary Waldron, of New York, and was the father of the following children :\n\nJohn,\n\nRobert (1780 - 1848)\n\nSamuel,\n\nRev.

Her mother, who was Presbyterian, died in 1829, and after that, she joined the M.E. church. In 1852, Margaret moved to Kingston to live with her brother-in-law, Rev. B. Atkinson. She died in Kingston in Nov., 1861.\" -- November 12, 1862, p. 4, O. [Death Notices of Ontario].\n\n\"SHAW, REV. D.M. was born near the Bay of Quinte, Aug. 24, 1817, and was admitted on trial to the Niagara Conference in 1850. Among the circuits he served were Orono, Newmarket, and Malanchthon. He died in Gosfield Twp., Oct. 16, 1868; predeceased by his first wife and 3 children; survived by his second wife and 7 children.\" -- Feb. 3, 1869, p. 4, O. [Death Notices of Ontario].\n\n\"SHAW, WILLIAM, father of Rev. W.H. Shaw of Palermo, died in Kingston, Jan. 25, 1872; age c. 75 [born ca. 1797].\" -- January 31, 1872, p. 3, D.N. [Source: McKenzie, cited below, p. 284]\n\nSHAW, THOMAS. \"17 Dec. 1845 (Wed.): On Friday afternoon last [Dec. 12], Thomas Shaw, a resident of Amherst Island, was drowned from on board the schooner Sydenham while on her way from the Island to Kingston. He leaves a wife and 10 children.\" Kingston Chronicle. [Source: Reid, cited below, p. 159].\n\nFrom these four death notices we may infer the following: William Shaw's wife was named Jane or Mary Jane, they had three daughters (one of whom was named Margaret), a son named William and a son named Thomas. William became the father of Rev. W.H. Shaw of Palermo. Thomas married and fathered 10 children.\n\nThe remainder may be deduced fairly easily from New York census records and Ontario census records for Frontenac county.\n\n1788: Award of Land Grants in Upper Canada (Ontario)\n\nWikipedia tells us that in 1784 \"Sir John Johnson was . . . appointed as Superintendent General and Inspector General of Indian affairs of First Nations in Canada, including the four Iroquois nations that had relocated there. After the war, he was appointed by the Crown to distribute lands in Upper Canada to exiled Loyalists, and estimated he helped resettle nearly 3800 in 1784.\"\n\nNaturally, he distributed land grants to the men of his Second Battalion, and one of the grant recipients was William Shaw.\n\n1788 Settlement at Fredericksburgh and Kingston\n\nAround 1788 William Shaw settled with other loyalists and disbanded troops on the north shore of the Bay of Quinte, A map of the Bay of Quinte and these settlements -- the \"Cataraqui Townships\" -- may be found in Mika, cited below, on page 173.\n\nThe Cataraqui settlements were named after Fort Cataraqui, which was later renamed Fort Frontenac (see the Wikipedia article cited below). The settlements were centered on the fort and the land that later became Kingston, Ontario. They were basically rectangular blocks of land set side-by-side and named:\n\nSidney\n\nAmeliasburg\n\nSophiasburg\n\nMarysburg\n\nAdolphus town\n\nFredericksburg\n\nEarnest Town, and\n\nKing's Town (later \"Kingston\").\n\nWilliam Shaw and his family lived first in Fredericksburgh and later in Kingston.\n\nAccording to Mika, Fredericksburgh \"was named in 1788 after Frederick, the Duke of Sussex, the ninth child of King George III. The first survey of this township was made in 1783. The original settlers of the township were Loyalists of Sir John Johnson's King's Royal Regiment of New York, and Major Robert Rogers' company, consisting of 539 settlers.\"\n\nMika provides a list of these settlers, which includes the name \"W. Shaw.\" This identity is confirmed as \"Wm. Shaw\" by a copy of the \"U.E. List\" -- an early record of Loyalist settlers preserved by the Crown lands Department of Toronto and republished in 1885 as Appendix B of The Centennial of the Settlement of Upper Canada by the United Empire Loyalists, 1784 - 1884.\n\nAt page 251 we find the listing:\n\n\"Shaw, Wm. . . . . Fredericksburgh . . . . A Corpl. R.R.N.Y., [Royal Regiment of New York], Stamped Book, O.C. 8th July, 1797, P.L. 1786, A. McL.\"\n\nAbove his name is that of another William Shaw:\n\n\"Shaw, Wm., Esq. . . . . W. Dist. . . . . 1 gt. 400, Sergeant 5th Regt.\"\n\nRelatives in Orange County, New York\n\nFrom: The History of Orange County New York Edited by: Russel Headley Van Deusen and Elms, Publishers Middletown, N. Y. 1908\n\n\"THE SHAW FAMILY. - The Shaw family was among the early settlers in the northeastern part of the town, and until within a few years the original tract of land settled upon them was in the name of some of the family.\n\n\"About 1750 William Shaw moved to the town and was agent for a large tract of land owned by New York parties, with instructions to take what he wanted, sell what he could and give some away. The descendants of some of his friends to whom he gave farms are living in Orange County.\n\n\"Soon after he came from Ireland [ca. 1790] and had made a clearing, he sent for his intended wife (Mary Waldron). She came from New York to New Windsor on a sloop and was met by him and taken to his home on horseback, for at that time it was the only way he could travel between the two points.\n\n\"They had children and many of their descendants are still in that vicinity, among them being\n\nWickham T. Shaw, a great grandson, practicing law at Middletown, N. Y.\n\nWilliam Shaw, who married Rachel Schoonoven, son of William and Mary W. Shaw, inherited the homestead and died there. Two of his [William Jr.'s] sons, Aaron and Howard, became quite distinguished. The former was state attorney, judge of the Supreme Court and twice elected to Congress in Illinois. The latter (Howard), who married Abby M. Tryon, was a noted auctioneer, and\n\nWickham T. Shaw, his son, who married Clara A. Mapes, is the last male descendant in that line living. He has three sons, Howard, Charles and H. James Aaron, and one daughter, Florence.\"\n\nThe following sketch of William Shaw's son, Robert Shaw, M.D., who lived in Orange County, New York, clearly mentions William Shaw and Mary Waldron. It also provides some additional details and a list of children:\n\nFrom History of Orange County New York (1881) by Edward M. Rutenber et al., p. 169:\n\nRobert Shaw M.D.\n\n\"The Shaw family are of Scotch-Irish extraction, having at an early period settled in the north of Ireland, from whence a branch emigrated to America about the year 1750. Among this number was William, who chose a residence in Orange County, purchasing land in Mount Hope township, which is still in possession of the family.\n\nHe was united [ca. 1777] in marriage to Miss Mary Waldron, of New York, and was the father of the following children :\n\nJohn [ca. 1779]\n\nRobert [1780 - 1848]\n\nSamuel [ca. 1781]\n\nRev.

The simplicity, integrity, and purity which governed his life are best illustrated by embodying in this sketch the following letter left by him on his death :\n\n'This is to be read to my children when I am laid in the grave. My dear children, as God in his mercy has given you all the natural faculties and powers that are natural to man, I hope you will daily return thanks for the same, and that you will make the Scriptures your rule of life, and seek and serve God in the way and man- ner that he will approve and bless. As your mother has nursed you with the greatest tenderness, endeavor to give her a suitable return by honoring her person, and receiving her counsels and providing for her wants while God continues her in time. I hope you will love and cherish one another, not taking the least advantage, and if misfortune should befall any of you I hope the rest will, not only with your counsel, but with your property, assist your unfortunate brother or sister. Be just in all your dealings with mankind ; be content with your own, be it little or much, for it 'is not the quantity that makes men happy, but being content with your condition.\n\nSigned with my hand this third day of June, one thousand eight hundred and six.'— William Shaw.\n\nCanada Find A Grave Index\n\nCapt William Shaw in the Canada, Find A Grave Index, 1600s-Current\n\nGo to website: Find A Grave: Memorial #41973931\n\nName: Capt William Shaw\n\nBirth Date: 1751\n\nDeath Date: 1822\n\nDeath Place: Canada\n\nCemetery: Shawbank Cemetery\n\nBurial or Cremation Place: Kent Bridge, Chatham-Kent Municipality, Ontario, Canada\n\nHas Bio?: N\n\nSource Information\n\nAncestry.com.
