        "text": "Born in 1856 at 33 Synge Street, George Bernard Shaw stands as one of Ireland's most revered literary figures, emblematic of a golden era in Irish writing. While the plaque outside his birthplace modestly labels him as the \"author of many plays\", Shaw's impact on world literature is far-reaching, earning him a Nobel Prize for Literature during his lifetime.\n\nDespite his later acclaim, Shaw's beginnings were humble, reflected in the unassuming Victorian home where he spent his early years.
