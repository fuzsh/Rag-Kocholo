In Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, distinguished Yale historian Henry Ashby Turner makes an important and influential addition to his life-long study of Nazi Germany. Providing vivid portraits of the main players of the drama of January 1933, and using newly available documents, Turner masterfully recreates the bewildering circumstances surrounding Hitler's unexpected appointment as chancellor of Germany. The result is a work that Booklist calls "first rate ... a gripping, foreboding narrative."

Henry Ashby Turner, Jr., is Stille Professor of History at Yale University. He is the author of the definitive German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler and Germany from Partition to Reunification, among other books. He lives in Branford, Connecticut.
