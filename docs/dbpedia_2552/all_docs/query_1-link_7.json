But the expedition went horribly wrong: Delayed by a hurricane, knocked off course by a colossal error of navigation, and ultimately doomed by a disastrous decision to separate the men from their ships, the mission quickly became a desperate journey of survival. Of the 300 men who had embarked on the journey, only four survived - three Spaniards and an African slave.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nA worthwhile listen\n\nBy Blake on 07-10-13\n\nAllow Me to Retort\n\nA Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution\n\nBy: Elie Mystal\n\nNarrated by: Elie Mystal\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 59 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 2,196\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,950\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 1,930\n\nThis is an easily digestible argument about what rights we have, what rights Republicans are trying to take away, and how to stop them. Mystal explains how to protect the rights of women and people of color instead of cowering to the absolutism of gun owners and bigots. He explains the legal way to stop everything from police brutality to political gerrymandering, just by changing a few judges and justices. He strips out all of the fancy jargon conservatives like to hide behind and lays bare the truth of their project to keep America forever tethered to its slaveholding past.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nInformative and Entertaining\n\nBy Kindle Customer on 03-06-22\n\n1177 B.C.\n\nThe Year Civilization Collapsed\n\nBy: Eric H.

The pharaoh’s army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nWanted to Like...

Eerie aspects of the incident—unexplained violent injuries, signs that they cut open and fled the tent without proper clothing or shoes, a strange final photograph taken by one of the hikers, and elevated levels of radiation found on some of their clothes—have led to decades of speculation over what really happened.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nMystery & Intrigue In The Ural Mountains\n\nBy Sara on 06-30-15\n\nHelter Skelter\n\nThe True Story of the Manson Murders\n\nBy: Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry\n\nNarrated by: Scott Brick\n\nLength: 26 hrs and 29 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 9,951\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 8,806\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 8,791\n\nProsecuting attorney in the Manson trial Vincent Bugliosi held a unique insider's position in one of the most baffling and horrifying cases of the 20th century: the cold-blooded Tate-LaBianca murders carried out by Charles Manson and four of his followers.
