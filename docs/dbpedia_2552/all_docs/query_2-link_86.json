To the astonishment of most con¬ temporary observers, an obscure movement hostile to many basic aspects of modern civilization suddenly gained the support of millions and succeeded in capturing control of one of the world’s most advanced nations. Once in power, it stamped out all vestiges of political freedom and civil equality, reducing Jewish Germans to an outcast status and imposing a remorseless totalitarian dictatorship on all those under its authority. After a series of reckless but successful diplomatic moves that undermined the equilibrium of forces established after the First World War, the foreign policy of the Nazi government plunged Europe into the second great military carnage in a quarter-century. In the course of that six-year conflict, the leaders of the Third Reich defiantly flouted internationally agreed-upon rules of warfare and embarked upon the most horrendous campaign of genocide in recorded history, systemati¬ cally slaughtering millions of Jews. The Third Reich perished in the military debacle of 1945, but it be¬ queathed to survivors and subsequent generations a bitter heritage. It left behind it millions of shattered and disrupted lives, vast residues of hatred and mistrust, and a devastated and divided Europe, caught in the grip of a stultifying and anxiety-ridden cold war. Today the impact of Nazism and the Third Reich is still felt in countless ways, but their deepest and most lasting effects may well derive from the staggering\n\n3\n\n4\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nblow they delivered to the once widespread confidence that western civilization represented an impregnable barrier to the forces of barbar¬ ism and bestiality. Since Auschwitz, the world has seemed a different place. Nazism and the Third Reich have been of compelling interest for historians and social scientists. Concerned about the possible larger implications of Germany’s experience, scholars in other countries have joined with a new generation of Germans in an effort to establish the historical record of Nazism, identify its causes, ascertain its nature, and assess its meaning. This undertaking has been facilitated by the avail¬ ability of unprecedented amounts of documentary evidence. By virtue of the unconditional surrender of the Third Reich in 1945, for the only time in modern history vast quantities of the most recent state papers of a major nation were made available to scholars of all nations. Sup¬ plemented by the testimony and memoirs of survivors as well as much private and corporate documentation, this material has made it possible to examine in great detail not only the Third Reich but also the preced¬ ing period, during which Nazism was born and launched on the road to power. Despite the plethora of studies dealing with Nazism and the Third Reich, those phenomena in no sense belong to a closed chapter of his¬ tory. Instead, they remain the focus of a vigorous and ongoing body of international scholarship. Historians and social scientists have as yet far from plumbed the full depths of the sea of documentation they gen¬ erated. Many basic questions are still unclarified while others remain the subjects of lively controversy. Moreover, new discoveries and insights constantly give rise to fresh avenues of inquiry and analysis. Much re¬ search is under way, but even more remains still to be done in what has become one of the most active areas of modern historical scholarship. The selections in this volume have been gathered together in order to convey an impression of the variety and quality of recent scholarship on Nazism and the Third Reich. Most of them were published in learned journals, some in German, so that they would otherwise not be easily accessible to many interested readers. They are printed here com¬ plete with documentation, in part as a convenience to professional scholars but also as a means of acquainting interested students with the wealth of resources available for research on Nazism and the Third Reich. It is to be hoped that this volume will encourage still others to put their minds to the task of illuminating one of the most perplexing chapters in the recent experience of mankind.\n\n1 REGINALD H. PHELPS\n\nHitler and the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\n\nA major problem in the study of Nazism has been the obscurity of its origins. During the early years of its existence, the Nazi Party was merely one of several squabbling Bavarian right-wing extremist groups that carried on a precarious existence in seemingly hopeless isolation from the political mainstream of the new German republic created after the revolution of 1918. The party thus attracted little attention from the national press or from major political observers, leaving on the public record few traces of the sort that facilitate the task of the historian. The party’s leaders were men of obscure background, includ¬ ing Adolf Hitler himself. The son of a minor Austrian customs official, Hitler was born in 1889 and grew up in a succession of towns in west¬ ern Austria. Left fatherless at fourteen, he failed to complete a second¬ ary education and went at the age of eighteen to Vienna, where he unsuccessfully sought admission to the Art Academy. For the next seven years, he lived a shiftless existence, first in Vienna, then, after 1912, in Munich, dropping at times into abject poverty. Although still an Austrian citizen, he enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German army at the outbreak of the First World War. Serving throughout the conflict as a messenger on the front lines of the western front, he was wounded, decorated for valor, and promoted to corporal. At the time of the Armistice of November 11, 1918, he lay in a hospital bed in North Germany, recuperating from temporary blindness caused by gas at the front a month earlier.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nThis study takes up Hitler’s career at that point and examines the circumstances surrounding his fateful entry into politics. Utilizing a variety of evidence brought to light only since the fall of the Third Reich, the author exposes the misleading nature of the Nazi leaders own autobiographical version of his early political activities. This selec¬ tion originally appeared in the American Historical Review, LXVlll (1963), 974-986. It is reprinted by permission of the author, who is Associate Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. He has published numerous articles on Nazism.\n\nIt is not easy to squeeze out of that enormous sponge Mein Kampf a clear account of Hitler’s first association with the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei in Munich. He tells nothing of the party’s origins and little of the six months from his earliest contact with it in September 1919 until its first public triumph, his proclamation of its program in the Hofbrauhaus on February 24, 1920. To summarize his narrative:1 Coming from the hospital in Pasewalk, where his temporary blind¬ ing by gas had confined him, he reached Munich late in November 1918, joined a replacement battalion at Traunstein, and returned to Munich in March. He remained there under the short-lived Soviet re¬ publics set up in April and was assigned to an army \"investigating commission” shortly after the occupation of Munich by government troops early in May. He talked with comrades about founding a social revolutionary party. A lecture in an army citizenship course by Gott¬ fried Feder on the dangers of international capitalism impressed him deeply. His energetic response to a participant who defended the Jews, in a discussion in one of these courses, led to his appointment as a \"training officer” (Bildungsoffizier), and he found that he could \"speak” to a crowd.2 One day Hitler was ordered to report on a meeting of the obscure Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, which, like any possibly subversive organiza¬ tion, interested the Reichswehr. In a dismal tavern, the Sterneckerbrau, Hitler found twenty or twenty-five men, chiefly of the lower classes, listening to Feder repeat the address he had already heard that spring. \"My impression was neither good nor bad,” he writes. He would gladly have left after listening to Feder for two hours, but chanced to stay for the ensuing discussion and rose to smite verbally a separatist speaker. As he went out, a man rushed after him to thrust into his hand a small pamphlet. Lying awake the next morning in his barracks\n\nHITLER AND THE DEUTSCHE ARBEITERPARTEI\n\n7\n\nroom, he opened the pamphlet, Mein politisches Erwachen, and found that its author had experienced a change from internationalism to na¬ tionalism like that which he himself had undergone twelve years earlier in Vienna.3 Several days later he received a post card announcing that he was a member of the DAP and inviting him to its next committee meeting. In a back room of the Altes Rosenbad, ill-lit by a half-ruined gas lamp, he met the committee: four young men, shortly joined by the Reich chairman. At last Hitler gives names: the Reich chairman was Karl Harrer; the head of the Munich local group (no other existed) and the author of the pamphlet was Anton Drexler. The meeting was painful—\"small-town club business \\Vereinsmeierei] of the worst kind.” Yet he detected \"good faith and good will,” a longing like his own for a new movement.4 Never could he, with his \"lack of schooling,” have gone to one of the larger parties to face the condescension of their educated leaders and the impossible task of altering their ideas, but in the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, \"this ridiculous little creation,” he could change things and could shine among less than equals. After two days of troubled brooding, he made his decision and received a provisional member¬ ship card with the number seven.5 Hitler goes on to describe the depressing picture presented by the party: weekly sessions of the committee, which actually included the whole party membership; its \"parliamentary” actions and its handwrit¬ ten or typed invitations to meetings; the small triumph finally achieved when the use of mimeographed notices produced an audience of thirtyfour. Then came more daring ventures: into the Hofbraukeller across the Isar, where Hitler spoke to over a hundred people; to larger halls, the Eberlbrau, and the Deutsches Reich in the Dachauerstrasse near the barracks. Over four hundred came to the party’s seventh public meet¬ ing.6 Now Hitler was in control, and after the resignation of the over¬ cautious Harrer, the decision was made to try a mass meeting on February 24 in the huge barrel-vaulted hall of the Hofbrauhaus. Red placards announced it; the hall was packed. After the first speaker (not named in Mein Kampf), Hitler rose to face an audience more than half hostile, elucidated the twenty-five points of the party’s platform, and converted the crowd to unanimous support of every point. Thus, after nearly four hours they departed, and the fire was enkindled, Hitler declaims, to forge the sword that would give \"Siegfried” his freedom and restore life to the German nation.7 What he offers is a heroic legend in half-naturalistic style, young\n\n8\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nSiegfried warbling his wood-notes wild in Munich beer halls. Some of this interesting legend is true, but Hitler had an ability to forget, or ignore, or invent facts and incidents even over as short a period as that from 1919 to 1924, and to rearrange them for artistic effect. Despite gaps in the evidence, enough documents exist to correct this legend. First, there are the origins of the movement that was to conquer Germany. Here Drexler and Harrer are the principals, and the Munich locomotive shops, the elegant Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten, and shabby back rooms in shabby taverns are the setting.8 Drexler, a native of Munich, started this particular phase of German national racism (though no serious discussion can ignore its forerun¬ ners, particularly Theodor Fritsch and his journal Hammer, in many societies and political groupings before 1914).9 Like Hitler, Drexler re¬ fused to accept the Social Democrats as the voice of labor and conse¬ quently lost a job in Berlin. In 1902, back in Munich, he became a locksmith at the locomotive works. Physically unfit for the army, he found an outlet for his patriotism in the Vaterlandspartei and in found¬ ing at Munich in March 1918, as an offshoot of a national movement, the \"Workers’ Committee for a Good Peace.”10 A speech he delivered to colleagues from the locomotive shops on March 7 urged Bavarians, especially workers, to strengthen their will to victory and called for action against profiteers and speculators.11 Early in October he held a public meeting, calling for a new \"na¬ tional citizens’ league,” urging \"Bourgeois, workers, unite!”12 The audi¬ ence was largely hostile. The November revolution discouraged him only temporarily; a week later he was approached by a curious emissary, Harrer, and asked to form with his friends a \"Political Workers’ Circle” (Politischer Arbeiterzirkel). The circle became the first cell of the Na¬ tional Socialist movement.13 Harrer represented a different line from Drexler’s national-social-labor platform. A reporter on the Rightist Munchner-Augsburger Abendzeitung, he shared the murky ideas taught among \"intellectual” racists and was a member of the Thule Gesellschaft, which served as ally and cover in Bavaria for the semisecret, activist, violently volkisch Germanenorden. An affluent adventurer, Rudolf von Sebottendorff, had reor¬ ganized this order in Bavaria during 1918 and acquired rooms for it in the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten. Harrer was assigned to spread Thule ideas among the workers. He did not reach many, but he did reach Drexler.14 The circle, directed by Harrer, met from November 1918 at least until the following fall. Hitler could well have called these sessions\n\nHITLER AND THE DEUTSCHE ARBEITERPARTEI\n\n9\n\n\"Vereinsmeierei.” Harrer regularly presented the evening’s theme— \"Germany’s greatest foe: The Jew,” \"Who is responsible for the World War?” \"Could we have won the war?” From three to seven members (about a dozen different names appear)—artisans, small merchants, colleagues from the shops, and for a time a gentleman named Von Heimburg—sat about the table discussing the evening’s topic. Bitter¬ ness against the Jews, the need of \"enlightening” the workers, hostility to England marked the discussions.15 Clearly Drexler was the political figure in this assemblage. In Decem¬ ber he proposed founding a party, and on January 5, at another small tavern, the Fiirstenfelder Hof, he launched his creation, the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, before an audience of twenty-four, mostly friends from the shops.16 Even under the Leftist regimes in Munich that followed Kurt Eisner’s assassination in February, the DAP and the circle carried on their twilit existence. An undated draft of a \"discussion speech” by Drexler, possi¬ bly delivered at a Leftist meeting during this period, urged \"the liber¬ ation of the workers, yes, of all humanity” and, with anti-Semitic over¬ tones, \"the sovereignty of a government borne by the popular will.”17 He barely missed arrest at the Thule rooms, where a DAP meeting was scheduled for April 29, and thus perhaps escaped the fate of the seven Thule members whose shooting the next day by the Reds was one of the chief sources of anti-Leftist and anti-Semitic passion in Bavaria.18 Henceforth the omens were favorable for a movement like Drexler’s, under the rigid military regime and the prevailing hostility of the Munich bourgeoisie to the Left and the Jews. Army and police reports and minutes of cabinet meetings, to be sure, at first made little mention of the latter in 1919.19 But army intelligence reports from July on showed an ominous undercurrent, breaking through in epidemics of anti-Jewish stickers, or \"general railing” (Schimpfen) at the Jews, with the newly formed Deutschvolkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund and the Thule Gesellschaft obviously fostering this mood and directing the popular hatred against profiteers ( Wucherer and Schieber) toward antiSemitism.20 Ernst Pohner, the Munich police president who became one of Hitler’s main allies, noted in his weekly survey early in Septem¬ ber increasing economic anti-Semitism and in November reported that the chief demand of anti-Semitic propaganda was for \"breaking Jewish loan capital and the disproportionate influence of the Jews in the lead¬ ership of the German people.” Feder’s dogmas of interest slavery were obviously catching on. Racist \"excesses and illegalities” must of course\n\n10\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nbe combatted, Pohner wrote. A week later, on November 22, he stated that workers, too, were becoming interested in anti-Semitism, \"espe¬ cially the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, founded only two months ago[!], already firmly established in Munich.” \"The anti-Semitic wave is only beginning,” he noted.21 With this report, the DAP entered the ambiguous immortality of the police records. Its own records give an indication of how and when it grew. There are attendance lists for some eleven meetings in 1919, beginning on May 17, when ten members were present.22 Hitler’s close friend Dietrich Eckart spoke in August to an audience of thirty-eight; forty-two were present on September 12, when Hitler’s signature first appears: \"Gefreiter Miinchen 2. I. Rgt.” His name appeared again on October 16, when the audience numbered over seventy, including Karl Brassier, contributor to the Rightist newspaper Munchener Beobachter. Finally the DAP achieved a long notice in the press. The Beobachter, not yet a party organ, reported on October 22 that Dr. Erich Kuhn, editor of the Pan-German monthly Deutschlands Erneuerung, spoke on \"The Jewish Question a German Question,” and that afterward \"Herr Hitler of the DAP discussed with passion the need for union against the common enemy of the nations, and gave reasons for sup¬ porting a German press, so the people can find out what is suppressed by the Jewish papers.” From this point, the Beobachter, the police intelligence reports pub¬ lished by Ernst Deuerlein, and a larger set of police reports in the Hauptarchiv help to check Hitler’s memory.23 His first formal per¬ formance for the party was in the Eberlbrau on November 12 (or 13), on a favorite theme, \"Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.” On November 26, before an audience of three hundred, he contrasted promises and reality under the Republic. Two weeks later, in the beer hall Deutsches Reich, an audience of equal size heard him declaim on \"Germany facing her deepest degradation.” After the Christmas recess, four hundred of the faithful gathered in mid-January to hear Feder; Hitler, following him, argued the justification for a workers’ party opposed to Jews and capitalism. Dietrich Eckart drew a smaller crowd on February 5 (or 6). But Hitler’s big push for a mass meeting had already begun.24 Hitler’s stress on his affinity with the \"ridiculous” little party has been noted above. He remarks that he was \"impoverished and poor,” \"one of the nameless ones,” \"one of the millions that chance allows to live or die, without even their closest environment deigning to notice.”25\n\nHITLER AND THE DEUTSCHE ARBEITERPARTEI\n\n11\n\nThis picture of the anonymous hero is of course part of his myth cre¬ ation, for he was a rather well-known figure in Munich army circles when he first visited a meeting of the party, and he continued his activity for the Reichswehr—something he does not mention—during the months when, according to Mein Kampf, he was devoting himself to the party. Deuerlein’s documentation26 tells of Hitler’s early participa¬ tion in the courses organized by Captain Karl Mayr of the Munich Reichswehr, who, impressed by Hitler’s rhetorical talents, assigned him to the Kommando Beyschlag, which indoctrinated returning prisoners of war at the transit camp Lechfeld. Here, late in August, Hitler lec¬ tured on \"Peace Terms and Reconstruction” and \"Social and Economic Slogans.” The fan mail of the participants leaves no doubt of their enthusiasm for his \"temperamentvolle Vortrage.” The charisma was at work. Thus it was not as the unknown soldier that Hitler joined the DAP. His two careers, army and politics, ran side by side. He is listed in Jan¬ uary and February 1920 as a lecturer in the \"citizenship continuation courses” conducted for soldiers by the Reichswehr: \"Herr Hittler” be¬ sides such dignitaries as the Munich University historians K. A. von Muller and Paul Joachimsen.27 He spoke on \"The Peace of Versailles” and \"The Political Parties and Their Significance,” delivering one of his lectures on February 25, the afternoon following his presentation of the party program at the Hofbrauhaus. One month later he was dis¬ charged from the army, and Captain Mayr’s strange plant was definitively transferred to even more fertile soil. None of this is in Mein Kampf. What of the other side—the gloomy little group of members, always the same, according to Hitler, meeting as the \"committee” of the DAP? Here the documents are less revealing. One difficulty is the un¬ clear distinction between Arbeiterzirkel and committee. The former evidently remained as a secret inner circle, Harrer’s pet, dutifully chew¬ ing its cud.28 Drexler’s draft of the minutes of the circle meeting of November 16 (a photostat was provided by Frau Anni Widmaier) re¬ cords Hitler’s first visit: \"Present: Herr Harrer Drexler Hitler as new member. Introduction of Herr Hitler into the spirit of the circle, by Hr. Harrer. Reading of letters received, and replies to them. It was re¬ solved to elect a committee to prepare for the setting up [Aufstellung, presumably of a program], with the following members: Harrer, Dr. Feder, Dr. [Paul] Tafel, Hitler, Drexler. Following this, discussion of the party program. Foundation of an anti-Semitic association [Arbeitsgesellschaft? word unclear].”29 Evidently Hitler was also present at a circle\n\n12\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nmeeting on November 24, where he consented to become director of a party speakers’ school. It is still uncertain whether he was number 7 in the circle, as its first secretary, Lotter, contends, or number 7 of the party committee, as Drexler and Rudolph Schiissler, later business manager of the party, have it. The latter is more probable, considering the fluctuating membership of the circle and Drexler’s precise statement. In any case, Hitler was never party member number 7. The attendance lists of meetings in 1919 consistently show more than seven present; Drexler indicates that there were nearly a hundred members before Hitler joined. His official number was 555 (no magic in that!) on the first party membership lists, set up alphabetically and beginning with number 501 to give the impression of greater size. To crown this legend, \"555” was erased from his membership card and \"7” inserted.30 The imperialist Hitler could of course tolerate no other leaders in the party. In December he drafted regulations for the committee, previously organized as a normal parliamentary body, to give it full authority and to ban any \"side government” by a \"circle or lodge”— obviously aimed at Harrer, who bowed out of office and party early in January 1920.31 Meanwhile horizons were broadening, and money, in driblets, but enough for some expansion, came in. Thus the peripatetic party late in December rented (for fifty marks a month, in advance, light and heat extra) a ground floor room in the Sternecker.32 More important, Drexler and Hitler set to work on a platform. The circle had con¬ sidered this subject in May, with Harrer proposing three [!} pro¬ grams: a basic one, a \"working program” adaptable to changing cir¬ cumstances, and a \"party program” defining exactly its goals.33 An early version by Drexler of the basic program stresses \"idealistic Weltanschauungequal rights and duties, physical education, and \"an open road for all talents for the common good.” Much of it, except for the ominous phrase \"Germany for the Germans,” read like a nineteenth-century reformist document.34 The circle, with Hitler, discussed the program on November 16, and on December 14 Drexler had a new draft ready. It was idealistic and nationalistic, familiar refrains, but now with new emphases, on the unity of the Reich, the exclusion of Jews and foreigners from govern¬ ment, the union of all producers (Schaffenden) against loan capital and interest slavery, and on bridging the gap between physical and in¬ tellectual workers, and a plebiscite to decide between a republic and a V olks-Kaisertum35\n\nHITLER AND THE DEUTSCHE ARBEITERPARTEI\n\n13\n\nIn his letter of January 1940, Drexler indignantly reminded his Fiihrer that \"following all the basic points already written down by me, Adolf Hitler composed with me—and with no one else—the 25 theses of National Socialism, in long nights in the workers’ canteen at Burghausenerstrasse 6.” Together, then, and with the larger contribu¬ tion probably Drexler’s, they worked over the draft of the twenty-five points. The final version has some changes of order and emphasis from Drexler’s draft of February 9. Profit sharing, a pet thesis of Drexler, was stressed less, while \"land reform” received fuller attention; the newly inserted and repeated \"We demand” (Wir fordern) sounds dis¬ tinctly like Hitler.36 And so, with a program in hand and the tide running favorably, all was set for the great coup, the first mass meeting, still under the old party name, though by the beginning of March \"National Socialist” was prefixed to \"German Workers’ Party.”37 Drexler read at the large meeting of February 5 (or 6) the party’s first propaganda leaflet— \"Warum musste die DAP kommen? Was will sie?”—with \"antiJesuitism” added to the familiar slogans.38 Hitler makes much of the dangers of the meeting of February 24, though large anti-Semitic gatherings in Munich were no rarity by then. He tells of his personal management of propaganda, placards, and handbills and his fear that the hall would not be full. Drexler’s letter tells it differently. He, not Hitler, proposed a big public meeting in the Hofbrauhaus. In fact, he had to overcome Hitler’s objections to it. Hitler does not mention that the red placards and the advertisement in the Beobachter neither listed his name nor alluded to the proclama¬ tion of the DAP program, nor that the \"first speaker,” proposed by Drexler, was a guest, not a party member—Dr. Johannes Dingfelder, a familiar volkisch and Hammerbund figure even before the war. Drexler tells of taking to Dingfelder a copy of the newly typed twenty-five points to explain what the DAP was about, \"but one thing I did not tell Dingfelder was that a certain Adolf Hitler was speaking after him.”39 The Hauptarchiv contains a manuscript of the speech \"What We Need” {Was uns not tut) that Dingfelder had already delivered five times for the patriotic Heimatdienst and a carbon copy of Dingfelder’s undated recollections of the meeting, entitled \"Wie es kam!”40 He re¬ calls that on February 20 Drexler and Schiissler, both strangers to him, invited him to address the meeting; Drexler explained that no one else dared to. (Ten years later, Dingfelder adds, he found out that a Communist had threatened to shoot both Hitler and the chief speaker.)\n\n14\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nHe arrived in the overcrowded hall, learned that the expected chair¬ man, Drexler, had had a nervous collapse, and that four hundred Reds were present. He decided to avoid trouble by not using the word \"Jew.” Marc Sesselmann, a member of Thule and the DSP and an edi¬ tor of the Beobachter, opened the meeting. For acoustical reasons Dingfelder stood on a table beside the huge tiled stove at one side of the hall. He got through his speech with no trouble; indeed, Sesselmann thanked the Reds for keeping quiet. Then, after a few comments from the audience, Hitler, \"a thin man with a small moustache,” walked to the front of the hall, and the Reds’ tumult began. Dingfelder’s speech, eloquent at times, found the cause of the war in the general lapse from natural law and religion. He quoted Shakespeare and Schiller to show the beauties of order and brought in recent history—the murder of the hostages in Munich, Bolshevism, \"people of foreign race”—to demonstrate the horrors of disorder. \"I am a Communist too,” he announced, \"but in the Christian sense.” \"Selfless leaders” were needed, not those \"spiritually blind, who stand under the influence of foreign races.” He praised Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff and concluded, \"For us too a savior is approach¬ ing!” If Germans once reawaken to order, work, and duty, \"the world will—must—at last find health through the German spirit!” Hitler’s short narrative of the meeting in Mein Kampf describes it as his personal, overwhelming triumph: how he pronounced point after point of the program \"amid ever-increasing jubilation,” until the mass stood \"united by a new conviction, a new faith, a new will.” He concludes the first volume of his book with \"So the hall slowly emptied. The movement took its course.”41 The hero legend of the conquest of the Hofbrauhaus as archetype of the conquest of Germany! The Beobachter, to be sure, was less emo¬ tional.42 On February 28 a notice perhaps five inches long appeared on an inside page, over half of it devoted to Dingfelder’s speech. It continues: \"Herr Hitler (DAP) presented some striking political points \\_entivickelte einige treffende politische Bilder\\, which evoked spirited applause, but also roused the numerous already prejudiced opponents present to contradiction; and he gave a survey of the party’s program, which in its basic features comes close to that of the Deutschsozialistische Partei.” This one sentence is all there is about Hitler. The report notes that the discussion following was very lively, \"but toward the end strayed from the theme,” and that the meeting left the impres¬ sion of a movement \"that will force its way through under all circum-\n\nHITLER AND THE DEUTSCHE ARBEITERPARTEI\n\n15\n\nstances.” But what has become of the revelation to the masses, the \"shouts of applause” that drowned out objectors, the resolute ham¬ mering through of point after point until the hall was filled with men \"united by a new conviction, a new faith, a new will”? Fortunately other papers reported the meeting, though the accounts in four Munich \"bourgeois” newspapers are so similar that they may well be from a single hand.43 They concentrate on Dingfelder. Typically, the Munchener Zeitung of February 25 sums up the rest of the meet¬ ing: \"The Committee member Hitler presented [entivickelte], follow¬ ing the lecture, the DAP program, which among other things stands for a Greater Germany, opposes the Jews, and demands the breaking of interest slavery. During the discussion—cut short because of the late hour, but in part stormy—the leader of the unemployed, Braig, sup¬ ported by a group of opponents of the DAP, spoke, with the rest of the gathering objecting, against the new workers’ party.” Finally, the author of the police report in the Hauptarchiv, the fullest contemporary account, tells in detail what happened after Dingfelder’s speech. Hitler rose to ring the usual changes on Versailles, poverty, corruption, profiteering, and internationalism, and to read the program to a discordant audience: \"Often there was such a tumult that I thought fighting [Schldgereien} would start any moment.” After him, Sesselmann spoke, as did Braig, of the Independent Socialists, Ernst Ehrensperger of the DAP, and an opponent whose appeal for a Leftist dictatorship unloosed such an uproar that Hitler’s final words were lost, and a hundred Independent Socialists and Communists thronged out on the street singing the \"International,” shouting \"Down with Hindenburg, Ludendorff, and the German Nationalists!” This, and not the awed silence of a converted congregation, was the real conclusion of Hitler’s first great public triumph. Let us review the facts and fancies of Hitler’s version of this crucial time. He stylizes his life into the Marchen pattern of the Bdrensohn or Starker Hans, the male Cinderella, with the story of 1919-1920 as the central episode in his saga of the boy from Braunau who was to save Germany. As the coming savior, he must be unique; hence the dearth of reference to earlier, similar movements, the stress on the new Weltan¬ schauung of the party, the omission of its early history and of its rivals, like the DSP, much more important at that time in Munich and Nurem¬ berg and the north than the DAP. As the hero figure, he had to do everything great himself; hence the omission of the Reichswehr’s con¬ tinuing sponsorship, the condescension or hostility toward Drexler and\n\n16\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nHarrer, the only early party colleagues he names, and the implication that he was the real creator of the program. As the player of the great role he must achieve things dramatically and suddenly; thus he obliter¬ ates traces of everything but himself in his fantastic story of the meeting of February 24. But, with the exceptions noted, particularly regarding the party num¬ ber and the Hofbrauhaus meeting, the myth is produced rather by stylization and omission than by invention. Most of the few facts he gives are no further removed from actuality than might be expected in the circumstances of writing Mein Kampf. But, in searching for the reality of Hitler, it is worth observing that the only scenes in the whole book sketched in full detail are those of his first visits to the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei. There, one can surmise, he found himself.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf (2 vols., Munich, 1930), I, Chaps. VIII, IX, 518-525, 624-629.

Thule was active in April 1919 against the Soviet rulers of Munich, and seven of its members were shot by the Reds as \"hostages” on April 30.

Both state that Hitler attended a circle meeting in September, but the minutes quoted and Drexler’s evidence (see note 30, below) outweigh these statements. 30. See HA, No. 78, Lotter, \"Der Beginn,” and ibid., No. 1372, letter of Schiissler to Dr. Uetrecht of the Hauptarchiv, typescript, November 20, 1941. In January 1936 Drexler told Dr. Damann of the Hauptarchiv (HA, No. 81, Aktennotiz Damann) that Hitler first attended a circle meeting on November 16. This agrees with the minutes of that meeting. Drexler, outraged by distorted official radio \"history” of the party’s origin, drafted a long, angry letter to Hitler late in January 1940, of which Frau Widmaier has made available a carbon copy. In it he stated: “No one knows better than you yourself, my Fiihrer, that you were never the seventh member of the party, but at most the seventh member of the committee, which I asked you to join as propaganda chief (Werbeobmann).\" In this letter—never sent, since Drexler planned to forward it to Hitler after the war—are also the statements about the size of the party in September 1919 and about the \"forging” of Hitler’s party card. 31.

Feb. 20, photostat of typescript, signed by Drexler. Hasselbach, Fntstehung, pp. 12, 19, 26—36, evidently relying on information from Drexler, discusses the development of the program. 37. Curiously, the Hauptarchiv seems to have no account of this important change, which may have been explained by hopes of closer association with older German National Socialist parties in Austria and Czechoslovakia. 38. HA, No. Ill, has the text of the leaflet; see also Drexler’s letter of Jan¬ uary 1940. 39- HA, No. 884, correspondence of Dingfelder with Julius Rfittinger of the Hammerbund; Hitler, Mein Kampf, I, 400-405; Drexler, letter of January 1940. 40. HA, No. 1214, file of Dingfelder. The only significant discrepancy from the police report of the meeting (see above, p. 15) is Dingfelder’s statement that Sesselmann, not Hitler, presided. Here Dingfelder errs; not only the ac¬ count in Mein Kampf, but an earlier article, \"Zur Erinnerung an die Versammlung vom 24. Februar 1920 im Miinchner Hofbrau,” published anonymously in the Beobachter (February 22, 1922), but clearly by Hitler, confirms the logical assumption that Hitler, not Sesselmann, ran the meeting. The Beobachter article, which to be sure mentions Dingfelder, already shows the legend formation at work: the \"storm of jubilation” of the crowd, the hammering through of the pro¬ gram \"point by point,” and—a striking metaphor, missing from Mein Kampf— the feeling at the end \"that now a wolf has been born, destined to burst in upon the herd of seducers and deceivers of the people.” 41. Hitler, Mein Kampf, I, 405f. 42. The paper, which changed its name during 1919 from Miinchener to Volkischer Beobachter, was still officially a nonpartisan volkisch organ, though in fact it stood closest to the Deutschsozialistische Partei. Only after political and financial crises, solved in part by the famous \"loan” by Franz Ritter von Epp to Dietrich Eckart in December 1920, did the Beobachter appear as the NSDAP organ. 43. Copies of the several press accounts are in the Friedrich J. M. Rehse Col¬ lection, Acc. No. 11,564: \"Berichte der Presse fiber obenstehend angekfindigte Versammlung,” Manuscript Division, Library of Congress. The Independent Socialist Der Kampf and most of the \"bourgeois” press reported the meeting; the Bayerischer Kurier and the Social Democratic Miinchener Post evidently ignored it. HA, No. 78, Lotter, \"Der Beginn,” states that over 100 new members, swept away by Hitler and the program, joined the party in the Hofbrauhaus at the meeting. Probably the most authentic membership list from 1920, however (photostat of typescript, by courtesy of Frau Widmaier), records no new mem¬ bers that day, 36 for February 25 (37 for February 5, and 92 for May 1, 1920).\n\n2 JOSEPH L. NYOMARKAY\n\nFactionalism in the National Socialist German Workers’ Party, 1925-26: The Myth and Reality of the “Northern Faction” In the months following his less than auspicious appearance at the Hofbrauhaus, Hitler did in fact come to he the most successful agitator of the party, noiv the NSDAP. By the summer of 1921 he had estab¬ lished himself as its unchallenged leader. The next two years were de¬ voted to strengthening the fledgling organization and extending it be¬ yond Munich to other parts of Bavaria. Special emphasis was placed on the party’s stormtroop adjunct, the SA (Sturmabteilung), since Hitler aimed at an overthroiv of the republican state, either by force or threat of force {as in Mussolini’s \"March on Rome’’). That approach was effectively discredited by the attempted beerhall putsch of November 1923, which was easily suppressed by forces loyal to the Bavarian gov¬ ernment. Arrested, tried for treason, and sentenced to a prison term, Hitler was removed from active political life for more than a year. When he was released in December 1924 he had new plans for recon¬ structing the party, which still recognized him as its leader. But during his absence changes had taken place that were to complicate those plans. The result was the first major internal crisis of the NSDAP. The author of this selection, an Associate Professor of Political Sci¬ ence at the University of Southern California, examines that crisis in the light of new documentary evidence. And by analyzing the forces 21\n\n22\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nthat determined the outcome of the crisis, he seeks to establish the basic institutional nature of the NSDAP. Professor Nyomarkay has dealt with the latter question more extensively in his book, Charisma and Factionalism in the Nazi Party (Minneapolis, 1967). This selection first appeared in the Political Science Quarterly, LXXX (1966), 22-47. It is reprinted by permission of the publisher and the author.\n\nFew aspects of the history of the German Nazi party have received\n\nsuch scant scholarly attention as the nature of its factional1 Although references to intraparty conflicts may be found in counts dealing with the movement, no attempt has yet been make factional conflicts the subject of a thorough academic\n\nconflicts. most ac¬ made to research.\n\nAdmittedly, factionalism was only of marginal significance in the history of the Nazi movement and this may well account for the lagging academic interest in the subject. In striking contrast to Socialist and Communist movements where factional conflicts have raised dramatic issues, frequently to the point of splitting these movements, and have been of lasting significance, the history of Nazi factionalism was neither so dramatic nor so enduring in its effects. The several Nazi factions passed out of existence without seriously affecting the course of party history. Factionalism did not split the movement, did not give rise to competing sets of leaders, did not seriously compromise Hitler’s leader¬ ship and authority at any time, did not raise important questions of theory, and, with the exception of 1934, did not result in mass purges. But the failure of the Nazi factions can hardly justify the lack of academic interest in the subject. Indeed, it is exactly the impotence of the Nazi factions which should have raised some fundamental questions about the nature of factionalism in the movement. How, after all, can this failure be explained in view of the considerable organizational strength and able leaders that these factions possessed? The Working Association of North and West (the Northern Faction) in 1925-1926, the Kampfverlag circle in 1926-1930, and the Stormtroops (SA) until 1934 represented the most dynamic and powerful segments of the movement, yet when Hitler turned against them they dissolved without a trace. Why did these factions capitulate to Hitler so easily? Why did they not give rise to splinter movements? Why were the leaders of these factions, apparently so popular and powerful, abandoned by their fol¬ lowers at the crucial moment? Why were there no mass purges and why\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n23\n\nwere Hitler’s authority and leadership never in serious jeopardy? Why, in short, was the factional experience in the Nazi party so radically different from the factional conflicts in the Socialist and Communist parties? Answers to these questions presuppose an extensive comparative study, a requirement which cannot be satisfied in an article. The present essay is merely the first step in this direction and constitutes only a part of a more comprehensive study of factionalism. The purpose of this article is partly historical, partly conceptual and comparative. In the first sense, it attempts to fill a neglected aspect of historical research. The character and nature of the Northern Faction has long been the subject of facile and superficial generalizations which have obscured most of the peculiar¬ ities of Nazi factionalism. This has been partly due to the lack of avail¬ able primary source materials on the internal aspects of the Nazi move¬ ment in the post-1925 period. The American Historical Association’s Berlin Document Center microfilm project has made such material avail¬ able in this country and has made this study possible. The second objective of this essay is to suggest hypotheses concerning the pattern of factional behavior in the Nazi party on the basis of this research2 in the hope that these might yield useful analytical tools for comparative studies. In particular, this essay will suggest a direct rela¬ tionship between the pattern of intragroup conflicts and the nature of legitimacy operative in the group. The charismatic principle of legiti¬ macy appears to have had a direct influence on the nature of factionalism in the Nazi party, while the ideological nature of legitimacy in Socialist and Communist movements seems to have influenced the character of factional conflicts in those movements. If this hypothesis is valid, a study of factional conflicts might be a promising back-door approach to a comparative study of political movements. I\n\nThe year 1924 marks the passing of a distinct phase of National Socialism. Prior to that date the movement was regional, largely re¬ stricted to Bavaria and to the southern part of Germany. Its political orientation was strongly identified with the nationalism of the forces of the Right and the military. Its propaganda and organizational activi¬ ties were predicated on the idea of a putsch.3 Beginning with 1924 a considerable shift of emphasis took place in each of these concerns of the party. As a result of Gregor Strasser’s organizational talents and his alliances with the volkisch groups of\n\n24\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nNorth Germany, National Socialism made considerable headway in the north after 1924, as Table 1 illustrates.

The functioning local party organizations were informed early in March 1925 that as of that mo¬ ment old membership cards became invalid and new applications for membership had to be submitted to the Munich headquarters.5 This created grave problems for the local party leaders, who found it difficult to make the old party members understand why they should be paying new initiation fees.8 The other factor that created difficulties on the local level was Hitler’s demand that local party organizations rupture their ties with all volkisch groups and that no party member should be allowed to maintain simultaneous membership in any volkisch associa¬ tion.7 This was a bitter pill to swallow for many local party leaders who had traditionally identified the Nazi party with the volkisch idea. Many of the local leaders refused to make the break and declined to subordinate themselves unconditionally to Hitler’s personal leadership\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n25\n\nin the early months of 1925. As a consequence of these factors, several local party organizations seceded or were dissolved during these early months, especially in the southern areas where most of the Nazi party organizations existed prior to 1925.8 In the north most of the local organizations were being built from the bottom up; hence that area was not correspondingly affected by these problems. Fortunately for Hitler, because of the organizational weakness of the volkisch movement most of the dissident Nazi leaders were forced to realize in the following months or years that they had no future outside the Hitler party. Soon they were to bow to Hitler’s point of view, one by one capitulating unconditionally to his demands.9 Thus the decline of the local party organizations in the south was only a temporary phe¬ nomenon; by 1928 they had overcome their setback of 1925 (Table 2).

Although the northern districts underwent a period of relative stagnation in terms of member¬ ship in the latter part of the 1920’s, for some time after 1925 they still remained the most promising part of the movement.11 Their promise lay in their attempts to identify themselves with the working classes, while the southern districts still tended to cling for the most part to the bourgeois, antisocialist, racist idea of National Socialism.12 Munich re¬ mained the business and spiritual stronghold of the movement, but there was little question that the dynamic part of the organization lay in the north.\n\n26\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nThe socialistic, working-class orientation of the movement in the north after 1925 cannot be conclusively supported by the available statistical data.13 However, ample evidence to this effect can be gathered from the available party correspondence from the year 1925-1926, which appears to be persuasive. In their frequent (almost daily) reports to headquarters, the local party leaders of the north tended to stress the importance of associating their movement with the Left in order to attract members of the working classes.14 Thus, the local leader of the city of Liibeck stressed the importance of \"going to the workers.” If we can get only fifty Social Democrats,” he asserted, \"we are better off and are more secure than if we had a battalion of the Tannenberg League with seven officers and sixty men.” In conclusion he affirmed that \"Playing soldiers won’t help here.”15 District leader Josef Klant of Hamburg reported to headquarters: \"We have won fifty workers, which pleases us more than fifty doctors.”16 Reports from Danzig,17 Halle,18 East-Hannover,19 South-Hannover,20 Elbe-Havel district,21 Anhalt-Dessau,22 Mecklenburg,23 and Schleswig-Holstein24 contained similar sentiments and listed with great pride and self-satisfaction the party’s successes in industrial districts. Many of these districts suggested the formation of National Socialist trade unions in order to attract the manual workers.25 Thus the Socialist element became a prominent part of Nazi appeals in the north after 1924. Social justice, nationalization of the economy, \"bread community,” and other socialistic tenets were prominent in the speeches of Gregor Strasser.26 That these principles were not ends in themselves but means to the establishment of an organic national com¬ munity was of crucial significance, but a distinction too subtle to be noticed by those to whom the speeches were addressed. What was im¬ portant for Strasser’s audiences was the expression of and emphasis on these principles; for what ends they were to be used was of secondary importance. The post-1924 tendencies in the north introduced significant changes in the organizational base of the movement as well. The keystones of the northern part of the movement were the local organizations which sprang up on the initiative of local citizens and were financed from membership dues and private contributions.27 The network of local organizations put the movement on a more secure foundation and was important during the period of relative economic prosperity and inter¬ national peace of the late 1920’s. These local cells became indispensable nuclei around which the great masses of new party members could be organized after 1929.\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n27\n\nThese changes were by no means contrary to the ideas that Hitler had developed while in prison. Indeed, they implemented those concepts of the party as laid down in Mein Kampf: the necessity of a mass base, dissociation from the right-wing bourgeois forces, and systematic party organization based on the principle of absolute leadership.28 What pro¬ duced the differences between the northerners and Hitler were not issues of substance but the principle of absolute leadership and issues of tactics. II\n\nUpon his release from prison in 1924, Hitler set out to forge a strongly disciplined party out of the loose association of local organizations which was all that remained of the old party.29 By the end of that year there was no effective central leadership in Munich, and the local organiza¬ tions, having been left to their own devices for so long, were beginning to develop independent attitudes. Many entered into close relationships with other groups, volkisch or Socialist (depending on the local circumstances), without bothering to keep Munich informed about their activities. Meanwhile, a correspond¬ ing confusion reigned in Munich. Hermann Esser, Gottfried Feder, Alfred Rosenberg, Philip Bouhler, and Franz X. Schwarz were in Munich but had hardly more in common than their physical proximity. Gregor Strasser spent most of his time in Berlin or traveling around North Germany trying to organize Nazism in the north. Ernst Rohm was involved with his Frontbann activities and seemed to care little about the problems of the \"politicians.” In the first issue of the new Volkischer Beobachter (February 26, 1925) Hitler published his \"Fundamental Directives” for the new party, and on the next day he convened his first party meeting at Munich. On this public occasion he appealed to all Nazis o bury their personal differences30 and to unite behind him for the sake of the movement. According to one observer, the result verged on the ridiculous: \"Singly and in pairs, men who had been bitter enemies mounted the platform and shook hands, some of them unable to restrain the tears which Hitler’s magic voice had worked up. In groups they vowed their forgiveness of each other and swore undying loyalty to the Fuehrer.”31 The unity of February 1925 remained confined to the leadership of the party for several months to come 32 It took Hitler and Bouhler sev¬ eral months to bring the great majority of the independent-minded local leaders into line and impose on them unitary party discipline. The party of 1925 was anything but disciplined and well organized. Conflicting sets of local leaders competed for recognition in numerous districts, and\n\n28\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nit was sometimes difficult for those sitting in Munich to know which faction would turn out to be more trustworthy in the future.33 By the end of the year, however, most of the local leaders had achieved official recognition and the centralizing authority of Munich was beginning to be effectively exerted on the local levels. As a consequence of cleverly designed policies, the Party Central Office in Munich under the effective direction of its business manager, Philip Bouhler, successfully extended its supervision and control over the minute details of local and district party organizations.34 The exclu¬ sive right of Munich to issue membership cards enabled the Central Office to keep accurate accounts of party membership in each district. Since the number of members determined the financial obligations of the local organizations to Munich, this knowledge enabled Bouhler to exercise strict control over local party finances. Local party organizations were required to collect one Reichsmark for each new member and onehalf a Reichsmark each month thereafter. The initiation fees as well as a quarter of the monthly membership dues were to be forwarded by the local organizations to the district offices whenever these were in exis¬ tence; in other instances these funds were to be forwarded directly to Munich. The district party leaders were required also to forward to Munich the initiation fees and one-tenth of the monthly membership dues. In addition, all extra contributions which local and district party leaders may have received from private individuals or groups were to be sent in toto to Munich.35 It is easy to appreciate why many local party leaders began to resent the progressive imposition of such central controls and supervision. The delays involved in the issuance of membership cards exasperated local leaders who found themselves besieged by individual applicants demanding their cards upon having paid their fees. Such local difficulties do not seem to have impressed the people in Munich who adamantly insisted on the scrupulous examination of each application regardless of the delay involved. However, the delay was only the lesser part of the problem from the local point of view. The real source of irritation was the financial obli¬ gation imposed by Munich on the district and local party organizations. Regardless of local circumstances, Bouhler demanded one Reichsmark for each new applicant and ten Pfennig each month for every registered member. The arguments of local party leaders that many of their mem¬ bers were unemployed workers, students, old people, or disabled vet¬ erans who did not have the money to pay failed to impress Bouhler.\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n29\n\nHe answered these complaints by monotonously repeating the official regulations and reminding the local leaders that their situation was not unique but shared by most of the other local organizations. In order to extract the money due to Munich, Bouhler frequently went so far as to refuse issuance of new membership cards for the local districts and to deny them speakers until financial affairs had been straightened out. This was of great importance for the local leaders who were dependent on Munich for literate speakers. The big prize, of course, was Hitler, and this was duly recognized by Bouhler who declared on one occasion that Hitler would not visit districts which owed money to Munich.36 Some exasperated local leaders, Josef Goebbels and Karl Kaufmann among them,37 issued their own membership cards in open defiance of party regulations. When called to account by Bouhler, they defiantly admitted their actions. They accused Bouhler of having no idea of local party affairs, and declared with amazing audacity that they had yet to see the contributions of the Munich headquarters to the development of the movement. They argued for the impossibility of requiring old Nazis to pay another initiation fee, especially when many of them had spent time in prison for having been Nazis. Similarly, it was impossible to collect dues from the unemployed.38 Such sentiments were more typical than unusual and were rooted in the attitudes of the man-in-the-field toward the members of the general staff. There was widespread feeling among local leaders that while they were carrying the lion’s share of the work, the headquarters got the lion’s share of the dues. There were dissatisfactions with the efficiency of the Munich office as well as with the occasionally conflicting directives coming from Munich.39 Such dissatisfactions on the local level were aggravated in the north by the quite perceptible differences in ideological orientation between the north and the Munich leadership.40 As a result, by the summer of 1925 some northern leaders wanted to assume the ideological offensive against the \"reactionary-bureaucratic” elements in the party.41 By late November discussions had reached the point where Gregor Strasser and Goebbels set out to draft a new party program which they planned to present for adoption at a conference of northern party leaders scheduled to meet in January 1926. Ill\n\nMuch has been made of this program and of the Hannover confer¬ ence of January 25, 1926.42 It has been alleged that this movement\n\n30\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nwas secessionist, primarily ideologically oriented, and directed against Hitler’s leadership.43 However, the party correspondence of the period tends to refute such interpretations, as do contemporary diaries and documents. Available primary sources show persuasively that the north¬ ern districts never developed into a \"separate party,”44 but worked under very effective control throughout the period. Contemporary documents also reveal that the ideological division between north and south was not as sharp as it has usually been portrayed.45 It can also be shown that while several of these leaders resented the firm hand of Bouhler, nothing was further from their minds than to challenge Hitler’s leadership. Hitler remained the only concrete point of unity in the heterogeneous move¬ ment. He was above the conflicts, and he was regarded \"as something mystical, unreal.”46 On January 25, 1926, the Hannover conference was convened. At this important meeting twenty-four northern party leaders were present rep¬ resenting seven northern party districts. The conference resolved to organize the \"Working Association of the North and West,” elected its officers, approved its propaganda organ, and adopted the draft program. The unanimity of the conference was broken only by Gottfried Feder and Robert Ley 47 The conference elected Gregor Strasser as the leader of the Associa¬ tion. As its propaganda chief and editor of the National Socialist Letters, the conference elected Otto Strasser, while Goebbels was appointed editorial writer. The editorial offices and the press of the Association were to be known thereafter as the Kampfverlag, indicating the revolu¬ tionary sentiments of its founders. The program of the Association stressed socialistic reforms in domes¬ tic politics and advocated a pro-Russian foreign policy. It proposed nationalization of heavy industry, distribution of unearned land holdings, and expropriation of royal properties. According to Otto Strasser, senti¬ ments were expressed against the idea of the absolute authority of the leader. \"We acknowledge no Pope who can claim infallibility,” Bernhard Rust is reported to have exclaimed.48 Such exclamations, however, assuming that they really were made, should not obscure the crucial fact that the conference was not directed against Hitler, but was organized to impress upon him the necessity of redefining the party program along socialistic lines. The conference did not repudiate Hitler’s leadership, but sought to capture his charismatic symbol for their cause. That this may have been their mistake was argued by Otto Strasser at a later date: \"Perhaps we should have acted at that moment, made Hitler honorary\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n31\n\npresident and thus prevented him from doing any damage by depriving him of all effective power in the Party. We did nothing, because we thought we were much more powerful than he. This was our error and it must be recognized.”49 Strasser, however, distorted the circumstances of 1925. The reason that they did not depose Hitler was not because they overestimated their power but because they knew that without Hitler the party could not survive. They needed Hitler’s name and authority. Besides, if they had wanted to get rid of Hitler, they should have done so in December or January before Hitler had reestablished his authority. At that time Gregor Strasser decided for Hitler and with this decision the last chance was given up to continue without him. The point is that they did not think of getting rid of him. On the contrary, they thought him to be on their side and they were sure that they would capture him for their positions, as Goebbels’s diary makes clear.50 The Hannover conference of January 1926 brought into the open the disagreements between the two camps. What made Hitler intervene and summon the Bamberg conference for February 14 was not the basic ideological disagreements which had existed for some time (and which were to continue to exist), but the direct challenge that the Hannover conference implied to the principle of absolute leadership. IV\n\nMany of the accounts published about the Bamberg conference can safely be classified as fiction. They have not only misrepresented the ascertainable facts concerning the conference, but have been predicated on the mistaken assumption that the Bamberg meeting was called to put an end to the Association which was organized against Hitler. A rep¬ resentative account may be quoted from one of the most authoritative studies on the history of Nazism: \"On 14 February 1926, he [Hitler] summoned a conference in his turn, this time in the South German town of Bamberg. Hitler deliberately avoided a Sunday, when the North Ger¬ man leaders would have been free to attend in strength. As a result the Strasser wing of the Party was represented only by Gregor Strasser and Goebbels.”51 In contrast to such accounts, the contemporary police report shows that the meeting was held on Sunday (February 14), and was attended by sixty to sixty-five party leaders. Several of these were from the north: Ernst Schlange (Berlin), Walter Ernst (Halle), Friedrich Hildebrandt (Mecklenburg), Gians (Hamburg), Bernhard Rust (Hannover), as\n\n32\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nwell as Gregor Strasser and Goebbels.52 It is not known how many other northern party leaders were present, since the police report does not include a complete list of the participants, but it is obvious that several of the most important leaders from the north were able to attend.53 In the absence of documentary evidence, the rest of the speculation contained in Bullock’s account cannot be challenged with equal cer¬ tainty. It can be argued, however, that the site of the conference was not chosen in order to make the cost of travel prohibitive for northern leaders. Had this been Hitler’s intention, the logical site of the confer¬ ence would have been Munich, the party headquarters, which lies some 150 miles farther south. Indeed, it may be argued that it was in Hitler’s interest to have as many northerners at the meeting as possible.54 Hitler’s purpose for calling the Bamberg conference was not to defeat the northern leaders, but to convince them of the necessity for party unity. He did not regard the northerners as his opponents but as subordinates who had to be brought back to the right track. Besides, it was not the purpose of Nazi party meetings to make decisions on the basis of majority rule. Thus, the number of northern leaders present was quite irrelevant to the outcome of the conference. To maintain that the reason for Hitler’s \"victory” at Bamberg was a packed conference reveals a basic misunderstanding not only of Hitler’s relationship with the north¬ ern leaders, but also of the nature of decision-making in the Nazi party. There are no known official records of the proceedings of the con¬ ference.55 The account of the conference which appeared in the official party newspaper indicates clearly enough, however, the major points of Hitler’s concern. According to the Volkischer Beobachter (February 25, 1926), Hitler addressed himself to three main topics. First, he re¬ jected Strasser’s idea of a Russian entente; that, according to Hitler, would have meant the bolshevization of Germany. Instead, he suggested that British and Italian alliances offered the most promising possibilities for Germany. The East he regarded as an area of colonization. Second, he rejected the northerners’ position with respect to the expropriation of royal properties on the principle that \"nothing should be given to them [princes] which does not belong to them,” but also that nothing should be taken away from them which belongs to them. \"We are for rights,” he declared. \"We know only Germans, not princes.” Third, he prohibited anyone from raising religious issues in the party because these \"have no place in National Socialism.” This is the extent of the newspaper’s report of the meeting. It ends with the following statement: \"The rest of the meeting was taken up\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n33\n\nby programmatic discussions in which several people participated be¬ sides Hitler, especially Feder, Strasser, and Streicher. Complete agree¬ ment was achieved.” Otto Strasser’s account goes beyond this report and states that the conference adopted the following resolutions: (1) abandonment of the Hannover program and reaffirmation of the Twenty-five Points, (2) dis¬ solution of the Association and the establishment of a unified party organization; (3) nomination of all district leaders by Hitler; (4) crea¬ tion of a party tribunal to regulate intraparty disputes with the power to expel members and to dissolve local organizations; the members of this tribunal were to be nominated by Hitler; and (5) establishment of the SA.56 The outcome of the conference is generally referred to as a victory for Hitler. It is submitted here that this is a misinterpretation, since there existed no movement against Hitler. At the conference Hitler refused to go along with the northern point of view, and this was a great blow to Strasser and Goebbels.57 However, Hitler did not handle them as defeated enemies; although the Association had to be dissolved, its propaganda organ in Berlin was allowed to continue. Gregor Strasser was put in charge of party propaganda, and just a few months later Goebbels was named district leader in Berlin-Brandenburg.58 The decisions of the conference proved to be conclusive. The Associa¬ tion of the North and West was immediately dissolved;59 Gregor Stras¬ ser went to Munich to assume his new position while continuing his association with his brother in the Kampjverlag. If the Northern Association had been directed against Hitler, however, the decision of a \"packed” conference would not have been accepted as a matter of course. In fact, there was not a single resignation or expulsion. Herbert Blank’s argument that the district leaders and Gregor Strasser abided by Hitler’s decision in early 1926 because they were financially depen¬ dent on their party offices is not convincing; four years later it may have been a more important factor.60 V\n\nThe readiness with which Hitler’s decisions were followed by the northern leaders, who only three weeks before had manifested such re¬ markable unity and strength of conviction in adopting their draft pro¬ gram and founding their Association, is not puzzling if one recognizes that their actions had not been directed against Hitler, but were predi¬ cated on his support. When Hitler pronounced the Hannover program\n\n34\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nwrong, the northerners, disappointed as they were, accepted his verdict. It is important to note, however, that Hitler did not attack the sub¬ stance of the Hannover program. He did not try to enforce an ideologi¬ cal uniformity in the movement. Indeed, his factotum, Goebbels, whom he had sent to Berlin in late 1926, assumed a position there just as socialistic and anticapitalistic as that of the other northern leaders. Ideological heterogeneity was a characteristic of the Nazi movement from its inception; it was of no concern to Hitler. There was no orthodoxy in Nazi ideology; the only orthodoxy was the totalitarian principle of absolute obedience to an absolute leader. Hitler called the Bamberg conference to ward off possible threats to his leadership. The quasi-independent organization of the northern dis¬ tricts implicitly challenged the Nazi principle that the leader was the sole center of the movement. No other institution or body of persons was to have an all-encompassing competence. Questions affecting the movement as a whole pertained to the leader alone. Others were al¬ lowed only limited authority delegated by the leader; they could act only within the spheres of their limited competence. The Hannover conference challenged this principle of party organiza¬ tion by assuming the right to decide questions pertinent to the move¬ ment as a whole. That the conference meant only to guide Hitler back to the \"true path” was immaterial to the issue. The second threat to Hitler’s absolute leadership was the proposed party program adopted in Hannover. Again, it was not the substance of the program that was important, but the mere existence of it. A program is by definition incompatible with the idea of absolute leader¬ ship. Its principles tend to bind the leader to certain courses of action and may be used as standards by which to evaluate the actions of the leader. A program gives every member of the political party an oppor¬ tunity (if not an obligation) to judge the actions of the leader and to call him to account. The leader becomes an executive and ceases to be a \"philosopher”; his responsibility will be to implement the principles of the program rather than to formulate the principles themselves. It is not certain to what extent the members of the Hannover con¬ ference were aware of these implications of their actions. Certainly, the idea of a democratic party organization was far removed from their minds. Their concern was simple and immediate. What they wanted was to set down the \"true” principles of Nazism, or, rather, those which promised the greatest political success. They did not think that these principles would be necessarily incompatible with the idea of absolute\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n35\n\nleadership which they understood only imperfectly. The participants in the Hannover conference did not mean to challenge Hitler’s authority; they only meant to fight the people who surrounded Hitler in Munich. It was a conflict between the men-in-the-field, the local party leaders, and the courtiers of the party headquarters. The Hannoverians were not aware, as Hitler was, of the implications of their resolutions for the principles of charismatic authority. Had they been aware that they were challenging Hitler’s authority, they hardly would have counted on his support in Bamberg. However, the motivations of the northern leaders were immaterial from Hitler’s point of view, for he realized immediately the implications of the draft program. At the Bamberg conference Hitler rejected the Hannover program; in May he declared the 1920 program as unalter¬ able.61 This placed all discussion about the program out of order, and the party took another step toward the program’s ultimate totalitarian ideological emptiness. The aim of the founders of the Working Association of North and West from 1925 to 1926 was to liberate Hitler from his Munich sur¬ roundings, not to challenge his leadership of the movement. Their pur¬ pose was to impress upon Hitler the necessity of a programmatic ap¬ proach based on socialistic principles if the movement were to meet with success in working-class circles. When they called the Hannover meeting to form the Association and to adopt the draft program, they appeared to be sincerely convinced that they were acting in good faith and in the best interests of the movement. They believed that their draft program incorporated the true principles of National Socialism, which had been corrupted by the Munich clique composed of Streicher, Esser, Rosenberg, Amann, and others. They thought that Hitler had been mis¬ led by this group which had managed to isolate him from the outside world. The northerners wanted to establish contact with Hitler and tended to be confident that once Hitler learned of their position he also would accept it. The most authentic evidence in support of these observations is Goebbels’s diary for the years 1925 and 1926. This diary, which was never intended for publication, was discovered in its original form after the end of the war. The entries represent Goebbels’s feelings and atti¬ tudes in those years and provide interesting insights into party affairs. On August 21, 1925, Goebbels noted, \"Hitler is surrounded by the wrong people.” Goebbels went on to state that the organization which Strasser and he were working on in the north would provide a weapon\n\n36\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nagainst the stale bureaucrats in Munich. On September 11 he noted that Hitler appeared to be between the two camps (the north which believed that socialism had to be achieved first in order to provide a broad basis for nationalism, and the south which believed that the worker had to be won over to the \"National Idea” directly), but that in principle he had already decided for the north. The continuing problem was Hitler’s inaccessibility. \"We have to get to Hitler,” Goebbels wrote on October 19; and again, he noted on November 2, \"perhaps it will be possible to have a longer discussion with Hitler.”62 Goebbels looked forward to the Bamberg meeting with great hopes and expectations. He thought that Feder would be defeated and Hitler would adopt their point of view.63 Then came the blow; Hitler turned against them. \"I feel as if I had been beaten,” Goebbels wrote after the conference. \"My heart aches. ... A sad journey home. ... I hardly say a word. A horrible night! Surely one of the greatest disappointments of my life. I do not believe Hitler without reservations any more. That is what is terrible: I have been deprived of my inner self. I am only half.”64 Goebbels idolized Hitler from the beginning, and to find himself in opposition to his leader was an unbearable burden for him.60 Hardly a week after the Bamberg meeting he wrote to Hitler protesting against Streicher’s attacks upon him. He spent the next weeks in anxious wait¬ ing for Hitler’s answer. On March 29 it finally arrived; Hitler invited him to speak in Munich. Goebbels spoke in Munich and at the end of the speech he was embraced by Hitler. \"I am terribly happy,” he noted.66 Goebbels was one of the leaders of the northern group in 1925-1926, the principal collaborator of Gregor Strasser, and the co-author of the draft program submitted at the Hannover conference. His recorded attitudes are certainly significant indications of the aims and purposes of the northerners in 1925-1926. They never considered moving against Hitler, but hoped to the very end to gain his support.67 Otto Strasser’s biographer summed up the 1926 crisis correctly when he wrote: \"They [the Strasser brothers] did not see the struggle in that light, they did not feel themselves to be working against Hitler. They only saw that Hitler was betraying the things he claimed to represent, the promise he had made, and sought to bring him back to them.”68 The factional experience of 1925-1926 also demonstrates the pattern of Hitler’s tactics. During 1925 he refused to take a stand in the dispute between the northern party leaders and the Munich office, to the great disappointment of Goebbels.69 However, this tactic of neutrality tended to strengthen Hitler’s position. As the issues sharpened, Hitler’s arbitra-\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n37\n\ntion became increasingly important for both sides. Consequently both had to depend on his mercy. Although Hitler was informed in November 1925 of the intention of the northern leaders to form an association at the Hannover meeting in January of the next year, he did not voice any displeasure. He easily could have prevented the meeting at that time, but he remained silent. He allowed the meeting because he did not consider the ideological arguments of Goebbels and Strasser to be threats to his authority. When, however, the second Hannover conference passed resolutions contradict¬ ing his policy on the expropriation issue, he immediately convened the Bamberg conference. When he finally made his move at Bamberg, there was no question of a party split. His decision was accepted in the north without the resignation of a single northern leader. Under the circumstances there was no need to punish a single member of the Association. He promoted the leader of the Association, Gregor Strasser, and a few months later appointed Goebbels as district leader of Brandenburg-Berlin. Participa¬ tion in the Association did not affect the careers of such prominent func¬ tionaries as Erich Koch, Karl Kaufmann, Bernhard Rust, Victor Lutze, and many other lesser figures. The actions of the charismatic leader were not those of a victor, but of a benevolent and forgiving arbiter. VI\n\nThere remains to suggest some explanations for the factional experi¬ ence of 1925-1926. As the fundamental hypothesis the proposition is advanced here that the nature and characteristics of intragroup divisions are determined by the nature of legitimacy of the group. Legitimacy in totalitarian movements may be either ideological or charismatic; it is either dogma or person that justifies the existence of the group. The existential requirement of both ideology and leader in totalitarian move¬ ments should not obscure the important realization that behind any organization there exists an idea which legitimizes or justifies the exis¬ tence of the group. This idea may be expressed in an ideology or it may adhere to a person and, accordingly, the group may be termed ideologi¬ cal or charismatic. In ideological movements the leaders will claim authority on the basis of the dogma, and will always represent them¬ selves as its representatives and carriers. Thus, for instance, Communist leaders have always been careful to give their power an ideological justification and not to appear more than instruments of the revealed faith.70 In charismatic movements, on the other hand, the leader claims\n\n38\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\nauthority because he incorporates the idea in his person. Thus, Hitler could identify the idea of National Socialism with his person instead of representing himself as an instrument of it. By definition, the leader and the idea were the same in Nazism; the idea was not something external and independent of the person of the leader, but was in¬ carnated in the leader. It is suggested here that the difference between ideological and charismatic legitimacy is of crucial importance for the pattern of fac¬ tional behavior because legitimacy not only defines the cohesive force in the group but also represents the basis of intragroup conflict. That is, in an ideological movement it is the dogma which ultimately holds the group together and which lends authority to the leader. It is, however, also the dogma which can give rise to various interpretations which can in turn become the bases of factional conflicts. The dogma legitimizes the group, but it can also lend legitimacy to factions. Hence, in ideologi¬ cal movements factions will always base themselves on some interpreta¬ tion of the ideology and will challenge the existing leadership on ideo¬ logical grounds. In charismatic movements, the identification of leader and dogma deprives the factions of an ideological base. Legitimacy inheres in the leader, hence an attack on the leader in a charismatic movement would be analogous to an attack on the dogma in an ideological movement. Yet the legitimizing idea of the movement can never be challenged, otherwise the dissenters would place themselves immediately outside the movement and as such would not compose factions which assume the framework of a group. In that case the conflict would be intergroup, not intragroup. For this reason, factions in ideological movements will always avoid attacks on dogma. In charismatic movements, for the same reasons, factions will always avoid attacks on the leader. In both cases the legitimizing idea will remain above factional strife, but while it will continue to bind the movement together, it can also provide the basis for intragroup conflict. This explains why Hitler managed to stay above the conflict in 1925 and 1926; why the factions, instead of challenging his authority, strove to gain his support. It was the personal nature of legitimacy which forced both the northerners and the Munich group to claim to be the representatives of Hitler and his truest followers. This also explains why Hitler could so easily put an end to the Associa¬ tion of the North and West at Bamberg. By turning against them, he deprived them of their legitimacy. From then on they could not claim to be Hitler’s representatives; they had no choice but to surrender, since opposition to Hitler would have meant opposition to National Socialism.\n\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIALIST GERMAN WORKERS’ PARTY\n\n39\n\nThus, the 1925-1926 factional conflict, taking place on the secondary level of leadership, not only preserved and enhanced Hitler’s authority and power, but also ensured the unity of the movement. Hitler was the ultimate arbiter to whom all factions appealed; he remained the only point of unity, the only force of cohesion in the ideologically and sociologically heterogeneous movement. That Hitler was an arbiter rather than a participant in the conflict was also reflected in the way in which he dealt with the members of the northern faction after the Bamberg meeting—not as a victor, but as the benevolent judge. He did not punish them, but continued to keep them in positions of authority and power. Indeed, there would have been no reason to punish men who, though misguided, acted in good faith. Thus the unity of the movement was preserved; the leaders retained their positions of authority while the rank-and-file remained basically unaffected by the whole crisis. For the ordinary party member or fol¬ lower there was no crisis of conscience; those who were loyal followers of the northern leaders never assumed any conflict between these leaders and Hitler. They followed the northern orientation because they thought that they were following Hitler. There was no reason for Hitler to doubt the loyalty of the rank-and-file, and there is no evidence that he did. The Bamberg conference did not necessitate mass purges; the rankand-file membership was hardly affected by that leaders’ conference. Why, then, was the Bamberg conference necessary? Why did Hitler consider it imperative to intervene when there were no threats to his leadership? In the absence of relevant data, the answers to these ques¬ tions will have to remain conjectural. It may be plausible to suggest that while Hitler realized the fundamental loyalty of the northerners to his person, he may have felt instinctively that what the northerners at¬ tempted to do was ultimately incompatible with the nature of his move¬ ment. The attempt to define National Socialism programmatically would have challenged the charismatic nature of its legitimacy and ipso facto Hitler’s absolute leadership. The ideology of a charismatic movement has to remain sufficiently vague so as not to become the basis of legiti¬ macy. The attempt at Hannover to draw up a program was a step to make the movement an ideological one. This is what Hitler could not tolerate and that is what made the Bamberg conference necessary.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. The term \"faction” is used here as a group of individuals joined together to further some particular goal in opposition to other groups belonging to the same association. \"Faction” implies a certain degree of permanence resting on some\n\n40\n\nNAZISM AND THE THIRD REICH\n\norganizational basis which tends to lend it a degree of independence and power as well. Finally, \"faction” also tends to involve some basic issue, thereby calling into question the purpose of the group as a whole. This definition serves to dis¬ tinguish factional conflicts from other kinds of intragroup disagreements which are personal in character and involve issues of no more consequence than the status of a particular individual in the association. 2. Although the Kampfverlag was the creation of the Northern Faction and also served to perpetuate some of the ideas and aspirations of the northern leaders of 1925-1926, it constituted a separate experience in the history of the move¬ ment and will be, therefore, excluded from this analysis. 3. The obsolescence of \"putschist” tactics had already been pointed out by Feder in August 1923. In his letter to Hitler of August 10, he urged Hitler to pay greater attention to organizational matters. \"The times of the condottieri have passed,” he warned (Oron James Hale, \"Gottfried Feder Calls Hitler to Order. An Unpublished Letter on Nazi Party Affairs,” Journal of Modern His¬ tory, xxx [1958], 359). 4. Wolfgang Schaefer, NSDAP.

The party correspondence provides ample evidence for this. See, for in¬ stance, the letter of the district leader of Lueneburg-Stade to Bouhler, May 15, 1925 (ibid., Reel 21). 7. See Hitler’s \"Aufruf an die alten Parteigenossen der NSDAP,” and \"Grundsatzliche Richtlinien fur die Wiederbegriindung der NSDAP,” Volkischer Beobachter, February 26, 1925. 8. Hitler’s tactics toward the dissident local party leaders varied according to the local circumstances. Some he dismissed outright by dissolving their local organizations; in other instances he merged several local organizations and thereby forced the dissident leaders to bow to the will of the majority of their followers. See, for example, the Wiirttemberg case in the Bavarian police reports, Stanford, Hoover Library, Documents from the NSDAP Hauptarchiv, Reel 70, Folder 1515 (hereafter cited as Hoover Microfilm Collection)-, and the Cologne district reports in Berlin Document Center, Reel 21. 9- See Professor Mergenthaler’s capitulation to Hitler in June 1927 (Hoover Microfilm Collection, Reel 70, Folder 1515). 10.

Ideologically, National Socialism in Bavaria remained basically a lowermiddle-class affair closely allied with the forces of the Right. The typical concerns of Bavarian local party meetings in the 1920’s were the Jews, interna¬ tional capital, and religion.
