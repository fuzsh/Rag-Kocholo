        "text": "1984\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian books set in Britain.\n\nBy James Marshall Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve loved reading alternative visions of Britain since I read a Strontium Dog saga in ‘2000AD’ as a boy. What was science fiction then has become closer to reality now. The idea of one event, such as a meteor shower in Triffids or a virus in ‘Grass,’ causing havoc worldwide is gripping. I prefer the British stories because they are closer to home. Many of these were written close to the Second World War, and their authors describe deprivation in unflinching detail. Recent political events have turned my mind to how human actions can cause dystopian futures, as in Orwell’s 1984.\n\nJames' book list on dystopian books set in Britain\n\nWhy did James love this book?\n\nOrwell is another of my favorite writers; his essays are essential reading. This novel is the culmination of his efforts, and the prose is fantastic: simple, clear, and effective. It is a delight to read and yet hard to write.\n\nI admire how he does it. The plot is now famous, and, unfortunately, much of what he has written has come to pass. I found it hard to read again without all the public connotations invading my thoughts, but I did lose myself in the plot.\n\nBy George Orwell,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n47 authors picked 1984 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU . . .\n\n1984 is the year in which it happens. The world is divided into three superstates. In Oceania, the Party's power is absolute. Every action, word, gesture and thought is monitored under the watchful eye of Big Brother and the Thought Police. In the Ministry of Truth, the Party's department for propaganda, Winston Smith's job is to edit the past. Over time, the impulse to escape the machine and live independently takes hold of him and he embarks on a secret and forbidden love affair. As he writes the words 'DOWN WITH BIG…\n\nPreview\n\nMarch Violets\n\nBy Philip Kerr,\n\nFrom my list on portray a sense of place.\n\nBy AJ Davidson Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI believe many writers suspect they are Strangers in a Strange Land. How ironic that I, a confirmed atheist, should use a biblical quote to describe the mindset of authors. Some discover where they belong through their writing. My book recommendations have a strong sense of place, whether it be the Old West, wartime Berlin, or modern-day Scotland. I was born into a 300-year-old N. Ireland Protestant Plantation family, yet many people saw us as interlopers: we weren’t quite Irish, and we weren’t quite British, yet we held dual passports. It was not until I left Ireland that I realized my Irish Heritage exerted a stronger pull than my British.\n\nAJ's book list on portray a sense of place\n\nWhy did AJ love this book?\n\nOne of the best explanations I’ve read of the rise of Fascism in Hitler’s Germany. I agree that ignoring the lessons of history means we’ll be forced to endure repetition. And Kerr paints such a chilling scenario no one in their right mind would wish the maxim to come true. His prose applies color and form like an artist at the top of their game.\n\nAt times I found him reminiscent of Chandler in the way he portrays the Nazis as the worst gangsters in the game. This is the first book of the Bernard Gunther series, and I was so enthralled that I raced through the others in just a few days. His storyline is filled with horror, passion, fear, and pathos—a tour de force of emotions.\n\nBy Philip Kerr,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked March Violets as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDiscover the first crime novel in the late Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series - Berlin Noir - set in Hitler's Germany during the 1930s . . .\n\nWinter, 1936. A man and his wife shot dead in their bed, their home burned.

It fuelled my interest in history, especially about the reasons for the rise of the Nazis. History has many lessons to teach–if we are willing to listen–and one of the great teachers is Germany between the wars. It was a time of extremes: economic crises, social unrest, much of which was caused by the Nazis, and a flourishing bohemian, liberal culture. This febrile environment in which characters struggle with their personal conflict makes for great story-telling potential.\n\nNeil's book list on Germany between the world wars\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nOne of Rory Clements’ many writing skills is the ability to create tension and explore an angle of an historical event.\n\nIt’s London 1936, and the king is about to abdicate. A woman is murdered in Berlin, and a fascist-leaning couple in Britain are killed. I liked how Clements joins these seemingly separate tragedies into a memorable story. I liked his hero, an academic drawn into the world of spying, Professor Tom Wilde.\n\nI think a great novel's elements are believable characters, forensic attention to detail, and terrific tension, and they are all here.\n\nBy Rory Clements,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Corpus as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA gripping spy thriller for fans of ROBERT HARRIS and WILLIAM BOYD from award-winning Sunday Times bestseller Rory Clements and author of the 2018 CWA HISTORICAL DAGGER WINNER, NUCLEUS\n\n1936. Europe is in turmoil. The Nazis have marched into the Rhineland. In Russia, Stalin has unleashed his Great Terror. Spain has erupted in civil war.\n\nIn Berlin, a young Englishwoman evades the Gestapo to deliver vital papers to a Jewish scientist. Within weeks, she is found dead, a silver syringe clutched in her fingers.\n\nIn an exclusive London club, a conspiracy is launched that threatens the very heart of government.…\n\nPreview\n\nFortunes of War\n\nBy Olivia Manning,\n\nFrom my list on WW2 books that will inform and inspire.\n\nBy Debbie Rix Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy parents both fought in the Second World War – my father as a bomber pilot, my mother as a Wren. Dad often entertained us at family mealtimes with tales of his wartime adventures – of how was shot down over Germany, captured, imprisoned, but finally escaped. My interest in the period grew from there, and my first ‘wartime’ novel The Secret Letter was in fact largely based on my parents experiences. Since then, I have become increasingly fascinated by the period, with now a total of four novels set in WW2, culminating in my present book The German Mother.\n\nDebbie's book list on WW2 books that will inform and inspire\n\nWhy did Debbie love this book?\n\nA set of six novels that follow the fortunes of Harriet and Guy Pringle, set during the chaos of World War Two in Europe.\n\nGuy teaches English at the University of Bucharest, and the novel opens with him bringing his new wife to join him in Romania. Manning combines an intimate story of the couple’s relationship with an epic tale of war-torn Europe and the Middle East. Her descriptions of places are brilliantly done; her dialogue is perfect, and she effortlessly portrays significant moments in history.\n\nI learned so much when I read it, and yet never felt I was being ‘taught’; in other words it’s the gold standard of historical fiction.\n\nBy Olivia Manning,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Fortunes of War as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSet under the gathering storm that is the Second World War in Romania, The Great Fortune is the first action-packed, romantic and fascinating book of The Balkan Trilogy.\n\nGuy and Harriet Pringle marry after a six month courtship. Still getting to know each other, they arrive in Bucharest, where Guy is employed in the English Department of the University of Bucharest.\n\nOver the following years Guy builds an eclectic network of friends and acquaintances. These charismatic contacts include his work colleague Clarence, his boss Lord Inchcape, the eccentric Prince Yakimov and Sophie, a local Romanian beauty. Harriet appears tough, but…\n\nPreview\n\nGoebbels\n\nBy Peter Longerich, Alan Bance (translator), Jeremy Noakes (translator) , Lesley Sharpe (translator)\n\nFrom my list on WW2 books that will inform and inspire.\n\nBy Debbie Rix Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy parents both fought in the Second World War – my father as a bomber pilot, my mother as a Wren. Dad often entertained us at family mealtimes with tales of his wartime adventures – of how was shot down over Germany, captured, imprisoned, but finally escaped. My interest in the period grew from there, and my first ‘wartime’ novel The Secret Letter was in fact largely based on my parents experiences. Since then, I have become increasingly fascinated by the period, with now a total of four novels set in WW2, culminating in my present book The German Mother.\n\nDebbie's book list on WW2 books that will inform and inspire\n\nWhy did Debbie love this book?\n\nJoseph Goebbels was the Minister for Propaganda in Hitler’s Nazi Germany, and is one of the central characters in my latest novel. I recommend Longerich’s biography of this complex man in its own right, and not just because I plundered it for information when writing my novel.\n\nScholarly but written in a lively style, the book will appeal to anyone interested in what made the ‘master of the dark arts of propaganda’ tick. Drawing heavily on Goebbels’ own diaries (which run to an astonishing twenty-nine volumes), Longerich has written the definitive history of this complex and fascinating man, who was so attracted to Nazi ideology that he ultimately lost his soul to evil.\n\nBy Peter Longerich, Alan Bance (translator), Jeremy Noakes (translator) , Lesley Sharpe (translator)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Goebbels as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nJoseph Goebbels was one of Adolf Hitler's most loyal acolytes. But how did this club-footed son of a factory worker rise from obscurity to become Hitler's malevolent minister of propaganda, most trusted lieutenant and personally anointed successor?\n\nIn this definitive one-volume biography, renowned German Holocaust historian Peter Longerich sifts through the historical record - and thirty thousand pages of Goebbels's own diary entries - to answer that question. Longerich paints a chilling picture of a man driven by a narcissistic desire for recognition who found the personal affirmation he craved within the virulently racist National Socialist movement - and whose…\n\nPreview\n\nA Bridge of Children's Books\n\nBy Jella Lepman,\n\nFrom my list on WW2 books that will inform and inspire.\n\nBy Debbie Rix Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy parents both fought in the Second World War – my father as a bomber pilot, my mother as a Wren.

As I read, I became fascinated by this account of a brave Jewish journalist who managed to escape from Germany in the mid-1930s, and move to London where she worked for the BBC’s German service. At war’s end, she returned to her homeland, where she was employed by the US Army to help with the “de-Nazification” of German women and children to try and restore a sense of decency and democratic ideals among her compatriots. It’s an extraordinary account of one woman’s bravery and served as inspiration for one of my central characters in “The German Mother”.\n\nBy Jella Lepman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Bridge of Children's Books as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe remarkable story of Jella Lepman, who, having left Germany to escape the Nazi regime in the 1930s, chose to return in the aftermath of the Second World War, as 'Adviser on the Cultural and Educational Needs of Women and Children in the American Zone'. She soon decided that what Germany's war-ravaged children needed was to see a world of the imagination, beyond their landscape of bombed-out buildings and military vehicles.\n\nBattling with bureaucracy and meeting with generals and statesmen, including Eleanor Roosevelt, she founded the International Youth Library, filling a huge void in the lives of Germany's children with…\n\nPreview\n\nHitler's Thirty Days to Power\n\nBy Henry Ashby Turner,\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nHitler’s rise to power was not inevitable. That’s the key point of this excellent, detailed account of the days leading to President Hindenburg’s appointment of Hitler to the chancellorship of Germany.\n\nI liked Ashby Turner’s novel-like writing style and his high standard of scholarship. He writes about the wheeling and dealing, the tension of the history-changing event, and the internal conflicts of some of the key actors.\n\nIt’s one of the best nonfiction books about the Weimar period I have read.\n\nBy Henry Ashby Turner,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hitler's Thirty Days to Power as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn Hitler's Thirty Days to Power, distinguished Yale historian Henry Ashby Turner makes an important and influential addition to his life-long study of Nazi Germany. Providing vivid portraits of the main players of the drama of January 1933, and using newly available documents, Turner masterfully recreates the bewildering circumstances surrounding Hitler's unexpected appointment as chancellor of Germany. The result is a work that Booklist calls \"first rate ...a gripping, foreboding narrative.\"\n\nPreview\n\nBlack Roses\n\nBy Jane Thynne,\n\nWhy did Neil love this book?\n\nA book that takes me into the hallowed halls of Nazi power is an immediate drawcard for me. And with a brave and determined woman protagonist who overcomes the odds, this book didn’t disappoint. Jane Thynne’s angle of exploring the lives of the wives of the leading Nazis is new, different, and works well.\n\nClara Vine has left Britain in less than happy circumstances and goes to Berlin, where she gets a job as an actor at the famous Ufa studios. After a chance meeting, she becomes part of the Nazi wives’ social circle. When Magda Goebbels discloses a life-threatening secret and asks Clara for her help, the tension is on.\n\nBy Jane Thynne,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Black Roses as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBerlin, 1933\n\nWarning bells ring across Europe as Hitler comes to power\n\nClara Vine is young and ambitious, and determined to succeed as an actress.

Leo sees in Clara the perfect recruit to spy on her new acquaintances, using her acting skills to win their confidence.\n\nBut when Magda Goebbels reveals to Clara a dramatic secret and entrusts…\n\nPreview\n\nEmbassies in Crisis\n\nBy Rogelia Pastor-Castro (editor), Martin Thomas (editor),\n\nWhy did Lorena love this book?\n\nWhen one thinks of diplomats and what they do, one often conjures up scenes of fancy cocktail parties and elegant dinners–and understandably so. It is exactly for this reason that I will never forget how Jane Marriott recalled what it felt like, during her time as British Ambassador to Yemen, to sit inside an embassy that was under attack.\n\nShe shared this and other stories during a workshop held at the British Academy in London, where both academics and practitioners were involved. This is a recommended volume for all those interested in how embassies work in times of crisis.\n\nBy Rogelia Pastor-Castro (editor), Martin Thomas (editor),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Embassies in Crisis as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nEmbassies are integral to international diplomacy, their staff instrumental to inter-governmental dialogue, strategic partnerships, trading relationships and cultural exchange. But Embassies are also discreet political spaces. Notionally sovereign territory 'immune' from local jurisdiction, in moments of crisis Embassies have often been targets of protest and sites of confrontation. It is this aspect of Embassy experience that this collection of essays explores and Embassies in Crisis revisits flashpoints in the recent lives of Embassies overseas at times of acute political crisis.\n\nRanging across multiple British and other embassy crises, unusually, this book offers equal insights to international historians and members of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Ambassadors\n\nBy Paul Richter,\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nRichter recounts the stories of four extraordinary professional diplomats who served post 9/11 and are role models for the diplomats of the future. Anne Patterson, U.S. ambassador in Egypt and Pakistan, worked for me briefly in Washington and Riyadh. I crossed paths with Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador in Iraq and Afghanistan, many times in Washington, Baghdad, and elsewhere. I met Chris Stevens once before he became U.S. ambassador in Libya. The political exploitation of his death was outrageous. I didn’t know Robert Ford, who resigned in frustration over U.S. policy toward Syria. They were sent to dangerous and unstable places. Diplomacy can be risky. They had to work closely were their military counterparts. They experienced the frustration of advising Washington politicians who lack both understanding and a willingness to listen.\n\nBy Paul Richter,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Ambassadors as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nVeteran diplomatic correspondent Paul Richter goes behind the battles and the headlines to show how American ambassadors are the unconventional warriors in the Muslim world-running local government, directing drone strikes, building nations, and risking their lives on the front lines.\n\nThe tale's heroes are a small circle of top career diplomats who have been an unheralded but crucial line of national defense in the past two decades of wars in the greater Middle East. In The Ambassadors, Paul Richter shares the astonishing, true-life stories of four expeditionary diplomats who \"do the hardest things in the hardest places.\"\n\nThe book describes…\n\nPreview"
