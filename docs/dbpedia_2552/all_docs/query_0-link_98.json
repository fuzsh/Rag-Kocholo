Rosenberg was also perhaps the most vociferous purveyor of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Joachim C. Fest, The Face of the Third Reich: Portraits of the Nazi Leadership (Boston: Da Capo, 1999), pp. 163–74. Rosenberg’s Myth provoked Cardinal Clemens von Galen to write a closely argued pamphlet against the book that was widely disseminated in Germany.
