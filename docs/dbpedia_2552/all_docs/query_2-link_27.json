        "text": "Geoffrey G. Field, who teaches at the State University of New York's College at Purchase, is the author of ''Evangelist of Race: The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain.'' GERMAN BIG BUSINESS AND THE RISE OF HITLER\n\nBy Henry Ashby Turner Jr. 504 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $25.\n\nDid German big business finance Nazism, undermine the Weimar Republic and bring Hitler to power in January 1933? At the outset of ''German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler,'' Henry Ashby Turner Jr. poses these questions, which are already the subject of an extensive historical literature. His answer is: ''a great deal less than has generally been believed.'' His meticulous research into recently opened corporate archives provides a fascinating, disturbing picture of the concerns and priorities of business leaders in the last, turbulent years of Weimar. By ''big business'' Mr. Turner means roughly the 50 leading corporations in coal, iron and steel, insurance, banking, chemicals and electrical equipment. These giant enterprises survived remarkably unscathed from Germany's defeat in World War I and the revolution that followed. Left-wing demands for socialization met no success; the trade unions, at least initially, proved cooperative; and many businesses emerged from the hyperinflation of the early 1920's enlarged and rationalized. Corporate leaders like the Ruhr industrialist Paul Reusch were able to adjust to democratic politics; they propagated their views through a dense network of business groups they belonged to, newspapers they owned and political parties they subsidized.\n\nWith few exceptions, they accepted the republic only grudgingly, for despite the gains they had made, the new era seemed economically precarious and politically frustrating. As Mr. Turner indicates, to the industrialists the effort to translate money into influence often seemed to yield meager results in an era when other competing interest groups commanded disciplined blocs of voters. By 1929 the trend toward shorter hours, higher wages and the expansion of social welfare produced a ''new militancy'' in the ranks of big business. But the author rejects the view that they began a concerted campaign of opposition to the republic.\n\nWhile it is clear that industrialists poured large sums of money into the counterrevolutionary Free Corps in the early days of Weimar and also contributed heavily to a range of bourgeois parties, there has been considerable disagreement about the scale of their assistance to Nazism. Here Mr. Turner is at his best, providing by far the most comprehensive account to date of the personal contacts and financial relationships between big-business executives and the Hitler movement. His patient and intensive scrutiny of archival sources makes it clear that the National Socialist Party's success in gaining converts and funds in the business community was much less than was once commonly assumed. Before September 1930, when the Nazis made a spectacular advance in the national elections, little financial support flowed to the party from the big- business community and very few executives associated themselves with it.\n\nEVEN after the Nazis' establishment of a large electoral base forced the economic elite to take them seriously, few industrialists publicly sided with them. And those who did - like the coal and steel magnates Emil Kirdorf and Fritz Thyssen or the former Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht - were unrepresentative and failed to dispel the serious reservations of the rest. To most of the leading executives, Nazism remained suspect because of its strident anticapitalist rhetoric and the socialistic programs advanced by its left wing. Its demagoguery and brutal racism were distasteful, but the ambiguity of its economic goals was the crucial obstacle on which efforts to achieve a dialogue between businessmen and party leaders foundered. Attempts by Hitler and G\"oring to allay these fears came to nothing, especially since Nazi delegates in the Reichstag promoted a range of radical legislation and the party's cell organizations in factories actively sided with a number of strikes.\n\nMuch of the money business leaders contributed was given to ''moderate'' or ''reasonable'' Nazis like G\"oring as a way of enhancing the moderates' position within the movement and in consequence a good deal of it simply fed the personal extravagance of these men. Every political gain by the Nazis produced new flirtations between them and corporate leaders, and the flow of money certainly increased, reaching ''a high water mark'' in the spring and summer of 1932. But these funds, Mr. Turner argues, should be seen as political ''insurance premiums'' bestowed on a party that might soon achieve power rather than evidence of a corporate desire to boost it into office. During the same period, industrial largesse was extended in still larger amounts to other parties.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
