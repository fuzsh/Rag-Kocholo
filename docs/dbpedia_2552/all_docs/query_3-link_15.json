After he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 parliamentary democracy came to an end. A timeline of these events in Germany can be found here.\n\nBefore the outbreak of the Second World War, in the period 1935-38, Hitler acted against the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by re-arming and re-building the German army through conscription (1935). He also moved troops into the di-militarised Rhineland (1936). He also tried to unite Germany and Austria with the ‘Anschluss’ (1938). Later that year he demanded the Sudetenland, the German speaking part of Czechoslovakia. Throughout this time he made passionate speeches about expanding German territory. These words and deeds worried foreign observers.\n\nUse the sources in this lesson to find out how he was viewed by some of these commentators. Was he to be regarded as a ‘passionate lunatic’ who would take over Europe? Or an odd eccentric who was rebuilding Germany?\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\nWhen Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 some people regarded him as a strong leader merely getting back German territory and restoring Germany’s national pride. They thought he would stop once he had reversed the terms the Treaty of Versailles which limited the power and strength of Germany. Others feared that this was only the beginning of a far more aggressive foreign policy. They were to be proved right by Hitler’s decision to takeover of the whole of Czechoslovakia in 1939 after annexing the Sudetenland in 1938. Germany then invaded Poland, bringing about the beginning of the Second World War.\n\nHow the British government dealt with Hitler in the run up to the outbreak of the Second World War has come under close scrutiny. Of course at the time, Winston Churchill, no longer in Government from the early 1930s, was a significant critic of the Munich Agreement which allowed Germany to take over Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia an attempt to prevent a war. Churchill continued to criticize Hitler and call for Britain to rearm. When war was declared with Germany in 1939 he returned to power as First Lord of the Admiralty and later became wartime Prime Minister of a national government on 10 May 1940.\n\nAppeasement was the name given to Britain’s policy in the 1930s which permitted Hitler to expand German territory unchecked and did little to stop him in his early moves against the Treaty of Versailles. It was closely linked to the Prime Minister at the time, Neville Chamberlain and was popular although is now regarded as a policy of weakness.\n\nAppeasement found support with the British public who wanted to avoid the huge losses of the First World War. There was a strong anti-war or pacifist sentiment. Britain could not afford the financial cost of another war, nor could France, the country’s main ally.\n\nOf course to have stopped Hitler might have meant declaring war – a massive decision when most countries wanted to avoid war at all costs. Britain kept a close watch on developments in Germany. In particular the government was very interested in Hitler’s personality. They wanted to find out what he was like, what he wanted to achieve for Germany, what kind of leader he was and, strangely enough, if he was sane.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThe purpose of this lesson is to encourage students to handle conflicting evidence on the character and personality of Hitler and assess their reliability. The first source is an extract from a report by Mr. Law, a British businessman, who worked in Germany provided to the Foreign Office. The second is an extract from an account given by Johann Heinrich Count von Bernstorff, a founding member of the German Democratic Party and a supporter of the League of Nations. He left Germany in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. Both sources present a very unfavourable view of Hitler.\n\nStudents later examine a drawing which presents him differently. Why is this the case? The final source offers yet another angle. It is a short description of Hitler prepared by the British Embassy in Berlin. Students are required to contrast this to the earlier sources and consider what factors make a ‘reliable’ source. Does this impact on the value of a source or not?\n\nAll sources are provided with transcripts. Students could work on the sources individually or pairs and report back to the group with their findings.\n\nThe lesson can also be used as an introduction to a wider enquiry into appeasement and the decisions made by the British Government and others before the outbreak of the war in 1939. Students could use the background notes as a starting point for researching the wider context of appeasement and follow up by attempting the linked lessons on the German re-occupation of the Rhineland and Chamberlain and the Munich Crisis in Related Resources.\n\nSources\n\nIllustration : INF 2/31 Hitler caught between British and Russian military might\n\nSource 1 – FO371/20733 Report by Mr Law, a British businessman who worked in Germany (1937)\n\nSource 2 – FO371/20733 Report on a conversation with Count Bernstorff (1937)\n\nSource 3 – INF 3/1298: Drawing by Richard Ziegler entitled “Unhappy-looking uniformed Hitler”, 1944-1945.\n\nSource 4 – FO 408/67 A short description of Hitler prepared by the British Embassy in Berlin (January 1937)\n\nExternal links\n\nQuiz yourself on Adolf Hitler\n\nHow much do you know about Adolf Hitler and the rise of Nazism in Germany?\n\nPre-war Nazi Germany and the Beginnings of the Holocaust\n\nIllustrated timeline of events from United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n\nAdolf Hitler: Man and monster\n\nBBC history of Nazi Germany.\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nKey stage 3\n\nChallenges for Britain, Europe and the wider world 1901 to the present day: the inter-war years: the Great Depression and the rise of dictators\n\nKey stage 4\n\nAQA GCSE History: Germany, 1890–1945: Democracy and dictatorship\n\nEdexcel GCSE History: c1900–present: Warfare and British society in modern era\n\nOCR GCSE History: War and British Society c.790 to c.2010; attitudes and responses to war\n\nBack to top"
