Most know he was the dictator of Germany who caused the Second World War and the slaughter of millions ofjews. But how Hitler got\n\npower is another matter. Few understand the way in which his dic¬ tatorship came about. Because Germany was a republic when Hitler became chancellor, many assume that he was democratically elected by a majority of the German people. Such was not, however, the case. His rise to power was far more complicated and, above all, more chancy. It was, in fact, a very near thing that could have been thwarted at numerous points. Much of Hitler’s story has been ably recounted in previous books, but no one has yet subjected to thorough scrutiny the dramatic events of the crucial month of January 1933, at the end of which Hitler became head of the German government. To tell that story is the task of this book.\n\nthis work has benefited greatly from the generous help of others, for which I am very grateful. William Sheridan Allen, Peter Gay, Richard F. Hamilton, and Peter Hayes read drafts of the manuscript and provided valuable suggestions. In addition to commenting on the manuscript, William L. Patch, Jr., shared with me relevant documents from his own research, as did Larry Eugene Jones and Hagen Schulze. xi\n\nPreface\n\nPertti Ahonen obtained copies of other useful evidence for me. Renate Kohne-Lindenlaub spared me thousands of miles of travel by providing me with a copy of a document from the Krupp archive. Mary E. Sarotte helped me to obtain some of the photographs. George O. Kent and Mary R. Habeck provided invaluable assistance in locat¬ ing and obtaining a copy of the “Moscow Document” described in the Appendix. My editor, Henning P. Gutmann, provided unwaver¬ ing encouragement as well as helpful guidance, and Lynne Reed faithfully shepherded the manuscript into print.\n\nx 11\n\nHITLER'S THIRTY\n\nTO\n\nDAYS\n\nPOWER\n\n1 PROLOGUE:\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\nO\n\nN\n\nTHE\n\nFIRST\n\nDAY\n\nof 1933, a chorus of relief and\n\nrejoicing arose from defenders of Germany’s beleaguered Weimar Republic. For three years the young state had been\n\nsubjected to mounting assault by antidemocratic forces, the strongest and most threatening being Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist Party. Now the tide appeared to have turned. “The mighty Nazi assault on the democratic state has been repulsed,” proclaimed the New Year’s editorial of the prestigious Frankfurter Zeitung. “The republic has been rescued,” announced a staff writer for the Vossische Zeitung, a vener¬ able Berlin daily. Vorwarts, the newspaper of the Social Democrats, the party most responsible for the republic’s creation fourteen years ear¬ lier, headlined its editorial “Hitler’s Rise and Fall.” A major Catholic paper in Cologne, the Kolnische Volkszeitung, pointed out that whereas its prediction a year earlier that Hitler would never get power had seemed daring at the time, that view had now become commonplace. Ruminating about what to tell future grandchildren about his own 1\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\ntimes, a writer for the Berliner Tageblatt suggested: “Everywhere, throughout the whole world people were talking about—what was his first name?—Adalbert Hitler. Later? Vanished!” In light of the knowledge that Hitler would be legally installed as German chancellor within less than a month, these expressions of republican optimism look in retrospect like a collective delusion. Yet an examination of what had gone before reveals that the hopefulness of Nazism’s opponents was at the time by no means unfounded.\n\nTHROUGHOUT its turbulent fourteen years, the first German\n\nrepublic, founded in the city of Weimar in 1919, had to struggle against heavy handicaps. From the start, millions of Germans despised it. Extreme leftists rejected it as a mere bourgeois democracy and called for its overthrow by a proletarian revolution. On the Right, die-hard monarchists regarded as treason the revolution, in the wake of Germany’s defeat in the First World War, that overthrew the Hohenzollern dynasty of Prussia, under which the country had been united into the Empire created in 1871. Along with other enemies of democracy, they denounced as un-German a republic whose institu¬ tions had been created by a national assembly freely elected on the basis of universal suffrage. The militarists who had led the country into the war added to the republic’s foes by falsely claiming that the army had not been defeated in the field but had instead been struck down by a ‘stab in the back’ on the home front by the politicians who estab¬ lished the republic. The new regime thus bore for many Germans the stigma of treason and national humiliation. The victorious Western democracies further heightened the Weimar Republic’s unpopularity by forcing it to accept a punitive peace settlement. The Versailles Treaty severed sizable portions of Germany’s prewar territory, saddled the country with sole guilt for causing the war, made the republic liable for heavy reparations to the victors, and restricted its sovereignty in numerous ways, including tight limitations on its military forces. It was a tribute to Germany’s republicans that the new govern¬ ment survived its early years despite these liabilities, as well as a 2\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General hyperinflation that destroyed the currency, attempts at forcible over¬ throw by extremists of both Right and Left, and occupation of parts of the country by the victorious powers of World War I. By the middle of the ’20s democracy seemed to have taken root in Germany, and the country enjoyed a half-decade of something approaching stability and prosperity. But with the onset of the Great Depression, which struck the German economy harder than that of any other European coun¬ try, the Weimar Republic fell upon hard times. In 1930 parliamentary rule ceased to function when the moderate political parties deadlocked over how to finance unemployment benefits for the growing legions of jobless Germans. As a consequence of that crisis, decisive political power shifted from the parliament to the presidency, with the result that the republic no longer functioned as intended by its founders. The president in whose hands great power now became concen¬ trated was Paul von Hindenburg, who as field marshal had com¬ manded the German army during the First World War. Elected in 1925, he was reelected to a second seven-year term in 1932 at the age of eighty-five. A legendary figure because of his wartime role, the venerable Hindenburg personified for millions of Germans some of the proudest chapters of their country’s past. He was a Junker, a descendant of one of the aristocratic families that had settled Ger¬ many’s eastern frontier regions centuries earlier. As a young officer in the Prussian army he participated in the wars of unification and was present at the proclamation of the Empire in 1871. Having retired in 1911 after an unexceptional career as an officer, he was recalled to service at the outbreak of war three years later. When the forces under his command halted the advance of Russian forces into German territory, he quickly became a national hero, even though the extent of his personal contribution to that victory was exaggerated for pur¬ poses of propaganda on the home front. Later elevated to supreme commander of the army, he managed to emerge from the German defeat in the war with his heroic status intact, in considerable measure by virtue of the stab-in-the-back legend, which he himself played a key role in propagating. 3\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nTall and robust, Hindenburg was an imposing figure. Well into his ninth decade he retained the ramrod bearing of a Prussian officer. Courtly and gracious in manner, he evoked nostalgia for the previous century. His broad, square visage, crowned by a close-cropped mili¬ tary haircut and punctuated by a long, wispy mustache, seemed frozen in an expression of pensive sadness. For many Germans this visage conveyed profound gravity and resolute devotion to arduous duties. Although his public image was one of imperturbable strength, Hindenburg lacked a strong, independent will and seldom took initiatives on his own. Throughout his career, he depended heavily upon the advice of those around him, a trait that became more pronounced with advancing age. Contrary to his stolid appearance, Hindenburg was subject, at moments of stress, to outbursts of emotion that caused his voice to falter and sent tears coursing down his cheeks. He tended to see political relationships in terms of comradeship and professed to value loyalty above all else, even though throughout his life he repeatedly turned his back on associates who had faithfully served him. Having no intellectual interests outside of military affairs, he rarely held more than simplistic views on other matters, including politics. But despite per¬ sistent rumors of senility, all reliable accounts indicate that, although ponderous and slow, Hindenburg remained lucid until the final illness that ended his life near the close of his eighty-seventh year in 1934, well after Hitler’s dictatorial rule had reduced him to a figurehead. To the very end, Hindenburg’s sheer physical bulk, his aloof dignity, and the living link he provided to past glories imbued him with an aura that awed most contemporaries. As head of state, President von Hindenburg occupied a position at first sight similar to that of the crowned heads of Europe’s parlia¬ mentary monarchies, but the republic’s constitution bestowed upon his office far greater powers than those of the remaining monarchs. The president exercised ultimate authority over the armed forces and had at his disposal sweeping emergency powers that authorized him to curtail civil rights and enact laws by decree if he thought such measures\n\n4\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General necessary. Only the president could appoint the head of government, the chancellor, and the other ministers who made up the cabinet. As in other European democracies, the chancellor was required to retain the support of a majority of the national parliament, the Reichstag, and had to resign in the event of a majority vote of no confidence. The president could, however, at any time dismiss the chancellor and cabinet; he could also dissolve the Reichstag prior to expiration of its normal four-year term and schedule a new election. As the events of January 1933 would demonstrate, these powers made the president the crucial figure in a time of political instability and put him in a position to exercise a decisive influence on the course of events. Initially elected as the candidate of conservative and reactionary rightists, Hindenburg for a time pleasantly surprised defenders of the republic, although he never renounced his monarchist sentiments. For five years he dutifully presided over the republic in the manner of a constitutional head of state. He appointed chancellors and cabi¬ nets either nominated by majority coalitions of parties or acceptable to a majority when coalitions failed to form. But the old field marshal became increasingly impatient with the recurrent bargains and mach¬ inations among the parties, which produced a shifting succession of seventeen cabinets under nine different chancellors during the repub¬ lic’s first eleven years. He was particularly displeased by resistance to military expenditures on the part of the largest republican party, the left-of-center Social Democrats, whose ranks included many paci¬ fists. His deeply conservative outlook was also offended by the Social Democrats’ lip service to the Marxist ideology of their past, which they had in practice long since put aside in favor of pragmatic reformism. When the political deadlock of 1930 brought down a Social Democrat-led cabinet and left the Reichstag incapable of agreeing on a replacement, the group of high army officers who served as Hindenburg’s closest advisers prevailed upon him to break with the parliamentary system and exclude the Left from positions of author¬ ity. With the proclaimed goal of elevating the government above\n\n5\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\npolitics, Hindenburg began the practice of appointing chancellors of his personal choice who were not beholden to parliamentary major¬ ities. He thus initiated what came to be known as a system of government by presidential cabinets. To enable the chancellors who presided over those cabinets to circumvent the Reichstag’s legislative authority, he placed at their disposal the sweeping emergency powers conferred on the presidency by the Weimar constitution. Beginning in 1930, virtually all national laws—including those authorizing taxes and government appropriations—were enacted not by parliamentary action but rather by presidential decrees issued at the request of chancellor and cabinet. The president’s authority was not absolute. By majority vote, the Reichstag could rescind his emergency decrees or pass a vote of no confidence against the chancellor and his cabinet. But to discourage such assertions of parliamentary prerogatives, the presi¬ dent could arm the chancellor with a decree dissolving the Reichstag, thus forcing the political parties to face the voters in a new national election. The first of the presidential chancellors was Heinrich Briining, a respected parliamentarian of the Catholic Center Party, which had been one of the bulwarks of republican cabinets. For two years, beginning in May 1930, Briining governed with the acquiescence of the staunchly republican Social Democrats, who had been excluded from his cabinet. Fearing that opposition to Briining would lead to a more rightist cabinet, their party refrained from no-confidence votes and left unchallenged the presidential decrees with which the chancel¬ lor governed. The Social Democrats thus linked their fortunes to Briining’s. This had unfortunate consequences for the republican cause, since the chancellor’s deflationary fiscal policies aggravated the effects of the unusually severe and sustained depression. By early 1932 more than one in three wage earners was jobless, and Briining had become the ‘hunger chancellor’ for millions of Germans. In the spring of that year Briining played a major role in Hindenburg’s reelection campaign and brought to the verge of success negotiations for an end to Germany’s reparation payments to the victorious powers of World 6\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\nWar I. Nevertheless, prodded by conservative advisers, the president had become dissatisfied with the chancellor’s unwillingness to bypass the Social Democrats in favor of rightist support. At the end of May 1932 Hindenburg curtly dismissed Briining. Instrumental in bringing about Briining’s fall was the man who by the spring of 1932 had become the president’s closest adviser, General Kurt von Schleicher. A member of the minor nobility of western Germany rather than of the Junker aristocracy of the East that predominated in the upper echelons of the officer corps, Schleicher had nevertheless enjoyed a rapid rise as a career officer. Admitted at an early age to the army’s elite brain trust, the General Staff, he spent most of World War I dealing with problems of supply and transportation that brought him into contact with civilian authorities. After the war he was pressed into service by the Defense Ministry as the army’s liaison with the republican government. Since the essentially unre¬ formed military establishment had managed to retain a large measure of autonomy from civilian control despite the republican revolution, this was a role of considerable importance. By the end of the ’20s Schleicher had established himself as an important behind-the-scenes figure in German politics. He had gained early promotion to the rank of general and presided over a special political affairs office subordinate only to the minister of de¬ fense. That arrangement placed him beyond the control of generals considerably superior to him in rank. It also led to his inclusion in the small circle of military leaders President von Hindenburg increasingly relied upon for political advice. In 1930 he was one of those who encouraged Hindenburg to break with the parliamentary system. Schleicher had a hand in selecting Briining as the first presidential chancellor and then played a major role in driving him from office two years later. At Schleicher’s urging, Hindenburg appointed as Briining’s suc¬ cessor Franz von Papen, a politically obscure fifty-two-year-old aristo¬ crat aligned with the extreme right wing of the Catholic Center Party. At the beginning of June 1932, Papen took office at the head of 7\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nwhat quickly became known as the ‘cabinet of barons’ because of the predominance of conservative aristocrats among his ministers. Papen’s qualification for the chancellorship was questionable, since he had no experience in national politics. As a Catholic Center deputy in the legislature of the federal state of Prussia during most of the republican period, he attended sessions infrequently and never took the floor to speak. He was, however, an old friend of Schleicher’s, who had known him since their days as junior army officers. The general expected Papen to serve as an elegant figurehead who would rely on him for guidance. In order to be in a position to exert his influence within the new cabinet, Schleicher assumed the post of defense minis¬ ter, resigning his general’s commission and becoming, at least nomi¬ nally, a civilian in order to qualify for the post. Upon assuming the chancellorship, Papen faced the problem of finding political backing for his cabinet. Like Briining, he had been appointed as a presidential chancellor, which put him in a position to govern by means of emergency decrees issued by Hindenburg. But he still needed to gain sufficient parliamentary backing to avoid a noconfidence vote in the Reichstag. In that respect, his position was from the outset far more precarious than Briining’s had been, for he promptly lost the support of his own party upon becoming chancellor. The leaders of the Catholic Center saw him as implicated in the ouster of their colleague Briining and were outraged by his acceptance of the chancellorship without the party’s permission. Only by resigning his party membership did he escape expulsion from the Catholic Center, which now disowned him and joined the opposition. In keeping with the president’s wish for a break with the Left, Papen set out to replace his predecessor’s reliance on the Social Democrats with support from the political Right. This meant courting the dynamic and rapidly growing Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler. 5\n\nOfficially known as the National Socialist German Workers\n\nParty since early 1920, the movement over which Hitler had soon thereafter gained control provided a political home after the First World War for socially marginal, racist nationalists who scorned both 8\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\nthe old imperial regime and the new democratic republic. It remained an insignificant Bavarian fringe group until the notoriety resulting from Hitler’s unsuccessful attempt in 1923 to overthrow the republic, the so-called beer hall putsch in Munich, helped it gain representation in the Reichstag the next year in alliance with similar groups. During the republic’s period of prosperity and stability Nazism faded to insig¬ nificance, tallying 2.6 percent of the vote and winning 12 of 491 seats in the Reichstag in 1928 only by virtue of the republic’s system of propoitional representation. But when the Great Depression brought widespread privation and unemployment to Germany, the Nazis be¬ gan to capitalize on the distress and anxiety of millions. ^Unburdened by government responsibility, the Nazis gained popularity by blaming the republicans for all the country’s ills and holding out the prospect of sweeping remedies without having to make good on any of their promises.4 They won the support of antiSemites by conducting an unbridled campaign of slander against the small Jewish minority^ In the streets of Germany they manifested their militancy through their stormtroop auxiliary, the SA. By engaging in bloody street battles with Social Democrats and Communists, each of which parties also maintained paramilitary organizations, the SA con¬ tributed to a violent political atmosphere that aroused the anxiety of many citizens. This enabled the Nazis to win over some voters by promising to restore order. In the election of 1930, held just as the effects of the economic crisis were becoming acute, their vote in¬ creased eightfold, giving them 107 of 577 Reichstag seats. In the spring of 1932 Hitler challenged Hindenburg for the presidency. Although he lost, he made a sufficiently strong showing to force a second round of balloting in which he tallied an impressive 36.1 percent. By the summer of 1932 Hitler was Germany’s most successful politician. This was an impressive achievement for someone who had arrived in Germany nineteen years earlier from Austria, a failed artist with minimal formal education, in flight from Vienna’s shelters for homeless men, where he had been reduced to living for several years. From the moment Hitler joined the fledgling Nazi movement 9\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nin 1919, after serving in the German army as a corporal on the western front, until his suicide a quarter century later in the rums of Berlin, politics occupied the center of his life. He soon established himself as the party’s leader—Fiihrer—and gained absolute authority within it. Exercising a messiah-like hold over his followers, he forged a rag¬ tag collection of radicals and reactionaries, intellectuals and thugs, un¬ successful professionals and restless war veterans, into a formidable organization that effectively combined charismatic leadership and bu¬ reaucratic discipline. Nazism was no ordinary political party but rather, as Hitler tirelessly insisted, a movement that demanded total, unquestioning commitment on the part of its members. After his failed putsch landed him in prison for more than a year, Hitler emerged undaunted and rebuilt his shattered party. Abandoning hope of overthrowing the republic by force, he set out to do so legally, through the ballot box. During the latter half of the ’20s, when economic stabilization enabled the embattled republic to consolidate under moderate political aus¬ pices, Hitler held the party together on the fringes of national politics by the sheer force of his personality. When the Great Depression brought anxiety and despair to millions, he built a mass following by means of unbridled demagogy and calculated mendacity. ^ The key to the future dictator’s success lay in his own persona. Physically Hitler resembled, in the eyes of those who remained im¬ mune to his appeal, the popular stereotype of a barber or waiter. But by crafty manipulation of public perceptions—among other things by allowing himself to be portrayed only in flattering poses by an accom¬ plished photographer dedicated to his cause-^he constructed an im¬ age of himself that conveyed profundity and self-denying dedication to millions of troubled Germans. In action as a politician he radiated an extraordinary intensity of conviction and certitude that many found irresistible, particularly in unsettled times. Hitler’s talents as an orator made him the greatest demagogue of his age. With a psychic energy unlike anything most contemporaries had encountered, he brought susceptible audiences to the brink of mass hysteria with lengthy, 1 o\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\npassionately delivered speeches that skillfully exploited their inse¬ curities and prejudices. In conversations with followers, he achieved much the same effect, overwhelming them with torrents of words and disarming them with his utter lack of self-doubt. What ultimately made Hitler a formidable political threat was, however, his ability to mask his brutal fanaticism behind a facade of conventionality whenever that served his purposes. When he found it advantageous to cultivate the favor of influential persons, he could appear polite and deferential, even humble. When he sought to win over those he knew did not share his extremist views, he concealed his real intentions. By 1932 these characteristics had enabled Hitler to become a major force in German politics, even though he had never been elected to any governmental post. In hopes of gaining Nazi support, Chancellor von Papen, with the concurrence of Schleicher, entered into what he took to be a deal with Hitler upon taking office in June 1932. When queried about cooperating with the new cabinet, the Nazi leader indicated his readiness to comply if two conditions were met: a lifting of the ban imposed on his stormtroopers by the Briining cabinet and the disso¬ lution of the Reichstag elected in 1930 to clear the way for a new election, even though two years of the legislature’s term remained. Papen at once gamed President von Hindenburg’s agreement to both requests. In addition, Papen seized upon an outbreak of bloody political violence between Nazis and Communists as a pretext to invoke the president’s emergency powers and depose the govern¬ ment of Prussia. By far the largest of the seventeen federal states of the republic, Prussia was a major political factor, comprising as it did, three-fifths of Germany in terms of both area and population. The takeover of its government by the Papen cabinet rendered impotent the pro-republican Social Democratic-Catholic Center cabinet in Prussia, which had long been a thorn in the side of rightists, espe¬ cially the Nazis. The new national election, which was held at the end of July 1932, proved a catastrophe for the moderate parties. It took place at\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nthe very nadir of the depression, when a combination of despair and anger made millions acutely vulnerable to extremist demagogy of the Right and Left. The Communists cut deeply into the strength of the Social Democrats, while the Nazis more than doubled their showing of 1930. Tallying 37.4 percent of the vote and winning 230 seats, Hitler’s party now replaced the Social Democrats as the largest party in the Reichstag. \\ After the July election, Hitler reneged on his assurances of coop¬ eration with the Papen cabinet and demanded the chancellorship for himself. Buoyed by his election triumph, the arch-foe of democracy now invoked democratic principles, contending that as leader of the strongest party in the parliament he had a right to head the govern¬ ment. Instead, Papen offered him the post of vice chancellor in his own cabinet, as well as ministerial posts for other Nazis. But recogniz¬ ing that the vice chancellorship was an empty title that carried no constitutional authority, Hitler indignantly declined. When President von Hindenburg personally received the Nazi leader in mid-August and inquired whether he and other members of his party would be willing to enter Papen’s cabinet, Hitler reiterated his demand for the chancellorship. Hindenburg, whose two previous meetings with the man he referred to in private as “the corporal” had left him. profoundly mistrustful, rejected that demand in no uncertain terms. Moreover, his office released to the press a version of their meeting that dealt Hitler a public rebuke by giving the impression that the Nazi leader had demanded total power and by intimating that Hitler had broken a personal promise to the president to cooperate with the Papen cabinet. Neither Hindenburg’s conscience nor his duties to the state would, according to the official announcement, permit the president to turn over power to a Nazi movement that was intent upon using it for partisan purposes. A furious Hitler responded by declaring all-out opposition to the Papen cabinet. Hindenburg’s rejection of Hitler’s bid for power was reassuring to Germany’s republicans. Most had supported the old field marshal’s reelection in the spring, but only because no other candidate capable 1 2\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal and the General ’\n\nof defeating Hitler was available. They did so with misgiving, because of fears that Hindenburg s use of presidential emergency powers to circumvent the legislative authority of the Reichstag was eroding the constitution. Whereas the republicans had respected Chancellor Briining, they were appalled by Hindenburg’s appointment of Papen as chancellor of a reactionary cabinet with virtually no support in the Reichstag. The president’s expression of willingness after the election to accord subordinate roles in the cabinet to Hitler and other Nazis aroused additional concern. Now, however, despite the Nazis’ elec¬ toral triumph, Hindenburg had ruled out the possibility of Hitler’s becoming chancellor, and the two had parted as political opponents. Republicans could therefore at least take consolation in the belief that, however far the president might stretch the constitution, he would never betray it by calling Adolf Hitler to the head of the government. The trust republicans placed in Hindenburg would have been badly shaken if they had known what the president agreed to out of public view only two weeks after his rebuff of Hitler. The Nazi leader s declaration of opposition left the Papen cabinet facing a cer¬ tain vote of no confidence when the new Reichstag convened. Papen had the backing of only one significant party, the reactionary GermanNationals, who had occasionally allied with the Nazis in the past but had broken with them acrimoniously over the presidential election and other issues. Altogether, less than io percent of the chamber stood behind Papen. There was even the possibility that negotiations under way between the Nazis and the Catholic Centrists, who together constituted a majority in the new Reichstag, might lead to a revival of the parliament’s authority and yield a Catholic-Nazi coalition cabinet that would force Papen out of office. Hindenburg was nevertheless unwilling to part with Papen. At the end of August he therefore granted the chancellor’s request for a decree that empowered Papen to dissolve the Reichstag at his discretion. Since another election could not be expected to produce a parliament of significantly different composition, the Papen cabinet also requested and obtained the presi¬ dent’s agreement not to schedule a new round of balloting, which the\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nconstitution stipulated must take place within sixty days following the dissolution of the parliament. This would enable the cabinet to govern dictatonally by means of presidential decrees without fear that the Reichstag would rescind those decrees or adopt a vote of no confi¬ dence. In order to keep a cabinet of his choice in power, that is, Hindenburg gave his consent to a violation of the constitution he had sworn to uphold. when the new parliament convened in September, Chancellor von Papen’s plan to circumvent the constitution was derailed by an unex¬ pected turn of events. Papen intended to dissolve the chamber before it could vote no confidence, then have the president declare a state of emergency as justification for not scheduling another election. But when Papen sought to head off a vote on a Communist no-confidence motion by submitting the dissolution decree, the newly elected pre¬ siding officer of the Reichstag, Hermann Goring of the Nazi Party, ignored the chancellor and carried out the tally on the motion. The result was the most humiliating parliamentary defeat ever suffered by a German cabinet, with 512 deputies casting ballots in favor of the motion and only 42 supporting the Papen cabinet. Over Goring’s protests, President von Hindenburg ruled afterward that the chamber had been legally dissolved by the chancellor before the no-confidence vote carried, but the damage had been done. With the vulnerability of the Papen cabinet now fully exposed, the chancellor and most of his ministers concluded that the time was not ripe for the risk-laden plan to violate the constitution. Instead, the second national parliamentary election of 1932 was scheduled for early November, well within the required sixty days. k’;-§Jj*.The November election dealt a staggering blow to Hitler and his party. After an unbroken succession of dramatic gains over the pre¬ vious three years, the Nazi juggernaut faltered. Many voters who had cast their ballots for the Nazis in July in the expectation that they would soon come to power and provide quick, decisive remedies to Germany’s plight, defected in frustration at the failure of Hitler’s bid 1 4\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\nfor the chancellorship. Others became alienated when the Nazis dashed hopes for a broad, rightist, ‘nationalist opposition’ by denouncing the Papen cabinet as a reactionary clique and excoriating the German-Nationals for their support of the cabinet. Still others were appalled by the increasing violence of the Nazi stormtroopers. Some of those who had earlier found Hitler’s party attractive because of its militant rejection of the parliamentary republic recoiled when the Nazis began invoking democratic principles in order to exploit their control over the largest bloc of Reichstag seats. Many conservative Germans who had voted for the Nazis in July took offense at their vitriolic agitation against not only Papen but also President von Hin\\ denburg. Altogether, on election day more than two million fewer voters cast their ballots for the Nazis than in July. The party emerged with 196 of 584 seats in the new Reichstag, a loss of 34. It still commanded the strongest delegation in the parliament, but in what was to prove the last national election prior to Hitler’s appointment as chancellor, more than two-thirds of the Germans who went to the polls rejected Nazism. The outcome of the balloting of November 1932 eliminated the possibility of a Nazi-Catholic Reichstag majority, but the parliamen¬ tary situation otherwise remained basically the same. The bulk of those who deserted Hitler’s party stayed home on election day rather than shifting their votes. Only the Communists appreciably increased their strength, emerging as the third-strongest party with 100 seats. Their gains came largely at the expense of the second-strongest party, the Social Democrats, the chief defenders of the republican cause. Still the largest party in terms of members, the Social Democrats saw their seats dwindle to 121. Together, the two leftist parties would have constitu¬ ted a major political force, but they stood irreconcilably opposed to each other. At the direction of the Soviet Union, the Communists placed their highest priority on winning over the much larger follow¬ ing of the Social Democrats by denouncing them as ‘social fascists’ more inimical to the interests of workers than the Nazis. The two Catholic parties, the Center and the Bavarian People’s\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nParty, suffered marginal losses in November but together still com¬ manded a bloc of 90 seats. Reduced to insignificance by heavy losses over the previous three years, the two liberal parties salvaged 13 seats between them, while splinter parties spawned by the republic’s system of proportional representation held another 12. The GermanNationals, who were Papen’s principal supporters, scored gains and emerged with 52 seats, mainly by profiting from disillusionment with the Nazis. But this did not alter the fact that nearly 90 percent of the voters who went to the polls in November again cast their ballots against Papen’s cabinet. After consultations with party leaders con¬ firmed this lack of support, Papen submitted his resignation but agreed to remain as chancellor on a caretaker basis. When Hindenburg sounded out Hitler after the November elec¬ tion about the possibility of his party’s participating in a cabinet, the Nazi leader indicated his readiness to seek the support of other parties if the president commissioned him to form a cabinet as chancellor. Assuming that no Reichstag majority could be found for a Hitler cabinet, Hindenburg engaged in a maneuver designed by his advisers to discredit the Nazi leader in the eyes of the public. Calling Hitler’s bluff, the president asked him to report within three days whether he could find a workable majority in the Reichstag ready to support him as chancellor of a parliamentary cabinet. Hindenburg attached, more¬ over, a number of stipulations to that offer, including selection by himself of the defense and foreign ministers. As expected, Hitler declined Hindenburg’s proposal. The terms, he complained, were incompatible with the republican constitution, which assigned selection of cabinet ministers to the chancellor. As an alternative, he suggested that Hindenburg agree to appoint him chan¬ cellor and give him access to the emergency powers of the presidency if he could quickly present a satisfactory government program and an acceptable list of cabinet members, which would, he pledged, include Papen’s conservative foreign minister and Schleicher as defense minister.^lAs this proposal revealed, Hitler’s real goal was to become a presidential, rather than a parliamentary, chancellor. As such, he would 1 6\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General be free of dependence on a coalition with other parties and be able to govern by means of presidential emergency decrees, just as Bruning and Papen had done. Hitler’s proposal was, however, ignored by the president and his advisers, so that he ceased to be a candidate for the chancellorship. This second rebuff of Hitler by Hindenburg reinforced the grow¬ ing belief among Germany’s republicans that the venerable president would never turn over the chancellorship to Hitler. Especially heart¬ ening was the open letter the president’s office sent to the Nazi leader to conclude the November negotiations. After clarifying the differ¬ ence between parliamentary and presidential cabinets, the letter an¬ nounced that the president “believes he cannot answer to the German people for giving presidential powers to the leader of a party that has over and over emphasized its exclusivity and has opposed him per¬ sonally and the political and economic measures he has regarded as necessary. The president must under these circumstances fear that a presidential cabinet led by you would inevitably develop into a party dictatorship with all of its consequences for a heightening of the contradictions in the German nation, something he could never rec¬ oncile with his oath and his conscience.” When the question of Hitler’s possible appointment as chancellor arose again two months later, the defenders of the republican cause would take heart in recall¬ ing those words. With Hitler’s recalcitrance confirmed by late November, Papen stood ready to stay on as chancellor, although his political unpop¬ ularity had continued to increase. One member of his cabinet report¬ edly quipped that its motto had become “declarations of war accepted here!” The only success he could claim was the agreement of the victorious powers of the First World War to cancel Germany’s repara¬ tion debts. Knowledgeable observers knew, however, that his prede¬ cessor, Chancellor Bruning, deserved most of the credit for that. At home, Papen’s economic policies had thoroughly alienated orga¬ nized labor. His cabinet had added to the hardships of those most vic¬ timized by the depression by reducing the level of unemployment\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\ncompensation and subjecting applicants to a strict means test. Busi¬ nesses, by contrast, were accorded tax relief and, as an incentive to hire more employees, were authorized to reduce wages set earlier by collective bargaining contracts. Papen’s takeover of the Prussian state government had outraged the two principal parties that sought to defend the republic’s institutions, the Social Democrats and the Cath¬ olic Centrists. These parties saw that move as an unconstitutional expansion of the national government’s authority and smarted at losing control of patronage in the large Prussian civil bureaucracy. Papen further compounded his unpopularity by publicly pro¬ claiming dictatorship as his goal and endorsing proposals to alter the constitution so as to curtail its democratic character. As a result, he faced another humiliating no-confidence vote when the new chamber convened, should he be retained as chancellor. But, as Papen informed his cabinet in the last week of November, none of this mattered, since President von Hindenburg was “firmly resolved to take all measures that might become necessary” to support him. Hindenburg was again prepared, that is, to grant Papen a decree to dissolve the Reichstag without scheduling a new national election as required by the consti¬ tution. Once that step was taken, Papen could govern in dictatorial fashion by means of presidential decrees without having to answer to the parliament. Whereas Papen enjoyed the support of the president, he had lost that of his patron and defense minister, Kurt von Schleicher. In selecting Papen for the chancellorship, Schleicher had assumed he would be able to control him for his own purposes. “I’m not the soul of the cabinet,” he reportedly boasted, “but I am perhaps its will.” The general was therefore unpleasantly surprised when his protege dis¬ played a mounting assertiveness after assuming office. To Schleicher’s annoyance, Papen soon made himself increasingly independent of him by ingratiating himself with President von Hindenburg. By late No¬ vember, although Schleicher had concurred in most of the Papen cabinet’s policies, he had become apprehensive about the risks in¬ volved in keeping such a widely despised chancellor in office by i 8\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General circumventing the constitution. Forgoing a new election after a disso¬ lution of the Reichstag, Schleicher feared, would unite virtually all the political forces of the country, including the legions of organized labor, in militant opposition to the government. Only weeks earlier, collaboration of the Nazis and the Communists in a transit strike in Berlin had sufficed to bring the capital to the brink of paralysis on the eve of the Reichstag election. Concerned that Papen’s reappointment might lead to civil war, Schleicher set about undermining the man he had made chancellor only six months earlier. At the same time, he made himself a candidate for that office by dissociating himself from the Papen cabinet’s most unpopular policies in discussions with political and labor leaders. When Hindenburg nevertheless held to the plan to violate the consti¬ tution to keep Papen in office, Schleicher’s efforts nearly failed. But he finally succeeded in turning the chancellor’s own cabinet against him by revealing the results of a Defense Ministry study which concluded that the army would be unable to cope with a civil war that might pit both Communists and Nazis against the government. On December 2, 1932, an embittered Papen submitted his resignation to Hinden¬ burg, who reluctantly accepted it. The next day, Schleicher was sworn in as chancellor, having received assurances of full support from the president. With only two exceptions, his cabinet consisted of his predecessor’s ministers. He himself remained defense minister and also succeeded Papen as commissar for Prussia, a post created when that state’s government had been stripped of its authority in July.\n\nFIFTY years old at the time of his appointment, Kurt von Schleicher almost invariably made a strong impression on those who encountered him. He did so, moreover, despite an unprepossessing physical appear¬ ance. Of middling stature, he had a sallow complexion, was pre¬ maturely bald and tended to paunchiness in middle age. A lively and adept conversationalist, he excelled at winning over others in one-toone exchanges, his preferred mode of communication. “He has the gift,” one journalist observed, “of giving whoever visits him the\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nimpression that he completely shares their opinion.” Through quick¬ ness of mind and a gift for turning a phrase, Schleicher also passed as something of a wit. He was a master at light banter and achieved humorous effects by salting his speech with slang expressions delivered m the rakish dialect of plebeian Berliners. Jaunty and buoyant of bearing, unfailingly optimistic and seemingly unflappable, he pos¬ sessed a goodly portion ol the nonchalant, dashing quality so admired among German officers. Detractors regarded Schleicher as overbearing and supercilious, a cynical master of intrigue ruthlessly bent on self-advancement. His penchant for behind-the-scenes manipulation gave rise to references to the literal meaning of his family name, which translates into English as “creeper.” His repeated abandonment of close associates in order to salvage his own position in times of crisis led to charges of untrust¬ worthiness. What no one doubted was the general’s self-confidence. In the spring of 1932, at a dinner party in a fashionable Berlin restau¬ rant, he was overheard to exclaim in his penetrating nasal voice, “What Germany needs today is a strong man.” Lest anyone fail to recognize who best fit that role, he tapped himself on the chest. At once garrulous and reticent, Schleicher remained something of a political riddle as he took office. A republican journalist labeled him a “sphinx in uniform,” and the dissident Russian Bolshevik Leon Trotsky once characterized him as “a question mark with the epaulettes of a general.” But although many on the political Left as well as the Nazis denounced him as a reactionary, that label did not entirely fit him. Unlike many of his fellow officers, Schleicher neither mourned the overthrow of the Empire nor yearned for a restoration of the monarchy. On pragmatic grounds, he accepted the political real¬ ities created by the collapse of the old regime and its replacement by the republic. Recognizing that disputes about the form of government could only divide and weaken Germany, he had by the mid-’20s concluded: “Republic or monarchy is not the question now, but rathei what should this republic look like.” As was true of most military leaders, however, his loyalty lay not so much with the repub2o\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General lie as with what he regarded as the abiding interests of the German state, which transcended particular regimes. For him, the army repre¬ sented an independent force, above politics, whose function was to serve as a balance wheel, keeping the state on an even keel and ensuring its ability to defend Germany’s security interests in the inter¬ national sphere. During his first weeks as chancellor in December 1932 Schleicher enjoyed something of a political honeymoon as a result of widespread relief at Papen’s departure. By making it known that he had no intention of pursuing his predecessor’s plans to alter the constitution, he calmed the defenders of the republic. The two Catholic parties adopted a conciliatory stance toward his cabinet. So did the leaders of the Christian trade unions, who were encouraged by promises on his part of decisive measures to put the unemployed back to work. The Social Democrats, who feared losses to the Communists if they collab¬ orated with a military leader, retained an oppositional stance stiffened by their memory of Schleicher’s involvement in the Papen cabinet’s deposition of the Prussian state government led by one of their num¬ ber. But the leaders of the Social Democrats’ trade union affiliate, the country’s largest, viewed Schleicher as a lesser evil than Papen and responded favorably to his pledges of measures against unemployment. Heartened by the positive responses from organized labor, the new chancellor concluded with relief that he had succeeded in dispelling the danger of a broad, popular revolt against the government that had developed under Papen. There remained, however, the problem of how to avoid a no-confidence vote by the Reichstag. Schleicher placed his hopes for averting a collision with the parliament on gaining political backing from the Nazis. If their 196 Reichstag delegates supported him or at least refrained from opposi¬ tion, that would be a major step toward blocking the formation of a hostile majority. Like most army officers, Schleicher admired the militaristic patriotism of Hitler’s movement, even while disdaining its demagogic populism. The Nazis were, in his eyes, a useful if unruly counterpoise to the leftist parties. He regarded them, he confided to a\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nfriend earlier in the year, as “troublesome types” who had to be enjoyed with the utmost caution.” Like quite a few other prominent conservatives, including former chancellor Briining, and even a num¬ ber of respected Jewish figures, he believed the Nazis could be ‘tamed’ by saddling them with a share of governmental responsibility. But whereas others saw themselves reluctantly driven to that view and would have preferred the destruction of Nazism, Schleicher never seriously considered the latter option. Fearing that if the Nazi Party broke up, its most dynamic elements would flock to the Communists and greatly augment the strength of the revolutionary Left, he opposed repressive measures against Hitler’s followers. “If they did not exist,” he wrote to his friend, “it would be necessary to invent them.” Schleicher based his optimism about taming the Nazis in part on a parallel he saw with the history of an earlier mass revolutionary movement, the Social Democratic Party. The unsuccessful attempt by the architect of the German Empire, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, to suppress that party a half-century earlier through persecution proved for Schleicher that repression only added to the militancy and popularity of mass-based radical movements. From the Social Demo¬ crats’ moderation and declining popularity after they gained a share of power through the revolution of 1918 he concluded that the Nazis would be similarly moderated if they were brought into the govern¬ ment. Once they had to cope with the intractable realities of the economic crisis, he assumed they would become realistic, while their failure to make good on their exaggerated promises would cost them much of their mass support. Like the Social Democratic Party, Nazism would, if burdened with a share of responsibility for the often un¬ avoidably unpopular measures of government, cease to be a rapidly growing militant movement that threatened the state and become instead just another political party. These expectations were gro¬ tesquely flawed, of course, by Schleicher’s failure to recognize the vast difference between the republican Social Democrats and the total¬ itarian Nazis. The Nazis also fit into Schleicher’s plans in his capacity as defense 2 2\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General minister. After lengthy negotiation with the victorious powers of World War I, Germany was on the verge of securing acceptance by those nations of the principle of armaments parity for Germany. Since there was no likelihood that the victors would join in the general disarmament foreseen by the Versailles Treaty, the achievement of parity would clear the way for realization of the German military’s long-standing goal of expanding the armed forces. That had long been one of Schleicher’s paramount projects, and he was resolved to start the process of rearmament as soon as possible. But rather than risk alarming the victors by suddenly increasing the size of the army, he intended to move toward universal conscription by creating a militia that would provide military training for large numbers of civilians. For the initial source of manpower, he looked to the paramilitary organi¬ zations that had proliferated since the war. Prominent among these unarmed but uniformed and regimented organizations was the Nazi SA. With over four hundred thousand stormtroopers in uniform by 1932, the SA outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one the small army to which Germany was limited by the Versailles Treaty. In hopes of smoothing the way for an eventual recruitment of Nazi stormtroopers for his planned militia, Schleicher had for some time maintained covert contact with the leadership of the SA through his staff at the Defense Ministry. Schleicher recognized that Hitler was the key to Nazi support and hoped to strike a deal with him. In several personal encounters over the previous two years, he had failed to discern that Hitler was an implacable fanatic, bent upon a radical transformation of Ger¬ many. After their first meeting, Schleicher described the Nazi leader as “an interesting man with unusual rhetorical gifts,” who “gets easily carried away with his own plans.” Even allowing for Hitler’s skill at playing down or leaving unmentioned his fanatical antiSemitism and other extremist views when talking with members of the conservative establishment, Schleicher’s assessment betrayed a frivolous underestimation of the future dictator. The previous sum¬ mer, following the Nazis’ strong showing in the July Reichstag\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nelection, he had even been ready to see Hitler installed as chancellor until Hindenburg ruled that out. In late November, knowing of the president s willingness to accept the Nazi leader into the government in a subordinate capacity, he had sounded out Hitler about becoming vice chancellor in a Schleicher cabinet. But, as before, the Nazi leader had made it unmistakably clear that he would participate only in a cabinet he himself headed. With Hitler unyielding, Schleicher turned his attention to the head of the Nazi Party’s elaborate administrative apparatus, Gregor Strasser. A veteran leader whose popularity within the movement was second only to Hitler’s, Strasser was regarded by many outside the party as the most reasonable Nazi leader. As an erstwhile pharmacist, he had practical business experience, something conspicuously rare among the top Nazis. In comparison with that assemblage of eccen¬ trics and fanatics, he seemed a sober, levelheaded pragmatist. Because Strasser was widely regarded as a Nazi who took the word socialist’ in the party’s name seriously, he even commanded grudging respect in trade union circles. Schleicher could thus hope to collaborate with him without alienating organized labor. At the time, some observers erroneously concluded from Schleicher’s interest in Strasser and his conciliatory gestures toward trade union leaders that the new chancel¬ lor was seeking to put together a ‘labor axis’ (Querfront) by splitting off the wing of the Nazi Party associated with Strasser and aligning it, along with organized labor, behind his cabinet. There is, however, no evidence to support this view, which has colored most interpretations of Schleicher’s strategy ever since. Strasser’s well-known doubts about Hitler’s all-or-nothing strat¬ egy made him potentially useful to Schleicher. More realistic than most prominent Nazis, Strasser had concluded from the outcome of the November election that the party was unlikely ever to gain sole control over the government by winning a majority through the ballot box. He therefore regretted that Hitler’s refusal to settle for anything less than the chancellorship had prevented the Nazis from gaining a place in the Papen cabinet while their bargaining power had been 24\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General strongest following the electoral triumph of the previous summer. Strasser’s knowledge of conditions at the grassroots level of the party led him to forecast declining morale and mounting financial diffi¬ culties if the rank-and-file Nazi activists did not soon receive the rewards of at least a share of power. Under such conditions, he feared the party would suffer devastating losses if another confrontation with the cabinet led to dissolution of the Reichstag and a new election. Learning of Strasser’s misgivings through intermediaries, Schleicher hoped to draw him into his cabinet. His goal was not, however, to split the Nazi movement, as some observers assumed, but rather to win the backing of the entire party. On December 4, a day after taking office, Schleicher met secretly with Strasser in Berlin. Neither left any record of what they discussed, but circumstantial evidence indicates that Schleicher had in mind an elaborate scheme. Its key element was the minister-presidency of Prussia. Nazi and Communist gains in a state legislative election there the previous April had eliminated majority support for the Prussian cabinet led by Otto Braun, a prominent Social Democrat who had dominated that large state’s politics throughout the republican period. Since the parties could not agree on a replacement, Braun’s cabinet remained in office on a caretaker basis but was stripped of its authority in July by the Papen cabinet—with the concurrence of Schleicher. By the late autumn, it seemed possible that the Prussian impasse might be broken by formation of a new cabinet based on a majority coalition of Nazis and the Catholic Center Party. Strasser was frequently men¬ tioned as minister-president of such a cabinet, since he was thought to be acceptable to the Catholics. If he became Prussian ministerpresident, Schleicher could offer to restore the authority of that office on condition that Strasser also enter the Reich cabinet. Such an ar¬ rangement would resolve the friction-ridden relationship between the Prussian and national governments that had led to the deposition of Braun’s cabinet. It would also make it very difficult, if not impossible, for the Nazis to oppose a Schleicher cabinet in which one of their party’s most prominent leaders sat.\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nHitler swiftly scotched this scheme. He insisted that the Nazi candidate for the Prussian minister-presidency must be his obedient confidant Hermann Goring rather than Strasser. Goring was, how¬ ever, unacceptable to both the Catholics and to Schleicher. To con¬ sider their next move, the leading Nazis met in Berlin on December 5, the eve of the new Reichstag’s opening session. The day before, their party had suffered another crushing setback at the polls, this time in local elections in the state of Thuringia. There the Nazis lost nearly 40 percent of the votes they had tallied in the Reichstag election of July and almost a quarter of their reduced showing of November. Coming on top of losses in local balloting in three other states since the disastrous November Reichstag election, the Thuringian debacle pro¬ vided compelling evidence that the party’s support among the electo¬ rate was rapidly eroding. y.\n\nIn view of the Nazis’ declining fortunes, Strasser argued at the\n\nmeeting of Nazi leaders on December 5 in favor of cooperating with the Schleicher cabinet. The new chancellor had warned, he reported, that if he faced a hostile majority he would dissolve the new cham¬ ber.AFor the Nazis that would mean the third costly national election campaign within six months and, from all indications, bring more heavy losses. Unmoved by Strasser’s arguments, Hitler held to his position of all-out opposition unless he himself became chancellor. Following the leadership meeting, Hitler took his case to a caucus of the Nazi Reichstag deputies. As a stony-faced Strasser looked on silently, Hitler denounced compromise as unworthy of the honor of the party. Rejecting democratic procedures as un-German, the Nazis did not reach decisions by majority votes, but by the close of the caucus it was clear that none of the deputies was willing to challenge the party leader. Even those who sympathized with Strasser submit¬ ted to Hitler’s will. It was agreed to seek a respite by avoiding an immediate showdown with the Schleicher cabinet and accepting an early holiday recess of the new Reichstag. But the party’s leadership ranks remained committed to Hitler’s uncompromising course. When the new Reichstag convened on December 6, the Nazis’ 2 6\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General behavior heartened Schleicher, who did not know the extent to which Hitler had bested Strasser. At the opening session the Nazi deputies helped to defeat a Communist motion to make a vote of no confi¬ dence the first item of business. They then agreed to an abbreviated agenda that would permit the chamber to recess for a holiday truce of indefinite duration after only four days in session. The Schleicher cabinet raised no objections to the few bills on the agenda, which included an amnesty for persons convicted of political violence and recision of an emergency decree issued by the Papen cabinet that had particularly offended labor. On December 7, Schleicher confidently predicted to his cabinet that the Nazis would refrain from opposing him. He held out the prospect of a Reichstag majority consisting of Nazis, the two Catholic parties, and a group of splinter parties that would acquiesce in the cabinet’s governing by means of presidential emergency decree. Such an arrangement would functionally replicate the formula by which former chancellor Briining had governed for two years, but with the vital difference that whereas Briining had relied on the republican Social Democrats, Schleicher now proposed to rely on the Nazis. The day after Schleicher’s prediction to his cabinet, December 8, Hitler was staggered by receipt of a letter from Gregor Strasser an¬ nouncing his resignation as head of the party’s organizational apparatrf^The immediate reason Strasser gave was Hitler’s obstruction of his efforts to tighten his administrative authority over Nazism’s re¬ gional units. But Strasser also revealed that he was no longer willing to go along with the party leader’s all-or-nothing strategy, which he characterized as akin to a wager on chacfTlt was time, he maintained, to accept a share of power by becoming part of a broad-based, con¬ structive national front. Strasser nevertheless assured Hitler that he remained a loyal member of the party and had no intention of becom¬ ing the focus of opposition within it. To discourage any such expecta¬ tions, he announced that he was leaving Berlin and going abroad. His assurances were thrown into question, however, when Hitler learned that before submitting his letter Stfasser had denounced Hitler’s all-or-\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nnothing strategy at a meeting with a group of seni or Nazi officials and warned that if they waited until their leader captured the chancellor¬ ship on his terms, the party would collapse. Also, within hours Hidereceived a similar letter from another veteran Nazi, the economic theorist Gottfried Feder, who had been instrumental in Hitler’s entry into politics. The vaunted unity that had been one of the key elements of Nazism’s success seemed to be crumbling. In the face of these developments, Hitler came as close to panick¬ ing as he ever did. Having by that time heard reports that Strasser had met secretly with Schleicher and been offered the vice chancellorship, he feared there might be truth to rumors that his erstwhile lieutenant intended to join the cabinet and split the party by taking his followers with him. ‘ ‘ If the party falls apart, ’ ’ a shaken Hitler confided to his future propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, “I’ll finish myself off with a pistol within three minutes.” Assembling the Nazi officials who had heard Strasser’s denunciation of his strategy earlier in the day, he deliv¬ ered an impassioned appeal to their loyalty. The consequence of disobe¬ dience on the part of his followers, he intimated, would be his suicide. This melodramatic performance quelled whatever wavering Strasser might have occasioned among the senior Nazi officials, who unanimously reaffirmed their loyalty to Hitler. Bolstered by their support, Hitler brought the Nazi Reichstag deputies to heel on the afternoon of December 8 with a similar harangue. In an effort to discourage speculation about a breakup of the party, he released to the press a statement in which he announced that he had, at Strasser’s request, granted him sick leave for three weeks. To Hitler’s relief, there were no further defections. Just as he had promised in his letter, Strasser departed for a vacation in northern Italy. For the remainder of the year he would remain out of public view and retrain from political activity. Deserted by Strasser, Gottfried Feder quickly recanted and was readmitted to the Nazi fold. Hitler himself took over as Strasser’s successor at the head of the party’s bureaucracy and installed men subservient to him in key positions. To bolster morale, he hurried about the country, speaking to gatherings of Nazi functionaries. 2 8\n\nThe Field Marshal, the Corporal, and the General\n\nAlthough Hitler’s worst fears had not materialized, Strasser’s defection was just one of many signs that the would-be dictator’s fortunes were ebbing as 1932 drew to a close. Because of his un¬ willingness to settle for anything but the chancellorship, he was further from power than he had been during the summer, when his party’s strength had reached its peak. *The heavy election losses since then revealed increasing disillusionment among those Germans whose votes had made him a major political factor. The high office he sought was in the hands of a general who had long been a confidant of the ultimate arbiter of power, President von Hindenburg. He himself had twice been emphatically denied the chancellorship by the president, who had taken a pronounced dislike to him. To add to Hitler’s woes, the economic depression that had propelled him to prominence had begun to wane. Since the spring, the value of shares and bonds traded on the Frankfurt stock market had risen by over 30 percent. “The slump has ended,” observed Ger¬ many’s most prestigious economic research institute at the close of 1932, “and the bottoming out has taken place, following which a new upswing can begin.” “Land in Sight!” proclaimed a headline in the business section of the New Year’s edition of the Frankfurter Zeitung. As 1933 opened, Hitler seemed politically isolated, with no tangible results to show for a year of frenetic political activity, and losing ground with Germany’s voters. He had reached a low point that seemed fully to justify the optimism reflected in the New Year’s editorials of republican journalists. As Goebbels gloomily noted in his diary, “1932 has been one long streak of bad luck.”\n\n\\ *\n\n.\n\n2\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched\n\nO\n\nN the evening OF New Year’s Day 1933 Adolf Hitler attended a performance of Richard Wagner’s opera Die Meistersinger von Niimberg at Munich’s Court Theater\n\nunder the baton of the celebrated conductor Hans Knappertsbusch. In his youth, Hitler had become a passionate Wagnerian with an insatia¬ ble appetite for the composer’s operas. This later brought him to the attention of the Wagner family, who welcomed him as a kind of political mascot at the festivals of the master’s music in Bayreuth. In a country justifiably proud of its musical heritage, that association lent the Nazi leader an aura of high culture seldom, if ever, enjoyed by German politicians. Hitler’s enthusiasm for Wagner’s operas also helped to gain him access, early in his political career, to well-to-do, aesthetically inclined reactionary circles in Munich. It was at social gatherings in the homes of these patrons that he learned how to comport himself in polite society and how to dress for formal occa¬ sions. And it was by mixing with the cultural elite of the Bavarian capital that he acquired a sufficient veneer of refinement to make him 3 1\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nappear a plausible candidate for high political office in the eyes of many Germans, despite his humble origins and minimal formal education. Following the performance of Die Meistersinger, Hitler joined a New Year’s celebration at the home of one of his wealthy patrons, the Munich art dealer Ernst “Putzi” Hanfstaengl, a Harvard College graduate who had become an active Nazi. Hitler was the star attrac¬ tion, the other guests having obviously been invited to please him. These included two of the rough-and-ready attendants who served him as bodyguards and factotums, his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, and his party secretary Rudolf Hess, who was accom¬ panied by his wife. Rounding off the gathering were several young, single women Hanfstaengl and his wife had invited, knowing how Hitler enjoyed being surrounded by attractive but unassertive mem¬ bers of the opposite sex. One of these that evening was Eva Braun, the pert blonde assistant in Hoffmann’s studio who later became Hitler’s mistress during his years as dictator until their marriage minutes before they committed suicide in April 1945. Gathered about Hanfstaengl’s hearth over coffee, this assemblage listened to a phonograph recording of a Rachmaninoff piano concert and conversed until the early hours of the morning, with Hitler contributing a critique of Knappertsbusch’s direction of the evening’s opera. Hanfstaengl later recounted that, as Hitler was signing the guest book before leaving, the Nazi leader “looked up at me and said in a tone of suppressed excitement: ‘This year belongs to us. I will guarantee you that in writing’.” By January 1933 Hitler was, at forty-three, a quite prosperous man. Royalties from sales of his best-selling book Mein Kampf pro¬ vided him with a substantial income that was supplemented by gifts from wealthy patrons. He resided in a large, comfortable apartment in a fashionable district of Munich. The headquarters of the once obscure party he had joined as an unknown ex-Bavarian army corporal occu¬ pied a lavishly appointed neo-Renaissance palace prominently located in the center of the city the Nazis referred to as the “capital of the movement.” He traveled about in an expensive Mercedes-Benz lim¬ ousine, driven by his own chauffeur. His frequent holidays were spent\n\n3 2\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched at a picturesque chalet he owned in the Bavarian alps. On his nu¬ merous and often prolonged visits to Berlin, he resided with his retinue of attendants in the ornate Kaiserhof Hotel in the center of the capital, half a block from the Reich Chancellory. Free of fixed obliga¬ tions, Hitler lived a self-indulgent, semi-bohemian existence. Rarely rising before noon, he habitually lingered long over afternoon coffee and cake at stylish cafes, surrounded by slavish retainers and fawning admirers. His evenings were frequently spent in choice seats at the opera or as guest of honor in the homes of wealthy admirers like Hanfstaengl. He led, in short, a life of ease and luxury that most Germans could only dream of in those depression-ridden times. Despite the setbacks of 1932, Hitler was still potentially in a position to wield considerable political influence as the new year began. Even after his party’s heavy losses in the November election, it commanded the largest delegation in the Reichstag and was backed by its pugnacious stormtrooper legions. As Hitler had repeatedly been given to understand, high positions in the government and great influence over its policies awaited him and other Nazi leaders. All he had to do was renounce his demand for the chancellorship and agree to share power with the conservatives placed in charge of the state by President von Hmdenburg. Sharing power was, however, impossible for Hitler. No ordinary politician, he was a fanatic with a grandiose sense of mission. He saw himself destined to become nothing less than the creator of a radically new Germany. To achieve a mission of that magnitude, only absolute power, free from all compromise with others, would suffice. From the time hejoined the fledgling Nazi movement in 1919 until his suicide a quarter century later, pursuit of that mission consumed Hitler. With little by way of a private life, he sublimated the normal human drives by single-mindedly pursuing what he unquestioningly believed was the destiny foreordained for him by what he referred to as “provi¬ dence.” Incapable of imagining a reality that did not conform to his vision of the future, Hitler proceeded through life, as he himself put it, “with the certainty of a sleepwalker.”\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nHitler’s vision of Germany’s future derived from the dark subcur¬ rents of nineteenth-century thought. An autodidact who read vora¬ ciously in newspapers and inexpensive popular publications during the idle years of his youth in Vienna and Munich, he would later impress many better educated persons with his command of an impressive range of information, particularly about history. His vigorous, reten¬ tive mind was, however, disciplined by neither systematic analysis nor self-skepticism. As a result, he uncritically imbibed many pseudoscien¬ tific notions then in circulation. These he shaped into a worldview that guided his thinking throughout his career. It amalgamated the social Darwinist doctrine of a struggle to the death for survival with the racialist proposition that humanity was irrevocably segmented into mutually hostile ethnic groups. The world was, for him, a jungle, where might made right and races either prevailed and grew stronger or weakened and perished. From this, he drew the conclusion that mortal combat between races was a dictate of nature, its way of assuring progress of the species. In his eyes war thus seemed not only unavoidable but ennobling. Hitler had no doubts about which ethnic group must triumph in this all-out struggle for survival. Steeped in bogus ethnological doc¬ trines then popular in Central Europe, he believed that the Germans belonged to an ‘Aryan’ master race. As he saw it, they could realize their high destiny only by crushing the lesser peoples who stood in their way, the most dangerous being the Jews, who had, he was convinced, infiltrated German society and were undermining it. Ger¬ many was, in his eyes, doomed if it succumbed to the alien and debilitating doctrine of democracy, which recognized Jews as citizens and accorded decisive political power to the ignorant masses. Another source of debility was for him Marxism, a doctrine that enfeebled the German people by fragmenting it into mutually hostile classes. Na¬ tional Socialism’s goal was therefore to unite the German nation under a new racially pure elite, headed by himself, that would establish its right to total power by vanquishing all other political forces and destroying the democratic republic. Once the elements that had\n\n3 4\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched weakened the nation were eliminated, the new leadership would rid the country of ethnic impurities, launch an all-out war to establish dominance over Europe, and ensure Germany’s future growth for the next millennium through the conquest of ‘living space’ in the fertile regions of Russia. By the early ’30s Hitler had ceased to trumpet these megalomanic plans in public, although evidence of them could be found in the turgid pages of Mein Kampf, which few members of the German political elite bothered to read. After the failure of his attempt at a putsch in 1923, he had pursued power by using the extensive civil and political liberties guaranteed by the republic’s democratic constitution in order to destroy democracy itself. Since this entailed attracting as many voters as possible, he found it expedient, in his public state¬ ments, to conceal his ultimate aims. Pledging to seek power through the constitution and dampening even his virulent anti-Semitism, Hitler increasingly concentrated his fire on the republicans. They had, he charged, traitorously sold out the German people to Marxism and to the victorious wartime enemies that had imposed the Versailles Treaty on the country. By 1930 Hitler had recognized that he could not succeed in the face of opposition from the entire political establishment. He therefore sought to mollify the military leadership by asserting personal control over the strong-arm auxiliary of his party, the SA, and thwarting its leaders’ ambitions to infiltrate the army with the goal of ultimately taking it over. He also set out to harness for his own purposes the hostility toward the republic of other rightist forces. As the Nazis’ electoral strength grew, they gamed entry into several state govern¬ ments by joining in coalitions with conservatives. Those arrangements proved unsatisfactory from Hitler’s viewpoint, however. They left his party dependent upon coalition partners who could limit its influence on personnel and policy and, by withdrawing their support, drive it from government. Other attempts to find allies also yielded dis¬ appointing results, mainly because of Hitler’s imperious claims to primacy.\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nSuch setbacks did not daunt Hitler. He occasionally experienced black moments, as when his chief lieutenant Gregor Strasser deserted him in December 1932, but he never lost his messianic conviction that he was destined to become Germany’s absolute ruler. His relentless drive for power was fueled as well by a sense of urgency arising from the fear—fed by chronic hypochondria—that he might not live long enough to accomplish his historic mission. “I have no time to wait!” he explained to a follower. “I can’t lose another year. I must get power soon in order to accomplish my gigantic tasks in the time remaining to me. I must! I must!” The many attempts to probe Hitler’s mind retrospectively have produced a bewildering array of inconclusive, conflicting diagnoses. But whatever the wellsprings of his mentality may have been, he was drawn onward throughout his strange political career by the unshakable conviction that reality would eventually conform to his will. He was, in his own eyes, a man of destiny. Despite the setbacks he had suffered during 1932, Hitler ap¬ proached the new year defiantly resolved to hold to his all-or-nothing course. He spent the last days of December at his alpine retreat, dictating a New Year’s statement and then reading it aloud to Joseph Goebbels and other members of his retinue to get their reactions. Its primary purpose was to provide a defense of the all-or-nothing strat¬ egy that had left him empty-handed at the end of 1932. With the shrewdness that made him such a formidable political tactician, Hitler gave his analysis of the motives that had led President von Hindenburg in November to offer him the chancellorship if he could muster a majority coalition in the Reichstag: “They want to give us a share of government, burden us with responsibility, but withhold from us a really decisive role. . . . For if our opponents invite us to take part in such a government, then they do it not with the intention of slowly and gradually giving us power but rather in the expectation that they will thereby forever wrest power from us.” Hitler’s pronouncement left no doubt about his determination to hold to the same course in the new year. “Any compromise,” he warned, “bears within it the seeds of destruction of the party and 3 6\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched therefore of Germany’s future. ... I am unalterably resolved not to purchase the thin gruel of participation in a cabinet by selling out our movement’s entitlement to power.” Without mentioning Gregor Strasser by name, he likened those Nazis who favored settling for a mere share of power to the “traitors on the home front” who had, he alleged, at the end of World War I led the Germans to believe they would receive a just peace settlement from the treacherous foreign foes who then imposed the Versailles Treaty. Goebbels, who enthusi¬ astically endorsed his leader’s no-compromise strategy, extolled the pronouncement in his diary: “Scathing toward the defeatists . . . Struggle to the knife . . . Radical to the utmost.”\n\nALTHOUGH on New Year’s Day Hitler’s defiant “Battle Message\n\nfor 1933” dominated the frontpage of his party’s newspaper, Volkischer\n\nBeobachter, the Nazis were not ready for an early showdown with the Schleicher cabinet. This became evident on January 4, when the Reichstag’s agenda committee met to decide when to reconvene the chamber. Attending the meeting on behalf of the cabinet, Schleicher’s chief chancellory aide, Erwin Planck, struck a confident pose. The cabinet was prepared, he announced, to appear before the Reichstag at any time in order to state its policies. When that time came, Planck added, the cabinet would expect a clarification of the political situation on the part of the chamber and would oppose another adjournment before votes were taken on no-confidence motions. In response to this challenge, the spokesmen of the Communists and the Social Demo¬ crats presented motions calling for resumption of the chamber’s ses¬ sions early the following week. Since those parties had already gone on record in favor of a no-confidence vote, they thus indicated their determination to topple the cabinet. By contrast, the Nazi spokesmen showed no interest in a quick test of strength. They proposed leaving the decision on when to reconvene to the presiding officer of the Reichstag, the Nazi Hermann Goring, an arrangement that predict¬ ably found no support from any other party. The reason for the Nazis’ lack of eagerness to reconvene the\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nReichstag seemed obvious to observers outside the party. An early meeting of the parliament would predictably result in no-confidence motions. Given the Nazis’ denunciations of the Schleicher cabinet, they would have to support those motions or lose all credibility. If, as all signs indicated would be the case, the chancellor then responded by dissolving the Reichstag elected in November, the Nazis would face the daunting prospect of further losses in a new election. Anx¬ ious to stave off that possibility, the party’s spokesmen on the agenda committee therefore withheld their votes from the motions of the Communists and Social Democrats, both of which failed. The issue was finally resolved when the spokesmen of the two leftist parties backed a Catholic Center Party motion to reconvene the parliament on January 24, with the proviso that the agenda committee meet again to review the matter on January 20. That same day, January 4, Hitler arrived in the Rhenish univer¬ sity town of Bonn early in the morning by overnight train from Munich, accompanied by several other prominent Nazis. This desti¬ nation left his press secretary, Otto Dietrich, baffled. He had been informed that the purpose of Hitler’s trip was to deliver speeches in the campaign for the local legislative election in the tiny state of Lippe, which lay considerably to the north and east of Bonn and would have been more easily reached by a different rail route. The traveling group was met at the Bonn station by Hitler’s large chauffeured MercedesBenz limousine and driven to one of his favorite hostelries, the Hotel Dreesen in nearby Bad Godesberg, for breakfast. Disclosing nothing about his intentions, Hitler, accompanied by three of his companions, was then picked up by a second car with drawn shades. His destination remained unknown to Dietrich and the others, who followed his instructions to proceed northward later with his limousine to a point on a highway two miles north of the city of Cologne, where they were to await him. That afternoon the car that had picked up Hitler and his three companions delivered them to the specified rendezvous point. From the conversation on the drive to Lippe, Otto Dietrich later recounted,\n\n3 8\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched it could be assumed that a meeting with some important political figure had been the cause of Hitler’s secretive behavior. Indeed, what had happened would soon occasion a national sensation, for the politi¬ cian in question had, only a few months earlier, been the target of some of the Nazis’ most vitriolic invective. He was former chancellor Franz von Papen. Papen’s background made him an unlikely candidate for a crucial role in high politics. Descended from a venerable but obscure Catholic noble family from Westphalia in western Germany, he, like his grand¬ father and father, had initially embarked upon a military career. An accomplished horseman who excelled as a steeplechase rider, Papen trained as a cavalry officer before attending the Berlin War Academy and gaining admission in 1913 to the General Staff. In the course of his military career he befriended his fellow officer Kurt von Schleicher, who was three years younger than he. Through family connections Papen met and married the daughter of a successful manufacturer whose wealth enabled the young officer to travel widely and become fluent in both English and French. Assigned to the German embassy in Washington, D.C., as military attache shortly before war broke out in 1914, Papen gained notoriety when he was expelled from the United States a year later for complicity in attempts to foment strikes by workers of German and Austrian origin at American factories produc¬ ing armaments for sale to the British and French. During the war he served on the western front and with the German forces that fought alongside the Turks against the British in Palestine. By the end of the war he had risen to the rank of major. After the revolution of 1918—19 Papen aligned himself politically with a reactionary, agrarian minority in the Catholic Center Party that disapproved of the party’s participation in republican coalition gov¬ ernments with the Social Democrats. In 1921 he gained election to the Prussian state parliament as the deputy for a rural constituency in Westphalia which reelected him for another four-year term in 1924. Backed by the financial resources of conservative Catholic noblemen, he gained control of his party’s newspaper in the capital, Germania„ He\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nmoved in aristocratic social circles in Berlin but played no prominent political role until Schleicher secured his appointment as chancellor in June 1932. The Catholic Center’s hostile break with Papen after he accepted that office without its leadership’s permission left him with¬ out the support of a party. Describing in his memoirs the reaction to the news of Papen s appointment as German chancellor, the French ambassador, Andre Fran^ois-Poncet, wrote: “No one wanted to believe it, and then, when the news was confirmed, everyone either laughed or smiled.” The ambassador, who knew Papen at first hand, described him tellingly: “He has the distinction of not being taken at all seriously either by his friends or his enemies. His face bears the mark of an ineradicable frivolity of which he has never been able to rid himself. As for the rest, he is not a personality of the first rank. ... He is regarded as superficial, mischief-making, deceitful, ambitious, vain, crafty, given to intrigue. One quality he clearly possesses: cheek, audacity, an amiable audacity of which he seems unaware. He is one of those persons who shouldn’t be dared to undertake a dangerous enterprise because they accept all dares, take all bets. If he succeeds, he bursts with pleasure; if he fails, he exits with a pirouette. Following his initial meeting with Chancellor von Papen in November 1932, the Swiss envoy in Berlin wrote: “I left Herr von Papen with the impression of having spoken with a really glib man who cannot be blamed if one gets bored in his presence. Whether this should be the principal trait of the man who today governs Germany is, to be sure, another question.” After a conversation with Papen during January 1933, the British ambassador, Sir Horace Rumbold, expressed “the wonder of an observer that the destinies of this great country should have been, even for a short time, in charge of such a light weight.” Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of the postwar West German republic, who first met Papen in the early ’20s as a fellow Center Party politician, later recalled: “I always gave him the benefit of mitigating circumstances in view of his enormous limitations.” 40\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched Despite these unflattering assessments, Papen cut a fine figure in Berlin society circles. There his impeccable manners and his cosmopol¬ itan flair combined with his linguistic facility and endless store of light conversation to make him sought after. Those qualities also won him admission to the circle of officers that included Kurt von Schleicher, and the two spent many leisure hours together during the latter’s rise to prominence. Within that group Papen was frequently addressed as “Franzchen,” a playfully condescending diminutive. As ambassador Fran^ois-Poncet observed, “Papen sometimes served as the butt of their jokes; they enjoyed making fun of him and teasing him, without his taking offense.” After his elevation to the chancellorship, Papen quickly ingrati¬ ated himself with President von Flindenburg. Among the numerous contemporaries who noticed this was Ambassador Fran^ois-Poncet. In his memoirs he observed: “It’s he who is the preferred one, the favorite of the marshal; he diverts the old man through his vivacity, his playfulness; he flatters him by showing him respect and devotion; he beguiles him with his daring; he is in [Hindenburg’s] eyes the perfect gentleman.” Only with great reluctance and a tearful scene did the president part with Papen at the end of his chancellorship. In a break from past practice with departing chancellors, Hindenburg expressed his sense of loss in a personal letter to Papen and presented him with an autographed photograph of himself embellished in his own hand with the refrain from a well-known sentimental soldier’s song about a fallen comrade. The friendship between Schleicher and Papen came under in¬ creasing strain during the latter’s chancellorship and ended with his fall at the hands of his patron. The general had proposed Papen for that high office in the belief that he would be able to control him. His personal opinion of his protege’s abilities was not high. When, upon Papen’s appointment, an acquaintance of both men pointed out to Schleicher that his choice for the chancellorship was not renowned for having a good head on his shoulders, the general reportedly re¬ sponded: “He doesn’t need a head; he’s a hat!” The assertiveness that\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\nPapen began to display once he was in office therefore suiprised and annoyed Schleicher. On one occasion, after talking with Chancellor von Papen on the telephone in his capacity as defense minister, the general turned to his aides and quipped in rueful fashion.\n\nWhat do\n\nyou say about that, Franzchen has discovered himself.” After engineering Papen’s fall and taking his place as chancellor, Schleicher sought to mollify his discarded protege. In a December radio address to the nation, he praised his predecessor as a “knight without fear or blemish.” In a New Year’s telegram he extended felicitations to “my dear Franzchen,\n\napostrophizing him as\n\ndecisive battles of the old year.\n\nthe bannei-beaiei in\n\nBut although Papen concealed his\n\nfeelings behind outward forms of cordiality, friendship on his side had given way to seething enmity toward the man who had propelled him into the limelight and then discarded him. Having tasted power, Papen wanted it again. He also thirsted for revenge against his former friend and patron Schleicher. Counting on Hindenburg’s continuing affection, Papen saw himself returning to office and realizing the mission the president had originally assigned him by becoming chancellor of a cabinet that would unite conserva¬ tives and Nazis. In pursuit of that goal he had, during the final stages of his chancellorship, established communications with the Nazi leader¬ ship through intermediaries. By way of enticement, he led them to believe that he would be willing to see the leadership of a rightist cabinet eventually assigned to Hitler.^nowing of Hindenburg s out¬ spoken aversion to the Nazi leader, Papen could assume that a Hitler chancellorship would never come to pass. That would leave Nazi support for his return to the chancellorship as the only feasible means to achieve a rightist cabinet of the sort the president wanted. In mid-December Papen glimpsed an opportunity to arm himself for a political comeback. Following a speech to the exclusive Gentle¬ men’s Club of Berlin—the Herrenklub—in which he expressed regret that attempts to form a cabinet including the Nazis had failed, he fell into conversation with one of the audience, Baron Kurt von Schroder, a banker from Cologne and a Nazi sympathizer. Papen revealed 42\n\nA Conspiracy against the Chancellor Is Hatched to Schroder his resentment toward Schleicher. The ex-chancellor re¬ ported, moreover, that the general’s underhanded methods had offended Hindenburg, whereas he himself still enjoyed the confidence of the president. Despite the Nazis’ attacks on him during his chancel¬ lorship, Papen indicated to the banker his readiness to meet with Hitler. These disclosures by Papen set in motion the developments that led to his meeting with Hitler in Cologne on January 4, 1933. Baron Schroder at once telephoned news of what Papen had told him to a Nazi intermediary, who then conveyed the report to Hitler. The Nazi leader recognized in the unexpected proposal a chance to escape from the political dead end he had reached. By conspiring with Papen he could hope to make use of the former chancellor’s influence with President von Hindenburg for his own purposes. It was even conceiv¬ able that Papen might be an emissary from the president. But regard¬ less of who was behind the invitation, it opened enticing possibilities. Beforehand, Hitler’s only available move was to have his party join in a vote of no confidence against the Schleicher cabinet when the Reich¬ stag reconvened. If, as expected, a majority ranging from Nazis to Communists supported such a move, thereby bringing about a disso¬ lution of the chamber and new parliamentary elections, he had to face the very real possibility of further losses at the polls. But if, with Papen’s help, he could become chancellor before a new election, he would escape from his predicament and attain his goal. If that could be accomplished, he need no longer fear another round of national balloting. Indeed, an election campaign conducted with the formula ‘Hindenburg-Hitler’ promised handsome gams. Hitler therefore agreed to meet with the former chancellor. During the last week of December intermediaries for the two men made arrangements for a rendezvous at Schroder’s residence in Co¬ logne. That location fit the travel plans of the two former politi¬ cal enemies and also promised to facilitate the secrecy insisted upon by the Nazis. At first, Hitler’s intermediary specified to Schroder that the meeting take place after dark so as to minimize the danger of\n\nhitler’s\n\nthirty\n\ndays\n\nto\n\npower\n\ndetection, but it was finally set for midday on Wednesday, January 4, to accommodate Hitler’s travel schedule. Upon arriving at Baron von Schroder’s palatial townhouse, the two former political foes were closeted for several hours. Their host sat in on much of their conversa¬ tion but took no part, while Hitler’s three companions waited else¬ where in the house. According to Schroder’s later account, Hitler at once took the offensive by raising a number of old grievances. With particular bitter¬ ness he upbraided Papen for having led President von Hindenburg to deny him the chancellorship despite his party’s triumph in the Reich¬ stag election of the previous July. Reversing the facts, Papen re¬ sponded that Schleicher, not he, had been responsible for blocking Hitler’s appointment, whereas he had favored it. As Hitler disclosed to Goebbels a few days later, Papen revealed an implacable hostility toward Schleicher. ‘'He wants to bring about his fall and get rid of him completely,” Goebbels noted in his diary. Papen also informed Hitler that the president had reservations about Schleicher and had not yet provided him with a decree authorizing him to dissolve the Reichstag. Most importantly, Papen gave Hitler to understand that he himself still exercised influence over Hindenburg. As Goebbels put it after hearing Hitler’s report: “He has the old man’s ear.” When Papen and Hitler turned to the future, they identified a broad area of accord. They quickly established that they were"
