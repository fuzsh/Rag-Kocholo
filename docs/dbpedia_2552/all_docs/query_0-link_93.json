        "text": "We know so much about Adolf Hitler. We probably have more information— facts, details, and minutiae—about this man’s life than any other major figure of modern times. Nonetheless, we still feel that we do not know the man. His life is one of the greatest mysteries in human history. Why is it that Hitler, about whom more facts and details are known than perhaps any other figure in modern history (perhaps in all history), remains such a mystery? Hitler frustrated his opponents, amazed neutral observers, and delighted his supporters by pulling off the seemingly “impossible”. He never would have made it into power except by accomplishing these five “impossibilities”; and it was this, more than anything else, that bound his supporters to him, gave him an aura of exceptionality, and catapulted this otherwise ugly little man into power. This article will illustrate that five “impossibilities” and their influence on Hitler’s personality: The Early Years: 1919-1923; The Putsch Trial; The Refounding of the Party; The Political Earthquake of 1930 and his ascent to power."
