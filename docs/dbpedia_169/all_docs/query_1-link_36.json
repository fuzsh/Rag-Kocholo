The species are the first representative of the genus, as well as the first Conoidea from the hydrothermal vents studied anatomically. Anatomy of the digestive system falls within the variability range of subfamily Daphnellinae. No specific anatomical characters, which may be due to the living on hydrothermal vents were found."
