        "text": "Benthic communities\n\nThe inventory of all the benthic fauna found in the community is presented in Table 1. It is composed of 10 phyla, 32 families and 43 species among which at least 7 species are new to science. In the Mollusca phyla, no bivalves were found except 1 Thyasira sp. shell, whereas at least 12 species of gastropods were present including 2 new species. In the Annelida phyla, only the polychaete class was sampled with 11 species of which at least 3 were new. Most of the arthropods were not identified to species level although several species were found in each of the 8 orders. The five decapod species were those commonly found on MAR hydrothermal vents.\n\nThe benthic-megafauna community observed is dominated by two species, namely the sea-anemone Ma. rimicarivora and the chaetopterid Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. These species form large populations on different substrata, such as the walls of active and old chimneys and on old pieces of fallen chimneys and for the most part covered by hydrothermal sediments.\n\nSpecimens were sampled at 4 sites: on the eastern part (SE1) and on the western part (W) of the ‘Anemone garden’, at the base of the ‘Long chimney’ (SE2) and in the sediment 2 m east (E) of the ‘Anemone garden’ (Figure 4). These four sites can be distinguished on the videos (Figures 4 & 5): the first (SE1) was at the base of active and fresh sulphide chimneys; the second (W) was also very similar but covered by grey hydrothermal sediment, probably stemming from the three black smokers; the third (SE2) was characterized by very black hydrothermal sediment covering pieces of hard substratum, and the last (E) was composed of two layers, a top layer 8-cm thick composed of orange-brown oxidized sediment and an underlying grey one.\n\nThe polychaete chaetopterid was observed in dense mats at the base of the chimneys. This polychaete, Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov., can be recognized easily by its long tube from which two long white palps sometimes protrude. Video films and sampled specimens showed that chaetopterids conformed to a pattern with regard to sediment coverage. At SE1 they seemed to be clean, fat and healthy, and the tube annelations were clearly observed; however, on the western part of the ‘Anemone garden’ (W) the chaetopterids were also fat and healthy but specimens and tubes were incrusted by hydrothermal sediment and covered with a white bacterial mat; at SE2 the chaetopterids were very thin and completely incrusted by hydrothermal sediment; and finally, in the eastern part of the ‘Anemone garden’ (E), only transparent empty chaetopterid tubes were sampled.\n\nEntire sampled polychaete populations were identified at the four sites described previously. The highest diversity was found at SE1 (8 families) where Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. was the dominant polychaete with amphinomid and capitellid families. At W Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. were the only dominant species. However, Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. were almost absent or dead at SE2 and in the hydrothermal sediment on the eastern part of the Anemone garden (E). In addition, it is noteworthy that: (1) a group of scavenger Archinome sp. was seen on the video at the bottom of site SE1 where a hundred Archinome sp. were sampled; and (2) that two Ampharetids, Amathys lutzi and Glyphanostomum sp. nov., and Spionid Prionospio sp. were particularly abundant at SE2. The latter species was also sampled in relatively high abundance in blade cores in the sediment at SE2 and E where the only other polychaete family found was Ampharetidae.\n\nThree species of alvinocaridid shrimps were found in order of decreasing abundance on the walls of active or fresh sulphide chimneys: Mirocaris fortunata, Chorocaris chacei (identified onboard from videos), and very few Rimicaris exoculata. Only isolated individuals of the latter species were observed, with only seven specimens being collected at SE1. Conversely, Mi. fortunata was observed in a ring around the ‘Anemone garden’ whose chimneys are composed of black and fresh sulphurs. They were present at the two sampled sites, SE1 and W, located close to this ring. Mirocaris fortunata were seen swimming between chaetopterid tubes at SE1 while they were neither seen nor sampled at SE2 and E.\n\nGastropods were sampled everywhere at Ashadze-1. Similar diversity was found at SE1 on the hard substratum and at the base of the ‘Long chimney’ (SE2), characterized by very black hydrothermal sediment covering pieces of old chimneys. Quite high numbers of dead gastropods were found at these two sites. At SE2 no gastropod was visible on the video films due to the thick layer of particles, even after zooming in. However, 2/3 of gastropod specimens were sampled at SE2, with Sutilizona pterodon making up more than half of them. This species, as well as Lepetodrilus atlanticus, Lirapex costellatus and Lirapex sp. were not sampled at any other site. Protolira thorvaldssoni was also sampled in notably high quantities at SE2. Only four species were sampled throughout the three sites W, SE1 and SE2: Peltospira smaragdina, P. thorvaldssoni, Shinkailepas briandi and Pseudorimula midatlantica in decreasing order of abundance. Four different species of scavenger or predator gastropod Phymorhynchus spp. were present at SE1, whereas only one or two were sampled at SE2 and W.\n\nAt the base of the ‘Anemone garden’ in a temperature zone around 3.5°C, the ophiuroid Ophioctenella acies and the scavenger pycnogonid Sericosura heteroscela were common among chaetopterid polychaetes. Occurrences of the galatheid Munidopsis exuta were plotted from our black and white images. These galatheids were most common at the periphery of the active centre, especially on very oxidized-sulphide structures. Predators included the crab Segonzacia mesatlantica and the zoarcid fish Pachycara thermophilum.\n\nIn brief, we found that benthic communities were most diverse and abundant at the ‘Anemone garden’ in the eastern part (SE1) as well as in the western part (W). At W a bacterial mat covered faunal populations and diversity seemed to be lower than at SE1. In the sediment (E) further away from the low fluid venting of the ‘Anemone garden’, no specimens were collected apart from empty chaetopterid tubes and one polychaete family. Conversely, many specimens were collected from the sediment at the bottom of the strong fluid venting of the ‘Long chimney’ (SE2).\n\nAshadze-1 benthic communities\n\nDeep-sea hydrothermal communities are usually distributed in concentric rings around vent openings: bacterial feeders on chimney walls, symbiotic species in the intermediate area of diffuse venting and filter feeding organisms on the external rings (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002). This scheme did not appear to be reproduced in the Ashadze-1 vent field as the diffuse venting area was not colonized by organisms living in symbiotic association with primary producers.\n\nThe striking difference between Ashadze-1 and other hydrothermal macrofaunal communities on the NMAR is the sharp numerical dominance of the sea-anemone Ma. rimicarivora, reaching densities of 32 ind.m−2. This species was especially abundant on chimney walls near the shimmering fluid. Sea-anemones are usually considered as peripheral species at hydrothermal vents occupying the zone of oxidized sulphides (Copley et al., Reference Copley, Tyler, Van Dover, Schultz, Dickson, Singh and Sulanowska1999). At TAG Ma. rimicarivora occurred in a concentric pattern at a distance from 15 to 60 m around the central chimney complex and reached the highest density of 20 ind.m-2 at 30–40 m from the centre of a black smoker zone. Maractis rimicarivora is known to be a typical cnidarian, depending on prey for energy and nutrients, with no evidence of bacterial symbiosis (Van Dover et al., Reference Van Dover, Polz, Robinson, Cavanaugh, Kadko and Hickey1997; Fautin & Barber, Reference Fautin and Barber1999). It is a suspension feeder and predator, feeding on small zooplankton and particulate organic material. At TAG it has also been seen preying on the shrimp R. exoculata (Van Dover et al., Reference Van Dover, Polz, Robinson, Cavanaugh, Kadko and Hickey1997). The effect of temperature on the distribution of sea-anemones was investigated at TAG. The negative correlation between the abundance of anemones and the mean temperature recorded over a one year period suggest that the distribution of sea-anemones may be ultimately constrained by a maximum thermal tolerance of 25°C. However, in the absence of physiological investigations, ecological interactions such as shrimp aggregations in higher-temperature areas preventing the settlement of sea-anemones were suggested (Copley et al., Reference Copley, Jorgensen and Sohn2007). At the Ashadze-1 vent field, Ma. rimicarivora indeed occurred on oxidized chimney walls where swarms of R. exoculata were expected. We measured a temperature of 3°C at the surface of Ma. rimicarivora at SE1 in the ‘Anemone garden’.\n\nThe quasi-absence of the shrimp R. exoculata at Ashadze-1 may be a consequence of the low temperature on chimney walls, ranging from 3 to 10°C. The optimal thermal habitat of R. exoculata would be around 20°C taking into account its physiological thermal tolerance and the chemosynthetic activity of shrimp epibionts (Ravaux et al., Reference Ravaux, Gaill, Le Bris, Sarradin, Jollivet and Shillito2003; Schmidt et al., Reference Schmidt, Le Bris and Gaill2008a). At TAG and Rainbow, temperature measurements ranged from 3 to 18°C in shrimp swarms (Schmidt et al., Reference Schmidt, Vuillemin, Le Gall, Gaill and Le Bris2008b). Juveniles were observed to colonize the colder zones further away from black smoke emissions (Gebruk et al., Reference Gebruk, Southward, Kennedy and Southward2000). At Ashadze-1 only very few R. exoculata could be observed and sampled. They were restricted to the site labelled SE1 in the ‘Anemone garden’ situated in the non-oxidized part of the chimney. The absence of dense shrimp aggregations at Ashadze-1 could also be the result of a recent environmental change, in terms of months or years, caused by a shift in the pattern of hydrothermal activity. This has already been suggested to explain the absence of dense shrimp aggregations at Broken Spur (Murton & Van Dover, Reference Murton and Van Dover1993). Rimicaris exoculata can disappear very quickly as has been seen at 5°S on SMAR, where a large platform was densely populated by shrimps in 2005, but hardly any shrimps were observed on the same structure in 2006 (Haase et al., Reference Haase, Petersen, Koschinsky, Seifert, Devey, Keir, Lackschewitz, Melchert, Perner, Schmale, Süling, Dubilier, Zielinski, Fretzdorff, Garbe-Schönberg, Westernströer, German, Shank, Yoerger, Giere, Kuever, Marbler, Mawick, Mertens, Stöber, Walter, Ostertag-Henning, Paulick, Peters, Straus, Sander, Stecher, Warmuth and Weber2007).\n\nAnother symbiotic species missing at Ashadze-1 was the mussel Bathymodiolus sp.: neither live bivalves nor shells were found on this vent field. This absence can be explained by two hypotheses: (1) very high production of suspended mineral particles at this vent field could negatively affect the filtering activity of bivalves and result in their absence, as was described for Rainbow (Desbruyères et al., Reference Desbruyères, Biscoito, Caprais, Colaço, Comtet, Crassous, Fouquet, Khripounoff, Le Bris, Olu, Riso, Sarradin, Segonzac and Vangriesheim2001); and (2) although great precautions were taken to ensure the complete coverage of the area, we did not have enough time to survey a sector south of the active field. It is possible that we missed a population of bathymodiolid mussels in the area, as was the case at Lost City where an enormous field of sub-fossil mussel shells was found on the slope of the Atlantis massif near the active field three years after its discovery (Sagalevitch et al., Reference Sagalevitch, Bogdanov, Bortnikov, Silantyev, Galkin and Lein2005).\n\nPhyllochaetopterus sp. nov. were found in very high densities, essentially on hard substratum. Sampled specimens were particularly healthy in areas where few hydrothermal sediments had accumulated, i.e. on the ‘Anemone garden’. However, chaeropterid species are generally reported in high densities in mud and sandy bottoms in intertidal areas (Nishi, Reference Nishi2008). Until today, only a few species have been observed in hydrothermal deep seawater and at very low densities on the MAR. During the French EXOMAR cruise in 2005, another genus, Spiochaetopterus sp., was seen in low densities at TAG in a similar habitat: on blocs buried under hydrothermal oxidized particles with several Ma. rimicarivora scattered around (Fabri, personal observation). Chaetopterid tube worms have never been reported on the East-Pacific Rise but were observed in high densities in the vicinity of an active vent on the Pacific–Antarctic Ridge near the Foundation Seamount Chain (Stecher et al., Reference Stecher, Turkay and Borowski2002). Like all chaetopterid polychaetes, Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. are a tubicolous species. The branches of the tube are probably used to modify the movement of water passing through it, carrying food particles. These particles are then trapped by mucus bags secreted by the polychaete. Both palps, seen outside the tube in videos, are also used but to a lesser extent, to seize the food in the environment (Barnes, 1965). The weak hydrothermal activity and high particle flow characterizing Ashadze-1 seems to be favourable to the development of this polychaete family.\n\nFour species of the predatory gastropod Phymorhynchus spp. were present, among which one new species was discovered. These gastropods are often observed at the periphery of dying vents and are known to feed on mussels, shrimp remains, other gastropods and polychaetes (Desbruyères et al., Reference Desbruyères, Segonzac and Bright2006; A. Waren, personal communication). The gastropod Peltospira smaragdina was sampled all over Ashadze-1, but the ones taken from SE1 were all dead. They contained dust-like rust-coloured sediment and had evidently been buried for some time. It appeared as though they had suffocated (A. Waren, personal communication). On the contrary L. atlanticus was not as dirty and rusty as most of the specimens from SE1. It was in very good condition, although the soft parts were missing. The presence of a single L. atlanticus shell is the first specimen seen between Snake Pit and the newly discovered vent field at 5°S on the MAR (Haase et al., Reference Haase, Petersen, Koschinsky, Seifert, Devey, Keir, Lackschewitz, Melchert, Perner, Schmale, Süling, Dubilier, Zielinski, Fretzdorff, Garbe-Schönberg, Westernströer, German, Shank, Yoerger, Giere, Kuever, Marbler, Mawick, Mertens, Stöber, Walter, Ostertag-Henning, Paulick, Peters, Straus, Sander, Stecher, Warmuth and Weber2007). Lepetodrilids have long been considered vent-endemic animals but they have recently been found at seeps and on sunken wood (Johnson et al., Reference Johnson, Waren and Vrijenhoek2008). These tiny gastropods are usually sampled as by-catches with the larger vent taxa, especially bivalve molluscs in the Atlantic Ocean, on which these limpets reside. At Ashadze-1 L. atlanticus was sampled with a piece of chimney by the grabbing arm of the submersible. Usually, the shells disappear quite rapidly in vents, in contrast to seeps and regular deep sea beds, so it is possible that an event occurred at Ashadze-1 relatively recently (A. Waren, personal communication).\n\nMost species of Galatheid are scavengers not restricted to hydrothermal vents. They usually occur in low densities and their abundance in vent environments probably reflects the benefit derived from the organic matter produced by the chemosynthetic community inhabiting these zones. In general, their abundance increases in the vicinity of active hydrothermal sites and decreases in the centre of hydrothermal activity, which is what we found at Ashadze-1.\n\nTo sum up, the hydrothermal community at Ashadze-1 lacks symbiotic species (except for single R. exoculata) that are characteristic of the deep-sea hydrothermal fields on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This absence is partially counterbalanced by unusually rich development in the active zone of peripheral species such as Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov. and Ma. rimicarivora. Moreover many scavengers such as Phymorhynchus spp., Ophioctenella acies and Munidopsis exuta colonize substrates in the active zone. Previous work focused on the life-cycle of a hydrothermal vent ecosystem from its initial colonization, growth and development of the community, followed by its demise (Van Dover, Reference Van Dover2003). Knowing the characteristics of a waning stage ecosystem, i.e. gathering of scavengers and invasion by non-vent deep-sea taxa, we believe that Ashadze-1 is such an ecosystem. High faunal diversity at the Ashadze-1 vent field emphasizes the fact that diversity is similar at declining and at active vent fields, and is maintained by non-chemosynthetic taxa invading the field owing to the low level of toxic sulphides (Van Dover, Reference Van Dover2002).\n\nWith regard to the fact that deep-sea hydrothermal vents are patchy and ephemeral environments, with individual vents lasting only a few years or decades (Micheli, 2002), and taking into account the faunal characteristics of this ecosystem and the accumulation of particles at the base of ‘Long chimney’ we assume that the formation of the latter occurred rapidly due to the sudden intensification of the fluid flow that led to the burial of the ecosystem developing around it. This assumption is supported by the fact that although fauna were not visible at the surface of the sediment, apart for a few emerging sea-anemones, specimens were found when sampling the layer of hydrothermal particles. Both live and dead gastropods were found in this thick layer of particles at the bottom of the ‘Long chimney’, whereas they usually live on hard substrata; also chaetopterids were very thin and completely black. Conversely, polychaetes were healthier at SE1, which is 15 m from ‘Long chimney’, and is probably a more favourable environment for their development with lower particle accumulation. Health appeared to decrease as the thickness of particles lessened, going from ‘Long chimney’ to W, the western part of the ‘Anemone garden’, and finally to SE1, the more remote eastern part. Site W was covered by a thin layer of particles, possibly originating from the ‘Long chimney’ and the first impact of its growth. The higher the chimney, the larger the area covered by particles. Moreover, only one bivalve shell was found in the sediment two meters from ‘Long chimney’. This may indicate that bivalves were present but buried due to the possible rapid growth of the chimney. As they are filter-feeders they may not have been able to survive with the massive sudden input of particles.\n\nTrophic position of consumers\n\nChemosynthetic-based ecosystem primary producers are known to be either sulphur-oxidizing chemosynthetic bacteria, methanotrophic bacteria and/or bacteria utilizing other reduced chemicals such as hydrogen or iron (Schmidt et al., Reference Schmidt, Vuillemin, Le Gall, Gaill and Le Bris2008b). Invertebrates acting as primary consumers are capable of exploiting these bacteria either through the ingestion of free-living chemoautotrophic bacteria, or via nutritional exchange with endosymbiotic chemoautotrophic-bacteria (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002; Bergquist et al., Reference Bergquist, Eckner, Urcuyo, Cordes, Hourdez, Macko and Fisher2007).\n\nNatural variations in stable isotopes have been widely used in marine ecology over the past twenty years to investigate the food web (Peterson & Fry, Reference Peterson and Fry1987; Conway et al., Reference Conway, Kennicutt, Van Dover, Lajtha and Michener1994). Stable carbon, nitrogen and sulphate isotopic ratios are commonly measured in order to evaluate the source of dietary carbon, trophic position and sulphate origin respectively (McCutchan et al., Reference McCutchan, Lewis, Kendall and McGrath2003).\n\nIn our study stable isotope ratios were measured on very few species, all of them being heterotrophic. Therefore, we did not try to construct the food web structure at Ashadze-1. However, we focused on the trophic position of these species through their isotopic ratios in order to support our hypotheses on the waning stage of this ecosystem. The tissue isotopic mean values of the four species at Ashadze-1 are compared to values measured for the same species at other vent fields on the NMAR (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002, De Busserolles et al., Reference De Busserolles, Sarrazin, Gauthier, Gélinas, Fabri, Sarradin and Desbruyères2009). Although carbon isotopic values fall into the range described for these species, nitrogen isotopic values are always higher at Ashadze-1 than at other vent fields.\n\nMaractis rimicarivora and Phymohynchus moskalevi at Ashadze-1 have similar isotopic values to that measured for the same species at TAG. δ13C isotopic mean values are the same and δ15N isotopic values are 2‰ higher at Ashadze-1. These values were already observed to be higher at TAG than at the other vent fields for these species (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002). Actinarians usually collected at the periphery of vent fields have a very positive δ15N signature, indicating that they occupy a high trophic level. They are believed to profit occasionally from the vent communities, but not exclusively. Phymorhynchus sp. are scavengers or predators, usually feeding on mussels at different vent fields, except at TAG where no mussels were found. Phymorhynchus sp. was then assumed to adapt and feed on dead shrimps, but is also known to feed on gastropods and polychaetes (A. Waren, personal communication).\n\nMirocaris fortunata has similar isotopic values at Ashadze-1 and at the Rainbow vent fields (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002). The δ13C isotopic values are the same and δ15N isotopic values are 2‰ higher at Ashadze-1. The δ13C isotopic values in this species have a very wide range—from −10.46 to 22.06—suggesting an opportunistic feeding strategy (Gebruk et al., Reference Gebruk, Southward, Kennedy and Southward2000). Mirocaris fortunata were described as predators and scavengers or detritus feeders on the strength of what was found in their stomachs (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002). They are assumed to prey on individuals that feed on free-living bacteria (De Busserolles et al., Reference De Busserolles, Sarrazin, Gauthier, Gélinas, Fabri, Sarradin and Desbruyères2009). They are also assumed to graze directly on free-living bacteria, as indicated by stable isotope signatures that can be around –10 to –11 (Gebruk et al., Reference Gebruk, Southward, Kennedy and Southward2000).\n\nPhyllochaetopterus sp. nov. has a similar δ13C minimum value and a δ15N value higher by 3.89‰ than that measured for chaetopterids at Logatchev (Colaço et al., Reference Colaço, Dehairs and Desbruyères2002). The wide range of δ13C measured for these polychaetes may be due to the fact that either whole individuals were kept for analyses (thus their gut content was not removed) or that their diet was composed of very diverse particulate organic matter (POM). POM at hydrothermal vents can be composed of body parts of invertebrates, faunal or microbial mucous secretions, microbial cell debris and photosynthetically derived material (Levesque & Juniper, Reference Levesque and Juniper2002). The increased contribution of large and heterogeneous POM has been shown to significantly contribute to the diet of organisms in areas of low fluid discharge or as a vent site ages (Limén et al., Reference Limén, Levesque and Juniper2007).\n\nCarbon isotopic ratios are assumed to allow determining the source of dietary carbon for an organism (Conway et al., Reference Conway, Kennicutt, Van Dover, Lajtha and Michener1994). As the δ13C values are in the same range at Ashadze-1 and at other vent fields on the NMAR, we can state that the four species for which isotopic ratios were measured at Ashadze-1 have the same food diet as that sampled at other NMAR fields. The generally very high δ15N values for the Ashadze-1 species suggest that their nitrogen source does not stem directly from local origin, but rather from recycled organic matter. Hence we can consider that these species play the same secondary consumer role in the ecosystems. The sulphur isotopic ratios of vent species are assumed to reflect their source isotopic values because isotope fractionation associated with the assimilation of sulphur compounds is thought to be small (Conway et al., Reference Conway, Kennicutt, Van Dover, Lajtha and Michener1994). The food web based on photosynthetically derived POM has sulphur isotopic values ranging from +10 to +20‰ while the sulphur isotopic values of the food web based on locally produced organic matter, vent sulphides, pore-water sulphides and thiosulphate, range from −11.5 to +13.4‰ (Brooks et al., Reference Brooks, Kennicutt, Fisher, Macko, Cole, Childress, Bidigare and Vetter1987). The mean δ34S isotopic ratios measured from animal tissues at Ashadze-1 ranged from +6.87 to +10.17‰, falling within the range of the δ34S ratios found for vent species.\n\nThe high trophic level of dominant species and the sulphur isotopic ratios reflecting vent sulphide origins support the hypothesis of a chemosynthetic ecosystem present at Ashadze-1, although no symbiotic species were seen during the Serpentine cruise. Two hypotheses can be put forward: (1) symbiotic species existed but were buried or consumed by detritus-feeder species like Ma. rimicarivora, Phyllochaetopterus sp. nov., Phymorhynchus sp. and Mi. fortunata, all of which were abundant; or (2) symbiotic species did not exist, perhaps owing to great depth, as free-living bacteria are the only component at primary producer level that constitute the food source of primary consumers. However, this trophic level was not very well represented as we could not find enough small crustaceans to feed this high proportion of secondary consumers, unless sea-anemones and shrimps are the primary consumers. Our opinion is that the first hypothesis better reflects the transfer of organic matter along the food chain."
