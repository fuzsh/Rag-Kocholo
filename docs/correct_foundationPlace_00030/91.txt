Introduction

What is Smart CityÂ

Smart City is the development of cities or urban areas in general towards an efficient place. Energy saving, usage of renewable energy, improving housing and mobility options are part of the plan for a a smaller carbon dioxide footprint. Higher accessibility and faster mobility should improve the quality of life of each individual engaging with smart cities.Â For the implementation of smart cities the use of multiple information and communication technologies are necessary, for example IoT is used to optimize operations.Â

What is Smart City Strategy

A Smart City Strategy is a document of each city or town in which the individual understanding and own approach for a Smart City is set. It includes the comprehensive plan of how a city adopts and leverages technology, data and innovative solutions to enhance the quality of life for its residents, improve urban services and infrastructure, and promote sustainability. The goal of a smart city strategy is a specific plan about how to use digital technologies and data-driven approaches to address urban challenges efficiently and effectively while fostering economic development and social well-being.

Foundation

Digital Infrastructure: A strong and reliable digital infrastructure, including high-speed internet connectivity, is essential for collecting, transmitting, and processing data from various sources. This infrastructure serves as the backbone of smart city initiatives.

Data and Information: Data is the core of smart cities. Cities need to collect, manage, and analyze data from sensors, IoT devices and various other sources. This data provides insights into urban operations and informs decision-making processes.

Connectivity: Reliable and widespread connectivity is crucial for enabling real-time data communication and interaction between devices and systems. This includes not only internet connectivity but also communication between devices through protocols like 5G.

Technology Integration: Smart city strategies often involve integrating various technologies and systems, such as sensor networks, data analytics platforms, and smart grids, to work together seamlessly. Compatibility and interoperability are key considerations.

Germany

Berlin is working on interconnected, intelligent solutions with a holistic approach especially for climate neutrality. Innovations are part of the city cleaning, transportation and water services for more efficiency. The website infralab is the result of this association, which organizes projects on behalf of Smart City Berlin. Berlin makes use of Iot for the energy supply for better communication. Data is used more often in the area of application in mobility, energy and living, because of an open data bank.Â

Berlin fully fulfills its role as capital city and thus also as role model in Smart City matters and even had an appearance at the Smart City Expo World in Barcelona.

USA

In the year 2015 it was announced that 160 million USD will be invested in federal research by the initiative âSmart Citiesâ. Â Problems and obstacles like congestion, climate change and improved economy will be tackled by new technology collaborations.

The goal of Los Angeles is to be digital and connected, it includes infrastructure, digital services, inclusion and governance. Some changes are the streetlamp development and the Utility Tracking Portal and many more. To realize these projects the usage of IoT is necessary.Â Services get improved by the usage of data with Computerized Statistics.Â 5G all overÂ the city is part of solutions for improved digital opportunities, Los Angeles will be the first large city in the USA that has 5G. This is helpful for the all digital platforms just like âL.A. Business Portalâ which should be installed till 2028.

Best Practice

Regensburg has five cornerstone projects, after a survey and voting in which citizens participated, for their Smart City strategy. This strategy is based on Neue Leipzig Charta and âRegensburg Plan 2040â to ensure a green, fair and productive future in this city. The goal of one of these projects âSmart Moveâ is ecological communal mobility. It includes a new mobility concept which is to be digitally supported and the winter services will be updated. Because of short-term and very pronounced cold and snow spells caused by global warming, the services have to get quicker and more flexible, this is supposed to be enabled with an electronic demand platform.

The city also works on a digital twin which recreates the electricity, heat, water consumption of buildings to enable ecological and economical energy supply. A digital twin refers to a virtual representation or digital counterpart of a real-world object, system, process, or entity.

Isarsofts Approach for Smart City

TrafficÂ

Traffic Management is corresponding with Smart Traffic, Congestion Reduction is the main goal of traffic management and corresponds mainly with: Traffic Signal Coordination and Traffic Flow Optimization. Improved Traffic Signal Timing enables a better Flow of Traffic because control systems traffic can be managed according to the circumstances. Traffic Flow is enhanced by improved infrastructure, which streamlines traffic volume. Traffic Infrastructure includes road signs, guidance systems and ultimately roads. By creating new road network and better interconnections the traffic will be streamlined and the flow improved.

Parking

Additional or optimized parking spaces have a positive influence on reduced Co2 because of shorter searches for spaces and higher chances for carsharing. Parking lot offer spaces to park own vehicles and switch to public transport. By using new technologies for optimizing or building parking spaces a more efficient approach is granted. The utilization rate is configured for every day at any given time. This enables better insights for planners to improve their projects.

Public Transport

By analyzing the customer utilization of transportation means the amount of necessary trips can get established. Improvements of the time schedule of transportation authorities based on data analysis have great impact on the efficiency. Only necessary trips, to the right time with, the optimal passenger load will save resources. Video Analytics and with it Isarsoft Perception have a great impact on the safety in train stations. Overcrowding is thereby prevented but also accidents like person on tracks get detected in real-time and can prevent worse.

Isarsoft Perception can have impact on Smart City, in areas of:

Data-Driven Decision Making

Data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is a process of making informed choices based on data analysis and empirical evidence rather than relying solely on intuition or personal experience. It involves collecting, processing, and interpreting relevant data to gain insights, identify trends, and inform decision-makers. This process is possible with Isarsoft Perception this enables a better planning result for the future but also a higher safety level. Potential treats get identified immediately and accidents can be prevented.

âPredictive Analytics

Based on historical data it is possible to forecast future events or trends by identifying patterns and make predictions about future outcomes. This facilitates the planning process of future constructions and schedule changes. To have historical data a data collection and data processing must be preceded.

BenefitsÂ

Besides the main goal of reducing the carbon dioxide emissions, Life-Quality is improved, better mobility and safety as well as economic growth are benefits of modern technologies used for smarter solutions. The main benefit of a Smart City Strategy is the solid foundation with a constructive goal building.

Considerations and SolutionsÂ

Smart city projects often focus on data as a way to track activities, measure consumption, learn about usage patterns, and optimize solutions. Maintaining the trust of public and private entities in regards of privacy is of paramount importance in order to further these concepts. Because privacy of user and customers is the top priority of Smart Cities, they have to follow strict laws and regulations.Â Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the privacy of citizens is necessary and to establish clear policies and regulations for data handling and sharing.

The solution of anonymization, real-time processing and translation of persons and their belonging into objectives is the solution of Isarsoft Perception. These objectives get translated into Key Performance Indicators which are shown on the dashboard.Â
