        "text": "To leave future generations a better world than the one we inherited, we must address climate change with solutions that acknowledge the unequal burdens that have been placed on communities of color and those who have been underserved and divested.\n\nClimate change is a global challenge. Yet cities, states, and regions are vital agents of change. That’s why Barr’s Climate Program focuses on advancing equitable solutions and leadership at the local level.\n\nTo address climate change we pursue three strategies:\n\nAccelerating the shift to clean energy\n\nTransforming our transportation system\n\nCreating climate resilient communities\n\nUnderlying these strategies is our belief that we will be more effective at addressing the climate crisis if we build a multi-racial and inclusive environmental movement. This is why we will prioritize communities that have suffered the most from the fossil fuel economy and climate organizations whose work is centered in equity. Read more on our strategies below.\n\nThe Barr Foundation’s Climate Program is actively working to expand its grantmaking to include more partners who are committed to centering racial equity in the climate movement.\n\nOur work is grounded in the belief that a diverse, inclusive, and equity-centered movement is essential to achieving our ambitious climate goals.\n\nWe will prioritize communities that have suffered the most from the fossil fuel economy and climate organizations whose work is centered in equity.\n\nWhile we most typically fund non-profit organizations, we are open to supporting other types of groups or organizations who are doing work that aligns with our strategies and goals.\n\nWe are especially interested in supporting people of color (POC)-led equity-centered organizations. We define equity-centered organizations as organizations that are building power in the communities they serve to address environmental racism.\n\nTo address climate change, we fund work related to these three topics:\n\nClean Energy – Accelerate the expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency; Geographic focus: New England\n\nMobility – Reduce transportation-related emissions; Geographic focus: Massachusetts\n\nClimate Resilience – Help greater-Boston prepare and adapt to climate change; Geographic focus: Greater Boston\n\nWhile these guide our work, we strive to take a collaborative approach to our grantmaking that recognizes that clean energy, mobility, and resilience are interconnected, especially in the ways they impact people’s lives.\n\nWe are most interested in putting our resources toward the following movement-building activities:\n\nEquitably reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improve the health and well-being of communities of color by improving air quality and access to clean, reliable, affordable energy and mobility options\n\nBuilding communities that are prepared for climate change, and protect and work for all people\n\nProviding career pathways and support for professionals of color working in the climate movement in our region\n\nInvesting in capacity-building of POC-led equity-centered organizations so that they can become stronger and healthier and build more power in the communities they serve\n\nSupporting an increase in the number of POC-led equity-centered organizations that are engaged in climate action\n\nFostering authentic and meaningful allyship among the legacy climate organizations\n\nEnsuring climate and environmental narratives are inclusive of diverse voices and center community needs, perspectives, and solutions\n\nHow to Express Interest\n\nPlease keep it short! We anticipate that we’ll receive more requests than we can support, so we want to be mindful about the amount of time we are asking you to invest in this initial submission. Review our inquiry form to see the questions that we’d like you to answer. You may submit an inquiry in either written, audio, or video form. Ideally, written content should be less than 1 page long. Audio or video content should be less than 5 minutes.\n\nWe’ll respond to you in a few weeks. We believe in the importance of conversation and do not want to be overly reliant on the written word. Once we receive your submission, we’ll get back to you in a few weeks to let you know whether or not we think your funding request might be a good match for our work.\n\nIf we choose to move forward, we’ll help you through the process. Please note that while under certain circumstances we may be able to expedite a funding request, there is generally a 5- to 6-month time period between our initial conversation and when a grant is approved/we send the first payment. This includes time needed to work with you on a proposal and for the proposal to be reviewed internally.\n\nSubmit an Inquiry\n\nQuestions: If you have questions about how to submit an inquiry, please contact ncasimir@barrfoundation.org."
