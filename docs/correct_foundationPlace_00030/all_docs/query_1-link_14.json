        "text": "Dear Birmingham,\n\nFor every dream home, every landmark, every awe-inspiring structure that reaches for our skies, there is an architect who laid the groundwork for that greatness.\n\nIt’s the duty of that architect to create an infrastructure that is safe, secure and can withstand the test of time. From the neighborhood in which the structure stands, to the residents who will walk its halls and call it home, every aspect must be measured and properly weighed.\n\nTo make history, you need a blueprint. It’s the roadmap to success.\n\nIn that spirit, I am honored to present to you with “The Blueprint,” a publication that embodies my vision for a path forward for our city’s success. As beneficiaries of a city where bloody battles were fought for freedom and justice, we owe a debt to create a community that will flourish for them, for us, and for all.\n\nWhen you elected me in 2017, we worked to create a strong foundation, which included dismantling outdated systems, renovating parks, repairing roads, and investing in our children’s futures. Now, two years into my second term, we’re beginning to see the fruits of that labor, but there’s so much more to be done.\n\nI often ask myself, “How can we architect a system that will serve residents spanning 99 neighborhoods, 23 communities, countless businesses, and schools?” It requires listening to their needs while building a team of servant leaders, advisors, and community partners.\n\nThis document delves into the hurdles, objectives, and opportunities we face. It gazes forward, outlining strategies to fortify our infrastructure with a robust plan.\n\nLooking ahead, our blueprint symbolizes rebuilding—restoring faith in our systems, supporting our youth, enhancing infrastructures, nurturing homeownership dreams, and cultivating entrepreneurship.\n\nTogether, let’s build a better, brighter, bolder Birmingham.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRandall L. Woodfin\n\nMayor, City of Birmingham\n\nREAD THE BLUEPRINT STRATEGIC UPDATE HERE.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nA Strategic Plan for Progress\n\nMayor Woodfin is honored to be elected to a second term as Mayor of the great City of Birmingham.\n\nThis publication, The First 100: A Citizen-Led Transition Report, represents the collective strength of community voice, alignment and goals in key areas of his administration.\n\nMayor Woodfin offers sincere thanks to the Transition Team co-chairs, subcommittee leaders, and residents who contributed to this report.
