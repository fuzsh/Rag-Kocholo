Membership is composed of academics, business practitioners, and consultants. The society has been credited with being a factor in the development of strategic management as a legitimate field of scholarly endeavor.[2] The SMS publishes the Strategic Management Journal, Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal and the Global Strategy Journal.\n\nThe Strategic Management Society was founded at an initial meeting in London in 1981. Founding officers were elected at a second conference held in Montreal in 1982, and the founding constitution was drawn and approved at the third meeting in Paris in 1983. There were 459 original founding members of the society.\n\nRussel Coff, 2017-2018\n\nMarjorie Lyles, 2015-2016\n\nBob Hoskisson, 2013-2014\n\nJay Barney, 2011-2012\n\nJoan Enric Ricart, 2009-2010\n\nMichael Hitt, 2007–2008\n\nRichard A.
