        "text": "The Pierre-Béique Fund, dedicated to the long-lasting success of the Orchestra, was launched on March 8, 1998, at a concert under the direction of Zubin Mehta. Established by Messrs. Pierre Brunet and Paul Desmarais and Senator E. Leo Kolber, the fund was named in honor of the man who served as general manager of the OSM from 1937 to 1970. The amounts invested in this fund are capitalized in perpetuity and protected from inflation. Every year, the foundation pays the Orchestra 3.5% of the average market value of the investments of the previous two years.\n\nThose amounts are devoted to the international reach of the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal, not only by financing its tours but also by enabling the OSM to invite, every year, the world’s most renowned soloists and conductors. Among other things, these sums have contributed to helping the OSM perform as part of the prestigious Salzburg festival (2018) and on a Nunavik Tour (2018), as well as in Europe, in 2019, in Germany, Belgium and France most prestigious concert halls.\n\nThe 2019 Tour of the Americas by the Orchestre symphonique de Montréal under Maestro Nagano, from September 28 to October 16, was the most recent of many such tours made possible through the support of the Fondation de l’OSM. After six years of absence from Latin American stages, the OSM made a distinctive comeback, touching audiences in eight different major concert halls with their own unique sound. The tour was a huge success for the OSM, confirming its status as one of the major orchestras of North America and a representative of Montreal’s cultural vitality.\n\n10 million and over\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nRio Tinto Alcan\n\n5 million and over\n\nAnonyme\n\nPower Corporation du Canada\n\nSojtecci II Ltée\n\n2 million and over\n\nHydro-Québec\n\nFondation J.
