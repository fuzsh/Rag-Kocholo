We look for innovative opportunities to invest in communities who are redesigning these systems in partnership with young people.\n\nWe have a long way to go in realizing a society where everyone has access to the American Dream. Ensuring our democracy works for all of us must go hand in hand with improving our public systems to live up to our country’s promise. We believe a robust, multiracial democracy should—and can—provide the goods, services, and policies needed for our communities to succeed."
