        "text": "The Buhl Foundation has committed to a place-based strategy to invest in the lives and futures of the residents of Mr. Buhl’s beloved Northside. The majority of Foundation funds are directed towards Pittsburgh’s 18 Northside neighborhoods that some 40,000 residents call home. The resident-driven initiative birthed from this commitment, One Northside, catalyzes and supports long-term sustainable change with particular emphasis on resourcing community members, young and old, to lead and create tangible change from within.\n\nThe success of One Northside will be found in the value of relationships and respect given to each individual and neighborhood. Working with thousands of Northside residents and community members, the One Northside strategy is grounded in five key pillars:\n\nEndowed with a sense of curiosity and flexibility, the vision for the Buhl Foundation was, and remains, one of transformational impact for the whole community of Pittsburgh. In addition to our commitment to the Northside of Pittsburgh, the Foundation remains sensitive to four major areas in our region:\n\nEducation\n\nInitiatives that foster learning environments critical to building a knowledgeable and talented population\n\nYouth Development\n\nProjects that provide opportunities for our young people to thrive, to be safe and to live in a nurturing environment.\n\nHuman Services\n\nStrategies where our resources make a difference in addressing persistent community challenges or unmet needs of at-risk neighborhoods.\n\nEconomic and Community Development\n\nEfforts that encourage innovation and entrepreneurial solutions to improve quality of life.\n\nHenry C. Frick Educational Fund\n\nIn 1993, the Henry Clay Frick Educational Commission announced its affiliation with the Buhl Foundation. As a result of the affiliation, the Commission was renamed the Henry C. Frick Educational Fund of the Buhl Foundation. The Frick Fund was established in 1909 by industrialist Henry C. Frick who suggested that “the fund be used in connection with public schools and for the improvement of work done therein.” Today, the Frick Fund continues to support grants for public schools from kindergarten to high school, especially serving disadvantaged and at-risk populations in the region. Specific interests include: science and math education, arts education, teacher professional opportunities and organization that promote strong public education leadership.\n\nMcCreery Memorial Fund\n\nThe McCreery Fund was established in 1938 by the will of Emilie McCreery in honor of her parents. The McCreery Fund joined the Buhl family of funds in 1955. Grants are available to nonprofits that focus on furthering musical education and music awareness for young people in the Pittsburgh region.\n\nFrick and McCreery grants are awarded in three year cycles. The next cycle begins July 1, 2021 and interested applicants should follow Buhl’s typical application requirements. Applications will be considered and reviewed in the Spring of 2021."
