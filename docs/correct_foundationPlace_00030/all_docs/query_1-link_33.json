        "text": "Our future\n\nKnowledge | Wisdom | Humanity\n\nThis new vision and strategic plan for The University of Manchester will take us into our third century. It builds on a rich heritage of discovery, social change and pioneering spirit that is at the heart of our University and our city region.\n\nLoading\n\n\"As a proud Manchester institution with a growing international reach, we have created this plan based on our fundamental belief that the purpose of our University is to deliver benefit to society and the environment, and to protect our unique status as an open place of enquiry and challenge.\"\n\nThe foundation of this vision and strategic plan remains our three core goals of research and discovery, teaching and learning, and social responsibility, which are encapsulated in our motto: knowledge, wisdom and humanity. It builds on our strengths while taking the University in new directions.\n\nIt points to a future where we will expand our world-leading research to address the most challenging global questions and exploit our capability for interdisciplinary research; transform the way our students learn to make them the most employable graduates and truly global citizens; and ensure that all our activities make a positive difference to society.\n\nThe strategic plan reinforces what already makes The University of Manchester distinctive: our excellence, openness and inclusivity, our longstanding commitment to social responsibility, our scale and breadth, our tradition of innovation, and our very close bonds with, and location at the heart of, Manchester.\n\nWe have built our vision and strategic plan on extensive consultation with colleagues, students, alumni, and regional and national stakeholders. This approach has ensured a shared creation of ideas and allowed us to test the resilience of the priorities that we have identified. It has also enabled us to explore and refine how to deliver them.\n\nThis is a vision and strategic plan of substance, supported by detailed delivery plans. Our success will be evidenced through independent measures of our core activities.\n\nUniversities such as ours are ideally positioned to help address many of the worldâs major challenges, finding new means to deliver environmental sustainability, close the gap of societal inequalities, improve health, inform and empower citizens, and create the leaders of the future.\n\nWhile the plan is broad in its scope, with stretching ambitions in many places, it contains clear priorities set within each theme and measurable outcomes. We will, of course, be agile and adaptable to external change, but we will hold onto the ambitions set out here to ensure that we are well placed for the future.\n\nNancy Rothwell, President and Vice-Chancellor\n\nEdward Astle, Chair of the Board of Governors\n\nOur story so far\n\n1824\n\nThe Manchester Mechanics' Institute opens to educate the city's working population.\n\n1880\n\nOwens College becomes the first part of the Victoria University, England's first civic university.\n\n1906\n\nAlready campaigning for votes for women, the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst becomes our first female law graduate.\n\n1917\n\nThe world's first artificial nuclear reaction, sometimes referred to as 'splitting the atom', is carried out by Ernest Rutherford.\n\n1948\n\nManchester appoints Britain's first black professor, the economist Arthur Lewis, later a Nobel laureate.\n\n1948\n\nComputing is born with the world's first stored-program computer. Alan Turing, pioneer of artificial intelligence, contributes to its software.\n\n1957\n\nThe Lovell Telescope is completed at Jodrell Bank. The observatory is declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2019.\n\n1970\n\nManchester becomes home to England's first nursing degree, with Jean McFarlane appointed England's first Chair of Nursing.\n\n2010\n\nAndre Geim and Kostya Novoselov receive the Nobel Prize in Physics and establish Manchester as the 'home of graphene'.\n\n2021\n\nManchester is named the world's number one university for social and environmental impact in the Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings.\n\n2024\n\nWe are placed 6th in the UK, 10th in Europe and 34th in the world in the QS World University Rankings.\n\n2024\n\nWe celebrate our bicentenary – 200 years of making a difference through learning, innovation and research.\n\nOur purpose\n\nTo advance education, knowledge and wisdom for the good of society.\n\nThe University of Manchester's motto and coat of arms\n\nOur coat of arms features our motto and was granted in 2004, when the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST were both dissolved and a new institution, The University of Manchester, was created in their place.\n\nOur motto\n\nThe Latin inscription which appears at the base of the crest, Cognitio Sapientia Humanitas, means 'knowledge, wisdom and humanity'. These are three of the University's values, along with academic freedom, courage and pioneering spirit.\n\nElements of the coat of arms\n\nThe coat of arms includes a demi-lion wearing a mural crown and emerging from a circlet set of roses and holds a torch.\n\nA sun, appearing on blue, symbolises growing enlightenment.\n\nThe bees on the new shield mark the University's connection with the city of Manchester.\n\nThe University's colours of Manchester purple and Manchester yellow are used throughout.\n\nOur vision\n\nWe will be recognised globally for the excellence of our people, research, learning and innovation, and for the benefits we bring to society and the environment.\n\nOur values\n\nAs an autonomous institution, we will strive to bring our shared values to life.\n\nKnowledge\n\nWe are ambitious in our pursuit of new ideas, greater understanding and discovery.\n\nWisdom\n\nWe share and apply our knowledge and experience to guide balanced and evidenced decisions for ourselves and for society.\n\nHumanity\n\nWe embrace and celebrate difference, respect and support each other, and act with integrity to benefit society and the environment by transforming and enriching lives.\n\nAcademic freedom\n\nWe support with enthusiasm and vigour the principles of freedom of thought and speech.\n\nCourage\n\nWe think and speak freely, and act boldly to challenge assumptions and shape our future for the greater good.\n\nPioneering spirit\n\nIn the radical Manchester spirit, and inspired by our people, history and scale, we create the exceptional.\n\nStrategic plan\n\nThe strategic plan sets our University priorities for the first five years of our journey towards the vision. We have built our strategic plan around three core goals and four themes.\n\nOur three core goals are research and discovery, teaching and learning, and social responsibility.\n\nOur people, the core of whom are our staff and students, and our values are at the heart of our plan, while our themes, innovation, civic engagement and global influence, underpin everything we do.\n\nOur values graphic OURPEOPLEOURVALUES INNOVATION CIVIC ENGAGEMENT GLOBAL INFLUENCE TEACHING AND LEARNING SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY\n\nExplore our core goals and themes\n\nOur people, our values\n\nFrom life-saving research to life-changing teaching, from gold medals to green spaces, everything we do at our University has people, our students, colleagues and alumni, at its heart.\n\nTogether we will achieve great things, working collectively towards our shared goals.\n\nFor further information, read our plan for this theme:\n\nFive-year plan: our people, our values (PDF, 6.2MB)\n\nPriorities at a glance\n\nGreat people doing great things\n\nWellbeing\n\nEquality, diversity and inclusion\n\nAn environment and facilities to support our people\n\nOur values\n\nView our ambitions and strategic priorities for our people, our values\n\nOur ambitions\n\nWe will:\n\nbe a university to which our students, staff and alumni are proud to belong, and where our values unify us in what we do and how we do it;\n\nbe a place where people can achieve great things, with the finest possible conditions for our staff and students to do what they do best and work together as one connected community;\n\nembed sustainable, responsible approaches in all our practices, enabling every one of our people to play a part in a healthier future for our University and planet;\n\nbe committed to equality and diversity, and to equal opportunities for all;\n\nset high expectations of ourselves and hold each other to account for delivery.\n\nOver the next five years our priorities will be:\n\nGreat people doing great things.
