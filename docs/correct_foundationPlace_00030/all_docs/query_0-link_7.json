        "text": "The annual One Young World Summit convenes the brightest young leaders from 190+ countries and 250+ organisations, working to accelerate social impact.\n\nDelegates participate in four transformative days of speeches, workshops and networking. Throughout the Summit, Delegates are counselled by influential political, business, and humanitarian leaders such as President Mary Robinson, Rio Ferdinand and Professor Muhammad Yunus.\n\nOnce the Summit is over, Delegates graduate as One Young World Ambassadors, returning to their workplaces and communities with the means and motivation to make a difference. Since 2010, One Young World Ambassador projects have impacted the lives of over 41.56 million people.\n\nThe next One Young World Summit will take place in Montréal (Tiohtià:ke), Canada, in September 2024. Montréal is a vibrant and multicultural city, known for its rich history, culture, and innovation. It is also home to many global organisations, such as the United Nations, UNESCO, and the International Civil Aviation Organization. Montréal is the perfect place to host the One Young World Summit, as it offers a diverse and inspiring environment for young leaders to connect, learn, and collaborate.\n\nThe One Young World Opening Ceremony is the official kick-off of the Summit, where delegates are welcomed by the host city and the One Young World Counsellors, who are prominent leaders from various fields. The Opening Ceremony in 2024 will take place at the iconic Bell Centre, the largest ice hockey arena in the world and the home of the Montréal Canadiens of the National Hockey League. It is located in the heart of downtown Montréal and is known for its state-of-the-art production technology making it an ideal place to showcase the talent and diversity of the One Young World Community. The Opening Ceremony will feature a spectacular show with live music, performances, speeches, and a flag ceremony, where delegates will proudly represent their countries and regions.\n\nThe Summit will take place at the Palais des Congrès de Montréal, a carbon-neutral building that implements various initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint, such as responsible sourcing, waste management, and community engagement. The Palais des Congrès is also located in the centre of downtown Montréal, close to many attractions, restaurants, and public transportation options. All the hotels that are part of the One Young World accommodation package are within walking distance from the Palais des Congrès, making it highly sustainable and convenient for delegates to travel between venues.\n\nProfessional Development\n\nOne Young World is a powerful professional learning and development tool that provides an unparalleled opportunity to learn from global leaders across the business, social, and humanitarian sectors. Through bespoke Q&A sessions, speeches, and workshops, you will gain valuable insights on how to best leverage your skills to advance the social causes you care about.\n\nBuild Your Global Network\n\nBeyond the Summit, you'll gain lifelong access to a community of over 17,000 individuals. As a part of this community, you'll have access to funding opportunities, educational resources, mentorship, and speaking engagements. Our in-house community team will remain in touch with you, keeping you up to date on opportunities to boost your platform and maximise the impact you can have on the world."
