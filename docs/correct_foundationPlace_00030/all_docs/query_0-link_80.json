        "text": "The Seattle Sounders are hosting St. Louis CITY SC on Wednesday in their second and final meeting of the regular season. Here is everything you need to know:\n\nWHEN AND WHERE: Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. PT at Lumen Field (TICKETS).\n\nWHERE TO WATCH: The match will be available to watch on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nWHERE TO LISTEN: The match will air on 950 KJR AM and in Spanish on El Rey 1360AM.\n\n2024 RECORDS AND STANDINGS: Sounders: 9-7-7 (34 points, 7th West), St. Louis: 4-9-10 (22 points, 13th West)\n\nFORM GUIDE (all competitions, most recent first): Seattle: WWWWW, St. Louis: LLWLD\n\nPREVIOUS MEETING: The Sounders defeated St. Louis 2-1 at CITYPARK in St. Louis, Mo., on May 25. An own goal from Kyle Hiebert and another tally from Jordan Morris paced Seattle to the road win.\n\nSOUNDERS DOMINANCE: Seattle boasts a perfect 3-0-0 record over St. Louis since it joined MLS in 2023. The Sounders have outscored CITY 7-1.\n\nBEST FORM OF THE YEAR: After a slow start to the season, Seattle has gone into overdrive in the past two months. The Sounders are winners of five straight matches in all competitions, are unbeaten in seven (6-0-1) and have lost just twice in their last 17 (11-2-4).\n\nMORRIS FLYING: Morris has been one of the main catalysts of Seattleâs success, leading the team with nine goals on the year, including eight of them coming in the last 10 MLS games.\n\nDE LA VEGA BACK IN THE LINEUP: Young Designated Player Pedro de la Vega made his first start since March 2 in the Soundersâ 1-0 win over Austin FC last weekend. The Argentineâs return was a promising sign for Seattle as it heads into Leagues Cup and the home stretch of the MLS campaign.\n\nFREI ONE SHY OF MILESTONE: After the shutout against Austin, Sounders goalkeeper Stefan Frei is just one clean sheet away from tying Kevin Hartman on Major League Soccerâs all-time shutout list.\n\nCARNELL OUT: St. Louis CITY parted ways with Head Coach Bradley Carnell on July 1, less than one year removed from him being a finalist for MLS Coach of the Year. Technical Director John Hackworth is currently managing the team on an interim basis.\n\nSHAKY D: St. Louis has allowed the third-most goals (43) in the Western Conference and has conceded four goals in three of its last four matches.\n\nROAD TROUBLES: St. Louis makes the lengthy trip to Seattle as one of only two remaining teams without a road win this season (FC Dallas). CITY have taken just five points from 10 matches away from home (0-5-5)."
