We want them to live unique moments and experiences that are otherwise impossible to have. Our actions are intended to ensure that their journey to a better and healthier life is free of hurdles.\n\nGenerosity: Our actions are driven by the desire to contribute significantly to the most deprived youths. Fortunate to be part of the Canadiens family, we are grateful and wish to give back to the community that supports us with loyalty and passion. With a genuine caring for the youth, we make sure our donations have a profound impact on their lifestyle.\n\nTeamwork: Teamwork is a priority within our organization. We encourage and favor dialogue and collaboration between the different actors working with kids, to help each other in projects and partnerships that have the well-being of youths as common goal.\n\nExcellence: The needs are great and the challenges to achieve our objectives are even greater. We are ready to provide the necessary efforts to outdo ourselves. We are on the lookout for best practices, we do not hesitate to ask questions and to challenge ourselves to ensure the relevance of our actions. We are confident of achieving what may seem inaccessible and thus, improve the health and lives of youths.\n\nCommitment: Recognizing the prestige and the benefits of being under the umbrella brand of the Canadiens, we maximize our resources to improve the well-being of youth. They allow us to act as a leader and catalyst within the community, and put our energy and unconditional dedication to serving children in need."
