        "text": "How does Target approach sustainability?\n\nTarget takes a holistic view of sustainability, with efforts focused on our business driving positive impact for both people and planet while also generating business results. We see sustainability efforts as part of an interconnected system, where our actions help address climate change, restore natural systems and drive opportunity and equity for our teams, communities and partners. These actions impact and reinforce one another to create change that is good for all.\n\nTarget’s sustainability journey\n\nOur work to bring solutions that better serve our communities and our environment can be seen across our business, including our sustainable product assortments, the increasing renewable energy footprint in our operations, our team members’ voluntary donations of their time and how we leverage our business assets to meet the needs of our communities.\n\nIn 2019, we set science-based targets for emissions reductions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 and we joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C, to help drive meaningful change across our sector and value chain, and commit to emissions reductions in line with no more than 1.5 degree warming. We are on track to achieve our 100% renewable electricity by 2030 goal and achieved its interim milestone, with 60% of our electricity procured from renewable sources1 as of FY2022.\n\nOur circular design principles of thoughtful material choice, durability, repairability and recyclability can be seen in two of our owned brands, Universal Thread and Everspring, and we accelerated our commitment to sustainable packaging in 2018 when we became signatories to the New Plastics Economy.\n\nVoluntary donations of time, talent and money are longstanding Target traditions dating back to the founding of the Dayton Foundation in 1918. Since then, our team has had a transformative effect on thousands of our communities and millions of our neighbors, including a million hours of volunteerism in 2023.\n\nTarget Forward continues work toward these commitments, and builds on our durable business model and culture of care that serves our guests, team members, partners and communities well — and delivers strong results.\n\nThe list below is a starting set of milestones we have established through ongoing listening and collaboration with our partners and communities. We will evolve and add to this list as we work to achieve our vision of a more equitable and regenerative future for all. Progress against these Target Forward goals will be updated annually through our sustainability and governance reporting.\n\nOur Goals\n\nBy 2030, Target aims to be the market leader for creating and curating inclusive, sustainable brands and experiences.\n\nInitial milestone:\n\nBy 2030, Target intends for the leading raw materials (e.g., forest products, cotton and more) that go into our owned brand products to be 100% recycled, regenerative or sustainably sourced.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nWith multiple partners and stakeholders, Target is working to meet responsible sourcing commitments for palm oil, cotton, forest-based products, coffee and seafood.\n\nIn April 2021, we launched our commitment to spend more than $2 billion with Black-owned businesses by the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we launched Target Zero, an initiative to help our guests more easily find hundreds of products across our assortment that create less packaging waste.\n\nBy 2025, Target plans for 100% of our owned brands, in addition to our owned brand limited-edition and brand partnerships, to adhere to Target’s already established sustainability standards.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nIn several of our owned brands, including Everspring, Universal Thread, Spritz and Cat & Jack, we are already implementing our Chemicals Policy and Forest Products Policy.\n\nBy 2025, Target plans for 100% of owned brand suppliers to have policies and programs to advance gender equity.\n\nFocus areas of these policies and programs include:\n\nEquitable systems for hiring and advancement.\n\nFinancial security for their workers.\n\nEffective anonymous channels for incident reporting.\n\nAccess to gender-responsive health information and services for their workers.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nContinued investment in CARE’s Dignified Work Initiative.\n\nBecame a member in 2022 of the Better Than Cash Alliance to support our commitment that all owned brand suppliers pay workers digitally by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, we also launched our Just and Equitable Supply Chain requirements to further our progress in building a responsible global supply chain.\n\nBy 2040, Target plans for 100% of our owned brand products to be designed for a circular future.\n\nOur teams will continue designing to eliminate waste — using materials that are regenerative, recycled or sourced sustainably — to create products that are more durable, easily repaired or recyclable.\n\nInitial milestone:\n\nBy 2025, Target aims to offer two circular owned brands.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nIdentified Universal Thread and Everspring as our first two owned brands that will be designed for circularity2 by 2025.\n\nTrained more than 3,000 team members and 1,000 vendor employees in our circular design principles since 2018.\n\nWe also launched Target’s Circular Design Guide, a web-based training hub for team members to learn about circular design, and completed testing for our Circular Design Calculator enabling team members to calculate key factors when choosing materials.\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to reduce annual total virgin plastic in our owned brand packaging by 20% from a 2020 baseline.\n\nInitial milestone:\n\nBy 2025, Target intends to have 100% of our owned brand plastic packaging be recyclable, compostable or reusable.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nWe are signatories to the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and the U.S. Plastics Pact.\n\nLaunched Target Zero, a curated collection with thousands of products and/or packaging designed to be refillable, reusable or compostable; concentrated; made from recycled content or made from materials that reduce the use of virgin plastic.\n\nBy 2040, Target commits to net zero greenhouse gas emissions3 across our enterprise (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n\nBy 2023, 80% of Target’s suppliers by spend (covering all purchased goods and services) will set science-based scope 1 and scope 2 targets.\n\nBy 2025, Target commits to engage suppliers to prioritize renewable energy and collaborate on solutions that protect, sustain and restore nature.\n\nBy 2025, Target commits to source 60% of our electricity from renewable sources for our operations.\n\nBy 2030, Target commits to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources for our operations.\n\nBy 2030, Target commits to achieve 50% absolute reduction in operations emissions (scopes 1 and 2) from a 2017 base year.\n\nBy 2030, Target commits to achieve 30% absolute reduction in supply chain emissions (scope 3) covering retail purchased goods and services from a 2017 base year.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nSet science-based targets for emissions reductions across scopes 1, 2 and 3.\n\nJoined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C.\n\nAchieved our interim milestone to source 60% of electricity from renewable sources for operations in 2022, three years ahead of our goal.\n\nIn 2022, retrofitted our first net zero energy store, generating more energy than it needs to operate each year through renewable sources.\n\nBy 2030, Target plans to achieve zero waste4 to landfill in U.S. operations.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nIn 2022, we diverted 83% of operational waste and 59% of construction waste from landfill.\n\nTarget received our first official zero waste certified location designation from the TRUE Certification (Zero Waste) for our Hawaii Flow Center in 2022.\n\nTarget aims to drive equitable opportunities and outcomes for advancement and engagement by continuing to be a leader in diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nEstablished the Racial Equity Action and Change (REACH) committee to accelerate our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy.\n\nLaunched next three-year cycle of our enterprise diversity, equity and inclusion goals.\n\nOur U.S. team members volunteered 1 million hours in 2023, representing industry-leading community impact efforts.\n\nTarget aims to create equity through benefit access and affordability to enhance total well-being.\n\nTarget aims to create equity through benefit access and affordability to enhance total well-being.\n\nTarget aims to empower team members to create the employment experience of their choice through personalized scheduling.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nIn 2022, announced a new starting wage range from $15 to $24 per hour.\n\nExpanded access to comprehensive health benefits for hourly team members working a minimum average of 25 hours/week.\n\nIn 2021, launched a new debt-free education assistance benefit, giving our U.S.-based team members access to free undergraduate and associates degrees, certificates, bootcamp programs, textbooks, course fees and more with no out-of-pocket costs required.\n\nImproved access to more stable schedules and transparency around scheduling policies to accommodate team members’ desired hours, including a new mobile scheduling app that allows team members to conveniently add or swap shifts.\n\nBy 2030, engage and elevate community voices as we seek to build and implement community-driven solutions.\n\nInitial milestone:\n\nBy 2025, Target and Target Foundation plan to evolve our philanthropic practices and place-based solutions to invite participation from communities.\n\nFoundations we've laid:\n\nTarget team members have impacted thousands of local communities through listening and showing up in relevant ways, volunteering more than 1 million hours and contributing millions of dollars to charitable causes in 2023.\n\nIn 2021, we announced a $100 million investment through 2025 to help fuel economic prosperity in Black communities across the country. We’re doing so by supporting local, Black-led organizations to ensure that resources are specifically designed for the communities they serve. This investment will support students attending historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), expand our funding of Black-led nonprofits, and sponsor programs that elevate Black stories and voices. With this investment, Target is a founding supporter of the PENSOLE Lewis College of Business and Design, the first historically Black college to focus on design.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced our Target Scholars Program. In partnership with the United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the program provides 1,000 first-year students from HBCUs with $5,000 scholarships and access to mentoring, internship and networking opportunities. We enhanced support for the program in 2022 with scholarship extensions and new resources including for financial hardships.\n\nWe’ll continue to evolve and add to this list of milestones as we work to achieve our vision of a more equitable and regenerative future for all. We will provide updates on our goal progress in our annual sustainability and governance reporting.\n\n1 To calculate the percentage of renewable electricity in Target’s operations, we evaluate both the amount of renewable electricity from Target’s projects and the renewable electricity in the grid. This total renewable electricity is then compared to Target’s total electricity use per the following equation: Target’s Renewable Electricity % = (Target Renewable Electricity Projects + Renewable Electricity in the Grid) / Target Electricity Use.\n\n2 Designing products in a way that designs out waste and keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible.\n\n3 Net zero, as defined, is achieved when a company’s scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are reduced to a level that is consistent with a 1.5°C pathway, and any residual emissions are removed from the atmosphere through either nature-based or technological carbon removal solutions (e.g., forestry, regenerative agriculture, carbon capture technology), by no later than 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Target has committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our enterprise, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.\n\n4 The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse and recovery of products, packaging and materials without burning and with no discharges to land, water or air that threaten the environment or human health, as established by the Zero Waste International Alliance. The threshold to be considered “Zero Waste” is normally set at a minimum of 90% diversion rate."
