        "text": "​​​​​​​The Foundation's Mission\n\nThe Valero Energy Foundation of Canada supports various causes that create and contribute to conditions conducive to academic success, which benefit children from underprivileged areas.\n\nFor the past 19 years, the commitment of our business community has had a huge impact in advancing our collective philanthropic actions. Their efforts have resulted in significant community initiatives and collaboration that have improved the lives of hundreds of people each year, as shown in these inspiring​ images. In total, more than $6.5 million has been distributed to 3,000 organizations.​\n\nTeeing it up for the Kids Golf Classic\n\nEvery year, Valero Energy invites its partners in the business community to support the Valero Energy Foundation mission by taking part in the golf classic. In 2023, more than 70 companies and 200 golfers generously responded to the call to take part in this traditional philanthropic event.\n\nFunds raised during this major solidarity-building tournament are redistributed to community organizations in the Pointe-de-l'IÎle sector in Montreal and in Lévis where the Montreal-East Terminal and Valero's Jean Gaulin Refinery are respectively located and along the pipeline Saint-Laurent that links both facilities.\n\nThe expertise these organizations have and their knowledge of local issues enable them to bring forward initiatives that improve conditions conducive to the academic success of hundreds of children.​\n\nThe Valero Energy Foundation has developed large-scale partnerships with organizations such as Jeunes musiciens du monde, Alloprof and Éducaide, to name a few. The Foundation also supports the mission of the Centre de pédiatrie sociale de Lévis and the innovative mother-child program of the Fondation Portage."
