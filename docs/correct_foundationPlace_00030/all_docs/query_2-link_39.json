        "text": "The World Needs Santa Clara University\n\nThe Santa Clara University vision and mission place at the center student learning within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, in order to educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience and compassion, and build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. Our charge has never been more vital, needed, and relevant.\n\nAs the global Jesuit university located in Silicon Valley, we sit at the intersection of innovation and humanity, ideally positioned to address epochal shifts in global society, education, and technology.\n\nProfound and rapid changes in our world mean students are coming to Santa Clara University with far different expectations, needs, and skills than in past decades. They will graduate into a rapidly changing world that requires that we anticipate how to prepare our students, what to prepare them for, and what the University community must seek to learn, discover, and create in our scholarship.\n\nImpact 2030 reflects our commitment to meet these challenges and advance our University’s mission and values boldly—to be a community of people for and with others, in kinship and solidarity, dedicated to using our talents for the betterment of humanity and our common home.\n\nIt reflects our need to leverage our strengths in innovation, education, and ethical leadership to prepare students to address the promise and pitfalls of technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning; to innovate solutions to pressing economic, health, and educational-access challenges; and to meet the crucial need to “care for our common home,” embodied in Laudato Si’ and Laudate Deum, the guiding environmental missives from Pope Francis.\n\nOur community is uniquely positioned to ensure this learning takes place in an environment of practical, living justice—one that ensures that the generations ahead will flourish and be made better by our contributions now.\n\nWhile our community of scholars is uniquely positioned to cultivate the next generation of educated, impactful citizens and leaders, doing so requires a strategic plan with vision and clarity—one that builds upon our strengths, and increases our capacities in areas of need and opportunity.\n\nRecognizing these callings, President Julie Sullivan initiated the Impact 2030 strategic planning process in a January 31, 2023, letter with a challenge to the entire University community to develop a course of action that is “specific and inspiring, actionable and bold.”\n\nGuided by the University’s Planning Action Council, faculty, students, staff, Jesuits, administrative leaders, trustees, alumni and friends responded to the call. More than 2,000 have engaged in focus groups, open forums, surveys, planning sessions, work group analyses and more—contributing ideas, debating and discussing priorities, and defining a multiyear roadmap for success.\n\nImpact 2030 is a plan that leverages our time-tested Jesuit educational model and momentum as a leading national university. On Feb. 9, 2024, the Board of Trustees unanimously adopted Impact 2030.\n\nA Strong Foundation\n\nWe embark on this strategic plan from a position of immense strength, starting with our nationally recognized teacher-scholar model that enables faculty to be at the cutting edge of their disciplines and keep student learning at the forefront. Our deliberate and mindful embrace of the liberal arts—a vital touchpoint for all students through core classes in religion, social justice, critical thinking and diverse cultures—is also a prized foundation for producing well-rounded citizens of the world.\n\n“\n\nRanked 13th among all U.S. universities in undergraduate teaching, up from 23rd in 2019\n\n—U.S. News & World Report\n\n”\n\nAdditionally, we are able to draw and expand upon the national reputation and industry leadership demonstrated by our three Centers of Distinction, which serve as interdisciplinary models for:\n\nApplying ethics in the fields of business, technology, medicine, and more (Markkula Center for Applied Ethics)\n\nEducating, mentoring, and supporting the work of more than 1,400 social entrepreneurs from more than 100 countries, and engaging students who go on to apply for and attain Fulbrights and other awards (Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship)\n\nInfusing our Jesuit mission and Ignatian spirituality into all corners of our campus (Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education)\n\nOur Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is well-positioned to help lead expansion internationally. JST regularly attracts, educates, and forms community for lay and religious leaders from more than 40 countries around the world—many of whom return to their home countries and lead dioceses or religious orders that shape ministry and service in entire regions.\n\nOur programs and offerings for entrepreneurship and innovation are also boundless sources of current and potential strength—from the startup-building and resource-rich offerings of our cross-disciplinary Ciocca Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, to the courses and other programs at the Leavey School of Business, which teach how an “entrepreneurial mindset” benefits students in every major across campus.\n\nAnd finally, our “secret sauce”: the passion of our more than 100,000-strong alumni and our extended Bronco family. We are a community that cares for the whole and seeks the holy—in ourselves, in our neighbors, and in our work.\n\nImpact 2030 Approach\n\nAt the heart of Impact 2030 are four broad strategic priorities that emerged from our strategic planning process. These four strategic priorities expand our impact globally, encompass vast curricular ambitions in areas like health care and ethical AI, commit to providing access to a world-class Santa Clara education for anyone accepted to our University—regardless of financial circumstance—and build upon the power of our committed and passionate Bronco community to develop and sustain belonging and lifelong connections for the diverse classes of our future.\n\nTogether, the four strategic priorities provide a vivid blueprint for our ambitions in the coming years. They shore up areas for improvement in Silicon Valley outreach, graduate education, and demographic and socio-economic diversity, and build upon our established teacher-scholar model that is an expression of our Jesuit values and highly regarded liberal arts foundation.\n\nFollowing the strategic priorities, we have identified a series of foundational commitments. We must invest more in our University’s human capital and improve business and financial planning practices to enhance our organizational capacity for sustained success. Many of these commitments reflect an expansion of financial goals begun in recent years, with metrics and action steps to ensure we fortify our people, technologies, budget capacity, and sustainability operations for Impact 2030 to succeed.\n\nThrough the four strategic priorities and foundational commitments, Impact 2030 reflects a confident University—nationally recognized for educational excellence, with an inspiring and compelling Jesuit vision and mission, cutting-edge interdisciplinary facilities, and a geographic location recognized as the world’s leading center of innovation. We are rooted, and we are rising together.\n\nFour Strategic Priorities for Expanding Our Impact\n\nImpact 2030 identifies four Strategic Priorities to fulfill our promise and potential to become the world’s leading Jesuit university:\n\nReach on a Global Scale\n\nSolutions for the Universal Good\n\nOpportunity for All Talented Students\n\nBelonging for All Broncos"
