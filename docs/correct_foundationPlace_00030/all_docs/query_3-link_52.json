A graduate in marketing from HEC Montréal, he has held important strategic positions in the private and public sectors, ranging from services to retail, telecommunications, entertainment and media.\n\n“Commitment to my community is at the heart of my journey, and health has always been a passion. The Montreal Heart Institute is undeniably a Quebec and Canadian jewel, and it is with great pleasure that I take over the helm of the Foundation, which supports this unique institution in the world”, said Mr. Alain Gignac.\n\nAbout the Montreal Heart Institute\n\nFounded in 1954 by Dr. Paul David, the Montreal Heart Institute constantly aims for the highest standards of excellence in the cardiovascular field through its leadership in clinical and basic research, ultra-specialized care, professional training and prevention. The Montreal Heart Institute is one of the three best cardiology centres in the world.

We practise more than 2,200 surgeries each year.\n\nAbout the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation\n\nFounded in 1977, the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation raises and administers funds to support the Institute’s priority and innovative projects and fight cardiovascular diseases, the world’s number one cause of mortality. Its philanthropic events and the contributions of its donors have enabled this leading cardiovascular health care organization to become the largest cardiac research centre in the country. Since its creation, the Foundation has raised more than $283 million in donations. Its 27,514 donors helped make important discoveries and support specialists, professionals and researchers of the Institute to provide care at the cutting edge of technology to tens of thousands of patients in Quebec."
