        "meta_description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) is dedicated to strengthening public health systems worldwide using the latest advances in digital tools and technology. This includes using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to reveal spatial patterns and provide vital insights to decision-makers. On 12 October 2023 colleagues from across the three levels of WHO together with representatives from UNFPA, UNICEF and Dr Christopher Elias, President of Global Development at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), marked a significant milestone with the opening of the first-ever GIS Centre in a country office. Representatives from the Somalia Ministry of Health were also in attendance, underlining the significance of this initiative. The GIS Centre is located in the WHO office of Somalia in Mogadishu, and its launch marks an important step forward for public health systems both in the country and in the region.Somalia has grappled with multifaceted challenges over the last three decades. From enduring conflicts and climatic shocks to political instability, the country has borne the brunt of numerous crises that have adversely impacted its health systems. With the recent drought being termed the worst in 40 years and the health infrastructure still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such initiatives have become even more paramount. This includes tracking population movements in relation to healthcare facilities and assessing which areas remain underserved, as well as which areas require greater capacity at different times of the year.While WHO currently hosts two other GIS Centres in Geneva and Brazzaville, this is a pioneering effort to establish one at the country level. With support from BMGF, the new center aims to fortify Somalia's health system by enhancing its resilience against challenges like the ongoing polio outbreak and other public health emergencies. The primary objective is to harness the power of geospatial data for evidence-based planning and response.This GIS Centre will also act as a nexus of collaboration by engaging with various WHO programs to manage foundational datasets, carry out intricate spatial analyses, and coordinate efforts with other UN bodies and partner organizations. With this new GIS Centre in Somalia, the government will be better equipped to integrate GIS technology with traditional health statistics to deliver the right care to the right place at the right time.WHO plans to continue replicating and scaling such centers in other regional and country offices, including through the launch of a WHO European Geospatial Coordination Hub in Istanbul, Turkiye on 15 November 2023.For further information or inquiries, please reach out to the WHO GIS Centre for Health at gissupport@who.int.",
