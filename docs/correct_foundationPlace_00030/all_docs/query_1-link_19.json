        "text": "BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY is the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation and low cost to open up a new market space and create new demand. It is about creating and capturing uncontested market space, thereby making the competition irrelevant. It is based on the view that market boundaries and industry structure are not a given and can be reconstructed by the actions and beliefs of industry players.\n\nWHAT ARE RED OCEANS AND BLUE OCEANS?\n\nIn their classic book, Blue Ocean Strategy, Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne coined the terms ’red ocean’ and ‘blue ocean’ to describe the market universe.\n\nRED OCEANS\n\nRED OCEANS are all the industries in existence today – the known market space. In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known.\n\nHere, companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities, leading to cutthroat or ‘bloody’ competition. Hence the term red oceans.\n\nRED OCEANS\n\nBLUE OCEANS\n\nBLUE OCEANS, in contrast, denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid.\n\nIn blue oceans, competition is irrelevant because the rules of the game are waiting to be set. A blue ocean is an analogy to describe the wider, deeper potential to be found in unexplored market space. A blue ocean is vast, deep, and powerful in terms of profitable growth.\n\nBLUE OCEAN STRATEGY VS RED OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nLearn the key differences between red ocean and blue ocean strategy.\n\nRED OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nCompete in existing market space\n\nBeat the competition\n\nExploit existing demand\n\nMake the value-cost trade-off\n\nAlign the whole system of a firm's activities with its strategic choice of differentiation or low cost\n\nBLUE OCEAN STRATEGY\n\nCreate uncontested market space\n\nMake the competition irrelevant\n\nCreate and capture new demand\n\nBreak the value-cost trade-off\n\nAlign the whole system of a firm's activities in pursuit of differentiation and low cost\n\n© Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne. All rights reserved.\n\nMEET THE AUTHORS\n\n#1 Management Thinkers in the World\n\nChan Kim and Renée Mauborgne\n\nare the authors of the New York Times Best Seller Blue Ocean Shift and the 4 million copy global bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy. In 2023, they were chosen as two of the four leading thinkers in the 100 years of Harvard Business Review’s publication. In 2019, they were named the #1 Management Thinkers in the World by Thinkers50.\n\nKEY POINTS OF BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY & SHIFT\n\nThe fundamentals that will jump-start your strategy development process.\n\nIt’s grounded in data\n\nBlue ocean strategy is based on a decade-long study of more than 150 strategic moves spanning more than 30 industries over 100 years.\n\nIt pursues differentiation and low cost\n\nBlue ocean strategy is based on the simultaneous pursuit of differentiation AND low cost. It is an ‘and-and’ not an ‘either-or’ strategy.\n\nIt creates uncontested market space\n\nBlue ocean strategy doesn’t aim to out-perform the competition. It aims to make the competition irrelevant by reconstructing industry boundaries.\n\nIt empowers you through tools and frameworks\n\nBlue ocean strategy offers systematic tools and frameworks to shift from red ocean of competition to blue oceans of new market space.\n\nIt provides a step-by-step process\n\nFrom assessing the current state of play in an industry, to exploring the six paths to new market space, to understanding how to convert noncustomers into customers, blue ocean strategy and shift provides a systematic process to create your blue ocean.\n\nIt maximizes opportunity while minimizing risk\n\nBlue ocean strategy allows you to test the commercial viability of your ideas and shows you how to refine your ideas to maximize your upside while minimizing downside risk.\n\nIt builds execution into strategy\n\nThe process and tools are inclusive, easy to understand and visual – which makes the process non-intimidating and an effective path to building execution into strategy.\n\nIt shows you how to create a win-win outcome\n\nAs an integrated approach, blue ocean strategy shows how to align the three strategy propositions – value, profit, and people – to create a win-win outcome. Blue ocean shift builds humanness into the process to build people’s confidence to own and drive the process.\n\nBLUE OCEAN STRATEGY TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS\n\nPut these practical market-creating tools into practice.\n\nLearn how to put these practical market-creating tools into practice to move from red ocean of competition to blue oceans of new market space and to do so in a way that people own and drive the process.\n\nREAD THE BOOKS\n\nThe books that changed the way we think about strategy.\n\nBlue Ocean Strategy\n\nThe origin of the terms red and blue oceans comes from Blue Ocean Strategy – How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant.\n\nRecognized as one of the most iconic and impactful strategy books ever written, Blue Ocean Strategy argues that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool.\n\nIt presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any organization can use to create and capture their own blue oceans.\n\nBlue Ocean Shift\n\nBlue Ocean Shift is the essential follow-up to Blue Ocean Strategy. Drawing on more than a decade of new research, Blue Ocean Shift: Beyond Competing – Proven Steps to Inspire Confidence and Seize New Growth is the definitive guide to help you move beyond competing, inspire your people’s confidence, and seize new growth. Blue Ocean Shift is the New York Times and #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.\n\nThe books have collectively sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nBEYOND DISRUPTION\n\nInnovate and Achieve Growth without Displacing Industries, Companies, or Jobs\n\nWith three decades of research, the #1 global bestselling authors of Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, reveal another way to innovate and grow. Just as Blue Ocean Strategy redefined the essence of strategy as creating not competing, Beyond Disruption redefines and expands the existing view of innovation by introducing a new approach, nondisruptive creation, that is free from the destructive displacement that happens when innovators set out to disrupt.\n\n“Nondisruptive creation is a pathbreaking new concept that shows leaders and innovators how business can be a force for good. This book will become a business classic.”\n\n—Jake Cohen, Senior Associate Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management\n\nBLUE OCEAN SPRINT\n\nLearn how to leave the competition behind. Discover how to create a new market space while lowering your costs, fast.\n\n“LOVED this course.
