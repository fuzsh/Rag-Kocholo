        "text": "The entrepreneurial Bronfman family has been seizing opportunities for over two centuries. From humble beginnings as a Russian immigrant at the end of the nineteenth century, the family patriarch Samuel Bronfman began to build what would become the largest distiller in North America. Under his leadership, the Bronfman family established itself as a pioneer of the Canadian industrial landscape and built a crown jewel of the emerging Canadian economy. As a direct beneficiary of the fortune created from the Seagram empire during its 80 year period under Bronfman control, the family office multiplied the value of the Seagram cash flow by continually reinvesting in a myriad of ventures, ranging from chemical production to real estate. Claridge, founded in 1987 by Stephen Bronfman’s father Charles Bronfman, and its predecessor company, Cemp Investments Ltd., have been active private equity investors for over five decades. The firm employs some 30 investment and administrative professionals. Our portfolio composition is carefully shaped to reflect the optimal mix between economic sectors and geographies. Direct equity participations currently include holdings in food, real estate, technology, entertainment, and renewable energy, among others. Claridge also has third-party managed investments in a variety of industries throughout the world. Claridge has thrived through many economic cycles. Our investment experience, coupled with our expertise in identifying transformational opportunities and adding value to portfolio companies, has helped us achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Claudine and Stephen Bronfman Family Foundation Claudine and Stephen Bronfman carry on the long philanthropic tradition initiated by previous generations of Bronfman family members. As doing business is in the family’s DNA, so is philanthropy. Claridge employees are inspired by the family’s leadership. Their community involvement is also encouraged and matching funds for employee donations are provided. Many employees regularly participate in activities in support of a number of causes. Forward thinking, strategic and nimble, the Claudine and Stephen Bronfman Family Foundation strives to create and innovate locally, nationally and internationally, with a strong focus on Montreal. The important operating guidelines of the foundation are:\n\nEngagement and empowerment of emerging talent that encourages the development of human potential and that recognizes and celebrates individual and collective ingenuity.\n\nInvestments that favour the environment, culture, education, entrepreneurship and Jewish life.\n\nActive research and documentation that identifies and analyses challenges confronting communities.\n\nContinuous evaluation, both internally and externally, that further strengthens the foundation’s impact.\n\nTargeted networks and partnerships allow the foundation to build on the best practices that answer needs with concrete solutions and that broaden its reach.\n\nConstantly moving ahead to not only do more, but also aspiring to always do better, the foundation is committed to live every day by its motto “créer et innover”.\n\nWe are a growth-oriented investor with experience across a variety of economic sectors. We seek to partner with and invest in high-quality businesses with strong and defensible market positions. These types of businesses tend to have the following characteristics:\n\nOutstanding, committed management teams\n\nExperienced, successful, and ambitious teams demonstrating deep industry insight.\n\nManagement with “skin in the game” investing alongside us.\n\nStrong, positive corporate culture.\n\nIndustries with attractive fundamentals\n\nCompelling long-term industry fundamentals.\n\nMinimal risk of obsolescence and disintermediation.\n\nMeaningful barriers to entry.\n\nAttractive return on invested capital.\n\nCompanies with good revenue and cash flow growth potential\n\nOutpacing industry revenue growth.\n\nHealthy operating margins.\n\nOpportunities to implement operational value creation initiatives.\n\nPredictable and growing cash flows.\n\nDifferentiated companies with global potential\n\nDemonstrated market leadership.\n\nStrong brands and intellectual property.\n\nCompetitive advantages that provide the ability to withstand material changes in the economic environment.\n\nWe target mid-market companies in Canada and the United States. Our flexible approach is well-suited to management teams and owners seeking a value-added and long-term partner. In this role, we often provide strategic and operational support, relationships, capital to fund growth initiatives, and a more conservative approach to leverage. Investment structure\n\nMajority or significant minority equity investments.\n\nWe have the flexibility to pursue a range of investment structures as well as transaction types.\n\nWe evaluate each potential transaction based on its own merits. We favour simple investment structures that meet the unique needs of sellers.\n\nWe prefer control, but also invest in significant minority situations where we have strong influence over the company’s destiny.\n\nInvestment Size / Equity Cheque\n\nMinority investments requiring approximately $5-10 million of equity contribution.\n\nMajority investments requiring approximately $15-$50 million of equity contribution.\n\nWe have the capability to underwrite larger transactions and we are willing to work with partners.\n\nOwnership Types\n\nOur approach can appeal to family-owned businesses and select public and sponsor-owned companies.\n\nTransaction Types\n\nGrowth capital.\n\nManagement led buy-outs.\n\nShareholder liquidity.\n\nOwnership transitions.\n\nWe are differentiated by our entrepreneurial family business mindset, flexible investment approach, global relationships, value creation capabilities, strong integrity, use of reasonable leverage, and long-term investment horizon. Patient Capital\n\nWe have a longer-term outlook than most investors. Unlike traditional private equity firms, we have an owner mindset and a longer time horizon to allow for the maximization of value with each of our operating companies.\n\nNot having a predetermined fund life gives us the flexibility to make long-term decisions for the well-being of the company.\n\nFlexible investment structuring\n\nBroad investment mandate gives us the flexibility to pursue a range of investments types.\n\nSimple investment structures meet the unique needs of sellers.\n\nWe can be a significant minority partner and although we prefer to invest at the equity level, we have the ability to invest throughout the capital structure of the company (mezzanine debt and equity).\n\nEntrepreneurial family business mindset\n\nFlat and agile operating structure enables us to make decisions quickly and provide prompt feedback.\n\nUnlike institutional funds, we do not have multiple committees to reach a consensus to obtain required authorizations.\n\nWe report to one owner who plays an integral role in decision-making and works closely with the senior leadership team.\n\nBalanced approach to leverage\n\nWe understand the benefits and risks of financial leverage.\n\nWe use conservative leverage and construct optimal capital structures to provide sufficient flexibility to maneuver through economic cycles and reinvest cash flows to grow the business.\n\nThis is why we are a successful private equity investor: Extensive international network\n\nFinancial investments span North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe Bronfman family and our investment professionals have extensive relationships with senior decision makers in multiple industries on a global scale. Our portfolio companies leverage the relationships that the Bronfman family have built through generations of doing business.\n\nStrong strategic and operational support\n\nOur executives have distinguished international track records with large and small organizations in diverse sectors. This broad experience allows us to guide management teams through challenging decisions.\n\nGlobal perspective enables us to identify sectors with potentially better opportunities, make key introductions to new markets, recruit new personnel, and make acquisitions.\n\nFinancial expertise\n\nComprehensive financial expertise and extensive relationships in the business and financial community can be leveraged by our portfolio companies in the context of mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, and financings.\n\nGovernance\n\nWe take governance seriously and adhere to the highest industry standards. Our governance requirements are similar to those of institutional funds and relate mostly to capital allocation and reporting.\n\nWe are not involved in day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies, preferring to delegate responsibility to the management team.\n\nWe put in place strong boards formed with members that bring experience and sector knowledge to our partners.\n\nOur management style plays a major role in our success and it is one of the reasons entrepreneurs and management teams want to work with us. We are not only chosen for our capital, but also for the type of partnership and guidance we can offer. Claridge challenges its portfolio teams to excel and, through respectful and symbiotic relationships, we tend to complement our partners well. Claridge’s differentiating characteristics go far beyond the expected in the industry, and upon meeting our team, new partners quickly realize what makes us unique. Our portfolio teams are put together to reflect a unique mix of experience and entrepreneurial spirit, which has proven to be extremely efficient. Hard-working and honest, our staff is entirely committed to growing your business in a way that is as enjoyable as it is profitable.\n\nOpen and direct communication.\n\nRegular, on-going dialogue.\n\nCollaborative approach with management.\n\nTrust and integrity – we keep our word.\n\nFocus on true value creation, not short term profits.\n\nResult oriented.\n\nGood corporate citizen.\n\nOur investments in real estate started in the 1950’s when we established what ultimately became, Cadillac Fairview, which grew to become one of North America’s leading developers, owners and managers of commercial real estate.\n\nFollowing the sale of Cadillac Fairview in 1987, Claridge’s focus shifted to participating in the development and ownership of commercial and residential real estate by partnering with experienced and capable real estate companies. This remains Claridge’s real estate investment strategy today, predominantly in Montreal and Quebec City, but also in Ottawa and Toronto.\n\nIn 2016, Claridge established a real estate investment platform to broaden its capability to participate in development projects with Quebec-based developers. This platform is managed by Claridge Real Estate and comprises two investors – Claridge and Ivanhoe Cambridge. As of the end of 2020, over $200 million of equity has been deployed in 19 distinct development projects in the Greater Montreal Area and Quebec City. In addition to the Claridge/Ivanhoe Cambridge partnership, which is focused on investing in Quebec, Claridge has invested in several development or re-development projects in Ottawa and Toronto, in each case as a financial partner, with well-known and highly regarded local developers.\n\nOur focus remains investing in development and re-development projects in Quebec and Ontario, with a particular emphasis on residential, industrial and mixed-use opportunities. Over the past 10 years, we have participated in numerous development projects involving condominiums, rental apartments, seniors housing, single-family and townhomes, design-build industrial, design-build office and industrial to office conversion projects.\n\nWe are a knowledgeable financial partner that seeks to add value to our relationships with our development partners by participating in major decisions throughout the development process, while allowing our development partners to exercise their development responsibilities in a diligent and efficient manner."
