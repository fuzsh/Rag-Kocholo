        "text": "Reading and interpreting maps\n\nMaps are one of the geographer's key tools for representing and explaining spatial information, patterns and processes. Reading and interpreting maps is thus central to geographical education. To effectively read maps, students need to develop a range of interrelated skills:\n\nlocational skills - using grid references, coordinates, longitudes/latitudes\n\nsymbol skills - using the key to interpret the different symbols\n\nunderstanding of scale - using a scale to estimate distances and compare areas\n\ninterpretation of data - describing and comparing information shown on thematic maps. (Adapted from Biddulph, Lambert, & Balderstone, 2015)\n\nThe two strategies below scaffold students' ability to read and interpret information represented in visual form. Geography teachers can adapt the Strategies that demonstrate how to explicitly teach the semiotic (meaning-making) systems of visual texts in Science. For a brief explanation of the types of maps encountered in Geography, including their function and a brief description of some of the semiotic systems they use, teachers can view 'Types of maps' produced by the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping.\n\nExplicitly teaching semiotic systems of maps\n\nMaps are a core tool used to communicate in geography. However, they can be complex multimodal texts, each of which may a different semiotic (meaning-making) systems to represent information. Students need to be explicitly taught ways to read and interpret information presented in maps.\n\nGeography teachers would be familiar with explicitly teaching the six features of a map using BOLTSS (this acronym represents the first letters of the six features listed below):\n\nB – Border: A line around the map to show the edges of the map to prevent confusion with other text\n\nO – Orientation: Shows direction using a compass rose or North arrow\n\nL – Legend: Key to the symbols and colours used\n\nT – Title: A precise name of the map, usually placed above the map or sometimes in the figure caption\n\nS – Scale: A measure between the map and real-world usually a linear scale, and sometimes a ratio or statement\n\nS – Source: A source is the origin of the data shown on the map so that the reader knows where the information comes from.\n\nIn addition to teaching each of these features, teachers can show students a range of map types and engage them in discussion to explicitly teach the various semiotic systems each map employs (an example of a rainfall map is below). This can be done for each feature of BOLTS, which is demonstrated by teacher questioning in the table below. Responses to these questions will differ depending on the type of map being shown.\n\nThe example below is a Year 7 or 8 student's semiotic analysis of the Australian Rainfall Analysis for the week ending 25 February 2020.\n\nPattern, Quantify, Exceptions (PQE)\n\nOne strategy used by geographers to interpret thematic maps (e.g. choropleth maps, isoline maps) and graphs is the Pattern, Quantify, Exceptions (PQE) tool. PQE is a way of expressing literate understanding and is an important first step before analysing data.\n\nThe PQE tool asks students to:\n\nobserve general spatial patterns on maps\n\nexamine maps closely for specific details of patterns\n\nidentify and describe exceptions (sometimes these are called anomalies)\n\ndraw on prior knowledge to explain the observed patterns and anomalies.\n\nThe procedure for using the PQE tool is adapted from Easton et al. (2013). Teacher questioning and guided discussion support students to better complete each of the steps.\n\nThe example included below relates to a Year 9 or 10 class learning about biomes (VCGGK133), but the strategy can be used to support the Data and information sub-strand from Years 7 to 10 (VCGGC102, VCGGC104, VCGGC130, VCGGC132). The map shows the distribution of Australia's forest types in 2013, and the source is ABARES (Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences. The map can also be found Access the 'Distribution of Australia's forest types, 2013' map on the Department of Agriculture's website.\n\nP – Pattern\n\nObserve and identify the general patterns across the map by finding a high and low concentration of a particular feature.\n\nFor example: In the map below, most of Australia's forests are found along the eastern coast.\n\nQ – Quantify\n\nExtract specific and accurate information from the map as evidence of the patterns. Quantifying involves using statistics, amounts, sizes and locations to give specific details.\n\nFor example: Most of the forest types are eucalypts. Australian forests span from the northern tropical regions in Queensland to the temperate regions in the southeast including Tasmania.\n\nE – Exceptions\n\nIdentify and quantify details that do not fit the patterns identified. Anomalies are also significant information for geographers.\n\nFor example: Forests can also be found on the south-western and southern parts of West Australia, including some inland regions.\n\nLiteracy in Practice Video: Geography - Photographs\n\nTeacher: Gareth Evans\n\nUnpacking photographs\n\nPhotographs frequently feature as a visual resource in the geography classroom. Students today are exposed to visual images every day, within and beyond the classroom, so it is important to help them develop a more critical eye to interpret photographs geographically (Halocha, 2008).\n\nPhotographs are often taken for specific purposes. Students need to consider how these purposes may affect their interpretation of the issue or aspect that the photographs are trying to portray. In addition, photographs provide a small and selective view. It is important therefore that students can understand the broader context in which the photograph is situated.\n\nGeographers use several types of photographs, including ground-level photographs, oblique and vertical aerial photographs, and satellite images. Whereas vertical aerial photos and satellite images are more similar to maps (they are useful for portraying information about patterns across large areas of space), ground-level and oblique aerial photos require rather different interpretation skills.\n\nLayers of inference\n\nOne strategy to help students interpret photographs critically is the layers of inference framework. This framework encourages students to first identify the literal meanings in photographs, then draw on their prior knowledge to build inferences and predictions.\n\nThe purposes of using the layers of inference framework are to encourage students to:\n\nexamine photographs closely to identify specific features\n\ndraw on their prior knowledge to make inferences or informed guesses or predictions\n\nbecome aware that the photographs present only partial evidence\n\nbe curious and ask questions\n\nbe critical by considering both what is shown and what is not shown (adapted from Roberts, 2013, p.155).\n\nTeachers can support students to analyse photographs using the layers of inference framework using either a graphic organiser or as template below (Riley, 1999; Roberts, 2013). This strategy supports the Data and information sub-strand from Years 7 to 10 (VCGGC102, VCGGC104, VCGGC130, VCGGC132).\n\nLayers of inference framework graphic organiser\n\nLayers of inference framework template\n\nThe following procedure for using the layers of inference framework involves three sequential steps (adapted from Roberts, 2013). These steps can be used by individual students, but the process is strengthened by peer collaboration. A Year 10 student work sample for Geographies of human wellbeing is provided (VCGGK153)."
