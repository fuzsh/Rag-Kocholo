The Government of Canada is investing $125 million in the University of Calgary’s One Child Every Child initiative – one of the largest ever awarded to a university in Alberta. By bringing together researchers, community partners, health-care providers, equity-deserving groups, educators and Indigenous communities, One Child Every Child dramatically improves the lives of children across Canada and beyond.\n\nOne Child Every Child is guided by ii’ taa’poh’to’p, the UCalgary Indigenous Strategy, and walks parallel paths with Indigenous Elders and scholars to encompass the wisdom, voices and priorities of Indigenous peoples for the betterment of all.\n\nOne Child Every Child brings together Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, child health research institutes, education and healthcare providers, equity-deserving groups, local, national and global stakeholders to accelerate outcomes for children and their families.\n\nMore than four decades of community support through the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation has enabled the University of Calgary to recruit and retain the most productive concentration of child health scientists in the country. In 2020, the University of Calgary became the first university in Canada to declare child health and wellness an institutional research priority.\n\nOne Child Every Child represents an unprecedented partnership of 132 organizations from 25 countries is committed to helping all children be healthy, empowered and thriving.\n\nOver 250 unique health delivery organizations – from hospitals and rehabilitation centres to community outreach and home care providers – have joined the cause. By bringing everyone together, One Child Every Child dramatically improves the lives of children across Canada and beyond."
