        "text": "About This Cause\n\nWho we are The Foundation of Greater Montreal (FGM) is a charitable organization working towards the well-being of the Greater Montreal community, and a member of the Community Foundations of Canada network. Community foundations are institutions whose purpose is to collect and manage philanthropic funds that target the priority needs of the community within their territory. Their role is also to develop philanthropy, gather community leaders of all stripes, to facilitate the search of innovative and sustainable solutions to community issues and, therefore, to strengthen the community as a whole. Our history The beginnings of the Foundation of Greater Montreal date back to the 1980s. Francophones, Anglophones, representatives of the Jewish community and First Nations came together, through their foundations, businesses and well-established non-profit organizations, to create a new community foundation in the area. After about a decade of work in the background, FGM was officially created in 1999 and began its operations in earnest at the start of the year 2000. The Foundation has not stopped growing ever since, crossed the $300 million dollar mark in assets under management in 2018 and, as of now, manages more than 650 philanthropic funds in all sectors: culture, education, healthcare, environmental protection, social development, etc. In 2018, FGM distributed more than $8.5 million to close to 470 organizations across the Greater Montreal area. How we work Whether you are an individual, a family, a non-profit organization or a business, FGM can help you meet your philanthropic goals by creating your own fund or donating to an existing one. No matter the type or amount of your donation, you can be assured that it will be managed in a professional and rigorous manner, and that it will help further the cause you have chosen – in perpetuity. The FGM team can help you chose the sector or organization that will maximize the impact on the causes you hold most dear. The COVID-19 Collective Fund The COVID-19 Collective Fund has two objectives. First, to respond to immediate needs across all sectors of our community life, paying special attention to the situation of vulnerable children. Second, the Fund aims to stimulate and support the strategic collective work required to contribute to the recovery and rebuilding of the community in the aftermath of the crisis. Donations to the Collective COVID-19 Fund can be unrestricted or geared towards any of the following sectors: education, healthcare, culture, the environment or social development."
