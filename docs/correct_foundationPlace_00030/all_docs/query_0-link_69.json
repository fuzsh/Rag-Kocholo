        "text": "What’s new in the 2025 competition?\n\nThe 2025 competition is divided into three streams.\n\nStream 1: Leading edge of exploration and knowledge generation (open)\n\nThis stream is open to proposals from all disciplines.\n\nStream 2: Leading edge of exploration and knowledge generation in the social sciences, humanities and arts\n\nSocial sciences, humanities and the arts (SSHA) play a critical role in the Canadian research ecosystem. For example, SSHA researchers increasingly use new technologies to leverage large amounts of data to make new discoveries that will fundamentally change how research is conducted.\n\nTo access this stream, the primary field of research must be in SSHA.\n\nTo promote submissions in this stream, we invite institutions to submit one proposal with a primary field of research in SSHA that will be outside their institutional envelope.\n\nStream 3: Creation, renewal and upgrade of core facilities\n\nAn increasing number of institutions have adopted core facilities and formal policies to support them. Core facilities have proven instrumental in attracting, retaining and training top researchers from around the globe. They also foster collaborations across academic, private, public and not-for-profit sectors.\n\nTo access this stream, all requested infrastructure must be housed in and managed by a core facility.\n\nConsult the call for proposals for more on these three streams, including tailored assessment criteria, changes to eligibility and envelope exemptions.\n\nWhat are the details of the 2025 competition?\n\nImportant dates\n\nActivityDeadlineCFI issues draft call for proposalsApr 18, 2024Deadline to submit feedback on the draft call for proposalsMay 17, 2024CFI issues call for proposalsJun 6, 2024Deadline to submit notices of intentOct 2, 2024Deadline to submit proposalsFeb 4, 2025Review by Expert CommitteesMar to Jun 2025Review by Multidisciplinary Assessment CommitteesSept 2025Review by Special Multidisciplinary Assessment CommitteeOct 2025Decision by CFI Board of DirectorsNov 2025\n\nCompetition budget\n\nThe CFI will invest up to $425 million in research infrastructure funding and will fund up to 40 percent of a project’s eligible infrastructure costs. We will also provide up to $127.5 million for associated operating and maintenance costs through the Infrastructure Operating Fund.\n\nObjectives of this competition\n\nThe objectives of the 2025 competition are to:\n\nEnable internationally competitive research or technology development through the equitable participation of expert team members\n\nEnhance the capacity of institutions to conduct the research or technology development program over the useful life of the infrastructure\n\nGenerate benefits to Canadians.\n\nEligible infrastructure projects\n\nAn eligible infrastructure project involves acquiring or developing research infrastructure to increase research capacity and support world–class research.\n\nTotal project costs must be greater than $1 million for proposals to be considered for this competition. It is expected that projects will be finalized promptly and completed within a reasonable time frame.\n\nConsult the Policy and program guide and the call for proposals for more information on eligibility.\n\nWhat does an institution need to do before applying?\n\nTo participate in any of our funding competitions, you must first make sure your institution is eligible to apply for funding, has signed an institutional agreement and that you have an account on our CFI Awards Management System (CAMS).\n\nFind out how to prepare to apply\n\nWhat is the process to apply?\n\nFollow the steps below and consult the call for proposals for complete instructions on how to apply.\n\nStep 1: Submit a notice of intent\n\nSubmit a notice of intent if your institution plans to seek funding through this competition.\n\nWe will use notices of intent to:\n\nIdentify what expertise is needed to assess each proposal\n\nRecruit committee members\n\nEnsure that the requested infrastructure is eligible.\n\nSubmit your notice of intent in the CFI Awards Management System (CAMS)\n\nStep 2: Submit a proposal\n\nConsult the call for proposals for detailed instructions on how to submit a proposal.\n\nSubmit your proposal in the CFI Awards Management System (CAMS)\n\nWhat do research institutions need to do regarding research security when they apply for CFI funding?\n\nInstitutions applying for CFI funding have research security obligations at the time of application under both the Government of Canada’s National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships and the Policy on Sensitive Technology Research and Affiliations of Concern (STRAC).\n\nFind out what your institution needs to provide with proposals to the 2025 Innovation Fund competition to meet those requirements.\n\nHow is my proposal assessed?\n\nFirst, we make sure it is complete and adheres to our guidelines. Then, it is assessed through our review process.\n\n1. Expert Committees\n\nIn the first stage of review, Expert Committees review small groups of proposals and from the same area of research. Only proposals that meet a minimum threshold across the five assessment criteria will move to the Multidisciplinary Assessment Committees.\n\n2. Multidisciplinary Assessment Committees\n\nMultidisciplinary Assessment Committees review groups of proposals of similar size and/or complexity and assess them against the three competition objectives in order to:\n\nIdentify proposals that demonstrate excellence and best meet the three competition objectives relative to other competing requests\n\nProvide a funding recommendation and funding amount for each proposal for the next stage of review.\n\n3. Special Multidisciplinary Assessment Committee\n\nIn the third and final stage of review, a Special Multidisciplinary Assessment Committee (S-MAC) reviews reports from the MAC meetings for the proposals that the MACs recommend for funding. The S-MAC makes sure the MACs were consistent in their assessment. If recommendations from the MACs exceed the available budget, the S-MAC recommends to the CFI Board of Directors the proposals that best support the CFI’s mandate, meet the objectives of the competition and represent the most beneficial portfolio of investments for Canada.\n\nIf your institution receives funding through this fund, there are a few things you will need to do to finalize, manage and report on your award.\n\nHow are awards finalized?\n\nFunded recipients need to submit an award finalization form in the CFI Awards Management System (CAMS). Funded recipients must finalize their award before we can release funds to their institution. It is expected that projects will be finalized promptly and completed within a reasonable time frame.\n\nWhat do institutions need to do for research security after they receive CFI funding?\n\nInstitutions applying for or receiving CFI funding have research security obligations both when they apply for funding as well as after they receive funding and throughout the life of the project.\n\nLearn what institutions need to do for research security after they receive CFI funding\n\nWhat is required of institutions for reporting on a funded project?\n\nOnce a project at your institution is up and running, you will need to submit progress and financial reports in CAMS. (The specific reporting requirements for each project, including deadlines and frequency, are included in the terms and conditions of each award agreement.)\n\nExplore sample templates and find other resources for reporting on your funded project\n\nHow can institutions access operating support for funded projects?\n\nInstitutions can access financial support for the operating and maintenance costs of CFI-funded research infrastructure through our Infrastructure Operating Fund.\n\nFind out more about our Infrastructure Operating Fund\n\nRead and share good practices for managing your funding\n\nStaff at our funded institutions have developed good practices, policies and processes for managing the funding they receive from the CFI.\n\nBrowse our good practices for institutions and write to us at good.practices [at] innovation.ca (good[dot]practices[at]innovation[dot]ca) to share your own."
