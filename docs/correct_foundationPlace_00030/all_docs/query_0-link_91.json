Facilitated workshops initiated crucial conversations of how we wanted to operate as a team and operate within the greater FIRST community. Our workshop, shared with more than 30 other FIRST teams, continue to inspire “The Green Machine” to “redefine what greatness means.”\n\n1816 Award Materials\n\n1816 Essay & Executive Summaries\n\n1816 Chairman's Presentation\n\nExploding Bacon Team 1902 from Orlando, Florida was awarded the FIRST Championship Chairman’s Award at the 2019 Houston FIRST Championship. The team received this award for their programs and culture that continue to fuel each generation’s passion for STEM and inspire them to become innovators in their own community.\n\nTo do this, Exploding Bacon built programs that multiplied their impact at FIRST events, online, and around the world. These programs included Exploding Science, Spark, and #FIRSTLikeAGirl. Additionally, their emphasis on image and marketing extended the reach and amplified the impact of their programs, while also supporting fellow FIRST teams’ outreach endeavors.\n\nBacon initially began Exploding Science as an outreach program in their local community. It quickly became a core initiative, teaching exciting science concepts to students after school and eventually adding LEGO EV3 robotics design to create a full Summer Camp curriculum for 8-12 year olds. Many participants of the summer camps went on to join FIRST LEGO League Teams and eventually join Exploding Bacon, strengthening the FIRST pipeline in the Central Florida area.\n\nIn 2014, Bacon expanded Exploding Science and created the Spark Science kits. This global outreach initiative was designed to send reusable, shoebox-sized science kits to students with few resources. Initially created to send alongside mission trips launched from their community, Spark transformed into a program improving the accessibility of STEM education and demonstrating the true power of the FIRST community. Exploding Bacon has worked alongside FIRST teams and other organizations to send 154 Spark kits to 49 countries.\n\nIn 2016, Exploding Bacon created the #FIRSTLikeAGirl program to encourage more girls and women to get involved in STEM. Through this social media campaign, they strive to empower girls with the confidence to overcome cultural pressures, follow their dreams in STEM, and become active members of the FIRST community. The #FIRSTLikeAGirl YouTube channel features over 100 videos of students, mentors, and alumni in the FIRST community sharing their stories. Additionally, the #FIRSTLikeAGirl social media accounts have garnered global attention yielding over one million impressions per month in 2019.\n\nWhile their programs were initially designed to directly inspire the next generation of STEM leaders, Exploding Bacon has successfully amplified their efforts by creating programs that resonate with other FIRST teams. The ultimate resources in FIRST are the participants who inspire everyday. Exploding Bacon works to magnify this individual impact, creating a unifying force for cultural change. Cultivating global collaboration, fostering opportunity & magnifying inspiration.\n\n1902 Award Materials\n\n1902 Essay & Executive Summaries\n\n1902 Chairman's Presentation\n\nMountaineer Area Robotics (MARS) Team 2614 from Morgantown, West Virginia was honored with the FIRST Championship Chairman’s Award at the 2017 St. Louis FIRST Championship.\n\nThe MARS mission is to inspire youth in rural and underserved areas around the world to pursue their creative and intellectual passions. MARS does this through community outreach and the development of technical programs designed for students to learn practical life skills. Using robotics as a foundation, MARS encourages West Virginia students to pursue post-secondary education. They helped incorporated LEGO Robotics and Core Values into the curriculum in 3 schools in their county, so much so that more children in the area compete in FIRST than in football. In addition to their strides in schools in their community, Team 2614 also hosts an off-season event unlike any other.\n\n2614 Award Materials\n\n2614 Essay & Executive Summaries\n\n2614 Chairman's Presentation\n\nSimbotics Team 1114 from St Catharines, Ontario, Canada won the FIRST Championship Chairman’s Award at the 2012 FIRST Championship in St. Louis, MO.\n\nAt the time of their submission, they started 12 FIRST Robotics Competition teams and 47 FIRST LEGO League teams. Each student on the team worked side by side with a mentor to better their skills. The team focused on strong mentorship and dedication to the task at hand. In addition to the teams they mentored, Team 1114 worked hard to better FIRST Robotics Competition teams with whom they had no relation, thus encouraging FIRST‘s message.\n\nFalcon Robotics, Team 842, from the heart of Phoenix, Arizona won the FIRST Championship Chairman’s Award at the 2008 FIRST Championship in Atlanta, GA.\n\nThe team represents what can be done to improve student’s success in the area of STEM education in an inner-city school from a large metropolitan city. Since its inception, the team had been challenging the paradigms of the day by its surprising success. Alumni from the team have been extremely successful as well. The lessons learned in FIRST last well beyond the robot competition. The team had its break out moment in 2004 when in an underwater robotics competition they bested the likes of MIT to win the national title. Once students at Carl Hayden High school showed that they can overcome difficult obstacles to be successful despite the apparently insurmountable odds, the floodgate opened. The spirit of the team was captured in the Hollywood film, Spare Parts, that depicts the story of how they beat MIT. The critically acclaimed documentary Underwater DREAMS shows the real story behind the success of the team and the lasting legacy that victory over MIT has had. The team continues to be an inspiration to many all over the world.\n\nvideo help from White Dwarf Productions\n\nChief Delphi, Team 47 was honored to win the FIRST Championship Chairman's Award at the 1997 FIRST Championship in Orlando, FL. The team received the award for their dedication to and pioneering of Youth STEM outreach programs, forming the CADET (Children Aspiring to Develop Engineering Talent) Program to involve middle and elementary school students in a FIRST like competition. Current FIRST students served as mentors for CADET members in a model that would eventually inspire the first iteration of the FIRST LEGO League competition years later. In addition, Chief Delphi would host the annual Chief Delphi Invitational; a FIRST like Competition program for other FIRST teams and community members. Later, in 2002, Chief Delphi launched ChiefDelphi.com, an online forum for FIRST members to communicate.\n\nIn 2010, as Pontiac Central and Pontiac Northern High Schools consolidated into a single school, Chief Delphi merged with Team 65, The Huskie Brigade, to form the new Team 51, The Wings of Fire. Team 51 continued its partnerships with community organizations and major sponsors from both teams. Today, The Wings of Fire continue to host and support STEM outreach programs in partnerships with local community organizations, the School District of the City of Pontiac, and team sponsors. Additionally, Team 51 supports all FIRST programs within the Pontiac School District and provides information, resources, and assistance to FIRST Teams across the globe. The legacy of Team 51 has entered into its “2nd generation” and is now mentored mainly by alumni of both Chief Delphi and the Huskie Brigade. The Wings of Fire continue to live by their longtime team motto: “You get out of this program what you put into it.”"
