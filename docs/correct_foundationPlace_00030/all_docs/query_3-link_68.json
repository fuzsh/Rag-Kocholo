        "text": "From Poland to Montréal\n\nIn 1953, when Myer Lewkowicz arrived in Canada, he didn’t know the first thing about baking anything, let alone bagels. He’d grown up in a large, poor family in a Jewish shtetl or village near Krakow, Poland. In 1942, he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. Years later, while speaking to a high school class, Lewkowicz said, “At Buchenwald, all I dreamt of was a piece of bread.”\n\nLewkowicz lived and worked in Germany after the war until he was discovered by Jewish Immigration Aid Services of Canada in 1952. He came to Montréal, where he got a job at Hyman Seligman’s Montréal Bagel Bakery on St-Laurent. Lewkowicz learned the bagel trade and just five years later, Myer and his wife Emma set up their own shop with Seligman on St-Viateur street, which is now our landmark St-Viateur Bagel shop.\n\nGrowing and Giving Back\n\nSt-Viateur Bagel is a family owned and operated business. Over the past 65 years, we have grown to include 7 bakeries, 4 of which are Bagel Cafés.\n\nSt-Viateur Bagel has been featured in newspapers and TV shows on Food Network and the Travel Channel, like Anthony Bourdain’s No Reservations and The Layover, Bob Blumer’s Glutton for Punishment, and The Today Show with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb. Thousands of customers have visited the Bagel Shop, from native Montréalers to international tourists and celebrities—like local repeat customers Leonard Cohen, William Shatner, Céline Dion, Georges St-Pierre, Roberto Luongo, and Mordecai Richler, and also famous out-of-towners like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Kelly Ripa, and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nDespite this continent-wide recognition, St-Viateur Bagel remains firmly rooted in its local community, determined to give back to the Montréal neighbourhoods that have supported them for so long.\n\nA warm, perfectly toasted bagel will turn any breakfast into a satisfying experience. For 17 years, St-Viateur bagel hosted an annual charity breakfast at its Monkland location to help raise funds for the Generations Foundation, an organization that provides nutritious meals to underprivileged schoolchildren. St-Viateur Bagel is proud to have made a difference in the lives of Montréal’s children.\n\nTo mark major anniversaries, St-Viateur Bagel hosts epic community block parties. In 2007 when celebrating its landmark 50th anniversary, the bakery raised upwards of $50,000 for the Foundation of Stars, an important organization that supports pediatric research in Québec. For it’s 60th anniversary, St-Viateur Bagel broke all previous records and, with the support of so many suppliers, friends, families and volunteers, raised over $60,000 for the same organization.\n\nSt-Viateur Bagel is dedicated to the community it serves and will continue to support it for many years to come."
