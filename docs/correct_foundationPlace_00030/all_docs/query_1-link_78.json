        "text": "The Meyer Foundation is delighted to announce the appointment of Jaqueline Tucker, Esq. as its new Vice President for Community Partnerships and Strategy following a nationwide search led by nonprofit executive search firm LeaderFit, effective August 1.\n\nIn this role, Jaqueline will lead the Foundation’s approach to pursuing community-driven priorities in its grantmaking through the lens of racial equity and justice, movement and power building, and systems change in collaboration with partners and stakeholders. Additionally, Jaqueline will lead Meyer’s Community Partnerships and Strategy Team.\n\nJaqueline brings to Meyer extensive experience in community engagement, nonprofit leadership, and strategic planning. Most recently, Jaqueline served as the City of Alexandria’s first Chief Race and Social Equity Officer where she developed and implemented the City’s first racial justice and social equity strategy, including a framework to make certain that community initiatives, policies, and programs are designed to ensure equitable outcomes for all residents. Previously, she served as the first East Region Project Manager with the Government Alliance on Race and Equity (GARE), a national network of governments working to achieve racial equity and advance opportunities for all, where she played an integral role in the ability for local and regional governments to build capacity and advance racial equity beyond theory into action. In addition to her proven track record of developing and implementing sustainable community partnerships and successful strategies to advance economic and racial equity, Jaqueline is a licensed attorney and has held positions as a legal analyst with Deloitte & Touche LLP, as a Freedom of Information attorney with the United States Department of Agriculture, as a community organizer with Families Empowered, and as an aide to members of the U.S. Congress.\n\n“Jaqueline’s experience championing racial equity by developing and advancing effective strategies, coupled with her strong ability to bridge communities and sectors make her an excellent fit to join the leadership team at Meyer and lend her expertise in the development of the next iteration of the Foundation’s strategic plan and programs,” says Meyer Foundation President and CEO George L. Askew, M.D. “We are thrilled to have her leadership in this work.”\n\nJaqueline holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Butler University and a Juris Doctor from the Howard University School of Law.\n\nStay tuned to learn more about Jaqueline and the body of work she will be leading at the Meyer Foundation!"
