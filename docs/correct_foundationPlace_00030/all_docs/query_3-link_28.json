        "text": "Our partnership flourishes through the generosity of alumni, friends, faculty, staff, corporations, foundations and, especially, volunteers and staff members. Our combined efforts help create and foster an environment in which teaching, learning and research positively affect the quality of life in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the rest of the world.\n\nThe foundation plays an important role in ensuring the viability of Concordiaâs numerous programs and initiatives. This happens through the continuing development of the foundationâs financial resources. While some gifts are used for short-term needs, the investment of gift proceeds for long-term and endowed purposes is essential.\n\nTotal assets under management include donated designated and endowed capital, as well as contributions from other capital sources at Concordia. The largest component of invested assets is the foundationâs long-term investment pool, which is managed in accordance with the portfolio-investment policy established by the foundationâs board upon the recommendation of the investment committee."
