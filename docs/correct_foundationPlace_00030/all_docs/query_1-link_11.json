        "text": "We are committed to ensuring the voices and needs of communities guide our work. This starts by listening. By learning from their lived experiences, we can help grantees lead community-driven solutions.\n\nChange starts from the ground up. With leaders rooted in their communities. Like parents creating new school models to meet the unique needs of their children. Farmers and ranchers embracing sustainable practices to protect water. And entrepreneurs from underserved and immigrant communities that are too often excluded from opportunity. We support their ideas and elevate their solutions to deliver lasting change to our most complex challenges.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion are catalysts for innovation and creativity. We embrace and celebrate our differences. Then we put our differences to work to solve global challenges.\n\nOur strategy prioritizes DEI because too many people are excluded from decisions that impact their lives. Like Communities of Color, which often face the first and worst impacts of education inequity and climate change.\n\nEffective philanthropy must listen to and include those with the most at stake. For this reason, we embed DEI across our grantmaking to ensure fair and equitable access to funding. We believe this collective effort yields better, lasting solutions.\n\nEvery day is a new learning opportunity. Across our work, we support people with big ideas who look past differences and find creative ways to solve problems.\n\nWe are committed to leading together and redefining what it means to collaborate.\n\nTo build new partnerships that unite people, resources and ideas. Itâ€™s work that comes to life through collaboration with tribal leaders to find solutions to the water crisis in the West. And partnerships with community leaders in the Arkansas and Mississippi Delta to create a more equitable economy.\n\nWe are committed to bridging divides. Looking for new allies. Finding common solutions. We collaborate not only because our partners advance the causes we support but because they share our belief in helping people and communities access opportunity. To give everyone a chance to thrive."
