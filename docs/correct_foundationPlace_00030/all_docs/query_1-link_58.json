        "text": "What is it?\n\nHuman-centered design is the gold standard for developing services that prioritize people’s needs and deliver as promised. This approach uses your input, behaviors and experiences to shape the solutions that meet your needs.\n\nWhy does the City need it?\n\nActively incorporating input before launching a new service lets us build processes around people, not the other way around. Creating simple, intuitive customer experiences means fewer customer service issues, more trust and transparency in the process, and less taxpayer dollars spent recovering from confusing or convoluted experiences.\n\nA resident of San Diego, Sunny is looking to open a new surfboard and burrito shop. Example of a bad experience: Sunny had to delay their grand opening due to disorganized webpages, long hold times, and an unclear sense of all the permits they needed to obtain. Example of a good experience: When Sunny opened for business, a personalized, real-time checklist in their online portal made permitting a breeze and opening day an on-time success!\n\nWhat is it?\n\nEvery interaction is designed to make sure you are on the path to a successful journey. This means providing meaningful status updates for a service request, giving accurate time estimates for the next step, and communicating promptly and clearly when action is needed on their part. Breaking down customer experiences into specific interactions lets us examine each step under a magnifying glass to see how we can improve the overall experience — whether through technology or process upgrades.\n\nWhy does the City need it?\n\nEnhancing services does not mean just adding a button to a website or creating a fancy new app — it involves examining how a process best works to determine what the design should be or the technology it should use.\n\nSunny moves to a new house and remembers they need to contact the City to start their water service. Example of bad experience: Because water services can only be started by an agent over the phone, Sunny needed to wait until the next morning to start their service. Also, unknown to Sunny, the system did not save their autopay information, so months later they will be calling and waiting on hold again to dispute late fees. Example of good experience: Using one online portal, Sunny is able to start their new water service and set up autopay in minutes before getting overwhelmed on move-in day!\n\nWhat is it?\n\nThe best customer experiences offer a seamless start-to-finish journey; like catching a direct flight instead of a connecting one. This happens when people are guided toward their desired outcome, stops or transitions are invisible to the customer, and all touch interactions are aligned for the customer experience.\n\nWhy does the City need it?\n\nThe behind-the-scenes process directly impacts the results you see, as well as how efficiently the City can provide a service. Improving processes means breaking down departmental divides and examining the end-to-end “customer journey” necessary to complete a given task. You should be able to request any service without knowing which department is operationally responsible and have a consistent experience, regardless of who the request ultimately goes to.\n\nWhile driving home from their shop, Sunny hits a pothole and decides to report it to the City. Example of a bad experience: Sunny notices a pothole they created has been closed without fixing the pothole. After calling and waiting on hold, they learn it was closed because it might be incorporated into an upcoming street project. Sunny is annoyed they had to call for this information and still have no clear timeline. Example of good experience: After reporting a pothole, Sunny is automatically provided with information on other relevant street projects in the area. They are also given a timeline for the pothole repair that is updated regularly and explanations for any delays.\n\nThis recommendation, available as a smaller and larger project, would provide a one-stop shop for people interested in engaging with the City but unsure where to go, how to do it, or for what exactly they’re looking.\n\n1A Public Service Directory\n\nBuilding a public-facing service directory is the first tangible action in this strategy. This public directory will become a centerpiece of the City’s website and include key information on how to access the service (e.g. the channels the service is offered on, where to start the process, hours of operation, etc.).\n\n1B Internal Service Directory\n\nIn addition to the public version of the directory, we recommend collecting and maintaining a more extensive internal directory to help us prioritize projects that have the potential to make the most public impact for the least cost. The efficiencies gained from this new resource means more people helped, shorter response times, higher customer satisfaction and money saved!\n\nFUN FACT: The City’s digital front door, sandiego.gov, gets around 30 million hits a year!\n\nWhen information is correct and readily available, would-be calls are deflected and those that get through are handled quickly and accurately by agents with access to quality information. Given the expanse of our digital content, we have developed both a smaller and larger scope recommendation:\n\n2A Use Service Directory to Identify and Fix High-Volume, Low-Quality Content\n\nThe service directory developed in Recommendation 1B will act as a guide to identify high-impact, key areas to improve. Ultimately, we would deliver validated content supported by a new structure that will allow us to review, refine and maintain future information.\n\n2B Full-scale Content Management\n\nA more robust effort would commit the City to reviewing and validating all of our individual webpages. In addition to just reviewing the content, we would also examine the structure and design of the website itself.\n\nWithout feedback, the City wouldn’t know how we’re performing, or worse, we may be ignoring the voice of the people. We need a method to systematically improve services and act on feedback.\n\n3A Create Feedback Loops For All Services\n\nA feedback loop is a way for you to share their experience with the people providing it. Although some services already have feedback loops, there are many without one. A formal feedback mechanism is crucial to accurately and comprehensively understand if our services are satisfying customers.\n\n3B Start a CX Analysis Program\n\nWhile the first step is to gather information, the second step is to analyze and identify trends, root causes and areas of improvement. This step turns raw data into something actionable. A team of CX analysts is necessary to own the data, systematically analyze it, discover insights, and highlight where we need improvement.\n\n3C Use Performance Coaches to Drive Improvements\n\nDepartments need change agents to help drive improvements. The final step is to turn the CX analysis into action, making actual process changes and improving the overall experience in sustainable and repeatable ways. By following the Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework, the industry standard for change management and process improvement, performance coaches would work closely with departments to make improvements based on the insights learned from customer feedback by the CX analysts.\n\nTo create solutions that serve people, it’s critical to talk directly with people. This recommendation builds a foundation to:\n\nReach out to meet people where they are.\n\nCollect customer input and thoughts.\n\nOrganize people’s feedback for analysts (Recommendation #3B) to make tangible improvements.\n\n4A Meet People Where They Are … Literally\n\nTo raise awareness of all the City has to offer and ensure equitable service delivery, we need to form a team of City personnel to uplift the voices of our communities. As part of this effort, the team will attend and host local events, working hand-in-hand with communities to educate people on the many digital resources the City offers and how to access them.\n\n4B Create Ways for People to Engage and Provide Direct Feedback\n\nCustomers are eager to provide feedback about City services, forms and content. To harness this energy in our community, we need a way to allow individuals to voluntarily participate in future surveys, user testing, focus groups or other feedback opportunities. By building a bank of eager customers ready to let us know their thoughts, we will be better equipped to tweak and tailor digital services before they go live, reducing time spent recovering from failures that could have been easily prevented had we just asked."
