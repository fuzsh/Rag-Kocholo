Spearheaded by Community Foundations of Canada and led by community foundations in Canada and around the world.\n\nVital Signs uses local knowledge to measure the vitality of a community and support action towards improving collective quality of life. Local data gathered through the program is used to support evidence-based, locally-relevant solutions to improve the quality of life at the community level. Vital Signs aims to inspire civic engagement, to provide focus for public debate, and to help a range of actors take action and direct resources where they will have the greatest impact.\n\nCFC provides Canadian community foundations access to national data sets, which foundations complement with local surveys, public programming and events that mobilize community knowledge and help identify local priorities. From housing, to transit, to safety, the environment, the arts and gender equality, the reports offer invaluable insights across more than 70 indicators of quality of life at the community level.\n\nSince 2017, CFC and community foundations have also begun to align our national data sets with Agenda 2030, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDG framework allows us as well as community foundations to measure local Canadian data against common global indicators and that of communities around the world.\n\nReconnecting Communities – A National Report\n\nThe National Vital Signs report is an opportunity to examine at a national level themes that are impacting communities across the country and look at data from a national level. Previous reports have focused on topics such as belonging and gender equality."
