We recognize that the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation are stewards of the lands and waters of this territory, which has long been a place where meetings and exchanges among nations have occurred.\n\nWe envision a future in which our economy and social systems promote the thriving of all people, and in which the natural environment is stewarded for generations to come. We see all sectors working together to address climate change, to help foster reconciliation, and unleash individual creativity and organizational resources to solve social challenges and to strengthen communities.\n\nIn a year of uncertainty and change, the inspiring work our partners do in their communities has been a beacon of hope. Learn more about their impact in our latest Year in Review."
