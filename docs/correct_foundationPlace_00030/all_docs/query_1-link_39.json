With the benefit of historically strong leadership and the arrival of new vision on campus, Oklahoma State University will leverage its unique Cowboy Culture in the cultivation of Ideal Graduates who impact the state, influence the nation and transform the world, extending expertise and new knowledge to communities across Oklahoma and reigniting the flame of citizen service. This is what Oklahoma’s Land-Grant will do. The time for Oklahoma State University is now."
