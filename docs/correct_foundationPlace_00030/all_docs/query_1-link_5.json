        "text": "Friday Reflections: The Evolution of the Golden Rule of Ethics -> The New Golden Rule or the Platinum Rule There is an important philosophical shift happening that is affecting organizations worldwide. This shift was already underway before COVID-19 and has only accelerated since then. It influences how we lead, manage, develop strategy, and cultivate workplace culture (or not! üòä). This shift is an ethical and moral philosophy transition. Let me explain further. For several decades, organizational culture has been understood as the values and behaviors that demonstrate these values, a view rooted in virtue ethics. However, there is a shift from virtue ethics to relational ethics. Virtue ethics is a moral philosophy that emphasizes the development of good character traits (virtues) and the cultivation of moral excellence as the basis for ethical behavior. Yet in practice virtue ethics quickly turns into \"shall, ought to, must\" which takes away a lot of human agency and empathy. Relational ethics is a moral philosophy that emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and the ethical responsibilities that arise from them, focusing on empathy, care, and mutual respect. This view suggest exploring ethics in the process of relationship. This is in my idea true empathy or lived empathy. To understand this shift, I want to introduce you to the ‚Äúethics of care,‚Äù a concept within relational ethics in moral philosophy. Ethics of care, defined and pioneered by philosopher Nel Noddings, emphasizes caring relationships as a foundation for ethical behavior. For two decades, I have been advocating for humanizing leadership and organizations, rooted in ethics of care and relational ethics. Relational ethics helps us practice true empathy rather than ‚Äúassumed empathy.‚Äù In virtue ethics, the golden rule is ‚Äútreat others as you want to be treated.‚Äù However, our perception of others is often clouded by our biases, fallacies, assumptions, and distortions. In relational ethics and ethics of care, we lead with a new golden rule or platinum rule: ‚Äútreat others as they want to be treated.‚Äù This simple shift represents an important ethical and moral transformation, affecting our entire approach to strategy, culture, and leadership. At the heart of leading with culture lies the fundamental leadership principle of caring for and taking care of your people. This requires truly listening, understanding, and connecting‚Äînot assuming or guessing. Final note - As John C. Maxwell titled one of his books: \"Everyone Communicates, Few Connects\" he highlights the importance of this true connection, relational ethics, and care. So, maybe this is not just a current topic but yet another timeless principle to bring more focus. ==== In these Friday reflections, I get quite geeky and philosophical. I hope to use the comments as an opportunity to listen and learn from each other. Thank you!\n\n4 Foundations of Strategy 1) Strategic Thinking - MINDSET - THINKING 2) Strategic Planning - PROCESS - DOING 3) Strategy Design, Formulation - FOCUS, PRIORITIZATION - THINKING 4) Strategy Execution, Implementation - HABIT - DOING 1) Strategic Thinking & 2) Strategic Planning ‚û°Ô∏è Strategic Thinking is a mindset interwoven in creativity, futuristic thinking, challenging status quo, cultivating imagination. (See my post on strategic thinking: https://lnkd.in/gfKj5NyT) ‚û°Ô∏è Strategic Planning is the process an organization following sequencing activities, analysis, alignment and prioritization. Several leaders focus more on the strategic planning process and less on the strategic thinking and mindsets that enhance strategic planning. I encourage all strategy sessions and leadership development to bring mindset training as a foundation. See my posts on mindsets: https://lnkd.in/gMXWMvtp https://lnkd.in/gMn_CBPH 3) Strategy Design, Formulation & 4) Strategy Execution, Implementation ‚û°Ô∏è Strategy Design & Formulation is about the alignment and articulation of the strategy. ‚û°Ô∏è Strategy Execution/Implementation is the follow-through and the management of the action plan and progress. Strategy Design & Formulation is frequently overcomplicated. There are no shortage of tools and approaches for the strategy design. Strategy designs needs to be less about the toolkit (SWOT, PESTEL, OKRs, etc..), more about the alignment and cohesion of the leadership team. Hence an inclusive facilitation of the strategy design/formulation is critical. Strategy Execution frequently focuses on creating linear action plans and in practice, the implementation faces many obstacles in terms of mindsets and habits. Another challenge is the movement between collective actions and personal action plans. I have built an approach and methodology of implementation coaching, holding leaders capable and accountable for implementing their action plans. ============== Interested in becoming a Strategy & Implementation Consultant? At Strategy.Inc, we developed the Certified Strategy & Implementation Consultant (CSIC) program, pioneering a human-centered, non-traditional approach to strategy.

In business, a \"flywheel\" is a powerful concept that describes how companies can create self-reinforcing cycles of growth. Unlike a traditional funnel model, a flywheel gains momentum over time, leading to compounding returns. Key aspects of a business flywheel: ‚ó¶ Interconnected components that feed into each other ‚ó¶ Builds momentum gradually, then accelerates ‚ó¶ Aligns with core business model and strategy A well-designed flywheel turns your strategic advantages into a virtuous cycle. For example, Amazon's flywheel leverages low prices to drive volume, enabling further cost reductions. How does your business model create reinforcing loops? Identifying and optimizing your flywheel can be a game-changer for long-term success. Notable examples of flywheels at work are: Amazon: Lower prices ‚Üí More customers ‚Üí More sellers join platform More sellers ‚Üí Increased selection ‚Üí More customers More customers ‚Üí Economies of scale ‚Üí Lower costs ‚Üí Lower prices Netflix: More content ‚Üí More subscribers ‚Üí More revenue More revenue ‚Üí Invest in better content ‚Üí Attract more subscribers Spotify: More users ‚Üí More data ‚Üí Better recommendations Better recommendations ‚Üí Improved user experience ‚Üí More users and listening time More listening time ‚Üí More ad revenue and subscriptions ‚Üí Ability to license more content LinkedIn: More professionals join ‚Üí More valuable network ‚Üí Attracts more professionals More user data ‚Üí Better job matches and content ‚Üí Increased user engagement Uber: More riders ‚Üí Attracts more drivers ‚Üí Reduced wait times Reduced wait times ‚Üí Better user experience ‚Üí More riders More rides ‚Üí Lower prices ‚Üí More riders Google: More searches ‚Üí Better search results ‚Üí More users More users ‚Üí More ad revenue ‚Üí Invest in better technology Better technology ‚Üí Improved user experience ‚Üí More searches Each flywheel is closely tied to the company's business model and competitive advantage.

Alongside it, there must be a clear, practical, and aligned plan‚Äîlet‚Äôs call this the roadmap or the action plan. Without these, success is merely a stroke of luck or the result of market tides. Yet, once the organization has the strategy and the plan, the way people collaborate and cooperate becomes the decisive factor in realizing the plan. This is precisely how I define workplace culture: culture is how we collaborate and cooperate at work. It encompasses many facets and layers. In the simplest terms, how we collaborate and cooperate can be helpful, fruitful, and wholesome, or it can be harmful, hindering, and ineffective. This is where our thoughts, words, and actions come into play. Our words, thoughts, and actions shape the rules of engagement, the meetings, the onboarding, and thus, the norming and cultural practices begin to take hold. To clarify further, the daily words and behaviors of leaders, as well as those of each employee, shape how we collaborate and cooperate every single moment. Implementation is not just about dashboards or balanced scorecards; it‚Äôs about how people work together. We need the scoreboards or the GPS to navigate, yet it‚Äôs the collective effort that moves the needle. This is why I focus on the North Star of individuals and teams, connecting strategy, culture, and leadership with awareness, cohesiveness, and wisdom at work. #strategy #culture #Northstar\n\nWhat are the building blocks of leadership and personal growth? The answer lies in 'KSAs': Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Competencies. Knowledge refers to the theoretical understanding of a subject. This includes facts, concepts, principles, and processes. For example, knowing project management principles, programming languages, or HR practices. Skills are the practical applications of knowledge, developed through practice and experience. Examples include creating a project plan, writing Python code, or conducting job interviews. Abilities are innate traits or talents that tend to remain stable over time. These include analytical thinking, problem-solving, physical coordination, and verbal communication. Competencies are the combination of knowledge, skills, and abilities essential for effective job performance. For instance, leadership competency involves understanding management theories (knowledge), inspiring a team (skill), and making decisions (ability). Connections and Differences Building Blocks: Knowledge (what), skills (how), and abilities (potential) form the foundation of competencies. Integration: Competencies bring together KSAs to illustrate behaviors that indicate job proficiency. Development: Knowledge is acquired through education, skills through practice, abilities can be enhanced, and competencies are developed by combining KSAs. Now, here's the exciting part: At Strategy.Inc, we are creating a comprehensive competency framework focused on workplace strategy. This framework will help organizations improve how they select, assess, and develop leaders and talent, specifically regarding strategy. I know you might have a lot of questions, so stay tuned! If you're interested in learning more, we are looking to partner with a few select mid-sized and large organizations for research and prototyping. #leadershipdevelopment #softskills #selfdevelopment\n\nIn this post, I summarize the theoretical construct and research findings of Clapp-Smith, et al. (2009). The framework explores the relationship between authentic leadership, positive psychological capital (PsyCap), and team performance, with trust in management as a mediating variable. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: 1. Authentic Leadership: Characterized by leaders who are self-aware, transparent, and guided by strong moral values, authentic leadership positively influences the trust that team members have in them. 2. Positive Psychological Capital (PsyCap): Consisting of self-efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism, high levels of PsyCap among team members create a positive climate within the team, enhancing trust in management. 3. Trust in Management: This mediating factor connects both authentic leadership and PsyCap to team performance. Trust fosters a supportive environment where team members invest their time and resources, leading to improved performance. 4. Team Performance: The ultimate outcome measured in the study, influenced by the levels of authentic leadership and PsyCap within the team, mediated by trust in management. The model suggests that when leaders are authentic and team members have high PsyCap, trust in management increases, enhancing team performance, including sales growth. Key Findings: Authentic Leadership and Team Performance: ‚ó¶ Authentic leadership significantly predicts changes in performance. Leaders who exhibit self-awareness, transparency, and ethical conduct foster a trusting environment, enhancing team performance. The study confirmed that authentic leadership positively impacts performance by increasing trust within the team. Positive Psychological Capital (PsyCap) and Trust: ‚ó¶ PsyCap, which includes self-efficacy, hope, resilience, and optimism, is significantly related to trust in management. The research demonstrated that trust fully mediates the relationship between PsyCap and performance. Teams with higher levels of PsyCap tend to trust their leaders more, leading to better performance outcomes. Mediating Role of Trust: ‚ó¶ Trust is a critical mediator between both authentic leadership and PsyCap, and team performance. This highlights the importance of building trust within teams to leverage the positive effects of leadership and psychological capital. In sum: ‚ó¶ Both authentic leadership and PsyCap contribute to improved team performance, mediated by trust in management. ‚ó¶ Authentic leadership enhances team performance by fostering a trustworthy environment where team members feel confident and supported. ‚ó¶ Positive psychological capital enhances trust in management, boosting performance. ‚ó¶ Organizations should focus on developing authentic leadership qualities among their leaders and enhancing the psychological capital of their teams. ‚ó¶ Building and maintaining trust in management is essential for translating leadership and psychological strengths into tangible performance improvements.\n\nIn this series of posts, I explore cohesion, conflict, and team effectiveness. In today‚Äôs post, I review the five pillars of team effectiveness. Matt Starchevich and Steven Stonell's Team Effectiveness Model (1990) outlines key components necessary for high-performing teams. Their model emphasizes 5 pillars and explores the relationship between these components. Goals - bring direction and consist of values, vision, mission, purpose, strategies, priorities, & performance. This is what I typically call the North Star. Roles - bring integration and include: structure, job design, responsibilities, specializations, skills and resources. These are part of the operational culture, governance, talent and capabilities. Processes & Procedures - optimize the systems and involve: Problem solving, decision making, communication, meetings, planning and implementation. These are again part of the operational culture - how to collaborate and cooperate to resolve challenges and move forward. Relationships - foster trust and cohesiveness through acceptance, support, involvement, diversity, conflict management, listening. These relate to psychological capital and also what I call culture as employee experience, lived experience. Leadership - brings inspiration and empowers others with coaching, modeling, flexibility, management, representation. This relates to what I call leadership role modeling / embodiment and also leader as a coach and mentor abilities. The team effectiveness model is a good reminder of the complexities of driving an organization. While clarity of strategy and direction are an important prerequisite, driving the needle forward, executing, implementing requires exploring the complexity within the system and the organization. This is what we do with our work and network of consultants and coaches. #teameffectiveness #peoplemanagement #businessdevelopment\n\nIn this series of posts on Psychological Capital (PsyCap), I decode one of the most crucial intangible assets of an organization. In today‚Äôs post, I share 12 concrete ideas, suggestions, approaches for developing psychological capital at work: 1. Hope Goal Setting: Encourage setting clear, attainable goals. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps can help maintain motivation and a sense of accomplishment. Pathways Thinking: Develop multiple strategies to achieve goals. When one path is blocked, having alternative routes can maintain momentum toward the goal. Agency Thinking: Foster a sense of agency by highlighting past successes and reinforcing the belief that one can influence outcomes through their actions. 2. Optimism Positive Reframing: Teach individuals to reframe negative experiences by focusing on what can be learned from them and viewing challenges as opportunities for growth. Gratitude Exercises: Encourage regular practice of gratitude, such as keeping a gratitude journal, to shift focus from negative to positive aspects of life. Vision Boards: Create vision boards that visualize positive future outcomes, reinforcing a hopeful and optimistic outlook. 3. Self-Efficacy Mastery Experiences: Provide opportunities for individuals to succeed in challenging tasks. Each success builds confidence in their abilities. Modeling: Expose individuals to role models who demonstrate confidence and competence in similar tasks. Observing others‚Äô success can boost self-belief. Social Persuasion: Use verbal encouragement and positive feedback to build confidence. Creating environments where individuals feel supported can enhance self-efficacy. 4. Resilience Reality Testing: Teach individuals to face reality and accept it, which can help in coping with adversity effectively. Encouraging realistic optimism rather than unfounded positive thinking is key. Meaning-Making: Help individuals find meaning in difficult situations, which can provide purpose and motivation to endure hardships. Improvisation Skills: Encourage creative problem-solving and flexibility in approaching challenges. Developing the ability to adapt and use available resources effectively is crucial for resilience. In summary, psychological capital is one of the less known facets of building a people focused workplace culture. Psychological Capital Interventions (PCI) are proven to improve overall well-being and performance in various settings. Now here is the bold hypothesis - I claim that working with a well-equiped, talented coach can help leaders develop not just their own psychological capitals but also the team‚Äôs psy cap through the leader‚Äôs development.

Offer advice only when it is requested. Unsolicited advice is often unwelcome and can be seen as intrusive. Save your wisdom for those who seek it and are ready to listen. Remember, unsolicited advice is seldom heard. Do you have success in the topic? Share advice only if you have experienced success in the topic at hand. If your advice stems from your mistakes, acknowledge it as such. Guidance based on errors is valuable as cautionary tales, but it differs from advice rooted in success Is your advice for you or for the person asking? Not all advice is beneficial. True wisdom considers the needs of the seeker, not the desires of the giver. Avoid projecting your dreams and aspirations onto others. Advice should be tailored to the individual's unique circumstances, not a reflection of your personal journey Do you understand the person's world? Offer guidance only after you have taken the time to understand the person's context. While universal principles can be shared, their application will vary. Assist others in crafting their plans with advice grounded in these principles, yet adapted to their specific situation Are you giving the same advice to everyone? If your counsel is identical for all, you are not truly listening or understanding the individual. Wisdom lies in recognizing the nuances of each person's situation and offering guidance that is uniquely suited to their path. For Those Who Seek Advice Select carefully who you ask advice from. Seek guidance from those who have achieved success in the areas where you seek advice. Many will offer opinions on topics they know little about. Distinguish between knowledgeable advice and uninformed opinion. Consider the value of advice from mistakes. Advice based on acknowledged mistakes is valuable but differs from guidance born of success. Both perspectives are important, yet they serve different purposes in your decision-making process. Seek advice from those who strive to understand you. True wisdom comes from those who take the time to comprehend your unique situation. Beware of those who merely project their own desires and dreams through their advice. Recognize the difference between good advice and opinions. Most people share opinions rather than genuine advice. Discern the difference to ensure you are receiving valuable guidance. Do not seek advice if you are not ready to listen. If you ask for advice but are unwilling to consider it, you may be asking the wrong person or letting your ego hinder your learning. Approach advice with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Are you seeking advice or approval? Understand the difference between seeking advice and seeking approval. The need for validation should not cloud your quest for genuine guidance. Keep these needs separate to gain the most benefit from the advice you receive. #mentorship #leadership #wisdom"
