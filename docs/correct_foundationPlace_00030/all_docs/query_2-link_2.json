        "text": "Our most serious challenges—such as climate change, sustainability, social inequity, and global public health—are inherently spatial. To solve such complex problems, we must first understand their geography.\n\nThe geographic approach is a way of thinking and problem-solving that integrates and organizes all relevant information in the crucial context of location. Leaders use this approach to reveal patterns and trends; model scenarios and solutions; and ultimately, make sound, strategic decisions.\n\nGeography is a way of pulling all key information about an issue together, expanding the questions we can ask about a place or a problem and the creative solutions we can bring to bear.\n\nGeography is being revitalized by a world of sensors and connectivity and made more powerful by modern geographic information system (GIS) software. With today's sophisticated digital maps, we can apply our best data science and analysis to convert raw data into location intelligence—insights that empower real-time understanding and transform decision-making."
