        "text": "Every business leader wants their organization to succeed. Turning a profit and satisfying stakeholders are worthy objectives but aren’t feasible without an effective business strategy.\n\nTo attain success, leaders must hone their skills and set clear business goals by crafting a strategy that creates value for the firm, customers, suppliers, and employees. Here's an overview of business strategy and why it's essential to your company’s success.\n\nFree E-Book: How to Formulate a Successful Business Strategy\n\nAccess your free e-book today.\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nWhat’s a Business Strategy?\n\nBusiness strategy is the strategic initiatives a company pursues to create value for the organization and its stakeholders and gain a competitive advantage in the market. This strategy is crucial to a company's success and is needed before any goods or services are produced or delivered.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business School Online's Business Strategy course, an effective strategy is built around three key questions:\n\nHow can my business create value for customers?\n\nHow can my business create value for employees?\n\nHow can my business create value by collaborating with suppliers?\n\nMany promising business initiatives don’t come to fruition because the company failed to build its strategy around value creation. Creativity is important in business, but a company won't last without prioritizing value.\n\nThe Importance of Business Strategy\n\nA business strategy is foundational to a company's success. It helps leaders set organizational goals and gives companies a competitive edge. It determines various business factors, including:\n\nPrice: How to price goods and services based on customer satisfaction and cost of raw materials\n\nSuppliers: Whether to source materials sustainably and from which suppliers\n\nEmployee recruitment: How to attract and maintain talent\n\nResource allocation: How to allocate resources effectively\n\nWithout a clear business strategy, a company can't create value and is unlikely to succeed.\n\nCreating Value\n\nTo craft a successful business strategy, it's necessary to obtain a thorough understanding of value creation. In the online course Business Strategy, Harvard Business School Professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee explains that, at its core, value represents a difference. For example, the difference between a customer's willingness to pay for a good or service and its price represents the value the business has created for the customer. This difference can be visualized with a tool known as the value stick.\n\nThe value stick has four components, representing the value a strategy can bring different stakeholders.\n\nWillingness to pay (WTP): The maximum amount a customer is willing to pay for a company's goods or services\n\nPrice: The actual price of the goods or services\n\nCost: The cost of the raw materials required to produce the goods or services\n\nWillingness to sell (WTS): The lowest amount suppliers are willing to receive for raw materials, or the minimum employees are willing to earn for their work\n\nThe difference between each component represents the value created for each stakeholder. A business strategy seeks to widen these gaps, increasing the value created by the firm’s endeavors.\n\nIncreasing Customer Delight\n\nThe difference between a customer's WTP and the price is known as customer delight. An effective business strategy creates value for customers by raising their WTP or decreasing the price of the company’s goods or services. The larger the difference between the two, the more value is created for customers.\n\nA company might focus on increasing WTP with its marketing strategy. Effective market research can help a company set its pricing strategy by determining target customers' WTP and finding ways to increase it. For example, a business might differentiate itself and increase customer loyalty by incorporating sustainability into its business strategy. By aligning its values with its target audiences', an organization can effectively raise consumers' WTP.\n\nIncreasing Firm Margin\n\nThe value created for the firm is the difference between the price of an item and its cost to produce. This difference is known as the firm’s margin and represents the strategy's financial success. One metric used to quantify this margin is return on invested capital (ROIC). This metric compares a business's operating income with the capital necessary to generate it. The formula for ROIC is:\n\nReturn on Invested Capital = Net Operating Cost After Tax (NOCAT) / Invested Capital (IC)\n\nROIC tells investors how successful a company is at turning its investments into profit. By raising WTP, a company can risk increasing prices, thereby increasing firm margin. Business leaders can also increase this metric by decreasing their costs. For example, sustainability initiatives—in addition to raising WTP—can lower production costs by using fewer or more sustainable resources. By focusing on the triple bottom line, a firm can simultaneously increase customer delight and margin.\n\nIncreasing Supplier Surplus & Employee Satisfaction\n\nBy decreasing suppliers' WTS, or increasing costs, a company can create value for suppliers—or supplier surplus. Since increasing costs isn't sustainable, an effective business strategy seeks to create value for suppliers by decreasing WTS. How a company accomplishes this varies. For example, a brick-and-mortar company might partner with vendors to showcase its products in exchange for a discount. Suppliers may also be willing to offer a discount in exchange for a long-term contract.\n\nIn addition to supplier WTS, companies are also responsible for creating value for another key stakeholder: its employees. The difference between employee compensation and the minimum they're willing to receive is employee satisfaction. There are several ways companies can increase this difference, including:\n\nIncreasing compensation: While most companies hesitate to raise salaries, some have found success in doing so. For example, Dan Price, CEO of Gravity Payments, increased his company's minimum wage to $80,000 per year and enjoyed substantial growth and publicity as a result.\n\nIncreasing benefits: Companies can also decrease WTS by making working conditions more desirable to prospective employees. Some offer remote or hybrid working opportunities to give employees more flexibility. Several have also started offering four-day work weeks, often experiencing increased productivity as a result.\n\nThere are several ways to increase supplier surplus and employee satisfaction without hurting the company's bottom line. Unfortunately, most managers only devote seven percent of their time to developing employees and engaging stakeholders. Yet, a successful strategy creates value for every stakeholder—both internal and external.\n\nStrategy Implementation\n\nCrafting a business strategy is just the first step in the process. Implementation takes a strategy from formulation to execution. Successful implementation includes the following steps:\n\nEstablish clear goals and key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nSet expectations and ensure employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities\n\nDelegate work and allocate resources effectively\n\nPut the plan into action and continuously monitor its progress\n\nAdjust your plan as necessary\n\nEnsure your team has what they need to succeed and agrees on the desired outcome\n\nEvaluate the results of the plan\n\nThroughout the process, it's important to remember to adjust your plan throughout its execution but to avoid second-guessing your decisions. Striking this balance is challenging, but crucial to a business strategy's success.\n\nLearn More About Creating a Successful Business Strategy\n\nBusiness strategy constantly evolves with changing consumer expectations and market conditions. For this reason, business leaders should continuously educate themselves on creating and executing an effective strategy.\n\nOne of the best ways to stay up-to-date on best practices is to take an online course, such as HBS Online's Business Strategy program. The course will provide guidance on creating a value-driven strategy for your business."
