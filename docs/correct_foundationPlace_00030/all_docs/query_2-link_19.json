        "text": "As the nation’s trusted source of information on Australia’s Earth sciences, Geoscience Australia empowers decision making by government, communities and industry. The breadth of our work covers the uniqueness of our island continent, our extensive marine jurisdictions and includes our frozen territories in the Antarctic.\n\nWe are inclusive, innovative, respectful and collaborative in leading Earth sciences for government, communities and industry. This contributes to a strong economy, a resilient society and a sustainable environment.\n\nFor over 110 years Australia’s prosperity and safety has been shaped by our knowledge of this dynamic landscape. Commonwealth geoscience has played an important role since the formation of the Australian Survey Office in 1910. For example, the nation’s first national topographic mapping program was driven by the need to defend Australia’s people and develop our regional areas. In later years, systematic mapping of the nation’s geology to understand our resource endowment and drive new discoveries has underpinned our successful economy.\n\nWe continue to deliver data of enduring value, and advice that helps government, communities and industry to address challenges and enhance opportunities facing Australia now and into the future. In doing so, we make the commitment to respectfully engage and collaborate with First Nations Australians, acknowledging that they are Australia’s original mappers, miners and navigators.\n\nOur work aligns with the National Science and Research Priorities and supports global and domestic government initiatives. It impacts key areas of society in:\n\nmaximising the value to society from our abundant mineral and energy resources\n\nstrengthening our resilience to natural hazards\n\noptimising and sustaining our water use\n\nsupporting the sustainable use of our marine environment and jurisdiction\n\nenabling location-based decisions and actions through best practice digital mapping, Earth observations and precise positioning, and\n\ncurating and presenting our vast data holdings to equip government, communities and industry with geoscience data and information for informed decisions.\n\nWe cannot achieve these without an internal commitment to be the best organisation we can be. We will do this by fostering a positive organisational culture, being an employer and partner of choice, continuing to deliver high quality science, and coming up with smarter, faster ways to access and use our data.\n\nA key part of our strategy involves continuing to develop a diverse and inclusive workplace, including through gender equity; we cannot be groundbreaking and successful if we do not draw from the full pool of human talent. Through investing in and celebrating our people, we support the entire organisation to deliver information and knowledge that will help drive Australia’s success.\n\nOur ten-year targets are clear, measurable objectives. In the years out to 2028 we will provide Australia with a new and exciting digital mapping platform, improved positioning and navigation services, analysis-ready Earth observation data for natural resource management, new satellite capabilities, and we will identify new major mineral, energy and groundwater resources. This will contribute to a safer, more prosperous and well-informed Australia."
