ADVERTISEMENT WHILE almost every town of consequence in the kingdom furnishes its Picture, or Guide, it may afford some surprise that the large commercial town of Newcastle upon Tyne, intimately connected as it is with the British metropolis, has hitherto offered no such assistance to direct the inquiries of the stranger.\n\nTo obviate this deficiency, the Editor was induced, some months ago, to collect materials for the present work. How far he has succeeded in the execution of his design, which was rather to point out than to describe what may be thought worthy attention, he leaves to the judgment of the reader; and, although he has endeavoured to render it as interesting as his plan would allow, he does not presume to think that there are not many inaccuracies, which, through the assistance of his friends, he may be enabled to correct in a future edition. Newcastle, Feb. 1807. THE\n\nPICTURE\n\nOF\n\nNEWCASTLE UPON TYNE.\n\n_____________________________\n\nNAME.\n\n1 WHEN Aelius Hadrianus made Britain his residence, about the 445th year of the christian era, he gave this town the appellation of Pons Aelii, from its being a Roman station, where a cohort of the Cornovii was then in garrison. This name it retained for nearly two centuries; but, afterwards, from its vicinity to the Roman Wall, it assumed the appellation of Ad Murum, On-the-wall and became a place of such consideration, as to be the residence of a Northumbrian king. Upon the Romans finally quitting the island, the poor inhabitants, having been unpractised 2 in the use of arms for many years, became an easy prey to foreign invaders, and particularly to the Danes and Saxons. The wall, however, afforded some security to the flying natives, and particularly to the Monks, who, during the fifth and sixth centuries, flocked in great numbers to Northumberland, and chiefly to the banks of the Tyne. This town then became the principal place of their residence, whence it obtained the name of Monkchester, by which it was known till the Norman conquest.\n\nWhen William got seated on the throne, he built a strong castle in this town. It was called the New Castle to distinguish it from an old one, which was situated a few miles higher up the river. In a short time Newcastle became the general appellation of the town, which name it has retained since that period.\n\nIn the year 1400, it was made a county of itself, under the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne and has of course a sheriff of its own, who is elected annually by the corporation.\n\nIt sends two members to parliament. The present representatives are Sir M. W. Ridley, Bart. and C. J. Branding, Esq.\n\nTHE TOWN WALL. THE local situation of Newcastle, and its vicinity to the Scots, the most dangerous and hostile of all its enemies, rendered its fortification absolutely necessary. An ancient chronicle, by Hardinge, tells us that in the reign of William Rufus this town was inclosed 3 by a wall. It was built of stone, of great height and thickness; and for ages was undoubtedly of great Strength. This assertion seems to be verified from the consideration, that although the northern counties of England were frequently over-run and depopulated by the Scots, sometimes even to the walls of York, yet during a whole century they were not able to take Newcastle. It had several gates, and was fortitied by towers and square turrets. The wall was surrounded by a fosse or ditch, which in some places is still visible, as on the outside of the wall that surrounds the Carliol Croft. The space which it occupied is yet called the King's Dykes.\n\nAfter the building of the wall had been completed, the town was divided into twenty-four wards, according to the number of gates and round towers in it, which were defended by their particular wardens.\n\nThe town wall ran up a steep ascent from the Close-gate to White Friar tower, so termed from its vicinity to the monastery of the Carmelites, or White Friars. There are 214 yards of wall yet very entire from this tower to Postern-gate, lately taken down,\n\nwhich was one of the strongest and best fortified parts of the wall, being secured by strong gates of oak with iron doors, and a very heavy portcullis. Between the Postern and Newgate are several small towers.\n\nOn account of the inroads of the Scots from the north, Newgate was fortified with uncommon strength. its portcullis still remains. It got its name in consequence of its being built on the site of an old one 4 called Berwick-gate, from its direction towards the frontier town of that name. The north side of this gate is adorned with some rude sculpture, consisting of a statue of King James 1st, three ancient shields of arms, St. George's cross, arms of England, and the Newcastle arms. The common prison is erected over this gate.\n\nThe next gate was at the head of Pilgrim Street, and was also strongly fortified; but it is now removed for the greater convenience of carriages.\n\nNext follow several small towers and then the site of Pandon-gate. This was secured by strong gates, which were of Roman architecture, and formed part of Severus's wall. It was taken down, by an order of the magistrates, to widen the passage in 1796. From Pandon-gate the wall ascends a steep hill, for about the space of 95 yards, to Carpenter or Wall Knoll tower. This tower was also of Roman construction, and likewise made part of Severus's Wall. From Carpenter tower the wall descends about 232 yards to the site of Sand-gate, which, with part of the adjoining wall, has been taken down. To fortify the town on the south side, the wall ran parallel with the river from Sand-gate, and had many gates opposite the chares or lanes leading into the town, but being inconvenient was removed in 1762.\n\nThe whole extent of the wall was about two miles. It twelve feet high and eight feet thick, and very firmly and compactly built. It yet remains perfect in many places.\n\nPOPULATION 5 THERE are four parishes in this town; St. Nicholas', All Saints', St. John's, and St. Andrew's.\n\nIn the year 1781 there were in the four parishes the following numbers of inhabited houses, according to the returns made by the collectors of the window tax. But in this account the uninhabited houses, as well as those inhabited by the poor, are omitted.\n\nIn pursuance of the population act passed in 1801, for taking an account of the inhabitants of Great Britain, the following was the account taken in Newcastle. ST. NICHOLAS' PARISH. Inhabited houses 501, occupied by 1074 families.\n\nUninhabited houses 44\n\nTOTAL 545 6 ALL SAINTS' PARISH. Inhabited houses 1577, occupied by 3795 families.\n\nUninhabited houses 66\n\nTOTAL 1643 ST. JOHN'S PARISH. Inhabited houses 619, occupied by 798 families,\n\nUninhabited houses 11\n\nTOTAL 630 ST. ANDREW'S PARISH. Inhabited houses 446\n\nUninhabited houses 12\n\nTOTAL 458 7 RECAPITULATION. From which it appears, that the increase of houses, in 20 years, had been 887.

Lodgers, travellers, and soldiers are also generally omitted. 8 STREETS. THE old streets in Newcastle are in general not very regular, those however of a modern date are planned with more taste. In directing the stranger to the principal ones, we shall begin with the QUAY SIDE. Formerly, when the town wall ran parallel with the river Tyne, this street on the inside of that barrier was very dark, and in wet weather intolerably dirty: it has, however, been so enlarged and improved by the removal of the wall, that it is now one of the most commodious wharfs in the kingdom. It measures 103 yards in length, and is from 60 to 120 feet in breadth.\n\nThe chares, or lanes, leading from the Quay to the higher part of the town, are twenty-one in number. They are dark and narrow. Continuing along the Quay westward, you come to the SAND-HILL. This, from being not at a very remote period a mound of sand, from which it obtained its name, is now the most frequented part of the town. When the tide was low the inhabitants were accustomed to assemble here for their amusement, but when it flowed the water ascended to the foot of the Dean, now called Dean Street. The Sand-Hill is of a triangular form, and is surrounded with shops, the Exchange, 9 &c. In the middle of the Sand-Hill, fronting the Exchange, (which we will describe when we mention public buildings) there was formerly a statue of James II on horse back, cast in copper and placed upon a white marble base, as large as the equestrian statue of Charles I. at Charing Cross, in London.\n\nIn 1688, the celebrated era of the restoration of British liberty, the people of Newcastle, inflamed with the revolutionary spirit of the times, precipitated it into the river. It is said to have been a master piece of art, cast by a Mr William Larson, and highly esteemed by Sir Christ. Wren. It cost the town Â£800. The political tempest of the revolution subsiding, the magistrates of Newcastle ordered the statue to be taken out of the river; but, instead of replacing it in its former situation, they cast with the metal a set of bells for All Saints' church. THE CLOSE. Passing the Exchange and end of the Bridge, pursue your course by a street named the Close, the narrowness of which occasioned this appellation, which it well deserves.\n\nThis street, being formerly a place of great security, was the residence of several of the most respectable inhabitants. Here stood the house of the Earl of Northumberland, on the side next the river, bounded on the east by Bower-Chare, between Tyne Bridge and the Javel Groop. Not long ago a large gate remained at its entrance, with a large round ball of stone, 10 and hence, probably, it is now called the Round Stone Entry : In 1482, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, demised it to his servant, George Bird, by the name of the Earl's Inn, at the annual rent of 13s. 4d.\n\nUpon entering the Close, a few yards on the right hand, you come to a flight of very steep steps, called Castle stairs, on both sides of which there is a number of old clothes shops, that constitute the rag fair of the town. Ascending these you reach a postern, where there have formerly been gates and bars of great strength, in defence of the castle.\n\nPassing the Mansion House, (which will be described afterwards,) and the flint glasshouses, you come to the west end of the Close, which terminates at Skinner Burn.\n\nReturning, ascend a flight of steps on the left, called Long Stairs. There runs from the top of these stairs, adjacent to the castle wall, a short street named Queen Street, previous to entering which on your left is another of similar dimensions, named Bailiff-gate, which brings you to the foot of WEST-GATE-STREET. This street was gradually built after the opulent families had quitted the lower streets, and retired to the higher parts of the town. It was till lately the best street in the town, being wide, clean, and well paved, with a good foot path on each side, and the houses well built. There are three small streets or lanes, which form communications between 11 West-gate-street and the Groat Market, Bigg Market, &c. named Denton Chare, Pudding Chare, and St. John's Lane. They are in general narrow, and, except the Pudding Chare, do not admit carriages. Near the head of West-gate-street, passing the assembly rooms, and a few houses called Fenkle Street, you come to Charlotte Square, which is tolerably spacious and airy, with a grass plot and shrubbery in the centre. The houses are on an elevated site and well built.\n\nFrom Fenkle Street, to the right, is a winding street, formerly called Shod Friar Chare, from its vicinity to the Black Friars Monastery, whose fraternity wore shoes, as those of the grey friars went barefoot. Its modern name is Low Friar Chare, in contra-distinction to the Upper, or High Friar Chare, in the vicinity of Newgate. This street contains that excellent institution the public Dispensary. BIGG MARKET. Leaving West-gate-street, by Pudding Chare, you enter Bigg Market, which branches downward into three divisions or lesser streets, parallel to each other. That next West-gate-street is called Groat Market; the next Middle Street; that eastward Flesh Market. Bigg Market takes its name from bigg or barley having formerly been sold there. It is a spacious street, above 100 feet wide, including the broad well flagged foot paths on each side. 12 GROAT MARKET. Groat Market was so named from its being the place where meal and groats were formerly to be had. It is now the principal daily market for household furniture, and contains the rooms and library of the Literary Society.\n\nMiddle Street is a narrow dark street, and has few good buildings. FLESH MARKET Flesh Market, as its name imports, is the market for butcher-meat, and is one of the best supplied in the North of England. It is held on Saturdays. The magistrates have it in contemplation to remove this market to a more convenient place, as no carriages can pass thro' it on Saturdays, a great inconvenience to the inhabitants of this part of the town. NEW-GATE-STREET. Proceeding along Bigg Market, at the head of which is Nungate, you pass to a good street called Newgate Street, in the middle of which stands a small building, formerly a market for milk, called the White Cross, near which is St. Andrew's Church and Newgate Prison. A long winding street, called High Friar Street, with very few buildings on the south side, runs north east to Pilgrim Street.\n\nPassing Newgate, on the left is Gallow-gate, a small street so called as being the way that leads to the place of execution for malefactors.\n\n13 At the lower end of Percy Street, on the west side, a new street is now building called Albion Street, and from that another called Albion Place. NORTHUMBERLAND STREET. When you enter the town by Barras Bridge, you meet the two principal streets ; that on your right is Percy Street, already mentioned, the other on your left is Northumberland Street, by far the most spacious and handsome street in the town.\n\nOn the north side of this street are some pleasant ranges of well built modern houses, called Saville Row, Saville Place, Queen's Square, Prince's Street, and Northumberland Place. Northumberland Street now imperceptibly joins PILGRIM STREET Though till lately it was separated by a gate and tower, now taken down for the better accommodation of carriages, and by which means the two streets have been much improved. Part of the wall, to which the gate was joined, still serves to shew where Pilgrim Street commences. On the right hand, not far from the head of this street, you will observe the ancient house of the late sir Walter Blackett, built, as it is said, upon the ruins of the Franciscan Monastery. It is a princely building with a large court in front, and is remarkable for having been the place of confinement of king Charles I. He remained a captive 14 here from May 6, 1646, until January 28, 1647, when he was delivered over, to the English Commissioners by the Scots for the sum of Â£400,000. Pass the end of High Bridge, a narrow street on your right, leading to Flesh Market, and continue on the same side past the end of Mosley Street: you will then observe, on the opposite side, a narrow winding street, called Manor Chare, which terminates at Stock Bridge, mentioned afterwards. At the foot of Pilgrim Street stands All Saint's Church, and keeping to the right hand descend Butcher Bank, a steep street so named from its being almost entirely occupied by butchers, who keep a daily market here. MOSLEY STREET Extends from Pilgrim Street to the foot of the Flesh Market, and is a modern built street, very airy and spacious. About the middle of it are the Theatre and Post Office. To open a better communication with West-gate-street, another street is now forming, from the foot of the Flesh Market, to be called Collingwood Street, in compliment to our illustrious townsman, lord Collingwood. DEAN STREET. This is also a new street, running perpendicularly from the centre of Mosley Street.\n\nIt has a gradual descent to the lower streets, and contains some of the handsomest shops in the town. The new butcher market is intended to be made in a line with 15 it, on the opposite side of Mosley Street, and will extend to the High Bridge, a narrow street running parallel to Mosley Street, and joining the head of the Flesh Market to Pilgrim Street, as Mosley Street does the foot of the Flesh Market to the same street. At the foot of Dean Street you enter the SIDE. A narrow inconvenient street, much incommoded by the carts of carriers, which are usually standing here to receive goods for different places. The upper part of this street is so very steep, that vehicles of any sort seldom pass this way.\n\nIt is principally occupied by cheese-mongers and flax-dressers. The Side leads to the Sandhill and Quay, where you set out.\n\nNear the foot of the Quay is a narrow street, called Broad Chare: this leads you to a small street, called Cowgate, thro' which is Stockbridge, a small area inclosed with houses, remarkable for having been once the residence of King John. At the further end\n\na steep hill with houses on one side, called Pandon Bank, ascending which, and keeping to the left, you reach Pleasant Row and Shield Field, two ranges of very good houses in an airy and elevated situation, a little out of town. SAND GATE. This street is at the lower end of the Quay, and is principally inhabited by that useful class of men 16 who are employed in conveying coals in keels from the staiths to the ships, whence they are called keelmen. In this street there is a considerable daily market for milk, and on Saturdays one for old cloaths. The road to North Shields lies through this street. NEW EGYPT. During the late scarcities, when vast quantities of corn were brought to Newcastle, the importers, not being able to procure warehouses, set about erecting large granaries, chiefly formed of wood, on the Shields road, adjoining Sandgate: from their number, and the immense quantities of corn stored in them, the people of Sandgate called them New Egypt, which name they still retain. A little further along is St. Ann's Chapel, a chapel of ease belonging to All Saints' Parish. A pleasant range of houses, called ST. ANN'S ROW. Is in a direction due east from the chapel, and passing downwards you come to a little rivulet called Ouse-burn, over which is a stone bridge of one arch. Here are many manufactories which shall be mentioned under their proper heads. PUBLIC MARKETS. 17 MARKETS FOR BUTCHER MEAT. ONE is held on the north side of St. Nicholas' Church in a street named Flesh Market, already described. This market is considered as not inferior to any in the north of England. There is another in the Butcher Bank, which is held every day.\n\nIn Sandgate there is a market on Mondays for the sale of meat which is not disposed of on Saturdays in the Flesh Market : this is principally bought by the poorer class of people, and sometimes for shipping.\n\nFrauds having been practised by weighing meat with steelyards, the magistrates ordered scales with stamped weights to be used. Meat found by the market inspectors to be putrid, or otherwise in an improper state for use, is seized and publicly burnt. POULTRY MARKET. The market for poultry is held in the High Bridge on Saturdays, and is generally well supplied. In the same market fresh butter is also sold; the pound of the latter ought to weigh 20 oz. at least. RABBIT MARKET. During the season considerable quantities of rabbits are brought to Newcastle as far as from Holy Island and other warrens. The markets for them are in the High Bridge and Sandhill. FISH MARKET. This market is on the Sandhill, and is very well supplied with white fish. It is frequently brought here in the spring and early part of the summer from the Yorkshire coast in large boats, navigated by five men, thence denominated five men boats. But the regular supply is from the fishing towns on the coasts of Durham and Northumberland. Oysters are brought here in their season, that is, (according to vulgar opinion,) in all those months that have the letter R in their name, as September, October, &c. The oysters with which Newcastle market is supplied are principally from the Frith of Forth.\n\nAs to salmon, which was formerly the boast of this town, there is a very small quantity of it now caught in the Tyne, compared with former years. The fisheries are still numerous, and the fish yet much esteemed, but from the increase of craft which are continually moving on the river, as well as the pernicious effects of the copperas, lead, and other 'manufactories, established on its banks, the supply is very trifling. The fish so much extolled in London as Newcastle Salmon is principally from the Tweed or the Tay. Brand tells us, Salmon was once so plentiful in Newcastle, that servants made generally an agreement with their masters not to have it more frequently than twice a week. GREEN MARKET. The market for vegetables is a daily one, held on the Sandhill, and is well supplied from the neighbourhood around. 19 Besides this market, vegetables are exposed daily for sale at High Bridge end, and in Denton Chare. CORN MARKETS. The markets for wheat, rye, and barley, in Pilgrim Street, and for oats in Bigg Market, are held on Saturdays and Tuesdays, and are plentifully supplied with grain. The supply has indeed increased, so much within a few years, that Newcastle corn market is said to be the greatest in the north of England. PUBLIC GROUNDS. FORTH. ON the west side of the town is a place called the Forth, a neat square plot of ground with a double row of trees on the sides, shading .a gravel walk. This place is appropriated to the use of the inhabit.. ants for purposes of recreation. LEAZES AND MOOR. The Leazes, formerly called the Castle Leazes, or Castle Moor, a tract of ground containing 141 acres of rich land, was the gift of King John to the Mayor and Burgesses of Newcastle, and confirmed to them in the reign of King Edward III. Adjoining the Leazes is the Town Moor, the most extensive piece of ground belonging to the corporation: it contains 1037 acres, and was at one period covered with large oak trees. A free burgess or his widow has the privilege of stinting two mulch cows on the Castle Leazes and Town Moor. RACE COURSE. This was formed by the corporation in the year 1756, on the Town Moor, about a mile from town by the north road. It is two miles in circumference, and is kept in very good order. In one part of it there is a hill, which affords spectators an excellent view of the course. Near this there is an elegant stand built of stone, and as there are generally several others of wood erected, this is by way of pre-eminence called the Grand Stand. The Races are held annually about the end of June, and continue six days. THE CASTLE. This ancient building strikes strangers on their approach to Newcastle in every direction. It stands on an eminence, and was probably built with the design both of repelling the incursions of the Scots, and of keeping the inhabitants of the town in a state of subjection.\n\nThis fortress commanded the principal entrance from the south, and was encompassed with two walls, of great strength and height. In the exterior wall were four gates, the ground within which measured three acres and one rood.\n\n21 It is generally agreed upon by antiquarians that it was built in the reign of the Conqueror, under the immediate direction of his son Robert.\n\nIt was in this castle, in the great hail of the palace, that Baliol, King of Scotland, did homage to Edward I for the crown of his kingdom.\n\nThe mode of warfare being however completely changed by the invention of artillery, this hitherto almost impregnable fortress gradually lost its former consequence, and as a proof of its fallen greatness, this castle, often the temporary residence of kings, and for the defence of which the great barons Heron, Delaval, Clavering, Bolbeck, Bertram of Bothal, Ross, Gaugy, Clifford, and Dilstone, had each a house within its liberties, had so completely lost its pristine grandeur at the beginning of the sixteenth century that it was let to the incorporated company of taylors at the trifling annual rent of Â£1.\n\nFormerly, on the top of the hill, overlooking Tyne Bridge, there was a fort, connected with the castle, in the form of a crescent, hence called the Half-moon Battery. A few years ago a range of buildings was erected on its ruins, which from its singular situation has a striking appearance to the stranger entering the town from the south. THE MOOT HALL. This ancient building is probably coeval with the castle. It is a large structure, and is situated on the east side of the castle-yard. The name Moot or Moat is of Saxon derivation, and signifies an eminence, commonly in the open air.\n\n22 The original intention of the Moot Hall was to assemble the lords and barons of the northern districts upon any particular emergency in feudal times.\n\nThis edifice presents nothing to attract particular attention. It is used at the assizes, which are held annually, as a court of justice for the county of Northumberland. NEWGATE GAOL Is a strong building. The debtors' apartments are light and well aired, and their situation is rendered more easy and comfortable than in many other places of confinement. The late Sir Walter Blackett generously charged his estate with the expence of supplying Newgate with coals. This tends considerably to alleviate the dreariness of their situation. The philanthropist, Howard, approved much of its cleanliness, its good fires, and the humanity of its keeper but reprobated its confined situation, having no open area for the recreation of the prisoners. There is another prison in the Manor Clare, called the House of Correction. It is principally intended for the temporary confinement of disorderly persons. A few years ago a Penitentiary House was built, adjoining the Correction House, for the imprisoning those sentenced to solitary confinement. THE EXCHANGE AND TOWN COURT. This structure is situated on the south side of the Sandhill. Before it was erected, there was a small 23 house, which still remains at the east end, called Maison de Dieu, (a House of God) vulgarly called Mason Due. This religious structure was founded by Roger Thornton, one of the earliest and most munificent benefactors Newcastle ever had. He built it in the reign of King Henry IV., for a chaplain to pray for the soul of Agnes, his late wife; for those of his father and mother, both deceased for his own soul while alive, and also when he too should be numbered with the dead.\n\nThis was dedicated to the tutelary Saint, Katherine, and like most other religious institutions, was plundered by Henry VIII. By royal grant, it was vested in the family of Sir Richard Lumley, who, anno 1629, conveyed it to the Mayor and Burgesses of Newcastle. The Maison de Dieu is now converted into warehouses. A part of it, fronting the Sand-hill, was some years ago taken down and rebuilt. It consists of a row of piazzas, where the salmon and rabbit markets are generally held. Adjoining the Maison de Dieu is the Merchants' Court, or Hall, described afterwards.\n\nThe Exchange likewise owes its origin to the public spirited Roger Thornton. But the building reared under his auspices and patronage was pulled down, and another more large and commodious for business was erected in its place in 1658, towards which Alderman Weymouth, by will, bequeathed Â£1200. Stimulated by this liberality, the town was at the rest of the charge, which exceeded Â£10,000.\n\n24 This Halll is very neatly decorated. The floor is laid with chequered marble, and the ceiling adorned with various paintings. At the west end, which is elevated by a flight of steps, are the benches, where the magistrates sit as justices of the peace, and hold their quarter sessions, courts of conscience, courts of guild, and other meetings of the burgesses. It is also in this court where his majesty's judges of assize annually decide such causes as fall under the jurisdiction of the Town and County of Newcastle, which is distinct from that of Northumberland. Above the seats of the magistrates are the portraits of Charles II. and James II. At the other end of the hall is a handsome painting of his present majesty, presented to the town by Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. one of its representatives in parliament.\n\nOn the north side of this hall is the town chamber, where the mayor transacts the ordinary business of the town and when, also, the common council is held upon public days, the mayor, magistrates, and burgesses, assemble here. At the west end of this chamber is a small room where the ancient records and archives of the town are kept. Formerly the ascent to the hall was by two stair cases without the building, which met at a platform fronting the great entrance, over which was a steeple built, with a statue of Charles II. placed in a niche in the tower; but in the year 1794, this building becoming ruinous, from the steeple having shrunk, it underwent a complete alteration, chiefly in that part which looks towards 25 the Sandhill, and the whole of the front was entirely cased anew with stone. THE MANSION HOUSE. This building is in the street called the Close. It is built of brick, with a court before it. Its interior is neat and convenient, corresponding with the hospitality kept up by the mayor, who during the term he remains in office (one year) usually resides here. The Mansion House Was built in 1691, and cost the corporation Â£6000. The mayor is allowed a state coach, and a handsome barge, in which, attended by the magistrates, and a numerous party of gentlemen, he navigates the river Tyne, as far as the jurisdiction of the corporation extends, annually, on asscension day. The judges of assize, with their attendants, when on the circuit, are also entertained, during the time of their residence here, at the Mansion House. THE CUSTOM HOUSE Is a large brick building, about the center of the Quay, and contains several commodious apartments for transacting public business. Its regulations are highly creditable to the principal officers. THE POST OFFICE Is situated about the centre of Mosley Street, at the foot of the new market. The north mail arrives about nine o'clock in the morning, and proceeds south at ten o'clock. The south mail commonly arrives about one o'clock, and proceeds north in half an hour. 26 The letters are ready for delivery about an hour and a half after arrival.\n\nLetters for the south mail must be put into the Post Office before twenty minutes past nine o'clock in the morning, and for the north mail, before the south mail arrives. The office is open from seven o'clock in the morning, till nine in the evening. THE SCALE CROSS Is a stone building supported by six pillars, and surmounted by the figures of two lions couchant. It stands at the foot of the street called the Side, and got its name from the town scales having been formerly kept here, for the purpose of weighing all butter which was brought into town. It is now a Mar- ket for butter, eggs, milk, &c. WHITE CROSS. This Cross stands in Newgate Street, not far from Newgate. It is a low building with a small spire. This is also a market for milk, and one of the places where public proclamations are made. THE BRIDGE. Consisting of nine arches, was built in 1779, and cost Â£30,000. It was widened in 1800, and is three hundred feet long, and now twenty four feet broad.\n\nThe alteration it has undergone has made it not altogether a perfect piece of architecture; but upon the whole it has a pleasing appearance. ASSEMBLY ROOMS. 27 In 1773 the subscription, for building these rooms was opened, to which the corporation contributed Â£200.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid by William Lowes, Esq. and under it a plate, with the following inscription, was deposited: In an age,\n\nWhen the polite arts,\n\nBy general encouragement and emulation,\n\nHave advanced to a state of perfection\n\nUnknown in any former period;\n\nThe first stone of this edifice,\n\nDedicated to the most elegant recreation,\n\nWas laid by William Lowes, Esq.\n\nOn the 16th of May, 1774. It is built from a plan of the late Mr William Newton, architect, and cost, when completed, Â£6701. The front is adorned with a colonnade of six pillars, and two handsome wings. The great room is very handsome, and has been generally considered as ranking next to that at Bath.\n\nThis room is ninety four feet long, thirty six feet broad, and thirty eight feet high. Besides the great room there is a lesser assembly room, a card room, and a subscription coffee room, where the daily prints and periodical publications are taken in for the use of the subscribers.\n\nTHEATRE ROYAL. 28 The Theatre is situated in Mosley Street, and is a modern structure. It is the property of subscribers, and at present is let to Mr Stephen Kemble. In the interior it is neat, and is very well adapted to its purpose.\n\nIt is open about three months in winter, and generally in summer at the races and assizes. CHURCHES AND CHAPELS, &c. IN our introductory remarks we observed that from the numbers of religious who repaired to this place, it got the name of Monkchester. We shall slightly notice the remains of some of its convents and priories. THE MONASTERY OF THE BLACK FRIARS. The remains of this ancient building stands adjacent to a street, which, from its vicinity to the monastery, is still called Low Friar Street, or Chare.\n\nIt was founded by Peter Scot, who was the first Mayor of Newcastle, in the year 1251, and by Sir Nicholas Scott, his son, who was one of the four bailiffs of the town.\n\nIt was suppressed by Henry VIII along with the other monasteries, and the prior and brethren were turned out. Henry made a grant of it to the town of Newcastle, in consideration of their paying Â£53. 7s. 6d. Together with the house, chapel, and other conveniences, there were two gardens, a field within the West-gate, another field of three acres, and a house called the Gate-house. ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL. 29 This religious foundation is in West-gate-street. It is supposed to have been founded during the reign of Henry II. Originally, it consisted of a hospital and a chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It owed its existence to a gentleman of the name of Aselack, of Killingworth, who gave, by charter, the ground on which it was built, with other endowments for the maintenance of two friars regular, and a chaplain, to serve God and the poor. Here, also, the wandering pilgrims found refreshment and repose. The inhabitants of Newcastle made an addition to the Hospital of our Lady, for supporting a master and a chaplain, to say divine service to six bede-folk in the almshouse, for lodging poor and way-faring people, and for burying those who happened to die there; and, in order to fence them against the rigours of winter, nine chaldrons of coals were distributed among them. It was abolished by Henry VIII.\n\nHowever, this did not prevent its utility, as it was converted into a Royal Grammar School, by Queen Elizabeth, and has long been a nursery for science and useful knowledge. THE GREY FRIARS, OR MINORS; CALLED\n\nALSO FRANCISCAN FRIARS. 30 It was adjoining to the High Friar Chare, that the House of Grey Friars, or Franciscans, formerly stood.\n\nThey had their first establishment in Newcastle, under the patronage of the opulent family of the Carliols, who were wealthy merchants, in the reign of Henry III.\n\nThis monastery was dissolved in 1539. It then consisted of John Crayforth, its prior, eight friars, and two novices. It was quite destitute of the luxuries found in most of the other convents; and so, they deservedly had the appellation of Friar Mendicants. ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL Was situated in Newgate Street. There are still some vestiges of it remaining near what is now called the Nungate.\n\nThe historian, Speed, informs us, that it was Henry I. who founded this hospital, for the nuns of Newcastle; others affirm that it was David, king of Scotland, when he resided in Newcastle, anno 1135.\n\nWe are likewise told that Agas, the mother of Margaret, Queen of Scotland, and Christian her sister, after king Malcolm was killed at Alnwick, anno 1086, incapable of enjoying society after that fatal catastrophe, retired here, and took the sacred veil.\n\nConsiderable donations and grants were made to this receptacle of fair devotees. The Nuns-moor, or Leases, was the property of these sisters, which, after passing through several hands, was at last vested by the Abbess in the Corporation of Newcastle, with whom it still remains. It was suppressed by Henry VIII. ST. MARY MAGDALEN'S HOSPITAL. 31 This hospital, or priory, was instituted to afford an asylum to persons afflicted with leprosy, and consisted of a master, brethren, and sisters. It was situated near the Barras Bridge, upon a rising ground. The term of Barras, now used, is only a perversion of the real name Barrows, which signifies tumuli, or hillocks, probably the burying places of the patients who died in the hospital. With the non-existence of the disease itself every vestige of this humane institution has been swept away by the hand of time. It was dissolved by Henry VIII. and incorporated with St. Thomas'. THE MONASTERY OF ST. AUGUSTINE, OR\n\nAUSTIN FRIARS. This was accounted one of the most handsome religious structures of the monastic order in Newcastle. It was situated on the left in going down the Manor Chare, on the ground on which the Freeman's Hospital, Surgeon's Hall, &c. have been built. It was founded (says Wallis) by Lord William Ros, baron of Wark, about the year 1290. Not many years ago, this fabric was levelled with the ground, after it had been suppressed with other monasteries.\n\nOut-of the ruins of this monastery have been erected, at the charge of the Corporation, into whose possession 32 it fell after the dissolution of the order, a workhouse, for the employment of the poor; a house of correction ; a penitentiary house ; a charity school for the indigent children of All Saints' Parish ; and a dwelling house for the master. PRIORY OF ST. MICHAEL DE WALL KNOLL. Upon the arrival of the Carmelites in Monkchester, afterwards Newcastle, they had a situation granted them upon Wall Knoll, where they founded a monastry ; but in process of time it being found inadequate to the accommodation of their increased numbers, they removed to another at White Friar Tower.\n\nThe founder of this house in Newcastle was William de Acton, a burgess and citizen. The house was dedicated to St. Michael, and the place where it stood was called St. Michael's Mount.\n\nIt was dissolved by Henry VIII. and its lands vested in the Corporation of Newcastle, in whose possession they still remain. ST. MARY'S CHAPEL AT JESMOND. This ancient chapel, now in ruins, gives the name to the place called Jesmond, from Jesus Mount, or Mount of Jesus. There yet remains, one of the small windows of the hospital in the west gable of a public house there. The chapel had an aisle northward, which is now a stable; it is itself become a barn. In the 3d. Edward VI. the town of Newcastle got a grant of the chapel of the blessed Virgin Mary of 33 Jesmond, and some messuages and lands in Jesmond, at the annual rent of 3s. 4d. In the same year, the Mayor and Burgesses granted the hospital of the blessed Virgin Mary of Jesmond, with the lands belonging to it, to Sir John Brandling, his heirs, and assigns, for ever. It is now in the possession of Mrs Coulson of Jesmond. It was to visit this famous chapel that pilgrims flocked from all quarters, and who, in their way thither, lodging in Pilgrim Street, were the cause of its receiving that appellation. ST. NICHOLAS' CHURCH. This noble structure is justly admired by strangers for its beautiful spire, and which, from whatever quarter you approach the town, is a striking object.\n\nWho the founder of it was, is not distinctly handed down. Some ascribe its existence to Henry I. and others to Osmond, bishop of Salisbury, anno 1091. King Henry I. made over the church of Newcastle, with that of Newburn, to the bishop of Carlisle, who is still the impropriator and patron. The other three churches, although they are termed three distinct parishes, are dependant on St. Nicholas' Church, the vicar receiving dues from them also. In the year 1194, in the reign of king Stephen, Hugh Pudsey, bishop of Durham, assigned to the minister of St. Nicholas' Church all the fruits, annual profits, oblations, and observations, belonging to that church, except the great tythes. The situation of this church is very advantageous, being elevated and almost in the centre of the town. 34 Its length is eighty yards, and its steeple sixty four yards high. From the square tower, or main body of the steeple, there are two bold stone arches, supporting a large and beautiful one, on which rises a lofty spire. The interior has within a few years been fitted up anew, in the manner of a cathedral, and is extremely neat. There are a few very handsome monuments placed in it. ST. THOMAS' CHAPEL. Is situated at the Bridge-end, and is a chapel of ease to St. Nicholas. It is dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, or St. Thomas the martyr. It has nothing striking in its structure or ornaments. Here public duty is performed on Sundays, and prayers are read on certain days in the week. SOUTH GOSFORTH CHAPEL. About two miles north from Newcastle, is also a chapel of ease to St. Nicholas. It is spoken of at so remote a period as that of Henry II. It has lately been rebuilt, and is a very neat structure. NORTH GOSFORTH CHAPEL. Is in ruins, and little remains but a few grave stones inscribed with names in the chapel yard. It is near the last mentioned. CRAMLINGTON CHURCH. It lies about eight miles nearly north from Newcastle, and is dedicated, like the mother church, to St. Nicholas. 35 It is a perpetual curacy. The patrons are, by turns, Sir Matthew White Ridley, Baronet, and William Lawson, Esquire ALL SAINTS' CHURCH. This beautiful church stands at the foot of Pilgrim Street. It is of a circular form, and is built of hewn stone. The front is toward the south, and has a handsome colonnade of five columns of the Ionic order, supporting a fine portico. A lofty spire rises above the front, which contains a clock, and a good set of bells.\n\nIt is considered a chief ornament among the modern improvements in Newcastle. It was built under the direction of Mr Stephenson, architect, was consecrated anno 1789, and cost the parish Â£27,000.\n\nThe old church stood a little eastward of the present one. Its ruinous state occasioned its being taken down. ST. JOHN'S CHURCH. This old church stands about the middle of West-gate-street. It is a plain building with a square tower, and is very neatly fitted up within.\n\nThe celebrated Cunningham, the pastoral poet, was interred in this church-yard. On his monument is the following inscription: 36\n\nHere lie the remains of John Cuningham.\n\nOf his excellence,\n\nAs a pastoral poet,\n\nHis works will remain a monument\n\nfor ages,\n\nAfter this temporary tribute of esteem\n\nis in the dust forgotten.\n\nHe died September 18, 1773, aged 44.\n\nHe culled the essence of simplicity,\n\nand arranged it in pastoral verse.\n\nST. ANDREW'S CHURCH Is situated near Newgate, on the west side of the street. The style of the architecture seems to indicate that it is of great antiquity. This church had three chantries founded in it, in honour of St. Mary the Blessed Virgin, the Holy Trinity, and St. Thomas. ST. JAMES' CHAPEL Formerly stood on the north side of the Barrasbridge. It has been long in ruins. ST. MARY'S CHAPEL, AT JESMOND. Mentioned before, formerly was a chapel of ease to St. Andrew's parish, but, like the former, has also been long in a ruined state. THE DISSENTING MEETING HOUSES In Newcastle are numerous. There is a handsome chapel of the calvinistic baptist persuasion on the Toothill Stairs, near the Close. It is a neat modern building of brick. 37 Hanover Square Meeting House is also a neat building for unitarian dissenters. The vestry contains a good collection of books for the use of the congregation.\n\nAdjoining the Castle, at the end of Bailiff-gate, is a presbyterian Meeting House. In the Postern are two Meeting Houses; one tolerably handsome, the minister of which is of Lady Huntingdon's sect; the other, called the old Postern Meeting, is for a part of the seceding congregation, separated from another of the same persuasion in the Close.\n\nThe Groat Market, High Bridge, Silver Street, Wall Knoll, and Sally Port, have also each a presbyterian Meeting House. Near the opening of the Town Wall, below the Carpenter Tower, is a small Meeting House of the followers of Mr Glass.\n\nThere are three methodist chapels; one in Northumberland Street, one in Manor Clare, and another on the New Road, opposite to New Egypt.\n\nIn Pilgrim Street, nearly opposite to Mosley Street, is a Meeting House for quakers.\n\nThere are two Roman Catholic Chapels; one is in Pilgrim Street, opposite the High Bridge; the other is at the foot of West-gate-street.\n\nIn the whole there are six congregations of presbyterians, properly so called, united in doctrine, discipline and communion with the church of Scotland, one of burghers, and two of antiburghers seceding from that church, a respectable body of unitarians, a congregation of independents, another of calvinist baptists, two called killianities, two Romish chapels, a respectable body of quakers, and a small body of glassites. 38 All these live together very peaceably, and while they respectively enjoy liberty of conscience themselves, they do not endeavour to disturb that of their christian neighbours. BALLAST HILLS BURYING GROUNDS. Dissenters, especially such as have come from Scotland, account the permission to bury their dead, in a manner they consider the most proper, a very particular privilege. This burying ground is at the Ballast Hills, near to the Glasshouses. Here by far the greatest part of the dissenters bury their dead, as also many of the poor of the established church. It is probable that there being no expense for service incurred, is the reason of their so doing. It is one of the largest pieces of ground devoted to this melancholy purpose perhaps to be met with, Bunhill fields burying ground in London alone excepted. There are from twelve to eighteen, and sometimes even double that number of corpses interred here weekly.\n\nThe expense of interment is only 1s. or 1s. 6d. at most, for the grave ; and an exact register is kept. The corporation receives 8d. and the sexton the overplus. PUBLIC CHARITIES. CHARITY SCHOOL OF ST. NICHOLAS. THE well endowed charity school of St. Nicholas owes its existence to the pious benevolence of a worthy lady, Mrs Eleanor Allan, of Newcastle, who founded it in 1705. To support this charity, Mrs Allan assigned a farm at Wall's End, of the yearly value of Â£61 to the trustees, for setting up a school for teaching forty boys and twenty girls, in this parish, or in the chapelry of St. John's. The boys are taught reading, writing, and accounts, and afterwards are put to some trade; and have each Â£2 given them for that purpose, with a bible and prayer book, the Whole Duty of Man, and Lewis's Explanation of the Catechism.\n\nThe girls are taught to read, write, sew, and knit, and then are apprenticed out, or put to service ; and have, also each 20s. allowed them, with the same books as the boys. The master's salary is Â£25 per annum, and 20s. for coals. That of the mistress for the girls is Â£10 per annum, and 10s. for coals. The parishioners were so well satisfied with the diligence of the teachers and the progress of the scholars, that they entered into an annual subscription to clothe the children of the school; and numerous liberal accessions have been made to the revenues of their institution. ST. JOHN'S CHARITY SCHOOL. 40 Dr. Tomlinson informs us that the founder of this charity school was Mr John Ord, but who had bound him by promise not to disclose the secret till after his, (Mr Ord's) decease, which the doctor sacredly observed. The institution is for forty four boys, to support which Mr Ord bequeathed a large field, without Pilgrim Street Gate.\n\nMrs Allgood bequeathed Â£100 in 1707, to be put out at interest, for the benefit of St. John's Charity School; and an annual subscription of Â£33 is also raised for its maintenance. A charity sermon is also preached annually for the same benevolent purpose. The boys are new clothed once, and have shoes and stockings twice a year. The school-house was built and is kept in repair by the corporation. The master's salary is Â£25 per annum, Â£2 for teaching the boys church music, and 16s. a year for paper, pens, and ink.\n\nAmong other donations, sixteen of the companies of the burgesses give annually Â£1 each. CHARITY SCHOOL OF ST. ANDREWS. Sir Walter Blackett, Bart. was the founder of this school. It is for thirty boys, and was first opened in 1708. In 1719, Sir Wm. Blackett, Bart. son of the founder, completed the institution, by bequeathing a sum for clothing the boys. The master's salary is Â£20 the patrons are the vicar, and the church wardens of the parish.\n\n41 In 1792 a commodious airy school house was built for girls, by subscription, without Newgate, and a gallery was at the same time erected for them in the south porch of the church. They are taught all the useful branches of female education. CHARITY SCHOOL OF ALL SAINTS This valuable foundation was raised by a voluntary subscription in 1709. It is for forty one boys and seventeen girls. The scholars of both sexes are taught the most useful branches of education.\n\nThe subscribers are very numerous, and many of the donations liberal. CHARITY SCHOOL OF ST. ANN'S CHAPEL. The school room is situated at the east end of Sandgate, near the Chapel, where is also a house for the master. SUNDAY SCHOOLS Have been opened by the four parishes of this town, in which a great number of children are instructed in reading. Besides these there are several others, which have been instituted by the dissenting congregations. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. THE ROYAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL. THIS school, which has long ranked among the first places for founding youth in classical learning, was at first situated on the north east side of St. Nicholas' Church. 42 Queen Elizabeth constituted it a royal foundation by charter ; in consequence of which it was removed to the capacious hospital of St. Mary, after it had been stripped of its religious revenues by her royal father, Henry VIII.\n\nShe enacted that the foundation be styled The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth, the master and scholars whereof are to become a body corporate in law, with perpetual succession. To have a common seal, and a legal capacity of purchasing and holding lands to themselves and successors in fee simple, or for a term of years, provided they exceeded not the sum of Â£40. The Mayor and six Aldermen are appointed the patrons of this school, with the power of electing a master and usher, whose offices are held at their pleasure, and on every vacancy, or removal by death, are to be filled up by them.\n\nTo cherish this excellent institution, Lord Crewe left a legacy for scholars taught in Newcastle grammar school, to enable them to be sent to any of the universities of England.\n\nDr. Smith also bequeathed the interest of Â£800 to Emanuel College, in Cambridge; half of which is for the maintenance of a scholar either from Durham or Newcastle grammar school. Other legacies have been left for the same purpose.\n\nThe learned bishop Ridley, the martyr, Dr. Akenside, Lord Eldon, Sir Wm. Scott, and several other distinguished characters, received the first principles of their education at this school.\n\nThere are several schools for boys and girls, and some highly respectable boarding schools for young ladies in this town. 43 LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. This society, held in a spacious room in the Groat Market, is composed of the following classes, viz. 1. Ordinary members, who subscribe Â£1. 1s. annually. 2. Honorary members, who reside at a distance, and correspond with the society, of whom no subscription is required. 3. Honorary members with the privileges of ordinary ones. Only four of this description are allowed at one time. The intention of the society in instituting this last class was for the laudable purpose of encouraging the exertions of deserving persons, whose circumstances render it inconvenient to incur the expense of the ordinary contribution. 4. A fourth class was added to the former, anno 1799, under the denomination of reading members, who do not attend the meetings of the society, but have the use of the library. Ladies only are admissible into this last class. Their annual subscription is the same with that of ordinary members.\n\nThe society is governed by a president, four vice presidents, two secretaries, and a committee of eight; all annually chosen out of the class of ordinary members. To these are intrusted the expenditure of the funds; the ordering and purchasing books of the library ; and the domestic economy of the institution. 44 The general meetings of the society are held on the evening of the first Tuesday of every month. The subjects for their investigation comprehend mathematics, natural philosophy, history, chemistry, polite literature, antiquities, biography, questions of general law and polity, commerce and the arts. Questions and discussions on religion, and the politics of the day, are strictly prohibited by an express law. THE LIBRARY. A large and valuable library, consisting of a great number of the choicest books is already collected, and is constantly increasing in number and value, from the ample funds applied to the purchase of books, as well as from numerous donations, by opulent members and authors.\n\nThe librarian attends every day, (Sundays excepted) from ten o'clock in the morning till nine in the evening, during which time books may be either read in the room or taken out to read. In an adjacent room, adapted for the reception of curiosities, pieces of antiquity, a very considerable collection of minerals, plants, and other curiosities of nature and art, from different quarters of the globe, are already deposited. INSTITUTION FOR PUBLIC LECTURES ON\n\nNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. This was established in 1802, and four courses have already been delivered by the Rev. Wm. Turner, who is appointed lecturer to this institution. 45 They have been delivered in the room of the Literary Society, and illustrated by the extensive apparatus of the late Dr. Garnett, which was purchased of his executors for the use of the institution. The annual subscription to the lectures is Â£2. 2s. except to members of the Literary Society and ladies, who only pay Â£1. 2s. Tickets for life are Â£10. 10s. to members of the Literary Society, and Â£21. to those who are not. Corporate bodies, making donations, may have transferable tickets, in proportion to their donations. ST. NICHOLAS' LIBRARY. The Rev. Dr Tomlinson, rector of Whickham, near this Town, left by will a very valuable collection of books. This was bequeathed with the laudable design of diffusing knowledge amongst the inhabitants of Newcastle. That the bequest might not be misapplied, a librarian was appointed, with a fixed salary of Â£25 per annum. A rent charge of Â£5 yearly, was also purchased by the worthy divine, for the purpose of increasing this valuable collection, with the most useful works. Besides these, there are the books of an old library, the donation of a few others, kept in a separate room. As the old room where the books were first deposited, was dark, damp, and injurious to these valuable works, Sir Walter Blackett, at his own expense, erected a handsome building to contain the books, adjoining to the south wall of St. Nicholas' Church. It is built of fine hewn stone, neatly ornamented, and is very convenient for the purpose. The under part is used for the vestry, and above is the library. LIBRARIES. 46 We have already mentioned, in describing the New Assembly Rooms, that it contains a subscription news room; here, besides the public journals, a considerable number of books, principally illustrative of public transactions and events, are purchased and preserved, and will probably one day form a very valuable collection of the most popular productions, upon the various and interesting topics of discussion, which from time to time have agitated the public mind.\n\nThe use of these is confined to the subscribers to the Assembly Rooms, and strangers introduced by them.\n\nIn the Bigg Market is a Circulating Library, the property of Mr Sands. It forms one of the best collections of books, in every branch of science and literature, out of the metropolis. CHARITABLE IN STITUTIONS. THE Manors, formerly the site of the monastery of Austin Friars, contains now several charitable foundations, particularly JESUS' HOSPITAL, 47 Now called Freemen's Hospital In 1683, it was incorporated by the name of the Master, Brethren, and Sisters, of the Hospital of the Holy Jesus, founded in the Manors, in the Town and County of Newcastle upon Tyne, at the charges of the Mayor and Burgesses of that town, for the support, for ever, of poor, impotent people, being Freemen and Freemen's widows, or their sons and daughters, that had never been married.\n\nThe Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of Newcastle, for the time being, were appointed visitors, and to give rules and laws to this Hospital.\n\nThe benefactions for its support are liberal and ample. MRS DAVISON'S HOSPITAL. This humane institution was for a governess, and five sisters, to be widows of protestant clergymen, merchants, and freemen of Newcastle, endowed by the charity of Mrs Ann Davison, widow of Mr Benjamin Davison, merchant. It was built by the Corporation near the former one, in 1725. SIR WALTER BLACKETT'S HOSPITAL Was instituted for six unmarried men, poor and decayed burgesses of Newcastle, anno 1754. The worthy Bart. on the receipts of a bond given him by the Corporation, deposited Â£1200 for that purpose. MR DAVISON'S HOSPITAL. Thomas Davison, Esq. of Ferry-Hill, in the county of Durham, and his sisters, founded this hospital for six unmarried women, under the same roof with those intended for the two former hospitals of Mrs Ann Davison, and Sir Walter Blackett, Bart. THE TRINITY HOUSE CHARITY ROOMS. 48 The Freemen of the Trinity House of this town, erected, in 1724, apartments for twelve widows of poor brethren. Each is allowed 12s. per month, a gown and petticoat every two years, and coals. They have also medical advice, when necessary.\n\nThe Trinity House also provides habitations for eight poor brethren, and allows them support in like manner. It also supports some in their own houses. KEELMEN'S HOSPITAL. This hospital, for the accommodation of keelmen and their widows, is situated on an eminence a little east-ward of the Carpenter's Tower, on the Garth-heads, behind Sandgate. It is a square building, and contains about 52 chambers for the accommodation of aged members of both sexes.\n\nThe room in the south front, is large and capacious, for the purpose of general meetings.\n\nOn their general annual meeting day the keelmen walk in procession through the principal streets of the town, in decent plain dresses, attended with music, playing their favorite air of \" Weel may the Keel row:'\n\nThis Hospital was built by each keelman paying one penny a tide. It is probably the only one in the kingdom built by the poor for the support of themselves.\n\n49 A few keelmen, with a laudable perseverance, set about drawing up a scheme for a permanent resource for the wants and necessities of their members. This scheme obtaining the approbation of the magistrates, and the coal owners, an application was made to Parliament, and an act obtained, sanctioning this scheme, with some judicious improvements. The bye-laws, which are subjoined to the act, display so much wisdom and humanity, that the resources for the sick and infirm of this body promise to be of long duration.\n\nBy these laws, weekly allowances to sick or superanuated members are as follow, viz.:\n\nSuperanuated members, unable to work at the keels, are allowed to follow any other employment; but if they can hereby earn at the rate of 4s. or upwards, per week, their allowance from the fund is then reduced according to the following table: 50 The late Alderman Simpson, of Newcastle, gave Â£100. to this hospital. This act of generosity is gratefully acknowledged in an inscription on the south front of the hospital. BENEFIT SOCIETIES. In the societies of this kind in Newcastle, a sick or disabled member is generally allowed 6s. and some 7s. per week, during a certain time, after which the allowance is reduced to one half of that sum, till the member, by a lingering disorder, or disability to work, has exhausted all his sick money. He then becomes a pensioner for life, and commonly receives 2s. 6d. or 3s. per week. The funeral expenses are about 40s. or 50s. or at most Â£3. The legacy to the widows, is from Â£61, to Â£10. By this, along with the parish allowance (commonly to each child) an industrious widow is enabled to begin in some small way of dealing, and so provide for her fatherless family.\n\nThere are between thirty and forty of these societies of men in this town, which together, consist not of less than five thousand members. It is supposed there are nearly the same number of benefit societies of women, and probably about two thousand members in all.\n\nThese all being provided for against sickness and want, at their own charge, are undoubtedly a great relief to the respective parishes, where they reside.\n\nFUND FOR THE WIDOWS OF\n\nPROTESTANT DISSENTING MINISTERS. 51 This Fund was to have consisted of forty members residing in the Counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and the Towns of Newcastle upon Tyne, and Berwick upon Tweed.\n\nThe terms of admission were, for the first class, the minister to pay Â£2 and his congregation Â£2 more ; for the second class Â£3; and for the third Â£2 annually. The widows of the first class to receive Â£20 annually; of the second, Â£15; of the third, Â£12 annually. They have about twenty widows on the books, who are regularly paid their annuities, by two half-yearly payments. They have been associated above forty years, and their present capital is about Â£5000. This association used to have their annual meetings at Newcastle. They now hold them alternately, at Newcastle, Morpeth, and Alnwick.\n\nFor many years they received from the Regiurn Donum in London, Â£40 annually, which greatly assisted their fund; but the distribution of the royal bounty falling into other hands, this association was deprived of any further donation from the fund.\n\nThis has occasioned them to make several material alterations in their original statutes and regulations.\n\nDissenting ministers of every profession are admisible, without any discrimination in religious opinions, or mode of church government. Harmony and social friendship reign at their annual meetings, in a friendly, exemplary manner. 52 Their clerk, treasurer, and trustees, receive no remuneration for their services, cheerfully offering them for the general good.\n\nThe late Dr. Henry of Berwick, afterwards of Edinburgh, drew up a well digested scheme of statutes and regulations, which they still carefully observe in the application of the rates and collections annually made by the respective ministers of their congregations SCHOOL-MASTERS' ASSOCIATION. Mr Brand, in his History of Newcastle, vol. 2, p. 547, says, \" November 19, 1774, was held, at Newcastle upon Tyne, the first meeting of the Association of School-masters in the north of England. The object of the society in this institution, was the relief of their distressed and aged brethren, and their widows, and orphans.\" He adds in a note, see a pamphlet entitled \" An Address to the Public in behalf of the Association among Protestant School-masters,\" &c. These regulations are upon a more extensive scale than those of the other benefit societies of Newcastle, as they do not limit their charity to one single donation, called a legacy, but they settle upon the widows of a deceased brother, Â£10, Â£12, or Â£15 per annum ; and as their fund accumulates it is expected that widows of the first class will have an annuity of Â£20.\n\nHis Grace the Duke of Northumberland thought so well of the School-masters' Association, that he became its patron and the Rev. Mr Farrer, president. To the credit of this latter gentleman, it deserves to be mentioned, that to his abilities, and uniform attention to the interests, of this institution, it is greatly indebted for its present flourishing state. By Mr Farrer's exertions Lord Lonsdale, and many other respectable gentlemen have subscribed annual donations. THE INFIRMARY. 53 For the Counties of Newcastle, Durham, and Northumberland. In describing the Newcastle Infirmary, we shall give a slight view of it in its original state ; with a more general delineation of the admirable improvements which have recently been made.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1751, the members of a respectable club in Newcastle, resolved, on account of the death of some, and the advancing age of others of their body, to discontinue their stated meetings but, previous to their so doing, to leave some permanent memorial of the society having existed, by the proposal of some project of public utility. On the day appointed for this benevolent purpose, a late eminent surgeon, Mr Richard Lambert, then a young man, suggested the establishment of an Infirmary ; and this appearing more beneficial than any other project which had been presented, met with the unanimous concurrence of the meeting. In conequence, a letter was inserted in the Newcastle papers, strongly recommending a subscription for effecting so desirable an object. A subscription was accordingly opened on the 9th of February, 1751, and soon attracted the notice of the most distinguished characters.\n\n54 The Infirmary stands in an open, dry, elevated situation, at a short distance from the south-west of the town, and the river Tyne. The building is of stone, and presents a plain but elegant front to the south; from the eastern extremity, there runs northward a spacious wing, fronting the east, two stories high. The principal, or south front, contains four stories, viz. the basement, the ground floor, the chamber story, and the attic.\n\nThis old edifice, though beautiful in its exterior, had all the faults and defects of the old hospitals. Respecting the wards, some were too large, and all too much crowded. The galleries in the wing, which ought to have acted as ventilators, were shut up at one end, and thus contaminated the air of the whole house. One room only was provided for a single patient, and it was allotted for those alone who had undergone the operation of lithotomy. The bedsteads were constructed of wood, and consequently were prolific sources of vermin. The physicians and surgeons had no proper accommodations; there being neither waiting-hall for the patients, nor a room sufficiently large for a dispensary.\n\nTo remedy these evils, so injurious to the health and speedy recovery of the patients, it was resolved at a special court, held, August 4, 1801, \" That a plan for the extension of the Infirmary, should be carried into execution; and that the proposal of the committee, for remedying the defects of the old Infirmary, should also be adopted, and carried into effect, as soon as the new building should be completed, and made fit for the reception of patients.\n\nA subscription was accordingly opened, and the sums immediately subscribed amounted to Â£1600. His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, was one of the principal contributors, and expressed his high opinion of the utility of the Infirmary, and his wish that the proposed improvements might be carried into effect.\n\nOn the 23d of September, the foundation stone of the new building was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley, Bart. M.P. as representative, upon this occasion, of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland.\n\nIn the construction of the New Building, the first object of attention was free ventilation; and the second, not to deform the elegant appearance of the old Infirmary.\n\nThe new building is much higher than the old one. It is constructed of brick, to give it the appearance of a separate house. It has only one row of wards. Its galleries are in a direct line with the front galleries of the old Infirmary, by which a thorough ventilation of both is secured.\n\nThe old and new buildings, being now fitted up, are capable of accommodating, upon an emergency, one hundred and twenty-six patients. They contain in all sixteen wards, and fourteen rooms for single patients. 56\n\nThis noble institution is attended by four physicians, and four surgeons. Indigent persons, maimed by accident, are taken in at all hours, without previous recommendations.\n\nBy the late report, it appears, that thirty-four thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven patients have been cured, since its commencement, anno 1751. THE DISPENSARY. This valuable foundation is in Low Friar Street. It is adorned with a neat front, on which is inscribed the date of the commencement of the institution.\n\nThe objects of the Dispensary are such poor inhabitants as cannot receive proper relief from the Newcastle Infirmary, either on account of the nature of their diseases, or when unsafe for them to wait till the day of regular admission.\n\nFrom the commencement of the Dispensary in 1777, to the 31st of August, 1805, forty-five thousand eight hundred and ninety seven patients had been admitted, of whom forty-two thousand five hundred and eighty, labouring under various diseases, had been cured.\n\nFrom the commencement of the vaccine inoculation, or by the cow-pox, in the spring of 1801, to Michaelmas, 1805, twenty-five thousand and thirteen children had been inoculated, of whom twenty-five thousand and nine had the disease, and four did not take the infection.\n\n57 We shall close our account of the Newcastle Dispensary, by observing, that in the preservative department, the governors have displayed their philanthropy, in providing and placing in proper houses, the necessary instruments, and medicines, for restoring suspended animation. The faculty in Newcastle, Shields, Howdon Dock, Winlaton, Swalwell, and Newburn, are all medical assistants; and such plain directions have been published, that any active spectator may render essential assistance to a fellow-creature on the first emergency. INSTITUTION For the Cure and Prevention of Contagious Fever\n\nin Newcastle and Gateshead.\n\nThis benevolent institution, under the general title of the House of Recovery, was opened for the reception of patients, on the 9th of October, 1804 ; and the governors at the same time ordered the plan of the institution to be published and circulated.\n\nThe object of this charity is to remove into the House of Recovery the persons first attacked by fever, who live in crowded, ill-aired habitations ; and who are therefore liable to communicate the infection to a numerous family, or to their neighbours.\n\nWhen the attending physicians shall judge the removal of the patient from his habitation unnecessary, he is empowered to give an order for such articles of clothing as are indispensably necessary, on account of the poverty of the patient. And when the fever shall have ceased, the apartment is to be cleansed and washed, with quick lime; and the infected bedclothes, and apparel, purified or destroyed.\n\n58 The institution is attended by the physicians, surgeons, and apothecary of the Dispensary; from which the patients are also provided with medicine; but all other expenses are to be defrayed by the institution.\n\nThe House of Recovery is pleasantly situated without the Town Walls, a little north front West-gate, with a road of communication from the Dispensary to Low Friar Street.\n\nThe first subscription towards the building amounted to Â£1438 2s. and the annual subscriptions to Â£220 10s.\n\nThis institution is under the direction of a patron, a president, four vice presidents, a treasurer, a secretary, a committee of twenty-four, and the medical officers of the Dispensary.\n\nAn address to the public was circulated, by order of the general meeting, held at the Dispensary, October 9th, 1804; and we are happy to add, parochial aid has been promised by the parishes in Newcastle, and that of Gateshead. LYING-IN HOSPITAL. In Rosemary Lane, for poor Married Women. This benevolent institution was first opened in Rosemary Lane, October 1st, 1760. The hospital stands in a very retired situation, on the east side of West-gate-street. 59 Over the front door is this inscription ; \" Licensed for the public reception of pregnant woman, pursuant to an act of parliament passed in the 13th year of the reign of Geo. III.\"\n\nOn the inner side of the main door is an inscription over the charity box, \"Because there was no room for her in the Inn.\"\n\nThe establishment consists of a president, four vice presidents, a treasurer, a physician, a matron and midwife, a chaplain, a surgeon, and twelve midwives for out patients.\n\nThe rules of admission are, in general, similar to those of other charitable institutions. Women are to be recommended by subscribers, and must produce certificates of their marriage. If suddenly taken ill, the matron must attend them at their own habitations. The physician and surgeon are to deliver the women in difficult cases, instruct the midwives, and act in their respective capacities.\n\nThe matron must be a midwife, and deliver in ordinary cases. The number of women admitted, since the first opening to the present time, is considerably above two thousand patients.\n\nIn the year 1761, a similar charity was instituted for poor Lying-in Women at their own Houses, in Newcastle and Gateshead. They have the assistance of one of the midwives in ordinary cases, and, when considered necessary, two surgeons attend. During the month, they have proper support; as also some pecuniary gratuity to aid the family, while the mother is thus incapacitated. 60\n\nThe humanity and disinterestedness of the charities are obvious. It is however with regret we are informed, that owing to the death of several of the principal subscribers, and the increased price of every necessary of life the funds are in a languishing state. LUNATIC ASYLUMS. On the representations of some medical and other gentlemen of Newcastle, that a piece of ground was wanted for the site of an hospital, intended to be erected in or near that town, for lunatics belonging to the counties of Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle, the Corporation granted a lease of a piece of ground situated between Newgate and West-gate street, from October 7th, 1765, the date of the grant, for the term of ninety-nine years, at an annual rent of 2s. 6d.\n\nThis building is in a retired situation, surrounded with pleasant grounds, and has a very neat appearance. The conveniences are numerous, and the treatment of the unhappy patients humane, and suitable to their situation. This hospital is under the direction of Dr. Wood. Another, named Belgrove, upon a smaller scale, is built on the Leazes, and is under the management of Dr. Steavenson.\n\nA third erection, of the same kind, is built on the edge of Gateshead Borough-grounds, at Bensham, and is also under the direction of Dr. Wood. THE BATHS. 61 The public baths of this town, situated without West-gate, were constructed a few years ago by the late Dr. Hall, at whose decease they were purchased by Dr. Kentish. This gentleman has made many improvements, as well in respect to particular conveniences, as in the general appearance of the place. An apparatus has also been made for applying the gaseous fluids, in cases where their use has been found salutary. Dr. Kentish, leaving Newcastle, the baths became the property of Malin Sorsbie, Esq.\n\nThey consist of medicated vapour baths, tepid, and inclosed cold baths, and a large open bath for swiming in. CHARTERS AND PRIVILEGES OF\n\nNEWCASTLE. HAVING succinctly given an account of the antiquity, walls, fortifications, public buildings, and charitable institutions of Newcastle, we shall give a short view of its charters and privileges.\n\nIn 1162, Henry II confirmed, by charter, to the townsmen of Newcastle their estates, and exempted them from tolls and duties.\n\nKing John, of all the English Sovereigns, was the most munificent benefactor and patron of Newcastle. Here he frequently resided and held his court conventions of the nobles, and meetings of the estates of the realm, &c. This prince granted the most explicit charter to the people of Newcastle, anno 1212, the 14th year of his reign, confirming to the burgesses their rights and privileges conferred upon them, as well by his father, Henry II. as by himself. 62\n\nKing Henry III by his charter, made Newcastle a \"Mayor town\", being governed by four bailiffs; and to his other royal favours added a grant, during pleasure, of all the demesne lands belonging to the Castle-fields, containing eight hundred and fifty acres, for free pasture; with liberty to dig coals and stones, and to dispose of them, for their use, to the best advantage, upon payment of Â£1 into the exchequer. He also gave them a field called the Forth, containing eleven acres, and then valued at Â£12 per annum, for which they were to pay Â£2; with the further privilege of authority to prevent Jews residing among them, who it appears at this time had behaved ill in Northumberland.\n\nKing Edward I directed a writ of summons to Newcastle, anno 1282, to send two members to parliament, which is the earliest record we have of boroughs sending any, or indeed of the commons sitting as a branch of the legislature.\n\nKing Edward III confirmed the franchises of the town, and granted it the perpetuity of the Moor, and lands called Castle-moor, and Castle-fields, for the payment of Â£2 annually, into the exchequer.\n\nHe exempted Newcastle from the jurisdiction of the admiralty of England; gave permission to purchase lands to a certain value ; confirmed several bye-laws of the magistrates, for well governing and improving the town; and also issued an order for the manner of electing the mayor, magistrates, and other officers, and another concerning the measure to be used in vending coals. 63\n\nAnno 1378, being the first of his reign, Richard II. confirmed all the charters formerly granted to Newcastle. This prince also granted to the mayor and burgesses some pieces of ground, for the convenience of making high-ways, and a bridge. And, for the still greater honour of the town, Richard granted, anno 1390, that a sword, the ensign of royal state and authority, should be carried before the mayor.\n\nWe shall briefly observe, that from the reign of Richard II to the fifteenth century, the corporation and free burgesses of Newcastle were uniformly acquiring fresh accessions of privileges from the throne, while they were rapidly extending their commerce and improving their resources of wealth and opulence. Queen Elizabeth not only confirmed all the former royal grants and charters, but gave the corporation a new charter, which, properly speaking, laid the solid foundation of the municipal constitution, defining the jurisdiction of its magistrates and civil officers, the extent of their authority, and the privileges, as well as the limits of their privileges.\n\nIn 1684 the charter of this town was given up to Charles II. and a new one was granted by that prince; but reserving to himself the power of appointing whom he pleased in the magistracy. 64 He accordingly displaced the mayor, who had been constitutional- ly chosen by the corporation, and appointed Sir William Creach, a violent papist, in his room. A flattering address to the king was drawn up on this occasion, signed by himself, and other aldermen who were papists, approving of his majesty's wisdom in this new election; but when it was presented to the corporation at large, for their concurrence, a patriotic majority disdainfully refused to sacrifice the liberties of the town. CIVIL GOVERNMENT OF NEWCASTLE. THE supreme power is vested in the mayor, who is the chief magistrate; a sheriff, a recorder, a town-clerk, ten aldermen, and a common-council, composed of twenty-four burgesses.\n\nFor the administration of justice, there are the following courts, viz.: the Mayor's Court, Sheriff's Court, Court of Conscience, Admiralty Court, Court of Common-council, Ward-Moot; Pie Powder (or Pied Poudre) Court, and three Courts of Guild, annually.\n\nThe principal court is the mayor's. It is held every Monday, at the west end of the Guild-hall, over the Exchange. THE SHERIFF'S COURT. This is a court of record, held on Wednesdays, and Fridays, for trials, and entering proceedings; as rules, appearances, judgments, pleas, &c.\n\nThe defendant may, after the verdict is given, and before judgment is entered, stop judgment, by taking the cause before the mayor, for time to pay the money recovered against him. 65\n\nIn this court, may be tried actions of debt, trespasses, accompts, covenants, broken attachments, and sequestrations. If either party cannot stay in town till the day of trial, his testimony, in writing, will be allowed for good evidence. The sheriff, if he pleases, may sit upon all trials, along with the recorder, who is also judge here. THE COURT OF CONSCIENCE. This court was first instituted in Newcastle, by an act of parliament, anno 1689, in the I William and Mary, and confirmed by another act, anno 1755, being the 27th George II.\n\nIt is termed a court of conscience, because all debts under the sum of Â£2 may be here recovered upon the creditor making oath, that the same is a just and lawful debt. The mayor and recorder are the judges. They administer oaths, and commit offenders to prison.\n\nThey proceed first by summons. This costs 3d. If the defendant appear, there is no further charge. If he does not, they proceed to attachment and prosecution. All persons, whether freemen, or not, may present and be presented, in this court, if within the liberties of the town. Freemen may be presented, though they live out of its liberties. ADMIRALTY COURT. This court is held before the mayor, for the preservation of the river Tyne, at such times as he shall direct. 66 His deputy, the water bailiff, gives notice of all offences committed to the injury of the river, that offenders may be proceeded against according to law. THE COURT OF COMMON-COUNCIL. This court has some resemblance to the high senate of the nation. It consists of two houses; one is for the mayor and aldermen; the other is for the commoners. They make all bye-laws for the general benefit of the corporation. In this court also, all deeds and evidence are recorded. The mayor can call and adjourn it at pleasure. COURT OF PIE POWDER. The real name of this court is Pied Poudre. It is held at the time of the two great fairs of this town; one at Lammas, the latter on the festival of St. Luke, for examining and trying all suits brought for petty differences, and offences committed at that time; and to prevent which, due proclamation is made on the first day of each fair. COURT OF GUILD. This court is held three times in the year. The principal business is for apprentices, and sons of freemen, to petition for their freedom. These are called by the style of the company that their fathers or masters were of. This is what is termed \"calling their guilds.\" 67 The wardens and stewards of the several companies attend to prevent any person from obtaining his freedom who may not be entitled to it.\n\nAn apprentice is called three different guild days; the son of a freeman only once.\n\nTHE QUARTER SESSIONS. The magistrates of Newcastle, being from their office, and by the charter of Elizabeth, justices of the peace for the Town and County of Newcastle, hold sessions of the peace every quarter of a year, in the Guild-hall. The recorder presides. TRINITY HOUSE. THE SOCIETY OF MASTERS AND MARINERS. THIS society was first denominated an ancient, religious, or secular guild, with the title of the \" Guild or fraternity of the blessed Trinity,\" consisting of both sexes, and founded by some ancient royal authority, not now certainly known. In 1492, this society appears to have been an incorporated body, and purchased the site of their present house in the Broad Clare; for which a red rose was to be presented yearly, at midsummer, if demanded. A pottle of wine, for some additional grant, was continued to be paid annually, above a century after.\n\n68 Queen Elizabeth and king James II. each granted the society, charters, founding them anew, by the name of the Master, Pilots, and Seamen of the Trinity-House, of Newcastle upon Tyne, to be a perpetual brotherhood, consisting of nineteen elder brethren, who, with the rest, styled younger brethren, should, yearly, on the Sunday next after Candlemas, choose a master, two elder wardens, and two younger ones, as also four assistants out of the elder brethren, with as many out of the younger, for the government of the fraternity, and safe custody of the possessions thereof. Their jurisdiction extends to all the ports and creeks between Whitby and Holy Island, both inclusive; and they have the sole appointment of all sea and river pilots within these limits. COMPANIES OF FREEMEN AND\n\nTHEIR PRIVILEGES. THERE are several societies or companies in Newcastle, which, as well as the Trinity House, have the privilege of making the sons and apprentices of their members freemen of the town. They thus obtain the right of voting for its representatives in parliament, for, without being a freeman, no freeholder has a vote ; neither can he vote for the county of Northumberland ; so that by far the greatest number of the inhabitants can hardly be said to be represented.\n\nThe Meeting House of the company of Smiths, adjacent to the Black Friars, is remarkable for having been once the scene of a particular state transaction. The ground floor, once the chapel of that fraternity, was the room in which homage was done by the Scottih king to the king of England, for the kingdom of Scotland. THE RIVER TYNE, AND POLICE, &c. 69 THIS river is navigable from Sparhawk, the name given to a rock at its entrance, to Hedwyn Streams, a distance of about nineteen miles; and, like most others, rises from different sources, some of them about seventy miles north-west from its mouth, but, if measured by its windings, considerably more.\n\nThe channel varies much in its breadth and depth: The entrance at the Low-lights is very narrow, but forming into a fine large basin, nearly the whole length of Shields, renders it a valuable haven. At the west end of this spacious harbour, the tide spreads over the extensive flats of Jarrow Slake, and then, for a considerable distance, runs in a broad and deep channel, called the Long Reach, from whence the tide is obstructed by several windings, till it comes within a mile of Newcastle, whence it again runs in an open stream, till it arrives a mile and a half above the bridge, where it is again considerably intercepted in its course by an island, consisting of about twenty-one acres of pasture ground, called the King's Meadows; after flowing round which, in two narrow channels, and through several beautiful windings, it rises to a little above the village of Newburn, about eight miles from Newcastle, following the course of\n\nthe river. 70\n\nThe tide commonly flows about four hours and a half at Newcastle Bridge. The perpendicular rise of the tide here, in a spring tide, is generally about eleven or twelve feet, and at Tynemouth-bar, about eighteen feet; but it varies greatly from particular circumstances.\n\nThe Bar is a ridge of sand, which lies at the entrance of the River Tyne, on which there is, at spring tides, from twenty-one to twenty-three feet, and at neap tides, from sixteen to eighteen feet at high water.\n\nVessels of thirteen feet draught of water can go up to Newcastle to discharge their cargoes. WATER BAILIFF. There is an officer belonging to the corporation, named a Water Bailiff, whose business it is to prevent offences to the injury of the river, to arrest ships who omit paying their corporation dues, or defraud seamen of their wages; and to seize all goods conveyed on shore in suspected places. He is also to maintain the royalties, privileges, and liberties of the port. He has a deputy allowed him, to assist in the'execution of his very extensive duty. QUAY MASTER. This officer is also appointed by the corporation. His duty is to attend on the quay or wharf, to prevent damage being done; to appoint the births or stations of ships; to assess, by the ton, such ballast as shall be cast out of any ship stationed there; to indorse on the ballast-warrant the number of tons, and due casting of them, without injury to the river; after which the said warrant is returned into the ballast-office in the custom-house, where all corporation dues are now paid. LIFE BOAT. 71 Mr. Greathead, an ingenious boat builder, in South-Shields, constructed a few years ago, by the directions of a committee of ship-owners of South Shields, a boat of such buoyant materials, that in the most violent storms it has been the means of saving the lives of many seamen, who, otherwise, must have fallen vicictims to the tempest, and hence is called a life-boat. He has since built another by order of his Grace the Duke of Northumberland, which is kept at North Shields. For this the Humane Society presented Mr Greathead with a medal. The same artist was then employed, by the corporation of Yarmouth, to construct a similar one, which proved equally successful.\n\nAs this appeared to be a discovery of national importance, the lords of the admiralty took its construction and utility under serious investigation, and so much approved of it, that they ordered Mr Great-head to build life-boats for several harbours in the island.\n\nThis discovery also drew the attention of the legislature ; and on its being laid before parliament Mr Greathead was rewarded by a vote of Â£1200. Lifeboats have since been built, by order of the governments of Russia, Prussia, Sweden, and America.\n\n72 In its construction, the life-boat nearly resembles a Norway Yawl; its keel is of iron, and curved; the bilges on the inside are cased with cork, and it has a considerable spring at each end. It has no mast. The men secure themselves by ropes, and instead of thoules row the boat with grummets, which prevent the oars from being lost. VILLAGES, GENTLEMEN'S SEATS, &c. ADJACENT to so fine a river as that of the Tyne, a stranger will expect to find many genteel residences. We shall therefore briefly describe the principal seats, &c. a particular detail not coming within the limits of our work.\n\nAbove Hexham the river is divided into two streams, called north and south Tyne. Belsay Castle and Swinburne Castle, the seats of Sir C. Middleton Monk, Bart. and of Sir J. Swinburne, Bart. are near the sources of north Tyne, and Chipchase is on the banks of north Tyne, about twenty miles from Newcastle, the seat of J. Reed, Esq.\n\nBywell House, the seat of Mrs Fenwick, is a handsome modern structure, at the west end of the village of Bywell, on the banks of the Tyne, about twelve miles distant from Newcastle. Here are the vestiges of the first bridge constructed by the Romans in their progress north from Chester-le-street. It appears from these remains to have been a strong building.\n\n73 Ovingham, a village further eastward, on the banks of the Tyne, is also pleasantly situated. It has the ruins of the once strong castle of Prudhoe, and a dismantled chapel in full view.\n\nWylam is a populous village, also on the banks of the river. It is about nine miles distant from Newcastle. At the west end is Wylam Hall, the seat of C. Blackett, Esq.\n\nHeddon on the Wall is remarkable for having a considerable part of the Roman Wall almost entire. This village commands a good view of Close House, the seat of C. Bewicke, Esq. This house stands on the side of a hill, and is very desirably thtuated in the vale of the Tyne.\n\nNewburn is a small village. It has been principally noted for its salmon fishery, though this has greatly declined for some years past. The church is at the north-west end of the village, in the form of a cross, with a small tower.\n\nCondercum, now Benwell, was formerly the seat of R. Shaftoe, Esq. This once handsome mansion is now in ruins. The village is pleasantly situated. Further down is Fenham, the manor and seat of W. Ord, Esq. It is a modern and elegant structure.\n\nElswick House, about two miles west from Newcastle, is the seat of J. Hodgson, Esq. This mansion has been lately rebuilt, and from its elevated situation commands an extensive prospect.\n\nAbout four miles wrth from Newcastle, is Gosforth House, the seat of C. J. Brandling, Esq. M. P. This is a modem and stately mansion, with a very extensive park and pleasure grounds. 74\n\nBlagdon, the seat of Sir M. White Ridley, Bart. M. P. and Colonel of the Newcastle Armed Association, is about nine miles north from Newcastle, on the great north road.\n\nHeaton House, the seat of M. Ridley, Esq. son of Sir M. White Ridley, Bart. is a handsome building, about two miles north-east of Newcastle, to which you pass along a part of the Shields turnpike road. From the porter's lodge, by an easy ascent for a quarter of a mile, you reach the village of Byker. This village stands on an eminence, at the west end of which is an artificial castellated ruin. It commands a fine view, including Newcastle and part of the river.\n\nOn the north from Shields road, about three miles distant from Newcastle, is Benton House, the seat of C. W. Bigge, Esq.; near which is another of stone, belonging to T. Bigge, Esq.\n\nCarville, about four miles from Newcastle, obtained its name from a Mr Carr, brother of Wm. Carr, of Etall, Esq., who rebuilt it. It is supposed to have been the Segedunum, a station of the Roman Wall. It stands within a short distance of the Shields road.\n\nAt Willington, about one mile and a half lower down, is the extensive ropery of Messrs Chapman, of Newcastle. Here the ropes are manufactured on a new and much approved principle, for which Mr W. Chapman, the inventor, obtained a patent.\n\n75 Howdon, formerly Howdon Pans, is a populous village, about six miles from Newcastle. Here are a dock, an extensive ship-building-yard, and ropery.\n\nTwo miles further down the river, are North and South Shields, of which we shall give a particular account afterwards.\n\nHaving now enumerated the principal places on the north side, we shall proceed to take a short survey of those on the south side of the Tyne. The first we shall name is Hexham, situated about twenty miles south-west of Newcastle, and built on an eminence, near the united streams of south and north Tyne, giving its name to a large tract of country, called Hexham-shire. It is a town of great antiquity.\n\nThe most learned antiquarians believe it to be Roman. It had one of the most magnificent priories in the kingdom.The Scots, invading the north of England in Edward I time, set the priory on fire, anno 1296, under the conduct of the celebrated Sir Wm. Wallace. It was pillaged again by David king of Scots. On the west side of the market-place are still to be seen the remains of the priory church, or old cathedral.\n\nRyton, about eight miles from Newcastle, is a delightful village, with a good church, situated on au eminence. It has had some eminent men for its rectors, viz. Dr. Cave, who wrote the lives of the Fathers, and Dr. Secker, promoted afterwards to the see of Canterbury. 76 This last gentleman had the honour to christen, marry, and crown our present sovereign, George III.\n\nWhickham, four miles distant from Newcastle, is situated on the brow of a hill. The street, which is nearly a mile in length, contains a neat church, many good houses, and commands a fine prospect.\n\nBeneath Whickham, on its north side, is the populous village of Swalwell, where are the extensive iron works of Messrs Crowley and Co. See manufactories.\n\nAt the north-west end of Swalwell is a handsome bridge of three arches, over the river Derwent, which has a fine effect in the view from Axwell Park House, the seat of Sir T. Clavering, Bart. This is a very fine mansion and of modern architecture. About a mile south up the Derwent, you arrive at Gibside, the seat of the Earl of Strathmore, and Colonel of the Derwent Volunteers.\n\nBy a serpentine road, nearly a mile in length, you wind through the bosom of a thick forest, before you approach the mansion, and enter the open walks. Upon coming out of the wood, you are agreeably struck with a view of the banqueting house, on a very elevated situation, terminating a spacious avenue. This structure is in a high gothic stile, adorned with pinnacles, in the front view of which is a beautiful piece of water : From this basin, to the right, lies a noble sylvan scene, of great extent, hanging on inclining grounds, from a lofty summit to the very skirts of the vale in the midst of which, as a terminating object to the grand vista, rises a fine ionic column of stone one hundred and forty feet in height, surmounted by an elegant gilt statue of liberty.\n\n77 Turning from this striking object, you look along a terrace a mile in length, at the end of which is a chapel, built in a most elegant style, With a rich portico and dome, though not yet completed withinside. The chief parts of the mansion house are old, but the present Earl has completed an entire new wing, and is rebuilding the whole mansion. The back part of Gibside-house is placed so near the brink of a very steep descent, as merely to admit a terrace walk, from whence is a prospect, highly picturesque and beautiful.\n\nThe green-house, the bath, and other edifices, are finished in a good taste. With regard to the sylvan beauties, they are certainly not excelled by any in the country, and are deserving the attention of the visitor. The house contains some good pictures.\n\nDunston, two miles from Newcastle, is a pleasant village, close by the Tyne.\n\nAbout a mile southward, on the neighbouring banks, is Dunston-hill-house, the villa of John Carr, Esq.\n\nAbout three miles from Newcastle, is Ravensworth Castle, the seat of Sir Thos. Liddell, Bart. This castle anciently formed a complete square, with towers. Sir Thomas having projected some improvements, a part of the building has been taken down. The gardens, in which is a most elegant range of hot houses, perhaps not inferior to any in the kingdom, display considerable taste.\n\n78 Further down, within a mile of Newcastle, is Redheugh, the seat of Adam Askew, Esq. Lieut. Colonel of the Gateshead Volunteers. The house is very pleasantly situated, commanding an extensive view of the Tyne, the bridge, the shipping, and a part of Newcastle. The garden, pleasure grounds, and plantations, are laid out with great taste.\n\nWe next come to Gateshead, of which a distinct account, as a separate borough from Newcastle, will be given afterwards.\n\nAlthough it does not fall within the plan we have prescribed to ourselves, yet we must not altogether omit m"
