        "text": "Collections\n\nThe Bewick Society has been compiling a list of the main collections and sites of Thomas Bewick works and engravings. This is by no means an exhaustive catalogue but it does cover the most important work available to the general public, principally in the United Kingdom and the USA.\n\nCherryburn\n\nStation Bank, Mickley, Nr Stocksfield, Northumberland NE43 7DD\n\nTel: 01661 843276\n\nhttp://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cherryburn\n\nNational Trust and Bewick Society members free. A small charge may be made at special events. Bewick’s birthplace cottage, farmyard, garden and play lawn. Also a 19th century farmhouse, the latter home of the Bewick family, houses an exhibition on Bewick’s life and work and there is a small shop selling prints from Bewick’s original wood engravings books and gifts. Demonstrations of wood engraving and printing are given in an adjoining barn. The museum has numerous original works on display but also houses an important archive of Bewick related works including The Justin Schiller collection of books: An assemblage of Children’s books and other examples of Bewick’s work and publications collected by Schiller, a rare book collector based in New York. Dr C. Clark Burman’s collection of 50 woodblocks and plates. A collection of woodblocks from Birds, Quadrupeds and the Fables of Aesop. The copperplate for the engraving of the “The Remarkable Kyloe Ox”, 1790 originally purchased from the Spearman family auction. A large collection of work by Robert Bewick consisting of folios of drawings, two engravings and one folio with manuscript notes.\n\nThe Natural History Society of Northumbria\n\nThe Great North Museum: Hancock, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4PT\n\nDirector: Clare Freeman\n\nArchivist: Post vacant (early 2023)\n\nTel: +44(0)191 222 5834\n\nWeb: https://www.nhsn.org.uk/archive/\n\nE-mail: nhsn@ncl.ac.uk\n\nThe Natural History Society’s archive houses one of the most comprehensive collections of the work of Thomas Bewick in the country. His daughter Isabella Bewick sent a selection of watercolour drawings, held by the Bewick family, to the British Museum in 1882. The remaining collection, which included, a bust of Bewick, family portraits, original artwork and numerous impressions of woodcuts, was presented to the Society in 1884 by the executors of her estate. The Bewick family’s collection of natural history books was presented in 1881. The most important part of the collection are the seven hundred and thirty-eight watercolour and pencil drawings and engravings of British and foreign birds, quadrupeds, vignettes etc. by Thomas Bewick, John Bewick, Robert Bewick and the apprentices (c.1776-1849). These are mostly transfer drawings used for engravings, with some studies and proof engravings. Included is a copy of the famous Chillingham Bull on vellum in the first state. There is also a comprehensive reference collection of various editions of Bewick’s natural history books, some biographies and papers on Bewick etc. There are a number of bird specimens drawn by Bewick in the museum collections and the Wombat specimen figured by Robert Bewick in Fox’s Synopsis of the Newcastle Museum. Within the rest of the archive collections are correspondence and manuscripts relating to other luminaries known to Bewick, such as P. J. Selby, George Clayton Atkinson, John Hancock, William Armstrong, Matthew Consett etc. Catalogue: All items have been catalogued on a computer database.\n\nNewcastle City Library\n\nCharles Avison Building, 33 New Bridge Street West, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8AX\n\nContact: Andrew Scrogham, Service Delivery Specialist Heritage\n\nTel: +44(0)191 277 4100\n\nE-mail: information@newcastle.gov.uk\n\nWebsite: Newcastle Collection\n\nThe Bewick Collection is based on the Pease Bequest, the large collection amassed by John William Pease (1836-1901) of Bewick's works in all editions, with associated materials, all bequeathed to the City on his death and first housed in the Public Reference Library. A complete Catalogue was produced in 1904 by Basil Anderton, Public Librarian, and his assistant, W. H. Gibson. It covers 331 items, of which 170 are books. The associated materials include Bewick's box of tools, which had been given to Joseph Crawhall by Isabella Bewick in 1882 for acting as her executor. The Bewick Collection is too large to be all on display, so if a visitor wants to see something, Sarah Mulligan (sarah.mulligan@newcastle.gov.uk) or Andrew Scrogham (andrew.scrogham@newcastle.gov.uk) should be contacted in advance. Considerable additions, including books and woodblocks, have been made to the collection since 1901.\n\nCatalogue: The Catalogue of the Bewick Collection (Pease Bequest) 1904 by Basil Anderton can be viewed at the library, accessions made to the collection after that date are recorded in a manuscript ledger held at the library.\n\nAccess: See website www.newcastle.gov.uk/libraries for opening hours. Viewing of the complete Pease collection will be by appointment only, requests to be made by written application to the Service Specialist (Heritage). Certain items, such as the books, may be viewed at any time in the Local Studies Centre.\n\nThe Great North Museum: Hancock\n\nBarras Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4PT\n\nSenior Curator: Malavika Anderson\n\nWeb: https://greatnorthmuseum.org.uk/about-us/about-gnm\n\nAccess: Free Entry.\n\nThe Great North Museum: Hancock is owned by the Natural History Society of Northumbria and managed and curated by Tyne and Wear Museums. Named after John Hancock, who was a life long friend of the Bewick family, the museum has many connections with Thomas Bewick. Some of the very first drawings Bewick prepared for British Birds were made from a collection of stuffed birds in the museum of Marmaduke Tunstall of Wycliffe Hall, near Barnard Castle in 1791. A few of these very early specimens are preserved today in the museum collections.\n\nTyne and Wear Archives\n\nBlandford House, Blandford Square, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 4JA\n\nWeb: https://twarchives.org.uk/\n\nContact: Chief Archivist: Lizzy Baker\n\nTel: 0191 232 6789.\n\nE-mail: archives@twmuseums.org.uk\n\nThis is a particularly important archive of the manuscript account books, ledgers and other items detailing the day to day business of Thomas Bewick and Ralph Beilby’s engraving workshop.

Remarkably strong in nineteenth century literature, it also holds local history material. The Society holds lectures, recitals and other meetings, which are open to members and to the general public. Bewick was a member of the Society from 1799 until his death in 1828 and was associated with many of its founder members. The library has an extensive collection of books by and about Bewick and has on display the marble bust of Thomas Bewick by Edward Hodges Bailey RA, taken from a life mask in 1825 as well as a portrait of Bewick by Ramsay. There is a framed manuscript letter from Bewick to his wife, sent from Wycliffe near Barnard Castle in 1791. Catalogue: Library card index system and computer access to catalogue.

The two most significant items being: The original woodblock for Bewick’s famous and most successful engraving The Chillingham Bull, 1789 commissioned by Marmaduke Tunstall of Wycliffe Hall. The block was purchased by Robert Robinson in 1876 from the Misses Bewick (Robinson, 1887 p.279) and was by 1904 in the possession of Thomas Gow (Anderton & Gibson, 1904 p.82). The original woodblock for Bewick’s last and unfinished large engraving Waiting for Death, a few impressions of which were published by Robert Bewick in 1832. Bewick was working on this block at the time of his death and it was to have been augmented by two or three more blocks to add tonal colour. Robert Robinson also purchased this block in 1876 and it was also in the possession of Thomas Gow by 1904 (Anderton & Gibson, 1904 p.87). The collection also consists of a small number of preparatory drawings for vignettes and circus tickets as well as some of the larger impressions including the Tiger, Lion, Zebra and Elephant produced for Gilbert Pidcock, proprietor of a travelling menagerie. A number of early volumes of books complete the assemblage.

Its collection of well over 5,000 works of art includes historical and contemporary paintings, sculptures, installation works and photographs by Canadian and international artists. The Bewick collection was last exhibited in 2014:\"The AGA has in its collection 830 wood engravings by British artist Thomas Bewick that he created with his apprentices in the late-18th century. The images, referred to by Bewick as tale-pieces, are illustrations for publications printed around 1797. They are imagined studies of animals and birds created using the classifications systems of the day and referenced contemporary practices of recording natural history. The illustrations were divided into categories for two publications: A General History of Quadrupeds and A History of British Birds, which were reprinted numerous times due to their popularity. The images are fascinating in the technical execution of the small illustrations and because many were created from the imagination of the artist based on descriptions from expedition reports and second-hand accounts. This exhibition features a selection of over 200 images depicting both animals and birds. The Thomas Bewick collection was gifted to the AGA in 1990 by Dr. David Lemon.\" - See more at: http://www.youraga.ca/exhibit/thomasbewick#sthash.zrj39OJp.dpuf\n\nPhoto credit: By Stella Blu\n\nYale Center for British Art\n\nYale University\n\n1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Connecticut\n\nWeb: http://britishart.yale.edu/\n\nItems from the Yale University collection were exhibited in August 2014: Of Green Leaf, Bird, and Flower: Artist’s Books and the Natural World.
