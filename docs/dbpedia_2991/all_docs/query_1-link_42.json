        "text": "Sir Charles Algernon Parsons (born June 13, 1854, London—died Feb. 11, 1931, Kingston, Jamaica) was a British engineer whose invention of a multi-stage steam turbine revolutionized marine propulsion.\n\nParsons entered the Armstrong engineering works at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1877. In 1889, after working for several other companies, he established his own works at Newcastle for the manufacture of steam turbines, dynamos, and other electrical apparatus.\n\nThe turbine Parsons invented in 1884 utilized several stages in series; in each stage the expansion of the steam was restricted to the extent that allowed the greatest extraction of kinetic energy without causing the turbine blades to overspeed. Parsons’ turbine was fitted with a condenser in 1891 for use in electric generating stations, and in 1897 it was successfully applied to marine propulsion in the “Turbinia,” a ship that attained a speed of 34 1/2 knots, extraordinary for the time. The turbine was soon used by warships and other steamers.\n\nIn addition to the chairmanship of C.A. Parsons and Company, Parsons held directorial positions on the boards of several other electrical supply and engineering companies. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society (1898), was awarded the Royal Society’s Rumford Medal (1902), and was president of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1905–06) and of the British Association (1919–20). He was knighted in 1911 and given the Order of Merit in 1927."
