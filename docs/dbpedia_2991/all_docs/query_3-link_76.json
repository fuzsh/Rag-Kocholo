        "text": "1. Biography\n\n1.2 Portraits\n\nCavendish’s publications stand out not only because of their number (thirteen in total), but also because they visually represent a campaign of public self-promotion rare among women authors of the time. Cavendish not only self-published lavish presentation volumes, but she had many of the frontispieces engraved with her portraits – leaving no one in doubt as to the author. Unlike Conway and Masham, who cultivated socially acceptable anonymity, she unabashedly sought publicity.\n\nHistorical context\n\nTo put Cavendish’s publications in context, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, the number of women whose works were published in print increased to the hundreds. However, most of these works were not published in quarto or folio format – what we would today think of as “book” and “large book” formats. According to Jane Stevenson, “well over half of seventeenth-century women’s ventures into print – approximately 60% – belong to the level of printing which was only one step up from the broadsheet ballad: pamphlets which amounted to one or one-and-a-half sheets cut and folded.” (Stevenson, 2009, pg. 207)\n\nThis would not do for Cavendish. As a wealthy aristocrat, she did not need to publish for financial gain; rather, self-published in order to gain widespread recognition from philosophers and academics. To give her works respectability, she published them in a format expected for scholarly works, the kind that would be included in university libraries, and commissioned the best possible publishers, printers, and illustrators. She published her first six works with the upscale London publishers John Martin and James Allestrye, who worked with some of the best printers, such as T. Roycroft. It is not clear why, but in 1662 Cavendish decided to work directly with a different printer, William Wilson, and after 1666, with the Anne Maxwell. Her works were published in the large folio format, which was usually reserved for classical authors, Bibles, or theological works.\n\nAbraham Van Diepenbeeck\n\nMoreover, Cavendish commissioned multiple portrait frontispieces for her works from Abraham Van Diepenbeeck (1596-1675) a Dutch stained-glass painter, painter and illustrator. Today he has been largely forgotten and is remembered in association with the Dutch painter Peter Paul Rubens. Van Diepenbeeck was familiar with Rubens’s work and produced a number of engravings based on his paintings. When he was rediscovered in the 19th century, many of the copies of Rubens’s paintings were attributed to him. Van Diepenbeeck was, however, a painter in his own right, although it is difficult to track down all his paintings and drawings (research forthcoming). It is not clear why Cavendish settled on Van Diepenbeeck; perhaps there is a personal connection: during their exile in Antwerp, Cavendish and her husband Sir William stayed in a house formerly owned by Rubens. Sir William also commissioned Van Diepenbeeck to draw family portraits, one of which is included in Cavendish’s works as a frontispiece, and to draw several illustrations for his publication on horse dressage, La Méthode Nouvelle et Invention Extraordinaire de Dresser les Chevaux (1658).\n\nImage of Van Diepenbeeck forthcoming.\n\nVan Diepenbeeck individual portraits\n\n(1) Image of the Minerva & Apollo portrait, courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\nMultiple portraits by Van Diepenbeeck appear in many of Cavendish’s works. One is a picture of Cavendish in “which she appears as a classical heroine, standing in a masculine heroic pose with hand on hip, elbow pointed towards the viewer, draped in loose robes, wearing sandals, and standing in a statue’s niche between herms of Minerva and Apollo, who turn their heads in her direction. Marchioness Sappho, so to say.” (Stevenson, 2009, pg. 212). The portrait was engraved by Pieter Louis van Schuppen, after Abraham Diepenbeeck, and appears in six of the works digitized in the Early English Books Online proprietary database (EEBO).\n\nThe inscription below the portrait states:\n\nHere on this Figure Cast a Glance,\n\nBut so as if it were by Chance,\n\nYour eyes not fixt, they must not stay,\n\nSince this like Shadowes to the Day\n\nIt only represent’s; for Still,\n\nHer Beuty’s found beyond the Skill\n\nOf the best Paynter, to Imbrace,\n\nThose lovely Lines within her face,\n\nView her Soul’s Picture, Judgment, witt,\n\nThen read those Lines which Shee hath writt,\n\nBy Phancy’s Pencill drawn alone\n\nWhich Peece but Shee, Can justly owns.\n\n(2) Image of the Scholar portrait, courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\nAnother portrait is “as Scholar Marchioness: she sits by her writing table, wearing a plain dark dress, a feminine equivalent of scholar’s black, though she also wears a marchioness’s coronet, while a fine carriage clock takes the place of the hourglass used in scholars’ portraits to indicate that time is being well used. A cloth of state hangs above her, and in front of her, separating her from the viewer, is a low balustrade, such as was used to divide the monarch or aristocrat on his dais from the rest of the room.” (Stevenson, 2009, pg. 212) It is not clear who was the engraver of this image. Note: Unfortunately this portrait does not appear in any of digitized copies of Cavendish’s works available in EEBO. Perhaps it appears in different copies (research forthcoming).\n\nOther individual portraits\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery’s website indicates that there are at least three other extant portraits, engraved after Van Diepenbeeck:\n\n(3) Seated portrait, engraver unknown. This portrait appears in two of the works on EEBO. Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London (two copies).\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy one\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy two\n\n(4) Draped robe standing portrait, various engravers. Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London (three copies).\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy one\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy two\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy three\n\n(5) Court dress with pillar standing portrait, by William Greatbach, after Abraham Diepenbeeck. Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London (two copies.)\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy one\n\nNPG Cavendish portrait copy two\n\nVan Diepenbeeck – family portraits\n\nThere are also four group family portraits engraved after drawings by Van Diepenbeeck, some of which also serve as frontispieces. Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\n(6) The Duke and his family, by Peter van Lisebetten (Lysebetten, Liesebetten), after Abraham Diepenbeeck.\n\n(7) William & Margaret Cavendish seated, by Peter van Lisebetten (Lysebetten, Liesebetten), after Abraham Diepenbeeck.\n\n(8) The Duke and his family in Antwerp, by Peeter Clouwet, after Abraham Diepenbeeck. This portrait appears once in Cavendish’s works in EEBO.\n\nThe inscription below the picture states:\n\nThus in this Semy-Circle wher they Sitt,\n\nTelling of Tales of pleasure & of witt,\n\nHeer you may read without a Sinn or Crime,\n\nAnd how more Innocently pass your tyme\n\n(9) William & Margaret Cavendish, small seated picture, by James Mitan, after Peeter Clouwet.\n\nPainted portraits\n\nThe portrait on our website is by Gonzales Coques, and is called “Portrait of a Married Couple in a Park,” or “Lord Cavendish und Seine Frau Margaret im Rubensgarten in Antwerpen” (Kat.Nr. 858). The image is reproduced here with the permission of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemäldegalerie. Foto: Jörg P. Anders.\n\nTo date, we have been able to identify two additional possible painted portraits. One is attributed to Sir Peter Lely, but many scholars suggest that this is a painting of Cavendish’s oldest sister. Another one is attributed to Van Diepenbeeck, and was reproduced in Grant’s (1957) biography by the permission of the Duke of Portland, K.G.\n\nList of portraits & frontispieces in Early English Books Online\n\nNote: the following information is from digitized copies of originals available in the Early English Books Online proprietary database. First editions are in bold.

Primary Sources Guide\n\nCavendish delighted in publicizing her work: unlike her fellow English philosophers Conway and Masham, she insisted on having her name, and usually a portrait, printed in her works. Given that she was a prolific writer, we have tried to breakdown the information on primary sources in a helpful way. Section 2.1 provides a chronological reference list of Cavendish’s published works, a breakdown of the references according to specific work and its editions, and a list of modern editions. Section 2.2 provides a brief description of each of her works.\n\nThere is no standard critical edition of Cavendish’s complete works, and few of her writings are available in their entirety in modern editions. However, digital scans of the originals of all her works are available electronically through the Early English Books Online (proprietary) database. It also makes available modern text transcriptions of all the first editions of the texts.\n\nAn annotated list of Cavendish’s texts, printers, and booksellers (1653-1675) has been compiled by Cameron Kroetsch and is available for download as a PDF on the Digital Cavendish Project website.\n\nSpreadsheet overview: Excel file\n\n2.1 Primary Sources\n\nChronological list\n\nCavendish, Margaret. 1653.

Primary Sources Description\n\nCavendish was a prolific writer, composing thirteen works of varied genre, including poems, plays, fiction, orations, letters and philosophical essays. It can be a challenge to keep track of the different works, editions, and their content. Below is an overview of the content of her works. Since scholars differ in their interpretations of the works – for example, there is not a consensus on exactly which ones contain her “natural philosophy” – the descriptions are brief. The overview table in this section lists the first editions, and subsequent editions only where a work underwent major revision.\n\nHelpful resources regarding Cavendish’s specific works include:\n\nStewart Duncan’s overview of the Philosophical Letters (1664)\n\nTable of contents and sources link.\n\nCross-listed at The Digital Cavendish Project.\n\nA handful of the letters are reproduced online here.\n\nEmory Women Writers Resource Project digital edition of the atomic poems included in the first fifty or so pages of Poems and Fancies (1653):\n\nDigital edition can be found here.\n\nCritical introduction to digital edition can be found here.\n\n‘The Language of Genres’ data analysis of Cavendish’s texts by Jacob Tootalian, PhD candidate in English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, can be found on the Digital Cavendish Project website.\n\nArticles which summarize the content of Cavendish’s works on natural philosophy:\n\nBoyle, Deborah. 2004. “Margaret Cavendish’s Nonfeminist Natural Philosophy.” Configurations: A Journal of Literature, Science, and Technology 12 (2): 195-227.\n\nJames, Susan, ed. 2003. Margaret Cavendish: Political Writings. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (A critical edition of The Blazing World and Orations.)\n\nDescriptions of Cavendish’s works\n\nSource\n\nYear\n\nBrief description\n\nPoems and Fancies 1653 A collection of poems, epistles and some prose on a variety of topics. It is notable because the first fifty pages contain poems on atoms, and offer atomistic explanations of various natural phenomena such as cold, life, death, frost, etc. Various other topics include animals, the sun, roaring of the sea, witches of Lapland, battle between life and death, love, passions, etc.\n\nEmory Women Writers Resource Project digital edition of the atomic poems.\n\nPhilosophical Fancies 1653 A collection of short thoughts and verse on natural and other topics such as: matter, nature, infinite knowledge, vacuum, division, pleasure, senses, thinking, animals, optics, planets, etc. The World’s Olio 1655 Note: the term ‘olio’ means a ‘miscellaneous collection of things.’\n\nA collection of short essays on a variety of social topics such as fame, why men write books, translating, languages, music, dancing, virtues and vices, mind and body, riches and poverty, etc. It contains references to various historical and mythological figures.\n\nPhilosophical and Physical Opinions 1655 Offers explanations of various natural phenomena such as life, death, growth, passions, light, earth, water, air, fire, and diseases, in terms of motion as well as in non-mechanistic terms. The work also discusses variety in nature and the possibility of our knowledge of nature. The front matters includes the Condemning Treatise of Atomes, which is sometimes interpreted as a rejection her earlier atomistic views. Nature’s Pictures 1656 A collection of stories in verse, prose and dialogues mostly on the topic of love, in which Cavendish discusses the position of women in society. She also satirizes the use of tobacco. The first edition (but not the second 1671 edition) contains an autobiographical letter titled ‘A True Relation of my Birth, Breeding and Life.’ Plays 1662 The first collection of plays includes fourteen pieces, many of which comment on the position of women in society:\n\nLoves Adventures\n\nThe Several Wits\n\nYouths Glory, and Death’s Banquet\n\nThe Lady Contemplation\n\nWits Cabal\n\nThe Unnatural Tragedy\n\nThe Public Wooing\n\nThe Matrimonial Trouble\n\nNature’s Three Daughters, Beauty, Love and Wit\n\nThe Religious\n\nThe Comical Hash\n\nBell in Campo\n\nA Comedy of the Apocryphal Ladies\n\nThe Female Academy\n\nOrations of Divers Sorts 1662 A collection of oratory speeches which present multiple opposing views on subjects to do with a fictional society which is on the brink of civil war. The orations take up subjects such as the pros and cons of peace and war, the levying of taxes, theft, adultery, and virtues appropriate to private and public life. Some of the orations also explore the position of women in society, and discuss the reasons for women’s subordinate position to men, including their lack of educational opportunities. Philosophical and Physical Opinions 1663 This is a major revision of Cavendish’s earlier work of the same title. The 1655 first edition is 174 pages, but the 1663 edition is 510 pages including the prefaces and index. To read an open access version of this text, see Margaret Cavendish: Philosophical and Physical Opinions (1663 edition), edited by Marcy Lascano. Sociable Letters 1664 A collection of fictional and partly auto-biographical letters between two gentlewomen. The witty letters discuss a variety of social topics from daily life, notably love and the institution of marriage. The work is often interpreted as a critique of marriage. Philosophical Letters 1664 The work presents Cavendish’s natural philosophy and engages with the ideas of Hobbes, Descartes, Henry More, J.B. Van Helmont, and other seventeenth-century philosophers such as Robert Boyle and William Harvey. For example, Cavendish discusses their mechanical explanations of perception, light and colors, the view that motion can be transferred, and their views on immaterial substances. She also discusses the limits of human knowledge. The work is often interpreted as a critical response to these philosophers.\n\nStewart Duncan’s overview of the Letters:\n\nTable of contents and sources link\n\nCross-listed at The Digital Cavendish Project\n\nA handful of the letters are reproduced online here\n\nObservations upon Experimental Philosophy 1666 The work discusses the mechanical, corpuscular and experimental philosophy promoted by the Royal Society, and the use of new instruments such as microscopes and telescopes. It is often interpreted as a direct critique of the Royal Society’s work, especially Robert Hooke’s Micrographiaand Robert Boyle’s experiments. The work also discusses mechanistic explanations of natural phenomena and atomism.\n\nSome scholars suggest that the Observations and The Blazing World, which were initially published together, should be viewed as philosophical companion pieces despite their different genres.\n\nThe Blazing World\n\n(published with Observations)\n\n1666 A fictional sci-fi utopia, which tells a story of a woman who is abducted from her world and becomes the Empress of a different world, where she proceeds to set up learned societies, study immaterial spirits, and wage futuristic-style warfare back in her own world. The Duchess of Newcastle acts as an adviser to the Empress. The work is considered a forerunner of science fiction, and is often interpreted as a satire of the Royal Society and the irrelevance of its methods for effective political governance. The Life of William 1667 A biography of her husband, William Cavendish, the first Duke of Newcastle. The biography became very popular and was reprinted several times. Plays, Never Before Printed 1668 The second collection of plays consists of six new pieces. Like her first collection of plays, the second set comments on women’s’ position in society. Many of them also poke fun at the dashing ‘rake’ lover ideal of the Restoration period.\n\nThe Sociable Companions, or the Female Wits\n\nThe Presence\n\nScenes (edited from The Presence)\n\nThe Bridals\n\nThe Convent of Pleasure\n\nA Piece of a Play\n\nGrounds of Natural Philosophy\n\n(3rd edition of Philosophical and Physical Opinions)\n\n1668 A revised second edition of Philosophical and Physical Opinions. The work, split into thirteen sections, presents Cavendish’s view on natural philosophy and its implications for a variety of natural phenomena, such as perception, animal and human reproduction, appetites and passions, human dreams, illness, etc. It also discusses natural phenomena such as fire, tides, wind, the motions of the planets, etc.\n\nThe work includes five appendices on the topics of immaterial spirits, possibility of other worlds, happiness of creatures, natural conditions in an irregular world, and the possibility of resurrection by means of restoring beds or ‘wombs.’\n\n3. Secondary Sources Guide\n\nThe following reference list focuses on scholarship that is most relevant to philosophy. The list is by no means exhaustive, as Cavendish is a very popular figure in many humanistic disciplines and the scholarly literature is vast. A critical treatise of Cavendish’s philosophy from an analytic philosophy perspective has not yet been published, although new scholarship is forthcoming.\n\nBibliographies\n\nFor extensive bibliographies categorized according to topic, please consult the following resources:\n\nJames, Susan, ed. 2003.

Correspondence\n\nPlease note that just as there is no authoritative edition of Cavendish’s work, there is no comprehensive edition of her extant correspondence. More research on her correspondence and extant manuscripts is forthcoming. Below is information on some of the frequently cited sources of Cavendish’s correspondence.\n\nPhilosophical correspondence\n\nCavendish was able to engage only a few philosophers in more extensive correspondence. The two key extant exchanges are with Constantijn Huygens and Joseph Glanvill, and are covered in detail in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. The correspondence with Huygens covers (1653-1671) and discusses the phenomenon of Rupert’s Drops and Cavendish’s presentation of her works to the University of Leiden. The correspondence with John Glanvill (probably 1667-1668) discusses topics such as pre-existence of the souls, Platonist views on substance, and the existence of witches.\n\nA Collection of Letters and Poems\n\nA key source of correspondence is the collection of poems and letters sent to Cavendish and her husband William, which William published in 1678 after her death: A Collection of Letters and Poems Microform / Written by Several Persons of Honour and Learning, upon Divers Important Subjects, to the late Duke and Dutchess of Newcastle. It also includes a number of eulogies dedicated to Cavendish. The collection is from a variety of authors, poets such as Thomas Shadwell, academics from Cambridge University, and natural philosophers such as Walter Charleton, Kenelm Digby, Thomas Hobbes, Constantijn Huygens, Joseph Glanville, and Henry More. Cavendish knew most of these philosophers through her husband and his brother Charles Cavendish, who actively promoted the new experimental philosophy and sponsored philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes (see Section 6 on Connections.)\n\nMany of these letters are polite thank you letters full of praise for Cavendish’s presents of her works. Cavendish was in the habit of sending expensively printed copies of her own books to eminent scholars and university libraries, including Oxford, Cambridge and Leiden, in order to gain public recognition. Cavendish’s high social position and the support of her politically, academically, as well as financially well-connected husband William enabled her to do so. The lucky recipients were thus obliged by social convention, and sometimes by the need for patronage, to accept and praise the presents. Cavendish’s approach was scandalous at a time when women were expected to stay out of public limelight, or at the very least to publish their thoughts anonymously. This was the path taken by Conway and Masham, but Cavendish preferred to be ridiculed by society rather than stay silent. There is scholarly debate, however, as to whether her strategy worked: there is general agreement that she was not taken seriously by her contemporaries, but it is not clear whether this was because of the quality of her philosophical ideas, the non-conventional genres she used to express them, or because of her blatant disregard for social conventions.\n\nPrimary source\n\nCavendish, William, Duke of Newcastle, ed. 1678.

The letter is reprinted in the Diary and Correspondence of John Evelyn (1857) edited by William Bray. In the letter Cavendish thanks Evelyn for sending her his work Sylva, or a Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber in his Majesty’s Dominions (1664). Evelyn originally presented his work as a paper at the Royal Society in 1662. It became one of the most influential works on the topic of forestry.

He was also the Secretary to two Princes of Orange, Frederick Henry and William II. Huygens grew up in the French-Dutch environment of the Netherlands, and was fluent in in Dutch, English, French, and Latin. As a result, he was extremely well connected in the political and scholarly circles on the European Continent and in England, with scholars estimating that he wrote and received more than 100,000 letters in his lifetime – 10,000 of which are still extant today. Among his correspondence are more than hundred-twenty letters with René Descartes, whom he assisted with the publication of his Discours de la Méthode (1637). He also maintained close relationships and numerous correspondence women. Among the aristocracy he kept in touch with Cavendish, Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia, and Queen Christina of Sweden, but he also kept in touch with female scholars such as Anna Maria Van Schurman, poets, ladies in waiting, and other female relations of his male contacts (Huysman and Leerintveld, 2014).\n\nContent of correspondence\n\nHuygens met Cavendish in person in Antwerp in 1657, when she and her husband were in political exile in Antwerp (1648-1660). They probably met once more in February 1658 (Akkerman & Corporaal, 2009.) They corresponded during her stay in the Netherlands and kept in touch even after Cavendish’s return back to England. Their extant correspondence dates from 1657-1671. The first four letters discuss the phenomenon of Rupert’s Drops, with both Cavendish and Huygens attempting to give an explanation. The drops were named after Prince Rupert of the Rhine who first brought the drops to England. The drops are produced by dripping molten glass into cold water, and the result is tadpole-shaped glass object which has very strange properties: the “head” is unbreakable and can withstand hammer blows, whereas the sligthest disturbance to the tail makes the entire object explode. The phenomenon was considered highly puzzling in the seventeenth century, with even the Sun King of France, Louis XIV, taking an interest. They were also debated by the Royal Society in London, and Robert Hooke discusses them in his work Micrographia (1665).\n\nAfter her departure from Netherlands, Cavendish kept in touch with Huygens and regularly sent him new publications of her works. The next three letters concern Cavendish’s request to Huygens to present a gift volume of her works, including Poems and Fancies, Nature’s Pictures, The World’s Olio, and Philosophical and Physical Opinions, to the Rector of the University of Leiden. Huygens executed the request, and Rector presented in he works in a public meeting in front of the Academic Senate and sent Cavendish a grateful letter of acceptance. The volumes are still extant at the university library today (Akkerman & Corporaal 2009).\n\nThe final three letters of the correspondence are social and polite in nature.\n\nShort and fun educational video on Rupert’s Drops from SmarterEveryDay.\n\nHooke’s description in Micrographia, courtesy of Hathi Trust (pp.33-44, also PDF below).\n\nExtant correspondence\n\nThere are a total of eleven extant letters whose content scholars have access to. Eight of the letters that Huygens and Cavendish exchanged survive in manuscript: four by Huygens to Cavendish, and four by Cavendish to Huygens. There are three additional letters to supplement the correspondence: a letter from Huygens to Utricia Swann, which mentions Cavendish; a letter from Cavendish to Huygens which is in a private collection; and a letter from Huygens to Cavendish which is not extant, but which was reprinted by Sir William Cavendish after Cavendish’s death in A Collection of Letters and Poems Microform (1678). All of the letters are in English.\n\nUntil recently, the canonical edition of Huygens’s letters was by J.A. Worp, De Briefwisseling Van Constantijn Huygens (1916 & 1917). Worp’s edition was important for the preservation of Huygens’s correspondence, but it did not conform to current scholarly practices. For example, some of the letters are abridged or summarized, including two of the letters in the Cavendish-Huygens correspondence.\n\nAkkerman & Corporaal research\n\nNadine Akkerman and Marguerite Corporaal’s recently brought attention to the Cavendish-Huygens correspondence, and identified two additional letters that are not in the Worp edition. One is in the Collection of Letters and one is in a private collection. They have also carefully transcribed the manuscripts, including Huygens’s corrections.\n\nTheir research and the transcript of the letters, including the two additional ones, is available online here.\n\nHuygens Institute Digital Project\n\nThe Huygens Institute of Dutch History and National Library of the Netherlands provides a new digital edition of the complete Huygens correspondence, including that with Cavendish. The digital edition includes information on letter and manuscript location, manuscript images, links to relevant secondary literature, as well as PDF and OTC versions of the Worp edition. The digital edition also aims to aid scholars in letter analysis, including analysis of Huygens’s communication with women. Please note that the edition does not (as yet) include the two additional letters identified by Akkerman and Corporaal.\n\nFor more information on Huygens’s correspondence and the digital project see:\n\nHuysman, I., and A.

In his work The Vanity of Dogmatizing(1661), he discusses topics such as Aristotelianism and Descartes, the possibility of certain knowledge, and causation. The work was controversial, and Glanvill responded to criticisms in his work Scepsis Scientific (1664). He dedicated the work to the Royal Society, which promptly elected him as a member. Glanvill spent the rest of his life defending the work of the Society and the new experimental methods of natural philosophy it embodied. Glanvill also became famous for his publications on witches. His posthumously published work on witches, Saducismus Triumphatus (1681), to which Henry More added some materials, became one of the best known works on the existence of witches, both in England and on the Continent. This may seem surprising for a member of the Royal Society, but at the time, the topic of witches was relevant to discussions of immaterial substances, materialism and atheism. He was not alone in his interest in the supernatural, and corresponded on the topic with philosophers such as Henry More and Robert Boyle.\n\nAlthough Glanvill did not know Cavendish personally, he was one of the few scholars who engaged with her in philosophical debate. Some scholars suggest that this is because he was seeking Cavendish’s patronage. In either case, he sent Cavendish a copy of his first work on witchcraft, A Philosophical Endeavour Towards the Defense of the Being of Witches and Apparitions (1666), which led to correspondence between the two.\n\nThere are seven extant letters from John Glanvill to Cavendish which remain from this correspondence, all published in A Collection of Letters and Poems Microform (1678), which Cavendish’s husband Sir William published after her death. For philosophical analysis and historical context of the correspondence see Jacqueline Broad’s article “Margaret Cavendish and Joseph Glanvill: Science, Religion, and Witchcraft.” (2007)\n\nSpreadsheet overview of correspondence: Excel file\n\nModern transcript of the letters: PDF file\n\nImage of Glanvill’s work forthcoming.\n\nContent overview\n\nLetter\n\nDate\n\nPage\n\nContent\n\n1 December, no year 85 Asks Cavendish to accept a copy of his book on witchcraft. 2 Undated 98-100 Thanks Cavendish for a present, distinguishes between two kinds of knowledge, and discusses the knowledge one can gain from experiments. 3 13 October, no year 102-103 Discusses mechanism and vitalism, and asks Cavendish for a donation of books to the Bath library. 4 25 August, no year 104-105 Thanks Cavendish for her present of a history book that she wrote (presumably the Life of William); mentions another of his works on witches and plastic faculties; and discusses disputes and his work on the subject; and mentions that he has not read a book on experimental philosophy that Cavendish wrote to him about. 5 13 October 1667 123-127 Discusses the nature of plastic faculties; Platonist views on souls and bodies; soul-body interaction; mentions Scepsis Scientifica; discusses the possibility of a theory of nature, and the state of natural philosophy and natural history; mentions the Royal Society.\n\nHe also discusses at length his views on the pre-existence of the souls and answers Cavendish’s questions and objections on the subject.

The collection includes letters to Margaret Cavendish from Constantijn Huygens and Joseph Glanvill, but also six additional letters from other natural philosophers. The three letters from Walter Charleton mostly contain praise of Cavendish and her philosophy. The other three letters, one each from Kenelm Digby, Thomas Hobbes, and Henry More, are short notes expressing thanks for Cavendish’s presents of her works. For a brief overview of the letters see the table at the end of this section.\n\nA modern transcript of the letters is available for download below. Please note that the original source comes from the Early English Books Online database. The letters were subsequently edited: the spelling and some of the grammar was modernized to make the text more accessible and a pleasure to read.\n\nPDF file\n\nRené Descartes\n\nCavendish also appears to have met Descartes (1596-1650), but there is scholarly debate on whether she ever even held a conversation with him, on the account of her not understanding French. In the front matter of her Philosophical and Physical Opinions (1655), Cavendish includes An Epiloge to My Philosophical Opinions, in which she discusses her contact with Descartes. Below is the relevant excerpt. For a complete transcript see Section 5.4.\n\n“Some say that my book of philosophy, it seems as if I had conversed with Descartes or Master Hobbes, or both, or have frequented their studies, by reading their works, but I cannot say but I have seen them both, but upon my conscience I never spoke to Monsieur Descartes in my life, nor ever understood what he said, for he spoke no English, and I understand no other language, and those times I saw him, which was twice at dinner with my Lord at Paris, he did appear to me a man of the fewest words I ever heard.”\n\nWilliam and Charles Cavendish\n\nMargaret Cavendish’s husband William Cavendish (1593-1676) was a writer, playwright, poet, Royalist army officer, and an enthusiastic patron of the new mechanical and experimental natural philosophy. He was the key patron of Thomas Hobbes. His brother Charles Cavendish (1595?–1654) was a mathematician and also a patron of natural philosophers and mathematicians. Through her marriage to William, Margaret also gained access to the brothers’ extensive network. There is, however, scholarly debate on how much personal intellectual contact she was actually able to have with the philosophers the Cavendishes cultivated.\n\nMargaret dedicated many of her works to her husband. Notably, her first three works were dedicated to her friend and brother-in-law: Poems and Fancies (1653), Philosophical Fancies (1653), and The World’s Olio (1655) published shortly after his death. Charles passed away in 1654, but William continued to support Margaret’s writing until her death: with a few exceptions, almost all her works after 1655 include either a laudatory poem or a letter of support from William. There is also extant correspondence between Margaret and William from their courtship in 1645, see Section 5. (Research on other extant correspondence is forthcoming.)\n\nBy the 1630s, the brothers were known to be at the vanguard of natural philosophy, and promoted experiments in optics and mechanics, and new research in mathematics. They had a wide network of contacts, including their tutor and protégé Thomas Hobbes, the philosopher Francis Bacon, and the French philosopher Marin Mersenne. Charles also knew the English mathematician and fellow of Royal Society, John Pell, and the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval. The brothers were also in touch with the now less well-known French scholars François Derand and Claude Mydorge.\n\nDuring their exile in in France the brothers became key patrons of the “Newcastle” or “Cavendish” philosophical circle, which brought together English and French philosophers, such as Walter Charleton, René Descartes, Kenelm Digby, Thomas Hobbes, Pierre Gassendi and Marin Mersenne. Through these, the circle had access to an even wider network of scholars. Charles was personally acquainted with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, who in turn corresponded with Descartes and commented on Digby’s views. Descartes would later tutor Queen Christina of Sweden. She and the Dutch scholar Anna Maria van Schurman were in turn in communication with Gassendi and Mersenne. The circle was thus indeed a circle.\n\nImage of William Cavendish forthcoming.\n\nWalter Charleton\n\nMargaret Cavendish met Charleton through the Cavendish brothers, and the three extant letters indicate that they corresponded over an extended period of time (1654, 1663, 1667), both during Cavendish’s exile on the Continent and her later years in England. They also suggest that Charleton was an ardent admirer of her as a person, as well as of her works. The three letters are full of praise and indicate that he knew her works well. It is thanks to Charleton’s persistent lobbying that the Royal Society extended a formal invitation to Margaret to observe one of its sessions. (Mintz, 1952)\n\nWalter Charleton (1620–1707) was a natural philosopher, physician, translator of J.B. Van Helmont, and key member of the “Cavendish” circle in Paris. Through his friendship with Kenelm Digby and acquaintance with Thomas Hobbes, he became a proponent of the new mechanical philosophy. He was instrumental in introducing Pierre Gassendi’s Epicurean natural philosophy to the English speaking audience, through his publication of the Physiologia Epicuro Gassendo Charltoniana(1654). He subsequently became known for a number of works on medical subjects such as human and animal anatomy, and the nature of the humans and animal soul. Some scholars suggest that he exerted important influence on later natural philosophers such as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton.\n\nImage of Walter Charleton forthcoming.\n\nKenelm Digby\n\nThere is one extant thank you letter from Digby to Margaret from 1657. Kenelm Digby (1603-1665) was a natural philosopher and courtier, with a long standing interest in experimental chemistry and biology. His reconversion in 1634 to Roman Catholicism led him to travel in Europe, where he met Marin Mersenne and Thomas Hobbes in 1635-6, with whom he stayed in correspondence. Through Mersenne he was introduced to the works of Descartes, and engaged in a correspondence with him. Digby even traveled to meet Descartes in person in the Netherlands in 1640. In 1641, he finally fled to Paris into political exile, and became the Chancellor of Queen Henrietta Maria. At the time, Margaret Cavendish was her lady in waiting. During his exile in Paris, Digby was one of the key members of the Cavendish circle, and in 1644, he published two treatises on natural philosophy which made him one of the best known natural philosophers of the time: The Nature of Bodies and On the Immortality of Reasonable Souls, which discuss Aristotelianism, atomism and mechanical philosophy. In 1644 he also again met with Descartes. Digby returned to England in 1660, after the Restoration of the monarchy, became one of the founding members of the Royal Society. He continued to pursue his interests in chemistry and biology, corresponded with the great French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, and invented the modern wine bottle.\n\nThomas Hobbes\n\nThere is one extant thank you letter from Hobbes to Margaret from 1661. In the front matter of her Philosophical and Physical Opinions (1655), Cavendish includes ‘An Epiloge to My Philosophical Opinions’, in which she discusses her contact with Hobbes. For a complete transcript see Section 5.4.\n\n“And for Master Hobbes, it is true I have had the like good fortune to see him, and that very often with my Lord at dinner, for I conversing seldom with any strangers, had no other time to see those two famous philosophers; yet I never heard master Hobbes to my best remembrance treat, or discourse of philosophy, nor I never spoke to Master Hobbes twenty words in my life, I cannot say I did not ask him a question, for when I was in London I met him, and told him as truly I was very glad to see him, and asked him if he would please to do me that honour to stay at dinner, but he with great civility refused me, as having some business, which I suppose required his absence.”\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588–1679) was a natural philosopher, mathematician, and is today best known for his materialist philosophical views and authorship of the political treatise The Leviathan (1651). He was a close companion of the Cavendish brothers. In 1608, he became William Cavendish’s tutor and took William on a tour of the Continent where they engaged with many scholars. Through Cavendish, Hobbes also became acquainted with the natural philosopher Francis Bacon and engaged in secretarial work for him. Later, he became William’s assistant and William his patron, and together they pursued interests in optics and mechanics, including an interest in microscopes and telescopes. Hobbes fled to Paris in 1641 for political reasons, and reconnected with the Cavendish brothers in 1645, when they also fled into political exile. It is as part of the Cavendish circle that Margaret had the opportunity to meet Hobbes and learn about his materialist ideas, though there is scholarly debate as to what extent she had any personal contact with him. Hobbes also became a mathematics tutor to the future Charles II from 1647-1648.\n\nAfter the publication of the Leviathan in 1651 Hobbes fell out of favor with the French court in Paris and returned to England. While in England, he published De Corpore (1655) a work which spelled out his natural philosophy and contained a mathematical proof (unsuccessful as it turns out) of squaring the circle. The work provoked a bitter debate with the mathematician John Wallis. Hobbes also engaged in a famous debate with Robert Boyle on the validity of the experimental approach to natural philosophy and the existence of vacuum. He managed to estrange most of the leading natural philosophers of the day and was never, to his dismay, invited to join the Royal Society.\n\nHenry More\n\nThere is one extant thank you letter from More to Margaret from 1663. (For an overview of Henry More, see Section 5.2 of Conway.) In 1665, Margaret sent More a present of her works including Poems and Fancies (1653) and Philosophical Letters (1664), which prompted the extant thank you letter. Scholars often interpret the Philosophical Letters as a pointed attack on the philosophy of Descartes, Hobbes, More and J.B. Van Helmont. More wrote regarding the present to Conway, in his letter from 15 May 1665 (Letter 156 in the Conway Letters, 1992, pg. 237). Some scholars also read the letter as More suggesting – perhaps in jest – that Conway reply to Cavendish and that he did not take Cavendish’s work seriously (Hutton, 2004). Either way, Conway, as far as we know, did not reply to the letter and the two women philosophers did not come into contact. See Section 6.3 for the relevant quote from the letter.\n\nOverview of letter contents\n\nItem\n\nAuthor\n\nDate\n\nPage\n\nContent\n\n29 Digby 9 June 1657 65 Short thank you letter for a present of her works. 32 Hobbes 9 February 1661 67-68 Short thank you letter for a present of her works. 47 More 3rd May 1663 91-93 Short thank you letter for a present of her works. 48 Charleton 3 May 1663 91-93 Thanks Cavendish for present of her works.

Cavendish’s works were no exception and she made frequent use of various kinds of front matter pieces to communicate with her audience.\n\nThe front matter in her works includes numerous items such as dedicatory letters, laudatory poems by her husband, prefaces, letters to readers and friends, and most daringly, addresses to natural philosophers and universities. Cavendish did not have many scholarly interlocutors who were willing to engage with her in a public philosophical debate. Therefore one way to interpret the front matter of her works is as her way of corresponding with eminent scholars and philosophers. The recipients could not refuse Cavendish’s presents of her own works due to her high social rank, and were obliged to acknowledge receipt by means of appropriately polite thank you letters. Some of these can be found in William Cavendish’s A Collection of Letters and Poems Microform (1678).\n\nCavendish wrote a letter to ‘Naturall Philosophers’ in her Poems and Fancies (1653, 1664, 1668); a letter to ‘All Professors of Learning and Art’ in her Sociable Letters (1664); and a letter to ‘The Most Famous University of Cambridge’ in her Philosophical Letters (1664) and in her Observations Upon Experimental Philosophy & The Blazing World (1666, 1668).\n\nFront matter to Philosophical and Physical Opinions\n\nThe front matter of the three printings of her Philosophical and Physical Opinions (PPO) went through revisions. The first publication in 1655 includes a letter to the ‘Two Universities’ of Oxford and Cambridge and a ‘Condemning Treatise of Atomes.’ It also contains a letter from William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, defending the originality of Cavendish’s thought: ‘An Epistle to Justify the Lady Newcastle…’ The second publication in 1663 does not include these pieces, but instead includes ‘A Preface Concerning the Rules of Art, and Explaining the Nature of the Infinite, Together with Some Other Terms, for the Better Understanding of this Philosophical Work.’ The third publication, and second edition of PPO in 1668, renamed Grounds of Natural Philosophy, only contains the boldly titled letter ‘To All the Universities of Europe.’\n\nDedication to the Grounds of Natural Philosophy\n\nA table overview of the front matter in each of Cavendish’s works and their editions is available below. Our team is currently working on a modern transcription of the front matter and research on its interpretation is forthcoming. As a taster, we include here the dedication from the Grounds of Natural Philosophy (1668). Please note that the original source comes from the Early English Books Online database. The dedication was subsequently edited: the spelling and some of the grammar was modernized to make the text more accessible and a pleasure to read.\n\nTO ALL THE UNIVERSITIES IN EUROPE.\n\nMost learned societies,\n\nAll books, without exception, being undoubtedly under your jurisdiction, it is very strange that some authors of good note, are not ashamed to repine at it; and the more forward they are in judging others, the less liberty they will allow to be judged themselves. But, if there was not a necessity, yet I would make it my choice, to submit, willingly, to your censures, these grounds of natural philosophy, in hopes that you will not condemn them, because they want art, if they be found fraught with sense and reason. You are the stars of the first magnitude, whose influence governs the world of learning; and it is my confidence, that you will be propitious to the birth of this beloved child of my brain, whom I take the boldness to recommend to your patronage; and as, if you vouchsafe to look on it favourably, I shall be extremely obliged to your goodness, for its everlasting life: so, if you resolve to frown upon it, I beg the favour, that it be not buried in the hard and rocky grave of your displeasure; but be suffered, by your gentle silence, to lie still in the soft and easy bed of oblivion, which is incomparably the less punishment of the two. It is so commonly the error of indulgent parents, to spoil their children out of fondness, that I may be forgiven for spoiling this, in never putting it to suck at the breast of some learned nurse, whom I might have got from among your students, to have assisted me; but would, obstinately, suckle it myself, and bring it up alone, without the help of any scholar: which having caused in the first edition, (which was published under the name of Philosophical and Physical Opinions) many imperfections; I have endeavoured in this second, by many alterations and additions, (which have forced me to give it another name) to correct them; whereby, I fear, my faults are rather changed and increased, than amended. If you expect fair proportions in the parts, and a beautiful symmetry in the whole, having never been taught at all, and having read but little; I acknowledge my self too illiterate to afford it, and too\n\nimpatient to labour much for method.\n\nBut, if you will be contented with pure wit, and the effects of mere contemplation; I hope, that somewhat of that kind may be found in this book, and in my other philosophical, poetical, and oratorical works: all which I leave, and this especially, to your kind protection, and am,\n\nYour most humble servant, and admirer, Margaret Newcastle.\n\nEditions and their front matter\n\nSource\n\nYear\n\nBrief description of front matter\n\nPoems and Fancies 1653 The Epistle Dedicatory: to Sir Charles Cavendish, my Noble Brother-in-Law.
