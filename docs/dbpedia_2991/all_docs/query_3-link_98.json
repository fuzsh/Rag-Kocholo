        "text": "Why most good churches have Marriage Preparation Courses!\n\nAnd so, John Wesley was married. His strategy for being a good husband was pretty simple: ‘I cannot understand how a Methodist preacher can answer it to God to preach one sermon or travel one day less, in a married than in a single state.’\n\nAt first Molly accompanied him but his travel schedule (by any standard through all church history) was relentless, and she, as a newly married 40 year old woman, was clearly hoping for some normal domestic joys.\n\nOften absent for weeks at a time, Wesley gave his wife permission to open all the mail that came for him. This included many letters from women seeking guidance and counsel, and Molly soon began to feel that some of them had more than a little affection towards her man.\n\nJealousy, slander and insensitivity\n\nHer jealousy increased, as did her sense of being overlooked by him, and even unloved by him. She began to be, not only troubled by but gripped by jealousy.\n\nShe wrote disgruntled, critical, letters to him. She travelled to spy on him. She sent his private papers directly to his enemies that they might slander him. Eventually she publicly and repeatedly accused him of adultery over a period of twenty years.\n\nAt one point, after a fierce exchange of letters, he sent a scathing, hostile, reply.\n\n‘Know me and know yourself. Suspect me no more, asperse me no more, provoke me no more: do not any longer contend for mastery…be content to be a private insignificant person, known and loved by God and me.’\n\nRobert Southey, who quotes this letter, gives more of its contents, ‘He reminded her that she had laid to his charge things that he knew not, robbed him, betrayed his confidence, revealed his secrets, given him a thousand treacherous wounds, and made it her business so to do, under the pretence of vindicating her own character; ‘whereas’, said he, ‘of what importance is your character to mankind? If you were buried just now, or if you had never lived, what loss would it be to the cause of God?’\n\nSouthey adds, ‘There are few stomachs which could bear to have humility administered in such doses.’ (Robert Southey, The Life of John Wesley, Hutchinson, p.266)\n\nDragged along by the hair\n\nOn several occasions she left home, only returning after he begged her repeatedly. Although he had been unspeakably angry with her, he kept aiming at reconciliation.\n\nBut the home life was unhappy. John Hampson of Manchester ‘once entered a room unannounced to find Molly dragging her husband across the floor by his hair.’ (John Pollock, Wesley, Hodder, p.238)\n\nFinally, she left for good. Wesley wryly reported in his journal, ‘I did not forsake her, I did not dismiss her, I will not recall her.’\n\nHe should have consulted with Charles. He should have asked for the wisdom of other leaders. He should have been prepared for marriage. He should have considered his wife’s needs more than his own. In all this, the story of Wesley’s marriage is an unhappy one. But if it is uncomfortable for us to read, let’s not forget that it was far more uncomfortable for him to live. And equally uncomfortable for Molly, who, perhaps was merely hoping to have some of him for herself.\n\nMake sure you read Part One to get the context!\n\nThe Marriage Course\n\nIf you feel you need help in your marriage, The Marriage Course, pioneered at Holy Trinity Church, London may be of help to you. Click here for links to the Course and to find one in your part of the world.\n\nhttp://relationshipcentral.org/\n\nTo read the very first of the sequence of posts about Wesley’s attempts to get a bride click here and follow the links\n\n© 2010 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nLess than three years after his failed engagement to Grace Murray, John Wesley was becoming interested in another potential wife.\n\nUh oh!\n\nHis unwillingness to consult with his brother Charles in this new romance was completely understandable. But, of course, it is exactly what he should have done. His reluctance to take counsel on this vitally important decision was to lead to twenty years of unhappiness both for him, and for his future wife.\n\nIntroducing Molly\n\nMolly Vazeille, widowed for three years, but wealthy, had shown an interest in spiritual things and Wesley wrote to her in 1750.\n\nCharles Wesley and his wife, Sally, already knew Molly and were not impressed. John, however, was impressed and said as much to her in what he probably considered a glowing letter. He said he appreciated her ‘industry’, her ‘exact frugality’ and her ‘uncommon neatness and cleanness.’ She must have been beside herself with delight!\n\nHe was careful to add that this uncommon neatness and cleanness extended to her person, her clothes and to all those things around her!\n\nIt made us all hide our faces\n\nHe merely announced to Charles and Sally his intention to marry. Charles was ‘thunderstruck’ and filled with dread.\n\nAt the next church service John announced that he was to marry Molly Vazeille. Charles, commenting on the response of the congregation, said it ‘made us all hide our faces.’\n\nIn mid-February 1751, just a couple of years after the Grace Murray disaster, John Wesley was married.\n\nTo read the highly popular next installment click here\n\n© 2010 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nIf his attempts to woo the woman he loved seemed rash on the one hand, or boring on the other, things were about to get much, much worse. Although the ‘unofficially together’ couple were companions on a number of speaking tours, with Grace counselling the female society members, there was a major problem: She had already promised to marry someone else!\n\nJohn Bennett, probably Wesley’s most successful itinerant preacher, a committed Calvinist, was also interested and had already exchanged love letters with Grace. He too felt that she had shown him some signs of love. John and Grace continued travelling together, and also with Charles at one point. He had no idea of John’s affection for her, and considered her almost as one of the servants. Grace herself, had not taken Wesley’s former expression of love as binding, or as evidence of an engagement, and so kept up her correspondence with John Bennett.\n\nJohn, John! Put down your book on the Plague of London and win the lady!!\n\nThe Sudden Marriage\n\nWhen John finally revealed his intentions to his brother, Charles was so shocked that he immediately sought to intervene.\n\nThese two men, who along with Whitefield and others, were turning a nation to God, were completely at a loss when it came to women.\n\nCharles had met his bride and John had married them. Surely Charles would now reciprocate! Not at all! When John declared his love for Grace, he was rebuked. To cut a long soap opera story short, without Wesley’s knowledge, quite suddenly and at Charles’ insistence, Grace was married to John Bennett in Newcastle.\n\nWesley’s Deepest Sadness\n\nJohn was understandably upset. At first he refused to meet Charles, but George Whitefield, probably the only person who could, brought them together. They exchanged furious words, as Whitefield wept silently. Finally the two brothers embraced.\n\nMr. and Mrs. John Bennett, the newly married couple, were also brought in that all might be reconciled, but Wesley undoubtedly bore the weight of the reconciliation.\n\nAfter the meeting, alone, in deep sadness, Wesley rode silently away.\n\nFollowing some slanderous comments and a criticism from Bennett, Wesley reacted in a private letter to him:\n\n‘I left with you my dearest friend, one I loved above all on earth, and fully designed for my wife. To this woman you proposed marriage, without either my knowledge or consent…You wrote me word you would take no farther step without my consent but…you tore her from me…\n\nI think you have done me the deepest wrong which I can receive on this side the grave. But I spare you. ‘Tis but for a little time, and I shall be where the weary are at rest.’ (Quoted in John Pollock, Wesley, Hodder, Ch. 21)\n\nTo read how John Wesley finally met and married his wife click here\n\n© 2010 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nLove is in the air!\n\nBy the late 1740’s both John and Charles Wesley’s thoughts turned to marriage. James Hutton, a Methodist leader, wrote at length on the subject to Count Zinzendorf:\n\n‘JW and CW, both of them, are dangerous snares to many young women; several are in love with them. I wish they were married to some good sisters, but I would not give them one of my sisters if I had many…’ (Quoted in John Pollock, Wesley, Hodder, p.190)\n\nCharles was married in 1748 and had, as it happens, a long and happy marriage. Things would work out slightly differently for John.\n\nGrace is in the air!\n\nJohn Wesley had appointed Grace Murray, a Geordie, a new convert, a competent leader and a widow, to oversee the Methodist Orphanage in Newcastle Upon Tyne.\n\nHe was clearly taken with her ability. She was firm, efficient, and, upon his arriving in Newcastle sick on one occasion, wonderfully caring. Surely she was the kind of woman who could be his wife!\n\nAs he recovered, he began to have stronger feelings towards her and, perhaps unwisely, suddenly said to her, ‘If ever I marry, I think you will be the person!’ (ibid. p.192)\n\nShe, understandably, was surprised and impacted by the statement, and, a little stunned, said to John, ‘This is too great a blessing for me! I can’t tell how to believe it! This is all I could have wished for under heaven, if I had dared to wish for it!’\n\nWesley soon recovered from his illness and made plans to travel down to Yorkshire. Grace, being unwilling to so quickly separate from him after their new found love, convinced him to allow her to ride with him part of the journey. Wesley, apparently undistracted by the presence of his new found love, quietly read Hodge’s ‘Account of the Plague in London’ as they travelled silently on.\n\nThe calamities continue. To read the next installment of Wesley’s attempted courtship click here\n\n© 2010 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nCharles Wesley is mainly remembered for his excellent poetic gift. This gift, thoroughly saturated in Scripture, produced some of the church’s best-loved hymns. If you are in an English speaking church context it is quite likely that you recognize these well known opening lines from Charles Wesley hymns:\n\nHark! The herald angels sing,\n\n“Glory to the newborn King;\n\nPeace on earth, and mercy mild,\n\nGod and sinners reconciled!”\n\nLove divine, all loves excelling,\n\nJoy of heaven to earth come down;\n\nFix in us thy humble dwelling;\n\nAll thy faithful mercies crown!\n\nJesus, Thou art all compassion,\n\nPure unbounded love Thou art;\n\nVisit us with Thy salvation;\n\nEnter every trembling heart.\n\nAnd can it be that I should gain\n\nAn interest in the Saviour’s blood?\n\nO for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer’s praise,\n\nThe glories of my God and King,\n\nThe triumphs of His grace!\n\nActually, it’s difficult not to just go ahead and include whole hymns for the pure pleasure of enjoying them.\n\nA Passionate Evangelistic Preacher\n\nBut my point is that Charles Wesley was not only a hymn-writer but also a passionate evangelistic preacher.\n\nLike George Whitefield, his preaching mentor, Wesley also enjoyed great infillings of the Holy Spirit as he preached (see also, Acts 4:7-10).\n\nSome excerpts from his journal of 1741 will give us a flavour of the kind of passion he employed in his efforts to bring men and women to Christ.\n\n‘April 13th. While I was in great love…the Spirit of power came down, the fountain was set open, my mouth and heart enlarged, and I spoke such words as I cannot repeat. Many sunk under the love of Christ crucified…’\n\n‘April 22nd. I sharply reproved three or four inflexible Pharisees; then prayed the Lord to give me words of consolation, and immediately I was filled with power, which broke out as a mighty torrent.\n\n‘All our hearts caught fire in a moment, and such tears and strong cryings followed, as quite drowned my voice…’\n\n‘Sun May 3rd. At Kingswood [Bristol] as soon as I had named my text, ‘It is finished!’ the love of Christ crucified so constrained me that I burst into tears, and felt strong sympathy with him in his sufferings. In like manner, the whole congregation looked upon him whom they had pierced, and mourned.’\n\nHis preaching was effective and many were converted. One particular Kingswood resident wasn’t happy though. Charles wrote:\n\n‘May 5th. A wild collier [coal miner] brought me four of his children…crying, ‘You have got the mother, take the bairns [the kids] too!’ [1]\n\nAn Inspiring combination of the Poet and the Evangelist\n\nCharles Wesley was an Evangelist, and an effective one at that. We’ll return to his heroic story later, but for now, let’s not forget that many of his hymns were written in the very context of urging his generation to come to Christ.\n\nHis hymn ‘Lovers of Pleasure’ provides us with an excellent example of the combination of his poetic and evangelistic gift. Enjoy!\n\n‘Lovers of pleasure more than God,\n\nFor you He suffered pain;\n\nSwearers, for you He spilt his blood;\n\nAnd shall He bleed in vain?\n\nMisers, for you his life He paid,\n\nYour basest crime He bore:\n\nDrunkards, your sins on Him were laid,\n\nThat you might sin no more.\n\nThe God of love, to earth He came,\n\nThat you might come to heaven;\n\nBelieve, believe in Jesus’ Name,\n\nAnd all your sin’s forgiven.\n\nBelieve in Him that died for thee,\n\nAnd, sure as He hath died,\n\nThy debt is paid, Thy soul is free,\n\nAnd thou art justified.’\n\nFor more on the hymns of Charles Wesley and other Methodists see, ‘A Collection of hymns for use by the people called Methodists’)\n\nTo read about the life-changing conversion experiences of the Wesley brothers click here\n\n[1] All quotes from Arnold Dallimore, Charles Wesley, A Heart Set Free, Crossway Books, p.107\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nPart Three (see Part One and Part Two)\n\nIn the autumn of 1740, English Evangelist George Whitefield finally met the man he had so respected, Jonathan Edwards. Both these men were Reformed, (or, ‘Calvinistic’) in their theology and practice, preaching the gospel fervently and trusting God to move the people to respond.\n\nWhitefield had already blazed a trail of powerful evangelistic work in England, Scotland and Wales and had seen multiple thousands gathered to hear the message of Jesus Christ.\n\nJohn Wesley, his brother Charles and a small army of newly converted leaders had taken up the movement in Britain and were not only continuing to proclaim the message to the unconverted but were gathering the new converts into small groups (classes) and mid-week congregations (or ‘societies’ as they called them).\n\nWhitefield’s fame was now legendary, and his visits to colonial America had already been wildly successful. He had been born again only 5 years previously and was just 25 years old. Jonathan Edwards had been eager to meet him and to have him preach in the church he pastored in Northampton, New England.\n\nJonathan Edwards on George Whitefield’s Visit\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Prince, Edwards described the impact of Whitefield’s visit:\n\n‘He preached here four sermons in the meeting-house (besides a private lecture at my house) – one on Friday, another on Saturday, and two upon the Sabbath.\n\n‘The congregation was extraordinarily melted by every sermon; almost the whole assembly being in tears for a great part of sermon time.\n\n‘Mr. Whitefield’s sermons were suitable to the circumstances of the town, containing just reproofs of our backslidings, and, in a most moving and affecting manner, making use of our great profession and great mercies as arguments with us to return to God, from whom we had departed.\n\n‘Immediately after this, the minds of the people in general appeared more engaged in religion, showing a greater forwardness to make religion the subject of their conversation, and to meet frequently together for religious purposes, and to embrace all opportunities to hear the Word preached.\n\n‘The revival at first appeared chiefly among professors and those that had entertained the hope that they were in a state of grace, to whom Mr. Whitefield chiefly addressed himself.\n\n‘But in a very short time there appeared an awakening and deep concern among some young persons that looked upon themselves as in a Christless state; and there were some hopeful appearances of conversion; and some professors were greatly revived.\n\n‘In about a month or six weeks, there was a great alteration in the town, both as to the revivals of professors and awakenings of others.’ (Letters and Personal Writings (WJE Online Vol. 16) at the Jonathan Edwards Center, Yale University)\n\nIt’s great to see how God raised up an itinerating Evangelist to help a Pastor who was seeking to impact his town with the gospel. Their friendship and mutual respect continued for the rest of their lives.\n\nTo read George Whitefield’s remarkable comments on Jonathan and Sarah Edwards’ family life go here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nIt might be a little unusual, these days, to send a poem to one of your colleagues. But Charles Wesley was quite a poet, and George Whitefield was quite a preacher!\n\nA Song for the Mission\n\nWhitefield’s plan, as we’ve seen, was to get back across to America. He wanted to preach the gospel there and was raising funds to establish an orphanage in Georgia.\n\nOn the eve of his second trip, Charles Wesley sent him what must have been a real encouragement in the form of a kind of hymn.\n\nI include it here for a few reasons:\n\nFirstly, as an example of how poetry can express our joy and sense of purpose in the mission.\n\nSecondly, to demonstrate the warmth of feeling between the Wesley brothers and Whitefield at this time.\n\nAnd thirdly, as an encouragement to anyone reading who is seeking to communicate the gospel to others, or who is about to launch into a new season of ministry.\n\nSimple Outline\n\nEssentially, Wesley is saying, ‘You’ve been called by God to go, so be obedient and stand firm in the whole armour of God’. He is referring to Ephesians 6:10-18. He then goes through each piece of the armour with great poetic skill. Having reminded Whitefield of the armour he is wearing and will be wearing, he exhorts him to preach boldly as a champion even if it means suffering and (gulp) ultimately martyrdom!\n\nActually, Whitefield did eventually die in America (several years later), though not as a result of persecution, but exhaustion.\n\nBut, enough from me…back to Charles Wesley!\n\nTo the Reverend George Whitefield\n\nServant of God, the summons hear,\n\nThy master calls, arise, obey!\n\nThe tokens of His will appear,\n\nHis providence points out thy way.\n\nLo! we commend thee to His grace!\n\nIn confidence go forth, be strong!\n\nThey meat His will, thy boast His praise,\n\nHis righteousness be all thy song.\n\nStrong in the Lord’s Almighty power,\n\nAnd armed in panoply divine,\n\nFirm may’st thou stand in danger’s hour,\n\nAnd prove the strength of Jesus thine.\n\nThy breast-plate be His righteousness,\n\nHis sacred truth thy loins surround;\n\nShod be thy beauteous feet with peace,\n\nSpring forth, and spread the Gospel sound.\n\nFight the good fight, and stand secure\n\nIn faith’s impenetrable shield;\n\nHell’s prince shall tremble at its power,\n\nWith all his fiery darts repelled.\n\nPrevent thy foes, nor wait their charge,\n\nBut call their ling’ring battle on.\n\nBut strongly grasp thy sevenfold targe, (‘shield’)\n\nAnd bear the world, and Satan down.\n\nThe helmet of salvation take,\n\nThe Lord’s, the Spirit’s conquering sword,\n\nSpeak from the Word – in lightning speak,\n\nCry out, and thunder – from the Word.\n\nChampion of God, thy Lord proclaim,\n\nJesus alone, resolve to know;\n\nTread down thy foes in Jesus’ name:\n\nGo – conquering, and to conquer go.\n\nThrough racks and fires pursue thy way,\n\nBe mindful of a dying God;\n\nFinish thy course and win the day;\n\nLook up – and seal the truth with blood.\n\nCharles Wesley\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nCommitted to Changing the World\n\nFrom 1739 onwards Whitefield, both Wesley brothers, Howell Harris and an increasing army of young men began preaching the gospel outdoors to multitudes.\n\nWesley, with superior organizational skills than Whitefield, took charge of the societies and formed new ones, drawing Whitefield’s converts into regular fellowship and accountability.\n\nWhitefield also formed many societies but was more passionate about preaching the gospel to the crowds. With his commitment to preach in America he effectively gave complete charge of the English societies to Wesley.\n\nPretty but Powerless\n\nBut from the earliest days of the outpouring of the Spirit to the end of their lives these leaders kept a clear focus on bringing those outside of church life to Christ.\n\nEven as late as 1774 when Wesley was preaching in Glasgow he couldn’t help but be frustrated at the failure of preachers who ignored the unbeliever.\n\nWriting of two church services he attended there he declared that the sermons ‘contained much truth, but were no more likely to awaken one soul than an Italian opera.’ (Quoted by Mark Noll, The Rise of Evangelicalism, IVP, p.106)\n\nThe tragedy of evangelistically irrelevant sermons is not that there is nothing there which delights the believer but nothing that can rescue the nonbeliever.\n\nThe sooner we recognise this deficiency and follow the example of men like Whitefield and the Wesley’s the closer we shall be to seeing the gospel triumph in our communities.\n\nTo read about CH Spurgeon’s view on this subject click here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nIn November 1738 the 24 year old George Whitefield returned to Great Britain from his first trip to America. It had been a great success.\n\nWhen he arrived in London he attended a meeting in Fetter Lane. On December 8th he records, ‘In the evening went to a truly Christian Society in Fetter Lane, and perceived God had greatly watered the seed sown by my ministry when last in London. The Lord increase it more and more.’ [i]\n\nIndeed the Awakening was moving forward quickly.\n\nChristmas Day with George Whitefield\n\nWhitefield preached very early that Christmas morning, 1738. ‘About four this morning, went and prayed and expounded to another Society in Redcross Street, consisting of near two or three hundred people and the room was exceedingly hot. I had been watching unto prayer all night, yet God vouchsafed so to fill me with His blessed Spirit that I spoke with as great power as ever I did in my life.’ [ii]\n\nBut it was New Year’s Eve which was perhaps the most significant meeting for many of the leaders of the Awakening. Whitefield merely records it as another great time of prayer, but Wesley, who was still catching up with Whitefield’s spirituality, gives us more detail and was clearly impacted by what happened:\n\nA famous New Year’s Party!\n\n‘Mon. Jan. 1, 1739 – Mr. Hall, Kinchin, Ingham, Whitefield, Hutchins, and my brother Charles, were present at out love-feast in Fetter Lane, with about sixty of our brethren.\n\nAbout three in the morning, as we were continuing instant in prayer, the power of God came mightily upon us, insomuch that many cried our for exceeding joy, and many fell to the ground.\n\nAs soon as we were recovered a little from that awe and amazement at the presence of his Majesty, we broke out with one voice, ‘We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.’ [iii]\n\nWhitefield, writing of the same occasion, said, ‘O that our despisers were partakers of our joys!’ And looking back on that brief season after returning from America, as friends gathered in London to pray, he wrote:\n\nNew wine!\n\n‘Sometimes whole nights were spent in prayer. Often have we been filled as with new wine. And often have we seen them overwhelmed with the divine presence and crying out, ‘Will God indeed dwell with men upon earth? How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God and the gate of heaven!’ [iv]\n\nThis amazing season of prayer, and this company of sixty, mainly young men would usher in a new day for the British Isles. Something massive was about to break into the culture.\n\nFor a famous incident in Bristol, where the blackened faces of coal miners were whitened by their tears click here\n\n[i] George Whitefield’s Journal, Edinburgh: Banner of Truth, 1981, p.194\n\n[ii] ibid\n\n[iii] John Wesley Journals (Baker Edition), p.140\n\n[iv] John Gillies, Memoirs of the Life of George Whitefield, p.34\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nBefore we approach the momentous prayer meeting of January 1st 1739 let’s enjoy a glimpse into the highly charismatic and evangelistic nature of some key players in the Great Awakening of the 18th century.\n\nWhat were these men really like? Were they as reserved as we sometimes imagine? Or were they on fire for God and eager to create evangelistic opportunities?\n\nOf course, by inference, I am asking the question: ‘How ‘normal’ are we in comparison?’\n\nBelow are merely snippets without background info, but we still gain some insight into the freedom and power they enjoyed.\n\nCharles Wesley\n\n‘In the coach to London I preached faith in Christ. A lady was extremely offended; avowed her merits in plain terms; asked if I was not a Methodist; threatened to beat me.\n\nI declared I deserved nothing but hell; so did she; and must confess it before she could have a title to heaven. This was most intolerable to her.’ (Charles Wesley Journal Vol 1, quoted by Dallimore, Charles Wesley, A heart set free, Crossway, p.68)\n\n‘My inward temptations are, in a manner, uninterrupted. I never knew the energy of sin, till now that I experience the superior strength of Christ.’ (ibid, p.69)\n\n‘In riding to Blenton, I was full of delight, and seemed in new heavens and new earth. We prayed and sang, and shouted all the way!’ (ibid, p.69)\n\nHowell Harris\n\n‘My food and drink was praising my God. A fire was kindled in my soul, and I was clothed with power, and made altogether dead to earthly things…\n\n‘I lifted up my voice with authority, and fear and terror would be seen on all faces…I thundered greatly, denouncing the gentry, the carnal clergy and everybody!’ (ibid, p.77)\n\nGeorge Whitefield\n\n‘[January 1738 At] Deal I preached to a weeping and thronged congregation…the Clerk pronounced a loud ‘Amen’ to every person who received either bread or wine, an excellent custom, and worthy in my opinon to be imitated in all churches. After this, I and my friends went on our way rejoicing….\n\n‘In the afternoon preached at Upper Deal. The church was quite crowded and many went away for want of room; some stood on the leads of the church outside, and looked in at the top windows, and all seemed eager to hear the Word of God.’ (GW Journal, Banner of Truth edition, p.117)\n\n‘In the evening, such numbers came to hear me that I was obliged to divide them into four companies, and God enabled me to expound to them from six till ten [that’s four hours of preaching on the trot!].\n\nSome would have persuaded me to have dismissed the last company [who had been waiting 3 hours!!] without expounding, but I could not bear to let so many go empty away. I find the more we do for God, the more we may. My strength held out surprisingly, and I was but little, if at all fatigued.’ (GW Journal, p.118)\n\nJohn Wesley\n\n(In a letter responding to a critic of the sometimes uncontrolled behaviour of those who were converted in the evangelistic meetings)\n\n‘’You deny that God does now work these effects: at least, that he works them in this manner. I affirm both; because I have herd those things with my own ears, and have seen them with my eyes.\n\nI have seen (as far as a thing of this kind can be seen) very many persons changed in a moment from the spirit of fear, horror, despair, to the spirit of love, joy and peace; and from sinful desire, till then reigning over them, to a pure desire of doing the will of God…\n\nI have known several persons in whom this great change was wrought in a dream, or during a strong representation to the eye of their mind, of Christ either on the cross, or in glory…\n\nAnd that such a change was then wrought, appears (not from their shedding tears only, or falling into fits, or crying out: these are not the fruits, as you seem to suppose, whereby I judge, but) from the whole tenor of their life, till then, many ways wicked; from that time, holy, just and good.’ (JW Journals Vol 1, p.195 Baker Edition)\n\nThis response, incidentally, is remarkably similar to Jonathan Edwards when he was also called upon to account for the highly emotional or demonstrative aspects of his meetings. See here for more information.\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nWe’ve been spending some time looking at the conversion experience of the Welsh Evangelist Howell Harris.\n\nHarris, through his tireless evangelistic work is credited with being the founder of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism. He also, through his example, helped launch George Whitefield and the Wesley brothers’ ministry of preaching in the fields.\n\nMartyn Lloyd-Jones (also a Welshman) spoke about him at the Puritan Conference in London in 1973 and emphasised not only Harris’ conversion but also the fact that he received ‘a baptism of power’ in the Holy Spirit. Lloyd-Jones believed this was the key to his evangelistic success.\n\nIndeed, thousands came to Christ. The power of the Spirit in Harris’ life affected not only his willingness to speak but also his effectiveness in speaking. He talked about ‘the authority’ of God coming upon him and moving the hearers. He would wait for the ‘authority’ to come and then speak with greater freedom and power.\n\nLloyd-Jones last sermon\n\nLloyd-Jones also was deeply concerned for this subjective but vital aspect in his own preaching. The preached word was to come with authority.\n\nI have friends who were at Barcombe Baptist Chapel, in East Sussex and heard Lloyd-Jones deliver his very last sermon. One told me how the Doctor started slowly and seemed to get going with some difficulty. But then, wondrously, it was as though a sudden power came upon him, that energised him and electrified the congregation. Suddenly all were awake and alert: God was speaking with authority through a man. Lloyd-Jones felt that in Harris’ case (where he would sense ‘the authority’ and then speak spontaneously without any notes or preparation and with powerful effect) it was close to the gift of prophecy in 1 Corinthians 12.\n\nA first-hand gospel\n\nFor Harris, as well as Lloyd-Jones, this was a deeply prized token of God’s presence and favour both for him and his hearers. It had the effect of making the gospel ‘first-hand’, fresh, and immediately powerful.\n\nHarris, describes this immediacy. He was more concerned with preaching an experienced Christ and the Spirit enabled him to do so: ‘That which I experienced, proved, and felt and saw and heard of the Word of Life, that also I proclaim.’ (quoted by MLJ in Lloyd-Jones, The Puritans and their Successors, Banner of Truth Edition p.296)\n\nA bold man dies much loved by the people he served\n\nWales mourned when Harris died. A truly great and much loved hero had gone to glory. 20,000 people were present! The Countess of Huntingdon attended and wrote of the emotion that was too strong to suppress:\n\n‘But amidst the sorrow and tears of the audience that thronged the building an interruption took place. The officiating clergyman, being unable to proceed on account of his emotion, handed the Prayer Book to another – that does not often happen – but the second clergyman also lost self-control and passed the book to a third, when he again by reason of the same cause was unable to go on; and thus in silence were the remains of the great man laid to rest in the chancel in the Parish Church at Talgarth, and in the same grave in which his wife had been buried a few years before’. (quoted by MLJ, ibid, p.301)\n\nWhat about us?\n\nOh my dear friend, are you a Christian? Then go to God and be filled with the Holy Spirit. If you need to find a church near you try here as one option.\n\nHave you been baptised in the Spirit? Why did you think it was just for you? There are multitudes all around you who do not know Christ. Are you going to leave them as you travel on your way to heaven? Are you not going to be stirred by God to get up and do something for Him that will help people find their way to Christ?\n\nHow long O Lord, before you pour out your Spirit once more upon your people and turn our nations to you?\n\nTo read part one of Lloyd-Jones on Howell Harris click here\n\nTo read the next post in this series click here\n\nYou can purchase ‘The Puritans: Their Origins and Successors’ here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nThe disappointing ‘missionary’ attempt by the Wesley brothers to serve God in America made them realise they themselves were in real need of salvation (see, John Wesley: the non-Christian).\n\nCharles, the First!\n\nCharles was the first to experience the new birth, the main topic about which Whitefield was now preaching. He heard Whitefield in London and records at the time, ‘Mr Whitefield [preaches] not with persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and with power. The churches will not contain the multitudes that throng to hear him,’ (Charles Wesley Journals, Vol 1. P.79 Baker)\n\nThe brothers had been impressed with the faith of the Moravians on board ship during a storm, and John had received a surprise grilling by the Moravian leader, Augustus Spangenberg, in America. Following these encounters they began seeking them out once they had returned to England.\n\nThe Moravian Peter Bohler was leading a regular meeting in London’s Fetter Lane. Dallimore writes, ‘Charles and John were in almost daily contact with Bohler.’\n\nHe asked Charles ‘Do you hope to be saved? He replied, ‘I do!’\n\n‘For what reason do you hope it?’ ‘Because I have used my best endeavours to serve God.’\n\nCharles reports, ‘He shook his head, and said no more. I thought him very uncharitable, saying in my heart, ‘What, are not my endeavours sufficient ground of hope? Would he rob me of my endeavours? I have nothing else to trust to.’ (Arnold Dallimore, Charles Wesley, Crossway, p.58-59)\n\nPower on Pentecost Sunday\n\nCharles had discovered the vital doctrine of justification by faith in Christ alone as he read Martin Luther’s commentary on Galatians.\n\n‘21 May was Pentecost Sunday…[and] the day of Charles Wesley’s conversion.’ Charles said he felt the Spirit of God striving with his spirit ‘till by degrees He chased away the darkness of my unbelief. I found myself convinced…I now found myself at peace with God, and rejoiced in hope of loving Christ.’\n\nJohn, in his Journal records on that day, ‘I received the surprising news that my brother had found rest to his soul.’\n\nIndeed, Charles wrote: ‘I was in a new heaven and a new earth!’ (See Dallimore, p.61-62)\n\nJohn Wesley’s ‘heart strangely warmed’\n\nFinally, three days later, at one of the Moravian meetings in Aldersgate Street, John Wesley got his breakthrough. He had already discussed Justification by faith with Peter Bohler, but this was different.\n\nAt 34 years of age (more than ten years older than Whitefield) he was finally born again.\n\nHe wrote in his journal:\n\n‘In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther’s preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed.\n\nI felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation; and an assurance was given to me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.’ (John Wesley Journal, May 24th 1738, Vol. 1. p.103)\n\nAfter this Wesley followed Whitefield’s example and began preaching both justification by faith and the new birth in the churches. And one by one, the Anglican church leaders resisted him. (see here for further examples of Wesley following Whitefield’s example)\n\nIt wasn’t long before these newly converted ‘Methodists’, George Whitefield and John and Charles Wesley, began to gather others together to seek God for greater blessings.\n\n1739 was approaching, and little did these men know what a significant year it was to be!\n\nTo read something of the amazing influence of the Wesleys click here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nIn 1738, three years after Whitefield’s conversion, the Wesley brothers returned from a disastrous ‘missionary’ attempt in America. John Wesley later acknowledged that while he had gone to America to convert the Indians, it was he himself that needed to get converted.\n\nStorms at Sea\n\nGod used various circumstances to unsettle the strong headed John Wesley and show him that he was not saved. During the outward bound voyage a terrible storm arose, smashing the ship and frightening both passengers and crew, except the Moravian Christians.\n\n‘In the midst of the psalm wherewith their service began, the sea broke over, split the main sail in pieces, covered the ship, and poured in upon the decks, as if the great deep had already swallowed us up. A terrible screaming began among the English. The Germans calmly sung on…’ [1]\n\nWesley was petrified by the enormity of the storm and the reality of death. Afterwards he asked one of the Germans whether they were afraid.\n\n‘No!’ the Moravian church planter replied.\n\nWesley asked about the women and children. Surely they were afraid.\n\n‘Our women are not afraid to die!’\n\nStorms on Land\n\nWhen the brothers got to America they were not popular. Their strict legalism was at first, a curiosity and later, an irritation, to the settlers. Wesley arranged a meeting with the Moravian leader, Spangenberg, who had already lived there a year. He had plenty of questions for the Moravian leader about the colony. However, Spangenberg, having listened carefully to Wesley, felt he needed to ask a few:\n\n‘Do you know yourself?’ he asked.\n\n‘Have you the witness in yourself? Does the spirit of God bear witness with your spirit that you are a child of God?’ Hmmm….Wesley hesitated.\n\nFinally, Spangenberg asked, ‘Do you know Jesus Christ?’\n\nJohn Pollock writes, ‘Wesley paused in some confusion, then replied lamely, ‘I know he is the Saviour of the world.’\n\n‘True, said the German, ‘but do you know he has saved you?’ Wesley replied uncomfortably, ‘I hope he has died to save me!’\n\nAgain Spangenberg pressed the question, ‘Do you know, yourself?’\n\nWesley replied, ‘I do!’\n\n‘But I fear they were vain words’ he wrote later.[2]\n\nStorms in Love\n\nBut his internal problems quickly became external ones! The worst of it was when John, seeking to win the hand of the pretty Sophy Hopkey, was shocked to discover that another man had asked for her hand in marriage. And, in direct contradiction to the encouraging signs Wesley felt he had received, Sophy married him.\n\nWhatever the details, the conclusion was that he barred her from taking communion – a public humiliation – and was then pursued for defamation of character by the husband.\n\nHe was also attacked by another of the young wives there. Pollock records that a certain Mrs. Hawkins became convinced that Wesley had slandered her. She invited him to her home where she ‘threatened to shoot him, then set upon him with a pair of scissors; she swore at him, tore his cossack, and threw him on to her bed where she cut off one side of his long hair.’ The shocked and humbled Wesley was finally rescued by the husband and servants. Pollock adds, ‘the story of the little parson’s adventures was soon all over the colony.’ One congregant was particularly amused to watch Wesley in the pulpit and recorded that he preached ‘with his hair so long on one side, so short on the other’! [3]\n\nFinally, the controversy surrounding Sophy Hopkins grew to such an extent that John and Charles fled back to England. And although, he is remembered as one who used phrase ‘The whole world is my parish’, John never returned to America.\n\nFinally, both brothers were now more convinced than ever that they needed to get right with God themselves, before trying to sort others out.\n\n[1] John Wesley, Journals Vol 1, p.22, 1872 edition reprinted by Baker\n\n[2] John Pollock, John Wesley, Hodder, p.68-69\n\n[3] Pollock p.73-74\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides / Church History Review\n\nSo George Whitefield, merely months before becoming one of England’s youngest and most popular preachers, discovers that he needs to be born again in order to get right with God. He discovers that spiritual life is imparted by God through faith.\n\nBut strangely, he then acts in the opposite direction – throwing himself into a round of even more exacting religious exercises and good works, desperately trying to appease God.\n\nSelf-denial, satanic oppression, sickness and scaring Charles Wesley!\n\nHe increases his fasts, he stops eating fruit, giving the money he would have spent to the poor, he goes outside in rain and storm to cry out to God and confess his sinfulness.\n\nRather than finding relief from any of these exercises he becomes even more disconsolate, fearful and insecure. Feeling himself to be horribly oppressed by the devil he finally decides to ‘forsake’ all, including his new friends and stays in his study for days on end. He becomes physically ill and his tutor sends a physician.\n\nHis gloomy, depressed demeanour, the terrible loss of weight, all of this alarms the other students.\n\nCharles Wesley is way out of his depth, doesn’t know what to do, and so refers him to his older brother John (already in his thirties, clearly the leader by this time, but not yet converted).\n\nJohn painstakingly talks George down from the extremity of legalism in which he is bound and gives him Thomas a Kempis to read. Perhaps John realises even at this point that the strictness of the lifestyle he is promoting, the intensity of examination of every moment, is not working.\n\nLocked in the second half of Romans 7\n\nGeorge seemed to have been caged in experience into what Paul merely illustrates in Romans 7:7-25.\n\nThere, Paul illustrates the inability of the Law to produce freedom from sin. Life is in the Gospel not in the Law. George Whitefield, having been awakened to the rightness of God’s Commands, then went on to try and justify himself through religious duty to fulfill those Commands. But Paul clearly demonstrates that the Law cannot produce life – only Christ can.\n\nBut, as in Paul’s illustration, so in real life, and as Whitefield was about to experience – the bondage of the cycle of sin and death is broken only by the Gospel of Jesus Christ!\n\nFinally the breakthrough\n\nWhitefield had come to that great pre-conversion cry, ‘Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me?’ (Rom 7:24)\n\nIn his Journal he records, ‘God was pleased to set me free in the following manner. One day, perceiving an uncommon drought and a disagreeable clamminess in my mouth and using things to allay my thirst, but in vain, it was suggested to me, that when Jesus Christ cried out, ‘I thirst!’ His sufferings were near at an end. Upon which I cast myself down on the bed, crying out, ‘I thirst! I thirst!’’\n\nFrom Mourning to Dancing\n\nAlthough it seems a small thing – to be desperately thirsty, and to somehow see that when Christ cried out that He thirsted, it was near the end of His anguish – yet, here’s the point, when George Whitefield cried out to God, God intervened and heard him.\n\n‘Soon after this’, writes George, ‘I found and felt in myself that I was delivered from the burden that had so heavily oppressed me. The spirit of mourning was taken from me and I knew what it was truly to rejoice in God my Saviour; and, for some time, could not avoid singing psalms wherever I was…’\n\n‘Thus were the days of my mourning ended. After a long night of desertion and temptation, the Star, which I had seen at a distance before [referring to the doctrine of the New Birth in Scougal’s book], began to appear again, and the Day Star arose in my heart.\n\nNow did the Spirit of God take possession of my soul, and, as I humbly hope, seal me unto the day of redemption.’ (GW Journals, Banner of Truth, p.58)\n\nWell, he had wrestled and struggled and, at last, discovered God’s free and Sovereign grace. Being now certain of the new birth in his own experience he began to proclaim the message of it to the English speaking world.\n\nTo read more about Whitefield click here\n\nTo read the first part of Whitefield’s story click here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nWhile George Whitefield was doing menial tasks for the richer students at Oxford University, his own interests became intensely focussed.\n\nHe discovered that his experience in the ‘public house was now of service to me’, in that he was able to serve others diligently and humbly. Yet he could not throw in his lot with the other servitors, whom he felt would become a bad influence on him.\n\nHe was aiming for higher things.\n\nReligion vs. Being Born Again\n\nHe began to read the books that Charles Wesley, his new friend, lent him. One small volume had a real impact on him, Henry Scougal’s ‘The Life of God in the Soul of Man.’ (see Piper on Scougal)\n\nWhitefield realised that, to get right with God, he needed to be born again, not merely to increase his religious efforts.\n\n‘At my first reading it, I wondered what the author meant by saying, ‘That some falsely placed religion in going to church, doing hurt to no one, being constant in the duties of the closet [ie. private prayer], and now and then reaching out their hands to give alms to their poor neighbours.’\n\n‘Alas!’ though I, ‘if this be not true religion, what is?’\n\nAn inward change of heart was needed. What Scougal called, the ‘union of the soul with God, and Christ formed within us.’ Whitefield writes, ‘a ray of Divine light was instantaneously darted in upon my soul, and from that moment…did I know that I must be a new creature.’ (GW Journals, Banner of Truth, p.47)\n\nA pre-evangelistic flurry!\n\nAt last he’d seen it! Not religious duty, but the life of God coming and changing us! And he immediately began communicating it to others even though he had not yet experienced it himself!\n\nWhitefield realised that the New Birth was absolutely central for an individual’s relationship to God and for any hope of getting to heaven. It was a clear-as-day revelation to him – and it was to become the pivotal emphasis in his preaching.\n\nThe New Birth not a New Teaching\n\nThis doctrine of the New Birth didn’t begin with Whitefield, of course, nor with Henry Scougal.\n\nIn John’s Gospel we’re told that a highly religious man, Nicodemus visited Jesus one evening to ask him questions. Nicodemus was a well known teacher, and was a respected authority on Scripture.\n\nYet Jesus cuts across Nicodemus’ expectations by telling him, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”\n\nFaith Comes to Life\n\nThe new birth is, as Whitefield discovered, an inner work of God. As you learn more about Jesus Christ, on hearing about His perfect life, His sacrificial death on the cross and His resurrection from the dead – faith is aroused! Faith that perhaps wasn’t there before!\n\nAs it begins to dawn on you that Jesus truly and specifically died on the cross for your sins, to forgive you of every one, and present you before God as holy – faith is aroused, and springs up!\n\nThis faith, as it comes alive causes a desire for Christ and for His forgiveness. We find ourselves being drawn to God! We long for His forgiveness and for His purposes in our lives. We are willing to turn from sin and live for Him.\n\nMy friend, you can discover right now what George Whitefield discovered hundreds of years ago: that God loves you deeply, that He is willing to forgive your sins, and bring you home to Himself. You can have a brand new start and come into a right relationship with God today.\n\nWhy don’t you ask God to turn you around and make you into a follower of Jesus Christ?\n\nYou’ll need to find a church.

Whitefield was born at the Bell Inn, Gloucester, where his father was the landlord.\n\nTragically, when George was only two, his father died. His mother struggled to keep the Inn going. She re-married, but things didn’t go well. At one point George missed a year of school to help his mother run the Inn.\n\nShe was determined to get George a good education, put him back into school and discovered a means of getting him to Oxford University, to prepare him for a clerical position. As biographer John Pollock puts it, ‘his mother wormed an Oxford servitorship out of an influential friend.’ (John Pollock, George Whitefield and the Great Awakening, Lion, p.6)\n\nA servitorship enabled a poorer student to study at Oxford University by working as a servant to fee paying students.\n\nOxford\n\nOnce Whitefield got to Oxford he became aware of an eccentric group of students who went by the nick-name of ‘The Holy Club’. They were also mocked as ‘methodists’ because of their strict lifestyle. Whitefield knew that they were trying to save their souls by being good and by doing good.\n\nHe was afraid to approach them, feeling his inferiority as a servitor. Yet he was drawn to them. They seemed serious and courageous.\n\nThe closest he dare come to them was to attend a midweek church service, which was considered unusual for any except the most devout.\n\nOne of the notorious ‘Holy Club’ men, the tender hearted Charles Wesley noticed him and invited him to breakfast. Whitefield was overjoyed and returned from the breakfast with a small collection of books. But more importantly, he had received a precious invitation to the next meeting of the Holy Club.\n\nTo read more about Whitefield click here\n\nTo read the first part of the life of Whitefield click here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides\n\nCan a nation be born in a day?\n\nLow church attendance, binge drinking, poor housing, violent crime, limited Christian impact. It looked like Christianity was in trouble.\n\nAt the beginning of 18th Century Britain, confidence in the old faith was in serious decline.\n\n‘God is not Great’ circa 1700\n\nAmongst scholars belief in the miraculous elements of the Christian faith were considered superstitious. ‘Christianity Not Mysterious’ (1696) by John Toland, a leading Deist, represented the only serious intellectual position of that period. Perhaps mild by today’s standards, at the time it represented a new departure.\n\nIt is interesting to note that such publications seem to precede a sudden, sweeping and unexpected moves of God’s grace. Could it be that God Himself seeks to vindicate His own glory? Can God be provoked?\n\nNow that we’ve had ‘The God Delusion’ (Richard Dawkins) and ‘God is not Great’ (Christopher Hitchens), could we also suddenly find ourselves in a fresh era of power and Christian influence, where God’s Spirit seems to be poured out more effectively, more powerfully and with greater impact than we’ve seen before?\n\nChurch Influence and Attendance in Decline\n\nAs Deist and Rationalist ideas gained ground across the leadership of the church in the early 1700’s both the spiritual and moral impact of Christianity began to wane.\n\nChurch attendance began to fall rapidly and churches began to be reorganised and scaled down.\n\nBinge Drinking\n\nThe infamous ‘Gin Craze’, spurred on by the prohibition of imported liquor, swept the nation as multitudes took to making their own gin and created a genuine national crisis. Alcoholism was common.\n\nSocial and Economic Crisis – Poverty and Violent Crime\n\nThe former restraints of the Puritan era were being thrown off with relative ease. Living conditions for many were squalid. The slums were a breeding ground for disease as well as violent crime and the meagre efforts of churches, religious organisations and Parliament made very little impact.\n\nThe general view of the Christian faith was summed up by Bishop Butler who, in 1738 asserted that Christianity was treated as though ‘it was now discovered to be fictitious…and nothing remained but to set it up as the subject of mirth and ridicule (Quoted by Arnold Dallimore, George Whitefield, vol 1, Banner of Truth, p.31)\n\nA Brand Plucked from the Fire!\n\nWhat the good Bishop failed to take into account was that three years previously a young man called George Whitefield had been born again. He had begun preaching the gospel with a fervency that hadn’t been heard since the days of John Bunyan.\n\nAlso, in the very year in which Butler lamented the loss of Christian influence in England, two brothers had finally humbled themselves, followed in Whitefield’s footsteps, and given their lives to Christ, John and Charles Wesley.\n\nYou can purchase Dallimore’s biography of Whitefield here\n\n© 2009 Lex Loizides"
