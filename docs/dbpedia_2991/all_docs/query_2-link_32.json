        "text": "Of all the technical and scientific developments that made possible the European maritime expansion, the nautical chart is perhaps the least studied and understood. This fact is very surprising as it was with the information contained in those charts, and later imported to geographical maps and atlases, that the newly discovered lands were first shown to the European nations. There was, however, a deep incompatibility between these two cartographic paradigms—the nautical charts and the geographical maps—which remained unsolved throughout the sixteenth century and beyond, despite the attempts to harmonize the technical principles of Ptolemy’s Geography with the advances of nautical cartography. An eloquent symptom of such incompatibility was the difference between what was understood as an accurate depiction of the Earth, in the eyes of cosmographers and geographers, and what was considered by the pilots as an accurate nautical chart. The misunderstandings around these issues during the early modern period and the unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation were, in great part, the cause for some polemics among cosmographers, cartographers and pilots, such as the conflict in the Casa de Contratación around the charts of Diego Gutiérrez, a fact not entirely understood by historians. At the core of the difficulty lies the circumstance that only in the present day has the true nature of the nautical chart, as a navigational tool, started to be clarified. How the differences between geographical maps and nautical charts contributed to shape the History of Cartography in various periods, and how they are related to conflicting scholarly objectives and practices, is the subject of this essay. We will show, using the results of cartometric analysis, that not only were those artifacts constructed using different principles and with different purposes, but that they belonged to incompatible cartographic paradigms, and we will argue for the relevance of this fact for the history of science.\n\nIn his acclaimed book Elements of Cartography, first published in 1969, the late American geographer Arthur Robinson stated that “maps are to be looked at while charts are to be worked on.” What Robinson intended to emphasize with this sentence is that maps and charts are constructed with different purposes in mind: while maps are basically a source of geographical information, which one can retrieve just by looking at them, charts were specifically designed to support the practice of navigation and facilitate graphical work. Although Robinson’s definition is remarkably synthetic and expressive, it doesn’t tell the whole story, namely about the profound differences between these two cartographic paradigms. How those differences contributed to shape the history of maps and charts will be the subject of my presentation, which will focus on three different periods: the Middle Ages, when the first nautical charts were produced in the Mediterranean; the age of the great discoveries, when the newly discovered lands were first shown to the amazed eyes of the European nations through nautical charts; and the time of the Gerard Mercator, when the great Flemish cartographer proposed his famous projection to mariners. I will show how the image of the world conveyed by nautical charts in each of these three periods could hardly be considered as truthful, as far as the shape and size of the lands were concerned. This was not because of the limitations of the surveying and charting methods of the time - although they had certainly a relevant influence - but owing to a critical difference regarding what should be understood by an accurate depiction of the Earth, in the eyes of geographers and navigators. In some instances these differences of opinion lead to conflict and resentment. In other occasions, they materialized into apparently unsolvable technical obstacles. Only today can we see through the mist caused by the very subtle technical questions that the protagonists of the past couldn’t interpret correctly, and fully understand the reason for all the conflicts and misunderstandings: the intrinsically different nature of maps and charts.\n\nA comprehensive study of mapping in this period all over the world would be beyond the scope of this volume. In many ways, The History of Cartography series has already achieved that, and remains an excellent reference work available online. The admittedly vast chronological and geographical scope of this theme makes it necessary to focus on some issues at the expense of others. The present chapter is an orienting presentation of recent critical and historiographical developments in the study of mapping in this period. It undertakes three tasks: firstly, addressing some of the inconsistencies of the 'Age of Discovery' paradigm resulting from attempts to impose modern constructs of bounded geo-political space on the rhetorics and 'realities' of the early modern world; secondly, rethinking maps as integral parts of an intellectual conversation about geographical knowledge; thirdly, analysing some of the ways in which maps acted as centering devices within a given cultural context. \"Radu Leca explores cartography in the Age of Discovery by exposing the inconsistencies of approaching the early world based on Eurocentric geopolitical narrative constructs, and shows us the necessity of decentring those narratives. Leca also discusses how maps function as centering devices integral to the sharing of geographic knowledge in a given cultural context.\" Timofey Samsonov, Review of the Routledge Handbook of Mapping and Cartography, http://www.cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1505/1679\n\nSince prehistoric times, the allure for the inhabited world has always been of interest to mankind. This clearly states that from the earliest times, maps have played a significant role in human history. In present times both these maps and their makers serve as powerful medium to revive forgotten personalities and historical events. The history of map making shows that during ancient times, mapmaking was basically a form of decorative art but the most decorative maps have been produced during the middle age times. Mappe mundi and portolan charts were the two traditions found in the European world. But Muslim scholars were still following Ptolemy \" s method and also incorporating writings of travelers and explorers. Through this paper we are making an attempt to have a retrospective view on maps of medieval times and how they laid foundations for scientific modern cartography."
