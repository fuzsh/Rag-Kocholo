        "text": "James Baker / Dorothy Booth - m.@ 1850\n\nI'm looking for parents of James Baker and/or Dorothy Booth, my 2nd great-grandfather & grandmother. They emigrated from Newcastle upon Tyne to the US with their son, Harris, about 1855. A Mary Booth was also with them and we believe she was Dorothy's mother. Baker is my maiden name and I've been looking for more information on James & Dorothy for many years. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thomas William Selby / Robert Bruce Selby\n\nLooking for my father and grandfather who were hairdressers in the area. In Fenkle Street beside the the Assembly rooms. Grandpa Selby lived in Wylam for many years at Falcon Terrace and later in Denholm Road just opposite the Wingrove Hospital. Dad was born in 1902. Dad and his sister Dora attended RutherFord College. My father married Hilda Drummond of Heaton. Aunty Dora was a nurse at Wingrove Hospital. His Sister Elizabeth married George Ashcroft in 1933. His mother worked in the Wingrove Hospital. My sister Wendy went to Dame Allens School and I went to Rutherford. We both were involved in the Newcastle and West End Operatic Socccities. William Mair - Jane Annie Simpson\n\nMy links to the region are through my father Robert Mair (1911-1990), my Grandfather, Thomas Walls Mair (1878-1936), and my Great-Grandfather, William Mair (1855-1927). Both my father and grandfather were borne in Newcastle Upon Tyne. My great grandfather was borne in Scotland and in 1875 married in Newcastle Upon Tyne to Jane Annie Simpson (1854-?) from Gateshead. My parents migrated to Australia in 1951 where I now live in Melbourne. I have been slowly assembling the family history with the help of our surviving aunts on my fathers side, including cousins residing in Newcastle Upon Tyne, however, we have no links to the families of the siblings of our grandfather, Thomas Walls Mair, all born in Newcastle Upon Tyne, namely William Mair (1877-1916), Jane Mair (1880-?), James S. Mair (1882-?), Andrew Mair (1884-1970), Fredrick Mair (1888-?), Jessie Mair (1890-?), Jane Annie Mair (1892-1907) and Robert Mair (1895-?). We would be pleased to hear from anyone who may have a family connection. Harold Turton Dodman\n\nI am very keen to contact family or friends of this gentlemen. He died in Newcastle in 1989. He was born in Rochdale in 1898 and his life between is a mystery.He had a sister Mary Emma Turton Dodman bn 1899 who has disappeared after 1901. Harold is a great great uncle of my husbands, and his mother had 4 more daughters after Harold and it is possible that the two branches of the family know nothing about each other. There is another mystery concerning a boy who went to Canada in 1910 apparently with the same identity. I have been following this trail for a couple of years now. Alison Atkinson James/Joseph b 1866-70\n\nI am looking for info on a James Atkinson recorded as marrying Abigail Buchan in Edinburgh in 1887, aged 21. He was then a soldier in the Royal Scots. His parents were listed as Marshall and Margaret Atkinson, and the only entries that fit in the 1871/1881 census are from Newcastle, living in Peel Lane and then Temple St. They did not have a son called James however but did have a son call Joseph born in Gateshead about 1870. Abigail and \"James\" parted company in the 1890s after having two sons John and Frederick. Fred was born in Sheffield in 1895. Abigail was back in Edinburgh by 1901. I would love any info on what became of James/Joseph Atkinson if this rings any bells! George Hunt and Agnes Reed\n\nTrying to find information on great great grandparents.George Hunt and Agnes Reed. They were married in Newcastle of Tyne, 1877,Cathedral of St Nicholas.They had one daughter in England, Margaret Hunt. They went to Canada in the late 1870's or early 1880's, they are on the 1881 Canadian census. According to their daughters birth certificate they were in CO of Durham, Chester le St, Pelton Fell in 1877. George Hunt's occupation at that time was a butler.

Thank you Barbara Charles Campbell\n\nI am trying to trace any information I can on Charles Campbell who was a Jeweller/Goldsmith and lived c1800 - 1856. He married Ann Mason in St. John Horsleydown, Surrey in 1824. They had children Charles Christopher Campbell, Maria Mason Campbell, John Mason Campbell, Elizabeth Ann Campbell and James Campbell. I know that Ann Campbell moved to Newcastle in 1837 because James was born there. She lived at Leazes Terrace. She was living with some of her children, but not Charles in the 1841 census. If anyone can assist I would be very grateful. Evelyn Yvonne WILSON\n\nI am interested in info on the Wilson family who were living in Newcastle when Evelyn was born in 1924.I believe her father was a butcher and that she was one of several children.Unfortunately I do not have her parents names so any info would be much appreciated. After her marriage she settled in Devon but I know nothing of her roots. Henry Gardner Brown & Mary Blake\n\nI am just starting on my family tree and have already hit a brickwall.

Hillery or Hellary\n\nI am looking for information re. my ancestors who lived in Newcastle. My Gt.Gt.Grandfather Denis Hillery (Hellary)was born in Ireland in 1828. He is on record as having married Margaret Greenwell from Tynemouth in 1852. He was in the 21st regiment of Fusiliers and saw active service in the Crimean War. After leaving the Army he settled with his wife at Ratcliffe Court in Stowell Street, Newcastle. I note that there were others with the same name living in the area at the time. Can any one give me more information as to whether there maybe a link between these people and my ancestors. I live at the other end of the country and travel would be a little bit difficult for me. Thank you. Doctor Dennis Embleton\n\nMy great Grandfather in 1852 was appointed reader in medicine at the Durham University and physician to the Newcastle Infirmary from 1853 to 1878 when he became consulting physcian until his death in 1900. He wrote papers on local Folklore,dialogues,and poetry in the Northumberlans vernacular and the histories of the Newcastle Medical School and of Featherstone Castle as well as several papers on natural history subjects. I would be interested to know if these writings still exist. Can anyone help? Anthony (Tony) Jane Ann Cooney(Newcastle)\n\nJaneAnn, Veronica May & Margaret lived in Percy Street, they attended St. Mary's Catholic Church between 1898 to early 1930's. They were on the music halls especially The Palace Theatre which was near their home. Their mum was once the housekeeper for the Lord & Lady Mayoress of Newcastle and their mum was also the person responsible for cleaning the altar inside St. Mary's. Their mum was a very outspoken lady and was known to shout about the rights of the working man. Their mum died in Newcastle in 1957 aged about 97rs. This lady was my great grandma. I would like any information on them all so I can complete my family history. Many thanks. Elizabeth MATTISON\n\nStates on both the 1871 and 1881 census that she was born in Newcastle in about 1855/56. The 1871 census has her listed as a Dressmaker, aged 15. She is living with her mother Margaret, aged 50 and born in Newcastle also, her mother was a Seamstress.There is also a George Bamborough there, described as son in law to Margaret Mattison, and a Margaret aged 20, described as wife, presumably to George Bamborough. Elizabeth married Edward HALL in Newcastle Upon Tyne Register Office on 23 May 1876.At the time her residence was Byker, Newcastle. Her father was Joseph MATTISON, he was apparently dead by the time she was married. He was a cork cutter. At the time of the 1881 census she was living with her husband Edward and newborn daughter Henrietta at 30 Carlton Street, Newcastle Upon Tyne (All Saints). Mass immigration 1870s-80\n\nWhile trawling the 1881 Elswick census returns, I have been struck by the huge influx of people from many walks of life: labourers, skilled trades, tradesmen & professionals, who moved into the area between 1870 & 1880 - worked out by their place ofbirth and the fact that many had offspring born elsewhere: they came from all areas of England and Wales. Many came from Ireland - potato famine? and Scotland - land clearances? others from Russia, Poland & other countries in central Europe - Jews fleeing pogrommes? and Scandanavia - not so surprising, as many were shipbulders or seafarers. More surprising were the odd individuals who had married locally, but were born in Africa, West Indies, & the far east. What I would like to know is, whatwas the magnet that attracted them at that time to the Newcastle area? It was too late for the railway boom, I would have thought. Was shipbuilding experiencing a great expansion at the time, with lots of jobs available in this and the support industries? the other support workers & professional would be attracted also by the opportunities for work & trade. Have I got that right, or was there another reason for the influx & does my hunch correspond with a known demographic change in the perio... Cross Cromwell Street c. 1897/98, Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne\n\nMy father, James Herbertson Jackman, says he was born in Cross Cromwell Street in Newcastle upon Tyne (in August 1897/8). His birth certificate, recently acquired, confirms this. I have entries in 1901 Census which show him as a 3 yr oldliving with his father, James Richard (son of Joseph Jackman & Harriet late of Great Yarmouth then of Newcastle) and mother Margaret Alder (nee Dixon) at Beaumont Street. Added 24/2/05 - I have found Cross Cromwell in a trawl through 1971 - it seems to consist of one house No.2 lying between No 53 & 55 Cromwell St. & was a grocer's shop in the 1990s - ward's Street Directory Newcastle. The occupant doesn't seem to have any connection with my family. Louie Jones\n\nWhen Louie Jones registered birth of her son, John Lee born 17 March 1890 in Byker, she stated his father was Easten Lee. Gave her surname as Lee, formerly Jones - rather implying that she was married!. Unable to trace their marriage and accept thatJohn was illegimate. Found marriage of Easten to Lily Muller 1899, Gateshead when he was shown as a bachelor. Can anyone shed any light on Louie? Apart from Louise or Louisa, what could have been her 'proper' name? Does anyone know of Louie beingused as a family name for Elizabeth? Composer And Writer On Music\n\nFrom The Century Cyclopedia of Names 1895 Charles Avison was born at Newcastle on Tyne in 1710 and died there 9th May 1770. An English composer and writer on music. He is best known for his 'Essay on Musical Expression' 1752, in which he placed German music below that of the French and Italians. Madonella Pseudonym\n\nFrom The Century Cyclopedia of Names 1895 Mary Astell was born at Newcastle upon Tyne 1668 and died in 1731. She was a writer the author of - A Serious Proposal to Ladies, published anonymously 1694-97. The proposal was for the erection of a monastery or home of religious retirement to be conducted under the rules of the Church of England: a scheme which later brought its author considerable abuse; as in The Tatler (32) where she appears under the name of Madonella. Great Dearth In 1544\n\nFrom Calendar of Cecil papers Vol 1 Newcastle on Tyne page 27 1544/01/13 No 113 Earl Hertford & Sir Ralph Sadleir to Priv Coun Send a certificate of the Mayor and Bretheren of Newcastle,bywhich it will appear that the town is utterly disfurnished and unprovided with all manner of grain,of which there is a great dearth and scarcity in all the country thereabouts,epecially in Northumberland and the Bishopric.The said Mayor & Brethren have also shewed unto them that they had made certain bargains in Norfolk and Suffolk for grain which they expected to have had conveyed hither by this time,but the ships sent by them forthat purpose have been stayed by their Lordship's command and their bargains frustrated in consequence of the general restraint of corn for his Majesty's provisions. Wherefore they pray that such ships may be released and discharged from the ports in which they are now stayed,and that they may enjoy such bargains as they have made for grain,and be permitted to bring the same home with them with all speed......"
