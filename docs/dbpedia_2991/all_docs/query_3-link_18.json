        "text": "MR G. D. BURR'S HORIZONTAL HILLS\n\nPhD at Queen’s University Belfast, recreations and reenactments, 2018-22\n\nDoctoral research entailed recreating drawing and modelmaking techniques as used in military institutions in the nineteenth century. The concept of contours was difficult to explain to cadets learning to survey and draw. Mr Burr, and many other instructors, used model hills inundated with ink to make analogies between contours around hills and flooding events.\n\nBefore contour lines, hills were sketched using the vertical style. A sketching style akin to contour lines, and seen in opposition to the vertical style, was to sketch lines horizontally (also known as horizontal hills). During lockdown, I asked seven artists to trial drawing in both the vertical and horizontal styles by following instructions as written in military treatises.\n\nThese tangible, arts-based research methods enabled me to tease out the problems and practicalities involved in teaching cadets to contour. The thesis abstract is available at https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/horizontal-hills\n\nFurther descriptions are also available on the blog:\n\nhttps://thegreatlinesproject.wordpress.com\n\nTHE GREAT LINES\n\nAlan Reece Gallery, John Muir Trust, Pitlochry, 2018\n\nThe Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle, 2016\n\nGeoConnect, ExCel, London, 2016\n\nSince first hearing of Newcastle born Charles Hutton in 2014, I have been chasing the history of the invention of contour lines.\n\nThe project has involved research (in England, Scotland & the Netherlands), writing (a blog & publication) and speaking (GeoConnect, London; British Cartographic Society, Durham; CSoP Research Group, Newcastle University; Pitlochry Festival Theatre & Charles Close Society, Cambridge University Library).\n\nThe exhibition material consists of a 4ft x 4ft ‘replica’ of Charles Hutton’s (missing) first contour map, two contour models based on the scale of the missing map plus three drawing series of related material. Some of the drawings are available in limited editions (please use the contact page to enquire for details or, to order copies of the publication).\n\nThe project was funded by Arts Council England (ACE), Visual Art in Rural Communities (VARC) and most recently by Creative Scotland as the Lines of Attraction Festival.\n\nThe Great Lines blog...\n\nCHANGING TACK\n\nRiver Hull & River Cam, plus Ruskin Gallery, Cambridge School of Art, 2017\n\nChanging Tack is the re-working of a walking performance created 30 years ago. Using the original ‘sails’, this iteration was conceived for footbridges over rivers, thus exploring the relational within site-specificity. In March 2017 it was premiered in Hull (as part of Hull Time Based Arts’ ‘ReRooted’ Festival for Hull City of Culture). A second performance took place on the Cam in Cambridge in August that year. The five sails are animated by water flow and wind creating continual ephemeral drawn line and shape.\n\nA second iteration of Changing Tack is a re-working of the re-working. Here I used the original sails within a gallery setting which emphasised their ‘out-size’ presence. They were minimally activated: pivoting through small breezes created by people moving within their proximity, (this formed the end exhibition of my Masters degree).\n\nShown alongside the ‘sails’ were slides of the original 1980’s performance and a 3 screen looped video of the 2017 performance on the Cam in Cambridge, a short excerpt shown here: https://vimeo.com/244822644\n\nZERO SUM: an exercise in looking for nothing\n\nBasement Gallery, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, 2017\n\nThis was an exploration of the over-looked, on our streets, under our feet. Hair-bands on pavement are now ubiquitous: detritus as punctuation, they can be read as ‘full stop’ and as ‘zero’ (something as nothing). The photographs within each animated sequence depict a hair-band as seen and noted in situ and documented.\n\nFor this solo show (as part of the MA) the images were shown looped (continually playing) across 7 screens, in a corridor gallery, necessitating a walk to view all.\n\nUTILITY SERIES\n\nStudio Work, 2012/13\n\nOn moving to my present studio I noticed valve, hydrant and sewer covers in the vicinity bore the names of foundries from districts nearby.\n\n'Digging' into their provenance, they began to shed light on the history of their arrival - and the effect on our lives  wiping out cholera epidemics for example.\n\nThrough these 'collages' I have begun an exploration of location through 'hidden' networks, how they connect us, though over the course of the last century we no longer see it - nor physically carry water into our homes. Our ignorance of their provenance, routes and dispersal is unveiled only when they fail (through power-cuts or flood).\n\nDREAM BOAT\n\nGateshead Visitor Centre, 2005\n\nMost of my work is based around an exploration of space. For years I have been creating installations with defined interiors and exteriors but without doors or walls.\n\nMany of these pieces were ‘vessel shaped’ but lacking the capacity to cup or hold anything aside from interior space.\n\nDream Boat is such a vessel, made from sheet PVC plastic, fishing-line and fishing weights, the form is made visible by dripping a pva/ink based mixture down the lines. I am interested in how drips - when allowed to accumulate - slowly give form (substance) to a line.\n\nDEEP WATER\n\nDunaújváros Spring Festival, Hungary, 1994\n\nThe performance site was the side of a ten storey housing block in a town originally called Stalin Town, which was built in the fifties to house the workers for a new steel mill.\n\nThis 'vertical dance' - executed by Ernst Süss - was about giving wings to disused and unloved buildings.\n\nA sister piece was created for the side of a disused Hotel in Budapest. The scaffolding netting used symbolises that a building is about to be transformed, to be 'made better'."
