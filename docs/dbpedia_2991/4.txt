From the humblest origins as a collierâs son, Charles Hutton (1737â1823) rose to eminence as one of the countryâs leading mathematicians. At seven years old he would have been sent to work in the mines but for an elbow injury, and so was sent to school instead. As a young man he studied mathematics in evening school while also teaching at the school in Jesmond where he had been a pupil. He became one of the most successful mathematics teachers in the region, sought after by schools and wealthy local families. Huttonâs first publication in 1764 was 'The Schoolmasterâs Guide' setting out his approach to the teaching of applied mathematical studies such as bookkeeping, navigation and surveying. This was followed in 1770 by his 'Treatise on Mensuration both in Theory and Practice'. The young Thomas Bewickâs first assignment in wood engraving was to illustrate this textbook. In the same year Hutton was responsible for the first map of Newcastle to be based on accurate surveying (engraved by Ralph Beilby). Hutton left Newcastle in 1773 to become Professor of Mathematics in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. One year later he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Continuing to publish textbooks, treatises and papers, he held his professorship until 1807 when he resigned for health reasons. With a pension of Â£500 p.a. from the Board of Ordnance he moved to central London where he lived until his death. Despite the inscription to the contrary, Hutton died in 1823.
