Charles Hutton, L.L.D., F.R.S. was born in Percy-street, Newcastle- upon-Tyne.

Like many others he was entirely a self-taught mathematician.

In the early part of his life he worked as a hewer in Old Long Benton Colliery, but not being able to continue at such laborious employment, he opened a school in Jesmond village, and afterwards removed to Newcastle, where he taught with great success till 1773, when he was appointed by the Board of Ordnance to the professorship of mathematics in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

The following year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

His publications were very numerous, and for a long period have occupied a very high position as mathematical treatises.

He died at his house in Bedford Row, London, on the 27th January, 1823, in the 86th year of his age.
