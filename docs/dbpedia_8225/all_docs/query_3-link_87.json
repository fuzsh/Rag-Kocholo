They started loving me as they got to see me repeatedly.” And it must be true, it’s not his looks, but his charm that resulted in a huge fan following across the globe.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nHe was even rejected during his audition for the Fazil-directed flick ‘Manjil Virinja Poovu’ for his looks. But his talent failed to go unnoticed. Fazil decided to give him the ‘villain’ role, and the rest is history.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nMalayalam evergreen hero Prem Nazir said after the premiere show of ‘Manjil Virinja Poovu’ that the young boy would scale heights. If it was the Malayali audiences who accepted this man of great charm first, now it’s the people from all over the world who are celebrating his performances in over 400 movies in languages spanning Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Tamil besides Malayalam.\n\nSixty-four years ago, on May 21, Mohanlal was born as the youngest son of Viswanathan Nair and Santhakumari at Elanthoor in Pathanamthitta district. But he grew up in Thiruvananthapuram as his father was a government servant at the Secretariat. He did his schooling at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School and graduated in Commerce from the Mahatma Gandhi College in Thiruvananthapuram. Mohanlal from a very young age, aspired to be in the film world. So he never let go of any chance to perform, even in his school days. His first performance was as an elderly man in a play while studying in sixth standard. Later, he happened to be friends with a bunch of movie buffs like him in his college days, paving his way to the Malayalam film industry.\n\nEven though his debut movie ‘Thiranottam’ did not reach the audience for almost 25 years, Mohanlal could not be stopped from emerging as a superstar in the Malayalam film industry. ‘Thiranottam’, which had only one show in a theatre in Kollam, was an endeavour by a bunch of college friends, including Mohanlal, Priyadarshan, Ashok Suresh and Maniyan Pillai Raju, who took the challenge to make a movie in the late ’70s.\n\nLegendary actor Nedumudi Venu had once said when Mohanlal and his friends approached him regarding ‘Thiranottam’, he had sent them away saying “Movie-making is not any child’s play”.\n\nDespite its failure to hit the theatres in Kerala, the confidence ‘Thiranottam’ gave the actor within Mohanlal was immense. In his memoirs ‘Hrithubhedangal’, published by Mathrubhumi Books, Mohanlal writes, “Movies are like life. Sometimes they won’t work as we wish. It will achieve the goal and become immortal only when it happens on its own.”\n\nA rare record of doing as many as 34 films in a year was set by none other than Mohanlal. In 1986, out of the 34 films he did, 25 were hits.\n\nHe writes, “I entered the film field at the age of 17. I have donned so many roles which I had not even dreamed of. Many recognitions came to me. Ups and downs were there. I went through so many experiences. The journey from movie to movie is still on. But even now, I am not totally sure if acting itself is my forte or if I am able to do it properly. I have not yet got answers.”\n\nOn his acting method, the actor writes, “I have heard several actors saying that they observe lives and personalities. I never do that. I don’t do any homework for acting. Many had asked me after watching ‘Thanmathra’ if I had observed Alzheimer's patients. There must be actors who act after technically learning that part, but I never could do so. There will be only the mood and background of the character within me. That too an unclear picture of the same. The rest is luck. I don’t know the grammar of anything. I believe that everything is happening because of some fortune. When being loved as an actor, I am also strongly criticised. I can recognise the productive criticisms. So, I accept them and try to correct myself. But most of them are not coming out of positive thoughts. So I ignore them, remembering Osho’s famous words, ‘I like gossip more than the gospel’.”\n\nMohanlal also says he has no clear planning for his life, citing examples of lacking a dress code for even attending functions. “I wear whatever shirt I get hold of. To be frank, I don’t even carry a wallet out of fear that I might misplace it somewhere. I can’t even count if anyone gives change for a thousand rupees…”\n\nOn criticisms that he is extravagant, he again quotes Osho, “I am not against the rich becoming richer, but I am certainly against the poor becoming poorer.” He writes when he is close to the money, he is away from it at the same time.\n\nMohanlal’s naughtiness is also well-known among the film fraternity. Acclaimed Malayalam director Sathyan Anthikad has always been vocal about the pranks he has done over phone calls. Sathyan Anthikad has shared several hilarious instances in which Mohanlal would call him in someone else’s voice, and each time he would fall for it. The noted director has also said because of Mohanlal’s mischievous behaviour, he could not believe when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan phoned him for real.\n\nNedumudi Venu once narrated how Mohanlal gave an excuse to a director for coming late to the location. On his way to the location, he bought a bandage and tied it around his arm as if he had suffered a fracture. Seeing the same, the director was grateful for him to come even after sustaining an injury.\n\nDuring his career spanning over four decades, Mohanlal has acted in over 400 films.\n\nThe ‘complete actor’ was honoured with Padma Shri in 2001 and Padma Bhushan in 2019 by the Government of India. In 2009, Mohanlal became the first Indian actor to be awarded with the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army."
