He was 80 years old. Gangadharan was hospitalised for more than a week due to age-related ailments.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nHe is survived by wife PV Sherien and children Shenuga Jaythilak, Shegna Vigil and Sherga Sandeep.\n\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\n\nGangadharan's remains will be kept for public homage at his residence in Azhchavattom, Kozhikode, till 2 pm and later at KTC office on Kannur Road till 5 pm. A chance for public viewing is also available at Town Hall from 5 pm onwards. The remains will be brought back to the residence at 9 pm. The funeral will be held at 6.30 pm on Saturday at Azhchavattom residence.\n\nPV Gangadharan, fondly known as PVG, was a luminary in the realms of cinema, politics and business. He contested the Kerala Legislative Assembly poll in 2011 from Kozhikode North and was an active member of KPCC.\n\nBorn in 1943 to Madhavi Sami and PV Sami, a prominent businessman and founder of the KTC Group of Companies, Gangadharan was the younger brother of PV Chandran, managing editor of Mathrubhumi.\n\nUnder the banner of Grihalakshmi Films, PVG produced iconic movies that catapulted today's veteran actors and directors to fame. His foray into the film industry began in 1977 with the production of the film Sujatha. Subsequently, Grihalakshmi Productions crafted several memorable movies, including Manasa Vacha Karmana, Angadi, Ahimsa, Chiriyo Chiri, Kattathe Kilikkoodu, Vartha, Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, Adhwaytham, and Ekalavyan.\n\nThe Jayan-starrer film Angadi, directed by IV Sasi, remains a quintessential action film in Malayalam cinema. Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha is among the classics of Mollywood.\n\nHis last film was Janaki Jaane in collaboration with S Cube in 2023.\n\nKanakkinaav, a production of Grihalakshmi Films, received the prestigious Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration in 1997. In 2000, the movie Santham won the National Award for Best Film. Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, Kanakkinavu, Veendum Chila Veettukaryangal, Achuvinte Amma and Notebook were also recipients of state film awards.\n\nApart from his contributions to the film industry, Gangadharan played a pivotal role in the growth of the PV Sami-founded KTC Group, along with his brother PV Chandran. He has served three terms as the head of the Malabar Chamber of Commerce, an organisation representing industrialists in North Kerala. During this period, he spearheaded initiatives and advocacy programs, notably focusing on the development of Kozhikode airport.\n\nGangadharan was actively involved in various organisations, including serving as chairman of Malabar Airport Karma Samiti and Train Karma Samiti. He held prominent positions such as vice-president of the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations (FIAPF), based in Paris. His leadership roles also extended to being chairman of the Kerala State Film Development Corporation, president of the Kerala Film Chamber, and president of the Film Federation of India.\n\nAdditionally, he served as the director of PVS Hospital, director of Sreekanteswara temple committee, director of Sree Narayana Education Society, director of PVS Nursing School, president of Pantheerankavu Education Society, director of PVS College of Arts and Science, director of PVS High School, and director of Mathrubhumi Study Circle. Gangadharan was also a former senate member of Calicut University."
