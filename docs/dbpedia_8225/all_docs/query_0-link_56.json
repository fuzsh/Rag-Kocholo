        "text": "THRISSUR: During his days as a player, former captain IM Vijayan was a rare joy in Indian football. And preparing for a return to Kerala Police as the revived football team’s coach, he continues to radiate a genuine passion for the game that gave him fame and prosperity.\n\nBack in the cradle of his foot-balling journey — the Corporation Stadium, adjacent to which he was born in a shanty, ‘Kalo Hiran’ is as effervescent and self-effacing as ever.\n\nShouting words of instruction to a bunch of amateurs and simply sharing the joy of playing football, the 42-year old’s simplicity belies the unbelievable rags to riches story that culminated - apart from numerous on-field achievements — in a lead role in a national award winning movie ‘Santham’. Even 12 seasons after he won the last of his three Indian Player of the Year awards, the Vijayan saga refuses to die down.\n\nIn a month’s time Vijayan will be formally back in the Police Department, which he had left to don the colours of the best clubs in the country, as an Assistant Sub Inspector. Armed with an AFC ‘B’ license in coaching, he will take over as the coach of the team that had launched him as a 17-year old skinny lad. “The government order has already been issued and I expect the formalities to be completed soon,” Vijayan said.\n\n“Maldives is weaker than India. It does not serve any purpose when we are going to play against a team like UAE in the Pre-World Cup qualifier,” he said.\n\nIt is continuity, both for a coach and the players, that breeds a good football team, he stressed. “Bhaichung Bhutia, Joe Paul Anchery, Carlton Chapman and myself were together for a long time. It enabled us to find good combination,” he said.\n\n“Academies and other facilities to develop players at the grassroots is the immediate necessity. Players should be taught basics at the right age. We need talented youngsters to come through quickly,” he pointed out.\n\nOn his forthcoming association with the Kerala Police, he said: “I will strive hard to bring the team back into the national limelight.” With the likes of Vijayan, the late VP Sathyan, CV Pappachan and U Sharaf Ali in its ranks, Kerala Police was the nation’s champion club in the early 1990s. But he will have to wait for another season before he can get the players in his hands. For 20 youngsters aged between 18 and 23 are currently undergoing training at Kannur to be absorbed as constables.\n\nAs regards the pathetic state of football in Kerala, he has high hopes of the new Sports Minister K B Ganeshkumar. “Minister Ganeshkumar has been talking positively of developing sports, especially football. I hope he will be able to bring some change,” he said.\n\nOne of the most celebrated Indian sportsperson, Vijayan has another dream. “It would be great if former players become the presidents and secretaries of sports associations,” he said, encouraged by the appointment of former international athlete Padmini Selvan as the president of the Kerala State Sports Council recently."
