        "text": "Newly-crowned I-League champions Gokulam Kerala FC made a triumphant return to their home state on Monday after a gruelling but historic campaign in Kolkata.\n\nScores of fans were in attendance to greet the team back home as the players landed at the Kozhikode airport.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like it. The closest thing I have seen to this was when the Indian cricket team would land in Chennai, after a successful tour in Australia,” Gokulam Kerala FC CEO Dr Ashok Kumar said.\n\nThere was a lot to celebrate too.\n\nWith their I-League 2020-21 win, Gokulam became the first team from Kerala to win the I-League or any Indian domestic league competition in general.\n\nKerala is known for its unbridled love for the beautiful game and has also produced some legendary Indian footballers like I.M. Vijayan, V.P. Sathyan, T Abdul Rehman, amongst others.\n\nBut when it comes to success in domestic club football, Kerala clubs have been overshadowed by their Kolkata or Goan counterparts.\n\nKerala Police’s back-to-back Federation Cup wins in 1990 and 1991 were, perhaps, the only notable achievements of note before Gokulam’s feat this season.\n\nKerala Blasters FC came close to winning the ISL twice but faltered in the final on both occasions.\n\nGokulam Kerala FC’s success, hence, was a watershed moment for Kerala football and due recognition for the state’s contribution towards nurturing Indian football.\n\n“We have had great teams like Kerala Police and FC Kochi in the past, but it was high time for us to revive that past. We have proved that our state is as much a powerhouse as the likes of Goa, West Bengal, Manipur, Mizoram or Meghalaya,” Dr Ashok Kumar noted about Gokulam’s historic win.\n\nThe dramatic way in which Gokulam won their title was in lines with the occasion as well. After a shaky start, the Malabarians picked up pace in the second phase of the competition to pick up 16 of the available 18 points.\n\nDespite the incredible run, the title was decided only on the final day. Gokulam beat TRAU FC in a virtual final and leapfrogged Churchill Brothers in the table courtesy their superior head-to-head record in what was a three-way photo-finish to one of the most intriguing title races in memory.\n\nThe club especially takes pride in the strong local identity the title-winning team possesses.\n\n“If you look at our squad, we have plenty of local players who have long contracts. It’s all about working with them, even when they make mistakes and keep on improving as a team, as a family. We want to grow football both in Kerala and in India,” said Gokulam technical director Bino George.\n\nThe win also won Gokulam Kerala a direct qualification for the 2022 AFC Cup Group Stage provided they meet the AFC Club Licensing criteria.\n\nLead image: I-League media"
