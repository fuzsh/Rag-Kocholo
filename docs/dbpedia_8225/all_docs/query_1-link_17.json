        "text": "MollywoodThe film is a biopic on the acclaimed football player, who led Kerala to victory in the Santosh Trophy. Digital NativeDigital NativeJayasurya played VP Sathyan in his latest film Captain, a biopic on the acclaimed football player who led Kerala to victory in the Santosh Trophy. In an interview to Manoramaonline, the star opened up about the role he got to play in Captain and admitted that he never knew Sathyan personally but was told on a number of occasions that he did resemble the footballer. He had admitted, “Sathyan was a talented footballer who loved the game unconditionally and earned the Santosh Trophy for Kerala. That was his persona on the ground. We had to present him as an individual too. I knew neither of those Sathyans. Yet, I felt his presence during my preparations to essay the role.” However, Jayasurya being a talented actor soon got into the skin of the character so much so that he transformed into VP Sathyan while shooting some scenes. Recalling one such incident, Jayasurya told in the interview that when he had to slap his co-star Anu Sithara, who was playing VP Sathyan’s wife Anitha in the movie, he hit her hard on the face. On this, he said, \"I told you I was going through a lot of emotion. The acting was so intense that I actually slapped co-actor Anu Sithara during the shoot. That was an unrehearsed shot. I had warned the cameraman that I was not sure of what I was going to do. Just shoot whatever I do. I realized that I hit Anu Sithara only after the shoot was finished. I was worried about facing her after the incident, but she was sporty.” Captain was directed by Prajesh Sen, a debutant.
