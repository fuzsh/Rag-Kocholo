        "text": "That an Indian footballer before the pre-ISL era is getting a biopic is quite an unusual turn of events, both in Indian football and in Indian cinema, that, too, long after the final whistle is blown. Captain: The Story of An Unsung Hero is a touching tribute to the late V P (Vatta Parambath) Sathyan who led India for almost five years at a stretch in many international tournaments, including SAF Games, Merdeka Cup, and World Cup qualifiers.\n\nV P Sathyan belonged to that golden generation of Malayali footballers in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, a set of players that lifted Santosh Trophy for Kerala (in 1992, only for the second time!) and brought Federation Cup and Durand Cup, first with Kerala Police and later for FC Kochin. That illustrious roster included C V Pappachan, I M Vijayan, Jo Paul Ancherri, Sharafali, et al. Although Sathyan has scored some memorable goals (that stunning 35-meter long-ranger against South Korea in 1986 remains a classic) for India, he was, in essence, a doughty defender–not a headline maker but his awe-inspiring body language on the football field left no one doubting his determination to succeed and to fight for team cause. But not till the end.\n\nSo why did writer/director Prajesh Sen make a movie based on Sathyan’s life? Would there have been a biopic on him had he been alive now? Was it Sathyan’s football or was that the element of tragedy, of a man who veered on to the wrong track at the age of 41 in Chennai in 2006? Sathyan was a man who had more than one plan to cut down rival forwards’ moves. When found dead, the police recovered four separate suicide notes from Sathyan. He, definitely, had taken his farewell seriously.\n\nFor all that, Prajesh Sen’s Captain is a well-made movie but falls short as a biopic because it is Sathyan’s exit, and not his play, that dominates the movie. Popular Malayalam actor Jayasurya has lent that arresting, brooding touch to Sathyan whose final phase was blighted by alcoholism and a streak of depression. But many still would like to recall Sathyan with his disarming smile.\n\nWhile Kerala reclaiming the Santosh Trophy after 17 years at Coimbatore in 1992 forms the early part of the narrative in Captain, that portrayal could have been better sketched. For when the Sathyan-led Kerala defeated West Bengal in the semifinal, the state’s finest striker, I M Vijayan, was spearheading the enemy attack. Also apart from Sharaffali, none of Sathyan’s other peers are brought in to brighten and sharpen neither his football nor the sudden death. And there is no mention about the turning point in Sathyan’s football career when the legendary Indian player-turned-coach P K Banerjee recast him in the role of an attacking midfielder that fetched India some amazing, long ranger goals.\n\nBut all these should not stop one from appreciating Captain because Prajesh Sen has succeeded in capturing the human tragedy that Sathyan’s life eventually turned out to be.\n\nThere are memorable moments in Captain. Sen knows how to tell a tale but falls too easily for the trite and the dramatic. Sathyan breathing air into a football for his little daughter is a touching scene that captures the essence of the man and would strike a chord with the viewer. Was it just before the weepy July in 2006, marked by the Zidane headbutt and his own exit?\n\nThat Sen has held enough discussions with Sathyan’s wife Anita (a role essayed with conviction and poise by Anu Sithara) come alive in the director getting their unpretentious courtship and relationship in right tone and tenor. For someone so brooding and raw, as he is made out to be here, Sathyan’s thirst for lime juice and craving for jalebis would be a sweet remembrance and an unusual takeaway.\n\nThat a commercial movie (I M Vijayan has had his documentary Kalo Hiran which, unfortunately, very few have seen, and later his own revenge by turning into an actor) has been made on an Indian footballer’s life is an amazing, heartening thing. The movie would stab the ISL generation who worship Messi, Neymar, Suarez, and Hume, in remembering Sathyan long after the long whistle, although not in full measure, and may lead to many another retelling of Indian football’s forlorn heroes. Flaws there are many, but we should applaud Prajesh Sen for his ambition and imagination in an era when the Ambanis have bought Indian football ball, boot, and net.\n\nV P Sathyan was a master tackler but did he know how to hoodwink his opponents? Sathyan left Kerala Police, went to play for Mohun Bagan for two seasons, returned to Kerala Police, again left Police for Indian Bank in Chennai, a place that did not boast of a strong team or a proud football culture. His fellow warriors, even those who had left the Police, finally made their peace with the banalities of a life after the whistle. Sathyan struggled, sorely, in that.\n\nIt may be an Indian mind’s proclivity, but people like to shift blame elsewhere, even if it is in such harrowing accidents such as suicides. That Captain begins and ends with Anitha Sathyan accusing that ‘’they killed him’’ despite keenly aware of her husband’s suicidal tendencies is an alarming pointer towards a cultural flaw. But does it absolve those who are/were involved with football in Kerala and India from the tragedy of Sathyan’s death? How many of them could have helped him find his feet? The Kerala Football Association? All India Football Federation? Kerala Police?\n\nThey shot Andres Escobar, but we were all involved in this sudden death."
