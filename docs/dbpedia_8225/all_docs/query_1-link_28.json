        "text": "After portraying late footballer V P Sathyan in the biopic titled 'Captain', actor Jayasurya is all set to transform himself as legendary Malayalam actor Sathyan.\n\nJayasurya will be appearing as the evergreen star from the black and white era of Malayalam cinema in the untitled biopic.\n\nJayasurya confirmed to Onmanorama that the project has been finalised. Vijay Babu's Friday Film House will be producing the film.\n\nConfirming the project Vijay Babu told Onmanorama that it would be the best film to be produced by his production house. “It will cover Sathyan's life from birth to death,” he said.\n\nHowever, other details about the cast and crew have not been revealed.\n\nSathyan, known for his natural acting style and versatility, won the Kerala State Film Awards for Best Actor twice (for Kadalppalam in 1969 and Karakanakadal in 1971). Popularly known as Sathyan Master, Sathyan served as an officer in the British Indian Army during World War II and as an inspector in the Travancore State Police in the late-1940s. During this time he got interested in acting and took to amateur stage plays. Sathyan made his acting debut in the 1952 film Athmasakhi. He rose to stardom with the critical and commercial success of Neelakkuyil in 1954.\n\nHaving acted in nearly 150 films, Sathyan, along with Prem Nazir, dominated the industry throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nJayasurya won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performances in Captain and Njan Marykutty in 2018. Jayasurya played the role of a transwoman in Njan Marykutty."
