The film is directed by Prajesh Sen and produced by T.L George under the banner of Goodwill Entertainments. The film tells the inspiring story of V.P Sathyan, a former Indian national football player who was also the captain of the Indian team in the 1990s. The movie is a tribute to the legendary player who had a massive fan following in Kerala.\n\nThe movie begins with a brief introduction of V.P Sathyan, who gave his life at the tender age of 41. The narrative then takes us back to his early days when he started playing football in his hometown of Kannur. He soon becomes a popular player in the local football clubs and is recruited by the Kerala Police football team.\n\nV.P Sathyan's talent soon catches the attention of the national selectors, and he makes his debut for the Indian team. As he rises to fame, he also faces numerous challenges and obstacles. The film portrays how he overcomes these challenges with sheer determination and hard work.\n\nOne of the significant themes of the movie is the rivalry between Kerala and Goa, which were the two football hotspots in India. V.P Sathyan plays a vital role in getting Kerala the recognition that it rightly deserved. The story shows how he leads the Kerala Police team to their first-ever Federation Cup win, making him an instant hero in the state.\n\nJayasurya, who plays the role of V.P Sathyan, has delivered an outstanding performance. He has successfully captured the spirit and essence of the legendary footballer, bringing his struggles and triumphs to life on the big screen. His portrayal of V.P Sathyan is natural and heartwarming, making the audience root for him from the start.\n\nAnu Sithara plays Anitha, V.P Sathyan's wife, in the movie. Her character is the anchor for the protagonist throughout his journey, providing him with the emotional support he needs. She has done an excellent job in portraying the character, making the audience empathize with her pain and struggles.\n\nDirector Prajesh Sen has done a brilliant job in telling V.P Sathyan's story in a relatable and engaging manner. The screenplay is tight, and the film's pacing is just right, allowing the audience to get fully engrossed in the story. The cinematography and music add to the overall impact of the movie, making it a must-watch for sports lovers and movie enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe film speaks to the larger narrative of India's sporting culture, which is often overshadowed by cricket. Captain celebrates the spirit of football and pays tribute to one of India's greatest football players. It is a movie that is both inspiring and heartwarming, and everyone should watch it to learn about V.P Sathyan's inspiring journey.\n\nOverall, Captain is a masterpiece of a movie that is sure to tug at your heartstrings. The film offers a glimpse into the life of one of India's greatest football players and is a must-watch for everyone who loves sports and great storytelling. It is a fitting tribute to V.P Sathyan, who gave his life for the love of the game."
