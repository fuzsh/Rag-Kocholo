        "text": "ReviewIt is no mean task, playing a character well over a decade older than you, but Shanthi Krishna carries the role of the illustrious Dr Malathy with a deeply impressive conviction.Screengrab: YouTube / Bijibal OfficialIn debutant director Indu Lakshmi’s Nila, it is through sheer serendipity that the film’s protagonist Malathy (Shanthi Krishna) stumbles upon Nila, a young woman with a mellifluous voice and a distinct Kannur slang, who lives next door to her in a high-rise apartment. For the septuagenarian who has been confined to her bed due to an accident that broke her spine, Nila comes as a balm for her loneliness, someone she can talk to and share her day with. As she sings to her from the adjacent balcony, Malathy sighs with a smile while lying on her bed, immersing herself in her younger friend’s soothing voice and nodding along in contentment. It is a heartwarming friendship,...\n\nFor anybody who has grown up on Sathyan Anthikad movies, it is not news that he is known for directing soulful dramas about daily life and relationships. Many of his films are a testament to how drama can be subtle without any theatrics. As an extension of his style of storytelling and filmmaking, his son Akhil Sathyan brings you Pachuvum Athbutha Vilakkum, which loosely translates to Pachu’s magical lamp. The movie is about a man whose change in travel plans brings him unexpected luck. There are elements of love, loss, struggle, determination, and an overall understanding in this film dealt with the utmost care. A wholesome film such as this one takes the viewer on a pleasant journey.\n\nSpoilers Ahead\n\nPachu’s Life In Mumbai\n\nPrashanth, who is known as Pachu, runs an Ayurvedic store in Mumbai, and it has been a while since it has seen some progress...\n\nMalayalam actor Fahadh Faasil, who is awaiting the release of his comedy drama film ‘Pachuvum Athbutha Vilakkum’, has shared that the film presents an emotional journey peppered with comedy and drama.\n\nWritten and directed by Akhil Sathyan, the film stars Fahadh Faasil as the protagonist – Prashanth Rajan aka Pachu, with Anjana Jayaprakash, Mohan Agashe, and Indrans in pivotal roles. It narrates the story of a Mumbai-based middle-class Malayali businessman – Pachu, who travels to Kerala for an errand.\n\nTalking about the film, Fahadh Faasil said, “My character, Pachu, is an ordinary man, who lives an ordinary life but suddenly finds himself on this extraordinary journey, which changes his perspective of life and everything in it. ‘Pachuvum Athbutha Vilakkum’ is a beautiful story of an emotional journey, sprinkled with comedy, and drama, making it a light and engaging watch for audiences of all ages.”\n\nDuring Pachu’s visit, a series of unexpected...\n\nInterviewBy asking her to play the Ummachi in Fahadh Faasil’s ‘Paachuvum Albuthavilakkum’, director Akhil Sathyan has changed her life, says the 71-year-old cancer care professional in an interview with Tnm.By the time we meet Ummachi in Akhil Sathyan’s Paachuvum Albuthavilakkum, enough has been said to create some mystery around her. This is the woman Fahadh Faasil’s character has to accompany on a train journey – a 71-year-old who, for some reason, refuses to take a plane to Mumbai to meet her son. When she appears on screen, there is the immediate effect of seeing a refreshing face with untellable expressions, making you wonder about her. You will wonder more when you find out about Viji Venkatesh, the actor who played Ummachi. Looking up Viji Venkatesh will give you pages about her long professional career working with cancer patients. She has authored books and has been holding a...\n\nInterviewIn an interview with Tnm, Akhil Sathyan discusses how he made his mark despite his famous last name, how Fahadh Faasil came to star in ‘Paachuvum’ after the initial plan with Nivin Pauly, and more.The story, Akhil Sathyan was sure, would not be confined to the familiar territories of Kerala. It would spread to Mumbai, to Goa, to the trains along the way. That and his documentary making experience was going to make people look beyond the ‘feel-good’ genre that his first film as a director would be categorised as, he knew. When Paachuvum Albuthavilakkum finally came out after three years of hard work, that’s just what happened – people did look beyond the genre that Akhil’s famous father, filmmaker Sathyan Anthikad, is known for. They saw a well-made film, and a fresh and unique treatment of a not-so-unusual theme. “That is one reason I took it away...\n\nReviewWith a marked debut, Akhil Sathyan, son of director Sathyan Anthikad, has kept it real, and admirably, no character is a saint in the film. Akhil Sathyan’s first film does not launch with fanfare or loud introductions. Paachuvum Albuthavilakkum sails off quietly with a newspaper hawker on his bike, throwing away dailies across fences, a warm song beginning in the background. It sort of sets the mood on what to expect – a movie that is not going to make a big deal about things. So Fahadh Faasil is on the screen before you can say aha! and the story chugs along like a smooth train ride. It may fall into the safe feel-good genre, but it is quite distinct in its making, letting the characters attach themselves to you, unforced. Akhil Sathyan has made his mark. The film begins in Mumbai, where the clever opening (with the newspaper hawker...\n\nDocumentary In ‘Gandharvan- Two legends and a painting', Akhil Sathyan captures delightful moments between Mohanlal and Namboodiri as they talk about art and their history.Tnm StaffScreengrab/YouTubeAkhil Sathyan’s short documentary film Gandharvan- Two legends and a painting celebrates art and two highly respected artists, in their own right. The seven-and-a-half-minute documentary features conversations during a meeting between actor Mohanlal and artist Namboodiri, who have known each other for many years. During the interaction, stories are shared from the past, and the making of the mythical painting ‘Gandharvan’ is tracked. The documentary starts with artist Km Vasudevan, better known as Namboodiri, who talks about his first meeting with Mohanlal in Chennai’s Cholamandal Artists’ Village many years ago. We then see Mohanlal talking about his interest in art forms such as music and sketching. He says that although he has tried his hand at various art forms, he now...\n\nMollywoodAkhil, son of veteran filmmaker Sathyan Anthikad, is making his debut with ‘Pachuvum Athbhuthavilakkum’.Digital NativeVeteran filmmaker Sathyan Anthikad’s son Anoop Sathyan made his directorial debut with Varane Avashyamund last year and now his other son, Akhil Sathyan, has announced his directorial debut.
