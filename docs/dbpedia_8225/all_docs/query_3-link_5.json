        "text": "\"Tomorrow will be a holiday in Kerala. I've already signed the order, even before the kick-off\" â this is what the then-chief minister K Karunakaran told Kerala football team captain V P Sathyan over a phone before the final of Santosh Trophy in 1992.\n\n\"Why did you say this to Sathyan at this crucial moment, CM?,\" asked his personal assistant.\n\n\"He has a spark within, I just kindled it,\" the chief minister replied.\n\nThe unforgettable scene in Kerala history was watched by Malayalees recently in the movie Captain which brought to the celluloid the life of V P Sathyan, the legendary captain who lifted the 1992 Santosh Trophy for Kerala.\n\nIf Karunakaran's call, minutes before the match, inspired Sathyan, the excitement is now shared by the crew of Captain whose phones have been ringing non-stop after Kerala's triumph on Sunday.\n\nAs Kerala celebrates the victory after years, the movie which brought the story of the legend who captained the 1991 team is seen as having inspired the new-generation team. The director, G Prajesh Sen, who pictured feelings that words cannot convey, was excited as he spoke to Manorama News.\n\n\"I'm at a loss for words. I'm sitting in front of the TV, with the same excitement that I had when I ordered 'action' for the dream scene of Sathyettan. I spoke to Anitha chechi (Sathyan's wife) a few minutes ago. She's also at a loss for words.\n\n\"We had called (captain) Rahul yesterday (Saturday) to wish all the best for the team. The team did share the energy that the movie provided them. My ultimate joy was when Rahul and his teammates told me they had all seen Captain.\n\n\"Yes, Rahul's words were true. Captain proved its power. This had been our mission. The movie and this triumph that comes after years have indeed been a mission, what else,\" he said."
