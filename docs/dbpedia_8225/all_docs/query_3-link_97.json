As professionals after graduating, our students have contributed immensely towards our country's and societal growth, and this will only increase in the future. The uncertainties of the post-pandemic world and its surrounding uncertainties may have created some challenges, but that has only motivated our students to be more resilient and work harder to progress well in both academics and research. The Placement & Internship Cell at IIT Madras will work with you to ensure that our students will get their dream placements and internships and you get a suitable student/ professional for your organization to move forward. Let this collaboration bring fructified results in Placement and Internship.

You can check out the students perhaps first as interns and explore the match between the studentâ€™s aspirations and yours. Or you can directly absorb them into your team as employees. In either case, I am sure you will not be disappointed. As your employees, our students will likely play a pivot role in taking your organization to greater heights, even when - especially when, the economy is looking gloomy. So, I invite you to come and meet with our students. Looking forward to seeing your team here soon!.\n\nProf. Sathyan Subbiah, IIT Madras\n\nIIT Madras creates graduates of outstanding caliber at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels year after year.
