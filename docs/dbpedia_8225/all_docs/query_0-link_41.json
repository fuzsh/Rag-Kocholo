        "text": "Perhaps his love for wildlife took root in the days of his youth, when he walked the Himalayan foothills of Dudhwa National Park. A conservation consciousness, he himself declared, developed when he was working with Tata Steel in east India, travelling often through the region, passing “through forest after forest” as he said in an interview to Sanctuary Asia. “I used to visit Simlipal often, and those forests with their elephants had me totally captivated.”\n\nWhile still with Tata Steel he began lobbying and working for the creation of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary near Jamshedpur, which was so notified in 1975 largely due to his determined efforts. A ten-year corporate stint in the Middle East followed, but even there, in his own words, he “began to look for ways in which to get involved with wildlife.” He helped establish the Dubai Natural History Society and, having discovered Dubai to be a major international hub for wildlife products, began the battle that would be his defining crusade in years to come.\n\nHe joined WWF India in 1990 with the express purpose of setting up an organisation, the country’s first, to investigate the illegal wildlife trade. Thus was born the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Unit, which a year later became TRAFFIC India. A slew of investigations and seizures turned the national spotlight on traders in fur, bones and ivory, who were operating with impunity at the time. One particular raid in Majnu-ka-Tila in New Delhi, still the largest-ever seizure of tiger bones in India, revealed for the first time the international demand not just for tiger skins but bones, and precipitated the national tiger crisis that has had repercussions in terms of enhanced protection of tigers and their habitats to this day.\n\nHe was a consultant to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) between 1992 and 1997, and Member Secretary of the Supreme Court-appointed Subramanium Committee that prepared the basic document on control of illegal wildlife trade in India, one of the chief recommendations of which was to create a National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. He represented India at CITES delegations for over 25 years, helped found the inter-governmental Global Tiger Forum, and served on the Steering Committee of Project Tiger and the National Co-ordination Committee for Prevention of Wildlife Crimes. He was also a member of the IUCN’s Cat Specialist Group and Asian Elephant Specialist Group. In 1998 he helped set up the Wildlife Trust of India, an organisation he would nurture and mould for the next 18 years.\n\nThrough all this he remained the quintessential man of action, always on the frontlines. He was the sethji, the unscrupulous buyer of illegal wildlife goods, in countless covert operations, playing a very direct (and often dangerous) part in the arrest of poachers, traders and middlemen. He led investigations that resulted in massive seizures of tiger and leopard derivatives, bear bile, and even products such as shahtoosh shawls and mongoose hair brushes, drawing attention to the plight of ‘lesser known’ species and virtually unknown facets of the wildlife trade.\n\nWhile he was not a trained lawyer he specialised in Wildlife Law at the policy and practice level. He was something of a serial litigator, filing PIL after PIL to ensure that people involved with and issues related to the illegal wildlife trade were placed squarely in the spotlight. He fought and won several noteworthy cases – be it saving the wetlands in UP from a World Bank funded construction project, procuring orders to move an irrigation colony out of Corbett NP, or keeping the infamous poacher and wildlife trade kingpin Sansar Chand behind bars – and even argued some cases personally in the Delhi High Court.\n\nHe came to be known among conservationists as the father of wildlife crime control in India. Indeed, it is said that the term ‘wildlife crime’ would not have existed in the country but for his efforts.\n\nIn India, he plays a role in advising the government on natural heritage conservation as a part of several committees including the Project Elephant Steering Committee, National Wildlife Action Plan Committee, CITES Advisory Committee and the Governing Council of the Central Zoo Authority. He is a member of four State Advisory Boards for Wildlife and an Honorary Wildlife Warden of Delhi. In the interphase between business and Biodiversity, he is the Co-Chair of Leaders for Nature, IUCN and an Advisory Council Member of the CII-ITC Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Development.\n\nInternationally, he is the Chairperson of the IUCN SSC Asian Elephant Specialist Group and a member of the Species Survival Commission of the IUCN, on the International Jury of the Future for Nature Awards (Netherlands) and an Advisor of the Marjan Centre of Kings College, London. In the past, he has served as a consultant to the Kenya Wildlife Services and helped establish the first elephant reserve of Myanmar. He has trained wildlife officers of over fifty countries in wildlife crime prevention and has attended CITES meetings for over twenty years as a Technical Advisor to the Indian delegation and as an observer.\n\nHe is also the author or editor of ten wildlife books including the recently published Secret Lives of Indian Mammals (for children), the bestselling Indian Mammals: A Field Guide, scores of technical reports and more than 150 articles in various scientific and popular publications.\n\nPerhaps his love for wildlife took root in the days of his youth, when he walked the Himalayan foothills of Dudhwa National Park. A conservation consciousness, he himself declared, developed when he was working with Tata Steel in east India, travelling often through the region, passing “through forest after forest” as he said in an interview to Sanctuary Asia. “I used to visit Simlipal often, and those forests with their elephants had me totally captivated.”\n\nWhile still with Tata Steel he began lobbying and working for the creation of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary near Jamshedpur, which was so notified in 1975 largely due to his determined efforts. A ten-year corporate stint in the Middle East followed, but even there, in his own words, he “began to look for ways in which to get involved with wildlife.” He helped establish the Dubai Natural History Society and, having discovered Dubai to be a major international hub for wildlife products, began the battle that would be his defining crusade in years to come.\n\nHe joined WWF India in 1990 with the express purpose of setting up an organisation, the country’s first, to investigate the illegal wildlife trade. Thus was born the Wildlife Trade Monitoring Unit, which a year later became TRAFFIC India. A slew of investigations and seizures turned the national spotlight on traders in fur, bones and ivory, who were operating with impunity at the time. One particular raid in Majnu-ka-Tila in New Delhi, still the largest-ever seizure of tiger bones in India, revealed for the first time the international demand not just for tiger skins but bones, and precipitated the national tiger crisis that has had repercussions in terms of enhanced protection of tigers and their habitats to this day.\n\nHe was a consultant to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) between 1992 and 1997, and Member Secretary of the Supreme Court-appointed Subramanium Committee that prepared the basic document on control of illegal wildlife trade in India, one of the chief recommendations of which was to create a National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. He represented India at CITES delegations for over 25 years, helped found the inter-governmental Global Tiger Forum, and served on the Steering Committee of Project Tiger and the National Co-ordination Committee for Prevention of Wildlife Crimes. He was also a member of the IUCN’s Cat Specialist Group and Asian Elephant Specialist Group. In 1998 he helped set up the Wildlife Trust of India, an organisation he would nurture and mould for the next 18 years.\n\nThrough all this he remained the quintessential man of action, always on the frontlines. He was the sethji, the unscrupulous buyer of illegal wildlife goods, in countless covert operations, playing a very direct (and often dangerous) part in the arrest of poachers, traders and middlemen. He led investigations that resulted in massive seizures of tiger and leopard derivatives, bear bile, and even products such as shahtoosh shawls and mongoose hair brushes, drawing attention to the plight of ‘lesser known’ species and virtually unknown facets of the wildlife trade.\n\nWhile he was not a trained lawyer he specialised in Wildlife Law at the policy and practice level. He was something of a serial litigator, filing PIL after PIL to ensure that people involved with and issues related to the illegal wildlife trade were placed squarely in the spotlight. He fought and won several noteworthy cases – be it saving the wetlands in UP from a World Bank funded construction project, procuring orders to move an irrigation colony out of Corbett NP, or keeping the infamous poacher and wildlife trade kingpin Sansar Chand behind bars – and even argued some cases personally in the Delhi High Court.\n\nHe came to be known among conservationists as the father of wildlife crime control in India. Indeed, it is said that the term ‘wildlife crime’ would not have existed in the country but for his efforts.\n\nNVK Ashraf completed his Bachelors degree in Veterinary Science (BVSc) from Chennai in 1985. As a veterinary student, he says, his interest in comparative anatomy attracted him to wildlife.\n\nAfter working for a couple of years as Assistant Veterinary Surgeon with the State government of Tamil Nadu, he joined the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in 1989 to do his Masters in Wildlife Science, which he asserts has been one of his most memorable moments. For another two years at WII, he was associated with several projects, the principal among them being the short term survey he carried out on the status of the Malabar and brown palm civets.\n\nIn 1992, Ashraf joined the upcoming Coimbatore Zoological Park (CZP) where he was mainly associated with Zoo Horticulture and Zoo exhibit designing. He was instrumental in re-creating four vegetation types of Western Ghats in the zoo campus, including the tropical rain forest.\n\nHe joined WTI in 2001 as the Coordinator of the Wild Rescue programme and became the programme’s Director in 2005. Representing WTI, he visited the Environment Public Authority (EPA) of the State of Kuwait in 2003 to help prepare a schematic design plan for a wildlife rescue centre.\n\nHis interest in zoological park management and exhibit designing once again earned him a place in IFAW’s leading five-member team commissioned for renovating the Baghdad Zoo in 2003. Here, he was primarily responsible for the re-designing of the avian and mammalian exhibits. He braved the vagaries of a war zone to help animals and believes that “no matter what one’s political ideologies are, animals caught in the midst of a conflict are innocent victims who should not be made to suffer”.\n\nAshraf is instrumental in the creation of IFAW-WTI’s wildlife rehabilitation centres, the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation & Conservation (CWRC) and Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC), and the rehabilitation projects associated with them. These include rescue and rehabilitation of Asiatic black bears in Pakke TR as well as in Manas NP, Hoolock gibbon in Panbari Reserve Forest, release of hand-raised elephants in Manas among others.\n\nOf all his numerous achievements, Ashraf considers “leading a large contingent of wildlife veterinarians, here in WTI; and through them, reaching out to animals in distress in different parts of India,” as the one that he cherishes the most.\n\nAuthor of a large number of scientific publications, Ashraf is a member of the Captive Breeding Specialist Group as well as the Veterinary Specialists Group of the IUCN/SSC.\n\nRead More\n\nRathin is an alumnus of Gauhati University. He did post-graduation in zoology with specialisation in animal ecology and wildlife biology. In 1998, he was awarded a doctorate for his research on “An ecological analysis of the wetlands in relation to waterbird diversity of Brahmaputra Valley, Assam”.\n\nHe has undergone a special training in Conservation and Management of Wildlife from Smithsonian Institution, US, organised by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in 1994 and trained in Environment Education by the North American Association of Environmental Education in 1997. He also holds a Durell Endangered Species Management Graduate certificate.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Rathin has been associated with a number of diverse projects in his home state of Assam and other Northeast states. He has implemented surveys of birds, studies and projects on human-elephant conflict mitigation, awareness campaigns, policy formulation and community-based conservation projects, in collaboration with agencies and institutions including Gauhati University, WII, and other local and international NGOs.\n\nAt WTI, Rathin works with a team of wildlife biologists on diverse projects including elephant corridor securement, human-animal conflict mitigation, and wildlife rehabilitation.\n\nHe is in charge of WTI’s Rhino Reintroduction Project that has successfully rehabilitated three handraised rhinos in Manas National Park since 2005, initiating the reintroduction of the species in the protected area that lost all of its 100-odd rhinos by the early 2000s. He also coordinates the Elephant Reintegration Project in Manas and Wild Buffalo Rehabilitation Project in Dibru-Saikhowa National Park.\n\n“One of the projects that’s closest to my heart is reintroduction of rhinos in Manas. In 2006, the project began relocating handraised rhinos from CWRC. Releasing these rhinos in the wilderness was one of the most satisfying moments of my life,” recalls Rathin.\n\nRathin, along with Dr Bhaskar Choudhury, were key members of the team that established the Centre for Wildlife Rehabiltation and Conservation (CWRC) near Kaziranga National Park– India’s first wildlife rehabilitation centre near a protected area. Rathin oversaw the site selection, acquisition of requisite permits, and construction of the centre. He was its first Manager, serving for five years beginning in 2002. CWRC is a joint venture of the Assam Forest Department and International Fund for Animal Welfare – Wildlife Trust of India.\n\n“Rathin was very crucial in the establishment of CWRC. He took care of all minor details including selecting material for construction of the building and overseeing the construction,” says a colleague.\n\nSince his college years, Rathin has authored/co-authored a large number of scientific papers and publications. “Wildlife was a new field when we started out. During the final year of my MSc, a few friends and I decided that we wanted to do something different. We started reading and discussing wildlife issues, learnt birdwatching, and so it went. All of us are now established in this field,” recollects Rathin.\n\nKnown for his liaisoning skills, Rathin plays a key role for WTI in Assam. Several of his junior colleagues share that they have benefited from his leadership. Others vow for his puntuality, meticulous planning, hard-work, anticipation and prevention of crises, persuasiveness, his skills to convince people and his ability to get things done as required.\n\nRathin is a member of the IUCN SSC Asian rhino specialist group and threatened waterfowl specialist group.\n\nHis hobbies include photography and painting. He is also a good badminton player."
