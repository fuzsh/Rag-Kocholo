When he died he was one of the greatest leaders of the Communist movement in Kerala. He was born in a poor family in Azhiyur. After passing his matriculation he has stopped his education for various reasons. During the freedom struggle he concentrated his activity in Thalassery.\n\nHe led the movement against foreign clothes in front of some foreign shops in Thalassery.

Born in a landlord family, he still learned about the adverse effect of British rule on Indian Society. After doing his primary education he joined Brennen College. He became a student activist and was suspended from the College. He them left Thalassery and went to Madras where he studied at the Christian College and Pachayyappas college. After completing his law education he became attracted to Gandhiji and participated in the boycott of foreign clothes.\n\nHe met Gandhiji in 1933 and accompanied him to many places and the same year he became the Secretary of Malabar Congress Committee. In 1942 he was sent to jail for three years for participating in the Quit India Movement. He was also became the Member of the Madras Assembly from fighting the election from Quilandy in 1946.

Revathi Amma belonged to a famous Thiyya family of Malabar. Revathi Amma, the daughter of Karayi Damayanthi was the grand daughter of the eminent merchant Karayi Bappu, who is said to have maintained trade relations with England. Revathy Amma's husband was the police commissioner of Mayyazhi and his uncle was the Mayor.\n\nHer presence very much stamped on the political, social and communal spheres of Mayyazhi and Malabar. She started her public life attempting to emancipate the women in Mayyazhi. Her previous experiences as a social worker are often portrayed beautifully. She and her daughter contributed their ornaments to Gandhiji's Harijan Welfare Fund and he blessed them by placing his palm on their heads.Â Positions and fame sought after her as a social worker but she was mockingly nick-named as the 'stray goat of the bazar' by her own kith and kin. Thus she had to overcome so many severe tests of her times. In the background of an Anglo-French culture, she gained the status of a social worker and her life is amply revealed through her autobiography, Sahasrapoornima (completing thousands full moons).\n\nThe portrayal of herself as a daughter, wife, mother, and also as a social worker is done with much ease and grace. She pours into the readers the sweetness and bitterness of these real life roles. Her autobiography is an arduous outcome of twelve years' labour and she has an extraordinary view about its purpose."
