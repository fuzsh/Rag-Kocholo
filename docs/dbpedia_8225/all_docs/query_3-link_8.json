        "text": "Indian film director, screenwriter, lyricist\n\nIn this Indian name, the toponymic surname is Anthikad. It is not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Sathyan.\n\nSathyan Anthikad is an Indian film director, screenwriter, and lyricist who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema. In a career spanning five decades he has directed more than 50 films, been the lyricist for 12 films and been the scriptwriter for 6 films. He is the recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award, five Kerala State Film Awards and three Filmfare Awards. He received the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Humour in 2019 for his book, Eeswaran Mathram Sakshi.[1]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSathyan Anthikad was born to M. V. Krishnan and M. K.

N.'s novel) and Irattakkuttikalude Achan starring Jayaram and Manju Warrier (an adaptation of C. V.
