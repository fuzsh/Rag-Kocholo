        "text": "“I am proud of what I achieved,” she says. V P Sathyan Soccer Academy has now grown to become one of the best in the state. “We have achieved enviable success in these two years. Today, I can say that we have become one of the best grassroots level football school,” she says.\n\nVPS, as her school is known, carved a niche for itself by training kids aged below ten years. “The students are so enthusiastic that they all want to foster a career in football. What is even more motivating is that their parents have placed their complete trust in us. They know the importance of this academy,” Anitha says.\n\n“We have won a number of tournaments. These are good signs. I never expected that we would come this far. Running an academy is indeed difficult with financial problems often being a thorn in the flesh. I would not have continued with the academy without the help of Sports Promotion Trust and many other well wishers,” she adds.Anitha said that many of the players from the academy have got into the Kerala Blasters’ Grassroots level preliminary camp and Muhammed Nemil was lucky to be picked up for the ISL children’s camp being held in Mumbai. “For a soccer academy, this is a positive sign. We have made great strides and are hoping to go big next year,” she said.\n\nis the big result of one such effort. I hope VPS can produce more future players in the years to come,” adds Anitha.Anitha, however, expressed dismay that Arjuna Award still eludes the legendary footballer Sathyan. She adamantly believes that he deserves this big honour.“It is the sore thing in my life. I have moved on after his death, but he is worthy of an Arjuna Award for the contributions he has made to the country and the sport,” Anitha signs off."
