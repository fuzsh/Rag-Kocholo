Sathyan served first as a player from 1995 to 2001 and then as the team's coach.\n\nIn 1991, Sathyan became the captain of the Indian team for the World Cup qualifiers in Beirut and Seoul. He led the Indian team to a gold medal in the 1995 SAF Games in Madras (Present Chennai).[4] He also led Kerala to the Santosh Trophy title in 1992.\n\nSathyan was the AIFF player of the year in 1992.
