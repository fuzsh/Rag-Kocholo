From the legendary VP Sathyan to IM Vijayan, and from CK Vineeth to Anas Edathodika, the state has always had players with great calibre.\n\nWhile the Indian Super League and the I-League contributed in the scouting of these players, Sevens Football also played a huge role. The Kerala Premier League (KPL) is no different.

Jishnu is versatile and is often destructive when played as a winger. He is adept at exploiting the defensive frailties of the opposition and capitalizing on them.\n\nUnais (SAT TIRUR)\n\nThe Malappuram-based outfit sits second in the KPL table and has managed to display some impressive football. Their midfield lynchpin Unais has produced fantabulous performances for them this season.\n\nA pillar in their midfield, SAT TIRUR's game has flowed in the exact way intended whenever Unais has stepped up to take command.\n\nJithin MS (FC Kerala)\n\nJithin MS displayed splendidly for Kerala in the Santosh Trophy\n\nEven though FC Kerala have played only one game in the Kerala Premier League so far, they top their group in the I-League Second Division. Kerala's Santosh Trophy hero, Jithin MS is one of their key players.\n\nThe versatile midfielder has instilled firepower to the attack. The midfielder has been commanding the play for FC Kerala. His ability to get the better of defenders with tricky movements, the quality of his touches, when he feeds the ball through, all make him a player to watch out for.\n\nLijo Siluvacre (SBI Kerala)\n\nAnother defender on the list, Lijo was also part of the Kerala squad that won the Santosh Trophy this year, ending 14 years of despair.\n\nMarshalling SBI Kerala's defense in the Kerala Premier League, the no-nonsense defender has been thwarting incoming attacks for them. His care has often helped SBI from commiting silly mistakes and conceding goals.
