        "text": "A continent-sized nation like India needs more domestic tournaments and competitive local leagues instead of just one or two national leagues\n\nClosing Clubs\n\nIt has been a decade of turmoil and turbulence in Indian football. From 2011 to 2019, as many as 26 major clubs, including JCT, Mahindra United, Royal Wahingdoh, DSK Shivajians, Mumbai FC and Pune FC, have shut down. Goan clubs Dempo, Salgaocar and Sporting Clube de Goa have downsized their teams and only participate in the city league. This means opportunity for local players to hone their skills is on the decline.\n\nWith so many clubs closing down, opportunity for Indian coaches has reduced drastically. At present, there are over 7,500 qualified and licensed football coaches in the country, but many of them are either under-employed or unemployed. They spend their own money (from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh) to acquire an A license or Pro License degree, but struggle to get employment as there is no clear roadmap for Indian football. Quality Indian coaches are needed. They can also only develop their expertise if they get big match experience. The long-term effect of not providing Indian coaches ample opportunities could be disastrous for the development of football in the country.\n\nJust 10 teams in the much-hyped Indian Super League (ISL) and 11 in the I-League cannot represent the whole of India, which is like a continent and not some small European country. Also, as national coach Igor Stimac says, each team in the I-League and ISL invariably have five foreigners in their playing 11, so just over a 100 Indian players get regular exposure.\n\nVanishing Tournaments\n\nOver 25 all-India tournaments have also shut shop in the last two decades, including the Rovers Cup in Mumbai (last held in 2000) and DCM tournament in Delhi (last held in 1997). It also does not help that the ISL, in which all the national team players participate, has no relegation. Consequently, many Indian players lack grit, big-match temperament and do not know how to grind out a result.\n\nThis was evident in the Asian Cup and World Cup qualifying matches in 2019. On January 14, 2019, India, needing a draw to progress, fell apart in the second half in their third Asian Cup group game against Bahrain in Abu Dhabi. Bahrain attacked relentlessly. The Indian defence and midfield could not control the game and kept clearing aimlessly. This led to an 89th minute penalty kick, conceded by Pronoy Halderâ€™s reckless challenge, which enabled Bahrain to win 1-0.\n\nOn October 15, in the Group E World Cup qualifier against Bangladesh at the Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata, India was fancied to win. However, talented Indian midfielders Anirudh Thapa and Sahal Abdul Samad could not cope with the pressure of being favourites and the massive home crowd support. Their passing went awry and Bangladesh, ranked well below India, controlled the game and were unlucky not to win. The match ended in a 1-1 draw.\n\nIndia needs more domestic tournaments and competitive local leagues, like the several All-India tournaments in Kerala held annually from January till May from the 1960s till the 1990s. They were the Sree Narayana trophy in Kannur, the Chackola Cup in Thrissur, the Nehru trophy in Ernakulam and the Municipal trophy in Kollam. In Kottayam district alone there were two tournaments -- the Mammen Mappilai trophy and the KFA Shield in Changanassery.\n\nRaj Kapoor & KFA Shield\n\nThese tournaments were such crowd-pullers that famous film actor of yore Raj Kapoor inaugurated one edition of the KFA Shield. The oldest football tournament in Kerala was the Sait Nagjee in Kozhikode. In the 1990s, the lucrative Scissors Cup was held in Thiruvanthapuram. Regular exposure helped to boost Indian football, as it provided competitive experience to numerous players, even from Punjab, which did not have a thriving local league, as well as Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, and helped to develop young talent in Kerala.\n\nLegendary striker Inder Singh, Magan Singh, G.S. Parmar, Parminder Singh, Sukhwinder Singh, Bernard Pereira, Prem Nath Philip, V.P. Sathyan, I.M. Vijayan and many others came into the limelight through these tournaments.\n\nA vast country like India needs to follow the Brazilian model of thriving state-level competitions and national leagues in the same year. Clubs can compete in both so that players get exposure of 50-60 tough matches every year. Just a single national league, whether ISL or I-League, will not boost Indian football. Developing football standards in a vast country is not a piece of cake. A lot of innovative thinking and restructuring is required as talent does not come out of the blue."
