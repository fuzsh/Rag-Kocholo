        "text": "In many ways, Sathyan's suicide has forced Kerala's golden generation of sportspersons to confront and accept their lost glory and relative anonymity.\n\n\"Rain!?\" repeats the cab driver. \"No, I don't know about it,\" he shakes his head, almost as if one had asked something not to be uttered in these parts. The airport cabbie can keep his secret to himself. The word is out there. If a season somewhere could ever inspire envy, Kerala's monsoon does it. It leaves everything green in its wake. Kerala is lush, and it is luminous. With the happy nip in the air - sticking your head out while driving at 40kmph could give you a winter rash in mid-July - imagining the sombre scene of a funeral procession hardly a week ago is a jarring thought.\n\nVP Sathyan's funeral procession, in a sense, was unprecedented in Indian sport. The burly former Indian football captain is said to have committed suicide by jumping in front of a morning daily express train in Chennai. Accompanying the hearse that carried his body from Chennai to his home in Mekkunnu in the Kannur district, were not just his former colleagues from Kerala Police, where he cut his footballing teeth and Chennai, where he was employed with Indian Bank at the time of his death, but sportsmen from all disciplines. There was PT Usha, Shiny Wilson, her swimmer husband, Wilson Cherian, former internationals of volleyball and basketball and the odd table tennis player. Hardly would a cricketer's untimely death make sportsmen from other walks of life show up at the funeral. A forgotten footballer's did.\n\nThis is not to overstate the point that Sathyan was a hugely liked and respected sportsman. The shock at the circumstance of his death certainly brought out many out of the woodwork, but what could not be missed was the gathering's clear 'community aspect'. They primarily belonged to a generation in India that was arguably the most successful in recent memory.\n\nIn the 80s when Indian sport held the promise of growing achievement, backed by regular and rapid performances at the national and international levels, Kerala's sportsmen and women formed the bulk of the doers. It was the same bunch - waistlines expanded, sideburns greying and eyes moist - that bid farewell to one of them, forced to confront the truth that the wheel may have turned full circle for one of them. In Sathyan's death came to the fore the aspect of inevitable anonymity. The reluctance of a lot to accept that they have passed into the recesses of a nation's mind.\n\n\"Who remembers an Olympic medal?\" laughs PT Usha with an air of resignation that only age and time can bring. The swiftness with which the National media chose to forget a former National captain's tragic death was not in respect of his final plea that his death shouldn't be sensationalised. Far from it. Sathyan carried with him, even in the manner of his death, little recall value. Ironically, it was to forever prove the bane of his life. \"He kept things to himself,\" says father-in-law, Chandrashekaran. \"But when he did speak, he lamented being forgotten by the people and his achievements being overlooked.\"\n\nThen, the death brought up tricky questions - of financial problems, post-retirement security and how much of a professional mindset Indian sport is actually ready to handle. Sathyan's was the prime example when he chose along with IM Vijayan and close friend U Sharaf Ali, mainstays of the crack Kerala Police team which won the Federation Cup in 1989 and 1991, to try his luck at Calcutta's Maidan with Mohun Bagan.\n\nWhile Sharaf Ali returned and is today a deputy commandant with Kerala Police (on deputation with Malabar Special Police in Mallappuram) and IM Vijayan played out a glittering club career, Sathyan returned to semi-professionalism, this time with Indian Bank in Chennai.\n\nIt was a marriage that came with cracks at the wedding itself. A thyroid problem and depression following growing disillusionment at not being adequately recognised for his achievements took the toll on the defender. Sathyan was forever hurt at the fact that his stint with Bagan cost him a series of promotions in Kerala Police and that he was forever overlooked for the Arjuna Award. \"Of all the 11 players who won the Federation Cup in 1991, nine are still employed with Kerala Police, serving in good positions across the state. Only Sathyan and Vijayan are the odd men out,\" says Sharaf Ali, Sathyan's closest friend.\n\nIndeed, if the respect that Sharaf commands as deputy commandant (Addl. DSP) is any testimony to the post-retirement security that most sportsmen in India dream of, then he's earned it. He has held this post since 1995, and this is his third stint in the picturesque Malabar outpost. Maybe it's the Kerala Police team's idea of professionalism, one which would find few takers today. It has worked, all the same. And maybe that is why \"professional\" ideas like FC Kochin and other lame attempts to recover the glory of Kerala football fell flat on their faces.\n\nFormer India goalkeeper KT Chacko did not even venture out of the state despite offers from Calcutta. \"Why go anywhere, yaar?\" he counters. \"Kerala's a good place, good climate, good food. Drawing a monthly salary was not comparable to the lakhs players earned in Calcutta, but it kept me happy,\" says the assistant commandant (DSP), and then adds a bit, footballing: \"Historically, other state's goalkeepers have struggled in Calcutta.\"\n\nLike Sharaf and Chacko, the rest of the Kerala Police team can boast of making the right decision to stay put at home as it at least ensured them a pension for life. And the recognition, they, like all, crave for. In Kerala, it is impossible to be a footballer and not be known. The Kerala Police team of that time, and subsequently the Kerala state team which won the Santosh Trophy twice, continues to enjoy legendary, almost mythical status in the state.\n\nMaybe, armed with this implicit knowledge, they are leading their post-player lives in more relative harmony to say, their counterparts in Bengal. It is the comfort in close numbers that Sharaf Ali talks of. Suddenly, Chennai too seems too far away. \"Had he been here, family and friends could have advised him. But he was away in Chennai,\" says Sathyan's long-time roommate.\n\nVijayan's senior strike partner Pappachan runs the Kerala Police Academy in Thrissur. It doesn't matter too much that the last recruitment Kerala Police carried out in football was in 1994, and then, only four were picked. Like Chacko, he is an assistant commandant. The other striker, Liston, is circle inspector (a gazetted officer's post) in Thrissur. Midfielder Thobias is asst. commandant, based near Kottayam, while defender Kurikesh Matthew is AC at Adoor. Alex Abraham is an inspector at Kottayam while left-back Bobby Raj is a senior sub inspector in Sathyan's district of Kannur. Jabeer, left back of the team, is a SI.\n\nVijayan continues to be the anomaly, even 18 years after bursting into Kerala's (and swiftly, the nation's) footballing consciousness as a dark, sunken-eyed kid genius. During the recent World Cup, a local trader used Vijayan's draw to plug his electronic products. Like faded-in-the-rain Brazilian and Argentine flags still hanging at roadside hamlets, and other tournament residue, Vijayan's face still adorns huge garish yellow billboards all along the north Kerala highways.\n\nThe extent to which sport and indeed, football, dominates the lives of the former Kerala sportsmen can be gauged by the Raja Ravi Varma replica of Damayanthi and the Swan that hangs in the verandah of Sharaf Ali's official residence, a near-sprawling haven atop a hillock, with a stunning view of the thick forest and stream below. At the bottom of the copy, the fine print reads: '53rd BN Mullik Memorial All India Football Tournament'. It says little about the aesthetic tastes of the thoughtful Sharaf Ali, and is more of a memento. Like the house itself where it hangs, one which Ali believes could have been his friend's too, had he come to terms with his footballing wanderlust.\n\nToday, in Sathyan's parents' - father Gopalan Nair, 77, and mother Narayani Amma, 67 - house hangs their son's portrait. He was 41.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nHockey team in semis; Sen out of gold race on Day 9\n\nsports\n\nIconic photos of Paris Olympics\n\nsports\n\nParis Olympics: Lakshya Sen to compete for Bronze medal\n\nsports\n\nHeartbreak for India as medals elude Nishant and Manu on Day 8\n\nsports\n\nIndiaâs Olympic gold medals throughout history\n\nsports\n\nParis Olympics: Records that have been broken\n\nsports\n\nManu Bhaker, Lakshya Sen, hockey team headline India's Day 7\n\nsports\n\nTop Olympic champions throughout history\n\nsports\n\nManu Bhaker scripts history with second medal on Day 4\n\nsports\n\nFastest fifty in test cricket\n\nsports"
