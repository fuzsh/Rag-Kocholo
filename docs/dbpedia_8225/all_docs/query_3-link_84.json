We each have our path ahead of us and need to figure out what is meaningful and how we can contribute to life at this time.\n\nPatience and long-term thinking have probably been my most profound lessons learned at Zoho.\n\nSridhar once told me that getting rich is not a worthy goal. Being able to improve oneâs standing in life and helping others succeed is.\n\nIf you are starting out at Zoho, or are relatively new, trust yourselves. Set goals. Be prepared to invest what you can to learn what is needed to achieve your goals.\n\nHave a plan (write it down). Build strong connections with colleagues. Be liked. That is the most important thingâbe likable. It will help you go far, whatever path you take."
