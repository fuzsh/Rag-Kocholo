        "text": "KOTTAYAM: Demanding the removal of Jacob Thomas from the charge of probe in the cases against KC(M) chairman K M Mani, the Youth Front(M) has reiterated that Vigilance Director is showing personal enmity towards Mani, and alleged that the former acquired the post through influence only to take revenge on Mani for recommending Vigilance probe against him earlier.\n\nYouth Front(M) state president Saji Manjakadambil said probe by any agency or official other than Jacob Thomas is welcome in any of the cases against Mani as his hands are 'clean.'\n\nMani had recommended a Vigilance investigation against Jacob Thomas when the Finance Inspection Wing found that the purchases made by him in capacity as Port director were illegal in its probe based on a complaint filed by a Kannur DCC secretary Sathyan Naravoor, he said, adding it was the main reason for the vendetta.\n\nHe also alleged that Jacob Thomas acquired the ADGP post influencing Ramesh Chennithala to avoid action against him. Besides the port case filed on 24/07/2014, 2014, one more case was registered against him on the basis of another complaint filed by Sathyan Naravoor that the officer had illegally received an amount of `1,65,000 as salary for six months from Kollam TKM College, during his leave period from the IPS which he took on the pretext of completing his research. However, both the cases were written off after a department probe under him, Manjakadambil added.\n\nJacob Thomas tried to create an impression that he is also probing the bar bribery case when in fact he had charge of only North division of the Vigilance, Manjakadambil alleged. When Sathyan filed a writ to remove the officer as ADGP in the High Court, the officer sought a transfer to the Fire Force by influencing the then Home Minister, he added."
