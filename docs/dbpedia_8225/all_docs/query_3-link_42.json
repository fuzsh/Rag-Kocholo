Zohoâs emphasis on innovation, collaboration, and a customer-centric approach resonates with my values. It cultivates an environment that fosters creativity, problem solving, and continuous improvement. This culture empowers me to make meaningful contributions to our projects, ensuring our solutions are not only technically robust but also customer-focused and user-friendly.\n\nWhat were the highest and lowest points of your journey with Zoho?\n\nThe pinnacle of my journey with Zoho was when I received a heartfelt compliment from a very famous, seasoned IT veteran after one of my tech talks. The fact that my message resonated well with him and added value to his time made me ecstatic. On the flip side, the lowest point was navigating a challenging period of tight deadlines and resource constraints, testing our resilience and problem-solving skills. These experiences have been instrumental in my growth, teaching me valuable lessons in both success and adversity.\n\nWhat are your hobbies or favorite activities outside of work?\n\nI find joy in delving into fitness literature, continually educating myself on effective routines. The fusion of reading and practical training not only enhances my understanding of functional fitness but also enriches my overall well-being. Itâs a dynamic hobby that nourishes both mind and body, providing a holistic and enjoyable approach to staying active and informed."
