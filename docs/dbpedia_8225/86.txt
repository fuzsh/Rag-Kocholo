KOZHIKODE: V.P. Sathyan's wife Anitha has appreciated the biopic of the football legend that had hit the theatres last week with Jayasurya starring in the lead. She had watched the first show of the movie here. The makers of the film said they would screen it in all educational institutions and sports academies after theatre shows. 'The film features three stages of Sathyan's life; hence we call it a perfect biopic," said the director, Prajeesh Sen.

"Jayasurya dared to take up challenging role and did his part the most beautiful way, with all the perfection it requires." "Shooting the matches was another challenge. But we could do it on the large canvas, just like any other football match," he added. He said Jayasurya was not much into sports but to do justice to the role, he got training from experts and worked hard to do justice to the legendary character. Movies like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag was an inspiration for him.

"We did the biopic to tell the present generation about this footballing legend. A native of Kannur, he was the captain of Indian team," said the journalist-turned-filmmaker. "He brought back Santhosh Trophy to Kerala. Unfortunately, he never received his deserving stature. Through the film, we have tried to bring out all the ups and downs of his career and the tragic end."
