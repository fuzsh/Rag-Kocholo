        "text": "Looking to take baby’s name up a level? From cute boy middle names to cool ones for girls (and weird ones in between), good baby middle names come from surprising places!\n\nAh, the middle name – the most neglected and misunderstood of titles.\n\nMost are left on the sidelines, called on only for airplane tickets, official documents, or when mama is no longer messing around.\n\nAnd those kept in the center are often shortened to a mysterious initial.\n\nBut if chosen well, middle names add a certain gravitas. ✨\n\nThey can be a beautiful tribute to a beloved friend or a way of honoring both parents.\n\nAnd the best part is they’re totally optional for the bearer to use and adapt.\n\nYou can drop it, shorten it, or turn it into an endearing nickname – what’s not to love?\n\nWe’re celebrating the return of the middle moniker with 220 suggestions for good middle names for boys and girls.\n\nAnd while we can give you ideas, ultimately the choice is yours!\n\nIn this article: 📝\n\nDo middle names matter?\n\nOnce upon a time (in the West anyway), middle names weren’t so common.\n\nGeorge Washington was just George Washington.\n\nMary Wollstonecraft was just Mary Wollstonecraft.\n\nBut then, sometime in the 19th century, everything changed, and you ended up with Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso (or Picasso, as he was better known).\n\nSo why do middle names exist exactly?\n\nIt all started in Ancient Rome, where boys would be given three names – a personal name, a family name, and a cognomen for the branch of the family they were from.\n\nThe more names you had, the higher your social status was (so feel free to get generous with your middle names).\n\nBut it’s not all about the boys’ middle names.\n\nThe tradition of Western middle names is rooted in the Medieval era when parents couldn’t decide between the family name or a saint name.\n\nBaptismal names became the easy solution and the tradition was born.\n\nAnd while many cultures no longer have middle names, plenty of other cultures still do.\n\nFrom Latin America to Russia, there are so many traditions you can lean into when choosing a middle name.\n\nToo much choice?\n\nDon’t worry, we’ve narrowed it down and categorized to help you find the one.\n\nWhat is a great middle name?\n\nIf you don’t feel bound to any one middle name tradition, you may be wondering how you want to approach picking one.\n\nAsking these questions could help:\n\nDo you want to honor someone? You can use a middle name to recognize a beloved relation, ancestor, or friend. A recent study found that most parents choose middle names as a commemoration. But it’s up to you.\n\nDo you want to celebrate your heritage? A middle name can be a good way to acknowledge the place you or your family are from.\n\nDo you want to try something different? If you’d like to try a name that’s a bit more unusual, but don’t want to use it every day, it can work well as a middle name.\n\nCan’t agree? Arguing over different names? You wouldn’t be the first. Making use of middle names can be an excellent compromise.\n\nIs one enough? With middle names, the sky’s the limit. If you feel that two or three middle names flow better than one, go for it.\n\nHow do the names fit together? If you have a middle name in mind, play around with it before you commit. Write the full name down, repeat it out loud, and pay attention to the initials. This way you’ll notice anything awkward before it’s too late.\n\nWhat are good middle names for boys?\n\nSo, what are some cool middle names?\n\nWith this question in mind, let’s take a look at some good middle names for boys and girls.\n\nWhile we’ve divided them up by gender, there’s no rule to say you have to stick to these conventions!\n\nFirst names to use as middle names for boys\n\nBut if a classic isn’t your style, a great place to look for middle name inspiration is a list of popular first names.\n\nHere are some to start with (and check out Peanut’s big list of boy names for more):\n\nLiam: Meaning “helmet of will”.\n\nFred: Meaning “peaceful ruler”. ✌️\n\nNoah: Meaning “rest” or “repose”.\n\nOliver: Meaning “olive tree”. 🫒\n\nElijah: Meaning “Yahweh is my God”.\n\nBenjamin: A biblical name meaning “son of my right hand”.\n\nLucas: Meaning “bringer of light”.\n\nHenry: A regal middle name from the Old German Haimirich meaning “home ruler”.\n\nMason: From the Old French word masson meaning “stone-worker”.\n\nGilles: Meaning “servant of Jesus”.\n\nEthan: Of Hebrew origin, Ethan is a strong middle name that means “firm”, “enduring”, and long-lived”.\n\nJacob: Meaning “supplanter”, Jacob is an interesting pick for a middle name.\n\nLogan: This Scottish name means “little hollow”.\n\nJackson: Meaning “son of Jack”, this Old English middle name is a great pick if you want to honor your partner.\n\nSebastian: Meaning “venerable” or “revered”.\n\nJack: Meaning “God is gracious”.\n\nOwen: A Welsh name meaning “well-born” or “young warrior”.\n\nTheodore: Meaning “gift of God”.\n\nAiden: An Irish name meaning “little fire”.\n\nSamuel: Meaning “God has heard”.\n\nMatthew: Meaning “gift of God”.\n\nLuke: A popular short form of the Latin Lucas meaning “bringer of light”.\n\nCarter: Meaning “transporter of goods by cart”.\n\nJulian: A Greek gender-neutral middle name meaning “youthful”.\n\nGrayson: This distinguishing middle name means “son of a steward”.
