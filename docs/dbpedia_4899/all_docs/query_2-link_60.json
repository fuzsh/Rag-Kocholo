        "text": "Andrew and Amira:\n\nMuch more straightforward problem, much more convoluted \"solution\". Problem is that her visa was approved sometime not too much before the Covid shutdowns. So her validity time is ticking away (she said 5 months, so her medical was probably 3 or 4 weeks before her interview) and there is no end in sight (\"spoiler alert\": those same restrictions are STILL in place 6 months after filming).\n\nTheir choice is to hope the travel ban is lifted before the visa expires (which it won't be) or to allow it to expire and wait to apply to revalidate until the Embassy opens up for visa processing again (which is only just beginning at some US Embassies-- unclear about France but I'd kind of doubt it).\n\nOr, they can find a country which is accepting French nationals that is also not on the list of countries that the US has banned. And about that ban? It's only about where you've been in the past 14 days, not what your nationality is. So, find a place she can get into that isn't on the US ban list, stay 14 days, fly to the US. At that particular time, it seems that Mexico was really the only possibility.\n\nI spent some time reading \"the website\" Andrew referred to and this was a pretty common course of action for a lot of folks and most were successful. I personally would have chosen this route myself as long as my fiance was onboard for it.\n\nThe biggest risk that people could see was being in your 14 days in Mexico and then the US adds Mexico to the travel ban list. Then you're in the same position you were in the EU, except now in Mexico. Or possibly that you won't be allowed onto the flight to Mexico because of some misunderstanding of the rules, or that you won't be allowed into Mexico for some reason but there really aren't many reasons that EU citizens would be denied entry into Mexico, particularly not when Mexico was open and ready for tourism from the EU. So that risk seemed minimal.\n\nSo, that's my best read of the situations! Got some extra info/spoilers hidden below for those who want to watch this play out in real time.\n\nActual spoilers below:\n\nBut as we can see, she gets detained.\n\nAlso from my reading \"the website\", she was detained IN MEXICO and sent back to Europe but she doesn't say why. Further, she only a few weeks later is talking about doing the same thing from Serbia (which had just gotten on the US approved list or maybe they always had been approved but there wasn't a flight to the US that didn't transit a banned country-- either way, by mid-July, Serbia became the top choice for this and there was a direct flight to JFK) ....but asking about an entirely different visa type. Which makes me seriously wonder if they're actually doing a K1 or if she got a different visa either on her own or through TLC. No indication if she made it to the US, but I would assume so. As long as that visa was still valid and she was 14 days in an approved country, there's no reason for the US to deny her entry.\n\nIf a different visa type, that could explain the detention in Mexico-- they didn't believe that she'd be allowed in the US and so her proof of onward travel was void to them. Or because she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico (she says as much online) and didn't yet have a flight or proof of onward travel to the US (rookie mistake and that'll get you turned around most places in the world-- she was \"detained\" because during Covid there wasn't exactly a flight back to Europe a few hours later. When you're denied entry to a country, they hold you until the next flight back to where you came from). Or maybe....who knows? I know nothing about Mexican policies. Everyone else got through to the US in this way with no problems. ONE guy was denied boarding in his airport of origin--somewhere in UK trying to go to Amsterdam to get a flight to CDMX because the ticket agent was insisting that he's not allowed to go to Mexico for tourism, which is dead wrong, he totally was, and that guy got screwed by some budget airline's ticket agent.\n\nu/CatherineAm\n\nVisas, Covid, Travel and Detention: Update\n\nHere we go again, fam! Still a lot of confusion bouncing around about Andrew/Amira's plans and apparent failure. I gotchu.\n\nTL;DR: They were right to be concerned about the visa validity, and these types of visas were not extended, if you're seeing that, you're seeing something that's not the visa. Mexico should have worked and would have in terms of her admissibility to the US. You'll note she was detained in Mexico.....probably denied entry into Mexico for some reason... possibly her own mistake, maybe something else. Either way, her admission to the US hasn't even been an issue at this point. Detailed it below.\n\nAs always, disclaimer: these are educated guesses, TLC's editing works very hard to make you think one thing, my understanding of reality is another. I HAVE been wrong at least once before in my life so actual reality may be something else entirely. But... I do have lots of experience with this stuff and I can read between the lines pretty easily and TLC's fruding *especially* when it serves to make would-be immigrants even more nervous about this whole situation really, really irks me.\n\nSo first, to remind us about their situation from my post last week, they are in a bit of a sticky situation with the visa and its expiration date, and it all comes down to the medical appointment (the visas are issued with a validity period-- need to use it/ enter the US by a certain date-- that is 6 months after the medical appointment, this is confirmed in some links below).\n\nThey filmed this in June, she says her visa was issued for 5 months, expiring in August. So it looks like she had her medical in late Feb/early March, had the visa interview and approval probably right before Covid shutdowns. All of what they've said about this tracks with the real life timeline and how this all works. This plus reading the website in question, I honestly think that none of this is made up by them or TLC or anyone.\n\nI know a few folks here done some Googling and found something that they've interpreted to be \"automatic extensions for K1 visas\". I'm guessing it's this. First, note that this was in August so they wouldn't have known this was coming.\n\nAnd second, and most importantly, this does not apply to their situation. Why? Read again and note that they are talking about revalidating the I-129f. The I-129f is the form that the US citizen submits to USCIS who does a basic check to make sure you're baseline eligible for the visa (not already married, old enough to be married, and no red flags for human trafficking and certain violent crimes in the American). USCIS sends that to State (the embassies abroad) and you've got 4 months to do the forms and medical exams for State and have an interview. That's the 4 month thing they're referring to. That's what they extended.\n\nWhat they did NOT extend was the validity period of the K1 visas themselves. Quotes and links to back that up below. I'm going to link to the US embassy in the UK on this because I'm already familiar with it and it seems US Embassy France has moved some pages and I just don't want to dig. But France and the UK were and are under the same exact restrictions, even post-Brexit.\n\n[Ack, I was editing for a typo and accidentally deleted stuff, rewriting now. Sorry if I've changed what you commented on]\n\nSo... Embassy can't help?\n\nNope.\n\nFAQ 3.14 Can My Immigrant or Fiance(e) Visa Be Extended? Can My Medical Be Extended?\n\nImmigrant visas cannot be extended. However, if you are unable to travel within the validity period of your visa due to circumstances beyond your control, you can request visa reissuance once services have resumed for your visa category.\n\nIf appointments are not currently taking place for your visa category, it is also not possible for visas of that type to be reissued at this time. Please keep checking our website for further updates.\n\nPlease be aware that the extension of a medical report is only possible in certain limited circumstances, and that it can only be considered in the context of visa issuance or reissuance.\n\nSo basically, they can't extend the visas without an appointment and those weren't happening then (and only just started happening now). She had a valid visa. The choice was to figure out how to use it or face an unknown period of time before she'd be able to get another one.....and it was clear that it was going to be a long time for that.\n\nSo what's up with Mexico?\n\nI cannot possibly say this enough. K1 visas were never banned. French people were not banned. Only people who had been in certain countries in the previous 14 days were \"banned\". If she'd been living in New Zealand with her French passport (say...I don't know, temporary work visa there) when all this went down, she'd have been allowed in. If a person from New Zealand was living in France and had a K1 visa in THEIR passport, they wouldn't have been. Covid doesn't care what your passport is, only where you've been for the past 14 days.\n\nSo the solution was to find a country that was accepting your nationality or travel history (some countries DID do it by what your passport was....sigh) that was also not on the US travel ban list and stay there for 14 days. (And if you really want to get in the weeds, which ALSO had available flights that didn't transit a country on the ban list. Serbia was never banned but it took many months before there was a flight to the US that didn't transit Germany so that was out. This may become an important point later.)\n\nState Department has this to say:\n\nFAQ 1.3Can I travel through a country not covered by PP 6669?\n\nTravel to the United States from a country that is not covered by the Presidential Proclamation may be possible, but we advise you to verify whether the country to which you intend to travel has implemented travel or other restrictions before you make travel arrangements. One possible source of such information is travel.state.gov which contains links to the websites of other countries’ immigration authorities.\n\nWe are not able to suggest countries through which you may travel, comment on your proposed travel itinerary, or provide information about travel regulations that apply to other countries.\n\nPlease bear in mind:\n\nThe proclamation suspends travel to the U.S. for any individual who has been physically present in the United Kingdom or another listed country within 14 days prior to their arrival in the United States. Unless you plan to stay in a country that is not impacted by any of these proclamations for 14 days before traveling onward to the United States, the proclamation will continue to apply.\n\nSo basically... yes, you can do this. The \"may be\" is referring to the fact that you need to be let into that third country for this to work and also to cover themselves in case things change. But this really is a pretty straightforward thing to do and which many people, not just a few other K1s on Visajourney, did.\n\nFor what it's worth: this still was a risky move. If the US added Mexico to the travel ban list during her 14 days, they'd be in the same position except now in Mexico.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nUnclear but we do know that she was detained in Mexico, not the US so this is a problem with Mexico, not the US. Best guess without any other information is that she didn't comply with Mexico's entry requirements and was denied entry. From reading the thread on the website (spoilers), she bought a one-way ticket. If she didn't have any evidence of onward travel from Mexico, that'll be enough to be denied entry. When you're denied entry to a country, they hold you until the next flight back to where you came from. What else would they do, really? Let you in after they deny entry? Her bad luck that flights were much less frequent during that time and so it was more than just a few hours.\n\nSo... DID they just blindly follow advice on an internet forum?\n\nMaybe but also kind of no. All of this information is available online from US government sources and I'd be surprised if they ONLY read a forum but, people are weird. The forum folks had already done it. There was no reason to worry about admissibility to the US. And as we can see... so far, she didn't have an issue with that. Entry to Mexico got messed up. Her fault? Maybe. The funny thing is that the people on the forum were talking about the round trip ticket issue and Amira asked about a one-way and then said she bought one.....so they'd have been better off if they DID blindly follow the forum because the forum had it right! And just for those who would still really, really, really want to hear it from a lawyer instead of the US government and internet forum folks. Here. That'll save you $800/hr.\n\nPosted by u/CatherineAm\n\nCovid, Travel, and Detention: Calling BS ....with Receipts\n\nEdit, I am igmur illiterate so link to full set of screenshots here. http://imgur.com/gallery/D0sn7Nv\n\nHi all, been a shit week for me (my husband was exposed to Covid at work by an entitled asshole and so we've had to split the house into two so we can avoid exposing me, too. So I'm camped out in the living/dining/kitchen area for the next 10 days. Oh, and, there's a good chance you saw my office on TV this week, no worries, been on telework but fucking still am I over 2021 already).\n\nSo, I have almost zero patience remaining for anything or anyone and certainly not patience for Andrew/Amira/TLC spinning this into them being some sort of victim of the Mexican authorities because of their \"risky\" plan to travel to the US via Mexico because of quarantine logistics.\n\nBut I've got just enough patience left to call out their nonsense because this sort of thing, making immigration seem scarier than it already is, is bullshit. And while I'm not going to pretend that 90DF has real life far reaching consequences, generally this kind of deflection of personal blame only serves to scare others. And not everyone who gets scared by a liar's twist of reality has the resources available to get the record set straight. It's straight nonsense, particularly coming from someone with the privilege of having one of the strongest passports on the planet (stronger than the US passport), and who was aware of the very thing that led to her situation.\n\nAs I've outlined here and then here, the risk in this situation was that the US would add Mexico to the travel ban list during the 14 days in Mexico. Outside of that risk (well, and Covid en route but they haven't mentioned being concerned about this), this was as normal of a trip to Mexico as you could get. Yes, it was during Covid. But French people and people traveling from France (and through the Netherlands, as she did) were never excluded from Mexico. She's on a possibly ill advised (Covid-wise) two week vacation as far as Mexico is concerned.\n\nAll she had to do was comply with Mexico's entry requirements for French citizens, which are basically \"have a round trip ticket\". Which, apparently, she knew. That's a link to screenshots of a popular immigration forum and is either Amira or someone pretending to be her. I've screenshot her posts about her Mexico trip.\n\nThe thread is full of people doing this exact thing and having no issues (well, one guy got denied boarding in Europe because the ticket agent didn't believe he was allowed entry into Mexico, ticket agent was wrong), with the key difference of having, you know, complied with Mexico's entry requirements. The ones they'd discussed on the forum and to which Amira was referring when she specifically asked about the one way ticket she'd bought.\n\nAndrew even backs this up in a roundabout way when he says that he thought if she was denied entry into Mexico, she'd be on an airplane, not in detention. What airplane, Andrew? When was the next flight to Amsterdam or Paris? Do you think they charter a trans-Atlantic flight to deport one single person? Or do you think they put them on the next available flight? Were there multiple flights daily between CDMX and Amsterdam/Paris during the summer Covid lockdowns? Where do you think they keep people who are not admitted to a country? The hotel down the street (.... in the country they've been denied entry to)? In the terminal Tom Hanks style?\n\nSo, spare me the victim act, guys. Own your mistake or at a minimum, stop trying to scare others off. Mexico didn't do this to you, this travel plan wasn't \"dangerous\", you messed up when you figured you were an exception to a foreign country's immigration laws (or didn't think they were serious) for reasons known only to yourself.\n\nFor those curious about where this may go (Spoilers):\n\nShe does the same thing a few weeks later from Serbia. Link. Makes an airport buddy from Paris to Belgrade, spends 2 weeks in Serbia and departs for JFK and doesn't update again. She did change her profile pic in late September, but her account has since been closed (which doesn't delete posts).\n\nI'm not ruling out that this could all be some massive lie, particularly because the new photo looks professionally done, she at some point asks about an entirely different visa type Link... even though she also asks about what happens if things don't work out with her fiance so who knows what that's about, really.\n\nSo that's it. I have watched this show from Day 1 and have been on this sub since before we hit 1,000 users and I have never linked to that website before (was an active user when I was going through the process myself) because I sort of feel it's a bit of a line to cross, mostly because 99.9% of people on there are just normal folks who don't need to get swept up into all this (so do me a solid and leave the bystanders out of it, thanks). But this is SOME BS."
