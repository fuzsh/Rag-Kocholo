Boris constantly refers to \"the old country\" which is where he was brought up. They are quite set in their ways and believe in old methods and remedies.

They do various jobs such as theatre ushers and grocery store clerks.\n\nPaul Gatsby Phil Proctor Paul Gatsby is the creator of the fictional Dummi Bears children's empire. He is based on real-life \"Rugrats\" co-creator Paul Germain. Paul is a generally calm, but stern person. He likes Randy as a writer and his family in general, but he tires of Randy's repetitive writing material with plots. He's rejected a lot of his plots, though in his opinion they were all the same. Susie believed he liked their family so much that he'd buy them a new house every time he enjoyed dinner. However, what Paul most likely did for Randy was try to find new inspiration and write new material. He's a bit disturbed at how all of his neighbors overly enjoy the stupid cartoon and how Chas takes it a bit too seriously (calling it, with good reason, \"mindless\"). While he might enjoy how the Dummi Bears have become a success, he becomes increasingly annoyed with how the DeVille's try to show their over enthusiasm for the show and Drew's attempt to become a business associate with him. Hugh Pickles Jim Ward Hugh, along with his wife Dottie, hosted the Pickles family reunion in Willoughby, Iowa. Hugh is the distant cousin to Drew and Stu. Hugh looks identical to Stu, but has brown hair like Drew's only a little darker and messy looking. He's a farmer, who takes great pride in his crops. Sunflower seeds are the most popular crop, he also has a vast cornfield, a barn to the milk cows and various farm animals. He speaks with a calm country accent and is very friendly to the Pickles family. Their son is Timmy-Ray Pickles, he was 36 Years Old."
