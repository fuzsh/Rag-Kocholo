        "text": "More often than not, a highly hyped, much-anticipated episode of a television show can't live up to expectations. Instead of leaving viewers satisfied, the high hopes lead to disappointment.\n\nSuch is not the case with the hourlong season final of \"Friends.\" You know, \"The One with Ross' Wedding.\" The one taped largely in England. The one that features a cameo appearance by the Duchess of York.This \"Friends\" (Thursday, 7 p.m., Ch. 5) is a genuine hoot - one that fans of the show won't want to miss. And one that might make you into a fan if you aren't already.\n\nRoss (David Schwimmer) is, of course, headed for London to marry his British girlfriend, Emily (Helen Baxendale). And most of the gang is going along, except for Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), who's too pregnant, and Rachel (Jennifer Anniston), who suddenly realizes she's still in love with Ross and tries desperately to get to England to tell him.\n\nOf course, there are other obstacles to the wedding, including a premature wrecking ball at the hall where the ceremony is to take place and a battle over money between Ross' parents - played by Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles - and Emily's parents - played by Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders (\"Absolutely Fabulous\"), who turn in very funny performances in guest appearances.\n\nAs for the rest of the gang, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) roam London as tourists and Monica deals with her own feelings of inadequacy because she's not in a relationship.\n\nIt's all wonderfully written. Even the appearance by the Duchess, Sarah Ferguson, makes sense within the context of the show. And before we reach the last-second cliffhanger, there's a stunning development that will leave fans gasping - one that opens up a whole new vista for next season as well.\n\nIt's not easy to live up to high expectations. But this hourlong \"Friends\" is funny, outrageous, sweet and surprising - all you could possibly hope for and perhaps a bit more.\n\nNEW SPORTSCASTER: KTVX-Ch. 4 is about to make a major substitution in its news lineup - Justin Farmer takes over as the station's main sports anchor, probably toward the end of next week.\n\nFarmer comes to News 4 Utah from CNN/SI (the all-sports news channel) in Atlanta.\n\nCurrent sports guy Carl Arky will do sports reporting for Ch. 4 for the time being. Wesley Ruff remains the weekend sports anchor.\n\nThis is rather unusual - switching one of your main on-air talents in the midst of a sweeps period.\n\nDUH! What eight-letter last name beginning with G does the new consumer reporter at KUTV-Ch. 2 share with a national political figure?\n\nIf you said Gingrich, you're as dumb as I am. Contrary to what you may have read here on Monday, his name is GEPHARDT - Bill Gephardt.\n\nI am, frankly, mortified to have made such a bizarre and stupid error. Maybe it was the result of jet lag. (OK, that's a lousy excuse, but it's all I've got right now and I'm sticking to it.)\n\nBy the way, I really did enjoy Gephardt's report on that supposedly super umbrella."
