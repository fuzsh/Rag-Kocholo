CABELL GREET SURNAMES SURNAMES BY ERNEST WEEKLEY, M.A. •V \" Indeed, there is a woundy luck in names, sirs, And a main mystery, an a man knew where To vind it.\" (BEN JONSON, Tale of a Tub, iv. 2.) LONDON JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET, W. 1916 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED PREFACE THE volume now offered to those who were kind enough to be interested in my Romance of Names is a second offshoot of the Dictionary of English Surnames on which I have been engaged for some years. It differs in several ways from the former booklet. The Romance of Names was an attempt at a general survey of the subject, and, like all such first attempts, it contained a good many inaccuracies and dubious statements 1 of which I have tried to purge later editions. It made no special attempt to deal with the curiosities of surname etymology, and the temptation to explore by-ways was firmly resisted. The present volume treats much more completely, and hence more ponderously, of certain groups of sur- names which I have investigated with some approach to thoroughness. It includes a very large proportion of names of etymological interest,2 the majority of 1 Sometimes due to accepting definite statements of my pre- decessors ; e.g. Bardsley says, \" It is a well-known fact that Haddock is an imitative variant of Haydock.\" It may be, but John Haddok (Fine R., Close R., and City B.) shows that it was also a nickname c. 1300. There are so many \" well-known facts \" that become fictions when tested with a little evidence. 2 Many of these are so odd and fantastic that I may be suspected of having invented them, but, with perhaps half a dozen doubtful v VI PREFACE which have not been mentioned by earlier writers, and hardly any of which have been hitherto explained. Its relation to the Romance of Names is that of a more or less erudite treatise to a primer, matter which in the former book was dismissed in a paragraph or two being here expanded into a chapter. This involves a certain amount of repetition which I hope may be forgiven. As the theories and etymologies proposed are to a great extent novel, I have thought it well to give some of the data on which they are based. Consequently the book will be found duller than its predecessor, and will, I fear, have little attraction for any but the sur- name enthusiast. The author's own inclination, suc- cessfully fought against, was to give for each name a mass of evidence, variants and early examples, which most readers would rather be spared. The method actually followed has been the rather unsatisfactory compromise of giving evidence and foreign parallels in a certain number of cases, and the author cannot hope that this has been done with much system or consistency. After the alternative plans had been considered of relegating the medieval examples to footnotes or to an appendix, it was finally decided to insert them in square brackets after the modern names to which they refer, an arrangement which will perhaps irritate the rapid reader without satiating the student. The chief sources of these early examples are cases, every English name printed in italic type and included in the index is, or was as late as the nineteenth century, actually existent in this country. PREFACE vii enumerated on pp. xvi-xvii, but many other documents have been consulted and are indicated with more or less fullness when quoted.1 To my colleague Mr. E. L. Guilford, Lecturer in History at University College, Nottingham, I am indebted for many medieval names drawn chiefly from unpublished Midland records. It will be noticed that a native or foreign parallel has often been preferred to direct evidence. This arises out of the comparative method which I have adopted, the only method which can lead to results of any value. The index contains some six thousand existing sur- names, including a certain proportion of French and German names and a sprinkling from other countries. In the body of the book appear probably almost an equal number of names which are presumably extinct, though, as a matter of fact, it is never safe to assume this even in the case of the most fantastic name. No student of the subject would be seriously startled at finding Long shanks and Strongbow dwelling side by side in 1 To date exactly each example would have involved an amount of labour and verification incommensurate with the result. The source quoted usually shows the century. The great majority of the examples come from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and names later than 1338 are as a rule dated. The names are given just as they occur, except that baptismal names, when their form is not in question, are normalized, while / and v are put for i and « where these latter are consonants. I have also occasionally, for the sake of clearness, added to final -e the acute accent which was unknown to the Middle Ages. The county is also sometimes given when the habitat of the name is in question, but readers in search of an ancestor should notice that in many cases the county is simply that in which the bearer of the name happened to be hanged. viii PREFACE some remote village, though he would experience some- thing of the exultation of a naturalist encountering a dodo in Kensington Gardens. The author's excuse for publishing this second instalment of his harmless researches is that the end of his Dictionary, like that of all similar undertakings, has a way of receding as it is approached. It seemed possible that information representing the leisure amusement of several years might be doomed to the waste-paper basket by harassed executors, in which case some students of the English language might be the losers.1 The \" practical man,\" when his attention is accident- ally directed to the starry sky, appraises that terrific spectacle with a non-committal grunt ; but he would receive with a positive snort any suggestion that the history of European civilization is contained in the names of his friends and acquaintances. Still, even the practical man, if he were miraculously gifted with the power of interpreting surnames, could hardly negotiate the length of Oxford Street on a motor-bus without occasionally marvelling and frequently chuck- ling. As a review of my former book puts it— \" We go about our dignified proceedings, solemnly addressing each other by the names of beasts and birds and kitchen implements ; we are dressed like savages in fantastic feathers, and the most important list of honoured personages contains a set of nicknames graceless enough to keep us laughing for a month \" (The Times, February 22, 1914). 1 See p. 22. PREFACE ix I should like to thank by name all the friendly cor- respondents who have, often at real cost of time and labour, sent me information on the subject of surnames ; but the list would fill several pages. So I must limit myself to saying in the words of Captain Grose that — \" Several gentlemen (and ladies), too respectable to be named on so trifling an occasion, have also contributed their assistance.\" ERNEST WEEKLEY.

THE study of surnames in England is chiefly asso- ciated with the names of Camden, Lower, Ferguson, and Bardsley, though many other writers have dealt with the subject, or with special aspects of it, both in books and magazine articles. Of these Camden, the first in date (Remains concerning Britain, 1605), is still in many ways the best. His brief essay, weak as it necessarily is from the philological point of view, gives by far the clearest and most sensible introduction to the subject that has yet been penned. The first attempt at anything like a comprehensive Dictionary of Surnames is Lower's Patronymica Britannica (Lond. 1860), which contains some 12,000 names. He had previously published English Sur- names (Lond. 1842, 4th ed., enlarged, 1875). Lower seems to have been a genial antiquary, with a good deal of miscellaneous information, but no serious know- ledge of European languages. On the surnames of his •2 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES native county, Sussex, he has often good first-hand information, but outside that he is quite untrust- worthy. He knew, however, something about the general history of surnames and had read all that had already been written in English on the subject. Some of his suggested etymologies are rather funny, and in many cases he does not seem to have taken the trouble even to open the Gazetteer. A couple of examples will suffice — \" Bickerstaff. The O. Eng. bicker means to skirmish or contend, and a ' bicker-staff,' therefore, probably signifies a weapon analo- gous to a quarter-staff, or single-stick. The name belongs to the same class as Longsword, Broadspear, etc.\" \" Rigmaidcn. Two gentry families, settled respectively in Counties Lincoln and Lancaster, bore this remarkable name, which at the commencement of the present century was still extant. I can give no better etymology for the name than I have already assigned in Eng. Sum. ; viz., ' a romping girl.' \" Now Bickerstaff, formerly Bickerstath (whence Bicker- stcth), is a Lancashire parish near Ormskirk, Rigmaden is a seat in Westmorland, and the local surnames de Bikerstaf and de Riggemaiden can be easily attested from the medieval records of the north. I have noticed- fifteen variants of Bickerstaff in the Lancashire Assize Rolls (1176-1285) and Rigmaiden is also found in several forms. Similarly, Lower explains Fifehead as from a promontory in Scotland, whereas Fifehead, formerly Five-hide, is a place in Dorset, in which county Fifehead. Fifdt is a common surname. But there is a good deal of useful antiquarian, as distin- guished from etymological, information to be gleaned from Lower, and his rather ponderous good-humour does not excite the irritation which is evoked by the confident imbecilitv of some of his successors. EARLY THEORISTS 3 Lower was followed by Ferguson, author of English Surnames and their Place in the Teutonic Family, The Teutonic Name System, and Surnames as a Science. He was by trade a cotton-spinner, by inclination an amateur philologist, and eventually a Member of Parliament. Like most people who dabble in the study of German, he was struck by its similarity to English, and jumped to the conclusion that our surname system, like our language, was chiefly of Teutonic origin.1 In other words, he became the victim of a fixed idea, a more deadly enemy in philo- logical matters than ignorance itself. The consequence is that his Surnames as a Science 2 bears some resem- blance to an elaborate lark, which begins by amusing, but soon palls. It is, of course, true that thousands of our surnames can be traced to personal names which were in use in Anglo-Saxon times, but, to establish such connection, it is just as well to supply a little in the way of evidence. For Ferguson it is quite sufficient to find a somewhat similar Anglo- Saxon name in Kemble 3 or Thorpe,4 or, failing these sources, an Old German name in Forstemann,5 or, failing Forstemann, in his own imagination, to ex- plain Tom, Dick, and Harry as coming straight from the Twilight of the Gods into the London Commercial Directory. So Thompson, whom the ignorant might connect with Thomas, is really the son of doom ! That a surname is obviously taken from a trade does 1 Which it is, of course, though not as Ferguson understood it. 2 Second edition, revised, London, 1884. 3 Codex diplomaticus JEvi Saxonici, London, 1845-8. * Diplomatorium Anglicum JEvi Saxonici, London, 1815. 5 Altdeutsches Namenbuch : part i, Personennamen, Nordhausen, 1856. 4 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES not disturb him. Archer, Ircmongcr, and Prentice, which are recorded by hundreds as \" le archere,\" \" le iremonger.\" \" le prentice,\" are \" Old Prankish \" names, \" and the resemblance to anything English is only an accident.\" Archer, we learn, is from OG. Erchcar, Iremonger is related to Arminius the Cherus- kcrfiirst, and Prentice comes from \" an \" AS. Premtsa. An unrecorded Old German name is just as useful for his purpose as one copiously attested. It is only a case of \" not yet turned up,\" a phrase that recurs constantly in his book. Occasionally the intrusive place-name annoys him, but only for a moment. Prcndergast is derived from an imaginary Pendgast, \" an ancient compound, from the stem bend, with gasi, hospes.\" A footnote admits that it may perhaps, however, be from a Welsh place-name (as of course it is), but it \" illustrates the principle just the same.\" A contemporary, and to some extent a disciple, of Ferguson, Dr. Charnock, published in 1868 a small lexicon of unusual surnames under the title Ludus Patronymicus, or the Etymology of Curious Names. On Shakespeare he gives us the following remarks — \" I have elsewhere (see Xotcs and Queries, vols. ix. and x.), stated that Shakespeare might be a corruption of Sigisbert, which would translate ' renowned for victory ' (sige, victory) ; in answer to which Mr. Ferguson seemed to think that the name might be from Sicisper, Sigispcr, or Sigiper, which he would translate ' vic- torious bear ' (perhaps rather ' victorious man '). My suggestion would seem probable from the fact that the name Shakcshaft might be from Sigishaft, Sighaft, used by the Franks for ' victorious.' or from Sigishaved, ' head of victory,' ' victorious leader.' I am, however, disposed to think that the latter name is merely a corruption of Shakestatl ; and, as I have shown elsewhere, most names compounded of staff are derived from AS. stcd, a place. On further consideration I am inclined to doubt my former derivation CRAZY ETYMOLOGY 5 of the name Shakespeare, although it would easily corrupt from Sigisbert, by contraction of the first vocable, and by dropping of the final t. I agree with another correspondent of Notes and Queries in tracing the name to Jacques Pierre. . . . The nearest names to Jacques Pierre that I have been able to find are James Peters, Jacques Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and Petrus Jacobus.\" Perhaps, after all, it is only the gentleman's fun. Theories every whit as crazy are constantly put for- ward by amateur philologists. A few years ago I read in Notes and Queries that Jennins is of Norse origin and means the \" iron man/' and that this family gave its name to Jenningham, now corrupted into Birmingham ! This statement easily beats the famous definition of the crab both in quality and on points. More recently, in the same publication, the suggestion was made that the puzzling name Shillito or Silito was from the medieval \" de Sigillo.\" Even if this were phonetically possible, the theorist should have sup- ported his case with modern names corrupted from Molendinarius, Albo Monasterio, Veteri Ponte, or Sexdecim Vallibus. In fact, the study of English surnames, being a region of knowledge which has never been scientifically explored, is a regular happy hunting-ground for the unauthorized amateur. Even men of learning, who should know how dangerous it is to stray from their own sphere of knowledge, occasionally trespass dis- astrously. I have recently read a most interesting and informative article on the \" Place of the Wood- pecker in Religion,\" the author of which points out quite rightly that many of our surnames go back to instincts surviving from this prehistoric cult. But when he proceeds to tell us that the name Pcckover 6 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES is the OF. pic vert, green woodpecker, we are re- minded of those guileless etymologists who derive the Oxfordshire Shotover from chateau vert, while the suggestion that Woodhatch (Surrey) takes its name from the woodhack, or woodpecker, makes us wonder whether there is some similar explanation for Colney Hatch. The documentary study of surnames began with Bardsley, who shifted the field of investigation from the migration of the Aryans to the Middle Ages. He realized that practically all our surnames came definitely into existence between the Norman Con- quest and the end of the fourteenth century. His English Surnames l contains a wealth of material drawn from various medieval sources, and his Dic- tionary of English and Welsh Surnames, published (Oxford, 1901) from his notes after his death, contains a valuable, though often wrongly grouped and wrongly interpreted, collection of authentic instances. Among all who have written on the subject, he appears to be the only one who knows that there are such things as chronology and evidence, and, where he goes wrong, it is simply from ignorance of medieval languages. I have given a few examples in the preface to my Romance of Names. Similar blunders are to be found on almost every page of his Dictionary, but it would be ungracious to insist on them. Personally I have derived the greatest help from his work, and, though I have never, when possible, used one of his instances without verifying it, I have often been guided to the origin of a name by his copious provision of early examples, liis Dictionary is especially valuable for 1 Seventh edition, London, 1901. VARIOUS SOURCES 7 the later history of names, because of the careful study of church registers by which he is often able to show the identity of surnames which have become widely divergent. This part of the subject can only be nibbled at by one individual, and a real Diction- ary of Surnames cannot come into existence until every county has been thoroughly documented by competent investigators. The study of surnames is, for historical reasons, more complicated in England than in any other Euro- pean country. In all European nations there is a strong foreign element, especially in frontier regions, but our Directory is perhaps the greatest hodge- podge of all. Taking the various elements in chro- nological order, we have first the \" Celtic fringe,\" names from which (Gaelic, Welsh, Irish, Manx, Cor- nish) are now to be found in every corner of Eng- land. In fact, it is quite possible that the real old Welsh names (Cradock, Enmon, Traherne, etc.), now replaced largely by the unimaginative Jones,1 Hughes, etc., are more numerous in England than in their native country. Tten come the race whom we call traditionally the Anglo-Saxons, and from whom those few of us whose ancestors neither came over with the Conqueror nor escaped miraculously from the Massacre of St. Bartholomew are mostly descended. In the East and North, in Scotland, and sporadically 1 The AIDE, contains the names of 196 landholders in the Isle of Anglesey whose name begins with /, and every single one of them is Jones. The same phenomenon is observed in other coun- tries in which the adoption of fixed surnames is comparatively recent. Thus in Sweden about one-half of the population is ac- counted for by some fifteen patronymics of the type Olsen (Olaf), Jakobsen, Peter sen, etc. 8 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES all round the outer edge of the islands, names of Norse l origin are abundant ; and these, from the strictly philological point of view, should be divided into East Scandinavian and West Scandinavian. With 1066 we have the Norman irruption, and, through the centuries, a constant percolation from various French provinces,2 culminating in the great Huguenot invasion of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. On the East coast Dutch and Danish names are not uncommon ; while London, as the commercial focus of the world, has for centuries attracted immi- grants from various European countries, many of whom have been fruitful and have multiplied. In quite recent times there has been a steady peaceful penetration from Germany, and London and our manufacturing towns are largely colonized by this energetic race, no doubt destined to be the ruling class of the future.3 But, difficult as is the task of classifying and deriv- ing English surnames, it is nothing compared with that offered by American surnames. In the States the wear and tear of names, whicfc in England extends over ten centuries, has been concentrated into one, and instead of half a dozen elements we have sources innumerable. In the early days of the Republic the problem was simpler, for the sparse population was drawn from practical!}' four sources, British, Dutch, French, and German. In the earliest census taken, it 1 I have described all names found before the Conquest as Anglo- Saxon, but many of them are really Norse. Those interested should study Bjorkman. 2 French names are particularly common in Devon, a result no doubt of intercourse with the Channel Islands. 3 This was written before the War. SURNAME GROUPS 9 is interesting to notice the distribution of these names.1 We find, as we should expect, the French in the south, the Dutch in and around New York, and the Germans in Pennsylvania. But, since the time of the first census (1790), immigrants have crowded in from most countries, civilized and uncivilized, and their changed, distorted, or adapted names form a pathless etymo- logical morass. Even in 1790 one is struck by the prevalence of crude and grotesque nicknames, often obvious perversions of foreign names, but frequently, no doubt, deliberately assumed by, or conferred on, men who had cut even the surnominal tie with Europe. In one respect only are our English surnames easier to trace than those of continental countries. The possible variants and derivatives of any given personal name run theoretically into thousands, and in France and Germany, to take the two most important countries of which the surname system is related to our own, there has been no check on this process of differentiation. By contraction, aphesis, apocope, dia- lect variation, and many other phonetic factors, one favourite name often develops hundreds of forms, many of which appear to have nothing in common with the original. Thus Ger. Nolle can be traced step by step to OG. Arinwald, eagle mighty. The Old German names passed into France, underwent a new phonetic development, and were again varied ad infmitum. Thus Naudot is also from OG. Arinwald, which became Fr. Arnaud, whence, by aphesis, Naud, and, with the dim. suffix, Naudot. This dim. suffix again, which 1 A Century of Population Growth in the United States (1790- 1900), Washington, 1909. A copy of this elaborate and valuable work was most kindly sent to me by G. F. Parker, Esq., of New York, formerly U.S. Consul in Birmingham. io THE STUDY OF SURNAMES many other names share with Naudot, became, by a second aphcsis, Dot, and then, with a new dim. suffix, Dottin. Many such series could be quoted among modern French surnames, e.g. Hanotanx, for Hanotot, from Hanot, from Han, from Jehan, i.e. John; or Denis, Dem sard, Nisard, Sard, Sardou. Now, in England, the parallel process was suddenly interrupted by the Norman Conquest. The Anglo- Saxon names which persisted remained in a state of arrested development and seldom formed familiar derivatives. Those which seem to form exceptions do so because the corresponding name existed in Old French and thus preserved a vitality which the Anglo- Saxon form had lost. Thus, Rawle, Rawlins, Raw/tins, etc., belong to Fr. Raoul, from OG. Radwulf, counsel wolf, and our Tibbs, Tibbets, Tibbies, etc., derive from the Fr. Thibaut, OG. Theodobald, people strong, rather than from the cognate AS. Theodbeald, a rather rare name. From the Conquest the favourite names were French names of Germanic origin, e.g. William, Robert, Richard, or Biblical names, e.g. John, Thomas, Peter, of Greco-Latin or Eastern origin, and generally in- troduced in a French form. Nomenclature thus made a fresh start, and this start falls within historic and well-documented times. Practically all our surname groups of baptismal origin date from after the Con- quest and have no direct or conscious connection with their Anglo-Saxon or Celtic cognates. Taking at hazard, from vol. ii. of the Hundred Rolls, a list of people from various counties described as sons of Adam, we iind that the font-names represented are Clement, Eustace, Geoffrey, Gregory, Henry, Hugh, Humphrey, John, Nicholas, Peter, Philip, Ralph, CLASSES OF SURNAMES n Richard, Robert, Roger, Simon, Thomas, William, not one of which was in real English use before the Battle of Hastings. But a close study of the cartularies of ancient manors and abbeys reveals the survival of thousands of Anglo-Saxon names among the peasantry, and most of them still exist. They do not, however, form groups of derivatives. Even when Anglo-Saxon names survived as such, they were often affected in sound by the Norman pronunciation, for it must be remembered that, during the period of formation of our surnames, French was the official language and a considerable proportion of the population was bilingual. For in- stance, Alphege is the Norman form of Elphick, AS. ^Elfheah, and the v of Elvin (/Elf wine), Colvin (Ceol- wine), is due to the same influence. Wace makes Edward into Ewart, a name which has other origins, and Leofwin into Lewin — \" Lewine e Guert furent od lui \" (Roman de Rou, 7857). The font-name is, strictly speaking, the only true name, the other classes of surnames, patronymic, occupative, or nickname, being descriptions, while the local surname is an address. Of all surnames those of local origin are of least interest, difficult though it often is to recognize the village or homestead in its archaic, distorted, or popular form (see chap. iv.). Probably at least half of our surnames are of the dull, unimaginative local kind,1 but their etymological 1 It is rather curious that a few names of this type should have acquired an aristocratic flavour. Cholmondeleyis simply the \" lea \" of Ceolmund, who is now usually Coleman, and Ponsonby is the \" by,\" or homestead, of Punshon. The exclusive Carlton represents the most commonplace of our village names, Ceorl's, or the churl's, \" tun,\" or homestead. 3 12 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES explanation belongs to the student of place-names. As there is hardly a spot in England which has not given its name to a family, it follows that a complete etymological dictionary of English surnames would have to include a complete etymological dictionary of place-names, i.e. that one impossibility can only be achieved by the preliminary accomplishment of an- other. The study of these names would have to be carried on by counties or regions. If a circle, with say a ten-mile radius, were drawn on an ordnance map round a city such as Nottingham, it would be found that all the village-names in that circle existed in the town or county as medieval surnames. With the en- largement of the circle, these names would thin out in number and become more corrupted in form, until, except for their accidental appearance here and there in modern England, they would fade away like the last ripple produced by a stone in the water. A profound historical knowledge of the earlier forms and of the local pronunciation would of course be essential for the study of these names. In investigating the origins of names we can work either backwards or forwards. The field is immense and the materials are available in overwhelming mass. Lower seems to have used as general sources only Domesday Book and the Hundred Rolls, the latter a kind of later Domesday Book compiled in 1273. These are perhaps the two most valuable documents we have, because they give not only the name but the locality in which it occurs. But there are many other sources of hardly less value. For pre-Conquest names we have Searle's Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum, a com- plete list of names extracted from all manner of SOURCES 13 sources, including the earlier compilations of Birch, Thorpe, Kemble, etc. After Domesday Book (1086) the most important sources are, for the twelfth century, the Pipe Rolls, beginning in 1158, and, for the thir- teenth century, the four great series of the Charter Rolls and Fine Rolls, from 1199, the Patent Rolls, from 1202, and the Close Rolls, from 1205. The earlier parts of these were printed in extenso early in the nineteenth century, and they are now continued in the form of Calendars, i.e. abstracts. Then we have the In- quisitiones post Mortem, from 1216, a number of minor rolls and documents dealing with special regions, and the numerous local records published by various antiquarian societies, such as the Camden, Chetham, Surtees, and Lancashire and Cheshire Record Societies. These latter sources are especially rich for the north of England, but most counties have now their anti- quarian societies, from the Transactions of which any amount of information can be acquired. An ordinary lifetime would not suffice for the investigation of a fraction of the superabundant material, and the con- tribution of any individual to the subject must necessarily be but a drop in the ocean. The Rolls are nearly always written in medieval Latin, but the names which occur in them are put promiscuously in latinized form, e.g. Johannes Arcu- balistarius, English, John the Arblaster, or Anglo- French, Jehan le Arbalestier. There is nothing like uniformity of spelling. Even a monosyllable like Bruce has dozens of forms, and in one north-country document I have noted fifteen spellings of so simple a name as Bradshaw. This applies, of course, equally to the spelling of other words, but while this has now 14 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES been normalized by a kind of collective effort and the authority of the printer, the differentiation in the spelling ' of names has gone on unchecked. From about the middle of the fourteenth century the records become of less etymological value, because the significant prefixes, le and de, del, atte, etc., tend to disappear. But even in the earliest Rolls caution is necessary. Many accidents and misunderstandings may have occurred between the verbal communica- tion made by the medieval peasant to the government official, who often had difficulty in understanding him, and the printed copy or abstract which we now pos- sess. It is never safe to draw inferences from isolated entries, which may be original mistakes, errors in transcription, misreadings of medieval contractions, or modern misprints. Le is constantly confused with de, especially in the Hundred Rolls, and in the earlier issues of the other series, and de is also often found prefixed to obvious nicknames and personal names which can be certified from much earlier records.' The entries are to a great extent artificial. The common patronymics in -s and -son rarely occur, and the font- names are given in full instead of in the abridged form actually in use. We find Egidius f. Waltarii for Giles Watson, and Reginaldus, Dionysius, Petronilla, and Theophania for people who were certainly known to their neighbours as Reynold, Dennis, Parnell, and Tiffen. 1 It is considered a terrible solecism to write of the poet Spencer or of \" rare Ben Johnson,\" but in Westminster Abbey these two spellings may be seen over adjacent tombs. * Some of our county histories are not blameless in this matter, and sprinkle de's in ludicrous fashion among the ancestors of the local gentry. ARTIFICIAL ENTRIES 15 It may be noted here that the nomenclature of the Middle Ages is much more ornate than the super- ficial study of history would suggest. Female names especially have much of the penny novelette about them. I have come across Amanda, Bonajoia, Dulci- bella, Glorietta, Licoricia, Orgoylosa, Orielda, and many others. These gorgeous names seem to have been especially common among the Jews, e.g. the four Jewesses mentioned in vol. xxxiii. of the Pipe Rolls are Belleases, Duzelina, Pulcella, and Regina. In a great many cases it is impossible to say whether a modern name is a patronymic or a metronymic, for most of the male medieval font-names had feminine form also, e.g. Almarica, Alwina, Clementia, Eustachia, Huelina, Theobalda, etc., and, as in modern times, we sometimes find a female font-name manufactured from that of the father or ancestor, e.g. Lescelina, daughter of Matthew f. Leising (Lane. Inq., 1205- 1307), the latter gentleman's \" by,\" or farmstead, having been the home of the Lazenby family. Occupative names given in Latin or French form have sometimes persisted (Faber, Bullinger], but we may be sure that Ricardus Molinarius or Richard le Mouner was generally in private life Dick Miller. There are few commoner entries than Cocus and le Keu, both now represented by Cook.1 The same is true of nicknames. Many a modern WMtehead descends from a Blanchef or Blaunkfrunt of the Rolls, and the Caprons of to-day are far less numerous than those of the Middle Ages, most of whom were simply Hoods. The form which any name takes in the Rolls is due 1 Kew still exists, but is not common, and often conies from Kew in Surrey. 16 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES largely to the personality of the recorder, often doing his best with a population whose dialect was to him a meaningless jargon. Ralph Omnibon (Fine R.) looks like the official interpretation of Allgood, AS. ./Elfgod, and le Petit Chose has a thirteenth-century prototype in Stephen Aliquid whom we find in Cam- bridgeshire in 1273 (Hund. R.}, apparently an un- couth fenman whose name the official compiler gave up as a bad job. The accidental character of modern names is illus- trated by the fact that the same man is often found with more than one description. With Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus we may compare the humbler Adam Kokke in le Grene Pulter (F. of Y.), whose descendants may, along with other possibilities, now be Adams, Cox, Green, or Poulter, and Ricardus le Nouthird de Stanley Porter (ib.), who may now be represented by Richards, Nothard, Stanley, and Porter. So with Ralph Thomasman Fairfax (Pat. R.), Edmund Johanserjaunt Emmesone (ib.), \\Yalter le Hore de Elmham called Starling (City D.), William Jones- someter Burdelays (Pat. R.), Nicholas Rogersserjaunt le Norreys (Cor am Rcge R. 1297), Everard Williamsman Attemersche (ib.), Richard Williamsserjaunt Pykerell (ib.), William Rogereswarener of Beauchamp of Son- day (Pat. R.). John le Cappeler, called \" le prest \" (City B.}, appears in the same volume as John Prest, cappeler (hatter). This brings us to the fact, which may comfort some people, that trade-names were very often nicknames, e.g. Stephen le Espicer, called le Hornere (City E.), William Priour, cossun, i.e. horse- dealer (ib.), John le Naper, King's huntsman (Chart. R. 1259), Elias Webster dictus llarpur (F. of Y.), Walter MODERN SURNAMES 17 le Taillour, vicar of Crediton (Chanc. R.). It is pretty obvious that a man could not be Prentice by trade, nor could the Mawer or Plowman make much of a living by \" mowing \" or \" ploughing \" alone. Many names of this latter type date back to the manorial system, under which tenants had to put in a certain amount of time in mowing, ploughing, hedging, etc., for their masters. Just as a well-established medieval name must have modern representatives, a well-established modern name must occur under some form in medieval records. By a well-established modern name, I do not mean one which is chiefly attested by the contemporary London Directory, or even in our great manufacturing centres, for these may be of Huguenot or later foreign origin, but one that has a regional existence dating back for a few centuries. This brings us to the ques- tion of modern sources. For a general dissertation on surnames the London Directory x is sufficient. For the historical investigation of the subject it is useless. The method must be regional, and a great historical Dictionary of Surnames can only be compiled when the names of every county have been scientifically studied. This task is now being gradually carried out for place-names, and perhaps surnames will one day have their turn. Just as the main features in the political history of a country could be inferred from 1 I generally use the edition of 1842, which, appearing before the conquest, is comparatively free from such misleading forms as Arbiter, Ger. Arbeiter, Freedman, Friedemann, Blooming field, Blumenfeld, Brilleslipper, Briilenschleifer, lens grinder. The modern Directory is full of such names, sometimes half translated, e.g. Althouse, Diamondstein, or fully, e.g. Bathmaker, Brilliants tone, or wrongly, e.g. Coopersmith, Kupferschmied, copper-smith. i8 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES a study of its language alone, so the history of each county and region, political, ethnical,1 and industrial, is imbedded in its surnames. For even now our population is largely stationary in abode. The Welsh milkman comes to London, drives his cart for twenty years, and then builds him- self a snug villa on the coast of Cardigan Bay. If he remains in London, his dynasty generally dies out within a few generations. Moreover, in most families some members, at any rate, remain on the native soil, and there are now probably many people inhabiting the very spot where their ancestors dwelt when Domes- day Book was compiled. It is sometimes thought that all names get to London sooner or later. They may do so, but they do not remain, and I do not believe that half of our surnames of long standing are represented in the London Directory. The name Fillery is a good example of stationary character. The only Fillery 8 I ever heard of used to bowl for Sussex some thirty or forty years ago. From the Percy Cartulary I iind that Henry Filleray or 1 Here is a concrete example. Guppy, Homes of Family Names (P- 53). says, \" The isolated colony of the Norfolk liowells and Powells invites some further explanation.\" I have also been struck by the frequent occurrence of Welsh names in medieval Norfolk. In an early volume of the Patent Rolls I find that Humfrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, complains that while he was absent in Wales on the King's service, assaults were committed on the ser- vants of his household at Norwich. Were there among these ser- vants some Welshmen from the Marches who settled down and married Norfolk wives ? Some such solution is no doubt the true one. In Canada at the present day there are plenty of Macdonalds, Macgregors, etc., who speak French only, being descendants of disbanded Highland soldiers who took to themselves French- Canadian wives in the eighteenth century. * I have since found the name in a casualty list of the Sussex Regiment. LOCAL CHARACTER OF SURNAMES 19 Fyleray, also called Fiz le Rey, i.e. king's son, was a Sussex landholder in the thirteenth century. The casualty lists now being issued tell the same tale. In to-day's (Feb. n, 1915) paper occurs Wyartt, the name of a private in the Suffolks, and, opening Bardsley, I find his first example is Lena Wyard, (Hund. R., Suff.). My own name, which is very un- common, is derived from a village in Northants. It has occurred in the casualty lists as that of a private in the Northamptons. Peverall is found among the Sherwood Foresters, largely recruited from the Peak country. The famous name Paston naturally occurs in the Norfolk Regiment. Hundreds of similar cases could be quoted. It is among the rank and file also that we find the great Norman names (Marmion, Maltravers, etc.), which have almost disappeared from the peerage. The best single source for modern names is un- doubtedly the Return of Owners of Land, officially com- piled in 1873 and generally called the Modern Domes- day Book (MDB.). From the two volumes devoted to England and Wales we find that, contrary to the opinion of the stump orator, the land of the country is held by nearly a million people, the immense majority of whom are small holders of the peasant class. As the return is by counties, it is easy to trace the names regionally in all their forms and corruptions, and to establish the locality in which any given surname first came into existence. Very often we may find the more correct form still borne by the squire and all manner of perversions represented by the cottagers who are his distant cousins. An odd-looking name can often be solved by a comparison with its neigh- bours. When we find Bathos by the side of Bathurst 20 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES we recognize a natural corruption. The last five names in /- in Essex are Judd, Judson, Justums, Jut- son, Jutsum. Here Jud, i.e. Jordan, has given the patronymic Judson, altered to Jutson as Hudson has become Hutson. Then our love of final -m (cf. Bran- som, Hansom, Sansom) has produced Jutsum, from which, with a common metathesis (cf. Cripps for Crisp), we get the new patronymic Justums. When we find Phizacklea in Lancashire, we hardly need the intermediate Phizakarley, or the imitative Fitzackerley, to guide us to the original Fazakerley, the name of an ancient parish now absorbed in Liverpool. In the East Riding we find Mainprice in the same locality as the perverted Mamprize, and even Mempriss, Mim- press, Mainpidge. If a name occurs in isolation, and no rapprochement with characteristic names of the county is possible, we have to do with an immigrant whose kin must be sought elsewhere. In this way we can to some extent cover the same ground which would be explored in the impossible undertaking of examining the parish registers of the whole country. As a matter of fact, many of the surnames which seem to defy interpretation are found copiously represented in special districts. A few hours devoted to turning over the leaves of the MDB., or even a glance at Guppy, reveals the existence of numbers of unfamiliar names which surprise by their forbidding uncouthness. The explanation is that they represent the name of some medieval homestead, swallowed up centuries ago by the growth of towns, or even some field-name ; or they may spring from some dialect word which had died out before dialects became a matter of interest. Some of them might be solved LOCAL DISTRIBUTION OF SURNAMES 21 by local antiquaries, but they defy the philologist. Such are Benjafield, which swarms in Dorset, Bosom- worth, common in Yorkshire, Cudlipp,1 found all over Devon, Enticknap, common in Surrey and Sussex, and the great Cumberland name Routledge. Altogether local distribution must be taken into account in proposing an etymology. Bardsley derives Godsall, Godsell from Godshill (Isle of Wight) ; but it is almost entirely a Gloucestershire and Herefordshire name [Geoffrey de Godeshale, Fine R., Glouc.]. In Norfolk and Suffolk we find Garwood existing strongly side by side with Garrood, Garrod, Garrett. This sug- gests that Garwood, sometimes local (garth wood), is in these counties also the representative of AS. Gserweard, with a change such as we find in Grimwood from Grimweard. The northern Yarwood is the same name. In the same region we find the similar parallelism of Legwood, Legood, Leggott, all probably from AS. Leod- geard, of which Leggett is the regular diminutive. Gaunt has two well-attested origins, the gaunt [Gilbert le Gant, Fine R.], and of Ghent [Richard de Gaunt, City F.]. But the home of the name is Lincolnshire, which is also, as a fen country, one of the great centres of bird nicknames. In that county the crested grebe is called the gannet, or gant, and hence we may conclude that most of the Lincolnshire Gannts take their name from the bird — \" These birds frequent . . . the great east fen in Lincolnshire, where they are called gaimts \" (Pennant). The fairly common name Bray has two quite clear local origins, viz. from one of the many places in France 1 This may be identical with Cittcliff, common in the same county, but neither is this a specific place-name. 22 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES called Bray, and from Bray in County Wicklow [Robert de Bree, provost de Develine,1 Doc. III.]. No doubt Bray in Berks must also be considered. But the great home of the Brays is Cornwall, and Benedict le Bray (Close R., Cornwall) shows it to be a nickname from a Cornish adjective meaning \" fine, brave.\" Finally, in dealing with nicknames, it must be remembered that, extraordinary and numerous as medieval nicknames are, many of them have gone unrecorded. As we have seen (p. 16), many indi- viduals, in fact perhaps the majority, had four names, of the type John Wilson at Town's End Saddler. But most John Wilsons had a fifth name, such as Whitehead, Shorthose, Nightingale, or Dolittle, and this fifth name stood the poorest chance, as a rule, of getting into official records. Therefore, although no solution of a name can be accepted as final without documentary evidence, it is at least probable that no common adjective or noun that could conceivably be used as a nickname is altogether absent from our surname list. The study of surnames may be regarded as a harm- less pastime or as a branch of learning. As a pastime it is as innocent as stamp-collecting, and possibly as intellectual. As a branch of learning it is an inex- haustible, and hitherto practically unworked, mine of philological knowledge. A complete dictionary of English surnames would not only form a valuable supplement to the NED., but would in a great measure revolutionize its chronology. This may seem of little practical importance at a time when our leaders of science, 'a word which used to mean knowledge, are exhorting us in unattractive English to do away with 1 Dublin, hence the common Irish Devlin. NAMES OLDER THAN WORDS 23 \" ce vieux fatras de grec et de latin \" and bend all our efforts on transforming the rising generation into a nation of super-plumbers. l But among the little band of attardes who rally round the tattered flag of intellectual pursuits, there will always be some to whom the study of our glorious language will have an irresistible appeal. Now language consists of words, and the oldest articulate words are names. It is more or less an accident that some of these, having become proper names, are excluded from the dictionaries. Others still discharge a double function and are equally the prey of the lexicographer and the name-hunter. Dictionaries draw, as a rule, on literary sources, i.e. on language which has already reached a somewhat artificial phase of evolution, but in the names and nicknames of the Middle Ages we hear the every- day speech of our ancestors, a disconnected speech perhaps, and without that thread of continuity which enables us to trace the dictionary word back through the centuries, but all the same a speech which is generally far older than literary records. Among words which occur as surnames in this volume there are few of which the examples do not ante-date by some centuries the earliest records in the NED. This applies especially to obsolete or dialect topographical words2 (ch. iii.), and to trade-names1 (ch. v.). 1 These gentlemen are apparently unaware that the uncanny efficiency of the Germans is not due to the neglect of \" useless \" studies. Even in such a by-way of knowledge as the study of surnames, almost the only work that can be taken seriously has been done by Germans or German-trained philologists. a See, for instance, Borstall (p. 54), Fostall (p. 60). 3 The NED. has cheesemonger (c. 1510), quilter (1563), charwoman (1596). The first two are surnames in the Pipe R. for 1186, and Alice Charwoman lived in Nottingham in the fourteenth century. 24 THE STUDY OF SURNAMES But there is hardly a noun or an epithet which can be used as a nickname, apart from the everyday Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, which is not found in the Rolls long before its first appearance in literature. The nocturnal mammal called a \"bat\" is usually bakke in Middle English, and this is one origin of the name Back [Henry le Bak, Coram Rege R. 1297]— \" Moldewarpis and baches, var. rere-myis \" (Wye. 7s. ii. 20). The NED. dates the form bat from c. 1575. But it is a common thirteenth-century nickname [Geoffrey le Bat, Fine R., Reginald le Bat, Hund, R.], and of course one origin of Bait. l The study of surnames also reveals the existence of a large Anglo-French vocabulary which is other- wise almost unrecorded. These words must have been colloquially current during the period when the two elements were in process of fusion. In the long run they were rejected in favour of the native equivalents and dropped out of the language, except in so far as they had become fossilized as surnames. Examples of such words will be found passim in this volume, but they are chiefly illustrated by nicknames taken from adjectives or derived from names of birds and beasts. These two great classes of surnames, which would require a volume to themselves, are not included in the present work. One, unfortunately obsolete, nickname of this type may, however, be men- tioned here. Our familiar \" pussy-cat,\" a word that 1 Also from Bartholomew and from the AS. Beorht- names. Probably also an archaic spelling of \" boat \" [Stephen del Bat, Close R.}', cf. Barge, Galley, etc. (p. 171). Bateman is no doubt sometimes for \" boatman.\" AN EARLY OCCURRENCE 25 we should expect to find in popular use long before it was put down in black and white, is a modernized \" puss-cat \" \" Micia, a pusse-kat, a kitlin \" (Florio). The NED. first finds it in 1565. But it was a sur- name three centuries earlier — \" Ilyf le Messer vulneravit Robertum Pusekat juxta pontem de Corebrigge, ita quod statim obiit \" (Northumb. Ass. R. 1256). CHAPTER II THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM \" It seemeth to have been the manner, at giving of names, to wish the children might perform and discharge their names, as when Gunthram, King of the French, named Clotharius at the font, he said, ' Crescat puer et hujus sit nominis executor ' \" (CAMDEN). THE names in use among all the Germanic races, including Scandinavia and Iceland, go back to that period in the history of the world when all men seem to have been poets. When we consider the beauty of the oldest of these names, their picturesque connec- tion with gods and heroes, war and the wilds, and with the great elementary abstract concepts which we no longer understand, and compare with them the name creations of the Romans, and still more of the Middle Ages, commonplace, prosaic, spiteful, or obscene, we feel thankful that there was once an age of poetic bandits and imaginative pirates. These Teutonic names were originally all dithemetic,1 i.e. each name 1 This very natural formation is common to the Aryan races, with the rather striking exception of the Romans. The chief Celtic names exemplify it, e.g. Donald, world-wielder, \" much the same meaning as Dumnorix \" (Macbain), Dugald, black stranger, i.e. Dane, Duncan, brown warrior, Morgan, sea-white. It is seen also in Oriental names, such as the Biblical Absalom, father of peace, Jeremiah, exalted of the Lord, Jonathan, the Lord's gift. This latter is a very favourite combination ; cf. Godiva (Godgifu), Theodore, Dorothea, Deodatus, Dieudonn6, etc. So also in Arabic 26 THE DITHEMETIC TYPE OF NAME 27 consisted of two elements, e.g. Alfred, fairly counsel, and there can be no doubt that in the earliest times the elements were understood by those who bore the names, as were the Greek names which they so strik- ingly resemble in structure and spirit. This resem- blance has often been pointed out, e.g. Godwin, God friend, Theophilus, Folkard, people strong, Demos- thenes, Sebert, Sebright, victory bright, Nicophanes. At the period with which our historical documents deal, these names had largely ceased to have a real meaning. The elements of which they were composed were drawn chiefly from the archaic and poetic lan- guage and these elements were often combined so as to make no sense. A very common practice in naming children was to compound the name from that of the father and mother, somewhat after the practice fol- lowed by modern racehorse owners. Or one element persisted in a family, e.g. in the six generations from Edward the Elder to Edgar Atheling practically all the kings and royal princes have names in Ead, bliss. The elements are juxtaposed without anything to show their grammatical relationship, so that in interpreting them one can only indicate the general idea which each half expressed. Still, there are many examples of these compound names which still occur in Anglo-Saxon poetry as common nouns, e.g. Gold wine, gold friend, whence our surname Gold-win,1 is Abdallah means \" servant of God \" (cf. AS. Godescealc), Saladin is \" honour of the faith,\" and Nureddin, the name of the Turkish commander in Mesopotamia, means \" light of the faith.\" 1 Hence also Jeudwin, an Anglo-French form [Richard Joldewin or Jeudewyne, IpAf.]. Jawdewin's Lane, Oxford, was perhaps named after Richard Jeodewyne, who is mentioned in the Godstow Cartulary, 4 28 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM used of a liberal patron, Heremann, army man, whence Harman, means a warrior, Maegcnheard, might hard, our Maynard, is found as an adjective in the sense of strong . Of the names dealt with here the great majority are common to the Teutonic languages, with certain small differences according as the forms are German, Scandinavian, or English. Some belong especially to one or other of these language groups, e.g. the names which contain the elements Brand, flame, sword, Cytel, cauldron, are Scandinavian, while those in -nand, bold, e.g. Ferdinand, are continental and of rare occurrence in Anglo-Saxon. In the following paragraphs I give the names in the normalized West- Saxon spelling, from Searle's Onomasticon Anglo- Saxonicum, calling attention occasionally to the Norse or continental forms and the surnames which they have produced in English and other languages. I have already (Romance of Names, ch. vii.) mentioned a number of obvious examples. Here I have rather selected those of which the origin is not immediately apparent or which have an unusual appearance. The great variation in the modern English forms is due to many accidents of time and place, but chiefly to the fact that the same name has often reached us through different channels — English, Erencli, and Flemish. Possibly some of them are really Celtic names which have assumed an imitative form. It is thought, for\" in stance, that Cerdic may be for Cradock, Caractacus. If this is so, Scott was doubly unfortunate in choosing a Welsh name for a typical Anglo-Saxon and then turning it into the ghost-name Cediic. The Teutonic name-system was carried into every MALE AND FEMALE NAMES 29 corner of Europe, first by the Vikings, and later by those valiant Norman knights who were in the habit of setting out with a handful of followers to carve themselves out a kingdom. Thus Roderick, fame mighty, is found as wide apart as Wales (Prothero,Ryrie, Prytherick) and Russia (Rurik), and has named such national heroes as the Spanish Cid (Don Rodrigo), Roderick Dhu, and Rory O'More. For fuller informa- tion on the historic warriors and saints who caused certain names to be popular in special regions those interested should consult Charlotte Yonge's Christian Names, a book which contains a vast amount of learn- ing couched in gracious form, though the etymological theories put forward are sometimes inaccurate and out of date. Most of the elements l used in these names can be put indifferently first or last, e.g. Hereric, whence Herrick, Richere, whence Richer, Reacher. Some are used only initially, e.g. Mczgen, as in Masgenfrith, whence Manfred, others only finally, e.g. -laf, as in Frithulaf, now Freelove, or -mund, as in Frithumund, whence Freemont. Generally the gender of the second theme corresponds with that of the person, e.g. names in the feminine nouns -thryth and -hild were given to females only. Examples are ^Ethelthryth, Awdrey, Gaerthryth (Gertrude), Gartrudc, and the two fierce queens Brunehild and Chriemhild. But this was not a fixed rule ; there are, for instance, many male names ending in the feminine -mund. The elements which enter into the composition of Teutonic names fall into various groups, such as deities and supernatural beings, animals, abstract 1 The meanings of these elements are discussed further on. 30 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM ideas, weapons, titles and epithets, adjectives. The chief divine elements are God, Ans, Ing.1 The great names of Odin and Freya seem to have been avoided, but Thor is very common. The element God appears to have been often felt as identical with good. Hence, perhaps, the later forms such as Goodrich, Goodwin, and also the shortened Good, which is by no means always a nickname. Here belong such apparently insignificant names as Gobb, Gobbett, Gobby, shortened from such compounds as Godbeorht (Theophanes), Godbeald (Theocrates). The latter survives in full as Godbolt and Goble, while the former is represented in French by Gobert and Joubert. Shortened forms of God names are German Goethe and Italian Giotto. It appears also as the second element in many modern English surnames, e.g. Wingood, from AS. Winegod, Osgood, Hosegood, Horse- good, from AS. Osgod. The Aasir, as Miss Yonge calls them, the An sen as they are named by the Germans, were the divine race inhabiting Asgard, the Norse Olympus. This very interesting prefix, which may be taken as almost equivalent to God, appears in three forms. The Norse is As, the Anglo-Saxon is Os, and the German is Ans. From Ascytel we have Ashkettle and the contracted Askell, Astell, etc., while in France a kind of com- promise between the Norse and German forms produced Anquetil, introduced into England as Ankettle. So also Fr. Angot is the doublet of Osgood. In Haskell we have the common addition of the aspirate [Has- chetill \\Verglice, Salisbury Chart.]. Several surnames 1 The final -ing, which appears in an immense number of names derived from Anglo-Saxon, was a tribal or patronymic suffix. COMPOUNDS OF THOR 31 preserve the Anglo-Saxon form (Osborn, Osman, Osmond, Oswald, etc.), while the German gave the famous Anselm, whence our Ansell, Hansell and the Dutch dim. Enslin. Ing, the name of a demi-god, seems to have been early confused with the Christian angel in the prefix Engel, common in German names, e.g. Engelhardt, anglicized as Engleheart.1 In Anglo- Saxon we find both Ing and Ingel. The modern name Ingoll represents Ingweald (Ingold), and Inglett is a dim. of similar origin. The cheerful Inglebright is from Ingelbeorht. The simple Ing has given, through Norse Ingwar, the Scottish Ivor. The Norse Thor became AS. Thur, which in the compound Thurcytel gave Scottish Torquil (whence MacCorquodale), and our Thur kettle, Thurkell, Thurtle, Thir kettle, Thirkell, Thirkhill, Turtle, and Tuttle* as in Tuttlebee, from Thirkleby (Yorks). Thoroughkettle is found in the eighteenth century. Turketine may be formed in the same way as Anketin, Rosketin (p. 33), but Henry de Turkedene (Glouc. Cart.} suggests a local origin, from Turkdene (Glouc.) with the ending changed as in Heseltine (Hazeldean). Other com- pounds of Thor are Thurgisl, whence Thurgell, Thurgaer, now Thurgar, and Thurfrith, the wife of Hereward (Torfrida), surviving as Turfery, Tuffery, Tollfree. The Thur names did not flourish in Germany, but the Norsemen took them to France, whence as Turbeyt, Turgis, Turpin, they came to England and gave Turbott, Tur goose, etc. The very common Thurstan became in France Tustain, Tustin, 1 This may, however, be native [Petronilla f. Engelliert, Fine R.~\\ 2 This has also a local origin, from toothill, a watch-tower — \" David dwcllide in the tote hil \" (Wye. 2 Sam. v. 9). 32 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM Tutin, all now well-established English surnames. I fancy that this will one day be found to be the origin of the supposed Celtic Tristram, of which the oldest form appears to be Durstan. Tarbath is a curious corruption of Thurbeorht and Tarbun of Thurbeorn. With these mythological names rn^iy be grouped those in Ealh, temple, and the legendary Hun, giant, and &lf, fairy. In connection with the first it should be noted that four of the commonest Anglo-Saxon elements, /Elf, JEthel, Eald, Ealh, very easily became confused, especially after the Conquest, and hence modern sur- names in AI-, Ayl-, El- (Alwin, Aylward, Elwin) may belong to any of them. We find historic Ealhfriths who were known also as Alfrith and Alfridus, which, as surnames, would easily fall together with those derived from ^Elfred and yElfric. So Aymer, Aylmer, may represent, and does in individual cases, both ^Ifrnaer and ^Ethelm?er. The most famous name in Ealh is Ealhwine (Alcuin), which survives as Allchin, Alkin, and is perhaps not altogether foreign to Hawkins. Allcard is AS. Ealhheard, while Fr. Auchcr corresponds to AS. Ealhhere, and may be derived directly from it, as the corresponding element is scarcely found in continental German names. Names in JElf are very numerous and correspond to continental forms in Alb. Thus our A very, less commonly Affery, Affray, All-free, which stands for both /Elfred and /Elfric, is the same as Fr. Aubrey from Alberic. Alflatt, Elfleet, Elflitt is from /ElffLied, elf purity, Alliott from y£lfgr;:t, Elver from /Elfhere, Ehidgc, Elvish from /Elfheali, Elnough from ^Elfnoth, Elston from yElfstan, E hen 1 1 from /Elfweald, and very probably Halsey from .Elfsige, ANIMAL NAMES 33 with the incorrect H-1 which we find in many names of this class. The tribal name of the dwarfish Huns was applied, curiously enough, in Old German to legendary giants, and is still so used in poetic style. It is not common in purely Anglo-Saxon names, though we have a few good examples, e.g. Hunfrith, whence Humphrey, and Hunbeorht which is Fr. Humbert and appears also in the Ger. Humperdinck. Hunbeald is so rare that we dare hardly invoke it to explain our Honeyball, but it is represented by Ger. Humboldt. When we come to the names of animals which were used in the formation of human names, we naturally find a great difference-between the Greeks and the Teutons. Among the former we find chief honour paid to the lion (Leonidas, Timoleon), and the horse (Philip, Hippolytus, Xanthippe). To the old Teutons the lion was unknown, though the rather late name Leonard, lion strong, formed from it, appears in most European languages. The horse was also of little account on the salt seas and in the German forests, and the legendary nicknames of the Jutish invaders, \" stallion \" and \" mare\" (Hengist and Horsa), alluded to their flag, on which the white horse was a strange exotic beast to be classed with dragons and griffins. The only common Anglo-Saxon name formed directly from \" horse \" is Roscytel. This is fairly common in Middle English, and still survives as Roskill [Swein f. Roskil, Pipe R.], while the derivative Rosketin 1 Examples are Hatchard (OF. Achard), Hansell (p. 31), Haskell (p. 30), Hasluck (AS. Aslac), Hosmer (AS. Osmaer), and Hansard, from OF. Ansard, OG. Anshard. The use of \" Hansard \" by modern writers on economics in the sense of a member of the Hanse League is a blunder. The first example of this use in the NED. is dated 1832 ! 34 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM (cf. Anketin from Anscytel) has given Ruskin [Andrew Rosekin, Pat. R.]. The original Roskill has generally been swallowed up by Russell. Rosamond, Roseman contain the same element, but are of continental origin. For the Teutons the two kings of the forest were the bear and the boar, in connection with which we observe a very curious phenomenon. Beorn, so com- mon in Anglo-Saxon names, means warrior, while in Norse and German it means bear. Eofor, equally common, means boar in Anglo-Saxon and German, but warrior in Norse. In each case one language has personified the formidable beast into a human being. Any modern Barnard or Everett is therefore etymologic- ally a strong bear or boar, or a strong warrior, accord- ing as his ancestry is pure Anglo-Saxon or continental. The favourite Beorn name was Beornheard, whence Burnard, Burnett, Barnard, Barncit, etc. It has also many derivatives in F\"rench and German (Behrens, Bernhardi, etc.). Other names of this group which have survived are Beornheah, now Barnish, Burnage, Burnish (cf. Alphege, Elvish, from ^Elfheah), Beornher, one origin of the common Fr. Bernier, and of our Berner, Beornstan, now Burnstone, Beornweald, now Barn-well, Bernal, Burnell, and Beornwulf which would give the same result, but some of the English names here enumerated have an alternative origin. The same element is final in Sigebeorn, now Siborne, Thurbeorne, now Thorburn, Wigbeorn, now Why born, etc. The simple Ber does not appear in Anglo- Saxon names, but Fr. Beraud, Beroalde, OG. Berwald, is the chief source of our Barrett. But the most inter- esting of the \" bear \" names in Fr. Bercngcr, OG. Beringar. It was very popular in England and shows THE WOLF 35 the common confusion of -r-, -1-, -n-, in the modern sur- names Barringer, Berringer, Ballinger, Bellinger, Ben- ninger [John Beringer or Beniger, IpM.]. Its latest transformation is Bellhanger. Eofor is less common in Anglo-Saxon than the corresponding Eber in Germany (Ebers, Eberlin, etc.), and it is possible that the favourite Everard, Everett came to us from Eberhard, via Old French. But AS. Eoforwine, besides giving Everwin, has run riot with the vowels J in Erwin, Irwin, Or win, Urwin. Quite as important as the bear and the boar are the mysterious wolf and raven, the companions of Odin. AS. Wulf appears initially in a great number of names, and the modern name Wolfe, Woof, is some- times a shortened form of these rather than a nick- name. Most historical of all is the dim. Ulfilas, the name of the translator of the Gothic Bible. Among compounds of Wulf are Wulfgar (Woolgar), Wulfnoth (Woolnough), Wulfred, Wulfric (Woolfrey, Woolfries), Wulfstan, whence the local Wolstenholme and Wolston- craft, Wulfwig (Woolley), and Wulfwine (Woolven, Woollen). In the Norse forms the initial has disap- peared, e.g. Ulph, Uff, and Uffendell, the doublet of the native Wolfendale, etc. In French these names replace initial W- by G- or Gu-, e.g. Golfier (Wulf here), one source of our Gulliver and the origin of the local Montgolfier. Almost as numerous are the names in which -wulf is final, but here the origin is generally 1 Our surnames come from the dialects, and the dialects do as they like with the vowels, e.g. from Lamb we have Lomb, Lumb, common Middle English forms, and also Lemm, Limb, Long is also Lang, Lung, Leng, and possibly sometimes Ling. Cf. the local Crankhorn and Crankshaw, the first element of which, meaning \" crooked,\" also occurs as Crenk-, Crink-, Cronk-, Crunk-. 36 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM disguised,1 e.g. Addle from ^Ethelwulf, with which cf. the fine German name Adolf and its atrocious \" latiniza- tion \" into Adolphus, Raddle, Rattle, from Raedwulf, Kinnell from Cynewulf, etc. In French names of similar origin the termination usually becomes -ouf, or -oul, e.g. Burnouf, Renouj correspond to AS. Brun- wulf, Regenwulf, while Raoul is our Ralph,1 Relf, i.e. Raedwulf. The raven appears initially in Raefencytel, whence Rankill, Raefenhild, which is one source of Ravenhill, and Raefensweart, now Ravenshear, Ramshire, Ramsker. Waelraefen survives as Wallraven. The simple Raven, common also in place-names, is more often an Anglo- Saxon personal name than a later nickname from the bird. The raven names are especially Norse, and the corresponding German names, and hence Old French names also, are not numerous, but we have con- tractions of OG. Raban in the well-known dithemetic names Bertram and Wolfram. More numerous are the eagle names, beginning with Earn in Anglo-Saxon. By far the commonest of these is Arnold, a favourite German name, which takes in Low German the form Arend, the source of the Norfolk name Arrand. It is rare in Anglo-Saxon, so the probability is that our Arnall represents rather the much commoner Earnwulf. Two especially interesting Anglo-Saxon names are Earnthur, whence the so-called Keltic Arthur, and Earncytel, now Arkell, Arkle, Argles, Arkcoll, etc. From Arthur come the imitative Authors and Earthy. With 1 Endings such as -weald, -wulf, -hild are often confused, e.g. Gun-nell represents both Gunwulf and Gunhild. 2 Ralph itself is, however, due to French influence, as is shown by the loss of the medial -d-. NAMES OF WAR 37 the same group may be classed the Norse Orm, dragon, serpent (worm), whence the famous Guthorm, still existing as Guthrum, Goodrum, while Wormald from Wurmbeald shows the Anglo-Saxon form. We have also a few names in Swan-, e.g. Swanhild, now Swannell ; but this is for AS. swan, a \" swain \" (see p. 42). The modern name Swan is more often a nickname. Many names similar to the above were used as cognomina by the Romans, e.g. Ursus, Aper, Lupus, Corvus, Aquila, but these were nicknames pure and simple. Among common Anglo-Saxon names we find no fewer than five elements, Bead, Gund (Gutti), Heath, Hild, Wig, which contain the idea of war or battle. The names of Hildebrand and his son Hadubrand are thus identical in meaning. Sometimes these elements occur in combination, e.g. Gunhild (Gunnell), Heath- wig (Hadaway, Hathaway1}. Other examples are Beaduric (Badrick, Batters), Gundwine (Gunwin), Heathured (Hatred], Heathuwine (Hadwin), Hildegar (Hilger, Hilly ar], Wigman (Wyman). Hilditch, Hildick looks local, but is AS. Hildheah, though the name is not in Searle [William f. Hildich, Close R.]. Wig is especially common as second element and is responsible for many names in -way which have a local appearance, e.g. Ellway (.ZElfwig), Harraway (Herewig), Kennaway (Coenwig), Goodway (Godwig), Redway, Reddaway (Rsedwig), Otway, Ottoway (Othwig), Bothway, Bother- way (Bodwig 2), and Hadaway (v.s.). So also in the first syllable we get Way-, as in Waymark (Wigmearc), Way good (Wigod), alternating with Why-, Wy-, as in 1 Also local, of the \" heath way.\" 2 Not in Searle, but certified by the Norman form Bovig (DB.), and Alan Butewey (Hund. R.). 38 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM Whybird (Wigbeorht), Whyborn, Wyburn (Wigbeorn), etc. With this group may be classed also names in Sige, victory, e.g. Sibbald (Sigebeald), Sibary, Sibree ' (Sigebeorht), Sinnott, Sennctt (Sigenoth), Syrelt, Secret (Sigered), Search* Surch (Sigeric), Brixey (Beorhtsige) ; in Here, army, e.g. Folchere, whence Folker, Fnlker, Fulcher, Futchcr, etc., Heregod, now Hargood; and in Fcer, danger, e.g. Faerman (Fairman* Farman, Fire- man). It is not impossible that our homely Farthing may sometimes derive from Faerthegn. Equally warlike are the numerous names derived from weapons. Arms of offence and defence are JEsc, spear (ash), as in ^Escwine (Ashwin), Bit, sword, as in Bilheard (Billiard], Bilweald (Billiald], Brand, sword (flame), as in Colbrand (Colbrain], Ecg, edge (of the sword), as in Ecgheard (Eachard], Gcer, spear, as in Gaerwine (Garvin), Othgaer (Odgers), Helm, helmet, as in Helmaer (Helnier], Ord, spear point, as in Ordwig (Ordway], Ordgaer (Or gar], shortened also to Ord [Humphrey FitzOrd, Salisbury Chart.], and Rand, shield, as in Randwulf 4 (Randall, Rendle, Rundle), Beorhtrand (Bertrand), to be distinguished from Beorht- ram,5 bright raven (Bartram}. But some names in Bil belong to William, for we find William \" dictus Byl \" in the thirteenth century. Here belongs probably the dim. Billion. Brand is much commoner alone than in compounds, and has also become Brand. 1 For this rather unusual development cf. the pronunciation of Kirkcudbright. 2 Reginald Serich or Serche (Coram Rege R. 1297). 3 Of course, also a nickname ; cf. Fr. Belhomme. 4 Randolph (shield 'wolf), Ranulf (raven wolf), Radulf, Ralph (counsel wolf), are separate names, though often confused. 5 Neither name is in Searle. They came to us through French. ABSTRACT IDEAS 39 Gellibrand, Gillibmnd must represent Gislbrand [John Gilibrond, Lane. Ass. R. 1176-1285], though the name is not in Searle. Cytel, Ketel, cauldron (of the gods), is now found as Kettle, Kittle, Chettle, Cattle, etc., as well as initially in Kettleburn [Henry Ketelbern, Chart. R.], and in many names of local origin. Chilvers is for Cytelweard, found in DB. as Chilvert. Hence also Kilvert. Forming a transition from war to peace we have the important elements Burg, refuge, castle, and Mund, protection, as in Burgheard (Bur chard, Burchett), Wilburg (Wilbur] , ^Ethelmund (Almond), Faermund (Farrimond). Here also we might put Weard, guard, the derivatives of which easily get mixed with those of Heard, e.g. Coenweard (Kenward, Kennard). Frithu, peace, has given us many favourite font-names which have later become surnames, e.g. Domfrith (Dumphrey, Dumpress), Frithugar (Fricker], Frithmund (Fiddy- ment *). To the last name, or to some other com- pound of Frithu, such as the once favourite Frithu- swith or Friswid, patron saint of the University of Oxford, belong Fiddy, Fiddian, Phythian, Phethean. This element often becomes Free in modern surnames, e.g. Freestone from Frithustan, Freclove from Frithulaf [Frelof Pollard, Chart. R.]. It also appears in Frizzle, Froysell, which in Scotland has unaccountably become Frazer — \" Simond z Frysel That was traytour and fykell \" (Song, temp. Ed. I.) — 1 The r is lost, as in Biddy (Bridget), Fanny (Frances). 1 The common Middle English use of Simond for Simon suggests that the modern Symonds, Simmonds is only occasionally from AS. Sigemund — \" Symound, I have sum thing for to seye to thee \" (Wye. Luke, vii. 40). 40 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM and in Fr. Froissart, represented by our Frushard, Fr usher. The importance of the tribal idea is reflected in the frequent occurrence of Folc, Leod, Thcoct, all meaning people, nation, e.g. Folcweard (Folkard, Vaulkhard], Leodgar (Ledger], Thcodric (Terry, Derrick, Dethridge, Derry, Todrick], Theodbeald (Theobald, Tibbies, Tipple, Tidball, Tidbald, Tidboald, Tudball, Deeble, Dipple, Tebbutt, Debutt, Dyball, etc.). We have also the shortened Thecd, Teed [William Thede, Eund. K.]. With this important group may be compared the numerous Greek names in demos and lans, e.g. Demo- critus, Laomedon, Nicodemus, Agesilaus, etc. The public meeting of the tribe is commemorated by names in Mcethel and Thing, both meaning assembly. From the first come Mauger, Major (Maethelgaer), and Maber, Malabar, and Fr. Maubert (Maethelbcorht) ; from the second our Dingle, Tingle, a common personal name in Middle English [William Dingel, Eund. R.], from AS. Thingwulf or Dingolf. Similarly Greek had names such as Anaxagores, Pythagoras derived from the agora, the market-place, which was to the Greeks what the forum was to the Romans. The modern surname Lawman may be AS. Lagmann, lawyer, the name of the poet whom we call Layamon, but the latter is so rare a name that it is probably safer to refer Lawman to Lawrence (cf. Jack-man, Hobman, etc.). A very common element connected with authority is Weald (wield), rule, as in Wealdwinc, now Walwin, W alien, but occurring much more commonly as a suffix, e.g. Beorhtweald (Brcttlc, Brittle], Grimbeald (Grimble], llygebeald (Hubble], Winebeald (Wimble], etc. Property and its rights are represented by MISCELLANEOUS COMPOUNDS 41 Geard, enclosure, \" garth,\" Haga, enclosure, \" haw,\" Mearc, mark, boundary, and Stan, stone, probably also in this case a boundary mark. Examples are Frithugeard (Freeguard), Haganfrith (Henfrey), Wig- mearc (Wyniark, Way-mark), Goldstan (Goldstone), Stanmaer (Stammers), Stanbeald (Stumbles 1). To Haga belongs the famous Nibelung Hagen, while Hammond is Fr. Ramon, short for OG. Haganmund. The Middle English contraction of Hagan was Hain — \" Heyne hath a newe cote and his wyf another \" (Piers Plowman) — the origin of our Haines, Haynes, which may also be from the same word in its literal sense of hedge, en- closure. Land and sea have given us Lambert (Land- beorht), Saffrey, Savory (Saefrith), Seagram, Seagrim (Saegrim), and especially Sagar, Sayers, Sears and many other variants (Saegser). These compounds are often not to be distinguished from those of Sige (p. 38), e.g. Seawright may represent Saeric or Sigeric. From a very large number of abstract ideas we may select the following — Amal, work, as in Amalric, whence, or from the transposed Amalric, come, chiefly through French, our Amory, Amery, Emery, Imray, Imrie, while the Italian form Amerigo ultimately named a continent ; D&g, day, as in Daegheard, Daggett, Daegmaer, Darner, Daegmund, now Daymond, Dayman, Damant, etc., often altered to Diamond, and the shortened forms Dack and Day, the latter of which has other and more common origins ; Ead, bless, the first element in so many Anglo-Saxon 1 Alan Stumbel (Pat. R.) ] cf. Rundle for Handle. \" Rondulf theVeve \" (Piers Plowm. A. ii. 78) is in the variants Rainald and Reynald. 42 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM names, some of which are now a little disguised, e.g. Ager, Adger from Eadgar, Admer from Eadmaer ; Hyge, mind, courage, as in Hygebeorht, whence Hubert, Hubbard, Hibbcrt,Hobart,su\\d the favourite ME. Hugh from which we have so many derivatives (Muggins, Howchin, Hewlings, Hullett, etc.) ; Laf, remnant, as in Anlaf,1 now Oliffe ; Maegen, might, as in Maegenhild, one source of Meynell [Peter Maynild, Pat. R.] ; Noth, fame, as in Nothgaer, whence Ger. Notker, Fr. Nodier, and perhaps some of our Nutters ; Reed, counsel, of which the most popular compound was R?edwulf, our Ralph, Relf, Raw, and, via Fr. Raoul, Raoulin, our Rawle, Rawlin * ; Thane, thanks, as in Tancred or Tankard and Ger. Danckwcrtz. Most of these can also occur finally, e.g. ^Etheldaeg, Allday, Ealdrsed, Aldred, Aldritt, Alldread, etc. Besides Beorn (p. 34), Anglo-Saxon used Mann for warrior, hero. This occurs as second element in a great number of compounds of a descriptive kind, e.g. Freoman (Freeman), Northman (Norman), Heardman (Hardman), etc., many of which are of course also nicknames of later formation. For servant we have Scealc, as in Godescealc, one source of Godsell, Outsell, but much commoner in German (Gottschalk), and Swegen or Swan* usually occurring alone, Swain, Swan. All of these elements have poetically the meaning of warrior and in prose that of servant. Cuth, acquaintance, \" kith,\" occurs in the favourite Cuthbeald and Cuthbeorht, the former of which shares 1 This is the Anglo-Saxon form of Norse Olafr, Oliver. 1 Rolfe, Roff have often interchanged with this group, but really represent ON. Hrolfr, cognate with Ger. Rudolf, fame wolf. 1 Norse and Anglo-Saxon forms of the same word. EPITHETS 43 Cobbold with Godbeald, while the latter survives as Cobbett, Cubitt. Cuttell, Cottle may stand for either Cuthhelm or Cuthwulf. Wine, friend, is very com- mon both as initial and final, e.g. Winebeald (Winbolt), Glaedwine (Gladwiri). The common Unwin, un-friend, enemy, is very rare as an Anglo-Saxon name, and must generally have been rather a nickname. Vinegar seems to be an imitative spelling of Winegaer. Gisl, hostage, is the first element of Gilbert, AS. Gislbeorht, but its popularity came through French. From Gislhere comes Ger. Gessler, the villain of the Tell myth. Thurgisl is the origin of Thurgill, and also of Fr. Turgis, whence Eng. Sturgess, and Todkill is earlier Theodgild, probably for Theodgisl. Wseltheof means the thief of slaughter, with a first element which we find in Valkyrie and Valhalla, while Friththeof, the hero of an ancient saga and a modern North Pole expedition, means thief of peace. Some authorities think the ending was originally -theow, servant, slave, which appears to survive in Walthew, Waltho, Waldo. Wiht, creature, sprite, is very common as first element, e.g. Wihtric, now Whittrick, Wightgar, now Widger. Another form, Uht, appears in the popular Uhtred, whence Oughtred and the imitative Outright. Among simple* adjectives the commonest are JEthel, noble, as in ^Ethelweard (Aylward, Adlard, A Hard) ; Beorht, bright, as in Beorhtman (Brightman ; cf. Greek Androcles), Beorhtgifu (Brighteve), Beorhtmser (Bright- more, Brimmer), also very common finally, e.g. Gundbeorht, whence Fr. Gondibert, our Gombert, Gumpert, and Ger. Gompertz ; Beald, bold, as in Beald- here (Balder), Dsegbeald (Daybell, Dab ell) ; Gene, keen, bold, as in Cenered (Kindred), equivalent to Ger. 5 44 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM Conrad (Thrasybulus) ; Cyne, royal, as in Cynesige (Kinsey), Cynewulf (Kinnell) ; Deor, dear, as in Deor- weald (Dorr ell, Durrell) ; Eald, old, as in Eakhvig (Aldwy) ; Eorp, swarthy, as in Eorpwine (Or pen], common also in the shortened form Earp, Orpe ; Freo, free, as in Freobeorn (Freeborn) ; Grim, grim, as in Grimbeald (Grimble), whence also, by a common meta- thesis, Gumbrell l ; Healf, half, as in Healfdene (Hal- dane), the \" half Dane\" ; Heard, hard, strong, as in Heardbeorht, which has contributed to Herbert, Har- bord, etc., Stanheard (Stannard) and Gifheard (Giffard), the latter rare in Anglo-Saxon, but a favourite Norman name (cf. Ger. Gebhardt) ; Leof, dear, as in Leofsige (Livesey, Lovesey), Leofred and Leofric (Livery, Luffery); Hlud, loud, famous, rare in Anglo-Saxon, but very common in German names, e.g. Ludwig, Luther, whence Fr. Louis, Lothair, etc. ; Ric, powerful, rich, as in Ricbeald (Richbell), Ricweald (Riggall), Ricweard (Richard* Rickwood, Record), Leofric (Leveridge, Loveridge) ; Snel, swift, valiant, as in Snelgaer (Snelgar) ; Wacer, bold, as in Eadwacer (Edicker), corresponding to the continental Odoacer ; Wealh, foreign, as in Walkling, Wakeling, a dim. of Old French origin, Vauqudin. Two common elements which hardly fall into any of the classes already mentioned are Regen and Gold. The former, related to Goth, ragin, counsel, seems to have been used in Anglo-Saxon as a simple intensive. From shortened forms of the common Regenweald (Reginald, Reynold, Fr. Renaud), Regenheard (Reynard, Renyard, Fr. Renard), Regenhere (Rayncr, Fr. Regnier), 1 For the change of vowel cf. Grimmett, Grumntett, which are common side by side in Lincolnshire. 2 This is also from Richard. SHORTENED FORMS 45 etc., we sometimes get Raine, Raines, while Raybould is from Fr. Reybaud, corresponding to Regenbeald. Gold occurs both as initial and final, e.g. Goldhavoc (Gold- hawk], Goldwine (Gold-win, Jeudewin], Inggold (Ingold, Ingle) . Goldmore represents Goldmser, though this is not in Searle [Guldemor w. of Richard Astmund, Fine R.]. The frequency with which any given Anglo-Saxon name occurs as a modern surname is not so much due to its wide use before the Conquest as to its associa- tion with some great personality. After the Conquest our baptismal system became, in the main, French, although the French names in use were largely cognate with the Anglo-Saxon names which they superseded (see p. 10). But the memory of famous saints, like Guthlac and Cuthbert, or abbots like Thurcytel and Ealhwine, was reverenced in those districts where they had lived and worked, and their names were given to children born of parents who had worshipped at their shrines. As we have noticed here and there, the modern surname often represents only the first element of the dithemetic personal name. A notable example is Folc, which owed its popularity to the Angevin dynasty. We find among its variants, Folk, Fulk, Fewkes, Foulkes, Foakes, Fooks, Fowkes, Folkes, Volks, Yokes,1 and, with metathesis, Flook, Fluke, Fluck, Flux, while Fogg, Fuge, Fudge, Fuke are shortened from its com- pound Fulcher (Folker, Fulker, Futcher, Fudger, Volker, 1 Here sometimes belongs Vaux, usually local, from one of many French place-names formed from val. Vauxhall was once a manor belonging to the notorious Falkes de Breaute. His name, really the nominative of Falcon, Facon, survives as Fakes, Fawkes, Feakes, Feggs. Though distinct from Fulk, the two names have been confused. 46 THE TEUTONIC NAME-SYSTEM etc.). Foggathorp (Yorks) is Fulcartorp in DB., while, in the Coram Rege R. (1297), the same man is referred to as Henry Fulcher and Henry Fouch. The famous French name Foch is of course cognate. Other shortened names of this type, not already mentioned, are Oram from the Norse Orm [Orum solus, Lib. Vit.] and Worms from the Anglo-Saxon form, as in Wurm- here, Frew, Frow, from Freowine, whence Frewin, Fruen, Gold, generally shortened from some such name as Goldwine, Main, Mayne, from Maynard or some other compound of Mcegen, Wigg from one of the many Wig names, Winks, perhaps from Wincthryth (Lib. Vit.), etc. Many of these are simple, but a great many of our short names of Anglo-Saxon origin are very difficult to identify. This difficulty is increased by the fact that names of this type are seldom recorded in the Rolls. The latter give almost invariably, in whatever language they are written, the font-name in its full conventional form. Occasionally a clue helps us, as in the case of Fogg and Fudge (v.s.), but the task of extending the work of Kemble 1 by identifying the great mass of these names with their originals still awaits an enthusiast. N.B. — To have included many medieval examples would have made the foregoing chapter quite unread- able. The author's Dictionary of Surnames, if it is ever completed, will contain evidence of the survival and alteration of these Anglo-Saxon names. 1 In his pamphlet, The Names, Surnames, and Nicknames of the Anglo-Saxons (Lond. 1846). This task has akeady been attempted, for German, by Starck, in his Kosenamen der Germanen (Vienna, 1868). CHAPTER III SOME LOCAL SURNAMES \" Nor indeed is he capable to beare any rule or office in town or countrey, who is utterly unacquainted with John an Okes and John a Stiles \" (HowELL, Forraine Travell). APART from the innumerable names derived from towns, villages and estates, we have a very large number which originate from features of the land- scape (Hill, Wood, Field], or from specific buildings or parts of buildings (Church, House, Kitchen}. Many of the words from which such names come are quite obsolete or survive only in local dialect. Some of these, such as Hurst, Shaw, Thwaite, etc., survive very strongly in compounds, and are often curiously cor- rupted. For these, of which I have given a summary account in my Romance of Names, see ch. iv. Here I propose to deal rather with a number of obsolete or unfamiliar words which occur more often in their simple form. A few others are included because of their peculiar use as surnames. The list, though by no means exhaustive, contains a very large number of names which have never been explained, and the examples by which they are illustrated are usually some centuries older than the earliest records in any dictionary. A few others belonging to the same class 47 48 SOME LOCAL SURNAMES will be found scattered about in other chapters of the book in which accident has led to their mention. In many cases names of this type are now specific place-names. We find constant references to \" the Devizes,\" as to la Burcote, la Haye, la Poole, la Rye, la Sele, la Woodrow, etc., now known as Burcote, Hayes, Poole, Rye, Seal, Woodrow, but the entries show that the corresponding surnames often belong to the general as well as to the specific use of these words. In the early Rolls these names, or rather these addresses, are always preceded by prepositions, which have now generally disappeared. The following examples are put down just as they are printed in the Rolls : John Abovebrok Roger Abovetun or Bovetun Roger ad capud villae de Weston Laurence Atepleystowe Alan ad le Loft Thomas Attehallyat Walter Attenovene Richard A ten orchard John atte Churchestyghele Robert Attekirkstiel . .

Names in which the preposition has survived are still common in English as in other languages, e.g. Fr. Doutrepont, Ger. Zumbusch, Du. Bezuidenhout, south of the wood. At survives in many obvious names such as Atwood, AUewell. The following are less simple, Athawes (haw, a hedge enclosure), Atheis (hays, hedges), Athews (ME. hiwisc, homestead, whence Huish), Athoke (hook, bend), Atkey (quay), Ato, Attoe, Hatto (hoe, a sand-spit), Athow (how, a hill), Attack, Attick, Attock (oak), Attenbarrow (barrow, a mound), Attrie (rye, seep. 72), Attrill, AS. at tharehylle [Thomas Atterhill, Exch. R.], Attread (reed), Attride (ME. rithe, ride, a small stream), Attru (trough, see Trow ; or per- haps from rew, street, row), Attwooll (Wool,2 Dors.), Atyeo (a Somerset surname, apparently from the river 1 The Ouse ; cf . Surtees. 1 I do not know the origin of this place-name, but Attwooll is a Dorset surname, and this suggests that Wool has some general meaning. 50 SOME LOCAL SURNAMES Yeo). Atterbury is \" at the bury,\" i.e. borough, and though there is an Attenborough in Notts, the fact that Attenborough is found along with Atterbury in many counties suggests that the two names are often of identical origin. So also Atherall, Attreall, at the heal (see p. 62). An interesting name of the same type is Ather smith, ME. at ther smethe, or level field, for which sec p. 77. Ather such probably contains Sich (q.v.), but the ending may be Such, a variant of Zouch, Fr. souchc, a tree-stump. The reduction of A t is seen in A' Barrow, A'Burrow, A'Hearn (corner), as in Abcar (see p. 53), Avann (see p. 59), A gutter. In the latter name [Robert atte Gotere, Pat. R.] gutter means stream— \" The guter of waters \" (Wye. Hab. iii. 10). It seems to have been equivalent to gote, a channel, whence Gott [William atte Gote or de la Gotere, of Boston, Pat. R.]. At- is also changed to Ad- and even Ed-, Et-, a*s in Edmead, Ethawes. Names such as Nash, Noakes, Nail are well known to be aphetic forms of alien ash, alien oaks, atten hall, With these go Niles, Nayland, Nyland [Thomas Atteny- londe, Pat. R.], N orchard, Nendick (end dike). We also get aphetic forms in which the initial A- alone has disappeared. The stock example is Twclls, at wells. Here belong Tash (at ash), Taw (Athaw, v.s.), Toe, Toes (Atto, v.s.), Trill (Attrill, v.s.), and probably Trood [Margaret atte Rude, Picas.). The Border name Trodden may be from northern dial, roddin, a sheep- track. Occasionally the AF. al (a le) and a la seem to survive, e.g. Algate, Allchurch, Allpass, Allpike SURVIVAL OF PREPOSITIONS 51 (Hallpike 1), Alltoft, Altree, Allabyrne (burn), but alter- native explanations could be given for most of these, e.g. the prefix may be aid, old, or Allabyrne may be only an elaboration of Alabone, Allibone, which in its turn is a perversion of Alban [Hugh Alybon, Coram Rege R. 1297]. Allhusen seems to represent aland the old dat. plur. husum, houses. But del, de la, are common, the former being often altered to dal, dil, dol. Examples are Delahuntc, Delahunty, Delhay, Dallicoat, Dallicott, Dallamore, Dillamore, Dollymore, DeUaway, Dittoway, Dolloway, Delbridge, Dealbridge, Dealchamber, Dillistones, Dallywaters, to which many more could be added. Dellow probably contains how, a hill [William Delhow, Hund. R.], while Dellew is for del ewe, water, also a common entry. Names in Du-, e.g. Dupree, Duppery, Fr. Dupre, of the meadow, Duberley, i.e. du Boulay (birch grove), are generally of more recent introduction from French. The retention of de "
