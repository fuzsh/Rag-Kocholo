        "text": "By coincidence, most of my favorite stories for September are grouped around two things: food and flash fiction, including one story that encompasses both the theme and the format. I should note, however, that I'm leaving some of this month's favorites off this list -- but only because I plan to discuss them separately later this month in a post recommending some wonderful Halloween-themed fiction that I've found recently.\n\nI should also note that some of these are non-genre. As always, my reading is at least 90% genre, but I do like mainstream and literary short stories also.\n\nFinally, although I normally list my favorite stories alphabetically by the author's last name, this month I feel compelled to group the stories a bit differently. (I'm one of those people with a slightly abnormal desire to categorize things. Yes, I separate my M&Ms by colors before eating them.)\n\nFOOD\n\n\"I Was Really Very Hungry\" by M.F.K. Fisher, read by Christina Pickles\n\nI think I picked up this audiobook anthology through a bargain website a few years ago for next to nothing; before then, I had no idea that this fairly extensive collection of \"Selected Shorts\" audiobooks, \"as heard on public radio nationwide,\" existed. This volume, titled Food Fictions, contains six stories, and the first selection, M.F.K. Fisher's \"I Was Really Very Hungry\" is truly centered on food.\n\nNarrated by the aptly named Christina Pickles and recorded (as they all are) in front of a live audience, this story is about a traveler who stops for lunch at a small restaurant in France. She intends to order a light meal and is unsure what to expect in terms of quality from this unassuming little place, but she is quickly cowed by the polite but authoritative waitress and ends up trying -- and finishing -- all sorts of dishes that turn out to be sublime."
