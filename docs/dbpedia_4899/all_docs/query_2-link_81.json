My maternal grandparents were from outside Naples, (Scafati/Salerno?)They came here in 1905 on the Citta di Genova.My grandfather was Pasquale Montuori and my Grandmother was Teresa Russo,she was an only child as far as I know and I think he had brothers.They had six children. Joseph, Anna (my mother) Peter, John, Camille, and Tom. I met my grandfathers sister in Salerno in 1966,have since lost contact. She had 2 children Domenico(Mimi) and Carmela. Mimi owned 2 shops, a Pasterceria Trieste and Bar Corso in Salerno. Unfortunately I know little about Russo other then She came from a wealthy merchants family. My paternal grandparents have a really vague background. Grandpa Antonino Ruggiero came here in the late1890's, what was said he was a cabin boy from an early age and at some point stayed in the US. He was a chef for the Harry M. Stevens Co. for all his life.He was known as \"Tom Rogers there.I believe the region he came from was Torre del Greco.His wife was Luisa Gargiulo from Sorrento.I think they married here, Inever knew her, she died before I was born.They had many children, I only knew of Michael(my father) Anyhony,Edmund, Joseph, Louis,Teresa,and of a sister Lucy who died before I was born and twin brothers .It would be a miracle if I found out more pieces to this puzzle to give my children and grandchildren, thanks so much.\n\nTeresa Ruggiero Abruzzo <Iggyandteresa@aol.com>\n\nStaten Island, NY USA - Friday, May 11, 2001 at 11:46:24 (EDT) Hey my family name is Santelli and I was hoping to get some information on its heritage/ history.

I keep trying ellisislandrecords.com, and sometimes get results, sometimes not. One thing I can say, is that if you are searching for females, you may have to research them by their maiden names. That's how we found a grandmother & Aunt. My grandparents came from San Salvo, Abruzzo and Chieti. If there are any Colomarino's, De Filippo's, or Poltroni (Pultroni) not sure of spelling, I'd sure like to know. Anyway, still searching for Donato Calcagno, Maria Calcagno (nee) Carlucci-Grandparents, came about 1910 maybe, with a son, Angelo about 8 years old or so.
