        "text": "Lebanese spinach pies, or fatayer, are savory little pockets of dough stuffed with a flavorful spinach filling. Fatayer are shaped into adorable triangles and baked to golden brown.\n\nLebanese spinach pies, or fatayer, are among those special foods that send us into total reverie, perhaps one of the finest bites in the Middle East! The Greeks give us their spanakopita recipe that includes feta and phyllo dough, while Lebanese spinach pies are made with thin, tender bread dough that is stuffed with spinach and onion and shaped into small hand pies.\n\nWhat is Lebanese Spinach Pie (Fatayer)?\n\nMost every cuisine has their own version of a savory hand pie. For the Lebanese and many throughout the Middle East, our spinach pie is called fatayer (pronounced fuh-tie-uh). The dough is easy to work with, and the filling is a mouthwatering blend of spinach, onion and lemon. These golden little triangle-shaped pies are about 3 inches in size. Fatayer are a delicious part of Lebanese Mezze, small bites to enjoy before a meal or as their own little meal with a drink. It’s amazing if any of the fatayer last from just out of the oven to wherever the baker’s destination for them might be. They are that delicious! You want to eat them ALL and fight over who gets the last warm fatayer, from the moment they are pulled from the oven.\n\nThe shapes and sizes of fatayer may vary with every cook. The smallest fatayer I have seen were teeny, tiny little bites with yogurt dipping sauce (see how to make yogurt here!) as part of a passed appetizer cocktail hour at my brother’s wedding. Knowing how challenging it can be to shape fatayer, this was an amazing feat, these tiny bite-sized triangles! The largest fatayer my cousin Jim makes, the size of a man’s hand, beautiful and wow, so easy to eat the whole big fatayer in one fell swoop….\n\nMy fatayer successes and failures (oh yes) all inform my best recipe for Lebanese Spinach Pie success. The dough recipe here takes just one rise (rather than the typical double-rise of the dough ball), rolls with ease, and results in a tender envelope for the filling. Follow my tips and methods for the most beautiful, delicious spinach pies, soon to come out of your oven too! (And if you love shaping fatayer, you’ll also love shaping a gorgeous baked brie wrapped in puff pastry…).\n\nHow to make Spinach Fatayer\n\nStep 1: Make the dough. The dough needs about 90 minutes to rise, so start this first. Make the basic dough mixture in a stand mixer with the hook attachment or by hand. Kneading the dough by hand takes longer because the dough is sticky.\n\nStep 2. Make the spinach filling. Our goal in mixing the filling is to remove as much juice as possible, creating a dry mixture that won’t release the juices that can cause fatayer seams to split.\n\nStep 3. Roll out the dough. Once the dough is doubled in size, roll half of the dough ball out on the counter. Carefully lift the dough off the counter to allow the dough to contract. Roll again and lift again, then a final roll will do it to keep the dough nice and thin.\n\nStep 4. Cut the dough in circles. Use a 3- to 4-inch round cutter. Cutting the dough circles is similar to making cut-out cookies.\n\nStep 5. Fill the fatayer. Fill each circle with a heaping tablespoon of filling in the center of each round. Be careful not to let the filling touch the edges of the dough where it will be gathered and pinched closed.\n\nStep 6: Shape the triangles. Bring three sides of the dough circle together in the center, up over the filling, and pinch into a triangle. Pinch the dough firmly, shaping as you go. Place the fatayer on a baking sheet (you’ll need two, lined with parchment paper or foil) as you finish each one. When they are all shaped, go back and pinch the seams on each fatayer again!\n\nStep 7: Bake the fatayer in a 375° F oven for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.\n\nWhat You’ll Need to Make This Lebanese Spinach Pie – (Spinach Fatayer) – Recipe\n\nWhat You’ll Need for the Dough\n\nActive dry yeast\n\nSugar, just a touch to encourage the yeast\n\nWarm water\n\nAll-purpose flour\n\nSalt\n\nNeutral oil, such as canola, avocado, or safflower oil. Look for expeller-pressed when purchasing seed oils like these, which means chemicals are not used to extract the oil\n\nExtra virgin olive oil, to coat the pies before baking\n\nHow to Fold the Dough\n\nTo shape the dough for fatayer, be sure that the filling placed in the center of each flat round of dough does not touch the edges. That juice can keep the seams from staying closed.\n\nPull the dough up from the edge in three places at once, bringing those three points together above the filling. Stretch the dough to get there as needed.\n\nPinch the three points together very firmly. Then pinch the three seams from the center, firmly, to form the triangle.\n\nOnce all of the fatayer are shaped, go back and pinch the seams one more time. This is your insurance policy to get the seams to stay closed!\n\nWhat You’ll Need for the Filling\n\nSpinach. Fresh or frozen chopped spinach (my preference is frozen chopped)\n\nYellow onion, finely diced\n\nSalt and pepper\n\nLemon juice or lemon crystals\n\nCinnamon or allspice\n\nToasted pine nuts or toasted chopped walnuts\n\nIf using fresh spinach, sprinkle with salt in a bowl. Set aside to macerate (get the juices flowing) for 10 minutes, then squeeze the spinach to release as much juice as possible. Discard the juice.\n\nIf using frozen spinach, thaw and squeeze out as much juice as possible, and discard juice.\n\nTips for Making the best Lebanese Spinach Pies\n\nDon’t overproof the dough. We are working to keep the dough thin and tender rather than puffy and bready. This is why the dough rises just one time, taking care not to let the dough rise more than double in size.\n\nWork swiftly when rolling and filling the pies. We do this for two reasons: the longer the dough sits, the more it will continue to rise. And, the longer the dough is exposed to air, the dryer it becomes. The dough seals better and stays closed when it is sticky during the process, not dry.\n\nSubstitute sumac for lemon juice. Some fatayer recipes call for Middle Eastern ground sumac in place of lemon juice in the spinach mixture. Sumac has a citrus-y flavor and doesn’t introduce more liquid to the filling; this reduces the juices that can cause the fatayer seams to open during baking.\n\nCook the spinach in a dry skillet. This is another way to evaporate the moisture in the spinach, by “cooking” it. Add the spinach to a dry skillet over medium heat and sauté until dry. Cool completely, about 30 minutes, before proceeding.\n\nFold the dough rather than pinching three seams. This is an alternative to the traditional fatayer triangle shape. Simply fold up the sides of the dough round (that has filling atop) three ways, laying the dough up over the filling and over each of the prior folds, to create a closed pocket.\n\nUse frozen bread dough as a substitute for homemade. Many a baker substitutes the homemade dough with frozen dough balls. Thaw the dough, allow it to rise to double in size, then roll each ball into a flat round and proceed. Frozen dough yields more bread-like fatayer.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\nSave\n\n(Visited 232,963 times, 11 visits today)"
