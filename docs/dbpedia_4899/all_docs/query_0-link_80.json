        "text": "After falling for each other while shooting Too Young To Die, the couple ended up dating between 1989 and 1993. Opening up about the relationship with Vanity Fair, Brad revealed: “I still love the woman. There’s some real genius there. I had a great time with her. It was one of the greatest relationships I’ve ever been in. The problem is, we grow up with this vision that love conquers all, and that’s just not so, is it?”\n\nAnd then came Jen. They met on a blind date in 1998 after their agents set them up. “I will say this about Jen: She‘s fantastic, she’s complicated, she’s wise, she’s fair, she has great empathy for others... and she’s just so cool,” he told Rolling Stone. They got hitched in 2001 in Malibu with guests including Jennifer’s Friends’ co-star Courteney Cox and Salma Hayek . Their love story came to an end in 2004.\n\nRELATED: Angelina Jolie talks about ex Brad Pitt in new interview\n\n‘Brangelina’ as they were dubbed met on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith with Brad adopting her son Maddox and daughter Zahara in 2006, the year they had their first biological child, Shiloh , together. When accused of breaking up Brad and Jennifer, Angelina responded: “To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn‘t be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.”\n\nThe couple went on to adopt a third son, Pax in 2007 and have twins Knox and Vivienne in 2008. The pair married on August 23, 2014, in an intimate ceremony at their Château Miraval estate in Correns, France. They shocked the world by announcing their separation in September 2016."
