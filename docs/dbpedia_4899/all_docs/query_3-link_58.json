        "text": "By: Chef Laura Bonicelli\n\nPreserving food with fermentation is an ancient process. Like canning and pickling, it’s easy to do in your home kitchen.\n\nBuy your ingredients at your favoriteFarmers Market!\n\nabout Tangy Fermented Red Salsa\n\nFermented foods have significant health benefits; the good bacteria in fermented foods produce antioxidants (Antioxidants counter the effects of free radicals, which experts believe play a role in a wide variety of illnesses, including cancer and chronic inflammation) and are rich in probiotics, so good for your gut. Fermented foods may also produce compounds that lower blood sugar.\n\nHealth benefits aside, I love this recipe because it’s wonderful to have a great salsa on-hand. It’s the perfect condiment, from scrambled eggs to your favorite lunch salad. If you want more heat, switch to a Serrano or hotter pepper. I love the oregano, but if you don’t, chives or more cilantro or basil is delicious as well.\n\nDon’t Forget\n\nMake sure you sign up for our newsletter to get more recipes and take a look at joining the Bonicelli Cooking Club! We’d love to have you!\n\nI hope you love this recipe!\n\nIf you want more recipes, Join The Club!!!\n\nLooking for some other delicious recipes to pair with your salsa?

Alternatively, you can cover the jars with a muslin cloth or a coffee filter and secure them with a rubber band. If you're using clamp lids, release the lid once a day to release pressure from the fermentation.\n\nSet the jars on your countertop out of the sun. Fermentation can take two to four days (longer if the room temperature is below 72ºF.) Warmer temperature speeds fermentation. After the 2nd day, taste the salsa. When the salsa reaches the desired taste and tang, seal the jars and put them into the refrigerator. You can allow fermentation for up to 6 days (I usually do 5). The salsa will keep for up to 6 months in the refrigerator.\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 6kcalCarbohydrates: 1gProtein: 1gFat: 1gSaturated Fat: 1gPolyunsaturated Fat: 1gMonounsaturated Fat: 1gSodium: 38mgPotassium: 62mgFiber: 1gSugar: 1gVitamin A: 196IUVitamin C: 4mgCalcium: 5mgIron: 1mg\n\nKeyword jalapeno, onions, tomatoes\n\nTried this recipe?Let us know how it was!\n\nFermented Cucumber (Pickles)\n\n© Chef Laura Bonicelli\n\nI use this same base recipe for green beans and baby zucchini.

Add water to cover all solids. Cover the jars loosely with a lid. Let stand in a cool, dry place - away from direct sunlight - for 5 to 7 days. The liquid will turn cloudy, then bubble and fizz after several days as it develops lactic acid.
