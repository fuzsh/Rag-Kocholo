I hope you’re all keeping busy while we’re stuck indoors; I know I’m a bit late again and this should have gone up ages ago, but my mum is working from home now so we’re sharing the computer. There’s a lot of upheaval and uncertainty in the air at the moment, especially in regards to the film industry as various releases are postponed or moved over to streaming services, but on the plus side, we now have time to catch up on any shows we’ve been meaning to see – as well as revisit old favourites. That’s why I decided the time was ripe to get into my second series review, following my Rugrats one last August.\n\nDo any of you guys remember The Wild Thornberrys? I didn’t realise until I started researching this review how forgotten it had become, but that is apparently the case – despite airing in the era of classic Nicktoons, this one has sadly been left behind and is little talked about nowadays. I must admit, then, to a strong bias, because this was always my favourite cartoon growing up and I’m still fond of it now, although certainly it has its flaws.\n\nLike Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys was the work of Klasky Csupo, with a team of four producers and three developers working on it while Gábor and Arlene themselves served as executive producers. (For a fuller account of Klasky Csupo’s beginnings, see my Rugrats review). It was created towards the tail end of the animation “renaissance” as the eleventh of Nickelodeon’s popular line-up of animated Nicktoons, debuting in September 1998 just a few months after Oh Yeah! Cartoons, a few months before SpongeBob, and about a year before Klasky Csupo stablemate Rocket Power. Notably, it was the first Nicktoon to be made in a 22-minute episode format, with earlier shows sticking to the more standard 10-minute mark outside of the occasional special.\n\nThe funny thing about the Thornberrys is that, back in the day, it was pretty hot stuff as far as the network was concerned. It used to be heavily shown and promoted alongside Klasky Csupo’s other shows and spawned two theatrical films, one of which even got an Oscar nod for its music (but we’ll get to that in the next review). However, after reading what little discussion I could find of the show online, it seems some people felt that the Thornberrys was the first of Nick’s “weaker” offerings and may even have marked the beginning of the channel’s fall from grace, with a recurring criticism being that they began to rely too heavily on Klasky Csupo’s work.\n\nWhile I do agree with that latter point to some extent (since Nick putting all their eggs in one basket is the main reason SpongeBob has been forced to go on for so long), I strongly disagree with the idea that The Wild Thornberrys is a substandard show. Whatever problems fans may have had with the Klasky Csupo house art style or the writing of certain characters, there’s no denying the inherent value (or at least the potential) of this concept. An environmentally conscious show that focuses on conservation and showcases world cultures sounds great, doesn’t it? Yet perhaps that’s just it; maybe the show was too ahead of its time, with some finding it too “preachy” or dull.\n\nAnyway, if you were one of those who didn’t care for The Wild Thornberrys, then I apologise in advance for spending two whole reviews on it (yes, the film is coming up next). I do hope you’ll still give them a quick read, because I want to try and defend my love for this show and maybe, just maybe, convince some of its naysayers that there was more to it than it’s being given credit for.\n\nProduction History\n\nUnlike the ratings darling Rugrats, there’s not a whole lot of behind-the-scenes info out there regarding The Wild Thornberrys. It reminds me of when I was doing the Disney canon reviews; whenever something like The Lion King or Frozen came up, I’d be swamped in research as every last speck of the production had been obsessively documented, with the resulting reviews running to thousands upon thousands of words. Then, I’d come to something that the studio was a bit embarrassed about, like Chicken Little, and suddenly… there’s nothing. Only the Mouse knows where the bodies are buried.\n\nHonestly, if it weren’t for my Nicktoons book, I’d be lost. All I know is that the concept for the Thornberrys seemed to develop around about 1996, when a chap called Eryk Casemiro left his job at Broadway Video to become Senior Vice President of Creative Affairs (what a mouthful) at Klasky Csupo. It’s not clear whether the actual idea for the show came from him or Klasky Csupo – I get a sense that it may have originally been Gábor’s idea – but either way, Casemiro quickly took a shine to the show and worked hard to make it the best it could be. He knew early on that he wanted it to be “scientifically based”, so he hired specialists to research the various parts of the world that the titular family would be travelling to in order to ensure as much accuracy as possible. Lists were drawn up of the flora and fauna of each place, and great pains were taken to depict local holidays and traditions properly.\n\n{After digging around IMDB, it seems Bryce Lowery filled this position at first – he’s listed as the research consultant and coordinator for the first 60 episodes, which basically comprise the first two seasons. Harry Harootunian then took over for another 26 episodes, with Todd Risley stepping in for the episode A Family Tradition.}\n\nThe information gathered by these researchers would then be passed along to the writing team, who would use it to cook up ideas for a batch of new episodes. Sometimes, they would spend five or more episodes on a single region in order to show off all they’d learned; Casemiro compared the experience of working on the show to “making short cartoon documentaries”. (Perhaps this is why so many seemed to find the show boring? I’m a huge nerd, so the “edumacating” never bothered me). One writer, Kate Boutilier, greatly enjoyed her time on the show, calling it “my complete and total heart” and recalling with fondness how it expanded her horizons, making her want to get out and see more of the world. (Yes, that’s exactly why I liked it so much!)\n\nHowever, as it developed, the show’s focus expanded to incorporate not just the educational content but also the evolving family dynamic between the Thornberrys themselves, which Casemiro described as “a lot of fun”. It was actually quite unusual at that time for cartoons to give equal weight to the parent characters, with most choosing to focus squarely on the kids; Klasky Csupo were already toying with this idea in Rugrats, but with The Wild Thornberrys they used this approach to its fullest by making Nigel and Marianne a part of the main cast, fleshing them out and always giving them a B-plot of their own. Apparently, focus group testing was what convinced them to do this, as kids of the day said they wanted to see more parental role models in their cartoons (not sure how true that is, but okay), but as we shall see below, Klasky Csupo may have shot themselves in the foot by complying.\n\nThe only other aspect of the production that I was able to find any discussion of was the character design, which is one of the few things about the show that most people seem to remember – and not necessarily in a good way.\n\nThe youngest daughter of the family, Eliza Thornberry, was the show’s main character and Gábor Csupó was apparently very passionate about his “cute ugly girl”, making the excellent point that not all heroines need to be beautiful. Personally, I agree with him, but Nickelodeon were said to have had some “concerns” over her original design, which was so homely that they feared people would be put off watching a show with such a hideous lead. Yes, that’s right – the studio actually pressured the team to make Eliza cuter. Still, to the team’s credit, while they did retool her slightly to make her a little more visually appealing, they resisted further pressures to have Eliza lose her braces or switch to contact lenses as the seasons went by, firmly standing by their design and saying, “This is her look”.\n\nAs for Eliza’s ability to talk to animals, which was at the core of the show’s premise, Casemiro summed that up as “wish fulfilment” and said simply, “What kid wouldn’t want to have that ability?” Eliza’s character as a whole was presumably inspired by Doctor Dolittle, who first appeared back in 1920 in Hugh Lofting’s novel The Story of Doctor Dolittle, while her name may have been a shout-out to My Fair Lady’s Eliza Doolittle. (Nice touch; was there a musical fan on the staff, I wonder?) The family’s surname may have been borrowed from Cedric Thornberry, then Assistant-Secretary-General of the UN and father of MP Emily Thornberry, but I’m only speculating.\n\n(Also, I’m not sure where else to include this, but I came across something in the IMDB credits for the show that made me howl: for some reason, a lady called Tory Lowitz is listed in the “costume and wardrobe department” as “Debbie’s midriff designer”, a position she filled for five episodes. I have no idea what that means, exactly, but I think it’s hilarious).\n\nSoundtrack\n\nNow, I wasn’t able to say much about Rugrats’ music, but I can say even less about that of The Wild Thornberrys because I simply cannot find any interviews with the series composer, Drew Neumann, at all. I’m guessing he was introduced to Klasky Csupo by Peter Chung, the guy who directed the pilot episode of Rugrats for them back in 1990 just before directing his own show for MTV, Æon Flux (1991-1995). Neumann served as composer for that show (which remains his best-known work), so perhaps Chung recommended him to Klasky Csupo when they were looking for a musician to work on The Wild Thornberrys.\n\nEither way, the work he provided was very distinctive and the music still gives me a huge shot of nostalgia whenever I hear it. What I especially liked was the way he incorporated appropriately international instrumentation for the setting of the episode, using lilting panpipe melodies in South America or rhythmic drums and choral work in Africa. Neumann stayed for the entire duration of the show, even guest starring in one episode as Debbie’s rock idol Des Brodean, with Gregory Hinde assisting him on the composition of some of the last episodes.\n\nCharacter Overview\n\nThe show was led by 12-year-old Eliza Thornberry, the youngest daughter of the family and the one who could talk to animals. If I’m being completely honest, I couldn’t stand her as a kid – rather like Tommy Pickles, she came across as bossy and overbearing in the earlier seasons, making her a difficult character to like. Early Eliza was headstrong and reckless and often made bad decisions, but her heart was always in the right place. She was passionate about her parents’ profession and dreamed of taking on their mantle one day, devoting herself to conservation and working to stop the mistreatment of animals whenever she encountered it. The trouble was, her passion for the animals sometimes clouded her judgement, so that in her efforts to help them she would often wind up making things worse by rushing into situations she didn’t fully understand.\n\nI agree with the popular fan theory that the show might have been more successful had Nigel been made the main character instead of Eliza. Her habit of bossing her pal Darwin around and forcing him into situations he wasn’t comfortable with was a particularly hard pill to swallow; it felt very reminiscent of Tommy and Chuckie, although she was called out on it several times in the show, just as Tommy was. Thankfully, she did have numerous moments where her help genuinely saved animals’ lives, thus making her “know-it-all” side easier to stomach. Eliza was certainly flawed, but in a way that made her feel more like a real kid, so it’s not so much a criticism as an observation.\n\nThankfully, Eliza’s character was allowed to mature a bit in the later seasons, although her development was rather clumsily handled – a few precocious romantic interests were teased here and there in the earlier seasons, but then the last suddenly crammed in a ridiculous soap opera subplot about her falling in love with a pop star who comes to stay with the family (yes, really). This relationship with Shane G. was her only serious romantic interest, which is probably as it should have been… she was only twelve, after all.\n\nThis being a TV show, Eliza’s best friend was a chimp she picked up in the Congo who she named Darwin (after a cousin of Eliza’s, not the naturalist). I’m sure it goes without saying that keeping a chimpanzee in captivity is not a good idea in real life (just ask Charla Nash), but the show did take pains to make it clear that Darwin wasn’t like other chimps. There was a whole episode involving renowned primatologist Jane Goodall, guest starring as herself, in which she got to know Darwin and gave Eliza her blessing to continue to care for him.\n\nLooking back at their friendship now, though, I can’t help wondering why Darwin stuck around. The way Eliza treated him at times was, frankly, disgraceful, with her habit of ignoring his advice and getting him into perilous situations over and over again. She did care about him and always came to his rescue (and he to hers, many times), but there was a distinct sense that he’d taken on far more than he expected by joining the Thornberry clan. Darwin served primarily as a kind of “Jiminy Cricket” figure, trying to steer Eliza out of danger but rarely managing to talk her out of her shenanigans.\n\nDarwin was always an animal with a taste for the finer things in life and never missed his days in the wild, although he would get touchy if Eliza dared to suggest he was out of touch with his animal instincts. It’s surprising he didn’t get along better with Debbie, really, as the two of them were both indoor types with a penchant for relaxing and a distaste for nature – but then again, they seemed to have a “this ComVee ain’t big enough fer the two of us” kind of relationship, with Debbie often blaming Darwin for her missing hair products or snacks.\n\nStill, whatever faults Darwin’s friendship with Eliza might have had, he was invaluable to her as her only confidante while her family were on the move. It’s likely that without him (and her ability to talk to animals), Eliza would have been just as lonely and irritable as Debbie is for much of the show, cut off from socialising with kids her own age. She enjoys teaching Darwin and playing games with him, and for his part, he gets noticeably jealous whenever her attention is taken up by some new friend or animal – he may not always want to come along on her adventures at first, but he’s there in a flash if he feels like he’s being replaced.\n\nNow here’s the man everybody remembers the show for – Sir Nigel Archibald Thornberry KBE, Eliza’s father and host of the nature show Nigel Thornberry’s Animal World. His character was clearly based on Sir David Attenborough, a British icon who likewise received a knighthood in 1985, but I can also see the influence of the late Steve Irwin in there with the hands-on way Nigel interacts with wildlife. Having graduated from Oxford, Nigel put his considerable intellect to good use in spreading the word about conservation and animal welfare, and he really knows his stuff – the man is a walking encyclopaedia on animals, often dropping fun facts for his family and the audience.\n\nIt’s easy to see how Nigel became so popular during the show’s run. At a time when most cartoons either shoved the parent characters into the background or omitted them altogether, he was a welcome change of pace as a loving, if rather bumbling father who played an active role in his children’s lives. He and Eliza got along particularly well as they shared the same passion for nature, although he was sometimes perturbed by her recklessness (even if it was rare to see him outright angry). Debbie’s teenage tantrums were more perplexing to him, but he was still very supportive of her too, while Donnie’s manic energy kept him on his toes. However, far from being simply portrayed as “the father”, Nigel’s relationship with his wife, Marianne, was also fully fleshed out and endearingly romantic, making them both feel like real people with their own lives apart from their children.\n\nNigel was generally a jolly and genial chap with an almost childlike sense of fun, but while he was an expert at reading animals, he wasn’t so comfortable with humans – it was always funny to watch him struggling to understand sarcasm or straining to think of a punishment when his daughters messed up, not to mention occasionally driving Marianne up the wall with his antics on their shoots. (I personally got a kick out of his wonderful butchery of various local place names, although you have to give him credit for always trying to use the local language wherever they went).\n\nYet despite his awkwardness, Nigel’s earnest nature and fierce love for his family quickly made him a fan favourite, a feeling which still lingers today even long after the show itself has faded from memory. Those episodes where he pampered Marianne on Mother’s Day, coached an embarrassed Debbie through her PE lessons and built an igloo with his bare hands to protect Eliza from a blizzard… those are why we all really loved Nigel.\n\nMuch like the mothers on Rugrats, Marianne Thornberry was another great role model for kids to look up to. Serving as the entire camera crew for her husband’s show, not to mention its editor, she had the technical know-how to actually put the show together and upload the footage to the foundation who funded it. Tough and practical, Marianne was not easily fazed and always kept her head in a crisis, shifting into a kind of drill sergeant mode where she would issue instructions and designate tasks until the danger had passed. If Nigel was the heart of the family, Marianne was its backbone, keeping things running and always determined to carry on no matter what hardships they faced, but that’s not to say she was all stone and gristle.\n\nOne of the most relatable things about Marianne was her tendency towards insecurity, especially about her abilities as a mother. Unlike her more naïve husband, Marianne was well aware of the dangers inherent in their lifestyle and would frequently worry about subjecting her children to it, particularly Eliza, who tended to wander off into the wilderness (in reality, of course, Marianne’s fears would be entirely justified). On several occasions Marianne was forced to threaten to send Eliza back to live in the states, which was usually enough to convince Eliza to repent for whatever crazy scheme she’d rushed into that episode.\n\nFor those who wondered why Debbie, who seemed to want that very life, was never subjected to this, it’s worth remembering that Marianne did accompany her to an interview at a boarding school and fully supported her daughter’s choice – which, in the end, was to stay with her family.\n\nWe learn over the course of the show that Marianne’s mother, Sophie, loving as she may be, is also very fussy and overprotective, with the result that Marianne was always having doubts about whether she’s a good mother. This wasn’t helped by her mother-in-law Cordelia, who had a similar attitude towards her son’s chosen career path – whenever a “care package” arrived from either of them, Marianne would panic and become, as Debbie put it, a “freaky super mom”, becoming downright paranoid about any perceived criticism of her motherhood (“NUNS? NUNS THINK I’M A BAD MOTHER?”).\n\nAt the end of the day, though, all it took was the reassurance of her children for Marianne to remember that she was, in fact, a kick-ass mother, who taught her girls numerous valuable life skills that they might not have picked up in a more conventional setting (such as basic mechanical repairs and first aid, to name a few). Marianne was also a fascinating character in her own right, with a colourful backstory (remember those tales of her rodeo days?) and the perfect dry wit to counteract her husband’s free spirit, rounded out by the very human flaws of pride and insecurity. Whether she was sharing stories in a Bhutanese tent with Debbie, bareback riding elephants through India with Eliza, or trying to teach Donnie table manners in the Amazon, one thing’s for certain – Marianne was one of the greatest cartoon mothers of her generation.\n\nOn the surface, the character of the Thornberry’s oldest daughter, Debbie, seemed like something of a stereotype. Sixteen years old with her long, blonde hair and distinct “valley girl” accent, Debbie started out as little more than the stock bratty teenage daughter, always whining about how unfair her life was or making life difficult for her little sister. However, as the episodes rolled by, we did come to see that there was far more to her than met the eye.\n\nTo some extent, you do feel sorry for Debbie when you watch the show as an adult. Just when she’s at an age where she should be having fun with her friends, focusing on her studies to build a solid foundation for a career, maybe getting a part-time job or experimenting with dating, where is she? Stuck in a motorhome with her family, constantly on the move, with little privacy or permanence in her life and only late-nineties Internet to keep her in touch with her peers. She can’t be blamed for having little interest in her parents’ profession (how many of us do, after all?), but she’s unfortunate in that the nature of their work forces her to accompany them the entire time, which naturally ticks her off.\n\nDebbie’s clashes with Eliza also seem to come from this fundamental difference between the two of them; she sees Eliza as a “nerd” for embracing the life of a naturalist so readily and cannot relate to her sister, but it’s sometimes implied that perhaps she’s a little jealous; on certain occasions when a shoot involved something that appealed to her, Debbie would jump at the chance to go in Eliza’s place for once, suggesting that she does in fact like spending time with her parents, if they would only do things she enjoyed more often. Marianne, to her credit, recognised Debbie’s frustrations and would try to spend some quality time with her whenever she could – even if this didn’t always go to plan, Debbie clearly appreciated it. That’s not to say Nigel neglected her, but they certainly had less in common.\n\nIn the end, what kept Debbie from feeling too obnoxious was her hidden sensitive side, which we began to see more of as the seasons went on. As pointed out above, when actually given the choice to live a more settled life at a boarding school, she ultimately couldn’t bring herself to leave her family, proving that she truly does like being with them. She also comes to Eliza’s rescue many times throughout the show, so much so that the writers even had her lampshade how old it was getting when she had to do it again in the final episode. Debbie seemed to have a problem with tactlessness which caused many characters (and viewers) to find her rude, but she was always sorry when her bluntness hurt other’s feelings and would go out of her way to make it up to them. When all is said and done, having a sister like Debbie might not be such a bad thing – she always had Eliza’s back when it really mattered, however annoying the “chimp chatter” might have been.\n\nTo finish off the main cast, we have this curious little lad called Donnie who, as the opening theme song tells us, was picked up by the Thornberrys in the wild. Nicknamed the “wild child” by Debbie, he is a literal feral child who the family discovered on a shoot one day in Borneo, and for most of the series he was used primarily as comic relief with his zany outbursts and unintelligible gibbering. (I’m guessing the Bornean thing was to link him in to the whole “Wild Man of Borneo” phrase, which was actually a nickname for various “freak show” performers of the nineteenth century).\n\nThe strange thing was, once his origins were finally addressed in the four-part special The Origin of Donnie in the fourth season, the little lad turned out to have a surprisingly tragic backstory. He was born to a couple named Michael and Lisa who were, in many respects, a lot like the Thornberrys, travelling around the world in their work as primatologists and even meeting Nigel and Marianne once in their early days in the business. Sadly, on one trip to study orangutans in Borneo, Donnie’s parents were brutally murdered by poachers after trying to stop the thugs from slaughtering the apes to steal their babies (god, was this show really for kids?). The orangutans, remembering the couple’s kindness, took little Donnie in and cared for him until he was found, perhaps months or years later, by the Thornberrys.\n\nFrom then on, they treated the boy as one of their own while continuing to try to track down his real parents, before finalising their official adoption of him after learning Michael and Lisa’s fate in the special. It’s all very heart-warming, but it’s a shame we weren’t made privy to all this earlier in the show’s run, as it has to be said that Donnie added little to it before his character was given this long overdue expansion. His primary role in most episodes seemed to be to annoy Debbie with his rambunctiousness; as she was usually the only one staying home, she was often lumped with babysitting duty, but his tendency to wreck everything in sight always wound up working her last nerve (one memorable occasion had her trying to ship him back to Borneo from Africa in a box). Still, she and Donnie did seem to develop a certain bond after spending so much time together, and she was just as choked up as the others at the thought of losing him. He may have been a pain, but he was her pain.\n\nDarwin, too, often found him more of an annoyance than anything (diva that he was), but the more patient Eliza found some success in channelling his wild energy into her many wilderness excursions, even if she did often lose him while doing so. It’s no surprise that the least uptight member of the family was the one Donnie got along the best with, but funnily enough, the writers hinted several times at a more cultured past buried somewhere deep in his subconscious. He is shown in brief moments to understand table etiquette and speaks a few words of French, but none of this was given any further weight until the special.\n\nLooking back at the show now, you have to wonder what became of Donnie as he got older. We last see him as a five-year-old (or roughly, anyway, since the Thornberrys don’t know his actual birthday), and he’s still unable to speak English or do any real studying at that point. Sadly, almost no real feral children have successfully made the adjustment to human society, although since Donnie was found so young, there may still be hope for him. Can you imagine him in college? I bet he’d be a literal party animal.\n\nGiven the ever-changing locations of a show like this, the supporting cast wasn’t very large as it was difficult to include recurring characters. One of the more notable was Tyler Tucker, a cousin of Eliza’s, the son of Marianne’s sister Nancy and her husband Dennis. Played by popular nineties star Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Tyler was introduced in the third season when he came to stay with the Thornberrys as they travelled across Africa, presumably to give Eliza someone her own age to interact with… and to attract Home Improvement fans. (By the way, who gets a multinational safari for their thirteenth birthday? Damn, give me this kid’s life).\n\nEliza and Tyler didn’t get along too well, to put it mildly. It wasn’t hard to see why; they had very similar personalities which clashed violently, both being headstrong leaders who hated to be told what to do, but Tyler’s slight age advantage gave him a haughty and superior air that would have driven anyone up the wall. Of course, pride goes before a fall, and cocky Tyler was soon humbled by his experiences in the wild; for all his boasting, Eliza knew that he was really little more than an entitled city mouse who’d had no experience of the stuff he’d been reading about on the Internet, so she was often forced to save his butt after he got himself into trouble yet again.\n\nI didn’t mind him, personally, as I always loved to see Eliza puncturing his ego (even if I didn’t like her much), but apparently he was no favourite for most fans. The writers quickly cottoned on to this and Tyler didn’t reappear after the third season, although that may also have been due to how short those seasons were.\n\nIn keeping with the focus on the family dynamic, the show developed not just Eliza’s parents but also both sets of her grandparents. On the maternal side were Frank and Sophie Hunter, the latter of whom showed up in a few episodes while her husband only appeared once (it is explained on that occasion that his poor health prevents him from travelling much).\n\nSophie, played by TV icon Betty White, was a kind but very fussy woman who somehow managed to be both completely out of place and yet totally at home in the wilderness. While the family did look forward to her visits, they also tended to put Marianne on edge as she feared her mother wouldn’t approve of the state of things – yet she needn’t have worried, as Sophie seemed to find comfort in cleaning and would quickly take charge of the domesticities once she arrived. The funny thing was, Sophie proved surprisingly versatile when she was abroad, certainly more so than you’d expect of such a fastidious person; she was shown to take an active interest in the local cultures of the places she visited and would prepare for every eventuality with highly specific “classes” at her rec centre, with a running gag involving the seemingly-bottomless purse from which she would produce all manner of random things to aid the plot.\n\nFrank, in his sole appearance at the end of the third season, was more easy-going than his wife, wearing his love of the outdoors on his sleeve and making him a favourite of Eliza’s. We learn in the episode of their many happy memories exploring together, and they bonded further over their frustrations of being limited by their respective ages. It’s a pity his health prevented him from appearing more often, as he was a warm and welcome presence who helped to soften Sophie’s fussy edge (he no doubt owed much of this presence to Earl Hamner Jr. of The Waltons fame, who co-wrote the episode).\n\nThen there were Nigel’s parents, Col. Radcliffe Thornberry and his wife, Cordelia, who lived on a large estate in Scotland and appeared only once in the main series, although they did also get to appear in the film.\n\nThere’s not much to be said about them given how little we see of them, but you don’t have to look far to see where Nigel got his taste for adventure from (not to mention his looks, or his distinctive plummy voice). Radcliffe was remarkably like his son in many ways, so it’s no surprise that Eliza was just as close to this grandfather as her other one – you wonder if the two blokes ever met, as they would have probably enjoyed a good hike together. Like Nigel, Radcliffe was much sharper than his whimsical demeanour might suggest, having once been a high-ranking member of the RAF, and he taught Nigel much of what he knew about caring for animals in his youth. His light-hearted nature balanced out his wife’s sterner constitution, but he loved her just as dearly as his son loved Marianne.\n\nCordelia, too, was deeply fond of both her husband and her son, even if she didn’t always agree with their life choices. In contrast with Sophie’s more bumbling manner, Cordelia expressed her disapproval in a sterner, more forbidding way – she spent much of the Sir Nigel special where she’s introduced nagging Nigel and Marianne to settle down for the sake of the children, a theme she returned to in the film before finally realising how much they need one another. Like any mother, Cordelia simply had high hopes for her son and urged him to accept a potential tenured professorship in the special, though she did ultimately capitulate to his decision to continue working as a naturalist when she saw that he was happier doing so. Nigel may have found it tough to stand up to his mother at times, but he knew she always had his best interests at heart.\n\nKip on the left, Biederman on the right\n\nOutside of family members, perhaps the most significant of the show’s recurring characters were these two – Kip O’Donnell and Neil Biederman, a pair of ne’er-do-wells who cropped up in several episodes throughout the first two seasons before mysteriously vanishing. These two were the closest the show had to proper antagonists, frequently running into the Thornberrys on their travels as they carried out their various nefarious plans. At times, they worked as generic poachers, but they were also involved in animal trafficking, illegal logging, environmental contamination and even fraudulent racing, to name a few of their crimes. Eventually, they were dropped as the show began to rely on more realistic villains-of-the-week and became less cartoonish.\n\nKip was the brains of the operation, a grizzled old bandit with an outlandish design reminiscent of a pirate (complete with peg-leg and eye-patch), who was always growling away at his subordinate in his sinister voice. The hammier Biederman was the more innocent of the pair, a kind of punch-clock villain who just went along with whatever Kip did and often messed it up (including one catastrophic occasion when he set fire to an oil spill). The crooks were always caught or disabled in the end, as per status quo, leaving them with a worryingly deep-seated hatred for Eliza, who was often responsible for thwarting them (seriously, I hope she watched her back once she got into the field herself down the line).\n\nNot surprisingly, Eliza accumulated a number of friends and pen-pals during her travels, but only a couple were ever given multiple appearances. One of these was a boy called Ben Adams who lived in Europe with his father Hayden; he made just two appearances in the first and second seasons and was teased as a possible romantic interest for Eliza. We see that Ben is in awe of Eliza and her lifestyle, especially the many exciting activities she gets to take part in, so for his main appearance Eliza spent most of the episode trying to hide from him the fact that she didn’t know how to snowboard. His earlier appearance involved Eliza desperately trying to hide some embarrassing home movies from him, so she clearly cared a great deal about what he thought of her.\n\nLess realistic was the introduction of this guy, Shane G., a pop star who came to stay with the Thornberrys for a few episodes in the final season as a kind of publicity stunt designed to help his image. Joining the family in Alaska, he was initially set up as a rather stereotypical spoiled celebrity who was too sheltered to appreciate the dangers of the wilderness, using nature as a “backdrop” like some kind of primitive Instagrammer, but thankfully the writers avoided going down the tired old route of having him turn out to be a total fraud. He did genuinely care about nature, but just didn’t have any experience with it – once Eliza got past this, she was able to help open him up to what working with animals is really like.\n\nFor her part, Eliza was rather starstruck by him at first, although she took pains to hide it from him after realising how much he disliked the typical “groupies” idolising him. In a fairly standard arc, the two of them got past their early misunderstandings and hit it off, although of course no romance would be complete without a tragic parting at the last minute, so Shane had to reluctantly return to his hectic lifestyle at the end of the last episode, leaving Eliza experiencing her first heartbreak.\n\nAs a kid, I didn’t care about this storyline at all. It was just so ridiculous and felt like an obvious, desperate attempt by the writers to try to recapture a fading audience at the end of the show’s run. I understand that giving Eliza her first serious crush was an easy way of symbolising her burgeoning adolescence, but the fact that the show ended with this made it all feel underwhelming, as we left Eliza just as she was starting to mature at last. Having Debbie get roped into this weird love triangle with her four-year-younger sister, both competing for the same guy’s attention, was also unsettling, although it was implied that Debbie was interested more in being associated with Shane’s fame than the guy himself.\n\nFinally, let’s look at an assortment of other minor characters who appeared in at least two episodes each. There’s Dr. Jomo Mbeli, Nigel’s best friend from Oxford who worked in the African national park system and once helped him save an elephant from poachers in their student days, a life-changing incident which convinced Nigel to make his career as a naturalist. He shared many of his friend’s unusual quirks, such as a penchant for old music and kippers, and the two got along like a house on fire, with the Thornberrys apparently making regular visits to his sanctuary.\n\nThere were also Juka and Makai, a young Masai boy and his grandfather who were set up as old friends of the Thornberry family in a couple of episodes. I always liked the way the series showcased people from other cultures, but these were some of the only ones to make a second appearance. Juka even got some proper character development (unusual for such a minor player), as he started out arrogant and cocky in his first appearance before becoming more insecure by his second. Tyler was present on that occasion and wasted no time in lording it over Juka until the older boy regained his confidence. Strangely, Juka’s two younger siblings were only featured alongside him in his first appearance; no mention is made of them in later episodes.\n\nAmong Eliza’s many animal friends, giant panda Mei-Mei and her cub Shi Shou were notable for making two appearances, first in the second season and then again in the third. Debbie encountered the very young Shi Shou just as the cub opened his eyes for the first time, leading to a mix-up in which he mistook her for his mother and began following her about like a puppy, but Eliza was able to track down his real mother in the end and reunite the pair. Later, Eliza encountered them at the Great Wall and mistook them for victims of a poaching scheme, only to find that they’re actually being relocated after a fire devastated their old home.\n\nThen there was Santusa, a supremely annoying llama whom Eliza befriended in the Andes. She was notable for her tendency to over-describe human activities with a vague sort of onomatopoeia and was talkative but rather reckless, which made her no favourite of Darwin’s. On Eliza’s first visit, Santusa encouraged her to run away from Nigel and thus led to her getting lost and nearly killed in a blizzard, but she did make up for it somewhat by informing Eliza of her father’s heroism after the fact. During a later visit, karma came back to bite Santusa when Debbie llama-napped her and forced her to scale a volcano, but they all got out safely in the end thanks to some quick-thinking from Debbie.\n\nStory Overview\n\nJust like Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys was another slice-of-life show with no particular plotline. Rather, it simply followed the adventures of the family as they travelled the globe filming their nature documentaries – which I’m sure you’ll agree was plenty interesting enough.\n\nOf course, the writers did take enormous liberties in their depiction of such a lifestyle; when Nigel’s real-life counterpart, David Attenborough, films his shows, he’s assisted by vast armies of technicians, cameramen, editors and writers, not to mention the many producers, researchers and cultural experts required to handle all the legal red tape. I know this is set in a pre-9/11 world, but how are the Thornberrys able to transport an illegitimate child and a literal chimpanzee across international borders with no hassle? Imagine the nightmare of organising all those visas and vaccinations! In the show, the family seem to simply drive (or sail) from place to place with little attention paid to such details (which I know would be boring to depict in a kid’s show, admittedly). That’s not even getting into how Marianne is able to single-handedly put together a television-quality programme, either!\n\nA typical episode generally revolved around Eliza’s latest efforts to solve a problem she’d discovered among the local animal populace, with the B-plot focusing on either Nigel and Marianne’s filming or Debbie’s daily life, which often had her being plagued by Donnie. Along the way, a myriad of minor characters (human and otherwise) were introduced that taught children about the sheer variety of animals and cultures our world contains, often featuring accurately depicted behaviours, festivals, traditions or mythology which would sometimes have a direct bearing on the episode’s story. (This was one of my favourite aspects of the show, personally).\n\nThere was some level of continuity, with events from previous episodes being referenced occasionally and a few recurring characters, but there was nothing special pulling the characters along from the beginning of the series to the end. (At least it didn’t have them celebrating multiple Christmases at the same ages, like the Rugrats). That could be why, in the final brief season, that crazy soap opera storyline was introduced with Shane G. coming to stay with the family in Alaska. This will-they-won’t-they story spanned most of the season and clashed awkwardly with the show’s typical format, leaving many fans feeling disenchanted with it. For my part, I re-watched a few of the episodes for my review and didn’t hate them, even if they are still far less engaging than the more animal-centric ones were.\n\nOver the course of the show, the Thornberrys visited all seven continents, often spending multiple episodes in one region (the result of the writers’ enthusiasm for certain places) and sometimes going to some surprisingly obscure locales. Australia and Indonesia got the most focus with nine episodes each (although four of the Indonesian ones were Donnie’s origin special), with Tanzania close behind at eight episodes, Brazil with five and Peru with four. Elsewhere, some of the many diverse countries the family visited included Argentina, Bhutan, Botswana, Ecuador, Finland, Madagascar, Mexico, Mongolia, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, Switzerland and Vietnam. Only in that pesky last season did they “stagnate” somewhat, spending five of its eight episodes in Alaska – although it was a treat to see them showing off the state’s many beautiful national parks. This was also the season where they finally visited Antarctica (glad they got there before the show ended).\n\nSimilar diversity could be found in the many animals the show featured, some of which were the subjects of Nigel’s documentaries. Naturally, the “animal of the week” was often one of the “bigguns” like a lion, elephant or rhino, but the show took pains to bring many other less well-known species to kids’ attention, especially endangered ones. Among these were the African clawless otter, Amazon river dolphin, Andean condor, angler fish, Arctic hare, Asiatic black bear, aye-aye, bird-eating spider, black-necked crane, caracal, Darwin’s finches (how appropriate), dingo, dugong, Eurasian lynx, fossa, Galapagos tortoise, giant Pacific octopus, great crested grebe, ibex, Komodo dragon, manta ray, peccary, Przewalski’s horse, rock hyrax, snail kite, Steller’s sea eagle, Sumatran rhino and the vampire bat. Looking at that list, the show’s thorough commitment to teaching children about various ecosystems and their flora and fauna is still something to be admired today.\n\nEpisode Breakdown\n\nHere’s a selection of some of the most significant episodes from the show’s run, shown in order of production with their release date (for some reason, many of the episode titles were puns, or random plays on famous phrases and film titles):\n\nPilot episode, 1998 – Pilot\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeptember 1st, 1998: Flood Warning – First episode, which introduced the core cast\n\nSeptember 15th, 1998: Matadi or Bust – The debut of Kip and Biederman, recurring villains\n\nOctober 22nd, 1998: Naimina Enkiyio – One of the more well-known episodes due to its scary imagery\n\nMarch 16th, 1999: Lost & Foundation – A major source of soundbites for Nigel Thornberry memes (“I’ll do this, with my hands!” “Blaargh-argh-ga-ha!”)\n\nSeason 2\n\nAugust 25th, 1999: Chimp off the Old Block – Darwin takes Eliza to meet his old troop in the Congo\n\nSeptember 7th, 1999: Two’s Company – an episode featuring a stand-in for the real-life Galapagos tortoise Lonesome George, who gets to mate with a female of his species (sadly, the same was not true for the actual George, who passed in 2012)\n\nSeptember 15th, 1999: Thornberry Island – Notable for being the only episode in which Eliza does not talk to any animals besides Darwin (although her powers are still a plot point)\n\nSeptember 16th, 1999: Dances with Dingoes – the first time anyone comes close to finding out Eliza’s secret, when Debbie sees her playing and talking with dingoes\n\nNovember 29th, 1999: Have Yourself a Thornberry Little Christmas – The Christmas special\n\nFebruary 24th, 2000: Forget Me Not – One of the show’s most poignant episodes, in which Eliza witnesses the death of an elephant that her father once saved from poachers\n\nFebruary 26th, 2000: Gift of Gab – a flashback episode which reveals the origin of Eliza’s powers, and how she met Darwin\n\nMarch 6th, 2000: Bogged Down – one of the show’s more gripping episodes, as Nigel nearly dies after being stung by a venomous rockfish\n\nSeason 3\n\nOctober 2nd, 2000: Tyler Tucker, I Presume – the debut of Eliza’s cousin Tyler, who became a semi-regular character\n\nOctober 6th, 2000: Birthday Quake – a birthday special, for Tyler\n\nOctober 28th, 2000: Spirited Away – a Día de Muertos special\n\nNovember 22nd, 2000: A Family Tradition – a Thanksgiving special\n\nDecember 27th, 2000: Happy Old Year – a New Year’s special\n\nFebruary 14th, 2001: Operation Valentine – a Valentine’s Day special and one of the show’s more harrowing episodes, as Eliza gets appendicitis\n\nApril 1st, 2001: April Fool’s Day – an April Fool’s Day special, and Tyler’s last appearance\n\nMay 10th, 2001: Gem of a Mom – a Mother’s Day special\n\nSeason 4\n\nAugust 18th, 2001: The Origin of Donnie – a four-part special exploring Donnie’s backstory, which comprised the bulk of this very short season\n\nOctober 31st, 2001: The Trouble With Darwin – renowned primatologist Jane Goodall guest stars\n\nSeason 5\n\nFebruary 3rd, 2003: The Wild Snob-Berry – the debut of Shane G., who became a regular for the last season (also the first episode in which Debbie is aware of Eliza’s powers)\n\nMarch 30th, 2003: Sir Nigel – a two-part special which introduces Nigel’s parents and sees him getting a knighthood, leading up to the events of The Wild Thornberrys Movie (but released after it)\n\nJune 11th, 2004: Eliza Unplugged – the 91st and final episode, airing over a year after the previous one\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nThis was far and away my favourite cartoon during my childhood, which is saying something given the general level of quality on offer at the time. Perhaps that just makes me a massive nerd, but I’ll still defend it to the end – not that I’m above acknowledging its faults. Sure, Eliza’s bossiness could be hard to stomach and the plots weren’t always the most inspired, but I couldn’t get enough of this family and their adventures touring the globe; Indonesia is still at the top of my travel list and I’ve always dreamed of going to Bhutan, all thanks to the admiration this show inspired in me for our beautiful planet. But enough mush – let’s run through the seasons.\n\nLike most other Klasky Csupo shows, the first season of the Thornberrys had rather sketchy and basic animation, with the bulk of it taking place in either east Africa or Brazil. The episodes at this stage mostly stuck to the established formula: Eliza wanders off and meets an animal in need, but then gets in too deep and needs Darwin or Debbie’s help to make things right. My favourites from this season included Gold Fever (a great adventure, though it lacked animals), Matadi or Bust, Temple of Eliza, Valley Girls, Blood Sisters (god, the “professor” in this was a riot), Nigel Knows Best (one of his greatest moments), The Dragon and the Professor and Born to Be Wild.\n\nIn the second season, the animation and general artistic quality improved, and the writers began to explore some more varied biomes and cultures, although the basic format of the episodes remained the same. This was arguably when the show was at its best, working to correct many dangerous misconceptions about animals and teaching kids a more nuanced way of approaching conservation efforts. Among the better episodes from this season were Rain Dance, Koality and Kuantity, You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yeti, Reef Grief, Thornberry Island (my favourite episode as a kid, although it had no animals at all besides Darwin), You Otter Know, Dear Diary, Black and White and Mom All Over, Song for Eliza, Bogged Down, Cheetahs Never Prosper and Every Little Bit Alps.\n\nAlong with another animation bump, we got more of the same high quality episodes in the show’s third season, while the cast saw a bit of a shake-up with the dropping of Kip and Biederman, the addition of Tyler Tucker and the returns of a few popular characters from earlier seasons. A few favourites from this season included Time Flies, Tyler Tucker, I Presume, Queen of Denial, The Legend of Ha Long Bay (another place on my travel list), Spirited Away (love the title), Happy Campers, All Work and No Play (a very soothing episode), Hello, Dolphin! (another musical reference there!) and The Anniversary.\n\nAfter this, though, the show seemed to lose traction. The fourth and fifth seasons were strangely truncated, as though the writers had suddenly been informed that they had to wrap things up quickly (or perhaps it was just because they were busy with the upcoming theatrical film). After the third season wrapped in the spring of 2001, the fourth consisted of only six episodes, four of which made up the special The Origin of Donnie, released that same summer. The next episode, another special featuring Jane Goodall, aired in October, with the last one following months later in mid-2002.\n\nAfter the film that December came season five, which turned out to be the final one. This consisted of just eight episodes, the first seven of which came out in early 2003 a few months ahead of the second theatrical film, which was a Rugrats crossover. Confusingly, two of those episodes made up the Sir Nigel special which was supposed to lead into the events of the first film, making you wonder if they were held back from the fourth season… for some reason. At least Look Who’s Squawking saw the family finally get to Antarctica, the only continent they hadn’t visited up to then.\n\nThen, as if this season wasn’t odd enough, the eighth and final episode didn’t air until over a year after the preceding one, arriving with little advertisement in the early summer of 2004. It was an unremarkable and overlooked end to a show which deserved much better, and I only wish I knew why it randomly got the shaft in this way (though I suspect the troubles between Klasky Csupo and Nickelodeon around that time had something to do with it).\n\nLegacy –\n\nRugrats was a powerhouse that became a defining show of the decade, but while The Wild Thornberrys enjoyed modest popularity at the time, it had nothing like the power of its predecessor. The only notable recommendations of it I could find were from Common Sense Media, who gave it a full five star rating and praised it for encouraging young viewers to be kind towards animals and teaching them about other cultures (although several commenters complained about Debbie “ruining it”), and The Native Voice, who complimented “its commitment to fun, adventure, detail, accuracy and honesty”. Apparently, the show has a stronger following in Australia, where some have compared the Thornberrys to Bindi Irwin and her family (coincidentally, she was born in 1998, just before the show debuted).\n\nOver time, the show accrued a couple of Environmental Media Awards and Genesis Awards for Television, so it wasn’t entirely without merit. Despite this, sixteen years on from its conclusion (good grief, that long already?) it seems to have been largely forgotten – except for one character. Yes, as I’m sure you’ll remember, Nigel Thornberry enjoyed a brief resurgence as a meme star around 2011/2012, where he cropped up in numerous remixes of music videos or pasted into Disney film mashups, all accompanied by the sultry sound of his unmistakeable voice (the voice clips were mostly drawn from the season one episode Lost & Foundation).\n\nI was overjoyed to see him crop up again in a more modern format, as it was proof that the show did still retain some appeal into the Internet era, but I’m still sad that so few fans of it seem to remain. This might be partially because it hasn’t done too well in reruns, at least here in the UK; the last time I saw any episodes on TV was back around 2017, and that was only a handful. We did have a short-lived channel for nineties Nicktoons called Nicktoonsters that lasted barely a year from 2008 to 2009, but unfortunately I didn’t have access to that.\n\nLimited streaming options have also prevented it from remaining current, although I think it did used to be on Hulu. Nickelodeon did finally release all five seasons on Region 1 DVD through Amazon’s CreateSpace on-demand programme in 2010, before Shout! Factory gained the rights to it and re-released it (still in Region 1) between 2011 and 2013. (We still have a Region 1 DVD player at home just so I can play these, it’s insane). I doubt there will ever be a Region 2 DVD set given how obscure the show’s become, so I’ll have to hope my American ones don’t wear out anytime soon.\n\nSo, there we have it – that’s The Wild Thornberrys! I’m sorry this review was a bit self-centred, especially given how slow my posting schedule has become recently, as I know most of you probably don’t give two hoots about this show. That’s absolutely fine, but I just couldn’t have a blog dedicated to animation without talking about this as it meant so much to me growing up, and if this post convinces even one young reader to seek out the show and give it a chance, that would make it all worthwhile.\n\nI still have the 2002 theatrical film to cover next time (and it’s held up much better than you might think), but after that we’ll be moving away from Klasky Csupo for a good while, I promise! Later this week, Feeling Animated is celebrating another anniversary, so I’ll give you all a fuller update then. Until then, please do take care of yourselves, respect the decisions of your governments and take steps to keep your family and friends safe during the pandemic – it’ll all be over sooner if we can just ride it out indoors! (Hey, why not order The Wild Thornberrys DVDs if you haven’t seen it?) Turn your quarantine into an opportunity and remember – staaay animated!"
