        "text": "Porubsky\n\nCensus Sunday – The Rabe Family in 1910\n\nThe amazing thing about genealogy is that sometimes a record that seems so minor to your larger family history can lead to connections across multiple families and fill so many blanks. Such is the case of the Rabe family of Topeka, Kansas.\n\nLate in the night, when I tend to lose focus on my research, I bounce from ancestor to ancestor, adding records to my family tree as I stumble upon them. One record collection I was aware of but hadn’t searched in sometime was the “United States, Obituaries, American Historical Society of Germans from Russia, 1899-2012″ collection on Familysearch.org. As my Porubsky and Schulmeister ancestors are Volga Germans, I did a simple surname search for Porubsky. In the process, I located the obituary of Catherine Porubsky (Reeb).\n\nIn reading the names in this record, I instantly recognized Porubsky and Schwerdt. Reeb sounded familar, but my Topeka relatives were Rabes, not Reebs. Catherine Rabe was in my family tree, married to Matthew Porubsky, but she lacked parents in my database. In fact, I had three Rabes in my tree and they all lacked parents.\n\nCatherine E. Rabe was married to Matthew G. Porubsky\n\nElizabeth B. Rabe was married to Joseph A. Schulmeister\n\nJoseph Rabe was married to Caroline Schulmeister\n\nThe three Rabes lived in Topeka and were born within 15 years of each other. The original obituary named a sister Pauline, but no other siblings. Could they be related? I set to find out! I knew she was born in 1901 to John and Catherine, who were born in Russia. From other record sources, I also knew that Elizabeth was born in 1889 and Joseph in 1887. I located a Rabe family in the 1910 United States Census. The details I previously had confirmed from later census and marriage records fit well with this 1910 record.\n\nThe three Rabes in my family tree were siblings, and each had married into the family of my ancestors, making them my 3rd great aunts and uncles.\n\nState: Kansas\n\nCounty: Kearny\n\nTownship: Lakin\n\nName of Incorporated Place:\n\nWard of the City:\n\nEnumerated by me on the 2nd of May\n\nHenry H.

Alas, I am not the writer of wedding announcements. This picture was taken on Karl and Lizzie’s wedding day, Sunday, 26 August 1906.¹\n\nI don’t know the time of the service, and unlike other Christian denominations, Mass times for the Catholic churches don’t appear in The Topeka Daily Capital. The weather this Sunday was described as fair, with temperatures in the upper 70’s to lower 80’s.² Surely, for August in Topeka, it was a lovely day to get married.\n\nCarl and Elizabeth would see this marriage last fifty-five years, until Carl’s death in 1962. Elizabeth died in 1972.\n\nSources and Notes:\n\nNames appear in the marriage license announcement as Karl Bornesky and Lizzie Schulmeister. “Marriage Licenses,” The Topeka [KS] Daily Capital, 26 Aug 1906, page 11, col 4; digital image, (http://www.newspapers.com : accessed 7 Aug 2016), Newspapers.com.\n\n“Weather Conditions,” The Topeka [KS] Daily Capital, 26 Aug 1906, page 1, col 5; digital image, (http://www.newspapers.com : accessed 7 Aug 2016), Newspapers.com.\n\nCarl Porubsky and Elizabeth Schulmeister Porubsky, photograph, taken in Topeka, Kansas, on 26 August 1906; digital image, photograph of original, taken 2016 by Joseph Lowry; privately held by Barbara Viti, [address for private use], Tallmadge, Ohio; Two young adults in marriage outfits, one a dark 3-button suit and the other a white gown with flowers; Provenance is Carl and Elizabeth Porubsky to Caroline Porubsky Wolford to Barbara Wolford Viti.\n\nPhoto of the Day – January 6, 2015\n\nMy great grandmother Caroline Porubsky Wolford had the gift of the gab, a traditionally Irish phrase, but one that applies nonetheless to this Volga German lady. From her home in Topeka, she made regular phone calls back east to her daughter Barb and granddaughters Julie, Marie and Becky in Youngstown. I’m guessing this snapshot was taken sometime in the 1980’s while great grandma made one of those calls.\n\nCensus Sunday – 1910 U.S. Census for Mathias Porubsky and Family\n\nClick to enlarge\n\nThe 1910 Federal Census was the first for Mathias Porubsky and his family. Though they had been in the United States for 10 years, they missed the 1900 Census by just a few months, having arrived in Baltimore in June. Census enumerations are typically conducted in April. Reading the information below, there is so much interesting information to be gleaned. First of all, after just 9 years in the United States, the family owned a home free of a mortgage. Of course, many people in the household were working to support the family and probably help pay for that house. Mathias and sons Johannes and Joseph worked in the railroad shops, most likely for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Even daughter Elizabeth, age 16, works as a laborer in a box factory.\n\nThe Porubsky household was home to three generations. Their daughter Ann lived in the home with her husband Andrew Wasinger and their son Karl. Two boarders also lived there, who no doubt served as a source of additional income to the family. Interestingly, members of the Kaberline family lived on either side of the Porubsky’s. Mathias grandson Charles (late the owner of Porubsky’s Deli) would marry Lydia Kaberline in the 1940s.\n\nState: Kansas\n\nCounty: Shawnee\n\nName of Incorporated Place: Topeka City\n\nWard of the City: 1\n\nEnumerated by me on the 21th day of April\n\n*blank*, Enumerator\n\nSupervisor’s District: 7\n\nEnumeration District: 142\n\nSheet No. 3B\n\nDwelling No. 64\n\nFamily No. 68\n\nAddress: 600 N Quincy Street\n\nPorubsky, Mathias, head, male, white, 53 years old, married 27 years.

Mathias Porubsky; digital image, Ancestry.com (http://www.ancestry.com : accessed 20 August 2014): FHL microfilm: 1374470. National Archives microfilm publication Roll T624_457.\n\nTreasure Chest Thursday – Manifest of the SS Roland\n\nOne hundred and fourteen years ago today, my 3rd great grandparents Mathias and Christina Porubsky, their son Carl and five of his siblings were on an adventure at sea. The Porubsky’s had left their Volga German community in Kamenka, Russia, perhaps to escape the Tsar and policies of assimilation and were en route to Topeka, Kansas. It was there that an enclave of Volga Germans had established themselves. They had set out aboard the SS Roland of Norddeutscher (North German) Lloyd. At 345 feet, the Roland was just a few dozen feet longer than today’s Staten Island Ferry. They sailed from Breman, Germany and were en route to Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe Porubsky family was among up to 800 people stuffed below deck in 3rd class. On June 22, 1900, they arrived at the passenger terminal along the Patapsco River and proceeded overland to Kansas.\n\nThis manifest marks their journey to a new life in America. At the time of his arrival, Mathias Porubsky was a 44-year old laborer; his wife Christina was 38. An uncle had paid their way, although the identity and relationship of this uncle remains unknown. They arrived with $20 in their pockets (about $550 in today’s dollars). Checkmarks indicate that all but the youngest two could read and write.\n\nThe manifest as located through FamilySearch.org\n\nThe manifest as located through Ancestry.com\n\nFinding the above images was not without it’s small challenges. Both Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org have the manifest in their record collections but neither is perfect. The two sites, which are the largest genealogical record holders in the world, only sporadically overlap so it’s not always the case that both sites will have the same record.\n\nI retrieved the Ancestry.com manifest because it appeared as a ‘hint’ on Mathias Porubsky’s page. Ancestry.com hints allow users to quickly identify records that may be related to their ancestor and attach them to their family tree. Unfortunately, many people accept every single hint without closely examining the record to ensure it belongs to their ancestor. The Ancestry.com record was poorly scanned, as it is crooked and has several columns (18 and 19) chopped up. That said, the index (transcription) of the manifest was spot-on and I was to quickly find my ancestors on the page.\n\nThe FamilySearch.org document is a very clean scan, but slightly darker. Unfortunately, a very poor transcription for this document made it much harder to locate. The ship was listed as the SS Poland, instead of the SS Roland. I couldn’t even begin to tell you how the family name was listed because numerous searches failed to turn up anything. Having already located the Ancestry.com version of the manifest, I used my search skills knowledge to search for a simpler surname I knew was further down the same page. Sure enough, after I located ship mate Joseph Zadja, I scrolled up to find the Porubsky family.\n\nHaving these types of documents tells a lot about the travel conditions my ancestors endured to arrive at a new life. When paired with other documents, we can start to piece together a life story, which is the ultimate goal for any genealogist.\n\nSources:\n\n“Baltimore, Passenger Lists, 1820-1948 and 1954-1957,” index and images, Ancestry.com (http://interactive.ancestry.com/8679/mdt844_19-0177/696872?backurl=&ssrc=pt_t28087067_p5130324876_kpidz0q3d5130324876z0q26pgz0q3d32768z0q26pgplz0q3dpid&backlabel=ReturnRecord : accessed 18 Jun 2014), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, DC; Records of the US Customs Service, RG36; Series: T844; Roll: 19\n\n“Maryland, Baltimore Passenger Lists, 1820-1948,” index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1942-29149-8032-62?cc=2018318 : accessed 18 Jun 2014), 1891-1948 (NARA T844) > 19 – Jun 7, 1900-Feb 25, 1901 > image 180 of 876; citing NARA microfilm publications M255, M596 and T844.\n\nTreasure Chest Thursday – Naturalization Index for Carl Porubsky\n\nMy great great grandfather Carl Porubsky arrived in the United States from Russia in 1900.

These index cards indicate that he was naturalized in the United States District Court in Topeka, Kansas on April 18, 1938. Witnesses to the naturalization include William W. Werner, a neighbor and his brother-in-law Harry Devlin, likewise a neighbor on Madison Street. Harry was married to Carl’s sister Elizabeth.\n\nFront. Click to enlarge.\n\nBack.

Obviously, they are blank most of the time but I loved that this one included a very specific date. Imagine Caroline in her house at 1015 N Madison bundling up for the Topeka winter and heading to a photo studio. Perhaps this is a school photo? For a church directory? Maybe my grandmother has an answer…\n\nPhoto from a family collection.\n\nFuneral Card Friday – Caroline B. Wolford\n\nI have a small collection of funeral cards. It seems that whenever a family member dies, I don’t take one funeral card. I take seven or eight. Thus, I have a lot of funeral cards for just a few relatives. My great grandmother Caroline lived to be 93 years old. I didn’t go to her funeral as I was closing out the first semester of my senior year of college in Cleveland and the funeral was 900 miles away in Topeka. I think my mom brought this back for me. A lovely quotation from the Prayer of Saint Francis is on the card.\n\n– Posted using BlogPress from my iPhone\n\nMilitary Monday – World War I Draft Registration of Carl Porubsky\n\nIn 1918 America was deeply involved in World War I and men were needed by the thousands to serve in the United States Army. The Selective Service Act of 1917 authorized the government to conscript men into service to fight overseas. On September 12, 1918, the pool was increased requiring all men 21-45 to register.\n\nWith wife Lizzie and daughter Caroline at home in Little Russia 33-year old Carl Porubsky, my great great grandfather, went to the local registration office and was registered for possible conscription into Uncle Sam’s Army.\n\nInterestingly, this draft card lists his name as Charles. I’m certain it’s for Carl. The date of birth, wife’s name, and address all align with other sources I have for Carl. Perhaps the woman transcribing it, Besse Buechner, heard ‘Charles’ in Carl’s heavy accent?\n\nFamily Recipe Friday – Porubsky’s Chili\n\nI haven’t been to Topeka in 20 years, but I’m certain that a small deli in Little Russia was putting out the same chili then that can be found there today. Topeka is the birthplace of my great grandmother Caroline Porubsky and an eponymous deli, Porubsky’s.\n\nPorubsky’s Deli at 508 N.E. Sardou Street was first opened by Charlie Porubsky in 1947. Charlie is my 1st cousin, 3x removed. For those of you who aren’t good at figuring out cousin relationships (which was me, before my interest in genealogy), I’ll break it down for you starting with my 3rd great grandmother, Christina Porubsky:\n\nCharles and my great grandmother Caroline were first cousins.\n\nCharlie’s grocery and deli soon became famous for two things: hot pickles and chili. Now, I say all of this having never been to Porubsky’s Deli. But there’s enough on the internet for me to believe this is true. There’s even a documentary:\n\nPorubsky’s chili recipe appears on a few different websites, and while I can’t verify its accuracy, I figured I would give it a try anyway and report back for my millions of loyal readers. So here, complete with photos, is the supposed Porubsky’s chili recipe:\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup chopped onions\n\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n2 pounds coarsely ground chuck\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n\n3 tablespoons chili powder\n\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n\n1 tablespoon sugar\n\n2 cups tomato sauce\n\nTwo 16-ounce cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed\n\nTobasco to taste\n\nSaltine crackers\n\nIn a large skillet or gallon pot, sauté the onions and garlic in the oil until they are soft.\n\nAdd the beef and salt. Cook until the beef is completely browned, breaking it up with a fork as it cooks. Drain off any excess fat.\n\nAdd the chili powder, cumin, Worcestershire, sugar, tomato sauce, and 2 cups water.\n\nBring the chili to a low boil and summer 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\nAdd the beans and simmer 15 minutes more.\n\nAdd the Tobasco and more salt, if desired.\n\nThis was delicious!\n\nThe chili was a winner in my book. A very simple beef and red bean chili with great flavor and mild heat. You could obviously jack that up with more Tabasco or by adding red pepper. I added a few dashes of Tabasco and it was perfect me for. If you’re looking for a great, simple recipe, give this one a try.\n\nLinks:\n\nPorubsky’s Transcendent Deli on Facebook\n\nSources:\n\nJane and Michael Stern.
