        "text": "Dolph Lundgren was born as Hans Lundgren in Stockholm, Sweden, to Sigrid Birgitta (Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Stockholm until the age of 13, when he moved in with his grandparents in Nyland, Ångermanland, Sweden. Despite an early interest in music and the fine arts, Dolph decided to follow in his father's footsteps and pursue an Engineering degree. After having completed his military service, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nIt was in the military when Dolph first came in contact with the martial arts. Five years later, he had become a world-class competitor in Japanese Karate and was deeply involved with a discipline that was to become an important part of his life. After graduating High School, Dolph spent considerable time studying in the United States and abroad on various academic scholarships. He attended Washington State University and Clemson University in South Carolina. In 1982, he received a scholarship to complete his Masters Degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. In 1983, he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, one of the world's top engineering schools.\n\nHowever, that same year, he decided to move to New York City and take up acting. He changed his forename to Dolph. He started studying drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop in Manhattan, not knowing how quickly his life was about to change. His film debut came in Im Angesicht des Todes (1985). However, it was his performance in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985) later that year that definitely got him noticed. After a 9-month audition process among 5,000 hopefuls, he was cast opposite writer-director Sylvester Stallone, as his Russian opponent, \"Ivan Drago\". Following the success of Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985), Lundgren moved to Los Angeles and has since starred in more than 30 feature films.\n\nLundgren portrayed the classic action-heroic lead in such films as Gary Goddard's Masters of the Universe (1987), Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991) co-starring Brandon Lee and Blackjack - Der Bodyguard (1998), by Hong-Kong action legend, John Woo. Lundgren has also continued to turning in memorable performances as the main adversary to other action-stars, most notably in Universal Soldier (1992) opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme, directed by Roland Emmerich, as well as Robert Longo's Vernetzt - Johnny Mnemonic (1995) opposite Keanu Reeves. In February 2004, Lundgren directed his first feature film, the thriller The Defender (2004), in which he also starred. In 2005, he directed and starred in yet another feature, The Mechanik (2005) (a.k.a \"The Mechanik\").\n\nIn January 2006, he finished principal photography of Das Ende der Götter (2006), a joint Italian/American/Spanish co-production, directed by Giulio Base, appearing opposite, among others, Daniele Liotti, Max von Sydow and F. Murray Abraham. In 2006, Lundgren starred in Diamond Dogs (2007), a Chinese/American co-production filmed on location in Mongolia. In 2007, he directed a modern day western shot in Texas, Missionary Man (2007). In 2009, he completed two new directorial efforts, the action-packed Command Performance (2009), which showcases Lundgren's longtime musical talents as a drummer; and the neo-noir thriller KGB - Killer, Gejagter, Beschützer (2010). Lundgren also reunited with co-stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone for Universal Soldier: Regeneration (2009) and the highly anticipated action blockbuster, The Expendables (2010).\n\nLundgren managed to not let his Hollywood career stand in the way of his athletic background. He has been awarded his Third Degree Black Belt by the World Karate Organization in Tokyo. His accomplishments include being the Captain of the Swedish National Karate Team, as well as a Champion of the Swedish, European and Australian Heavyweight Division titles. Lundgren still regularly performs Karate exhibitions at international tournaments worldwide. In addition, he was selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to serve as Team Leader of the 1996 U.S. Olympic Pentathlon Team during the Atlanta Games. He is actively involved in promoting the image of this sport. His production company, Thor Pictures, is developing several projects in which he will produce, star and/or direct. He is also a founding member of \"Group of Eight\", a New York theater group started in 1994.\n\nLundgren has reportedly been working on a fitness book and sports wear line for men, the creation and launch of a new eponymous brand, a licensing, media and publishing program, and the development of future entertainment and media projects. Lundgren was married to Anette Qviberg-Lundgren, an interior decorator and fashion designer, until their divorce in 2011. They had two daughters together.\n\nCourteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama, into an affluent Southern family. She is the daughter of Courteney (Bass) and Richard Lewis Cox (1930-2001), a businessman. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy's girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.\n\nShe became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.\n\nWhile modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Die Spezialisten unterwegs (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Familienbande (1982).\n\nIn 1989, Familienbande (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven's horror/comedy Scream - Schrei! (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox's film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.\n\nHailing from an English theatrical family, Christina Pickles is a beloved stage-trained actress who has enjoyed a rich and varied career that has allowed her to show her incredible range and great depth of character in her performances. She sets the bar for all at an entirely new height with this year's \"Outstanding Actress, Short Form, Comedy or Drama, Short Form\" for her critically lauded performance in \"Break a Hip\" earning a remarkable seventh Emmy nomination for a superior performance. Earlier, Christina earned an Emmy nod for her hilarious role on \"Friends\" as 'Ross' and 'Monica Geller's' mom adding to five nominations for her historic role on precedent-setting \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nProbably best known for her portrayal of \"Nurse Helen Rosenthal\" on the NBC hit hospital drama \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Judy Geller,\" the dysfunctional mother of Monica (Courtney Cox) and Ross (David Schwimmer), on the NBC smash comedy hit \"Friends,\" Christina was Emmy-nominated five times for \"St. Elsewhere\" and once for her indelible role on \"Friends.\"\n\nChristina just added her seventh Emmy nomination this summer for her hilarious and touching performance as \"Biz\" in the short-form comedy series \"Break A Hip.\" Guest stars and riveting performances surround her indelible character including those from Oscar winners Allison Janey, Octavia Spencer and Jim Rash as well as a laugh-out-loud turn from Peri Giipin. It was Christina five years ago that learned about the infectious storyline of \"Break A Hip\" and its protagonist, 'Biz,' insisting producer/director Cameron Watson turn this into the Short Form hit series you see today. It's the best in its space at a time when all of us are living longer and know a 'Biz' in our lives.\n\nChristina trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London before moving to New York where she was a member of The APA Repertory Company and enjoyed a luminous career starring on and Off-Broadway. After moving to Los Angeles for \"St. Elsewhere,\" she worked consistently in film and television establishing herself as a versatile actress able to perform both comedy and drama deftly. Film credits include \"The Wedding Singer,\" Baz Luhrmann's \"Romeo + Juliet,\" \"Grace of My Heart,\" and \"Legends of the Fall.\" As a voice-over artist, Christina can be heard in classic episodes of \"The Family Guy\" and as the spokesperson for Pavilions supermarket.\n\nBlue-eyed brunette Meg Foster was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on May 10, 1948 to David and Nancy. She has four siblings and grew up in Rowayton, Connecticut.

Throughout the '70s, she guest starred in numerous TV shows including Barnaby Jones (1973), Der Sechs-Millionen-Dollar-Mann (1974), and Hawaii Fünf-Null (1968), and played Hester Prynne, a young woman who has an affair with a pastor, in the miniseries Der scharlachrote Buchstabe (1979). Foster did not really come to attention until 1982, though, when she replaced Loretta Swit as Christine Cagney in Cagney & Lacey (1981); she herself was later replaced by Sharon Gless (CBS reportedly wanted a more \"feminine\" actress playing the role of the detective).\n\nFoster began to appear in more movies throughout the late '80s, primarily Masters of the Universe (1987), in which she played the nefarious Evil-Lyn. Other notable films include the satirical science fiction flick John Carpenter's Sie leben (1988), the horror sequel Stepfather II (1989), and the comedic martial arts movie Blinde Wut (1989) (Terry O'Quinn also appeared in the latter two).\n\nFoster continued to work prolifically throughout the '90s, mostly appearing in science fiction films. She also guest starred in many popular television shows such as Zurück in die Vergangenheit (1989), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), and Sliders - Das Tor in eine fremde Dimension (1995).\n\nAfter appearing in a 2000 episode of Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995), Foster took a decade-long break from the acting industry. She returned in 2011 with roles in indie flicks Das Herz eines Helden (2011) and Sebastian (2011), and had a villainous role as a revenge-seeking witch in Rob Zombie's '70s-esque horror movie The Lords of Salem (2012). Additionally, Foster appeared in the TV show The Originals (2013), as well as Pretty Little Liars (2010) and its short-lived spin-off Ravenswood (2013). She re-teamed with Rob Zombie in 2016 for his horror film 31 (2016), in which Foster plays a kidnapped carnival worker.\n\nFoster has a son, Christopher, with Ron Starr. At one point, she was married to actor Stephen McHattie.\n\nChelsea Field is an American actress from Glendale, California. Her first major role in film was playing the warrior woman Teela in the cult superhero film \"Masters of the Universe\" (1987). The film was the first live-action adaptation of the \" sword and planet\" media franchise \"Masters of the Universe\" by Mattel, though its script reportedly drew inspiration from Jack Kirby's \"Fourth World\" comic book franchise. Later in her career, Field had the recurring role of assistant district attorney Rita Deveraux in the police procedural series \"NCIS: New Orleans\" (2014-2021). Her character was introduced in the series' 3rd season and kept appearing until its 7th and last season.

Both films involved vengeful spirits who tormented both those who harmed them in life, and bystanders who happened to be in the vicinity of the intended victims. Field's first major television role was that of student nurse Samantha \"Sam\" Sullivan in the medical drama \"Nightingales\" (1989). The series was considered controversial at the time for focusing on the sex lives of student nurses, and caused protests by the American Nurses Association. The series was canceled after only 13 episodes, as the show's sponsors withdrew their funding. The series was later rebooted as \"University Hospital\" (1995), but Field was not involved in the reboot.\n\nField's next regular television role was that of the reporter Cassy Swann in \"Capital News\" (1990). The series focused on the staff of the fictional newspaper Washington Capital (a fictionalized depiction of the Washington Post). The series only lasted for a single season and 12 episodes. The series was broadcast in its entirety in several European countries, but only 3 of its episodes were ever broadcast in the United States.\n\nField played the motorcycle cop Virginia Slim in the neo-Western film \"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\" (1991). The character was the ex-lover and main love interest for modern-day outlaw Robert Lee \"Marlboro Man\" Edison (played by Don Johnson).

Their attempt to profit from their discovery led to a violent conflict.\n\nField played Sarah Hallenbeck in the action comedy \"The Last Boy Scout\" (1991). The character was depicted as the unfaithful wife of private investigator Joseph Cornelius \"Joe\" Hallenbeck (played by Bruce Willis), though the couple reconciled by the end of the film. In the film, Joe finds himself suspected of involvement in the murders of both his own business partner and the female client which Joe was tasked with protecting. While trying to clear his name, Joe discovers that he is about to be framed for the assassination of a corrupt U.S. senator. The senator happens to be an old personal enemy of Joe, but Joe finds himself obligated to prevent the assassination.\n\nField played Wendy Robinson, the female lead in the horror film \"Dust Devil\" (1992). In the film, Wendy travels in the deserts of Namibia, trying to escape her angry husband. She picks up a mysterious hitchhiker, who turns out to be a shape-shifting wind demon who was fleeing from the local authorities. After traveling together for a while, the demon turns against Wendy and she kills him. By the end of the film, Wendy is suspected to be the demon's latest host body. The film was shot entirely on location in Namibia, and was based on South African folklore about the supposed supernatural powers of the serial killer Nhadiep.\n\nField played the detective sergeant Peckham in the psychological thriller \"Snapdragon\" (1993). In the film, Peckham is trying to solve two recent murders and to determine whether the amnesiac woman Felicity (played by Pamela Anderson) is connected to the case.

She starts an affair with the married rancher Eli Harrison (played by Brian Kerwin) , who was also her past lover. Snow's son starts an ill-advised romantic relationship with the promiscuous girl Brandi Dare (played by Marley Shelton ). The series only lasted for 6 episodes.\n\nField played Thalice Whitney in the comedy-drama film \"Andre\" (1994). The film centered on the Whitney family's struggle to protect their seal cub from local fishermen, while also dealing with the feelings of alienation of their adolescent daughter Paula Whitney (played by Aidan Pendleton). The film dramatized the early life of the famed harbor seal Andre the Seal (1961-1986), who had spend his entire life attached to human companions. The film cast a sea lion in the role of the seal.\n\nField played the role of the murder victim Karen Christianson in the thriller film \"Wicked\" (1998). In the film, Karen was trapped in an unhappy marriage with a workaholic, and had a difficult relationship with her adolescent daughter Ellie Christianson (played by Julia Stiles). During an intense argument over Ellie's excessive make-up, Ellie killed Karen in a fit of rage. Ellie proceeded to mostly replace Karen and to develop an unhealthy relationship with her own father. Ellie is eventually killed by her own sister Inger Christianson (played by Vanessa Zima) in a copycat murder. The implication being that both sisters had the same murderous tendencies.\n\nField was reduced to relatively minor supporting roles in the thriller film \"The Unsaid\" (2001) and the mystery film \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" (2005), which were her first film roles after several years. In 2009, Field married her long-time boyfriend Scott Bakula, a fellow actor. The couple had been romantically involved since 1994, and they had two children.\n\nBy the early 2020s, Field primarily worked in television roles. Her role in \"NCIS: New Orleans\" was her only recurring role in recent years. Field remains a well-known face to fans of horror and thriller films, but she has not had any leading roles in the last couple of decades.\n\nYoram Globus is an Israeli film producer, cinema owner and distributor who is most famous for his association with Cannon Films Inc., a company he ran with his cousin Menahem Golan.\n\nIn 1978, Globus and Golan moved to Hollywood and purchased the film production company Cannon (The Cannon Group) for $500,000. By the mid-80s Cannon had produced an average of 40 films a year and had become the largest independent production company in the world with a net worth of over 1 billion dollars. Because of their fast, low-budget style of filmmaking, they earned the nickname \"the Go-Go Boys.\" For years the name Golan-Globus symbolized Hollywood's last moguls and an inspiration corner stone to a new generation of film makers. In addition Golan and Globus opened the foreign market of the world film industry to the United States. Among the films produced by them are Bloodsport - Eine wahre Geschichte (1988) with Jean-Claude Van Damme, Superman IV - Die Welt am Abgrund (1987) with Christopher Reeve, King Lear (1987) directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Runaway Train (1985), Over the Top: Mein Daddy schlägt sie alle (1987) with Sylvester Stallone and Glitzernder Asphalt (1987) with Morgan Freeman. In addition, they acquired the rights to properties like \"Spider-Man\", Captain America (1990) and more.\n\nWith Cannon's success Golan and Globus expanded the group's operations and entered into additional areas. Cannon acquired approximately 1,600 cinemas in Europe and the United States (some of which were acquired in later years by Silvio Berlusconi, who later became prime minister of Italy) Studios, a, film library and additional acquisitions expanded the activities of the Cannon and established it as a leading conglomerate in the world film industry. During these years, Cannon sold their movies by a new strategy invented by Globus, the pre-sale strategy. Substantial pre-sales of the next years' films were made based on the strong salesmanship skills of Globus, and the advertising created by Design Projects. The deposits made from these sales financed production of the first film in the production line-up, which-when completed and delivered to theatre owners around the world-generated enough money to make the next film in the line-up. For this purposes Cannon used to create posters of movies, before they even had a script, and large billboards prominently displayed at the Cannes Film Festival each year.\n\nIn 1986, Cannon Films bought Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (see EMI Films) and the film library for £175,000,000, and Cannon sold its British Film Library Thorn-EMI Screen Entertainment Library which consisted of some 2,000 British films to Weintraub Entertainment Group in for approximately $85,000,000.\n\nIn 1989, 39.4% of the shares were acquired by the group Pathé Communications, a holding company controlled by Italian businessman Giancarlo Parretti in the amount of about $250 million. At the same year, Golan, citing differences with both Parretti and Globus, resigned from his position and left Cannon to start 21st Century Film Corporation, while Globus remained with Pathé. Globus and Paretti took over in 1990 through Pathé Communications for the American film company MGM and Yoram Globus became president of MGM.\n\nIn 1993, after he produced almost 300 films, Globus returned to Israel and has since focused on Israeli film and television production. His company GG Studios owns a large film and television studio in Neve Ilan, Israel where various Israeli broadcast stations, such as the Israeli News Company. Among its holdings of Israel Yoram Globus, of the Globus Group that includes a private arm Globus that owns the largest TV and film studio (Neveh Ilan) and is responsible for a significant part of film distribution industry (Noah CPP). In addition, Globus holds a public arm Globus Max that owns theaters in Israel. In 1999, Yoram Globus won other Ophir Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Israeli Academy of Film and Television.\n\nIn 2014 there were two documentary films released about the story of Golan & Globus in Cannon Films. Ratpac Entertainment released Electric Boogaloo - Die unglaublich wilde Geschichte der verrücktesten Filmfirma der Welt (2014) and The Go-Go Boys: The Inside Story of Cannon Films (2014), which was launched at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival."
