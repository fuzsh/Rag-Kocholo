        "text": "From the moment it burst onto television screens in 1964, Another World has won fans with storylines filled with passion, revenge, love, and betrayal. The show features many elaborate plot twists and each character had a role to play.\n\nAnother World' is filled with interesting characters, memorable heroes and unforgettable villains. They were played by members of the show's cast who embodied the spirit of their characters with skillful aplomb.\n\nFor example, Victoria Wyndham portrayed Rachel Cory Hutchins as she went through numerous twists and turns on the show. Constance Ford brought conviction to her portrayal of Ada Davis Hobson during her many appearances from 1967 until her passing in 1993. And let's not forget Hugh Marlowe as Jim Matthews - his commanding presence anchored numerous scenes between 1969 and 1980. These exceptional actors are just a few examples of Another Worldâ€™s excellent cast."
