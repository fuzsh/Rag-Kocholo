If they haven't been honored at all, now is the time to start the process that takes about two years. Anyway, some have been honored prior in recent years but still that doesn't mean that they can't get damehood. In fact on the honours list, the British dames are the smallest list in comparison to the male knights awarded in the list. \n\nWhile this list is long and varied by experiences, I think some of these ladies deserve damehood or something whether it's another honor such as an MBE, OBE, or CBE just something to honor and respect their contributions and services to the entertainment world. \n\nAnybody who declines a lesser honor isn't listed here since there are so many possible willing recipients. It's their loss in the first place.\n\nIf you would like to nominate any lady below or anybody else. Please visit https://www.gov.uk/honours",

        "text": "Rosemary Harris is an English actress. She has won 4 Drama Desk Awards, and nominated 9 times for Tony Awards. In 1966, she won the \"Tony Award for Best Actress\" for her role as Eleanor of Aquitaine in \"The Lion in Winter\". In films, she is better known for portraying May Reilly Parker in the \"Spider-Man\" film trilogy (2002-2007). Her character Aunt May is Spider-Man/Peter Parker's paternal aunt-in-law and surrogate mother.\n\nIn 1927, Harris was born in Ashby, Suffolk, a former civil parish in East Suffolk. Her parents were Stafford Berkeley Harris and his wife Enid Maude Frances Campion. Her father served in the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Harris family relocated to the locations of his military assignments. For some time, Stafford served in British India. So Harris spend part of her childhood there.\n\nHarris attended various convent schools. When she reached adulthood, she decided to follow an acting career. She made her theatrical debut in 1948, at Eastburn. She appeared for a few years in English repertory theatre, though she had no formal training as an actor. She joined Anthony Cundell's theatrical company, which was headquartered at Penzance, Cornwall.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1952, Harris received her formal acting education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). She made her debut in the New York stage in 1951, performing in \"Climate of Eden\" by Moss Hart (1904-1961). Shortly after, she made her West End debut in London. In 1954, Harris made her film debut in \"Beau Brummell\".\n\nFor several years, Harris appeared in classical theatre productions of the Bristol Old Vic, a British theatre company headquartered in Bristol, South West England. She later started performing for the Old Vic, the company's London-based parent company. In 1963, Harris performed at the opening production of the then-new National Theatre Company (later known as the Royal National Theatre), a theatrical company founded that year by Laurence Olivier (1907-1989). In that performance, Harris played Ophelia in \"Hamlet\" by William Shakespeare. Her co-star in the role of Hamlet was Peter O'Toole (1932-2013). The performance received positive reviews, with a theatre critic commenting that Harris was \"the most real and touching Ophelia\".\n\nFrom 1959 to 1967, Harris performed in Broadway for the Association of Producing Artist (APA). APA was a production company established by her then-husband Ellis Rabb (1930-1998), Her best known role in this period was playing the historical queen Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204) in \"Lion in Winter\", the role for which she won the 1966 Tony Award for Best Actress.\n\nIn 1967, Harris and Rabb received a divorce, and she consequently stopped performing for the APA. The company did not long survive Harris' departure, disbanding in 1969. Also in 1967, Harris was wed to her second husband, the fiction writer John Ehle (1925-2018). Ehle specialized in works set the Appalachian Mountains, and has been nicknamed \"the father of Appalachian literature\". They jointly raised a daughter, the actress Jennifer Ehle (1969-).\n\nHarris gained a high-profile television role in the 1970s, playing protagonist George Sand (1804-1876) in the BBC television serial \"Notorious Woman\" (1974). The series lasted for a single season and 7 episodes. The well-received series was broadcast in the United States from 1975 to 1976. For this role, Harris won the 1976 \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie\".\n\nIn 1978, Harris appeared in the role of Berta Palitz Weiss in the American television miniseries \"Holocaust\". Her character was the mother of a large Jewish family during the Holocaust. The miniseries was the first American television production focusing on the Holocaust, and was considered controversial for allegedly trivializing the historical tragedy. Harris' role was critically well-received, and she won the 1978 \"Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Harris' only major appearance in a television production was her role as Mrs Ramsay in the television film \"To the Lighthouse\". The film was an adaptation of a 1927 novel by Virginia Woolf (1882-1941), and focused on the life of the Ramsay family at their summer home on the Isle of Skye.\n\nIn the 1990s, Harris co-starred with her daughter Jennifer Ehle in the television series \"The Camomile Lawn\" (1992). Ehle played the young adult version of the character Calypso, while Harris played the elderly version of the character.\n\nIn 1994, Harris had a high-profile film role in the historical drama \"Tom & Viv\", which dramatized the problematic relationship between the poet Thomas Stearns \"T.S.\" Eliot (1888-1965) and his first wife Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot (1888-1947), Harris played the role of Vivienne's mother, Rose Robinson Haigh-Wood. For this role, Harris was nominated for the 1994 \"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress\". The Award was instead won by rival actress Dianne Wiest (1946-).\n\nLater, Harris again co-starred with Jennifer Ehle in the historical drama film \"Sunshine\" (1999). They played young and elderly versions of the character Valerie Sonnenschein. The film follows depicts the history of Hungary from the late 19th century to the 1950s, through the life experiences of a Hungarian Jewish family.\n\nHarris gained the high-profile role of May Reilly Parker in the comic book adaptation \"Spider-Man\" (2002). The film was a box office hit, earning about 822 million dollars at the worldwide box office. Harris was introduced to a much wider audience than before. She resumed her role in the sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007).\n\nHarris continued her theatrical career in the 2010s. Her last high-profile role in the decade was the role of Mrs. Higgins in a Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\". She appeared in the role from 2018 to 2019.\n\nIn 2021 was 93-years-old. She has never officially retired, though she no longer appears frequently in films. She has become one of the longest-lived actors of her era.\n\nThelma Barlow (née Pigott) is an English television actress and writer, most famous for her roles as Mavis Wilton in the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street and as Dolly Bellfield in the sitcom Dinnerladies.\n\nThelma Barlow was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, the younger of two daughters. Her father, Tommy, a cabinet maker, died of pneumonia five weeks before her birth, and Barlow was brought up by her mother Margaret. During her childhood the family moved to Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Barlow left school at 15 and went to Huddersfield Technical College to study shorthand and typing. Her first job was as a secretary, which she held for eight years and at the same time belonged to an amateur dramatics group. Barlow decided to take up acting professionally and joined the Joan Littlewood Theatre Group. During the 1950s she did rep in Liverpool, Nottingham and Birmingham. In 1960 Barlow joined the West of England Theatre Company followed by the Bristol Old Vic Theatre Company. In Bristol she ran a boarding house for fellow actors. In 1956 she married set designer Graham Barlow; they subsequently had two children, Clive and James. They divorced in 1983.\n\nThelma Barlow's first television appearance was in 1970's A Stranger on the Hill. The following year while performing in Liverpool she was asked to audition for the soap opera Coronation Street for the role of Mavis Riley. She was successful and her first episode was transmitted on 14 August 1971, though the character appeared regularly only from 1973, when she joined the staff of \"The Kabin\". Barlow remained in the series for 26 years, appearing in nearly 2,000 episodes, until she left after the departure of her on-screen husband Derek. Her final episode was broadcast 10 October 1997 when Mavis moved to the Lake District. During her time on Coronation Street Barlow shared a flat with co-star Helen Worth and later moved to Settle, where she later did a TV show from her garden.\n\nBarlow's next major role was that of Dolly Bellfield in Victoria Wood's sitcom Dinnerladies, which ran for two series from 1998 to 2000.\n\nSince her departure from Coronation Street Barlow has also made stage appearances.\n\nIn June 2014, Barlow narrated 30-minute documentary \"Gail & Me: 40 Years on Coronation Street\" which celebrated Helen Worth's career on Coronation Street as Gail Platt.\n\nAge has not taken the flower off this Bloom. The well-known and highly respected stage, screen and television actress Claire Bloom continues to be in demand as an octogenarian actress and looks as beautiful as ever.\n\nShe was born Patricia Claire Blume on February 15, 1931, in Finchley, North London, to Elizabeth (Grew) and Edward Max Blume, who worked in sales. Her parents were from Jewish families from Belarus. Educated at Badminton School in Bristol and Fern Hill Manor in New Milton, Claire expressed early interest in the arts and was stage trained as an adolescent at the Guildhall School, under the guidance of Eileen Thorndike, and then at the Central School of Speech and Drama.\n\nMarking her professional debut on BBC radio, she subsequently took her first curtain call with the Oxford Repertory Theatre in 1946 in the production of \"It Depends What You Mean\". She then received early critical accolades for her Shakespearean ingénues in \"King John\", \"The Winter's Tale\" and, notably, her Ophelia in \"Hamlet\" at age 17 at Stratford-on-Avon opposite alternating Hamlets Paul Scofield and Robert Helpmann. By 1949 Claire was making her West End debut with \"The Lady's Not For Burning\" with the up-and-coming stage actor Richard Burton.\n\nA most becoming and beguiling dark-haired actress whose photogenic, slightly pinched beauty was accented by an effortless elegance and poise, Claire's inauspicious film debut came with a prime role in the British courtroom film drama The Blind Goddess (1948). It was her second film, when Charles Chaplin himself selected her specifically to be his young leading lady in the classic sentimental drama Rampenlicht (1952), that propelled her to stardom. Her bravura turn as a young suicide-bent ballerina saved from despair by an aging music hall clown (Chaplin) was exquisitely touching and sparked an enviable but surprisingly sporadic career in films.\n\nDespite the sudden film attention, Claire continued her formidable presence on the Shakespearean stage. Joining the Old Vic Company for the 1952-53 and 1953-54 seasons, she appeared as Helena, Viola, Juliet, Jessica, Miranda, Virgilia, Cordelia and (again) Ophelia in a highly successful tenure. Touring Canada and the United States as Juliet, she made her Broadway bow in the star-crossed-lover role in 1956, also playing the Queen in \"Richard II\". A strong presence on both the London and New York stages over the years, she gave other powerful performances with \"The Trojan Women\", \"Vivat! Vivat! Regina!\", \"Hedda Gabler\", \"A Doll's House\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". Much later in life she performed in a superb one-woman show entitled \"These Are Women: A Portrait of Shakespeare's Heroines\" that included monologues from several of her acclaimed stage performances.\n\nClaire's stylish and regal presence was simply ideal for mature period films, and she appeared opposite a roster of Hollywood's most talented leading men, including Laurence Olivier in the title role of Richard III. (1955), Richard Burton and Fredric March in Alexander der Große (1956), Yul Brynner in Die Brüder Karamasow (1958), and Brynner and Charlton Heston in the DeMille epic König der Freibeuter (1958), in which she had a rare dressed-down role as a spirited pirate girl. On the more contemporary scene, she appeared with Burton in two classic film dramas: the stark \"kitchen sink\" British stage piece Blick zurück im Zorn (1959) and the Cold War espionage thriller Der Spion, der aus der Kälte kam (1965). In addition she courted tinges of controversy, playing a housewife gone bonkers in the offbeat sudser Der Chapman-Report (1962) and a lesbian in the supernatural chiller Bis das Blut gefriert (1963).\n\nClaire met first husband Rod Steiger while performing with him on stage in 1959's \"Rashomon\". They married that year and in 1960 had a daughter, Anna, who grew up to become a well-regarded opera singer. Claire and Rod appeared in two lesser films together, Der Tätowierte (1969) and 2 durch 3 geht nicht (1969), in 1969. That same year, they divorced after 10 tumultuous years.\n\nAs with other maturing actresses during the 1970s, Claire looked toward classy film roles in TV movies for sustenance, appearing in Weißes Haus, Hintereingang (1979) as First Lady Edith Wilson and in Wiedersehen mit Brideshead (1981), for which she was nominated for an Emmy. Also lauded were the epic miniseries Die Straßen von Ellis Island (1984); a remake of Terence Rattigan's Getrennte Tische (1983); The Ghost Writer (1984), an acclaimed adaption of Philip Roth's novel ; and Shadowlands (1986), the latter earning her a British Television Award. Claire married Roth the writer (her third marriage) in 1990 after a brief second marriage to producer Hillard Elkins (1969-1972). The union with Roth lasted five years.\n\nClaire appeared in several Shakespearean teleplays over the decades while also portraying a choice selection of historical royals, including Czarina Alexandra and Katherine of Aragon. On daytime drama, she delightfully played matriarch and murderess Orlena Grimaldi on the daytime drama Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) starting in 1993. She left the role in 1995 and was replaced.\n\nContinuing sporadically in films from the 1970s on, Claire graced such films as the stylish British social comedy Traue keinem Hausfreund (1971), the tender coming-of-age drama Red Sky at Morning (1971) as Richard Thomas's mother, and one of that year's versions of Ibsen's Ein Puppenheim (1973) (Jane Fonda starred as Nora in the other). She also movingly played George C. Scott's estranged wife in Inseln im Strom (1977) and had a very brief cameo as Hera in Kampf der Titanen (1981), a small part as a manipulative mother in Déjà Vu (1985), and mature parts in the romantic dramedy Sammy und Rosie tun es (1987) and classic Woody Allen drama Verbrechen und andere Kleinigkeiten (1989).\n\nIn the new millennium, Claire has been seen in such quality films as and The Book of Eve (2002), Imagining Argentina (2003), The King's Speech - Die Rede des Königs (2010) (as Queen Mary), And While We Were Here (2012), Max Rose (2013) starring a dramatic Jerry Lewis, and Miss Dalí (2018). She has also made appearances on such TV miniseries as Die 10 Gebote (2005) and Summer of Rockets (2019).\n\nClaire wrote two memoirs. The first was the more career-oriented \"Limelight and After: The Education of an Actress,\" released in 1982. Her more controversial second book, \"Leaving a Doll's House: A Memoir,\" published in 1996, focused on her personal life.\n\nIncisive, classically-trained English stage and screen actress, latterly often seen on TV as imperious titled ladies or dowagers. She was born Caroline Georgiana Blakiston in Chelsea, London, the daughter of archivist Hugh Noel Blakiston (1905-1984) and non-fiction author Rachel Georgiana Russell (1903-1995). A RADA graduate of 1957, Blakiston began her theatrical career that very same year at the Bristol Old Vic in the play Girls of Summer, written by N. Richard Nash. She appeared on diverse stages throughout England until joining the ensemble of the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-Upon-Avon between 1993 and 1997. From July 2001 to August 2003, Blakiston enjoyed a lengthy run as Mrs. Higgins in My Fair Lady at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane.\n\nOn screen from 1962, Blakiston has appeared mainly on television, a notable exception being her role as Rebel Alliance leader Mon Mothma in Star Wars: Episode VI - Die Rückkehr der Jedi-Ritter (1983). During the 60s, she was often featured in guest spots for ITC productions like Simon Templar (1962), Der Baron (1966), Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone (1961) and Department S (1969). Equally frequent were her forays into period drama. Those have included a much-lauded performance as Marjorie Ferrar in the 1967 BBC adaptation of Die Forsyte Saga (1967), as well portrayals of Agrippina in The Caesars (1968), Lady Paulton in Raffles (1975), Frances Villiers, the Countess of Jersey, a mistress of the Der Prinzregent (1979) and governess Anna Brigmore in The Mallens (1979). More recently, she has been memorable as the acerbic, tough-as-nails Aunt Agatha in seasons 1-4 of Poldark (2015).\n\nBlakiston also had a leading role in the cast of Rides (1992), a BBC drama series about an all-female crew of taxi drivers, produced by the Ealing-based production company Warner Sisters. In the compelling drama series Mr. Palfrey of Westminster (1984) she portrayed a British spy chief, known only as the 'Coordinator'. On the comedic side of life, Blakiston has co-starred opposite Timothy West as the alcoholic, aristocratic Lady Patience Hardacre in Granada's socio-economic satire Brass (1983) and as Alice Bannister in the marital sitcom The Last Song (1981). She also popped up in an episode of As Time Goes By (1992) as Margaret, the ex-wife of Lionel Hardcastle (Geoffrey Palmer).\n\nBlakiston was at one time married to Scottish actor Russell Hunter with whom she had appeared on the stage in A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\nCrosbie was born in Gorebridge, Midlothian, Scotland, to Presbyterian parents who disapproved of her becoming an actress. Nevertheless, she joined the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School while still in her teens. Her big break came in 1970 when she was cast as Catherine of Aragon in the BBC television series The Six Wives of Henry VIII, for which she won the 1971 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress. In 1973, she starred alongside Vanessa Redgrave in the BBC serial, A Picture of Katherine Mansfield.\n\nIn 1975, Crosbie made a similar impact as another Queen, Queen Victoria, in the ITV period drama Edward the Seventh, for which she won the 1976 BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress. She played Cinderella's fairy godmother in The Slipper and the Rose, which was chosen as the Royal Film Première for 1976. In that film, Crosbie sang the Sherman Brothers' song, \"Suddenly It Happens\". In Ralph Bakshi's animated movie, The Lord of the Rings, filmed in 1978, Crosbie voiced the character of Galadriel, Lady of the Elves. In 1980, she played the abbess in Hawk the Slayer. In 1986, she appeared as the vicar's wife in Paradise Postponed.\n\nAfter appearing in the BBC1 drama Take Me Home, Crosbie's next major role was as Margaret Meldrew, the long-suffering wife of Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) in the BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave (1990-2000) for which she is best known. She also played Janet, the housekeeper to Dr. Finlay, in the 1993 revival of A.J. Cronin's popular stories. She also had a poignant role in the thriller The Debt Collector (1999).\n\nCrosbie's other roles include playing the monkey-lover Ingrid Strange in an episode of Jonathan Creek (1997), Edith Sparshott in An Unsuitable Job for a Woman (1997-2001), and Jessie in the film Calendar Girls (2003). In 2004, Crosbie appeared alongside Sam Kelly in an episode of the third series of Black Books, as the mother of the character Manny Bianco. In the series six and seven of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series Old Harry's Game, she played a recently deceased historian named Edith.\n\nIn 2008 she appeared in the BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit and an AXA Sun Life television advertisement for the over-50s.

Since 2003, she has been President of the League Against Cruel Sports. She has also fronted commercials for Sun Life Direct insurance.\n\nHailing from an English theatrical family, Christina Pickles is a beloved stage-trained actress who has enjoyed a rich and varied career that has allowed her to show her incredible range and great depth of character in her performances. She sets the bar for all at an entirely new height with this year's \"Outstanding Actress, Short Form, Comedy or Drama, Short Form\" for her critically lauded performance in \"Break a Hip\" earning a remarkable seventh Emmy nomination for a superior performance. Earlier, Christina earned an Emmy nod for her hilarious role on \"Friends\" as 'Ross' and 'Monica Geller's' mom adding to five nominations for her historic role on precedent-setting \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nProbably best known for her portrayal of \"Nurse Helen Rosenthal\" on the NBC hit hospital drama \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Judy Geller,\" the dysfunctional mother of Monica (Courtney Cox) and Ross (David Schwimmer), on the NBC smash comedy hit \"Friends,\" Christina was Emmy-nominated five times for \"St. Elsewhere\" and once for her indelible role on \"Friends.\"\n\nChristina just added her seventh Emmy nomination this summer for her hilarious and touching performance as \"Biz\" in the short-form comedy series \"Break A Hip.\" Guest stars and riveting performances surround her indelible character including those from Oscar winners Allison Janey, Octavia Spencer and Jim Rash as well as a laugh-out-loud turn from Peri Giipin. It was Christina five years ago that learned about the infectious storyline of \"Break A Hip\" and its protagonist, 'Biz,' insisting producer/director Cameron Watson turn this into the Short Form hit series you see today. It's the best in its space at a time when all of us are living longer and know a 'Biz' in our lives.\n\nChristina trained at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London before moving to New York where she was a member of The APA Repertory Company and enjoyed a luminous career starring on and Off-Broadway. After moving to Los Angeles for \"St. Elsewhere,\" she worked consistently in film and television establishing herself as a versatile actress able to perform both comedy and drama deftly. Film credits include \"The Wedding Singer,\" Baz Luhrmann's \"Romeo + Juliet,\" \"Grace of My Heart,\" and \"Legends of the Fall.\" As a voice-over artist, Christina can be heard in classic episodes of \"The Family Guy\" and as the spokesperson for Pavilions supermarket.\n\nThis feisty and very funny British comedienne and musical revue vet with the trademark 60s brunet page-boy haircut, pronounced jaw, and arguably the largest, Bette Davis-like eyes in London was born Shirley Anne Broadbent in Ashton-under-Lyne, Cheshire on September 14, 1935. The daughter of Hubert Howath Broadbent, an accountant, and wife Connie (Pyke) Broadbent, who greatly prodded her young daughter into becoming a performer, Amanda was named after the Depression-era child star Shirley Temple. Her grandfather was a theatre owner in Ashton-under-Lyne, and young Shirley made her very first appearance there at the age of 3 as a Christmas Tree Fairy.\n\nNot long after this she began training earnestly in singing and in dance, particularly ballet. As a youngster she won a talent-judging contest singing \"I'm Just a Little Girl Who's Looking for a Little Boy\". She then went on to attend school at St. Anne's College in St. Anne's-on-Sea and later studied acting at the Cone-Ripman School.\n\nAfter her parents' divorce, the teenager ran away from home and off to London where she lived at the Theatre Girls Club and subsequently found work as a chorus girl. By 1958 she had changed her marquee name to \"Amanda Barrie\" and made her TV debut with the comedy team of Morecambe and Wise in which her skirt accidentally fell off on live TV. She then took her first West End curtain call in a 1961 production of \"Babes in the Wood\". Eventually Amanada decided to set her sights beyond a dancing career, and moved more into musical revue work in the hopes for good comedy parts. Finding work as a dancer in cabaret shows and the revue \"On the Brighter Side\", she also trained at the Bristol Old Vic but did not perform in repertory.\n\nThroughout the 1960s Amanda focused on her musical talents in the West End, and sparkled in a number of comedy shows. In the early part of the decade she hit solid notices with the revues \"Six of One\" (1963) with Dora Bryan and \"See You Inside (1963)\". Other stage work (which included occasional drama) came in the form of \"Cabaret\" (as Sally Bowles), \"Private Lives\", \"Hobson's Choice, \"Any Wednesday\", \"A Public Mischief\", \"She Loves Me\" (replacing Rita Moreno in London), and \"Little by Little\". She also worked as the TV hostess on \"Double Your Money\" with Hughie Green and appeared in a number of comedy films: Immer Ärger mit den Ladies (1959), her debut in an unbilled bit, Das letzte Wort hat sie (1962), Doktor in Nöten (1963)and I've Gotta Horse (1965). She appeared to very good advantage in two of the slapstick \"Carry On...\" film series. She played a female cabbie in the Der Krach kommt doch (1963) and Cleopatra herself (with a sexy lisp) in Cleo, Liebe und Antike (1964).\n\nAfter her film peak Amanda continued to show resiliency on stage and TV. Theatre endeavors included \"Absurd Person Singular\", the musical \"Stepping Out\" with Julia McKenzie, \"The Mating Game\", \"Blithe Spirit (as Elvira) and \"Twelfth Night\". Occasional movie work came in, including the addled comedy Wer hat unseren Dinosaurier geklaut? (1975) with Helen Hayes. Of the countless sitcoms Amanda has been involved in, she became a soap opera favorite beginning in 1981 with her participation as Alma Sedgewick in Coronation Street (1960). Her appearances were infrequent until the character became a regular in 1989. She retired the role after 11 years in 2001 in an effort to spread her wings once again and seek other work. The producers actually killed off her popular character in quick fashion with a rapid case of cervical cancer.\n\nIn 1967 Amanda married actor and theatre director Robin Hunter and the twosome appeared occasionally on stage together, including the pantomime \"Aladdin\" in late 1967 and 1968 in which Amanda had the title role. The couple separated in the 1980s, however, but remained good friends and never divorced. Hunter died in 2004. In 1997 Amanda battled a serious optic disease in which she eventually lost the sight of her left eye. She has continued to perform, however, and more recent work has included the pantomimes \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" (2006) and \"Cinderella\" (2007), in which she played the Fairy Godmother. In her popular and highly candid autobiography \"It's Not a Rehearsal,\" a best seller published in 2003, Amanda opened up for the first time about her bisexuality.\n\nOf regal bearing and imposing stance, flame-haired British classical actress Judy Parfitt is the possessor of the chilliest blue orbs in all of London and has used them to her advantage over the years with her clever portrayals of haughty, bossy, imperious, deliciously malevolent patricians. Born Judy Catherine Claire Parfitt on November 7, 1935, in South Yorkshire, England, she was educated at Notre Dame High School for Girls before enrolling for acting training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA)\n\nShe made her stage debut with \"Fools Rush In\" in 1954, and continued to impress with such pieces as \"Things Remembered\" (1955) and \"A Likely Talk\" (London debut, 1956). She moved to TV and in the early 1960s was spotted in a number of TV guest appearances on such BBC programs as \"The Plane Makers,\" \"The Odd Man,\" \"Queen and the Rebels,\" \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook,\" \"Public Eye,\" \"Front Page Story,\" \"Undermind,\" \"Londoners,\" \"Z Cars,\" \"The Saint,\" \"Emergency-Ward 10,\" \"The Avengers\" and played the embittered Rosa Dartle in the David Copperfield (1966) TV series. Judy also was a regular on the crime series A Man Called Harry Brent (1965) and portrayed Madame Thenardier in the mini-series Les Misérables (1967).\n\nShe drew acclaim on the stage with such roles as \"The Daughter-in-Law\" at the Royal Court, \"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd (title role) (1967), \"The Hotel in Amsterdam\" (1968), and her portrayal of Gertrude in \"Hamlet\" in 1969. A year later she recreated the Shakespearean role in the lauded film version of Hamlet (1969) directed by Nick Richardson starring Nicol Williamson in the title role, Anthony Hopkins as Claudius and pop singer Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia. Judy continued to impress on the stage with \"The Double Dealer\" (1969), the title role in \"The Duchess of Malfi\" (1971), \"Vivat! Vivat Regina! (as Mary, Queen of Scots) (1971), \"The Apple Cart\" (1973), \"Echoes from a Concrete Canyon\" (1975), \"The Family Dance\" (1976) and \"The Cherry Orchard\" (1978).\n\nIn later years the veteran actress appeared on stage in a production of \"An Inspector Calls\" (1993) and made her Broadway debut co-starring with Matthew Broderick in the revival of \"Night Must Fall\" (1999). Sporadic film credits would include featured roles in Das zweite Leben des Mr. Soames (1970) starring Terence Stamp as a man who awakens from a 30-year coma; the biopic Galileo (1975) starring Topol; a doctor in a biopic about steeple chase jockey and cancer patient Bob Champion entitled Sein größter Sieg (1984); the social comedy Ein Umzug kommt selten allein (1984) the gay romantic drama Maurice (1987); the romantic comedy Das verflixte erste Mal (1989); the psychological thriller Death and Desire (1989); as Queen Katherine in the John Goodman comedy vehicle King Ralph (1991); and the war drama Silent Cries (1993).\n\nOutside of Gertrude in \"Hamlet,\" Judy earned her finest role on film with the gloomy-styled thriller Dolores (1995), nearly stealing the thunder from stars Kathy Bates and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Bates' wealthy, dictatorial employer. Her clever and utterly gripping performance was surprisingly overlooked come Oscar time. Elsewhere, she was lauded for her sterling work in several TV mini-series, including her Madame Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities (1980); her Lady Catherine in Stolz und Vorurteil (1980); her Mildred Layton Das Juwel der Krone (1984), for which she earned a BAFTA nomination; her Hilda Spearpoint in Der große Reibach (1990); her Martha in Der Fluch der Edelsteine (1993) her Mercy Woolf in Funland (2005); her Mrs. Clennam in Klein Dorrit (2008); her Hester Waterhouse in The Game (2014). In America she was a recurring presence for a time on the medical series Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994). Other popular films she has graced are Oscar Wilde (1997), Auf immer und ewig (1998) (as Queen Marie), and Das Mädchen mit dem Perlenohrring (2003), for which she earned a BAFTA nomination,\n\nJudy was long married to actor Tony Steedman, who made a guest appearance as Santa Claus on her short-lived '80s sitcom The Charmings (1987) in which she played the Queen. He died in February of 2001. Since then she has ventured on, an always fascinating character presence especially in elegant and period settings. She has recently been seen in a regular role as Sister Monica Joan in the historical TV series drama Call the Midwife - Ruf des Lebens (2012).\n\nSusan Hampshire, the English actress who has won three Emmy Awards, was born in Kensington, London on May 12, 1937. Her original ambition was to be a nurse, but she could not pass her O-Level exam in Latin. (She found out when she was 30 years old that she was dyslexic, and her work on dyslexia subsequently brought her the Officer of the British Empire award.) She decided to become an actress and gained training in the theater. She made her movie debut, at 10 years old, in Die Schwindlerin (1947) but her proper debut was in the Laurence Harvey picture, Expresso Bongo (1959), in 1958. Her career has never faltered.\n\nHampshire made a name for herself in her native Britain, appearing in Katy (1962) on TV in 1962 for the BBC. Walt Disney signed her to star in the 1964 family picture, Die drei Leben des Thomasina (1963), but it was her role in the 1967 BBC mini-series, Die Forsyte Saga (1967), that made her famous and won her the first of her three Emmy Awards. Shown in the United States on the precursor to PBS, the great popularity of the series led the new PBS to create Masterpiece Theatre (1971). The First Churchills (1969), in which Hampshire played \"Sarah Churchill\", was the first series offered on \"Masterpiece Theater\" and brought her her second Emmy. In 1973, she won her third, playing \"Becky Sharp\" in Vanity Fair (1967), for a mini-series that had been released in the UK in 1967.\n\nSusan Hampshire has continued to be active on television and in the theater. She has been married to her second husband, the theatrical impresario, Sir Eddie Kulukundis, since 1981."
