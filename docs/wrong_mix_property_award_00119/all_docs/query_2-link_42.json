When he passed away in 1896, he dedicated his will to award those who have been outstanding figures in these fields. As a result, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation was established and became the organization responsible for awarding the Nobel Prizes.\n\nAccording to Alfred Nobel’s will, the Nobel Peace Prize shall be awarded to those who have “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\"\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is an international award that is awarded every year by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The prize ceremony takes place annually on December 10, the date on which Alfred Nobel passed away. The prize usually includes a medal, personal diploma, and award money.\n\nWhich Presidents and Vice Presidents have won a Nobel Prize?\n\nOur story starts in 1906 when Theodore Roosevelt became the first President to win a Nobel Peace Prize. Since then, three other Presidents and one Vice President have received the honor.\n\nBelow is a list of recipients from the White House:\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson in 1920, for his efforts in ending the First World War and help in creating the League of Nations.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter in 2002, for his efforts in finding “peaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, and promoting economic and social development.”\n\nVice President Al Gore in 2007, for his efforts to obtain and spread knowledge about climate change.\n\nPresident Barack Obama in 2009, for his efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation.\n\nWhen President Obama accepted the prestigious award in 2009, he humbly highlighted his surprise in receiving the honor:\n\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize -- Schweitzer and King; Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight.\n\nPresident Obama also donated a large sum of the money awarded to him with the Nobel Peace Prize. Find out more about the charities that the President donated to.\n\nIf you’re curious, here are a few more fun facts:\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt’s Nobel Peace Prize currently hangs in the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing. The Roosevelt Room was also President Theodore Roosevelt’s office when the West Wing was built in 1902. Take a look inside the room here.\n\nWhen President Obama received the news that he won the Nobel Peace Prize he stated, “after I received the news, Malia walked in and said, 'Daddy, you won the Nobel Peace Prize, and it is Bo's birthday!’ and then Sasha added, ‘plus, we have a three-day weekend coming up.’” Find out more about the morning the President won the Nobel Peace Prize here .\n\nDuring the Second World War (1939-1943), no Nobel Prizes were awarded.\n\nInformation and photos used in this post are courtesy of the Library of Congress and Norwegian Nobel Institute."
