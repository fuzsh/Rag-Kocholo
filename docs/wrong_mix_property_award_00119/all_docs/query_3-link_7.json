        "text": "Camilo José Cela, who has died in hospital of heart disease aged 85, was one of five Spanish writers to win the Nobel prize for literature, but the only novelist. He published about 70 books in all: poetry, stories, articles and travel books, as well as 12 full-length novels.\n\nHe was born in Iria Flavia, Galicia, the oldest of nine children of an upper middle-class family: \"My childhood was so happy it was hard to grow up,\" he once said. His mother was English, and his father a part-time writer and avid reader.\n\nCela spent a year of his adolescence in a TB sanatorium, experience used in his second novel, Pabellón de Reposo (Convalescence Wing, 1944). His law studies in Madrid University were interrupted, in 1936, by the outbreak of the civil war. Fighting as a corporal on Franco's side, he was seriously wounded, and became a censor. After the war, he continued his law studies and two other degree courses, but completed none - a sign of his uncommon energy and multiple interests.\n\nHis life changed with the publication of The Life Of Pascual Duarte (1942). This harsh, realistic novel of a brutish peasant awaiting execution fell like a bomb onto cowed, post-civil war Spain. Cela's framing of Pascual's story as a morality tale - warning the public against bad conduct - deceived few, as, clearly, the illiterate murderer was a victim of backwardness and poverty. Cela probably only escaped imprisonment through his close association with the Falange. So successful was Pascual Duarte that its fourth edition was banned - a true case of the censor censored.\n\nCela's famous account of a journey on foot round a remote valley in Guadalajara province, The Voyage To The Alcarria (1948), set a trend for travel writing, a relatively safe genre under a dictatorship. For Cela, despite the poverty and melancholy he found on his walk, the country brought out a more lyrical vein and a kindlier tone.\n\nNormally in Cela's books, women deceive, men are pigs, everyone lies and poses. This was the bitter, scathing flavour of his most famous novel, La colmena (The Hive), which took him five years to write, was banned in Spain, and published first in Buenos Aires in 1951. It describes three freezing winter days in 1943 Madrid - in a revolutionary style of hundreds of short cinematic scenes and more than 200 characters. It produced numerous imitators, contributing to what became known as the school of Madrid realist writers. \"La colmena,\" wrote Cela, \"is just a slice of life, a pale reflection of daily, bitter, loveable, painful reality. Those who want to disguise life with the mad mask of literature are liars.\"\n\nHis fame rests on these early books, and San Camilo 1936, published in 1969. San Camilo uses baroque language and complex syntax in a violent, near-pornographic, monologue set at the outbreak of the civil war. Always an experimental writer, Cela's later books became increasingly obscure, with unpunctuated stories, a non-temporal anti-novel with no plot or character development, and multiple unreliable narrators. \"What's the point of repeating what has already been done?\" he replied when challenged.\n\nIn 1954, he left Madrid to settle in Mallorca, where he founded a literary magazine, Papeles de Son Armadans, which ran from 1956 to 1979, and, by featuring exiled writers, became a focus for internal political opposition. In 1991, he set up, in Iria Flavia, his foundation, one of the best-endowed writers' museums in the world. Here, all his manuscripts, editions and notes - even his Alcarria rucksack - are stored.\n\nCela's later career was full of honours. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1957 (he was the oldest member at his death), appointed a Spanish senator from 1977-79, awarded the national literature prize in 1984 (for Mazurka For Two Dead Men), the Prince of Asturias prize in 1987 (for his life's work), the Planeta prize in 1994, and the Nobel prize for literature in 1989. He was ennobled, in 1996, as Marquis of Iria Flavia.\n\nAsked what he wanted on his epitaph, in characteristic provocation, he replied: \"Here lies a man who fucked up his fellow-men as little as possible.\" Many of his victims might disagree, for Cela was renowned for his quarrels. Not for nothing did he write A Secret Dictionary (1972) of taboo words and phrases, for he used crude language freely in the vigorous, and frequent, public rows (even with his son) he enjoyed. There was a scornful side to these attacks, and a vein of sexism and homophobia.\n\nAfter the Nobel, Cela became a celebrity. He enjoyed touring Spain in his Rolls Royce, appearing with his young, second wife at fashionable restaurants and reminiscing about Pío Baroja, whose pallbearer he had been, or Ernest Hemingway, with whom he attended bullfights.\n\nHis Rolls, rows and outrageous remarks were part of a public persona. In private, he was, above all, a novelist, working with pencil and paper every morning at his desk. Last Monday, he was writing, before entering hospital in the afternoon. The most famous Spanish novelist of the second part of the 20th century, he wrote in a Spanish realist tradition, which dates back to the picaresque 17th-century novels of hunger, revived in modern times by Galdós and Cela's master Baroja.\n\nUpdating this tradition, Cela found a way of describing the war and dictatorship of his own epoch. His low view of humanity, told often with phantasmagoric language, brings to mind another dissident rightwinger, Céline.\n\nCela was married twice: first, in 1944, to Rosario Conde; then, in 1991, to Marina Castaño. She survives him, as does his son by his first wife."
