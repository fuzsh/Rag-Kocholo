        "text": "Spanish names that start with ‘C’\n\nSpanish is a language that doesn’t use the letter ‘K’ very often, which might explain why there are plenty of Spanish names that begin with the letter ‘C.’\n\nFor example, the name Christopher begins with a ‘K’ in its Polish version (Krzysztof), but its Spanish version (Cristóbal) starts with a ‘C.’\n\nAnother example is the Spanish name Carlos and its German equivalent Karl.\n\nSpanish girl names that start with ‘C’\n\nCristina\n\nCarmen\n\nCruz\n\nCelia\n\nCarla\n\nCecilia\n\nConcha\n\nConcepción\n\nConsuelo\n\nClaudia\n\nCatalina\n\nCamila\n\nClara\n\nCarolina\n\nConchita\n\nCarlota\n\nCandelaria\n\nCarmela\n\nCovadonga\n\nCandela\n\nCarmelita\n\nConchi\n\nCarmina\n\nCayetana\n\nCelestina\n\nCelina\n\nCaridad\n\nCharo\n\nConsolación\n\nClarisa\n\nCarmencita\n\nCándida\n\nCarina\n\nClemencia\n\nCarmiña\n\nConcepción and related names\n\nConcepción is a Spanish female name with a religious connection because it is a shortened form of “María de la Inmaculada Concepción.”\n\nConcha is a name that serves as a diminutive of the name Concepción. It also matches the Spanish word “concha,” which means “seashell.”\n\nOther diminutives of the name Concepción include Conchi and Conchita.\n\nCarla, Carlota, and Carolina\n\nAmong Spanish girl names that begin with ‘C,’ there is a group that originates from the Germanic male name Karl (also related to the English names Charles and Carol). This group includes Spanish names like Carla, Carlota, and Carolina.\n\nWhile the letter ‘K’ is widely used in Germanic languages, it is much less common in Latin and Spanish. So, as these names evolved from the Germanic languages into Spanish (often via Latin), the initial letter ‘K’ was replaced by a ‘C’.\n\nThe first name in this group is Carla. It is the female version of the Spanish male name Carlos (which corresponds to the English name Charles).\n\nCarlota is the Spanish equivalent of Charlotte (a French feminine variant of the name Charles). Note that the Spanish version (Carlota) has a single ‘t’ whereas the Italian version (Carlotta) has two.\n\nCarolina, the third name in this group, is the Spanish version of Caroline.\n\nIt is interesting to notice that the U.S. state of North Carolina matches the Spanish name Carolina rather than its French equivalent, Caroline. But, that state’s largest city, Charlotte, matches the French version of the Spanish name Carlota.\n\nCándida and Candela\n\nCándida and Candela are Spanish girl names related to a Latin verb that means “to shine” or “to glow.” (that Latin verb is “candeō”)\n\nCandela is a name that matches the Spanish word “candela,” which means “candle.” Candelaria is a related name.\n\nCándida is a Spanish name that comes from the Latin word “candidus” which means “clear” and “bright.” That same Latin root is also the origin of the English adjective “candid,” which means sincere and free from prejudice.\n\nCarmen and related names\n\nThe name Carmen comes from “María del Carmen,” a reference to Mount Carmel in the Middle East. The name also coincides with the Latin word “carmen,” which means “song.”\n\nCarmela, Carmencita and Carmiña are diminutives of Carmen.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nThe name Consuelo comes from “María del Consuelo” (the Spanish word “consuelo” means “solace”) and the name Consolación comes from “María de la Consolación” (the Spanish word “consolación” means “consolation”).\n\nIn Spanish, Cruz is both a last name and a first name (for women and men). The Spanish word “cruz” refers to “a cross.”\n\nCaridad is a name related to the Spanish word “caridad,” which means “charity.” Both originate from the Latin word “caritas,” which has several meanings, including “charity” and “love.”\n\nThe name Clemencia matches the Spanish word “clemencia,” which means “mercy”. Both come from the Latin term “clementia” (spelled with a ‘t’), which can mean “gentleness” as well as “mercy”.\n\nIt may not be immediately obvious that Catalina is the Spanish version of the English name Catherine. But it is.\n\nCelia is a name related to the Latin word “caelum,” which means “sky” or “heaven.”\n\nClara comes from the Latin word “clarus,” which can mean clear, bright, or famous.\n\nCharo diminutive of Rosario.\n\nSpanish boy names that start with ‘C’\n\nCarlos\n\nCristian\n\nCristóbal\n\nCristián\n\nCésar\n\nCamilo\n\nCarmelo\n\nCecilio\n\nClaudio\n\nCruz\n\nCiro\n\nCarlito\n\nClemente\n\nCuauhtémoc\n\nConrado\n\nChema\n\nCayetano\n\nCirilo\n\nCándido\n\nChucho\n\nConstantino\n\nCurro\n\nCipriano\n\nCasimiro\n\nCristhian\n\nCalixto\n\nCustodio\n\nChente\n\nCornelio\n\nCiriaco\n\nCesario\n\nCrisanto\n\nNotes:\n\nCiro is the Spanish form of Cyrus, a name that originates from Ancient Persia.\n\nCuauhtémoc is a name from Nahuatl, a language native to Mexico. There was an Aztec ruler with this name.\n\nSeveral Spanish names that start with ‘C’ are diminutive forms (which often serve as nicknames) of longer names that begin with different letters. For example, Chema, Chucho, and Curro are diminutive forms of the names José María, Jesús, and Francisco, respectively.\n\nFamous people with Spanish first names that begin with ‘C’\n\nA famous namesake can make a name more attractive and endearing. The table below provides examples of well-known individuals with Spanish first names that begin with ‘C.’"
