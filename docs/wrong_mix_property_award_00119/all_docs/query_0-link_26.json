        "text": "Skin fragment\n\nCela-Picasso, shared passions. Gabarron collection\n\nThe exhibition \"Skin fragment. Cela-Picasso, shared passions. Gabarron collection\" will be open to the public until May 31, 2020 in the temporary exhibition hall of the Picasso Foundation at Plaza de la Merced nº 13, presenting the relationship of a story of friendship between two geniuses, Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Camilo José Cela (1916-2002), between the greatest artist of the 20th century and the Nobel Prize for Literature, two peaks of Spanish culture. It will show documents and images that visually symbolize the affinities and passions shared by two friends and creators who came together in various collaborations and projects. This exhibition is framed in the exhibition concept that in 2019 hosted the result of the collaboration between Picasso and Iliazd.\n\nCela and Picasso shared the same non-conformist and provocative character. Moreover, Cela's Galician origin attracted the sympathy of Picasso, who had begun his studies of Fine Arts in the Galician city of La Coruña. When Cela became a cultural agitator through his magazine Papeles de Son Armadans, which he published in Palma de Mallorca, his idea of dedicating a special issue to Picasso led him to Cannes to establish contact with the Malaga-born artist. This exhibition bears witness to the friendship between the two creators and the result of their collaboration thanks to the Gabarron Foundation, which owns the legacy of the artist and which reflects the relationship between the two creators through documents, editions and works by Picasso.\n\nIt was Joan Miró, who had already been the subject of a monographic issue of the magazine, who facilitated the contact between Cela and Picasso. In a letter from Cannes on August 1, 1958, addressed to his wife, Charo Conde, Cela explained his excitement at meeting the Malaga-born artist: \"Dearest Charo, it's 2 a.m. Last night I went to bed at 9:30 a.m., exhausted from the early morning hours and the trip, and now I have just woken up. Without being able to talk to anyone at all, the feeling of loneliness is total. I'm a bit demoralized. I called Jacqueline, after a tremendous effort to make myself understood, and was told \"she's not in\". With these words, full of concern, Camilo José Cela began the first of his letters to his wife. He had travelled there to arrange with Picasso, and his wife Jacqueline Roque, the publication of an issue of the magazine Papeles de Son Armadans dedicated to Picasso. The next day, he showed up at Picasso's house, just as he was sleeping and Jacqueline was absent, the attempts continued with an impatient and anxious Cela who would manage to meet Picasso that very day. The harmony between the two was immediate. On that initial visit, Picasso dedicated to Cela a drawing that would go on the cover of the magazine, published two years later. Over the course of 173 documents, of which we present a selection of 46, the friendship between Picasso and Cela that began with such bad omens is testified to. The result was a series of meetings in France between the artist and the writer, the publication of the special issue of Papeles de Son Armadans and a book of poems by Picasso plus two other illustrated books and a curious exhibition of Picasso's works in Mallorca.\n\nAlong with the April 1960 issue of Papeles de Son Armadans, documents are on display that bear witness to the preparatory work and reveal the key role played by Picasso's and Cela's wives, and the editions of Picasso's 1960 book of poems, Trozo de piel, entitled Picasso. Drawings and Writings, 1961, and Cela's book Gavilla de fábulas sin amor, 1962, mostly illustrated by Picasso. Together with these editorial collaborations, eight of the wax drawings that Picasso made for Cela on the day the Galician writer turned 45 on 11th May 1961 are exhibited. They are dedicated to Cela but also to his wife Charo Conde and his son Camilo José Cela Conde. A selection of Picasso's works (ceramics and engravings) also belonging to the Gabarrón collection serve to complete the panorama of that singular friendship between two exceptional creators."
