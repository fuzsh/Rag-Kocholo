        "text": "The Jurado Oficial has decided to award the prize for best film to Ludwig Wüst's I AM HERE! The Special Mention went to Melisa Liebenthal's El rostro de la medusa.\n\nThe Jurado Joven awarded the prize to The Wild Duck, by director Nadja Ericsson. The special mention went to Taxibol, by Tommaso Santambrogio.\n\nThe Temple Woods Gang, by Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche, received the award given by the Jurado Días de Cine. The new work by Spanish-German Salka Tiziana, Todos los sonidos entran adentro, wins the special mention.\n\nFILMADRID has confirmed the celebration of the X edition\n\nFILMADRID, Festival Internacional de Cine, has announced the list of winners of its IX edition, which this year was held between June 6 and 11.\n\nAt the closing gala that took place this afternoon, the Jurado Oficial made up ofdirector María Antón Cabot, IndieLisboa director Miguel Valverde, and producer and director of the film degree program at Camilo José Cela University, Piluca Baquero,decided to award the prize for best film to the Austrian I AM HERE!, de Ludwig Wüst, \"for imagining the crossing of two lives through a melancholic and moving poetry. For the authenticity of the story it tells and for its magnificent actors who carry out the dialogues of this story so naturally. For his successful directing style, simple, close and at the same time stylized, which is a brilliant narrative bet to tell us I AM HERE!\n\nThe winning film will receive the €3,000 UCJC Great Prize for best film at FILMADRID 2023 Official Section awarded by the Universidad Camilo José Cela.\n\nThe special mention in the official competition went to El rostro de la medusaby Argentine director Melisa Liebenthal. The reasons behind the verdict are \"its powerful premise, a woman whose face has changed for no reason, leads us to a profound reflection on current and existential identity. With this mysterious intuition, the director builds an intelligent story that mixes fiction and essay, which exudes freshness, humor and daring\".\n\nFor its part, the Jurado Joven, made up of Clara Borrazás, Daniel Cortiñas y Jorge Quill, awarded the prize to Swedish The Wild Duckby director Nadja Ericsson\"for reformulating Scandinavian drama and its codes, opening a gap between the closed shot and intimacy. Nadja Ericsson's first work with actors, speaking of the fragility of illusions, gives back to the metaphor all its strength when it seemed to have lost it\". The special mention went to Taxibol, by Italian director Tommaso Santambrogio\"for having historical memory on the rack through the hybridization of cinematographic codes. A portentous work that exposes, contains, and shoots against the horror of fascism and the ghosts that still populate the globe\".\n\nThe Temple Woods Gangin which French director Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche pays tribute to film noir, received the award from the Jurado Días de Cinemade up of Gerardo Sánchez, Raúl Alda y Javier Sales, with the following reasons: \"for its brilliant updating of a genre as classic and mistreated as the heist film and for its vindication of the genre as a valid way to talk about the social and political realities of the 21st century\".\n\nMeanwhile, the new work by Spanish-German Salka Tiziana, Todos los sonidos entran adentrowon the special mention \"for presenting such an emblematic place for the people of Madrid, La Casa de Campo, as a space of new meanings where the rural and its mysteries enter the city, illuminating it under a new gaze that incites reflection\".\n\nFILMADRID confirms 10th edition\n\nThe closing film, Mutzenbacher, by Ruth Beckermann has thus put an end to a ninth edition marked by the quality of its proposals and its outstanding heterogeneity. For six days, spectators have been able to enjoy an innovative programming model in three of the capital's leading theaters: La Casa Encendida, Cine Doré-Filmoteca Española y Cineteca-Matadero.\n\nFILMADRID, which every year seeks to promote an international cinema that is still unknown in Spain, has already confirmed the celebration of the next edition, the tenth, and although it did not want to give details, it has advanced that it will live up to this remarkable anniversary: 10 years changing the paradigm of the current film festivals of auteur cinema.\n\nAbout FILMADRID\n\nFor over 10 years, the Pasajes de Cine Cultural Association has been working to bring film culture closer to the Community of Madrid through conferences, colloquiums, courses, exhibitions and screenings. In 2015, it decided to go a step further and bet on bringing this content to the festival format. This is how FILMADRID, International Film Festival, was born.\n\nThe FILMADRID programming team is made up of renowned filmmakers, critics and theoreticians in charge of selecting the films, which must at least be premieres in the Community of Madrid, although most of them are usually national premieres and even international premieres.\n\nFILMADRID is part of MATRIZ, Madrid Film Festivals Network, and of the State Federation of Film and Audiovisual Content Festivals Coordinators, PANTALLA. These two alliances mean an improvement in the visibility of FILMADRID and in the expectations of private funding within Spain and Madrid.\n\nFILMADRID has the European support CREA MEDIA FESTNET and the support of the Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las Artes Audiovisuales (ICAA) and the Madrid City Council; with the sponsorship of the Camilo José Cela University, the special collaboration of the Austrian Cultural Forum and Goethe Institut, and the collaboration of Cineteca Bologne, Caimán Cuadernos de Cine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Lens Escuela de Artes Visuales, EFTI, ECAM, DARUMA and BARRÓN - M."
