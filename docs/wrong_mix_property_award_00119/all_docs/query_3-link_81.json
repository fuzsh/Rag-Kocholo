        "text": "Twenty-eight Stanford seniors, graduate students, and alumni have been awarded grants to pursue special projects abroad next year with funding from the Fulbright U.S. Student Program.\n\nThe Fulbright U.S. Student Program is designed to build lasting connections between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. It awards grants annually to more than 1,900 diverse U.S. students, artists, and early career professionals who will pursue special projects in more than 140 countries.\n\nThe 2024 Fulbright recipients affiliated with Stanford will travel to 15 countries, including Colombia, Estonia, Germany, New Zealand, Peru, Spain, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe, where they will carry out individually designed research projects, pursue graduate study programs, or take part in English Teaching Assistant (ETA) programs during the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nFollowing are the 22 Stanford affiliates who have accepted the award.\n\nLucille “Luci” Bresette (BS Human Biology ’24, MS Computer Science ’24) will teach English in the Canary Islands and partner with a local nonprofit to continue using the skills she developed as co-chair of Camp Kesem. She’ll also enroll in university courses.\n\nGrace Carroll (BA English ’24) will teach English in Taitung, Taiwan, and report on the county’s rapidly evolving cultural and political life.\n\nAlison “Ali” Cohen (BA Political Science ’24, MA Sustainability ’24) will teach English in Turkey and explore the nuances of Turkish culture, politics, and educational systems.\n\nElanor “Ela” Diffenbaugh (BA Sociology with a concentration in Data, Markets, and Management ’24) will teach English in Mexico with a side project of teaching bilingual yoga and hiking classes.\n\nElinor “Ellie” Fajer (BS Biology and Earth Systems ’23, MS Earth Systems ’24) will pursue a research-based master’s degree from the University of Auckland in New Zealand to investigate how fungal endophytes can bolster the host resistance of kauri trees to inhibit the spread of kauri dieback.\n\nAndrew Harper (BSH Materials Science and Engineering ’24) will teach English to business and technology undergraduate students at Universidad Camilo José Cela in Madrid, Spain. He also plans to host community-based ESL STEM exploration sessions for youth.\n\nMaryam Khalil (BSH Human Biology, International Security Studies ’23) will examine migrant health provision in Greece and Italy. Using mixed-methods research on access to and quality of care, she aims to inform European Union migration and health policy.\n\nVictoria Le (BS Chemistry ’24) will teach English in Vietnam and explore the connections between Vietnamese and American culture. She also plans to host an arts and crafts club at her host institution.\n\nBrandon Lieu (BS Biology [Computational] ’24, MS Community Health and Prevention Research ’24) will teach English in Vietnam while simultaneously digging deeper into his Vietnamese roots and learning more about public health in the country.\n\nAllie Littleton (BS Computer Science, MS Biomedical Informatics) will investigate health care fragmentation in Colombia and its effects on patient outcomes and public health.\n\nLinda Liu (BS Symbolic Systems ’24) will teach English in Taiwan and volunteer at local health clinics and traditional medicine clinics in order to gain insight into alternative medicine practices.\n\nAnna McNulty (BA International Relations ’24) will produce a storytelling project about women climate leaders in Peru through the mediums of writing, photography, and film 10 years after Peru’s Action Plan on Gender and Climate Change.\n\nDavid Monteserin Narayana (PhD Religious Studies) will conduct research with the aim of telling the story of how the famous Hindu deity, Śiva, came to be worshiped in the form of empty space in a medieval south Indian temple (Chidambaram).\n\nSophia Pribus (BS Biomedical Computation ’24) will pursue a project using long-read sequencing and single-cell sequencing technologies to explore and improve “ecDNA” structural predictions in Heidelberg, Germany. ecDNA are abnormal genomic structures in cancer cells, associated with poor cancer outcomes.\n\nGrant Regan (BS Engineering Physics ’23, MS Aeronautics and Astronautics ’24) will implement and characterize multi-satellite rendezvous and docking astrodynamics control algorithms via on-orbit testing with Technische Universität Berlin NanoFF satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\nKavya Srikanth (BS Mathematical and Computational Science ’23, MA History ’23) will pursue an MSc in medical anthropology at University College London. She will study health susceptibility among London’s migrant community and explore journalism.\n\nElena Stalnaker (BA Music, Science, and Technology ’23) will pursue a master’s in music composition and creative practice at the Hochschule der Künste Bern in Switzerland, where she will develop her work at the intersection of experimental pop, music theater, and live electronics.\n\nHannah Subotnick (MFA Art Practice ’20) will travel to the Netherlands to make a photographic portrait of philosopher Baruch Spinoza in absentia by tracing his presence through the places he lived. She will explore how Spinoza’s occupational practice of lens grinding relates metaphorically and poetically to his philosophy.\n\nAnita Taft (BA Human Biology ’24) will travel to Tajikistan to study family planning by determining attitudes and perceptions of contraceptive usage among women of reproductive age.\n\nNicole Tong (BS Symbolic Systems ’24) will investigate the design and regulation of equitable and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems in the European Union with professor Virginia Dignum in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\nParker Watt (BA International Relations ’24) will research and document through film how cultural identity is being preserved and changed among the Ukrainian refugee population in Estonia through the lens of song, dance, and storytelling."
