        "text": "The sultan was the second (or first, due to certain discrepancies in historical documentation) sultan of Malacca and reigned from 1414 to 1424. Why did he adopt the name \"Iskandar\" (Persian variant of the name \"Alexander\") and the title \"Shah\" (Persian for \"King\")?\n\nAfaik Islam was first spread in Southeast Asia by Arab or Turkish/Ottoman Muslim traders and I'm not aware that Southeast Asia have significant connections with Persia.\n\nAlso, I just found out that the Sultan of Kedah, Mudzaffar Shah I, adopted the title even earlier in 1136, around three hundred years earlier than the Malacca Sultanate."
