Detailed results for each cause of death in the analysis are available in downloadable form through the GBD Results tool and via visual exploration through the online tool GBD Compare. Summaries of results for each cause of death included in the analysis are available online.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2019, the annual rate of change in global deaths from all causes ranged from –0·9% (95% UI –2·7 to 0·8) to 2·4% (0·1 to 4·7; appendix 2 figure S1). The corresponding annual rates of change in the global age-standardised mortality rate ranged from –3·3% (–5·0 to –1·6) to 0·4% (–1·9 to 2·5). In 2020, however, the total number of deaths worldwide increased by 10·8% (6·4 to 15·4) compared with 2019, from 57·0 million deaths (54·9 to 59·5) in 2019 to 63·1 million deaths (60·6 to 65·9) in 2020. This trend persisted in 2021, with an increase of 7·5% (3·1 to 12·4) relative to 2020, to 67·9 million (65·0 to 70·8) deaths. The age-standardised mortality rate followed a similar pattern, increasing by 8·1% (3·9 to 12·4) in 2020 and an additional 5·2% (1·0 to 9·7) in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, deaths from COVID-19 and OPRM changed the pattern of mortality for the leading causes of age-standardised death (Figure 1, Figure 2; table 1). At Level 3 of the GBD cause-classification hierarchy, the rankings of the four causes of death with the highest age-standardised mortality rates were the same in 2019 as they were in 1990, with each showing a steady decline in its age-standardised death rate (figure 1). These causes were, in descending order, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lower respiratory infections. In 2021, however, COVID-19 replaced stroke as the second leading cause of age-standardised death globally (with 94·0 deaths [95% UI 89·2 to 100·0] per 100 000 population), with stroke becoming the third leading cause. Additionally, OPRM—which includes excess mortality associated with the pandemic, excluding COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, and pertussis causes—emerged as the fifth leading cause of age-standardised deaths in 2021; lower respiratory infections decreased from the fourth to the seventh leading cause. The effect of COVID-19 on age-standardised mortality was similar to that of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2020 but increased by 60·2% (53·1 to 67·6) in 2021, becoming similar to that of stroke and ischaemic heart disease (figure 2; table 1).\n\nTable 1Number of deaths and age-standardised mortality rates for ten leading Level 3 causes of death in 2020 and 2021, globally and by

(95% UI 4·56–5·11) deaths due to COVID-19 occurred globally in 2020, and 7·89 million (7·49–8·40) in 2021. Age-standardised rates of death due to COVID-19 were highly variable among GBD super-regions (table 1). In 2021, the rankings from highest to lowest were sub-Saharan Africa (271·0 deaths [250·1–290·7] per 100 000 population); Latin America and the Caribbean (195·4 deaths [182·1–211·4] per 100 000 population); north Africa and the Middle East (172·4 deaths [150·3–191·5] per 100 000 population); central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia (168·8 deaths [150·6–186·1] per 100 000 population); south Asia (156·5 deaths [150·4–164·4] per 100 000 population); high income (48·1 deaths [47·4–48·8] per 100 000 population); and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (23·2 deaths [16·3–37·2] per 100 000 population; table 1).\n\nDeaths from both COVID-19 and OPRM also varied substantially by age, with older ages being disproportionately affected (table 2). Individuals aged 70–74 years had the highest number of deaths from both COVID-19 and OPRM in 2020 and again in 2021. The highest percentage of total deaths from COVID-19 was found in those aged 40–44 years, whereas the highest mortality rate occurred in those aged 95 years and older. Death rates from OPRM were high among older age groups and among the youngest ages, with a rate of 141·2 deaths (95% UI 58·0–277·5) per 100 000 population for infants aged 0–6 days, and 77·3 deaths (44·0–118·0) per 100 000 population in infants aged 7–27 days. At a global scale, COVID-19 deaths and OPRM were slightly higher for males than for females in most age groups in 2021 (appendix 2 figure S5). Exceptions to this trend include those aged 90–94 years and those aged 95 years and older (appendix 2 figure S5).\n\nTable 2Number of deaths, age-standardised mortality rates, and percentage of total deaths due to COVID-19 and other pandemic-related mortality by age, globally\n\nDeathsDeaths per 100 000 populationPercentage of total deathsCOVID-19 2020COVID-19 2021Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2020Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2021COVID-19 2020COVID-19 2021Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2020Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2021COVID-19 2020COVID-19 2021Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2020Other COVID-19 pandemic-related outcomes 2021Early neonatal01351834620·0<0·1141·4141·20·0%<0·1%0·2%0·2%Late neonatal3550695641<0·10·168·577·3<0·1%<0·1%1·1%1·3%1–5 months1702872426926 6470·30·544·449·6<0·1%<0·1%3·1%3·6%6–11 months23439420 47830 8830·40·631·748·9<0·1%0·1%3·5%5·5%12–23 months998164419 04230 5500·81·314·523·80·2%0·3%3·7%6·2%2–4 years850014 38614 73023 5742·13·63·65·81·2%2·1%2·0%3·4%5–9 years705211 393537781961·01·70·81·21·9%3·2%1·5%2·3%10–14 years855314 405158827151·32·20·20·42·8%4·8%0·5%0·9%15–19 years17 03226 852593212 5762·84·31·02·03·1%4·8%1·1%2·2%20–24 years25 52840 743821917 4534·36·81·42·93·6%5·5%1·2%2·4%25–29 years47 85778 4961258128 8168·113·32·14·95·9%9·2%1·6%3·4%30–34 years81 232137 97921 62549 80813·422·83·68·27·9%12·3%2·1%4·5%35–39 years112 228195 38029 87769 40220·534·85·512·49·0%14·1%2·4%5·0%40–44 years165 337287 09944 391102 04133·557·49·020·410·3%16·0%2·8%5·7%45–49 years207 940355 38855 989124 89944·075·111·826·410·1%15·7%2·7%5·5%50–54 years253 491426 78567 629147 65157·795·915·433·29·1%14·0%2·4%4·8%55–59 years336 162564 50890 815191 44187·5142·723·648·49·0%13·8%2·4%4·7%60–64 years460 769774 879125 433262 008146·1242·139·881·99·8%15·0%2·7%5·1%65–69 years564 371957 557155 431321 301209·4347·157·7116·59·4%14·5%2·6%4·9%70–74 years585 549989 888156 931325 295298·7480·980·1158·08·8%13·2%2·4%4·3%75–79 years539 515861 796135 849276 402417·1653·4105·0209·67·9%11·8%2·0%3·8%80–84 years551 014888 813146 084277786638·91014·8169·4317·27·5%11·3%2·0%3·5%85–89 years427 770658 875106 842191 824959·31441·1239·6419·56·9%10·0%1·7%2·9%90–94 years280 605426 18567 297114 4491608·92382·3385·9639·87·5%10·8%1·8%2·9%≥95 years120 173174 39024 07442 1042298·63199·6460·5772·57·8%10·7%1·6%2·6%\n\nLeading causes of global YLLs\n\nThe causes of death with the highest age-standardised YLL rates show shifting epidemiological trends from CMNN diseases to NCDs at Level 3 of the cause hierarchy (appendix 2 figure S2). Globally, the leading three causes of age-standardised YLLs in 1990 were all CMNN diseases. Ranked in descending order, these causes were neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal diseases. In 2019, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of age-standardised YLLs, but the second and third leading causes were replaced by NCDs: ischaemic heart disease (ranked second) and stroke (ranked third). In 2021, COVID-19 was the second-leading cause of global age-standardised YLLs, making the leading two causes CMNN diseases (with neonatal disorders ranked first), with ischaemic heart disease ranked third. Among the leading causes of age-standardised YLLs, malaria was the only cause to show an increase in age-standardised YLL rates between 2019 and 2021 (ranking ninth in 2019 and seventh in 2021).\n\nDecomposition of global life expectancy\n\nWe found long-standing positive trends in global life expectancy since the early 1990s, with steady increases occurring across each decade between 1990 and 2019 (appendix 2 table S4). Altogether, the global increase in life expectancy from 1990 to 2019 totalled 7·8 years (95% UI 7·1–8·5). In 2019–21, however, we found a global decline in life expectancy of 2·2 years due to deaths from COVID-19 and OPRM combined. This decrease was partly offset by reductions in other diseases, for a net reduction in global life expectancy of 1·6 years. Despite this notable reduction, we observed an overall increase in life expectancy of 6·2 years (5·4–7·0) across the entire study period. This decomposition analysis provides insights into the specific causes that influenced changes in life expectancy over the defined time periods. Among the various contributing factors to a change in life expectancy, the cause with the greatest effect on the increase in life expectancy worldwide was the reduction in deaths caused by enteric infections (figure 3). This category includes diarrhoeal, typhoid, and paratyphoid diseases. A reduction in deaths from these diseases is responsible for a substantial increase in life expectancy of 1·1 years during 1990–2021, but this increase was most pronounced between 1990 and 2000 compared with other time periods. The second-largest effect on increasing life expectancy is attributed to the reduction in deaths from lower respiratory infection, contributing 0·9 years of gained life expectancy from 1990 to 2021. Other leading factors include reduced mortality from stroke, CMNN diseases, neonatal deaths, ischaemic heart disease, and neoplasms, each of which increased global life expectancy by 0·6–0·8 years over the study period. Changing rates of HIV/AIDS and malaria mortality both contributed positively to the overall global life expectancy in some years but negatively affected life expectancy in others. Beginning in 2000, reductions in HIV/AIDS-related mortality were evident following substantial negative effects in earlier years. Reductions in deaths from malaria, however, were less sustained, increasing life expectancy by 0·1 years from 2010 to 2019 but having no effect from 2019 to 2021. Across all causes, the largest effect on the change in global life expectancy was from COVID-19, which resulted in a decline of 1·6 years between 2019 and 2021.\n\nDecomposition of super-region, regional, and country-level life expectancy\n\nEach of the seven super-regions experienced an overall increase in life expectancy between 1990 and 2021, despite progress in each being differentially affected by COVID-19 (Figure 4, Figure 5). Southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania showed the highest gain, with a net improvement of 8·3 years (95% UI 6·7–9·9), while also being the least affected by COVID-19, which contributed a loss in life expectancy of just 0·4 years. The overall increase in life expectancy in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania can largely be attributed to reduced mortality from chronic respiratory diseases, contributing to a gain of 1·2 years, whereas reduced mortality from stroke, lower respiratory infections, and neoplasms were among other causes that contributed to the 8·3-year (6·7–9·9) increase. The second-largest gain occurred in south Asia, where life expectancy increased by 7·8 years (6·7–8·9), which can be largely attributed to reduced mortality from enteric infectious diseases, contributing a substantial gain of 3·1 years in life expectancy. The largest reduction in overall life expectancy due to COVID-19 occurred in the super-region of Latin America and the Caribbean, which experienced a loss of 3·6 years. Reductions in deaths due to malaria throughout sub-Saharan Africa led to an increase in life expectancy of 0·8 years for the super-region.\n\nThe differential effect of COVID-19 on reduced life expectancy was observed across GBD regions (figure 6). Although most regions experienced overall improvements in life expectancy between 1990 and 2021, a reduction occurred in southern sub-Saharan Africa, which faced the greatest impact of HIV and was also heavily affected by COVID-19. The overall decrease in life expectancy of 4·3 years (95% UI 3·0–5·8) included a reduction of 2·4 years due to HIV/AIDS and 3·4 years due to COVID-19, which were only partly offset by reductions in mortality due to other causes. Notably, COVID-19 reduced life expectancy in Andean Latin America by 4·9 years, although the region had an overall gain of 2·6 years (1·0–4·1) between 1990 and 2021. The effect of COVID-19 in eastern sub-Saharan Africa, which resulted in a reduction in life expectancy of 2·7 years, was offset by steady improvements across many different causes, which resulted in the highest overall increase in life expectancy among GBD regions (10·7 years [9·0–12·2]). Control of enteric infections in this region contributed to an increase in life expectancy of 1·9 years, along with reductions in lower respiratory infections and tuberculosis, each of which contributed to an additional 1·6 years' increase in life expectancy. Each region in sub-Saharan Africa experienced reductions in the number of enteric infections, which improved life expectancy in those regions between 0·8 and 2·4 years.\n\nHIV/AIDS had a substantial negative effect on life-expectancy trends in southern sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2021 (appendix 2 figure S27). Despite improvements in each of the time periods 2000–2010, 2010–2019, and 2019–2021, this region was unable to recover the 9·0 years lost during 1990–2000. Although we found a net decline in deaths due to HIV/AIDS between 2000 and 2019, improvements slowed substantially from 2019 to 2021, when only 0·2 years in life expectancy were gained as a result of reduced HIV/AIDS mortality. Conversely, eastern sub-Saharan Africa had the highest level of recovery to their life expectancy among the regions, gaining 1·5 years of life expectancy over the entire study period.\n\nIn 1990, malaria-related deaths had almost no effect on life expectancy in eight of the 21 GBD regions (appendix 2 figure S13). By 2021, however, 90% of malaria deaths across all age groups occurred in locations with only 12% of the global population. Efforts to control malaria in various regions of sub-Saharan Africa have yielded modest gains in life expectancy. Central sub-Saharan Africa gained 0·7 years in life expectancy between 2000 and 2010, western sub-Saharan Africa gained 0·9 years during 2010–19, and eastern sub-Saharan Africa gained 0·7 years in 2000–10. Despite these advancements, many regions with malaria transmission experienced a decline in life expectancy from 2019 to 2021. The most noticeable reductions were in eastern sub-Saharan Africa, with a decrease of 0·2 years, followed by western sub-Saharan Africa, which lost 0·1 years in life expectancy over the same period.\n\nAt the national level, some of the highest gains in life expectancy between 1990 and 2021 occurred in the eastern region of sub-Saharan Africa (appendix 2 figure S12). Life expectancy in Ethiopia increased by 18·2 years (95% UI 16·3–19·8) as a result of reductions in deaths from many causes, most notably other communicable and maternal disorders (3·2 years), tuberculosis (3·1 years), and enteric infectious diseases (2·4 year). The largest reduction in life expectancy occurred in Lesotho, at 12·9 years (10·1–15·7), largely attributed to increased deaths from HIV/AIDS, which resulted in a reduction of 7·3 years (appendix 2 figures S12, S27, table S4).\n\nEffect of CMNN diseases on life expectancy and trends in mortality concentration\n\nAmong CMNN causes, several key trends emerged in their effect on global life expectancy and the localisation of deaths over time. First, the reduction of deaths due to enteric disease had a substantial impact on global life expectancy, with notable regional variations (figure 7). As 160 countries and territories made progress in reducing CMNN disease-related mortality, mortality concentration emerged. Deaths became more concentrated into certain countries or regions, persisting alongside advancements made in other parts of the world. An illustrative example is the shift in deaths due to enteric diseases in children younger than 5 years, with 90% of deaths occurring in locations containing 63% of the population of children younger than 5 years in 1990, decreasing to locations containing 51% of the population by 2021 (appendix 2 figure S28). Second, the reduction in the number of lower respiratory infections yielded positive effects on life expectancy in some regions. Regions such as Andean Latin America and western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had gains of 1·6 years in life expectancy due to reduced deaths from lower respiratory infections. This progress is further underscored by the transformation from 90% of deaths from lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years occurring in locations with 71% of the population of the under-5 population in 1990 to 90% occurring in locations with 58% of the under-5 population by 2021, signalling substantial improvements in some regions and increased concentration of this cause in others (figure 8; appendix 2 figure S29). Third, HIV/AIDS had a substantial impact on life-expectancy trends, particularly in southern sub-Saharan Africa, and with 90% of deaths concentrated in locations containing 46% of the entire population and 39% of the under-5 population in 2021 (appendix 2 figures S27, S30). However, HIV/AIDS was less concentrated in 2021 than in 1990. Fourth, efforts to control malaria in sub-Saharan Africa resulted in modest gains in life expectancy. Similarly, 90% of malaria-related deaths in 2021 occurred in locations containing only 12% of the entire population and 20% of the under-5 population, showing mortality concentration (figure 5; appendix 2 figures S13, 31). Fifth, reductions in tuberculosis-related deaths had a positive effect on life expectancy across all regions, and changes in mortality rates indicated mortality concentration, with 90% of deaths occurring in locations containing 66% of the entire population in 1990, decreasing to 62% by 2021 (figure 9; appendix 2 figure S14). Lastly, although measles had a relatively small global effect on life expectancy, this cause showed high mortality concentration. The disease remained contained globally, with 90% of deaths concentrated in locations containing only 15% of the entire population and 24% of the under-5 population in 2021 (figure 3; appendix 2 figure S15).\n\nReductions in neonatal deaths contributed to a 0·6-year increase in global life expectancy. Also, 90% of neonatal deaths were concentrated in locations containing 71% of the population in 1990, decreasing to 51% by 2021 (appendix 2 figures S16, S34). Finally, nutritional deficiencies had a relatively small global impact on life expectancy but substantial effects on specific regions—eastern sub-Saharan Africa, central sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia saw notable increases. We found a shift towards mortality concentration, with 90% of nutritional deficiency-related deaths in children younger than 5 years concentrated in locations containing 49% of the population in this age group by 2021, compared with 59% in 1990 (appendix 2 figures S18, S35). Overall, CMNN diseases showed a large degree of mortality concentration.\n\nEffect of NCDs on life expectancy and trends in mortality concentration\n\nAmong NCDs, several findings reflect their effect on global life expectancy and death concentration. Reductions in stroke led to a notable gain in life expectancy of 0·8 years, but stroke deaths were not concentrated, with 90% occurring in locations containing 84% of the global population (appendix 2 figures S23, S36). Similarly, ischaemic heart disease had a substantial effect on improvement to life expectancy, contributing 0·6 years to global life expectancy; yet, as with stroke, ischaemic heart disease showed little mortality concentration, with 90% of deaths concentrated in locations containing 84% of the population in 2021 (appendix 2 figures S17, S37). Neoplasms added 0·6 years to life expectancy, with high-income regions greatly benefiting; as with other NCDs, 90% of neoplasms deaths occurred in locations containing 86% of the population in 2021, indicating a consistent risk of dying from cancer regardless of geography (appendix 2 figures S19, S38). Chronic respiratory diseases contributed an increase of 0·5 years to life expectancy, with east Asia contributing the most to this increase through substantial improvements in mortality in China. Chronic respiratory diseases also showed little mortality concentration, with 90% of deaths occurring in locations containing 79% of the population (appendix 2 figures S20, S39). Digestive diseases and cirrhosis had a substantial negative effect on life expectancy, with little improvement from 2010 to 2019, and showed little mortality concentration (appendix 2 figures S21, S40). Diabetes and kidney diseases had a negative effect on life expectancy, resulting in a global loss of 0·1 years in life expectancy. This cause also had little mortality concentration, with 90% of deaths occurring in locations representing 89% of the population (appendix 2 figures S22, S41). Overall, NCDs largely did not show concentration, meaning that we did not observe mortality from these causes moving towards more restricted geographical areas (appendix 2 figure S42).\n\nEffect of injuries on life expectancy and trends in mortality concentration\n\nThe reduction in transport injuries had a positive effect on life expectancy, contributing to a gain of 0·2 years. However, as with NCDs, transport injury-related mortality was not concentrated, with 90% of deaths concentrated in locations containing 88% of the population in 1990, decreasing slightly to 84% of the population by 2021 (appendix 2 figures S24, S43). Unintentional injuries also showed little mortality concentration, with 90% of deaths occurring in locations containing 88% of the population in 2021 (appendix 2 figures S26, S44). Lastly, the overall reduction in mortality rates from self-harm and interpersonal violence contributed to a 0·2-year increase in life expectancy with variable mortality concentration, showing concentration in central and tropical Latin America and South Africa, but not exclusively in these locations (appendix 2 figures S25, S45).\n\nDiscussion\n\nMain findings\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most defining global health events of recent history. Our latest comprehensive estimates of cause-specific mortality give insight into the global landscape of disease before and during the first 2 years of the pandemic, revealing the important changes in disease-burden patterns that followed. After more than three decades of consistent improvements in global life expectancy and declining age-standardised death rates, COVID-19 reversed long-standing progress and disrupted trends in the epidemiological transition. As the second leading cause of age-standardised deaths in 2021, COVID-19 had a pronounced influence on the reduction in global life expectancy that occurred. The heterogeneous influence of the disease across the globe provides important insights for improving future pandemic preparedness and ensuring that nations are equitably equipped to respond to new outbreaks. Additionally, our analysis of geographical and temporal trends in mortality enables us to observe the changing patterns in causes of death worldwide. Many causes have exhibited a reduced geographical reach—a reflection of dedicated and persistent mitigation efforts to reduce the burden of certain causes, as well as potential changes to risk-factor exposure.\n\n15\n\nMurray CJL\n\nAravkin AY\n\nZheng P\n\net al.\n\nGBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators\n\nGlobal burden of 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\n\nThis study offers an opportunity to apply the lessons learned from these successes to further reduce deaths from causes that are now present within smaller, more concentrated areas throughout the world.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe emergence and spread of COVID-19 follows a similar pattern of regional heterogeneity that is common among many leading communicable causes of death, with higher rates of infection and increased fatalities occurring in lower-resource settings.\n\n6\n\nVos T\n\nLim SS\n\nAbbafati C\n\net al.\n\nGlobal burden of 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\n\n,\n\n16\n\nLevin AT\n\nOwusu-Boaitey N\n\nPugh S\n\net al.\n\nAssessing the burden of COVID-19 in developing countries: systematic review, meta-analysis and public policy implications.\n\n,\n\n17\n\nBarber RM\n\nSorensen RJD\n\nPigott DM\n\net al.\n\nEstimating global, regional, and national daily and cumulative infections with SARS-CoV-2 through Nov 14, 2021: a statistical analysis.\n\nAlthough heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes in 2020 and 2021 varied by the income status of a country or territory, outcomes were also directly related to age, government actions to close borders, and the implementation of transmission-reduction policies.\n\n18\n\nTelles CR\n\nRoy A\n\nAjmal MR\n\net al.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 management policies tailored to airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission: policy analysis.\n\nThis general pattern did not always hold true at the national level, however, where estimates from some high-income countries showed a much greater burden than would have been expected, indicating important opportunities for improved pandemic preparedness and response in these nations.\n\n19\n\nBollyky TJ\n\nHulland EN\n\nBarber RM\n\net al.\n\nPandemic preparedness and COVID-19: an exploratory analysis of infection and fatality rates, and contextual factors associated with preparedness in 177 countries, from Jan 1, 2020, to Sept 30, 2021.\n\nThe varying effects across locations emphasises the complexity of the pandemic.

As previously predicted,\n\n3\n\nWang H\n\nPaulson KR\n\nPease SA\n\net al.\n\nEstimating excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis of COVID-19-related mortality, 2020–21.\n\nCOVID-19 shifted baseline patterns of mortality for diseases and injuries that were affected by physical-distancing measures and other government-mandated restrictions. Deferred care-seeking during the height of the pandemic also probably contributed to shifts in patterns of mortality for some diseases and injuries and might also have contributed to the emergence of pandemic-related deaths not attributable directly to COVID-19, lower respiratory infections, measles, malaria, or pertussis (OPRM). Deferred care-seeking might also have been a contributing factor in the notable divergence in the age distribution in deaths between COVID-19 and OPRM, whereby COVID-19 deaths were substantially higher in older ages, whereas the highest rate of OPRM was seen in older ages as well as in children younger than 23 months. Mortality might have increased in the youngest ages because caregivers might have hesitated to seek medical care during the peak of the virus's spread. Understanding these disparities is imperative for shaping future health policies and preparedness efforts.\n\nImportant trends in life expectancy\n\nAdvancements over the past three decades in the prevention and control of infectious diseases have contributed to increases in life expectancy in many locations, increasing the need to support populations living with NCDs.\n\n23\n\nKyu HH\n\nAbate D\n\nAbate KH\n\net al.\n\nGlobal, regional, and national disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 359 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.\n\nThe global decline in life expectancy that occurred in 2020 and 2021 confounds the longer-term trend of increase.\n\n10\n\nWang H\n\nAbbas KM\n\nAbbasifard M\n\net al.\n\nGlobal age-sex-specific fertility, mortality, healthy life expectancy (HALE), and population estimates in 204 countries and territories, 1950–2019: a comprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.\n\nOur decomposition analysis suggests that this decline was predominantly a result of the pandemic (combined COVID-19 and OPRM), but the degree of severity varied greatly by location. Although large improvements in many causes—including HIV/AIDS and lower respiratory and enteric infections—somewhat counterbalanced the decline, the decrease in life expectancy was also compounded by increasing rates of mortality from other causes, such as diabetes and kidney diseases.\n\nThe effect of COVID-19 on life expectancy showed varying degrees of severity, ranging from a large loss of 4·9 years in Andean Latin America to almost no change in east Asia. From 1990 to 2021, reductions in many of the leading causes of death resulted in overall life-expectancy increases across most regions, despite heavy setbacks for many because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that despite Andean Latin America having the largest regional reduction in life expectancy due to the pandemic, overall life-expectancy reductions across the region were tempered by improvements in other causes, with reductions in rates of death from lower respiratory infections and neonatal disorders responsible for an increase in life expectancy of 2·6 years overall between 1990 and 2021. The impressive reductions in neonatal disorders throughout many countries in Andean Latin America have been attributed to the improvements made in implementing effective maternal and neonatal health intervention strategies.\n\n24\n\nHaws R\n\nWinch PJ\n\nCastillo J\n\nInnovative community-based interventions to improve newborn health in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe reduction in life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa also exceeded the global average by a substantial margin, with a reduction of 3·4 years due to COVID-19. Although life expectancy in the region was substantially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction was also attributable to high mortality rates from HIV/AIDS. Some nations with high pandemic-related death tolls were among those already burdened by high rates of other infectious diseases. Several countries in southern sub-Saharan Africa navigated the challenges of the pandemic, alongside long histories of combatting some of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in the world.\n\n25\n\nWhiteside A\n\nHenry FE\n\nThe impact of HIV and AIDS research: a case study from Swaziland.\n\n,\n\n26\n\nDwyer-Lindgren L\n\nCork MA\n\nSligar A\n\net al.\n\nMapping HIV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa between 2000 and 2017.\n\nA subset of countries were faced with a triple burden of COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.\n\n27\n\nNachega JB\n\nKapata N\n\nSam-Agudu NA\n\net al.\n\nMinimizing the impact of the triple burden of COVID-19, tuberculosis and HIV on health services in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe combined burden of these causes across southern sub-Saharan Africa was not offset by sufficient improvements in mortality from other causes, leading to an overall reduction in the region's life expectancy of more than 4 years over the entire study period.\n\nCause-specific patterns of mortality concentration\n\nEstimates of mortality concentration reflect shifting patterns of disease over time, from diseases that have a widespread presence moving to more geographically reduced subsets of the global population. These changes highlight differences between populations and their progress towards reducing mortality due to diseases and injuries. These findings also provide an important opportunity to improve how best public health practices are applied to further disease reduction. Broadly, widespread declines in many communicable diseases resulted in mortality from these causes exhibiting more concentrated geographical distributions in 2021 relative to patterns seen in 1990. The degree of mortality concentration estimated by this study for enteric and lower respiratory infections, malaria, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, and tuberculosis reflects substantial global progress in reducing mortality from these causes over the study period, underscoring the success of several public health campaigns, global commitments, and improvements in communicable-disease programmes.\n\n28\n\nDuarte R\n\nSilva DR\n\nRendon A\n\net al.\n\nEliminating tuberculosis in Latin America: making it the point.\n\n,\n\n29\n\nWHO\n\nWorld health statistics 2022: monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals.\n\n,\n\n30\n\nWHO\n\nWorld health statistics 2023: monitoring health for the SDGs, sustainable development goals.\n\nEstimates of mortality concentration can be used to examine where disease mitigation strategies have been successful, where they can be further implemented to reduce inequality, and where more research might be needed to develop effective treatment and intervention strategies.\n\nNotably, our estimates support previous findings\n\n31\n\nRosenthal PJ\n\nJohn CC\n\nRabinovich NR\n\nMalaria: how are we doing and how can we do better?.\n\nthat show deaths from malaria are becoming increasingly concentrated and are now particularly concentrated within western sub-Saharan Africa, with an additional corridor running through central Africa and into Mozambique. Countries in western sub-Saharan Africa with the highest under-5 death rates from malaria in 2021 included Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, and Niger. This concentration of malaria mortality reflects both differential rates of population growth across Africa, as well as the varying rates of progress in reducing transmission, most notably by malaria nets treated with long-lasting insecticide and in strengthening case management.\n\n32\n\nBhatt S\n\nWeiss DJ\n\nCameron E\n\net al.\n\nThe effect of malaria control on Plasmodium falciparum in Africa between 2000 and 2015.\n\nAt a time of growing threats to progress against malaria, including emerging parasite and vector resistance and budgetary pressures, but also amid promising new tools such as second vaccine for malaria, it is more important than ever that changing patterns of mortality are quantified and understood.\n\n33\n\nWHO\n\nWHO recommends R21/Matrix-M vaccine for malaria prevention in updated advice on immunization.\n\n,\n\n34\n\nNaddaf M\n\nSecond malaria vaccine to win global approval is cheaper and easier to make.\n\nEnteric infections showed large disease concentration. Under-5 deaths from enteric infections were largely concentrated within sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia with the highest under-5 death rates from enteric infections in 2021 included Chad, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. There are many contributing factors that should be considered when examining how to reduce enteric infections in the remaining concentrated locations. Alongside the provision of oral rehydration solution and rotavirus vaccines, critical public health improvements such as in water, sanitation, and hygiene might have contributed to decreases in enteric deaths.\n\n35\n\nBlack R\n\nFontaine O\n\nLamberti L\n\net al.\n\nDrivers of the reduction in childhood diarrhea mortality 1980-2015 and interventions to eliminate preventable diarrhea deaths by 2030.\n\n,\n\n36\n\nTroeger CE\n\nKhalil IA\n\nBlacker BF\n\net al.\n\nQuantifying risks and interventions that have affected the burden of lower respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years: an analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.\n\nChildhood growth failure, also a leading risk factor for deaths from lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles, must be addressed through interventions to improve women's health including anaemia, promotion of early exclusive breastfeeding, and management of acute malnutrition, among others.\n\n37\n\nDas JK\n\nSalam RA\n\nSaeed M\n\nKazmi FA\n\nBhutta ZA\n\nEffectiveness of interventions for managing acute malnutrition in children under five years of age in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n,\n\n38\n\nMertens A\n\nBenjamin-Chung J\n\nColford Jr, JM\n\net al.\n\nCauses and consequences of child growth faltering in low-resource settings.\n\nCountries with the highest burden of infectious disease mortality in children younger than 5 years tend to be geographically clustered, suggesting multisectoral approaches are necessary to continue reducing mortality in the countries with the highest rates.\n\n39\n\nReiner Jr, RC\n\nHay SI\n\nThe overlapping burden of the three leading causes of disability and death in sub-Saharan African children.\n\nA broad and recurring theme from this study is that reductions in enteric infections contributed to improved life expectancies over the past several decades.

These trends emphasise a key distinction in the spatial dynamics of NCDs compared with many communicable diseases. Although non-communicable causes might not exhibit the same degree of concentration as communicable causes, the mortality burden has changed in distribution, reducing over time in high-income countries and regions, while persisting in low-income countries and regions. Age-standardised mortality rates due to NCDs decreased in most locations within the high-income; Latin America and the Caribbean; north Africa and the Middle east; and central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia super-regions between 1990 and 2021. However, NCDs in the south Asia; sub-Saharan Africa; and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania super-regions have either increased or decreased at notably lower levels in 2021 compared with in 1990. Examples of this trend include ischaemic heart disease, neoplasms, and stroke, all of which largely declined over the study period—although their reductions have been widely dispersed and not as targeted as the CMNN causes. These findings show that NCDs do not appear to be moving towards more condensed geographical locations over time in the same way that many CMNN diseases are, which could make interventions and policies more complex to implement.\n\nUltimately, the extent of mortality concentration reflects both the progress achieved in health-care advancements and the shortcomings that persist in their equitable implementation. Disease concentration is evidence that there are effective interventions and policies that have successfully reduced disease burden in many locations, but these innovations have not been equitably distributed throughout the world or have been ineffective at addressing the specific challenges certain populations face. There remains a global need to improve access to new interventions and vaccines, to invest in the implementation of validated public health policies, and to strategise with geographical sources of disease in mind. Future efforts should continue the ongoing mitigation of communicable diseases, focusing on locations where these causes have become more geographically concentrated, while also initiating efforts to combat chronic causes within low-resourced settings. Additionally, patterns of high geographical concentration among infectious causes and low geographical concentration among chronic causes reflect the global epidemiological transition, wherein mortality rates of infectious deaths declined throughout most years of our study. The increased concentration of a cause of death, particularly communicable diseases, illustrates success in mitigation that can be adapted within the countries and regions with mortality concentration identified in our study, with the potential to greatly reduce mortality from those causes of death.\n\nLimitations\n\nMethodological advancements have enabled GBD 2021 to produce cause-specific estimates of mortality more easily than in previous iterations; however, as with any study of this scope, there are several important limitations to acknowledge. Cause-specific limitations for every cause of death in GBD are detailed in appendix 1 (section 3). Here, we describe cross-cutting limitations with applicability across many causes. First, sparsity of data or unreliability of data from specific regions, time periods, or age groups can influence the accuracy of our estimates, particularly poor data quality and coverage from western, eastern, southern, and central sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Second, the quality of cause-of-death and verbal-autopsy data rely on accurately coded death certificates to the international standards set by the International Classification of Diseases and are subject to the practice of the doctor completing the death certificate, who may or may not have received training to facilitate comparability of reporting underlying causes of death. This process is further complicated by comorbidities at the time of death, which might affect the accuracy of both vital-registration and verbal-autopsy data sources. A key data-processing method for GBD is the re-allocation of incorrectly or vaguely assigned deaths—referred to as garbage codes\n\n11\n\nJohnson SC\n\nCunningham M\n\nDippenaar IN\n\net al.\n\nPublic health utility of cause of death data: applying empirical algorithms to improve data quality.\n\n—to a more accurate, plausible underlying cause of death. This step helps to create comparable cause-specific estimates of mortality by underlying cause. Third, GBD assesses quality of cause-of-death data partly by examining levels of completeness, which indicate the accuracy with which the vital registration can capture deaths that occur in a location-year, irrespective of the percentage of garbage coding. Data completeness depends on the percentage of well-certified data, which is not necessarily indicative of low garbage coding. Fourth, some sources of uncertainty, including the covariates used in models, are not captured in our estimation process. Fifth, we used a negative binomial modelling approach to improve our estimation of deaths for some causes with over-dispersed data, but do not have a standardised empirical approach for selecting causes to which we apply this method. Sixth, to provide estimates for locations with low levels of completeness, as well as to address the lags in data reporting that occur, our estimates for the most recent years depend more heavily on the modelling process. For causes where data are limited, providing estimates with appropriate uncertainty is preferable to providing no information. Seventh, in the calculation of life expectancy decomposition, there is instability when the difference in all-cause deaths is too small. In this case, we use the reduced Das Gupta equation (appendix 1 section 7). Additionally, to avoid assigning positive life-expectancy contributions to COVID-19-related causes, if the signs for the change in life expectancy and all-cause deaths were the same, we used the same reduced Das Gupta formula, except in the case that the cause in question was COVID-19-related (either COVID-19 or OPRM), when a modified version was used. When viewing life expectancy decomposition, it is important to understand the effects of fatal discontinuity events, such as earthquakes or conflict. If life-expectancy decomposition is calculated for 2 consecutive years, we can see the effect of unique, stochastic events, but for the longer time periods, the interpretation of the effect of these events will be misleading. This method works well with causes that have continuous time trends, and not for causes that have mortality spikes in select years and locations. This type of event confounds true health trends within a time period because the absence or presence of a disaster is seen as a change in life expectancy. Finally, this cycle of GBD contains additional limitations that pertain to modelling deaths and related mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic. The limitations of the methods used to calculate COVID-19 have been fully outlined in previous publications,\n\n12\n\nGBD 2021 Demographics Collaborators\n\nGlobal age-sex-specific mortality, life expectancy, and population estimates in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, 1950–2021, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: a comprehensive demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.\n\nbut it is important to reiterate that COVID-19 estimates are limited by data-source availability. The methods to estimate COVID-19-related deaths were especially limited in certain regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, which means our estimates in these areas are solely driven by relationships with covariates. Future development of these data sources is crucial because estimates improve as the quality of the underlying data sources improves. Subsequent GBD cycles will provide revised estimates after additional data for recent years become available.\n\nFuture directions\n\nIn the next iteration of GBD, we will include over 100 location-years of vital registration and other data types that have been reported since GBD 2021 estimates were produced. Additionally, we will continue to expand the estimation of causes of death by disaggregating broad categories of causes of death into more detailed causes where available. These improvements aim to enhance precision and timeliness of estimates of COVID-19-related deaths and other cause of death. We also plan to simplify our approach to estimating COVID-19-related deaths. In lieu of the residual OPRM category reported in GBD 2021, we will use all available location-years of cause-of-death data to attribute mortality to specific causes, removing this residual category. We anticipate that this method will facilitate more timely and actionable insights for public health planning and policy making, especially as we expect to observe more regular and modellable mortality patterns in the post-pandemic years. Through these advancements, we will improve the utility and accuracy of the GBD study as a tool for effective public strategies.\n\nConclusion\n\nFindings from GBD 2021 provide a comprehensive overview of long-term mortality trends along with important insights into the COVID-19 pandemic years. The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the landscape of global health and mortality. As a leading cause of death, COVID-19 reduced life expectancy in 2 years nearly as much as reductions in communicable and NCDs have improved it over decades. The changes in mortality caused by the pandemic were not predictable through the standard GBD estimation methods and required the development and application of novel estimation methods as the pandemic emerged in real time. These timely updates on causes of death are essential for monitoring progress, identifying prevailing health concerns, guiding targeted interventions, and optimising resource allocation. GBD 2021 shows that better life expectancy outcomes might be achieved by leveraging past successes in mortality reduction. If future policy efforts are guided by the successes made in countries and regions with effective disease-mitigation programmes, such achievements might be replicated in locations where high mortality persists. While COVID-19 and other health challenges continue, GBD 2021 can offer valuable guidance for public health investment and policy making."
