        "text": "About Shahjahan :\n\nThe fifth and popular Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is the most remembered king of the Mughal dynasty, for building the Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world. The Taj Mahal is a symbol of love between Shah Jahan and his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was an avid lover of art and architecture. He strongly promoted the art, architecture and culture of the Mughal era during his reign, so Shah Jahan’s era is also known as the golden age of architecture and the most prosperous period of Indian civilization.\n\nShah Jahan was a brave, just and far-reaching Mughal emperor. Son of the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the grandson of the famous Mughal emperor Akbar. After the death of Jahangir, at a very young age, Shah Jahan took over the throne of the Mughal Empire. Shah Jahan greatly expanded the Mughal Empire due to his efficient strategy, Shah Jahan had achieved a lot in the reign of just 30 years, let’s know some special things about his life.\n\nHe also made his mark around the world as a true lover, was born on January 5, 1592, in Lahore as the son of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and ‘Jagat Gosai’ (Jodha Bai). His mother was the daughter of Raja Udai Singh Ji, the ruler of Jodhpur. Shah Jahan was born as the grandson of the Great Mughal Emperor Akbar. The Mughal emperor Akbar called him Shahzada(prince) Khurram, so his name was Khurram in childhood which means happiness. Akbar had left no stone unturned to make Shah Jahan a great warrior, he started training him in military skills from childhood.\n\nShah Jahan had a very strained relationship with his father Jahangir. Because, Jahangir paid more attention and believed in the diplomacy of his clever wife Nur Jahan, due to that Shahjahan and Jahangir did not make much. At the same time, just as Jahangir had revolted with his father Akbar and took over the reign of the Mughal Empire, in the same way, Shah Jahan also took over the rule of the Mughal Empire by deceiving his father Jahangir.\n\nName : Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Khurram\n\nBirth: 5 January 1592, Lahore, Pakistan\n\nDeath: 30 January 1666 (aged 74), Agra Fort, Agra India\n\nReign: 19 January 1628 – 31 July 1658\n\nPredecessor: Jahangir\n\nSuccessor: Aurangzeb\n\nFather: Jahangir\n\nMother: Jagat Gosain\n\nConsort: Mumtaj Mahal\n\nWives: Kandahari Begum\n\nAkbarabadi Mahal,\n\nFatehpuri Mahal,\n\nLilavati Bai(Jodhpur)\n\nShahjahan as heir to the Mughal Throne\n\nShah Jahan’s step-mother Nur Jahan absolutely did not want Shah Jahan to sit on the Mughal throne. Shah Jahan also understood Nur Jahan’s conspiracy and raged war in 1622 AD, although he could not succeed in this. After the death of his father Jahangir in 1627 AD, Shah Jahan, using his clever lore, instructed his father-in-law Asaf Khan to eliminate all the main claimants to the heirs to the Mughal throne.\n\nAfter which Asaf Khan cleverly killed Dabur Baksh, Hoshankar, Gurusasp, Shahryar and thus Shah Jahan was placed on the Mughal throne. Even at a very young age, Shah Jahan was chosen as the heir to the Mughal throne by Akbar. In the year 1628 AD Shah Jahan was coronated in Agra and he was honoured with the title of “Abul-Muzaffar Shahabuddin, Muhammad Sahib Kiran-e-Sani”.\n\nAfter assuming the Mughal throne, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan gave the most trusted Asaf Khan the post of state’s Wazir. Shah Jahan ruled for about 30 years from 1628 to 1658 due to his intelligence and efficient strategies. His reign has been called the golden age of Mughal rule and the most prosperous period of time as he conquered many states and merged into the Mughal Empire and expanded it.\n\nShahjahan's Architecture\n\nShah Jahan, from the very beginning, was an avid, courageous and extremely intelligent ruler. He was an esoteric lover of art and architecture. during his reign, He Promoted art and architecture a lot and built many such historical buildings and developed beautiful gardens that are still recorded on the pages of history one of them is the Taj Mahal, which is counted among the 7 wonders of the world due to its grand beauty and historical importance. Most of the structures and architecture built during the reign of Shah Jahan have been constructed using white marble.\n\nLet me also tell you that during the reign of Shah Jahan, the prosperity, glory and fame of the Mughal Empire was in the seventh sky, many eminent people from the country and abroad used to come to Shahjahan’s court and wondered to see the splendour and luxuries. And also used to appreciate his royal court. Shah Jahan played a very big role in strengthening the Mughal Empire.\n\nShahjahan’s reign was prosperous, with ample treasure there was no place for poverty. Therefore, Shah Jahan had made his image in front of his subjects as an efficient administrator. Due to his diplomacy and intelligence, Shah Jahan had also established friendly relations with many countries, which encouraged trade. during his reign and the state developed a lot.\n\nIn the year 1638, Shah Jahan shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi, naming his new capital Shahjahanabad. During this time he built many famous historical buildings including Red Fort, Jama-Masjid in Delhi. Then in the year 1648, the famous Peacock Throne of the Mughal rulers was shifted from Agra to Delhi Red Fort.\n\nShahjahan's Expansion of the Mughal Empire\n\nAs soon as he took over the Mughal throne, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan first conquered Ahmednagar and annexed it to the Mughal Empire in the year 1633 AD. During this, Shah Jahan also took the last Nizamshahi Sultan Hussain Shah hostage in the Gwalior Fort, which ended the Nizamshahi dynasty.\n\nShahji Bhonsle was earlier in the service of Ahmednagar, but after the merger of Ahmednagar with the Mughal Empire, Shahji had to accept the service of Bijapur. After annexing Ahmednagar to the empire, Shah Jahan had made a treaty with Bijapur and Golconda according to certain conditions, some of which are as follows –\n\nThe name of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was included on the coins and The ruler of Golconda will marry one of his daughters to Shahzada Mohammed, the grandson of Shah Jahan and the son of Aurangzeb.\n\nMuhammad Sayyid (a famous merchant of Persia) was the wise Wazir of Golconda and he got angry and went to the service of the Mughals. And then he gifted the Kohinoor diamond to the Mir Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. It was in the time Shahjahan Golconda emerged as the world’s largest diamond seller.\n\nIn 1636 AD, the fifth Mughal emperor Shah Jahan attacked Bijapur’s ruler Adilshah for not accepting the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire and forced him to make a treaty. According to the terms of the treaty, Sultan Adilshah promised to pay 20 rupees every year as tax. Apart from this, not troubling Golconda and Shahaji Bhonsle was also included in the terms of the treaty.\n\nAfter forcibly making a treaty, Shah Jahan appointed his son Aurangzeb as the royal representative of South India and Aurangabad was made the capital of the territories conquered by the Mughals in the south. Aurangzeb was made the ruler of Gujarat in the year 1645.\n\nIn the time of Jahangir, the fort of Kandahar came out of the possession of the Mughals, but due to the diplomatic policies of Shah Jahan, the fort again came under the Mughals in 1639 AD.\n\nThe Mughals had given the Portuguese the monopoly of the salt trade, but the Portuguese were not deterred from their antics, and the influence of the Portuguese was increasing, to eliminate that, in 1632, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan attacked the major trading centres of the Portuguese. Hooghly was captured.\n\nShah Jahan was only 16 years old when he fell in love with Mumtaz Mahal. They met in the weekly market held every Friday in the Royal Palace. Where women from noble families set up stalls for the pleasure of their male buyers from the royal families. Shah Jahan then known as Prince Khurram stoped before a stall where a young girl was selling crude sugar crystals.\n\nThe prince asked the price for a piece. The young girl flirtatiously asked an astronomical amount. Without surprise prince paid up in gold coins. Seeing that prince mistake the sugar piece for a diamond, the girl started laughing and her face was uncovered. Mesmerized by her beauty he vowed to make her his bride. So, their love story began.\n\nIn 1612, Khurram alias Shah Jahan married his love Arjumand Bano Begum (Mumtaz Mahal), the daughter of Asaf Khan. Out of many wives, Mumtaz Begum was his dearest wife. Shah Jahan was impressed by her beauty and conferred her with the title of “Malika-e-Zamani” and changed her name from Arjumand Bano Begum to Mumtaz, which means – the most precious jewel of the palace!\n\nIt is said that Shah Jahan loved Mumtaz so much that he could not stay away from her so he used to take her with him on every expedition, not only that he also did every work of his kingdom with her advice. According to many historians, No royal orders were issued without Mumtaz’s seal.\n\nIn 1631, just 3 years after the coronation of Emperor Shah Jahan, She died while giving birth to his 14th child, Shah Jahan was very broken by the death of his beloved wife. It is also said that after the death of Mumtaz, the emperor kept mourning for about two years and gave up all his hobbies, neither did he wear royal clothes nor did he attend the royal procession.\n\nShah Jahan’s love for architecture and Mumtaj Mahal was the reason for the construction of the Taj Mahal, the best monument of the Mughals one of the seven wonders of the world. Built using white marble to keep his love forever immortal also considered as a symbol of the unmatched love of both of them.\n\nIt took about 22 years for the construction of the Taj Mahal. the construction work of the main tomb of Mumtaz Begum was completed in the year 1643, it took 11 more years to build the gardens and the rest of the complex was completed by the year 1653. Many ancient, Mughal, Turkish, Islamic and Indian arts have been included in the making of the Taj Mahal.\n\n20 thousand labourers were used to build this grand historic building, these labourers worked under the leadership of Mughal craftsman Ustad Ahmad Lahori. World best artisans, embroidery workers, jewellers and stone cutters were involved in the construction. It was like a grand city is being built.\n\nShahjahan - Muntaj's Immortal Love Story and The Taj\n\nShahjahan's Life as a Prisoner and his Death\n\nAccording to historians, out of 14 children of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, only 7 children survived, out of which 4 were sons and 3 daughters. The four sons of Shah Jahan, Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Aurangzeb, Murad Baksh, did not get along at all, because they all wanted to sit on the Mughal throne, the war of succession between the four started in the year 1657 itself.\n\nShah Jahan wanted his son Dara Shikoh to sit on the Mughal throne after him as he was the most intelligent, educated, civilized, sensible and kind-hearted among the four sons, but Aurangzeb, in his desire to get his father’s power, to such an extent It fell that he took his father Shah Jahan hostage.\n\nAccording to historians, Shah Jahan was imprisoned in the Agra Fort in the year 1658 by the cruel son Aurangzeb. For about 8 years, Shah Jahan spent like a prisoner in the Shahburj of this fort. His eldest daughter Jahanara had served him by staying close to his royal house arrest.\n\nFrom January 31, 1666, this great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan said goodbye to this world. His mortal body was buried near the tomb of his wife Mumtaz Mahal in the Taj Mahal and after his death, his son Aurangzeb sat on the Mughal throne by deceit.\n\nThus ,the great ruler of the Mughal Empire Shah Jahan died but even today he is still remembered for making the Taj Mahal and giving the example of his and Mumtaz’s love."
