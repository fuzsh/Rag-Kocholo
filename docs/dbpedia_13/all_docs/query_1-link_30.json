        "text": "After reading through several of the items and reading the obelisks scattered through the desert, I’ve attempted to put together what I believe is a rough order of events for the desert. We don’t have a lot of precise dates to work with, but the events are largely hemmed in by two major events, the death of the moons sisters (Staff of Scarlet Sands) and the founding of Aaru Village (Primal Obelisk at the entrance to the Mausoleum of King Deshret.) I’ve put a TLDR version followed by a more detailed account with sources.\n\nA brief order of events in the Desert:\n\nThe Goddess of Flowers comes into being\n\nThe Moon Sisters perish\n\nKing Deshret comes into being\n\nKing Deshret and the Goddess of Flowers, create Ay-Khanoum, a splendid city in the desert.\n\nGreater Lord Rukkhadevata joins the Goddess of Flowers and King Deshtret in Ay-Khanoum.\n\nA celestial nail is dropped on Ay-Khanoum, killing the Goddess of Flowers and scattering the people of the desert.\n\nA long period of warfare follows before the people are eventually gathered together again by King Deshret and Rukkhadevata.\n\nRukkhadevata leaves to establish the forest in western Sumeru. She creates the wall of Samial to keep out the sandstorms.\n\nWallowing in grief, King Deshret gives into the whispers of forbidden knowledge releasing the destruction of the withering upon the desert and his people.\n\nRukkhadevata comes to the desert to contain the withering. She is reduced to a child and King Deshret dies.\n\nThe people of the desert, once again, split into warring city-states. Various kings rise and fall. After the final desert dynasty of Zumurud fails, the people of the desert swear off mortal kings and found Aaru village.\n\nDetailed timeline:\n\nThe Staff of Scarlet Sands recounts the Goddess of Flowers telling him how there used to be three moons, which suggests that the Goddess of Flowers lived in the era of the Moon sisters while King Deshret did not.\n\nThe Oasis Garden’s Mourning tells us that Ay-Khanoum was built by the Scarlet King and the Goddess of Flowers.\n\nThe Scroll of Streaming Song tells a tale that appears to be the meeting between the Goddess of Flowers and Great Lord Rukkhadevata. While almost certainly mythical in nature, taken in conjunction with the Oasis Garden’s Mourning, it suggests that Rukkhadevata joined GoF and Deshret after they had founded Ay-Khanoum.\n\nA celestial nail fell upon Ay-Khanoum, killing the Goddess of Flowers and scattering the people across the desert.\n\nThis we have to piece together from a few different sources.\n\nIt’s likely the case that the Goddess of Flowers died in the event that destroyed Ay-Khanoum. So the event was catastrophic in nature. I believe the line “At that time, the promised land of \"Valivija\" was engulfed by wild, gilded sands, and one of the three living gods had fallen,” at the start of Volume 2 of The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin refers to this. It also matches the lines “The first divine pillar descended from the skies, burying tree and meadow under the flowing sands.\n\nThe golden sun fell, then rose again, clothing the sea of sand in an opulent death-shroud,” found on the helm from the Gilded Dreams artifact set.\n\nWe’re also told in the Oasis Garden’s Mourning that the Goddess of Flowers died “due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand.” The Honey Final Feast from the Gilded Dreams sets also tells us “The gentle moonlight sank into the quicksand. The sun shrouded all things in its fearsome gaze.” I believe the sun here is Celestia (recall how the murals at Dragonspine depict Celestia as the sun). Finally, the Dreaming Steelbloom states “The kingdom of flowers would be ground down into a mere tale by sandstorms, becoming a dream in a song.”\n\nAlso note, “But as the Lord of Flowers faded in the darkening sandstorm, so was the worriless golden paradise submerged by death” on the Dream of Scorching Might.\n\nI believe the tornado north of the desert is likely Ay-Khanoum. The land there is similar in nature to the chasm, and we also know that celestial nails tend to cause one element to run amok.\n\nThe people were scattered and a century of Conflict followed (Volume 2 of The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin)\n\nEventually, the two remaining god-kings gathered the people back together. The Olden Days of Scorching Might suggests that King Deshret and Rukkhadevata started out together, before Rukkhadevata left to create the forest, splitting into two separate civilizations. King Deshret in the desert, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata in a great jungle of her own making to the east. Volume 2 of The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin also suggests that they initially gathered everyone together in a single civilization.\n\nKing Deshret sought to create a world bound by more precise rules than those of the original world that, and in that way, prevent the return of the “poison” that had led to the destruction of the original world. However, in his grief over the loss of the Goddess of Flowers, King Deshret himself would fall prey to that very poison. Heeding the words of one of his advisors, King Deshret constructed a great labyrinth and began to research the secrets of life and death. Eventually, King Deshret would bring the poison of forbidden knowledge to his kingdom, unleashing the withering upon his people, driving many to madness. (Staff of Scarlet Sands)\n\nIn this time of great need, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata would come to the rescue. She instructed the priests to build great temples, which would help purify the land. Expending a great deal of her power, Rukkhadevata would heal the land, and drive back the poisonous forbidden knowledge. However, the forbidden knowledge remained in the land, and King Deshret would sacrifice himself to curtail its spread. (Lost Legacies in the Sand). Despite the cutscene stating that King Deshret would sacrifice himself after Rukkhadevata’s intervention, I believe this may be incorrect. The Lay of Al-Ahmar provides an alternate account of his demise that says he died upon reviving the forbidden knowledge and the he “separated his mind form his flesh and bones” and “Thus did the minds of millions merge into one.” This seems fantastical at first, but does match with the Golden Dream, which we know from the Dreams Beneath the Searing Sands world quest and the Gilded Dreams artifact set was very much a real thing.\n\nThe beginning of the age of conflict:\n\nI believe the tale of the city of Gurabed as told in The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin, if it’s true, takes place here as I will explain below. In short, the king of Gurabed, Ormazd Shah, wed a spirit, Liloufar and had a child Shirin. He took as an adoptive son a warrior, Kisra, who would subdue the various tribe and kingdoms of the desert for him. Shirin would eventually convince Kisra to murder her father and all her siblings so that he could take the throne himself, thus fulfilling part of a prophecy from Liloufar. Afraid of his son, Shiruyeh, for another part of the prophecy, Kisra would banish Shiruyeh. Shirin would eventually find Shiruyeh and convince him to murder Kisra and take the through. Anguished by his ill deeds, Shiruyeh would cause a plague to be unleashed upon Gabard killing many. The tale says that Gurabed was destroyed and swallowed by the sands. An major issue here is that we have other documentation of the destruction of Gurabed that are more reliable than this mythical tale. I suggest to you that Gurabed was destroyed more than once. It was destroyed and lost as told in the Tale of Shiruyeh and Shrin, and eventually refounded, only to be destroyed again later.\n\nThe Primal Obelisks:\n\nHere is likely where the Obelisks come into play. There are 10 Obelisks, 7 of which fit together to tell the tale of the downfall of King Saleb Dowleh and the subsequent Zumurud Dynasty. One Obelisk, the one found at the entrance to the Mausoleum of King Deshret, clearly serves as the final end point to this history. That leaves us with two that are hard to place, the one found in the East Underground 1 of the Mausoleum of King Deshret and the one found beneath it. I believe that they can fit in either one of two places, they come first and describe an era of chaos that preceded the rise of King Saleb Dowleh, or they come after the 7 that fit together and the final obelisk and describe an era of chaos between the fall of the Zumurud Dynasty and the establishment of Aaru Village.\n\nI suggest the following order for the Obelisks. I’ve divided them into the groups mentioned above.\n\nMausoleum of King Deshret, East Underground 1\n\nMausoleum of King Deshredt, Beneath\n\nMausoleum of King Deshret East\n\nMausoleum of King Deshret North\n\nMausoleum of King Deshret Underground 2\n\nDuat Hall\n\nValley of Dahri\n\nSobek Oasis\n\nKhaj-Nisut\n\nMausoleum of King Deshret Entrance\n\nMausoleum East Underground 1 and Beneath:\n\nThese two record a chaotic period of conquest and various attempts to rule the desert collective. Underground East 1 opens by referencing the destruction of Gurabed, which I believe may reference the destruction depicted in the Tale of Shiruyeh and Shrin. The Obelisk makes reference to the absence of Al-Ahmar, which suggests that this took place after his death. The obelisks details the building of seven towers creating the Cities of the Seven Towers. Each city was ruled by a king and Ramshahr was made the King of Kings. It lists three of those cities, Tulaytullah, Saleh, and Ay-Khanoum. This last one is very curious, as we know that’s the name of the city ruled by the three god-kings. I’m not really sure how to explain this other than they decided to name this city in honor of the one that was lost. Garshasp was the ruler of this Ay-Khanoum. For reasons that will become clear in a moment, I believe that Ramshar rebuilt Gurabed to serve as his capital. What better way to cement your authority as King of Kings than by reclaiming an ancient lost capital? Beneath opens with a line of a King predicting his death and the chaos to follow. It speaks of Shah Ramshahr’s death and the chaos to follow. His son Artaxir took the throne but died shortly thereafter. Minister Turan Khagan took control as a regent, but was killed by a princess of Shah Ramshar and Humayn Gurkan. The princess married Humayn Gurkan who became king. Gurkan was later killed in a Jinn uprising, and the kingdom fractured into warring fiefdoms. Order was restored by Garshap, who defeated the warring “kings”. He abandoned Gurabed to establish a capital elsewhere, likely Ay-Khanoum as that was where he ruled. (Note that Gurabed has reappeared despite note of its destruction above. This is why I think Ramshar rebuilt the city). Garshasp fell and the capital burned for seven days. The people fled to Tulaytullah, the Sapphire city. (This would explain by this new Ay-Khanoum drops out of recorded history here).\n\nMausoleum East, North, Easter Underground 2, Duat Hall, Valley of Dahri, Sobek Oasis, Khaj-Nisut:\n\nMausoleum East picks up the story in the midst of a conflict between Goudarz and who appears to be his younger brother. Goudarz was under assault in the city of Tulaytullah by rebels (presumably supporting his brother), when a great mirage appeared and helped Goudarz in driving off the rebels. Upon hearing the news, Goudarz 'younger brother fled from Gurabed in fear of his older brother. Goudarz set out from Tulaytullah and entered into Gurabed as the victor and bringing the war to a close. The obelisk refers to Gurabed as a place where “the winds of lamentation had long howled,” which I believe is a reference to it’s long and bloddy history, including the Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin. He took the name Saleb Dowleh and said that Al-Ahmar himself had appeared before him and given him an illusion (presumably the mirage that helped him secure victory). King Saleb Dowleh would embark on a series of public works constructing statues of Al-Ahmar across the Cities of the Seven Towers. A decade of peace and prosperity would follow where King Saleb Dowleh would even make peace with the City of Twenty Nine Deys.\n\nMausoleum North:\n\nThis Obelisks records the rise of Muzzafar Dey, overlord of the great harbor-city, Orghana. Orghana was known as the city of Twenty Nine Deys, for the 29 pirate lords who rule over it in an alliance. (Dialog Farahnaz). It’s unclear how accurate Farahnaz’s tale of a sea beat wiping out the 29 day is, but it is clear that such an alliance existed. It appears that at some point after the city made peace with King Saleb Dowleh, Muzzafar rose to power over the other dey. The Obelisks refers to him as “kin-uncle to the beasts of the sea”, so perhaps this is where the legend of the sea beat began. The Obelisks details Muzzafar Dey’s conquests in neighboring lands, including the city of Beit Raha, where he slew the master of the city, Nasrul, only to install his daughter as the ruler.\n\nMausoleum East:\n\nThe first part of this Obelisks is defaced, but appears to tell a tale of conflict during the later reign of Saleb Dowleh. It seems that someone, likely a relation (maybe his younger brother?), killed Saleb Dowleh son, setting off infighting. In the midst of this infighting, the aging king invited Muzaffer Day to Gurabed. (If I were to speculate as to why, I would guess that Saleb Dowleh that Saleb Dowleh recognized Muzaffar’s power based on his rise in Orghana and subsequent conquests. Thinking back to the treaty he had with the City of Twenty Nine Deys, he hoped to use Muzaffar’s power to settle his internal conflict.) We can assume the defaced name is indeed King Saleb Dowleh based on added text. However, Muzaffar did not come peacefully to Gurabed, but instead pillaged his away to the city, prompting Saleb Dowleh to ally with his younger brother (probably the one that fled in the previous obelisk) to repel Muzaffar. It was too late though, and Muzaffar put Saleb Dowleh and all his relations to the sword. Muzaffar did not stay to rule, but abandoned the burning city of Gurabed to build his city elsewhere. However, before he left, he appears to have left his son, Zumurud, to rule. Here, Gurabed is referred to as “The city of ill omen,” again, I believe, a reference to its troubled history starting with the Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin. For reasons that will become clear later, I believe Zumurud set up his dynasty in Tulaytullah.\n\nDuat Hall:\n\nThis Obelisk tells the tale of a dream had by Verdant Lord Zumurud “a child of Muzaffar the Day Malik: in the second year of his rule. This indicates that Zumurud was the son of Muzaffar, apparently left to rule the desert after Muzaffar’s conquest above. The dream seems to be a vision of a great desert kingdom under his rule. The Obelisk notes that Zumurud was from the forest and didn’t speak the language of the desert. This is likely why he was called “Verdant Lord.” This also suggests that Muzaffar is also from the forest then, and that adds credence to the idea that Orghana and Port Ormos may indeed be the same.\n\nValley of Dahri:\n\nMuzaffar told Zumurud to leave many heirs, so as not to leave a power vacuum similar to the one after King Saleb Dowleh’s passing, a decision that would come to bring its own misfortune on the Kingdom. (This does sound a bit revisionist in his history vis-a-vis what happened with Saleb Dowleh). Zumurud would have many children. Notably, Muzzudin noted for his wisdom and Badanah, noted for his might, both born of the same mother. The Obelisk also makes mention of the princess Hanzada Sultan. At this point in history, it seems Zumurud’s dynasty was making an effort to incorporate the history of the desert people, as it notes Zumurud’s realm was as indestructible as the Mausoleum of King Deshret.\n\nSobke Oasis:\n\nIt appears that following Zumurud’s death, Badanah rose to power. The obelisk praises Badanah’s ability as king and how he’s able to see through the scheme of Muzzudin. It goes on to say that Badanah brought the ninety-nine kingdoms under one ruler once more. This suggests that after Zumurud’s death, his children broke into squalbing fiefdoms before being united under Badanah.\n\nKah-Nisut:\n\nThis Obelisk begins with the line “The tower that caused the death of the previous king Badanah has been destroyed.” His rule was followed by that of Faramarz, who was underaged and needed regents. It appears that power was actually in the hands of Makhaira, the queen regent of Tulaytullah (this is why I believe that Zumurud established Tulaytullah as the capital). According to Makhaira Aquamarine, Makhaira was a dancer and concubine to the king. She conspired with one of the princes to kill the king, and install the prince as ruler, thus becoming queen herself. The sword notes that she failed to become queen in the end.\n\nIt’s a bit hard to reconcile the weapons story with what’s recorded on the obelisk. Faramarz was forced to abdicate to his uncle, Balash, “master of Tulaytullah”. Faramarz’s other uncle, Goraz, would raise an army to restore Faramarz to the throne, and Goraz and Makhaira would rule as co-regents. However, Goraz then went on to wed Makhaira and claim the throne for himself, exiling Faramarz in the process.\n\nIf I was going to make a guess as to how to reconcile the two sources, I would guess that the “Tyrant” in the sword’s story was Goraz and the Prince was Faramarz. I know this sounds crazy as Makhaira was queen regent, but some other sources match up, as I’ll detail at the end.\n\nThis led to a rebellion by the nobles of Tulatullah, who sought revenge for the death of Balash. Makhaira appears to have then murdered Goraz, as she handed his head over to the rebels. King Faramarz was, once again, welcome back. This was short lived, as the city of Saleh then rebelled which led to an all out battle for the throne. This conflict was eventually settled with Faramarz being restored to the throne yet again, only to be overthrown a final time by the slave-warrior and city dwellers. This time Faramarz was exiled to the forest.\n\nMausoleum Entrance:\n\nThis final obelisk records the end of the sad tale of incessant war in the Cities of Seven Towers. The writer appears to be educated, so likely raised in a time of stability, but has fallen on hard times. The author notes that the vast lands have given rise to many who would dare to be king, and yet no one person managed to rule it all. They make reference to the fall of Gurabed, and how all that followed was conflict. The author mentions that their king is in exile in the forest (no name was given here, but it would match Faramarz). Then the author swears off mortal kings, saying the people of the desert will leave behind the palaces of old and make a new home named Aaru Village, in honor of the ancient dream of the gods where they will await the return of Al-Ahmar.\n\nThe fate of Faramarz\n\nThe Lamp of the Lost from the Deepwood Memories set tells the tale of a lost prince of the desert who came to the forest The prince says, \"Father ascended the tower in pursuit of a falcon, and the ancient structure could not bear his great weight, casting him into the boiling quicksand\" which matches the text on the Khaj-Nisut Obelisk “The tower that caused the death of the previous king Badanah has been destroyed, and the hunting falcons were all buried alongside him.” This suggests that the prince in the lamp is indeed Faramarz.\n\nThe lamp also says, \"In those days, I too had someone to love. She longed to be queen, but did not concern herself with the identity of the one seated on the throne.\" (This matches Makhaira’s agenda, both on Makhaira’s Aquamarine and on the Khaj-Nisut Obelisk.\n\nHe goes on to say:\n\n\"And so it was that I lost my love. For my life and my seal, I closed her lips with a viper's kiss and buried her in quilts of sand.\" This matches Makhaira’s final fate as recorded in the Khaj-Nisu Obelisk, “...The war ended, and King Faramarz was returned to power once more... Queen Makhaira... viper’s deadly venom... passed on the third day…”\n\nThe lamp goes on to tell how the prince fled to the forest, hoping to conquer new lands there, but instead fell into a game of cat and mouse with the White Huntress. This is further detailed by the Wandering Evenstar (datamined information). It is also quote possible that Faramarz is the wanderer mentioned in Xiphos’ Moonlight (datamined information). All three weapons are form the same series.\n\nFinally, the three weapons, Makhaira’s Aquamarine, Wandering Evenstar, and Xiphos moonlight all have the same opening, “This story takes place thousands of years ago,” suggesting that the death of King Deshret, the intervention Rukkhadevata, and all the conflict that followed predates the calamity by millennia."
