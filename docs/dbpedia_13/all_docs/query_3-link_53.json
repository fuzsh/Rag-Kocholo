        "text": "Original translation of Sejarah Melayu by Dr John Leyden\n\nChapter 12 of 30\n\nTHERE is a country in the region of Kling, named Pahali, the raja of which was named Nizam al Mulc Akber Shah. He had adopted the religion of Islam and the institutions of the prophet Muhammed. He had three children, two sons and one daughter, the elder of which was named Mani Farendan, the next Raja Akber Mulc Padshah, and the youngest was a daughter.\n\nThe ancient Prince Raja Nizam al Mulc Akber Shah died, and was succeeded by his son Raja Akber Mulc Padshah, and his inheritance was divided by law among his three children, excepting a golden chess-board set with gems, the one-half of the squares consisting of red gems, and the other of green ones, which Mani Farendan proposed to his brother should be given to their sister, as it was not proper for them to use it. To this the young raja refused to assent, proposing that a proper value should be put upon it, and that she should have it if she chose to give that price.\n\nMani Farendan was vexed at his refusal, and said in his heart, \" if he will not agree to do this, at my request, what else will happen when any other thing occurs. If this is to be the case, let me forthwith set about taking myself off, since I am not the raja of this country. But where shall I go then; it will be best for me to proceed to Malaca, for at this time the raja of Malaca is a great raja, and it is proper for me to pay my respects to him. Besides he is descended lineally from the family of Raja Secander Zulkarneini.\n\nHe did so accordingly; how many vessels then did Prince Mani Farendan prepare, with which he sailed for Malaca? But, when he arrived at Jambu Ayer, the wind arose, and a violent storm succeeded, and the ship of Mani Farendan sunk, and he having fallen into the sea, leapt upon an albicore, or alu-alu fish (great barracuda), by which he was conveyed to land. When he reached the shore, he caught hold of a ganda-suli tree, and in this manner reached the land.\n\nThis is the reason that Mani Farendan forbade all his descendants to eat of the fish alu-alu, or to wear the flower of the ganda-suli. Then Mani Faredan proceeded to Pasei, the raja of which gave him in marriage the Princess his daughter; and it is from his offspring, that all the royal family of Pasei are descended. Long did he reside in Pasei, till at last he returned to the land of Kling.\n\nWhen the monsoon arrived, he again set sail for Malaca, with all his ammunition and army, and the captain of his host was Khojah Ali Tendar Muhammed. He carried along with him seven vessels.\n\nWhen he reached Malaca, he went and paid his respects to Sultan Muhammed Shah, who gave him a favourable reception, and seated him along with the mantris. Sri Naradi Raja invited him to his own house, and gave him in marriage his daughter Tun Rana Sanduri. The Prince Mani Farendan had by his wife, the daughter of Sri Naradi Raja, two children; the name of the eldest, who was a son, was Tun Ali. The youngest was a daughter, and named Tun Uti; and she was extremely beautiful, and when she grew up, she was married to Sultan Muhammed Shah, and produced a son named Raja Kasim.\n\nAfter this, the Sultan married the daughter of the raja of Racan, by whom he had a son named Raja Ibrahim, whom he appointed his successor, according to the desire of the Princess his spouse. Sultan Muhammed Shah was nevertheless strongly attached to his son Raja Kasim, but he was ashamed to oppose the wishes of the Princess, and whatever Raja Ibrahim did, he was obliged to bear with it; but if Raja Kasim were to take so much as a bit of betel leaf from anybody, the raja was enraged with him.\n\nIn fine, Raja Kasim was distinguished by excellent manners and conduct, and all the subjects were well affected to him, and detested Raja Ibrahim.\n\nWhen the raja of Racan visited Malaca, he was treated with the highest respect, being twin-brother to the Princess, and this raja of Racan was the grandson of Sultan Sidi, who was the brother of Sultan Sejap. Whenever the raja of Racan arrived, the royal drums were beat through the whole town.\n\nThus it is said by the poets: \"All the royal drums are beating, The raja of Racan is entering into the presence, What can be secret with respect to the great, Long I wot has my love-longing lasted, Like a ring which has been set with a gem‚Äî\" After a long period, Sultan Muhammed Shah died, and was succeeded in the throne by his son, Raja Ibrahim, who on his accession to the throne, assumed the name of Sultan Abu Shehed.\n\nThe raja of Racan ruled Malaca as the deputy of Sultan Abu Shahed, and the country was completely subjected to his authority. He expelled Raja Kasim, who went and resided in the house of a fisherman, and for a long period plied the trade of a fisher at sea. Thus the raja of Racan reigned in Malaca as raja because Sultan Abu Shahed was the son of his twin sister.\n\nAt last, however, all the chief men, and all the mantris and hulubalangs, assembled for consultation at the house of the bandahara; and they said, \"What a situation is this into which we have got; at present the raja of Racan appears to be our sovereign and not our natural lord.\" Then the bandahara said, \"What resource have I left, for the raja of Racan is never separate from our lord.\" When they heard this speech, all the great men sat silent, and then broke up and went to their own houses.\n\nSri Vija di Raja, however, reflected in his own mind what was to be done; he had been constantly in the habit of inviting Raja Kasim to his house to eat and drink, because his brother had been bandahara to Raja Kasim.\n\nAfter a long period, there came a vessel from the regions above the wind, and when it drew near the land, all the fishing prows and boats approached to sell fish to the people of the vessel. Among the rest came Raja Kasim to sell his fish, in the dress of a fisherman. There was a merchant in the ship named Moulana Jelal-ed-din, who as soon as he saw Raja Kasim, called him on board the vessel and treated him with all the dignity due to his rank.\n\nRaja Kasim said, \" Why do you pay respect to me, a poor fisherman selling my fish? \" Moulana Jelal-ed-din replied, \"Of a truth, you are the son of this country, and will certainly become raja of Malaca.\" Raja Kasim said, \"What way will your slave become raja? To be sure, if your Moulanaship (reverence) grant me your blessing, I may become raja.\" \"Then,\" said Moulana Jelal-ed-din,\" please to go to land and seek a person who will accomplish your business, and if it please God it will be accomplished. But I have to request you to grant me one condition.\n\nGive me in marriage Putri Racan, the Princess of Racan, and mother of Sultan Abu Shahed.\"Raja Kasim said, \"Very well, if I become raja.\"The Moulana said, \"Proceed then quickly to the land, for this night shall your business be accomplished. God Almighty is with you.\"\n\nRaja Kasim went immediately ashore, and reflected on the speech of the Moulana, and said to himself, \"Of whom will it be proper to demand assistance. If so, I had better go to Sri Naradi Raja, for he has always been very kind to me, and see if he will assist me.\"According to this idea, he proceeded to Sri Naradi Raja, and related to him the whole of his conversation with the Moulana. He replied, \"Very well, I will be with you.\"A strict agreement was then entered into, and Sri Naradi Raja prepared himself, and summoned all the great men who had formerly assembled at the house of the bandahara, and all others.\n\nAt the time of the meeting of day and night, Raja Kasim mounted an elephant named Juru Damang, and Sri Naradi Raja mounted on the neck of it, and Moulana Jelal-ed-din sat with him on the elephant, and all the crew of the vessel landed with their arms. Then said Raja Kasim to Sri Naradi Raja, \"What resource has your Honour if the bandahara should not join us, we shall not be able to accomplish the affair; if we send for him just now, would he come?\" Sri Naradi Raja replied \" This matter is perfectly easy, let us go and call on the bandahara.\" Raja Kasim said \"Very well, I will willingly submit myself to your direction.\"\n\nThen they proceeded directly to the house of the bandahara. When they came to the outer gate of the bandahara, Sri Naradi Raja cried out \" Quickly inform the bandahara, that His Majesty the Prince is standing waiting without the gate.\" The bandahara started up, and ran with all possible haste, and came out without his creese, and his turban half loose; and the night was extremely dark and black. As soon as the bandahara came before the elephant, Sri Naradi Raja made it kneel down, and the bandahara speedily mounted, and the elephant rose, and they proceeded.\n\nThe bandahara then perceived that it was Raja Kasim and not Sultan Aba Shahed, and that the weapons were not numerous by their sparkling. Then he was grievously astonished, and Sri Naradi Raja said to him, \" What has your Honour to say to the business. The truth is that Raja Kasim means to slay this raja of Racan ;\"but the bandahara was still unable to answer.\n\nAt last he answered \"I am very glad of it too, for Raja Kasim is likewise my lord. Why did you not inform me of it before, that he was desirous to slay the raja of Racan, for I have likewise been considering how the matter might be accomplished.\" Raja Kasim was very glad to hear this.\n\nThe Prince immediately attempted to storm the palace, and all who saw him were struck with a panic, and all the great men who were with Raja Ibrahim, ran to the house of the bandahara with all the men of property and the heroes, and enquired where is the bandahara, and they received for answer, that the bandahara was gone with Raja Kasim ; and all the great men immediately took it for granted, that this was the doing of the bandahara. All the people then rushed away to find the bandahara, and all of them joined Raja Kasim.\n\nAfter they had made good their entrance, the raja of Racan would not separate himself from Sultan Abu Shahed, Then cried Sri Naradi Raja to the people, \"Take away Sultan Abu Shahed from the Racan Raja, for I fear that Raja Racan will kill him,\"and then they all called out, do not stab Raja Racan first, but the soldiers could not hear from the great tumult, and besides, there were many persons who were enraged at him, and they accordingly stabbed him through and through, and would listen to nothing. As soon as he felt himself wounded, he stabbed Sultan Abu Shahed, and the young Prince immediately died.\n\nThe period of this Sultan's reign was one year and five months. Thus he perished, and was succeeded by his brother Raja Kasim, who on his accession to the throne, assumed the name of Raja Mudhafer Shah.\n\nThen Moulana Jelal-ed-din asked him to fulfil his engagement; and the raja, having selected one of the female attendants of the palace, who was extremely beautiful, dressed her in superb garments, and presented her to the Moulana as the Putri Racan, or Princess of Racan. The Moulana supposed her to be the Princess of Racan, and having speedily conveyed her on board, set sail for the regions above the wind.\n\nThen Sultan Mudhafer Shah exercised the rule of authority, and became celebrated for his justice and clemency, and the attention with which he investigated the grievances of his subjects. He ordered the book of institutes, or \"Kitab Undang-Undang,\"to be compiled, that the laws might not be perverted by his chief officers, or mantris. Sri Nara al di Raja was beloved by the raja, who never dissented from anything which he ever proposed or indicated.\n\nSultan Mudhafer Shah espoused the daughter of the bandahara Sri Amir al di Raja, by whom he had a son of great beauty, who was named Raja Abdalla. The bandahara Sri Amir al di Raja died in process, and was succeeded by his son Tun Parapati Sedang in his office, and assumed the name of Sriwa Raja, but in reality he was only bandahara in name, for the king never in any instance opposed the opinion of Sri Nara al di Raja.\n\nIt happened on a certain day that Sultan Mudhafer Shah held a levee in his hall of audience, and as he was about to retire, the bandahara arrived, and came to the outer gate as the raja entered the palace. The raja did not know of his arrival, and the people shutting the gates, the bandahara Sriwa Raja supposed the raja to be angry with him, from his being prohibited entrance. The bandahara returned home oppressed with shame, and swallowed poison.\n\nThe raja received the information of his death, and was greatly distressed, as he did not know the cause of it, but Tun Indra Sugara related to him the whole of the circumstances regarding it. The raja, greatly concerned, proceeded to order his funeral according to the ordinary custom.\n\nAfter the burial of the bandahara, for the space of seven days, on account of the mourning, the royal drums did not beat. Sri Nari al di Raja now became bandahara. The deceased bandahara, Sriwa Raja, left three children ; the eldest was a daughter, named Tun Cudu; she was extremely beautiful, and became wife to the raja. The next was a son, named Tun Perak: the youngest was also a son, named Tun Parapati Puti.\n\nTun Perak did not enjoy any office: he went to be married at Calang, and settled in Calang entirely. After some time the people of Calang expelled their head man, and came to Malaca to ask another: Sultan Mudhafer Shah asked them whom they wished; they replied, that the Sultan would particularly gratify them by appointing Tun Perak to the office; he answered very well, and Tun Perak became the chief of Calang."
