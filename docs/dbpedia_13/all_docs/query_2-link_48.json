        "text": "Ahmad Shah is honoured for his bravery, skill, and success as a war leader as well as for his piety and his justice.\n\nNew Delhi: The undying legacy of Ahmad Shah I lies in the fact that he is credited to be the one who founded Ahmedabad. He was the grandson of Sultan Muzaffar Shah and the ruler of the Muzaffarid Dynasty who reigned over the Gujarat Sultanate from 1411 until his death in 1442. He was born in 1389, to Muhammad Shah I alias Tatar Khan who was a son of Muzaffar Shah I. Muhammad Shah I was probably killed by his uncle Shams Khan in favour of his father Muzaffar Shah when he imprisoned him. The ‘Mirat-i-Ahmadi’ states that in 1410, Muzaffar abdicated the throne in favour of his grandson Ahmad Shah due to his failing health and died five months and 13 days later.\n\nAccording to Mirat-i-Sikandari, Ahmad Shah was going on an expedition to quell the rebellion of Kolis of Ashawal. After leaving Patan, he convened an assembly of Ulemas and asked a question should he take retribution for his father’s unjust death? Ulemas replied in favour and he got the written answers. He returned to Patan. Ahmad Shah ascended to the throne in 1411.\n\nThe ruler who established Ahmedabad\n\nThe immediate challenge that Ahmad Shah faced after becoming the ruler was the rebellion of his cousin Moid-ud-din Firuz Khan. Then one day, while camping on the banks of the Sabarmati river, Ahmad saw a hare chasing a dog, which interested him. He asked his spiritual adviser for an explanation and got the answer that the land possesses unique characteristics which nurtured such rare qualities which turned a timid hare to chase a ferocious dog.\n\nAhmad, who was looking for a place to build his new capital was impressed and laid the foundation of the city at the site of Asawal on February 26, 1411, at Manek Burj. He chose it as the new capital on March 4, 1411. He named it Ahmedabad in honour of four Ahmads: Himself, his religious teacher Shaikh Ahmad Khattu Ganj Baksh, and two others, Kazi Ahmad and Malik Ahmad. The new capital was surrounded by the Bhadra Fort. He built Ahmad Shah’s Mosque and Jama Mosque (1424) in Ahmedabad.\n\nAhmad Shah as the Sultan\n\nDuring 1414, Moid-ud-din Firuz Khan and Masti Khan again revolted, but Ahmad Shah once again managed to subdue their rebellion. Later, he attacked Sorath and won a pitched battle at Vanthali in 1413. He imposed the siege of Junagadh in 1414. Ahmad Shah, though unable to capture the hill, gained the fortified citadel of Junagaá¸�h. In 1420-21, he started building and repairing forts and establishing military outposts to strengthen the state from attacks.\n\nIn December 1421, he advanced against Malwa and took the fort of Mesar. He attacked and received tributes from other border states before he reached Mandu in March 1422. He spent the next two years without any wars and focused on administration and agriculture development. But he set out on expeditions in 1425 and spent the rest of his life in battles and campaigns. He died in 1442, at the age of 53, and after ruling for 33 years. He was buried in the mausoleum, Badshah no Hajiro, near Manek Chowk, Ahmedabad.\n\nAhmad Shah is honoured for his bravery, skill, and success as a war leader as well as for his piety and his justice. His piety showed itself in his respect for three great religious teachers: Sheikh Rukn-ud-din, the representative of Sheikh Moinuddin Chishti, the great Khwajah of Ajmer; Sheikh Ahmed Khattu who is buried at Sarkhej Roza, Ahmedabad; and the Bukharan Sheikh Burhan-ud-din known as Kutbi Alam the father of the more famous Shah Alam."
