HORDE of the WHITE SHEEP. 118\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis document shows the Arab and Turkish rulers in western Asia and north Africa, from about the 11th century. The earlier Arab rulers and caliphs, who claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, are shown in the separate document WEST ASIA & NORTH AFRICA (1). The Mongol states established after the Mongol invasion of the early to mid-13th century are set out in the separate document MONGOLS.\n\nTurkestan in Central Asia was ruled by the Persian dynasty of the Samanids in the 10th century. Mahmud the Ghaznavid, who died in 1030, displaced the Samanids in the early 11th century. His successors were displaced by the Seljuks. The Turkmen moved westward, and settled in what is now Turkey. The different Turkmen and Arab peoples which are dealt with in this document are introduced separately in the chapters below.\n\nThe chronicle of Abu'l-Feda, also known as Bar Hebræus , was written in the early 14th century. Its author was a junior member of the Ayubite dynasty which provided rulers of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Syria from the mid-12th century until the Mongol conquest in the 13th century. It provides a broad outline of the history of all these territories, but with particular emphasis on the Ayubites. The Kamel-Altevarykh Chronicle was written at Djezirat Ibn Omara, a town on the right bank of the river Tigris about 100 kilometres north-west of Mosul. The author was Abu'l-Hassan Ali, son of Abu'l-Karim Mohammed Athir ed-Din es-Cheibani el-Djezeri, who received the title Eizz ed-Din, and is sometimes referred to as Ibn-Alatyr. He wrote towards the end of the first quarter of the 13th century. Its coverage is broadly similar but it includes more detail on the lives of the atabeg rulers of Mosul, and less on the Ayubid dynasty. It includes particulars of some marriages which are not mentioned in Abul-Feda. The versions of these sources which have been consulted are the French translations included in the 19th century compilation Receuil des historiens des croisades, one difficulty with which is that they translate no material dealing with events before the end of the 11th century. In addition, in some cases parts of the works have been omitted. The omissions are indicated in the Arabic original texts (but not in the French translations) although it is not possible to see how much has been omitted.\n\nChapter 1. EARLY TURKIC TRIBES from CENTRAL ASIA\n\nA. KHAZARS\n\nThe Khazars were a confederation of Hunnic and Turkic tribes formed around the 6th century. The Khazar dynasty, the Ansa (Chinese: Nu-she-pi), was probably the same as the Ansina, the dynasty of western Turks. The Khazar great chief (Khagan) was a prince delegate (Yabgu) of the Turkish dynasty. The Khazars were autonomous from [630] after a civil war with other tribes, including those which were ancestors of the Bulgarian state and those linked to the tribe of Attila and his descendants. The Khagans power declined with time. By the 9th century, the real chief was his subordonate, the beg or shad. One of these beg, general Bulan, son of a Jewish woman, seized the throne by 850 and converted his people to Judaism and was ancestor of the later Jewish dynasty.\n\nTwo siblings:\n\n1.ZIEBEL [Jebu/Tung] . Son of the Turkish khagan. He was Khagan in 618 when Emperor Heraclius promised him his daughter Eudocia.\n\n2. ---. One child:\n\na)SHAD . First counsellor of his uncle Ziebel. He devastated Georgia in 626/628.\n\n1.IBI-SHEGI . Khagan in 650.\n\n1.BIHEROS [Bouzeros] . Khagan of the Khazars. Two children:\n\na)CHICHEK (-[750/6 Jun 751], bur Constantinople, Church of the Holy Apostles) . Theophanes records the marriage of \"Leo imperator Constantino filio suo\" and \"filiam Chagani Scytharum principis\" and that she was baptised as EIRENE . The primary source which confirms her original name and the name of her father has not yet been identified. This marriage was arranged by Emperor Leon III to confirm his alliance with the Khazars against their common enemy the Arabs . Emperor Konstantinos VII's De Ceremoniis Aulæ records that \"Irene uxor Constantini Caballini\" was buried in the church of the Holy Apostles . m ([731/32]) as his first wife, KONSTANTINOS, son of Emperor LEON III & his wife Maria --- (Jul 718-14 Sep 775, bur Constantinople, Church of the Holy Apostles). He was crowned co-Emperor by his father at Easter 720. He succeeded his father 741 as Emperor KONSTANTINOS V.\n\nb)BARDJIK .\n\n2.BAGATHUR . One child:\n\na) daughter . m YAZID, Armenian ruler.\n\nB. PECHENEGS\n\nThe Pechenegs originally inhabited the steppes to the east of the River Volga north of the Caspian and Aral Seas. Their name is derived from the Old Turkic Bečenek, diminutive of the personal name Beče . Their migration westward was triggered by Emir Ismail ibn-Ahmed, Samanid ruler of Bokhara, who began a campaign against his Turkic steppe neighbours in 893 . Pecheneg attacks on the Magyar tribes living to the east of the Carpathian basin, described in detail by Emperor Konstantinos VII , resulted in the Magyars migrating to Transylvania and the Pechenegs settling in their original lands north of the Black Sea. They formed themselves into a federation of hordes, possibly under some form of central leadership although this was not sufficiently strong for a stable, hereditary central authority to emerge . The Pechenegs were defeated by a Byzantine/Kuman army in 1091 at Mount Levunion and fell under Kuman suzerainty . The Pechenegs who settled in Hungary eventually assimilated with the local population.\n\n1.THONUZOBA [Disznó-apa/Pig-father] (-after [955/70]). Recorded in the 13th century Gesta Hungarorum as \"a knight from one of the leading clans\" who \"came from the land of the Pechenegs from whom the Tomaj [Thomoy] clan is descended. Prince Taksony gave him dwelling-land in the parts of the Kemej up to the River Tisza where the village of Abád-rév stands\" . One child:\n\na)URCUND . Son of Thonuzoba, according to the Gesta Hungarorum, he was baptised into Christianity .\n\nC. KUMANS\n\nThe Kumans or Kipchaks originated near the great eastern bend in the Yellow River. Their name \"Kuman\" meaning \"pale yellow\" in Turkic, they became known as the \"yellow people\" (polovtsy, in Russian). They moved west when the Ch'itans invaded China from Mongolia in [986] . By the mid-11th century they were living in the area north of the Caspian sea, and in the early 1200s on the northwest side of the Black Sea, at the mouth of the Danube . In 1091 the Kumans, led by Bönek [Boniak] Khan and Tugorkan, allied themselves with the Byzantines to rout the Pechenegs, who thereafter fell under Kuman suzerainty . In the first half of the 12th century, the Kuman federation split into branches living to the east and west of the River Dnieper, reunited by Könchek Khan at the end of the century. Although Könchek Khan was succeeded by his son, and strove to reinforce his dynastic position by matrimonial alliances with the Russian principalities, there was no movement towards a state organisation . Like the Pechenegs, the Kumans were bound by clan and tribal loyalties, within the central authority. Mongol attacks on the Kumans started after 1219 under Jenghiz Khan. The Kuman people were baptised in 1227 by Róbert Archbishop of Esztergom in a mass baptism in Moldavia on the orders of Bortz Khan, who swore allegiance to András II King of Hungary . The names of Kuman chiefs at that time were: Zeyhan, Arbuz, Turtel, Kemenche, Alpra, Tolun. Very few other names of the Kuman leaders are recorded in the primary sources which have so far been consulted in the compilation of the present document. Numerous examples of marriages into the families of the rulers of the Rurikid principalities are found (see the document RUSSIA, RURIKID), but in only isolated cases is the name of the bride´s father recorded.\n\n1.KUTHEN [Köten] Khan of the Kumans (-murdered [1240/41]). He negotiated a protective alliance with his son-in-law Prince Mstislav of Galich against the Mongols, but their forces were crushed at the River Kalka 16 Jun 1223 . He defeated the Mongols near the Black Sea in [1229], he and his followers took refuge in Hungary after the battle of the Volga in 1239, entering through the Radna Pass . The Kuman presence caused internal resentment in Hungary which culminated in the murder of Khan Kuthen in the royal palace at Pest by a group of Hungarian and German soldiers . After this the Kumans left Hungary, raiding neighbouring countries as they went. King Béla IV later recalled them to Hungary and settled them on empty land either side of the River Tisza, the agreement being sealed by the marriage of his son and heir to a Kuman princess .\n\na) daughter . m MSTISLAV Mstislavich \"Udaloy\" Prince of Galich, son of MSTISLAV Rostislavich \"Khrabriy/the Brave\" & his first wife --- Iaroslavna of Kiev (before 1176-1228).\n\n1. --- Khan of the Kumans . His name is not known, but he was probably elected Khan by the Kumans who left Hungary in [1241] after the murder of Kuthen Khan. He was baptised in 1254 at the Dominican monastery in Buda .\n\na) daughter (1240-after 1290) . Her marriage was agreed as part of King Béla's arrangements for settling the Kumans on empty land on either side of the River Tisza . She was baptised with the name ELISABETH. Regent for her son King László IV 1272, she was hated by the Hungarians . m (1253) ISTVÁN of Hungary, son of BÉLA IV King of Hungary & his wife Maria Laskarina of Nikaia (18 Oct 1239-1 Aug 1272, Csepel Island, Dominican Monastery). He succeeded his father in 1270 as ISTVÁN V King of Hungary.\n\nChapter 2. ASIA MINOR (11th-13th CENTURIES)\n\nThe Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan defeated the Byzantine forces of Emperor Romanos IV at Manzikert in 1071 and invaded Asia Minor.\n\nA. DANIŞMEND\n\nThe origins of the principality of Danişmend are not known but a source dated to [1095] names Danişmend, otherwise known as Tailu . Abul-Feda names \"Gumichtikin Ibn Tilou Ibn ed-Danichmend\" as sovereign of \"Malatiya\", commenting that \"danichmend\" was Turkish for schoolmaster, the occupation of his father . The principality was established in central Asia Minor, between Sivas and Cappadocia, in opposition to the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.\n\n1.TAILU [Danişmend] (-[24 Feb 1104/22 Feb 1105]). Vardan's History records that \"Danishman lord of Sebastia, whom they say was of Armenian nationality, came against Melitene\" in 1100 and captured \"Pemond and Rajard who were at Edessa [and] who came against him\" , presumably referring to Bohemond I Prince of Antioch and Richard of the Principate (later regent of Edessa).

On meeting Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, who was visiting Konya while returning from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1173, the Sultan greeted him as a blood relation, declaring himself descended from a high-born German lady . No details of this supposed descent are known. However, it reminds one of the reports relating to the fate of Ida, widow of Luitpold II Markgraf of Austria, who disappeared after the army with which she was travelling was scattered after being defeated by the Turks near Tarsus in Asia Minor in [Sep] 1101 (see the document AUSTRIA). Albert of Aix says that the fate of Ida is completely unknown, but adds that \"some say that she was taken into permanent exile in the kingdom of Khorazan among the thousand women who were taken\" . According to later legend, Ida ended her days in a harem where she gave birth to the Muslim hero Zengi (which is chronologically impossible): the Historia Welforum records that \"Itam comitissam, matrem Leopaldi marchionis orientalis\" was kidnapped by \"unus de principibus Sarracenorum ex eaque Sanguinem illum sceleratissumum, ut aiunt, progenuit\" .

She was the daughter of a Greek priest . She married secondly Shams al-Din al-Isfahani, who ensured that her son succeeded his father . Shukurov records that her second husband was in 1249 arrested and executed by his political adversaries . Shukurov records that Sultan Kay Kawus II, in his exile in Byzantium, was accompanied by his mother [...Προδουλία-Barduliya], wife, four sons (Masud, Kayumarth, Constantine Melik, and one unnamed), a daughter, his sister (who was apparently unmarried) and...his two maternal uncles Kir Khaya and Kir Kadid/Kattidios . Shukurov records two versions of her fate (1) she committed suicide, having heard a false rumour of her sons death she threw herself from a tower or (2) she was transferred from Constantinople to Berroia where she remained until her death, commenting that (2) seems more plausible since other members of the sultans family were also sent to Berroia . m secondly ---.

He succeeded his father in 1256 as KAY KAWUS II Seljuk Sultan of Rum, jointly with his two half-brothers . The Seljuk Sultanate started paying fixed tribute to the Mongols during the early part of his reign . He fled to Byzantine territory after his half-brother was proclaimed as sole sultan . Eventually a treaty of partition was agreed, imposed by the Mongols, (maybe in 1257) between Kay Kawus and his half-brother Kilic Arslan, under which the latter was granted the eastern provinces with Sivas, Kayseri and Sinop, while the former ruled the remaining Seljuk territory . Sultan Kay Kawus was imprisoned by Emperor Mikhael VIII in 1261, liberated by Mongol troops, but left for Crimea where he lived in exile . Shukurov, placing a different emphasis on events, says that Sultan Kay Kawus II fled to the court of Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1262 and stayed in the Byzantine empire [...in Ainos in Thrace] until 1264/65, adding that at first, his relations with the emperor...were friendly...[but] later for some reason tensions appeared, when Kay Kawus hatched a plot to depose the emperor and, after Bulgarians and Tatars jointly attacked the empire in the winter of 1264/65, joined the Tatars and fled to the Golden Horde . Shukurov provides precise details of Byzantine, Turk, Persian and other primary sources on which this summary is based . Abul-Feda records that a Tartar army freed \"Eizz ed-Din Cai-Cous, fils de Cai-Khosrou\" in A.H. 668 (1269/70) and transported him and his family to the court of \"Mancotimur\", from whom he received a wife, and died in A.H. 677 (1278/79) .

If this suggested origin of the sultans wife is correct, she must have been the emperors illegitimate daughter as his [first] wife was recorded as unable to bear further children after the birth of her son (see the document NIKAIA). m ---, a Mongol.

DESCENDANTS of the SELJUKID SULTANS in BYZANTIUM\n\nShukurov discusses two separate families living in Byzantium who were descended from the Seljukid Sultans.\n\n1. --- [Athanasios Soultanos] ([before 1250]-before Jun 1324). He is named as deceased in a chrysobull of Emperor Andronikos II dated Jun 1324 which records that pansebastos sebastos Theodore Sarantenos had before that date founded the monastery of St. John the Prodromos in Berroia and had requested exemption from taxes over property inherited from his late father-in-law Soultanos . He is named Athanasios o Soultanos in the testament of his son-in-law Theodoros Sarantenos dated Oct 1325 . Shukurov cites sources speculating that he was a brother or son of...Kay Kawus II but concludes that the reasons to doubt this identification are serious (in particular he demonstrates the chronological impossibility of Athanasios being the son of Kay Kawus II, in light of his probable marriage date). He suggests that Athanasios could have in fact been one of the sons of Sultan Kay Qubadh I (from a chronological point of view) . Presumably Athanasios was his baptismal name after converting to Orthodoxy, but Shukurov makes no mention of his possible previous Turkish name. As noted above in Part B of the present Chapter, Rüdt-Collenberg names Shems ed-Din as son of Sultan Kay Qubadh I or of his brother Sultan Kay Kawus I and ancestor of the family of Sultanoi-Palaiologoi . He appears to have confused the two Soultanoi families in Byzantium, the second of which is discussed below. No source has been found which names Shems ed-Din and, unless any such source emerges, there appears no basis to speculate that he was the person who was later baptised Athanasios. Athanasioss precise birth date is difficult to determine. Given the estimated date of his marriage, and the Byzantine custom of noble men marrying at 16/17 years of age, it is probable that he was born before [1250]. Shukurov indicates that the documents in which he is named state that he had possessed the land inherited by his son-in-law for eighty years (the Jun 1324 document) and eighty and more years (the 1325 testament) . If correct, these statements would indicate his presence in Byzantium many years before the arrival of Sultan Kay Kawus II (estimated to 1262, see above Part B) and his birth before [1230] at the latest. The consequent longevity of Athanasius indicated by these periods suggests that they were exaggerated, although Shukurov does indicate reports of an earlier unnamed Seljuk sultan sending family members as hostages to Emperor Ioannes III Vatatzes in the early 1240s when Anatolian Turks were sent to the Balkans . m (before [1265/67]) ---. The name of her daughter suggests that Athanasioss wife was related to the Byzantine imperial families. As noted above, Rüdt-Collenberg names Shems ed-Din as son of Sultan Kay Qubadh I or of his brother Sultan Kay Kawus I, and adds that he married a sister of Michael VIII Palaiologos . Such a person has not otherwise been traced. The chronology for a sister of Emperor Mikhael VIII, whose birth is estimated to [1224/25], being the wife of Athanasios is not ideal. Shukurov cites other secondary sources which speculate that Athanasius wife was an unknown sister of Michael Palaiologos . The date of her marriage is indicated by the suggested birth date of her daughter. Athanasios & his wife had one child:\n\na)EVDOKIA Doukaina Angelina Komnene ([1265/67]-after Oct 1325). Her parentage and marriage are indicated by a chrysobull of Emperor Andronikos II dated Jun 1324 which records that pansebastos sebastos Theodore Sarantenos had before that date founded the monastery of St. John the Prodromos in Berroia and had requested exemption from taxes over property inherited from his late father-in-law Soultanos . She is named Eudokia Doukaina Angelina Komnene in the testament of her husband Theodoros Sarantenos dated Oct 1325, the date of her marriage being indicated by the testator recorded holding his father-in-laws lands for 46 years . m ([1279]) THEODOROS Sarantenos, son of --- (-after Oct 1325).\n\n1. --- [Soultan] . Shukurov traces a second Soultanos noble family descended from Soultan who was mentioned by Manuel Philes as the father of Dimitrios Soultanos Palaiologos...and his elder brother Alexios Soultanos Palaiologos (end 13th century) and who married Palaiologina Komnene, the sister of the protohierakarios Demetrios Palaiologos . Their precise relationship with the family of the Seljukid sultans is impossible to determine. Shukurov goes no further than saying that they were descendants of a close relative of Kay Kawus II...who moved to Byzantium with him in 1262. The precise chronology of his life is difficult to establish. m --- Palaiologina Komnene, daughter of ---. Shukurov traces a second Soultanos noble family descended from Soultan who was mentioned by Manuel Philes as the father of Dimitrios Soultanos Palaiologos...and his elder brother Alexios Soultanos Palaiologos (end 13th century) and who married Palaiologina Komnene, the sister of the protohierakarios Demetrios Palaiologos . Soultan & his wife had two children:\n\na)ALEXIOS Soultanos Palaiologos (-1344).

Shukurov says that Oriental sources name Ghiyath al-Din Masud, Rukn al-Din Kayumarth, Rukn al-Din Qilic Arslan, Siyawush, Faramarz, and two other sons who remained in Byzantium as the seven sons of Sultan Kay Kawus II . Shukurov records that Sultan Kay Kawus II, in his exile in Byzantium, was accompanied by his mother, wife, four sons (Masud, Kayumarth, Constantine Melik, and one unnamed), a daughter, his sister (who was apparently unmarried) and...his two maternal uncles Kir Khaya and Kir Kadid/Kattidios, adding that Konstantinos Melik was sebastokrator or caesar (?), governor of Berroia (?), governor of Pegai in Mysia and providing some details of his later life as a Christian .\n\nm ---.

Shukurov names Ioannes Melikis landholder in Serres 1323-26 and another Melik whose baptismal name is unknown, adding that they possibly belonged to the lineage of Constantine Melek and suggesting that the chronology is consistent for Ioannes to have been Konstantinoss son .]\n\n2. [ASTRAPIRES Melikis (-after [1338/43]).

ASIA MINOR (14th-16th CENTURIES)\n\nA series of small principalities emerged in Asia Minor from the mid-13th to early 14th centuries, established by Turkish invaders who took advantage of the weakening of both the Byzantine empire and the Seljuk state. The early campaigns of the Turks against the Byzantines in Asia Minor during the reign of Emperor Andronikos II in the early 14th century, which eventually led to the dismemberment of the empire and the establishment of the Ottoman dynasty, are recounted by Pachymeres, who notes that superiores...regiones Bythiniæ, Mysiaæque, Phrygiæ...ac Lydiæ et...Asiæ were devastated by the Amurii et Atmanes, Atinæ, Alisyræ, Mantachiæ, Salampaxides et Alaides et Ameramanæ et Lamisæ, Sphondilæ...et Pagdinæ . The names of these eleven Turkish leaders are difficult to recognise in this hellenised form: with the help of an article by Failler (who dates the passage to 1303) , an attempt has been made in the present Chapter to identify some of them, although many of the leaders are not known in other sources. The Anatolian principalities were studied in detail by Professor Uzunçarşili in 1969 . His work (in Turkish) cites numerous primary sources, dealing with each individual ruler of each principality in turn. It gives the impression of reliability but is unaccessible due to the language barrier. Outline information from his genealogical tables has been included in the present Chapter.\n\nA. KARAMAN\n\nThe Karamanid principality came into being after the arrival of the Mongols in the western Taurus . The family of Karaman invaded Cilicia in south-eastern Anatolia and in [1308] captured Konya. They were driven out by Ulajtu Ilkhan of Persia whose military help had been solicited by Emperor Andronikos II to deal with the growing Turkish threat in Asia Minor. After the death of Ulajtu in 1316, Karaman developed into a formidable power . The Karamanids reoccupied Konya in 1327. The town of Karaman in present-day south central Turkey, capital of Karaman province, is named after the dynasty.\n\n1.KERIMÜDDIN KARAMAN (-[1260/80]). Three children:\n\na)MEHMED BEY (-1283 or before). Uzunçarşili records Mehmed Bey as son of Kerimüddin Karaman . He possessed Eremenel and Mut in the Cilician and Isaurian Taurus, and added Lârende on the interior plateau and Alanya on the coast .\n\nb)MAHMUD Bey . Uzunçarşili records Mahmud Bey as son of Kerimüddin Karaman . Mahmud had one child:\n\ni)MUSA . Uzunçarşili records Musa as son of Mahmed Bey . He occupied Konya in the early 14th century .\n\nc)GÜNERI BEY . Uzunçarşili records Güneri Bey as brother of Mahmud Bey .\n\nUzunçarşili reconstructs family relationships between the following group . It has not yet proved possible to verify this information.\n\n1.ALA ud-DIN SHUJA ud-DIN HALIL MIRZA BEY . Emir of Karaman. One child:\n\n2.Damad ALA ud-DIN ALI [I] BEY (-killed Oct 1397) .

Emir of Karaman. m INJU, daughter of Sultan MOHAMMED I .\n\n4.Damad TAJ ud-DIN SARIM ud-DIN IBRAHIM [II] BEY (-16 Jul 1464) . Emir of Karaman. m (1426) ILALDI Khanum, daughter of Sultan MOHAMMED I (1412-1471).\n\n5.Damad ISA Bey (-1437) . m (1426) --- Khanum, daughter of Sultan MOHAMMED I (1413-).\n\n6.Damad BENGI ALA ud-DIN ALI [II] BEY . Amir of Karaman. m (1426) AISHA Khanum, daughter of Sultan MOHAMMED I (1414-1469).\n\nB. EŞREF\n\nThe Eşref or Eşrefoğullari established themselves to the west of the Karamanids in the province of Konya at Beyşehir, in the late 13th century. After the death of Mehmed in 1326, their territories were divided between the Karamanids and the Hamidoğullari .\n\n1.EŞREF . Eşref had one child:\n\na)SÜLEYMAN (-1302). Uzunçarşili records Süleyman as son of Eşref . He is named in an inscription over the fortress gate of Beyşehir, which was renamed Süleymanşehir . Süleyman had one child:\n\ni)MÜBARIZÜDDIN MEHMED BEY (-killed 1326). Uzunçarşili records Mübarizüddin Mehmed Bey as son of Süleyman . He extended his power over Akşehir and Bolvadin, and paid homage to Temür-Tash in 1314, but the latter revolted in 1326, captured Beyşehir and killed Mehmed .\n\nC. GERMIYAN\n\nThe Germiyanoğullari, a people probably of Kurdish descent, were brought by the Seljukid-Mongol government westwards from eastern Anatolia in [1275] . The emirate was founded at the end of the 13th century in Phrygia with its capital at Kütahya [Kotyaion]. The first emir was Ali Shir: Pachymeres records that superiores...regiones Bythiniæ, Mysiaæque, Phrygiæ...ac Lydiæ et...Asiæ were devastated by the Amurii et Atmanes, Atinæ, Alisyræ, Mantachiæ, Salampaxides et Alaides et Ameramanæ et Lamisæ, Sphondilæ...et Pagdinæ . It is assumed that Alisyræ refers to Ali Shir. He was called \"Karmanos Alisourios\" by Gregoras. The weakness of Germiyan was lack of access to the sea, and it declined with the rise of the new coastal emirates in Asia Minor .\n\n1.ALIŞIR . Emir of Germiyan.\n\n2.YAKUB [I] . Uzunçarşili records Yakub as great-grandson of Alişir . Emir of Germiyan.\n\n3.AMIR SÜLEYMAN SHAH BEY ADIL . Emir of Germiyan .\n\n4.Damad YAKUB [II] BEY (-Feb 1429) . Amir of Germiyan. m (after 1425) --- Khanum, daughter of Sultan MOHAMMED I .\n\n5.DAULAT SHAH (Kutahya 1365-Bursa 1414) . m (1378) as his third wife, Sultan BAYEZID I, son of Sultan MURAD I & his first wife Gülchichek (Bursa 1360-Akshahir 9 Mar 1403, bur Brusa Mausoleum).\n\nD. MENTEŞE\n\nMenteşe was a Ghazi warrior who migrated to south-west Asia Minor and established his emirate in the district of Karia in [1277/90] . Pachymeres records that superiores...regiones Bythiniæ, Mysiaæque, Phrygiæ...ac Lydiæ et...Asiæ were devastated by the Amurii et Atmanes, Atinæ, Alisyræ, Mantachiæ, Salampaxides et Alaides et Ameramanæ et Lamisæ, Sphondilæ...et Pagdinæ . It is assumed that Mantachiæ refers to Menteşe. After taking to the sea as pirates, they attacked Rhodos in [1300], although their power was curtailed in 1308 when the island was seized by the Knights of St John . This was the smallest and least known of the minor emirates which emerged after the fall of the Seljuk Sultanate. No other information has so far been found about Menteşe and his successors. It is assumed that his emirate was subsumed into the emirate of Othman in the early 14th century. Uzunçarşili records an outline genealogy of ten generations of the family of rulers of Menteşe . His information has not been verified.\n\n1.MENTEŞE (-after [1300]).\n\nE. AYDIN\n\nAydin was originally a vassal of the emirate of Germiyan, but his sons (known as the \"Aydinoglou\") captured Ephesos in Oct 1304 in alliance with Sasa Beg, a relative of Menteşe, and eventually established their capital at Smyrna . Pachymeres records that superiores...regiones Bythiniæ, Mysiaæque, Phrygiæ...ac Lydiæ et...Asiæ were devastated by the Amurii et Atmanes, Atinæ, Alisyræ, Mantachiæ, Salampaxides et Alaides et Ameramanæ et Lamisæ, Sphondilæ...et Pagdinæ . It is assumed that Atinæ refers to Aydin. Uzunçarşili records an outline genealogy of six generations of the family of rulers of Aydin . His information has not been verified.\n\n1.AYDIN .\n\n2.MEHMED BEG AYDINOGLOU . He killed his former ally Sasa Beg in 1308 and proclaimed the independence of the emirate of Aydin from Germiyan. He captured the citadel of Smyrna in [1317] and carried out raids along the Aegean coast against the Zaccaria family of Chios and the Knights of St John at Rhodos . Emperor Andronikos III negotiated a peace agreement with the emirate of Aydin in 1329 .\n\n3.UMUR Beg (-killed in battle Smyrna 1348). He completed the conquest of Smyrna from the Latins in 1329 . Umur attacked the Venetian island of Negroponte and the Greek mainland in 1333 . In 1335, a further agreement with Emperor Andronikos III was negotiated and Umur provided military support for the recapture of the island of Lesbos from the Genoese Domenico Cattaneo . He intervened in the civil war in Byzantium which followed the death of Emperor Andronikos, supporting Ioannes Kantakuzenos . The league of western powers, sponsored by Pope Clement VI, destroyed his fleet in Oct 1344 and seized the harbour of Smyrna. He was killed defending the city against a final attack . Umur Beg's exploits were celebrated in the epic poem The Destan by the Turkish poet Enveri, written in the 1460s .\n\n4.FAKHR ud-DIN ISA BEY . Emir of Aydin.

SINOP\n\nThe emirate of Sinop lay on the Black Sea coast. It was led by Ghazi Chelebi and was famous for its piratical exploits. An outline genealogy of the Emirs of Sinop was published in 1948 by Mevlüd Oğuz in the context of his study (in Turkish) of Pasha Tadjeddin (see below) . Unfortunately, it has not proved possible to verify this outline due to the language difficulty, nor has it been possible to reconcile the outline with the information noted below.\n\n1. --- . Emir of Sinop. One child:\n\na)MEHMED BEG . Emir of Sinop. Mehmed had one child:\n\ni)MASUD MUAD ad-DIN SÜLEYMAN (-after 1296) . Emir of Sinop. m ([1268/69], consummated [1271/72] ) --- of Armenia, illegitimate daughter of LEO II King of Armenia & his mistress ---. Rüdt-Collenberg cites the Chronicle of Abul-Feda which records this marriage, dates its consummation to [1271/72], and her return to Armenia in 1278 . Masud had one child:\n\n(a)GAZI ÇELEBI . Emir of Sinop.\n\n1.OMAR (-after Dec 1361) . Emir of Chalybia. The Chronicle of Michael Panaretos records that \"we departed for Chalybia with the emperor to the castle-house of Chatzymyris, Baryam´s son\" 13 Dec 1361 and that \"from Chalybia we went by land to Kerasunt followed almost servilely by the emir Chatzymyris and some Turks\" . m firstly ---. m secondly (after 29 Aug 1358) THEODORA Komnene, illegitimate daughter of BASILEIOS Emperor in Trebizond & his second (bigamous) wife Eirene ---. The Chronicle of Michael Panaretos records that \"the daughter of the emperor lord Basil, the Lady Theodora\" left 29 Aug 1358 to be married to \"the emir Chatzymyris, Bayram´s son\" with \"lord Basil Choupakas Scholaris as the bridal escort\" . Omar & his [first] wife had one child:\n\na)SULEIMAN beg (-after 1397) . Emir of Chalybia. m MARIA Komnene, [illegitimate] daughter of ALEXIOS III Emperor at Trebizond & his [wife Theodora Komnene Kantakazune/concubine ---]. Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by the Chronicle of Michael Panaretos which records that \"the emperor´s son-in-law from Limnia the emir Taceddin\" set out 24 Oct 1386 \"against the emperor´s other son-in-law, the son of Chatzymeris from Chalybia, Suleiman Beg\" but was killed in battle in \"Chalybia\" . The primary source which confirms her name has not yet been identified.\n\n1. --- . Mevlüd Oğuz states that Tadjeddin was the son of Taceddin Doğanşah, who in turn was the son of er-Rifai zade Aläaddin Savei . As noted in the introduction to this section, it has not yet proved possible to verify this information. Oğuzs outline genealogy does not show Omar Emir of Chalybia, so does not confirm any family relationship with Tadjeddin. Uzunçarşili does not name the father of Tadjeddin in his outline genealogy of this family . One child:\n\na)TADJEDDIN Pasha of Sinop (-killed in battle 1386 after 24 Oct) . Mevlüd Oğuz states that Tadjeddin was the son of Taceddin Doğanşah . Uzunçarşili does not name the father of Tadjeddin in his outline genealogy of this family . Emir of Limnia. The Chronicle of Michael Panaretos records that \"the emperor´s son-in-law from Limnia the emir Taceddin\" set out 24 Oct 1386 \"against the emperor´s other son-in-law, the son of Chatzymeris from Chalybia, Suleiman Beg\" but was killed in battle in \"Chalybia\" . If that is correct, he was presumably killed fighting one of the emirs of Chalybia who are named above, the chronology suggesting Suleiman Beg as the likely possibility. m (8 Oct 1378) as her first husband, EVDOKIA Megala Komnene, daughter of ALEXIOS III Emperor at Trebizond & his wife Theodora Komnene Kantakazune. The Chronicle of Michael Panaretos records the marriage 8 Oct 1378 of \"the emperor his daughter the Lady Eudokia\" and \"çelebi Taceddin\" at \"Oinaion\" after which \"the emperor took over Limnia\" . She married secondly (1387) Konstantin Draga Lord of Vardar and Serres [Serbia]. Her second marriage is indicated by Georgius Phrantzes who names \"Eudocia despna, quæ avi tui uxor fuit\", which from the context appears to refer to the maternal grandfather of Emperor Konstantinos XI, commenting that she was previously \"Turcum coniuge parvæ et exilis regionis principem\" by whom she had children . Tadjeddin had four children:\n\ni) four sons . Mevlüd Oğuz names Tadjeddins four sons Mahmut Çelebi, Alparslan, Kiliçarslan, Süleyman Bey, together with two sons of Alparslan Hüsamettin Mehmet Yavuz Bey, Hüsametting Hasan Bey . Uzunçarşili names the two sons of Alp Arslan Hasan Bey, Mehmed Yavuz Bey . It has not yet proved possible to verify any of this information against primary sources. As noted above, Phrantzes records that Tadjeddin had children by Evdokia without providing any indication of their names or subsequent history . Insufficient information been found relating to the chronology of succeeding emirs of Limnia to ascertain whether any or all of these named sons of Tadjeddin were Evdokias children.\n\nI. OTTOMANS\n\nThe origins of Ertughrul are unknown. In the 14th and 15th centuries, elaborate descents were composed by court flatterers, from earlier Turkish heroes such as Oghuz Khan, founder of the Oghuz Turks, from Arab ancestors (though not the Prophet Mohammed's family, all of whose descendants were known), and even from a member of the Komnenos family of Byzantium who supposedly emigrated to Konya and converted to Islam . Pachymeres records that superiores...regiones Bythiniæ, Mysiaæque, Phrygiæ...ac Lydiæ et...Asiæ were devastated by the Amurii et Atmanes, Atinæ, Alisyræ, Mantachiæ, Salampaxides et Alaides et Ameramanæ et Lamisæ, Sphondilæ...et Pagdinæ . It is assumed that Atmanes refers to Osman, son of Ertughrul. The emirate founded by the first members of what was later known as the Ottoman dynasty was one of the smallest Ghazi emirates in Asia Minor.\n\nERTUGHRUL (-1281). Laonicus Chalcocondylas names \"Duzalpes Oguziorum dux\" as father of \"Oguzalpes\", and \"Orthogules\" as son of Oguzalpes . A Ghazi commander, he gathered a sufficient number of followers to found a small emirate in the border lands to the east of Bithynian Olympus . He is said to have commanded a band of Ghazi warriors in the service of the Seljuk Sultans and defeated a Byzantine/Mongol army in the district of Dorylaion [Eskishehir], which was granted to him as a fief by the Sultan in reward. According to later legend, he was officially named as successor to the last Seljuk Sultan .\n\nErtughrul had one child:\n\n1.OSMAN (-Nov 1326, bur Brusa ). Laonicus Chalcocondylas names \"Otamanus, Orthogulis filius\" . He established himself in the former Byzantine province of Bythinia. His territory attracted immigrants of other Turkish tribes, escaping the Mongol threat. He declared himself Sultan OTHMAN I at Karajahisar [Malagina] in the lower Sakarya valley . His title, according to the inscription on a mosque in Brusa, was \"Sultan, son of the Sultan of the Ghazis, Ghazi, son of Ghazis, Margrave of the horizons, hero of the world\" . He defeated the Byzantines at Baphaeum, between Nikaea and Nikomedia, in 1301, and began to settle his people north of Mount Olympus. He captured the fortress of Melangeia [Yenishehir] which became his base of operations . The Catalan Company defeated him near Leuke in 1305, but after their revolt against the Emperor, Othman took advantage of the civil war to consolidate his hold on land bordering the Sea of Marmara. He captured Ephesus, the last remaining Byzantine city on the Aegean coast, in 1308, but gave it to the Emir of Aydin. His forces captured Brusa 6 Apr 1326 and Lopadion in May 1326 , Brusa becoming the new capital. Sultan Othman I had three children:\n\na)ORKHAN (-Bursa Mar 1362, bur Bursa) .

In 1371 his forces defeated and killed Vukain King of Serbia at the battle of Marica, marking the start of serious Ottoman involvement in the Balkans. Emperor Ioannes V recognised Sultan Murad as his overlord in 1373, promising him an annual tribute and military aid when needed, and sending his son Manuel to the Sultan's court as a hostage. In 1377, the Ottomans acquired Adrianople, which had fallen to other Turkish forces in 1369 , Sultan Murad establishing his capital there in place of Brusa .
