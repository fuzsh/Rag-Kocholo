        "text": "We know Gujarat as one of the promising and developing states of India. Although future of the State looks great, if we were to look back, history of Gujarat is also fascinating. Many of us might not be aware about history of Gujarat sultanate or Gujarat sultans. Let’s take a brief look at these aspects so that we know where Gujarat has evolved from.\n\nMuhammad bin Tughluq’s cousin, Firuz Shah Tughlaq got married to the sister of Sadhu and Sadharan from Tanka Rajput family. Sadhu was converted and got a new name Samsher Khan while Sadharan became Wajih-ul-Mulk. In 1377, Malik Mufarrah and Rasti Khan were appointed as governor of Gujarat. This was a major turning point in the history of Gujarat sultanate. When Sikandar Khan tried to replace him, he was killed. Son of Wajih-ul-Mulk, Zafar Khan was appointed as governor of Gujarat in 1391. He defeated Malik Mufarrah in the battle of Kamboi and took control of Anhilwada Patan. After this point in the history of Gujarat, things started changing at a rapid pace.\n\nTatar Khan imprisoned his own father Zafar Khan in Ashawal in 1408. He became the Sultan and gave himself the title of Muhammad Shah I. Muhammad Shah was poisoned to death by his own relative when he was going towards Delhi. Muzaffar was released from the prison and declared himself as Sultan Muzaffar Shah I. He was succeeded by the son of Tatar Khan, Ahmad Shah I.\n\nAhmad Shah was considered to be one of the most successful rulers in the history of Gujarat Sultanate. He had to handle several internal rebellions apart from invasions by Nasir Khan belonging to the Farooqi dynasty ruler of Khandesh. Ahmad Shah led four wars against Malwa from 1419 to 1438. He was also known for taking over Thana and Mahim from Bahmani Sultanate. He also founded Ahmedabad and shifted his capital from Anhilwada Patan to Ahmedabad. He built the Jami Masjid in 1423. After Ahmad Shah’s death in 1443, Muhammad Shah II became the next sultan.\n\nThis was only the beginning of the history of Gujarat sultanate. There are many other interesting facts and events about the Sultans of Gujarat that should be explored in depth."
