        "text": "The sources for the early history of Malacca are so meagre, and often so contradictory, that not only is the detail in some doubt but the whole framework of events rests on an uncertain foundation. Dates ranging from the middle of the fifteenth century back to the eighth have at various times been proposed for the foundation of Malacca, and considerable uncertainty has surrounded both the identity and sequence of the early kings and the time and manner of their conversion to Islam. As a result of evidence which has come to light within the last thirty years, notably the Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires and a partially deciphered inscription, from Sumatra, the current view of the early history of Malacca differs materially from that which was generally held before the second world war. Whereas it was then believed that there were four kings before Sultan Muzaftar Shah and that two or three of them were severally converted to Islam, it is now held that there were only three kings and only one conversion, and that this took place in the reign of the first king, about the year 1414. In view of the nature of the evidence upon which this latest interpretation rests it will be useful to review the king-list and the question of the conversion in some detail.\n\n4. References to the Shellabear edition and the Raffles MS are to Shellabear, W.G., (editor), Sejarah Melayu (fifth edition, in Arabic script, Singapore 1924)Google Scholar and Winstedt, R. O. (editor), ‘The Malay Annals or the Sejarah Melayu’, JMBRAS. XVI, 3, 1938Google Scholar.\n\nThe relationship of the two versions is discussed by Winstedt (op.cit.,) and Dr. Emeis (Emeis, M.G., ‘Raffles MS No. 18’, Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, deel 105, 1949, pp. 461–70)Google Scholar. The view of both scholars that the Raffles MS is the more historically accurate is not supported by an examination of the chapters dealing with the events of the early reigns.\n\n28. The account which Pires gives substantiates the identification with Bhra Hyang Wicesa. Pires gives a garbled and incomplete list of Batara Tamaral's predecessors down to ‘Sam Agy Jaya Taton’. On the death of this ruler without male issue the people set up two chief ministers and made one of them king. This was ‘Sam Agy’, alias Batara Tamaral, who was succeeded by ‘Batara Curipan’, in whose reign “a quarter of the land of Java rose up in revolt and a mandarin rose up and called himself Biatara Caripanan” and “a quarter of the land of Java was lost”. After carrying the king-list down to the time of writing, Pires returns to the story of the expulsion of Parameswara by Batara Tamaral and the subsequent resumption of friendly relations between this king and the Malacca dynasty during the reigns of Parameswara, and Shah, Iskandar (Suma Oriental, vol. II, p. 230)Google Scholar.\n\n‘Sam Agy Jaya Taton’ apparently stands for Java-Katwang, the usurper who overthrew Krtanagara in 1292 and was in turn replaced by Krtanagara's son Krtarajasa in 1294 (see Graaf, H.J. de, ‘Tome Pires’ “Suma Oriental” en het tijdperk van godsdientsovergang op Java', Bijdragen tot de Taal—, Land — en Volkenkunde, deel 108, 1952, p. 136)CrossRefGoogle Scholar, but it is probable that the ruler meant is Jayanagara, the second Majapahit emperor who died without male issue and was succeeded by his sister Tribhuwana, whose husband and consort was Krtawardhana, (the second ‘chief minister’ is probably a reference to Gajah Mada, patih of Majapahit from 1331 to 1364), but this prince, who died in 1386, cannot have been the Batara Tamaral who expelled Parameswara and was still living in the time of Megat Iskandar Shah. This must have been Bhra Hyang Wicesa (Wikramawardhana), in whose reign the dynastic war occurred and who appears in the Suma Oriental as ‘Batara Curipan’ (Hyang Wicesa, like Krtawardhana, owed his position to marriage with the female heir, in this case the crown princess Kusumawardhana, daughter of Ayam Wuruk. See Schrieke, op. cit., p. 39)Google Scholar. ‘Batara Tamaral’ in fact appears to be a partial amalgamation of three rulers: Bhre Tumapel, the consort of Tribhuwana (1329–1350); the unmentioned Ayam Wuruk (1350–1389); and Bhra Hyang Wicesa (1389–1428), who is referred to in the Ming-shih as ‘king of Tumapel’ (Ming-shih, book 325. See Groeneveldt, , p. 36).Google Scholar\n\n34. The Raffles MS states that Parameswara ruled at Singapore for three years, founded Malacca two years after his expulsion from Singapore and ruled a further twenty years at Malacca (Raffles MS, ch. VI). Albuquerque gives five and seven years for the reigns at Singapore and Malacca (Commentaries, vol. III, pp. 74–77)Google Scholar and Pires gives five years for the reign at Singapore and six years as the time between the expulsion from Singapore and the foundation of Malacca (Suma Oriental, vol. II, p. 232)Google Scholar. Apart from the fact that they are contradictory, these figures cannot be taken literally, but within the context they indicate the passage of a number of years between the expulsion from Palembang and the founding of Malacca.\n\n45. The descent is traced explicitly through the kings of Palembang. According to the Malay Annals, Nila Utama, the first king of Singapore, from whom the descent of the Malacca dynasty is derived, was the son of Sang Sapurba, king of Palembang, whose descent is traced from Iskandar dzul-Karnain. A more immediately apparent claim to descent from Iskandar dzul-Karnain is implied in the descent from Iskandar Shah of Bentan, whose daughter Nila Utama is said to have married. This Iskandar Shah may well have been an historical figure. The Annals record the tradition that he went to the land of the Shams and was the first (Malay) ruler to use the nobat, the sacred kettle-drum which is the principal item of Malay regalia (Shellabear edition, ch. II; Raffles MS, ch. III).\n\n71. Couto gives Megat Iskandar Shah's name as Menamar (Couto, dec. IV, book II. ch. 1). An analogous case is the confusion concerning the successor to Sultan Mansur Shah. According to the Shellabear edition and the Bustan al-Salatin this was his on Raja Hussain (Shellabear edition, ch. XXIII; Bustan al-Salatin, ch. III), but the Raffles MS states that the succession went to another son, Raja Radin (Raffles MS ch. IX). It would appear that the author of the Raffles MS is mistaken and that the error arises from the confusion of Raja Radin with another prince, whose name is given as Raja Radin in the Bustan al-Salatin and Raja Ali in the Shellabear edition (Bustan al-Salatin, ch. III; Shellabear edition, ch. XXXIV), who succeeded the last Sultan of Malacca, Mahmud Shah, and who like Sultan Mansur Shah's successor took the regnal name Ala'u'd-din Riayat Shah."
