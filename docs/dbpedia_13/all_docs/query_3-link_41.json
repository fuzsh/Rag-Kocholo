This is a storybook that I illustrat-\n\ned for my GDI625 Contemporary Illustration project.\n\nThis storybook is based on the history of the first Sultan of Perak,\n\nSultan Muzaffar Shah I. As a Perak citizen myself, I am so proud that\n\nthe theme for this project is stories from my state hometown. As I\n\nillustrated this storybook, there are a lot of new discovery of Perak\n\norigins that I encountered during this project and as its citizen, I will\n\nabsolutely never forget about its history as the history is what makes\n\nPerak as it is right now.\n\nI hope that readers can enjoy this storybook whilst knowing about the\n\nbeginning of Perak Sultanate and its first Sultan, Sultan Muzaffar\n\nShah I as well as what the Sultan had to go through before he was\n\nenthroned as Perak Sultan.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCover\n\nEditorial Page\n\nCopyright Page\n\nBibliography\n\nTable of Contents\n\nStory Introduction\n\nStory\n\nBehind the Scene\n\nConclusion\n\nSTORY INTRODUCTION\n\n“Why does the Sultan in the water?”\n\nThe story begins with a question by a little girl which she just\n\nasked out of her curiosity. However, never did she know that her\n\ncuriosity will open the tale of a great legend from her hometown,\n\nPerak Darul Ridzuan.\n\nIt is the legendary tale of the first Sultan of Perak, Sultan Muzaffar\n\nShah and what he had to do for him to be the ruler of Perak and the\n\npioneer of the Perak Sultanate that will continue to thrive until\n\nthese days.\n\nBehind the Scene\n\nCHARACTER DESIGN\n\nCOMPILATION\n\nTengku Muzaffar Shah / Sultan Muzaffar Shah I\n\nThe second prince of the last Sultan of Malacca Sultanate, Sultan\n\nMahmud Shah. He is later send to Perak to become its new ruler\n\nand the pioneer of the Perak Sultanate.\n\nHawa\n\nA little girl who lives in Perak. One day, she followed her grandfather\n\nto Beting Beras Basah. There, she heard a legendary tale that will\n\nmake her could not forget what she saw that day.\n\nTok Khalid\n\nHawa’s grandfather. He has lived in Perak for decades and really loves to tell stories\n\nof Perak to his granddaughter. One day, he went to Beting Beras Basah with her and\n\nthere he told Hawa of the story about the first Sultan of Perak.\n\nTun Saban\n\nOne of the two envoys from Perak who was entrusted by the previous ruler,\n\nTok Masuka, to plead to Sultan Mahmud Shah for sending his prince to rule\n\nPerak after the death of its previous ruler, who died without a successor.\n\nNakhoda Kassim\n\nOne of the two envoys from Perak. As his title “Nakhoda’ depicted, he was the captain\n\nof the ship that they used to travel from Perak to Kampar and then back to Perak. He\n\nwas looked after by the previous ruler, Tok Masuka when she was still alive.\n\nDjinn\n\nThe djinn that resided Kuala Sungai Perak. Legend said that the djinn’s name is Dato\n\nMahkota Maharaja Si Raja Jin, which means that the djinn is the King of Djinn.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAs a proud citizen of one’s hometown, it is a must to know about the history\n\nof that place whether legends or folk tales as this is the very origin of the\n\nplace that we born and live. Without all the history and old tales as well as the\n\nsacrifices that our ancestors have made, we will never able to live peacefully\n\nlike today. For example, if Sultan Muzaffar Shah I did not threw away his\n\ncrown, he might not be able to reach Perak and there will be no Perak Darul\n\nRidzuan that we know nowadays.\n\nTherefore, it is important to appreciate history of places and important figures\n\nof states and country so that all of the past deeds, sacrifices and incidents that\n\noccured long time ago will still be remembered and remain in this world. The\n\nfuture generations can follow the good and avoid the bad from past stories\n\nand thus, will be able to have a life well-lived.\n\nGDI625 Contemporary Illustration\n\nAdibah Hazwani binti Khairol Anuar\n\n2020954169\n\nSubmitted to\n\nTs.
