        "text": "Before it was divided by border in 1909 the region spanning present-day southern Thailand and northern Malaysia was occupied by Theravada Buddhists and Muslims, in villages of Malay speakers and villages of \"Siamese\" speakers. This chapter aims to reconstruct the little-known history of the region through historical documents and oral traditions. Field research shows that many refugees from Pattani and Kedah migrated southward from the direction of Nakhon Si Thammarat to Kedah due to the Burmese army's attack on Ayutthaya in the late 18th century and the subsequent revival of the Siamese dynasty.\n\nKedah is old Islamic port-polity in the Malay Penunsula. And Its have tributary relation with Siam since 13th century. Kedah have influenced from Siam. By the census of 1911 shows large Malay population concentrating on the lowland along the sea shore . Capital of Sultans and old pondoks also stay this area. On the other, in inland (“bukit) of Kedah is not large number population, Inland of Kedah is the world of Thai speakers. Thai speakers are Thai-speaking Muslim(Samsam ) and Siamese. Till a half of 20th Century, they are close each other as Thai-speakers. Government of Kedah could not control this area completely. We can find many Thai temples in inland area. These temples and large numbers of Siamese population gather in a basin of river of Pendang. In old tradition, Siamese have migrated from South Siam, Phatthalung and etc. of Thai speaking Muslims and Siamese area. So, in traditional old Kedah, Sultan have grasped on the port and surrounding lowland of sea shore. And inland are the world of Thai-speaking migrants. Keyword : Kedah, Thai-speaker, Muslim, Samsam, Siamese, inland, migrants,\n\nThis is a study of the language situation in Kedah in late 19th century based on a corpus letters of Sultan Abdul Hamid Shah of Kedah written during the period. In order to achieve a holistic picture of the linguistic situation of Kedah during that period, a two-pronged approach is applied. One is a description of the multilingual situation in Kedah. The other is the Sultan’s own language choice as an individual and in carrying out his duty as ruler of the state.\n\nThe coming of Islam in the district of Dairi started form Barus and developed by people from Aceh(some of them are clerics)who one of them is Koser Maha. Among of the developers of Islam in Dairi is still a mystery of their existence,such as Teuku Panjang Rambut (a Royal Man from Aceh with long hair)who was able to change his being or performance,and he is still alive as it is believed by the local people. Although the majority of the population of Dairi are non-Muslims,the teachings of Islam, however, can be received by the society because there is are similarities between the teachings of Islam and the culture of the Pakpak (the indiginous inhabitants of Dairi). The spread of Islam in Dairi was done through relation of kinship, ethical examples, mysticism, and lah kanuragan (martial arts) and kesaktian (magical power).These methods were very different from the way the Dutch colonial when spreading Christianity in Dairi that is done through the genocidal extermination or ethnic cle..."
