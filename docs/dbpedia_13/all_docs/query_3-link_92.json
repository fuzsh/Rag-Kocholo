        "text": "Over the course of the turbulent history of eighteenth-century Iran, Nādir Shāh’s reign (r. 1736–1747) is to be regarded as an exceedingly significant turning point. Following the death of Nādir Shāh, succession struggles broke out, which lasted for several years and led to the disintegration of the vast empire and to the diminution of sovereignty of the Nādirid descendants. After the reign of ʽAlī Qulī Mīrzā and Ibrāhīm Mīrzā (1747–1749), the territory of the successor state decreased significantly and its internal functioning was based on a delicate equilibrium between the ruler Shāh Rukh (r. 1748–1750; 1750–1796) and the different tribal factions of Western Khurāsān. This article engages the events of the contest for power after the assassination of Nādir Shāh to explore the origin of this tribal resurgence and the precursors of the Nādirid successors’ loss of political weight in Iran.\n\nTaken from the Memoirs of Father Krusinski, Procurator of the Jesuits at Ispahan; Who Lived Twenty Years in That Country, Was Employ'd by the Bishop of Ispahan, in His Negotiations at the Persian Cour - Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski - Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski[a] (born 1675 – died 1756) was a Polish Jesuit who lived in the Safavid Empire from 1707 to 1725/1728. He acted as an intermediary between the Papacy and the Iranian court, and also functioned as a court translator. Proficient in Persian and well acquainted with the nation and its people, he was an inhabitant of the Safavid royal capital of Isfahan and a \"first-hand witness\" to the capture of the city by the rebellious Afghans in 1722. Krusinksi's accounts make him an important primary source on this particular period of the Safavid era.\n\nIslam in Iran temporarily break Iranian royalty pattern but soon the Arabs also were modeled and Iranian dynasties who came to power from the tenth century AD peak reached. Saffarids were one of dynasties that had prominent role in revival of Iranian royalty pattern. When Yaqoub came to power, a big territorial section of Iran was released from Abbasid's dominion. Yaqoub who dreamt about reestablishing the Iranian Royalty pattern undertook some of the royal functions and proved that he is capable of requirements them. He claimed that he belonged to ancient royal dynasties and acted the same by holding royal reverence. His effort to revival of Iranian royalty pattern caused a war with the Caliph. Therefore, he went to war with the Caliph but failed and returned to JondiShapour. Up to his last breath he wanted to take his revenge on Caliph but his life did not suffice. This article seeks with analytical method to Yaqoub attempts regarding the revival of Iranian royal pattern and the change in his inclination from regional to national manner of ruling and his relation with the caliph.\n\nThis article examines the progress of a series of ambassadorial visits to Europe during the reign of Shah Abbas I Safavi. The reign of Shah Abbas I (1587–1629) inaugurated a new chapter in Safavid–European relations. He opened his country to the world in unprecedented ways. Shah Abbas consolidated the state by securing the borders, establishing a central administration and bureaucracy, fortifying the economy and creating a standing army responsible not to the tribal heads, but to the Shah as the head of the state. Shah Abbas’s energetic foreign policy led him to send missions to Europe. Considerable diplomacy took place between Europe and Safavids Empire over diverting the silk trade away from the traditional Anatolian route and through the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless, Shah’s attitude towards the European ambassadors, travelers, merchants, or even priests was a major factor in the creation of many works about the reign of Shah Abbas. Close attention is paid to the ambassadors and their action in this article.\n\nTaken From The Memoirs Of Father Krusinski, Procurator Of The Jesuits At Ispahan (1733) - Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski - Judasz Tadeusz Krusinski[a] (born 1675 – died 1756) was a Polish Jesuit who lived in the Safavid Empire from 1707 to 1725/1728. He acted as an intermediary between the Papacy and the Iranian court, and also functioned as a court translator.

Krusinksi's accounts make him an important primary source on this particular period of the Safavid era.\n\nThis article analyzes a group of Ottoman inserts added to the Shahnama-i Shahi, the famous copy of Firdawsi’s Book of Kings made for the Safavid shah Tahmasp I. It is well known that this manuscript was given by Tahmasp to the Ottoman sultan Selim II in 1568 and remained in Istanbul for over three centuries, and yet almost no attention has been paid to this period of ownership. This neglect is all the more remarkable given the Ottomans’ own intense engagement with the book, for in 1800–01, Selim II’s namesake successor, Selim III, commissioned his chief gunkeeper, Mehmed ʿArif, to provide all 258 of the manuscript’s paintings with Ottoman-inscribed inserts. Most of these inserts were lost with Arthur Houghton’s dismemberment of the book, but forty-one of them are preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. While ostensibly intended as a Turkish abridgment of the Persian text, the inserts also provide an important record of how the Shahnama-i Shahi was received in its late Ottoman context. This in turn yields invaluable information on how illustrated manuscripts, as well as Firdawsi’s epic, were more generally viewed and understood in the Islamic world.\n\nThe historiography of Safavid prefaces the early years of Shah Ismail in the &quot;Afzal al-tavarikh&quot; and elsewhere the iconography of the &quot;Shah-nama-yi Shahi&quot; kinship ties between the Safavids and the Qizillbash Amirs in late 16th-century Iran - a case study of the political career of members of the Sharaf al-Din Ogli Tekelu family le &quot;Dar al-Saltana&quot; de Qazvin, deuxieme capitale des safavides sufis, dervishes and mullas - the controversy over spiritual and temporal dominion in 17th-century Iran Shii rituals and Power II - the consolidation of Safavid Shiism - folklore and popular religion Shah Abbas and pilgimage to Mashhad &quot;barrier of heterodoxy&quot;? - rethinking the ties between Iran and Persian during the Safavid period - sketch for an &quot;Etat de Langue&quot; similar farmans from the reign of Shah Safi the rise of the Julfa merchants in the late 16th century the Dutch and the Persian silk trade the character of the urbanization of Isfahan in t..."
