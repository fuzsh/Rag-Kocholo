        "text": "Every year, on a winter Sunday, some 200,000 Indians sit down to “Bell the CAT”. They are all eager to crack the Common Admission Test (CAT), which opens the doors to the six Indian Institutes of Management. But it’s no secret that the IIM everyone wants admission to is the one at Ahmedabad. It’s the one that The Economist Intelligence Unit rated as “the toughest business school in the world to get into.”\n\nOf all the thousands who aspire to enter IIM Ahmedabad and spend hours caressing its brochure, few know that its symbol—an ornate tracery window—is inspired by one of the city’s greatest sculpted works: the screens at the 16th century mosque of Shaikh Sa’id, also known as Sidi Sayyid’s Mosque.\n\nSheikh Sa’id was no king but a distinguished noble in the court of Gujarat’s last Sultan, Muzaffar III. Accordingly, his mosque in a corner of the erstwhile Bhadra Citadel is small: just 21 metres across. But what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for with the quality of its 10 screens. Of these, the two set in its western wall are unrivalled for workmanship in the entire country. It’s not only the intricate pattern but also its refined and true-to-life execution that makes the screens remarkable.\n\nSidi Sayyid’s Mosque was built in 1572: the last year of the Gujarat Sultanate. But it was by no means a culmination of the architectural styles spawned under the sultans during 160 years of Ahmedabad’s existence. Indeed, it is difficult to crown one among this great city’s many monuments. Be it the Jami Masjid of the city’s founder, Sultan Ahmed Shah, or the Sarkhej complex, or the Kankaria tank, or the step-well of Bai Hari…each one is a sight to behold.\n\nThe River\n\nIt is said that Sultan Ahmed Shah founded Ahmedabad on the advice of his spiritual preceptor, the Sufi mystic Sheikh Ahmed Khattu. There are also two legends regarding the selection of the site five miles away from the Sheikh’s sanctuary. The first of these claims that the sultan chose the site on seeing a hare attack his hounds there. The second, more probable account, goes that Ahmed Shah fell in love with the daughter of the local chief, Asa Bhil, from whom he had just wrested the land.\n\nRomantic legends apart, the site’s proximity to the Sabarmati River would have had the strongest influence on Ahmad Shah’s decision. The new capital could not flourish without water, and the area’s dry, hot summers would test its populace sorely, so Ahmed Shah even augmented the Sabarmati’s supply by diverting the smaller Hatmati River into it.\n\nTo this day, the Sabarmati remains Ahmedabad’s lifeline. If you approach the city from the north or the west, you would cross this river. Till a few years ago, its waters used to be thick with industrial effluents, but now, ever since it was augmented with the Narmada River’s waters, the Sabarmati at Ahmedabad is once again a pleasant sight. Work is also on to develop the riverfront on international lines, with roads, markets, promenades, entertainment parks etc. And in time this is set to become the city’s juiciest strip of real estate.\n\nIt may be the lifeline of a great old city, but most Indians associate the Sabarmati with the country’s struggle for independence. On its right bank stands Ahmedabad’s most popular tourist site: Mahatma Gandhi’s Satyagraha Ashram. It was his home and ‘laboratory’ from June 17, 1917 to March 12, 1930, when he set out on the historic Salt March, vowing not to return till the country became independent. In his autobiography, Gandhi mentions two reasons for selecting the site: firstly, its proximity to prison, and secondly, “its situation on the bank of the river and its solitude.”\n\nFive centuries before him, another saint, Sheikh Ahmed Khattu, had likewise built his sanctuary on the river’s right bank, at a place called Sarkhej. And while Gandhi sought salvation for India’s millions by reviving the arts of spinning and weaving, in Khattu’s time Sarkhej was a settlement of poor weavers and dyers that the Sheikh was loath to quit for the promised delights of the sultan’s new city.\n\nSacred Suburb\n\nSheikh Khattu was 111 when he died in 1445 AD. All his life he had lived frugally, as becomes a saint, but no preceptor of sultans was ever buried meanly. So a year after the Sheikh’s death, Sultan Muhammad Shah, son and successor of Ahmed Shah, commenced building a tomb that would be the biggest in all of Gujarat.\n\nGiven his stature among the holy men of Gujarat, the Sheikh’s tomb soon became the centre of a royal necropolis. Among the notables buried around him are Sultan Mahmud Begarha, Ahmed Shah’s grandson, who is considered the most powerful of Gujarat’s sultans; his queen Rajbai, and their illustrious son Sultan Muzaffar Shah-II.\n\nWith so much royal attention, Sarkhej’s landscape could not remain unchanged and, in addition to the tombs and a large mosque (which archaeologist James Fergusson compared to Agra’s Moti Masjid for “simple elegance”), it was also blessed with a large reservoir surrounded with pleasure pavilions. In a short time, the saint’s abode had become a royal retreat!\n\nThe centuries, though, have returned Sarkhej to its austere state. While the palaces have crumbled, the mosque, the Sheikh’s mausoleum and the surrounding tombs stand intact. Every morning, afternoon and evening, the faithful fill the silent courts. Though it lies just five miles out of Ahmedabad, this tranquil complex is a world removed from the “Manchester of India.”\n\nOld Fabric\n\nJ Albert de Mandelslo, who visited Ahmedabad in 1638, notes, “There is not…any merchandise in all Asia which may not be had at Amadabath.” By the time of his visit, the city had been a province of the Mughal Empire for 65 years. And its reputation as the cloth capital was well established. It produced “all sorts of satins and velvets of all sorts of colours. Satins for linings, of both thread and silk. Carpets, but not so good as those of Persia, and all sorts of cotton.”\n\nJust as the city today excels in everything from cloth manufacture to education and space research, so in that pre-Industrial age it was famous for crafts ranging from pottery to brocade making. Of the city’s wiredrawers, Sir George Birdwood wrote, “So great is his delicacy of touch that if desired, (he) can draw out half an ounce of silver into 2,000 yards of thread.” And then there were the sculptors, best remembered for the tracery windows of Sidi Sayyid’s Mosque, which Fergusson describes as, “more like a work of nature than any other architectural detail that has yet been designed even by the best architects of Greece or of the Middle Ages.”\n\nLike those screens, the paired minarets of Ahmedabad’s mosques have also been an object of wonder for visitors down the ages. In 1809, Colonel Monier Williams strode up a minaret of Jami Masjid–Ahmed Shah’s congregational mosque, which is amongst the largest in India. He found that when one of the pair was shaken, it “communicated the motion to the other fully.” Next, he lay down on the section of the roof between the minarets whilst they were shaken but, “was not sensible of the smallest motion or agitation whatever in the building under me.” You will encounter two such ‘swaying minarets’ near the entrance of the Ahmedabad Railway Station. But the two most famous ones lies further down the road, and are known as the minarets of Sidi Bashir’s Mosque.\n\nThe Ahmedabad of sultans was a substantial city comprising 360 self-contained neighbourhoods. It was protected by a 10 km wall topped with over 6,000 battlements. While many of its ancient buildings have disappeared down the centuries, quite a few are still around. When George William Forrest visited the city in the late 19th century, he wrote, “Nowhere does one feel oneself more thoroughly in an eastern city of past times than in the narrow streets of Ahmedabad, thick with ancient houses, none so poor as not to have a doorway or a window or a wooden pillar carved finely.”\n\nForrest would not recognise the happening metropolis that Ahmedabad is today, but if you paused awhile amidst the numberless pillars of Ahmed Shah’s Jami Masjid or at the sultan’s tomb nearby, or under an arch of the busy Tripolia Gateway, which once spanned the city’s main thoroughfare, or deep in the belly of Bai Hari’s vav (step-well), built by a woman of Mahmud Begarha’s household, you would still feel transported to another time, as Forrest did all those years ago!"
