        "text": "The King’s Mawlid\n\nObserve how Wahhabi/Deobandi begin with a lie and end with a greater lie, progressing from calling King Muzaffar and the Ulema of the Umma as \"irreligious\" until they end up saying they \"had no connection with the Deen\"!\n\nDeobandi/Wahhabi say Quote: “The celebration of the mawlid is an innovation in religion. Neither was it the practice of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم nor did the companions or tabi’een celebrate this occasion.\n\n“Allamah Anwar Shah Al-Kashmiri has said,\n\nوأحدثه صوفي في عهد سلطان إربل سنة ( 600 ) ، ولم يكن له أصل من الشريعة الغراء\n\nالعرف الشذي شرح سنن الترمذي - (2 / 82 مؤسسة ضحى للنشر والتوزيع)\n\n“A sufi innovated it in the era of Sultan Irbil around the year 600 A.H, and it does not have any basis in our pure Shariah.”\n\nScholars state that the first person to introduce the innovation (bid'a) of celebrating the Milad was the ruler of Irbil, Muzaffar ad-Din ibn Zain al-Din. This was six centuries after the period of prophet hood.\n\nAllaamah Muizzuddin Hasan Khwaarzimi states in his book, Al-Qawl al Mu’tamad,\n\n“The Ruler of Irbal, King Muzaffar Abu Saeed Kaukari, was an irreligious and prodigal king. He ordered the scholars of his time to act according to their opinions and discard the practice of following any school of law. A group of learned men inclined towards him. He (this king) organized Mawlood sessions during the month of Rabi al Awwal. He was the first king ever to introduce this practice.”\n\nA ‘scholar’ by the name of Abul Khattab Umar bin Hasan bin Dihya Al Andalusi supported and assisted the king in this innovation.\n\nAllamah Ibn Kathir (May Allah Ta'ala have mercy on him) has reported on the authority of As-Sabt about this person,\n\nقال السبط: وقد كان كابن عنين في ثلب المسلمين والوقيعة فيهم، ويتزيد في كلامه فترك الناس الرواية عنه وكذبوه\n\n(البداية والنهاية - 13 / 169دار إحياء التراث العربي)\n\n“Ibn Unain (Ibn Dihya) used to insult the Muslims and vilify them. He would make additions in his report and exaggerate. The people stopped narrating traditions from him and falsified him.” (Al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya, 3/144-146)\n\nIbn Hajar Al-Asqalani (May Allah Ta'ala have mercy on him) has commented on him,\n\nوكان ظاهري المذهب كثير الوقيعة في الأئمة وفي السلف من العلماء خبيث اللسان أحمق شديد الكبر قليل النظر في أمور الدين متهاونا\n\n(لسان الميزان - 4 / 296مؤسسة الأعلمي للمطبوعات – بيروت)\n\n“He was a follower of the Zahiri school of thought and often slandered the scholars and the scholars of the past. He possessed an evil tongue and was stupid, self-conceited, lacked insight in religious matters, and looked down upon religion.” (Lisan al-Mizan, 4/296)” [End of quote]\n\nAlislam.org.za\n\nCopyright © 2005-2006 Central-Mosque All rights reserved. Comments and suggestions to webmaster@central-mosque.com\n\n---\n\n^ (Fatwa: 414/339/B=1431)\n\nQuote: \"Celebrating Eid Meelad al-nabi (the birthday of the Prophet) is not proved by Hadith and Quran. The companions of the holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) who held great respect and love for holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they never celebrated Eid Meelad. It is the invention of Christians which was invented following six hundred years after the holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). We are not asked to celebrate the birthday or death-day of anyone. This day should be spent like other days. Allah (Subhana Wa Ta'ala) knows Best\", [Darul Ifta, Darul Uloom Deoband]\n\n---\n\nDeobandi Mawlid\n\nDarul Uloom Deoband's Ex-Vice-Chancellor Maulana Ghulam Mohammed Vastanvi\n\nIs not the Curse of Allah\n\non the heads of the liars?\n\nAccording to famous Urdu news paper JANG Karachi; 25 Lac people attended the 100th Anniversary (Birthday) of Darul Uloom Deoband and Miss Indra Gandhi, the chief guest delivered speech. (Jang, Wednesday, 8 Jamadiul Awwal 1400 H, 26th March 1980)\n\nAccording to Urdu Newspaper Al-Hilal “Darul Uloom Deoband Conference (on 150thAniversary of Darul Uloom Deoband) was vision of Mufti Mehmood (Al-Hilal, 24th to 30th November 2000)\n\nWhat an irony of Deo-bandits; they celebrated 100th Anniversary in 1980 then 150th in 2001; how it could be?\n\nSecondly those who impose Fatawas of Shirkand Bidaat on celebrating Meeladun Nabi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam are celebrating Anniversary of their so-called Darul Uloom.\n\nAgain Al-Hilal copying the statement of Maulana Fidaur Rehman Darkhwasti,إ“Independence should be celebrated on 27th Ramadhan? (Al-Hilal)\n\nSee the Mockery of Deobandi Scholars those who cry on celebrations of Meeladun Nabi are advising to celebrate Independence Day on 27th Ramadhan.\n\nAgain Jang Karachi states : “On the occasion of Eid Meeladun Nabi Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam; Allama Abbas komeli, Molana Ahtramul Haq Thanvi and others are delivering speech in congregation organized by World Isalmic Forum (Jang, Tuesday 15th Rabiul Awwal 1423, 28th May 2002)\n\nWas there any FATWA came from Darul Uloom Deoband of Shirk or Bidat on Ahtramul Haq Thanvi on attending Mehfi-e-Meelad?\n\nNow, Qaumi Akhbar from Karachi states,“We also celebrate Eid Meeladun Nabi Sallallahi Alaihi Wasllam Prof. Ghafoor Ahmed (of Jamat-e-Islami) (Qaumi Akhbar, Monday 21st Rabiul Awwal 1410 H; 23 October 1989) Professor Ghafoor Ahmed belongs to Jamat-e-Islami, same Jamat-e-Islami who blames Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat as Mushrik and Bidati because of celebrating Eid Meeladun Nabi Sallallaho Alaihi Wasallam.\n\n--------------\n\nBirthday against Sharia:\n\nDarul Uloom Deoband\n\nMuzaffarnagar (AsiaNews/Agencies) – A leading Islamic seminary, the Darul Uloom Deoband (pictured), has advised Muslims against celebrating birthdays, issuing a fatwa saying that Islam does not permit the practice, which is a \"tradition of Western countries\".\n\nResponding to a query of a student, the fatwa department of the country's biggest Islamic seminary said that Islam does not permit such celebrations as they are against the Sharia.The query was made in reference to the birthday celebration of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, the founder of the Aligarh Muslim University.\n\n--\n\n^Vice-Chancellor of Darul Uloom Deoband, Maulana Abul Kasim Naumani said:\n\n\"Muslims should not follow the tradition of Western culture of celebrating birthdays as it against the Sharia,\"\n\nNaumani added that even the Islamic seminary does not celebrate the birth anniversary of the Prophet Mohammed, the founder of the religion. Read: here\n\n------------------------\n\nNOTE:\n\nIbn Kathir himself composed a text onMawlid, made of hadiths, invocations of blessings on the Prophet (s) , and poetry in praise of him.\n\nIt is entitled Mawlid Rasulillah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, and was edited and published by Salah al-Din al-Munajjid (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-Jadid, 1961).\n\nMilad-un-Nabi\n\n---\n\nMuzaffar,\n\nAbu Said Kukbiriyy Ibn Zayn ad-Din ^Aliyy Ibn Buktakin.\n\nHe was one of the glorious, grand, and generous kings with many good traces.\n\nHe is the one who built the Mudhaffariyy Mosque on the pinnacle of Mount Qasiyun.\n\nMuzafar Al-Deen Abi Sa`d Kawakbri Ibn Zein Ed-Deen `Ali- Ibn Tabakatikin\n\nMuzaffar al-Din Kukburi (Gökburi) ibn Zayn al-Din ‘Ali ibn Begtigin,\n\n(563-630 H/1168-1233 AD)\n\n---\n\nIbnu Khalikan’s historical report says that Ahly as-Sunnah version of the Prophet’s birthday celebration was introduced in Egypt by Al-Malik Muzaffar Ad-Din Kukburi in 604 AH/1207 CE.\n\nKukburi was brother of Salahuddin al-Ayyubi (Saladin).\n\nThese were the days of Crusade where almost 200 years waves after waves of crusaders from Europe came to the heart of the Muslim world in the Middle East to fight Muslims in their own countries.\n\nThe Ruler of Irbil (Erbil, Arbil) in Iraq, Abu Sa`eed al Muzaffar bin Baktakeen Kawkabriyy, initiated the Mawlid in the 7th century hijriy.\n\nHe was a pious, brave, just, generous and knowledgeable ruler and defender of Islam, who died while fighting the Crusaders in Palestine. He invited many Muslims including the scholars of Hadeeth, Tafseer, Fiqh and sincere Sufis and celebrated the Mawlid.\n\nThe scholar of Fiqh, Abul Khattab Ibn Duhyah, wrote a book praising this doing and gave it to the king especially to be read during the Mawlid celebration. The doing of the Mawlid became known to the scholars in the east and west, who accepted it and pointed to the Islamic proofs which confirmed its validity. Among those scholars the imam of Hadeeth hafiz Ahmad bin Hajar al`Asqalaniyy, imam hafiz as Sakhawiyy and imam hafiz as Suyutiyy. Those scholars and others wrote several books praising the Mawlid and none of the Muslim scholars dispraised this celebration.\n\nal-Dhahabi writes that,\n\n\"King Abu Saeed Kokabriused to give alot of Sadiqa and offered salat regularly, He (Sultan Muzafar udin Abu Saeed Kokabri) was to built hospital for ill and blind and used to go to visit them on every Thursday, He built separate houses for orphans same for women, He specially used to go to hospitals to visit them in hospitals, built seperate Madaris for Ahnaaf and Shawafa and for sufis he built Khankaas. Words cannot explain the way in which Mehfil al-Mawlid Mustafa (Peace Be Upon Him) was celebrated by Malik al-Muzafar,People used to go to such mehfils happilyfrom Araband Iraq, and used to sacrifice cows, camels and goats in large number and a lot of types of food was made, He used to arrange Mehfils for Sufis and used to do Khutbats in huge grounds and used to spend a lot of money in them, Ibn dhayawhen wrote a book on 'Mawlid un Nabi' so he gave him One Thousand Dinaar, he was a happyand pious Sunni, he used to love Fuqaha and Muhadiseen alot, .......One person in those Mehfils of Mawlid used to say that 100 beautiful horse used to be there for Salami, I saw Five Thousand stitched heads, Thousand hens, and one lakh Milk Filled Cups, and 30000 Sweet Dishes were seen on Mehfil al-Mawlid.\"\n\n[Imam Dhabai, Tarikh al-Islam: wa-tabaqat al-mashahir wa-al-a`lam Volume 45 Page No. 403, Publish: Dar al-Kutub al-Arabi, Beirut/Lebanon.]\n\nal-Dhahabi writes that, this King was of good 'Iqhlaq' and 'Helpful' and used to have Ahl as-Sunna'h (Sunni) beliefs, he used to respect 'Fuqaha' and 'Muhaditheen' and had a very good heart.\n\n[Imam Dhabai, Tarikh al-Islam: wa-tabaqat al-mashahir wa-al-a`lam Volume 45 Page No. 404]\n\nal-Dhahabi wrote in his Siyar A`lam al-Nubala' (Arna'ut ed. 22:335-336): He [Muzaffar the King of Irbil] loved charity (sadaqa)... and built four hospices for the poor and sick... and one house for women, one for orphans, one for the homeless, and he himself used to visit the sick... He built a madrasa for the Shafi`is and the Hanafis... HE WOULD FORBID ANY REPREHENSIBLE MATTER TO ENTER INTO HIS COUNTRY... As for his celebration of the Noble Mawlid al-Nabawi, words are too poor to describe it. The people used to come all the way from Iraq and Algeria to attend it. Two wooden dais would be erected and decorated for him and his wife... the celebration would last several days, and a huge quantity of cows and camels would be brought out to be sacrificed and cooked in different ways... Preachers would roam the field exhorting the people. Great sums were spent (as charity). Ibn Dihya compiled a 'Book of Mawlid' for him for which he received 1,000 dinars. He [Muzaffar] was modest, a LOVER OF GOOD, AND A TRUE SUNNI who loved scholars of jurisprudence and scholars of hadith, and was generous even to poets.

He was a wise king, brave, a fierce fighter, intelligent, learned, and just. May Allah have mercy on him and ennoble his grave.Shaykh Abu al-Khattab ibn Dihya compiled for him a book on the Mawlid of the Prophet (s) and named it al-Tanwir fi Mawlid al-Bashir al-Nadhir (\"The illumination concerning the birthday of the Bringer of glad tidings and Warner\") and the king rewarded him with 1,000 dinars for it. His rule lasted until he died in the year 630 [Hijri] as he was besieging the French in the city of Acca [Acre, Palestine] after a GLORIOUS AND BLAMELESS LIFE.\"\n\nIbn Kathir wrote that: There was once a King, Abu Sa’eed Malik Muzaffar - a man of good deeds. In his kingdom, wherever he saw a lack of water, he would build a well. He also established many Islamic study centers. Every year, he would spend half a million dinars on hosting a gathering of his people to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet [May Allah bless Him and grant Him peace] [Tareekh Ibn Kathir, see story of King Abu Sa’eed, Volume 13]\n\nIbn KathirThe scholar revered most highly by Salafis/Wahabis in Tafsir & History.\n\nHe says regarding Shah Malik al-Muzzafar (rah) regarding whom Salafis spread deception by forging words of Ibn Kathir (rah) i.e. he was actually a Fasiq, cruel and Bidatiruler (Naudhobillah) but in reality Imam Ibn Kathir (rah) said this:\n\nأحد الاجواد والسادات الكبراء والملوك الامجاد له آثار حسنة وقد عمر الجامع المظفري بسفح قاسيون وكان قدهم بسياقه الماء إليه من ماء بذيرة فمنعه المعظم من ذلك واعتل بأنه قد يمر على مقابر المسلمين بالسفوح وكان يعمل المولد الشريف في ربيع الاول ويحتفل به احتفالا هائلا وكان مع ذلك شهما شجاعا فاتكا بطلا عاقلا عالما عادلا رحمه الله وأكرم مثواه وقد صنف الشيخ أبو الخطاب ابن دحية له مجلدا في المولد النبوي سماه التنوير في مولد البشير النذير فأجازه على ذلك بألف دينار وقد طالت مدته في الملك في زمان الدولة الصلاحية وقد كان محاصر عكا وإلى هذه السنة محمودالسيرة والسريرة قال السبط حكى بعض من حضر سماط المظفر في بعض الموالد كان يمد في ذلك السماط خمسة آلاف راس مشوى وعشرة آلاف دجاجة ومائة ألف زبدية وثلاثين ألف صحن حلوى\n\nTranslation: He was a generous, mighty master, and glorious ruler, whose works were very good. He built Jamiya al Muzaffari near Qasiyun…During Rabi ul Awwal he used to celebrate Mawlid ash Shareef (يعمل المولد الشريف في ربيع الاول) with great celebration, Moreover, he was benevolent, brave, wise, a scholar, and just person – Rahimuhullah wa Ikraam – Sheikh Abul Khattab (rah) wrote a book on Mawlid an Nabwi for him and named it At-Tanwir fi Mawlid al Bashir al Nazeer, for which he gave him 1000 dinars. His rule stayed till the Rule of Salahiya and he captured Aka and he remained a man worthy of respect. Al-Sabt mentions that a person attending the gathering of Mawlid held by Muzzafar said: He used to fill the table with 5000 well cooked goats, 10,000 chickens, 100-thousand bowls (of milk) and 30,000 trays of sweets.

The question has been asked about the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabawi in the month of Rabi` al-awwal: what is the ruling concerning it according to shari`a, and is it praiseworthy or blameworthy, and does the one who practices it obtain reward for it or no?\n\n\"I answer that the origin of the celebration of Mawlid, which consists in the gathering of people, the recitation of Qur'an, the narrating of accounts related to the beginnings of the Prophet (s) and the miracles that have been told as taking place upon his birth, and then in the giving of food to the people who eat and leave without adding anything to this, -- *this is one of the praiseworthy innovations* [huwa min al-bida` al-hasana] for the doing of which one obtains reward, because of the respect shown to the greatness of the Prophet (s) and the demonstration of joy and happiness at the news of his noble birth.\n\n\"The first to have innovated that practice is the ruler of Irbil, King al-Muzaffar Abu Sa`eed... one of the noblest and most generous kings (to have ruled). He left man good bequests. He is the one who built the Muzaffari mosque on the side of Jabal Qasyun [in Syria; it is said that Judgment Day will take place on that mountain].\n\n--- --\n\nThe Hafidh as-Sakhawi said in his book of fatwas (edicts), “Celebrating the birth of the Prophet was innovated after the lapse of the first three centuries. Since then, the Muslims at large in the major cities have been celebrating the Mawlid. During the nights of the celebration they give much in charity and recite the story of the honourable Mawlid. As a result, they reap many blessings and merits.”\n\nImam Qastalani writes: \"In the month of the birth of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s), Muslims have always had assemblies. In the nights of that month, they gave charities and expressed happiness. They always increased good deeds in those nights. They always made arrangements to perform the Milad of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s) with the auspicious hope that Allah showers His blessings upon them. One of the experienced Barakah (blessings) of Milad is that the year passes upon them peacefully.May Allah send His blessings and favours upon that person who takes Milad un Nabi as Eid; this Eid should become a reason of hardness upon that person who has disease in his heart.\" [Mawahibul Le Dunya]\n\nImam Shahab-ud-din Abul Abbas al-Qastallani (Rahimuhullah) the author of great Seerah book called Al-Muwahib al-Laduniya, hesaid: When it is said that Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) was born at night time then the question arises which of the two nights is greater i.e. Night of Decree or Night of Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam)'s birth?\n\nThe Night of Prophet (s)'s\n\nbirth is superior due to 3 reasons\n\nFirst: He (salallaho alaihi wasalam) arrived (in this world) on the Night of Mawlid whereas Night of decree was granted to him (afterwards), therefore the arrival of Prophet (saw) is greater than what has been granted to him, hence night of Mawlid is higher in virtue.\n\nSecond: If Night of decree is vitreous night because Angels descend in it, then Night of Mawlid has the virtue of Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) being sent to world. The Prophet (saw) is superior to Angels, therefore night of Mawlid becomes superior.\n\nThird: Due to night of decree, the Ummah of Muhammad (salallaho alaihi wasalam) was given imminence, whereas due to Night of Mawlid all creations were given Fazilah, as Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) is sent as Mercy to worlds/creations (Quran 21:107), hence the blessing was made general for all creations.\n\nReference: Imam Qastallani – Rahimuhuillah in Al Muwahib al Laduniya Volume 1, Page No. 145, Also Imam Zarqani – Rahimuhullah in his Sharah of Al-Muwahib, Volume 1, Page Nos 255-256Imam Qastallani (Rahimuhullah) also said: May Allah have mercy on the one who turns the nights of the month of the Prophet's birth into celebrationin order to decrease the suffering of those whose hearts are filled with disease and sickness.\"[Al-Muwahib- Volume 1, Page No 148]\n\nShaykh ul Islam Imam Ibn Hajr al Haytami writes: The gatherings of Mawlid and Adhkaar which take place during our time, they are mostly confined to good deeds, for example in them Sadaqat are given, Dhikr is done, Darud and Salam is sent upon the Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) and he is praised. [Imam al Haythami (rah) in Fatawa al Hadithiyyah, Page No. 202]\n\nMullah Ali Qari writes: \"Firstly, we see that it is permissible to arrange an assembly of Milad. It is permissible to participate in that assembly for the purpose of listening to the praises and character of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s.). Inviting people and expressing happiness is permissible. Secondly, we do not say that it is Sunnah to celebrate Milad on any fixed night. Anyone who believes that it is Sunnah to celebrate Milad on any fixed night (and not in any other night) is a Bidati [wrongful innovator] because the Zikr of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s) is required all the time. Though indeed, the month in which Sayyidina Rasulallah (s) was born has more preference.\" [Al Mouridur-ravi fil Mawlidin Nabi]\n\nMullah Ali Qari (Rah) the author of Sharh al Mishqaat and magnificent Hanafi scholar, he said:Allah said: There hath come unto you a messenger, (one) of yourselves (9:128), In this It is pointed towards honoring the time when Prophet (saw) arrived amongst us, therefore one should do dhikr (of Quran) to thank Allah. As for Samah and playing is concerned then that which is Mubah (i.e. allowed) could be made part of Mawliddue to happiness without any harm [Muallah Ali Qari in his Al Mawlid an Nabi, Page No. 17]\n\nIbn Rajab Al Hanbali wrote a book on the important seasons of Islam , one of them being the birth of the Prophet (s). Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, in explaining hadith of Muslim said, \"It is good to fast on the days that Allah (swt) honored and favored his servants.\" It is incumbent not only on Muslims but on all human beings to rejoice in his advent, the day of his birth. [Lataif al-maarif, page 9]\n\nAllama Ibn Abideen Shami writes: \"Every person who is truthful in the love of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s) should express happiness in the month of Rabiul Awwal. He should arrange an assembly for the Milad of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s) in which the incidents of his birth are explained with correct Ahadith. There is a strong hope from Allah that such a person will be included in the group of pious people blessed with the intercession of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s).\" [Jawahi Rul Bihaar]\n\nHazrat Sheikh Abdul Haqq Muhaddith Delwi writes: \"Muslims have always celebrated Milad functions in the month of Rabiul Awwal. They always gave charities in the nights of that month and expressed their happiness. This is a common practice of Muslims that they particularly make mention of those incidents which are related to the birth of Sayyidina Rasulallah (s.a.w).\"[Ma Sabata Bis Sunnah]\n\nShah Wali Ullah Muhadith Dhelvi (Rah) the great Imam of al-Hind mentions one of his all time wonderful experiences as:I took part in a gathering of Mawlid inside Makkah where people were sending Darood and Slaam upon Prophet (Peace be upon him) and mentioning the incidents which took place during the time of your birth (before and after) and those which were witnessed before you were appointed as a Nabi (such as Nur eliminating from Bibi Amina RA, she seeing Nur, woman proposing to Abdullah RA on sight of Nur on his forehead etc...) suddenly I saw Nur to have enveloped one group of people, I don’t claim that I saw this with my bodily eyes, nor do I claim that it was spiritual and Allah knows the best regarding these two, however upon concentration on these Anwaar a reality opened upon me that these Anwaar are of those Angels who take part in such gatherings, I also saw Mercy to be descending along with Anwaar of Angels[Fayudh al Haramayn, Pages 80-81]\n\nShah Abdul Aziz Muhadith Dhelvi (Rah) the author of leading book written on refutation of Rafidhis (i.e. Tohfa Athna Ashriyah) he said: The Barakah of Rabi ul Awwal is due to birth of Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam) in this month, the more this Ummah sends Darud and Salaam and arrange for (sadaqa for the poor), more will they be blessed *[Fatawa al Azizi 1:123]\n\nIbn Al-Jawzi, wrote a book called: “Milaad-un-Nabi” in which he gives very strong proofs permitting the celebration of Milaad. Imam Ibn Jawzi(Rah) the moststrict scholar on Jirah wa Tadeel, even he wrote a complete book on Mawlid where he said:\n\nIn Haramayn (i.e. Makkah and Madina), in Egypt, Yemen rather all people of Arab world have been celebrating Mawlid for long. Upon sight of the moon in Rabi ul Awwal their happiness touches the limits and hence they make specific gatherings for Dhikr of Mawlid due to which they earn immense Ajr and Success.[Biyan al Milaad an Nabwi, Page No. 58]\n\nThe grandson of Ibn al-Jawziyy mentioned in “Mir’at az-Zaman” that the elites of the scholars and the Sufis used to attend the celebration with him.\n\nIn his biography of Ibn Dihyah, Ibn Khillikan said: He (Ibn Dihyah) was among the elite of the scholars and the famous people of merit.Ibn Dihyah entered the countries of ash-Sham and Iraq coming from Morocco. In his travels he passed through Irbil in the year 604 AH and found its king, the glorious Mudhaffar ad-Din Ibn Zayn ad-Din, very keen about celebrating the honourable Mawlid. He authored a book about the Mawlid for the king entitled Al-Tanwir Fi Mawlid Al-Bashir An-Nathir, and personally read it for him. The king rewarded him with one thousand dinars.”\n\nImam ibn Hajar Asqalani states, “If in the Milad Shareef only acts of virtue are done and acts of abomination are abstained from, then the Milad Shareef is a Bidat-e-Hasanah (good innovation), otherwise not.\" He then added \"... to do any virtuous act and to observe it annually as means of recollection for any special day on which Allah has bestowed any favour or removed any calamity, is a form of showing gratitude to Allah. Gratitude to Allah is expressed through different kinds of Ibaadah (worship) - prostration and standing in prayer, charity and recitation of the Holy Qu'ran. And what is a greater favour from Allah than the appearance of the Prophet of Mercy on this day (i.e. 12th of Rabbi-ul-Awwal)?”\n\nSheikh ul Islam and hadith Master of his age,\n\nIbn Hajr Asqalani\n\nThe Sheikh ul Islam and hadith Master of his age, Ibn Hajr Asqalani was asked about the practice of commemorating the birth of the Prophet, and gave the following written reply: As for the origin of the practice of commemorating the Prophet's birth, it is an innovation that has not been conveyed to us from any of the pious early muslims of the first three centuries, despite which it has included both features that are praiseworthy and features that are not.\n\nIf one takes care to include in such a commemoration only things that are praiseworthy and avoids those that are otherwise, it is a praise worthy innovation, while if ones does not, it is not.\n\nAn authentic primary textual basis from which its legal validity is inferable has occured to me, namely the rigorously authenticated (sahih) hadith in the collections of Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet came to Medina and found the Jews fasting on the tenth of Muharram `Ashura ' [Husn al-Maqsad fi Amal al-Mawlid Page No. 63] [Continued in Next Page No 64]\n\nSo he asked them about it and they replied:\n\n\"It is the day on which Allah drowned Pharaoh and rescued Moses, so we fast in it to thanks to Allah Most high,\" which indicates the validity of giving thanks to Allah for the blessings He has bestowed on a particular day in providing a benefit, or averting an affliction, repeating one's thanks on the anniversary of that day every year, giving thanks to Allah taking * any various forms of worship such as prostration, fasting, giving charity or reciting the Koran. Then what blessing is greather than the Birth of the Prophet, the Prophet of Mercy, on this day? in light of which, one should take care to commemorate it on the day itself in order to confrom to the above story of moses and the tenth of Muharram, [but] those who do not view the matter thus do not mind commemorating it on any day of the month, while some have expanded its time to any of day the year, whatever exception bay e taken at such a view.\n\n[Husn al-Maqsad fi Amal al-Mawlid Page No. 64]\n\nI have derived the permissibility of Mawlid from another source of the Sunna [besides Ibn Hajar's deduction from the hadith of `Ashura'], namely :\n\nThe hadith found in Bayhaqi, narrated by Anas, that \"The Prophet slaughtered a `aqiqa [sacrifice for newborns] for himself after he received the prophecy,\"although it has been mentioned that his grandfather `Abd al-Muttalib did that on the seventh day after he was born, and the `aqiqa cannot be repeated.\n\nThus the reason for the Prophet's action is to give thanks to Allah for sending him as a mercy to the worlds, and to give honor to his Umma, in the same way that he used to pray on himself. It is recommended for us, therefore, that we also show thanks for his birth by meeting with our brothers, by feeding people, and other such good works and rejoicing.\"\n\nThis hadith confirms the aforementioned hadith of the Prophet's emphasis of Monday as the day of his birthday and that of his prophethood.\n\n[Husn al-Maqsad fi Amal al-Mawlid Page No. 64-65]\n\n^Scanned Page:\n\n[Husn al-Maqsad fi Amal al-Mawlid, Imam Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, Publish by Dar al KutubPage,41Page,54-55Page, 63Page,64 ]\n\nThe scholars of both the East and the West judged this innovation as a good, rewardable practice.\n\nThe Hafidh Ibn Hajar al-^Asqalaniyy; his student, the Hafidh as-Sakhawi; the Hafidh as-Suyutiyy, and many others accepted this practice as a good innovation, as evidenced in their sayings and writings\n\nImam Baihaqi said that Bibi Ayesha (radi Allahu anha), a wife of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said that Prophet Ibrahim's Station (Footprint) was attached to \"KAABA\" during the Prophet's (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) and Abu-Bakr's (radi Allahu anhu) time. It was not until the time of Hazrat Umar (radi Allahu anhu) who changed its original position.\n\nIbn Hajar, the great Muhaddith said: None of the companions raised any objection against Hazrat Umar (radi Allahu anhu) for doing so and he was the first person to cover Prophet Ibrahim's Station (Footprint) in the state it is now.\n\nIbn Hajar Al-Asqalani who explained Sahih Al-Bukhari said: \"Every action which was not in practice at the Prophet's (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) time is called or known as Innovation, however, there are those which are classified as 'Good' and there are those which are contrary to that\".\n\nImam of Imams Izzuddin Ibn Abd al-Salaam writes in his book \"Al-Qawa'aid\": \"Bid'ah is divided into Wajib, Haram, Mandub, Makruh and Mabah. And the way to know which category it belongs to, is to examine it together with the laws of Shari'ah. If it falls in with the laws that deal with what is Wajib, then it is Wajib. If with those laws that deal with Haram, then it is Haram. If with the laws dealing with what is Mandub, then it is Mandub. If with the laws dealing with what is Makruh, then it is Makruh. If with the laws dealing with what is Mubah, then it is Mubah\".\n\n-----------------------------\n\nEven Ibn Tay'miah said in his book \"Necessity of the Right Path\", p. 266, 5th line from the bottom of that page, published by Dar Al-Hadith, the following:\n\n\"As far as what people do during the Meelad, either as a rival celebration to that which the Christian do during the time of Christ's birthday or as an expression of their love and admiration and a sign of praise for the Noble Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), Allah will surely reward them for such Ij'tiha\". He then said: \"Although Meelad was not practised by (Salaf), they should have done so since there was no objection against it from the Shari'ah point of view\".\n\n----------------------------\n\nIbn Qayyim al Jawziyyah, the best and most renowned student of Ibn Taymiyya, writes, on page 498 of \"Madarij as-Salikin,\"\n\n\"Listening to a good voice celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (s) or celebrating any of the holy days in our history gives peace to the heart, and gives the listener light from the Prophet (s) to his heart, and he will drink more from the Muhammadan spring (`ayn al-Muhammadiyya).\"\n\n-----------------------------\n\nSheikh Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Approves of Celebrating Mawlid\n\n\"Actually, celebrating the Prophet's birthday means celebrating the birth of Islam...\" [Source: Mufti Islam Online Fatwa Committee Date: 19/Apr/2001: Fatwa ID: 34150]\n\nThe famous scholar of Ghair Muqalideen,\n\nNawab Saddiq Hassan Khan Bhopali said:What is wrong in it if we cannot do dhikr of Prophet (salallaho alaihi wasalam)’s Seerah, his Hidaya, his Birth and his death evreyday, then we should do it every month and in days of Rabi Ul Awwal and they should not be left empty.He writes further: A Person who does not get happy upon incidents of Mawlid and does not thank Allah for such a great blessing then \"SUCH A PERSON IS NOT MUSLIM\" [Ash Shamama tul Anbarah min Mawlid al Khayr ul Barah, Page No. 12]\n\n----\n\nSheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani used to host gatherings and give gifts in joy of this occasion on the 11th of every month, which is now known as Giyarwi Sharif. This practise is still performed to this day.\n\nIt is written in Abu Muhammad Siyal Naqshbandi’s famous Tazkirah Ghause Azam that the Sultanul Awliya Shaykh Abdul Qadir Jilani radia Allahu anhu celebrated the 11th day of every lunar month because inevitably it would go into the 12th doing a Mawlid every month.\n\n*Imam Tirmidhi, in his book even gives the title of one of this chapters, the name “Milaad-un-Nabee”. (Tirmidhi, shamaa’il)\n\n*Imam Waaqdi (A second century Scholar) also wrote a book entitled “Milaad-un-Nabi”. The original copy can be found in Cairo.\n\nNot everything which the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) did not do or his Companions would ultimately make things \"HARAM\".\n\nSince the Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) himself said:\n\n\"He who introduces a new good Sunnah in Islam will be rewarded for it ...\"\n\nImam Shafi'i (radi Allahu anhu) said: \"Anything which enjoys the backing of Shari'ah cannot be an innovation even if the Companions did not practice it, because their abstention from doing something may have been due to a particular reason which was there at that time, or they have left it to something which happens to be better, or perhaps news about a particular them did not reach them all\".\n\nTherefore, whosoever alleges that this thing is Haraam on the basis that the Noble Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) did not practice it, then surely he has alleged something which has no foundation or backing in Shari'ah and thus his allegation is refuted and rejected.\n\n---\n\nEdited by ADHM)\n\n---"
