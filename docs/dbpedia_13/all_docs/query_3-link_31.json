        "text": "About the location: Located 8 km southwest of the old centre in Makarba, Sarkhej Roza is a mosque, tomb and palace complex dedicated to the memory of Ahmed Shah I’s spiritual advisor, Ahmed Khattu Ganj Baksh. The elegant, though dilapidated, buildings cluster around a great tank, constructed by Sultan Mahmud Begada (Shah’s grandson) in the mid-15th century. It’s an atmospheric place that was used as a retreat by several of Ahmedabad’s rulers. The mausoleums of Mahmud Begada (by the entrance, with geometric jalis casting patterns of light on the floor) and Ganj Baksh (the largest in Gujarat) are both here. The place has a cheery communal feel with locals picnicking in its large courtyard."
