From the halls of government to the streets, I follow money and policies to examine what’s working, what’s not, and how it’s affecting people in Southern California.\n\nI grew up in L.A. and OC, and previously spent more than a decade at Voice of OC covering the county government in Orange County – often reporting on issues like homelessness, public safety, mental health, and the role of money in politics.\n\nMy reporting helped unlock $70 million in mental health funds that had been stockpiled by Orange County officials, after a federal judge cited my stories in court hearings and demanded answers from elected leaders."
