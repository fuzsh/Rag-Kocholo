        "text": "Founded in 2009, the Voice of OC was created in response to what it saw as coverage gaps left by the decline of traditional print and broadcast news organizations. The nonprofit digital newsroom aims to reinvigorate news coverage and investigative journalism on local issues. The Voice of OC's journalism is intensively focused on community arts and culture by examining whether management is in line with national diversity trends and the deal-making with arts venues. Coverage topics can include the future of the Orange County fairgrounds, stadium and convention center expansions, public pensions, and government whistleblowers and outsourcing. It first published content on its website on March 31, 2010. The Voice of OC is guided by a board of directors. The organization describes itself as nonpartisan.\n\nThe Voice of OC says it respects the intersections of race, class, generation, gender and geography that impact point of view. The organization seeks diverse voices for its staff, and is interested in hearing the diverse voices in the communities it serves.\n\nThe Voice of OC's policy is to reserve anonymity only for sources who face danger, retribution or other harm, and who have information that cannot be obtained elsewhere. When an anonymous source is used, the audience is given an explanation of why anonymity was granted."
