        "text": "A 5-year-old autistic boy who went missing from his Deltona home Tuesday night was rescued from a pond by a Volusia County sheriff's deputy, the agency said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe child was reported missing at 7:30 p.m. at a home on Valmont Lane.\n\nA video of the rescue shows Deputy Wes Brough running into the water calling out \"Come here, buddy,\" to the child.\n\nBrough scoops up the boy in his arms and tells him \"You are OK.\"\n\nThe child's father told deputies his son escaped the house through a second-story door setting off an alarm. The family, joined by neighbors, immediately searched for the child and called 911, the sheriff's office said.\n\nDeputies searched the house and the immediate area but did not find him.\n\nDeputies knew the child was autistic and attracted to water so they began checking bodies of water near the neighborhood, the sheriff's office said.\n\nBrough and others headed for a pond a few blocks away behind Toluca Court. At 7:48 p.m. they heard a voice and spotted the boy out in the water, hanging on to a log. The deputy jumped into the pond and carried the boy to dry land, where he was medically cleared and returned to his family, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThe family had taken several measures to secure the house, including installing an alarm on the door that immediately alerted them the boy had gone missing, deputies said.\n\nBrough is trained in autism awareness to help deal with a wide variety of calls involving people with autism, including missing children, the sheriff's office said."
