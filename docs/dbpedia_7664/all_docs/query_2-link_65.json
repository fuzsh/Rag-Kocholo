        "text": "An offensive coordinator and quarterback must have the same brain when taking the field.\n\nThrough the entirety of one season, Bobby Slowik and Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud seem to be on the same page.\n\nSlowik, the Texans' second-year offensive coordinator, isn't looking for Stroud to be perfect heading into 2024. Perfection often might be viewed as a positive, but it's a negative when trying to find growth in the film room.\n\nAs Houston prepares for its second preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday, Stroud prepares to make his 2024 debut. Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said that both starters on offense and defense would play briefly before turning it over to the second and third-team units.\n\nWhat's the top selling point for Slowik watching Stroud for several drives? One word: growth.\n\n\"Everybody has a whole lot that we can see continue to get better at, we can continue to improve upon, and it can be something big that really affects the entire offense or it can be something minimal that is just for him individually,\" Slowik said following Tuesday's practice in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.\n\nStroud took the NFL by storm during his rookie season while setting a standard for future first-year signal-callers. He looked poised under pressure while elevating a roster that won 11 combined games in three games to a postseason contender.\n\nHis consistency set him apart en route to winning Offensive Rookie of the Year honors last fall. Stroud became the fifth rookie in league history to throw for over 4,000 yards in just 15 games. He also led the league in passing yards per game and touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nIf that's not enough, Stroud became the youngest quarterback in league history to win a playoff game after securing a 45-14 win over the Cleveland Browns. He threw three touchdown passes in the first half and coasted in the final 30 minutes.\n\nSlowik, viewed by many as one of the top coordinators in the sport, knows there's room for improvement. It's little and often can be solved in practice. One untimely throw during 7-on-7 drills shouldn't linger over to gamedays.\n\nBoth are looking to \"stack good days\" before the regular season starts. Tuesday would fall in the \"positive\" outlook. He connected twice for extensive gains with Nico Collins and found Tank Dell for a pair of first downs.\n\nOne day, however, can't get to Stroud. It's what Slowik is trying to help him avoid.\n\n“There are days where it gets frustrating for all of us and there are days where we really are on our game, and we go out and we perform like we believe we should,\" Slowik said. \"We have to get more consistent right now.”"
