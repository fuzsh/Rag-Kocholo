Anne Marie also contributes regularly to Eater Los Angeles and other well-respected publications. Anne Marie joins us in-studio for her regular bi-monthly visit to discuss specialty food products that caught her attention at the recent Natural Products Expo West at the Anaheim Convention Center. Also Anne Marie shares a gem of a Greek restaurant hidden in plain sight in Costa Mesa and a newly launched Tiki Brunch spot at an unexpected location in South Coast Plaza. Afternoon Tea with elegance is back at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel.\n\nThe Ecology Center’s (San Juan Capistrano) ever popular Community Table Dinner series is back on Friday evenings. “Guests enjoy a multicourse dinner prepared by accomplished guest chefs under the stars surrounded by the 28-acre Regenerative Organic Certified™ farm and education center. This intimate, family-style feast brings a rotating list of renowned guest chefs to the farm to design a thoughtful meal utilizing freshly harvested, regenerative organic ingredients sourced from just 250 feet away on the farm.” The Ecology Center’s Founder, Evan Marks, joins us with all the mouthwatering details.\n\nK + M Chocolate and K + M Extra Virgin Chocolate (Napa-based) is the result of an unusual collaboration between Chef Thomas Keller and Armando Manni. “As the first and only American-born chef to hold multiple three-star ratings from the prestigious Michelin Guide, Thomas Keller has established a reputation for excellence unparalleled in American cuisine. In Tuscany, Armando Manni has forged a similar reputation for quality by producing super-antioxidant, extra-virgin olive oil. Together, they have spent the past seven years on a unique mission: crafting a chocolate from the bean unlike any we have seen before. They have collaborated with the University of Florence to develop a new methodology to preserve the naturally occurring antioxidants in the cocoa beans. This proprietary process produces delicious, complex chocolate that draws the full potential out of every bean.” The General Manager of K + M Chocolate, Hallot Parson, is our guest.\n\n“Juliet, the new seafood-forward, Parisian-inspired restaurant and patio in Culver City, is now serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. From the team behind the popular restaurants Margot and Norah, Juliet is an ode to the way Parisians are dining now. The bright French-inspired menu highlights seasonal ingredients and seafood from Southern California, and is complemented by a curated wine list of French producers, classic cocktails, and an interactive bar side cart with exclusive offerings dedicated to Champagne and Martinis. Envisioned by AD 100 Designer Jeremiah Brent, Juliet is a timeless, 120-seat restaurant featuring a striking walk-up bar and communal wooden table, and floor-to-ceiling iron doors leading to a 1,500 square-foot shaded terrace.” General Manager Charlie Phillips joins us with a plate of brown butter madeleines in hand.\n\nOur own Chef Andrew Gruel, the menu-maker behind the full-service Calico Fish House (in Huntington Beach) and also the founder of Big Parm (New Jersey-style pizza) in the Mess Hall in Tustin provides another timely and informative “Ask the Chef” segment where Chef Andrew responds to listeners thoughtful inquiries. As a result of the Pandemic the use of cash at businesses is way on the decline. The credit card companies are heavily promoting the use of credit cards exclusively over cash.

By bringing these culinary artists back to the source, chefs receive an opportunity to connect with new ingredients, find fresh inspiration in our bioregion’s historic foodways, and discover the rewards of relationship with the land.”\n\nThe Ecology Center’s Founder, Evan Marks, joins us with all the mouthwatering details.\n\n“The Ecology Center is a non-profit 28-acre Regenerative Organic Certified™ farm and education center located in San Juan Capistrano, California that serves as a hub for southern California’s ecological movement. Founded by Evan Marks in 2008, the internationally-renowned organization attracts culinary and creative collaborators from around the world, partnerships with some of the most innovative and sustainable brands, and over 100,000 visitors annually.”\n\n“With a holistic approach that integrates the incubation of the next generation of agricultural, culinary, and educational leaders with the creation of a vibrant community resource and gathering place to inspire all, they are actively building a more abundant future, one that the next generations will be proud to inherit.”\n\n“K + M Chocolate and K + M Extra Virgin Chocolate (Napa-based) is the result of an unusual collaboration between Chef Thomas Keller and Armando Manni.

They have collaborated with the University of Florence to develop a new methodology to preserve the naturally occurring antioxidants in the cocoa beans. This proprietary process produces delicious, complex chocolate that draws the full potential out of every bean.”\n\n“True to Chef Thomas Keller’s reputation for unparalleled excellence in American cuisine, K + M Chocolate’s new bean-to-bar K + M Chocolate collection reflects the Chef’s exacting quality standards and meticulous attention to detail. These single-origin chocolate bars emphasize nuanced tasting notes while custom ground beans and unique ingredients collide for whimsical flavor expressions. From Truffle Fries to 68% Dark Carenero, there’s a little something sweet for everyone. Each bar of K + M Chocolate is roasted, ground and molded by hand in small batches in Napa Valley, California. Packaged in recycled paper and compostable foil.”\n\n“K + M Extra Virgin Chocolate (the original product) employs a unique production methodology and the addition of a small amount of heart-healthy MANNI organic extra-virgin olive oil which infuses their bean-to-bar chocolate with its signature texture while boosting its antioxidant properties. The cocoa bean is naturally high in antioxidants that not only provide much of the aroma and flavor of chocolate but also offer a wide range of health benefits. Standard methods used today for turning cocoa beans into chocolate may result in the loss of 60 percent or more of those antioxidants.”\n\nThe General Manager of K + M Chocolate, Hallot Parson, is our guest.\n\n“Juliet, the new seafood-forward, Parisian-inspired restaurant and patio in Culver City, Los Angeles, is now serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Desserts include Assiette de Fromage, a selection of cheese; Chocolat Chaud, Parisian hot chocolate; Gâteau au Fromage, creme fraiche cheesecake with passion fruit gelee; and Madeleines au Beurre Noisette, brown butter madeleines and salted honey chantilly.”\n\n“The breakfast menu includes Crêpes Suzette with citrus, grand marnier and chantilly cream; Pain au Champignons with mushroom & truffle confiture and poached eggs; and Croque Madame with smoked ham, green chile bechamel and a sunny side egg; while lunch offers dishes like Carpaccio de Thon, tuna carpaccio, olives and tonnato; Aubergine Roti, roasted eggplant, white soy, and sesame; and Omelette Classique, organic pasture raised eggs, comte, and market greens.”\n\n“Juliet is a collaboration between restaurateur Rohan Talwar of IB Hospitality (Norah, Margot), and Joseph Miller and David Fishbein of Runyon Group (Platform). They’re joined by IB Hospitality Chef and Culinary Director Michael Williams, Chef Jason Gonzales, Director of Hospitality Bruce Childress and General Manager Charles Phillips, who pride themselves on providing welcoming hospitality and creating a unique guest experience.”\n\nGeneral Manager Charlie Phillips joins us with a plate of brown butter madeleines in hand.\n\nOur own Chef Andrew Gruel, the menu-maker behind the recently launched, full-service Calico Fish House (in the Sunset Beach area of Huntington Beach) and also the founder of Big Parm (New Jersey-style pizza) in the Mess Hall in Tustin provides another timely and informative “Ask the Chef” segment where Chef Andrew responds to listeners thoughtful inquiries.\n\nAs a result of the Pandemic the use of cash at businesses is way on the decline.

How do you feel about full-service restaurants not accepting cash? How about a mandatory Service Charge added to your check. Is that considered a tip? Is it appropriate to tip at a fast-food restaurant or your neighborhood donut shop? Should the gratuity be based on the pre-tax total or the amount after sales tax has been added. Confused…? We’ll ask the chef.\n\nAll of this and heaping helpings of extra deliciousness for the new year on this week’s not-to-miss show!\n\nAnne Marie Panoringan is Voice of OC’s well-informed food columnist.

His newest discovery is Orange’s Palm Market & Deli. A favorite sandwich there is the Cubini, served hot. “It’s pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles with stone ground mustard and served on potato telera bread.”\n\n“L.A.’s Landmark Restaurants: Celebrating the Legendary Locations Where Angelenos Have Dined for Generations follows in the footsteps of chef, baker and food historian George Geary’s now classic and critically acclaimed book, L.A.’s Legendary Restaurants.”\n\n“L.A.’s Landmark Restaurants is an illustrated history of over 50 famous Los Angeles restaurants from throughout the 20th century that were not featured in Geary’s first book.

Truly a love letter to Los Angeles and its world famous cuisine, L.A.’s Landmark Restaurants is sure to bring back treasured memories and knowing smiles from anyone who has dined at these fabled establishments.”\n\nChef George Geary joins us with a Philippe’s lamb dip sandwich in hand.\n\n“Cheferbly, an innovative new private dining reservation platform for private chefs and caterers, has launched in Southern California.

Cheferbly’s robust reservation and guest management system is an attractive solution for private chefs and caterers by handling everything from event promotion to credit card processing. Similarly, the platform’s streamlined booking process provides clarity to consumers through a comprehensive and visual directory of local private chefs and caterers and their bookable private dining and pop-up experiences, complete with courses, pricing, and booking details.”\n\n“The process for booking catered dinners was so complicated, time-consuming, and seemingly antiquated, given restaurant reservations can be made with the click of a button,” adds Kim. “I wanted to simplify the relationship between private chefs and consumers by creating a solution that would make their service accessible to everyone. Cheferbly was created to bridge that gap.”\n\n“Kim has assembled an all-star roster of local culinary talent for the platform’s debut in Southern California last November. Users can peruse various multi-course private dining offerings, from opulent omakase experiences to in-depth explorations of global, regional, and seasonal cuisines.”\n\nCheferbly’s founder, Kevin Kim, joins us.\n\nOur own Chef Andrew Gruel, the menu-maker behind the recently launched, full-service Calico Fish House (in Huntington Beach) and also the founder of Big Parm (New Jersey-style pizza) in the Mess Hall in Tustin provides another timely and informative “Ask the Chef” segment where Chef Andrew responds to listeners thoughtful inquiries.\n\nHow do you feel about full-service restaurants not accepting cash?
