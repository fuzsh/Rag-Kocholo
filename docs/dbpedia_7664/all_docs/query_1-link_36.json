        "text": "From Voice of OC: The state Supreme Court has rejected a request by Voice of OC and open-government advocates Californians Aware to review a gag order Orange County government leaders imposed on themselves so they wouldn’t have to release information regarding allegations of sex abuse by a top county official.\n\nThe case involved a Voice of OC request under the California Public Records Act for documents that would show what top county officials knew about allegations that former Public Works executive Carlos Bustamante sexually assaulted female employees.\n\nOpponents of the gag order fear the tactic employed by Orange County leaders will become a tool statewide for government officials who want to avoid complying with the 45-year-old Public Records Act.\n\nVisit Voice of OC for more. Also see Voice of OC asking California Supreme Court to hear records case for more background.\n\nThe Californians Aware and the First Amendment Coalition are members of NFOIC. –eds\n\n======"
