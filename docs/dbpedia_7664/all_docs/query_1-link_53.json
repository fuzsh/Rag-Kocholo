This is evident through the work of the Association, which includes public employee public employer pension stabilization, homelessness, housing and economic development, and residential recovery reform–issues that transcend all thirty-four Orange County cities. ACC-OC not only provides a place to come together to solve problems and work collaboratively, but also offers a mechanism that supports regional efforts that create financial and operational efficiencies.\n\n​"
