        "text": "Observatory OC History\n\nOrange County’s premier small-to-midsize venue, Observatory OC took over in 2011 what was once the Galaxy Concert Theatre. Since its inception, Observatory OC has cemented itself as a consistent tour stop between Los Angeles and San Diego for the best acts in rock, hip-hop and more. Located in Santa Ana, the 1,000-capacity venue also features the adjacent 250-person Constellation Room where you can catch the next big acts before they blow up.\n\nObservatory OC Performers\n\nAs soon as the Observatory OC opened its doors, no time was wasted in bringing the best of what’s next to the stage. Foster The People played the first show in 2011, and soon thereafter the venue hosted concerts from Silversun Pickups, Devo, Jenny Lewis, Tyga, and the final two shows of OC-punk stalwarts Thrice’s farewell tour. Today, Observatory OC brings artists to Santa Ana who could easily play larger rooms — think Snoop Dogg, Poolside, Sleater-Kinney, Cage The Elephant and Banks.\n\nPlanning Your Visit to Observatory OC\n\nLess than a mile from the I-405 Harbor Blvd exit, Observatory OC is easy to get to and has general paid parking. Once in the door, you’ll find the large outdoor patio makes for a great meet-up point for drinks or conversation. Plentiful food options are on-site and include the O burger or O dog, grilled cheese, fries, plus vegetarian fare like edamame, vegan chili or avocado mash. Nearby choices for before or after a show include Byblos Mediterranean Deli for shawarma and falafel, Del Taco for fast-food Mexican and The Arc for sit-down pub grub.\n\nObservatory OC Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are the parking options at Observatory OC?\n\nGeneral paid parking is available, and limited street parking is nearby as well.\n\nDoes Observatory OC serve food?\n\nYes, there is gastropub fare alongside beer, wine and liquor.\n\nWhat are the seating options at Observatory OC?\n\nThe Observatory is a general-admission venue, but info on premium seating and bottle service can be found here.
