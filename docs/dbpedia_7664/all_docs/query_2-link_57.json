I got him!\"\n\nAt approximately 7:48 p.m. ET, Brough went into the water and carried the barefooted boy back to dry land.\n\n\"Wanna go see your parents?\" a deputy asked.\n\nThe boy was medically cleared and returned to his family, the sheriff's office said, which noted its deputies have received training \"to help prepare for a wide variety of calls involving people with autism, including missing children.\""
