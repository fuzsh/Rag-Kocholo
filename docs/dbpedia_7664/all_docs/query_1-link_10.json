        "text": "Our mission is to hold government agencies, elected officials and other power brokers in Orange County accountable through investigative news coverage. And to be a catalyst in the community for a robust and sophisticated discourse on local politics and government. Voice of OC reporters deploy through a geographically based beat structure with each reporter covering several Orange County cities. In many respects, Voice of OC reporters cover their beats like good municipal reporters have always covered city halls. But our approach goes significantly beyond a standard newsroom municipal coverage plan. First and foremost, Voice of OC focuses on accountability in government, not the process of government. This means that our stories are driven not by meetings or events, but by the deep understanding our reporters and editors have of the issues that local governments face. Voice of OC covers the vexing issues that most challenge modern society â€“ things like homelessness, development and the environment. The result of this reporting is a regular series of actionable intelligence reports for the public. Our passion for government and politics is not limited to our news pages -- Voice of OC hosts debates, forums and other events that bring residents and policymakers together. The combination of our news coverage and events make for a level of civic participation that until now the residents of Orange County have never had, but have sorely needed.\n\nView Top Employees from Voice of OC"
