        "text": "As one of the southernmost counties in the state, Orange County remains the premier region for California beach vacations. There’s no denying that the Pacific Ocean, palm trees and glamour draw visitors to our doorstep every day.\n\nKnown as “The OC,” Orange County is not Los Angeles—an important distinction for us locals—though we live just below the larger-than-life city. Orange County encompasses Huntington Beach, Anaheim (aka Disneyland), Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, San Juan Capistrano, Costa Mesa, Buena Park, Irvine and Santa Ana.\n\nThe Orange County region embraces a beach lifestyle that’s distinct from our metropolitan neighbors like San Diego, and Dana Point’s laid-back surfer vibes and sophisticated accommodations are an amalgamation of everything our region has to offer visitors.\n\nWe set ourselves apart from our SoCal siblings with our attitude. We pride ourselves on being approachable—the cool guy at a bar with all the best tips on where to go surfing or grab the freshest seafood. We are comfortable with who we are, where we are. Legends were made here. Cultures were started. And when you’re here, you’re one of us."
