        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nA thwack! Rang against the lab walls, startling Mila. She quickly comprised herself before she could drop her clipboard.\n\n“Don’t waste my time. Tell Akande that if he wants more promising results, he needs to bring me better subjects. Get out of my face.”\n\nMoira O’Deorain growled, in her low, powerful voice. The Doctor shooed off the Talon employee who scurried off holding his face, not daring to show weakness in front of the intimidating woman. She turned around and sighed, her long nails narrowly avoiding her eyeballs as she rubbed her temple.\n\n“You’d think he would know by now I do my best work on full grown specimens, not this.. shit.” She looked towards the side of the lab holding a variety of small animals, mainly mice and monkeys. Since Amelie La’Croix, Moira hasn’t been able to find any more human specimens to further her research in advancing the human race.\n\nMila cleared her throat, nodding her head in agreement. When she was younger she never thought she’d be in the clutches of the terrorist organization Talon, but as she grew older, she realized she hated the constraint the Hippocratic Oath and the Geneva Convention imposed on her studies. As she worked on her doctorate, her research was short of anything interesting, forced to study things of which she had no intrigue. At least she finished her thesis in a timely fashion, no matter how boring and un- revolutionizing it was.\n\nIt wasn’t until she accepted the hand of Doctor O’Deorain, who overheard her interest in “unethical” genetics at a Biomed conference. That was three years ago, and here she was in the shadows as the doctor’s right hand assistant and collaborator. Her reminiscing was cut short when Moira picked up the papers on the nearby desk.\n\n“Well it looks like a distraction has found us, Mila. Go find Amelie, its time for her checkup.”\n\n“Yes, Doctor.”\n\nMila replied, walking out the automated door into the grey hallway. As her heeled shoes clicked across the floor, she acknowledged her fellow associates. The halls of Talon were commonly quiet, except for footsteps and hushed conversations. She appreciated this aspect of the organization, as she quickly grew tired of pretending to care about her colleague’s subpar work. As she neared the housing quarters, she felt a light breeze flow through her hair.\n\nWithout hesitation, she unholstered her mandatory pistol and whipped around, aiming it at seemingly nothing. A small laugh could be heard as Sombra uncloaked herself with her arms up, playfully smirking at the scientist.\n\n“You know you still have mass when you are invisible, right?”\n\n“Well, excuse me for having some fun, chica.”\n\n“I could fix that problem for you. You wouldn’t have to use that silly tech you parade around in.”\n\nMila scoffed, lowering her gun and putting it away, turning towards the doors. Sombra scoffed, clearly offended.\n\n“And end up like Reyes? Hell no. You guys already have one half dead Mexican, any more and it’ll be like Dia De Los Meurtos up in here!”\n\nSombra joked, but behind her humor Mila could tell she was more than serious about declining her offer. Mila shrugged,\n\n“Your loss. The Doctor has been eyeing you lately.” Sombra slightly jumped, a strained smile on her face.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, sure thing.”\n\nIt wasn’t until she saw Mila’s blank stare that she quietly said,\n\n“Are you serious…?”\n\nMila couldn’t help but laugh and shake her head, pushing the doors open to make her way towards Amelie’s room. She left Sombra behind, failing to see the hacker’s relieved and annoyed expression. Mila knocked on Amelie’s door, knowing the assassin to be more than annoyed at surprise visitors. The door opened with a click, the purple girl standing over Mila.\n\n“Good morning. The Doctor requests you.”\n\nAmelie just gave a simple nod and closed the door behind her as she followed Mila to the lab. Amelie was the master of staying quiet in these halls. Mila didnt mind, it made the walk go by faster to her and she was able to check her lab notes with full attention. As they entered the room, Moiras eyes looked up for a fraction of a second before returning to her clipboard.\n\n“Hello, LaCroix. Don’t make me tell you what you already know.”\n\nAmelie just softly grunted and sat herself in the chair Moira had put in the middle of the room. Moira finally got up from her spot and had a recorder with her, to which she said,\n\n“Experiment Widowmaker, log 348.”"
