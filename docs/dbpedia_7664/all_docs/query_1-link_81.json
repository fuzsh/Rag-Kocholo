        "text": "Congratulations, we did it! After many years here at Cal State Fullerton, our journey comes to an end. Can you believe it?\n\nI am excited, but I am also a little sad at the same time. I have begun clinging to the little things that I used to take for granted. For example, I’m going to miss being able to walk to 85 °C between classes for a quick coffee break and then having to stand awkwardly in a corridor of Dan Black Hall to enjoy that coffee because we can’t bring drinks into the research lab.\n\nI’m going to miss going to class and catching up with friends. I’ll miss the excitement of registering for new classes, and I’m even going to miss mandatory advising! I am going to miss it all.\n\nBy now, we are all familiar with that standard phrase written in every syllabus: incorporate 25-35 hours of study time per week, in order to be successful students in the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. It’s very likely an understatement, but it is still embedded in our brains. So, those students who did the bare minimum, only 25 hours of study time per week, for four years, have spent 3,200 hours studying. 3,200 hours! That’s more than 133 days, which would be like studying without breaks for 4 1/2 months.\n\nThose of us who took summer classes, winter intersession, or an extra year have studied thousands of hours more. These countless hours that we have spent pulling all-nighters, struggling in office hours or slaving away in the lab have all been worth it. They have all culminated in this moment. Yet, graduation is not about the diploma. Today is about reflecting and celebrating our amazing academic careers.\n\nGetting here wasn’t easy. We all made sacrifices to chase this dream — time with loved ones, time with friends or maybe just time with ourselves. However, this process has allowed us to bloom and to blossom. This incredible journey at Cal State Fullerton has taken us awkward teenagers and lonely transfer students and transformed us into confident critical thinkers, researchers and scientists. It has woven us into a close-knit scientific community.\n\nI encourage you all to let your guard down and to really embrace and savor this feeling — the feeling of the day. I invite you to step out of your comfort zone today. As the door closes here at Cal State Fullerton, the door of the real world opens and a new chapter begins, and that change can be scary. But I know Cal State Fullerton has prepared us well.\n\nSo, allow the fear of the unknown to strengthen you, and know that you will always have this community to support you. We all have shared unforgettable moments here over the years — for some of us maybe these moments include passing Professor Tao’s physical chemistry class, or maybe acing a big test, or scoring a high GPA … maybe making new friends or even meeting your future husband or wife. Cherish these moments that make you smile and keep them safe in your heart.\n\nI know how amazingly smart and dedicated you all are. Graduating from this college is no easy task; biologists, chemists, biochemists, geologists, mathematicians and physicists — we are the ones who will change the world.\n\nSome of you may become astronauts, microbiologists, dentists, pharmacists, doctors, professors and teachers; others may win Nobel Prizes and uproot the ways we see the world.\n\nI know it hasn’t been easy. I remember a handful of times that I felt like giving up, like maybe an academic career in science was out of my league and wasn’t for me. I’m sure we have all had moments like that. We would not be here today if it weren’t for the help of some very special individuals, and I appreciate the chance to say “thank you” to everyone who has contributed to our current and future successes.\n\nTo all the professors and mentors who instilled in us a thirst for knowledge, we thank you. To all of the administrators and staff who kept things running smoothly behind the scenes, we thank you. To all of the parents, grandparents, siblings and loved ones who stood by us and supported our every step along this rigorous academic path, thank you. To friends who were there for study sessions, coffee breaks and comic relief, thank you. Without all of you, none of us would be here today.\n\nA math professor here once told me something that he never realized would make such an impact on my life. He told me “there is something in the world that you’re the best at.” And that really struck me. We are so used to being told that there will always be someone stronger, or younger, or faster, someone prettier or smarter. But think about it… if his notion is true, it means that you truly are the best at something. So I urge you to go out and find it. Be bold, be ambitious and continue to reach for the stars.\n\nBrenna Biggs, a summa cum laude member of the Class of 2015, earned a bachelor of science degree in chemistry. This is adapted from her senior address delivered at commencement ceremonies May 17. Her work to build a device that coverts carbon dioxide to energy by coupling solar power with a direct formate fuel cell earned her a first-place finish in the 2015 CSUF Student Research Competition and a second-place award in the CSU competition that followed. She is bound for graduate school in the fall."
