Our corporate partners help make this possible.\n\n“There is real fear of not having the right words, or the resources, or the wisdom to serve well, but as I follow God and reach out to others as He has asked us to, I find the joy of Him supplying and growing me in each of those areas.”\n\n– Lisa Mistiuk, volunteer"
