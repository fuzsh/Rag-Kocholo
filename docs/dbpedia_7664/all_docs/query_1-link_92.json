        "text": "Since Jacqueline Laurita left New Jersey for the West Coast, she's been sharing what her life in California looks like these days. But if fans are still wondering \"What happened to Jacqueline Laurita?\" the answer is, she and her family are enjoying fun in the sun in Orange County, where they currently reside.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey alum recently shed some light on her life in Southern California, including how she's all about living in the moment these days. \"I’ve met some really sweet people here in Orange County so far!\" she shared in a recent Instagram post. \"I haven’t taken pictures with everyone I’ve hung out with because sometimes I’m just too busy enjoying the moment that I forget to take pictures, but here’s a few moments I have that I thought I’d share.\"\n\nThose people include OC alums Gretchen Rossi and Peggy Taneous. She also shared a photo of a meetup she had with RHONJ's Teresa Giudice. Her life looks to be all about embracing the old and the new these days!\n\nWhat Happened to Jacqueline Laurita?\n\nSince she stepped away from RHONJ, Jacqueline spent some time living in Las Vegas and then, of course, moved to California. In fact, her days are filled with quality time with her family (including her husband Chris Laurita, and their two sons, Christopher \"CJ\" and Nicholas), as well as outings to check out local attractions.\n\n\"Nick had a great time checking out Old World Village in Huntington Beach today with Nana, Grandpa, [Chris] and I!\" she shared recently on Instagram about a recent family outing. \"He especially loved the Schnitzel and the German candy! He was such a good boy there! He loves an adventure and his weekend drives!\"\n\nThe family has also been taking in other local sights and art. \"We took my parents to the @sawdustartfestival in Laguna! Lots of hand-crafted art, crafts, food, drinks and music,\" she wrote. \"Go and enjoy!\"\n\nAs it turns out, going out is the new normal for the RHONJ alum. During a June appearance on Teresa's podcast, Turning the Tables, Jacqueline revealed the \"major change\" she's made since moving to Orange County, California: \"I have been going out more here than I have anywhere else in my entire life. Now we go out all the time.\"\n\nWatch new episodes of The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Sundays at 9/8c on Bravo. Stream the next day on Peacock."
