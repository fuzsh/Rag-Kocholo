Our 2024 event provides attendees valuable opportunities to connect and network with like-minded professionals across Orange County and local Girl Scouts.\n\n2024 Theme: Mental Wellness – Balance in Your Life\n\nThe last decade has seen an unprecedented rise in mental health problems among young women and girls. Add to that the pandemic and the disproportionate impact it has had on women. Our 2024 event will explore how prioritizing good mental health is about creating balance in your life. When your career, relationships, and self are attended to, then your well-being and personal satisfaction are maintained. We’ll look at how we can rethink, redesign, and achieve workplaces that promote and inspire mental wellness for women, so that today’s girls grow up to enter workplaces that champion their ability to live their best lives.\n\nKeynote: Tara Lipinski, NBC Figure Skating and Olympic Analyst/Host, Olympic Gold Medalist, Influencer\n\nAt just 15 years old, Lipinski made history and gained international recognition as the youngest Olympic gold medalist in the Winter Games. The iconic Olympian thrived in the high-pressure world of competitive sports and understands the importance of mental wellness. Beyond figure skating, Lipinski has written two inspirational books and works as an analyst for NBC, covering figure skating and the Winter Olympic Games. A new mom, Lipinski recently went public with her 5-year struggle with infertility before welcoming her daughter through surrogacy. She is a vocal advocate for mental health awareness. Read More.\n\nPanel Discussion:\n\nA panel of high school-age Girl Scouts will share their “take action” projects around Mental Wellness and their hopes for future workplaces and relationships that promote women’s wellness and inspire our female leaders, change-makers, and cure-finders."
