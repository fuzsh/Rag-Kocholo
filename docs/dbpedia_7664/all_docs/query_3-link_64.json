        "text": "The OC Food Bank, a program of Community Action Partnership of Orange County, unites communities to end hunger and malnutrition by partnering with more than 300 local charities, soup kitchens and community organizations. Through donated food, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) commodities and purchased food, and the generous support of individuals we are able to support nonprofit agencies in Orange County serving low-income families and individuals. In a typical year, the food bank distributes more than 23 million pounds of food. In June 2020, we have increased the pounds of food distributed by 59% compared to this time last year. The OC Food Bank partnered with Power of One Foundation to set up weekly mass drive-thru distributions. In August 2020 we acknowledged serving 1 million people affected by the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 and we anticipate the need will continue to grow.\n\nFor questions or additional assistance, please email info@capoc.org\n\n“Clementine” the Mobile Food Trolley is a customized mobile grocery store on wheels that serves low-income families throughout Orange County. Uniquely designed as a French Market, with affirmative hand painted messages throughout the trolley is intended to remove the stigma of shopping at a food pantry, while also traveling to food deserts to ensure nutritious, healthy fruit, vegetables and staple items are available to low income families and their young children.\n\nQualifications: Families must have minor children in the household.\n\nClick here to learn more about Clementine.\n\n2024 Calendar\n\nOur Farm 2 Family program bridges the gap between our state’s surplus produce and people in need. Farmers ship surplus produce directly from the fields to the food bank, and we distribute it through our network of schools, churches, senior centers and other community venues. The Giving Farm, an 8-acre farm located at Westminster High School provides locally grown produce that students and community volunteers are able to harvest. Food grown at the Giving Farm is donated to the OC Food Bank and our Farm 2 Family program.\n\nOur agency partners help distribute food to people in need right in their neighborhoods. Thanks to more than 300 hunger-fighting agencies, we are able to help feed the need in Orange County.\n\nAgency partners: click “connect with us” below for forms\n\nBefore the pandemic slammed Orange County with job losses in our once-thriving travel, tourism and hospitality industries, there were nearly 456,000 people at risk of hunger each month. As of June 2020, that number has increased by 4x per month. This population consists of families, children, seniors, the newly vulnerable impacted by COVID-19 job losses and those recovering from medical expenses or disabilities. Hunger affects people of every age, race, ethnic group and neighborhood. In some families, hunger is a result of a sudden emergency or crisis, but for many marginalized or low-income OC residents, hunger has become a long- term condition of poverty.\n\nNon-Discrimination Statement\n\nIn accordance with Federal civil rights law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) civil rights regulations and policies, the USDA, its Agencies, offices, and employees, and institutions participating in or administering USDA programs are prohibited from discriminating based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity (including gender expression), sexual orientation, disability, age, marital status, family/parental status, income derived from a public assistance program, political beliefs, or reprisal or retaliation for prior civil rights activity, in any program or activity conducted or funded by USDA (not all bases apply to all programs).
