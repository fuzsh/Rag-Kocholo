Happy campers can also enjoy such outdoor activities as playgrounds, beach volleyball, boat ramps, hiking, biking, canoeing, swimming, springs and fishing.\n\n“Camping is an inexpensive way to unwind from the day-to-day stressors and connect with nature,” said Matt Suedemeyer, Division Manager, Parks & Recreation.\n\nMore and more families and individuals are seeking what’s called a “calm-cation” a term coined by Campspot, an online marketplace for family campgrounds, cabins, glamping and RV destinations.\n\nOrange County campgrounds provide a calming oasis for those seeking fresh air, gorgeous landscapes and a tranquil setting in Central Florida.\n\nIndividual, family and group camping is offered at Clarcona Horse Park, Kelly Park/Camp Joy, Magnolia Park, Moss Park and Trimble Park – with individual site fees starting at $18 for county residents.\n\nCampsites are offered on a first-come first-served basis. Online reservations are available 45 days in advance of arrival date through the Online Camping reservation system.\n\nAccording to Orange County, here are a few things to know before you go:\n\nRegistered pets are welcome at Clarcona, Magnolia and Trimble Parks\n\nCheck-in time is 2 p.m.; check-out time is noon\n\nGroup camping is tent only, no electric hookups or vehicles\n\nCampsites vary in size, so be mindful with your recreational vehicles\n\nBe aware of bears, gators and snakes in the wild\n\nSome parks require additional entrance fees\n\nQuiet hours are in effect from 10pm-8am\n\nNote restrictions on low-speed vehicle usage in parks\n\nAsk about senior citizen and active military discounts"
