        "text": "About the Voice Options program\n\nThrough a partnership with the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) Deaf and Disabled Telecommunications Program (DDTP) , the California Department of Rehabilitation’s (DOR) Voice Options program provides eligible Californians who are unable to speak, or who have difficulty speaking, with a free speech-generating device. The goal of this program is to ensure full and equal telephone communications access for all Californians with disabilities.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a speech-generating application, it is imperative to select one that highlights your strengths, skills, and fully meets your needs without leaving you feeling restricted. Through this program, any eligible Californian referred to a Voice Options provider will have the opportunity to test six different speech-generating applications for up to 14 days. The six applications that will be provided are:\n\nGoTalk NOW Plus\n\nLAMP Words for Life\n\nPredictable\n\nProloquo2Go\n\nProloquo4Text\n\nTouchChat HD with WordPower\n\nOnce the trial period has ended, the user will exchange the borrowed iPad for a new one with their preferred speech-generating application already loaded and ready to go.\n\nHow to Get Started:"
