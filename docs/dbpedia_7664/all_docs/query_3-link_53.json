        "text": "Voice of OC – Irvine Takes No Action on Veterans Cemetery, Opening Door for Possible Anaheim Site\n\nThe Voice of OC covered the marathon Irvine City Council meeting that started on Tuesday, June 22, 2021 at 4PM and ended on Wednesday, June 23, 2021 at almost 1:00AM.\n\n“After hours of discussion, the Irvine City Council early Wednesday opted against picking a site for a veterans cemetery in the city, effectively ending nearly a decade’s worth of debate and planning with council members not taking a vote on the issue.”\n\nTo read the entire Voice of OC article click below:\n\nIrvine Takes No Action on Veterans Cemetery, Opening Door for Possible Anaheim Site\n\nThe real winner may ultimately be Five Point which has the first right of refusal for the purchase of the ARDA site.\n\nWill the City keep title to the property until the Veterans’ Cemetery is officially located outside of Irvine?\n\nWill the city take legal action to remove the land use requirement when/if the Cemetery is located elsewhere?\n\nWhat will the city do with the ARDA property?"
