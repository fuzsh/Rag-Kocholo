Previously, he reported for the Voice of OC, where his investigative work prompted a push by city leaders to overhaul their police department manual. Before that, he was a news editor for the Daily Titan, a completely independent student newspaper at his alma mater, Cal State Fullerton.\n\nHe aims through his writing to explore what it means to be a Californian, and enjoys taking walks for hours on end through different cities and public parks."
