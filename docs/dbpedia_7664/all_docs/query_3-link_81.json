        "text": "Yahoo! Life, August 13, 2024\n\nAustralians outlive Americans by up to 5 years, study finds. Here are 5 things we can learn from them\n\n“We pride ourselves on spending a huge amount of money on health care and the health care system in the U.S., but we have a very fragmented health care system. Some people in this country are going to get the very best health care that’s available globally, and other people have no health care at all — that’s playing heavily into what we’re seeing here.” (Bernadette Boden-Albala)\n\nMarketplace, August 9, 2024\n\nThe Olympic Village offers free health care. Here’s how much it would cost in the U.S.\n\n“Not everyone here is insured, and so different people face different prices. People who do have good health insurance coverage often are paying very low out-of-pocket amounts for their health care. And then people who don’t have health insurance coverage could be subject to really high, really burdensome costs that could really be devastating if you’re on a lower income.” (Brandy Lipton)"
