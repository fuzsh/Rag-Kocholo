        "text": "Where it fails is in its documentary approach at portraying the mental aftermath of a tragedy and the dearth of plausible satisfaction for the conclusion.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Nov 27, 2020\n\nReservation Road, in its offhanded way, depicts the world of the reasonably affluent 21st-century American more accurately than any other recent film I can think of.\n\nFull Review | Oct 18, 2018\n\nWhat did we do to deserve these grief-counselor filmmakers? They seem to think they can express something that we cannot, and they're so persistent. It's enough to make us want to run away from home.\n\nFull Review | Apr 28, 2011\n\nUltimately devolves into a Crime and Punishment-esque moral exercise, with heavy-handed social commentaries and a rough ending that left me with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/10 | Aug 26, 2008\n\nReservation Road, where the event central to this story takes place, is a symbolic crossroads for two families in this engaging drama about a hit and run accident and its aftermath.\n\nFull Review | Aug 3, 2008\n\nWould-be screenwriters are advised to catch Reservation Road on cable as it provides an object lesson of three awful script clichés that are to be avoided at all costs.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | May 1, 2008\n\nUm drama barato e maniqueísta que apela para truques narrativos rasos a fim de arrancar lágrimas do espectador e, assim, comprovar o próprio valor.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Mar 28, 2008\n\nThe filmmaker, whether in Rwanda or here at home, admirably weighs the difficult convictions and facile frailties of human nature, and those conflicting impulses towards cowardice and revenge or a far more arduous courage and honor, on a troubled planet.\n\nFull Review | Jan 26, 2008\n\nGeorge's thriller reveals itself to be nothing more than a by the numbers melodrama that's only saved by the excellent performances...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 4, 2008\n\nA disappointing drama featuring paper thin female characters is rescued only by a superb performance from Mark Ruffalo.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Dec 14, 2007\n\nGeorge sustains this lightweight soap opera with the predictable pap of a Lifetime channel movie...this particular Road is certainly under construction.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Dec 6, 2007\n\nIt's a gripping enough subject matter that isn't exactly given an engaging or focused enough screenplay to be as powerful as it so desperately strives for.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Dec 5, 2007"
