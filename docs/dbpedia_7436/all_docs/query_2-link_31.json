        "text": "Some of us love to shed tears. I’m not sure how to take the critics, some like the storyline and acting, others think its maudlin. Check out this full list of today’s reviews right here or else click on good ones from Entertainment Weekly and Variety. In the other camp, the New York Post reviewer thinks the movie is too contrived. Well, you be the judge.\n\nAs much as I want to see Reservation Road — and boy do I love the cast — there is a part of me that is worried it might be just a little bit depressing. I haven’t yet read the book but the concept — two innocent families caught in a brain chilling tragedy that really, could happen to anyone — makes me just a bit anxious. After all, this is a movie with no monsters or crazy special affects. It’s a simple drama full of raw, pure emotion exploring the topics of revenge and forgiveness and just how far we, as humans are capable of going with each.\n\nNot sure Terry George, director of the soon to be released Reservation Road, could make a bad movie. After all, this is the man who directed and wrote Hotel Rwanda, netting the gorgeous Sophie Okonedo a supporting actress nomination from Oscar himself. With other credits including: The Boxer, Hart’s War and In the Name of the Father, among others, Terry George is certainly a director to be reckoned with. I can’t wait to see what he has done with the prime material and great actors in this next winning effort.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is always such a mystery to me. We never read much about his personal life, and he is somewhat obscure in interviews. It all gives him a real layer of mystery on top of the good looks and acting chops. I loved his last turn as Johnny Cash in Stand By your Man — I never thought Joaquin would be able to pull that one off. That’s why I love this newest role of his as a tormented dad in Reservation Road. It’s great to see him in a slightly more grown up way, not being a Roman prince or country singer. Just a dad dealing with a terrible tragedy.\n\nI really, do. Ever since he first appeared with Laura Linney in “You Can Count On Me” as the somewhat dysfunctional younger brother of the main character, I have been a big fan of his. I also like that he named his first son Keen, after spending many weeks in hot debate over it (the hospital actually called him and said they would put baby boy Ruffalo on the birth certificate if Mark and his wife did not make a real decision about the name). Anyway, this guy has it all: looks, brains and a certain humility not often found in Tinseltown. I loved this interview with Terry Gross on NPRs Fresh Air.\n\nSeriously, where has Mira Sorvino been? After her star-making performance and supporting actress Oscar win with Woody Allen’s Mighty Aphrodite, she could not seem to pick a winning movie. I believe Reservation Road could mark a turning point for her. Great cast, great story. great drama. In the movie, she plays a more mature mother battling her own demons. I’d really like to see this do wonders for her career. Maybe we could be looking at the buzz heating up for Mira again….\n\nDrawn to playing somewhat darker roles these days–remember her in “The House of Sand and Fog?” — Jennifer Connelly appears to be both a dark, mysterious beauty along with having the brains to play roles of great depth and intrigue. Married to gorgeous Brit actor Paul Bettany and mother to two young boys, she appears to be the perfect choice to play the mother of a child killed in a hit and run in Reservation Road. Link here for even more Jennifer Connelly.\n\nJust so you don’t get stars in your eyes, keep in mind that Reservation Road’s from an independent film studio. That means it not only has great actors but comes in on budget!\n\nYes, we all want to see Joaquin, Mark, Jennifer and Mira. So go the Studio site right now."
