These themes can even help teach viewers lessons about pet ownership.\n\nEngaging Plot\n\nLike all dogs, all dog movies are different! The one thing the best dog movies have in common is an engaging plot – no matter the film’s content, it needs to keep viewers invested. A mix of adventure, humor, drama and heartwarming moments is a recipe for a dog movie masterpiece!\n\nMemorable Dog Characters\n\nLassie. Beethoven. Old Yeller. These are just a few of the characters from dog movies who have become pop culture icons, beloved by movie-watchers of all ages.

It’s extremely important to us that any potential pet pawrent knows what it takes to own a dog and give them the best life pawsible.\n\nCommunication and Understanding\n\nLady and the Tramp and 101 Dalmatians are two of the best dog films that show the importance of understanding and communicating with dogs.
