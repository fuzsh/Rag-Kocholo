Old and young alike – you’ll find yourself grinning from ear to ear as you step onto this magic field in Dyersville, Iowa.\n\nBaseballism started as a youth baseball camp focused on the\n\nfundamentals of the game as well as the life lessons learned on the\n\ndiamond. In 2011, Baseballism evolved into a premium lifestyle apparel brand specializing in shirts, hats, and accessories all centered\n\naround the love of the game. Baseballism has a retail location at the\n\nField of Dreams movie site and carries all official Field of Dreams\n\napparel.\n\nWhile there is construction underway on our expansion project, we want to assure you that the Field of Dreams Movie Site will remain open to the public from April 1-Oct. 31 in 2024. The work being done is on the other side of our expansive 300-acre site, and will not cause safety concerns or impede your enjoyment of all the Field has to offer. While the corn is the star of the Field of Dreams, it is planted and harvested according to what is best for the success of the crop. We cannot guarantee the presence of corn at the beginning or at the end of our season."
