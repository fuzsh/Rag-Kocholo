        "text": "Director Terry George's adaptation of the John Burnham Schwartz novel Reservation Road is a thoughtful and often compelling drama about grief, anger and revenge featuring strong lead performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo as two fathers whose lives are irrevocably linked and altered one fateful night.\n\nConnecticut college professor Ethan Learner (Phoenix), his wife Grace (Jennifer Connelly), daughter Emma (Elle Fanning) and young son Josh (Sean Curley) are coming home from Josh's recital when they stop for gas along Reservation Road. Also driving down the poorly lit country road is lawyer Dwight Arno (Mark Ruffalo), a divorced dad bringing his boy Lucas (Eddie Alderson) back to his mother's (Mira Sorvino) after a Red Sox game.\n\nDwight gets distracted by his cell phone just long enough for a tragic accident to occur, which results in the death of Josh. Dwight compounds his fatal error, however, by fleeing the scene, telling his startled and slightly injured son that he hit a log. Ethan witnesses the hit-and-run, but can't make out the details of the SUV clearly enough to be of much help to the police.\n\nWhen it becomes apparent that his son's killer will get away, Ethan grows embittered, haunted and withdrawn. His relationship with Grace deteriorates as he seeks out solace in victims' groups and becomes obsessed with attaining justice. Even his lawyers don't see much hope for his case but then Ethan's memories of that night return more clearly, leading him to plot a terrible revenge.\n\nReservation Road is an actor's movie and it's these strong performances that lift the film above TV movie fare. Phoenix gives one of his most nuanced performances yet, offering a subtle but powerful portrayal of an everyman who slowly becomes a ticking time bomb. Ruffalo is equally impressive, finding the humanity in the deeply flawed Dwight.\n\nDwight is at turns both weak and strong, a good and doting dad who could nevertheless leave another man's son to die on the side of the road. Dwight is cowardly, but he realizes that he must do the right thing and turn himself in. His situation, however, becomes more complicated as the story progresses and the possibility of getting away with it may prove too tempting to resist. Ruffalo makes Dwight a sympathetic sinner even at his most fallible.\n\nAlthough she gets a couple of scenes to sink her teeth into, Connelly is largely relegated to playing the suffering wife. Grace harbors some guilt over the accident, but that is resolved fairly quickly and the emphasis in the story becomes the men. Likewise, Sorvino has a rather thankless and small role as Dwight's ex-wife, who also so happens to be the Learner kids' music teacher.\n\nGeorge keeps you invested in these painfully human characters -- there is a sober and lasting \"there but for the grace of God go I\" resonance to the whole affair -- even as the story begins to meander towards its inevitable outcome.\n\n3.5 out of 5 Stars, 7/10 Score"
