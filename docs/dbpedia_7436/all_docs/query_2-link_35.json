        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy is Glacier National Park piloting a temporary vehicle reservation system?\n\nHow do I get a vehicle reservation?\n\nHow can I see the park without a vehicle reservation?\n\nHow do I prove I have a vehicle reservation?\n\nCan someone else make a reservation for me on my behalf?\n\nDo I also need a Park Pass or Entrance Pass in addition to a vehicle reservation?\n\nHow do I get a first come, first served campground in a vehicle reservation area?\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation if I have booked a tour or commercial activity inside a vehicle reservation area?\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation if I have booked a hotel or campsite inside a vehicle reservation area?\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation for a motorcycle or an e-bike?\n\nHow many vehicle reservations are being released per day?\n\nHow does Glacier National Park determine the number of vehicle reservations to make available during each release?\n\nWhere did 2023 vehicle reservations sell out the fastest and how quickly?\n\nThe park is reporting around 3 million recreation visits each year. The number of vehicle reservations being released does not represent this number. Why is that?\n\nVehicle Reservation Communication Toolkit\n\nWhy is Glacier National Park piloting a temporary vehicle reservation system?\n\nThere are two issues driving the pilot: impacts to resources and impacts to visitors. These impacts became more apparent with the dramatic increase of about 1.5 million annual recreation visits from 2008 to 2017.\n\nResource impacts like vegetation loss and braiding trail systems are common in areas of high use. Visitor experience quality is also being affected as sustained, high levels of use become common. Visitor access to the park, parking areas, and trailheads has been unpredictable and frustrating for visitors as the park implements unplanned closures to address these issues. Visitor safety becomes an issue when emergency vehicles are not able to respond efficiently due to congestion. The pilot vehicle reservation system spreads visitation throughout the day during peak hours and provides a measure of certainty and safety to visitors.\n\nWe will gather visitor use data and refine strategies throughout the summers. This data will help to inform future public and stakeholder engagement as we work towards long term strategies and solutions to balance resource protection and quality visitor experiences at Glacier.\n\nRead more about these efforts on the park's Visitor Use Management Page.\n\nHow do I get a vehicle reservation?\n\nVehicle reservations will be available on www.recreation.gov, the Recreation.gov mobile app, or the Recreation.gov Call Center (Reservation Line: 877-444-6777). Each of the specified areas of the park will require a separate vehicle reservation. Visitors will need to set up an account on Recreation.gov to obtain vehicle reservations. The only cost associated with booking a vehicle reservation is a $2 Recreation.gov processing fee.\n\nVehicle reservations will be available through two booking windows, 120 days in advance and the day before.\n\nA portion of reservations will be available 120 days or approximately four months advance, starting on January 25, 2024, at 8 am MST on a daily rolling basis. This means that on January 25, vehicle reservations will be released for May 24, 2024, on January 26, vehicle reservations will be released for May 25, 2024, and so on.\n\nThe remaining vehicle reservations will be available at 7 pm MDT for next-day entry starting on May 23, 2024. This will occur on a daily rolling basis. This means that on May 23, the remaining vehicle reservations will be released for May 24, 2024, on May 24, the remaining vehicle reservations will be released for May 25, 2024, and so on.\n\nIn addition to a vehicle reservation, each vehicle entering the park is required to have an entrance pass for any entry point into the park. These passes could include any of the following: a $35 vehicle pass, good for seven days; a valid Interagency Annual/Lifetime Pass; or a Glacier National Park Annual Pass. A vehicle reservation does not include an entrance pass/fee, and the park entrance pass/fee does not serve as a vehicle reservation.\n\nThere are a limited number of vehicle reservations available for each day and demand will exceed supply.\n\nHow can I see the park without a vehicle reservation?\n\nFrom May 24 through September 8, 2024, visitors without vehicle reservations may enter vehicle reservation areas before 6 am or after 3 pm without a vehicle reservation.\n\nSt. Mary and Two Medicine entrances do not require vehicle reservations in 2024. St. Mary provides access to Going-to-the-Sun Road driving east to west. Please note that visitors who enter from the east side will not be able to return through the Apgar Check Point without a vehicle reservation between 6 am and 3 pm.\n\nMany Glacier does not require a vehicle reservation before July 1, 2024.\n\nFor Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor, vehicle reservations will be checked going east at the Apgar Check Point. Visitors will have access to the Apgar and St. Mary Visitor Centers and park shuttle locations outside of the vehicle reservation area.\n\nVisitors who are waiting until 3 pm can explore additional options outside Glacier National Park here.\n\nVisitors can also participate in guided hikes through Glacier Guides or educational programs with Glacier Institute, which meet outside of the park and travel as a group into the park.\n\nHow do I prove I have a vehicle reservation?\n\nVehicle reservations and park passes/entrance fees will be checked along with a photo ID at the time of entry. Vehicle reservations cannot be sold, auctioned, or transferred. Print or save a digital copy (e.g., screenshot) of the vehicle reservation or valid service reservation prior to your arrival. Cell service is unreliable and usually unavailable in the park. Proof of valid vehicle reservation or service reservation should be prepared and ready to present to park staff at vehicle reservation check points.\n\nCan someone else make a reservation for me on my behalf?\n\nThere is an option to have someone else make a reservation on your behalf. In order to do so, they should enter your name under the “order details” in the “ticket holder details” portion of the reservation process. They will need to set up a Recreation.gov account, and when they make the reservation, it will automatically populate their name under \"ticket holder details.\" However, they can delete their name and fill in your name. They should make sure NOT to check the box next to “save above changes to my account” or your name will be placed on every reservation they make in the future on Recreation.gov. Please note, an individual recreation.gov user can only make one reservation per area per day. In other words, they cannot make a reservation for themselves and for you for the same day in the same area in the park.\n\nThis system prevents others from purchasing large numbers of reservations (scalping) or corporations from making multiple reservations.\n\nBack to FAQ List Back to Top of Page\n\nWho can I contact if I have a question about getting a vehicle reservation?\n\nVisitors can contact the Call Center at 855-450-8747 for questions about vehicle reservarions. The Call Center can provide information, but vehicle reservations can only be purchased online at Recreation.gov.\n\nBack to FAQ List Back to Top of Page\n\nDo I also need a Park Pass or an Entrance Pass in addition to a vehicle reservation?\n\nYes, in addition to a vehicle reservation or valid service reservation, visitors must also have a park pass or pay an entrance fee to enter the park.\n\nA park pass or entrance fee is required to access any entry point within Glacier National Park. Park passes and entrance passes are not the same as vehicle reservations.\n\nPark passes and entrance passes are available for purchase at park entrances or online at Recreation.gov. Visitors who already possess a valid entrance pass, such as an Annual, Senior, Access, Military, etc., do not need to purchase another pass.\n\nHow do I get a first-come, first-served campground in a vehicle reservation area?\n\nIf you are planning on camping at one of the front country campgrounds in the North Fork, the Polebridge Ranger Station (located at the Polebridge Entrance) can issue any available sites upon your arrival. Mention that you would like to stay at one of the campgrounds (specify which one). If there is an available site, park staff will issue the site to you. A vehicle reservation for the North Fork is included with the campground site for the duration of your stay there.\n\nVisitors without a vehicle reservation will have access to the Rising Sun Campground coming from the east side of Going-to-the-Sun Road.\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation if I have booked a tour or commercial activity inside a vehicle reservation area?\n\nNo, visitors with lodging, camping, transportation, or commercial activity service reservations in a vehicle reservation area can use their service reservation to gain access to the portion of the park for which they have a service reservation.\n\nService reservations originating east of Logan Pass cannot be used instead of a vehicle reservation for access past the Apgar Check Point heading east on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Visitors with service reservations along Going-to-the-Sun Road in locations east of Logan Pass (ex: Rising Sun and St. Mary campgrounds/boating) will need to enter Going-to-the-Sun Road via the St. Mary Entrance if they do not possess a vehicle reservation for Going-to-the-Sun Road (West). All visitors will be able to drive Going-to-the-Sun Road without a vehicle reservation going west from St. Mary.\n\nValid service reservations include commercial tours, lodging, etc.\n\nProof of a valid service reservation along with a photo ID will serve as a vehicle reservation for the day of the service reservation only.\n\nService reservations in areas outside of the designated reservation area will not serve as valid vehicle reservations.\n\nExamples of valid service reservations for commercial activities are listed below. Additional service reservations may apply.\n\nCommercial Tour Reservations\n\nGlacier Park Boat Company\n\nLake McDonald\n\nMany Glacier\n\nHorseback Riding Reservations\n\nSwan Mountain Outfitters\n\nLake McDonald Corral\n\nMany Glacier Corral\n\nNon-Profit Partner Reservations\n\nGlacier Institute\n\nPermit Holders\n\nSpecial Use Permits inside vehicle reservation area including weddings, special events, film/photography projects, first amendment activities, etc.\n\nWatercraft Reservations\n\nGlacier Park Boat Company\n\nLake McDonald\n\nMany Glacier\n\nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government.\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation if I have booked a hotel or campsite inside a vehicle reservation area?\n\nNo, visitors with lodging, camping, transportation, or commercial activity service reservations can use their reservation to gain access to the portion of the park for which they have a reservation.\n\nLodging and camping (including front country developed campgrounds and backcountry camping permits) reservations originating east of Logan Pass cannot be used instead of a vehicle reservation for access past the Apgar Check Point heading west on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Visitors with service reservations along Going-to-the-Sun Road in locations east of Logan Pass (ex: Rising Sun and St. Mary campgrounds) will need to enter Going-to-the-Sun Road via the St. Mary Entrance if they do not possess a vehicle reservation for Going-to-the-Sun Road (West). All visitors will be able to drive Going-to-the-Sun Road without a vehicle reservation going west from St. Mary.\n\nValid service reservations include lodging, camping, etc.\n\nProof of a valid service reservation along with a photo ID will serve as a vehicle reservation for the day of the service reservation only.\n\nService reservations in areas outside of the designated reservation area will not serve as valid vehicle reservations.\n\nExamples of valid service reservations for lodging and camping are listed below. Additional service reservations may apply.\n\nCamping Reservations\n\nSprague Creek Campground (Reservation campground)\n\nAvalanche Creek Campground (Reservation campground)\n\nBowman Lake Campground (First-come, first-served campground)\n\nLogging Creek Campground (Closed in 2023)\n\nKintla Lake Campground (First-come, first-served campground)\n\nQuartz Creek Campground (First-come, first-served campground)\n\nMany Glacier Campground (Reservation campground)\n\nOnce registered, campers at first-come, first-served campgrounds will be allowed reservation area access for the dates of their stay.\n\nLodging Reservations\n\nGranite Park Chalet\n\nSperry Chalet\n\nLake McDonald Lodge\n\nMany Glacier Hotel\n\nSwiftcurrent Motor Inn\n\nReservations held on private lands within Glacier National Park. Check with private owner.\n\nMotel Lake McDonald\n\nWilderness Camping Permits\n\nFor trailheads located inside vehicle reservation areas\n\nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government.\n\nDo I need a vehicle reservation for a motorcycle or an e-bike?\n\nMotorcyles are required to have vehicle reservations in reservation areas, as they are vehicles. E-bikes are considered bicycles and do not require vehicle reservations. Both types of entry modes do require the appropriate vehicle pass.\n\nBack to FAQ List Back to Top of Page\n\nHow many vehicle reservations are being released per day?\n\nThe vehicle reservation system allows for adjustments for changing conditions such as seasonal changes, congestion, construction, and parking availability. The 24-hour release window is where the park can adjust and adapt to meet desired conditions. We make adjustments in an attempt to maximize visitor access while still protecting resources and visitor experience quality. The pilot system allows us to continuously learn about and improve the system; therefore, the total number of daily vehicle reservations for 2024 is not an exact number.\n\nIn 2023, 257,309 total vehicle reservations (179,489 for Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor, 12,712 for North Fork, 31,430 for Many Glacier, and for 33,678 Two Medicine) were released. Only one vehicle reservation was required per vehicle. In 2023, Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor vehicle reservations were valid for 3 days while the North Fork, Many Glacier, and Two Medicine vehicle reservations were valid for 1 day.\n\nIn 2022, 180,832 total vehicle reservations (169,456 for Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor and 11,376 for North Fork) were released. Only one vehicle reservation was required per vehicle. In 2022, Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor vehicle reservations were valid for 3 days while the North Fork vehicle reservation was valid for 1 day.\n\nIn 2021, 135,086 total vehicle reservations/ticketed entry were released for vehicle access on the Going-to-the-Sun Road. Vehicle reservations were valid for 7 days in 2021 and were only required for the Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor.\n\nHow does Glacier National Park determine the number of vehicle reservations to make available during each release?\n\nThere are several factors that help determine how many vehicle reservations will be released including, but not limited to:\n\nThe number of vehicles entering the system with a valid camping, lodging, or commercial service reservation\n\nVehicles entering each area before 6 am\n\nChanging conditions such as the opening of Going-to-the-Sun Road, which is only partially open in May and June\n\nConstruction within each of the managed access areas\n\nDecrease in availability of commercial services in late summer\n\nThe park manages vehicle reservation areas to improve visitor safety, protect sensitive resources, provide a quality visitor experience, assure predictable visitor access, and eliminate the need for temporary closures.\n\nThe goal of managing Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor under these pilots is not to limit visitation, but to spread out visitation throughout the day in the most visited area of the park. Areas outside of Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor are managed for a different set of desired conditions. For example, the North Fork is managed as a “wilderness threshold zone” with an emphasis on solitude, a sense of history, difficulty of access, and limited support facilities.\n\nWhere did vehicle reservations sell out the fastest in 2023 and how quickly?\n\nIn 2023, vehicle reservations for the areas outside of Going-to-the-Sun Road Corridor sold out quickly, sometimes in minutes. Areas outside Going-to-the-Sun Road corridor, North Fork, Many Glacier, and Two Medicine, are much smaller and provide different types of experience for visitors. The result of this is that there were a smaller amount of vehicle reservations for these areas which can sell out much quicker than Going-to-the-Sun Road.\n\nThe park is reporting around 3 million recreation visits each year. The number of vehicle reservations being released does not represent this number. Why is that?"
