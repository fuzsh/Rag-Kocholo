        "text": "2017\n\nCity Locations\n\nUtah, Wyoming (USA)\n\nLocation Types\n\nFilm Studio, Riverside\n\nLocation Styles\n\nMountain Huts, Rustic, Camper, Colonial, Neglected\n\nAbout Wind River\n\nFollowing the scorching intensity of \"Hell or High Water,\" Taylor Sheridan presents us with the chilling and suspenseful thriller \"Wind River.\" Released in 2017, this neo-western crime thriller features an outstanding cast, including Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Gil Birmingham, Jon Bernthal, and Julia Jones. On the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, the movie unfolds the narrative of a wildlife officer, Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner), who stumbles upon the corpse of a young woman within the reservation. The investigation of this case is assigned to FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), who recruits Lambert for his tracking skills. Together, they must navigate the desolate winter landscape and confront the local crime syndicate to solve the mystery. The film has received critical acclaim for exploring social issues, such as violence against Indigenous women and law enforcement agencies lack of proper response. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 44 critics' reviews indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" In his review for Variety, Owen Gleiberman characterized Wind River as a crime drama with a humanistic touch, noting its skillful execution over sheer excitement. Wind River received numerous award nominations, including nominations at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. It was recognized for its excellence in the Un Certain Regard category and as a prestigious Golden Camera award contender. It emerged victorious in the Best Director category, with Taylor Sheridan's exceptional talent and vision duly acknowledged.\n\nWind River Locations\n\nThe 2017 crime drama Wind River was filmed in the majestic western landscape of Wyoming and Utah. With its beautiful backdrop, the movie captures the essence of the American West. Most scenes were shot in Summit County, Utah, where much of the mountainous terrain is seen onscreen. From Coalville to Park City Studios and Utah Film Studios, viewers can immediately recognize the jaw-dropping setting for this intense film. Other iconic peaks are also used as stand-ins. Hidden Peak is one of the highest peaks in the region at 10,971 feet above sea level in Snowbird, Salt Lake County. A stretch of Native American reservation covers over three thousand square miles across multiple counties, including Fremont and Hot Springs County. Wind River offers a unique look at Americaâs most overlooked regions, from its eerie mountainous landscapes to its vast plains. Visiting these locations is an absolute must for fans of Wind River or any admirers of neo-western views. Hiking through Hidden Peak or marveling at Coalvilleâs courthouse will put viewers into Sheridan's masterpiece. Plus, with scenery from lush forests to arid deserts, a trip to these Wind River destinations guarantees breathtaking views that will last forever.\n\nThe opening scene, where Cory (Jeremy Renner) and his son Casey (Teo Briones) enter the Indian Reservation, is somber and reflective. As they drive, they pass a sign stating âEntering Wind River Indian Reservation,â signaling their entrance into the reservation. This scene highlights Cory's connection to the area and his relationship to his daughter's death and sets up the family reunion that follows in later scenes. The scene was filmed at the actual Wind River Indian Reservation itself, located in Wyoming across multiple counties, including Fremont and Hot Springs. Establishing shots were also taken at this location, emphasizing the feeling of remoteness of this area. The expansive landscape of mountains and vast open sky in these shots lends an air of solemnity to the scene and helps convey Cory's feelings of loss. For those wishing to visit this iconic location for themselves, it is easily accessible from either side of the state line between Utah and Wyoming via Interstate 191 or 26. Regrettably, there is no access to public transportation. Thus it is advisable to be prepared to rent a car.\n\nThe scene of Lambert (Jeremy Renner) finding a woman's body, Natalie (Kelsey Asbille), in the snow, was incredibly moving and heartbreaking. It is one of the most pivotal moments in the film, as it illustrates the tragedy of missing and viscerally murdered Indigenous women. The snow-covered landscape amplifies the coldness and loneliness of this moment and hints at the bleakness of the situation. The contrast between Hanson's pale blue skin against the white snow further emphasizes her deathly state and vulnerability. The scene was shot onsite at Wasatch Ranges, located on the edge of the Rocky Mountains in Central Utah. This iconic location is known for its stunning canyons and alpine valleys that span 160 miles. It also has hundreds of miles of mountain biking and hiking trails, making it a year-round popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. You can drive from nearby cities like Salt Lake City or Provo, roughly 2 hours away from Wasatch Ranges. Alternatively, you can fly into Salt Lake City International Airport, which is about 1-hour drive away from Wasatch Ranges. Once there, you can explore many of its trails by foot or bike to truly enjoy its beauty.\n\nThe scene unfolds with outside views of the police station before transitioning to the characters. We witness Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), Chief Ben Shoyo (Graham Greene) of the tribal police, and other officers from law enforcement decide to arrive at the drilling site. There they are greeted by Curtis (Hugh Dillon), the head of security, along with a number of his security personnel. The courthouse in Summit County, situated at 60 North Main Street in Coalville, was a substitute for the Fremont County Sheriffâs Office in the film. The building, finished in 1904, boasts Romanesque Revival architecture, mirroring the aesthetics of the Salt Lake City/County Building. A jailhouse was annexed to the northeast side of the building a year later. In 1973 this historic building earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. To get to this location from Salt Lake City, you can take Highway 80 east and follow it until you reach Coalville. From there, it's easy to find Main Street and then drive up to 60 North Main Street, where you'll see the courthouse on your left-hand side.\n\nPete Mickens (James Jordan) awakens to discover himself transported to the mountain peak with his boots missing. Cory (Jeremy Renner) forcefully confronts Pete, eventually coaxing a confession regarding his alleged assault on Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) and the murder of Matt (Jon Bernthal). Cory informs Pete that his confession has earned him his freedom. However, before Pete can leave, Cory recounts how Natalie braved the snow, running six miles barefoot. He expresses his skepticism about Pete being able to cover even 600 feet in similar conditions. Cory then instructs Pete to run. Pete tries but only gets a few dozen steps in before the cold paralyzes his lungs, mirroring Natalie's harsh ordeal. The majestic backdrop of Hidden Peak brings an impactful finality to this emotionally charged scene from Wind River. Standing nearly 11,000 feet above sea level, it captures how small we are compared to natureâs power while providing an epic setting for an equally powerful story. If you want to visit Hidden Peak, it is within the Wasatch Mountains in Utah. It can be accessed from Snowbird Ski Resort on one side or Alta Ski Area on the other via Little Cottonwood Canyon Road. Visitors should come prepared with proper gear and supplies for a hike at high elevations.\n\nWind River beautifully weaves its gripping narrative against the stunning backdrop of Utah and Wyoming's breathtaking filming locations. The strategic choice of these locations adds an unparalleled layer of authenticity to the story and serves as a visual feast for the audience's senses. With its vast and rugged landscapes, Utah played an instrumental role in bringing the movie's raw intensity to life. The striking contrast between the majestic peaks and the desolate valleys perfectly mirrored the characters' emotional turmoil. On the other hand, Wyoming lent its unique charm to the film's atmosphere. The expansive plains and open skies of the state effortlessly evoke a sense of solitude and contemplation, which beautifully complements the film's themes of mystery and introspection. The iconic Wind River Indian Reservation served as an authentic backdrop, infusing the movie with a rich cultural resonance that underlined the significance of the story's setting. The filming locations of Utah and Wyoming are not just mere settings but integral components that contributed to the overall impact of Wind River. These landscapes, with their rugged beauty and emotional resonance, served as more than just a backdrop; they became essential elements in conveying the film's narrative, its themes, and the complex emotions of its characters."
