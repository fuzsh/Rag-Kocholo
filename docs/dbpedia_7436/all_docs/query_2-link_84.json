        "text": "Movies aren't always about what they seem to be about -- that's one of their glories. Case in point: Reservation Road, the latest film by Terry George (Hotel Rwanda), which stars Mark Ruffalo as Dwight, a small-town attorney who accidentally hits and kills a boy while driving home from a Red Sox game late one evening. Scared to death, Dwight just drives on, but his law firm subsequently winds up being retained by the dead kid's justifiably pissed-off father, Ethan (Joaquin Phoenix), who wants to be sure that the scoundrel, when finally caught, doesn't get off with a slap on the wrist.\n\nA contrived, somewhat overwrought variation on In the Bedroom redeemed by a trio of strong performances (including Jennifer Connelly as Ethan's wife), Reservation Road clearly wants to make a stark, profound statement about guilt and fury, responsibility and revenge. I can't imagine that anybody involved with this project thought they were making a movie about communication in the age of the Internet. And yet Reservation Road, in its offhanded way, depicts the world of the reasonably affluent 21st-century American more accurately than any other recent film I can think of. When Ethan wants to find out what the likely penalty would be for a hit-and-run offender, he actually does exactly what you or I would do: He Googles the hell out of it, in a scene that for once doesn't cough up the relevant info nugget at the very first keystroke. Later, he turns for emotional support to a chat group for parents of murdered children, pouring his heart out to strangers rather than to his wife and surviving child."
