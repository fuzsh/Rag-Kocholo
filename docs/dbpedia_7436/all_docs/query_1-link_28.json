        "text": "Though there’s never been an Irish New Wave per se,\n\nTerry George‘s\n\nearly work shares the two themes characterized in most Irish films steadily\n\nreleased over the past three decades: the struggle of the working class and the\n\neverlasting tension between Ireland and Britain. After being imprisoned for six\n\nyears for involvement with Irish republican organizations, George began his\n\ncareer co-writing the screenplays to\n\nIn the Name\n\nof the Father, The\n\nBoxer with\n\nJim Sheridan,\n\nand writing/directing 1996’s\n\nSome Mother’s Son.\n\nGeorge broadened his scope with\n\nHotel Rwanda, which\n\nearned George an Oscar nomination for co-writing the screenplay and a nomination for Don\n\nCheadle’s lead performance.\n\nRotten Tomatoes spoke to Terry George in San Francisco at\n\nthe beginning of his press tour promoting his latest film,\n\nReservation Road.\n\nAn adaptation of the\n\nJohn\n\nBurnham Schwartz novel, Reservation Road stars\n\nJoaquin\n\nPhoenix as a father who loses his son in a hit-and-run accident and\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nas the guilt-ridden killer, and opens this Friday in limited release.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: Given your history and background, it’s\n\nsurprising you haven’t directed more movies about Ireland.\n\nTerry George: Well, I’ve done three. I wrote In\n\nthe Name of the Father and The Boxer, and I directed Some Mother’s\n\nSon. And they covered, certainly, the central section of the Troubles. The\n\ntimeframe of In the Name of the Father was 1974; The Boxer would’ve\n\nbeen 1988. So we covered a 14 year range at the heart of the Troubles.\n\nRT: So for now you’re satisfied with the subject?\n\nTG: There’s a project Jim [Sheridan] and I have\n\ntalked about. We want to do what would essentially be three movies, almost like\n\nLord of the Rings. [We’d] cover the whole Troubles with real characters\n\n[who] move though it. That’d be divided up between me and Jim and another Irish\n\ndirector so we’d be making them at the same time. Maybe\n\nNeil Jordan,\n\nor\n\nThaddeus O’Sullivan, or\n\nJohn Carney,\n\nwho just did Once. Or\n\nmaybe Paul\n\nGreengrass.\n\nRT: How did you and Sheridan first meet and start\n\ncollaborating?\n\nTG: He was the artistic director of a theater called\n\nthe Irish Arts Center in New York. And I had wrote a play in Northern Ireland\n\nabout a prison escape. I took it to him and he put it on. It ran pretty well,\n\nran for six months. Then he went off to do\n\nMy Left Foot and\n\nI stayed behind and became this sort of temporary artistic director. [Then] I\n\nencountered Gerry Conlon, the subject character of In the Name of the Father,\n\nand started working [on the screenplay]. So I sort of stumbled into\n\n[filmmaking].\n\nRT: Were you always interested in it?\n\nTG: My interest was primarily journalism. I was\n\nworking as a freelance journalist doing some work on research and work on a big\n\nMafia book. The playwriting was just a way of expressing sentiments I felt about\n\nNorthern Ireland, having left it in 1981, 1982. So, no, I never really planned a\n\ncareer or anything.\n\nRT: For a while, you were attached to direct\n\nAmerican Gangster\n\nwith Don Cheadle and\n\nBenicio Del\n\nToro. What happened with that project?\n\nTG: I had a perception of a cast, so I rewrote it.\n\nRT: This was after Washington and\n\nAntoine Fuqua\n\nhad left the project.\n\nTG: Right. I always viewed it as a team. Me and [Cheadle]\n\nwere a package deal. Then the studio wasn’t in favor of Benicio anymore. So I\n\nproposed that we do me and Don and Joaquin. And the cost of the movie didn’t\n\nmatch up with the perception of what we [could] draw [at the box office]. And\n\nthen Denzel became interested again and I couldn’t in all good conscience\n\nabandon Don.\n\nI think what [Universal] ended up with is the product they\n\nwere after in the first place. Big stylish movie. I tried to approach it but if\n\nyou have a $120 million dollar budget, it’s different from a $65 million dollar\n\nbudget. So that was basically it. RT: You’ve worked with Jim Sheridan multiple times, were\n\ngoing to work with Cheadle again, and have worked twice with Phoenix…\n\nTG: Three times, actually. I was the on-set script\n\nwriter for Ladder 49.\n\nThat’s where I met him.\n\nRT: Do you seek out these collaborations?\n\nTG: I do. I [enjoy working] with great actors.\n\nClearly with Don. Obviously Joaquin. I’d love to do something with\n\nDaniel\n\nDay-Lewis. Jim and I have a couple of projects that we’re talking about.\n\nIt’s just that you build up a comfort level with people. Ruffalo I would\n\ndefinitely work with again.\n\nJennifer\n\n[Connelly] and\n\nMira [Sorvino],\n\nthey’re good people. Suddenly you know their strengths and you start crafting\n\ncharacters that go along with that.\n\nRT: Did you and John Burnham Schwartz collaborate on\n\nReservation Road‘s script?\n\nTG: He did his first and then I did mine. Not out of\n\nany decisions by me that that’s the way it had to be. Joaquin gave me the script\n\nin June of last year and then we were shooting by September. We casted in a\n\ncouple of weeks. We were going really fast. Everyone wanted to work on the\n\ncharacters a bit. Basically, out of practicality, I had to sit down and do it\n\nmyself. Whereas with Sheridan we have a lot of back and forth.\n\nRT: Have you read the book?\n\nTG: Yeah. I read the script, and then I read the\n\nbook. At some point, you have to put it down and make the thing work in terms of\n\ncinema itself. I’m very structure oriented. I need the three act structure. I\n\nlike that because I think audiences are attuned to it. You’re not challenging\n\nthem to put together a jigsaw puzzle, you’re challenging them to sit back and\n\nget in with these characters.\n\nRT: Reservation Road seems like a challenge to\n\nadapt since a lot of it takes place inside people’s heads.\n\nTG: Books tend to be, and this one in particular,\n\ncerebral, and you have to translate that into the dialogue or the visualization\n\nof the scene. It’s a distillation.\n\nI always knew this movie had to be around 100 minutes. It\n\ncouldn’t be longer than that because the subject matter and the weight of it was\n\nsuch that if you didn’t go fast with the edit and the storytelling it’d become\n\nmaudlin, and depressing in not a very cinematic way.\n\nRT: There’s also the thriller aspect of the story to\n\nmaintain.\n\nTG: For me, it’s more psychological thriller. I was\n\nmore interested in the theme of revenge, particularly demonizing the opposition\n\nwhere you create a monster inside your head capable of doing violence to. That\n\nseemed like a very post 9/11 theme because that was the mood of the nation at\n\none stage. Clearly, we’ve learned now the folly of that emotion as a driving\n\nforce. The pain and the kind of damage that action does, and the inability to\n\nlook beyond the event and try to find a way to come to terms with it is what\n\ninterested me.\n\nRT: Was it a challenge to balance the drama and thriller elements? Or to\n\nbalance the story of the book and the story you wanted to present?\n\nTG: I had to craft. I had to work at that. You can’t\n\ntake a book and then reinvent it completely. There’s a sort of obligation to\n\nstay within the parameter of the book. Maybe change some stuff to make it work,\n\nbut the basic events I wanted to keep in there. The small town setting. The fact\n\nthat in that small town setting you could have people living in the next street\n\nto each who never meet and then an event happens and suddenly they’re embroiled\n\nin each other’s lives.\n\nI know some critics had problems with what they said were\n\ncoincidences [of the plot]. I never had a problem with that at all. And I’m\n\nvery, I think, very rigorous about looking for plot coincidences or weaknesses\n\nthat pull people out. But there you go.\n\nRT: Do you follow film criticism closely?\n\nTG: I did. [There] are some [reviewers] who are\n\ngiven credibility that I wouldn’t have.\n\nIn a funny way, it’s in the movie as well. I love the\n\nInternet. It’s probably, in terms of the spreading of knowledge, the greatest\n\nthing that’s happened to mankind. [But] there’s an obsession with it, an\n\naddiction. Like, [Phoenix’s character] Ethan goes to the Internet for solace.\n\nThat’s a reality. I know a lot of people who find the answer to everything on\n\nthe Internet. On the websites that Ethan visits, there’s a fueling, a\n\nreinforcing of this anger and sentiment between bunches of despaired people\n\naround America, around the world. That’s kind of destructive. But as always\n\nhappens in Hollywood…"
