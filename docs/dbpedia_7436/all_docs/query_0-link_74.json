        "text": "Plot\n\nDwight Arno (Ruffalo) is an attorney who is divorced from his wife Ruth (Sorvino). Ruth controls custody of their son Lucas (Alderson) while Dwight maintains visitation rights. Dwight and Lucas are at a baseball game when Ruth calls, informing Dwight that he is late returning their son home. Dwight drives Lucas home in a hurry, thinking he might otherwise forfeit his visitation privileges. When he loses control of his vehicle, he strikes a young boy, Josh Learner (Curley), who is standing by the roadside.\n\nAware that he has struck the boy, Dwight decides to flee the scene. He further lies to Lucas, who has a minor injury from the incident, saying that they had collided with a tree log. Dwight later hears on a newscast that Josh died in the collision. Subsequently, he tries to cover up the evidence which implicates him in the hit-and-run. After the initial shock of losing Josh, Grace (Connelly) gradually tries to get on with life, but her husband Ethan (Phoenix), is obsessed with finding out who killed their son and frustrated with the lack of progress the police are making in their investigation. Ethan eventually decides to hire a lawyer, who oddly enough turns out to be Dwight.\n\nEthan later discovers, quite by chance, that Dwight is the perpetrator. Fearing that Dwight would be incarcerated for only a few years via the court system, he buys a gun to dispense his own form of justice.\n\nCast\n\nJoaquin Phoenix as Ethan Learner\n\nMark Ruffalo as Dwight Arno\n\nJennifer Connelly as Grace Learner\n\nMira Sorvino as Ruth Wheldon\n\nElle Fanning as Emma Learner\n\nEddie Alderson as Lucas Arno\n\nSean Curley as Josh Learner\n\nAntoni Corone as Sergeant Burke\n\nFilming\n\nThe film was shot in Stamford, Connecticut, starting in late October, 2006, with the very first city scene from Annapolis MD, and the next scene at Cove Island Park.
