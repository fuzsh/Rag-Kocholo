Gee, do you think that will prompt dad to look at his own cowardice about not fessing up to his crime? Then the film drifts into something of an unconvincing revenge story.\n\nReservation Road (rated R) feels like a flawed literary adaptation. It also attempts to deal with grief and loss but in a manner that feels artificial. A much more moving and effective meditation on grief can be found in this week's release of Things We Lost in the Fire.\n\nCompanion viewing: Some Mother's Son, The Son's Room, In the Bedroom\n\n&\n\n& Mark Ruffalo and Joaquin Phoenix in Reservation Road (Focus Features)\n\nGeorge began his career writing politically themed Irish films like In the Name of the Father and Some Mother's Son. Then he went on to write and direct the politically themed Hotel Rwanda. Any of those films are better than his latest. But all share an emphasis on delivering a message first and creating an artful, well-crafted film second. George tends to rely on the emotional force of the events he deals with -- coerced confessions, hunger strikes, genocide, a child's death -- to hook audiences and engage their sympathies."
