        "text": "I don’t understand certain human beings. I truly don’t. I was talking to a few people online and they asked me what genres of film I enjoy. So in my typical fashion- I begin naming them. Then I get to a stage where I am quite literally reading all the genres from the encyclopaedia of genres. So I sum it up to everything except for horror and attempt to avoid romance and comedy. Each person replied saying I have not watched the right kind of films…. Excuse me? There is only one film that is either in one that I enjoy- Miss Congeniality (but that is only for favourite actor bias). And Dirty Dancing too then for the exact same reason. So, in general, I only watch comedies or romance films if there is someone I like in it.\n\nThe thing that got me was the fact they said that I am not watching the right films. Is there really a right kind of film? Is there something I’m not getting with watching films? How would they even know what the right kind of film is?\n\nWhat I learnt was that society is accpeptive of everyone’s opinion- as long as it is not against their own. We live in a hypocritical society filled with hypocrites. People say they’re not hypocritical end up being hypocritical someway or another by saying they are not hypocritical. With where I’m going now, I may as well start using the Chewbacca defence. Therefore, I will make this list somehow not a waste of your time by giving you a list of actors I love because they can portray a character I hate with a passion.\n\n1. FOREST WHITAKER\n\nWhere do I even start? Great actor! No. Wait. Phenomenal! But he does have a knack for portraying hateable characters which he portrays oh so well! The two characters that come to mind was his portrayal of a wrongly diagnosed patient in ER and Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh in The Shield. I hated both of these characters to the extent I was yelling at the screen because of their annoyance…. or maybe because their actions caused pain to my favourite characters (*cough* *cough* Luka Kovac *cough* *cough* Lem). But I can’t help but admire Whitaker. His character portrayals are so convincing it is truly admirable.\n\n2. ALAN ALDA\n\nYeah I know- he’s Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce. Anyway, have you not seen The West Wing or Murder at 1600? Lord almighty! Does Alda portray characters you love to hate in them! Let’s start simple with Murder at 1600. I sat watching like OMG it’s Pierce from M*A*S*H blah blah and Vinick from West Wing in a character that seems decent and likeable. Of course, as per usual, I speak far too soon and it turns out he was the craziest and most unlikeable of them all! And to The West Wing as Senator Vinick- the republican who was going for the presidency against Matthew Santos (portrayed by Jimmy Smits). As a Republican hater, there was no doubt that I would hate Vinick but Alda’s portrayal made the character even more hateable- which in my books, yet again, is quite admirable.\n\nAre there any actors or actresses that make you love to hate the character they portray? Have you had any odd ‘know it all’ experiences? Entertain us and tell us in the comments below.\n\nHere is a list of my all time favourite television shows in no particular order.\n\nSONS OF ANARCHY\n\nI started watching this show properly at the beginning of 2012. I had seen it a few times in 2009 but I was only 12 and got slightly creeped out by it. Anyway, I revisited Charming and decided to watch season 1-3 from the beginning. Once I did that, then I watched season 5 and 6 the day they were on.The rest is history.\n\nWhat I love about Sons is what I love about Band of Brothers. It is the brotherhood. It is the laughs when there are hard times. It is the great onscreen chemistry. It is the equation for perfection. Great writing. Great acting. Great connection. Your friends will think you are crazy for liking….no….loving a biker show that doesn’t have the average pretty boy actor in it and still calling the actors (a fair few of them) attractive. When you watch Sons, you are a part of a ginormous family. That is what I love about it. The essence of family in it all. It will also start debates with others (or the newsreader on your TV screen) about whether SAMCRO is a club or a gang. We say they are clubs when others say they are gangs. If you come across someone that thinks opposite, just tell them to watch episode 6 of season 6.\n\nAnd the fact that there are/were two Hells Angels members on the show just adds to its amazingness- particularly when you personally get the nickname Happy… or maybe that is a worry…. pfft! Of course it is not! Happy Junior right here! Besides, I don’t mind playing a bit of spot The Shield.\n\nFavourite characters: Juice and Happy as well as Kozik with soft spots for Chibs and Tig.\n\nThe Shield\n\nThe Shield. Where do I begin with this masterpiece? From the very first episode, you wanted to keep watching to see where in the world the stories could possibly go. I had a personal love for Lem (maybe because I started watching the show for Kenny Johnson after falling in love with Kozik on Sons). The show is about the Strike Team, a four man anti-gang unit, who we see doesn’t use by the book tactics. The Shield is one of those shows that leaves you thinking as well as yelling at the TV screen- no matter how many times you have watched the episode.\n\nWhat I really, really love about The Shield is the character development through the seven seasons as well as, like SOA, the story lines and the action. Every single character that appears on the show has immense depth to them- even if they are on for five seconds.\n\nI suggest for people to watch The Shield if they want a proper, well-written not your average crime show. It grips you from the beginning. You oddly connect with the characters even though you question what they are doing. When they laugh, you laugh. When they’re angry, you’re angry. When they cry, you cry. It’s one of those one in a million shows that you will either love or hate because of what it is.\n\nFavourite characters: Lem, Ronnie\n\nThe West Wing\n\nWhere do I even begin? I bought the box set- all seven seasons. The cast. The writing. The plot. Perfection. Just going to leave it at that.\n\nFavourite character/s- Sam Seaborn, Jed Bartlett, Josh Lyman (but I love all the characters really- well the nice, democratic ones).\n\nER\n\nI first started watching ER after finding out that there was a Croatian in it. And I became even more interested when I found out my dad actually knew Goran Visnjic! They grew up in the same town in Croatia. Anyway, back to the important stuff. The writing was great, especially with each characters back story. The storylines were interesting and allowed you to actually understand medical terms and issues. It is easy to grip onto with whichever episode you watch and enables you to easily look back later and say oh yes, this and this happened since then and that person died etc etc. One thing The writers of ER were not afraid of was killing off much loved characters! I never knew how Kovac lived until the end! It’s usually my favourites that get killed! Well I guess they killed Pratt and I absolutely loved him. I give up with favourite characters because they usually end up dead.\n\nMy favourites- Kovac, Carter, Pratt, Morris and what even? Everyone! They are all so lovable!\n\nReservation Road. A drama directed by Terry George. Where do I even begin?\n\nThis film gripped me from the beginning and no, not because I have a particularly liking for Mark Ruffalo, Joaquin Phoenix or the Boston Red Sox. It connected to a human side of me. The family side. A father and son at a baseball match (the fact it was a match from the 2004 World Series maybe played a role) or the parents and sister proudly watching their son or brother perform a musical piece. I really enjoyed the build up to the kick start of the story.\n\nIt was an all to familiar sight for many divorced parents, rushing to get their son or daughter back to their other (somewhat demanding) parent’s home. However on this particular night, Dwight Arno and the Learners crossed paths in the most horrible of circumstances. The Learners son, Josh, was releasing fireflies from the jar after his family pulled over at a gas station when Dwight (Ruffalo) steered to far to the right and hit him. Dwight drove off, horrified at what he had done as Josh’s father, Ethan (Phoenix), rushed in shock to his son’s side.\n\nFrom this moment, five lives would change forever. The script follows the guilt ridden Dwight as he deals with his conscience. It also follows how the Learners’ lives were changed as well. Ethan, overcome by anger and frustration at the fact the police seemed to do very little in finding his son’s killer, almost tears his family a part even more by trying to take the law into his own hands. His wife Grace feels guilty for her son’s death as she felt like she was the reason he got out of the car in the first place.\n\nLet me just begin with the fact this movie is not for the faint hearted. I say that all the time but usually in more violent circumstances. The film deals with incredibly serious and deep themes. Each character has a meaningful role to play in the story as each have their own way of dealing with grief and shock.\n\nIt would not be a review by me if I did not discuss the cast. The quality of acting in this film was beyond extraordinary. Each portrayed their character to a tee. With powerful performances especially from Mark Ruffalo, Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly, this film was sure a delight to watch. Their performances add that extra edge of sadness and grimness to how a normal life can be changed forever in a split second.\n\nI have read other reviews saying that this film can be likened to that of a Lifetime film. I disagree. Immensely. This film packs a punch of sensational acting, excellent script-writing and all round fanatabulous cinematography. I don’t think it was predictable despite the amount of films with a similar themes. The thing is, I can’t even remember any other films like this. This one is memorable.\n\nTruly memorable. I recommend everyone to watch it but I do warn you- have a few dozen boxes of tissues ready. And then when it gets to the final scene, make that a few more boxes.\n\n9/10\n\nActing rating: 10/10\n\nScript rating: 9/10\n\nCinematography: 9/10\n\nHere in Melbourne, we are currently having the Australian Open. On Monday, my cousin and I went to day one of the tournament and I am going another two days.\n\nSo, in the spirit of sport, which is my other life obsession, I will list my personal favourite sporting movies. Chances are you will criticise them for being rubbish or a waste of time. Just hint the words ‘personal favourite’. You can then list your favourites in the comments.\n\nRocky- 1976\n\nThe Rocky Series\n\nPersonally, I could watch these six movies day in day out. I love them. Maybe the third, fourth and fifth weren’t that brilliant and number six was to far fetched but I still love them. I think each film is amazing in its own right. Besides, you can’t create a sports movie list without Rocky somewhere on it. “Yo Adrian!”\n\nBrian’s Song- 1971\n\nYou will most definitely see this film on a future list of saddest movies that actually made ME cry. I love both versions of the film but as per usual, the original is always the best. The acting was marvellous and it actually showed the underlying humanity of sport.\n\nEd-1996\n\nTwo words: MY CHILDHOOD! I lost count how many times I watched this film when I was four. I loved it then and I love it now. An ultimate classic in my eyes!\n\nCoach Carter- 2005\n\nAmazing.\n\nGoal- 2005\n\nI was addicted to this movie. Absolutely love this.\n\nWe Are Marshall-2006\n\nAnother movie that would be added to the depressing list. We Are Marshall goes from one of the saddest films to one of the most uplifting and inspirational. Perfect acting as well.\n\nThe Mighty Ducks- 1992\n\nTwo words: Classic and childhood. I had the biggest crush on Gordon Bombay. Nowadays, Emilio Estevez is one of my favourite actors….\n\n61*-2001\n\nMy feelings for this movie deserve their very own post. Absolutely sensational! And I am a die hard Red Sox fan!\n\nThis was my list of favourite sports movies- now what is yours? Leave a comment and tell me.\n\nSo the 12th of January has arrived. Actors, actresses, directors and the rest of the film industry have prepared for one of the few important nights of the year for months. The suits, the dresses, the good, the bad and the ugly. Who will take home the big ones? Who will be the worst dressed? Who will cause the biggest upset? Will your favourites win? These are all questions that will be answered by the time you rest your head on your pillow.\n\nI, unfortunately, will not be able to watch the ceremony as I am in Australia and by what the TV guide says- they won’t be airing it on my TV.

It is said that it will be directed by Fast and Furious director, Rob Cohen. And by the way, when I say ‘Road House’, I do actually mean the classic film with Patrick Swayze as a bouncer who is asked to clean up a once booming nightclub.\n\nOne thing I really don’t like about remakes is the failure to uphold the calibre of the cast. I mean, who could possibly outplay Swayze as Dalton. Another factor I will have a few whinges about would be if the role went to someone who is taller than six foot. One of the most original and significant aspects of the film is Dalton’s height. How can you tell someone “I thought you’d be bigger” when they are 6’1 and upwards?\n\nThe Red Dawn remake of 2012 proved to be a perfect example of casting not reaching the initial talent. There is no possible way anyone could cast a group as good as the original of 1984. See for yourself (and these are only a few).\n\nThe original Red Dawn was set in the time of the Cold War so could be seen as a propagandistic film in a way. The 2012 version was set in a peaceful time with very little meaning with the North Koreans.\n\nThere are a handful of movies which have been remakes and I have actually enjoyed like Ocean’s 11 and The Italian Job.\n\nI also quite enjoy the idea of Gerard Butler being considered for the role of Bodhi in Point Break.\n\nRead here: http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/gerard-butler-point-break-remake\n\nI would actually agree to this casting (for once!). I am a huge…wait…ginormous…wait no….HUMONGOUS fan of Gerard Butler. I think he would be the best actor to portray and character initially played by Patrick Swayze. I am still considering who would fit the role of Johnny Utah.\n\nWho do you guys think should portray undercover FBI agent, Johnny Utah? Leave your ideas in the comments below.\n\nAll I can say: the next film they will probably remake is either Young Guns, Mighty Ducks or even The Outsiders. If they do- I believe many would riot."
