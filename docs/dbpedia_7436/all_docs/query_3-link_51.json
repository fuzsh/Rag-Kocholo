They may be prohibited in some exhibitions.

Child carriers that attach to the front are allowed.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nThe Nelson-Atkins allows some forms of photography and restricts others. Flash photography is not permitted inside the galleries.\n\nPersonal: Although personal cameras and photography are permitted inside the museum, personal photoshoots, including portrait photography, are not. Equipment such as tripods or monopods are not permitted in the galleries. Selfie sticks must be used responsibly. Photography in exhibitions may be restricted.
