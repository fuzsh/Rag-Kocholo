        "text": "Great that movies are filmed in CT, but why are they always so bad? Reservation Road, Indiana Jones 4, Righteous Kill and numerous B movies. All panned.\n\nAlthough Revolutionary Road was a good movie, and that was filmed partially in CT with beach scenes in Fairfield. Also, the prison scenes in Sleepers.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JayCT\n\nInteresting. I did not know it was filmed in Easton and Fairfield. Also says Stamford and Lake Compounce. I will have to watch it now for the scenery. I wonder when it is going to be on. Jay\n\nI thought \"Reservation Road\" was pretty good. I dont like typical blockbuster type films, and prefer a real story. Ruffalo was very good in it.\n\nThe parks filmed at the beginning during the concert were beautiful, on the ocean....of course at present I am landlocked and so love films with the Atlantic and east coast"
