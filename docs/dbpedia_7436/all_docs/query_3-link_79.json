        "text": "Important Terms and Concepts\n\nColonization\n\nthe formal and informal methods (behaviors, ideologies, institutions, policies and economies) that maintain the subjugation or exploitation of Indigenous peoples, lands, and resources. Colonization maintains and expands the colonizers' social, political and economic power. Not only has colonization resulted in the loss of major rights for Native Americans such as land and self-determination, most contemporary struggles such as poverty, family violence, chemical dependency are also a direct consequence of colonization.\n\nHistorical Trauma/Intergenerational Grief/The Soul Wound\n\nthe emotional and psychic wounding caused by colonialism: war, removal, illness, dispossession, coerced assimilation, including outlawing of language, religion and parenting; and forced poverty and dependence. Grief caused by the dominant society's lack of recognition of this American Holocaust.\n\nThe Vanishing Indian\n\na dominant and pervasive ideology (belief system) of the 18th and 19th Centuries in the US that Indians were vanishing and/or were doomed to vanish. Spread through literature, film, US policies and popular beliefs. Western films embody this idea along with ideologies of Conquest and Manifest Destiny.\n\nDominant Group\n\nthe group with the power (political, social, legal) to control less powerful groups\n\nSubordinate Group\n\nthe group or groups with insufficient social and political power to avoid domination by more powerful groups\n\nHegemony\n\nhe process by which dominant culture maintains its dominant position. For example, the use of institutional power, the employment of a bureaucracy to make power seem abstract, and therefore, not attached to any one individual.\n\nAgency\n\nthe capacity for human beings to make choices.\n\nDecolonization\n\nthe calculated and active resistance to the forces of colonialism that perpetuate the subjugation and or exploitation of Indigenous minds, bodies and lands, and it is engaged for the ultimate purpose of overturning the colonial structure and realizing Indigenous liberation.\n\nHidden Transcripts\n\nIn his book, Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts, James C. Scott demonstrates that \"Every subordinate group creates, out of its ordeal, a 'hidden transcript' that represents a critique of power spoken behind the back of the dominant. The powerful also develop a hidden transcript representing the practices and claims of their rule that cannot be openly avowed. A comparison of the hidden transcript of the weak with that of the powerful offers a new way of understanding resistance to domination (xii).\n\nWhen the great lord passes the wise peasant bows deeply and silently farts. ETHIOPIAN PROVERB\n\nEngaged Resistance\n\nDean Rader's terms for Native American artists, writers and filmmakers who actively engage in making culture that resists colonialist discourses about Indians. He claims that Native-produced texts like poetry, fiction, movies and paintings are products and processes of American Indian sovereignty; that Native American cultural expression is a strategy of aesthetic activism fashioned for both Native and Anglo publics. Rader asserts that Indian artists actively participate in \"speaking truth to power,\" and that art has the power to educate and heal, and is crucial in the struggle of oppressed people for liberation and justice. He focuses on the cultural work texts do, meaning \"the actual influence a text has in a context.\"\n\nRedfacing\n\nMichelle Rahaja's term from her book Reservation Reelism: Redfacing, Visual Sovereignty, and Representations of Native Americans in Film. Redfacing is \"the cultural and ideological work of playing Indian\" and is closely aligned with the Trickster figure. Tricksters operate in the service of their communities, albeit in often clumsy, violent, socially inappropriate, sexualized or humorous ways. Redfacing refers to the complex performances of the Hollywood Indian both on-screen and off-screen. It resembles the ambivalent cultural and political work of African American performers who appropriately black minstrelsy. Redfacing foregrounds issues of uneven power relations between Indians Europeans especially in the case of white filmmakers. Rahaja helps us understand the complexity of apparently demeaning performances by Indian actors.\n\nThe Virtual Reservation\n\nMichelle Rahaja's term. It is an imagined space; it is a site that displays Indigenous knowledges and practices in sharp relief against competing colonial discourses. By doing so, it opens up multiple narratives for dialogue within and outside the community on a site that is less invested in ideas of \"authenticity\" and fixed definitions of indigeneity imposed by outsiders. Indigenous people recuperate, regenerate, and begin to heal on the virtual reservation.\n\nVisual Sovereignty\n\nFrom Michelle Rahaja: \"a way of reimagining Native-centered articulations of self-representation and autonomy that engage the powerful ideologies of mass media. Under visual sovereignty, filmmakers can deploy individual and community assertions of what sovereignty and self-representation mean and, through new media technologies frame more imaginative renderings of Native American intellectual and cultural paradigms.\"\n\nSurvivance\n\nCoined by Ojibwe writer Gerald Vizenor: more than mere survival, resistance to domination; active and creative responses to colonialism. A fundamental concept to American Indian Studies. Imagination and creativity are the most important responses to colonization (Simon Ortiz)."
