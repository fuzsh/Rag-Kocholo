        "text": "Leave it to an artist to get to the very essence of her art in one deft turn of phrase. It happened last night, at the Jacob Burns Film Center, in Pleasantville, New York (just fifty minutes from the city), where Elaine May—after a screening of the last of her four feature films to date, the wrongly maligned masterwork “Ishtar”—answered questions onstage from the producer Julian Schlossberg and from members of the audience (the house was full). One spectator, aptly enthusing about May’s first feature, “A New Leaf,” from 1971, in which she also stars, asked which of the aspects of filmmaking—writing, directing, acting—she prefers. May’s answer (which I transcribed on the fly) was:\n\nThey’re really different parts of the brain. Writing is close to acting. In directing, you control. Acting, you can’t control how good you are, and you can’t control how good you are when you write. You can try to be good. Directing, you can’t really control either, but you can think about it.\n\nThe decisive insight is the proximity of writing and acting, and the reservation of a special status for the thing that makes movies special, directing. It’s also what makes May one of the major filmmakers of her time—hell, one of the best filmmakers ever to work in Hollywood—and why the story of her directorial career, and its undue truncation, is one of the great tragedies of movie history. It’s a story that May touched on in the course of last night’s discussion.\n\nShe expressed some bitterness at the release and the commercial and critical failure of “Ishtar,” and reserved choice words for the head of Columbia Pictures at the time, David Puttnam (“whom I consider a major putz”). Puttnam had come to the studio with a plan to transform the industry by reining in budgets and salaries; as May said, “We have such respect for the English that, when an Englishman says Hollywood sucks, people listen.” Puttnam didn’t produce the movie; he inherited it from his predecessors when he took over the studio, in 1986, and though he didn’t publicly bad-mouth it he also didn’t publicly promote it (and, in fact, claimed that he hadn’t seen it and had no intention of ever doing so). As Peter Biskind wrote in his biography of Warren Beatty, the movie’s co-star and producer, “Ishtar was being distributed by an unfriendly studio that Beatty suspected was leaking damaging items to the press.” May said last night that her former performing partner and lifelong friend Mike Nichols called Columbia’s handling of the film “one of the only times a major studio committed suicide.”\n\n“Ishtar” was an expensive film to make, but what dominated news reports in the months prior to its release—and, as Schlossberg mentioned, what most critics seemed to review—was the budget rather than the movie. The film itself is a wildly original work of genius that suffered the fate of many works of genius: being out of step with its time. (Its story, which puts Beatty and the other star, Dustin Hoffman, in the roles of pathetic losers, may well have seemed like an act of cinematic lèse-majesté at the time.)\n\nThere’s a special place in Hell reserved for critics who worried about the budget of this film, or about the budgets of Michael Cimino’s “Heaven’s Gate,” of Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s “Cleopatra,” of Erich von Stroheim’s “Greed” (that is, of any film where the critical question was anything other than that of the experience of watching the film). It’s routine for studios to spend big in the hope of earning bigger, and May said last night that she had a popular movie in mind. But the notion of a single artist commanding the enormous resources of a studio in pursuit of a personal vision (however potentially commercial the project may also have seemed) is an offense to sensibilities that are far more invested in the system at large than in the potentially mold-breaking exceptions. What emerged in the negative reviews of “Ishtar” was, above all, the resentments of smaller temperaments at an individual who was able to turn mighty resources and a mighty budget into something original—starting with the transformation of its stars.\n\nMay emphasized her political intentions in making “Ishtar.” She said that she was inspired by a viewing of one of the “Road” movies, starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and that her original plan was to call the movie “The Road to Ishtar.” Beatty was the one who wouldn’t allow the title, she said, because he worried that “they’ll compare us to Hope and Crosby.” But that, May said, was exactly the point. Her motive in writing a story about two depressingly bad singer-songwriters who accept a gig in Morocco and get caught up in geopolitical struggles was expressly political. (The C.I.A.—an agent played by Charles Grodin—and local revolutionaries—most centrally, one played by Isabelle Adjani—provide the mainspring of the plot.) May said that, at the time, “the U.S. was all over the Middle East,” and so she wrote a story about “two schmucks with ambitions who went to a country where we were.”\n\nRevisiting a masterwork is like seeing a dear friend again; it will be fun and you will learn something important. Writing about “Ishtar” before, I emphasized May’s depiction of artistic obsession, as an object of derision, a source of wild comedy, and nonetheless a tenderly sad tumult of affection. But seeing it again last night I was struck by something else: the film’s view of the paranoid, intimate politics of partnership, and the way that it emerges from May’s supremely precise direction.\n\nWhen the musicians, Lyle Rogers (Beatty) and Chuck Clarke (Hoffman), reach North Africa, they get drawn into the orbits of two main political players there (the figures portrayed by Adjani and Grodin). It’s not giving too much away to say that, as soon as politics enters the equation, the two performing partners and best friends begin keeping secrets from each other. Their deceptions and recognitions, their suspicions and their silences, open a virtual abyss of fear and despair which they skirt thanks only to their obliviousness and to their desperate ambition—and which May captures in amazingly rapid scenes of action and dialogue that spin and lurch mercurially on a line, a glance, a hesitation. Her comic framings, her sense of distance and proximity as well as timing, are matched by her sense of gesture and inflection—exquisite moments of performance that required a great deal of labor on the part of her and the actors. Much of the budget went to buying the time to achieve such precision.\n\nThere’s a level of invention, a depth of reflection, and a tangle of emotions in “Ishtar” which are reached by few films and few filmmakers. May’s four films are among the treasures of the cinema over all. Chatting before the screening, a young critic and I marvelled at the tone that May struck in her third film, “Mikey and Nicky,” from 1976, and its distinction from her other three films. I added that it seems like an exception only because of her grievously truncated career—and that, had May directed the dozen or more features that she could have made in the past forty years, she’d doubtless have displayed many other tones and registers.\n\nThe screening of “Ishtar” came in the context of the Westchester Jewish Film Festival, ambitiously programmed by Bruni Burres, at the Burns Center, which includes a retrospective of May’s features. Next up, on April 5th, is the rarest of them—“The Heartbreak Kid,” from 1972—followed by a discussion with its star Charles Grodin.\n\nA modest proposal: May should write her memoirs. Or, maybe, talk them—into a camera, for a film that would run four hours or so, with few or no clips, graphics, or music, none of the usual portrait-documentary paraphernalia. Just let Elaine May talk; she hasn’t been able to make a feature since “Ishtar,” and the world of movies—the world—is poorer and duller for her exile."
