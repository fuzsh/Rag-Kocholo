        "text": "Room Usage Policies\n\nPlease review the planning guidelines at https://vaden.stanford.edu/super/education/parties/party-planning-guide.\n\nWhen scheduling an event, please allow at least 1 hour between the end of the previous event and the beginning of your event.\n\nEvent Organizers are responsible for the cleaning, trash removal, and returning chairs and tables to the room’s previous configuration immediately following an event. To allow adequate time for clean-up, it is recommended that reservations for parties or large gatherings end one hour later than the end of the event e.g., events that end at 10:00 p.m. should schedule their reservation to end at 11:00 p.m. For smaller events, we suggest a 30 minute extension between the actual end of the event and the end of the reservation. Although the majority of cleaning tasks will occur once participants have left, it is recommended that you begin some clean-up activities about 30 minutes before the event ends, i.e., pick up trash, take trash and recyclables to the trash removal area, etc. Please encourage participants to quietly and quickly retrieve bicycles and depart from the areas surrounding the building to minimize disruption to nearby residents.\n\nGroups/individuals who repeatedly fail to show up for a reservation will lose their reservation privilege.\n\nGroups/individuals who are not present at the event they have reserved the space for may lose their reservation privilege.\n\nGCC-Specific Policies:\n\nIf children (toddlers and up) are involved in the reservation, the children’s playroom (Sydney) must be reserved concurrently; at least one adult must supervise children inside the playroom at all times.\n\nAll scheduled events and drop-in use must end no later than 10:45 p.m., 15 minutes before the GCC closing time of 11:00 p.m.\n\nHacienda/Great Room/Havana-Specific Policies:\n\nThe first week of each quarter is for CA/GLO reservations only.\n\nCA/GLO events can bump other events with 3-day notice.\n\nHavana-Specific Policies:\n\nReservation hours: Sunday – Saturday 9:00 a.m. - 11:00 p.m.\n\nHavana Food Policy: If an event requires food and beverage or alcohol in the Havana Room, Ray’s Grill at the GCC must be contacted at least 1 week in advance.\n\nDrop-In Policy: Each room may be utilized on a drop-in basis (still subject to the eligibility listed below). If the room is available, the group representative must sign in at the respective Housing Service Center and agree to take responsibility for the space while in use for the drop-in event. Drop-in users will be held to the same policies as groups that have reserved it online. Interested students may inquire in-person at the respective Housing Service Center between 3:00 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday - Friday.\n\nCleaning and Care of Rooms\n\nGroups and individual users are responsible for all cleaning immediately following an event. Cleaning includes wiping tables free of any spills, vacuuming carpeted area, sweeping and mopping tile and hardwood floors. Collect and remove all trash and recyclables and place them in appropriate receptacles.\n\nGCC: Cleaning supplies are located in the first floor janitor's closet across from the vending machines.\n\nUsers of kitchens or kitchenettes are required to clean all inside and outside surfaces of appliances. The stove and microwave can only be used to heat food for scheduled events. Appliances must be turned off immediately following use.\n\nReposition tables and chairs to their original location and return any borrowed tables and chairs to storage areas.\n\nGCC: Additional chairs are located in the 1st floor storage area and in room 211 on the 2nd floor. Please return extra chairs to storage areas following your event.\n\nRay’s Grill: Furniture and carpets in the Ray’s Grill area cannot be moved. If additional furniture is needed, please use the tables and chairs located in the first floor storage area.\n\nFurniture may not be moved between rooms.\n\nFailure to clean and ready a room for subsequent use will result in cleaning charges that will be billed to the group or the individual user. Damage to rooms or furniture will also be billed to the group or the individual user. Repeated incidents of failure to clean or damage by a group or an individual may result in denial of future reservation privileges.\n\nDecorations, flyers, etc. cannot be adhered to wall surfaces and cannot be hung or attached to ceiling.\n\nCandles are prohibited.\n\nPlease exercise care during set-up and clean-up. Do not stand on tables or chairs. Be alert to slippery floor surfaces during cleaning."
