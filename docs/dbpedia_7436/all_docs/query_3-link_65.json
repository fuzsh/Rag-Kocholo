        "text": "Great cinema can be a feast for the eyes ‚Äì and a great cinematic meal can be as fulfilling as a literal feast. Done right, watching food onscreen can be a sensorial experience akin to actually consuming it, especially when it becomes part of the narrative itself. On this list of the most delectable scenes ever put on film, we‚Äôre serving up moments that‚Äôll make your mouth water, cause your stomach to growl and maybe even cause you to loosen your belt. (Please be mindful if you‚Äôre on public transport or at work.) Some might also make you feel a bit nauseous ‚Äì the act of eating isn‚Äôt always pretty, after all. In any case, get your antacids ready and belly up for the best food-on-film moments ever.\n\nRecommended:\n\nüî• The 100 best movies of all-time\n\nüí∞ The 50 best gangster movies of all-time\n\nüòç The 70 best romantic comedies of all-time\n\nRaging Bull (1980): The charcoal steak\n\nAn overcooked steak ignites boxer Jake LaMotta's wrath in Martin Scorsese's violent sports flick. Robert De Niro's belligerent backseat cooking (\"You overcook it, it's no good. It defeats its own purpose\") and furious table flip is bone-rattling stuff‚Äîbut we briefly consider a similar reaction each time a restaurant presents us with an incinerated slab of beef.\n\nAnnie Hall (1977): Boiling lobsters\n\nWoody Allen and Diane Keaton's calamitous attempt to boil live lobsters perfectly captures the conflicting feelings we face each time we plunge those icky but luscious crustaceans into the scorching water: Gleeful but guilty, rapacious and a little terrified. Too bad we don't get to see Woody in a bib.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Hours (2002): Separating eggs\n\nThough Meryl Streep would go on to portray Francophile chef Julia Child in 2009's Julie & Julia, she caught our eye in the kitchen seven years earlier in this drama. Streep‚Äîwho portrays a troubled New York editor planning a party for a friend at the end of his life‚Äîis most affecting when she meticulously separates eggs, concentrating intensely on the task even as she threatens to crack.\n\nGold Rush (1925): The roll dance\n\nCharlie Chaplin's iconic dinner-roll dance has been replicated and parodied so many times, it's incredible the genuine article still has legs. (Rim shot!) Though Chaplin wasn't the first to try the gag (Fatty Arbuckle deployed a similar stunt in 1917 film The Rough House), the Tramp's eyebrow-wiggling, shoulder-shrugging rendition of the tabletop ballet is unsurpassed.\n\nAdvertising\n\nGoodfellas (1990): Dinner in prison\n\nDamn, it tastes good to be a gangster. Halfway through Martin Scorsese‚Äôs crime epic, a crew of mobsters ‚Äì including Ray Liotta‚Äôs Henry Hill and Paul Sorvino‚Äôs Paulie ‚Äì are sent up the river on various charges, but it looks like an extended vacation away from their wives rather than serving hard time. Not only do they get to live together away from the general population, they eat better than most of us on the outside ever do. As Bobby Darin croons ‚ÄòBeyond the Sea‚Äô, Paulie thin-slices garlic with a razor blade between sips of scotch while Johnny Dio fries up a medium rare steak with a massive cigar hanging from his mouth. Sure, Vinnie‚Äôs tomato sauce is a bit onion-forward, but who can complain?\n\nThe Godfather (1972): Tomato sauce recipe\n\nThe only red splatter more ubiquitous than blood in Mafia flicks may be pasta sauce. Those who wish to make their own would benefit from a close viewing of the original Godfather. Capo Peter Clemenza‚Äîthe same trencherman who utters the line \"leave the gun, take the cannoli\" elsewhere in the film‚Äîoffers a decent recipe for Sunday gravy: \"You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; you make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar‚Äîthat's my trick.\"\n\nAdvertising\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America (1984): The charlotte russe\n\nPatrick \"Patsy\" Goldberg has one foot in his youth and the other in adulthood when he ventures to trade a charlotte russe‚Äîa white cake pastry topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry‚Äîfor sexual favors in Sergio Leone's sweeping crime epic. He picks out the five-cent confection from a local bakery (\"for the two-penny one she only gives you a hand job; I can do that myself\") and brings it to Peggy, an underage harlot. He foils his chance to seal the deal while waiting for her in the stairwell, swiping fingerfuls of cream from the cake and eventually devouring the thing in a few desperate bites.\n\nPulp Fiction (1994): $5 shake\n\nWould a chick as cool and dishy as Mia Wallace really choose a restaurant like Jack Rabbit Slim's for her faux date with Vincent Vega? We're not so sure. Nonetheless, the fictional 1950s theme restaurant is a rich and bizarre setting for our favorite Pulp Fiction food moment. John Travolta's take on whether Mia's extravagant \"Martin and Lewis\" (vanilla) milk shake is worth its $5 price tag: \"Goddamn, that's a pretty fucking good milk shake.\"\n\nAdvertising\n\nCool Hand Luke (1967): 50 hard-boiled eggs in one hour\n\nThanks to the exploits of famous competitive eaters like Takeru Kobayashi, we're rarely dazzled anymore by feats of gluttony. But Paul Newman's shirtless 50-egg coup in this prison drama still sparkles. As the unvanquishable Lucas Jackson, Newman earns the respect of his fellow inmates by wolfing 50 peeled eggs until his stomach is distended‚Äîin the words of one prisoner‚Äî\"like a ripe watermelon that's about to bust itself open.\"\n\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962): Rats for lunch\n\nJoan Crawford, as the wheelchair-bound Blanche, and Bette Davis as her villainous sister and abusive caretaker, Jane, face off in this delightfully perverse thriller. When the rapidly unraveling Jane serves Blanche her lunch beneath a silver dome, you just know there's foul play afoot. Blanche's shrieking, hysterical reaction to the meal‚Äîa juicy, tail-and-all rat‚Äîis good, twisted fun.\n\nBack to School (1986): Rodney Dangerfield's hors d'oeuvres sandwich\n\nInstead of going the socially acceptable small-plate route, Dangerfield's self-loathing character, Thornton Melon, loads up a hollowed-out roll with hors d'oeuvres (\"I hate small food, you know?\") as fellow partygoers look on in horror. Just another reason the man can't get no respect.\n\nWaitress (2007): Pies\n\nPies play the role of an edible mood ring in this feel-good comedy about small-town girl Jenna (Keri Russell) trying to bake her way out of an unfulfilling marriage. Any emotion that consumes her ultimately becomes a dessert‚Äîthere's the Pregnant Self-Pitying Loser Pie (\"Lumpy oatmeal with fruitcake mashed in. Flambed, of course...\"), the I Can't Have No Affair Because It's Wrong and I Don't Want Earl to Kill Me Pie (\"Vanilla custard with banana. Hold the banana\"), and the Naughty Pumpkin Pie that she bakes in hopes of wooing Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). The results of each creation are pure eye candy, shot with food-porny close-ups from above as they come together in mixing bowls and pastry molds.\n\nAdvertising\n\nLast Tango in Paris (1972): Butter sex\n\nItalian director Bernardo Bertolucci's steamy drama sparked censorship battles around the world and earned an X rating when it was first released to the U.S. (The Village Voice reported \"vomiting by well-dressed wives\" at an early screening.) Much of the controversy zeroed in this explicit scene, in which Paul‚Äîplayed by Marlon Brando‚Äîforever changed the way we look at the butter tray.\n\nMystic Pizza (1988): Superb review\n\nThe food critic's affected intonation and over-the-top snobbery is a tad dated in this '80s flick. Still, there's heartwarming appeal when a \"superb\" review on TV sends a small-time pizzeria crew into ecstatic squeals of delight. Even the most serious four-star chefs must feel the same elation when a laudatory review drops.\n\nAdvertising\n\nHot Shots! (1991): Breakfast scene\n\nBefore he was a tiger-blood‚Äìfueled rock star from Mars, Charlie Sheen broke hearts and eggs as Lt. Topper Harley in this Top Gun parody. Here, he's #winning at cooking a full breakfast‚Äîeggs, bacon and hash browns‚Äîon his lover's smokin' hot stomach.\n\nTran Anh Hung‚Äôs sumptuous foodie-and-romance epic opens with an almost entirely dialogue-free cooking scene that runs for 38 minutes. Which is longer than an entire episode of Simply Nigella and every bit as mouthwatering. This gastronomic production line ‚Äì a quiet symphony of poaching, sizzling and sauce-making ‚Äì is the prelude to an equally glorious love story between Juliette Binoche‚Äôs gifted chef and Beno√Æt Magimel‚Äôs devoted gourmet. Quick warning: it will make you unfeasibly hungry.\n\nAdvertising\n\nMostly Martha (2001): Walk-in-fridge breakdown\n\nIn this German flick, a precursor to 2001's No Reservations with Catherine Zeta-Jones, Martina Gedeck embodies Martha Klein‚Äîa toque who, like many real-life chefs, is Type A to a fault. Despite her neuroses and petulance, you can't help but feel for the central character when she puts on a strong public face after her sister's death, before hightailing it to the walk-in to sob in private. Kelly Cutrone would be proud.\n\nSoul Food (1997): Cooking lesson\n\nBig Mama Joe says it best: \"Soul-food cookin' is about cooking from the heart.\" No matter what she's preparing, the Joseph family matriarch follows her instincts rather than a recipe, understanding that sometimes good cooking is as much about the feeling you put into your food as the technique you use to prepare it.\n\nAdvertising\n\nVolver (2006): Film crew feast\n\nWe're not sure Penelope Cruz can cook in real life, but damn, does she make a convincing chef in this Spanish-language drama. When her restaurateur neighbor suddenly leaves town, she steps up and churns out a three-course meal of local specialties for 30 film-crew members without missing a step‚Äîor revealing the dead body lying in her kitchen.\n\nBabette's Feast (1987): The feast\n\nWhen a French housekeeper (the film's titular heroine) wins the lottery, she unselfishly uses her new fortunate to prepare a sumptuous meal for her employers, two pious Danish sisters and their fellow parishioners. Though the diners attempt to deny the earthly pleasures of fine red wine, decadent cheeses and other Gallic edibles, their eyes glaze over with hedonistic delight as they politely but ravenously scrape their plates clean."
