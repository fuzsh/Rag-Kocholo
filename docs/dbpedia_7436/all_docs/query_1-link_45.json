        "text": "Join us this summer to celebrate our 24th season of Movies With A View Presented by Pluto TV! Our free outdoor movies are shown on Thursday evenings in July and August, at Pier 1 Harbor View Lawn. See the line-up below!\n\nThere is no better place to be on a hot summer night than watching a classic film and enjoying the breeze off of the East River with the dazzling Manhattan skyline before you. Each evening, the lawn opens at 5:00 PM on a first come, first serve basis, and the movie begins at sunset. Enjoy a range of concessions and beverages for sale on site, along with our Bar by Fornino for those 21+ to enjoy.\n\nThis year’s lineup of free screenings is presented by Pluto TV, the leading free streaming television service, who will be giving away exciting movie night essentials during the pre-screening festivities. Pluto TV is honored to team up with Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy’s Movies With A View to bring movie fans a summer of fun!\n\nWe also thank the MWAV Volunteer Film Committee. The Committee reviews, debates, introduces, and recommends films to the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy that represent a wide range of genres and experiences across decades of cinema’s rich history. The Committee strives to elevate and amplify important voices and to celebrate the diversity all of us experience every day in New York City. Because the movies we love and the stories they tell are not only entertaining – they can teach us, challenge us, move us, and transform us."
