Such an idea of history’s importance in the building of one’s character manifests in the movie Smoke Signals. In Smoke Signals, author Sherman Alexie uses literary devices such as costumes, flashbacks, a detailed narrative, and other devices to create two distinct characters, Victor Joseph and Thomas Builds-The-Fire, that symbolize a clash between Native American culture and modern society through the theme of storytelling.

On the other hand, Thomas Builds-The-Fire symbolizes an embrace of the present and future, as demonstrated by Alexie’s use of oral traditions, costumes, and allegories. For instance, Thomas represents the future through his uplifting storytelling. Thomas, similarly to Victor, experienced trauma in his childhood, but it is made obvious that the two are practically opposites. To cope with the past, Thomas uses oral"
