        "text": "DVD Sales - Alvin Repeats on Top\n\nApril 21st, 2008\n\nDespite numerous new releases that charted this week, seven in fact, Alvin and the Chipmunks remained in top spot on the DVD sales chart. It's rare for a film to repeat on top of the charts, but Alvin was able to do so despite a 72% drop-off from its opening and added 872,000 units and $14.38 million in spending. This lifts its total to 4.02 million units / $66.34 million making it the third best selling DVD of the year so far. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - There Will Be a New Number One\n\nApril 21st, 2008\n\nLike on the sales chart there were plenty of new releases. However, there was a new number on film on the rental chart as There Will Be Blood opened in first place with $8.54 million. I did find it strange that a critically acclaimed, Oscar winning movie would do better on the rental charts than the sales charts. Usually this happens when people want to try before they buy, but this doesn't seem the type of movie that would happen with. More...\n\nDVD Releases for April 8, 2008\n\nApril 7th, 2008\n\nIt was a good week for top-notch releases with plenty that are worth picking up. But there were two films that were obvious choices for DVD Pick of the Week: Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story and Adventures of Baron Munchausen. In both cases, I would recommend the Blu-ray versions over the DVD. (On a side note, there were a few late spotlight reviews this week, and next week there will be a few more. Hopefully I will catch up by then, but there's always a chance that more screeners will arrive late in the meantime.) More...\n\nStill in Control on the Per Theater Chart\n\nOctober 23rd, 2007\n\nWhile there were plenty of new releases this past weekend, most failed to make an impact at the box office and that left Control an opportunity to capture first place with $19,121. This represents a drop-off of only 30% in its per theater average despite doubling its theater count. Meanwhile, Wristcutters: A Love Story opened in second place with an average of $14,269 in three theaters. Finally, Blade Runner managed more than $10,000 on the per theater chart for the third weekend in a row with $13,004. More...\n\nMovie Website Reviews for Weekend of October 19, 2007\n\nOctober 21st, 2007\n\nBusy week in terms of wide and limited releases with well over a dozen sites on this week's list. Although most struggled to stand out, there were a couple that helped sell their respective movies very well, including the winner of the Weekly Website Award, 30 Days of Night - Official Site. More...\n\nMore Films Stall on the Road to the Oscars\n\nOctober 19th, 2007\n\nAnother big list of limited releases this week, including the Canadian film Weirdsville, again. However, unlike recent weeks, none of the films seem destined to be Oscar hopefuls and most will disappear without making much noise at all. More...\n\nContest - Night of Prizes\n\nOctober 12th, 2007\n\nThe weekend of October 19 is busy for new releases with five earning some degree of wideness. Out out of those five films, 30 Days of Night has the best shot at first place and it is the target film in this week's box office prediction contest. To win one must simply predict the box office opening for 30 Days of Night. Whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going over, will win a Lars are the Real Girl poster, Resevation Road poster and Soundtrack, as well as the Gone, Baby, Gone novel. Meanwhile, whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going under, will win the exact same prize pack mentioned above. Finally, one lucky entrant will be chosen arbitrarily and that person will win a Gone, Baby, Gone poster. Entries must be received by 10 a.m., Pacific Time on Friday to be eligible, so don't delay! More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - July 1, 2007\n\nJuly 1st, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for The Hunting Party, The Good Night, John Rambo and more. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - September 24, 2006\n\nSeptember 24th, 2006"
