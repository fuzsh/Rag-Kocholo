        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGeneral\n\nInformation about California’s $330 million Film & Television Tax Credit Program is available from the California Film Commission, which manages this program. More information can be found on the California Film Commission website.\n\nHosting productions at your home or place of business can be a fun and rewarding experience. The California Film Commission publishes \"how to\" guides for those looking to become film hosts. In L.A., there are several companies (generally known as “Location Services”) prepared to help you promote your properties for filming, for a fee. A list of Location Services can be found on the CFC's website.\n\nGenerally speaking, FilmLA does not promote private properties for filming purposes.\n\nThe parking of production vehicles adjacent to film locations is a common and legal practice, with a permit. “No Parking” signs will be posted to facilitate parking of necessary production vehicles. Importantly, although production vehicles are allowed on location, individual cast and crew members are not allowed to take up additional parking with their own personal vehicles. This rule is to keep the production impact as small as possible. It is the responsibility of the production company to arrange off-site parking for cast and crew.\n\nFor filming at Los Angeles City Hall or other City properties that are managed by the General Services Department, please contact FilmLA’s Solution Services. You can also find some additional information on the LocoScout listing.\n\nFilm Permits\n\nFilm permits are intended for use when filming is your primary business purpose. Special events permits cover a wider range of activity (for example, marches, concerts, public assemblies). A special event may include some limited on-site filming for documentation or publicity purposes, and this will not generally require a separate film permit. If you have questions about film permit requirements generally, FilmLA’s Solution Services Team stands ready to assist you.\n\nSee these articles for guidance:\n\n>>Do I Need a Film Permit? Some Guidance From FilmLA\n\n>>Film Permits vs. Event Permits: Clearing Up the Confusion\n\nA permit is generally limited to a maximum of five filming locations. Your application may include other related Location Authorizations for parking and base camps, etc. These do not count against your filming location limit.\n\nA permit generally has a maximum timespan of seven consecutive days.\n\nIn order to deliver a high level of service to all customers, FilmLA is unable to accept late applications for filming. Late applications will be rejected, and the FilmLA Application Fee will not be refunded.\n\nPlease be sure prior to submitting an permit application that you meet the minimum time required for application processing. Minimum permit processing time varies by jurisdiction and requested film activities can be researched in the Area Requirements section of this website.\n\nContact Solution Services at 213.977.8600 if you are unclear about the timelines that apply in your situation.\n\nOnce you submit your application and pay your non-refundable FilmLA Application Fee, your request will be reviewed by our Permit Assignment Desk. Once the activity, locations, insurance status, and necessary documents have been verified, your permit will be assigned to a Production Coordinator and a confirmation email will be sent to you. Your Production Coordinator will contact you afterwards to review the application further and discuss questions or required next steps.\n\nWe understand that it is sometimes necessary for customers to cancel a location or reschedule an upcoming shoot. Our ability to help in these circumstances depends on the status of your permit application at the time you notify us of the need for changes.\n\nGenerally speaking, the earlier you notify FilmLA of necessary changes, the greater our ability to assist and potentially help recover your investment in City/County film permits. Please note that FilmLA’s application fee is due when an application is submitted and is always nonrefundable.\n\nIf you need to cancel or reschedule any or all locations PRIOR to final permit distribution, FilmLA may be able to help you reschedule your shoot without the need to pay an additional application fee or rider fee.\n\nFor all permit cancellations, customers must request to reschedule within a specific time. The first film date for any rescheduled location may not occur more than 30 days from the first film date included on your initial permit application, and all rescheduled shoots must be completed within 7 days of your new first filming date.\n\nFor example: A permit with two locations is applied for on 12/15, with permit distribution scheduled for 12/18. The first filming date among the two locations is 1/1. Due to unforeseen circumstances, all of the locations on the permit must be cancelled and FilmLA is informed of this on 12/17 and prior to permit distribution. Because the permit has not been distributed, the application will be kept open, and FilmLA will extend the application window to allow first film dates no later than 2/1. All work on this permit must then be complete by 2/7. Provided the rescheduled shoot can be accomplished within these new dates, FilmLA will not charge the customer a second application fee.\n\nIf you need to cancel or reschedule any or all locations AFTER final permit distribution, please contact your Production Coordinator to discuss your situation and we will help you to the best of our ability. Your Production Coordinator will work with you to determine if we can potentially accommodate rescheduling new dates via a rider.\n\nAll rescheduled shoot dates must be completed within 7 days from the first film date included on your initial permit application. Any new dates beyond the 7-day window of the original first film date will require a new permit application to be submitted, and a new application fee will apply.\n\nFilmLA is unable to make any commitments concerning refunds of fees in the event of a cancellation. If a permitted activity is cancelled and adequate notice is given, FilmLA will work with you and affected government agencies to retrieve fees that have been paid on your behalf. Please contact your permit coordinator for assistance. Please note that the final decision about the refund of fees for a permit that was cancelled will be made by the respective government agency.\n\nA rider is required any time a change is made to a permit after it has been finalized. FilmLA charges an additional fee for rider processing.\n\nPayments and Refunds\n\nWhen you request a film permit from FilmLA, you agree to pay all FilmLA required fees and charges, including, but not limited to: permit application fees, notification fees and monitoring fees. Total fees applied to your permit will vary depending on the location(s) used, type of production, and the impact and duration of your proposed filming activity. For example, a complex still photo shoot with a large impact, street closures, significant amount of posting, special effects, or a cast / crew larger than 15 people, can greatly exceed the standard application fee.\n\nThe FilmLA monitor service is charged in hourly increments based on time at location. For example, if monitor service is required from 6am-10pm, the breakdown of service hours would be 8 Regular hours, 4 overtime hours, and 4 double time hours to cover the service, whether completed by one or multiple monitors.\n\nGovernment-required fees must also be paid when you retrieve your permit. Please note that FilmLA does not set or control the filming-related fees charged by its government partners. Filming at City parks, for example, will generate use fees. Use of City or County personnel to protect public safety or property during filming will generate personnel fees.\n\nApplication Fees and Process\n\nOne application fee allows up to 5 production locations within 7 consecutive days. Exceptions are made for Reality\n\nShow projects.\n\nAfter submitting your first location and paying the application fee, you will be able to enter your other locations without\n\nan additional application fee charge, as long as the locations fit within the following constraints:\n\nOnce your first location under an application fee is released, you will no longer be able to add new Production Locations. Any new Production Locations will incur a new application fee.\n\nBase Camp and Crew Parking locations will not count toward your 5-location limit, but they must fall within the 7-day window.\n\nAny location added after your application fee is paid that does not fit within the 7 days of your other location(s) will incur a new application fee.\n\nYour finalized permit must be paid for in full before release. You must make payment by 6PM on the business day prior to your first activity day. The law requires you to keep a physical copy of your permit onsite to avoid production shutdown.\n\nBasic Fees\n\nRATEPER Permit Application Fee\n\nUp to 5 Locations, 7 Consecutive Days$931 Permit Drone Administration Fee$78 Involved Location Helicopter Administration Fee$78 Involved Location Gunfire Administration Fee$78 Involved Location Special FX - Explosion & Smoke Administration Fee$78 Involved Location Lane Closure Administration Fee$78 Involved Location Permit Rider Fee\n\nDuring Business Hours$148.75 Rider Permit Rider Fee\n\nAfter Business Hours $208 Rider Non-Profit (PSA) Permit App Fee$73 Permit Non-Profit (PSA) Permit Rider Fee$36 Rider Still Photo Application Fee*\n\nCast/Crew of 16+ requires Motion Rate $104 Permit Still Photo Rider Fee$31 Rider Student Permit Fee (simple)$52 Permit Student Permit Fee (complex)$134 Permit Notification Fee\n\nBase Radius$232 Radius FilmLA Monitor Fee**\n\nMinimum Applies. Subject to OT and DT.$44.50 Hour * Still photo productions with a cast / crew size of 16 or more people will incur the Motion application fee. Any B-roll or motion filming in conjunction with a still photo shoot will also incur the Motion rate. Additionally, for crews of this size or larger, an $271.00 LAFD Spot Check Surcharge will also be assessed.\n\n** The FilmLA monitor service is charged in hourly increments based on time at location. For example, if monitor service is required from 6am-10pm, the breakdown of service hours would be 8 Regular hours, 4 overtime hours, and 4 double time hours to cover the service, whether completed by one or multiple monitors.\n\nWe recognize that all filmmakers work within a limited production budget. Reviewing your filming plans with a FilmLA staff member can help you avoid use of locations and/or activities that will increase your total permit cost. Your FilmLA Production Coordinator or Production Planning staff member can assist you in exploring your options.\n\nPayment\n\nPayments can be made with a US or international credit card (processing fees apply).\n\nFilmLA's application fee is due when your application is submitted for processing. The application fee is non-refundable, even if you later elect to withdraw your permit application.\n\nYour finalized permit must be paid for in full before release. You must make payment by 6PM on the business day prior to your first activity day. The law requires you to keep a physical copy of your permit onsite to avoid production shutdown.\n\nBefore applying for a permit, please be sure you meet the minimum time required for application processing. Minimum permit processing time varies by jurisdiction and can be researched in the Area Requirements of this website.\n\nTiming\n\nLate applications will be rejected, and the application fee will not be refunded. Contact Solution Services at 213.977.8600 if you are unclear about the timelines that apply in your situation.\n\nFor basic permits, we typically need 3-7 business days to process a permit. Processing times vary based on activity and jurisdiction. More complicated permits (street closures, gunfire, special effects, etc.) and those with locations in other jurisdictions that we serve may need 5 to 7 business days.\n\nFilmLA does not offer reduced rates to non-profit organizations. We do offer a rate reduction for non-profit organizations working on public service announcements (PSAs) that advance knowledge of the non-profit's mission and services. See this information packet for the full list eligibility requirements, including limits on project size and community impact.\n\nNon-profit Permit Information Packet\n\nAs a convenience to filmmakers, all fees payable to FilmLA and most estimated city and county fees related to your film permit can be processed within MyFilmLA.\n\nFilmLA's application fee is due when your application is submitted for processing. The application fee is non-refundable, even if you later elect to withdraw your permit application.\n\nShould changes be made to your permit requiring payment of additional fees for FilmLA or government services (aka “final charges”), a new invoice will be generated reflecting these charges.\n\nYour finalized permit must be paid for in full before release. You must make payment by 6PM on the business day prior to your first activity day. The law requires you to keep a physical copy of your permit onsite to avoid production shutdown.\n\nPayment options for all transactions include credit card, debit card, or FilmLA business account. Cash, cashier’s checks, money orders, and business checks are not accepted.\n\nCredit Card / Debit Cards\n\nFilmLA accepts electronic payment via major credit card and debit card. All card transactions are subject to a nonrefundable processing fee, assessed by our payment processor. This fee (typically falling between 3% and 4%) will vary with the total cost of your permit or license.\n\nUse of a credit card issued by a non-US bank will result in an additional 1% transaction fee, billed and collected by FilmLA as a separate final charge.\n\nElectronic payment eliminates the need for office visits to submit payments and pick up documents. If payment is made by credit card outside of regular business hours, documents will be delivered electronically the next business day.\n\nFilmLA Business Account\n\nEstablished companies may also apply for a business credit account with FilmLA. Acceptance to the “Permits on Account” program is based on creditworthiness and not guaranteed. There are no fees associated with use of this service.\n\nApplying for credit is simple. Complete and e-mail the Business Credit Application and Authorization to Verify Credit (see forms below) to AR@filmla.com. You will receive an email confirming receipt. Our Accounting Department may follow up to request additional information. You should expect to receive a final decision regarding your application by both email and mail within 30 days.\n\nBusiness Credit Application (.PDF)\n\nAuthorization to Verify Credit (.PDF)\n\nIf your permit or license required a security deposit and you are entitled to a refund of the deposit, FilmLA will return the deposit to you within 30 days of the time we have received all of the final charges from the government agency. There is no need for any additional action on your part.\n\nA portion of the fees FilmLA collects at the time of permit release are based on various government agencies’ estimates of their fees, based on the information you provide on your film permit application. Once filming is complete, each government agency sends FilmLA their final charges for facility use, personnel, and other charges, based on the actual work the agency performed at your request. If the final charges are less than the estimated charges, you may be entitled to a refund of the difference. If you believe you might be entitled to a refund, provide FilmLA with a completed Refund Request Form within 90 days of the completion of the permitted filming activities. Requests received after 90 days will not be considered.\n\nRefund Request Form (PDF)\n\nFilmLA will process the refund request once we have received the final charges from all of the agencies listed on the original permit and associated riders.\n\nPlease note that this can take some time; receipt of final charges from government agencies can take up to 60-90 days. Please note that permit application, permit rider and other processing fees assessed by FilmLA are non-refundable.\n\nFor your billing convenience, you may need a W-9 form filled out by FilmLA, which is provided below:\n\nFilmLA W-9 Form - 2024\n\nAdditionally, we can provide a California Form 590 Withholding Exemption Certificate to certify an exemption from nonresident withholding, below:\n\nCalifornia Form 590 - 2024 Withholding Exemption Certificate\n\nField Services\n\nFilmLA Monitors work to ensure compliance with film permit terms and provide on-set mediation between film production companies, neighbors, and merchants.

Notification Fees are due and payable when assigned for distribution. All revisions submitted two days or less prior to your first activity date will incur a reprint fee, with gunfire or exceptional activity incurring a fee for each section.

Contact the California Film Commission or State Parks at 818-880-0358 for information on availability and permitting requirements.\n\nYou may fill out a Beach reservation request form on our website (you must specify the tower numbers) and e-mail it to reservations@filmla.com. This is the only way to put beaches on hold without submitting a permit application. You may put up to 3 beaches on hold for a total of 5 days per beach. If you receive confirmation that we received your reservation and that there are no conflicts you can go ahead and submit your permit application to us. The use fee for filming on County Beaches is $400.00 per day in addition to your regular permit fees. If you are shooting at a beach within another City’s jurisdiction you may need to obtain a dual filming permit with that City as well.\n\nFor Santa Monica Beaches, call Community and Cultural Services for availability at 310-458-8300.\n\nComplete the reservation process as described above, and provide the specific parking lot name or number and number of parking spaces desired.
