        "text": "Confined within the borders of reservations Native identity suffers not only from the traumatic experiences of poverty, unemployment, broken families, alcoholism and oppression but also from systematic racist practices and stereotyping, which reduce the American Indian identity to noble savages, bloodthirsty warriors, prophetic shamans, or drunken outcasts. In resistance to Anglo-American attempts to erase Native identity many American Indian writers such as N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko, Louise Erdrich, James Welch, and Gerald Vizenor tried to preserve Native American tribal culture and history, and remedy the traumatized Native identity. This paper focuses on how Sherman Alexie in The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, standing apart from other Native American writers, portrays the Spokane Indian reservation life with a critical and cynical viewpoint on contemporary Native American's problems such as poverty, unemployment, hunger, drug addiction, alcoholism, and violence. The paper also discusses the insight Alexie brings to the Native identity problem through his critical reading of both the Native history/tradition and the white culture, and his critique of both the 'positive' and the negative stereotyping of the American Indian. The study is based on the premise that Sherman Alexie creates, borrowing from Homi Bhabha's terms, an 'interstitial space' in his answer to the question: how will the Native identity be constructed, based on the American Indian tribal culture, or the dominant Anglo culture, or is there an alternative way?\n\nThe image that the world has of Native Americans is mostly created by the media, particularly movies. This paper deals with movie representations of Native Americans during the 1950s and the 1990s, focusing on three examples: The Searchers (1956), Dances with Wolves (1990), and Smoke Signals (1998). Each of these movies contributed to shaping society’s perception of indigenous peoples and helped the development of stereotypes or stereotypes deconstruction. On the one hand, The Searchers is a typical representative of the western movies era and the depiction of Indians at that time. On the other hand, in some movies from the 1990s, such as Dances with Wolves, the cinematic portrayal of Native Americans changes, and they are shown in a different light. Furthermore, it is in this period that Native Americans start producing movies about themselves for the first time. Smoke Signals is one of the first successful movies written, directed, and produced by Native Americans, which finally creates a realistic image of indigenous peoples.\n\nThis chapter analyzes two recent popular Westerns, Andrew Dominik’s The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and Tommy Lee Jones’s The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005). In these films, the Western myth is replaced by a new myth, the ‘American Dream’, in which the lone legend is re-cast as family man and breadwinner. The old American frontier, as well, assumes a new dimension, moving from a utopian ‘frontier’ understood as the symbol of discovery, exploration, and Manifest Destiny, to a dystopian and defensive vision of a national border that must be protected against ‘illegals’. The chapter argues that Westerns, in offering themselves as alternative worlds to\n\nThis paper will explore innovations in mise-en-scène exhibited by the film Westerns of Anthony Mann. We will argue that Mann’s Westerns introduce an imagistic mise-en-scène that shifts the Western genre from theatrical staging of narrative action found in the classical-realist style of films such as Stagecoach and Red River, to a mise-en-scène that foreshortens landscape into a surface of hyper-real filmic affects. We follow Jeanine Basinger’s proposal to read Mann’s films in terms of what she calls the “total image.” The total image is a fusion of form and content so that meaning is produced out of the composition of elements in the film frame. However, our argument deviates significantly from Basinger’s. Instead of reducing the total image to an expression of the psychological state of the hero, as does Basinger, we understand the total image to be the film as a whole so that its parts are always working to produce the whole in a constantly adjusting process of figuration at the level of mise-en-scène. The paper will focus on one of Mann’s films: Bend of the River (1952), analysing the way it unfolds as a series of tableau images. Transcendent meaning is produced out of the interaction between the viewer and this unfolding tableau as a continual adjusting and rebalancing of the mise-en-scène. Character actions appear directly linked to non-human elements and to the landscape itself. At the level of transcendent meaning, these linkages produce a mythic event concerning the struggle with nature in a quest to establish a new community of free yeomen farmers, prefigured through the actions of the hero in his quest for redemption from a fallen past. Our paper proposes a reading of Mann’s Westerns as distinctly modernist in style, thus moving beyond the classical-realist style of film Westerns.\n\nThis article analyzes the metacinematic structure of Gore Verbinski’s The Lone Ranger and argues that it celebrates a form of camera consciousness that subordinates, rather than liberates the Tonto figure. Anchoring the film’s narrative frame, the diorama of the ‘Noble Savage’ establishes an animation paradigm between a masked white child and a Native American statue that is at odds with aims to subvert the original Ranger narrative. The white child awakens the statue to life, and Verbinski imagines this older philosophical and aesthetic formula as an emerging cinematic process in which the film projector transforms individual film stills into the moving image. With this, the boy’s gaze is more than one perspective among many; it both infuses the moving picture with a vital energy and, within the layers of the narrative, this gaze is focalized in the figure of the Ranger himself as he subdues the wild West and the people therein. Instead of a multiplicity of voices and selves in conversation with each other, Verbinski’s form of camera consciousness thereby constitutes a totalizing celebration of technological modernity that aligns the Ranger’s perspective with the movements of the projector and subordinates the Native American within this pattern of visual correspondences.

Both pictures, seen as largely ambiguous and ironic travelogue forms, expose their audiences to “the sheer beauty of the phenomenal world” (Sitney 2002: 182) and nurture nostalgic feelings for the lost indigenous civilizations, while simultaneously reinforcing the image of an American conquistador, hence creating a strong sense of dialectical tension. Moreover, albeit differing in a specific use of imagery and editing, the films rely on dense, collage-like and often superimposed images, which clearly contribute to the complexity of mood conveyed on screen and emphasize the striking conceptual contrast between white American and Indian culture. Taking such an assumption, I argue that although frequently referred to as epic road poems obliquely critical of the U.S. westward expansion and manifest destiny, the analyzed works’ use of plot reduction, observational and documentary style as well as kinaesthetic visual modes and rhythmic editing derive primarily from the cinéma pur’s camerawork, the cinéma vérité’s superstructure, and the city symphony’s spatial arrangement of urban environments. Such multifaceted inspirations do not only diversify Mass’ and Quixote’s non-narrative aesthetics, but also help document an intriguing psychogeography of the 1960s American landscapes, thus making a valuable contribution to the history of experimental filmmaking dealing with Native American Indian heritage."
