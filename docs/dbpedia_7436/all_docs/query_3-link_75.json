        "text": "Soaking in Mark Ruffalo‘s incisive, heart-rending performance in 2000’s You Can Count On Me, you’d figure he must’ve spent the ’90s quietly piecing together a career brick by brick, role by role, to have turned in such a performance in the Kenneth Lonergan drama. But, nope, a look at his “career” before 2000 reveals only bit parts with a line here, or a punch there, almost not worth mentioning. It made his star-marking appearance in You Can Count on Me all the more unexpected and revelatory.\n\nMomentum is like a train leaving a station whether you’re ready or not, and Ruffalo has latched on and never let go. He has since never really left the spotlight (literally, he was in Spotlight), forging ahead with a mix of dramas (Foxcatcher, The Normal Heart), lighter comedies (The Kids Are All Right, Date Night), and work with auteurs like David Fincher (Zodiac), Martin Scorsese (Shutter Island), and Michael Mann (Collateral).\n\nRuffalo is particularly adept at playing driven intellectuals whose emotions and needs complicate their lives, making him perfectly suited to play Bruce Banner/The Hulk in the MCU movies. He joined the franchise with the first Avengers and was able to fully rehabilitate Hulk’s and Thor’s image in Thor: Ragnarok. He recieved acclaim for starring in Todd Haynes’ Dark Waters. Now we’re now ranking the best Mark Ruffalo movies (and the worst) by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#40\n\nAll the King's Men (2006) 12%\n\n#40\n\nAdjusted Score: 18236%\n\nCritics Consensus: With a scenery-chewing performance from Sean Penn, an absence of political insight, and an overall lack of narrative cohesiveness, these Men give Oscar bait a bad name.\n\nSynopsis: Charismatic Southern politician Willie Stark's (Sean Penn) idealism and good intentions give way to corruption after he becomes governor of...
