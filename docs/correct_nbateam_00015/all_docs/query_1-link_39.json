        "text": "Ben Gordon hopes to turn Detroit Pistons into NBA champs again following his big-money move from the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe London-born star, 26, signed for the Pistons from Chicago this summer on a five-year deal worth Â£34million.\n\nAnd Gordon is set to make his competitive debut for the Pistons tomorrow in Detroit's opener away to Memphis as the NBA season officially starts today. Detroit last won the title in 2004 but Gordon is optimistic his new team can unseat the LA Lakers.\n\n\"It was tough leaving after being in Chicago for so long but at the same time I knew I was coming to a great situation in Detroit,\" said Gordon.\n\n\"The Pistons still have a few pieces from the championship team and with the addition of some new blood I think we'll be able to fit in well.\n\n\"I want to get a team chemistry going and try to help the team win as many games as possible.\n\n\"The goal here in Detroit i s always to win a championship so we're going to work hard to help get the Pistons back to being an elite team.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the guys and winning some games.\"\n\nGordon was raised in New York and played for USA in the 2003 Pan-American Games.\n\nBut he has vowed to only pull on a GB jersey in future and is penciled in to play for the hosts at London 2012.\n\nHe was due to make his Great Britain debut under coach Chris Finch in September's EuroBasket, but opted to sit out the tournament to finalise his Pistons move.\n\nBut he added: \"I haven't made a commitment to when I'll play but I'll definitely be playing with Great Britain.\n\n\"Hopefully it will be sooner than later.\n\n\"I'll base the decision on what's going on in my life at that time, when I'm mentally ready to play.\"\n\nGames can be viewed on NBA.com by signing up to NBA League Pass at www.nba.tv. Fans can also watch more than 100 games on ESPN."
