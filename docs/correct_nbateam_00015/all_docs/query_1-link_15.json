        "text": "The Detroit Pistons said they were open to any deal that makes the team better, then proved it with a major trade tonight, sending Ben Gordon and a protected first-round draft pick to the lowly Charlotte Bobcats for small forward Corey Maggette.\n\nThe Pistons shed an underperforming player who was due more than $25 million over the next two seasons in exchange for Maggette, who is due $10.9 million on an expiring contract next season.\n\nThat financial freedom helps only marginally against the salary cap this year, with Gordon slated to make $12.4 million, but could prove huge when planning a long-term deal for Greg Monroe next summer.\n\nSources told MLive Media Group that the Pistons sent Charlotte a protected first-round pick to be exercised between 2013 and 2016. The pick is lottery-protected (top 14 overall) in 2013, top-nine protected in 2014, and No. 1 protected in 2015.\n\nGordon became a lightning rod almost from the moment he signed with the Pistons as a free agent.\n\nHe was a 20-point scorer twice in five seasons with the Chicago Bulls, and a Sixth Man of the Year Award winner in 2004-05, but averaged just more than 12 points per game in three years with the Pistons.\n\nGordon, who served as the Pistons' union representative, also earned a reputation as a player for whom everything had to be just right for him to play well. He nursed a sore shoulder which kept him out for an extended stretch last season.\n\nWhen things are right, Gordon is an incredible streak scorer – he tied an NBA record he already shared with Latrell Sprewell by going 9-for-9 on 3-pointers in a game last season at Denver, most attempts ever without a miss – but those occasions came too rarely in Detroit.\n\nHe was squeezed out of a starting job last season after opening the season paired with Rodney Stuckey in the starting backcourt. That changed with Gordon's injury and the emergence of rookie Brandon Knight, who took over as starting point guard while Stuckey shifted to shooting guard.\n\nMaggette offers depth at small forward, where Tayshaun Prince has started, with Austin Daye as his backup and some help from Jonas Jerebko in a late-season experiment.\n\nMaggette, who will turn 33 at the beginning of the season, is a 13-year veteran who averaged 15 points for the lowly Bobcats, second-best on the team, though he missed about half of the abbreviated season with a strained Achilles' tendon.\n\n“We welcome Corey Maggette to our organization in a transaction that provides us with a veteran scorer and defender in addition to increased roster flexibility going forward,” Joe Dumars, the Pistons' president of basketball operations, said in a statement released by the team. “We thank Ben Gordon for his commitment to our organization over the last three years and wish him the best in the future.”\n\nMaggette joins his sixth NBA team. The Duke product also played for Orlando, the Los Angeles Clippers, Milwaukee, Golden State and Charlotte.\n\nHe had 20-point season averages three times in his career, all during his eight seasons with the Clippers. He has averaged at least 15 points in nine of the last 10 seasons.\n\nMaggette also gives the Pistons a much stronger defensive presence and another basket attacker capable of creating his own offensive opportunities. He regularly ranks among the NBA's leaders in free throws made and attempted."
