        "text": "BOSTON — Rodney Stuckey scored 25 points and Ben Gordon hit three 3-pointers in the opening 4:09 of the fourth quarter during a game-breaking spree that carried the Detroit Pistons to a 98-88 win over the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night.\n\nGreg Monroe had 22 points and nine rebounds, and Gordon finished with 22 points for the Pistons, who won for the fifth time in seven games.\n\nRajon Rondo had a season-high 35 points for Boston one game after he recorded a triple-double. Chris Wilcox, starting in place of the injured Kevin Garnett, had 17 points and nine rebounds.\n\nCeltics forward Paul Pierce scored just 10 points on 3-for-11 shooting, and Ray Allen was held to eight free throws until getting the final basket in the closing seconds to finish with 10 points. Garnett was a late scratch with a hip flexor.\n\nThe Pistons led by one entering the final quarter and scored 14 of the first 18 points, pulling to an 87-76 lead on Gordon's 3 from the left corner with 7:51 to play. He also hit a 3 from the top of the key during the spree.\n\nBoston had cut it to 93-86 when Rondo was credited with a basket on a goaltending call, but Gordon nailed a 3 with 1 minute left to seal it.\n\nDuring the game-breaking run, the Pistons held Rondo scoreless. He missed the only shot he took.\n\nRondo, who had 19 points at halftime, hit six of 10 shots in the third quarter for 12 points. He had eight of Boston's initial 10 in the quarter.\n\nThings were going so well for Rondo on his outside jumpers that he nailed a 3 in the second quarter, his first since Dec. 30. He had missed his previous nine. The Celtics had pulled to a 72-67 edge on Wilcox's fallaway jumper late in the third before the Pistons scored the final six points to take a one-point lead into the fourth.\n\nNeither team held a very big lead in a first half filled mostly with open jumpers and limited defense.\n\nBoston started the game quickly, scoring 10 of the initial 13 points for the biggest lead held by either team in the opening half. But without Garnett's influence on defense, the Pistons started getting easy shots and hit 52.6 percent (10 of 19) in the first quarter.\n\nNOTES: Boston coach Doc Rivers said Garnett \"looked great in the morning shootaround\" about an hour before the game. ... The Celtics play the final four before the All-Star break on the road, then open up in Cleveland. Their next home game is Feb. 29 against Milwaukee. ... Gordon was whistled for a technical midway into the third. ... Hall of Famer Bill Russell was in the stands and got a standing ovation when he was shown on the Jumbotron. ... The Pistons host Boston on Sunday after playing at home against Sacramento on Friday. ... It was the second of three meetings between the teams."
