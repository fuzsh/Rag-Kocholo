        "text": "DETROIT — A person with the knowledge of the negotiations says the Detroit Pistons have agreed in principle to contracts with free agents Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday night on the condition of anonymity because NBA rules prohibit teams from announcing free agent signings until next week.\n\nGordon, the third pick in the 2004 draft by the Chicago Bulls, agreed to a 5-year deal for at least $50 million. He was the Bulls’ top scorer the past four years and became an unrestricted free agent after the season. Chicago officials had said bringing him back next year was a top priority.\n\nThe 26-year-old Gordon averaged 20.7 points during the regular season before scoring 24.3 points during the playoffs when the Bulls lost to the Celtics in seven games.\n\nVillanueva, the seventh overall pick by Toronto in 2005 who has played the last three of his NBA season with the Milwaukee Bucks, also agreed to a five-year deal. His contract is worth at least $35 million."
