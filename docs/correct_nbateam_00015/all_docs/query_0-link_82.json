        "text": "Joe Dumars and the Detroit Pistons had been waiting a while for this offseason -- and it showed.\n\nThe Pistons have finally been able to give their roster a significant makeover, adding Josh Smith, Chauncey Billups and Italian star Luigi Datome. It remains to be seen how much the team will improve, but for the first time in a while, there's a bit of a buzz surrounding this struggling franchise.\n\nAfter four straight seasons without a playoff berth, Detroit entered the offseason with plenty of space under the salary cap. Dumars, the general manager, said this week he's accomplished what he wanted to via free agency.\n\n\"The only thing left now is trade possibilities, and that door will continue to be open,\" he said.\n\nDetroit's rebuilding process has been slow. First, Tom Gores became the team's new owner in 2011 following a drawn-out sale that added to the sense of gloom hanging over the team. Over the next couple of years, the Pistons parted ways with Richard Hamilton, Ben Gordon and Tayshaun Prince, giving themselves flexibility they would put to use in 2013.\n\nSmith is the key free agent addition. The 6-foot-9 forward joins a front line that already includes promising big men Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond.\n\nDetroit hired Maurice Cheeks as its new coach in June, but when the Pistons drafted guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope later that month, passing on local favorite Trey Burke of Michigan, it looked like they would again struggle to win back the support of an increasingly apathetic fan base.\n\nThe free agent moves have added some much-needed intrigue to the coming season.\n\nThe popular Billups was the MVP of the 2004 NBA Finals with the Pistons. He was traded four years later, and bringing him back as a free agent gives the team a veteran who may be able to help mentor young guard Brandon Knight.\n\nDumars remained open to the possibility of more changes, but the roster that starts the season may look similar to what's already been assembled. Dumars said the team didn't use its amnesty waiver on forward Charlie Villanueva because Detroit didn't need more cap space. Dumars also said Villanueva's skill set -- he's a 6-foot-11 forward who made 90 shots from 3-point range last season -- could still be of use to the Pistons.\n\n\"I'm really comfortable now with this roster,\" Dumars said. \"But as I was saying a little while ago, you can't shut the door now and say, 'OK, we're done.' It's the middle of July right now.\"\n\nThere is still plenty of room for improvement, but as promised, the Pistons have been busy this offseason. They couldn't afford to wait any longer.\n\n\"We're on our way to fulfilling our promise to revitalize this franchise and make the Pistons competitive again,\" Gores said. \"We're not finished yet, and we still need to prove it on the floor. But I'm pleased with the moves we've made so far.\n\n\"Joe Dumars and the basketball operations team have put a lot of pieces in place to move this team forward.\"\n\nRaptors set to buy out Camby's contract\n\nTORONTO -- The Toronto Raptors have agreed to buy out center Marcus Camby's contract and place him on waivers.\n\nCamby, acquired as part of the trade that sent Andrea Bargnani to the New York Knicks, was owed $7.5 million over the final two years of his contract.\n\nThe 39-year-old center appeared in just 24 games last season for the Knicks, averaging 1.8 points per game. Camby was picked second overall by Toronto in the 1996 draft and has played 973 games during his career.\n\nHe expressed a desire to play for a contending team.\n\nThe Raptors announced Tuesday they were using their amnesty provision on forward Linas Kleiza.\n\nAround the NBA\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks have signed free agents Carlos Delfino and Zaza Puchulia. The Bucks announced the signings Wednesday. Terms were not disclosed. ... The Los Angeles Lakers have signed free agent guard Jordan Farmar, who returns to the team that drafted him in 2006 and that he helped win back-to-back NBA titles."
