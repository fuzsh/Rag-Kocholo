        "text": "From championship contenders to historical cellar dwellers, the Detroit Pistons’ descent from grace is a cautionary tale of miscalculated moves, squandered talent, and a broken organizational culture\n\nI moved to the Detroit area in the summer of 2005. When I arrived the Detroit Pistons had just beat the Miami Heat in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, and were headed to their second consecutive NBA Finals appearance. For people in my generation, the Pistons were a gold standard of NBA success. From 1987–2008 the team only missed the playoffs 5 times. In fact, the Pistons rank 4th in Conference Finals appearances behind only the Celtics, Lakers, and Spurs. In other words, the Pistons are right there with teams that are associated with the word dynasty."
