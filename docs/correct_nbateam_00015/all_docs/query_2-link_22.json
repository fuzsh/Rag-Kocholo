        "text": "Mayor Richard Thomas owes Gordon nearly $9,000 for campaign materials the hoops star paid in 2015\n\nProsecutors are reviewing last week's confrontation in Mount Vernon between ex-NBA star Ben Gordon and a woman that resulted in Gordon being sent to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation, a spokeswoman for the Westchester District Attorney's Office said.\n\nThe Oct. 21 incident, in which the woman claimed Gordon had a knife and locked her in his Gramatan Avenue business, required police to free her from inside.\n\nThe woman had been visiting Gordon for several weeks but returned to her home in Los Angeles shortly after the incident.\n\nBEN GORDON: Hospitalized after police respond to confrontation\n\nPolice responded to Of Our Own, Gordon's recently opened sports rehabilitation and training center, on a call for assistance. They found the 31-year-old woman crying just inside the front door and she indicated that Gordon had a knife, according to a police report obtained by The Journal News/lohud.\n\nThey helped her get out and then later found Gordon in a bathroom. Although the police report detailed that a detective looked inside and saw Gordon in possession of a box cutter, none was found when they went inside.\n\nGordon was not charged but emergency medical technicians were called to take him to St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison.\n\nHow long he remained there could not be determined. Within two days he was posting on Instagram that media reports were \"lies.\"\n\nThe police report had listed the case as closed but prosecutors have since been reviewing it, including whether it was a domestic violence case that generally would have resulted in an arrest.\n\nGordon, 34, played for four NBA teams during an 11-year career. He tried to make a comeback earlier this year by playing with the Texas Legends of the NBA G-League.\n\nPreviously, Gordon was arrested in Los Angeles on June 1 on charges that he falsely pulled a fire alarm and obstructed police who responded. He missed his initial court appearance in late June. A warrant was issued for his arrest but the Los Angeles City Attorney's office has not responded to questions about what efforts were made, if any, to act on the warrant.\n\nMount Vernon police officials and the office of Mayor Richard Thomas have not responded to any questions about the incident.\n\nThomas updated his campaign finance reports this summer to reflect that he owes Gordon $8,830 for campaign mailings the hoops star paid for during the 2015 campaign."
