        "text": "Faced with a logjam at the wing positions and the opportunity to create $4.5 million more in salary cap space for the upcoming season, the Orlando Magic waived former Detroit Pistons shooting guard Ben Gordon on Monday.\n\nGordon, 32, played one season for the Magic.\n\nThe team signed him to a two-year, $9-million contract last summer. But the $4.5-million salary for the second year of his deal was fully unguaranteed if the team waived him on or before July 1. So the Magic had until Wednesday to release him if the team wanted to clear more cap space.\n\nBy waiving Gordon, the Magic likely will have $14.6 million in cap space available when teams will be permitted to begin signing free agents July 9. That figure includes a $3,741,480 salary for first-round draft pick Mario Hezonja, the cap holds for restricted free agents Tobias Harris and Kyle O'Quinn and the cap hold for unrestricted free agent Willie Green (Detroit Mercy). That figure also assumes the Magic will not waive Devyn Marble (Southfield-Lathrup) nor Dewayne Dedmon, whose salaries for 2015-16 currently are unguaranteed.\n\nWhen the Magic signed Gordon last summer, he was coming off of a string of disappointing seasons, including a 2013-14 season in which he played sparingly for Charlotte and ultimately was released. When Gordon joined the Magic, he said one of his goals was to prove he still was an effective NBA player.\n\nGordon, who won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award as a rookie in 2004-05, showed some positive flashes with the Magic, including during a Nov. 21 comeback win in Charlotte in which he scored nine points in the fourth quarter.\n\nGordon's playing time diminished as the season progressed, however. He played in a total of 56 games and averaged 14.1 minutes and 6.2 points per game. He made 36.1% of his three-point attempts."
