        "text": "Ben Gordon has been in the news as of late, but unfortunately not for the right reasons. This past weekend, police were called to Gordon’s business “Of Our Own” - a sports rehabilitation and training center - in his hometown of Mount Vernon, New York after a woman was allegedly locked inside the building and Gordon allegedly armed with a box cutter.\n\nGordon was arrested after police cut through the store’s glass to free the woman, but no weapon was ever found at the scene. Shortly after his arrest, Gordon was transported by police to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation.\n\nThe arrest marks the second incident in the past few months for Gordon. The veteran guard was arrested in Los Angeles in June for pulling fire alarms in an apartment complex.\n\nAfter word of his recent arrest began to surface, TMZ revealed that Gordon had sent threatening videos to multiple people a few days prior to his incident in Mount Vernon.\n\nGordon has played 11 NBA seasons, last appearing in the 2014-15 season with the Orlando Magic. After a stellar career at UConn, Gordon was drafted third overall by the Chicago Bulls in the 2004 NBA draft. Gordon won the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award in his rookie season, averaging 15.1 points per game and shooting better than 40 percent from the 3-point line.\n\nFollowing his stellar rookie season, Gordon would play four more seasons with the Bulls before spending time the Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats and Magic. He also spent the 2015-16 training camp with the Golden State Warriors, but was waived prior to their historic 73-win season.\n\nBefore his run-ins with the law, Gordon was in the midst of attempting an NBA comeback, averaging over 15 points per game and shooting 45.6 percent from the floor last season with the Texas Legends, the G-League affiliate of the Dallas Mavericks. Last week, the Chicago Bulls’ G-league affiliate acquired his rights as part of a draft-day trade."
