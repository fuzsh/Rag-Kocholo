        "text": "STAMFORD, Connecticut -- Former Chicago Bulls point guard Ben Gordon was arrested on weapons and threatening charges after police say he was acting erratically in a Connecticut juice shop.\n\nStamford Police say they got a call Tuesday morning about a man threatening people in a store with a knife.\n\nThe man, identified as Gordon, was reportedly acting aggressively and bizarrely.\n\nThey were eventually able to arrest him and found a folding knife clipped to his pocket, and a stun gun and brass knuckles in his backpack.\n\nGordon was arrested on charges including carrying a dangerous weapon, second-degree threatening and interfering with an officer.\n\nThe former basketball star, who played for the University of Connecticut before a decade-spanning career in the NBA, was taken to Stamford Hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nHe was released late Tuesday on $10,000 bond.\n\nThis is his third arrest in the last few months.\n\nThis latest incident happened to take place on his 40th birthday."
