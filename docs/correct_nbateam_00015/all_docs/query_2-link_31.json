        "text": "Former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Ben Gordon had his third run-in with police since June on Sunday.\n\nGordon, 34, was pulled over in Harlem on Sunday night, ticketed and charged with allegedly driving with a forged Florida license plate, according to multiple reports. He is due in court in the near future.\n\n[Follow Ball Don’t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr]\n\nThe former first-round pick has an outstanding warrant in Los Angeles after reportedly failing to show in court following a June 1 arrest for allegedly pulling fire alarms inside his apartment complex. Authorities are also still investigating an October 21 incident during which Gordon allegedly locked a woman inside a sports rehab facility during an argument in his hometown of Mount Vernon, N.Y.\n\nThere are conflicting reports about whether Gordon was armed during the incident in October. The alleged victim and a police officer on scene reported that the ex-Chicago Bulls guard was in possession of a box cutter at the time, but no evidence of the knife was discovered. Gordon was reportedly not arrested, but instead transported for psychiatric evaluation at a nearby hospital.\n\nGordon denied any wrongdoing in either previous incident a since-deleted Instagram post in October.\n\n“Yo, I need to get [activist Louis] Farrakhan on the line, man,” Gordon said in the Instagram video, suggesting he was being wrongfully accused of multiple transgressions. “This is a major issue. This is the fourth time this year within a few months that I’ve been held against my will, and I’m seeing all this fake-a** s*** on the media and TMZ. F*** TMZ and f*** all y’all fake-a** reporters lying and s***.”\n\nGordon made an estimated $84.6 million during his 11-year NBA career. He last played in the NBA for the Orlando Magic in 2014-15, averaging 6.2 points in 14.1 minutes off the bench over 56 appearances. He attempted a comeback with the Dallas Mavericks’ developmental league affiliate this past January, playing out the season for the Texas Legends. The Windy City Bulls acquired his rights in October.\n\n– – – – – – –"
