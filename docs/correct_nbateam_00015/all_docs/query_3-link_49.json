        "text": "NBA Comparison: Joe Dumars\n\nStrengths: A natural scorer with excellent strength and athletic ability…. Has a great understanding of the game and shows superb maturity and decision making….. Level headed, never seems to rush things or get out of control…. His great strength allows him to appear on balance at all times…. Has great ability with the dribble drive and excels in clutch situations….Shoots off the dribble superbly with great fakes to get shots off….. Wants the ball when it matters most. His shooting ability is a real strength….. Has an excellent mid range game and is very adept at getting his shot off on bigger defenders…. Plays bigger than his size with great leaping ability and quickness…. Plays a lot like Piston legend Joe Dumars, with great defensive ability, and shooting stroke…. Finishes well with good touch on the move, and excels in both open floor and half court situations.\n\nWeaknesses: The big knock against him is that he is unproven as a lead guard…… He has a good assist to turnover ratio and excels at the point position, but can he run a team full time? …. He is a natural scorer but may have some trouble trying to take over the point guard postion full time…. Character image took a hit with arrest over slapping a female aquantance. Probably not an indication of his character, but it dosn’t help his standing with teams."
