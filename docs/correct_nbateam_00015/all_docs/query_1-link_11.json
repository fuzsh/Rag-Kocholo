        "text": "The 2010-11 season was monumentally bad for the Detroit Pistons. They finished the campaign with a 30-52 record, but that’s not what made it so horrendous.

People from the outside looking in don’t realize how bad it was.It wasn’t conducive for playing basketball at a high level and it showed… That was probably one of the lowest basketball moments I’ve ever been a part of.'”"
