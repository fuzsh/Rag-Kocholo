        "text": "Former Detroit Pistons guard Ben Gordon is playing for the Great Britain national basketball team, which soon will attempt to qualify for Eurobasket 2017.\n\nBut espn.com’s Ian Begley writes that Gordon, who didn’t appear in an NBA game last season, is still hoping to appeal to NBA scouts. Begley caught up with the shooting guard recently, and Gordon, 33, said he still can shoot the rock.\n\n“I would definitely love to get back in the league after being out for a year,” Gordon said. “Just watching the way the game is being played, up and down. Obviously, the three-point shot is always a big deal, but it seems like, just now, more than ever, that shot is being used more and more.\n\n“So I feel like I can still play at a high level and shoot that three-ball and add that kind of depth to a team that may be looking to fulfill that need. So yeah, I definitely have hopes of making a return with an NBA team or just playing, period, wherever that may be.”\n\nGordon established himself as one of the league’s most lethal scorers in his first five seasons with the Chicago Bulls. But after signing a five-year, $55-million deal with the Pistons in 2009, his game steadily declined until he was waived by the Orlando Magic and not picked up by anyone else.\n\n“It was tough, man. I was training,” Gordon said of this past season. “But it was the first time where I was training but it wasn't for a team. I was training to stay in shape and waiting for a call from your agent to see what happens. It was very different. I went through a period when I was training and I took time off and started training again. It was a long year. I did get a chance to spend more time with my family, so that was very rewarding. But I look forward to getting back on the court this year -- hopefully, it's with an NBA team. If not, I have to see what my options are. But I definitely look forward to continuing my basketball career, to continue playing.”"
