Then sign Kobe for the max and sign BG for about $8 million. Then sign Mitoric. Maybe even look into trading for LINSANITY!!!\n\nROSE/TEAGUE\n\nKOBE/BG/SNELL\n\nBUTLER/DUNLEVY\n\nMITORIC/GIBSON\n\nNOAH/WHO CARES\n\nBoozer's OK but I'd rather have Kobe and BG. Deng's not very good and pretty overrated. BG's much better and would put us OVER THE TOP. AND KOBE'S KOBE!\n\nAnd Heinrich's got to go he's worse then BROGANS!!! Shoulda kept NATE ROB TOO!!!\n\nBottom line is WE NEED SCORERS AND GUYS WHO CAN CLOSE OUT GAMES!!! PERIOD!!!\n\nLol at the mod who deleted Mr.247's post. :lol:\n\nBut Yes, i must agree with the OP that bringing back Ben Gordon could be a real possibility in the future if PaxGar miss out on the 2014 free agent class again.\n\nAdding real consistent scoring off our bench can only be a plus.\n\nMore points cant be a bad thing, especially when having 2 guys on the floor at the same time that require double teams from opponants......Ben Gordon would add fuel to bringing down and disrupting the opposing teams defense.\n\nJust Sayin..........\n\nBesides, if and when Ben Gordon enters free agency, im sure we could get him at bargain prices.\n\nHis money value in free agency has dropped significantly since he joined Detroit years ago.\n\nThe Bulls brass could probably get Ben Gordon cheap...........\n\nSo why not bring him back for bench depth...?\n\nWhy not add a guy who can score off the bench?\n\nIts not like the Bulls have any realistic,dependable scoring options off the current bench.......\n\nThats B.Gs specialty.\n\nBen could play the kind of roll Nate Robinson did for us last year coming off the bench.\n\nWhen the Bulls went on major scoring droughts during games, Nate would come on the floor and score lights out instantly.\n\nBen can do the same thing...........\n\nINSTANT OFFENSE is not a bad thing to have on a team............especially for a team like the roster on our current Bulls that happens to suffer from scoring droughts throughout games........\n\nThis has been an issue with the Bulls since Ben Gordon left.................................\n\nIt's been explained hundreds of times why its bad and why it won't happen and why it won't help the Bulls.\n\nthe guy that made the thread joined yesterday...i dont know what happened to his post but somehow scottie looks like the OP i was confused as hell when i see Mr 247 was thread maker and scottie was first post\n\nand thats just debates...allot of of them just keep going and going...ive explained my side of why we should bring him back just as much as you explained why not...its all in the game, yo\n\nthe guy that made the thread joined yesterday...i dont know what happened to his post but somehow scottie looks like the OP i was confused as hell when i see Mr 247 was thread maker and scottie was first post\n\nand thats just debates...allot of of them just keep going and going...ive explained my side of why we should bring him back just as much as you explained why not\n\nfunny how posts get deleted to hide the truth just to serve a fews selfish interests based on hatred.\n\nHataz gonna hate.......and there is no cure for basketball retardation......fuck em....\n\nYou are the most perfect example of why there is no cure for basketball retardation.\n\nPlease explain the context of your post.\n\nEnlighten me and explain how im basketball Special person.\n\nIn reality, we all know that PaxGar will mostlikely miss out or fumble signing any of the top 5 free agents this upcoming summer.\n\nCant make trades either, therefore that leave a possibilty to sign someone like Ben Gordon who may be leftover, and for a cheap price that Jerry Reinsdorff loves....\n\nBens $value has been down graded in the market the last bunch of years, but in the right situation, he can still flat out score on any given night. Instant offense from the bench is a good weapon to have when utilized properly.\n\nInstant offense at a good bargain? Special person? really?\n\nWhats Special person about that?\n\nCome on, tell me Mr. Funny Jokey Joke Maker.\n\nIn no way shape or form am i promoting Ben Gordon as the top target.\n\nAll im saying, is if PaxGar strike out again, then purhaps if Ben becomes available, then that may be an option down the line.\n\nBack up plan C ...............\n\nPlease explain the context of your post.\n\nEnlighten me and explain how im basketball Special person.\n\nIn reality, we all know that PaxGar will mostlikely miss out or fumble signing any of the top 5 free agents this upcoming summer.\n\nCant make trades either, therefore that leave a possibilty to sign someone like Ben Gordon who may be leftover, and for a cheap price that Jerry Reinsdorff loves....\n\nBens $value has been down graded in the market the last bunch of years, but in the right situation, he can still flat out score on any given night.

That right there should show you why Ben Gordon is NOT coming to the Bulls. So why do people continue, year after year to bring this up? You would think Ben Gordon is some kind of Bulls all time great the way people never shut the fuck up about him.\n\nHe hasn't played for the Bulls in years, the Bulls offered him a contract but he wanted more money (that's his prerogative, whatever) and wasted away his career in Detroit and now is wasting it away on the Bobcats. He wanted his money and got it. Everyone is happy. Why can't people just let it go?\n\nand of course hes gonna want more than min...lets not insult him twice\n\nhes not gonna be asking for 55m either tho\n\nhes a viable option to get Rose some help scoring....you see how the floor opens up when Rose is out there...with Ben out there it could cause some serious issues for the other team...and when Rose taking a breather he could be out there keeping the scoring going...sure hes not a superstar but i think he could do wonders for us\n\ni still stand by if we had him in 2011 that heat series was going to 7\n\nbut sure we can keep standing pat and waiting for this mythical perfect 2nd option"
