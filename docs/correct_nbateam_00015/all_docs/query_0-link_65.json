        "text": "The last 20 years have been a tale of two completely different decades for the Pistons.\n\nThere was the 2000s, when the Larry O’Brien Trophy made its way back to Auburn Hills, Mich., for the first time in almost 15 years. There was Eastern Conference dominance. There were sellout crowds nightly. The 2010s, though, tell a more traumatic story. There were no playoffs wins. There was mediocrity in its purest form. The fan support dwindled.\n\nGreat players have come. Great players have gone. Some players spanning over the last 20 years will forever be remembered. Others, well, will act as Monday night trivia questions at your local pub.\n\nHere, we’re going to try and piece together the top 25 players of the past 20 years for Detroit. The criteria is pretty straightforward: To be eligible for consideration, a player must’ve played at least 100 games with the franchise from the 1999-2000 season to now. That’s really the only catch. As far as how I ranked the players, natural ability of course holds weight, but so does importance to the franchise and ability to properly fill or exceed a role. For example: Josh Smith was a better basketball player than Corliss Williamson, but (spoiler alert) Williamson exceeded in his role and played a big part in a success story. It’s all subjective.\n\nToday, we discuss players ranked 15-25. Players ranked 1-14 will publish later this week.\n\nTell me in the comments where you disagree.\n\n25. Jason Maxiell (2005-13): Your out-of-state casual basketball fans probably have no clue who Maxiell is. However, if you’ve been a Pistons fan for more than a decade, you’re very familiar with the 6-foot-7 power forward. There was nothing extraordinary about Maxiell’s game — not the numbers or the way in which he played — but he spent eight seasons in Detroit being a reliable bench player for some solid teams and some terrible ones.\n\n24. Charlie Villanueva (2009-14): I’m sorry if reading this name brings back bad memories, but Villanueva is worthy of a top-25 spot on a list with criteria this narrow. No, he never lived up to his $36 million contract, after many expected him and Ben Gordon to lead the new wave of Pistons basketball following the breakup of the 2004 title team. He did, however, average double-figure scoring his first two seasons. At this stage in the rankings, you’re going to get names like this one.\n\n23. Will Bynum (2008-14): There was little thrill coming out Auburn Hills during Bynum’s tenure, but “Will the Thrill” was often an exciting watch for die-hard fans who toughed it out. He averaged double-figure scoring in just one season, and he wasn’t an orchestrator of offense — though he did record a 20-assist game once — but at 6 feet, the springy point guard had some exciting plays. He had some memorable individual performances, like his 32 points against Charlotte in 2009, but his longevity as a backup guard earned him a spot here.\n\n22. Ben Gordon (2009-12): Much like Villanueva, Gordon never lived up to his Pistons contract, but he wasn’t as bad as people may think. Gordon averaged double-figure scoring each year he was with the Pistons and was a knockdown 3-point shooter in two of those three seasons. Many believe the Gordon-Villanueva tenure is what set Detroit back, and there’s a case to be made for that, but Gordon still had some game then. He was just under-qualified for the money he was receiving and the expectations set on him.\n\n21. Josh Smith (2013-14): This one was a little difficult because Smith was probably a better basketball player than the next two players listed, but he wasn’t someone you’d want on your team, especially given the role and expectations set on him. I mean, he signed a four-year deal in 2013 with the Pistons, then barely played 100 games before being stretched and waived. That says all you need to know. Smith did average 16.4 points and 6.8 rebounds in his first and only full season in Detroit, but he wasn’t efficient at all. Smith should probably be lower on this list, but I want to give someone a reason to call me an idiot in the comments.\n\n20. Mehmet Okur (2002-04): Okur’s best years came after he left Detroit and was featured more in Utah, but he was an important bench player to the team that made the Eastern Conference finals in 2003 and won the NBA title in 2004. The year the Pistons won the championship, Okur averaged close to 10 points and six rebounds per game. He wasn’t around for as long as you might think, but he played a pivotal part in one of the franchise’s most memorable runs.\n\n19. Chucky Atkins (2000-04): Atkins missed out on the glory, but he was a reliable backup guard in the buildup to the Pistons’ title. He had two seasons when he averaged 12-plus points and was one of the better 3-point shooters on the roster. Atkins was part of the trade that landed Rasheed Wallace in 2004.\n\n18. Antonio McDyess (2004-09): No one in the back half of the top-25 players was as consistent as McDyess. You knew what you were going to get from him each and every night as a scorer, rebounder and defender. His stats, while never monstrous, were almost identical each season he was with the Pistons, and he was an important piece to a team that made it to the NBA Finals. Should he be ranked higher? A strong case could be made.\n\n17. Brandon Jennings (2013-16): One of the biggest “what ifs” in recent Pistons history is centered around Jennings. He was turning the corner as their lead guard when he suffered a season-ending Achilles injury that changed the trajectory of his career. Detroit probably doesn’t trade for Reggie Jackson if Jennings never gets injured to that degree. His best season was his first with the Pistons, when he averaged 15.5 points and 7.6 assists. The following year, before the injury, he was on pace for similar numbers, but his growth as a lead guard was starting to show more and more with each game — and, not coincidentally, after Smith was waived in December.\n\n16. Marcus Morris (2015-17): Another dependable player, Morris started every game he was available (159) in his two seasons in Detroit, averaging 14 points per game and roughly five rebounds in both seasons. He was the starting small forward on the 2016 team that snapped the Pistons’ six-year playoff drought.\n\n15. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (2013-17): Had Morris played one more season with similar stats in Detroit, I’d probably have him here. Instead, KCP’s four seasons with the Pistons, showing improvements each year and as the team’s best on-ball defender, give him the nod. Caldwell-Pope averaged double-figure scoring every year except his rookie season and was the starting two-guard those seasons. His shooting wavered, and he never really developed a pure dribble-penetration game, but his defense was as reliable as anyone’s on the roster at that time. He was a starter on a team that made the playoffs, so that’s a good bullet to have, especially during this 20-year period. Both sides were probably better off with his departure in the summer of 2017: Detroit didn’t get locked into a lengthy deal for a role player, and KCP is now with the Lakers in the Orlando bubble contending for an NBA title.\n\n(Top photo of Charlie Villanueva: Allen Einstein / NBAE via Getty Images)"
