        "text": "Naturally with a losing season comes the blame game. People want to point a finger and say, ‘Hey, they are the reason this happened.’ It’s natural in sports at any level. A popular train of thought among Pistons fans is general manager Joe Dumars doomed the franchise when he signed Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva to long-term deals in the offseason. The reality is Gordon and Villanueva have been disappointments. No one will dispute that fact, including Gordon and Villanueva. But it’s a little early to be calling them both busts. Both came to Detroit with a track record and everyone’s favorite word: potential. Gordon just turned 27 and Villanueva is 25. Both are entering the prime of their careers and have already shown what they can do in the NBA. The question is where did it go wrong for both of them this season and what is the cause? If one was struggling, it wouldn’t be as shocking as both of them struggling. The truth is both appeared to be right on track to start the season. Gordon averaged 19.4 points in his the first 17 games of the season, he missed two games with an ankle injury, returning for three games before shutting it down for nine games. He averaged 13.2 points in seven games before suffering a groin injury and missing eight games. Upon his return is when Gordon’s real struggles began. Gordon averaged just 9.5 points over his next 30 games, playing an average of 23 minutes a game. Even more alarming, the normally deadly outside shooter shot just 28.5 percent (26-for-91) on his 3-pointers during that 30-game span. Gordon had shot better than 40 percent from 3-point range in each of the his first five NBA seasons. Gordon has seemed to round back into form as of late. Entering Saturday night, Gordon was averaging 19.0 points in his last five and that includes a scoreless game at Atlanta. He has shot 46.2 percent on his 3-pointers during that span. I’m not a genius, but it appears to me Gordon’s struggles were the result of not being healthy. Add in the fact that he’s on a new team with no identity and constant injuries and it shouldn’t come as a surprise his numbers are career lows across the board. The Gordon that scored 39 points and hit seven 3-pointers to help beat the Heat on Friday is who the Pistons were hoping to get when they signed him. Plenty of games like that next season, and Gordon will earn his big contract, which in reality, is not that big if you consider what Gordon could provide. Gordon averaged 20.7 points per game last season. If he did that this season, he would have earned every penny of the $10 million he was paid. If you don’t believe me consider this, 18 players are averaging 20 points or more this season entering Saturday night. Of those 18 players, just eight make less than Gordon. Of those eight, four are still on their rookie contract, making it impossible for them to make more than Gordon. The remaining four are Indiana’s Danny Granger (who will make more than Gordon next season as his contract escalates), New York’s David Lee (who is in line for a big pay increase next season), Charlotte’s Stephen Jackson and Golden State’s Corey Maggette. If Gordon can get back to his high-scoring self then suddenly his contract will no longer be an issue. That brings us to Villanueva. Two of the knocks on Villanueva are his activity on Twitter and his contract. Villanueva has his share of faults, but his Twitter page and contract are nowhere near the top of the list. Villanueva caught some heat for blowing off some steam on Twitter last week. In reality it wasn’t that big of a deal. He didn’t say anything too controversial, just vague. If you want to see controversial, then follow Orlando’s Matt Barnes, who is quite entertaining. One thing that made me laugh was people saying if Villanueva spent as much time working on his game as he does on Twitter he would be better off. The reality is how long does it really take to post a couple updates from your cell phone? I’m going to go out on a limb and say Villanueva spends more time playing basketball than he does on Twitter. But I could be wrong, he does have a Facebook account, too. In reality, Detroit fans should be thankful there is a guy that lets them know what he is thinking without the filtering of media types like myself. He tells people what he is thinking and hasn’t shied away from the media even though he has been struggling. Some guys only like the spotlight when things are going well. Villanueva has stayed the same throughout the season. Villanueva detractors also love to bring up his contract. Well I want to set the record straight a little on that one. Now while Villanueva certainly makes a decent wage, the Pistons didn’t break the bank to sign him. Villanueva is the fourth-highest paid Piston and there is quite a gap between him and the top three (Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Gordon). A gap of more than $3 million. The Pistons’ fifth-highest paid player is Jason Maxiell, who makes $1.5 million less than Villanueva this season. What do teams expect to get out of their fourth-highest paid player? Likely more than Villanueva has contributed, but like Gordon, Villanueva’s struggles could also be attributed to playing hurt. Back in mid-December it appeared the Pistons got what they paid for. Through the first 25 games of the season, Villanueva was averaging 16.0 points and 5.6 rebounds in 28.6 minutes per game. Since that time, Villanueva’s numbers have plummeted to 10.4 points and 4.3 rebounds in 21.2 minutes in 44 games, entering Saturday night. Now ask yourself, what has changed that dramatically in such a short period of time. I’m not here to make excuses for Villanueva, but in the 24th game of the season, he suffered a heel injury that was later revealed to be plantar fasciitis. A very painful injury that takes a long time to heal and can’t be healed by resting it. Despite the injury, Villanueva still had a semi-productive January (14.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 28.3 minutes per game). But he missed the Jan. 31 game with back spasms, played eight minutes on Feb. 2 before missing another game on Feb. 5. That’s where Villanueva’s numbers began to take a real nosedive. Villanueva averaged just 6.2 points and 3.8 rebounds in 16.8 minutes per game in the month of February. March wasn’t much better, 9.4 points, 3.1 rebounds in 18.3 minutes. It seems very likely Villanueva has not been healthy and his play has suffered, which has resulted in Kuester not playing him as much. It’s doubtful Villanueva has been a Kuester favorite from the beginning and a Villanueva playing through injuries isn’t going to win the coaches’ favor. Villanueva has to get more consistent on offense, throughout his career he’s been a guy that can score 25 one game then five the next. His defensive struggles are well documented, but he has shown he wants to improve. Gordon and Villanueva might never live up to their expectations, but that can’t be decided in one season. Both signed a five-year deal and like it or not, they likely will be around for a while. Give the guys a little longer before labeling them busts. If they are still struggling next season, there will be plenty of room on the bust bandwagon. Dave Pemberton covers the Pistons and the NBA for The Oakland Press.
