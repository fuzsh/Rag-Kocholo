        "text": "London-born Ben Gordon continued his impressive run of form with a 22 point, four rebound and four assist game but was unable to prevent his Detroit Pistons from crashing to a fifth consecutive defeat.\n\nThe 27-year-old has averaged 20.2 points per game in his team’s opening five games of the season and scored on 59 per cent of his shot attempts but that has not been enough to stop his team slipping to the bottom of the NBA standings - only Houston (0-4) are also winless.\n\nDetroit lost 94-85 away to the unbeaten Atlanta Hawks last night with Josh Smith (22 points and 11 rebounds) leading the way for the home team.\n\nThe Pistons are next in action on Friday when they host fellow strugglers the Charlotte Bobcats (1-3).\n\nWhile Gordon’s Pistons are struggling for a win, fellow Brit Pops Mensah-Bonsu’s New Orleans Hornets have started the season with four victories.\n\nThe 6ft 9in power forward was surplus to requirements in last night’s 107-99 away win against the Rockets. All Star point guard Chris Paul led the way for the Hornets with 25 points, eight assists and seven rebounds.\n\nMensah-Bonsu, who played 10 minutes in the team’s previous win will be hoping to get more playing time when the Hornets host NBA powerhouse the Miami Heat on Friday."
