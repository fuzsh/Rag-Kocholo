        "text": "Former NBA player and Mount Vernon native Ben Gordon is in trouble again.\n\nThe ex-Bulls star was arrested on allegations that he beat up two security guards at a McDonald’s in Chicago on Friday, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nGordon was arrested around 3:30 a.m. Friday when police responded to a report of a disturbance by a man who was being escorted out of the McDonald’s. Gordon allegedly threw both men to the ground, pushing one and hitting another in the face.\n\nThe 39-year-old former shooting guard has been charged with misdemeanor battery causing bodily harm and battery making physical contact.\n\nThe latest incident comes less than a month after Gordon was arrested at LaGuardia Airport after witnesses said he punched his 10-year-old son in the face as they got ready to board a flight to Chicago. Two Port Authority of New York cops and New Jersey police officers were injured during that arrest.\n\nGordon’s latest arrest adds to an already troubled history with the law and a publicly documented battle with depression.\n\nGordon grew up in Mount Vernon and won an NCAA title with UConn prior to his NBA career. He played 11 seasons in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic."
