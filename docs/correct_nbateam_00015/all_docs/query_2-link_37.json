        "text": "Four months after allegedly setting off fire alarms in his Los Angeles apartment complex, former NBA Sixth Man of the Year Ben Gordon was reportedly transported by police to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation following a more disturbing incident in his hometown of Mount Vernon, New York, on Saturday.\n\nMount Vernon police responded to a call from the sports rehabilitation, training and holistic wellness business Gordon opened in the New York City suburb last month, allegedly discovering a distraught woman inside the entrance and Gordon armed with a knife in the bathroom, per The Journal News.\n\nPolice cut through the storefront’s locked entrance to free the woman, and they found Gordon in the bathroom at her direction, according to the police report obtained by The Journal News. The woman told police Gordon was in possession of a knife, and a detective attested to seeing the former UConn star holding a box cutter, but a weapon was never located once he was handcuffed, the report said.\n\nAccording to the woman’s account of the incident, the two were arguing inside the business when Gordon “began to destroy and throw everything,” demanding she leave, only to lock the door once she packed her bags. The woman is from L.A. and can be seen in several social media posts with Gordon.\n\nPolice reportedly brought Gordon to a nearby hospital for psychiatric evaluation. He was not arrested. However, there is a warrant out for Gordon’s arrest in L.A. after he failed to appear in court to face misdemeanor charges stemming from the alleged fire alarm incident, according to The Journal News.\n\nGordon took issue with the report in a series of posts on his Instagram account on Wednesday.\n\n“Yo, I need to get [activist Louis] Farrakhan on the line, man,” Gordon said in an Instagram video, suggesting he was being wrongfully accused of multiple transgressions. “This is a major issue. This is the fourth time this year within a few months that I’ve been held against my will, and I’m seeing all this fake-a** s*** on the media and TMZ. F*** TMZ and f*** all y’all fake-a** reporters lying and s***.”\n\nGordon did not clarify what exactly about the reports he considered false. TMZ Sports reported on Wednesday that Gordon sent threatening videos last week to people he believed were wrongfully taking credit for starting the business where the alleged incident occurred over the weekend. TMZ Sports published video of Gordon making profane threats along with its report. “Pull up right now,” he said, “and come talk that talk now. … Stop telling [expletives] this is your establishment, [expletive].”\n\nGordon, 34, last played in the NBA for the Orlando Magic in 2014-15, averaging 6.2 points in 14.1 minutes off the bench over 56 appearances. After leading the Huskies to an NCAA title in 2004, he was drafted third overall by the Chicago Bulls and emerged as a bona fide NBA scorer, producing 18.5 points per game and shooting 41.5 percent from 3-point range through five seasons in Chicago.\n\nGordon’s game began to regress after he signed a five-year, $50 million free-agent deal with the Pistons in 2009. He played three seasons in Detroit before being traded to the Hornets and playing out the final two years of his deal in Charlotte. He signed for the veteran minimum in Orlando in 2015.\n\nGordon was invited to Warriors training camp in the fall of 2015 and appeared briefly in a pair of preseason games before Golden State waived him prior to the start of the team’s 73-win campaign. This past January, Gordon attempted an NBA comeback, joining the Dallas Mavericks’ developmental league affiliate. The 6-foot-3 guard finished out the season with the Texas Legends, averaging 15.2 points and shooting 45.6 percent from distance, while adding 3.4 assists and 2.7 rebounds in 25 games.\n\n“I still watch the NBA closely. And the more I watch it, the more I’m convinced that there’s a spot for me,” he told the Chicago Tribune in February of his hope to find a home for his jumper in the 3-point-happy NBA. “Hopefully with a contender because I still would love to win an NBA championship.”\n\nThe Windy City Bulls, Chicago’s G-League affiliate, acquired Gordon’s rights last week.\n\n– – – – – – –\n\nBen Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Don’t Lie on Yahoo Sports.
