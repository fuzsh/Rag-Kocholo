        "text": "Basketball fans may know more about Ben Gordon because of his recent off-court troubles, but an incredible achievement from his career is worth remembering. After all, the British baller was the youngest player ever to win the Sixth Man of the Year awardâ€”a feat that he accomplished while he was a rookie for the Chicago Bulls in 2005.\n\nFresh off an NCAA title\n\nGordon was fresh off winning the NCAA championship for the UConn Huskies when he was picked third overall by the Bulls in the 2004 NBA Draft. He made an immediate impact as his explosive scoring abilities helped spark the Bulls to turn things around. After a horrible 3-14 start, the Bulls ended up with a 47-35 record, which was good enough to secure the fourth seed position in the Eastern Conference.\n\nGordon was a huge part of that, as he averaged 15.1 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game in just 24 minutes of playing time. He was lights out from beyond the arc, making over 40% of his three-pointers, and was almost automatic from the charity stripe as well, shooting 86%.\n\nClutch performer\n\nEarly on, Gordon also earned a reputation as a late-game assassin, capable of taking over games in the fourth quarter, where he thrived. In his rookie season, he scored in double-figures in the fourth a whopping 21 times, which was second only to LeBron James."
