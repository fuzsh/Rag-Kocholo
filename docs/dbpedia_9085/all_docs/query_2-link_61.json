        "text": "«My name is Serhiy, but everyone calls me Makar. This is our family tradition because everyone I know also called my father Makar. And so it took root. In general, I have been in design for ten years, at first I did what everyone else did: logos/posters/visuals for social networks. Over time, I realized that my works have nothing unique — photos from the stock, illustrations from the same, and fonts at best from the Google library. In a word, boring. I began to think that I could customize and decide - it will be letters because the design without a photo/illustration exists, but without letters, it is already more difficult.\n\nI watched the lectures of the Projector Library and when I saw the lecture of Kyrylo Tkachov, I realized that is my passion! And rushed to the font intensive to him».\n\nAnd yes, it all started on January 3, 2019, at Kyril's intensive. It was precisely the time when Ukrainian cities received identities one by one, including official fonts: Dnipro, Mariupol, later Vinnytsia and Kyiv. As a resident of Poltava, of course I wanted to too. And here's the question, okay, I'm making a Poltava font, but what kind of Poltava is it, what should it be about? With this question, I went to the field (including the Battle of Poltava) and the concept of my understanding of Poltava was formed - on the one hand, it is a historical city, a Cossack fortress, but on the other - a monument from which the Russian Empire began, a city that has preserved its historicity , but mixed this historicity with imperial narratives and other scoop. The main idea emerged from these opposites - we make a modern geometric grotesque, but add historicity to it and see what will come of it.\n\nThe name is simpler - \"Almaz\", it is now a defunct cinema near the diamond factory in Poltava. There I spent my childhood playing consoles, there the older boys took money from me. It was demolished, childhood ended, but at least a part of the name remained. By the way, the sign of this plant became one of the references when Kirill and I were looking for a typeface.\n\nIf we talk about hidden symbolism, Easter eggs or allusions, then my answer: Two buckets! For example, № has the \"Narbutian\" N, the form @ I looked in Berdyansk on the wall written by the hand of some baryga (drugs are the fiercest evil), or an unusual sign of the hryvnia with a reference to the pre-Petrov thousands sign (҂), which I was inspired by Andriy Shevchenko. In a word, Kirill and I experimented as much as we could, rejecting the most radical variations, but a lot remained - for example, a super unusual Cyrillic script inspired by pre-Peter forms. It is so unusual that with the beginning of a full-scale war, it was necessary to bury the letter - earth - in a stylistic set and draw an ordinary form. Or how about experimenting with different shapes for uppercase and lowercase letters? In a word, I won't spoil everything, because the font turned out to be one huge Easter egg by itself - look for it, black-brows)\n\nAt first, I used his font on my own and it turned out to be something super decorative. Then I went to Berdyansk for a font intensive with Andriy Shevchenko and the font softened a little, but it was still curly. After returning, Kirill offered to do it based on the fact that I already had a normal commercial headset - well, I'm not a fool to refuse such an offer)\n\nDuring work, we both learned, I - to make fonts in general, and Kyrylo - to make fonts in the new software, because halfway through we replaced FL5 with FL7, it's like changing from a tricycle to a car without stopping moving. In general, the whole journey took about seven or eight months, maybe a year)"
