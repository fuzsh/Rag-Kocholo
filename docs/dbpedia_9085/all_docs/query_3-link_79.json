        "text": "History\n\nIn the second half of the ninth century, Oleg, a Novgorod prince, took Kiev and made it the capital of his empire. The first Christian monarch of Kiev was Princess Olga ( 969), regent from 945-960. She traveled to Constantinople and was received by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenetos (945-959). She was also baptized there, with Constantine allegedly acting as godfather. This journey is considered the beginning of the Empire of Kiev. Later in her reign she also sent envoys to Otto I requesting a bishop and priests. In the 11th and 12th centuries there were contacts with Constantinople as well as with the west, such as with France, Norway and Hungary.\n\nHer son, Sviatoslav I still professed the pagan animist faith, but her grandson Volodymir (980-1015) established Byzantine Orthodox Christianity in Kiev. Kiev became a Byzantine ecclesiastical province headed by a metropolitan clergyman with a rank between patriarch and archbishop. This metropolitan was appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1232 a Roman Catholic diocese was established in Kiev. In 1299 the Metropolis was moved to Vladimir and in 1328, under Ivan I Kalita (1325-1340) to Moscow.\n\nAlthough ties with Constantinople remained close, the grand dukes of Kiev did not become vassals of the Byzantine emperors, but remained sovereign.\n\nAdministratively, the Empire of Kyiv was a confederation of several independent principalities strongly linked by language, culture and religion, as well as by economic, political and dynastic ties. In the mid-11th century, there were eight principalities: Kiev, Chernigov, Pereiaslav (Poltava), Halych-Volyn (Galicia), Polatsk (Polotzk), Smolensk, Rostov-Suzdal (later Vladimir-Suzdal) and Novgorod. Each had its own prince, usually related to the Grand Duke of Kiev and subordinate to him. Furthermore, members of the family often ruled various principalities during their careers. Yaroslav I (1019-1054) determined that the eldest son of the Grand Duke of Kiev would succeed not only in Kiev but also in Novgorod, so that the two principalities were closely linked.\n\nAfter the reign of Mstyslav I (1125-1132), Halicz and Vladimir also developed as political, cultural and trade centers. In 1169, Prince Andreas Bogoliubski tried unsuccessfully to move the center of the Russian empire from Kiev to Vladimir. However, the hegemony of Kiev was then over and the last Grand Duke of Kiev, Gleb, reigned from 1169 to 1171. In the east of the area, the Principality of Vladimir seceded from Kiev in 1176. This principality (grand duchy from 1195) continued to exist until 1389. However, the city remained the capital of Russia until it was taken by the Mongols under Batu Khan in December 1240. Novgorod, Halicz and Vladimir-Suzdal subsequently emerged as independent principalities, but although Halicz and Vladimir tried to take Kiev's place, they failed. Apart from Polotsk, the Russian principalities became indebted to the Golden Horde after the capture of Kiev.\n\nLike the other Russian principalities, Daniel of Galicia also had to recognize the suzerainty of the Tatar Empire of the Golden Horde, established in 1241, although no Tatar observers stayed in his country. In 1245 he was summoned to Sarai on the lower Volga, where he was confirmed prince of the Galician-Volhynian Empire and king of the Russians. In 1253 he was crowned King of the Russian (Regis Rusie) by a nuncio of Pope Innocent IV (1243-54) in the town of Dorohychyn. [1]\n\nNotwithstanding his recognition by Batu Khan, Daniel pursued a policy directed against the Tatars. In this context, he fortified the cities following a Western example. At the same time he founded the new cities of Lvov and Chelm. During the construction of a keep near the last town, a large stone was built in the facade on which a crowned two headed eagle was carved. For example, the Russian Ipatievsky Chronicle writes: A mile from the city is a brick keep on which stands an eagle carved in stone; and the height of the stone is 10 cubits with the heads, and with the supports 12 cubits. \" (1 cubit = here approx. 62 cm). From the plural 'heads' it could be deduced that this is a two headed eagle The chronicle also mentions that a Byzantine master builder by the name of Audios built the cathedral in Chelm, so it is quite possible that he also built the keep and is responsible for the two headed eagle. [2]) We find this two headed eagle later in the coat of arms of the Polish city of Przemysl. [3]) Usually this two headed eagle is depicted in gold on a blue field.\n\nAfter the Rurik family became extinct in Galicia in 1340, the title of King of Russia also disappeared there. The last Khan of the Golden Horde, Uzbek, died in 1341.\n\nIn 1349 Galicia was annexed by Poland and in 1370 Kiev was taken by the Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania, leaving the entire Mongolian part of Russia in the hands of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.\n\nIn the interim between the extinction of the Rurikids in Galicia and the conquest of Kiev by Algirdas, the two-headed eagle appears once more, by the Grand Duke of Moscow and Vladimir, Ivan II the Gentle (1353 -59). On an icon, this monarch wears a green cloak studded with golden two headed eagles. The caption and the crown he wears are both in Byzantine tradition.\n\nFrom 1386 onwards, the Polish Kings and Grand Dukes of Lithuania from the House of Jagiello, to whom Galicia had fallen, called themselves Hæres Russiæ (heirs of Russia).\n\nWhile the western part of Russia was conquered by Lithuania in the 14th century, Moscow developed in the East. After conquering the surrounding principalities, Moscow was able to withdraw its indebtedness to the remnants of the Golden Horde in 1480. Not long afterwards, Ivan III, the Great, adopted the style of Monarch over all of Russia. In 1491 he had his entire title carved in stone in Latin and Russian on the Frolov Gate of the Spassky Tower in Moscow. It read: In the Julian year 6999 this tower was built by the grace of God by order of Ivan, son of Wassily, regent and sole ruler of All Russia and Grand Duke of Vladimir and Moscow and Novgorod and Pskow and Tver and Jugria and Vyatka and Perm. and Bulgaria etc. in the 30th year of his reign by Peter Antonie from the city of Milan. \n\nThis title also appears on his seals. His son Wassily also called himself a tsar. Under Ivan the Terrible the fully developed title occurs: By the Grace of God Tsar and Grand Prince Iwan Wassiljevič Lord of All Russia, Vladimir, Moscow, Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Lord of Pskow and Grand Duke of Smolensk, Tver, Ugorsk , Perm, Viatka, Bulgaria & c. . The structure of the title corresponds to the Byzantine title and xpiσtω tω θeω πiσtoσ baσieyσ kai aytokptωp pωmaiωn in which the title 'Basileus' is thus placed before the title' Autokrator 'as in the Russian case the title' царь і велікіь '' the title 'господарь'. The titles 'Tsar' and 'Gospodar' can thus be properly regarded as the Russian translation of the Greek titles 'Basileus' and 'Autokrator'. The title of the Russian tsars thus followed the Byzantine and not the Roman tradition.\n\nFrom 1386 onwards, the Polish Kings and Grand Dukes of Lithuania from the House of Jagiello, to whom Galicia had fallen, called themselves Hæres Russiæ (heirs of Russia).\n\nWhile the western part of Russia was conquered by Lithuania in the 14th century, Moscow developed in the East. After conquering the surrounding principalities, Moscow was able to withdraw its indebtedness to the remnants of the Golden Horde in 1480. Not long afterwards, Ivan III, the Great, adopted the style of Monarch over all of Russia. In 1491 he had his entire title carved in stone in Latin and Russian on the Frolov Gate of the Spassky Tower in Moscow. It read: In the Julian year 6999 this tower was built by the grace of God by order of Ivan, son of Wassily, regent and sole ruler of All Russia and Grand Duke of Vladimir and Moscow and Novgorod and Pskow and Tver and Jugria and Vyatka and Perm. and Bulgaria etc. in the 30th year of his reign by Peter Antonie from the city of Milan.  [4]\n\nThis title also appears on his stamps. His son Wassily also called himself a tsar. Under Ivan the Terrible the fully developed title occurs: By the Grace of God Tsar and Grand Prince Iwan Wassiljevič Lord of All Russia, Vladimir, Moscow, Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan, Lord of Pskow and Grand Duke of Smolensk, Tver, Ugorsk, Perm, Viatka, Bulgaria &c. The structure of the title corresponds to the Byzantine title and xpiσtω tω θeω πiσtoσ baσieyσ kai aytokptωp pωmaiωn in which the title 'Basileus' is thus placed before the title 'Autokrator 'as in the Russian case the title царь і велікіь the title 'господарь'. The titles 'Tsar' and 'Gospodar' can thus be properly regarded as the Russian translation of the Greek titles 'Basileus' and 'Autokrator'. The title of the Russian tsars thus followed the Byzantine and not the Roman tradition. [5]\n\nAfter the Pragmatic Sanction of Charles VI in 1721, Peter I, the Great usurped the (Roman) Imperial title, which was worn by the Grand Dukes of Moscow until the fall of the Romanovs in 1917. In the west, the emperorship was more or less restored by Josef II and his successors until the Empire was liquidated in 1806. Russia did not prosper in this respect either, because after Peter I, it was first ruled by his wife and later by three more empresses. Only after the French era did the Grand Dukes of Moscow become Emperor of Russia, instead of Emperor, like Napoleon became Emperor of France, Francis I of Austria and William I became Emperor of Germany.\n\nThe Principality of Kiev will be covered in the chapter on Ukraine because Kiev is now the capital of that country. Vladimir is treated in this book as well as some other kingdoms and khanates that came after the disintegration of resp. the Empire of Kiev and the Golden Horde arose (in this case Novgorod, Astrakhan and Kazan, as well as Siberia, the remnant of the White Horde). The choice of these areas is determined by the importance that the Grand Dukes themselves attached to these areas, which should be evident from the fact that these areas appear in the title and are represented early on with a coat of arms in the royal and imperial coat of arms.\n\nThis chapter is considered the place where the Golden Horde can be dealt with because it still covered most of Russia, albeit that the power base was not in Kiev or Moscow but on the lower Volga. On the other hand, the core possessions of the Grand Dukes of Moscow in the 16th century included both the old Russian principalities and the main parts of the Golden Horde. In this sense, the Grand Dukes of Moscow can be regarded as the successors of the Mongol Khans of the Golden Horde.\n\nThe rule of Grand prince Ivan III (1462-1505) was an important period in the process of forming the Russian centralized State. Ivan III managed to put an end to the dependence from the Golden Horde by repelling in 1480 the raid of Khan Akhmad against Moscow. The Grand principality of Moscow had incorporated Yaroslavl, Novgorod, Tver, and Perm' territories.before. The state had succeeded in developing relations with other countries in Europe and to consolidate its international position. In 1497 the first All-Russian Law Code (Sudebnik) was approved .\n\nJust at this time of establishing Russian state system the national emblem of Russia became the double-headed eagle as a symbol of supreme power, sovereignty and autocracy as it was introduced in Russia. The first remained evidence of the double-headed eagle appreciated as an emblem of Russia was its placing by Ivan III on the great prince's seal. It stamped in 1497 the charter of share and allotment in respect to possessions of independent princes. At the same time the image of gilded double-headed eagle upon a red ground appeared on the walls of the Faceted Chamber in the Kremlin.\n\nIn 1465, Ahmed Khan seized power in the Horde by rising against his brother Mahmud bin Küchük, who had been its ruler since 1459. In 1472, Ahmed Khan entered into alliance with the Polish king Casimir IV against Ivan III of Russia. In 1476, Ahmed Khan suggested to Ivan III that he should recognize him as his overlord. However the situation of forces was not in the Horde's favour.\n\nIn 1480, Ahmed Khan organized another military campaign against Muscovy, which would result in the great stand on the Ugra river, 150 miles from Moscow. They stood off shouting at one another on opposite banks for weeks before a conflict became inevitable. Panic set in, as both sides suddenly turned deciding to flee, rather than fight in the tradition of Genghis Khan. The Horde's retreat meant that the last of the conflict between Eurasians was over. The Mongols' last possessions were in Kazan, Astrakhan, and the Crimea. Ivan III, Russia's ruler finally freed himself from the Tatar-Mongol dependency.\n\nOn 6 January 1481, Ahmed Khan and his men were killed by Siberian Khan, Ibak Khan of Tyumen and Nogays at the mouth of the Donets River.\n\nConquest of Twer 1485\n\nEquestrian mantle of an Emperor [14]\n\nprobably of Iwan III\n\nBlueish-black silk with golden embroidery. Undated but probably 15th century (or alternatively: Byzantine, beginning 11th cent).\n\nBecause of the color of the mantle, the shape of the crown and the three human figures underneath the hooves of the horse (the princes of Jaroslavl, Rostov and Novgorod for example) it is proposed that the mantle is of russian origin in connection with the byzantine court after the marriage of Sophia Paleologa (1472). And probably a gift of Sophia Palaeologa in 1480.\n\nIwan III, the Great on his throne, 1488\n\nThe sovereign in official dress with sceptre, orb and capped crown crested with a cross. On the top of the throne a black two-headed eagle. On his right, on a lesser throne, his son Iwan the Young.\n\nDetail of The 1488 legation of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary in the court of Ivan III of Russia. Painting of an unknown Hungarian artist from the early 16th century. Hungarian National Gallery. The Hungarians are in red and black clothes. [15]\n\nA black two-headed eagle but nimbused was also the heraldic emblem of Emperor Frederick III of the Holy Roman Empire (1452-1493). Such an eagle was introduced by Emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg when emperor elected 1417.\n\n1491 Ivan IIIs full title was carved in latin and russian in 1491 on stone slabs of the Frolov Gate of the present Spassky Tower of the Kremlin. The Russian inscription reads:\n\nIn the Julian year of 6999, by the Grace of God, this Tower was erected on the orders // of Ivan, son of Vassily, Ruler and Autocrat of All Russia and Grand Prince of Vla//dimir and Moscow and Novgorod and Pskov and Tver and Yug//ria and Vyatka and Permia and Bolgary etc. in the 30th year of his reign and was built by Pyotr Antonie from the city of Milan.\n\nThe original stones are in the depositories of the State Museums of the Kremlin. In 1949 copies were put back in the Spassky Tower.\n\nConstruction slab from the Saviour's Tower\n\nRussia, 1491\n\nArchitect Pietro Antonio Solari\n\nWhite stone; colouring, adzing, carving\n\nHeight 59 cm; width 84 cm; depth 10 cm\n\nAcquired by the museum collection after restoration works in 1950.\n\nOn the stone in the museum the following latin text is inscribed:\n\nIOANNES VASILII DEI GRATIA MAGNUS DUX VOLODIMERIAE, MOSCOVIAE, NOVOGARDIAE, TFERIAE, PLESCOVIAE, VETICIAE, ONGARIAE, PERMIAE, BUOLGARIAE ET ALIAS TOTIUSQUE RAXIE DOMINUS, ANNO 30 IMPERII SUI HAS TURRES CONDERE FECIT ET STATUIT PETRUS ANTONIUS SOLARIUS MEDIOLANENSIS ANNO NATIVIT ATIS DOMINI 1491 KALENDIS MARTIIS IUSSIT PONERE.\n\nThat is:\n\nIvan Vasiliyevich, by the grace of God the Grand Duke of Vladimir, Moscow, Novgorod, Tver, Pskov, Vyatka, Yugra, Perm, Bulghar, and for other reasons that of all of Raxis, the year 30 of their government, these towers he did [commission] a Pietro Antonio Solari of Milan in the first of March, in the year of the Lord 1491.\n\nPassage in the Kremlin Palace of Facets\n\nIn 1487, Grand Duke Ivan III commissioned two Italian Renaissance architects, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, to build a stone palace after a series of fires that had ravaged the then predominantly wooden Kremlin. The new palace was completed in 1492 and served as the most important venue for formal receptions of the Tsar, coronation celebrations, feasts, and state ceremonies.\n\nThe black two-headed eagle was abandoned at the same time and exchanged for the golden two-headed eagle of Byzantium, obsolete since the fall of the Eastern-Roman Emperor in 1453. Thus the black two-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, being the badge of rank of an imperial vicar of the Holy Roman Empire was replaced by the badge of rank of a greek commander and chief of ceremonies.\n\n1497 Seal: Rider and dragon\n\nCaption: grand prince ioan by gods grace sovereign of all rus.\n\nCounter seal: Crowned two-headed eagle.
