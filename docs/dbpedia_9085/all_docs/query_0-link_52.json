        "text": "Question to al,\n\nI am very much aware of the differences between Litvaks and Galitzianas but my question really questions where and how did the term Galitziana come from? I ask this because about 18 years ago I was touring In Northern Portugal and we decided to cross the border into Spain. My wife at that tome spoke fluent Castllian Spanish. The Provence in Spain just to the north of Portugal is called Galicia. I wonder if many years ago it was the Sephardim who were referred to as Gslitianas because of the Provence. By the way the people of Galicia have their own dialect as they do not speak Castilian Spanish either. They had to bring a translator over who spoke Spanish as we know it so that we could order at a restaurant\n\nAlan Tapper\n\nThink it's just coincidence that there are 2 areas in Europe with similar names. Galicia was Austrian Poland in the past and the name would come from German, probably. In Yiddish, our ancestors would have been Galitzianers.\n\nHarvey Kaplan\n\nGlasgow, Scotland\n\nTROPP, STORCH - Kolbuszowa, Cmolas - Galicia\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Tue, 4 Aug 2020 at 14:46, Alan Tapper via groups.jewishgen.org <sabaalan=ymail.com@...> wrote:\n\nQuestion to al,\n\nI am very much aware of the differences between Litvaks and Galitzianas but my question really questions where and how did the term Galitziana come from?

Both places, Spanish Galicia and Polish Galitzia were inhabitated by Celtic tribes in the past, with the root GAL as an ethnic marker, see also: PortuGAL, Galia (latin for France), Gales (Spanish for Wales), Gaelic/ Irish language and so on.\n\nDaniel Bargman\n\nMaybe from the Romania town Galati which is located on the Danube River before it enters the Black Sea.\n\nHarry Green\n\nwikipedia says that the name comes from the town of Halytsch on the river Dnjester\n\nGenners,\n\nWhat I recall from my childhood in Israel is –\n\nA female from Galicia was referred to as Galiciana\n\nA male from Galicia was referred to as Galicianer\n\nShalom, Malka cChosnek\n\nGalicia (Eastern Europe)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to navigationJump to search\n\nFor the autonomous community of northwest Spain, see Galicia (Spain).\n\nGalicia\n\nLocation of Galicia (green) in Europe (dark gray)\n\nMap of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, 1914\n\nMap of Europe in 1328\n\nGalicia ( ;[1] Ukrainian and Rusyn: Галичина, Halyčyna; Polish: Galicja; Czech and Slovak: Halič; German: Galizien; Hungarian: Galícia/Kaliz/Gácsország/Halics; Romanian: Galiția/Halici; Russian: Галиция, Galitsiya; Yiddish: גאַליציע‎ Galitsiye) is a historical and geographic region between Central and Eastern Europe.[2][3][4] It was once the small Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia and later a crown land of Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, which straddled the modern-day border between Poland and Ukraine. The area, named after the medieval city of Halych,[5][6][7] was first mentioned in Hungarian historical chronicles in the year 1206 as Galiciæ.[8][9] In 1253 Prince Daniel of Galicia was crowned the King of Rus (Latin: Rex Rusiae) or King of Ruthenia following the Mongol invasion in Ruthenia (Kievan Rus). In 1352 the Kingdom of Poland annexed the Kingdom of Galicia and Volhynia as the Ruthenian Voivodeship (Latin: Palatinatus Russiae).\n\nThe German name for Galicia is Galizien. Someone from Galizien is a Galizianer (male) Galizianerin (female). Daniel Bargman explains interestingly the linguistic root.\n\nStephen Katz\n\nNew York City\n\nThis is a question I've had forever, so thanks for posting it.\n\nRe Gallego, I have a friend who grew up in Galicia, and learned from her that the language is mutually intelligible with Spanish, but more in the sense that if you speak Portuguese (which Gallego resembles closely--no surprise, since it borders Portugal) or Italian you can get the gist of it, and vice versa. Also, people in Galicia didn't have much choice to learn Spanish. Growing up under Franco she and her friends were not permitted to speak Gallego in school; if they did, they were punished. Tout ca change ...\n\n--\n\nErika Gottfried\n\nTeaneck, New Jersey\n\nI am grateful for Reuven Mor's detailed repsonse.. Despite the coincidence of names an Ashkenazi Jew (even with vague whispers of Sephardic forebeareers )know only of Galitzianers who lived in an area of Poland/Ukraine thjat had suffered most from 17th century Cossack cruelties."
