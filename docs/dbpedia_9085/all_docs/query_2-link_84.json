It was on a historic east-west route linking Kiev with the west through Brest, in today's Belarus, as well as a north-south route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, now Istanbul, Turkey.\n\n1199: Galicia and Volhynia were brought together under Prince Roman Mstyslavych.\n\n1349: Poland and Lithuania went to war. Volhynia ended up with in the grand duchy of Lithuania in 1352. Poland seized the western part, including Chelm, in 1366. The two countries started working together in 1385. Volhynia was considered a principality until 1452, then a province.\n\n1569: Poland and Lithuania were brought together under one government through the Union of Lublin. Volhynia region was incorporated into the Polish kingdom. The administrative system in the area remained unchanged for the next two centuries. The local government was the Volhynia voivodship.\n\n1783: German colony established at Koretz, west of Novograd-Volynsk.\n\n1793: With the second partition of Poland, Volhynia was incorporated into Russia. Ukraine was divided along the Dniper River, which runs through Kiev. Zhitomir became the centre of the western side of Ukraine, and courts and other government institutions were moved there. Germans -- and Czechs, and French -- started moving to Volhynia around the time of the second partition.\n\n1797: The Volhynian gubernia was established, with its capital in Zhitomir. The government had 17 districts: Novograd-Volynsk, Labunsk, Volodymersk, Kovel, Zaslavsk, Ostrog, Rovno, Dombrovyts, Ovruch, Zhitomir, Chudniv, Lutsk, Dubno, Kremenetsk, Yampilsk, Bazalivsk and Starokanstantinovka. Radomyshl, northwest of the city of Zhitomir and part of today's Zhitomir oblast, was transferred to the Kiev gubernia.\n\nThere were minor internal changes to the Volhynia gubernia over the years. The Chudniv district was liquidated and its territory transferred to Zhitomir and Novograd-Volynskiy districts. In 1846 Berdichev with adjoining territories was separated from Zhitomir district and became a center of new district.\n\n1801: Lutheran church established in Zhitomir.\n\n1804: Zhitomir becomes the capital of the Volhynian gubernia.\n\n1816: Germans set up colonies in Volhynia.

The district unit within the gubernia was the uezdy or powity. Think of the gubernia as a state and the uezdy as a county.\n\n1918: Ukraine was declared independent, and Zhitomir was named the capital. This lasted until 1922.\n\n1918: Germans return to Volhynia from their eastern exile.\n\n1920: Civil registration started.\n\n1921: According to the Riga peace treaty betwen Poland and Russia, signed on March 18, 1921, some of Volhynia's western districts were turned over to Poland. The districts included Kovel, Lutsk, Dubno, Rovno, Ostrog, as well as most of Kremenetsk and two regions in the Novograd-Volynsk district, Koretz and Kysorytsk (today, Rokitno).\n\n1923: The gubernia system replaced by okrugs. The Volhynian okrug was established in 1925.\n\nMid 1920s: Individual farms in Eastern (Russian) Volhynia are seized by the government, and collective farms established.

A new oblast was Volhynia, with the capital in Lutzk, and another was Rovno, with Rovno as the capital. Germans from western Volhynia were shipped west, into German-held territory.\n\n1941: The Germans the Soviet invade in June.

The former Soviet oblast and raion system was retained.\n\nSources include Richard Benert, Don Miller, a Russian encyclopedia from 1865, the Encyclopedia Britannica from 1964, atlases, and an unpublished thesis prepared by a university student in Zhitomir.\n\nWeb www.volhynia.com"
