        "text": "The Chronicle of Halych-Volhonia is a major historical and literary treasure stemming from the 13th century picking up the tale of how Kyivan Rus turned into Russia proper\n\nThe Chronicle of Halych-Volhynia and Historical Collections in Medieval Rus’\n\nBy Adrian Jusupović\n\nBrill Publishing 2022\n\nThe objective of this book is to identify the narrative strategy and chronology applied in The Chronicle of Halych-Volhynia, and to consider whether this source was intended to form part of a historical collection from the beginning. From the early 13th century in Rus’, chronicling began to be cultivated in various centres, focusing on the history of the local area, and therefore in this period historiographical material was collected for specific ideological purposes, providing a genesis of the history of the Rus’. By re-working this history, subsequent authors gave their writings a novel quality, albeit one that remained firmly rooted in older historiographic collections.\n\nThe Halych–Volhynian Chronicle (Ukrainian: Галицько-Волинський літопис) is a prominent benchmark of the Old Ruthenian literature and historiography covering 1201–1292 in the history of the Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia (in modern Ukraine). The original chronicle did not survive; the oldest known copy is in the Hypatian Codex. The Chronicle continues the record of events begun inthe main Kyivan Chronicle, The Tale of Bygone Years.\n\nThis study offers a fresh new look at the complexities of Rus’ian historiography in the Middle Ages.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:"
