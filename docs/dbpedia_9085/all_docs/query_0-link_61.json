        "text": "Halych\n\nHalych (Ukrainian: Га́лич, romanized: Halyč [ˈɦɑlɪtʃ]; Romanian: Halici; Polish: Halicz; Russian: Га́лич, romanized: Galič; German: Halytsch) is a historic city on the Dniester River in western Ukraine. The city gave its name to the Principality of Halych, the historic province of Galicia (Halychyna), and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, of which it was the capital until the early 14th century, when the seat of the local rulers moved to Lviv. Nowadays, Halych is a small town located only on one part of the territory of the former Galician capital, although it has preserved its name. It functions as the administrative center of Halych Raion (district) of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (region). It lies 26 km (16 mi) north of the oblast capital, Ivano-Frankivsk. Population: 6,247 (2016 est.)."
