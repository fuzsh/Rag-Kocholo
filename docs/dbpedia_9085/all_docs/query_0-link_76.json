        "text": "In this article the author collects different forms of interactions between the Kingdom of Poland and other powers in Eastern Europe with the Tatars of the Golden Horde in the second half of the 14th century. Despite the prominent military conflicts, such as the Battle at the Vorskla River in 1399, traces of various interactions can be found on diplomatic, military, economical and social level. While the usage of Tatars as an „alien” other is dominant in the sources, especially in correspondence with the Pope, pragmatic forms of interaction between the Tatars and their western neighbours shaped the history of Eastern Europe, even though they are not as well represented in the source material. The author shows, how characterizations of hostile alieness and pragmatic alterity are not unalterable, but can change due to different contexts.\n\nThe author discusses a hypothesis concerning the final stage of functioning of a small, medieval hillfort located on „Zamczysko” hill in Sanok-Biała Góra. Artefacts found during excavations and other stray finds are dated to the second half of the 13th and 14th centuries. Among them over 130 projectile heads were found, which confirms – apart of the traces of fire on the courtyard – that the hillfort was destroyed in the course of a warlike onslaught. The analysis of the political situation in the vicinity of Sanok in this time allows to relate connect these facts to the military activity of the Polish King Casimir III the Great. This ruler who succeeded to the throne of the Duchy of Galicia after Duke Bolesław Jerzy II had been poisoned by boyars in 1340, marched with his troops and occupied the western part of the duchy, including Sanok.\n\nThis research deals with the immediate consequences of the subordination of the most influential prince of Southern Rus', Daniel Romanovich, to the Mongol Empire at the beginning of 1246. It considers the problem of issuing symbols of Mongolian kaans' power to subordinate rulers, jarligs (yarlyks) and paitza, to the Galician and Volhynian princes (knyazes), conducting censuses of population on the conquered Galician-Volhyn lands for taxation, and introduction of taxes and duties by the Mongols in the territories, they conquered. Due to the conciseness of sources, in the Galician-Volhynian lands existence only part of the taxes and duties, known in other lands of Rus', can be confirmed. More clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the problem on introduction the Mongols' possible direct rule in Galicia, however currently known sources cannot reaffirm this assumption. In the same way, the sources do not contain information about the Horde origin of a small specific stratum of the population called \"Ordyntsy\" and \"Kalannyie\" on the territory of Galicia. The combination of known factors in the subordination of the Galician-Volhynian princes confirms the previously made assumptions about their rather specific status within the Mongol Empire."
