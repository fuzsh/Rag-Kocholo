Halych (Ukrainian and Russian: Галич, German: Halytsch, Polish: Halicz) is a historic city on the Dniester River in western Ukraine. The town gave its name to the historic province and kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, of which it was the capital until the early 14th century, when the seat of the local princes was moved to Lviv. In 1340-1772, the province comprised the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Today Halych is a small city and is located right next to the former capital of the Galicia Kingdom although it preserved its former name.
