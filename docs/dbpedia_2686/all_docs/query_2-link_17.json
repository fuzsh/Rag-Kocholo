        "text": "A brief outline of the history and sources of the malacological collection at the Delaware Museum of Natural History is given. All type material (as defined by ICZN Article 72) was separated from the main collection. This paper reviews and lists the type holdings of Recent prosobranch and opisthobranch gastropods. The type status of each specimen was studied by comparison with the original publications. A total of 191 type lots of 160 species-group taxa from 65 authors is recognized; 55 of these are holotypes or syntype lots. The majority of name-bearing types consists of marine caenogastropod prosobranchs. An annotated list of all type lots as well as an author index are given. The list of references contains all papers in which the taxa are first described and also other major publications based on the collection.\n\nThis is the second part of a series on the German zoologist Johannes Thiele (1860-1935) and comprises a critical listing of the genus-group taxa which he described as new to malacology. Each of these names is accompanied by author and bibliographic references, original status, type-species with its original binominal spelling and bibliographic source and some data on subsequent taxonomic placements. Thiele introduced a total of 291 such names in the Phylum Mollusca, distributed as follows: 11 Aplacophora; 39 Polyplacophora; 200 Gastropoda (138 Prosobranchia; 20 Opisthobranchia and 42 Pulmonata); 31 Bivalvia; 10 Cephalopoda; there were no new scaphopod or monoplacophoran names. Of these, later authors recognized as valid 85 at the generic level, 110 at the subgeneric level; 71 are considered to be synonyms, and the remaining 25 are unjustified emendations or errors.\n\nEuropean Alien Species Information Network (EASIN): supporting European policies and scientific research Stelios Katsanevakis1,2*, Ivan Deriu1, Fabio D’Amico1, Ana Luísa Nunes1, Sara Pelaez Sanchez1, Fabio Crocetta1, Margarita Arianoutsou3, Ioannis Bazos3, Anastasia Christopoulou3, Giovanna Curto4, Pinelopi Delipetrou5, Yannis Kokkoris3, Vadim Panov6, Wolfgang Rabitsch7, Alain Roques8, Riccardo Scalera9, Susan M.
