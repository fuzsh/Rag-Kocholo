        "text": "Anyway, I’m gearing up for a movie right now. I’m always preparing for a movie, but this time I’m preparing for something that is realistic. (omission) it’s a little bit difficult to say the content of the story now. Dare I say it’s somewhat of a mysterious story. One might wonder whether it would be a fun mystery thriller. You might be looking forward to that. But I don’t think that it would be that fun. I think I can attach the name “mystery” to it anyway.\n\nIt’s a story of young people in the world nowadays. When young people look at the world these days, thinking about the world or their life, and wonder if it’s a mystery that can’t be understood– I can say that movie is made with such an intention.\n\nWhat do I think of as the most important thing right now? While I’m working as a movie maker, I ask myself: what should I talk about [through my movies]? When I communicate with the audience, what problems should I share with them? I can’t help but think about that, you know?\n\nAnd although I’ve been thinking about that matter nonstop, the issue that is most important to me now is the story of youth. The story of youth nowadays. The youth now. It’s not only limited to the youth in Korea. It even might be considered a global story.\n\nAs you know, the younger generation has always been a problem for the older generation. They think of them as ill-mannered. And in the eyes of the older generation, the young generation always seems critical of them. However, in a sense, in a way that we haven’t experienced before, and in comparison to the older generation, the younger generation has become more passive, more helpless. In a sense, they have become more adaptive to reality. I think that they have become like that.\n\nAlthough I don’t know if this is just how I feel, but this problem seems to be the nature of youth now. This youth. I want to talk about the problems of this youth. Where did that come from? I want to talk about that with a movie. I think that the movie I’m preparing now gives a story of that kind."
