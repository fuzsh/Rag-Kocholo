        "text": "Description\n\n‘A huge, shining kaleidoscope of joy’– L.D. Lapinski, author of THE STRANGEWORLDS TRAVEL AGENCY\n\nBea’s family are happy. Like, really happy. Like, kind of gross but also cute happy. So when they visit London Pride together and have the ultimate day out, Bea doesn’t think her family could possibly get any happier. But a year later, a grey cloud is following Bea’s family around. Dad has passed away, and without him around they have no choice but to pack their bags and move to the countryside to live with Gran.\n\nWith Bea’s big sister, Riley, taking the news hard, Bea will do anything to cheer her up. So with the help of new friends, The Secret Sunshine Project is formed – Bea’s plan to bring Pride to the countryside and a smile back to Riley’s face. There’s just one teeny tiny problem – the village mayor. A grumpy old woman who’s on a mission to rain on Bea’s parade . . .\n\nPraise for The Secret Sunshine Project:\n\n‘Warm-hearted and cheering, with a dash of sparkle’ – Guardian\n\n‘Vibrant, funny and wise – a book to savour’ – Kiran Millwood Hargrave, author of THE GIRL OF INK AND STARS\n\n‘Funny, fresh and full of heart’ – Katie Tsang, co-author of DRAGON MOUNTAIN\n\n‘Wonderful, warm-hearted stories full of characters to care about’ – Andy Shepherd, author of THE BOY WHO GREW DRAGONS\n\n‘Fizzes with positive, feel-good energy’ – Steven Butler, author of THE NOTHING TO SEE HERE HOTEL\n\n‘Utter sunshine in book form!
