        "text": "In Burning, a young man (Yoo Ah-in) becomes convinced that his romantic rival (Steven Yeun) is a murderer. In Poetry, a grandmother (Yoon Jeong-hee) struggles both with the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and the aftermath of a horrible crime committed by her grandson (Lee Da-wit). In Oasis, a formerly incarcerated man with a mental disability (Sol Kyung-gu) and a woman with cerebral palsy (Moon So-ri) begin a relationship that transcends the disturbing way that they met. All of them suffer, and all of them are changed.\n\nThese traumatic fissures in otherwise placid surfaces lend a unique tone to Lee’s work, underscoring his engrossing character studies with an unsettling tension. This combination of elements wouldn’t work in less skilled hands, but Lee’s approach clicks with Letterboxd members, as evidenced by his filmography’s stellar 4.0 average rating. “I will always be in awe at how Lee Chang-dong can infuse his quiet and seemingly simple aesthetic with such weighty devastation,” shares Cinemateq in their four-and-a-half-star review of Poetry.\n\nHow has your background as a novelist affected your screenwriting?\n\nLee Chang-dong: I tend to write long, detailed scene descriptions when I am working on a screenplay. These help the crew and the actors during production, since they bring out the creativity within the reader and allow them to imagine the scene in detail. It can also help the producers or investors decide whether to make the film or not.\n\nYou have a special relationship with director Park Kwang-su. What have you learned about filmmaking from him?\n\nOnly having written novels before, I started my filmmaking career through writing screenplays for director Park Kwang-su. When writing a novel, no one could tell me what to do, since it only belonged to me. But screenplays had to be written in the vision of the director. It was hard to accept it at first, but I learned how to think and write in a “cinematic” perspective through that process. I learned the most about film through writing my first screenplay.\n\nWhere do you start when developing a film? Do you start with building a character, creating a narrative, or thinking up a specific image?\n\nIt depends on the developmental stage of the film. For example, Peppermint Candy started with a simple desire to create a film about going back in time. Then the image of a man standing on the tracks in front of an oncoming train came to me, along with the final scene of the film. Burning is based on a novel, but I realized that I could make the film only after I thought of the final scene.\n\nYour films always seem to have underlying tension, whether it be interpreted as sadness, trauma or violence. How do you explore the other aspects of a story while maintaining this kind of tension?\n\nI believe that every scene of a film must maintain a tension in them, even if they do not have an explosive emotion or a burst of violence. Not knowing what is going to happen next is “cinematic”—just like our lives. I also do not enjoy creating a scene with an intent to serve a singular purpose, since our lives are not like that. Every single aspect of our lives is complex. Sadness, joy, optimism and pessimism, the light and the dark, all coexist in our everyday lives.\n\nYour films tend to be tragedies, but Green Fish and Burning have aspects of the gangster or thriller genre. What do you think is the relationship between your work and these genres?\n\nGreen Fish and Burning are both films that take the structure of a genre film, while trying to break its clichés. The audience often believes that real-life problems are artificially set within the virtual world of film, thinking that [these problems are] one of the elements that conform to the formula of a genre film. Thus, they are consumed as entertainment within the genre, rather than being seriously reflected upon.\n\nCapitalism works in a way that you must criticize (or pretend to criticize) capitalism within your film while making it commercially successful [at the same time]. If you truly wish to criticize capitalism as a commercial filmmaker who uses a lot of capital to create your films, you must learn to exploit or defy the conventions of a mainstream movie. Burning was a film that started with the intent to defy those genre conventions, and the stereotypes of the audience.\n\nWhat do you think extreme stress or trauma reveals about human nature?\n\nEveryone unexpectedly encounters pain and suffers from hopelessness. That is life. The bigger the desire, the bigger the pain. The problem is how you cope with them. Through the struggle, humans find the purpose of life and find salvation. Protagonists in tragedies are those types of people. I tried to capture the human struggle for meaning through my films."
