        "text": "KCCUK Culture Series\n\nThis week's instalment in the KCCUK Culture Series introduces Korean cinema as a leading component of the Korean Wave and recommends both classic and current films to watch at home.\n\nCinema has arguably always been a leading component of the Korean Wave, and in recent years especially films such as Park Chan-wook’s The Handmaiden, Lee Chang-dong’s Burning and of course Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite have placed the Korean film industry under the international spotlight.\n\nThe KCCUK has always strived to introduce a diverse range of Korean cinema to UK audiences through our biggest event - the London Korean Film Festival - held every autumn, as well as other programmes throughout the year including our Korean Film Nights and LKFF Teaser Screenings.\n\nIn this week’s special feature we introduce the directors leading the K-Cinema Wave, as well as prominent films from the last 100 years of Korean cinema and films to watch in commemoration of the 70th anniversary since the outbreak of the Korean War. We also introduce the leading international film festivals in Korea and recommend some of the latest Korean films available to stream online in the UK.\n\nThe Filmmakers Leading the K-Cinema Wave\n\nNo doubt if you’ve heard just one Korean filmmaker’s name in 2020, it’s Bong Joon-ho – director of the black comedy thriller Parasite which won four Oscars including Best Picture at this year’s Academy Awards. In his iconic Golden Globes speech, Bong claimed that “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.”\n\nThe director recommends a variety of both Korean and international films as guest editor of the March 2020 issue of Sight & Sound magazine. And if you haven’t already, we would recommend checking out Bong’s other work including Memories of Murder (2003), The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013, recently adapted into a TV series on Netflix), and Okja (2017).\n\nHere is our very concise list of other iconic directors leading the international “wave” of Korean cinema:\n\nPark Chan-wook has captured the international imagination time and time again with films such as Joint Security Area (2000), Oldboy (2003) and The Handmaiden (2016) – to name a few. More recently Park directed the critically acclaimed BBC drama series The Little Drummer Girl (2018), based on John le Carré’s 1983 novel of the same name and with an all-star cast including Florence Pugh, Alexander Skarsgård and Michael Shannon.\n\nLee Chang-dong’s film Peppermint Candy (1999) made waves at the turn of the century and is still celebrated today for its groundbreaking interrogation of the national psyche. More recently, his psychological mystery drama Burning (2018) was nominated for several international awards and won the FIPRESCI International Critics’ Prize at Cannes among other accolades.\n\nKim Jee-woon is probably most famous for his psychological horror drama A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) which is the highest-grossing Korean horror film and was the first to be screened in American theatres – leading to an American remake, The Uninvited (2009). Some of the director’s other notable films include A Bittersweet Life (2005), The Good, The Bad, The Weird (2008) and I Saw a Devil (2010).*\n\nHong Sangsoo debuted in 1996 with The Day a Pig Fell into the Well, also the feature film debut of Parasite actor Song Kang-ho. Since then the director has enjoyed widespread international acclaim with such films as Right Now, Wrong Then (2015) which won the Golden Leopard, the top prize at the 68th Locarno International Film Festival, and The Woman Who Ran, for which he recently won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nBora Kim is a more recently up-and-coming director who turned heads in 2018 with her feature debut House of Hummingbird. The film won major awards at the Busan International Film Festival and was awarded the Grand Prix for Best Film by the Generation 14plus international jury at the Berlin International Film Festival. House of Hummingbird was one of five Korean films on the programme at the BFI London Film Festival 2019.\n\nYoon Ga-eun is another female director whose second feature film The House of Us (2019) was screened at the LFF 2019 and who was described by the BFI as “one of the world’s finest filmmakers at capturing contemporary childhood onscreen.” Yoon’s other notable works include Sprout (2013), which won the Crystal Bear for Best Short Film at the Berlin International Film Festival, as well as The World of Us (2015) which earned her Best New Director at the 37th Blue Dragon Film Awards.\n\nA number of these films made it onto the British Film Institute (BFI)’s list of “10 great modern South Korean films” which you can read here for more viewing inspiration.\n\n*Kim Jee-woon's film The Age of Shadows (2016) is currently available to watch for free on BBC iPlayer, for a limited time. Watch the film here.\n\n100 Years of Korean Cinema and the Korean Film Archive on YouTube\n\nLast year’s London Korean Film Festival celebrated a century of Korean cinema from 1919 to 2019, honouring this milestone with a unique programme of UK and European premieres showcasing culturally important titles from throughout Korean film history.\n\nHowever, the best way to learn about Korean film history is arguably by watching the films themselves, so we’ve compiled a list of classic films from the 1930s to the 1990s, many of which were screened at last year’s LKFF and all of which are available to watch with English subtitles on the Korean Film Archive’s classic film YouTube channel. Of course, you should also feel free to browse the channel yourself, as you’ll find a much wider variety of brilliant films than we have space to include on our list.\n\nDiscover our classic film recommendations here\n\nThe 70th Anniversary of the Korean War - In Cinema\n\nThis year (2020) marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War (1950-53). Aside from classic titles in our recommendations list such as Piagol (1955) and North Korean Partisan in South Korea (1990), there are numerous other Korean films that deal with the experiences of Korean people during the war and its aftermath.\n\nOur first season of Korean Film Nights this year, ‘On the Front Line’, features a programme of carefully selected titles from South Korea, the US and the UK, each one shedding light on the Korean War as one of the most important events in Korean history and collective memory.\n\nAlthough the KCCUK screenings have been cancelled due to the outbreak of Covid-19, our new online screening series has made some of these titles available to watch at home on the KCCUK YouTube channel. These include Shin Sang-Ok’s To the Last Day (1960), a melodrama which portrays the struggles and hardships faced by wounded veterans, refugees and war widows. Most recently we have uploaded the beautiful yet disturbing black and white film Jiseul (2012, dir. O Muel), which deals with the massacre of Jeju Islanders during an uprising in 1948-49, just before the Korean War.\n\nThe Latest Korean Films to Stream at Home\n\nThe Korean Film Archive YouTube channel is the best place to go for classic Korean cinema online. But there are also increasing options for those in the UK looking to watch more recent Korean films at home via popular streaming sites.

Three festivals which attract particular attention from global audiences are the Busan International Film Festival, the Jeonju International Film Festival and the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival was the first film festival in Korea recognised by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations and is held annually in Haeundae, Busan every October. The festival has received much fanfare in Asia and has attracted the attention of film industry professionals all over the world. The festival screens a variety of films including international premieres as well as new experimental films.\n\nVisit the festival website\n\nThe Jeonju International Film Festival\n\nThe Jeonju International Film Festival, held in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, is a non-competitive competition that still manages to feature a few elements of competition within the categories of international films, Korean films, and Korean short films.
