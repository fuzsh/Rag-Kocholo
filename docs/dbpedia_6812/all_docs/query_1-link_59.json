        "text": "I’ve heard The Secret Sunshine Project referred to as ‘sweet’ by many people but I find that patronising for such a book! It is a brilliant story of inclusivity, family and loss.\n\nI’ve written and rewritten this review a few times as I don’t want it to come across as condescending like the ‘sweet’ reviews that I’ve read. The book does a fantastic job at normalising LGBT+ which is exactly what we need in MG books and the world generally.\n\nI love how the story starts with pure happiness. You realise that this is a family bursting with love but then death blocks out the sunshine. The rebuilding of the family and their search for happiness is what make this book brilliant. It will give hope to readers who have suffered their own set backs in life. It will teach them to find the good in others and to try to bring the sunshine to their world!\n\nNow if you want to write a story as good as this, you can follow Benjamin’s writing tips!\n\nBenjamin Dean’s Top 5 Writing Tips\n\n1. Be patient! Writing a book can be a long and frustrating process, so don’t be discouraged if you haven’t written a bestseller in three days. Focus on smaller goals and, when things get tough, remember why you started writing your story in the first place.\n\n2. Don’t aim for perfection first time round. Most author’s first drafts are far from perfect, and they’re not supposed to be!\n\n3. Build a house! The foundation and walls come first – this is the broader picture of your story, like an outline or a rough first draft. Then think about floors and paint – editing and elevating the story you’ve just laid down so things start to take shape. Once all of that is set, furnish it – start polishing things up and making it pretty!\n\n4. Ignore number 3. Yes, ignore me if you want to! There is no right or wrong way to write a story. I spent a long time trying to force myself into doing what other writers did and it never worked. The fun of writing is discovering what works for you.\n\n5. Remember that doubt is normal. During every stage of the process, I have doubt over a number of things: Can I do it? Am I good enough? Will anybody else want to read my story? Remember that all your favourite writers experience doubts, no matter how good or successful they are. Don’t let it stand in your way. Your story is worth telling."
