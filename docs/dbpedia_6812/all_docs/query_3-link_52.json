It could not be a more perfect moment for TIFF to bring Summer of Seoul to Toronto audiences.”\n\nTickets for Summer of Seoul will go on sale to Members on June 22 at 10am and to the public on June 29. Opening Night celebration tickets are limited and will be available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nFilms & Special Events"
