        "text": "Saturday Afternoon Cartoons is New York City’s prime theatrical showcase of early and classic animated cartoons, shown in vintage 16mm film prints from the personal archives of historian Tommy José Stathes. Beginning over 20 years ago as a casual effort to find and see early cartoons that were unavailable on home video, Stathes’s collection has grown to become perhaps one of the largest of its kind. It includes many titles and “orphan films” that are difficult to access or view elsewhere.\n\nStathes joins Metrograph in early April with Kids Will Be Kids, a selection of vintage animated shorts that highlight the trials and tribulations of being a human child in a cartoon world. Come enjoy an ornery little boy wreaking havoc with a steam shovel, bedtime stories with a surrealist flair, a little girl getting caught in the middle of a stage show magic act, a discipline lesson for parents during the child-rearing years, and more. Spanning the 1910s through to the ’50s, this assortment showcases classic characters such as Bobby Bumps, Dinky Doodle, Willie Whopper, Betty Boop, Popeye, Little Lulu, Little Audrey, and others.\n\nFeaturing an introduction from and Q&A with Tommy Stathes on Saturday, April 6th.\n\nSet on an Indonesian island in the waning years of Dutch colonialism, Sendijarević’s sophomore feature is a stingingly sardonic satire observing decadence and moral decay on a sugar plantation, which is thrown into turmoil when, following the decease of its patriarch, it’s revealed that he willed the estate to his illegitimate son with his Indigenous housekeeper. A gorgeously shot study of truly ugly human behavior. “[Sendijarević] has established herself as a formidable talent with… a feel for the manicured, placid surfaces that contain rot and rebellion.”—Variety\n\nIntroduction and Q&A with filmmaker Ena Sendijarević, moderated by founder of The Future of Film is Female Caryn Coleman, on Friday, April 12th\n\nThe MVP cinematographer in American independent cinema for more than 40 years running, Elmes is behind some of the most transcendent images in the films of such luminaries as David Lynch—an AFI Conservatory classmate—Jim Jarmusch, Ang Lee, and others. We bring together here six of Elmes’s most ravishing works, together with two of his chosen inspirations, Cries and Whispers (1972) and Tess (1979). An intuitive and endlessly resourceful artist, Elmes describes his approach thusly: “I don’t really have a filmmaking philosophy I live by, but in my favorite scene in Wild At Heart, Lula and Sailor, broke, on the run, and with only bad news on the radio, leave their car on the side of the road, dance wildly and embrace, silhouetted by the setting sun. In that fleeting moment, we relinquished control, relied on instinct, and captured the ineffable.”\n\nIntroductions and Q&As with Frederick Elmes April 13 & 14"
