Mike\n\nLeigh has taken a turn toward a more emotionally direct treatment of his\n\nmaterial in recent years: maybe as early as HIGH HOPES and LIFE IS SWEET,\n\ndefinitely from SECRETS AND LIES on. I've regretted this tendency at\n\ntimes, but VERA DRAKE is the fulfillment of Leigh's recent development.\n\nThe rigor with which Leigh elaborates and develops his story should\n\nfinally make people start wondering how this allegedly improvisational\n\ndirector manages to express himself through structure again and again.\n\nPRIMER, the $7000 film that won the Grand Prize at Sundance this year, is\n\nalso an amazing piece of cinema, the work of a natural artist (Shane\n\nCarruth, a former computer programmer). I can't remember when I last saw\n\na film that felt so unlike every other film I know. The first time I saw\n\nPRIMER, I filled pages with notes on distinctive dialogue and delivery,\n\nuntil I realized that almost every line in the film was striking me as\n\nextraordinary and unprecedented. Of special interest to those who have\n\nbeen exposed to the practical or entrepreneurial sciences.\n\nA very interesting French film, QUI A TUE BAMBI?, opened this week in NYC.\n\nFor some reason this film gets more mixed responses than I expected.\n\nIt's basically a hospital thriller, pegged on an extraordinary natural\n\nperformance by one Sophie Quinton, and indebted to Hitchcock in the best\n\nways, so that it increasingly becomes an interrogation and a\n\nrepositioning of the audience's sympathies. Director Gilles Marchand\n\nwrote the script for Dominic Moll's good suspense film HARRY, UN AMI QUI\n\nVOUS VEUT DU BIEN, but I think his own film is even better. A big plus is\n\nthe art direction of the hospital, in a MARIENBAD-meets-Kubrick mode.\n\nOther worthwhile films in town include Albaladejo's intelligent gay comedy\n\nBEAR CUB, Alexander Payne's compromised but brilliant SIDEWAYS, and our\n\nown Bilge Ebiri's genre-bending NEW GUY. - Dan\n\n18003\n\nFrom: hotlove666\n\nDate: Fri Nov 19, 2004 6:37pm\n\nSubject: Torino\n\nGreetings from a very good fest, where I just ran into fellow AFBist\n\nChris Fujiwara, seeing Big Red One whole for the first time on Sam\n\nand Christa's 38th wedding anniversary. Jean-Claude Rousseau's\n\nshorts, the retro of an old Italian director named Emmer, Soldiers\n\nPay, several Sganzerlas (including his incredible last film) and a\n\nmini-Fleischer retro, which just screened 10 Rillington, have all\n\nbeen great experiences. Disappointments: the new Paulo Rocha,\n\nVanitas, and A Visit to the Louvre by the Straubs. The only Emmer\n\nI've seen is Chronicle of August -- anyone know it? Cross-\n\nfertilization experience of the fest: the Sganzerla girls (Elena,\n\nSinai, Djin) wandered into a screening of The Stupids and loved it so\n\nmuch they're seeing it again tomorrow. They send their love, Ruy.\n\n18004\n\nFrom: Dan Sallitt\n\nDate: Fri Nov 19, 2004 6:47pm\n\nSubject: Re: I love PEPPERMINT CANDY - and Korean Cinema\n\n> FORREST GUMP meets IRREVERSIBLE, and both get utterly outclassed by\n\n> the dynamic duo of director Lee Chang-dong and actor Sol Kyung-gu\n\n> (easily one of the best performances of this decade so far).\n\nYeah, it's a very good film. Everything Lee has directed has been worthy:\n\nOASIS is as good as PEPPERMINT CANDY, I think, and even the early GREEN\n\nFISH is distinctive and expressive.\n\nOut of what I've seen already, I'd also recommend both the Hong Sang-soo\n\nfilms, and Park Chan-ok's very good JEALOUSY IS MY MIDDLE NAME. - Dan\n\n18005\n\nFrom: David Ehrenstein\n\nDate: Fri Nov 19, 2004 7:16pm\n\nSubject: Re: Currently in theaters\n\n--- Dan Sallitt"
