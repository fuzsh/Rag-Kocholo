Fatal Femmes: Two Parisian Crime Films by Women Fri, Feb 16 | 7:30pm | TMT From the neon-drenched underworld of early 1980s Paris come two stylish crime stories by French women filmmakers, both of whom passed at the young age of 42. A creative collaborator with Jacques Rivette on Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974), actress Juliet Berto (1947â1990) pivoted behind the camera for her directorial debut with Neige (1981), a grimy vision of Paris's carnivalesque Pigalle neighborhood, best known as the home of the Moulin Rouge and the cityâs red-light district. Berto also stars as Anita, a barmaid who steps in to help peddle heroin to the desperate clients of a murdered drug dealer. Prolific film and television actress Christine Pascal (1953â1996) directs her second feature, La Garce (1984), with Isabelle Huppert starring as the mysterious woman at the heart of a Hitchcockian tale set in the world of French haute couture. After serving time for sexual assault, a disgraced cop (Richard Berry) is released from prison and finds work as a private detective. His first case takes him to Parisâs garment district, where he becomes enmeshed in a bizarre web of relations and events. Both making their Los Angeles premieres with brand-new 4K restorations courtesy of Fun City Editions, these features offer a fascinating conversation between two unique filmmaking sensibilities.

Remembering Harry Belafonte: Buck and the Preacher Sat, Feb 24 | 7:30pm | TMT Throughout the 96 years of his remarkable life, the singer, actor, and activist Harry Belafonte (1927â2023) broke countless barriers. Belafonte was the first solo artist to sell over a million records with his widely acclaimed album Calypso (1956). He experienced two robust periods in Hollywood: first with studio pictures like Carmen Jones (1954) and The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959); and again, in the 1970s, when he notably teamed with longtime friend Sidney Poitier to support his debut directorial effort with Buck and the Preacher (1972) and its smash-hit follow-up, Uptown Saturday Night (1974). Citing Hollywoodâs disinterest in socially conscious filmmaking as the reason behind his decade-long hiatus, Belafonte spent his time\n\nSPOTLIGHTS (led by Jack Palance at his most chilling). The deceptively simple storyline has been imitated countless times since, but Stevensâs thoughtful direction lends it unexpected depth and resonance, aided by the rich beauty of Loyal Griggsâs Oscar-winning color cinematography. The film also earned nominations for Best Picture, Directing, A. B. Guthrie Jr.âs original screenplay, and the supporting performances of De Wilde and Palance; that same year, George Stevens received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. Programmed by K.J. Relth-Miller. Note by Robert Reneau.\n\nDIRECTED BY: George Stevens. WRITTEN BY: A. B. Guthrie Jr. WITH: Alan Ladd,Jean Arthur, Van Heflin, Jack Palance. 1953. 118 min. USA. Color.

Ninety-five years after King Jr. was born, the Academy Museum pays tribute to his impact and legacy with two films showcasing the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In the historic short film The March , filmmaker James Blue documents this significant moment with over a dozen camera and sound technicians capturing over 11 hours of footage and audio, culminating at the nationâs capital with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.âs âI Have a Dreamâ speech. For the feature film The Bus , activist filmmaker Haskell Wexler boarded a bus in San Francisco with a group of Black and white activists to embark on the three-day, cross-country journey to Washington DC to join the March. Following the two films, local scholars, activists, and emerging filmmakers will discuss the enduring importance of speaking truth to power through the documentation of political movements. Programmed by Lohanne Cook, K.J. Relth-Miller, and Eduardo Sanchez. Note by K.J. Relth-Miller.\n\nExisting in the liminal space between marketing and art, trailers are multifaceted in their function: at worst, a blatant misrepresentation or catalyst of spoilers; at best, a film in miniature to be appreciated in its own right. Presented entirely on 35mm film, primarily sourced from the worldâs largest collection of movie trailers at the Academy Film Archive, this program highlights classic coming attractions containing unique material created solely for promotion. Rather than wholly consisting of the expected selection of scenes from the films advertised, these retro trailers incorporate elements extending beyond the final cut. Exclusive material takes on various forms, ranging from specialty artwork and animation to behind-the-scenes footage, introductions hosted by filmmakers, elaborate marketing campaigns, and even trailers that refrain from exhibiting a single frame of the film itself. By serving as experimental companion pieces to feature presentations, these short films take on a dimension of their own. Programmed and note by Academy Film Archive Film Preservationists Cassie Blake and Tessa Idlewine.\n\nSHANE\n\nThe George Stevens Lecture on Directing presents the 70th Anniversary of Shane Sun, Dec 10 | 7:30pm | DGT In person: George Stevens Jr. and Christopher Nolan. Initiated in 1982, the Academyâs George Stevens Lecture on Directing presents this 70th anniversary screening of Stevensâs classic Western, Shane , which in 1993 was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry.

Song Kang-ho is The Weird, a bandit who stumbles upon a treasure map, which prompts a spiral chase game between him, The Good, and The Bad in the vast land of Manchuria of the late 1930s . Song, once again, proves his multifaceted expertise which enables him to become any âweirdâ character heâd like to, while maintaining his authentic core presence in the depiction. The Good, the Bad, the Weird , a spectacular blockbuster, is a declaration for a new genreâKimchi Western. DIRECTED BY: Kim Jee-woon. WRITTEN BY: Kim Jee-woon, Kim Min-suk. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Lee Byung-hun, Jung Woo-sung. 2008. 130 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. Rated R. 35mm.\n\nMEMORIES OF MURDER ( ì´ì¸ì ì¶ìµ )\n\nMemories of Murder ( ì´ì¸ì ì¶ìµ ) in 4K Sat, Dec 9 | 7:30pm | DGT Bong Joon-hoâs phenomenal breakthrough feature, Memories of Murder , is a timely film that gifted Bong with the very first collaboration opportunity with Song Kang-ho, who later becomes his beloved muse. Inspired by a true story, the film centers around the gruesome serial killings of women in Korea in the 1980s, investigated by Doo-man (Song Kang-ho), a detective who relies on instincts rather than factual objectives. Songâs brilliance contributes to the successful orchestration of Bongâs vision which challenges conventional components of storytelling and blurs the boundaries between genre categories. DIRECTED BY: Bong Joon-ho. WRITTEN BY: Bong Joon-ho, Shim Sung-bo. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Kim Sang-kyung, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il. 2003. 131 min. South Korea. Color.

In the span of three decades, Song Kang-ho has cultivated unprecedented trajectories in his practice, illuminating new possibilities of cinema as an art form and beyond, while contributing to the expansion of Korean cinema since his debut in the mid-1990s. Born in 1967, Song aspired to become an actor as young as age 15, realizing his dream by joining a theatre company in his early 20s. Song made his film debut in 1996 at the dawn of the renaissance of Korean cinema, and has remained incredibly prolific, crafting a remarkable array of work. A master of versatility, Song employs negative space in his artistry, resisting the urge to convey his characters in linear, conventional ways. His insight transcends the boundaries of acting, resembling that of a director, with extensive knowledge of filmmaking elements and the importance of their harmony as the collective force to create good cinema. The Academy Museum is honored to present the first retrospective series of Song Kang-ho, celebrating his dynamic career and his genuine love for cinema.

For Shin-ae, a widow with a young son, forgiveness is an unfathomable path to peace as her comfort only exists within the agony of contempt and destruction caused by her sonâs murder. While nothing seems to redeem her tormented existence, Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a local mechanic, accompanies Shin-ae through her journey of despair with grace and compassion, hinting at a beam of hope and self- redemption penetrating through the dark clouds. DIRECTED BY: Lee Chang-dong. WRITTEN BY: Lee Chang-dong. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Jeon Do-yeon. 2007. 142 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. 35mm.

After starring in Kim Jee-woonâs debut film, Song Kang-ho joins him again in Kimâs second feature, The Foul King , and shines in his portrayal of an ordinary office man who goes through a revolutionary transformation of self- liberation, transitioning into the man he used to only dream of becoming. DIRECTED BY: Kim Jee-woon. WRITTEN BY: Kim Jee-woon, Kim Dae-woo. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Jang Jin-young, Park Sang-myun. 2000. 112 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. 35mm. Print courtesy of KOFA. Broker ( ë¸ë¡ì»¤ ) In Broker , Hirokazu Koreedaâs authentic perception of humanity and human emotions is contemplated through an investigation of relationships in connection to oneâs surrounding conditions. Song Kang-ho portrays Sang-hyun, owner of an old dry cleaning shop, who struggles through a dilemma involving criminal activityâselling orphaned infants. Songâs articulation of Sang-hyunâs inner journey is filtered through a rather minimal artistic language, and simultaneously carries appropriate weight of the complicated mental and physical traits of the character. DIRECTED BY: Hirokazu Koreeda. WRITTEN BY: Hirokazu Koreeda. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Bae Doona, Gang Dong-won, Lee Ji-eun. 2022. 129 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. Rated R. 4K DCP.\n\nThis series is made possible by a grant from the Korea Foundation.\n\nParasite ( ê¸°ìì¶© ) in 4K Thu, Dec 7 | 7:30pm | DGT\n\nSympathy for Mr. Vengeance ( ë³µìë ëì ê² ) Fri, Dec 8 | 7:30pm | DGT\n\nParasite is a 132-minute masterpiece that won Oscars for Best Picture, International Feature Film, Directing, and Original Screenplay. The ironic anxiety driven by the ongoing unpredictability throughout the film is a crucial component that shapes the eccentric undertone meticulously crafted by director Bong Joon-hoâs vision and achieved by his brilliant muse, Song Kang-ho, who portrays the father of a struggling family that infiltrates the household of a wealthy one. Parasite is one of the most significant films in the history of cinema, and Songâs finesse looms large in the filmâs magnificent foundation. DIRECTED BY: Bong Joon-ho. WRITTEN BY: Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin Won. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik. 2019. 132 min. South Korea. Color. Scope. Korean. Rated R. 4K DCP.\n\nThe first of Park Chan-wookâs Vengeance Trilogy is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance , a thriller that examines the darker side of the human interior instigated by revenge. Park employs a raw yet simultaneously stylish and refined structural language of cinema to reveal the abyss of unstable emotional territories created by destructive terror. Dong-jinâs life is shattered when his daughter gets kidnapped by Ryu, a young factory worker who is deaf-mute, and is left with no other choice than revenge. In his portrayal of Dong-jin, Song profoundly surveys the characterâs emotional journey and the extreme internal shift generated by vengeance, as well as the altering definitions of good and evil. DIRECTED BY: Park Chan-wook. WRITTEN BY: Park Chan-wook, Lee Jae-soon, Lee Moo-young, Lee Yong-jong. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Shin Ha-kyun, Bae Doona. 2002. 129 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. Rated R.

( ê³µëê²½ë¹êµ¬ì­ JSA) Thu, Dec 21 | 7:30pm | TMT Song Kang-ho and Park Chan-wookâs first collaboration, Joint Security Area was the highest-grossing film in the history of Korean cinema upon its release in 2000. Set in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), it begins with an investigation around a puzzling incident that left two North Korean soldiers dead, forecasting an ominous revelation. There is an undeniably poignant and sorrowful sentiment throughout the narrative, reflecting the collective grief of the Korean Peninsula on its division. Song Kang-ho, in his portrayal of a North Korean soldier in dilemma, searches through the dark forest of tangled emotions with graceful subtlety and vulnerability. DIRECTED BY: Park Chan-wook. WRITTEN BY: Park Chan-wook, Seong-san Jeong, Kim Hyeon-seok, Lee Mu-yeong. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Lee Byung-hun, Lee Yeong-ae. 2000. 110 min. South Korea. Color. Korean. DCP.\n\nThe Host ( ê´´ë¬¼ ) in 35mm Thu, Jan 11 | 7:30pm | TMT\n\nOscar-winning director Bong Joon-hoâs third feature film, The Host , is a monster blockbuster starring Song Kang-ho as Park Gang-du. The film begins with a US military doctor (the late Scott Wilson) ordering his assistant to illegally dump toxic chemicals down a drain that leads to the Han River. Several years later, a mutated monster emerges from the river to wreak havoc on Seoul. When the monster abducts his daughter, Gang-du and his squabbling family band together to rescue her. Equal parts creature feature, dysfunctional family comedy, and political satire, The Host is a monumental work. DIRECTED BY: Bong Joon-ho. WRITTEN BY: Bong Joon-ho, Ha Won-jun, Baek Chul-hyun. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il, Bae Doona. 2006. 120 min. South Korea. Color. Korean.

Song Kang-ho plays a moral priest who accidentally turns into a vampire after volunteering for a medical experiment and is faced with the dilemmas of his new existence. In Thirst , Song showcases his exceptional mastery over satire, contributing exceptional and ironic tonality throughout the film. DIRECTED BY: Park Chan-wook. WRITTEN BY: Park Chan-wook, Chung Seo-kyeong. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Kim Ok-vin, Kim Hae-sook, Shin Ha-kyun. 2009. 133 min. South Korea. Color. Scope. Korean.

When Hinzpeter, a German journalist, offers him a large sum of cash, he agrees to take a long drive from Seoul to Gwangju, the besieged city where military brutality is rampant against civilian protesters and bystanders. Set in 1980s Gwangju, A Taxi Driver is based on tragic true events of the Gwangju Uprising. Songâs performance boldly and empathetically articulates the urgency and devastation rooted in the narrative. DIRECTED BY: Jang Hoon. WRITTEN BY: Eom Yu-na.

Based on true historical events, the film delves into the series of incidents that drive Yeongjo further away from his son, leading him to the extreme decision to execute Sado by locking him in a wooden rice barrel and starving him for eight days. The great Song Kang-ho insightfully and carefully examines the anguish, confusion, despair, and anger of Yeongjo without judgment, and through Songâs fair interpretation, we, the audience, are offered a space to gaze at the ruthless father/king, with better context and possible sympathy.

Lee Jung-chool (Song Kang-ho), a Korean officer in the Japanese police force, is tasked with a mission to capture Korean resistance fighters and agonizes over the dilemma and collision between his dual identities. Songâs approach to his character is done with elegance, deep empathy, and subtlety as he surveys the residues of the war and colonial trauma promoting fear in individuals and the threat of losing his true self. DIRECTED BY: Kim Jee-woon. WRITTEN BY: Lee Ji-min, Park Jong-dae. WITH: Song Kang-ho, Gong Yoo, Han Ji-min. 2016. 140 min. South Korea. Color. Korean.

Inspired by a true story, The Attorney examines the period in which the governmentâs injustice and brutality were justified and many innocent individuals were victims of merciless violence. Song Kang- ho, who portrays Woo-seok, conscientiously weaves the elements of the character into a radicalized entity motivated by empathy and infuriated by injustice. DIRECTED BY: Yang Woo-seok.

Cooley Vocational High School. A brush with the law pivots this coming-of- age comedy into a shocking tragedy for a fully rounded portrait of Black life in the mid-1960s. Offering an alternative to the Blaxploitation fare that saturated the decade, Cooley Highâ s dense Motown soundtrack and rich mise - en - scène make it a classic of Black cinema, inspiring directors Spike Lee and John Singleton.

Just prior to the Democratic National Convention, impassive TV news cameraman John Cassellis (Robert Forster) learns his footage is being sold to the FBI in a flagrant abetting of civilian surveillance. This revelation kickstarts an awakening in an otherwise apolitical man. Massively influential cinematographer, producer, and director Haskell Wexlerâs (1922â2015) narrative feature directorial debut is one of the more visceral, urgent American pictures to emerge from the tense 1960s to address the countercultural movement of a frustrated generation. The unassuming masterpiece blends fiction with reality for a âhybridâ film that insists the personal is political. DIRECTED/WRITTEN BY: Haskell Wexler.

Jerseyâs Oscar-nominated film, A Time for Burning , takes a cinéma vérité approach to documenting the white, Omaha-based Augustana Lutheran Church, whose progressive pastor L. William Youngdahl preaches about integration in attempts to unite with a neighboring Black congregation. At the time, this cinematic experiment stoked so much controversy the project was nearly halted after protests from Nebraskan Lutheran leadership. A vital document underscoring the concept that âchange is hard,â this powerful film is also the very catalyst for change needed to showcase a movementâs potential.

Courtesy of Strand Releasing/Criterion Collection. Stranger Than Paradise in 35mm Mon, Jan 22 | 7:30pm | TMT Added to the National Film Registry in 2002. Jim Jarmuschâs sensational feature Stranger Than Paradise is a milestone in American independent cinema and beyond its categorical boundary. Perhaps drawing on his background in literature, Jarmuschâs cinematic vision is realized through a rhythm similar to that of literary composition. The groundbreaking series of long takes of each scene resembles a prose-like structure, and the minimal, nuanced character composition is portrayed in a poetic direction. This masterpiece, centering around three young characters on an irresponsible, impulsive road trip to escape the mundane, put Jarmusch on the map as one of the most influential American independent filmmakers and reinvented the cinematic language of cool.

Naturally, we see our fears reflected in cinema, especially in the case of the so-called âdisaster film.â In 1989, the Los Angeles Times predicted âglobal warming [was] expected to be the hot issue of [the] 1990s,â and an anxious Hollywood responded with relentless tornados and angry eruptions. And, in proximity to the wake-up call of An Inconvenient Truth (2006), the climate crisis was in the subconscious of many filmmakers in the 2000s and beyond. In considering natural disaster films and the scientists who intervene within them, we can use cinema to envision a world in which humans can harness the elements, tame nature, and save the day. Yet, as real-world climate science has proven time and again, most of these imaginative interventions are too little, too late, and only collective science-based action by government, industry, and civil society can ensure our survival. This screening series considers natural disasters through our planetâs primary elementsâearth, wind, water, and fireâand seeks to highlight key moments in the history of the disaster film genre as a source of entertainment, and as a tool to raise our collective consciousness about science-based solutions to the mounting global climate crisis.
