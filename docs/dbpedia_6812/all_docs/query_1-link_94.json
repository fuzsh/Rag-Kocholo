Lapinski, author of THE STRANGEWORLDS TRAVEL AGENCY Bea's family are happy. Like, really happy. Like, kind of gross but also cute happy. So when they visit London Pride together and have the ultimate day out, Bea doesn't think her family could possibly get any happier. But a year later, a grey cloud is following Bea's family around. Dad has passed away, and without him around they have no choice but to pack their bags and move to the countryside to live with Gran. With Bea's big sister, Riley, taking the news hard, Bea will do anything to cheer her up. So with the help of new friends, The Secret Sunshine Project is formed - Bea's plan to bring Pride to the countryside and a smile back to Riley's face.
