        "text": "Fire, grit and powerful visuals fuel one of the first Korean Noir films…\n\nTwo very important films were released in 1997, that changed the face of Asian cinema. One was Fruit Chan’s hyperrealistic masterpiece Made In Hong Kong, the other heralded a new style for South Korean film, Lee Chang Dong’s Green Fish. Ostensibly a raw Gangster tale, the film is cited as one of the first in the Korean Noir genre made famous by films such as Kim Jee-woon’s A Bittersweet Life. A strong narrative drive, powerful visuals and a mind-blowing central performance make Green Fish a superb watch, despite some issues with peripheral characters.\n\nThe film begins in beautifully surreal fashion with the protagonist Makdong (Han Suk-kyu, A Bittersweet Life, The Prison) riding on a train back to his hometown after Military service. He encounters a beautiful girl Mi ae (Shim Hye-jin, Festival, Over The Border) and is beaten up by the thugs who were hassling her. They encounter each other again, when Makdong becomes embroiled in a gang set up, run by Bae Tae-gon (Mun Seong Kuo, Public Enemy 3, Missing) as she is Bae’s mistress. Soon Makdong rises up the ranks and makes many enemies, while still maintaining a very innocent, naive personality.\n\nAs a debut film, the utter strength of conviction and confidence in filmmaking shown by Lee Chang-dong is miraculous. He doesn’t make many movies, but when he does boy do they make a mark on the public consciousness. What struck me most about Green Fish is it’s aesthetic; from the dream-like opening to the iconic phone booth scene, there is some gorgeous lighting, framing and editing, while the film has a distinct gritty and raw approach. This is especially evident in the treatment of violence. Far removed from its forebears like the touchstone for Korean Noir, John Woo’s The Killer, the scraps here are just that: scrappy. Being a Korean Noir film there is some extreme violence, and the visuals are noticeably 90’s, but look forward to the more opulent works of Kim Jee Woon. I also found it interesting that the soundtrack is so much like 90’s Hong Kong cinema it is almost derivative. This would be a fault in the film were it not for the originality of every other aspect, and the diversity of music used throughout.\n\nWhat set Green Fish apart from Gangster tales at the time was the concentration on the family unit, and unique characterisation. Makdong is a fish out of water in the gangster world, as he is so innocent and truly cares about his family back home. The many layers of his character are brilliant realised; with his fearlessness in scenes such as when he breaks a bottle over his head in a confrontation with some thugs, to a family picnic gone awry wherein he drives his car around the squabbling siblings, trying to rein them in. This truly brilliant performance by Han Suk-kyu ranks high amongst the best in all Asian cinema.\n\nThere is strong support, and it’s a kick to see a very young Song Kang-ho as an obnoxious gangster. However, a lot of the characters have no room to develop, especially Makdong’s family. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of director Lee, so that Makdong’s arc is a solo one. Certainly, as a character study, the film works just as well as a Korean Noir.\n\nI really want to give Green Fish 5 stars. It’s a classic in every way. Just that little niggle about the supporting characters for me lets the film down. Don’t let that put you off watching this groundbreaking movie, one that lingers long in the memory."
