        "text": "Cold Weather Dir: Aaron Katz Rating: 3.0/5.0 IFC Films 96 Minutes Aaron Katz’ understated, passive mystery film, Cold Weather, is a story about the lonely struggles of a waffler in a world that is more than happy to leave people who waffle behind. Having just moved back to Portland with his sister, Gail (Trieste Kelly Dunn), former forensic science student …\n\nHow I Ended This Summer Dir: Aleksei Popogrebsky Rating: 3.3/5.0 Film Movement 124 Minutes How I Ended This Summer primarily features two characters, the only inhabitants of an isolated weather station on a Russian-controlled island in frigid northern waters. Sergei (Sergei Puskepalis) is the old hand, a straightforward worker who documents and reports data with an emotionless rigor. Pavel (Grigory …\n\nRevisit: Broadcast News Dir: James L. Brooks 1987 Revisit is a series of reviews highlighting past releases that now deserve a second look. It’s easy to forget that William Hurt, now one of Hollywood’s preeminent character actors, was a leading man. But for a golden run in the ’80s, Hurt starred in a string of high profile films from Altered …\n\nLemmy Dir: Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski Rating: 3.0/5.0 E1 Entertainment 116 Minutes A confession: I think Motörhead is overrated. But before any dedicated heavy metal fans start questioning the wisdom of such a nerd as me review a film dedicated to the main man behind the band, let me amend that shameful opinion: Motörhead is overrated, but Lemmy is …\n\nRage Dir: Sebastián Cordero Rating: 2.0/5.0 Strand Releasing 89 Minutes Rage is kind of a baffling film. You can feel the drive that led to its creation pulsing behind its every moment, the film is not uninvested in itself, but it is utterly without impact, a dull wash of story and incident that manages to create absolutely no feeling within …\n\nSanctum Dir: Alister Grierson Rating: 3.3/5.0 Universal Pictures 109 Minutes With any James Cameron production, directed by him or otherwise, you can expect some of the director’s major thematic concerns, namely underwater exploration and technically challenging productions. Sanctum feels like a result of Cameron’s interests but lies the middle of an unlikely Venn diagram where the spheres include “low-key disaster …\n\nAmerican Grindhouse Dir: Elijah Drenner Rating: 4.0/5.0 Lorber Films 89 Minutes There were no exploitation films before the advent of the production code, notes one commentator in American Grindhouse, the implication being that for this kind of entertainment to exist, it needs to be rebelling against something. For the movie industry, that first came in the form of Congress’s notorious …\n\nInto Eternity Dir: Michael Madsen Rating: 4.4/5.0 International Film Circuit 75 Minutes Machine with Concrete, by the artist Arthur Ganson, is a mechanical sculpture that consists of a motor and a series of gear assemblages mounted on a wooden base. The gears are connected in such a way so that each successive pair reduces the speed of the previous set …\n\nAnother Year Dir: Mike Leigh Rating: 3.7/5.0 Sony Pictures Classics 129 Minutes Another Year is a chronicle revolving around Gerri and Tom (Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent), a married couple who live in a nice London house, have a nice, grown-up son and enjoy getting their vegetables from a nice community garden on the weekends. It’s just everyone else around …\n\nBiutiful Dir: Alejandro González Iñárritu Rating: 3.0/5.0 Roadside Attractions 148 Minutes Unlike his cohorts Alfonso Cuarón and Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro González Iñárritu has yet to make an out-and-out Hollywood blockbuster. Yes, he’s working with actors such as Sean Penn and Brad Pitt since breaking out with his indie hit Amores Perros, but 21 Grams and Babel are nothing compared …"
