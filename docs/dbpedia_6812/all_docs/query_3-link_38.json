After studying Korean Literature at Kyungpook National University, which laid a foundational cornerstone for his later career as a filmmaker, the creative mastermind turned to fiction writing.

Since then, Lee has directed various critically acclaimed films, including “Peppermint Candy,” “Secret Sunshine,” and “Poetry,” which pocketed the Best Screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010.\n\nLee is celebrated for his ability to portray complex themes and explore insightful social commentary. He has a unique gift for illuminating the struggles of everyday people, making his films universally relatable.\n\nApart from his film career, Lee has also served as the Minister of Culture and Tourism in South Korea from 2003 to 2004, further cementing his passion for promoting arts and culture.\n\nWith numerous accolades and acclaimed works to his name, Lee Chang-dong remains a towering figure in the Korean film industry and a highly respected figure in the global filmmaking community."
