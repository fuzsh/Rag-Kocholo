        "text": "Held from April 28 to May 7, the Jeonju International Film Festival will return with its first physical edition since the pandemic began. Over ten days, the 23rd edition of the festival will screen 217 films from 56 countries. The festival’s opening film is After Yang by Kogonada, which had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival last year and North American premiere at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe festival will also hold a retrospective of Lee Chang-dong’s works, screening eight titles. This will include the prolific filmmaker’s Cannes FIPRESCI prize-winner Burning (2018) and Best Screenplay winner Poetry (2010), alongside Green Fish (1997), Peppermint Candy (1999), Oasis (2002) and Secret Sunshine (2007). The festival will also play host to the world premiere of Lee’s new short film Heartbeat (2022). The digital remastering of Green Fish and Oasis will screen in 4K for the first time at the festival.\n\nThe festival also revealed guest programmer Yeon Sang-ho, who directed the global hit Train To Busan (2016). He was asked to choose two of his own films and three others to show in the line-up. The programme includes Yeon’s The King Of Pigs (2011) and Train To Busan (2016), alongside David Lynch’s Blue Velvet (1986), Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s Cure (1997) and Shinzo Katayama’s Missing (2021).\n\nThe Jeonju International Film Festival received a record number of submissions across its three main sections. The Korean Competition spotlights a director’s first or second film; the Korean Competition for Shorts introduces short films; the Local Cinema category showcases productions from North Jeolla Province. This year, the festival received 124 Korean Competition submissions, 1,169 Korean Competition for Shorts submissions, and 37 Local Cinema submissions.\n\n“It is really encouraging that the number of Korean submissions reached a record high,” festival programmer Moon Seok said in a statement. “Film production is in a difficult place due to the prolonged pandemic, but Korean filmmakers have continued to create in various ways while searching for breakthroughs.”\n\nThe festival will hold a lab providing mentorship to professionals in the development stage for their film and video projects. It will also run the Jeonju Cinema Project, a pitching program to support domestic and international feature works. Winning projects will receive a maximum budget of KRW 100 million (around US$90,900) and have its world premiere at the Jeonju International Film Festival after completion."
