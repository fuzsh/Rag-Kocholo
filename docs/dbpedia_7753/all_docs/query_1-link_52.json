        "text": "Last year, the age of COVID. From Christmas until last week we stayed home. We survived. We ate out quite a bit, first take out, then outside, finally a few times inside. We walked, read, gardened, cooked, took a few local drives. Did most of our shopping at farmer’s markets, farms, speciality food stores. During most of the cold we built an afternoon fire.\n\nOur first COVID trip was pre-cape stop in Essex CT then on to Orleans, MA on Cape Cod. Fantastic. The two nights in Essex was to break up driving. It was a perfect stop and will go back to the Griswold Inn on the way home. This is our sixth year at Peck’s Way on Ayers Pond in Orleans with the Kwait’s. There were also three years on Pilgrim Pond and a year on the bay marshes. Diane and I also stayed at several Inns in the area on our way to Nantucket. She recently said Nauset Inn was among our best B and B stays. Just up route 28 is Waquessett Resort and Golf Club, not our typical stay but an experience we tried one year. My first memory of Orleans is arriving in Orleans Center from the Cape Cod Bike Trail. I even remember Mahoney’s. Maybe we ate there. We would have been staying in an Inn on route 6A. We know the area well.\n\nOur Cape days start slow. I get up at six and put the morning routines to bed. By 7 or 7:30 I’m sitting on my living room chair with a cup of coffee, looking out the picture window or at the table on the screened in porch, facing the pond. The image sitting in that chair with coffee, wine, book, is one of my daydreams that help me get to sleep.\n\nThere is usually a little boat activity on the pond. Sailboats heading out to or returning from Pleasant Bay. A rare motor boat. Kayaks. In a good wind I love the sound of halyards on the masts. A seal passes through. Several osprey fish and inhabit the trees around the house. We see a few squirrels and chipmunks. Toads are fairly common. We haven’t put up a feeder this year but when we do there are a variety of small birds. This year we only hear them in the trees. Surprisingly there are fewer insect noises than at home in Yardley.\n\nIn front of the porch is a table and white plastic chairs. Closer to the pond is an old picnic table. When the sun is set or setting they are nice places to sit, a clearer view of the pond through the trees, a vodka tonic, glass of wine or beer, maybe a cool breeze, a faint marsh smell. The pond ripples in the breeze or can be a flat sheet of glass.\n\nMost days or evenings we spend some time at a beach. We tend to avoid Skaket (Orleans main bay beach) and Nauset (the ocean beach). There is a parking fee and a lot of people. So far this week we’ve sat on the inlet at the end of Tonset Road. There are several other town landings — Snow, Mill Pond, Doane and Priscilla. Unfortunately Doane and Priscilla now have beach permit signs. We ignored them. We spent several days on Pleasant Bay off route 28. We’ve been to Rock Harbor to sit on the Dyer Prince Road beach, to watch the sunset and buy clam chowder from Young’s. Pilgrim Lake is just up the road, good for kid swimming. We rented there for three years. And Wiley Park on Great Pond is another kid swim area. There are other beaches we frequent; “First Encounter” on the bay where the Pilgrims and natives first made contact; Wellfleet beaches and the National Seashore. Some years we’ve gone to Race Point or other beaches near Provincetown.\n\nThere are walks. Off our driveway is a short pond side trail. Kent Point is a forest/ beach walk not far from the house. Fort Hill is a favorite in the National Seashore. In Wellfleet there is the Great Island Trail. Wellfleet and Chatham are shopping walks. Art galleries, boutiques, craft shops and restaurants. Some years we go to Provincetown, probably not this year with the COVID outbreak. Route 6A also provides a lot of craft and antique shopping. Many years Diane and I have done a pottery tour. There are a few shops in Orleans, the Sea Howl bookshop is one of the few that interest me.\n\nFood. Seafood. Delicious seafood. In town there is the Nauset Fish Market and the Orleans Seafood Market. We also go to the Chatham Fish Market and Hatch’s and Mac’s Seafood in Wellfleet. All are good; Hatch’s is a favorite. We cook in, do take-out and eat in restaurants. This week we’ve had Cod, fried oysters, shrimp, lobster roll, steamed clams, clam chowder (Young’s is delicious), scallops, seafood pies from Marian’s in Chatham and bluefish pate. Who knows what week two’s catch will be? We usually have a full lobster dinner. Corn and some other fresh vegetables come from a small farm or farm stand and we bring lots of tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant and peppers from our Yardley garden. I avoid supermarkets but don’t mind Nauset Market (milk, bread, cheeses, crackers; mostly staples, a few surprises). And there is an Orleans Whole Food Store. Some years Diane and I have explored some other farm markets on route 6A. We’ve also been to Orleans Hog Island Brewery and Truro’s Vineyards of Cape Cod.\n\nIn Orleans we do take out from Sir Cricket or Cooke’s Seafood. And locally we’ve eaten in Land Ho, Yardarm and Beacon Room. But usually we go out of town. Wellfleet has Mac’s Shack (popular, hard to get reservations), Wicked Oyster, the Bookstore, and The Pearl on the docks, an annual stop. Blackfish in Truro was trendy. Marshside in Dennis was a nice birthday dinner one year. In Chatham we liked the Impudent Oyster and this year looking at Pisces. The Sesuit Harbor Cafe is good for lunch; Oysterville Fish Too is a great find on Barnstable Harbor. In Provincetown we’ve eaten in the Lobster Pot and . . . There are many other restaurants I’ve forgotten.\n\nThis end of week one, we awaited hurricane Henri. The track changed and it’s further west. Sunday we had some morning rain and wind but not a direct hit. Kwait’s are scheduled for a Vinyard trip Monday/Tuesday, I think they will be OK. So ends our first week of the 2021 season.\n\nI have Maine on my mind. I recently read, “Maine Farm: a year of country living” by Stanley Joseph and Lynn Karlin. In the 1980s, they bought Helen and Scott Nearing’s original farm house and garden in Harborside, Maine. The book was a gift from Dave Sears who lives summers, with his wife Judy, on Matinicus Island, Maine. The book led me to find a Nearing DVD I sometimes used in class, “Living the Good Life” — Bullfrog Films, 1976. It’s still available for $59. One reviewer wrote, “His laugh and her singing make it magic.” It brought back many memories from our visit in the early 1970 (recalled in a previous blog, “Down the Atlantic Coast”).\n\nA few weeks ago, Melody and Garret Bonnema from Bethel, Maine visited us in Yardley. They moved to Maine from Bristol in the early 70s and opened a pottery studio. This visit they delivered several pottery pieces we had ordered as a wedding gift for Libby Paglione and Steve Vedder. It’s been years since we have seen the Bonnemas.\n\nLast week we drove to Rockland Maine and spent a night at The Ledges — a great motel overlooking the bay. Next morning, we bought ferry tickets to Matinicus. We were off to visit David and Judy Sears who bought a house on the island following retirement. Diane and Dave taught together back in the beginning. While waiting for the ferry, We met Martha Trower, from Chebeague Island just north of Portland. Amazing, she knew the Nearings, had taught at Gould Academy and knew the Bonnema’s, and knew David and Judy Sears from previous trips to Matinicus. Together we reflected on Maine — it’s amazing mix of traditional and hip cultures.\n\nMaine on my mind.\n\nOur first trip to Maine was about 1973. We were living on Old York Road in New Hope with Barbara and John Paglione. Although Diane and I were teachers and John worked in a Trenton hospital, our lifestyle reflected the “back to the earth movement.” Not really a commune but we sometimes referred to our arrangement as an “intentional community.” Summers John and I worked on two Pineville farms owned by the Daniel brothers. Barbara and Diane worked in Japan Artisans, a great and missed New Hope shop.\n\nWe had a large garden, put up corn, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Made preserves, condiments, bread, most of our beer (very crude) and wine. We all cooked and rotated house chores. We discovered Helen and Scott Nearing through “The Maple Sugar Book” and “Living the Good Life.” I wrote the Nearings asking if we could visit. We invited my father to join us and were offered to use a “plexiglas cabin” Bill Lynn from Bristol was building on a small piece of Maine real estate. (Bill worked for Rohm and Hass and the plexiglas was scrap.)\n\nIn the 1930s the Nearings had begun homesteading in Verment. Scott, an Economist, had been fired from the University of Pennsylvania and another college for socialism. Helen, some years younger, could have had a career as a concert pianist. In Vermont, maple syrup was their cash crop. By 1952, the ski industry was taking over Vermont, the Nearings moved to Maine.\n\nThey bought a farm on the Blue Hill peninsula south of Mount Desert Island, Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor. Their property was in Harborside, on a small cove off Penobscot Bay. In the 1960s, the country was being introduced to a new youth culture, alternative life styles, back to the earth, eastern mysticism, gardening, communal living, hand crafts, flower power, and in media language — “hippies.” The Nearings were quickly becoming the “gurus” of homesteading.\n\nWe left Yardley in two aging VW bugs (one red; the other black), spent the night at Lynn’s “A” frame, just enough room for 5 sleeping bags. The next day, headed to Harborside. It had become a “Mecca.” Our invitation to visit Forest Farm wasn’t necessary, visitors showed up every day. Helen and Scott sat outside their frame farm house, mending netting they put over their blueberry bushes. The berries had replaced maple sugar as a cash crop. Several “in” people sat with them. Although they had a bowel of grain for lunch, we weren’t offered any although I read that sometimes visitors were invited to lunch. Some stayed for days, camping on the property and helping with farm chores.\n\nThat afternoon we helped Scott cut up some sapling size wood for heating, “warms you twice,” he said with a twinkle in his eye,”when you cut it and when you burn it.” Later we headed in a pick up truck to Orr cove to collect seaweed to fertilize the garden. The Nearings grew most of their food in a stone walled garden. They were vegetarians, “we don’t believe in enslaving animals or people,” Helen explained.\n\nThey took us on a farm tour. Quite proud of a new stone house they were building (Helen taped a rock, “it’s solid, strong). At the time Scott was 90; Helen was in her 70s. Scott lived until 1983; he was 100. Helen continued to live in the stone house; she died in 1995, 91 years old. After Scott’s death, Helen sold the frame house and some of the property to Stanley Joseph and Lynn Karlin, authors of “Maine Farm” mentioned in the beginning of this blog.\n\nNearing stone house — today the Good Life Center\n\nAs evening approached we said goodby to Helen and Scott. Scott had been extremely open, friendly, constantly offering funny aphorisms, “Pay as you go.” No borrowing or credit cards for Scott. In contrast, Helen seemed a bit sour, maybe tired of the constant visitor stream. They suggested we stop to meet their neighbor, Eliot Coleman, who was establishing (much to the amusement of regular Maine farmers) an organic farm. Eliot was working in the garden when we arrived — raised beds of rich soil, lush with vegetables. On our trip to Matinicus, Dave Sears gave me a copy of “This is in Your Hands: one dream, sixty acres, and a family undone” by Melissa Coleman, Eliot’s daughter. On the to-read list with several other Maine books.\n\nStanley and Lynn and Eliot were not the only homesteaders that followed in the Nearings footsteps. A few bought land from them in Harborside. Jean Hay Bright, wrote “Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life.” She wasn’t always complimentary to the Nearings. The Nearings may have lead thousands of others, “hippies and homesteaders” that flocked to Maine in the 1960-1970s.\n\nI recently discovered a Bangor Times slide show, “The Good Life.” It had five chapters — Seed, Root, Bloom, Harvest, Preserve. They wrote “Sixty years ago Scott and Helen Nearing inspired a movement that changed Maine forever.” Today the Good Life Center, at Forest Farm, in the Nearing stone house, promotes the self-sufficiency, basic life style in tune with nature and community, the message Scott and Helen lived and wrote about. The original frame house can be rented. Maybe a Paglione-Profy Maine reunion.\n\nOur next trip to Maine was in 1975. Melody Bonnema had gone to Pratt in NYC with Barbara Paglione. After college she studied with an established potter, Toshiko Takaezu. Melody opened a studio in Bristol with her husband Garett, who would leave teaching to become a potter. The Bonnemas were part of the movement of homesteaders and craft artists discovering Maine. They bought a large Victorian with an attached barn on Main Street in Bethel. The town was picturesque but not a major tourist stop. There was an Inn across the street and National Training Laboratory (NTL) was headquartered in town. NTL was known for its T group training that sought to improve interpersonal relationships and communication skills — very 1960s. Gould Academy was also located in town. So in the 70s, there was a small flow of outsiders through town. That would grow when Sunday River Ski resort was developed.\n\nWe moved in with the Bonnemas their first summer in Maine. I did some carpentry work in the barn and the building of display shelves for craft fairs. Diane worked with Melody, actually learning to throw her signature minature hanging pots. We traveled with them to several craft fairs. It was pretty clear we weren’t in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, or the East Coast corridor any more. Maine was different.\n\nAlthough Bonnemas worked hard, there was a flowing, rhythmic pace. Lots of friends visited and I remember Melody (like the Nearings) explaining, “Today is a working day.” But tomorrow . . . I think we hiked in the Maine White Mountains at least twice, or three times a week. Usually the Presidential range — Jefferson was a favorite because a road took us far enough up, that above tree line was reached with minimal effort. There were also hikes through local forests — I remember feeling lost on one hike. No houses, no roads, no signs of civilization. We eventually emerged.\n\nThe sense of community was amazing. And it was made up of locals, born in Maine, heating the house with saw dust types, and the migrants moving in. Somebody needed to move a piano, a group got together one afternoon, moved the piano, cracked open cans of beer or Boones Farm Apple, guitars came out, and there was a jam. I think his name was Douglas, was building a log cabin outside of town. Could we help? So for a day here or there we lifted logs, forming the cabin walls. Saw my first Moose on one of these cabin building days.\n\nWe became regulars at some businesses in town. There was a small coffee shop, Bonnemas like Sunday morning breakfast out. The hardware store-lumber supply was a frequent visit, “Charge it to the Bonnemas.” Then there was the small grocery where we bought milk and eggs and Boones Farm. We learned that firewood was important, there was a wood stove (we learned about Vermont Castings) in the kitchen, some of that heat seeped upstairs (needed in the winter).\n\nIn the Bethel area in the early 1970s, there weren’t any organic farms or farmers markets, arugula, heirloom tomatoes, artisan bread or craft beer. I don’t remember any craft artists except the Bonnemas. Since then it changed with the new Maine.\n\nWhen we went to Bethel in 1975, I thought I would write. But except for my daily journal, I didn’t write. In August I saw an ad for a photographic workshop in Rockport. I could save my artistic honor. Photography not writing. The Maine Photographic Workshops were new. Dave Lyman’s inspiration; professional photographers, talented students and a utopian setting. We took a sailboat to a small island and spent a week photographing on 35 mm ecktachrome (it could be self developed). The instructor, Bruce Curtsinger, a National Geographic contract photographer, opened my eyes to light and composition. Particularly composition. He taught the traditional rules but pushed us to go beyond the accepted. Sunrise, sunset, ocean calm and ocean waves, seaweed and rock and rock. Wide angle (Bruce lent us an 18 mm lens), close up. Color, light, pattern, texture, repetition.\n\nThe next year I returned to the Maine Photographic Workshops to take a course with Ernst Haas — color and color, “Keep your finger off the shutter until you know you want the shot.” Bruce Dale, “You need to shoot people.” Both were great experiences influencing my life and photography.\n\nDiane and I have traveled in Maine a number of other times. I remember driving up the coast, stopping at a roadside stand and having my first lobster, corn , maybe a baked potatoe. Lobster never made it to Bristol when I was growing up. Delicious. I remember horse back riding in Arcadia National Park. And I have mental images of coastal towns, Kennybunk, Wiscasset, Damariscotta, Friendship, and Tenants Harbor. One year when Jenny was about 8, we spent a week in Searsport.\n\nWe returned to the Blue Hill pensiula several years back when the Kwait Brothers were playing at the Blue Hill festival. Jenny and Rob with a young Eli camped; Diane and I stayed in a B and B. One afternoon we took a driving tour and in the Brooksville historical society saw a sign “Condon’s.” Diane recognized it immediately, from children’s author, Robert McCloskey’s (“Make Room for Ducklings” fame), “One Morning in Maine.” Our guide in the small museum said, “Drive down the road and you’ll be there.” Within minutes we were in Buck’s Harbor with Condon’s Garage and store just as they are illustrated in the book. McCloskey has a home on a small island in Penobscot Bay.\n\nI don’t think we realized we were in Nearing territory until we noticed a mail box, “Nearing.” We drove up to the stone house but everyone from the Good Life Center were off to the Blue Hill festival. We drove next door to Eliot Coleman’s Four Season Farm. We talked to some interns, “Yes, Eliot still lives here.” As we toured the farm and small market stand, I noticed someone coming out of the farm house. It was Coleman and I couldn’t resist stopping him and relating how we’d met 30 years earlier. Today Coleman is the go-to spokesman when something is happening in the organic farming movement.\n\nTwo years ago we planned a September trip to visit David and Judy Sears on Matinicus. Dave required surgery and the trip was cancelled. We had credit at the Percy Inn in Portland, so in April 2015 we took a trip to Concord, MA and Portland, ME. Downtown, historic Portland reflects the “hip” culture that migrated to Maine in the 1960-70s. Waterfront properties with boutique shops and a lively food scene. Unfortunately we couldn’t get reservations at Eventide Oysters — the hot oyster bar — ended up next door at Hugo’s, one of Portland’s first national known restaurants. There was an expensive, if interesting price fixe tasting menu. Another evening we ate at Street and Company, a favorite for us and discovered lunch at the dive bar J’s Oyster on the waterfront.\n\nLast year we again planned a September trip to Matinicus. This time I ended up in the hospital and my surgeries lasted for months. This year Dave emailed encouraging us to visit in September, 2016. I was determined to make the trip.\n\nOn September 7 we left for Rockland. It’s a long drive but the day was cool and clear. We held off lunch until Kittery, just over the border between Maine and New Hampshire. We had discovered Young’s Maine Grill on the Portland trip. Deceptively simple, it’s a great seafood stop on the bay. Instead of lobster rolls (you know your in Maine) we had oyster rolls. Crispy batter; juicy, tasty oysters, with an Allagash White — there was a case in the car headed to Matinicus.\n\nFor part of the trip up the coast, we drive Route 1. Although it has its share of tacky motels, chain restaurants, and other tourist attractions, it’s spotted with unique Maine establishments, true craftsmen, potters, woodworkers, iron workers. There are farm stands and mom and pop (several generations) restaurants. Some of the cabin- motels from the 40s and 50s even have an appeal.\n\nIn Rockland, Dave and Judy recommended The Ledges. Our second floor motel style room had a beautiful view of the bay. No need for a B and B. We had reservations at Primo, described as “the ultimate farm to table experience.” It’s claimed the chef, Melissa Kelly, started with a garden, a few hens, and a couple of pigs. Wednesday night in September, the place was packed. Our 7 o’ clock reservation was pushed to 7:30, so we had a drink at the bar. Knowing I would have plenty of seafood in the coming days, I ordered a signature dish, Pork Saltimbocca. It was quite good. Diane had a lobster Ravoli which she felt was lacking. The drinks, beet salad, dessert, homemade limoncello were good but overpriced. But the fact that Primo exists and succeeds is a testament to the organic pioneers of the 1970s.\n\nThe next morning we did some last minute food shopping. Judy wanted several quarts of homemade yogurt from a health food market. We purchased donuts from a recommended bakery. The ferry only runs to Matinicus three times a month. And it was out of service for our trip. We were taking the “island transporter.” Basically a work boat, capable of carrying several vehicles and twenty-three passengers. We were told to get there early. We waited; met Martha; and watched the stream of passengers for Vinal Haven, then Matinicus. There were family types, older couples, young couples and a few in pick ups, tattoos, and dangling cigarettes, that I couldn’t help stereo-typing as Trump supporters. How will Maine vote? On board, there were six plastic seats for passengers in a large closet space.\n\nSeas were calm. Matinicus is 23 miles out. It’s a two hour trip. Fog was fairly heavy at times. In comparison, Nantucket, our summer destination for years, is about 30 miles out. We arrived at Matinicus harbor in a light mist. There were half dozen high piers with a fishing shacks where traps are stored and a stern man may live above. The main pier was crowded with people and trucks.\n\nDave and Judy loaded our bags in their truck and gave us an island tour. It’s about 2 miles by 1 mile. Maybe 125 residents in summer; 25 in winter. There are no stores or restaurants. The school has 3 students. There is a non-denominational church, town hall, post office, playground, cemetery, airport, recycling station and a new library. Until recently the library building was a “house of the rising sun” across the street from the Sears. They bought the property and donated the building to the town.\n\nDave and Judy rented on Matinicus for years. When they retired they decided to buy. Their house has been renovated, furnished with antiques. Beautiful. Dave began painting and with some inheritance built a studio. They have a big productive garden — if you want fresh vegetables, you grow them. There are also berry bushes and crab apple trees.\n\nFive o’clock, wine glass in hand, there is a knock at the door. A young fisherman, just off his boat is delivering lobsters (8) and crabs (5). With corn from Bucks County and tomatoes from the garden, we had a delicious meal. Leftover lobster and crabs were the basis of a Maine chowder, Judy made for day two. Reality check: Sears rarely eat lobster and at a recent island picnic there was a basket of cooked lobsters; no one ate them.\n\nIn the next two days, we walked a trail to a typically Maine rocky coast; another walk to Condon Cove with the ocean rounded granite stones that are the inspiration for some of Dave’s paintings. We also explored a beautiful sandy beach, not typical of Maine, one of two on the island. We went to the harbor and watched a few boats coming and going; similarly, at the airport, a plane landed and took off with two passengers.\n\nLife on Matinicus is slow, measured. It’s very different from life on the mainland. Dave constantly suggests that if you live here you must contribute to the island. It may be keeping one of the walking paths cleared or volunteering at the recycling station. It’s small town. Everyone keeps in touch. As we drove around the island, we ocassionally stopped to talk — small talk — who is off island? Whose relatives are visiting? Is someone back “fishing?”\n\n“Fishing” is used for lobstering. No one on Matinicus fishes for fish. They fish for lobsters. It’s hard work. There are regulations on size, number of traps, and where someone with a license can put their traps. There is a line for instance between Mantinicus and Vinal Haven, a larger nearby island. It’s important to keep your traps on your side of the line. If not someone from the other island might cut you lines, losing not just lobsters but expensive traps and line. But it happens and lobstermen have known to get rough. There is no police force on Mantinicus, so island standards of behavior and cooperation are regulated by the community. Punishment can be harsh, including banishment from the island. A few years ago there was a shooting on the town dock. “Don’t mess with my traps.”\n\nWith regulation, in recent years, lobster catches have been good. Some fisherman — families have fished for generations — make three figure salaries. They may have a house on the mainland for winter and take get aways in Rockland. Some even have a home in more southern, warmer shores. But they work hard for what many of us experience as the ultimate seafood.\n\nLife on Matinicus wouldn’t be for everyone. I don’t think I could live there most of the year, year after year, unless like Dave I was painting, writing or involved in some other art. Bo Bartlett, a painter, whose exhibition at PAFA became the background for Jenny and Rob’s wedding, has a house and studio on Matinicus. They recently bought a large Bartlett print and I have a copy of his new book for their anniversary.\n\nGo to : dsearsart.com for more of Dave’s paintings\n\nWhat I really like about Matinicus is the focus on basics. You are isolated from the usually hectic, over stimulating, sometimes depressing mainland life. Islanders sometimes refer to the mainland as “America.” It’s a different place. Everything you need must arrive by boat or plane. You are constrained by the weather. Some days the planes don’t fly; and the boats may remain in the harbor. Go with the flow. This trip we left one day early due to the weather forecast.\n\nI remember teenage dreamy talk about being able to sit on an deserted island (usually under a palm tree), enjoying the sun and waves, sipping a glass of cold lemonade. There was romance to Peter Pan, Robinson Crusoe, and the Swiss Family Robinson. Matinicus isn’t paradise but has some of those special qualities remembered from childhood.\n\nMaybe it’s the focus on basics, the time sitting on the beach, climbing on the rocks, listening to the surf, the sights and smells of the ocean, the seas, storms and calms. Maybe I would write more; or better. Maybe I would find the time to develop my photography — my personal Maine photographic workshop.\n\nOn Saturday we left Matinicus with Captain George who ferries passengers to Rockland. On the mainland, we bought some Cod and headed to the Sears new house in Cushing — about 10 miles from Rockland. It’s an 1990s house built by a carpenter — great woodwork — a basement studio for Dave, large open kitchen, dining room with a view of the river. A cosy escape from Matinicus in the winter. That’s not to say that Maine winters can’t be harsh but when you don’t need to commute to work, snowy, cold days can be spent in front of a fire, time for reading, writing and reflection, maybe painting, photography, or some craft production.\n\nI’m hoping we can spend more time in Maine (and Matinicus). I doubt we would move there. But I like viewing life through different lenses. Maine and Matinicus offer this. There are lessons that can be brought back to Bucks County. We may have missed our chance in the 1960-70s to be part of the exodus to Maine but have learned from our experiences there. Im keeping Maine on my mind.\n\nSo many writers come up with historic, geographic or cultural quests. Follow the trail taken by Lewis and Clark, visit all the sites associated with Henry David Thoreau, climb all the mountains in the Presidential range, drive Route 1 from Fort Kent, ME to Key West, walk the Applachian trail. I read one book where the writer visited the homes of famous people, collected and propagated seeds from the properties. His collection of trees was finally taken over by a non profit.\n\nMy best friend JP from Bristol, Pa set a goal to visit all the Bristols in the country; he also drank at 68 craft breweries, the year he turned 68. I believe he is currently visiting all the Presidential Libraries. To-date JP hasn’t written a book.\n\nLast week I re-read “The Coast: a journey down the Atlantic Shore” by Joseph Thorndike. He lived on Cape Cod and decided to walk around the shore of the Cape. But he failed, there were too many harbors, marshes and other breaks. He scaled back and retraced Thoreau’s trek along Great Beach in 1849. (I did read the journal of a guy who successfully navigated the coastline of Manhattan.) Then Thorndike decided to travel down the Atlantic Coast, ME to the Keys.\n\nAlthough I don’t think I’m going to follow Thorndike on the coastal tour or write a book, I thought it would be interesting to develop a wish list of places to visit along the coast and to recall those that are part of my experience. “Way down east,” Quoddy Head Light and Campobello Island (FDRs summer home) would be a places I would like to visit.\n\nWe’ve only gone as far as Arcadia National Park and Bar Harbor. Our first trip was in the 1970s and my strongest memory is horseback riding on one of the carriage roads built by Rockafeller. When he donated the land for a park he stipulated: no cars for so many years. The Park service has continued the policy. On our last trip we decided to take a carriage ride. Our driver mentioned that David Rockafeller still sometimes seen riding in a carriage. A little later, as if on cue, the driver announced, “And here’s David Rockefeller’s carriage. A guy riding on the back hopped off to steady the horses as the carriages passed; I quickly snapped a photograph of David, in his 90s, the last of his, the second generation.\n\nLike Newport and Palm Beach, Bar Harbor was founded as a summer resort for the wealthy. We have never been impressed with the town. We stopped and walked around several years ago but found few shops and no restaurants that interested us. That trip we were staying on the southern part of Mount Desert Island called Southwest Harbor (Bar Harbor in in the northern end of the Island.) it’s a quieter town, close to the Park, without the fading pretension of Bar Harbor.\n\nWe have special memories of the peninsula just south, Blue Hill. In the early 1970s after reading Helen and Scott Nearing’s “The Maple Sugar Book” and “Living the Good Life” I wrote them asking if we could visit. Scott had been an Economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, fired for socialist beliefs. In the 1930s Helen (a musician) and Scott bought land in Vermont to homestead. Maple sugar was their cash crop. When the ski industry exploded in the 60s they moved to Harborside on the Blue Hill peninsula. The Pagliones, my father, Diane and I drove up to visit them in the early 1970s. They had become gurus of the “back to the earth movement.” There were many visitors; few had written ahead.\n\nIn the early 70s, the Nearings were building a new stone house, gardening (vegetarians), raising blueberries as a small cash crop, and becoming an attraction in seashore Maine. The property next to theirs was being farmed by a young Eliot Coleman who would became a leading spokesman for the organic food movement. As we gathered seaweed for fertilizer and cut firewood, Scott encouraged us to visit Coleman. Visitors to the Nearings were sort of welcomed (don’t think Helen liked it a lot) but they were put to work. Some stayed for days; others bought nearby property. When we left we stopped to see Coleman’s organic farm.\n\nNearing House.\n\nAbout 7 years ago, my son-in-law’s band, Cabin Dogs, was invited to play at the Blue Hill Festival. They camped; Diane and I stayed in a B and B for several days. The Nearings were both dead (Scott was in his 90s when we visited) but their property and buildings they constructed with volunteer help were now The New Life Center. We walked around but the staff were all at the Festival. We did talk to them there. Such fond memories.\n\nWe also stopped next door and as we toured “Four Seasons” (Eliot Coleman and Barbara Damrosch’s farm), Eliot came out of the farmhouse. Much to Diane’s chagrin, I approached Eliot and told him about our visit in the 1970s when he was just getting started. I don’t think he was impressed but I was so pleased to renew with a place and individual that had influenced my life beliefs. At home I ordered a Coleman organic gardening book. I also discovered a book, “Living Next to the Good Life” by Jean Hay Bright. She and her husband had visited like us but ended up buying a piece of land from Helen and Scott. Her account of them is pretty critical at times.\n\nWe had other associations with Blue Hill.\n\n“One early fall morning in 1949, E.B. White walked into the barn of his farm in Maine and saw a spider web. That in itself was nothing new, but this web, with its elaborate loops and whorls that glistened with early morning dew, caught his attention. Weeks passed until one cold October evening when he noticed that the spider was spinning what turned out to be an egg sac. White never saw the spider again and, so, when he had to return later that fall to New York City to his job as a regular contributor to The New Yorker magazine, White took out a razor blade and cut the silken egg sac out of the web. He put the sac in an empty candy box, punched some holes in it, and absent-mindedly put the box atop his bedroom bureau in New York.”\n\nMichael Sims, the author of “The Story of Charlotte’s Web” reveals how that spider became the inspiration for a delightful children’s book. (See NPRs Maureen Corrigan’s, “How E.B. White spun Charlotte’s Web.”) For years White had a house, lived and wrote, in Brooklin, on Blue Hill Bay. It’s written that White didn’t like visitors.\n\nAs we drove around we stumbled on a local historical society; it was opened; staffed by a friendly local. We spent quite a bit of time looking at artifacts and talking with our guide when Diane noticed a sign, “Condon’s Garage.” Our new friend quickly informed us that it was the real sign and Bookesville was just down the road. We were off to check it out.\n\nOne of our favorite children’s authors, Robert McCloskey summered on an island off Blue Hill. Several of his books are set in Maine. In “One Morning in Maine” father and daughter, Sal, arrive by boat at Buck’s Harbor to go to Condon’s Garage. Sal who has lost a tooth in the morning enjoys a treat from a small store in the village before returning to their boat and home. Amazing seeing the source of McClosket’s drawings.\n\nMcCloskey’s wife and eldest daughter are models for the classic story “Blueberries for Sal.” And “A Time of Wonder” is another book set in Maine. McCloskey is most famous, however, for Caldicott winner, “Make Way for Ducklings” set in the Boston Public Gardens. Several years ago we bought Vivienne a Boston street artist’s drawing of the ducklings.\n\nWe did goto the Blue Hill festival. The Cabin Dogs were the last band to play. They got the crowd up and moving. A great evening.\n\nFurthur down the coast is Searsport. In the early 80s we rented a older, in need of repair house, across railroad tracks on a small spit of land overlooking Penobscot Bay. I recall raising a flag with Jen most mornings, walks, touring the local seaport museum, and drives exploring the rocky coast and other towns.\n\nMy real introduction to the Maine Coast came in 1974 when I did a week of photography at the Maine Photographic Workshops. They has been just established in Rockport by David Lyman. The workshop I attended was a bit of Outward Bound. We were given a sheet of plastic and showed how to construct a shelter in the wild. Sure! Our photography instructor was, Bill Curtsinger, a contract photographer with National Geographic. About 12 of us sailed with Bill and a ship’s Captain to an island where we established camp. Food was provided. The first night I tried to sleep under my plastic and a rock outcrop. It was very uncomfortable. The second and subsequent nights I slept on the sailboat after making friends with the Captain over a bottle of Hennessey’s Cognac.\n\nFor a week, Bill opened our eyes (certainly mine) to composition and light. Using ektagraphic slide film (we could develop this at labs in Rockport) we shot sunrise and sunset (bracketing), passing sail boats, shore lines, and each other. But most images were nature — rock formations, individual stones, trees, plants, sea shells, life in tidal pools, barnacles and birds. We used telephoto and wide angel lenses. I recall Bruce had an 18mm lens he shared. For geographic photographers, film was cheap. Shoot, shoot and shoot more. Bill wasn’t much older than me, in his late twenties. His speciality was underwater photography. Over meals and evening campfires we talked photography. Bill’s comment that he would only have so many shoots in his career has always stuck with me.\n\nAfter 5 days on the island, we returned to Rockport, rooms to sleep and eat in and labs to develop our film. The last day we sat around a slide projector, sharing and critiquing our work. It was quite an experience, so I returned to the Maine Photographic Workshops the following summer.\n\nIn 1975, I took two workshops. The first was with National Geographic staff photographer, Bruce Dale. The difference between staff and contract photographers is that staff photographers are paid a flat salary for all their work. Contract photographers retain rights to photographs not used by the magazine and are paid based on what is used. Interestingly according to Curtsinger/Dale photographers at Geographic headquarters got the basement; writers were upstairs. Bruce looked at my portfolio and said I needed to learn to photograph people. So I did. I spent several days in Rockland on the street, photographing people.\n\nMy next workshop with Ernst Haas presented different challenges. The first full day, we sat in a studio and discussed color. Haas said there should be a nail at the shutter — push when you know it is a photo you really need to take. So different from the National Geographic philosophy, shoot, shoot, shoot. One morning, with Haas we went early morning to a typical rural Maine fair. Carnival attractions, live stock, and people filled our frames. Focus, light and color. Forty years later the Maine Photographic Workshops offer college credit, video, digital, and a colorful catalog of courses. I suspect I experienced its most exciting years.\n\nAt least one year we took a sail out of Rockland. Only a day trip but I’m adding to my new to-do list a Maine Windjammer cruise. On day trips along the coast, we passed through or visited Friendship, Damariscotta, Wiscasset, and other coastal towns. I always liked those with fishing or lobstering fleets.\n\nPortland. Spent several overnights there, on our way north or as a destination. The harbor area is gentrified — quaint shops and restaurants. On our last visit, a few years ago, I made reservations at Hugo’s. As we later learned Hugo’s was the first restaurant on Portland’s foodie map but now next door was the innovative and hip, Eventide Oyster Company. Unfortunately, we were stuck with our Hugo reservation and a price fixe menu; no openings at Eventide. The next night we ate at Street and Company — a known favorite. We’ve only been in Portland for two night visits. Not enough time to explore more than the historic harbor. We need to revisit.\n\nWe’ve driven Route 1 south of Boston to Portland many times. My first encounter with lobster was at a roadside stand — I don’t think I ever had it before that. Crabs maybe; not lobster. Delicious — fresh lobster, corn and baked potato — I was captured. But south of Portland, there was too much traffic, too much Route 1 landscape despite a touch of Maine. We need to do more exploring along the Maine coast and hopefully will visit friends who have a summer house on Matinicus island.\n\nFor now I’ll blog down coastal Massachusetts.\n\nMy first story takes place in Nantucket. It’s not Cape Cod but one of several off shore islands associated with the Cape. We vacationed there for over ten years until our rental cottage was sold for 2 million (well the land, not so much the cottage). That’s when we started to spend more time on the Cape. The story also seems quite appropriate in this election year.\n\n“During the summer, Nantucket harbor is filled with more than a thousand boats, doubtless many times what the whaling fleet was in its glory days. For an overnight stay (in the 90s) at the marina, a forty-foot boat pays $90, for a full season $10,000. On only one occasion has a yachtsman found the harbor inadequate. That was when Donald Trump learned that the channel, now dredged to seventeen feet, was too shallow for his Princess. Trump sailed away, I was told, promising to return the next summer with his own dredge. Before that could happen, however, Trump himself ran aground on financial shoals and the Princess was put up for sale.” From “The Coast” by Joseph Thorndike\n\nSince we started with a story about a Republican politician, I should share a story about a Democratic politician.\n\nElizabeth Warren Former Students Refuse Comment by Bill Carson\n\n(Mattapoisett Massachusetts)\n\nElizabeth Warren Former Students Refuse Comment\n\nImagine taking a college course and having Elizabeth Warren as your professor ? In hundreds of pictures in the news she always looks mad at the world ! It’s hard to picture Elizabeth Warren as a teacher with that plastic sardonic smile on her face.\n\nAre there any former students of Elizabeth Warren? Did she actually ever teach a college course? While teaching what did her students think of her teaching methods ? Did she mock her students and talk to them in a sarcastic way to put her students down ?\n\nThe professor had said recently with a scowl she has always been a teacher and worked hard at that job.\n\nIt has been reported that the professor won awards from her students.Who, What ,Where and When and How were these awards given to Elizabeth Warren ?\n\nWe need to hear from of the former students of the professor ! Why hasn’t Elizabeth brought a few students up to talk about the great job she did as a teacher ?\n\nJohn Kennedy is the President most associated with Cape Cod, walking on the beach, sailing, playing touch football on the lawn of the family compound in Hyannis. Here’s one tale.\n\nHYANNIS — John F. Kennedy learned he had won the tight 1960 presidential election at his summer home in Hyannis Port when, as the story goes, his 3-year-old daughter Caroline woke him up the morning after Election Day by saying, “Good morning, Mr. President.”\n\n1961 – John F. Kennedy became the 35th president of the United States and the youngest president ever elected. Hyannisport and Hyannis are put on the map and his family compound becomes a new haven for tourists. Tourism on Cape Cod increases by 40%\n\nIn my experience, Democrats are frequently associated with the Cape, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. The Clinton’s and the Obama’s have vacation on the Vineyard. I photographed Hillary in downtown Nantucket while Bill played golf. When John Kerry was running for President, I watched a woman driving a car with a “Heinz” license plate daily on a dirt road across the street from our rental house. There was construction work on a bay side house. Theresa Heinz Kerry had a house downtown. Could the Kerry’s be planning a summer White House out of town? I wrote her. She responded that it was someone on her staff using the car, the house wasn’t for the Kerry’s. I like to think if John won the election, we’d vacation across the street from the President.\n\nA more recent story. This time Hillary.\n\nWaveProvincetown Welcomes Hillary\n\nThere was a large flag with Hillary’s campaign logo of an H-with-an-arrow logo flying off a house in the West End. And way down at the private house where the event was held, there was a long line of people waiting to cash in on their donation and get into the tent to see Clinton in person.\n\nThe symbolism of her timing and the message of her visit seemed unmistakable.\n\nFlying the flag.\n\nFlying the flag.\n\n“It’s such a propitious time for her to be here, with the Supreme Court decision (in favor of gay marriage) just being released,” said Mark Wisneski of Provincetown and New York, as he was waiting in line. “She has an important voting base here in Provincetown.”\n\nWisneski said, “I doubt I’ll get close to her, but if I did I’d ask how will you work to move gay, lesbian and transgender rights forward.”\n\nHere is the remarkable thing: The odds-on favorite candidate for President of the United States Of America visited Provincetown, known as one of the top gay destinations in the world.\n\nPonder that for a moment.\n\nIt shouldn’t and should never have been ponder-able except for the fact that Provincetown is a really small town. It sure must be an important small town, huh?\n\nRichard Hanson of Provincetown said, “I think she is the first presidential candidate that ever showed any interest or pride in our community.”\n\nHillary“I think it’s great that she’s paying attention to this community and to issues of gay and lesbian equality,” said Adam Welch of New York. “It’s a political tactic for anyone. But it’s fantastic that she’s being bold.”\n\nAnd Joe Bolduc of Provincetown said, “As a gay man, I’m thankful that she’s coming to Provincetown. Provincetown is a great place for her to be.”\n\nThis blog started with Trump, so we will end with another Trump story. I’m not sure if he ever visited Cape Cod but he has spent time on Martha’s Vineyard. Once upon a time, not so long ago.\n\n“Back in the summer of 1988 while Donald Trump was publicly basking in the success of his book, The Art of the Deal, he quietly came to the Vineyard with a little known blonde model, and former Resaca Beach Poster Girl from Dalton, Ga., with whom he was having an extra-marital affair later dubbed “one of the biggest sex scandals of the 1990s that triggered the divorce of the century.”\n\nAt the time, rumors of his “seismic marital rift” whipped around the social circuit. An Atlantic city photographer had already threatened to release photos of Mr. Trump’s clandestine partner. Yet despite speculation in the tabloids and gossip press, the identity of the Donald’s paramour still remained a mystery.\n\nIt would be another 18 months before New York columnist Liz Smith broke the story of his season of infidelity. When Marla Maples was finally tagged as the other woman, the liaison had been four years running. The winter after her husband’s Vineyard escapade, Ivana Trump learned of the pair’s affair and confronted Marla at a ski resort in Aspen with her famous line: “You bitch. Leave my husband alone!”\n\nMr. Trump soon announced the end of his 12-year marriage and subsequently married Marla following the news of her pregnancy with their daughter, Tiffany.\n\nIn the past three decades, the events of Mr. Trump’s tryst with Marla have been reported ad nauseam. Curiously absent from all the coverage, however, is any mention of the fact that the Donald and Marla had a secret liaison on July 4, 1988 right in the heart of downtown Edgartown amidst the crowds gathered for the Island’s annual Independence Day parade.” (From : Vineyard Affair, the Donald, Marla and Me by John Rosenmiller)\n\nIt seems that politicians have many different types of associations with the Cape, Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard."
