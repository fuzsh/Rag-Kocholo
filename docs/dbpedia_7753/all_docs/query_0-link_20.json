        "text": "The DREU program provides applicants with the opportunity to conduct research with a faculty mentor for a summer; applicants are directly involved in an active research project and interact with graduate students and professors on a daily basis. This experience is completely immersive and can have a significant impact on one’s academic and career path. For Ms. Ferraioli it was the start of her passion for research and problem solving. “Working with Dr. desJardin, taught me about tackling unsolved problems — how to approach them, how to research prior work, and how to carefully craft your own solution. Due to my newfound interest in research, I expanded this research topic for my senior thesis.”\n\nBut what truly sets DREU apart from other programs is the memories that students carry with them years after. As Ms. Ferraioli remembers, DREU is not just about research, but also about rising to the challenges, even if they are unsolvable. “The most memorable moment of my DREU experience was when Dr. desJardins tasked me with figuring out how to handle a case where the dimensions on different elements of data didn’t match. I researched the problem, brainstormed my own algorithms, dreamt about it, and filled up pages and pages of a notebook with scratched out diagrams and false starts. I confessed my defeat during our weekly meeting. Smiling, she said that the problem I described was as yet unsolved, but we did discuss my attempts.” This moment was integral in Ms. Ferraioli’s life, it was the moment she realized that failure was an inevitable part of learning. Even if there is no existing solution, it does not mean you give up; that is where you start. “This moment completely redefined the concept of failure for me, and removed a lot of the fear surrounding ‘approaching something new’.” Even if you fail, you will have gained valuable knowledge of what doesn’t work, for the next time you try.\n\nCurrently, Ms. Ferraioli is a Senior Developer Advocate with Google Cloud Platform. Her responsibilities are wide-ranging and ever-changing. At a high level, she works to drive adoption of the various Cloud projects, which includes raw computing power as well as massive data analysis. Ms. Ferraioli works with companies to facilitate their use and success with the products, give technical talks, help the engineering teams identify gaps or usability issues, and/or write sample applications illustrating use cases. The most rewarding aspect of her role with Google Cloud Platform is seeing how companies can now have the ability to build and deploy like Google, tackling problems that at one point seemed unsolvable. “I once saw a teenager build an app that helped scheduling at a suicide hotline, and he was able to do that with the Google App Engine.”"
