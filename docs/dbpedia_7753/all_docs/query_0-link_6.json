        "text": "We celebrate your 50th reunion in tandem with the class of 2020, who now share with you the absence of a traditional Commencement ceremony. Taken during your time of action and activism, we hope that the photos highlighted stir heartfelt nostalgia of your time as a Pratt student 50 years ago.\n\nIn I970, you joined the national uprising, achieving global impact. You protested for peace and human rights as well as aligned your efforts with students from colleges across the country. All this while finding the time to commit to your studies and earn your degree.\n\nToday, we applaud your tenacity, bravery, and resilience for all you did to make the Pratt Institute class of 1970 truly unique and remarkable.\n\n\"Commencement is an\n\nimportant marker, but it\n\nonly represents the opening\n\nof the starting gates. now\n\nyou're off and running -\n\nfinding your own way.\n\nYou are equipped with the skills, portfolio, and\n\ntraining from one of the\n\nbest schools in the world.\n\nit counts. It all starts happening now.\"\n\nRobert Barker, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Advertising Design and Visual Communications â€˜70"
