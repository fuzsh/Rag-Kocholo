        "text": "A Look at Undergraduate Research: Covid-19’s Impact on the Airline Industry\n\nBy Julia Allard\n\nSince its outbreak, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit many industries hard, but few were more negatively impacted than air travel. Due to travel restrictions and widespread anxiety among consumers, many airlines struggled to fill seats during the first several months of the pandemic.\n\nIntrigued by the effects of the pandemic in this area of the economy, Christian Mouton (CGS ‘19, CAS ‘21) embarked upon an undergraduate research project to discover exactly how COVID had affected airlines, using data analysis techniques to research how the airline industry was affected by and reacted to the pandemic.\n\nAccording to his research, while flight volume dropped noticeably across the board, commercial flights were hurt significantly more than non-commercial flights.\n\n“Research into this suggested that many airlines changed their airplanes to cargo transportation in order to offset the massive drop in domestic demand,” Mouton said. “In addition to this, a look at the U.S. data on its total flights showed that domestic flights were significantly more damaged due to the pandemic, while international flights simply suffered a minor reduction in total flights.”\n\nMouton, who is majoring in Economics and minoring in Environmental Analysis and Policy, was introduced to the topic through material from his economics courses.\n\n“I was recommended to do an undergraduate research project, one where I am the one actively pursuing and designing it, because it would be good for research experience and future applications,” Mouton said.\n\nCGS presented Mouton with just such an opportunity. The CGS Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning (CITL) paired Mouton with Andy Andres, a Senior Lecture of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, to conduct his research.\n\nAndres said that he enjoyed working alongside Mouton.\n\n“He was very interested in learning more fundamentals of Data Science to further help his career options, and he pursued a project using an airline flights database to better understand the impact the pandemic had on air traffic,” Andres said. “His learning and his interest in the question was a testament to his skill, talent, persistence.”\n\nWorking alongside Andres, Mouton began to delve into different data sets and analysis software to conduct his project, including teaching himself the R language. Mouton said that throughout the project he learned a lot about not just this particular topic, but about the process of data analysis.\n\n“My idea and plan was to do a write-up talking about my process with the data and process of going through and trying to answer my research question and how it’s been changed due to the data I have been finding,” Mouton said. “Instead [of my initial plan], I can talk about how data analysts need to be conscientious about their data and how they interpret and present to the general public because each data set tells a different story.”\n\nThe most rewarding part of the process, Mouton said, was being able to structure his own project.\n\n“I was the one setting up meetings, setting and making milestones, and otherwise building up this research experience from the ground up,” Mouton said. “Students are very used to structure and parameters so this was a very different experience compared to what I’ve been exposed to in my undergraduate career.”\n\nMouton said that he would recommend the undergraduate research program to any other CGS students.\n\n“The opportunity grants you the ability to pursue work in something one has an interest in while receiving mentorship from a faculty member on how to achieve that goal,” he said. “It’s an invaluable learning experience in addition to a helpful indicator that the student is actively trying to make use of their education during their undergraduate career to potential employers.”\n\nCITL provides stipends for CGS students to pursue paid undergraduate research with a member of the CGS faculty.

As CGS students know, sophomore year is when you decide what school/college you are going to enter and I felt like I was torn between choosing a career path that would make money and one that would make me happy/play off of my strengths. After vocalizing this to Dean Godnick (my advisor at the time), I started sobbing about my future and had a bit of a breakdown (as many of us do when thinking about the future). She immediately got up, gave me a hug, and told me that I would be successful in whatever I pursued, as long as I was playing on my strengths and doing something I was passionate about. This moment shaped the rest of my college experience, the way I view my career and aspirations, and made me realize how important it is to look to do something you love. I owe this mentality to Dean Godnick. She is such a crucial part to how my college experience played out. In writing this, I just want to thank her for the role she played in who I am and who I grew to be. Not many people are as lucky as I am to have had such a caring and wonderful college advisor and I just wanted to write this to vocalize my gratitude for the work Dean Godnick does. So to Dean Godnick I say: thank you. You are impacting so many lives in such a positive way and that deserves so much recognition :)\n\nEthan Kolsky, CGS and COM, Advertising Major\n\nWhat student organizations have you been involved in?\n\nCaptain of Men's Tennis Team\n\nWhat have you done in your time at BU that you are most proud of?\n\nBeing named captain of the mens tennis team\n\nWhat do you have planned for the future?\n\nWorking in Burlington, Ma for Oracle in the fall.\n\nWhat is your favorite memory of CGS?\n\nProfessor Chris Coffman had a big impact on my life whether he knows it or not.

With the help of the CGS Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning (CITL)’s undergraduate research program, Lau was able to translate that interest into a 20-page research paper examining Brexit's effects on the country.\n\nIn the Fall 2020 semester, Lau worked alongside Social Sciences Lecturer Shawn Lynch to examine the different movements persisting in the UK after withdrawing from the European Union. Her research focused on the rise of nationalist and right-wing sentiments and racism after the UK severed ties with the EU.\n\nThe topic was one Lau and Lynch expressed a shared interest in.\n\n“I jumped at the chance because of my personal experience witnessing the Brexit vote and aftermath personally, due to my role in the CGS Boston-London Program,” Lynch said.\n\nLynch and Lau came to work together through mutual connections. Lau had expressed her interest for the CITL program to Associate Dean Lynn O’Brien Hallstein, the Director of CITL, and Donna Connor, CITL’s administrative coordinator, who connected her with Lynch. The pair met over Zoom, where they discussed Brexit and agreed to work together that very meeting.\n\nThe pair worked together solely over Zoom, but that didn’t limit Lau and Lynch’s productivity.\n\n“We met regularly to discuss a variety of research related topics, but also just general global events such as the Presidential election in 2020,” Lau said.\n\nWhile Lau researched, Lynch served as a resource for her. In meetings, she was able to solicit feedback and ask questions about her paper.\n\n“Dr. Lynch’s feedback was extremely helpful for me because it forced me to reconsider my position, dive deeper into the topics, and question the accuracy and reliability of the sources I used,” Lau said.\n\nUpon beginning their project, both Lynch and Lau established several goals, most of which have already been achieved. Lau hoped to learn more about researching and writing a twenty-page paper and enjoy the process of researching Brexit specifically. According to Lau, she planned to translate these skills to Capstone, and her next research project: a directed study focused on feminist literary intellectual thought.\n\nAdditionally, the pair shared a goal for her paper to be published, an achievement both Lau and Lynch hope to pursue in the future.\n\n“I came into this experience unsure of what guided research entailed but came out with a wealth of knowledge, a mentor, and a growing passion of shedding light on global events that have an impact on our daily lives,” Lau said.\n\nShe strongly recommends the CITL research experience to CGS students as passionate about researching as she is.\n\n“I live by a simple philosophy: learn everything I can, anytime I can, from anyone I can,” she said.\n\nCITL provides stipends for CGS students to pursue paid undergraduate research with a member of the CGS faculty.

Since then, much of the area has been filled in with landfill to build the city we know today. But though the urban landscape of Boston has changed dramatically over the centuries, one small nature preserve, located just a few miles northeast of Boston Logan International Airport, serves as a reminder of the way our environment shapes our lives.\n\nKnown as Boston's last standing salt marsh, the Belle Isle Marsh Reservation faces several threats, including rising sea levels due to climate change and the recent proposed Suffolk Downs development. The marsh caught the attention of College of General Studies Associate Professor of Humanities Adam Sweeting for its evolving impact on the cultural history of Boston.\n\n“It’s part of the cultural legacy of New England, and climate change is going to force us to rethink how we think about our landscape. That’s actually sort of the broader issues that my work is concerned with right now,” said Sweeting, whose scholarly interests include the environmental humanities and the intersections of literature, art history, and environmental issues. He plans to write a personal reflection on the marsh this summer, regarding its cultural legacy and potential future as a result of climate change.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic postponed a conference presentation Sweeting had planned on the marsh last year, he was able to dive deeper into the marsh’s history with the help of undergraduate researcher Dena Ciampa (CGS ’20, CAS’22). Their partnership is supported by the Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning at CGS, which funds undergraduate researchers who partner with faculty members on a project of mutual interest.\n\nIn order to aid Sweeting’s research, Ciampa looked into new topics every week regarding the marsh, including future flooding projections of East Boston due to climate change, the health of the marsh’s ecosystem and its animal inhabitants, and the implications of a proposed redevelopment of Suffolk Downs.\n\nAlthough the marsh is the last one standing in the Boston area, it serves the important function of preventing flooding to coastal areas.\n\n“Climate change is causing more sea level rise, but the marsh can’t necessarily keep up with it because on the other side, there’s all this built land, preventing it from moving inland, so the marsh is being squeezed from both sides,” said Ciampa, who is currently studying environmental analysis and policy in the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nMoreover, the Suffolk Downs development would bring more people to the area, adding further stress to the marsh. According to Sweeting and Ciampa, these issues of gentrification would alter the character of the surrounding neighborhood of East Boston.\n\nDespite the pandemic confining Ciampa’s research to her apartment, she was able to find many unique sources, including poems, newspapers, paintings of the marsh, and old maps from the Boston Public Library’s digital map collection. She said the research was interdisciplinary, epitomizing CGS’s focus on thinking and problem-solving across disciplines.\n\n“I’ve always been interested in resource conservation, but it was really interesting to see the history and its complications with gentrification and social justice issues,” Ciampa said.\n\nDuring the fall 2020 semester, Ciampa and Sweeting met virtually at least every 10 days, expanding their knowledge on the salt marsh. While it was her first time conducting undergraduate research, Ciampa said she greatly enjoyed the learning opportunity and the research experience.\n\nFor Sweeting, the feeling was mutual.\n\n“The opportunity to work so closely with an undergraduate was just terrific. I would encourage more of my colleagues to do this,” Sweeting said.\n\nCITL provides stipends for CGS students to pursue paid undergraduate research with a member of the CGS faculty.

Students tackled Capstone virtually, meeting with teams dispersed across the globe and presenting their oral defenses via Zoom to discuss topics as timely and relevant as voter turnout in Georgia and improving maternal health care for women of color. The following teams are this year’s award recipients for their exceptional work amid exceptional circumstances.\n\nTeam R: Combating Food Deserts: Introducing Aquaponic Farms to South Side Chicago\n\nTeam R’s winning Capstone group—Brianna Aldea, Juliana Alonso, Caroline Birdsall, Wesley Carty, Kaileen Germain, and Eesha Gholap—analyzed the issue of food deserts in Chicago’s South Side neighborhood and provided a proposal to counter this major public health problem. They researched the historical, geographical and demographic information needed to come up with an innovative solution: aquaponic farms within neighborhoods. Team R faculty described the team’s defense skills “with great skill at the oral defense, with all members of the group displaying deep understanding of the complexities of food distribution in economically disenfranchised neighborhoods.”\n\nTeam S: A Policy Recommendation Prepared by Joe Biden’s Task Force on Russian Cyber Aggression for the Likely Next President of the United States\n\nTeam S’s winning Capstone group—Henry Brennan, Belize Combs, Kyla Denisevich, Sofia Dipilla, Mary King and Catherine Norton—developed a feasible multi-level solution as presidential candidate Joe Biden’s Task Force on Russian Cyber Aggression. The team proposed a voting policy regarding voting to prevent Russian interference. Team S faculty “commend the students in this group for their exceptionally successful Capstone project, and we urge them to send their paper to Washington if Biden is able to defeat Trump (and Putin) in November.”\n\nTeam T: Disinfect Your Vote: Securing Voter Turnout in Georgia’s 2020 General Election\n\nTeam T’s winning Capstone team—Cammy Brits, Haleigh Drew, Kelly Pena, Mariah Rodriguez, Faith Rynda, Humna Siddiqi and Ashlyn Silva—created a voter information campaign to expand voter turnout for the 2020 Georgia general election which took into consideration the COVID-19 outbreak. The team developed targeted advertising as well as a list of specific advice for the Georgia state government in terms of increasing voting access for the future. Team T faculty thought their proposal “was inventive, pragmatic, and (as are the best of solutions) commonsensical. Recognizing how onerous it might be to encourage change in legislation any time in the near future, they focused their efforts on a direct-mail component that equips individuals with “voter packages” and important election materials.”\n\nTeam U: Proposed Regulation of Gene Editing in Humans\n\nTeam U’s winning Capstone team—Rebecca Loo, Lorena Magana, Philip Penabella, Caitlin Pianka, Sara Segal and Priya Tewani—prepared a new national Institute of Genome Editing for CRISPR-Cas9 technology to prevent the potential abuse of unnecessary genome editing. They were able to summarize the policy in this field internationally and domestically. Team U faculty said, “Overall, this group exemplifies the best practices of what a great academic exercise the Capstone can be for learning.”\n\nTeam V: AI, Automation, & the U.S. Economy\n\nTeam V winning Capstone team—Susan Aguilar, Seena Bee, Riley Cavanaugh, Aubrey Franzo, Kara Pepper, Sydney Pickering and Morgan Serughetti—addressed the US economic benefits of AI and AI-driven automation while also minimizing the social impact of job displacement caused by the technology advancement. The team explained the impact of past technology advancement and used their research to recommend a set of policies to deal with AI-driven automation. Team V faculty commented that the group’s “camaraderie and regard for its members were evident in the professional manner with which they conducted themselves throughout the entire Capstone process. They added a lively good-humored Zoom aesthetic flourish to an early required meeting, a fun touch that showed trust in their faculty without detracting from their academic seriousness and focus.”\n\nTeam W: China and its Future Food Security\n\nTeam W’s winning Capstone team—Mingkai Sun, Hanyu Wang, Yuqing Wang, Zihuang Wu, Qianye Yin, Xinyi Zhai and Haoyu Zhang—confront the need to guarantee food security in China while environmental and governmental factors reduce the amount of viable space. They not only analyzed methods of food security, they also used their research as the basis to create a policy recommendation. Team W faculty wrote, “ their Capstone was clear, well researched and presented a well thought out solution.”\n\nTeam W: Recommendations for Improving the Maternal Mortality Rate for American Women of Color\n\nTeam W winning Capstone team—Stephen Bernard, Meredith Correia, Alexis Gomes, Ioannis Michaelidis, Aidan Moger, Sonia Rubeck and Gladys Vargas—explored maternal mortality rates for women of color in the United States. While they examined factors that contribute to the disparity, they also provided a solution that dealt with macro and micro level recommendations. Team W faculty noted that “their Capstone incorporated extensive research, was well written, and presented a clear and thoughtful solution.”\n\nTeam Y: The Hypothetical Trial of Edward Snowden and the Debate of Democracy vs. Security in U.S. Society\n\nTeam Y’s winning Capstone group—Ryan Falzon, Camille Hall, Gabrielle Patterson, Avithej Reddy, Bethany Salah, and Aaron Velasco—focused on creating a verdict for a hypothetical trial for two men, one a whistleblower and one who endangered national security. The purpose of the trial was to show the conflict between the transparency merited by open societies and the secrecy necessary for national security. Team Y faculty wrote, “The students had some fun but their legal research was worthy of law review editors and the arguments for the prosecution and defense were professional and passionate.”\n\nSeven Years of Impact: A Q&A with Megan Sullivan\n\nOn July 1, Megan Sullivan will step down from her role as Associate Dean for Faculty Research and Development and Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning after seven years. In her time as Director and Associate Dean, Sullivan led CITL through a period of growth and development during which undergraduate research grants expanded dramatically and the College won an award for excellence in general education. Sullivan will be succeeded in the role by D. Lynn O'Brien Hallstein. We caught up with Sullivan to discuss her time at CITL and what's next for her as she hands off the role.\n\nHow has CITL evolved since you started your term as director?\n\nCITL has evolved into a really burgeoning center for faculty, staff, student and alumni engagement. CITL has always taught summer institutes for lifelong learners on interdisciplinary topics, hosted academic conferences, published Impact: The Journal of the Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning, and more. We’ve since had the opportunity to offer or sponsor additional faculty development workshops, to fund more varied projects, and to offer the Global Impact Research Fund Award.\n\nWe’ve also been able to further harness our collective scholarship and commitment to pedagogy to present at national conferences and to become even more of a “name” in General Education. CGS has been ‘doing’ General Education for over sixty years, but I was honored that we were recognized by one of the most important associations for general education in my tenure as the director. CITL also wrote for and received grants to nurture staff and faculty development, which was important to me.\n\nCITL has also accomplished smaller, but still important things: we’ve hired an ePortfolio mentor and offered student prizes for ePortfolios; all this helps in our ongoing assessment practices. We’ve revamped the look and feel of Impact; we’ve mentored 7 or 8 what we now call “Pedagogy Fellows” who have gone into careers in higher education; we’ve expanded faculty talks into Alumni Weekend; and we’ve established thoughtful processes and procedures for these varied initiatives.\n\nImportantly, our Undergraduate Research Experience went from sponsoring approximately 3-5 undergraduate researchers to funding up to 50 students per year. This is largely because CGS and Dean Natalie McKnight secured funding from generous alumni and parents, and because we know that undergraduate research is a ‘high impact practice,’ or one of those practices that significantly impacts student success and retention.\n\nCITL supports an incredible array of undergraduate research projects – what are some of the most memorable ones that have stood out to you over the last few years?\n\nGreat question, but there are too many to name! I think more than the topics, I love to see how a student grows as a result of whatever project he or she is involved in. I love to see students’ eyes brighten when they discuss their research projects; I love that CGS faculty have invited students to present papers and attend conferences with them; and I love that now an entire cadre of undergraduates will know something about the process of writing a book or engaging in a long-term project. And I hope that this encourages them to someday write that book or engage in that long term project on their own.\n\nWhy do you believe it’s important to give students an opportunity to engage in paid undergraduate research?\n\nIn the parlance of the day, paid undergraduate research is a ‘win-win’ for everyone: faculty obtain research help, and students learn to put the critical thinking and research skills they learn in college to work by engaging in “real world” research, or research that will make its way into labs, grants, articles, books and conferences. As I noted above, it’s also important because engaging in undergraduate research has been found to increase students’ level of academic success and retention. I also really like that alumni and parents get to ‘win’ in this situation, too. They get to talk to our research teams and feel their excitement. They can contribute with thoughts or deeds; and that is how real research is accomplished, with a shared canvas and a shared goal.\n\nIn addition to supporting undergraduate research, CITL acts as a resource on interdisciplinary general education. Why do you think general education is so important? How is CGS’s program unique in the field of general education?\n\nGeneral education is important because it prioritizes the intellectual curiosity, skills and habits of mind that will help people become better in life and work. General education serves the whole person; it teaches us to be smart, ethical, community-oriented and autonomous. With the Hub, BU recognizes that students should have these opportunities throughout their four years of college, and that’s good. However, research shows that we need to “catch” students in their first two years; these are the years that can literally make or break students’ ability and desire to continue their education. General education is among the most important work a university has to accomplish.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your time as CITL director?\n\nI’m really proud of what I’ve been able to do for the College of General Studies as a whole and with respect to each part or “stakeholder” in this whole. There can be a tendency for administrators to think in terms of constituencies: they support students or faculty or staff or alumni. I’m proud that I’ve been able to learn about and help foreground what folks need across the spectrum at our college and what makes them succeed, whether these people are students, staff, faculty, alumni, parents or donors. The reality is that a college is only as good as each of its parts, and from the beginning I’ve set out to contribute to all these “parts”; I’m proud of that. I was able to do so, because I wanted to, and because that’s something Dean Natalie McKnight believes in and promotes.\n\nI’m also proud that I’ve been able to participate in so many BU committees and to therefore meet people who could, through me, learn more about CGS—its goals, aspirations, sophistication and commitment to teaching and scholarship. When BU created its first university-wide general education program, or the Hub, I could contribute, because general education is what CGS does. Yet I could also be of service on the General Education Committee by allowing other units at BU to know more about what CGS does best: interdisciplinary, cohort learning. The same is true with respect to diversity and inclusion. Because I was able to be a member of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion Chairs’ group, I could showcase how CGS is working on everything from diversity hiring to inclusive pedagogy. This has been hugely important to me. There are other examples, but the reality is that I always thought my role was to help people within CGS and to help others better understand CGS.\n\nWhat’s next for you when your term ends?\n\nFor the next year I am on sabbatical. All my energies will be focused on two things: writing a book about the Irish writer Maeve Brennan, and fostering a community of scholars, activists, educators and policy makers who will better attend to the needs of people in prison and their children. Just as my roles as Director of CITL and Associate Dean for Faculty Development led me to attend to the various communities that create a college, my research and scholarship have always pushed me to attend to and highlight those literary and material voices most in need of being heard.\n\n-- Compiled by Chelsea Feinstein\n\nMy CGS: A Q&A with Tyler Davis\n\nTyler Davis (CGS ’20, COM ’22) spent her gap semester pursuing her passion – film. An internship with the San Francisco International Film Festival turned into an opportunity to have one of her own short films played at the festival – all before she continues on into the College of Communication to study Film and Television. We spoke with Tyler about her internship, what it was like to know her film had been chosen for the festival, and the trip to Ireland that kicked it all off.\n\nHow did you decide that interning at the San Francisco International Film Festival was how you wanted to spend your gap semester? What appealed to you about the opportunity?\n\nGoing into the gap semester, I didn’t have a clear plan on how I wanted to spend it, but I did know that I wanted to work on something related to film. I researched film internships in the Bay Area and that’s how I discovered the San Francisco International Film Festival. I was very excited to get hired because SFFILM has great connections in the film industry and hosts incredible filmmakers from all over the world every year, including during their annual festival. It’s an amazing organization, and I knew I was going to be able to get a lot out of the experience.\n\nWhat was a typical day at your internship like?\n\nI had several different responsibilities as an intern, and every day was a little different. During the week I helped teach stop-motion animation to a 5th-grade class at Jefferson Elementary School in San Francisco. The kids learned the basics of storytelling and then developed their own film, which they brought to life using paper cut outs and an adorable narration. I also worked in the SF Film office researching potential family-friendly short films for the festival to screen during their animated shorts section. I watched a lot of animated films and rated them for age appropriateness. On the weekends I helped host film screenings, mostly of documentary films. I assisted in documenting the film screenings, facilitated live Q&A with the directors and filmed interviews with the artists. Hosting these events was very rewarding because I was able to spend a significant amount of time with the artists, who were from all over the United States as well as different countries like France and Italy.\n\nWhat were some of your favorite experiences during the course of the internship?\n\nWorking with the 5th graders at Jefferson Elementary was very exciting and rewarding since they were all able to work together to create a pretty impressive short film by the end of the class. The majority of the students were new to the art of film storytelling, and it was touching to witness how their excitement for their project progressed as they spent more and more time on it. I really hope some of them were inspired by the experience.\n\nYou’ve been interested in film for a long time. Can you tell me about the artists residency you participated in the summer before your gap semester?\n\nThroughout high school I participated in three very different summer programs, one at CalArts in LA, another at Northwestern in Evanston, IL, and an independent residency at Cow House Studios in Wexford, Ireland. I had a transformative experience at CalArts that really fueled my interest in film as a career. Northwestern was an intensive program in which I learned, in detail, about the different roles in film productions. Living in Ireland was definitely the most challenging, however, because it was the first time I was alone with the film camera. I tried a new, experimental form of filmmaking that was very personal.\n\nTell me about the film you made there.\n\nI made a three-minute short film titled Farewell, inspired by my feelings about leaving home and moving on to college in Boston. I filmed myself on a tripod and played with mirrors and my reflection in order to create different illusions. I then added a voiceover of a poem that I wrote, describing the different memories and experiences that shaped my childhood. I was very proud of the final video since I really struggled working on such an intimate project. A few months after finishing, I submitted it to the Youth Shorts section in the San Francisco International Film Festival, and to my surprise it was accepted!\n\nWhen you were interning, did you plan to submit your film to the festival? What made you decide to submit?\n\nI did not plan on submitting my film to the festival, especially since it was so personal and experimental. I was actually encouraged to submit by my boss, Hillary. She said they usually receive a wide range of submissions and look for a diversity of style.\n\nWhat was it like to be featured at the festival?\n\nWhen I got the news, I was overjoyed and just really honored to have my film selected. The festival happened in April, so I unfortunately didn’t get to go since I was in school in Boston, but my family and some friends were able to see it play at the Roxie Theatre in San Francisco. I get excited just imagining my short film playing in a local SF theatre. It’s so cool because a few months earlier I had been hosting screenings at the Roxie Theatre for established documentary filmmakers and now my own film has played there as well.\n\nWhat are your favorite parts about filmmaking? What do you find the most challenging?\n\nI absolutely love directing and editing because it is the part of the filmmaking process that brings the story to life. I’ve had the director role on a couple different projects so far and it is definitely a challenging role that comes with a lot of responsibility. Directing can be difficult since you are trying to accomplish everything you envisioned during the pre-production process. I feel like I am able to express the most creativity when I am on set.\n\nAre you hoping to pursue film in the future? What are your plans for after finishing your sophomore year at CGS?\n\nI do hope to pursue film in the future and after CGS I plan on transferring to the College of Communication to major in Film/TV. I love film but I still need to figure out what I want to do in film, so I will get the chance to figure that out in COM.\n\nWhat opportunities did your gap semester give you that you wouldn’t have had otherwise? How did that internship prepare you for college?\n\nThe gap semester was absolutely a gift in disguise. I felt a little left out and lost at the beginning of the semester since my friends were all leaving for college. Once I got an internship with SFFILM, however, that all changed and I started appreciating the opportunity. It’s an amazing (and surprisingly short) time to focus on things that you are interested in and commit to something new and unrelated to school. The gap semester gave me a lot of confidence that I could succeed in the future, maybe with film.\n\nWhat advice would you give to current and future CGS students about how to make the most of the gap semester?\n\nFocus on something that you are interested in, new or existing, during the gap semester and get as involved in it as possible. It’s the first time in which you have the freedom to explore whatever you want before you go back to school. It’s also a great time to reflect on your life and how you may want to improve moving forward onto college. Having a longer transition between high school and college was definitely rewarding for me, and I am very happy I had the chance to work with SFFILM.\n\nWhat's next for you in pursuing your passion for film? Do you have anything planned for this summer?\n\nI'm really excited to work on more projects in my upcoming production classes in the College of Communication. I am also currently a pledge in BU's professional film fraternity, Delta Kappa Alpha, which has introduced me to an incredibly driven group of film students on campus. This upcoming summer, I am doing a directed study with the amazing Dean Natalie McKnight that is focused on women filmmakers. I plan to study films written and directed by women in order to identify the unique characteristics of films made by female directors and creators. I will be creating a film at the end of the study inspired by my research.\n\nStudents present undergraduate research projects\n\nThe Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning offers undergraduates an opportunity to partner with College of General Studies faculty on research projects. During the Undergraduate Research Forum on Feb. 4, seven students presented their research to Mike Gould, the donor that made that work possible. Gould said to the students, he “wants people to grow and thought this would be an opportunity to challenge yourself.”\n\nDominic Kemmett presented his research work with Peter Busher, which focuses on the relationship between northern water snakes and beaver structures. Over a period of time, he collected data and concluded that beaver structures appear to be a critical habitat for the northern water snake, especially during the late spring breeding season. For his possible future research, Kemmett wants to expand his area of data and focus on an endangered snake species.\n\nCaroline Pratt worked with Robin Hulbert to measure the prevalence of MRSA bacteria in the gyms at BU. She continued her research from last semester and decided to test the same four equipment pieces every month in the gyms. She used three different methods to help her analyze and after three months, did not see a trend with the bacteria of the different facilities. Pratt did find that the dumbbell had the most bacteria for every round of sampling. For the future, she is looking into using human subjects.\n\nRuslan Crosby worked with Joshua Pederson to design an ethics class with a unique approach. He wanted a class that everyone could take and he wanted the source materials to be interesting. For example, he talked about using books like Peter Pan as a way of demonstrating the concept of hedonism. The course focuses on utilitarianism vs. hedonism, time, and climate change. Crosby said that he learned a lot and now knows what to do better next time, including having clearer objectives and a stronger planning process.\n\nAdam Lazarchik presented findings from his research with Sandy Buerger on historical remedies that may help to counteract antibiotic resistance. While using plants and fruit as samples, he focused on four types of bacteria. His ultimate hope is that studying historical cures will help develop new antibiotics.\n\nPeter Moore, under the guidance of Shawn Lynch, explored neoliberalism globally during the 1980s. He noted that it was an interesting topic as he compared today’s politics with the past. Not only did he learn a lot about neoliberalism, but he also learned about the research process itself and how fluid it is. During his time working with Lynch, he helped Lynch with a paper that will be published in 2021.\n\nKatherine Workman and Aanchal Goel, with the help of Sandy Buerger, observed the communication in environmental samples of bacteria from the Charles River and Lake St. Clair and the effectiveness of probiotics. Even though students in the past have done this experiment before, they wanted to redo it and see it for themselves. They concluded that the two bacteria do communicate based on the way they grew. Furthermore, they found probiotics to be less effective than expected.\n\nAlthough not present at the event, Alexander Batt and Chris Coffman were also recognized for their research on the literary identity and improvisational strategies of The Grateful Dead. Batt will be presenting on his work at a conference in Albuquerque, N.M. later this month.\n\n— Story and Photos by Natalie Seara\n\nCGS Wins AGLS Exemplary Program Award\n\nThe College of General Studies won the Association for General and Liberal Studies’ Exemplary Program Award, recognizing the college’s Boston-London Program for its focus on outstanding co-curricular general education.\n\nMegan Sullivan, Associate Dean for Faculty Research and Development and Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching and Learning, traveled to Orlando, Fla. to accept the national award, alongside several faculty members.\n\n“I think the award makes explicit what many have long recognized: In the era of the BU Hub, CGS has much to offer,” Sullivan said.\n\nFrom the beginning of the development of the Boston-London program, Sullivan said that CGS faculty were eager to take on the challenge of developing a co-curricular program that encapsulated all the best that CGS had to offer.\n\n“We recognized from the beginning that we could infuse a new program with what over 50 years of general education has taught us: students benefit from cohorts of learners; a team of faculty; an interdisciplinary focus with co-curricular or experiential opportunities; and a global component,” she said.\n\nIn the application, Sullivan highlighted how outside of the classroom experiences in both Greater Boston and London, including trips to Walden Pond, Stonehenge, and more, enhanced student learning, with data to support the outcomes.\n\n“Our several year assessment and the fact that we could compare September and January students was huge; we had the data to support that one of our key learning rubrics – integrated learning – is strengthened as a result of co-curricular experiences,” Sullivan said. “I think AGLS also liked that we take general education seriously. It’s what we do, and we do it well precisely because we know how important it is for student success.”\n\nSullivan said the award, which is now on display on the second floor of CGS, is a way of recognizing the work of all those involved with the program, including administrators, faculty, staff, and students.\n\n“I was especially pleased because I am first and foremost a faculty member; I have taught many students in my decades at CGS, and I felt that this award recognized these students and their hard work,” she said.\n\n— By Chelsea Feinstein\n\nCGS Hosts London Conference on Writing and the Nation\n\nOn June 30, 2018, an interdisciplinary group of scholars-- hailing from colleges and universities in at least seven countries (the US, the UK, France, Ireland, Germany, Malta, and the Netherlands)--convened at Boston University's Harrington Gardens building, in South Kensington. The gathering was a conference hosted by the Center for Interdisciplinary Teaching & Learning at the College of General Studies, with the support of BU-London, on the topic of \"Writing, the State, and the Rise of Neo-Nationalism: Historical Contexts and Contemporary Concerns.”\n\nThe conference was organized by CGS Humanities Division faculty members Christopher K. Coffman and E. Thomas Finan. Finan offered a talk, “Motifs of Particularity and Pluralism in American Literature,\" and several other BU faculty presented. The CGS Divisional Chair of Humanities, Adam Sweeting, presented a paper entitled “‘I am Almost Glad not to Know Any Law for the Winds’: Thoreau’s Resistance to National Weather Discourse.\" Master Lecturer of Rhetoric John Regan chaired a panel on nationalism in 20th- and 21st-century Russia, and BU–London faculty members Andy Charlton and Aleks Sierz chaired panels on contemporary nationalism and New World nationalisms, respectively.\n\nThe conference’s keynote speech, “Dylan and the Presidents,” by University of Bristol's Winterstoke Professor of English Daniel Karlin, offered a serious and engaging look at the criticisms, complications, and celebrations of the American presidency in Bob Dylan’s song lyrics. The Times Literary Supplement published an excerpt of Karlin's keynote lecture the week after the conference.\n\nOther papers addressed a wide range of subjects, from the relation between prophetic voice in poetry and national identity, to the anti-nationalism of contemporary anarchists in France, neo-Ottomanism in contemporary Turkish political rhetoric, the opportunities opera presents for renewing nationhood, and the nationalist content of contemporary popular music."
