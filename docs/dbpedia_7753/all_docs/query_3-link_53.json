These rules govern the format, semantics, timing, sequencing, and error control of messages exchanged over a network.\n\n[t]he term \"server operating system product\" includes, but is not limited to, the entire Windows 2000 Server product families and any successors. All software code that is identified as being incorporated within a Microsoft server operating system and/or is distributed with the server operating system (whether or not its installation is optional or is subject to supplemental license agreements) is encompassed by the term. For example, a number of server software products and functionality, including Internet Information Server (a \"web server\") and ActiveDirectory (a \"directory server\"), are included in the commercial distributions of most versions of Windows 2000 Server and fall within the ambit of \"server operating system product.\"\n\nThe Proposed Decree's Provisions for OEM Flexibility Do Not Open the PC Manufacturing Channel to Future Middleware Competitors\n\nThe OEM Provisions Place Sole Responsibility for Introducing Middleware Competition on PC Manufacturers\n\nMicrosoft is not prohibited from retaliating if an OEM removes the code for a Microsoft Middleware Product from its retail PCs.\n\nNor does this provision prevent retaliation if an OEM removes either icons or code for Microsoft software that does not qualify as a \"Microsoft Middleware Product\" (for instance, Microsoft Movie Maker).\n\nAnd Microsoft is not prohibited from retaliating against OEMs for promoting products that fall outside of the Section III.A terms. By way of example, Microsoft could retaliate against OEMs for promoting non-Microsoft Internet services, server operating systems, server middleware or server applications. Microsoft could even retaliate against OEMs for distributing or promoting middleware that does not yet compete with Microsoft Middleware Products.\n\nThe Provisions Allowing OEM Flexibility Do Not Address the Key Issue of Microsoft's Ubiquitous Middleware Development Platform\n\nThe OEM Provisions Do Not Create a Level Playing Field for Middleware Desktop Competition\n\nAdditional OEM Provisions Further Undermine the Crucial Ability of ISVs to Differentiate Competing Middleware Products\n\nThe OEM Provisions Contain Other Superfluous Terms that Substantially Limit Any Potential Market Impact\n\n.\n\nThe OEM Provisions Have No Impact on Java\n\nThe OEM Provisions Largely Codify Microsoft's Existing Business Practices.\n\nThe Proposed Decree Does Not Effectively Preclude Microsoft's Exclusive Dealings\n\nCurrent Market and Economic Realities Demonstrate that the PFJ is Incapable of Having Any Substantial Procompetitive Impact\n\nNew Monopolies Enable Microsoft to Protect its Operating System Monopoly Despite the PFJ\n\nHowever, the PFJ does not require the disclosure of APIs exposed by IE, Office the low-end server operating systems. Microsoft can develop middleware programs that utilize these APIs -- which are as ubiquitous as the Windows APIs themselves -- and thus evade the API disclosure provisions of the PFJ. Similarly, although Section III.E of the PFJ requires the disclosure of Communications Protocols used for interoperability with Microsoft server operating systems, by controlling the client (IE), Microsoft can control the server irrespective of these provisions.54 That is, Microsoft's monopoly control over IE allows it unilaterally to implement proprietary standards and protocols within IE, that are not disclosable under the PFJ because they are not \"implemented in a Windows Operating System Product installed on a client computer\" within the scope of Section III.E.\n\nThe primary competitive threat to the Windows OS/IE platform is the emergence of applications and services provided over the Internet, where the application or service is independent of the computing platform employed by the user. The recent spread of high-speed Internet service has further spurred the development of this category of distributed applications or web services that take advantage of Internet's underlying architecture.\n\nTwo features of distributed applications in particular constitute a revolutionary change from the previous \"client-server\" model. First, rather than residing principally on one machine (either a client or a server), distributed applications effectively reside on the network itself. It is therefore possible to access these services from any computer or device connected to the Internet. From the user's perspective, although the application itself resides on the network, it is accessible as rapidly and seamlessly as if it resided on the user's own PC.\n\nSecond, because the applications and data are accessible from different machines, access to these services depends critically upon being able to establish the identity of the user seeking access to those services. Web identity and authentication services accordingly take on extraordinary importance in the world of distributed applications.\n\nThese changes in the market reveal a picture of today's PC industry that is radically different from the Department's placid vision of \"recreating the potential\" for middleware competition by opening the OEM channel to possible future middleware innovations. The critical question, however, is whether distributed web-based applications, which do not need to be compliant with any particular operating system, will be able to remain independent of Windows and in the process bring down the applications barrier to entry.\n\nThe PFJ does not protect the Internet-based competition for the Windows operating systems monopoly in the future because the proposed decree does nothing to prevent Microsoft from continuing to shift from one anticompetitive activity to another in order to maintain its monopoly. Instead of bundling middleware code into Windows and creating exclusive dealing arrangements with ISVs and OEMs, Microsoft today is attempting to defeat the threat from Web-based services by bundling its Web services technologies into Windows and entering into exclusive vertical distribution arrangements with Web-based content and e-commerce providers. See Passport to Monopoly: Windows XP, Passport, and the Emerging World of Distributed Applications at 25 (ProComp June 21, 2001) and Microsoft's Expanding Monopolies: Casting A Wider .Net (ProComp May 15, 2001).\n\nAs would be expected, Microsoft now attempts to create a proprietary equivalent to the distributed applications paradigm by bundling its latest operating system with certain applications and technologies in order to secure dominance in distributed applications. For example, Microsoft Passport, a proprietary authentication technology built on the .NET Framework, is bundled with Windows XP. This bundling allows Microsoft's own authentication services to have a ubiquitous distribution base -- and deny rival technologies ubiquity -- in the same way that its bundling practices extinguished the middleware threats from Netscape and Java. A monopoly in web identity services will enable Microsoft to control the means by which users access distributed applications from the Internet. Nonetheless, the PFJ does nothing to restrict Microsoft's practices in this area. The API disclosure provisions only mandate the release (if at all) of APIs used by a Microsoft Operating System product to interoperate with Microsoft Middleware, which excludes Passport.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft's broader .NET initiative is replacement of the Java and Netscape technologies that it unlawfully crippled with Microsoft proprietary technology. Microsoft defines .NET as its \"platform for XML web services.\"55 The services which .NET offers are a combination of pre-designed applications, some of which come under the rubric \"Hailstorm,\" and a set of tools, under the rubric of Visual Studio Integration Program, designed to allow developers to create web applications which rely on the all-important APIs exposed by Microsoft programs. At the core of .NET stands the Common Language Runtime environment (\"CLR\"). CLR is Microsoft's answer to the Java runtime environment, with a key difference. CLR provides the developer with a device that is similar to the JVM, but that lacks the element so destructive to Microsoft's hegemony--freedom from reliance on Microsoft's APIs. Of course, CLR will take full advantage of Microsoft's vast distribution network via bundling with future versions of Windows (including Windows XP) as well as with IE and Microsoft Network.\n\nMicrosoft's monopolization strategy has not changed at all. Bill Gates has explained that \"there's a very strong analogy here between what we're doing now [with Web-based services] and what we did with Windows.\"56 Since Microsoft will pursue the same tactics and strategies found unlawful in the instant case, any remedy that does not prohibit a repeat of these practices in new markets and new contexts is facially flawed.\n\nIn sum, the proposed decree fails to address identifiable market and technological developments since the trial record closed that allow Microsoft both to protect its operating systems monopoly against current potential rivals and to engage in the same types of conduct adjudged unlawful by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, the proposed decree does not and cannot \"ensure that there remain no practices likely to result in monopolization in the future,\" Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 103 (citations omitted), and must be rejected by this Court.\n\nThe proposed settlement not only does not achieve the procompetitive effects that the Department claims, it increases Microsoft's dominance of the operating systems market and actually worsens competitive conditions across the entire software industry. Among other things, the proposed decree rewards Microsoft for its illegalities, promoting future defiance of antitrust laws and intransigent tactics by dominant firms. Many of the deficiencies of the proposed decree have been outlined in this submission. These deficiencies will allow Microsoft to perpetuate its monopoly position. In addition, the decree represents a step back from the current state of affairs notably because it sanctions continued bundling or commingling by Microsoft of middleware technologies with Windows, thus increasing rather than decreasing Microsoft's power to sustain the applications barrier to entry protecting its operating systems monopoly while disadvantaging non-Microsoft middleware providers. By enhancing Microsoft's ability to buttress the applications barrier to entry, the proposed settlement harms competition, and increases, rather than terminates, Microsoft's monopoly power.\n\nOne appropriate measure for assessing whether the PFJ is adequate is whether it would preclude today the same conduct Microsoft used to foreclose Netscape and Java, and thus preserve its monopoly power, in 1995-98. It would not.\n\nAs a fundamental matter, this is because Microsoft is not required to disclose the APIs needed for new and innovative forms of middleware. When Netscape was launched in late 1994, Microsoft did not have an Internet browser and was focused on Chairman Gates' vision of interactive television, rather than the Internet. Thus, there were no APIs exposed by Windows that were \"used by Microsoft Middleware to interoperate\" within the scope of Section III.D of the proposed decree. Had the decree been in place when Jim Barksdale, former CEO of Netscape, met with Microsoft in 1995, Netscape would not have been entitled to APIs or any other interoperability information under the express terms of the decree. \"For the same reasons, no interoperability information would have been disclosable to Sun in order to enable interoperability of Java runtime technology with Windows.\n\nMost of the distribution tactics Microsoft used to cut off Netscape's air supply and to \"pollute the market for cross-platform Java\" are also permissible under the decree. Microsoft can still force OEMs to take its own middleware through bundling. Microsoft can still coerce or threaten partners like Intel and rivals like Apple and can still refuse to port its monopoly Office suite in order to protect the applications barrier to entry. Microsoft can still throttle middleware innovations because the PFJ gives it the ability to \"gate\" the functionality and product design of rival middleware products. Microsoft can still prohibit OEMs from removing its middleware, or applications, and is free to retaliate against OEMs that do so. Microsoft can still deceive middleware developers and can still introduce application development tools that pollute open standards by producing only Windows-compatible programs. And Microsoft can still protect the applications barrier by utilizing the very same practices through its monopoly IE and Office products that the PFJ purportedly outlaws for Windows.\n\nIn short, the PFJ does not even foreclose the means of foreclosure that were proved at trial and affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Under any Tunney Act standard of review, it must be rejected.\n\nThe proposed decree is fiddled with ambiguities and loopholes and grants unilateral, essentially unreviewable, power to Microsoft to define the scope of its own ambiguous obligations. As such, the PFJ is an illusory contract, and unenforceable as a matter of well-settled contract law.\n\nAs the Court emphasized in Microsoft I, a proposed settlement cannot be entered, at least without substantive modification, if it is ambiguous or if there are \"foresee[able] difficulties in implementation.\" 56 F.3d at 1462. The proposed decree here is the epitome of such a case.\n\nTwenty-four different sections of the PFJ provide that specific actions by Microsoft, or standards for assessing whether its practices are permissible, must be \"reasonable.\"57 In a decree purportedly drafted to provide a \"certain\" remedy, this is anything but. As just two examples, in addition to the reasonable scope of \"bona fide,\" exclusive joint ventures discussed in the preceding section, Microsoft is expressly permitted to adopt \"reasonable technical requirements\" on which to override an OEM's or end user's choice of non-Microsoft middleware (Section III.H) and to enter into concerted refusals to deal with ISVs -- requiring them not to develop software for competing platforms -- that are \"of reasonable scope and duration\" (Section III.F.2). Consent decrees are interpreted as contracts, and it is black letter contract law that illusory contracts, those that give one party the fight to decide the scope of its own obligations, are not enforceable. See Rest. Contracts 2d . 77.\n\nThe judge in the first instance for all of these reasonableness clauses is Microsoft itself. In short, it is difficult to conceive of a more loosely drafted decree than the PFJ, which allows the defendant, without any practical constraint except lengthy contempt proceedings, to establish unilaterally the extent of its own decree obligations. Due to the inherent ambiguity in \"reasonableness\" terms, these disputes will be complex, tedious and time-consuming exercises for the Court.\n\nThe \"Technical Committee\" and so-called \"Crown Jewel\" provisions are equally inefficacious. The Technical Committee (\"TC\") established by Section IV.B of the proposed decree does not help enforcement matters appreciably. Most significantly, nothing that the Technical Committee does is binding and nothing that it investigates, analyzes or recommends is permitted to see the light of day. The TC reports only to the plaintiffs (Section IV.B.8.e) and \"all information\" gathered by the TC is subject to confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and a protective order (Section IV.B.9). The members of the TC may \"communicate\" with third-parties, but only about \"how their complaints or inquiries might be resolved with Microsoft\" (Section IV.B.8.g). Furthermore, \"[n]o work product, findings or recommendations by the TC may be admitted in any enforcement proceeding before the Court for any purpose, and no member of the TC shall testify by deposition, in court or before any other tribunal regarding any matter related to the decree\" (Section IV.D.4.d).\n\nRather than a vehicle for prompt resolution of enforcement disputes, the TC provisions are a charter for delay and obfuscation. By denying the Court any access -- whether or not in camera -- to the work product of the TC, the proposed decree simply creates another hoop through which third-party complainants, and the government itself, must pass in order to enforce violations of the decree b5, the defendant It also denies the Court the benefit of the unbiased, objective technical expertise of the TC, which is the principal criterion on which its members are to be selected. Coupled with the sheer number of \"reasonableness\" provisions in the decree itself, the TC process will therefore delay enforcement and make clean resolution of decree interpretation issues more costly and burdensome for all affected parties and non-parties.\n\nFinally, Section V.B of the PFJ provides that if the Court finds Microsoft \"has engaged in a pattern of willful and systematic violations,\" on application of the plaintiffs a \"one-time extension\" of the decree may be granted, for up to two years. Although presented as a \"Crown Jewel\" provision, this section does little to ensure compliance. The function of a Crown Jewel clause is to provide such an onerous penalty that the defendant's compliance with its substantive obligations can be coerced, and deliberate evasion avoided, without ever having to invoke the penalty. Here, the \"threat\" Microsoft is being presented with is that of being forced for two more years to decide at its \"sole discretion\" what constitutes Windows, to constrain exclusive joint ventures to \"reasonable\" duration, to gain access to intellectual property developed by middleware competitors, and to dictate to those competitors the functionality and user interface of their products. This is plainly something Microsoft should welcome with open arms rather than fear.\n\nThe vagueness of the terms, the ineffectiveness of the Technical Committee and the lack of a meaningful deterrent Crown Jewel provision will plague the courts for years to come. In the absence of any deterrent, Microsoft will no doubt interpret the \"reasonableness\" standards generously incorporated in the proposed settlement in its own favor. The enforcement agencies and numerous competitors will witness the ill effects of future Microsoft actions and challenge these practices. However, without the proper dispute resolution mechanisms in place, it will be up to the courts to resolve all these \"reasonableness\" issues arising out of the proposed settlement.\n\nProComp and its members have consistently supported structural relief in this case. In our view, divestiture remains the most effective remedy for Microsoft's wide-ranging unlawful practices. Conduct remedies like the proposed decree are a second-best solution, because they rely on the defendants good will to comply. An injunctive decree in a Section 2 monopolization case \"does no more than encourage the monopolist to look for some new way of exercising its dominance that is not covered by the current injunction.\" 58 Comprehensive behavioral decrees inevitably require interpretation and application as the defendant introduces new products, moves into new markets, or changes its business strategies in its traditional markets.\n\nThat does not mean, however, that conduct remedies will necessarily be ineffective here, but rather that they must be targeted and broad enough to redress the core practices used to maintain Microsoft's monopoly and to eliminate the barriers to entry protecting that monopoly power. The proposed decree does not even purport to satisfy this goal, which we submit is compelled by the Ford/United Shoe standard required for assessing relief in this case.\n\nThe relief proposed by the Litigating States achieves these objectives. We respectfully submit that the Court adopt a crown jewel divestiture provision to deter Microsoft from engaging in further unlawful conduct.\n\nThere are several circumstances in which it is established that district courts must engage in rigorous scrutiny of proposed antitrust settlements under the Tunney Act. This case epitomizes those circumstances. If ever there was a case in which a full, independent judicial assessment should be conducted, it is this one.\n\nEven in the pretrial context with its more limited review, Tunney Act courts will rigorously scrutinize proposed settlements when an antitrust case is complex, subject to considerable controversy, and affects large segments of the public.59 Especially rigorous scrutiny is also undertaken when the proposed decree departs substantially from the relief sought in the government's complaint,60 or otherwise represents a sharp reversal in the government's prior position. 61 Each of these situations is present in this case\n\nThis is certainly a highly complex case that has preoccupied the political, technology and business communities for years. These are precisely the circumstances in which the Tunney Act's genesis reveals a major policy concern with the appearance of the government settling for too little \"because of the powerful influence of antitrust defendants and the complexity and importance of antitrust litigation.\" SENATE REPORT, supra, at 147 (statement of Judge J. Skelly Wright).\n\nMicrosoft plainly \"wield[s] great influence and power\" and has brought \"significant pressure to bear on [the] Government\" throughout the litigation. Id. Thus, the Court needs to consider whether this is a case, such as Cascade, where the Department \"knuckled under\" to an economically and politically powerful antitrust defendant. Cascade Natural Gas Corp. v. El Paso Natural Gas Co., 386 U.S. 129, 136, 142 (1967). 62\n\nCourts have also refused to enter proposed antitrust consent decrees where the Government or the defendant did not comply with its procedural responsibilities under the Tunney Act. Even technical and formalistic failures have been deemed grounds to deny entry of a proposed judgment. United States v. Central Contracting Co., 527 F. Supp. 1101 (E.D. Va. 1981).\n\nThe procedural irregularities in this case are far greater, and are of substantive importance to the Court's review. First, the Tunney Act requires the Department to provide an explanation of \"alternatives\" to the proposed decree considered in evaluating a settlement proposal. 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)(6). Here, however, the Department simply offers a laundry list of other conduct remedies proposed by third-parties, dismissing all of them collectively with the terse statement that the PFJ \"provide[s] the most effective and certain relief in the most timely manner.\" CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59475. The Department's assertion is unexplained.\n\nThe CIS recites only that the Department considered intervening changes \"in the computer industry, as well as the decision of the Court of Appeals, which reversed certain of the District Court's liability findings.\"63 Nothing in the CIS offers any useful guidance to the Court, or the public, as to why the rejected conduct remedies are inappropriate; thus, the Department fails to come forward with the \"detailed notice to the public\" the Tunney Act was intended to require.64 This violates the Government's duty not just to \"describe\" the alternatives (which the CIS does), but also to provide an \"explanation\" of their adequacy (which the CIS does not). This is an improperly narrow view of the government's Tunney Act responsibilities is incompatible with the purpose of the Tunney Act to ensure that all relevant issues are subject to maximum \"ventilation.\"65\n\nThe government's \"predictive judgments\" about market structure and competitive effect should be accorded a presumption of regularity, Microsoft I, 56 F.3d at 1460 (quoting United States v. Western Elec. Co., 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied 510 U.S. 984 (1993), but only when tile circumstances are regular. Where, as here, the Department's exposition of the reasons for its settlement and its legal interpretation of the Court of Appeals' mandate are woefully lacking, such a presumption of regularity should not apply. In these circumstances, the Court cannot \"carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement.\" CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59476 (citation omitted).\n\nSecond, the Tunney Act mandates that the government make available all \"materials and documents which the [it] considered determinative in formulating [a settlement] proposal.\" 15 U.S.C. . 16(b). The CIS responds to this requirement with a blanket statement that\n\nCIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59476. That cannot be accurate. Even in antitrust cases that are not the length and complexity of the Microsoft litigation, courts have found similar disclaimers \"to be almost incredible.\" Central Contracting Co., 527 F. Supp. at 1104. It defies credulity to suggest that there does not exist even one document, memorandum or analysis that the Department considered \"determinative\" in selecting the relief package presented to this Court.\n\nThird, the CIS misstates many provisions of the PFJ. We address these in detail in Section III above, and will not repeat that analysis here. Where, as here, the government presents a document that seeks to justify provisions that on close examination arc illusory, it has in effect challenged the legitimacy of statute. Under even the strictest interpretations of Tunney Act deference, this Court cannot permit the Tunney Act process to \"make a mockery of judicial power.\" Microsoft I, 56 F.3d at 1462.\n\nFourth, the Tunney Act requires that the defendant file a list of \"all\" written or oral communications \"by or on behalf of such defendant ... with any officer or employee of the United States concerning or relevant to such proposal, except [for] communications made by counsel of record alone with the Attorney General or the employees of the Department of Justice alone.\" 15 U.S.C. § 16(g). Remarkably, Microsoft's Section 16(g) filing indicates that only two such communications occurred, both in connection with negotiations together with Microsoft and the Court-appointed mediator. This cannot be true It has been publicly confirmed by numerous public officials, and acknowledged by Microsoft, that a large number of Microsoft-retained lawyers and lobbyists have advocated its position on this case before countless officials in Congress and the Executive Branch. The Court should require Microsoft to fully comply with Section 16(g).66\n\nThe government's about-face on its remedy proposals provides another reason why heightened judicial scrutiny is required. While the government now says that the PFJ will provide effective relief, this reflects a marked abandonment of its earlier position. Indeed, the Justice Department's position just 18 months ago was that only structural relief was adequate, and conduct decrees like the proposed PFJ were inherent failures. As emphasized in one of the cases cited by the Justice Department, less deference is warranted when \"the government has requested broad relief at the outset, represented to the courts that nothing less would do, and then abruptly knuckled under.\" United States v. National Broad. Co., 449 F. Supp. 1127, 1144 (C.D. Cal. 1978).\n\nThe point is not that the Department has decided not to seek divestiture, but instead that the conduct remedies it now proposes contradict its prior representations to this Court on their effectiveness. The earlier DOJ position was also consistent with its prior settlement decisions in this litigation itself. In the mediations supervised by Chief Judge Richard Posner in March 2000, the Department and the State plaintiffs demanded settlement terms that would have gone far beyond the limited provisions of the PFJ in eradicating Microsoft's ability to act anticompetitively. Indeed, the plaintiffs' last settlement proposal in the mediations -- dubbed \"Mediator's Draft 18 (Attachment B) -- would have included provisions requiring Microsoft to license the actual source code for Windows, to permit ISVs to modify Windows itself, and to allow OEMs to \"display[] a middleware user interface\" in lieu of the Windows desktop. None of these or similar provisions is included in the proposed decree. Thus, the PFJ is considerably weaker in several key respects than the very conduct relief which the Department demanded in settlement before Microsoft's Sherman Act liability had been established. 67\n\nGiven the importance of this case, and Court's obligation to look to the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit for guidance rather than the Justice Department, the Court must decide for itself whether the settlement would give the public effective relief against Microsoft's proven wrongdoing.\n\nThe drafting of an antitrust decree necessarily \"involves predictions and assumptions concerning future economic and business events.\"68 It is a \"cardinal principle\" of our system of justice that \"factual disputes must be heard in open court and resolved through trial-like evidentiary proceedings.\" Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 101. This mandate for evidentiary hearings applies not just to liability determinations, but also to determinations concerning the \"appropriate [form of] relief.\" Id.; see also, d. at 107 (vacating and remanding Judge Jackson's remedy decree in large part due to his \"fail[ure] to hold an evidentiary hearing despite the presence of remedies-specific factual disputes,\" and holding that a remedies decree must be vacated whenever there is \"a bona fide disagreement concerning the substantive items of relief which could be resolved only by trial\" Id. (quoting Interim Order at 62).\n\nThe Tunney Act contemplates an evidentiary hearing in these circumstances. As the Justice Department recognizes, this court must permit the use of the \"additional procedures\" authorized by 15 U.S.C. § 16(f)\" -- which include live hearings with fact and expert testimony -- if \"the [public] comments have raised significant issues and ... further proceedings would aid the court in resolving those issues.\" CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59476. It strains credulity to suggest, as the Justice Department does, that the remedial phase of the most complicated antitrust case in decades will not involve \"significant issues\" that would benefit from \"further proceedings.\"\n\nEvidentiary hearings are critically important in complex antitrust cases because the assessment of antitrust remedies necessarily requires the Court to determine a number of facts relevant to both the degree of anticompetitive harm and the likely future condition of the market in which competition must be restored. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 340 U.S. 76, 89 (1950); see also United States v. Glaxo Group, Ltd., 410 U.S. 52, 64 (1973). In particular, any proposed settlement decree must reach forward in time to \"assure the public freedom from\" continuance of the monopolistic practices. Id. As such, this Court must make \"`predictions and assumptions concerning future economic and business events.'\" Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 102 (quoting Ford, 405 U.S. at 578). Although courts retain wide discretion in fashioning such forward-looking relief, they must base that relief on a sound evidentiary record. International Salt, 332 U.S. at 401.\n\nIn this case it is especially important to heed Congress's instruction to \"resort to calling witnesses for the purpose of eliciting additional facts,\" HOUSE REPORT, supra, at 5, because the record has not yet been developed on remedies. See Associated Milk Producers, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 34 (W.D. Mo. 1975).69 Indeed, the procedural posture that the Court now faces is more closely akin to a contested summary judgment motion or administrative consent decree, for which hearings are the standard method of resolution. E.g., Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986); Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117 (D.C. Cir. 1983); United States v. Trucking Employers, Inc., 561 F.2d 313 (D.C. Cir. 1977). 70\n\nOnly by permitting third parties, such as ProComp and its members, to participate fully in such a proceeding can the Court assure that there will be adequate evidentiary attention to facts and circumstances that contradict the Department's views on the market, competition and other issues relevant for remedy purposes. Otherwise, this Court would repeat the very error that led the D.C. Circuit to reverse the last judgment in this case.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Court must find that the Proposed Final Judgment is not in the public interest. At a minimum, the Court should defer any judgment on the PFJ until the upcoming remedies hearing in the ongoing litigation is conducted. This is necessary to avoid inconsistent remedies. Indeed, many of the remedies proposed by the Litigating States are irreconcilable with those proposed by the PFJ. When the Court does consider the PFJ, it is obliged in the discharge of its Article III duties to make an independent determination whether the PFJ adequately fulfills the mandate of the D.C. Circuit.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n1 Microsoft Corp. v. United States, 530 U.S. 1301 (2000) (denying appeal); Microsoft Corp. v. United States, 122 S.

Supp. at 151\n\n3 A Tunney Act court is authorized to \"take testimony of Government officials,\" appoint a \"special master and such outside consultants or expert witnesses as the court may deem appropriate,\" hear evidence and argument from other interested persons and organizations, and \"take such other action in the public interest as the court may deem appropriate.\" 15 U.S.C. § 16(f). These procedures are so important to a careful assessment of the public interest that courts routinely employ them, even in pretrial Tunney Act cases. See, e.g.. United States v. Bechtel Corp., 1979-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 62,430 (N.D. Cal. 1979), aff'd 648 F.2d 660 (9th Cir. 1981); Dillard v. City of Foley, 166 F.R.D. 503 (M.D. Ala. 1996); United States v. Westinghouse Elec.

Thus, the remedy trial, scheduled to begin on March I 1, 2002, will start only two weeks after the Justice Department is scheduled to submit its Response-to-Comments on the PFJ. Even if the Justice Department files its Response-to-Comments early, deferring judgment on the PFJ will cause little if any delay, no prejudice, and great benefits to the parties and the Court.\n\n5 Phoenix Renovation Corp. v. Gulf Coast Software, F.R.D. 580, 582 (E.D. Va. 2000) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b)); see also Dana Corp. v. Celotex Asbestos Settlement Trust, 251 F.3d 1107, 1120 (6th Cir. 2001) (affirming the district court's condemnation of a reorganization plan provision that unnecessarily \"raise[d] a likelihood of inconsistent judgments\").\n\n6 \"[A] remedies decree in an antitrust case must seek to 'unfetter a market from anticompetitive conduct,\" to 'terminate the illegal monopoly, deny to the defendant the fruits of its statutory violation, and ensure that there remain no practices likely to result in monopolization in the future.\" Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 103 (citations omitted).\n\n7 The legislative history of the Tunney Act indicates that Congress was clearly aware of Cascade and intended the Act's public interest standard to codify that rule of antitrust remedies. Judge L Skelly Wright, former Chief Judge for the D.C. Circuit, discussed the Cascade problem at length in his Senate appearance, explaining that \"the Supreme Court felt compelled to say that -- and I am quoting -- 'The United States knuckled under to El Paso and settled this litigation' -- close quote, rather than fully protecting the public interest by getting a decree which fully insured future competition.\" SENATE REPORT, supra, at 147.\n\n8 See Microsoft L 56 F.3d at 1452 (no claim that \"Microsoft obtained its alleged monopoly in violation of the antitrust laws\") (emphasis in original); Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 58 (Microsoft \"violated . 2 by engaging in a variety of exclusionary acts ... to maintain its monopoly\").\n\n9 Statement of Charles F. (Rick) Rule, Fried Frank Hams Shriver & Jacobson, Prepared for the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, at 5 (Dec. 12, 2001) (\"Rule Senate Testimony\").\n\n10 This self-evident proposition becomes even more clear when the relief in this case is compared with that adopted by the Department, approved by this Court under the Tunney Act and affirmed on the merits by the Supreme Court in the AT&T antitrust case. United States v. AT&T, 552 F. Supp. 131. There, like here, the Section 2 claim was monopoly maintenance, not unlawful acquisition of monopoly power. Furthermore, unlike Microsoft, AT&T's monopoly was in part a de jure consequence of regulatory and legal protections. Id. at 135-41. Had there in fact been a difference for antitrust remedy purposes between monopoly maintenance and monopoly acquisition, use of the ultimate relief of divestiture in AT&T would have been impermissible. Thus, only by ignoring the largest antitrust settlement of the generation preceding Microsoft can the settling litigants here escape the conclusion that termination of a defendant's monopoly power is the principal remedial objective of Section 2 monopoly maintenance cases.\n\n11 United States v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00-5212, Order (Aug. 2, 2001) (per curiam).\n\n12 The Department's reliance on United States I,. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456 (9th Cir. 1988), is especially problematic. CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59476. In BNS, a merger case, the public interest \"could be harmed irreparably by permitting a merger to become a fait accompli\" while the district court deliberated on the adequacy of the decree's provisions. 858 F.2d at 462. The proposed Microsoft settlement could not be more different. This is not a merger proceeding. Indeed, the public interest would be harmed profoundly if the Court accepts a relief proposal, like the PFJ, that is plainly inadequate to restore competition or eliminate the widespread anticompetitive practices whose illegality was squarely affirmed by the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the Department's citation to BNS for the proposition that this Court cannot \"engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public,\" id., is both highly misleading and inapplicable.\n\n13 The Court of Appeals admonished and reversed the prior District Judge in this case, in part, for entering a decree based largely on the relief proposed by the government. Although the Justice Department's officers \"are by reason of office obliged and expected to consider w and to act -- in the public interest,\" Microsoft III. 253 F.3d at 34 (quoting Judge Jackson), that did not excuse the District Court from its independent obligation to consider and explain how the relief proposed would meet the sealed objectives of antitrust remedies. Microsoft III. 253 F.3d at 34. Nothing less is warranted now.\n\n14 H.R. REP. NO. 93-1463 (1974) (\"HOUSE REPORT\"). Note, The ITT Dividend: Reform of Department of Justice Consent Decree Procedures, 73 colum. L. Rev. 594 (1973).\n\n15 The purposes of the Tunney Act are not implicated in a proposed post-trial settlement of a Government. Section 2 prosecution that has already been affirmed on appeal. There is no risk of excessive secrecy, because the remedy phase of a litigated antitrust case necessarily takes place in an open judicial process dining which, based on the trial record and l/ability findings, the district determines whether the government's requested relief adequately remedies the defendant's violations of the antitrust laws. Nor is there any risk that judicial review of a proposed post-appeal consent decree will discourage government antitrust settlements, as the Department retains the power -- which it exercised long ago in this case -whether to initiate an antitrust prosecution or settle.\n\n16 The courts have therefore distinguished between a court's involvement in \"the executive branch's decision to abandon litigation,\" which \"might impinge upon the doctrine of separation of powers,\" and \"[j]udicial approval of consent decrees under the [Tunney] Act,\" which is \"an entirely distinct proposition because the decree is entered as the court's judgment.\" In re IBM Corp., 687 F.2d 591,602 (2d Cir. 1982).\n\n17 Microsoft accepts the concept of inflection points in technology markets, and unsuccessfully argued to the D.C. Circuit that the possibility of inflection points meant that it did not enjoy monopoly power in the operating systems market. Brief of Appellant Microsoft Corporation, United States v. Microsoft Corp., at 16 (D.C. Cir. filed Nov. 27, 2000) (\"Microsoft D.C. Circuit Brief').\n\n18 The CIS agrees that distribution of Java by Netscape \"creat[ed] the possibility that Sun's Java implementation would achieve the necessary ubiquity on Windows to pose a threat to the applications barrier to entry.\" CIS at 16, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59463\n\n19 Henderson Decl., supra, ¶ 73.\n\n20 \"Microsoft's campaign succeeded in preventing -- for several years, and perhaps permanently -- Navigator and Java from fulfilling their potential to open the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems to competition on the merits.\" United States I,. Microsoft Corp., 87 F.Supp.2d 30, 38 (2000) (Conclusions of Law).\n\n21 The Competitive Impact Statement explains that the objective of the proposed decree is \"to restore the competitive threat that middleware products posed prior to Microsoft's unlawful conduct.\" CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59463-64.\n\n22 James Senate Testimony, supra, at 10.\n\n23 See Findings of Fact ¶ 397 (\"By bundling its version of the Windows JVM with every copy of Internet Explorer and expending some of its surplus monopoly power to maximize the usage of Interact Explorer at Navigator's expense, Microsoft endowed its Java runtime environment with the unique attribute of guaranteed, enduring ubiquity across the enormous Windows installed base.\").\n\n24 Assistant Attorney General James has suggested that such relief would be improper because no \"essential facilities\" claim was made by the government. James Senate Testimony, supra, at 10 (emphasis added). But a monopoly maintenance \"must cant\" remedy designed to redress artificial applications barriers to entry does not need to be supported by an essential facilities claim. To the contrary, in its 1998 Complaint to this Court, the government expressly sought as one form of injunctive relief that Microsoft be required to \"include with [the Windows] operating system the most current version of the Netscape Internet browser.\" Complaint, . VII.2.e.1 (Prayer for Relief). Thus, the very \"must-carry\" obligations that the Department now opposes were the precise relief it initially sought.\n\n25 Professor Rebecca Henderson of the MIT Sloan School of Management, a remedies expert for the government, testified by affidavit in 2000 that \"[t]he availability of the world's most popular office productivity suite on alternative platforms would serve to reduce the barriers to entry protecting Microsoft's monopoly, which will, in turn, increase the potential for competition in the PC operating systems market.\" Declaration of Rebecca M.

See id. at 66 (Microsoft does not \"argue that either excluding IE from the Add/Remove Programs utility of commingling code achieves any integrative benefit\").\n\n30 See also Findings of Fact ¶ 388 (\"Gates told Intel's CEO in June 1996 that he did not want the Inter Architecture Labs cooperating with Sun to develop methods for calling upon multimedia interfaces in Windows.\"); id. ¶ 404 (\"Microsoft used threats to withhold Windows operating-system support from Intel's microprocessors and often to include Intel technology in Windows in order to induce Intel to stop aiding Sun in the development of Java classes that would support innovative multimedia functionality.\").\n\n31 Findings of Fact ¶ 95.\n\n32 Findings of Fact ¶ 102.\n\n33 Findings of Fact ¶ 94.\n\n34 Under the antitrust laws, a firm has not as a matter of law entered into an \"agreement\" with a distributor or other party where it unilaterally declares its position and by virtue of its economic power compels distributors to adhere to those conditions.

The proposed decree's use of \"Microsoft Platform Software\" is confined to Sections III.A and III.F.I (retaliation) and Section III.F.2 and III.G.I (exclusivity), but has no application to API disclosure. United States v. Microsoft, Final Judgment (D.D.C. 2000) (\"Interim Order\").\n\n43 The Competitive Impact Statement flatly mischaracterizes this section in contending that the definition of Microsoft Middleware captures what it calls \"`redistributable[s]' associated with Microsoft Middleware Products.\" CIS, 66 Fed. Reg. at 59464. The Department claims that \"[i]f such a redistributable exists, as they currently do for most Microsoft Middleware Products, then the redistributable is Microsoft Middleware\" because it is \"distributed separately\" from Windows. Id. This explanation, however, ignores the clause specifying that separate distribution must be \"to update\" Windows under Section VI.J.\n\n44 A complete list of Microsoft trademarks is posted on the Web at http://www.microsoft.com/trademarks/docs/mstmark.rtf.

Reg. at 59459.\n\n47 The CIS appears to limit the extent of Microsoft's ability to withhold APIs under Section 1113 of the PFJ. But the CIS description is either unclear or inconsistent with the terms of Section III.J. At a minimum, the Department should reconcile these two documents in order to mitigate the risk of future anticompetitive conduct and litigation over the interpretation of this section. There is no reason to believe that Microsoft will endorse the CIF interpretation, and no doubt Microsoft will argue in any future action that where these two documents conflict, the plain language of the PFJ controls.\n\n48 CIS, 66 Fed.

It states that a lobbying contact is performed by \"counsel of record accompanied by corporate officers; or by attorneys not counsel of record.'\" HOUSE REPORT, supra, at 6 (emphasis added). Congress requires their disclosure in order to guarantee \"that the Government and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice.'\" Id. (quoting Civil Service Comm'n, 414 U.S. 906 (1973)).\n\n67 The barrier to introduction into evidence of settlement offers under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence does not apply where the settlement is not used to show liability but instead, as here, to illuminate the policy considerations governing fashioning of a remedy. E.g., Carney v. American Univ., 151 F.3d 1090, 1095 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Rule 408 precludes proof of settlements and settlement offers only \"to prove liability for or invalidity of\" a claim. Fed. R.

Circuit reversed and remanded precisely because the prior District Judge did not permit an evidentiary hearing on remedies. The court stressed that \"a full exploration of the facts is usually necessary to properly draw an antitrust decree so as to prevent future violations and eradicate existing evils,\" and remanded for such an exploration of facts. Microsoft III, 253 F.3d at 101 (quoting United States v. Ward Baking Co., 376 U.S. 327, 330-31 (1964) (internal quotations and brackets omitted)).\n\n70. In summary judgment practice, complex legal issues are frequently presented to courts on the basis of affidavits and other \"paper\" evidence. But, unless the papers reveal no \"genuine issue\" of \"material fact,\" a standard that cannot be met here, summary judgment motions must be denied and a case set for trial so that the Court can adduce whether the parties have met their respective burdens of proof on the disputed factual issues. E.g., Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323; Thompson Everett, Inc. v. National Cable Adver., 57 F.3d 1317, 1322 (4th Cir. 1995) (applying Celotex to review of a motion for summary judgment of antirust conspiracy claim). Indeed, where the credibility of an affiant is at issue, as it undoubtedly will be here with respect to the reliability of expert opinions and projections of future economic and technological developments, it is difficult to conceive of any basis on which the Court would be permitted to resolve such controverted issues without availing itself of ordinary, trial-type evidentiary procedures.\n\nAttachment A\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA.,\n\nPlaintiff,\n\nv.\n\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION,\n\nDefendant.\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\nCivil Action No. 98-1232 (CKK) STATE OF NEW YORK, et al.,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nv.\n\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION,\n\nDefendant.\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n)\n\n) Civil Action No. 98-1233 (CKK)\n\nDECLARATION OF KENNETH J. ARROW\n\nKenneth J. Arrow declares under penalty of perjury as follows:\n\n1. I am the Joan Kenney Professor of Economics Emeritus and Professor of Operations Research Emeritus at Stanford University. I received the degrees of B.S. in Social Science from The City College in 1940, M.A. in mathematics from Columbia University in 1941, and Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University in 1951. I have taught economics, statistics, and operations research at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and Stanford University, and I have written more than 200 books and articles in economics and operations research. I am the recipient of numerous awards and degrees, including the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science (1972). A significant part of my writing and research has been in the area of economic theory, including the economics of innovation and its relation to industrial organization. My curriculum vitae is attached.\n\n2. I have been asked by ProComp to comment on various economic issues related to the Revised Proposed Final Judgment (\"PFJ\" or the \"decree\") proposed by the United States, various settling States and Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\").\n\n3. My review of the PFJ begins with the fact that Microsoft has been found liable for violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by engaging in a widespread series of practices that illegally maintained its monopoly in Intel-compatible PC operating systems. These practices were focused on eliminating the threat posed to Microsoft's PC operating system monopoly by the combination of Netscape Navigator and cross-platform Java technology (\"middleware competition\").\n\n4. Given that Microsoft has been found liable for illegal monopoly maintenance, the remedies in this case should be designed to eliminate the benefits to Microsoft from its illegal conduct. To the extent possible, the remedies should be designed to restore the possibility of competition in the market where monopoly was illegally maintained (i.e., the market for PC operating systems). In addition, the remedies should strengthen the possibilities for competition and deter the exercise of monopoly power in the present and future, taking account of the special problems of an industry in which network effects are important.\n\n5. It is my opinion that the PFJ fails to accomplish these objectives. First, the PFJ is unduly focused on attempting to re-create an opportunity for future middleware competition. Because of network effects and path dependencies, Microsoft's monopoly power in PC operating systems is more entrenched than it was in the mid-1990s. It will be exceedingly difficult now, even with the best of remedies, to re-establish middleware fully as the kind of competitive threat to Microsoft's monopoly power that it posed in the mid-1990s. Additional remedial steps need to be taken to ensure that Microsoft does not benefit from its illegal conduct and the consequences of that conduct on dynamic competition in the OS market. Second, the PFJ does not address the fact that no effort to restore competition in the market for PC operating systems will be successful without measures designed to lower the applications barrier to entry that currently protects Microsoft's position in this market. Third, the enforcement mechanism described in the PFJ seems likely to be ineffective, even with respect to the inadequate remedies in the PFJ. Fourth, the PFJ pays insufficient attention to the ways in which Microsoft is currently attempting to protect its monopoly power by using its illegally maintained monopoly in PC operating systems against current and future competitive threats, such as server operating systems and Web services.\n\n6. This affidavit has six pans and is organized as follows. After this introduction (Part I), Part II reviews the threat that Netscape, Java and the Internet posed in the mid-1990s to Microsoft's monopoly power in PC operating systems. Part HI then reviews the illegal conduct that Microsoft used in defeating this threat. Part III also analyzes the state of the computer industry today following this illegal conduct and explains why it seems unlikely, at this stage, that the middleware threat can be re-created. With this as background, Parts IV and V review and assess the remedies proposed in the PFJ. Part IV critiques the remedies designed to restore middleware competition. In addition, Part IV discusses the lack of attention in the PFJ to the applications barrier to entry that protects Microsoft's monopoly power in PC operating systems. It also notes certain deficiencies in the enforcement mechanism proposed in the PFJ. Part V follows with a discussion of Microsoft's efforts to protect its existing monopoly power by using its illegally maintained monopoly in PC operating systems to gain advantages in other markets that threaten to reduce the scope of its current market power. Part V explains that the PFJ gives insufficient attention to this important subject -- a subject that bears on the future of competition in the computing industry. The affidavit concludes in Part VI with a summary of conclusions\n\n7. Network externalities have been central to Microsoft's ability to maintain its monopoly power in the market for PC operating systems. Both the District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit referred to the \"applications barrier to entry,\" the process by which a large installed base induces the development of applications and other complementary goods designed for the dominant operating system, which further reinforces the position of the dominant operating system. I described this process in a declaration that I submitted in 1995 on behalf of the government in a prior settlement with Microsoft:\n\n8. The applications barrier to entry implies that it is likely that a single platform (or programming environment) will dominate broad segments of the computer software industry at any point in time. This does not necessarily imply that there will be monopoly; that depends on the extent to which the dominant platform is proprietary or closed. However, if the dominant platform is proprietary (which is certainly the case with Windows), then the interdependence of applications and operating systems creates a barrier against any new entrant. A new entrant would need to create both an operating system and the applications that make it useful.\n\n9. In addition, any customer of a new entrant would have to incur considerable costs in switching to a new system. In the first place, the customer would have to learn new operating procedures. Second, there would be a problem of compatibility of files. These factors constitute a natural obstacle to change, so that a system with a large installed base will have a tendency to retain its users.\n\n10. The special nature of operating systems and software also gives Microsoft, because of its large installed base of operating system, a great advantage in the markets for complementary software. Specifically, it can distribute the software much more easily than its competitors. Since virtually every new PC ships with Windows, Microsoft can put its software into the hands of users by including it with the operating system. Any other vendor of complementary software that wanted to distribute through OEMs would have to cut a separate deal with each OEM, and would face the task of persuading OEMs to carry software products that may be directly competitive with products offered by Microsoft. As a result, complementary software from other vendors typically either has to be downloaded (which imposes added costs on users) or distributed separately to users in \"shrink wrap.\" In addition, Microsoft has the ability to allow Microsoft developers of complementary software access to \"hidden APIs\" -- application programming interfaces in the PC operating system that Microsoft developers know about but which are not disclosed fully to competing developers of complementary software.\n\n11. A threat to Microsoft's monopoly in PC operating systems arose in the mid-1990s with the nearly simultaneous emergence of the Internet browser developed by Netscape and the Java programming environment. These are both examples of middleware -- application software designed to run on multiple operating systems and which has its own set of APIs. Middleware that provides extensive functionality through a broad set of APIs has the potential to become an alternative platform for application development. If many applications valued by PC users were written to middleware APIs, and if the middleware were ported to other operating systems (existing or to be created), then the applications barrier to entry in the market for PC operating systems would be weakened.\n\n12. Netscape Navigator was a browser that also had the potential to become a platform for application programs. Netscape's browser had its own set of APIs to which developers could write application programs.\n\n13. The initial success of Netscape Navigator was dramatic. Netscape shipped its first browser in September 1994.1 In July 1995, less than a year later, its share of the browser market was 74%. 2 By mid-1996, Netscape's Share had reached 85%.3\n\n14. The threat that Netscape pored to Microsoft's monopoly power in PC operating systems was made even greater by the nearly simultaneous development of Java. The Java technology has several pieces. It is a programming language that I understand has features well suited for writing \"distributed applications\" - applications that run on networks, calling upon resources located on different computers in the network. Java technology also includes the Java Virtual Machine (\"JVM\") and Java Class Libraries. The JVM and Java Class Libraries am forms of middleware. They are software programs that have been implemented on Windows and many other operating systems. A JVM is software that converts Java code into instructions that can be processed by the operating system on which the JVM sits. The Java Class Libraries are software that performs specific functions that developers can call upon, and build into, their Java application programs. The JVM and Java Class Libraries are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"Java runtime environment.\" The Java technology has been licensed in a way designed to encourage its implementation on a variety of different operating systems. The Java ideal was captured in the phrase, \"write once, run anywhere.\"\n\n15. Java added to the threat posed by Netscape because it extended the set of middleware APIs to which developers could write application programs. It increased the chances that developers could write sophisticated PC application programs written to middleware APIs instead of Windows APIs. Netscape also complemented Java by serving as a distribution mechanism. The Java technology could not succeed without widespread distribution of the Java runtime environment. Because Netscape supported Java and included the Java runtime environment with every copy of its browser, growth in the share of PCs that used the Netscape browser also meant growth in the share of PCs with a Java runtime environment that supported Java's \"write once, run anywhere\" ideal.\n\n16. The economic relationship between middleware and the OS is unusual among the commodities that economic theory usually deals with. Middleware is a complement to any OS in the short run, but it facilitates substitution among operating systems in the long run. Middleware is a complement in the short run because it adds functionality to the existing OS, but it is in a sense a substitute in the long run, because applications can be written to it rather than to the OS. Middleware therefore permits substitution among operating systems, since the applications are not specific to any one OS. Therefore, an OS monopolist will have an incentive to control middleware in order to maintain its OS monopoly. The short-run complementarity becomes an instrument by which this incentive can be realized. The middleware has to be ported to the OS, and the OS producer's control of the needed APIs can be used to restrict the spread and use of the middleware.\n\n17. Middleware is naturally thought of as a disruptive technology, and the emergence of middleware in 1995 created what is frequently referred to as an \"inflection point.\" Put simply, this means that the then well-defined organization of the software market for personal computers might be altered substantially, or at least such a risk existed. As that organization was centered on the Microsoft Windows operating system and its productivity application suite Microsoft Office, Microsoft had the most at risk from any disrupting change that resulted from middleware.\n\n18. Technological disruptions such as the middleware threat of the mid-1990s do not occur frequently. They only arise when there is an important innovation that allows technology to evolve and create new products or functionality that has widespread appeal. At times of technological disruption, the forces of dynamic competition can play an especially important role. The Netscape browser and the cross-platform Java technology separately and in combination had the potential to develop into an alternative platform for application programs that could run on any operating system and which could transform PC operating systems into a commodity business. Bill Gates, in his memorandum of May 26, 1995 on the \"Internet Tidal Wave,\" described just this sort of dynamic competitive threat when he realized that, if successful, Netscape could \"commoditize\" the operating system.\n\n19. There is no easy method by which an economist can determine exactly how significant a threat Java and Netscape actually represented to Microsoft's operating system monopoly. A precise determination of whether Netscape and Java could have succeeded in eroding Microsoft's monopoly power absent Microsoft's illegal conduct would require a counterfactual analysis that addressed a variety of complex interrelations. However, even without this kind of analysis, we have evidence that a reasonably expert onlooker felt the threat was serious, namely, the statements and behavior of Microsoft. Bill Gates, in his memorandum on the \"Internet Tidal Wave,\" explained:\n\n20. In the same memorandum, Gates made clear that he understood how Microsoft should leverage its Windows advantage to bolster its Internet position:\n\n21. To summarize, in an industry marked by network externalities, there is a strong tendency to monopoly (at least when the dominant platform is proprietary or closed). The consumer welfare and efficiency losses associated with monopoly are well known, but the one most relevant here is the decreased incentive to technological innovation. It is all the more important to encourage what may be called dynamic competition, the entry of new firms and new products. At certain periods, whether due to technological innovation or to a transient situation in which the tendency to monopoly has not yet worked to its completion, the market will be confronted with alternative lines of development; Netscape Navigator and Java as against Microsoft products in 1995, client-server networks and web services today. At these periods, there may be opportunities for a new platform to compete with and possibly take over from the existing one. In view of the strong tendency to monopoly in this industry (because of network externalities), it is all the more important to keep the competition as viable as possible when the opportunity presents itself. In particular, illegal anticompetitive steps by existing monopolists should be prevented to the maximum extent possible. Such a policy prevents the stagnation of existing monopolists and encourages the expansion of the number of alternatives among which the buyers can choose.\n\n22. Microsoft made a concerted effort to eliminate the threat from middleware competition. Microsoft was found to have engaged in illegal conduct exactly at the moment that dynamic competition might have flourished. As the D.C. Circuit concluded, Microsoft took illegal steps to exclude the middleware threat, and in particular, took anticompetitive actions directed against Netscape Navigator and Java. In particular, the D.C. Circuit judged illegal significant elements of Microsoft's strategy:\n\n23. As of 1995, Microsoft's share was of the installed base of PC operating systems was 87% 4 while its share of the Internet browser market was less than 5%.5 Today, those figures stand at 92% for PC operating systems6 and 91% for browsers. 7 Thus Microsoft's position in PC operating systems remains strong, while its share in Internet browsers has risen dramatically.\n\n24. Microsoft's illegal practices were successful in helping to minimize the threat that middleware posed for the creation of a programming environment outside of Microsoft's control. I am aware of no middleware today that poses a risk to Microsoft comparable to that posed by Navigator and Java in 1995. Nor does the government's Competitive Impact Statement suggest that such a threat exists today or is likely to emerge over the five-year duration of the PFJ.\n\n25. Microsoft today has substantial advantages in middleware that make it unlikely the market itself will generate new entrants into middleware capable of re-creating the competitive risk faced by Microsoft in 1995. As noted earlier, through its control over Windows, Microsoft has had--and under the PFJ will continue to have--an enormous advantage in the distribution of software that is complementary to Windows. Since every new PC ships with Windows, Microsoft has a very easy way to get software into the hands of users: it can include it with the operating system. Microsoft can simply bundle the middleware with Windows or it can integrate the code into Windows itself.\n\n26. This ensures the ubiquity of Microsoft middleware and operates as a barrier to entry for competing middleware. Any entrant would have to make a substantial investment to achieve comparable widespread distribution. A firm considering entry should understand that its inability to guarantee a universally exposed set of APIs means that, all other things equal, developers would prefer to write to the APIs exposed by Microsoft middleware. The ubiquity of Microsoft middleware and its ability to integrate middleware into Windows - which the PFJ does not constrain - therefore operate as economic disincentives for the development of competing middleware by potential entrants.\n\n27. Microsoft also has complete freedom in how it prices its middleware. In bundling middleware with Windows, Microsoft need not charge an incremental price for the middleware. It can simply fold into the price of Windows whatever price it would charge for the middleware were it distributed separately. This would not be an option available for a potential entrant who will expect that it would need to establish a separate, discrete positive price for any middleware that it might create. The ability of Microsoft to set an apparent price of zero for its middleware operates as a barrier to entry in middleware.\n\n28. Even if competing middleware were created, the ubiquity of Microsoft middleware would operate as a direct barrier of the distribution of that middleware. As the D.C. Circuit affirmed, OEMs are reluctant to install two products that perform the same function, as this raises support costs. Twice as many products will be supported for the same function, plus consumers may be confused by the presence of both products.\n\n29. Moreover, Microsoft's ability to \"embrace and extend\" any middleware created by an entrant also operates as a barrier to entry. Again, it will take a substantial amount of time for an entrant to distribute innovative middleware. During that time, Microsoft will likely be able to imitate that middleware and distribute updated\" versions of Microsoft middleware over the Internet to end users through its Windows Update feature. Given this, entry into middleware is less likely and this may reduce innovation in and development of middleware.\n\n30. In sum, Microsoft took substantial steps to eliminate the threat posed to it by Netscape and Java. The D.C. Circuit affirmed that a substantial number of those actions constituted impermissible monopoly maintenance and therefore monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Today, Microsoft's illegally maintained monopoly operates as a substantial barrier to new entry into middleware. The monopoly operates as a disincentive for entry and thereby likely reduces innovation in middleware. Given this market structure, it is highly unlikely that market forces alone will lead to the development of innovative middleware that creates the same competitive risk to Microsoft that it faced from Navigator and Java in 1995.\n\n31. No remedy can turn back the clock to 1995 and re-create the competitive threat that existed at that crucial time of technological disruption. Technological disruptions of the magnitude that Bill Gates called \"the Internet tidal wave\" cannot be created by judicial proceedings. Even so, one of the objectives of the remedies should be to attempt to restore, to whatever extent possible, the possibility of competition in the market where the illegal monopoly was maintained (i.e., the market for PC operating systems). The restrictions on Microsoft's behavior in the PFJ fall well short of this objective.\n\n32. Following its years of illegal conduct, Microsoft's position in the core middleware products (Internet browsers and Java technology) is totally different today than it was in 1995. Microsoft has a dominant share of the browser market, IE has caught up to and surpassed Navigator's technical capabilities, and the prospect of large numbers of desktop applications written in \"write once, run anywhere\" Java seems remote.\n\n33. There are two features of the industry that made the threat from Netscape and Java so significant. First, the technological disruption of the Internet made the functionality of the browser sufficiently important that it could become a platform for large numbers of applications. Second, the head start that Netscape and Java had over Microsoft middleware provided a substantial first-mover advantage, a particularly important element for competitive success in network industries prone to \"tipping.\" Probably the only chance a competitor has to overcome the inherent advantages that Microsoft has in distribution is to create a large installed base of users before Microsoft can develop and launch a competitive product.\n\n34. The market position that Microsoft has today makes it difficult for any set of conduct remedies to lead to significant middleware competition. Neither the PFJ nor any other set of conduct remedies can re-create the technological disruption or competitive head start that existed before Microsoft acted illegally. However, for the reasons explained below, the middleware remedies in the PFJ seem especially likely to be ineffective.\n\n35. The PFJ relies heavily on competition in the OEM distribution channel as the key mechanism for overcoming the competitive harm created by Microsoft's actions. The same was true in the government's prior settlement with Microsoft, as I noted in my 1995 declaration:\n\n36. Seven years later, it is clear that little was accomplished in the prior consent decree in relying on the OEM channel to facilitate competition in PC operating systems. Unimpeded access to this channel may indeed be necessary for effective competition. However, it is far from sufficient to create effective competition for middleware given the current state of the industry.\n\n37. One obstacle to competition in middleware, which the PFJ does not address, is the applications barrier that now protects the position of Microsoft middleware. ISVs have a strong incentive to write applications to Microsoft middleware, since Microsoft middleware will be present on every Windows machine that is shipped. The PFJ does not restrict Microsoft's ability to commingle code and include middleware APIs in with its Windows operating system. The PFJ permits OEMs to remove Microsoft middleware icons, but the middleware itself, and its associated API set, will remain. Thus, the ubiquity of Microsoft's middleware will encourage ISVs to write applications to these APIs.\n\n38. The PFJ restricts Microsoft's ability to discriminate against OEMs that also ship competing middleware, but this does not create an incentive for OEMs to ship competing middleware. For the reasons explained by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, OEMs are reluctant to include software that provides similar functionality to other software on the machine - it increases confusion among users and raises support costs.\n\n39. If ISVs do not write applications to the competing middleware, OEMs will not distribute it. If OEMs do not distribute it, ISVs will not write applications to it. The current dominance of Microsoft middleware thus makes it very unlikely that this circle can be broken by the non-discrimination restrictions in the PFJ.\n\n40. The PFJ also seeks to increase the role of OEMs in defining the Windows desktop. This is also insufficient to create significant middleware competition. Even if OEMs had complete control over the icons that would appear on the Windows desktop--and they would not under the PFJ--this would not alter in any way the software that would actually be present on the computer. Removing an icon from the desktop just removes the most obvious point of consumer access to the software, but the ability of ISVs to write to the APIs presented by the software remains unchanged.\n\n41. The PFJ also attempts to prohibit Microsoft from discriminating against OEMs that distribute competing middleware. It does this by requiring Microsoft to provide uniform licensing terms to the 20 largest OEMs and preventing specific retaliation against OEMs that distribute competing middleware. It is not clear to me that these restrictions are sufficient to prevent Microsoft from exercising influence over the behavior of OEMs towards products that compete with Microsoft. First, I understand that the non-discrimination provisions apply only to certain Windows desktop operating systems (Windows XP and Windows 2000 Professional) and not to other Microsoft products that an OEM might purchase. Second, the relationships between Microsoft and OEMs are complex and multi-faceted. For example, Microsoft provides marketing and promotion support to OEMs; its provides technical assistance; its provides allowances for product development. Microsoft may provide these services differently to OEMs. Since the PFJ does not prohibit all forms of discrimination across OEMs, Microsoft may have sufficient ability to influence OEM decision-making.\n\n42. The PFJ also contains limited disclosure requirements. The exact scope of these disclosures depends on careful interpretation of the complex language of the PFJ. I do not attempt such an interpretation but comment only on the limited impact of the disclosure remedies under any reasonable interpretation. There is a requirement to disclose interfaces that permit competing middleware to interoperate with Windows operating systems. I understand, however, that Microsoft is only required to make these disclosures if the interface is already in use by a Microsoft middleware product. A disclosure requirement limited in this manner pushes potential middleware competitors in the direction of \"me too\" products and does little to create incentives for significant innovation in middleware.\n\n43. There are alternative middleware remedies that could have a more significant effect. More aggressive remedies with respect to that middleware threat would be open source Internet Explorer and a requirement for Microsoft to distribute the most current version of the standard Java runtime environment with IE and Windows. Even these remedies are likely to be insufficient to turn back the clock to the level of competition that existed before Microsoft's illegal conduct. But they are likely to have more impact than the remedies in the PFJ.\n\n44. Open source IE is the most effective way to fully expose the links between IE and Windows as well as the IE APIs. This creates the possibility of interoperability between competing products and it furthers the possibility of operating system competition. It also allows anyone who wants to develop a competitive browser to be fully compatible with applications that are written to IE APIs. This way it limits the extension of the applications barrier to entry created by Microsoft's dominance in the browser.\n\n45. The Java must-carry remedy works to erode the application barrier to entry by helping to overcome reluctance of ISVs to develop programs that require Java on the client. It is only by assuring sufficient ubiquity of Java and browser functionality that there is any chance that Microsoft may lose control of the applications barrier through competing middleware.\n\n46. The applications barrier to entry identified by the D.C. Circuit consists in part of the large number of applications available on the Windows platform. As discussed above, successful entry in middleware of the type commenced by Netscape Navigator and Java could have substantially eroded the applications barrier to entry and facilitated entry into the operating systems market.\n\n47. Microsoft controls the most economically important set of applications in its Microsoft Office suite. Office accounts for nearly 30% of Microsoft's annual revenue.8 Software suites consisting of personal productivity applications such as word processing, spreadsheets, presentation software, electronic mail, and calendar and contact management constitute a distinct and relevant product market. Microsoft's share of that market today is in the mid-90s9 and Microsoft almost certainly holds substantial market power.\n\n48. As found by the D.C. Circuit, Microsoft has used its control over Office to maintain its OS monopoly. Microsoft threatened to cancel the Macintosh version of Office if Apple did not distribute Internet Explorer, Microsoft's Interact browser. It is clear that Microsoft's ability to make such threats would be diminished if Microsoft had an obligation to license the rights to port Office to competing OS platforms.\n\n49. Since remedies focused entirely on middleware will not re-create the threat to Microsoft's monopoly power in PC operating systems that existed prior to Microsoft's illegal conduct, additional actions need to be taken to ensure that Microsoft does not benefit from its illegal conduct. These additional actions should be targeted at further reducing the underlying source of Microsoft's market power, namely the applications barrier to entry. Porting Office to other platforms would be a remedy of this type that could have a significant impact on the applications barrier. One factor that limits the demand for Unix workstations, which have computational advantages over Intel-based PCs, is the inability to interoperate with Office. The thin-client model of computing, where most computing occurs on the server, not the client, represents one of the most important threats to Windows desktop computing. The switching costs of adopting new personal productivity software with files not compatible with Office represents a significant barrier to Unix-based thin client networks. A requirement to license the rights to port Office may be one of the most effective ways to create competition for Windows, something which can probably no longer be achieved by remedies exclusively related to middleware.\n\n50. The remedies in the PFJ are too limited in scope to re-create past competitive conditions even if they are enforced perfectly. However, the enforcement mechanisms in the PFJ are far from perfect and will likely lead to delays and costs that further limit the effectiveness of the remedies. The PFJ relies on a technology committee to oversee Microsoft's compliance with the PFJ. The membership in the committee is controlled 50% by the company whose past illegal activities have been the subject of the Circuit Court's decision. The committee lacks both resources and the power to enforce the PFJ. The committee must rely on information provided to it by Microsoft and has little ability to engage in its own investigations. Furthermore, if it uncovers a violation, it must rely on lengthy litigation to enforce it.\n\n51. The implication is that failures by Microsoft to comply may go undetected and if they are detected, it may take a great deal of time and effort to impose a change on Microsoft's behavior. Delays can greatly limit the effectiveness of any particular remedy in a dynamic industry subject to network effects. If enforcement will be ineffective, it may create an incentive for Microsoft to violate the terms of the decree.\n\n52. Other consent decrees have used special masters with sufficient resources and expedited judicial review to enforce their terms. Given the complex, dynamic nature of the software industry, it is especially important that the resources are in place to monitor the terms of the decree and that swift enforcement is possible.\n\n53. The PFJ focuses on the PC desktop as the central space in which competition will take place going forward. It does this by creating limited new operating rights for OEMs coveting the appearance of the desktop and greater protections for installing middleware that competes with Microsoft. As I have discussed above, given the substantial advantages in middleware that Microsoft has through its illegally maintained monopoly, I think that it is unlikely that these desk-top-oriented remedies will spur economically meaningful entry in middleware and that there is therefore little reason to think that those remedies will re-create the competitive risk Microsoft's desktop monopoly faced from middleware entrants in 1995.\n\n54. The PFJ therefore needs to be augmented with remedies that take a forward-looking approach. The PFJ needs to focus on the current and future threats to Microsoft's market power and ensure that Microsoft is not allowed to use its illegally maintained monopoly in PC operating systems to dilute these current and future competitive threats. A PFJ focused on desktop remedies not only will not jump start competition now, but by allowing Microsoft to keep the benefits of its illegal activities, such remedies will fail to deter future illegal anticompetitive actions by Microsoft. Instead, additional remedies should naturally be directed at ensuring competition going forward uninfected by Microsoft's illegally maintained monopoly. In particular, these remedies should seek to re-create the same risks faced by Microsoft in 1995 when the middleware threat arose. \"\n\n55. A forward-looking remedy should seek to limit Microsoft's ability to use its illegally maintained monopoly power to bias competition in complementary products that have the potential to develop into substitutes for desktop computers. Server operating systems and Web services are two prime examples. These products intersect at the middle of two related trends. To date, the Internet has been a PC Interact. Most Interact users access the Internet thro"
