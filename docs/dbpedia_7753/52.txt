We celebrate your 50th reunion in tandem with the class of 2020, who now share with you the absence of a traditional Commencement ceremony. Taken during your time of action and activism, we hope that the photos highlighted stir heartfelt nostalgia of your time as a Pratt student 50 years ago.

In I970, you joined the national uprising, achieving global impact. You protested for peace and human rights as well as aligned your efforts with students from colleges across the country. All this while finding the time to commit to your studies and earn your degree.

Today, we applaud your tenacity, bravery, and resilience for all you did to make the Pratt Institute class of 1970 truly unique and remarkable.

"Commencement is an

important marker, but it

only represents the opening

of the starting gates. now

you're off and running -

finding your own way.

You are equipped with the skills, portfolio, and

training from one of the

best schools in the world.

it counts. It all starts happening now."
