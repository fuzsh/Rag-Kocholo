        "text": "ST. LOUIS • The soldiers of Battery A fired a smart salute — the cue for Jane Wells, daughter of Mayor Rolla Wells, to pull the lanyard to a heavy canvas shroud. Across the expanse now called Art Hill, a breathless crowd of 25,000 suddenly roared with joy.\n\nThus was the statue of King Louis IX of France, the saint for whom the city is named, unveiled in Forest Park on Oct. 4, 1906. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition Committee, which had managed the 1904 World's Fair, offered the statue of the 13th century king as a gift to the city.\n\nA reinforced plaster casting of the same design had adorned the fair's main gate, at Lindell Boulevard and DeBaliviere Avenue. It was popular among newspaper cartoonists and fairgoers meeting friends, the Stan Musial statue of its era. The permanent work in bronze, set upon a high stone pedestal in front of the Art Museum, would become an unofficial symbol of the St. Louis area, eclipsed only by the Gateway Arch in 1965.\n\nThe statue's formal name is \"Apotheosis of St. Louis,\" meaning perfect example.\n\nMayor Wells accepted the committee's gift with suitably grandiose words, calling it \"a monument of remembrance to generations to come of the able and disinterested part that you and your co-workers have taken in production of an exposition never before equaled.\"\n\nThen came the parade of mounted police officers, elected officials in coaches and nearly 5,000 city employees. Newspaper accounts contrasted the sharp formations of police with civilian employees \"in working clothes, careless of formation and continually out of step.\"\n\nIt also was an outpouring of workers' pride. Many among the 1,200 street workers shouldered brooms. Refuse workers drove cleaned and decorated wagons.\n\nHarbor department workers pulled a likeness of their work riverboat, the Mark Twain. Health workers rode in horse-drawn ambulances. Bands added to the happy commotion.\n\nThe parade lasted more than two hours.\n\nDuring the speechmaking, fair director David R. Francis (and former mayor and governor) pitched for public support of the Palace of Fine Arts behind him. It was the only building from the fair designed to be permanent, and it had opened two months before as an art museum.\n\nHe was persuasive. The next April, city voters adopted a property tax to support a free Art Museum, the first step toward today's city-county Zoo-Museum District.\n\nOver the years, the statue of Louis IX has towered over sledders and public gatherings. Maintenance has been little more than an occasional scrubbing and a few new swords.\n\nOnce a tempting trophy for vandals, the king's raised sword was replaced several times until the city applied a welder's heavy touch.\n\nCelebrating the birthday of King Louis IX\n\nBurnin' Love Festival\n\nStatue Cleaning Time on Art Hill\n\nBrief moonrise view from Art Hill\n\nSpring storms move through the St. Louis area\n\nFireworks close out second day of Fair Saint Louis\n\nBurnin' Love Festival kicks off 250 years of St. Louis\n\n2016: Flags frame King Louis IX statue\n\nLouie, we hardly know ye\n\nSnow around King Louis IX statue\n\nGhostly art\n\n2013 St. Louis Art Museum East Building expansion\n\nSLU's College Church approaches 175th anniversary\n\nSledding on Art Hill, 1951\n\nSt. Louis"
