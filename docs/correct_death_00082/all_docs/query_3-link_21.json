        "text": "Aigues-Mortes, the starting point for two Crusades in the 13th century\n\nAs I have written before, the city of St Louis in Missouri, USA, was founded in 1764 as a French fur-trading village by Pierre Laclede. He named the city “St Louis” for King Louis IX (Saint Louis), who was the patron saint of King Louis XV, the French king at the time of Laclede.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about traveling in France (or much of Europe actually) is to find so much history, so many old towns and buildings with a story. And, in this case, linking part of the history to the story of St Louis, Missouri.\n\nBit of background on King Louis IX:\n\nKing Louis 1X (1214-1270) was king of France from 1226-1270. He was crowned at the age of 12 and was helped a lot by his mother, Queen Blanche. By all accounts, he was a very good and smart king, skilled in diplomacy as well as war, both at home and abroad when he led two Crusades. During the years he was king, France was generally peaceful and prosperous and he strengthened the French monarchy. He reformed the courts and the taxation system, so everyone had a chance at being treated fairly. He also abolished trial by combat and trial by ordeal, replacing them with trial by jury, and he would often act as the supreme judge. He was considered the model of the ideal Christian monarch, as his religious faith was very strong, and was canonized by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297, probably to honor his efforts as a Crusader. He was also the patron saint of the sacred arts, especially Gothic architecture. He built the wonderful Sainte Chapelle in Paris to house the relics retrieved from the Holy Land.\n\nKing Louis IX’s religious beliefs and the two Crusades that he led feature prominently in any writings about his life, so we were excited to visit the old city of Aigues-Mortes in the Camargue in the south of France. The Camargue and the city are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Camargue is a special area of salt flats, étangs (ponds) and marshes lying between the two arms of the Rhone River as it heads for the Mediterranean Sea. Aigues-Morts literally means “stagnant waters” or “dead waters” because the waters around here are swampy, not free-flowing, and not directly linked to the sea. It is a river port, connected by various canals, but silting has always been a problem. The main canal in Aigues-Mortes is the Canal du Rhone à Sète, connecting it to the Mediterranean. Some people believe that Aigues-Mortes was once on the sea, but according to engineers this was never the case.\n\nIn 1240, King Louis IX, who was looking for a port with access to the Mediterranean Sea and to the rich trading possibilities with Italy and the East, set his sights on the site of what would become Aigues-Mortes. Louis obtained these lands from the Abbey Benedictine de Psalmodie, and built the imposing king’s tower there (later called the tower of Constance), on the site of a tower built by Charlemagne in 791 for the safely of fishermen and salt workers. He also built a castle, which has now disappeared, and built canals towards the sea and to Arles and Montpellier. The town was built up around this project. In order to attract people, he granted the city a charter of privileges exempting it from taxes.\n\nThe ramparts were started during Louis IX’s life but not finished. In 1268, a tax of one denarius per pound of merchandise was instituted to finance the ramparts. King Louis IX embarked on the 7th Crusade from the port of Aigues-Mortes in 1248, and another time in 1270 during the 8th Crusade. He died a little after that from typhus un Tunis.\n\nLouis IX’s son, Philippe le Hardi, took over the work of building the ramparts in 1272 and at the beginning of the 14th century they were complete. The 1.6km-long walls surrounding the old town, which is an almost perfect quadrilateral, have four corner towers and 10 fortified gates (portes)—see diagram.\n\nWe were staying in Montpellier, and Aigues-Mortes is about a 25-minute drive from there. It is one of the most beautiful medieval fortified towns in Europe and seeing it rising from the flat salt marshes is a striking sight. It was a cold but sunny day when we went and, as we approached, the outer walls glowed a soft golden-yellow color.\n\nWe parked in the parking lot near La Porte des Moulins, a good choice as it turned out because there are no other buildings on that side of the city walls so you get a great view of the walls and gates. On the opposite side of the walled city, outside La Porte de la Gardette, are the newer town and the port area, so it’s more difficult to get an overview of the walls.\n\nIt’s fun to just wander around the old town within the walls and to climb up on the ramparts. Many of the streets have touristy-type shops now and the spirit of St Louis is very evident in the choice of store names—Galerie Saint Louis and Le Saint Louis souvenirs, for example.\n\nIn the main square, the Place Saint Louis, is an imposing statue of the king/saint. On the base is written: To Saint Louis. The town of Aigues-Morts, wanting to perpetuate the most glorious memory in its annals, raised this statue in the place that was witness to the embarkment of these Christian heroes for the 7th and 8th Crusades."
