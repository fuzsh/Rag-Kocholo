        "text": "In June 1245, a year after the final loss of Jerusalem, Pope Innocent IV opened a great ecclesiastical council at Lyons. Although urgent appeals for help had come from the East, it is unlikely that the Crusade was uppermost in the pope’s mind, for a combination of crises confronted the church: numerous complaints of clerical abuses, increasing troubles with Frederick II in Italy, and the advance of the Mongols into eastern Europe. Nevertheless, when King Louis IX of France announced his intention to lead a new Crusade, the pope gave it his support and authorized the customary levy on clerical incomes.\n\nAs a Crusader, Louis (who would be canonized in 1297) was the antithesis of Frederick. Possessed of a rare combination of religious devotion, firmness as a ruler, and bravery as a warrior, he seemed the very ideal of the Crusader. He was beloved by his subjects and respected abroad. He ardently believed the Crusade to be God’s work, and he was far from sympathetic to the pope’s use of Crusade propaganda against the emperor.\n\nIt was three years before Louis was ready to embark. Peace had to be arranged with England, transport had to be provided by Genoa and Marseilles, and funds had to be raised. When the king embarked in August 1248, he was accompanied by his queen; his brothers Robert of Artois and Charles of Anjou; many distinguished French nobles, including Jean, sire de Joinville, author of The Life of St. Louis (1309); and a small English contingent. His army was a formidable one, numbering perhaps 15,000. France was left in the experienced hands of the queen mother, Blanche of Castile.\n\nThe Crusade arrived at Cyprus in September, and it was again decided to attack Egypt. Since a winter campaign was not feasible and Louis rejected the suggestion that he attempt negotiations, it was not until May 1249 that an expedition of some 120 large and many smaller vessels got under way. Fortune favoured them at first, and Damietta was again in Christian hands by June. Shortly afterward the army was strengthened by the arrival of Louis’s third brother, Alphonse of Poitiers. Sultan al-Ṣāliḥ Ayyūb’s death was followed by confusion in Cairo, which, after some argument, had become the Crusaders’ objective. In February 1250 Robert of Artois led a surprise attack on the Egyptian camp 2 miles (3 km) from Al-Manṣūrah, but, rejecting the advice of more-experienced campaigners and acting impetuously, he was trapped within the city. Many knights lost their lives. Louis soon arrived with the main army and won another victory, albeit a costly one, near Al-Manṣūrah. It was the last Crusader success.\n\nMeanwhile, Tūrān-Shāh, the sultan’s son, had returned from Diyarbakır (now in Turkey) to Cairo and temporarily dominated dissident factions there. Frankish supply ships from Damietta were intercepted, and before long the Crusaders were suffering from famine and disease. Louis, reluctant to abandon a work to which he had dedicated his very kingdom, perhaps delayed too long before ordering a retreat. Refusing the pleas of others to protect himself by fleeing, he remained to lead his soldiers and was captured with many of them as the Muslim forces closed in.\n\nThe king and nobles were held for ransom, but many nonnoble captives were killed. The queen, who had just given birth to a son sorrowfully named John Tristan, managed with great courage to secure sufficient food and to persuade the Genoese and Pisans not to evacuate Damietta until it could be ceded formally by treaty and the king’s ransom arranged. On May 6, 1250, the king was released, and Damietta surrendered.\n\nDespite the pleadings of his advisers, Louis did not return home immediately. He felt bound in conscience to negotiate the release of as many prisoners as possible, and he also improved the defenses of the kingdom by strengthening a number of fortifications before he left in April 1254. Thus, he atoned in some small measure for the failure of the Crusade and returned to France, determined to lead a life as a Christian king worthy of rescuing Jerusalem one day.\n\nDuring these same years a group of Mongols under Hülegü overran Mesopotamia and in 1258 took Baghdad, thus ending the venerable ʿAbbāsid caliphate. In 1260 the Mamlūks of Egypt, a new dynasty that had arisen from the leaders of former slave bodyguards of the sultan, defeated the Mongols at ʿAyn Jālūt in Syria and halted their southward advance. The Muslim states of Syria were caught in the middle, and the Latin states were in grave danger. King Hayton of Armenia and his son-in-law Bohemond VI of Antioch-Tripoli allied themselves with the Mongols. But the barons at Acre were still more disposed to dealing with the Muslims, whom they knew, than with the terrifying and unknown Mongols.\n\nIn 1260, after murdering his predecessor, Baybars became sultan of Egypt. Though this famous Mamlūk sultan did not live to see the fall of the Latin states (he died in 1277), he had reduced them to a few coastal outposts. Baybars was ruthless, utterly lacking the generous chivalry that the Crusaders had admired in Saladin. Most of his conquests were followed by a general massacre of the inhabitants, often including the native Christians, especially when they had been in league with the Mongols. In 1265 he took Caesarea, Haifa, and Arsuf. The following year he conquered Galilee and devastated Cilician Armenia. In 1268 Antioch was taken and all the inhabitants slaughtered. The great Hospitaller fortress of Krak des Chevaliers fell three years later.\n\nThese disasters again brought pleas for aid from the West. King Louis once again took up the cross, but his second venture, the Eighth Crusade, never reached the East. The expedition instead went to Tunis, probably because of the influence of Louis’s brother Charles of Anjou, who had recently been named by the papacy as the successor to the Hohenstaufens in Sicily. In 1268 he defeated Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen line, and he was soon involved in grandiose Mediterranean projects, which ultimately included even Byzantium."
