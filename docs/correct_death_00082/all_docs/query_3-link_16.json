        "text": "Louis, the quintessential Christian Prince, was born in Poissy, France on 25 April 1215 to King Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile. His father died when he was just eleven years old, and he was crowned -- at Rheims, like almost all French Kings -- on the First Sunday of Advent in 1226. His very strong and pious mother acted as his regent, supressing various revolts to secure her son's place. She acted as regent even after he reached the age of majority, and guided his career with strong Christian advice, forming his character in holiness. She would say to him, \"Never forget that sin is the only great evil in the world. No mother could love her son more than I love you. But I would rather see you lying dead at my feet than know that you had offended God by one mortal sin\" -- sentiments that he took to heart and would later pass on to his own successor (see below).\n\nIn 1230, he outlawed all forms of usury and compelled usurers to contribute toward the Crusades when their debtors could not be found to be compensated (later under his reign, in 1240, would come the famous disputation of the Talmud in Paris, after rulers and churchmen discovered what blasphemies the Talmud taught. Copies of the Talmud were burned in great fires in the streets of Paris).\n\nLouis married at age nineteen, in 1234, taking to wife Marguerite of Provence, with whom he had eleven children -- five sons and six daughters. He went on a Crusade in 1248, and fought nobly and with great honor, forbidding his men to kill prisoners and always expecting them to act as Christians. But he lost the battle and, weakened by dystentery, was captured in Mansoura, Egypt. During his captivity, he sang the Divine Office every day with two chaplains and conducted himself with such honor as to impress his captors. When the Sultan was killed by his own emirs, he was set free, but didn't immediately return to Europe; instead, he went to the Holy Land, and remained there in order to help fortify the Christian colonies, not returning until 1254, during which time his mother died.\n\nVery dedicated to the cause of peace, he not only arbitrated and made treaties with Henry VIII and James I of Aragon, but did much to curb a lot of the petty, feudal warfare that caused so much harm. He was a great patron of learning, the arts, and architecture, and under his patronage, the Sorbonne was founded; abbeys built; the choir, apse, and nave of St. Denis Basilica -- which contains the tombs of almost all French Kings -- were refurbished, etc. His crowning architectural glory, though, is Ste. Chapelle, the beautiful chapel with the walls of stained glass that sits on the tiny Ile de la Cité right in the middle of Paris, in the Seine River (the same island where Notre Dame Cathedral is found). This chapel was built to house a part of the Crown of Thorns and a piece of the True Cross which he purchased from Emperor Baldwin II in Constantinople, and it became St. Louis's personal royal chapel. To stand in it is to seem to stand inside a luminous jewel box:\n\nInterior of Ste. Chapelle, Paris\n\nGlorious and fruitful was his reign! Indeed, having dealt with economic woes by expelling the usurers from France, King St. Louis ruled over a time that became known as \"the golden century of Saint Louis.\"\n\nHe was most famous, though, for his charity, humility, and concern for the poor, something undoubtedly inspired by his having become a Franciscan Tertiary. He built many hospitals, among them the hospital known as \"Quinze-vingt\" (\"Fifteen-Twenty\") -- a hospital for the blind and whose name comes from the fact that it could care for 300 patients. He built homes for reformed prostitutes. Every day, he met with the poor personally and saw to it that they were fed, inviting them to dine with him, and washing their feet in imitation of Christ at the Last Supper. He gave special attention to the indigent during Advent and Lent. All who knew him admired him; no one spoke ill of him and he spoke ill of no one else. His biographer, Joinville, wrote, \"I was a good twenty-two years in the King's company and never once did I hear him swear, either by God, or His Mother, or His saints. I did not even hear him name the Devil, except if he met the word when reading aloud, or when discussing what had been read.\"\n\nHe was also very devoted to the cause of Justice, and eliminated the feudal method of conflict resolution through combat, replacing it with arbitration and judicial process. He eradicated his ancestors' \"King's Court\" and established popular courts in which he, himself, would hear his subjects' grievances.\n\nIn 1270, he went off on another Crusade, this time in an attempt to convert the Emir of Tunis after being inspired by acting as godfather to a Jewish convert. Again, his Crusade failed, and again he became sick with dysentery. This time, though, he did not recover. He died, in Tunis, at three in the afternoon on 25 August 1270. His last words were the last words of Christ: \"Into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" He was canonized in 1297, 27 years after his death, and was succeeded by his son, Philip III (see Louis's letter to him below). His line continued after him until the French Revolution, when King Louis XVI was guillotined on 21 January 1793. At this act of regicide, the Abbe Edgeworth said, \"Son of St. Louis, ascend to Heaven!\"\n\nKing St. Louis's remains were laid to rest, like those of almost all French Kings, in the Basilica of St. Denis, located in what is now a northern suburb of Paris. The Basilica was sacked during the infamous Revolution and its royal tombs were emptied into a mass grave -- with some of the tombs themselves being destroyed, including that of St. Louis (the tomb-smashing was stopped when an archaeologist of the time urged the revolutionaries to consider them \"works of art\"). In 1817, the mass grave was opened and all of the bones were placed in a single ossuary, with the names of the monarchs recorded.\n\nSt. Louis is the patron of builders, kings, large families, Crusaders, and, of course, St. Louis, Missouri. He is also, along with St. Elizabeth of Hungary -- a fellow Franciscan Tertirary -- patron of the Franciscan Third Order. He is represented in art by the Crown of Thorns, crown, scepter, and the fleur-de-lis (the symbol of French monarchy, most likely a stylized depiction of the Yellow Flag Iris -- Iris pseudocorus).\n\nFor a book about St. Louis, see Saint Louis (Louis IX of France) the Most Christian King (pdf) from this site's Catholic Library.\n\nCustoms\n\nToday would be a good day to pray the Litany of Saint Louis of France. And the day's collect makes for a more succinct prayer for the day:\n\nO God, Who didst exalt blessed Louis Thy Confessor from an earthly realm to the glory of Thy Heavenly kingdom: grant, we pray Thee, that by his merits and intercession we may be made heirs of the King of Kings, Thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.\n\nMuch is made of this Feast in parts of French Canada, and in France, especially in Aigues-Mortes, the port city from which King St. Louis departed for the 7th and 8th Crusades, and which he'd transformed from a backwater area into a regular town, building roads and towers after purchasing land from the Benedictines who lived there. Great medieval re-enactments, mystery plays, parades, and a medieval market can be enjoyed in Aigues-Mortes on the days surrounding this feast. In that spirit, this medieval song written in King St. Louis's honor is perfect for the day:\n\nLe Roi Louis\n\nLe Roy Louis a convoqué,\n\nTous ses barons et chevaliers.\n\nLe Roy Louis a demandé,\n\n\"Qui veut me suivre où que j'irai?\"\n\nLes plus ardents se sont dressés,\n\nOnt juré Foi, Fidélité.\n\nLes plus prudents ont deviné,\n\nOù le Roy voulait les mener.\n\nAinsi parla le Duc de Baume,\n\n\"Je combattrai pour le royaume.\"\n\nLe Roy lui dit \"c'est point assez:\n\nNous défendrons la Chrétienté.\"\n\nAinsi parla Seigneur d'Estienne:\n\n\"Je défends la terre chrétienne,\n\nMais je ne veux pas m'en aller\n\nSemer la mort dessus la mer.\"\n\n\"Ah\", dit le Roy, \"notre domaine,\n\nS'étend sur la rive africaine,\n\nJusqu'au désert le plus avant.\n\nC'est notre fief, et prix du sang.\"\n\nS'en est allé le Roy Louis.\n\nLes plus fidèles l'ont suivi.\n\nS'en sont allés bien loin, bien loin,\n\nPour conquérir le fief divin. King Louis\n\nThe King Louis summoned,\n\nAll his barons and knights.\n\nThe King Louis asked,\n\n\"Who wants to follow me where I will go?\"\n\nThe more ardent ones were prepared,\n\nthey swore for faith, fidelity.\n\nThe more prudent ones guessed,\n\nWhere the king wanted to lead them to.\n\nThen spoke the Duke of Baume,\n\n\"I will fight for the kingdom.\"\n\nThe king told him \"It's not enough:\n\nWe will defend the Christianity.\"\n\nThen spoke the Lord of Estienne:\n\n\"I defend the christian lands,\n\nBut I do not want to go\n\nTo sow the dead under the sea.\"\n\n\"Ah\", said the king, \"our dominance\n\nextends over the African river,\n\nUntil the desert farther forward.\n\nIt's our fief, and price of blood.\"\n\nThe King Louis came from there.\n\nThe most faithful ones followed him.\n\nHe came quite, quite afar.\n\nTo conquer the divine fief.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to really \"go medieval\" and recreate a medieval feast, today would be a good day to do it! If you don't want to prepare an entire feast, maybe this medieval spice bread will serve the cause (the baking soda is a modern addition). It's best, though, if prepared the day before!:\n\nPain d’épices\n\n1 1/3 cups honey\n\n1 cup sugar\n\n3/4 cup boiling water\n\n1/2 tsp salt\n\n1 tbsp baking soda\n\n3 to 4 cups rye flour (whole wheat flour can be substituted)\n\n2/3 cup pulverized blanched almonds\n\n1 tsp almond extract\n\n1 tsp anise extract\n\n1/4 cup dark rum or bourbon whiskey\n\n1/2 tsp cinnamon\n\n1/2 tsp ground cloves\n\n1/2 tsp mace\n\n1 cup mixed glacéed fruits, diced and rinsed in boiling water\n\nPreheat the oven to 325°F. Beat the honey, sugar, and boiling water using the mixer in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Add the salt, soda, and 3 cups of rye flour. Gradually add enough of the remaining flour until you make a heavy, sticky, but still manipulable mass.\n\nAdd the remaining ingredients and mix at a slow speed to incorporate. Turn the batter into a 9\" X 2\" non-stick loaf pan that you've lined with parchment, filling it up by about two-thirds. Smooth the top with a damp finger or spatula. Bake on the middle rack for 50 minutes to 1 1/4 hours, 'til a toothpick comes out clean. Let sit a day, covered, to \"ripen.\" Good paired with savory things (e.g., foie gras, salmon, duck breast, or Roquefort) and sweet white wine. Also good toasted for breakfast and served with butter and jam, along with coffee, tea, or cider.\n\nReading\n\nKing Saint Louis's\n\nLast Instructions to his Eldest Son, Philip III"
