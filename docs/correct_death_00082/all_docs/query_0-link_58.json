        "text": "The moors consider St. Louis and their great saint, Sidi Boo Saeed, to have been one and the same person, positively asserting that the French monarch, on his death-bed, abjured his own religion, and embraced the doctrines of muhammedanism, changing, at the same time, his name to Boo-Saeed abû sa'ïd \"the father of happiness.\"\n\n- Temple\n\nNINETEENTH-CENTURY VISITORS to the Tunisian coastal cities of Carthage, La Goulette, and the village of Sidi Bou Saïd returned with a legend. Although the versions varied, the basic outlines were the same: Saint Louis, medieval king of France, converted to Islam and was the patron saint of the village bearing his name. The reference to the French king was not random, for Saint Louis (Louis IX) did in fact die on the coast of Tunisia in 1270 on a failed crusade expedition. The first noted report of the legend is from the explorer Sir Grenville Temple in 1833 (published in 1835), but travel writers, diplomats, soldiers, and journalists visiting the area published several additional reports of the legend, primarily during the second half of the nineteenth century. The legend is recorded only in European sources, leading Pierre G. Grandchamps to quip that it was the product of the overexcited imagination of European travelers (1912:467-68). Nevertheless, it does appear to be local in origin and even Grandchamps reconsidered his assessment when the above-quoted version from the early nineteenth century (a period that saw few European travelers in Tunisia) came to his attention (1913:481).\n\nOne critical source, André Demeerseman's La Légende Tunisienne de Saint Louis, has investigated the Tunisian legend of Saint Louis.1 Demeerseman, a member of the Pères Blancs (White Fathers), an order of missionary priests originally based in North Africa, collected and analyzed several accounts of the legend. As the sole study to date, his research is an important starting point for further investigation of the legend-one that is intricately involved with Tunisia's colonial period, the relations between Christianity and Islam, and unsettled tensions between Tunisia and Europe. In this article I revisit the legend and its criticism in what was for me, a medievalist, an unexpected stumble into folklore.2\n\nDemeerseman's Study\n\nDemeerseman charted the different versions of the legend, using what he believed were the six central elements..."
