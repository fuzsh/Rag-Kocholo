        "text": "I was born in 1214 in France. Twelve years later I became king. My mother acted as regent and taught me how to rule. At the time, many Christian knights went on Crusades to the Holy Land to win over the Muslim ruler. I led a Crusade twice, but both times I was defeated. In France, I built orphanages, libraries and hospitals. I also founded the University of Sorbonne in Paris. As a ruler, I opposed poverty and worked to bring peace by seeking justice for all. I simplified court bureaucracy, established fair laws and changed the tax system. I died in 1270, when I was 56 years old."
