N2 - Crown at twelve years old, Louis IX reigned for more than forty years, before disappearing in Tunis during the eighth crusade. The memory of this devout king, sensitive to good morals and justice, made him a romantic figure of the Middle Ages. But the crusade of Saint Louis has marked its time and the minds far beyond France, his religious piety as impressive as his Egyptian jailers. He will be the last king of France to be canonized.
