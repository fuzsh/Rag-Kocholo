"This book provides a unique approach to understanding Voegelin by looking at how he read both ancient and modern thinkers and how these thinkers, in turn, influenced Voegelin's own thought. By seeing how Voegelin read past political thinkers, we can see how Voeglein's own thought is indebted and yet differed from Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Hobbes, Weber, and Kelsen."

Lee Trepanier, Professor of Political Science, Samford University

"This collection fills an important gap concerning the work of Eric Voegelin: how did Voegelin engage over the course of his scholarly lifetime with his major philosophical interlocutors? What enduring influences did these thinkers have on his work?"
