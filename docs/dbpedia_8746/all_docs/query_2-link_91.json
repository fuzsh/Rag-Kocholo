        "text": "Voegelin: What does the surname Voegelin mean?\n\nThe last name Voegelin is derived from the German surname Vögelin, which means “little bird” or “small bird.” It can refer to a person who has the characteristics of a small bird, such as being light, lively, and quick. It could have originally been a nickname for someone who was particularly nimble, knowledgeable, or constantly chirping away.\n\nThe surname Voegelin has a long history, appearing in records dating back to medieval Germany before the 1500s. It was primarily found in southern Germany and some parts of Austria. Today, the surname is spread across the world, with the highest concentrations being found in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany.\n\nThe name Voegelin was also the surname of the twentieth-century American philosopher Eric Voegelin, and its spelling has become increasingly anglicized over the years. He was best known for his analysis of political ideologies, and much of his work has had long-reaching implications in the fields of political science and philosophy since its publication in the early 20th century. His writings continue to influence many today.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nVoegelin: Where does the name Voegelin come from?\n\nThe last name Voegelin is most commonly found in Germany, Switzerland and Austria.

The current population of Voegelins in the United States is estimated to be nearly 4,000.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Voegelins are found mostly in England, followed by Scotland and Wales. This British variant of the name is a result of the many German families who emigrated to the country in the 19th century and later, in the 1930s.\n\nVoegelins can also be seen in Russia, Australia, Canada, and other countries. It is a widely spread last name, and much of this can be attributed to the migratory nature of its bearers.\n\nVariations of the surname Voegelin\n\nVoegelin is a German surname that is derived from the Old High German word \"vogal,\" meaning \"kind of wood,\" and \"heiligen,\" meaning \"holy.\" This indicates that the original bearer of the name was a woodsman by profession, one who was thought to have religious attributes.\n\nVariants of the name Voegelin include Vogelin, Vogelen, Vogelian, Vogelann, Vogelina, Vogelinavogelin, Vogelinna, Vogelmann, Fogleman, Foglemanen, Foglemann, Foglemunn, Vogelman, Vogelmanen, Vogelmannn, Voegele, Voegelen, Voegelinen, Voegelmann, Voegelmannen, Voegelmannton, Voeglem, Voegleman, Voeglemann, Voglman, and Vogleman.\n\nSurnames of the same origin include Vهglait, Voegtlin, Vogtlin, Vogelink, Vogelinck, Voglić, Voglík, Voglík.\n\nAll of these surnames are associated with a woodsman or hunter of some kind, and their migratory history can be traced from medieval times in an area what is now Germany.
