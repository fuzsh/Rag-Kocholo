        "text": "“What is truth?” — Pontius Pilate\n\n“Truth is such a flyaway, such a slyboots, so untransportable and unbarrelable a commodity, that it is as bad to catch as light.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nPilate and Emerson were prophets: truth is slipping away from us.\n\nWe’ve heard for a while about “alternative facts” and “post-truth politics.” Those who promoted those expressions, at least at first, were complaining about Donald Trump. But he seems comparatively old-fashioned, a figure out of real estate promotion, pro wrestling trash talk, and stand-up comedy. His stories are a personal performance, which seems a milder affair than the radical unreality of much of today’s public life.\n\nCompare a Trump speech with the “Russian collusion” affair or the campaign to discredit the Hunter Biden laptop. Leading politicians, elite journalists, and once-admired federal agencies, presenting themselves as serious and ethical people, worked together—with no concern for truth or fear of consequences—to construct or suppress explosive claims about misconduct in the inner circles of two presidential campaigns.\n\nHere we are dealing not with everyday falsehoods but with loss of a conception of truth as anything beyond a story constructed for a purpose—self-interest, self-justification, political commitment, hatred of enemies, loyalty to friends, general usefulness.\n\nNone of this is exclusive to one side of the political divide. But the left dominates journalism, academia, and most government agencies, so they’re best placed to make their stories count as real among educated and seemingly informed people. And they’re progressive, which means that following the direction of developments is for them a basic principle of life. So, if the arc of history is bending toward the disintegration of truth, that is the direction they will go. What would give them a principle that tells them otherwise?\n\nConcrete elements of the current situation have been around for a long time. Politicians lie and politics itself, especially mass democratic politics, have always involved a great deal of mythmaking. But intelligent politicians have generally taken Mark Twain’s advice to heart: “Get your facts first, and then you can distort ’em as much as you please.”\n\nIn contrast, recent politicians have tended to take their myths literally. It’s been a long time since we had a president who could be called a sober realist with a thought-through strategy. The collapse of the Soviet Union seemed to eliminate the need. Why worry about reality when we can get our way regardless? Trump may have had a businessman’s concern for how a deal would actually work, but that’s not a strategy.\n\nOur attempts to spread freedom and democracy through revolution and military force provide disastrous examples. After all, the thought seems to have been, America, Western values, and liberal democracy are what is good politically. But all men are equal, which means they all want the same good things we want. So why not get rid of the bad people who are keeping them from getting them by war in Afghanistan and revolution in Libya and Ukraine? What could go wrong?\n\nIt didn’t work, of course, but when was the last time a politician, journalist, or “expert” lost credit for being wrong? It seems enough to his audience and colleagues that they like the kind of story he tells. The public too has lost its connection to reality: our leaders lead us as we like to be led.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nAn obvious reason is national success and prosperity. It’s gone to our heads, and we think we can do anything. Another is the electronic fantasies we inhabit. People are living more and more by social media, digital pop culture, and now increasingly AI, in virtual worlds made up of transitory images and soundbites that can be assembled to make anything at all seem true. That trend had already begun with the advent of the mass press and then radio, the cinema, and TV, but recent developments have radicalized it.\n\nAs a result, people have come to believe that nothing is fixed, everything is a social construction, and propaganda and marketing backed by political power can do anything. If so, why not inhabit and support politically whatever imagined world we prefer? I can’t help but believe such a tendency is behind today’s growing social radicalism, which now insists that a man who says he is a woman is truly a woman.\n\nOur leaders do nothing to bring us down to earth. That includes our intellectual leaders, who combine claims of authority based on objective expertise with substitution of politics for the disinterested search for truth. At the same time, the quest for grants and other forms of careerism has notoriously led to academic plagiarism, fraud, widespread failure of “scientific” studies to replicate, and research designed to tell influential people what they want to hear.\n\nSuch tendencies have further injured the usefulness of expert guidance. To make matters worse, temptations to intellectual corruption line up with theories about truth that have acquired widespread influence. These theories tell us that there is no Truth, only “regimes of truth” based on a picture of the world that serves the interests of some group, which promotes it to increase its power.\n\nSo there is my truth and your truth. There are also feminist and indigenous epistemologies that supposedly promote the interests of women and indigenous people, and epistemological racism that goes the other way. Everyone can get in on the act, so right-wingers now complain about woke epistemology, and if they are comparatively young they denounce the “boomer truth regime” set up after the Second World War that (they say) was intended to prevent a return of fascism but has ultimately made progressivism impossible to resist.\n\nHow do we escape the swamp of unreality? It’s evident that there are indeed “regimes of truth”—systems of required belief that have no necessary connection with reality. And in a wholly secular world, these systems will generally be justifications for rule by particular people and institutions. If there are no standards that transcend this-worldly purposes, life becomes a battle of wills, and claims about the Good, Beautiful, and True become opportunistic maneuvers.\n\nThe basic problem we all face is that truth is not inscribed on the world in a way that allows us simply to read it off. We need to observe, classify, and interpret, as well as distinguish the genuine from the spurious. These activities have a personal element and involve reliance on others, and so, inevitably, do our ideas about what is true.\n\nIt seems to follow that confidence in truth involves confidence in people and a society we can rely on. And since truth transcends us those people and that society must have a transcendent aspect. Justified confidence in truth must, therefore, involve something very much like divine revelation. And that, I suppose, is what is behind what Christ said to Pilate:\n\nFor this was I born, and for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. (John 18:37-38)\n\nIn the secularizing period before the Second Vatican Council, many people had the optimistic impression that man had “come of age” and attained full independence. Even if revelation was still needed our reliance on it did not have to be explicit: in a culture like ours, permeated by the spirit of the Gospel, anonymous Christians and men of good will could carry us through."
