He saw Israel as being at a complex intersection between the cyclical history of city states and the more unilinear history of empires, including “ecumenic” empires which at once promoted and comprised a universal truth.

Like many other modern political theorists, he fails to see that Christianity, in a Platonic lineage, achieved with Augustine and (to a degree) Medieval practice, a democratisation of the antique coincidence of humanity with citizenship, rather than its apolitical modification or abandonment.
