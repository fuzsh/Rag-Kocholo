        "text": "My presentation \"Essentials of Integral Politics\" held at this year's Integral European Conference (IEC) in Siofok/Hungary is now online as episode 26 in our Pioneers of Politics series: https://lnkd.in/eStiKNWV It outlines the need for an upgrade of our democratic politcal cultures and systems based on integral conscousness. I have summarized the essentials of this new paradigm of understanding and doing politics in the form of 10 basic principles: Integral Politics… 1. integrates more perspectives, in particular inner dimensions; 2. is based on a developmental understanding of political action logics; 3. works with states of presence and awareness; 4. is grounded in spirituality: connected with all living beings; 5. serves a higher purpose, the common good, that transcends particularistic perspectives; 6. translates the integral understanding of the nature of human beings into corresponding structures, institutions and politics; 7. walks its talk by translating theory into experiential praxis; 8. acts with lightness and playfulness; 9. rethinks agency on the basis of a quantum social science paradigm; 10. offers space for not-knowing and emergence. This new paradigm is spelled out in more detail in my/our book \"Foundations, Principles and Inspirational Resources of Integral Politics\".
