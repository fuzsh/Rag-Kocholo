McKnight\n\nThis collection of essays explores the development of Eric Voegelin's distinctive approach to politics and history from its early formulation in the 1930s to its culmination in the 1980s. The essays are grouped into four parts, which are organized along both chronological and thematic lines. The first part offers a detailed analysis of Diepolitischen Religionen (1938). Until recently, this early work was not readily accessible and, consequently, has not received the careful scrutiny it deserves. Now, however, it is available both in a standard German edition and in English translation. Essays in this section situate the development of Voegelin's concept of political religions within the immediate political circumstance of National Socialism as well as within the prevailing theoretical and methodological trends of the 1920s and 1930s. The second set of essays builds upon the analysis provided in the first section by demonstrating the value of concepts and methods introduced in Die politischen Religionen for understanding recent political and historical developments. Essays in this section examine the merits of Voegelin's critique of apocalyptic and gnostic elements of modern spiritual and political disorder. The third group of essays moves the focus of attention from pivotal developments in Voegelin's early work to an examination of Voegelin's magnum opus, Order and History. Essays in this section assess Voegelin's contribution to biblical and classical studies and analyze the theoretical and methodological developments which Voegelin's work undergoes from the History of Ideas project to the first three volumes of Order and History and, finally, to the crucial period from 1958-74 when Voegelin was making major theoretical and methodological revisions, which substantially altered the subjects treated in volumes 4 and 5. The fourth set of essays provides an extended discussion and analysis of a relatively recent development in Voegelinian scholarship: the application of Voegelin's theory of symbolization and his philosophy of history to literary and cultural criticism. Essays in this part discuss Voegelin's 'implicit' theory of literature, demonstrate Voegelin's use of literary sources in his analysis of both\n\n18\n\nPOLITICS , ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nclassical and modern culture and compare Voegelin's approach to recent trends in cultural criticism. Having identified the four main areas of investigation, let me explain how the individual essays contribute to the analysis offered in each part. Part I: Die politischen Religionen The focus of this section is on Voegelin's concept of political religions. The first essay, taken from Peter J. Opitz's introduction to the new (1993) German edition of Voegelin's Die politischen Religionen, begins with a question that all the essays in this section seek to address. As Opitz asks: 'Is it possible to commence a reconstruction of Voegelinian thought from this short essay, which appeared more than half a century ago—especially since the author himself did not assign the essay a prominent position among his works, and did not retain the concept of political religions in his subsequent work?' Opitz's response is that this work merits careful consideration because it was written during the time when the great ideological mass movements of the twentieth century were in full force; and Die politischen Religionen, like Voegelin's work as a whole, is first and foremost an effort to understand the origins and vitality of these movements. Die politischen Religionen is also valuable because it sets out Voegelin's criticism of the functionalist, positivistic approach to political science, and introduces seminal elements of Voegelin's highly original and distinctive contribution to twentieth-century political theory. The second essay in this section is by Sandro Chignola, who provides a detailed analysis of the pragmatic political circumstances and the theoretical and methodological assumptions of political science in the 1920s and 1930s. Chignola's essay situates Die politischen Religionen around the specific topics and issues which set Voegelin at odds with his mentor Hans Kelsen, as well as with two of the most prominent political theorists of the day, Carl Schmitt and Max Weber. Chignola then develops the circumstances that forced Voegelin to abandon the 'science of law' and to move toward a more philosophical/historical interpretation of political symbols. This theoretical and methodological transition, which begins with Die politischen Religionen, Chignola maintains, sets Voegelin in the direction of an original philosophy of consciousness centred on the experience of order and the process of symbolization of history, which finds its fullest expression in Order and History. The third essay, by Klaus Vondung, demonstrates that Voegelin's Die\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\npolitischen Religionen treated National Socialism as a prototypical manifestation of a form of political religion which envisioned an apocalyptic purge of the filth and evil of the world by the agents of purity and light. In Die politischen Religionen, Voegelin maintained that there is a core human religious experience that can be expressed in two forms: in transcendent religions like Judaism and Christianity, and in 'earthly' religions in which a mundane entity is elevated to the status of the realissimum. After establishing the core elements of National Socialist political religion, Vondung contrasts the Judaeo-Christian and the Nazi apocalypses. In the JudaeoChristian apocalypses, the agent of the liberation from evil oppression is God, and the state of perfection longed for is to be found in a heavenly Jerusalem. In the Nazi apocalypse it is not God who intervenes to implement world judgment; rather, the task of accomplishing salvation is accorded to the Volk, the earthly embodiment of the true, everlasting community. Consequently, the longed-for state of perfection is not presented as a heavenly Jerusalem but as an earthly salvation through the state, led by its political messiah. Vondung then offers textual evidence to confirm that apocalyptic transmutation was at the core of National Socialism, citing the writings of Hitler and Goebbels. Particularly significant is Vondung's argument that this immanentized apocalyptic vision is a key to understanding the vilification of the Jews that leads to blood purification and ultimately to the Holocaust. The fourth essay, by Claus-Ekkehard Barsch, continues the analysis of National Socialism as political religion. Barsch provides a detailed reading of key texts that helped to shape National Socialism, beginning with the poet Dietrich Eckart (1865-1923) and moving to the writings of Goebbels, Himmler and Goering. Barsch's analysis expands the discussion initiated by Vondung of the apocalyptic symbols of the Third Reich: the Volk as the chosen race, Hitler as messiah, and the Jews as the source of satanic evil. The fifth and final essay in this section, by Gilbert Weiss, examines the theoretical and methodological issues occupying Voegelin's attention during the period between 1938 and 1959, the period between the publication of Die politischen Religionen and the early volumes of Order and History. Rather than relying on a cursory overview of Voegelin's numerous publications during this time, Weiss focuses his analysis on Voegelin's correspondence with his friend, the eminent philosopher/phenomenologist Alfred Schiitz. Weiss gives particular attention to their discussions of Husserl's phenomenology and how Voegelin attempted to move beyond the\n\n20\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nimpasse he felt marred Husserl's work. Weiss demonstrates that the correspondence provides valuable insight into the period in which Voegelin was setting aside his planned six-volume history of political ideas and was beginning work on the brief book, The New Science of Politics (1952), and was about to launch the much larger project, Order and History. Through the correspondence, Weiss is able to show how key issues kept recurring and how Voegelin attempted to develop a theoretical framework adequate to handle the growing body of empirical data. Part II: Political Religions in a Secular Age This section builds upon the analysis in the preceding section by examining the validity of key concepts introduced in Die politischen Religionen for analyzing current issues in philosophy, political science and history. The first essay, by Stefan Rossbach, examines the questions and issues that Voegelin was attempting to address which led him to employ the term 'gnosticism' to describe certain varieties of modern political disorder. According to Rossbach, Voegelin applied the term 'gnosticism' to political ideologies that stubbornly refused to recognize human frailty and limitation and proposed to transform the human condition through human agency guided by human knowledge. Rossbach then presents his argument that the phenomena that Voegelin identified as characteristic of political movements in the first half of the century apply equally well to the Cold War and its continuing consequences. Rossbach's analysis shows that the USSR is another example of the kind of totalitarian regimes analyzed by Voegelin. Like other political religions, communism transforms the state into the ultimate source of meaning and purpose and sees itself as the agent of historical progress. Also, like the apocalyptic political religions analyzed by Vondung, the USSR reduced the complexities of international relations and world history into a battle between the powers of darkness and light. The most original element of Rossbach's analysis of the Cold War is his discussion of the gnostic tendencies of the United States. To develop his argument Rossbach examines the Cold War situation through the writings of one of the key participants: George F. Kennan, a senior diplomat and policy analyst. Through a careful examination of Kennan's situation, Rossbach describes the ossification of Cold War strategies into gnostic ideology whereby each side created a Manichaean dualism in which the forces of light were compelled to fight the forces of darkness. The second essay, by Geoffrey L. Price, also explores the merits and\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\napplicability of Voegelin's concept of gnosticism to contemporary civilizational analysis. Price takes issue with scholars who contend that the concept was appropriate in the political climate of the first half of the century but of limited value in the post-Cold War era. According to these scholars, Voegelin himself acknowledged the limits of the usefulness of the concept and, therefore, employed it far less frequently in his later writings. Price readily concedes that Voegelin's later writings identify several forms of political and spiritual disorder which derive from Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, apocalypticism and magic. Price argues, however, that these elements serve only to widen the scope of Voegelin's analysis and do not diminish the central role Voegelin gives gnosticism as a defining component of Western civilizational history. To substantiate his contention, Price traces the centrality of the concept from Voegelin's History of Political Ideas through The New Science of Politics to the final two volumes of Order and History, The Ecumenic Age (1974) and In Search of Order (1987). Price gives particular attention to the fourth volume, The Ecumenic Age. In this penultimate volume, Voegelin examines the breakdown of cosmological myth, the disorder accompanying the ecumenic empires, the reification of philosophy, the dogmatization of religion, and the proliferation of esoteric religions, including ancient Gnosticism. Price's analysis of the philosophical and religious events of the ecumenic age leads him to conclude that the distinctive character of modern political and spiritual disorder is rooted in the philosophical and religious derailments of the ecumenic age. Price stresses, however, that the origins of metastatic faith and apocalyptic dreams of innerworldly fulfilment do not appear first during the ecumenic age. They arise in Israel between the ninth and seventh centuries BCE. Price then argues that the analysis of the origins and proliferation of this longing to escape historical existence remained a central element in Voegelin's work from the 1940s through the 1980s. Price's textual examination leads him to conclude that Voegelin employed 'gnosticism' as the generic term to identify various expressions of the metastatic longing to escape reality. The concept of gnosticism, therefore, remains central to Voegelin's work and cannot be moved to the margins as some scholars have attempted. The third essay in this section, by Barry Cooper, employs Voegelin's concept of political religion to illuminate core issues in contemporary Canadian politics. In Cooper's assessment, the issues behind the Canadian political debate have to do with the nature of sovereignty and autonomy for both the federalist Canadian politicians and the separatist Quebec\n\n22\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nmovement. In his view, both sides have abandoned objective, empirical grounds for their stances and have moved into the realm of political myth. The federalist nationalists find hope for the future in a 'renewed federalism' and justify their aspirations with a myth of 'the two founding peoples'. According to Cooper, the notion of two founding peoples was invented in the heat of the Quebec provincial election campaign during the late nineteenth century. This myth, underscoring the dual personality of the Canadian people, continues to be prevalent and marches on through history untroubled and untouched by later events such as Eastern European and non-European immigration, the addition of other colonies and territories and the settlement of the west. Indeed, the myth overcomes even prior historical realities such as the existence of human beings already living in societies of various kinds prior to the arrival of Europeans in the territory later called 'Canada'.\n\nCooper devotes fuller discussion to the myth of Quebec nationalism. The central myth is that of an 'ethnic garrison', which Cooper traces to the middle of the nineteenth century in historical writings and in popular novels. In this myth the Canadian French are presented as being oppressed by the demonic English but eventually gaining liberty through the superior quality of their character. Cooper follows this analysis with a comparison of the principal characteristics of a political religion as identified by Voegelin in Die politischen Religionen and the features of Quebec nationalism. The fourth essay in this section, by S.N. Eisenstadt, offers another perspective on the Gnostic and apocalyptic religious foundations of Western civilization. Eisenstadt, a comparative sociologist, traces these developments to a stage of civilizatiorial history that Karl Jaspers referred to as the 'axial period'. The 'axial age' denotes the period of theological and philosophical eruptions occurring throughout the world between the twelfth century BCE to the third century CE. During this period, widespread spiritual eruptions led to a fundamental differentiation between the transcendent order of reality and the mundane order. In all civilizations the effort was made to model the mundane order insofar as possible in relation to the transcendent. But there was the recognition of the imperfectability of man and therefore of the limitation on the possibility of a complete implementation of the full dimensions of the transcendent within the mundane. While this was the predominant view, alternative visions also developed which rebelled against the notion of reconciling the mundane, social sphere with the transcendent. These rebellions took three basic\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nforms during the axial period. One was the re-formulation of the tension between the transcendent and mundane orders, as in the case of the Buddhist re-formulation of the premises of Hinduism and the Christian re-formulation of the premises of Judaism. Another alternative vision promulgated the return to a compact chthonic or cosmological existence. A third vision concerned the quest to merge the transcendental into the mundane; the Gnostic effort was one such attempt. Efforts of this type often combined attempts to implement its vision with the wider social movements of social protest, and attempted to overcome or supersede the predicaments and limitations of human existence. The result was the emergence in the axial civilizations of Utopian visions of an alternative, better order beyond the given one, a new social and cultural order that would be constructed according to the precepts of the higher transcendental order and which would negate and transcend the given one. According to Eisenstadt, this third, Gnostic, type came to constitute the central component in the crystallization of modern civilization as it developed in the Enlightenment and in the great European revolutions. The crystallization and institutionalization of this programme continued from the eighteenth century and expanded from Western Europe to the Americas, Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa. Eisenstadt's studies, therefore, confirm and expand Voegelin's analysis of modern Western civilization as deriving from religious impulses that contain immanentized forms of apocalyptism and Gnosticism. The fifth and final essay in this section is my own contribution. My intent is to examine Voegelin's contributions to twentieth-century study of civilizational history. My analysis is framed in relation to three fundamental issues. The first is what Arnold Toynbee referred to as the problem of'the intelligible field of historical study'. This issue, while always a basic one, became acute during the extraordinary expansion of data on some 26 known civilizations. While these empirical data provided an unprecedented wealth of facts, they did not automatically translate into wealth of insight. Before the wide-ranging data could be integrated into a coherent whole, the essential or primary field had to be established. The second major issue centred on the question of the appropriate method of historical analysis. This issue was framed more specifically as the question of how to conduct a 'scientific' study of history. The third major issue centred on the search for the meaning of history. The problem that the twentieth-century historians faced was that the linear, progressivist patterns employed in the nineteenth century were shattered by totalitarianism\n\n24\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nand two World Wars. While the breakdown of the progressivist constructions posed fundamental problems, it also opened the possibility of developing a theoretically sound and empirically based science of history. My intent is to demonstrate that Voegelin greatly advanced the understanding of the primary field of historical study through his analysis of symbolizations of order as they unfolded in historical societies. Voegelin argued that the historical field of study must include such diverse phenomenon as concrete political orders, events in philosophical consciousness, messianism and apocalypticism. Adequate analysis, Voegelin argued, requires the examination of the total configuration of order, that is, both the pragmatic and the spiritual events, which shape an epoch. Voegelin also made another key contribution by re-establishing the meaning of a 'science' of politics and history by demonstrating that the method must be appropriate to the subject, and that the subject of historical science is the symbolizations of order as they unfold in history. Part III: Order and History. Themes and Variations This section, as the title indicates, focuses on Voegelin's major work, Order and History. One aim is to assess Voegelin's contribution to classical philosophy and biblical religion. Another aim is to present some current reflections upon the philosophical, theoretical and methodological issues at the foundations of Voegelin's analysis of civilizational order and disorder. The first essay, by Bernhard W. Anderson, takes as its task a consideration of Voegelin's Israel and Revelation in light of the vast changes in the field of biblical studies over the last generation. He begins by noting that when Voegelin immersed himself in biblical studies, the field was most influenced by Gerhard von Rad and W.F. Albright. Von Rad maintained that the subject of Old Testament theology is not pragmatic history but the history of traditions, that is, a study of how the Israelite story, found in core confessions of faith, were appropriated and made present in the changing circumstances of Israel's historical journey. Albright, too, maintained that Israel's faith is not based upon creedal formulations but upon the recital of the mighty acts of God—crucial events including guidance of the ancestors, exodus from Egypt and taking of the 'promised land'. Voegelin's work, drawing upon both traditions but especially von Rad's, interpreted the history of Israel as a history of symbolization from Moses, through the Israelite experience with monarchy, on to the emergence of\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nChristianity out of Judaism. With his philosophical accent, Voegelin drew a distinction between the transcendental order of the Kingdom of God and the mundane affairs with which the historian or political scientist deals. Anderson then notes that the current generation of scholars have revolted against the dominance of history and the historical method and have adopted methodologies that deal with the biblical text rather than a history behind the text. Anderson cites as an example Walter Brueggemann's Theology of the Old Testament, which dismisses the historical critical method as a legacy of the Enlightenment and its Cartesian epistemology. Anderson notes, however, that Voegelin's work is not fundamentally invalidated by the fate of historical criticism, because Voegelin is not really interested in a sequence of crucial historical events charged with revelatory import. Voegelin is concerned with revelation in historical consciousness or in the psyche of sensitive persons like Moses, Jeremiah and Jesus—persons so attuned to the order of being that their souls are sensoriums of the transcendent. Anderson then moves to a comparison of Voegelin's approach with the sociological approach to biblical studies, which poses new challenges to the treatment of transcendence. Some sociologists, especially those influenced by Marxist studies, focus on the social dynamics of power and reduce theology to ideology, that is, to the attempt of the established powers to legitimate their authority and hold others in subjection. Liberation theology, a radical form of the sociological trend, focuses on the relation between order and freedom and views efforts at linking social order to the divine order of reality as part of the effort of the dominant majority to keep the disenfranchised minority under control. This pattern is obviously in opposition to Voegelin's, who gives divine warrant to order and is fearful of revolutionary expressions of human freedom that are aimed at taking power from the rich and established and distributing some of it to the poor and marginal. Anderson then moves to the next major trend in scholarship, the growing effort of Jews and Christians to work together on biblical texts and biblical history. Anderson notes that the title of Voegelin's foundational work, Israel and Revelation, gives prominence to Israel as a crucial contributor to the unfolding drama in human history. Nevertheless, Israel and Revelation's treatment of the thorny problem of the relation of Judaism to Christianity poses serious problems. This is because in a particularly problematic passage Voegelin attributes Talmudic Judaism with a failure to be the carrier of the truth of being for all humankind, owing to the inability\n\n26\n\nPOLITICS , ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nto get rid of its cultural mortgage, that is, of the territorial claim on the land of Canaan and its ethnic exclusivism that separates the Jewish community from the rest of humanity. Hence, in Voegelin's interpretation, the promise to Abraham, originally intended to include all humankind, was forfeited to Christianity, which was able to free the truth of being from land and Volk Anderson notes, however, that if Israel, as the carrier of revelation, was involved in defection from the truth of being because of participation in pragmatic history, the same must be said of Christianity. The Church, as the carrier of revelation, has boldly accommodated itself to the pragmatic history of nations, and has itself preserved some of the trappings of empire. A second problem Anderson finds with Voegelin's treatment of Israelite history is his dismissal of the royal covenant theology as a derailment. For Anderson, Voegelin's treatment fails to give proper weight to a symbolic pluralism in the tradition. The Old Testament contains three major patterns of symbolization: (1) the priestly symbolization of the tabernacle presence of God; (2) the Mosaic symbolism of the Mountain of God and the covenant formulary that governs Deuteronomy; and (3) the Davidic symbolism of monarchy and temple that is dominant in the Book of Psalms and the Chronicler's history. According to Anderson, each expresses distinctly the presence of the holy God in the people's midst and all are necessary to express in human speech the revelation of the holy God whose being is beyond the reach of human conceptuality but who is nevertheless 'God with us'. The final issue that Anderson takes up is the problem of Christology, which marks a fundamental point of difference between Judaism and Christianity. Here again, Anderson indicates that Voegelin's ontology focuses on a fundamental differentiation between Judaism and Christianity rather than providing a basis for a synthetic understanding. Nevertheless, Anderson concludes by noting that reading Israel and Revelation after all these years has helped him to see more clearly that there are two different ways of thinking christologically. Anderson, therefore, finds Voegelin's work not only useful in the present state of theoretical and methodological confusion, but also with regard to the deeper theological issues that are at the centre of the discussion between Jews and Christians regarding biblical history. The second essay in this section, by Moshe Idel, has two foci. The first is a comparative analysis of Voegelin's and Gershom Scholem's theories of\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n27\n\nreligion. The second is Voegelin's and Scholem's treatment of metastasis in post-biblical Judaism. In Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, published in 1941, Scholem enunciated his theory concerning a threefold evolution in matters of religion. Idel states that Scholem's work was known by Voegelin and indeed employed by him in his own major work, Order and History. To establish thematic parallels between Scholem and Voegelin, Idel quotes Scholem extensively, and then compares these passages with excerpts from Voegelin's Order and History. The first phase of religious development for both Scholem and Voegelin is the compact cosmological myth characteristic of the ancient Near Eastern mythologies, which are superseded by the process of differentiation that installed the historical form of existence characteristic of the Israelites. Idel points out that for Scholem, just as for Voegelin, the religious drama takes place in the deepening of the discovery of the distance between man and God at the second phase of religious development. Idel notes some important differences between Scholem's terminology and Voegelin's. Scholem describes humanity conceived in opposition to the transcendental being, while Voegelin deals always with the possibility of a noetic relationship between the two. Moreover, Voegelin's third phase, which is conceived as transcending the second one, assumes the dissolution of the communal compactness of Israel, and the discovery of the individual soul. For Scholem, mythology returns and plays a major role in the third stage of Judaism after it has been obliterated in the second one. The process of remythification of theology is a major characteristic of Scholem's view of Jewish mysticism in general. Idel notes that Voegelin, on the other hand, is not welcoming of such re-versions. Though Voegelin could accept the lingering of one form of religiosity into the other immediately following it, as is the case with the cosmological symbols that were accepted and transformed into the historical religion, the return of the first stage within the third one was conceived of as much more problematic. Before developing his critical analysis of this element of Voegelin's work, Idel introduces additional relevant material by discussing the views of Scholem and Voegelin on Gnosticism. According to Idel, both Scholem and Voegelin conceived Gnosticism as a critical factor in Western religion, influential much beyond its first historical manifestations in late antiquity. Both were concerned with the reverberations of Gnosticism in later phenomena in mediaeval and premodern Europe, though their attitudes to what they described as Gnosticism differed dramatically. Scholem\n\n28\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nconceived the Gnostic elements to be a positive element that fertilized stagnant Rabbinism; for Voegelin on the other hand, Gnosticism, with its metastatic proclivities, is a negative approach, which involves attempts at changing Being rather than understanding it. Drawing upon his observations on Voegelin's approach to Gnosticism and to his emphasis on the noetic dimension of religious experience, Idel moves to a critique of Voegelin's understanding of Judaism. It is Idel's opinion that Voegelin's approach, while attempting to be objective, is shaped by a Christian and Greek perspective which emphasizes the noetic dimension. To give a case citation, Idel looks at Voegelin's interpretation of God's divine name in Exodus 3. Idel says that the number of theological explanations of this divine name is huge, and that the decision to adopt one is therefore a dramatic decision by Voegelin, a choice that reveals the acceptance of an ultimately Greek metaphysical interpretation. Idel then cites an example of an alternative Jewish approach to this divine name. What is crucial in the Jewish interpretation is a 'moment of reciprocity'. Not only is God present with the people, but also the people are with God. In other words, the divine presence with the people is not an unchangeable order but depends upon the people's being with God. According to Idel, this view makes Judaism a living religion, and also calls into question the unilinear process of development found in Voegelin's volumes of Order and History. Idel says it is characteristic of Voegelin's approach that a certain religion has one main message and that religion remains unchanged. By emphasizing the noetic function of humanity as the highest one, and the sole one to best express the religious experience of the static ground of being, other aspects of humanity, and of religious life, are marginalized, and Israel is left as a biblical fossil rather than as a living religion. Having offered this criticism of Voegelin, Idel quickly points out that Voegelin's understanding of Judaism is shared by the two most influential scholars of Judaism in the twentieth century: Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem. This pervasive approach, he concludes, is part of the appropriation of visions of perfection inspired by Greek philosophy, on the one hand, and of the overemphasis on the importance of history, on the other. The third essay, by Zdravko Planinc, argues what is certain to be a highly controversial claim: It would seem that, from his first publication to his last, over a period of almost half a century, Voegelin frequently defends a cliched understanding of Plato's philosophy, and what is more, a cliched understanding that stands in opposition to both Voegelin's own account of the permanence of\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n29\n\nthe community of being and Voegelin's frequent praise of the lucidity of Plato's exploration and description of its quaternarian structure.\n\nPlaninc finds three fundamental problems underlying this predicament, first, there is a fundamental contradiction, and not a 'tension', between Voegelin's recognition of 'equivalences of experience and symbolization' within the order of the community of being, on the one hand, and Voegelin's use of unilinear or developmental schemes to order the data of human history, on the other. Secondly, the fundamental contradiction between these two aspects of Voegelin's work is only confused, and not clarified or resolved, by his frequent recourse to the distinction between 'compactness and differentiation'. Thirdly, Voegelin's frequently repeated claim that Plato was unable to transcend the boundaries of cosmos and polis is almost always supported with evidence from the Timaeus and Critias. This is problematic because Voegelin never fundamentally reconsidered his initial understanding of these two dialogues as expressed in the History of Political Ideas. According to Planinc, Voegelin's conventional scholarly account of the limits of Plato's philosophy—ultimately derived from Christian accounts of the inherent inability of pagans to transcend natural philosophy—even appears in the exegesis of the Timaeus in the concluding fifth volume of Order and History. Planinc begins his argument with a detailed textual analysis of Voegelin's essay, 'Plato's Egyptian Myth', published in 1953. This essay is taken from Voegelin's History of Political Ideas, which was abandoned in part due to Voegelin's study of Schelling, which led him to understand that the premises of this project were unsound in that they uncritically reflected modern assumptions concerning the progress of history. Planinc next turns to Order and History, arguing that the early volumes were ostensibly undertaken to rework the premises and analyses of the History of Political Ideas, but gives no evidence that its understanding of Plato had received substantive reconsideration. Planinc notes, for example, that while Voegelin admits, on the one hand, that Plato's 'dualism of the Erotes [is] closely related to the Christian dualism of amor Dei and amor sui', he also claims, on the other, that 'Plato's philosophizing remains bound by the compactness of the Dionysiac soul', a compactness which allowed neither 'mystical union with God, nor any other neo-Platonic or Christian developments'.\n\nAccording to Planinc, the preference for the Christian view is not expressly contained in the texts themselves, but reflects an ongoing prejudice on\n\n30\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nVoegelin's part in favour of Christian revelation and unilinear patterns of history. Planinc then turns his attention to the problem of the long delay separating the publications of volumes 3 and 4 of Order and History. In Planinc's view, the project of Order and History came to a standstill with the publication of volumes 2 and 3 in part because of the manner in which Voegelin continued to use Platonic materials from his History of Political Ideas. In Planinc's view, volume 4, which originally was projected to be a study of early Christianity and the New Testament, posed fundamental problems with regard to the relation of Platonic philosophy to gospel Christianity. According to Planinc, the results of Voegelin's efforts to deal with these issues, 'for all their brilliance and innovation, seem never to escape the interpretative dilemmas in which he found himself after publishing the first three volumes of Order and History. Planinc argues that Voegelin never returned to a thorough, systematic analysis of the Platonic dialogues in light of his emphasis on equivalences of experience and symbolization. Instead he offered many 'short, set-piece interpretations' of various sections of the dialogues; and while 'there is a flourishing of technical terms, ostensibly representing Plato's terminology, in Voegelin's own writings', unfortunately 'the proliferation of Platonic technical terms does not necessarily indicate better insight into the texts from which they are taken'. In order to explore the developments that separate volumes 3 and 4, Planinc turns to a series of articles and addresses prepared in the intervening period which treat the problem of equivalences and the relation of Platonic philosophy to gospel Christianity. These include 'Equivalences of Experience and Symbolization in History' (1970), remarks addressed to the Thomas More Institute in 1970 and subsequently published in Conversations with Eric Voegelin (1980), and 'The Gospel and Culture' (1971). In Planinc's judgment, the essays written after volume 3 are evidence of Voegelin's struggle with the conflict between conventional beliefs and the radical implications of studying the quaternarian structure philosophically, a struggle that results in a unique theoretical apparatus and vocabulary that allows him both to acknowledge equivalences and to discount them into conventionally accepted terms. Consequently, the Introduction to The Ecumenic Age is 'confusing and somewhat disingenuous: Voegelin criticizes himself for an error he had not made, and then presents as his recent theoretical advance the same error in a new form'. Commenting further on volume 4, Planinc notes that there are occasional traces of\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n31\n\nunderstanding of Plato as a man open to the revelation of divine reality in both of its 'fundamental modes—in the cosmos and as an ordering presence in the soul', and he finds that the final section of volume 5 of Order and History offers a discussion of Plato's Timaeus that reveals that Voegelin's own philosophy was closer to the philosophy of Plato than it was to Christian theology. Voegelin discovers in Plato his own struggles, and he presents Plato as struggling for language that will optimally express the analytic movements of existential consciousness within the limits of that of a fides of the cosmos. But even here, according to Planinc, Voegelin qualifies his interpretation of Plato and reduces his differentiation. This leads Planinc to conclude that 'the Plato of Voegelin's last published remarks is the Plato of his earliest published remarks, a philosopher with \"a less developed level of spirituality compared to that of the Christian era\", because it was \"as yet impossible\" for him to \"breach the bounds\" of cosmos and polls'. The fourth essay in this section, by Terry Barker and Larry Schmidt, is a direct response to the essay by Planinc. Through a detailed reading of Voegelin's writings from the 1930s through the 1980s, this paper argues that Voegelin's work does show a move away from the progressivist and developmentalist understandings of history towards an integrated classical and Christian political theory and philosophy of history. The specific issues that Barker and Schmidt address centre around Planinc's treatment of Voegelin's notions of'the primordial community of being...with its quaternarian structure', 'equivalences of experience and symbolization', and 'compactness and differentiation'. These three sets of terms, they argue, are severed from their context and from one another by Planinc and 'reassembled by him to articulate what Voegelin supposedly should have said about Plato's philosophy, or to explain why he didn't say it'. Barker and Schmidt begin their response by noting that The New Science of Politics of 1952 is where the first set of terms, 'compactness and differentiation', is introduced; that the second, the 'quaternarian structure of the primordial community of being', is presented in 'The Symbolization of Order', the Introduction to Israel and Revelation, the first volume of Order and History (1956); and that 'equivalences of experience and symbolization' is developed in concert with the other two in the essay 'Equivalences of Experience and Symbolization in History' (1970). According to Barker and Schmidt, these texts—considered together in the order in which they were produced—demonstrate the stages that Voegelin's theory undergoes in breaking from progessivist patterns of analysis. This articulation and the\n\n32\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nstages in which it unfolds played a crucial role in developing his 'histories', which serves as the basis for his new theory of consciousness and reality that is set out in the last stages of his work. Barker and Schmidt next turn to the break in programme announced by Voegelin in the introduction to volume 4 of Order and History, which appeared in 1974. Barker and Schmidt argue that the evidence shows that the long delay was not caused by problems with Voegelin's treatment of Plato; instead, it reflected the difficulty Voegelin had in dealing with historical materials related to the study of Christianity and its deformations. According to Barker and Schmidt, it was Voegelin's realization that it was no longer possible to characterize Christianity as a linearly conceived sequel to classic and Israelite experiences and symbolizations that caused him to rework the original programme of Order and History. To support their argument, Barker and Schmidt point to Voegelin's German book Anamnesis (1966), which deals with the theory of consciousness; and to his Candler Lectures at Emory University (1967), which discuss the nature of the revisions he needed to make in his analysis of classic and Christian civilizations in their relation to the crisis of modernity. Barker and Schmidt's most extended discussion involves the essay, 'Equivalences of Experience and Symbolization in History'. In this essay, Voegelin returns to his original focus on the problems of a constant in history and of equivalence. Here he states that there is no constant to be found in history, for the reason that the historical field of equivalences is not given as a collective of phenomena which could be submitted to the procedures of its abstraction and generalization. Indeed, history itself originates in the presence of the process when a truth of reality emerging from the depth recognizes itself as equivalent but superior to a truth previously experienced, so that the only thing that is constant is the process, which leaves a trail of equivalent symbols in time and space to which we can attach the conventional name of'history'. Barker and Schmidt conclude by stating that Planinc's understanding of Voegelin's use of the terms 'quaternarian structure of the primordial community of being', 'compactness and differentiation' and 'equivalences of experience and symbolization' is quite different from Voegelin's actual use of them. 'Our detailed examination of Voegelin's relevant theoretical texts revealed no lack of coherence in his terminology, no lack of candour in his acknowledgment of debt on a selective basis to classic, Christian and modern thinkers, and no evidence of deliberate obfuscation of his meaning.' The principal merit of these two essays is that they offer detailed link-\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n33\n\nings of texts and themes in Voegelin's work from the 1930s to the 1980s. The reader is not required to agree or disagree with either. The more productive use of them would be as resources for exploring the core of Voegelin's theoretical and methodological development as it moves from his History of Political Ideas through the various stages of Order and History. The fifth essay in this section, by M.W. Sinnett, begins by lamenting the paucity of informed criticism of Voegelin's scholarship: 'Specialist scholars, approaching Voegelin's treatment of a particular text with little or no knowledge of the breadth of vision that guides his explorations, often fall short of any genuine engagement with Voegelin, thus depriving us of all benefit from the mutual insights that might otherwise have been possible.' Voegelinian enthusiasts, on the other hand, 'being unwilling or unable to question their master's reading of basic texts, quickly find themselves helpless in the relentless sweep of Voegelin's exegesis, thus abandoning any hope of a critical approach to his work'. As a consequence, the former run the risk of an uninformed dismissal of Voegelin's work, while the latter, at best, contribute another item to the growing catalogue of 'Voegelinian hagiography'. What is needed at this stage, Sinnett declares, is the endeavour on the part of many scholars over a period of many years to explore in detail and in a relevant manner the empirical bases of Voegelin's writings. Sinnett then proposes to offer 'a small contribution to this vast undertaking'. Sinnett's analysis focuses on Plato's Symposium, which, Sinnett states, does not receive extended treatment in any of Voegelin's writings nor in the secondary literature on Voegelin. In approaching the Symposium, Sinnett underscores the importance of recognizing the dramatic element in the Platonic dialogues. The dialogues present the drama located in the human soul as it moves through the depths of consciousness, in an effort to explore the full range of human experience. As drama, they are also intended to draw the reader into a participatory exploration of the essential nature of existence. The subject of the Symposium is, of course, the nature of Eros. Sinnett notes that the dialogue opens with conventional encomia full of empty platitudes regarding love as the binding force in the polis. These speeches are followed by the burlesque of Aristophanes and the sophistry of Agathon, which serve to underscore the problematic nature of human knowledge, and to set the context for the exploration of the question of divine-human attunement as the foundation for the order of the soul and\n\n34\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nthe order of society. This exploration is presented in Socrates' account of his dialogue with the priestess Diotima, which introduces a new myth of Eros's genealogy. In this myth, the personified Eros is presented as being the product of Resource (Poros) and Poverty (Penia), so that Eros himself is at no time either resourceless or wealthy, but is always 'in the middle' between wisdom and ignorance. From this genealogy Diotima goes on to explain that neither the gods nor the ignorant are lovers of wisdom. The former already possess wisdom, and the latter, though they utterly lack it, are satisfied with themselves and have no desire for that with regard to which they feel no defect. Socrates then asks Diotima who the lovers of wisdom are, if they are neither the wise nor the ignorant. Diotima responds that they are the ones in-between the two, and one of them is Eros. There then follows a fuller articulation of the characteristics of these lovers of wisdom and their quest for beauty and truth. It is in the context of this dialogue, of course, that a symbol so integral to Voegelin's work, that of the metaxy or Cln-Between', is presented. It is also in this dialogue that the nature of the search in the 'In-Between' is articulated. It is underscored that wisdom is not the result of an accumulation of facts, but is an ongoing search in the form of participation in the drama of humanity. In exploring this dialogue, Sinnett is able to establish the fundamental connections in Voegelin's work between the symbols of 'participation', 'differentiation of experience and symbolization,' and 'the paradox of consciousness', all pertaining to the fundamental In-Between of human existence. The sixth and seventh essays in this section move the focus of the discussion from Platonic philosophy to gospel Christianity. The sixth essay, by William M. Thompson, examines Voegelin's essay 'The Gospel and Culture', which Thompson regards as especially useful for understanding Voegelin's views on Christ, Christianity and politics. In order to develop his lines of analysis, Thompson employs a Voegelinian approach to this Voegelin text. That is, he turns to the key symbols employed in the text and relates them to primary symbols in Voegelin's other writings. The primary symbol in 'The Gospel and Culture' essay is movement. For Thompson, it seems clear that Voegelin considers this term a key symbolism, even capitalizing it numerous times toward the essay's conclusion to indicate the one, common dynamism shared by the classical and Jewish-Christian traditions. In order to establish this common dynamism, Thompson offers a brief discussion of parallel symbols found in both traditions. Thompson refers\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n35\n\nto Voegelin's statement in The World of the Polls, the second volume of Order and History, that Heraclitus and Plato agree that no composition can lay claim to 'truth' unless it is authenticated by the movement of the psyche toward the sophon. This movement, in Thompson's words, 'includes struggle—think of the pulls and counterpulls of the noetic core, echoing especially Plato in Laws 645a—and at one point Voegelin even suggests the fruitfulness of a comparison with Zen mysticism in order to elucidate further \"the connection between love of the All-wise and [the] askesis of the warrior\" in Heraclitus'. The point of this discussion is that it establishes the emergence of a more differentiated soul which constitutes a new authority within society and history. For Thompson, the deliberate and repeated use of the phrase 'the gospel movement' indicates Voegelin's desire to evoke how Christ and Christianity are rooted in the metaxy of society and history, thus uncovering their point of connection with all of human existence. Thompson notes that it should not be surprising that Voegelin's philosophy of order and politics focuses on the sociopolitical implications of these 'spectacular breakthroughs in history', because this approach enables Voegelin, the political philosopher, to grasp the relevance of a consideration of Christ to political theory. While Voegelin wants to establish an essential point of convergence between the philosophical and Christian spiritual traditions, he also gives attention to the distinctiveness of the Christian. According to Thompson, there is no question that Voegelin regards the epiphany of Christ as the culmination of the millennial movement because it articulates ' the eminent truth of existential consciousness'. Or, said differently, Voegelin regards Christ and the gospel movement as the dramatic point at which consciousness becomes luminous to itself as the site of the revelatory process. This emphasis on the soul as the site of revelation differentiates the Christian revelatory experience from the noetic structure of Greek consciousness. Having noted this important distinctive characteristic of Christianity, however, Thompson stresses that the overriding emphasis of 'The Gospel and Culture' seems to be upon the fullness of Christ as the representative man, not upon Christ as the unique fullness. Thompson next relates the key symbolism of 'movement' to other key symbols in Voegelin's writing. He begins by reminding us of the importance of the symbol 'drama' throughout Voegelin's writings. Drama, especially tragedy, depicts the soul in the process of making decisions, and recalls the Heraclitean 'deep knowing' of the soul whose border cannot be measured because its logos is too deep. According to Thompson, the sym-\n\n36\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nbols of'movement' and 'drama' function like content and form in Voegelin's perspective. The point of the two symbols is to stress the fact that human beings are not spectators but participants in the community of being. As Voegelin stated in the Introduction to volume 1 of Order and History, humans are actors playing a part in the drama of being. This drama presupposes a tension between freedom and necessity and a human response to the mystery of existence. The fourth section of 'The Gospel and Culture' is permeated with the language of drama. Voegelin repeatedly emphasizes that the gospel movement is to be thought of as a drama. He speaks of the historical drama of revelation and states that it is far from alive in the Christianity of the churches today because of the separation of school theology from mystical or experiential theology and the drama's eclipse by Christian doctrine. He writes of the gospel drama with its dramatis personae of God and man. He seems to make a distinction between the gospel drama and the poet's work of dramatic art as well as the historian's biography of Jesus; but, as he draws the distinction, he goes on to write about the personal drama of Jesus in the gospel, the social drama of his followers, and its historical dimension inasmuch as this forms part of an ongoing tradition of experience and symbolization. Thompson then moves to the next key symbol, that of 'story'. This symbol is found especially in the final volume of Order and History. Here, according to Thompson, we find Voegelin writing of the 'necessarily storied and narrative character of human existence'. Voegelin writes: 'The story is the symbolic form the questioner has to adopt necessarily when he gives an account of his quest as the event of wresting, by the response of his human search to a divine moment, the truth of reality from a reality pregnant with truth yet unrevealed.' Thus, the story that Voegelin writes is both narrative and event. 'Narrative' points to how the story conveys insights into reality in the mode of intentionality or 'thingness'. 'Event' is Voegelin's special way of pointing to how the story, in a more comprehensive sense, is an event of luminosity within the in-between of existence. Narrative is narratively referential, while event is luminously symbolic. According to Thompson, Voegelin's Order and History displays a dramatic, narrative and perhaps even epic form. Commentators who concentrate on the 'order' dimension often miss this narrative quality. The attention to history, to how order only emerges from the struggle for it in history, is the more narrative and dramatic feature of Voegelin's project. Thompson then examines Voegelin's treatment of the Gospel of Matthew as evidence of the dramatic elements of the gospel movement. For\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n37\n\nThompson, Voegelin's interpretation of Matthew is particularly helpful in displaying how the gospel drama surfaces the theme of participation and emphasizes that knowing comes by way of participating. Revelation thus is knowing through participation—that is, it is an existential event which admits of varying levels of comprehension and enactment, depending upon the depths of one's own entry into the passion and resurrection of the pulls and counterpulls. The discussion of the various degrees of participation opens to view the possibility of a flawed or derailed manner of participation, or even a deliberate rebellion against the full depths of human consciousness. In this context Voegelin discusses both ancient and modern gnosticism as modes of derailed participation. In his concluding paragraphs Thompson, a theologian, credits Voegelin with establishing a philosophical or scientific approach to the study of human consciousness. In Thompson's view, a true science of consciousness involves a form of spirituality or mysticism, reflecting the formation through virtues of the knower. Voegelin's work is an invitation and even a challenge to philosophers and theologians to likewise undertake this challenge. Thompson adds that an appropriate next step for Voegelin students interested in the gospel movement would be to explore the trinitarian dimensions of the same, along with their implications for political order. There are some promising sources for this in Voegelin's works themselves, and this would be a way of challenging and expanding Voegelin's project from within. The seventh essay, by Michael P. Morrissey, reviews recent developments in New Testament studies. Morrissey notes that the current generation of scholarship has produced a proliferation of fields and sub-fields as well as a number of new methodologies. In order to make the scope of his assignment more manageable and in order to make it directly relevant to this volume, Morrissey narrows the focus to that area of New Testament studies dealing directly with the central figure, Jesus of Nazareth. More specifically, Morrissey takes as his point of departure the problematic in Christian theology that deals with the relation between the so-called 'historical Jesus' and the 'Christ of faith', a distinction that came to light in the nineteenth century with the rise of critical historical consciousness. Morrissey notes that no previous generation has seen so many scholars—stimulated by new archaeological discoveries, new analytic methodologies and new theories—preoccupied with the debate about who Jesus was and the proper categories by which to understand him. He then turns to an analysis of the work of six of the most influential contemporary scholars: E.P. Sanders, John Dominic Crossan, Marcus J. Borg, Burton L.\n\n38\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTOR\n\nMack, Robert W. Funk and John P. Meier. After his analysis of these six scholars, Morrissey indicates that he believes Voegelin would defend 'historical Jesus' research as a legitimate and necessary affair, insofar as the historical reconstruction of Jesus marks a post-Hegelian attempt to return from dogma to the reality of experience. However controversial the conclusions of these scholars, their work cannot be dismissed, for what they seek to do is salutary: to clear away the rubbish of false interpretations that have been laid over Jesus and the gospels, thus providing a fresh understanding of who Jesus was and what he was about. On the other hand, Voegelin would also likely note that the concentration on the positivistic approach, and on the empirically verifiable content of gospel Christianity, cannot get at the crucial issues concerning Christianity and its place in human history. Voegelin frequently stated that history is not the agglomeration of empirical data. History is made up of those epochal events that contain a new understanding of the fundamental nature of human existence. The study of the New Testament and of Jesus, therefore, if it is to have historical validity, must focus on Christianity's epochal character. Morrissey then turns to an assessment of some of the principal points developed by Voegelin from his early work in the 1940s through his last work in the 1980s. Morrissey notes that Voegelin focused on the emergence of Christianity as an epoch-making event due to its creation of a new community substance that grounds the civilization of the West. This was Voegelin's primary interest in his History of Political Ideas from the 1940s, because as a political scientist he was primarily interested in the host of problems caused by Christianity when its ritual substance and universalistic claims were absorbed into a world empire founded on a collection of diverse ethnic societies loosely held together by a hegemonic power organization but lacking any spiritual unity. This absorption yielded the classic conflict between the spiritual and temporal powers in political society. As Voegelin developed his analysis in the 1940s, he turned to the specialized studies available from biblical scholars. In his treatment, Voegelin aligned himself with the bulk of scholars who read the gospel as myth more than as history. Nevertheless, he argued that the personality of the historical Jesus does emerge in the miracle stories, in the parables and in the dialogue scenes. In his later work, according to Morrissey, Voegelin continued to explore the gospel's mythic accounts and argued that the Gospels are the unique symbolic form that the revelation of the Christ took in response to the theophany of the divine in him. In other words, according to Morrissey,\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n39\n\nthe Gospels serve as a narrative theology based on the pneumatic experiences of those first-century Jews who met and remembered the man they came to call the son of God. According to Morrissey, reading the Gospels with critical-historical eyes alone misses the point, because it misses the reason why they were composed and circulated in the first place and, perhaps more importantly, why Christianity became a defining event in the history of Western civilization. Therefore, while Voegelin would be interested in the new fields and methodologies in New Testament studies, he would be critical of any attempt to reduce the symbolic contents of Christianity to their historical details. As Morrissey says, to reduce the substance of the Gospels to their 'historicity' destroys the symbolic form of the myth, which for their anonymous authors was the proper expression of the vision of the divine in the metaxy mediated by Jesus. To ferret out the 'objective', factual core of the 'subjective' myth is inane, since it breaks apart the poles of the tension in religious experience.\n\nPart IV: Voegelin's 'Implicit' Theory of Literary and Modern Cultural Criticism This section examines how Voegelin's philosophy of consciousness and theory of symbolization relate to literary and cultural analysis. The first essay, by Eugene Webb, sets out what he describes as Voegelin's 'implicit theory of literature'. Voegelin's approach to literature is not concerned primarily with aesthetic issues; it is concerned with literature as a mode of expression of one of two fundamental forms of existence or orientations towards reality. Voegelin referred to these modes of existence as copen' and 'closed'. Open existence is the mode that consciously directs itself towards reality in all its dimensions, spiritual as well as material. Open existence, in other words, is openness to existence under the conditions of finitude. Closed existence is a tendency to close oneself to existence, to pull back from living with full consciousness of the ambiguities and uncertainties of existence. Literature expressing openness towards existence is best reflected in classical literature in Greek tragedy and then later in the Platonic dialogues. In The World of the Polls, Voegelin provides a detailed discussion of tragedy as a fundamental component in the ongoing search for truth that runs from Hesiod's cosmogonic myth to the Platonic dialogues. According to Voegelin, the truth of Greek tragedy is action itself, that is, action on the new, differentiated level of a movement in the\n\n40\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nsoul that culminates in the decision of a mature responsible person. The other form of literary expression articulates the conditions of closed existence, that is, the stubborn refusal to accept the full range of human experience and the subsequent attempt to construct a second reality. Webb briefly discusses two examples from Voegelin's work. The first is his analysis of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. When his friend and colleague Robert B. Heilman first introduced Voegelin to this work in 1947, Voegelin thought James was expressing a deeply rooted will to self-salvation, growing out of a secularized version of America's Puritan heritage. In 1970, after further reflection, Voegelin became persuaded that the symbols were not so readily transparent; that, in fact, they represent a modern form of literature that expresses an existential dimension of closed existence. As the process of closure gains momentum, the symbols of open existence— God, humanity, the divine origins of the cosmos, and the divine logos permeating its order—lose the vitality of their truth and are eclipsed by the imagery of a self-creative and self-saving ego confronted with an immanently closed world. In contrast to classical tragedy, which had the function of eliciting in its audience a clear awareness of the existential issues underlying people's lives, the latter form of literature merely gave articulate form to the confusions of its age and helped to keep its reader bound by them. Webb stresses that Voegelin did not dismiss all of modern literature as an expression of confusion or closure to existence. He cites as an example Voegelin's comments on Baudelaire's prefatory poem to his Fleurs du maly which develops a deliberate parody of Plato's philosophical myth in which man is depicted as a puppet pulled by diverse cords and drawn by the divine cord of noetic reason. Baudelaire transforms this image so that it is not God pulling humanity through divine reason but Satan enchanting us and vaporizing, through a sort of reverse alchemy, our capacity for reasonableness and responsible decision. Voegelin contrasted Baudelaire to Hegel, who Voegelin thought consciously rejected the Platonic view of human dependency and created a countermyth of human self-divinization. Baudelaire, Voegelin stated, by contrast did not symbolize the balance of consciousness but, on the contrary, expressed the consequences of its loss. Baudelaire had experienced the man of his time as being engaged in the sorcery of self-divinization. Baudelaire himself lived through the Satanic situation without letting it impair his intellectual order. While Webb underscores the emphasis Voegelin gives to the didactic purpose of literature, he warns against regarding Voegelin as a rigid moral-\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n41\n\nizer. Webb stresses the point that Voegelin's position was one of openness. The openness he advocated is receptive to participation in a reality that is always ready to receive the full range of human experience. Voegelin's openness is one of discovering a genuine fulfilment that can satisfy the deep appetite for existence underlying all of our other desires. To come to realize where our true satisfaction lies is what makes it possible to become truly ourselves and to realize genuine freedom in the decision for open existence. This openness to existence is the point of origin of another characteristic feature of Voegelin's implicit theory of literature: its emphasis on dialogue as an element of open existence, as opposed to monologue, which turns within itself. The main issues identified as elements of Voegelin's implicit theory of literature by Webb are treated in detail in the three other essays in this section. The next essay, by Jack E. Trotter, offers a Voegelinian examination of Greek tragedy as a primary reflection of the developing consciousness of political order and disorder in the Greek polis. Trotter, like Webb, begins by explaining that Voegelin's interest in tragedy is not as a form of literature but rather as a mode of expressing the state of openness or closure to the full range of human experience. Trotter therefore provides an overview of the move from the epic poetry of Homer through the three main stages of Greek tragedy to the Platonic dialogues. Trotter's analysis includes a discussion of Aeschylus's The Suppliants and follows Voegelin's discussion of the Platonic dialogues as a form of tragedy. The link between the two very different literary genres is that each represents a mode of exploration of the structure of the soul. Trotter next compares Voegelin's work to postmodern literary theory, especially to the highly influential work of Rene Girard. After providing a brief, balanced overview of the strengths and weaknesses in both Voegelin's and Girard's work, Trotter turns to the essential differences in their approaches. Again, these differences are not at the level of aesthetics but rather reflect fundamentally different views of human nature and society. Girard's analysis is ultimately based on the ideology of postmodernism. Through brief but pointed examples, Trotter demonstrates that the ideological underpinnings of Girard's position are in conflict with empirical studies by ethnographers and anthropologists, while Voegelin's theory is commensurable with the emerging empirical data. The third essay in this section, by Robert A. Watson, employs Voegelin's theoretical approach to literature to examine Milton's Paradise Lost. Watson begins with the brief remarks Voegelin makes regarding Milton in\n\n42\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY\n\nThe New Science of Politics and in his essay on Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. In these works, Voegelin focuses on the potential of Christian Puritanism to degenerate into a gnostic form of rebellion or closure, which leads to an effort at Utopian perfectionism and self-salvation. From this perspective, the key episode is Milton's presentation of the bland departure of Adam and Eve from Eden. Milton, Voegelin observes, released Adam and Eve to a paradise within them 'happier far' than the paradise lost. From this Miltonian perspective, the world has become Eden; God is kept back in his Paradise; and the couple go their own way to create a paradise on earth. Employing other elements of Voegelin's philosophical writings, Watson explores another dimension within Milton's work that depicts not the defiant modern rebellion against openness, but the experience of the individual living in an age in which the ordering symbols of the society have become rigid and fail to provide an adequate means of participating in the Beyond. To develop this dimension, Watson focuses on the symbol of 'chaos' in Milton's Christian universe. More specifically, Watson asks why Milton chose to incorporate the symbol of chaos into the Christian universe rather than use the more conventional Christian doctrine of creation ex nihilo. Through Watson's analysis, two answers are provided. First, the presence of chaos as an ontological force offsets the fundamentalist tendency to make God responsible for everything in the world, including the evil and disorder that often permeates human existence. Secondly, Milton's use of the symbol of chaos, which he draws from Hesiod, Plato and Augustine, allows him to express what Voegelin describes as the essential experience of humanity: existence in the In-Between—that is, existence in a tension between the timeless, immutable perfection of eternity and the experience of the unstable, fragmentary and irrational flux of existence. Through a careful, detailed reading of Milton's poem, Watson makes it clear that Milton's use of the symbol of chaos reflects the tenor of his age. Watson likens Milton's age to that of ecumenic empires discussed by Voegelin in the fourth volume of Order and History. In the ecumenic age, the older symbolisms survived but lost the authority and ordering force they had once exerted in the societies from which they emerged. The result, according to Voegelin, is that an abyss seemed to yawn between the order of the cosmos and the order of personal existence and society. As Voegelin notes in his discussion of ecumenic empires, this existence amid disorder and disease results in manifold responses. The ancient Gnostic\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n43\n\noutburst was one of the more radical, but the experience generated less extreme adjustments as well. By focusing on the key symbol of chaos, Watson argues that it is Milton's subtle achievement to have portrayed the individual soul as itself the epic landscape of an interiorized heaven, hell and chaos. Chaos was a force to be feared in Milton himself, as well as in his reader and in the culture they shared, but it was also a reservoir of material from which to build a common ground with his reader. Milton's symbolization of chaos may broadly represent a Puritanical dissatisfaction within imperfection. But it also symbolizes the philosopher's experience of the apeiron as experienced by a blind poet whose mind was probing for equivalences of symbolization in the milieu of armed sectarian controversy. The fourth and final essay, by James L. Babin, draws the closest connection between Voegelin's philosophy and literature. Babin does this by directing attention to the Introduction to Israel and Revelation, where Voegelin likens history to an existential drama in which humanity is required to play a part. The ironic part that he must play is to search for his identity in relation to the other actors in the existential drama, God, the natural world and society. What is particularly important for Babin is Voegelin's emphasis on the drama as a mode of participation. As Babin notes, Voegelin 'begins volume 1 and ends volume 5 by situating his quest \"in search of order\" in a drama, in a paradoxic story meant to hold in consciousness the awareness that human beings cannot know the mysterious \"primordial community of being\" as an \"object of the external world but...only from the perspective of participation in it\" '. Voegelin thus begins Israel and Revelation with a meditation on this paradoxical circumstance of human existence. As a form of story, drama provides its audience the reflective distance necessary to meditate on the participatory character of human life and action. Inherent in drama's mode of representation, however, is the paradoxical character of the situation, for man is not a selfcontained spectator. He is an actor, playing a part in the drama of being and through the brute fact of his existence, committed to playing it without knowing what it is. From this disconcerting but inescapable perspective, both the play and the role are unknown. But even worse, the actor does not even know with certainty who he is himself. In the final sentences of volume 5, In Search of Order, which Voegelin was working on in his last months, he reports the same result of analysis as at the beginning of volume 1:\n\n44\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY No 'principles', or 'absolutes', or 'doctrines' can be extracted from this tensional complex; the quest for truth, as an event of participation in the process, can do no more than explore the structures in the divine mystery of the complex reality and, through the analysis of the experienced responses to the tensional pulls, arrive at some clarity about its own function in the drama in which it participates.\n\nIn contrast to Voegelin's emphasis on the drama in the In-Between of finitude and infinitude, knowledge and ignorance, Babin finds that much of modernity is characterized by rebellion against the uncertainties that characterize such existence. He focuses on Freud, especially his Civilization and its Discontents, as a case study of a deliberate rejection of the open field of human existence and the reduction of the consciousness of dramatic participation to subject-object consciousness that reduces phenomena to facts and events under human control. While Freud joined thinkers like Frazer and Jung in the attempt to regain a whole stratum of lost reality by adding the dimensions of dream and myth to an understanding of the psyche, his motivation was to 'finish the story' and reduce the mystery of the paradoxical structure of reality to a 'thing' to be mastered. Freud's attempt to contain the reality recovered as an object of intentional consciousness is most evident in his reduction of the religious ground of existence to an 'illusion', or a 'neurotic relict', or a form of'infantilism'. Freud begins Civilization and its Discontents with a discussion of the 'oceanic feeling' described to him by his friend Romain Holland. In a letter to Freud, Rolland had indicated that this 'oceanic feeling' had never failed him and had been a source of vital renewal. As a consequence he considered himself profoundly religious. Babin notes that Freud does not deal with religion as an experiential event as described by Rolland. Rather, from his positivistic, scientific perspective, Freud reduces or dismisses the participatory depth of religious experience as beyond the scope of scientific observation. Since Freud himself had had no such 'oceanic' experience, and since his judgment of its character remained external and objective— or, as he would say, 'without illusion'—Freud dismissed the phenomenon. Rather than considering the oceanic sensation an instance of a normal, non-pathological experience, Freud concluded that it cannot be of 'a primary nature' and so is not 'real', regardless of the testimony of thousands or millions of persons. One consequence Babin finds in the effort of scientists like Freud to replace 'illusions' with truth is to attempt to master nature. According to Babin,\n\nMcKnight INTRODUCTION\n\n45\n\nanyone who has accepted the reality principle, Freud says, rather than turning away from the world to a quiet, private life, should consider 'a better path': 'becoming a member of the human community, and, with the help of a technique guided by science, going over to the attack against nature and subjecting her to the human will'.\n\nBabin then turns to a further exploration of the structure of modern consciousness and its rebellion against participation in the unfolding story of humanity through a study of Melville's Moby-Dick. He begins his discussion by recalling a contrast Voegelin makes in Anamnesis between the classic experience of the restless quest in search of the divine ground and that of modern thinkers, including Freud: c[T]he tonality has shifted... to the hostile alienation from a reality that rather hides than reveals itself. Babin comments: 'The anxiety produced by the threat of the unknown results in the effort to contain within intentional consciousness the reality of knowledge apprehended in luminous consciousness: the deformative inversion that defines modernity.' With Melville, the storyteller, and his narrator Ishmael, we move from Freud's analysis of civilization's discontent to the story Ishmael tells of Ahab's murderous rage. '[W]e can mark the transition in emphasis from the outside knowledge of reality to the inside reality of knowledge and the different awareness that thus presents itself Ishmael knows he is telling a story that he is in, and he comes to recognize that his primary struggle is with himself. Ahab's furious effort of inversion, to remain outside his story and so to determine its end, becomes part of Ishmael's story. Through references to key episodes, Babin demonstrates that Ahab explicitly acknowledges this wilful inversion of health and disease and shows his awareness of its inverted character. Whatever the cost, Ahab is resolved to conquer the alien, external world embodied for him in Moby-Dick. The reflective distance Ishmael gains as he watches Ahab's story unfold allows him to see the inversion for what it is and to see its distorting, fatal consequences. This 'outside-inside' perspective enables him not so much to resist the destructive forces embodied in Ahab as to allow them to be dissolved by counter-forces welling from his depths: surprise, wonder, awe, delight, joy, gratitude and love. In his concluding section, Babin draws an implicit connection between Ishmael and Voegelin. Ishmael recognizes the nature of health and disease, recognizes his own capacity for good and is able to move toward a balanced existence. In similar fashion, Babin describes Voegelin as the storyteller telling the story of modernity. Voegelin's story, taken in its entirety,\n\n46\n\nPOLITICS, ORDER AND HISTORY unfolds the drama of a modern soul struggling to restore its wholeness by recovering for itself and others what its community has attempted to erase or has allowed to fade from memory. Since the 'truth' it must remember for itself is true also for everyone in its community, the illumination of order emanating from its struggle with the forces of disorder may exercise a therapeutic function in the souls of other actors in the drama who are sensitive to the 'anxiety of existence' and willing to respond to the same questing movement in themselves... By carefully articulating the immutable conditions of our existence and the movements in our depths in the full range of their presence and force, Voegelin helps to restore continuity with our past and opens to us the whole historical, communal experience of that movement—and resistance to it—in which the story of our quest takes its part.\n\nHaving offered a description of the contents of this collection, let me conclude by briefly restating its primary aims. The purpose of this collection is to identify integrating themes in Voegelin's work from 1938 through the 1980s. The intent is to show that Voegelin's analysis developed in response to fu"
