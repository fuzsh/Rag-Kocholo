While most of the Indian writers continued to write in their native languages, these authors adopted English and marked a beginning to what we can now call the history of Indian English literature. Here are some of the key features of the history of Indian English literature:\n\nThe history of Indian English literature gets a bit complicated, especially during the period which marked the freedom struggle for independence and the period following independence. English being the language of colonisers, the Indian writers who adopted English were highly criticised for their choice.\n\nDuring these conflicts, many writers came forth to justify the use of English. One such writer was Sujit Mukherjee who said that English acts as a “link language” in the Indian subcontinent. What he meant by this is that India is a linguistically diverse land not many people understood the regional languages. Like Hindi was not understood by the majority of people from the southern and northeastern parts of India. In such a scenario, a language was needed which could connect the masses and English became that language. As a result, Indian English literature started gaining the prominence that it has today.\n\nWriters like R.K. Narayan and Salman Rushdie brought out their own version of English by incorporating certain Indian words into their otherwise English texts. Later this came to be known as “chutnification”. And this is how Indian writers made a foreign language into their own.\n\nWith time, Indian English literature became the lens through which the outside world looked at India. They become carriers of a collective history. For instance, in “Malgudi days”, R.K. Narayan paints the picture of the Indian rural community with all their beliefs and traditions.\n\nWriters like Salman Rushdie and Khushwant Singh tried to capture the horrors of partition in their writings. In a sense, with time Indian English writing became the common ground on which various histories were inscribed. And this process continues even today.\n\nOne other significant part of the history of English Literature in India is the period when writers started translating their works. For example, Rabindranath Tagore decided to translate “Gitanjali” which was written in Bengali into English. And this translation process leads to the creation of a separate branch called Indian writing in translation.\n\nWhen we look at contemporary Indian English fiction like those of authors like Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, to name a few, we realise that Indian writing in English still remains as a cultural artefact that tells compelling stories about the various cultures of India. It still is a medium through which we could get a better understanding of the cultures and beliefs of the people of India.\n\nLove English Lit?
