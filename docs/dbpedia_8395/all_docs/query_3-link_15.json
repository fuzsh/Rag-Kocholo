Well, officially itâs Marco Polo describing the cities of his travels to Kublai Khan. Itâs been opined that every city he describes is a version of Venice, but I think that doesnât really work.

There are 40 or so cities described, all entirely imaginary I think, and thatâs whatâs so magical... (Source)\n\nJames MeekIt has different layers. The set-up is that Kublai Khan has conquered this vast empire; an empire so large that he, sitting at the centre of it, cannot know all the many parts of it. He canât visit them, he canât see them, and if he goes to one part all the other parts have changed. So he sits there at the centre of his empire and Marco Polo travels around and visits the various cities and comes...

In time, I realised that career paths are like one-way streets. Magic happens in unexplored territories. Plus life is how you choose to live every moment, every day.

Roberto BolaÃ±o is a writer who has found a really important way of dealing with the horrors that the 1970s and subsequent decades have inflicted on Latin America.
