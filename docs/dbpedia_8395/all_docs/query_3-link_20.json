        "text": "An artistic movement in Western culture beginning in the 1940s, postmodernism rejects an ordered view of the world. In literature, the movement denies any inherent meaning in language and abandons conventional formal structure. Postmodern fiction is distinguished by irony and self-reference and often incorporates a variety of styles. This radical departure from literary conventions resulted in several new types of writing. The antinovel, or new novel, rejects such traditional literary features as character development, linear narrative, and social or political content. Magic realism, seen in the work of the Latin American writers Jorge Luis Borges and Gabriel García Márquez, joins fantastic or mythical elements with everyday events. Other writers associated with postmodernism are Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Italo Calvino, Vladimir Nabokov, and William S. Burroughs.\n\nSeveral modes of literary criticism grew out of postmodernism, most notably structuralism, poststructuralism, and deconstruction. Based on the linguistic theories of Ferdinand de Saussure and the cultural theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss, structuralism views literary texts as systems of interlocking signs that can be analyzed by uncovering the rules and conventions underlying the relationships between those signs. In the late 1960s some prominent French structuralists, including Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes, became associated with poststructuralism, which emerged in part as a reaction to the claims of structuralism to be a “science” of literature. Poststructuralists argue that language is unreliable and that therefore meanings are unstable, leaving literature open to many contradictory interpretations. Deconstruction, initiated by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida and often classified as postructuralist, questions the logic of language and undermines the meaning of a text as a function of the author’s conscious intentions."
