        "text": "Judith BUTLER:\n\n(Born 1956)\n\nJudith Butler is an American post-structuralist theorist that is an important figure of the contemporary Queer Theory movement. Butler’s work analyses the relationship between performance and gender identity. Disenchanted with Freud’s lesbian theory, that suggests a desire on the part of women to imitate men, Butler argues that gender is a performance and merely a social construction.\n\nJacques DERRIDA:\n\n(1930 – 2004)\n\nJacques Derrida was a French post-structuralist philosopher whose literary theory is commonly associated with the postmodern. Derrida created ‘deconstruction’, a complex critical literary theory associated with semiotic analysis. Essentially, deconstruction questions the meaning of meaning. Derrida was interested in the plurality and instability of meanings within texts. The idea of ‘common sense’ is rejected and it is suggested that the deconstruction of a text will uncover the subjective meanings embedded within texts that claim to be objective.\n\nUmberto ECO:\n\n(Born 1932)\n\nUmberto Eco is both a literary theorist involved with semiology and a well renowned novelist. Amongst many other things, Eco is famous for his mystery novel The Name of the Rose (1983) that cleverly incorporates literary theory and semiotics, as well as the postmodern practice of ‘intertextuality’.\n\nMichel FOUCAULT:\n\n(1926 – 1984)\n\nMichel Foucault was a French social theorist that contributed greatly to the postmodern movement with his work concerning ‘power’. Foucault saw power as something that is exercised in society through disperse set of discourses. He argued that the individual is a product of social structures and therefore is unable to avoid the exercise of power. His most notable texts include The Order of Things (1966), Discipline and Punish (1977), and The History of Sexuality (1984).\n\nFredric JAMESON:\n\n(Born 1934)\n\nFredric Jameson is an American literary and political theorist whose book Postmodernism; or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1992) was a highly regarded addition to postmodern literary theory. Jameson writes passionately about the postmodern era but not with adoration of its ideals. He defines contemporary cultural production as depth-less and believes the postmodern artistic process of pastiche and parody, or cutting and pasting of already existing images and styles to be superficial and meaningless.\n\nJean-Francois LYOTARD:\n\n(1924 – 1998)\n\nFrench literary theorist Jean-Francois Lyotard is arguably the greatest and most important contributor to postmodern literature. Lyotard’s work concerned defining the postmodern and analysing the impact that postmodernism had on the social world. One of the biggest ideas associated with postmodern theory is the concept of metanarratives, which was the work of Lyotard. Lyotard defined postmodernism as a period of time that holds incredulity towards metanarratives.\n\nKurt VONNEGUT:\n\n(1922 – 2007)\n\nKurt Vonnegut was an American writer whose work falls under the category of the postmodern literature movement named ‘meta-fiction’. Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five (1969) is a great example of postmodern literature, in that it embodies the self-conscious, self-contradictory, ‘knowing’ and ironic qualities that define the literary movement. Vonnegut writes within the traditional fictional art form but with a critically tongue in cheek and ironic awareness of the boundaries of the tradition.\n\nSlavoj ZIZEK:\n\n(Born 1949)"
