        "text": "Do you believe there is no final truth or concrete reality that we can be sure of? If you do, you might as well be a postmodernist. Postmodernism is both a way of inquiry as well as a way of talking about a period in history that followed modernism. Some may say that we still live in the era of postmodernism, but some might argue that civilization has moved beyond it into post-postmodernism!\n\nNo matter where we are now, there is no debate that postmodern philosophy has had ripple effects on the study of arts and humanities. Postmodernist theories continue to influence different subjects like philosophy, literature, linguistics, and film theory. Let's explore the practices and characteristics of postmodern literary theory!\n\nPostmodern literary theory: definition\n\nPostmodernism, like many movements in literary theory, is an unorganised collection of ideas, principles, aesthetic values, and practices. Scholars still struggle to define postmodernism, primarily because postmodernism is undefinable by the very nature of its philosophy. Some argue that postmodernism refers to the ongoing social and cultural currents that carry specific characteristics starting in the 1960s, the period that followed modernism.\n\nPostmodernism: In literary criticism and theory, postmodernism is an analytical tool that focuses on the sociopolitical underpinnings and motivations of literature concerning the individual. Much of the postmodern literary theory is made up of or inspired by the philosophical or critical discourse proposed by theorists that were not originally intended for literary criticism.\n\nTo understand postmodernism, we need to understand what it opposes: modernism.\n\nModernism was a movement in arts and literature that sought to depart from traditions and conventions and reform the arts to fit modern values. As the name suggests, modernism was all about newness and innovation.\n\nThe modernist sentiment is captured well by its motto, 'make it new' (suggested by the American poet Ezra Pound). The modernist era coincided with the age of industrialisation, capitalism, war, and colonialism. The writers of this era actively tried to make sense of the rapidly changing society through their writing. As a result, different narrative styles and philosophical standpoints emerged. For example, modernist fiction is known for its individualism, experimentation, and stream-of-consciousness style of narration.\n\nJames Joyce's Ulysses (1920) and Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway (1925) are among the most popular novels of the modernist era.\n\nPostmodernism is a critique of modernity and modernist values. The postmodern era began in the 1960s when French thinkers like Jacques Derrida, Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, and Michel Foucault rose to prominence. The term 'postmodern' came into popular use with the publication of The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (1984) by the French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard.\n\nPostmodernism is a compound word made up by adding 'post' to the word modernism. The prefix 'post' is a contested space. There is an ongoing debate in academic circles as to what the term signifies. It could be typological (a way to classify ideas) or temporal (one referring to time).\n\nPostmodern literary theory: practices\n\nAn interesting aspect of postmodernism is its interconnectedness with different theories of culture.\n\nFor example, postmodernism is influenced by the material approach to society and culture followed by Marxists. Many postmodern theorists began their careers from a Marxist perspective or by commenting on Marxist theories. Some postmodern ideas offer a sharp commentary on the evolution of the capitalist society to its present stage.\n\nLet's have a look at some of the key figures of postmodernism and their ideas.\n\nMichel Foucault and discourse\n\nThe French philosopher and critic Michel Foucault's ideas on knowledge and power have been influential in postmodern literary criticism. Foucault is most famous for the concept of discourse.\n\nDiscourse: Foucault discusses discourse as a way of organising knowledge that establishes, legitimises, and sustains institutions of power. In society, there are a series of discourses on various aspects of culture.\n\nThough Foucault is often given post-structuralist and postmodernist labels, he rejected them. His work on knowledge and power continues to shape many academic fields, including literary theory. His works include Madness and Civilization (1961), The Order of Things (1966), and Discipline and Punish (1975).\n\nJacques Derrida and deconstruction\n\nThe theory of deconstruction by Jacques Derrida is widely used in postmodern literary criticism. Some see deconstruction as a radical critique of Saussurean linguistics. It not only questions the foundations of structuralism but also takes the argument further by introducing the idea of différance. Derrida coined the term 'différance' to mean both 'difference and deferral of meaning'.\n\nSaussurean linguistics is a school of linguistics that originated from the work of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913). It looks at language as an arbitrary but self-sufficient system made up of interconnected signs.\n\nStructuralism: an intellectual movement and critical approach that focuses on the structural aspects of a text rather than what its content represents.\n\nDifférance\n\nThis is a complex term with several layers of interpretation. Breaking down the idea of différance might help simplify the concept a little:\n\na. Difference: meaning can only be produced in contrast to other meanings. We understand the meaning of a word because it is different from other words.\n\nb. Deferral: meaning is always pointing to other meanings. Let's use an analogy to understand this better. Whenever you look something up on Wikipedia, it presents hyperlinks that you might end up clicking and before you know it, you are several web pages away from what you were originally looking for. In a similar process, meaning is infinitely postponed or deferred in language.\n\nDo keep in mind that Derrida was notorious for his cumbersome language, so we can never be too sure!\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Derrida's work is his breakdown of binary oppositions by challenging the implied hierarchy of the opposing pair, e.g., light/dark, man/woman. According to Derrida, these are not neutral opposites but equations of power where one is superior to its opposite.\n\nCharacteristics of postmodern literary theory\n\nRejection of the presupposed ideas and norms relating to art and knowledge.\n\nCriticism of totalising narratives (grand or master narratives) and questioning the concept of a common objective reality or universal truths.\n\nRejection of philosophical foundationalism that talks about the possibility of a solid basis on which we can build our knowledge systems.\n\nBreakdown of the boundaries between high-art and low-art by combining features of the two in works of art and literature.\n\nRejection of the belief that words and concepts carry inherent meanings that represent a pre-existing reality.\n\nPostmodernity is portrayed as a crisis of individuality brought forth by late capitalism and high modernity.\n\nUse of intertextuality, pastiche and parody as narrative techniques.\n\nFragmentary and convoluted and non-linear narratives in postmodern texts signal the disjoint postmodern subjectivity.\n\nExperimental use of metafiction and playfulness in narration to emphasise that life has no inherent meaning that we are capable of knowing.\n\nIntertextuality refers to the influence and mentions of another text found in a text.\n\nParody is the imitation of something for comic effect.\n\nPastiche: parody without the comic effect; a style of art or literature that tries to recreate an existing one.\n\nPostmodern literary theory: examples\n\nAfter the second world war, the philosophical preoccupations of postmodernism came to dominate works of literature that coincided with a sense of disillusionment with the promises of modernity. Postmodernist literature highlights the chaos and crises of identity in an uncertain world. It recognises the complex and constructive nature of reality and perception and knowledge. Postmodern writers employ a variety of techniques like fragmentation, deconstruction, playfulness, and questionable narrators to emphasise this view.\n\nSamuel Beckett\n\nOne of the most well-known names in the Theatre of the Absurd tradition, Beckett's works are known for their bilingual, idiosyncratic, and tragicomic elements. Beckett was an Irish writer who wrote in French, and he often translated his works into English himself. Beckett's most famous works include Waiting for Godot (1953), Endgame (1957), and Happy Days (1961). Beckett's works carry a poignant realism coupled with a tragicomic play on existentialism.\n\nTheatre of the Absurd is a movement and theatrical style that tries to portray the philosophical concept of the Absurd.\n\nRealism is a philosophical viewpoint that argues things have an independent existence, free from how they are perceived. It favours facts and practicality.\n\nExistentialism is a modern school of philosophy that believes individuals are free agents and capable of creating their own meaning in life.\n\nJorge Luis Borges\n\nThis Argentine writer is celebrated for his unconventional modes of storytelling. The recurrent themes in his works include labyrinths, mirrors, libraries, and so on. His works sometimes display self-reflexity and striking elements of metafiction. Famous works include A Universal History of Infamy (1935), El Aleph (1949), 'Borges and I' (1960), and Labyrinths (1962).\n\nThomas Pynchon\n\nGravity's Rainbow (1973) by Thomas Pynchon epitomises postmodern literature as it uses a fragmented and convoluted narrative structure to discuss different themes ranging from society and culture to science. The works of Thomas Pynchon display characteristics of postmodernism although he was critical of postmodernism.\n\nOther examples\n\nMore examples of postmodernist fiction: One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) by the Columbian novelist Gabriel García Márquez is a seminal work of magic realism. Italo Calvino's novel If on a winter's night a traveler (1979) is a metafiction that addresses the reader directly about the exercise of reading the book. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961) uses literary devices such as paradox and farce to present a complicated narrative to the reader.\n\nParadox: contradiction.\n\nFarce is a theatrical style that incorporates exaggerated physical comedy, crude behaviour, and buffoonery into performance.\n\nMagic realism is a style that presents elements of magic and myth in an otherwise realistic narrative.\n\nPostmodern literary theory: facts\n\nThe methodology of postmodernism is best described as going against the grain of modernist values and conventions. As opposed to modernism, which placed great importance on innovation and a positive outlook on modern life, postmodernism questions underlying assumptions of modernity and challenges presupposed knowledge and ideas. In literature, this is made visible through unreliable and circuitous narrations and deeply fragmented presentation of reality.\n\nMethodology: the methods of study used in a field or activity.\n\nThere was a resurgence of Gothic literature in the postmodern era, a genre that uses fearful and grotesque imagery to invoke intense reactions in readers. This is the postmodern Gothic, a manifestation of postmodern anxiety and uncertainty. Gothic-postmodernism is Gothic fiction with characteristics or undertones of postmodernism and captures the postmodern 'spirit of terror' that postmodern philosophers talk about. This genre uses fragments of realism and fantasy to achieve the interplay between fiction and reality.\n\nThe Master and Margarita (1967) by Russian writer Mikhail Bulgakov\n\nThe Satanic Verses (1988) by British-Indian writer Salman Rushdie\n\nHeroes and Villains (1969) and 'The Bloody Chamber' (1979) by the English novelist Angela Carter\n\nThe works of postmodernism in art, architecture, and music offer interesting comparisons to how it appears in literature. Many pop icons in these fields who we are familiar with are often associated with or influenced by postmodernism.\n\nPostmodern Literary Theory - Key takeaways\n\nPostmodern literary theory is characterised by the critique of modernity and a digression from modernist aesthetic and literary style.\n\nPostmodernist fiction rejects the idea of the absolute and embraces chaos, disorder, and fragmentation of reality.\n\nUnreliable narrator, playfulness in narration and intertextuality are often the marks of the postmodern novel.\n\nMetafiction and self-referential style is often associated with postmodernist fiction.\n\nA key characteristic of postmodernist theory and fiction is the difficulty of locating fixed and absolute meaning within the text."
