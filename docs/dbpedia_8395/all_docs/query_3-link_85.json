Both of these terms are used by philosophers, social scientists and social critics to refer to aspects of contemporary culture, economics and society that are the result of features of late 20th century and early 21st century life, including the fragmentation of authority and the commoditization of knowledge. In this paper it has been tried to show the connection between this approach and other humanity sciences so that crystallized the kingdom of this overall movement.\n\nKeywords: Postmodernism, literature, art, music, movie, philosophy"
