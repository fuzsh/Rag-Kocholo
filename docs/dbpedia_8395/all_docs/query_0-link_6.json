        "text": "William S. Burroughs, one of the founding members of the counterculture literary movement of the Late-Modernist period known as the Beat Generation, added fuel to the Beat fire when he published his novel, Junky, in 1953, ushering in a heavy dose of in-your-face reality, offering himself as the heroin-ripened sacrifice. The novel, with its self-deprecating, dark subject matter written in linear prose, is an essential example of what makes a novel “Beat” and represents the epitome of Late-Modernism as a departure from other, more mainstream modernist novels. Fast forward six years to Naked Lunch, and we see a Burroughs who has abandoned linearity for radical literary experimentation while still holding fast to his go-to theme of massive drug abuse, though with the added element of exuberant homoerotic exercise. The differences between the two novels are as extreme and uncompromising as artistically possible. Therefore, by comparing the subject matter and linear cohesiveness of his first novel, Junky, to that of his nonlinear, severely disjointed, and often stomach-churning second novel, Naked Lunch, it can be concluded that Burroughs left behind what could be considered Modernism, and moved the world with all literary abandon into a brand new era beyond even Late-Modernism."
