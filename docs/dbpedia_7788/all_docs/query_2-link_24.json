Please ask the wiki team before adding content.\n\nİsmail Enver, better known as Enver Pasha (Ottoman Turkish: اسماعیل انور پاشا‎), is a former Ottoman military officer and revolutionary of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) who was one of three leading members of the dictatorial triumvirate known as the \"Three Pashas\" (along with Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha) that ruled the Ottoman Empire with an iron fist between a coup d'état in 1913 and late 1918, joined the war on the side of the Central Powers and was responsible for the death of over 2 million Ottoman citizens, mostly of Armenian, Greek and Assyrian descent, in what is known as the late Ottoman genocides. Once the heroes of the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, which restored parliamentary democracy in the Empire, the CUP's grip over the country gradually increased after the disastrous Balkan Wars and Italo-Turkish War and eventually led to the end of political pluralism."
