        "text": "Spain's former King Juan Carlos is seeking legal immunity in a UK appeals court over harassment claims brought by his ex-mistress.\n\nThe hearing in London follows fresh allegations about his conduct by British resident Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein in a new podcast.\n\nShe accuses the ex-king of spying on and harassing her after their relationship broke down in 2012.\n\nThe former king, who abdicated in 2014, denies any wrongdoing.\n\nJuan Carlos, who lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), did not attend the hearing - and a ruling is expected in several weeks.\n\nHe is appealing against a High Court decision in March, which rejected his claim that English courts had no jurisdiction over the case because he has state immunity as a royal.\n\n\"Whatever special status the defendant retained under the law and constitution of Spain, he was no longer a 'sovereign' or 'head of state' so as to entitle him to personal immunity,\" High Court judge Matthew Nicklin said at the time.\n\nThe former king was allowed to challenge part of that ruling. His lawyers are now making their case for immunity at the Court of Appeal in London for the period before he abdicated in 2014, when he was succeeded by his son Felipe VI.\n\n'Bags of cash'\n\nMs zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a German-born businesswoman who lives in England, filed the harassment case in 2020.\n\nShe said the 84-year-old former king, who is married, had caused her \"great mental pain\" as a result of \"a continuous and ongoing campaign of harassment\" against her after their relationship ended.\n\nShe is seeking damages over claims he pressured her to return gifts worth €65m (£56m; $65m), as well as allegations of break-ins and intimidation.\n\nShe said it began after the relationship broke down following the couple's notorious hunting trip to Botswana in 2012. The then king broke his hip and had to be flown home, sparking public anger amid a financial crisis and record unemployment figures in Spain.\n\nJuan Carlos was credited with overseeing Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy in 1975. But he abdicated the throne in 2014 following a series of scandals involving his family, including a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband, Inaki Urdangarin, who was later jailed.\n\nThe former king has spent more than two years in self-imposed exile in the UAE, after leaving Spain over allegations of fraud which were eventually dropped. A Swiss investigation into a multi-million dollar payment from Saudi Arabia was closed because of insufficient evidence.\n\nThe legal case resumes as new details emerge of the relationship between Spain's former monarch and his ex-lover in a podcast called Corinna and the King.\n\nIn it, Ms zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, 57, speaks openly about the corruption allegations surrounding Juan Carlos when he was still king, saying he presided over a \"court of miracles\".\n\nShe alleges he would return from trips \"happy as a five-year-old and there would be bags full of cash\", which she alleges was \"a very habitual situation\".\n\nShe also recalls a story of him calling up the owner of \"a great chateau of Bordeaux wines\" asking for some to be sent, and \"the next thing you know, 20 cases of this priceless wine would arrive\"."
