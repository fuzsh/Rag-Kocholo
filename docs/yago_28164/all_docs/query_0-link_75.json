She also speaks german (her mother was from Germany and she also spent time in a boarding school in that country). Finally, when she married Juan Carlos and moved to Spain, she learned spanish. She once said she has an accent in every language except for greek which she says she has forgotten a lot of it due to lack of practice since she moved to spain. Truth is, she has a great spanish and greek (once when she came back to Greece she was heard speaking the language perfectly with other locals), her english has an accent but I think is amazing too. Idk how good her german is though. Here’s a video of her speaking english and spanish."
