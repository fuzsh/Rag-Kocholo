        "text": "MADRID — King Juan Carlos of Spain said Monday that he was abdicating in favor of Crown Prince Felipe, his 46-year-old son, explaining in an address to the nation that it was time for a new generation to “move to the front line” and face the country’s challenges.\n\nThe king’s abdication, after almost four decades on the throne, follows health problems but also comes amid a decline in his popularity, particularly as a result of a corruption scandal centered on his son-in-law that has cast a harsh light on the royal family’s lifestyle and finances at a time of economic crisis and record joblessness in Spain.\n\nJuan Carlos said he resolved to step down in January, when he turned 76. He said that a generational change would open “a new chapter of hope” and that his son “represents stability” for Spain and the monarchy.\n\nThe abdication was first made official on Monday by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who called Juan Carlos a “tireless defender of our interests.” The government is set to meet Tuesday to discuss the legislative changes required for the handover, which Mr. Rajoy said would happen soon. He called the abdication “proof of the maturity of our democracy” — a message echoed by most of Spain’s other party leaders. However, some far-left politicians called instead for a referendum on whether to maintain the monarchy, with anti-royal protests also convened in Madrid and other cities on Monday evening.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
