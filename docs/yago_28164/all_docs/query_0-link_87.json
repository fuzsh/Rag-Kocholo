        "text": "When Spanish King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia arrive in St. Augustine, it won't be the first time St. Augustine has hosted royalty.\n\nFormer King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia visited in 2001, marking the first time a king and queen had come to the city. King Felipe VI, who became king last year after his father abdicated, plans to speak at noon today from the King's Balcony at Government House. Anyone who wants to hear the speech should be in the Plaza de la Constitucion by 11:45 a.m.\n\nKing Felipe VI is also expected to address the U.S.-Spain Council, which is meeting in St. Augustine this year because of the 450th commemoration and the city's historical ties to Spain.\n\nThat event is expected to draw additional attention to the St. Augustine area by some of the major leaders of business and government in Spain and the U.S.\n\n\"We're likely to have some pretty high-profile businesses in town,\" said Richard Goldman, president and CEO of the local Visitors and Convention Bureau. \"It's certainly an opportunity to expose our destination. Most of these players go to bigger locations. That is a coup.\"\n\nIsabelle Rodriguez, president and CEO of the St. Johns County Chamber of Commerce, said her staff is ready to steer dignitaries to local restaurants, attractions, etc. at a moment's notice. She said they're all eager to help the county make a positive impression on the guests.\n\n\"It's not an opportunity you get everyday,\" she said. \"It's helpful to give a lot of exposure to our area. It's a high-level networking group.\"\n\nThe following are excerpts about previous royal visits from files at the St. Augustine Historical Society Research Library.\n\n¦ Then-Spanish Prince Juan Carlos \"and his entourage of over 50 persons\" visited St. Augustine in 1971, according to articles in The St. Augustine Record. The itinerary included time at the Mission Nombre de Dios and a tour of the Casa del Hidalgo. The entourage included his wife, then-Princess Sofia.\n\n¦ Then-Spanish Prince Alfonso de Borbon visited St. George Street in 1980 with former Florida Gov. Bob Graham, according to The St. Augustine Record. They dedicated historic houses in St. Augustine. The prince, who was the first cousin of former King Juan Carlos I, died in 1989.\n\n¦ Britain's Prince Andrew visited St. Augustine just before his 23rd birthday in 1983. The prince arrived in Mayport and \"a few hours after saying that he would keep his shore leave plans 'very secret,' the prince left the Mayport Naval Station for about four hours ... during which time he made an unannounced visit to St. Augustine,\" according to an article in The St. Augustine Record.\n\nDuring his visit, he visited the Castillo de San Marcos. Andrew is the second son of Queen Elizabeth II and became The Duke of York after his marriage, according to the website of The British Monarchy.\n\n\"By the time he left the fort, cameras were clicking as word got around that Prince Andrew was in town,\" according to the article. \"The entourage then went to the restoration area for a quick tour of St. George Street. The street was buzzing with talk of the special visitor, including a group of visiting school children from Orlando. Others were not aware of the royal visitor until after he passed by, including one shopkeeper, who said, 'Who's this prince everyone keeps talking about?'\"\n\n¦ In 2001, then-Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia returned to St. Augustine.\n\n\"For the first time in St. Augustine's history, a reigning king of Spain will be stopping by to see the city founded by his people more than 435 years ago,\" an article in the St. Johns Connection from February 2001 reads.\n\nPeople packed the Plaza de la Constitucion as King Juan Carlos I spoke from the Government House balcony.\n\n\"Spanish flags, red carnations and cheers of Viva Espana welcomed Spain's King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia ... A crowd, estimated by city officials at 5,000 people, heard the king credit the city's longevity to its Spanish and Minorcan settlers centuries ago,\" according to an article in The St. Augustine Record.\n\nBefore he spoke, the king signed the city register in Government House, and for the occasion a special chair was taken from the Government House attic and repaired. The chair would not be used by anyone else, a city official said at the time. After the king spoke from Government House balcony, the city moved to name it \"The King's Balcony,\" according to the article.\n\nKing Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia also visited the Casa del Hidalgo building, built by Spain in the 1960s as its tourism office; the Spanish Quarter Village and the Castillo de San Marcos, where a security agent peered from atop a fort wall, according to articles in The Record. They ate lunch at the Casa Monica Hotel with an estimated 175 guests (lunch was $200 per plate), which included spit-roasted, honey-and-ginger-rubbed chicken and Chilean sea bass.\n\nThe couple left St. Augustine just before 5 p.m. \"en route to Jacksonville where a Spanish Air Force 707 took them to Miami.\"\n\n- Reporter Stuart Korfhage contributed to this report."
