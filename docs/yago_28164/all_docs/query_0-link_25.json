In 1962, after marrying Juan Carlos, she changed the spelling of her name from the Greek \"Sophia\" to the Spanish \"Sofía.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's represented Greece in the Olympics.\n\nA few years after meeting then-Prince Juan Carlos aboard a cruise, Sofía was a reserve member of the Greek sailing team at the 1960 summer Olympics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe appears to be a sports fan.\n\nIn 2010, BBC reported that she made an appearance at Wimbledon to see Spanish tennis star Rafael Nadal win for the second time.\n\nShe was also in the stands when the Spanish football team won The World Cup that same year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe spent much of her childhood in Africa.\n\nAs the Spanish monarchy was fielding political unrest in the 1930s, the Greek royal family was also dealing with its own upheaval.\n\nAfter Queen Sofía's family fled from Greece to Africa during World War II, the princess was educated at Egypt's El Nasr Girls College in Alexandria before her family fled once again to South Africa.\n\nShe later resumed her studies at the Schloss Salem boarding school in Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's made some controversial political statements.\n\nIn 2008, Queen Sofía shared some of her political ideology during an interview with journalist Pilar Urbano.\n\nOne of them was her belief that same-sex marriage should not be called marriage.\n\n\"If those persons want to live together, dress up as bride and groom and get married, they can do so, but that should not be called marriage because it is not,\" the queen is quoted as saying in Urbano's book.\n\nHer controversial comments about same-sex marriage particularly elicited outrage among liberal groups, and the Royal Palace quickly shared an apology but qualified it by implying she had been misquoted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is against the Spanish bullfighting tradition.\n\nQueen Sofía has talked about her dislike of the Spanish tradition of bullfighting, which is apparently a \"royal discrepancy,\" according to The Guardian.\n\n\"Making a bull suffer in the plaza for the public's enjoyment while a few people do business? Let them do what they want, but I won't share it,\" Queen Sofía reportedly told publication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Queen Sofía Spanish Institute is named after her.\n\nThe not-for-profit corporation was established by private American citizens in 1954. In 2003, the Board of Directors renamed the organization after Queen Sofía of Spain.\n\nAccording to the website, the corporation's goal is \"to stimulate interest in the United States about the culture, art, customs, language literature, and history of Spain.\"\n\nThey give out awards for book translations and host many Spanish culture-centric events.\n\nThis isn't the queen's first interaction with nonprofits. During her reign, Queen Sofía was known for working with charitable causes, even serving as an honorary president of the Spanish UNICEF Committee since 1971.\n\nFor more great stories, head to INSIDER's homepage.\n\nRead the original article on INSIDER.
