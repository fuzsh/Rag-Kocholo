        "text": "Rumors have been plaguing former Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia since his abdication from the throne in June that their marriage was on the rocks.\n\nAnd now an Italian newspaper is reporting a divorce between the royals is coming down the pipeline – and soon.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, the king’s abdication to his son Felipe has “sped up a separation that has been hidden until now.”\n\nThe rumors of the marriage’s demise reignited recently as the pair has not been spotted together all summer. The last time they were together in public was at the official coronation of their son in June.\n\nAfter that the couple took separate vacations. Queen Sofia traveled to their summer palace in Mallorca, where she has been seen with her children and grandchildren on several occasions. King Juan Carlos was nowhere to be seen, at least most of the time: he traveled to Colombia last month for the inauguration of President Juan Manuel Santos and last Saturday he was in Granada, supporting the Spanish national team in the Basketball World Cup.\n\nMore On This...\n\nThe royal palace has not commented on the divorce rumors, citing that it is a private matter.\n\nThe couple has been married for 52 years and the relationship has often been plagued by infidelities on part of the King.\n\nAccording to El Universal they have been living separate lives for many years, only see each other at official events and don’t even talk to each other unless required."
