        "text": "(born 1938). When the dictator Francisco Franco died in 1975, Spain once again became a monarchy, and Juan Carlos I of the House of Bourbon became king. Juan Carlos was instrumental in Spain’s peaceful transition to democracy. He served as king until 2014.\n\nJuan Carlos Alfonso Victor María de Borbón y Borbón was born on January 5, 1938, in Rome, Italy. He was the grandson of Alfonso XIII, who had been king of Spain until the monarchy was ended in 1931. Alfonso lived the rest of his life in exile and eventually gave up his right to the throne in favor of his third son—Juan Carlos Teresa Silverio Alfonso de Borbón y Battenberg, conde (count) de Barcelona—who was Juan Carlos’s father. Juan Carlos’s mother was María de las Mercedes de Borbón y Orleans. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy. Still living in exile, the family later moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, and then to Estoril, Portugal.\n\nIn 1947 Franco put forth a law declaring Spain to be a “representative kingdom.” He ultimately decided that Juan Carlos should one day be the next king. Juan Carlos went to Spain, where he was prepared carefully for his future tasks, with special attention to a military education. He attended the Instituto San Isidro and the Navy Orphans’ College, both in Madrid, and the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the army in 1957. Juan Carlos attended the Naval Military School at Marín in Pontevedra and the General Academy of the Air at San Javier in Murcia. He followed up his military training with a general course of studies at the University of Madrid.\n\nIn May 1962 Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia, a daughter of King Paul and Queen Frederika of Greece. Juan Carlos and Sophia had two daughters, Elena and Cristina, and a son, Felipe.\n\nIn July 1969 the Spanish Cortes (parliament) declared Juan Carlos “Prince of Spain,” and he took his oath as future king. From that time on he played a ceremonial role in the government on behalf of Franco. Juan Carlos was sworn in as king on November 22, 1975, two days after Franco’s death. As king, he exercised more power than most constitutional monarchs; he was head of Spain’s armed forces and had some say about the political direction of the country.\n\nJuan Carlos had sworn loyalty to Franco’s National Movement (the ruling right-wing political organization) in 1969. After Franco’s death, however, Juan Carlos demonstrated far more liberal and democratic principles. He appointed reformist prime minister Adolfo Suárez in 1976 and encouraged the revival of political parties. In 1981 Juan Carlos took swift action to end a military coup that sought to topple Spain’s new democracy. In doing so, he angered the military sector but preserved the state of democracy. Following elections in 1982, a socialist prime minster took office. In addition, a liberal divorce law was passed in 1981, and a law granting limited abortion rights was passed in 1983."
