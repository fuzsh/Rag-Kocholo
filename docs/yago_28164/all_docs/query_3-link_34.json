        "text": "The New Yorker, April 27, 1998 P. 110\n\nROYAL AFFAIRS about Spanish King Juan Carlos de Borbon y Borbon. In 1975, when Franco died and King Juan Carlos assumed the throne, Spain was a backward and isolated nation that had been ruled for nearly 40 years by a fascist regime. Today, it is a socially tolerant, prosperous nation with a fully functioning democracy. King Juan Carlos is tall and good-looking, speaks several languages, and has a very good pedigree; he is the great-great-grandson of the Spanish Queen Isabel II and a direct descendent of Queen Victoria of England. While Juan Carlos is a very popular king among the Spanish people, there remain tensions between the monarchy and the Spanish democratic government, led by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar--tensions which were most recently illustrated by Aznar's reluctance to let the King visit Cuba before he had himself. Juan Carlos's grandfather, King Alfonso XIII, fled Spain in 1931, when the Republicans took over the country. After the Republic fell in 1939, and Franco installed himself as leader, the Bourbons remained in exile. In 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated in favor of his son, Juan Carlos's father, Don Juan. Juan Carlos went to Spain for the first time in 1948, when he was 10, as part of an agreement between Franco and Don Juan which allowed Juan Carlos to complete his education in Spain. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sofia of Greece, and they soon produced 3 children: two girls, Elena and Christina, in 1963 and 1965, and a male heir, Felipe, in 1968. In 1969, Franco publicly declared his intention to make Juan Carlos his successor, \"with the title of King\"--a move which caught Juan Carlos's father, who was next in the line of succession, by surprise. Juan Carlos was crowned in 1976, after Franco died, and he soon began making major changes in Spain. He fired the right-wing prime minister and appointed a young, reformist politician in his place. Franco's Cortes was dissolved, and a political reform law was approved overwhelmingly. A long-standing ban on political parties was lifted, and, in June, 1977, Juan Carlos called for general elections. In 1978, Spain formally became a constitutional monarchy with a democratic political system. Juan Carlos established himself as a bulwark against the political chaos that was enveloping Spain on February 23, 1981, when, after an attempted government coup, he publicly called for democracy, and the coup subsequently failed. The King and his family currently live in a palace called La Zarzuela, just outside of Madrid. The King's power has been significantly enhanced by the division of Spain since 1982 into 17 autonomous communities; in essence, he has become the sole unifying national symbol of the state. Catalonia is the showcase for Juan Carlos's relationship to the autonomous communities, and the King's daughter, Princess Cristina, currently resides in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia. Prime Minister Aznar, while he owes his election and much of his successful foreign contacts to the King, remains somewhat jealous of Juan Carlos's popularity. Recently, Juan Carlos's business connections with convicted embezzler Mario Conde have been questioned. Much of the business done in Spain is corrupt. Some Spaniards feel that the King may have been involved in a few shady financial dealings, but most remain fiercely loyal to him as their legitimate leader and their most popular export."
