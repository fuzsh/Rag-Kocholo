        "text": "King Felipe of Spain visited his mother, Queen Sofia, in hospital on Wednesday after she was admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection. HOLA! reported that King Felipe gave representatives of the media who were assembled outside the hospital, a short update on the Queen’s health.\n\nIn the grounds of the Ruber Clinic in Madrid, he said, ‘She is very well, cheerful and eager to be discharged and return as soon as possible.’\n\nRead More\n\nPrince William’s quiet return to public life: The Prince of Wales breaks his social media silence for the first time since Kate Middleton shared her cancer news - as he is seen out-and-about in Norfolk\n\nPrince William has been out of the royal spotlight for a number of weeks following Kate Middleton’s cancer diagnosis\n\nRead More\n\nIn a Tatler.com exclusive, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi shares the design secrets behind his latest property in Chelsea\n\nEdoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the husband of Princess Beatrice, has been heading up design firm Banda since he was 23. He spoke to Tatler.com as he revealed one of their finest homes yet, on Mulberry Square, in Chelsea Barracks\n\nBorn in Greece in 1938, Queen Sofia married the Infanta Juan Carlos, who became King on his accession in 1975. Juan Carlos is a figure who has become ever more mired in controversy with the passing years. After numerous financial scandals, the King ultimately abdicated in 2014. Last year he was briefly in Spain for a number of ceremonies surrounding his granddaughter, Princess Leonor’s coming of age, however he was to some extent kept at arm’s length by the royal family.\n\nQueen Sofia, however, has continued to play more of a hands on role in Spanish royal life, supporting King Felipe and his wife, Queen Letizia in their busy schedule of engagements. Besides Felipe, she has two other children, the Infanta Elena and the Infanta Cristina. Sofia mostly lives between La Zarzuela in Madrid and the Marivent Palace in Palma de Mallorca.\n\nSofia is widely recognised for her work with NGOs. She has been the honorary president of the Spanish Unicef Commiittee since 1971, travelling around the world to support the work of the organisation. Countries she has visited include Bangladesh, Chile, Colombia and El Salvador. She also has a number of connections with the UK, including the degree she took at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge.\n\nThe Spanish royal family encountered bumpy territory at the end of last year, after Jaime Del Burgo, a former lover of Queen Letizia (and ex-husband of her sister) made allegations that he had had an affair with Letizia while she was married to Felipe. The allegations were dubbed the ‘Del Burgo Bomb’. As to their credence, some speculation emerged that they were connected with conspiracies against Queen Letizia, casting doubt over their veracity.\n\nNeedless to say, Queen Sofia remains a steadfast member of the family whose role in ensuring continuity in the royal family, even after the retreat of Juan Carlos remains important. Much recent media attention, however, has recently been focused on the rising star of the Spanish royal family."
