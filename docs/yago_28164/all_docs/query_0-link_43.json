        "text": "In 2003, Queen Sofía accepted the Board of Directors’ unanimous request to rename the Institute in her honor, in recognition of her unwavering support of the mission. Her Majesty Queen Sofía of Spain is an avid patron of the Institute and maintains an active role in promoting Spanish culture and unity in the Americas.\n\nHer Majesty Queen Sofía of Spain became a prominent figure in the Spanish Monarchy and acquired her official title in 1975 when her husband King Juan Carlos I acceded to the throne. Born in Athens, Greece, Her Majesty is the eldest daughter of King Paul and Queen Frederica of Greece. She married King Juan Carlos I in 1962. Her family belongs to one of Europe’s oldest Royal Households.\n\nIn June of 2014, King Juan Carlos I abdicated the throne and their son Philip VI and his wife, Letizia, became the reigning King and Queen of Spain.\n\nThroughout her reign, Queen Sofía focused on charitable works with a special interest in medicine. She is the Executive President of the Queen Sofía Foundation, an Alzheimer’s center housing 150 patients and a forensic lab in Madrid, and is Honorary President of the Queen Sofía Music School. Her Majesty is also involved with international projects closely related to her own personal interests which include the environment, international cooperation and development, and micro-financing."
