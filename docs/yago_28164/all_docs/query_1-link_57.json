        "text": "What exactly is going on with the Spanish monarchy?\n\nFollowing years of controversy, former King Juan Carlos has fled Spain and gone into hiding abroad. While the royal family has yet to confirm his whereabouts, many news outlets believe him to be in Abu Dhabi.\n\nOnce widely respected for bringing democracy to Spain after the death of Franco, Juan Carlos abdicated the throne in 2014 after a number of scandals (both financial and personal) caused his popularity to massively decline. In one particularly controversial move, he embarked on a €10,000 a day trophy hunting safari in Botswana in the midst of Spain’s devastating financial crisis.\n\nEven after he relinquished the crown to his son, Felipe, Juan Carlos’s past has continued to threaten the security of the monarchy. After discovering Juan Carlos had ties to a secret offshore fund in Saudi Arabia in March, Felipe eliminated his father’s royal stipend (in addition to renouncing his own personal inheritance from Juan Carlos). Then, at the beginning of August, Juan Carlos announced that he would be leaving Spain in order to help his son better “exercise his responsibilities” as King, sparking widespread debate about the future of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\nQueen Letizia Of Spain Loves Espadrilles Even More Than The Duchess Of Cambridge\n\nGallery12 Photos\n\nView Gallery\n\nWho are the current members of the royal family in Spain?\n\nThe son of Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía, King Felipe married former television presenter Letizia Ortiz in 2004. The pair have two daughters: 14-year-old Leonor, the heir to the crown, and 13-year-old Sofía. Leonor will be the first Spanish queen since Isabella II (1833-1868) when she ascends to the throne.\n\nHow is Princess Leonor expected to save the Spanish monarchy?\n\nIn spite of Felipe’s promises of transparency moving forward, growing republican sentiment in Spain is jeopardising the future of the crown. In addition to the controversy around Juan Carlos, the monarchy’s image has been tarnished by Felipe’s older sister Cristina, who was tried alongside her husband Iñaki Urdangarín for tax fraud in 2017. Urdangarín is now serving jail time for embezzling more than €5 million through his own nonprofit, while Cristina has been stripped of her title as duchess.\n\nPrincess Leonor, by contrast, is understood to represent the future of the Bourbon monarchy. In November, she gave her first highly publicised speech in largely anti-royalist Barcelona shortly after her 14th birthday – speaking to the crowds in Spanish, Catalan, English, and Arabic. Leonor and Sofía also filmed a well-received video designed to boost morale amongst the Spanish public during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n“Leonor is still very young, but modern, well-educated and a woman – which is important as the feminist movement grows in Spain,” a palace representative is quoted as saying in The Times. “She is a great asset.”"
