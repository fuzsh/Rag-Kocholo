        "text": "Juan Carlos: Journalist discusses 'exile' of Spain’s former King\n\nKing Juan Carlos I spent a few days with his family last week as he marked two years since he decided to leave the country he once ruled. He spent the actual anniversary of his self-imposed exile — August 3 — with his youngest daughter, Infanta Cristina, who arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) a couple of days earlier. Cristina and her older sister, Infanta Elena, are frequent visitors to the UAE where their father has resided since leaving Spain after the controversy surrounding his financial affairs intensified.\n\nSince then, all investigations into allegations of financial impropriety have been dropped without any charges being brought.\n\nThe 84-year-old returned to Spain earlier this year where he spent several days in Sanxenxo in the northwest of the country, receiving a warm response from locals as he attended a sailing regatta.\n\nKing Juan Carlos ruled Spain from 1975 until 2014 when he abdicated in favour of his son King Felipe VI.\n\nHe is widely credited with helping restore democracy to Spain after the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.\n\nREAD MORE: Queen Sofia of Spain joins Letizia in rare appearance as she meets officials in Mallorca\n\nQueen 'health crisis' forces Palace to make 'startling admission' on monarch's future\n\nThe Queen's reign is in \"unchartered territory\" after the Palace made a \"startling admission\" about her future, a royal commentator has claimed.\n\nFind out what the royal expert said the Queen's \"health crisis\" means for the future of her reign HERE.\n\nJuan Carlos acceded to the throne two days after Franco, making him the first reigning monarch since 1931.\n\nHis grandfather Alfonso XIII was the last king of Spain before the abolition of the monarchy and the subsequent declaration of the Second Spanish Republic.\n\nWhile Juan Carlos’ family were in exile in Rome, Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939.\n\nBut in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. In 1969, Franco declared Juan Carlos his successor as head of state.\n\nHowever, a historian has claimed that Juan Carlos was “essentially sold into slavery” in order for his family to regain their royal status.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
