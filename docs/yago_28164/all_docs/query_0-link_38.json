        "text": "THE former Queen Sofia is the wife of ex-King Juan Carlos, who has just gone into exile after accusations of corruption while she remains in the country.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about and her, her controversial husband and their net worth.\n\nWho is King Juan Carlos?\n\nJuan Carlos is the former king of Spain, having abdicated in 2014 so his son Felipe could take over.\n\nHe ruled from 1975 to 2014, having taken over from General Franco after he died.\n\nHe is widely seen as the reformer who helped Spain step far away from his predecessor's nationalist dictatorship but his reputation has taken a knock both in his final years as monarch and after.\n\nHe currently stands accused of receiving a secret commission for helping to win a £6 billion Saudi rail deal.\n\nThe supreme court opened an investigation into his alleged involvement and a Swiss investigation is also underway after claims of the former king having undeclared funds in Switzerland.\n\nHe informed his and Queen Sofia's son Felipe, the current king, of his decision to leave the country in a letter.\n\nReports suggest he has recently landed in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis is far from the first time the high-profile figure has faced criticism in Spain.\n\nJuan Carlos famously had to make a grovelling apology in April 2012 after taking an elephant hunting trip to Botswana during Spain's spiralling economic crisis.\n\nHis decision-making was further undermined when it emerged he injured himself on the trip and required special aircraft to bring him home.\n\nAlong with Felipe, he has two daughters: Elena, Duchess of Lugo and Cristina Federica.\n\nWho is Queen Sofia?\n\nQueen Sofia - or Sophia Margarita Victoria Frederika - is the wife of former King Juan Carlos.\n\nThe two married in 1962, 13 years before Juan Carlos would become monarch of the country.\n\nEven while her husband's post-reign popularity suffered, she is believed to have remained quite well-liked by the Spanish people.\n\nBut she faces her biggest crisis yet as she deals with the fallout of her husband's decision to leave Spain earlier this month after he became embroiled in a corruption scandal.\n\nQueen Sofia, 81, has been described by website Royal Central as the \"most royal royal in Europe\".\n\nThis is due to her background as a daughter of a king, sister of a king, wife of a king and mother of a king.\n\nShe was born as the Princess of Greece and Denmark in 1938, being the first child of King Paul of Greece and Frederica of Hanover.\n\nDue to the Second World War, her family were forced into exile where she spent part of her childhood in Egypt before returning to Greece in 1946.\n\nHer brother, Constantine II, ruled as the King of Greece from 1964 until the monarchy's abolition in 1973.\n\nPrincess Sofia, meanwhile, was getting an education at the prestigious Schloss Salem boarding school Southern Germany, and then studied childcare, music and archaeology in Athens.\n\nShe met future King Juan Carlos for the first time in 1954 on Greek islands.\n\nThe two would wed eight years later.\n\nWhat is their net worth?\n\nKing Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia are believed by one source to be worth about $50 million dollars each"
