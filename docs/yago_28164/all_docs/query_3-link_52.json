        "text": "Last September, looking dapper in morning dress but frail and leaning on a walking stick, ex-King Juan Carlos I of Spain attended the state funeral of his third cousin, our late Queen.\n\nSince his abdication in 2014 Juan Carlos has been known in Spain as the King Emeritus; and therefore it was his son, King Felipe VI (next to whom he sat in the Abbey) and daughter-in-law Queen Letizia who officially represented their country at the obsequies.\n\nBut Juan Carlos attended with a personal invitation as a member of the family of the late monarch, with whom he was on ‘Lilibet’ terms. Both were great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, the ex-King through her daughter, Princess Beatrice; and although besieged by financial and, to a lesser extent, extra-marital scandals since he gave up his throne, the ex-King’s visit attracted little comment.\n\nNow, with the blanket of grief imposed by Queen Elizabeth II’s death having been lifted, the prospect of the 85-year-old ex-King coming to London next week to have lunch with his distant cousin, King Charles III, is creating some controversy.\n\nIt probably should not: the ex-King is not a wanted criminal, and the two men have been on excellent terms for most of their lives - although King Juan Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia refused to attend the then Prince of Wales’s wedding in 1981 because of the plan for the Prince and his new Princess to board the Royal Yacht Britannia at Gibraltar, to which Spain lays a claim.\n\nIt is reported that the ex-King has been asked to the Coronation, but that his son and the Spanish government have indicated their unhappiness if he attends: and so barring a last minute change of mind, it seems unlikely he will.\n\nWhen King Charles was still married to his first wife and their children were boys, they all holidayed at Juan Carlos’s summer palace in Mallorca; though the Spanish press later reported that Queen Sofia, long-suffering in this respect, was uncomfortable at the attention her husband paid the then Princess of Wales.\n\nAfter her death, the King and the Prince of Wales were in regular contact and their relationship was as good as ever. However, in a reign that benefited from what was then a respectful, even deferential, Spanish press, Juan Carlos made some massive errors of judgement that can all be attributed to an overwhelming sense of entitlement.\n\nThe turning point for him was when he injured himself in 2012 on a trip to Botswana; a special jet had to be sent to bring him home. It emerged he had been there hunting elephants.\n\nThat alone would have been enough to outrage public opinion; but this lavish trip took place during a catastrophic economic crisis in Spain, with youth unemployment nearing 50 per cent.\n\nIn July 2014, Juan Carlos abdicated, his son succeeding him.\n\nHe reportedly said, in advancing the Prince of the Asturias to the throne at the age of 46, that ‘we do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.’ That may indeed have been one of Juan Carlos’s motives in renouncing the throne: but it is hard to believe the bitter controversies of the preceding two years did not play a part in the decision.\n\nIndeed, once he abdicated, matters became worse. Although the elephant-hunting trip was disastrous in public relations terms, its impact on his reputation was minor compared with a corruption scandal unleashed in 2018.\n\nAlleged recordings of a conversation between his mistress, Corinna zu-Sayn Wittgenstein, whose relationship with Juan Carlos had by this time ended acrimoniously, and a senior policeman were leaked to the media.\n\nShe claimed the ex-King had received personal payments after various trade deals done with Middle Eastern states, notably €6.7 billion from the Haramain high-speed rail project in Saudi Arabia: a joint Saudi-Spanish consortium was chosen to build phase two of the project. According to Ms zu-Sayn Wittgenstein, the cash was deposited in a Swiss bank account.\n\nShe also claimed that the ex-King had bought real estate in Morocco that he allegedly wanted to put in her name to avoid tax liabilities; and told her contact in the police that the Spanish secret service had warned her not to speak publicly of her association with Juan Carlos, as to do so would endanger her life and that of her children.\n\n(That allegation could yet be the basis of a harassment suit against the ex-King that may come before the High Court in London.)\n\nWorse for the Spanish royal family, investigations disclosed that King Felipe was a potential beneficiary of a foundation set up using Saudi money to help his father. In March 2020, King Felipe announced that he would renounce any inheritance from Juan Carlos, which had the effect of stabilising the Spanish monarchy after a period of deep instability, but further damaging the ex-King.\n\nLater that summer Juan Carlos went into self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi, where he still lives, without Queen Sofia. Public and press opinion about him in Spain now seems uniformly hostile.\n\nThe Swiss authorities launched an investigation but dropped it, claiming it was impossible to prove that any of their country’s laws had been broken. However, in Spain itself an investigation deepened, focusing on the ex-King’s role as a ‘facilitator’ of the Saudi rail deal and also on whether he had undisclosed assets.\n\nThis resulted in his making, in late 2020, a payment of almost €680,000 to the tax authorities for money spent on credit cards by him and his family.\n\nA further payment of €4 million followed in 2021 in connection with a Liechtenstein-based foundation of which he was a beneficiary. Early in 2022 the Spanish prosecutor closed the cases against him.\n\nYet Europe owes a significant debt to Juan Carlos, which has been largely forgotten amid all his self-inflicted wounds. He was chosen by General Franco to be his heir after the Caudillo’s death in 1975 precisely because he was considered less liberal than his father, the natural heir.\n\nYet Juan Carlos embarked almost immediately upon democratising Spain and creating a constitutional monarchy; and when a military coup was attempted in his name in 1981 he disowned it, and confirmed Spain on a course that saw it admitted to the European Union in 1986, cementing its place among the western democracies.\n\nThat was why Juan Carlos was so popular for so long and, whatever his private delinquencies, he earned that regard through facing down extremist opponents.\n\nNow, he cuts the figure of a rather tragic, hobbled old man whose self-indulgence has plunged him into disgrace. It would be charitable to conclude he has been humiliated enough, and no-one should begrudge him his lunch date with our King."
