        "text": "Originally posted by Josefine@Oct 7th, 2003 - 11:10 am\n\ndo you think they have a happy marrige?\n\ndo you know if it was a love match....\n\nI think that for Queen Sofia was a love match, for the King, i'm not sure. In those times he had a lot of preassure on him to get married with a very suitable princess and Queen Sofia was the best I've hread several times people say that he had many lovers But i also saw so many sweet moments between them I think that they work together very well Spain and i remember very well of listen King JC say in an interview that no matter what, Queen Sofia was his biggest support and is and always be his best friend . So, they have a very close relationship\n\nQueen Sofia is very devoted to her royal duties and to her adopted country. Whatever infidelities the King has committed in the past (or presently), I think the Queen has resolved to carry on her royal duties and obligations despite whatever hurt she may be enduring. And I think that when you have been with someone for as long as the King and Queen have, gone through so much politically and emotionally, raised three grown children to watch them marry and welcome grandchildren into the world, you sort of rise above all the infidelities. I know it sounds like an awful way to have to life, to know that your husband is unfaithful to you, not to mention a source of embarassament, but I think the Queen was raised of a certain social class where men are unfaithful and the women turn a blind eye to it.\n\nThe same stories that cite that Queen Sofia tried to flee Spain with her young children over the King's infidelities early on in their marriage are also often associated with the stories of how the Queen's own father and brother were/unfaithful to their own wives. So perhaps it has just always been a part of Sofia's life in some shape or form.\n\nAnd the second part to the story of Queen Sofia trying to flee Spain with her young kids because she was so upset over the King's infidelities also has a second part, in which the King showed up at the airport and in a sense asked her where she would flee to. Her brother was in exhile, so he could not support her, her sister Irene had no real funds to support the Queen and her three children, and as Elena, Cristina and Felipe were Infantas and a Prince of Spain, the King would not allow the Queen to leave the country with his children. The King essentially gave her an ultimatum of leaving Spain but without her children or staying in Spain and be with her children but also live with the King's infidelities. A horrible position the King put her in, but the Queen chose her children and in a sense made her bed and now she is living with the consequences.\n\nI think as the years pass on, you come to accept your husband or your wife for whatever faults they have and rise above it. If it really bothered the Queen, I suppose she could leave the King now that her children are grown up, but where would she go? What would she do?\n\nI've read numerous stories of the King cheating on the Queen; that he is quite a ladies man and during the 70s/80s had a long term relationship/affair with a woman who later claimed that her daughter's father was the King. I never heard much further on that matter, whether it resulted in a paternity test (probably not) or if the King ever paid this woman off. He certainly never recognized her as his daughter like King Albert of Belgium did with Daphne.\n\nAt one point when the children were very young, the Queen had had enough of the affairs and left him with all three children in tow. She made it as far as the airport to leave him but he showed up there and talked her into staying, promising to stop the phillandering, or at least to be more discreet about it. I've read too, though am not certain, that the Queen had no choice but to return to the King as she really had no where else to go. Her brother Constantine had been exhiled from Greece by then and did not have the financial means to support her, just as her sister Irene could not either. She had no other financial recourse to support herself or her children.\n\nAlso, the King told her at the airport that if she ultimately chose to leave, that if he could not talk her into staying in Spain, she was free to leave but had to leave the three children in Spain with him as they were the heirs to the throne. (Or at least Felipe was.) Sofia could not bear to leave her children behind so she reluctantly went back to the King.\n\nLyle said:\n\nYeah...that picture is so sweet! So is all this stuff about them living separate lives behind closed doors rumor or is it a generally accepted truth? Like people have said before, they are doing a very good job of keeping up the appearance of a happy family to the public if it is true.\n\nWhat I've heard, and it's just as much gossip as the rest, is that they did marry with much \"feeling\" between them. However, it's commenly accepted in Spain that the King has not been faithful and that that has been personally very difficult for the Queen. However, they are also committed to their marriage, their destiny and their duty. I've always heard that they are a very strong and very united family--but that doesn't mean a perfect family. The Queen has admited that she is particularly devoted to her son, as is Infanta Elena to her brother, whereas Cristina and Felipe are said to be great friends. Felipe, for his part, is said to idolize his father and to have a very tight relationship with his mother. from what I have read it would seem that Felipe is the family's center of attention, but the Queen is the emotional core."
