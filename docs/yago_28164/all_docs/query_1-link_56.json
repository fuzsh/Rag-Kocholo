        "text": "Now that Spain has controlled the coronavirus epidemic, another ‘infection’ called “the virus of the Crown” @CasaReal by some Spanish media, that had gone dormant during the pandemic is back, whipped up by a new criminal investigation by the Supreme Court against emeritus king Juan Carlos I in connection with suspected kickback payments and other unclear exchanges of money.\n\nIt’s been exactly six years since King Juan Carlos abdicated in favor of his son, King Felipe VI, and the rumors have not ceased around the former monarch’s opaque fortune, the reasons that led to his exit and the details of his relationship with Corinna Larsen, a German aristocrat, for whom he was ready to risk his crown and his marriage.\n\nForbesGlamorous, New Official Photos Reflect The Renewal Of Spain's Royal Family\n\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlong with the new indictment against the beleaguered, 82-year-old former king there are previous and new allegations from Larsen, better known as zu Sayn-Wittgenstein from her marriage to a wealthy German nobleman, about shady financial dealings, unsolicited expensive gifts and claims of harassment against her and her family.\n\nMost Spanish media traditionally have been circumspect in covering the royals, for years protecting the former king despite his not-altogether-secret adventures and business affairs.\n\nBut the \"pact of silence\" by which the press tacitly agrees not to criticize the monarchy has been fraying as the scandals accumulate.\n\nOpen Secrets\n\nThe ex-monarch’s relationship with Corinna Larsen, for example, was an open secret and many times she accompanied the king on official visits and events in place of the queen.\n\nAmong the triggers for the abdication was the nationwide outrage when it became known that the king had been hunting in Botswana during a \"secret\" trip at the height of the country's severe recession.\n\nThe escapade became public when he broke his hip during the trip and had to be transported to a hospital.\n\nJuan Carlos, who won respect and admiration for his role in guiding Spain's transition to democracy after the death in 1975 of long-time dictator General Francisco Franco, offered an unprecedented apology for his behavior.\n\nBut his popularity took a serious dive and the incident gave new drive to the country’s anti-monarchist movements.\n\nThe monarchy's reputation was further tarnished in 2016 when the king’s younger daughter, Infanta Cristina, and her husband, Iñaki Urdangarin, were accused in a corruption probe known as the Noos affair, for which Urdangarin is still in jail.\n\nThe Saudi Connection\n\nThe latest chapter in the saga of trials and tribulations for the Spanish crown will focus on the contract by Alta Velocidad Española, or AVE, for more than €7 billion to construct a high-speed rail line connecting the holy cities of Medina and Mecca in Saudi Arabia and awarded to a consortium of 12 Spanish companies in 2011.\n\nIn a press release on Monday, prosecutors announced that the high court would take charge of the investigation because \"one of the people implicated in the facts under investigation was then the king, the current sovereign emeritus Juan Carlos de Bourbon. This investigation is specifically aimed at establishing or ruling out the relevance (of a criminal prosecution) of the events occurring after the month of June 2014, date on which the king emeritus ceased to be protected by inviolability\" as head of state, when he abdicated the throne.\n\nThe scandal is not new and came to public light during a probe into retired police chief José Manuel Villarejo, “who is currently in jail awaiting trial over what is known as “Operation Tandem,” an investigation into two decades of shady work he is alleged to have carried out for a long list of wealthy clients,” writes El Pais.\n\nThe King’s Dear Friend\n\nNow enters Corinna Larsen, described in the Spanish press as the former king’s “dear friend” who in 2015 met police chief Villarejo in London.\n\nDuring the conversations, which Villarejo recorded, she talked about the king using her name to buy property in Morocco and of his secret fortune hidden in several Swiss bank accounts run by trustees, among other things.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, “Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a former close friend of the ex-king, said in March that he had given her €65 million in 2012. Ms. Sayn-Wittgenstein says that the money originated from a $100 million gift by the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to Juan Carlos in 2008. She argues that the Saudi gift, which is being investigated by Swiss prosecutors, has nothing to do with the high-speed train concession granted three years later. As a result, she contends, the funds are related to neither bribes nor money laundering.”\n\nThe Corinna recordings that were part of the investigation ended being shelved when prosecutors concluded in 2018 that those criminal actions happened before Juan Carlos’s abdication, when he was still benefiting from immunity.\n\nBut as the investigation was laid aside in Spain, it proceeded in other countries. In early March, the Swiss daily La Tribune de Genève wrote that in 2008, Juan Carlos had got $100 million from King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, who died in 2015, and that was deposited in the account of a Panamanian entity, the Lucum Foundation, which has a Swiss bank account.\n\nThe probe shows as well that the former king had set up two foundations in Panama, one of which had transferred the alleged donation to Larsen.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph in London reported that the current King Felipe VI appeared among the beneficiaries of the Lucum Foundation. Following the international attention prompted by those articles, and in order “to preserve the exemplarity of the Crown,\" King Felipe publicly renounced rights to his father’s estate, and insisted that he had no idea his name was included among his father’s beneficiaries.\n\nHe also withdrew the royal endowment allotted to the former king, estimated at €194,000 a year.\n\nAt the time, the palace issued a statement renouncing any legacy from the emeritus king “including any asset, investment or financial structure whose origin, characteristics and purpose might not be consonant with the law or with the criteria of rectitude and integrity that should inform the activity of the Crown.”\n\nAs if the latest turn wasn’t enough, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein has brought new charges: In a recent television interview for the Spanish ETB network’s 360 Grados show, she accused the Spanish crown in coordination with the secret service, of a smear campaign against her and her family.\n\n“They created the fiction that I have extensive state secrets to justify their campaign of abuse against me and my children for eight years,” she claimed. “A campaign that continues today and is designed to cover up the evil of others. Someone had to sign the significant funds needed for this operation,” she said.\n\n“Corinna Larsen, a German businesswoman known for maintaining an extramarital relationship with King Emeritus Juan Carlos I and for receiving a fortune from the Royal Household, has denounced an \"eight-year Franco campaign against me and my children\" by \"certain people within the Spanish secret services and the Royal House ,\" writes ETB in its website.\n\n“The German businesswoman, based in London, has answered the questions raised by ETB2's '360 degrees' program, and in these she has assured that the patrimony she received from Juan Carlos I was a generous gift that she never requested. She maintains that certain people have tried to manipulate her and that her relationship with the King Emeritus has brought her serious problems,” ETB explains.\n\n“I have received death threats, I am under constant surveillance, these people tried to separate me from my children and destroy my network of relationships My houses have been forced, they have sent me mercenaries, they have stolen my personal documents and a campaign has been launched of extensive disinformation in the media to destroy my reputation. Do I feel threatened? Yes.”\n\n“She reports being followed by agents of the Spanish intelligence service, the CNI, while in Brazil, and that a group of armed men and Spanish agents occupied her apartment and office in Monaco for several weeks on the pretext of making safety arrangements,” the BBC writes.\n\nShe also explained that she made those facts known to the royal house to no avail and is sure that King Felipe is very aware of what happens.\n\nSince he was sworn in as king, Felipe has promised “a renewed monarchy for new times.”\n\nBut it appears that the sins of the father keep getting in his way."
