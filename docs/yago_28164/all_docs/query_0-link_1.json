        "text": "Princess Leonor of Spain has just turned 18. But, there were some notable omissions from the heir to the Spanish throne’s celebrations. Her grandmother Queen Sofia nor her grandfather, King Juan Carrlos appeared to be in attendance. But why? This was their granddaughter's once-in-a-lifetime coming of age celebration where she pledged loyalty to her country and the nation she will one day rule.\n\nThe news that Queen Sofia, who turns 85 on 2 November, was not at Princess Leonor’s birthday, follows her being photographed in tears earlier in the week. It is unclear why their grandmother was so emotional. It is believed that Queen Sofia was left out of Princess Leonor’s celebrations by her son King Felipe VI of Spain due to her disgraced husband, Juan Carlos. With Juan Carlos not invited, her son had taken the decision to leave Sofia's name off the list too, although it is believed that she was invited to the family celebrations afterwards.\n\nRead More\n\nSpain descends into ‘Leonormania’ as the Princess celebrates her 18th birthday with an oath of loyalty to the Spanish constitution\n\nThe future Queen's status and significance was cemented in a covenant with the country's parliament\n\nPalace sources were reported as saying the 'solution was closed by mutual agreement from the first moment' between Juan Carlos and Felipe. Queen Sofia met Infante Juan Carlos, her paternal third cousin, in 1954 on a cruise in the Greek Islands. They saw each other again at the Duke of Kent’s wedding in 1961. They married less than a year later in Athens. Upon their marriage, the Queen converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Catholicism and changed the spelling of her name from Sophia to Sofia.\n\nTogether, she and Juan Carlos have three children: Infanta Elena, Infanta Cristina, and King Felipe. Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975, upon the death of the fascist dictator Francisco Franco, making Sofia the Queen of Spain. Juan Carlos is judged to have been instrumental in Spain's peaceful transition to democracy and, with his wife Queen Sofia, enjoyed years of praise from his people.\n\nRead More\n\nAs Princess Leonor turns 18, Tatler charts her sartorial ascendency\n\nTatler looks at how the young royal has crafted her public persona through shrewd fashion choices on the cusp of her 18th birthday\n\nHowever, in October 2008, Pilar Urbano's book The Queen Up Close sparked strong controversy as it contained alleged statements in which, for example, Sofia criticised Spain's involvement in the military intervention in Afghanistan, as well as stating her opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. While the claims were actively denied by the Royal Family, it still led to them facing criticism.\n\nRead More\n\nPicture perfect: Princess Leonor proves she’s the glamorous selfie Queen at a palace gala\n\nThe heir to the Spanish throne – who turns 18 at the end of the month – was seen happily posing for selfies with fellow guests, much like any other girl of her age\n\nTheir son Felipe, then known as Prince of Asturias, announced his engagement to Letizia Ortiz in November 2003. In June 2014, Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of his son and Letizia to become King and Queen of Spain. Despite his initial years of adoration from the Spanish public, Juan Carlos has been serially unfaithful and has been accused of multiple charges of corruption. His decision to give up the throne followed a corruption investigation involving his daughter's husband and a controversial elephant hunting trip the monarch took during Spain's financial crisis. The former king remains married to Queen Sofia. However, it is widely believed that the pair are unhappy and have not shared a bed since the late 1970s.\n\nTension within the Spanish monarchy has been rumoured since 2018 when at an Easter Mass, Letizia stopped her mother-in-law from allowing the media to photograph Princesses Leonor and Sofia, by standing in front of the former Queen. The arrival of the two Princesses appeared to sour Letizia’s relationship with Queen Sofia. El País claimed that: 'The arrival of the girls strengthened Letizia, who was by then more familiar with the way the palace worked and was ready to mark her territory. Sofía was accustomed to visiting the girls every so often until it was made clear that she was not welcome, given that her presence interrupted the routine of the young girls,’ it continued.\n\nQueen Sofia was born at Tatoi Palace in Athens, Greece, she is the eldest daughter of King Paul of Greece and Frederica of Hanover. A member of the Greek branch of the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg dynasty, her great-great-grandmother is also Queen Victoria.\n\nShe spent part of her childhood in Egypt and South Africa as her family were forced into exile during the Second World War. She finished her education at the prestigious Schloss Salem boarding school in Southern Germany, and then studied childcare, music and archaeology in Athens. Sofia also studied at Fitzwilliam College, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge."
