        "text": "Queen Sofía is currently in the hospital, but her son King Felipe says she is doing well.\n\nThe 85-year-old former queen of Spain was admitted to a hospital in Madrid, the Ruber International Clinic, on Tuesday evening for a urinary tract infection. On Wednesday, Felipe visited his mother, driving himself to the hospital.\n\nAs he left, Felipe gave an update to media who had gathered outside the hospital, telling them, per Hola!, \"She is very well, cheerful and eager to be discharged and return [home] as soon as possible.\" Felipe's sister, Infanta Elena, was also pictured visiting their mother in the hospital. Yesterday, Felipe visited again, joined by Queen Letizia, sharing the update that his mother wants to be discharged but he doesn't know when exactly.\n\nQueen Sofía's last public appearance was just a day before she was hospitalized, when she attended a funeral mass in honor of her nephew, Fernando Gómez-Acebo, who passed away on March 1 at the age of 49. And, this past weekend, she was at the wedding of the Mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, and Teresa Urquijo, the granddaughter of Princess Teresa of Bourbon-Two Sicilies,\n\nAlso in attendance at the funeral mass on Monday was Sofía's husband, former King Juan Carlos. Since 2020, the former Spanish king has been living in self-imposed exile in the United Arab Emirates, but has traveled back to Spain on numerous occasions. Queen Sofía remained living in Spain.\n\nJuan Carlos and Sofía married in 1962, and have three children: Infanta Elena, Infanta Cristina, and King Felipe VI.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
