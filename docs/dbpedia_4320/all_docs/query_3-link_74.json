        "text": "By Amara Thornton\n\nIn mid-May, a series of films were put online at the British School at Athens website. It was the product of my collaboration with the School's staff on an exciting journey through the archives, looking for hidden histories of women at the School.\n\n​Rather than focus on BSA students, our collaboration centred on the lives of wives and daughters of the School's early Directors. This was inspired, in part, by the School's decision to put the diary of Emily Penrose, classical scholar and daughter of the BSA's first Director Francis Cranmer Penrose, online.\n\nTo Emily Penrose's story, told over two films (here and here), were added the stories of Mary Gardner, a writer married to the School's second Director Ernest Gardner (here), and Ellen Sophia Bosanquet, who was also a writer, married to the School's fifth Director Robert Carr Bosanquet (here).\n\nI published my work on Mary Gardner and Ellen Sophia Bosanquet's books in Archaeologists in Print, but it was great to be able to return to these fascinating women for this series.\n\nEarly this month, I published a blog post on \"Ure Routes\" which draws on another set of records, held at the University of Reading. These records tell the still very hidden history of minority students at the University in the early 20th century. The evidence I found for this history was fascinating, and I'm glad to have the chance to make a bit more visible through the blog. I only scratched the surface, but as campaigns for a more inclusive curriculum continue, I firmly believe it's imperative that these records are made more accessible for research. Read \"An Understudied History\" here."
