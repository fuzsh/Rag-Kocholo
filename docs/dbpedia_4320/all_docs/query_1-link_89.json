        "text": "FREMONT COUNTY, Colo. (KKTV/Gray News) - A massive judgment was made in a class action lawsuit against the owners of a Colorado funeral home.\n\nSoon after nearly 200 bodies were found improperly stored in the Return to Nature funeral home in Penrose last year, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of the family members involved in the case.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed the funeral home and its owners were guilty of things like intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, fraud and violating the Colorado Consumer Protection Act.\n\n“Even as bodies were piling up at their facility in Penrose, these defendants continued to assume custody of more and more and more bodies,” Attorney Andrew Swan said. “And taking more and more and more money for services that they weren’t going to provide.”\n\nOn Monday, the family members involved said they were notified of a nearly $1 billion default judgment.\n\nAccording to an email sent to the victims, the judgment was made last week with court records confirming.\n\nThe total default judgment was $956,825,044.14 made against Hallfordhomes LLC, Return to Nature funeral home, Carie Hallford and Jon Hallford.\n\nAccording to Leventhal Lewis, the firm that filed the lawsuit, it is the largest judgment in Colorado’s history.\n\nSwan said they hope to inspire a change in Colorado’s funeral home laws."
