        "text": "By Amara Thornton\n\nIn mid-May, a series of films were put online at the British School at Athens website. It was the product of my collaboration with the School's staff on an exciting journey through the archives, looking for hidden histories of women at the School.\n\n​Rather than focus on BSA students, our collaboration centred on the lives of wives and daughters of the School's early Directors. This was inspired, in part, by the School's decision to put the diary of Emily Penrose, classical scholar and daughter of the BSA's first Director Francis Cranmer Penrose, online.\n\nTo Emily Penrose's story, told over two films (here and here), were added the stories of Mary Gardner, a writer married to the School's second Director Ernest Gardner (here), and Ellen Sophia Bosanquet, who was also a writer, married to the School's fifth Director Robert Carr Bosanquet (here).\n\nI published my work on Mary Gardner and Ellen Sophia Bosanquet's books in Archaeologists in Print, but it was great to be able to return to these fascinating women for this series.\n\nEarly this month, I published a blog post on \"Ure Routes\" which draws on another set of records, held at the University of Reading. These records tell the still very hidden history of minority students at the University in the early 20th century. The evidence I found for this history was fascinating, and I'm glad to have the chance to make a bit more visible through the blog. I only scratched the surface, but as campaigns for a more inclusive curriculum continue, I firmly believe it's imperative that these records are made more accessible for research. Read \"An Understudied History\" here.\n\nBy Amara Thornton\n\nCurious about the daily life of the Edwardian expat in Athens? Days in Attica is the book for you. Published in 1914, it's the work of Ellen Sophia Bosanquet, the Oxford-educated wife of the British School at Athens’ fifth Director Robert Carr Bosanquet.\n\nEllen Hodgkin and Robert Carr Bosanquet were married in 1902, two years into his term at the School. She went with him to Greece after their marriage, and lived there with him during the rest of his tenure as Director (1900-1906). Days in Attica is Bosanquet’s memoir of her life in Greece, a travel guide for leisured tourists, and a record of Athens and the surrounding landscape of Attica during a seeming calm before the storm of regional and world war.\n\nIt’s a fascinating read, partly because Bosanquet weaves tales of Greek myth and ancient history with references to specific objects, sites and excavations in a Greece that she clearly knows intimately in her own way. But the way she captures the domestic space is the most relevant for this post. In her chapter “Home Life in Attica” she describes the various characters who populate her household as servants. That’s where I came across a passing reference to “Cleopatra Pudding”.\n\nThe reference is part of a reflection on the characteristics of the Athenian cook. Bosanquet salutes a certain spirit of innovation in the face of (understandable) ignorance of British cuisine.\n\nIf I order ‘Cleopatra pudding’ the cook will set to work to make what he imagines ‘Cleopatra pudding’ ought to be rather than confess he has never met with it.”\n\nI imagine many of us are guilty of such behaviour, at one time or another.\n\nLike the cook of Bosanquet’s memory, I’d never heard of Cleopatra pudding either. Intrigued by the dessert’s homage to the famous Egyptian queen (I suppose) I felt a gauntlet had been metaphorically thrown down across the century since Days’ publication. I was determined to find out what Cleopatra’s pudding was and resurrect it. With a party, naturally.\n\nChallenge accepted, the World Wide Web delivered: “The Week’s Best Recipe prize winners” on page 36 of the Australian Women’s Weekly for 12 January 1935 - bless Internet Archive. One of the recipes submitted, awarded a consolation prize of 2/6 - that’s two shillings and sixpence - was Cleopatra pudding. Eureka.\n\nMiss M. Reynolds of New South Wales’ version of Cleopatra pudding calls for biscuit crumbs, desiccated coconut, eggs, sugar, milk and stewed apples. I can’t for the life of me see how these ingredients suggest ancient Egypt, but perhaps the link is in another version of the recipe. (If anyone has a clue, please tell me!) Nonetheless I had found what I was looking for, and invited some chums round to help me make it.\n\nHere’s what we discovered for those of you who may want to try this at home...or abroad.\n\nWe used stewed apples rather than peaches or apricots, which were the suggested alternatives. Not favouring overly sweet desserts I made these beforehand using six Granny Smith apples, a tbsp of honey, and a tsp or so of vanilla. If, like me, you like your apples tart, look for the GSs with darker green skin and lighter green freckles.\n\nA few helpful hints:\n\nUse 1 ½ cups of biscuit crumbs (or try large crumbs rather than small). We used McVitie's Digestives.\n\nAdd another 2-3 tsp of coconut.\n\nOven temp should be 180-190°C.\n\nI don't have an electric mixer, so one of my guests very kindly sacrificed her muscles and hand-whipped the egg yolks and sugar for about an hour. Unless you have someone generous with their energy as I did, use or borrow technology.\n\nAs I’m currently researching the history of popular archaeology publishing, I’ve been steadily acquiring a library of books by archaeologists or about archaeology that have been long out of print. A second-hand copy of Days in Attica is one of my more recent acquisitions.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBosanquet, E. S. 1914. Days in Attica. London: Methuen & Co.\n\nN. B. I couldn't have done this without my fantastic guests; thank you LH, AF, JW, RKD!"
