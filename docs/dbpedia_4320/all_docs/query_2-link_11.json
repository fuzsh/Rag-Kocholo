The details of their face are less important to you than every experience you've ever had with them, and their literal character. I began by inviting contributions from my community: write to me about your best friend. Describe them like a character in a novel, and tell me some quality/habit/speech pattern you've borrowed from them. And because my community is the best, they wrote me long letters of admiration for their dearest friends, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity.\n\nI took these responses and redacted them down to very short poems. I type-set and blind embossed the poems into paper, and printed linocut portraits on top of them. The portraits are from stock images, they may or may not resemble the people they are about, since I don't know what most of them look like.\n\nThank you, Teddy, for writing in about your friend Emily."
