My advisor is Marcus Khuri.\n\nI grew up just outside of Washington, DC and studied mathematics and economics during my undergraduate degree at the College of William and Mary. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on a numerical analysis solution to problem in differential equations. At Stony Brook, I initially studied complex geometry and H&oumlrmander-type theorems before switching to Riemannian geometry and General Relativity."
