        "text": "W.F. Howes, an RBmedia international publishing brand, has won a multiple publisher auction to secure the audio rights for The Lives of Lee Miller, Antony Penrose’s critically acclaimed biography of his mother.\n\nReleased to coincide with the release of LEE—the book’s hotly anticipated big screen adaptation produced by and starring Kate Winslet—W.F. Howes’ edition will mark the first time the title has been made available in audio format.\n\nThe Lives of Lee Miller is an intimate and touching tribute, celebrating the multi-faceted life of a uniquely talented woman, offering a captivating glimpse into the remarkable journey, tracing her evolution from a pioneering fashion model to a groundbreaking photographer, and finally to a trailblazing war correspondent. Through Miller’s lens, listeners will witness her defiance of conventions, her resilience in the face of adversity, and her enduring legacy as an icon of female empowerment and artistic innovation.\n\nThe screen adaptation, directed by Ellen Kuras, sees Kate Winslet in the role of Lee Miller alongside a star-studded cast, including Andy Samberg, Marion Cotillard, Josh O’Connor, Andrea Riseborough and Alexander Skarsgard. The film was one of the major highlights at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and focuses on Lee’s carefree life on the Côte d’Azur in 1937 to the end of World War II in 1945 as an acclaimed War correspondent.\n\nThe World English Language audio rights were acquired from Ben Hayes and Clare Tillyer at Thames & Hudson Ltd by Laura Smith, Acquisitions Manager at W.F. Howes. Smith said: “I am so thrilled to acquire this biography, a gripping and thoughtful chronicle of Lee Miller’s extraordinary life. Heralded by critics and the literary world when it was first released in 1985, we can finally bring it to life in audio format. Given the upcoming film release, this acquisition couldn’t be more timely and we are honoured to help bring Lee Miller’s story to as many people as possible.”\n\nAntony Penrose added: “Since The Lives of Lee Miller was first published, I have been working hard to celebrate my mother’s legacy and honour her life’s work. We established the Lee Miller Archives, regularly showcasing her work through public exhibitions worldwide, and have also opened the family home as a Historic Artist’s House. Publishing has always played such a vital role in this endeavour, so I am delighted to finally witness The Lives of Lee Miller being produced in audiobook format and I’m really looking forward to working with W.F. Howes to give this book its new presentation.”\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbout W.F. Howes\n\nW.F.
