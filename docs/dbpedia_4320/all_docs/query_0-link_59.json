        "text": "The Cambridge Festival is an annual celebration aimed at connecting the exciting work of Cambridge academics and scientists with the wider public.\n\nOffering “an eclectic mixture of over 350 events and activities: from panel discussions, film premieres, and self-guided walking tours, to ‘try this at home’ activities for the whole family” it is one of the most significant outreach events in the University’s calendar.\n\nIt typically takes place over a 10-day period at the end of March. On this page you will find all information regarding INI’s participation past and present.\n\nwww.festival.cam.ac.uk\n\nYouTube playlist of all recorded INI Cambridge Festival talks\n\nProf Ben Allanach\n\nDepartment of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge\n\nTitle: The Force Awakens: Quantum Collisions\n\nDate: Saturday 23 March 2024\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: INI Seminar Room 1\n\nLarge Hadron Collider experiments at CERN have discovered the Higgs boson, the final missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics. In this highly interactive talk, Professor Ben Allanach will describe how the accelerator and its experiments work generally, and also give more specific details about the discovery of the Higgs boson. Based on this information, he will then help the audience to understand the Standard Model, a highly successful quantum field theory.\n\nRecently though, other experiments in America have brought the Standard Model into question through the possible signs of a new quantum force…\n\nSuitable for ages 12+\n\nView the slides from this talk\n\nProf Julia Gog\n\nProfessor of Mathematical Biology at the University of Cambridge\n\nTitle: A mathematical toolkit for pandemics\n\nDate: Saturday 1 April 2023\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: INI Seminar Room 1\n\nWe each faced tough decisions on what we should do during the COVID-19 pandemic: when was it safe to mix and when we did we need to stay at home? And of course there remains plenty of disagreement at every level on what was the best thing to do. The central tension came from the balancing of different harms: from the virus and from our interventions. In this talk, we’ll explore mathematical ways of framing these ideas. With insights from epidemic modelling, we will discover that the “optimum” solution for an individual and a population can be very different. Mathematics alone can’t tell us what to do, but it can be a powerful tool to frame our thinking.\n\nJulia Gog is Professor of Mathematical Biology at the University of Cambridge and the David N. Moore Fellow in Mathematics at Queens’ College, Cambridge. She was involved in scientific advisory work for the UK government during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, Julia was awarded the Royal Society’s Rosalind Franklin Award, and an OBE for services to academia and the Covid-19 response. In December 2021, Julia joined Jonathan Van Tam to present a Royal Institution Christmas lecture.\n\nSuitable for all ages.\n\nWatch the talk\n\nProf Anotida Madzvamuse\n\nProfessor of Mathematical and Computational Biology, University Sussex\n\nTitle: How do cells walk through complex environments? A mathematics point of view.\n\nDate: Saturday 9 April 2022\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: INI Seminar Room 1\n\nKnown as the smallest biological entity, the cell, is fundamental to life, human or otherwise. Unlike humans, animals and many other living organisms, the cell has no legs, head nor tail, yet cells have a remarkable ability to polarise and exhibit the front and back, associated with human mobility, during migration in complex environments such as in blood, tissue or during disease, such as cancer or during the wound healing process. In this presentation, Prof Anotida Madzvamuse will demonstrate the crucial role of mathematics to help understand how cells walk through complex environments. He will also present current challenges where mathematics has a pivotal role to help lead future discoveries.\n\nAnotida Madzvamuse is Professor of Mathematical and Computational Biology at the University Sussex. He holds a DPhil from the University of Oxford (awarded in 2001). His research focuses on the applications of mathematics to experimental, medical and plant sciences. He is also interested in promoting equality, diversity and inclusion in Mathematical Sciences. He has a passion for training a new generation of early career fellows at the interface between mathematics and its applications.\n\nSuitable for all ages.\n\nWatch the talk\n\nDr Emily Shuckburgh\n\nDirector of Cambridge Zero\n\nTitle: Mathematics: a tool kit to tackle climate change\n\nDate: Saturday 27 March 2021\n\nTime: 15.00-16.00\n\nVenue: This is a virtual event.\n\nHow can mathematics help combat the most pressing issue of our age? Join climate scientist and mathematician Dr Emily Shuckburgh, who will be talking about her research on modelling localised effects of climate change including floods, droughts and extreme weather. A world-leading climate scientist and science communicator, Dr Emily Shuckburgh is the Director of Cambridge Zero. She is also Reader in Environmental Data Science in the Department of Computer Science and Technology. In her previous role at the British Antarctic Survey she led a national research programme on polar climate change. She is co-author of the Ladybird book on Climate Change.\n\nSuitable for ages 14+\n\nWatch the talk\n\nDr Craig Saunders\n\nHead of Applied Science at Amazon Alexa Knowledge\n\nTitle: Making Alexa Smarter – AI at scale\n\nDate: Saturday 23 March 2019\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nAmazon’s “Alexa” has continued to expand at a huge rate since launch, and is now on many devices and in many countries. Dr Craig Saunders, Head of Applied Science at Amazon Alexa Knowledge, will speak to some of the challenges of building the original voice assistant and deploying AI and ML at scale, whilst continuing to innovate and push boundaries. New features are brought to a large and increasing user base every day, with a service that is also very much in the public eye. Voice interactions are natural and can be almost a magical experience, but what are the challenges of building such systems? And what does AI at scale really mean here? It’s a complex challenge that requires combining language knowledge, research science, and engineering in the right way to deliver the right voice experience for customers. Dr Saunders will use Alexa to demonstrate some of the topics his team are working on, and the ways they are pushing to make Alexa smarter every day.\n\nSuitable for ages 14+\n\nDr Emily Grossman\n\nScience author, public speaker and TV personality\n\nTitle: Lies, Damned Lies, and Newspapers: The use and abuse of statistics in the media\n\nDate: Saturday 17 March 2018\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nCan we believe everything we read in the papers? The media constantly misuse, misinterpret and abuse statistics. Sometimes mistakes arise because of genuine errors made by experts. Sometimes data from scientists is misinterpreted or misunderstood. And sometimes the media knowingly spin or distort statistics to tell a good story. Who knew?! In this interactive and amusing talk, Dr Emily Grossman takes a light-hearted look at these issues, and discusses some common errors to look out for – illustrated with examples of “embarrassing moments” where she’s been caught out in her own career as a TV science broadcaster.\n\nSuitable for ages 14+\n\nDr Rebekah Higgitt\n\nLecturer, University of Kent\n\nTitle: Longitude Found!\n\nDate: Saturday 21 March 2015\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nAnyone alive in the eighteenth century would have known that the longitude problem was the thorniest scientific dilemma of the day. Lacking the ability to measure their longitude, sailors had been literally lost at sea as soon as they lost sight of land. Join Dr Rebekah Higgitt (University of Kent ) who will tell the fascinating longitude story together with tales of scientific endeavour, challenges and rewards, daring and danger, feuds and skull-duggery!\n\nSuitable for ages 14+\n\nWatch the talk\n\nProf Ian Stewart FRS\n\nEmeritus Professor of Mathematics, University of Warwick\n\nTitle: Mathematical Patterns in Animal Markings\n\nDate: Saturday 22 March 2014\n\nTime: 15.00-16.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nTigers have stripes, leopards have spots, and some cows have large irregular patches. How do these patterns in animal markings arise? About 60 years ago, Alan Turing showed his colleagues a drawing with irregular black-and-white patches, asking them whether they agreed that it looked like a cow. In 1952 he published ‘the chemical basis of morphogenesis’, suggesting a chemical process to create animal markings, and a mathematical equation describing that process. These ‘Turing equations’ lead to patterns that are remarkably similar to those found on many animals, including complex stripes on fish and intricate patterns on seashells. Recently biologists have started to work out exactly which molecules and genes are involved. The talk will be an informal and highly illustrated discussion of these patterns.\n\nSuitable for ages 15+\n\nWatch the talk\n\nDr Colva Roney-Dougal\n\nSenior Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews\n\nTitle: Party Hard! The Maths of Connections\n\nDate: Saturday 23 March 2013\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nHow many guests need to come to a party, to guarantee that at least five of them either all know each other or are mutual strangers? Join Dr Colva Roney-Dougal and see some unexpected applications of the maths behind this still-unsolved problem, from modelling flu epidemics to galaxy formation.\n\nSuitable for ages 14+\n\nWatch the talk\n\nKjartan Poskitt\n\nTitle: Murderous Maths\n\nDate: Saturday 24 March 2012\n\nTime: 14.00-15.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nAn entertaining, interactive and hilarious look at the wonderful world of maths.\n\nEver wondered how to make your birthday twice as long or how to cut something in half but keep it in one piece? Join Kjartan Poskitt, author of the acclaimed “Murderous Maths” series for an hour of hilarious mathematical fun with flexagons, magic squares, strange number facts, knots, tricks, codes, amazing number predictions and much more. Lots of audience participation required!\n\nSuitable for Ages 8+\n\nWatch the talk\n\nProf Reidun Twarock\n\nProfessor of Mathematical Biology at the University of York\n\nTitle: Viruses under the Mathematical Microscope: Deciphering the Code of Viral Geometry\n\nDate: Saturday 26 March 2011\n\nTime: 12.30-13.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nViruses, such as hepatitis and the common cold, have highly ordered protein containers that encapsulate the viral genomic material. They act as Trojan horses, transporting the genomic material inside a cell to hijack the cellular mechanism and produce new viruses. Insights in how these capsids are organised are key to understanding how viruses work and how they can be defeated. In this talk, Reidun Twarock will explore virus architecture under the mathematical microscope. We will show that symmetry plays a key role for virus structure, and that mathematical tools similar to those used in the study of Penrose tilings provide novel insights that shed new light on viral evolution and on how viruses infect their hosts.\n\nWatch the talk\n\nDr Robert Hunt\n\nDeputy Director, Isaac Newton Institute\n\nTitle: Maths at Work in the Real World\n\nDate: Saturday 25 March 2006\n\nTime: 12.00-13.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nExplain how mathematics, which can sometimes seem abstract and irrelevant, is at work in our everyday lives. All around us, from tools which we use on a daily basis (such as mobile phones) through to scientific advances in medicine (such as PET scanners), are examples of how high-powered mathematics is responsible for things that we take for granted in the modern world. And maths turns up in nature in the most unexpected ways!\n\nThe talk will take a light-hearted tour around the usefulness of maths in the real world and will try to explain what the point of studying maths is anyway; concluding with a challenge to find any aspect of life, the world or the Universe which is not intimately related to maths. The talk will definitely be aimed at non-experts.\n\nProfessor Sir John Kingman\n\nDirector, Isaac Newton Institute\n\nTitle: Chance and Probability\n\nDate: Saturday 20 March 2004\n\nTime: 11.00-12.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nProfessor Sir John Kingman will explain how even the most unpredictable things in the world can be studied mathematically. Maths often deals with things that change in a very predictable way, like the planets going round the sun. But much in life is quite unpredictable: the weather, the stock market, football results and so on. Can maths say anything about these? The answer lies in ideas of probability, an old but rapidly developing branch of mathematics. You will not learn to predict the future, but you may be able to move the odds in your favour.\n\nDr Robert Hunt\n\nDeputy Director, Isaac Newton Institute\n\nTitle: Maths at Work in the Real World\n\nDate: Saturday 22 March 2003\n\nTime: 16.00-17.00\n\nVenue: Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science\n\nDr Hunt will explain how mathematics, which can sometimes seem abstract and irrelevant, is at work in our everyday lives. All around us, from tools which we use on a daily basis (such as mobile phones) through to scientific advances in medicine (such as PET scanners), are examples of how high-powered mathematics is responsible for things that we take for granted in the modern world. And maths turns up in nature in the most unexpected ways! The talk will take a light-hearted tour around the usefulness of maths in the real world and will try to explain what the point of studying maths is anyway; concluding with a challenge to find any aspect of life, the world or the Universe which is not intimately related to maths.
