        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn England, approximately 26% of adults and 23% of children are living with obesity.1 Weight-related stigma and discrimination are reported across society, and these experiences are consistently associated with impaired mental health2 and lower quality of life.3 People who report experiences of weight-related stigma or discrimination are at greater risk4 of internalized weight stigma (IWS), usually defined as agreement with and self-application of negative weight stereotypes, often leading to reduced self-worth.5 Among people living with obesity, IWS is linked to disordered eating,6 worse mental health,7 and healthcare avoidance.8 People with a higher body mass index (BMI) report more experiences of weight-related stigma9 and greater IWS.10 However, IWS can also affect people within the recommended and underweight body mass index (BMI) categories, where it predicts disordered eating and drive for thinness,11 making it relevant for mental health across the body weight range.\n\nA growing body of work suggests that, independently of a person's weight, other factors are likely to influence IWS. Most studies find greater IWS among women compared to men,10,12,13 and a representative German study reported a link with socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by either education or income.10 Some US studies report higher IWS for white compared to African American participants,4,14 but how IWS relates to ethnicity outside of the US in unknown. Likewise, differences by sexual orientation remain under-researched; existing studies have reported higher IWS among sexual minority men compared to heterosexual men,15, 16, 17 but no difference by sexual orientation for women.16,17 Stigmatizing experiences from family members and at work have been cross-sectionally linked with IWS,18 and longitudinal evidence suggests that weight-based teasing in adolescence by both family and peers can have long-lasting consequences for disordered eating and body image.19,20 However, research examining IWS has overwhelmingly been cross-sectional,21 precluding investigation of risk-factors over the life-course without risk of recall bias. Furthermore, evidence has largely come from small, nonrepresentative sample populations, such as university students or weight support groups.21 This limits the generalizability of findings, and the extent to which causal processes can be explored.22 Finally, most evidence has come from the US, again limiting generalizability, since contextual factors including a country's prevalence of obesity are likely to shape both the nature and extent of weight stigma.23\n\nThe aim of this study was to re-assess previously reported associations of IWS with demographic, socioeconomic, and wider social factors in a large general population study from Europe, and to explore to what extent associations are explained by differences in current and former BMI. For the first time, we describe risk factors for IWS among 4060 adults in a general population, longitudinal birth cohort study from England. We examine the role of sex, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic factors in childhood and young adulthood, and family, peer and wider social influences during adolescence and early adulthood, exploring whether associations with these factors are independent of BMI in childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.\n\nResults\n\nDescriptive characteristics of the sample\n\nCharacteristics of the analytic sample (N = 4060) based on imputed data are shown in . Compared to the rest of the ALSPAC cohort (i.e., those who did not complete the age 31 years questionnaire), participants in the analytic sample had a slightly lower BMI at most timepoints. At age 7 years, their mean z-score was 0.06 lower (95% CI: 0.01, 0.11, p = 0.01), and at age 24 years, their BMI was 0.35 kg/m2 lower (95% CI: 0.01, 0.69, p = 0.04). Retained participants were more likely to be female (66.4%, vs 42.4% of excluded participants) and white (95.9% vs 94.4%), tended to have mothers with higher qualifications (e.g., 19.1% vs 10.3% with a degree), and were more likely to identify as heterosexual (85.8% vs 79.3%) (for all differences, p < 0.001). Participants in the analytic sample were not more likely to have attended university, and did not differ on NEET history. A full comparison of the analytic sample and the rest of the ALSPAC sample based on complete-case data is presented in Table S2.\n\nTable 1\n\nContinuous variablesMeanSDbWBIS-M Scorec20.117.0BMId z-score at age 7e years0.11.0BMI z-score at age 10e years0.31.2BMI z-score at age 12.5e years0.41.2BMI z-score at age 15.5e years0.41.1BMI (kg/m2) at age 17.5 years23.04.4BMI (kg/m2) at age 24 years25.15.3Categorical variablesCategory%SexFemale66.4Male33.6EthnicityWhite95.8Any other ethnicity4.2Mother's educational qualificationsGCSEs/O-levels/no qualifications47.6A-levels/vocational qualification33.8University degree18.6Attended university by age 30 yearsNo33.4Yes66.6Occasions not in education, employment, or training (NEET) between age 21 and age 29 yearsNever74.1Once17.7Twice or more8.3Sexual orientationHeterosexual84.6Any other orientation15.4Parents make negative comments about young person's weightfNo72.1Yes27.9Teased by family about weight/shapefNo75.4Yes24.6Teased at school about weight/shapefNo76.2Yes23.8Pressure to lose weight from friendsfNo76.2Yes23.8Pressure to lose weight from familyfNo76.9Yes23.1Pressure to lose weight from girls/boys the young person has gone out withfNo86.2Yes13.8Pressure to lose weight from mediafNo64.5Yes35.0Age 8 years: Bullying victimizationNo62.6Yes37.4Age 10 years: Bullying victimizationNo77.0Yes23.0Age 12.5 years: Bullying victimizationNo45.4Yes54.6Age 17.5 years: Bullying victimizationNo68.4Yes31.6Age 23 years: Bullying victimizationNo80.1Yes19.9\n\nSociodemographic risk factors\n\nDemographic differences in IWS are shown in and Table S4. IWS was substantially and consistently higher among females than males (0.56 S.D., 95% CI: 0.50, 0.61, p < 0.001 with full adjustment). In contrast, there was little evidence of differences by ethnicity (0.00, −0.14, 0.13, p = 0.97). IWS was socially patterned by maternal qualification level: at all levels of adjustment, young people born to mothers with fewer qualifications had higher IWS. These differences attenuated with adjustment for the young person's adult BMI, but in fully-adjusted models, participants whose mothers had no or minimum qualifications had 0.16 S.D. higher IWS (95% CI: 0.08, 0.24, p < 0.001) than those whose mothers had a university degree. Sexual minority participants had elevated IWS, and this was not explained by other demographic factors or BMI at any point in development: in fully adjusted models, IWS was 0.17 S.D. higher (95% CI: 0.09, 0.24, p < 0.001) compared to heterosexual participants. Participants who had not attended university had higher IWS than those who had, but successive adjustment (Table S3) showed that this was largely explained by differences in adult BMI (0.04 S.D., 95% CI: −0.04, 0.13, p = 0.29, in fully-adjusted models). In contrast, people who had been not in education, employment, or training twice or more during their twenties had higher IWS after full adjustment (0.20 S.D., 95% CI: 0.08, 0.32, p = 0.001).\n\nBMI from age 7–24 years\n\nAs shown in and Table S5, higher BMI in mid childhood (age 7 years), late childhood (age 10 years), early adolescence (age 12.5 years), mid adolescence (15.5 years), late adolescence (age 17.5 years) and early adulthood (age 24 years, ), were clearly and independently associated with IWS at age 31 years. Adjustment for earlier and later demographic factors made little difference to estimates. Consistent with BMI tracking over time,27 coefficients for earlier BMI attenuated with adjustment for BMI at age 24 years, for example from 0.46 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.50, p < 0.001 per 5 kg/m2) to 0.11 (0.04, 0.17, p = 0.001) for BMI at age 17.5 years. Nevertheless, BMI at all points considered robustly predicted IWS at age 31 years, independent of BMI in adulthood and confounders.\n\nFamily, peer, and wider social influences at age 13 years\n\nIn sex-adjusted models, IWS was higher for young people who at age 13 years reported any of the following: weight-related teasing from their family, weight-related teasing at school, negative weight-based comments from parents, and feeling under pressure to lose weight from family, friends, people they had dated, and the media ( , Table S6). The strongest associations were for negative weight-related comments from parents (0.56 S.D., 95% CI: 0.49, 0.64, p < 0.001), and feeling under pressure to lose weight from family (0.65 S.D., 95% CI: 0.57, 0.73, p < 0.001), and the media (0.52 S.D., 95% CI: 0.45, 0.59, p < 0.001). Adjustment for ethnicity, maternal qualifications and sexual orientation made little difference to estimates, but associations did attenuate with adjustment for BMI at 12.5 years, other social influences at age 13 years, and adult BMI. Nevertheless, in fully-adjusted models, all age 13 factors apart from pressure to lose weight from friends or people the young person had dated independently predicted IWS at 31 years.\n\nBullying victimization at ages 8, 10, 12.5, 17 and 23 years\n\nIn sex-adjusted models, bullying victimization at every timepoint was associated with IWS at age 31 years ( , Table S7), but associations were stronger for more recent bullying victimization (0.41, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.50, p < 0.001 for bullying at age 23 years, and 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.22, p < 0.001 for bullying at age 8 years). Adjusting for demographic confounders, BMI at the time, bullying at other timepoints, and BMI at age 24 years attenuated estimates. In fully-adjusted models, bullying at ages 8, 10 and 12.5 years no longer independently predicted IWS at age 31 years, but bullying at ages 17.5 and 23 years did (0.19, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.26, p < 0.001, and 0.25, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.33, p < 0.001). Associations with direct, relational and cyber bullying were qualitatively similar, but estimates less precise (Figure S2, Table S6).\n\nSex-stratified and additional models\n\nIn sex-stratified analysis (Tables S8–S11), smaller sample sizes led to less precise estimates, especially for males (N = 1363). Most associations were qualitatively similar for males and females. An exception was sexual orientation: for both sexes, IWS was elevated for sexual minorities compared to heterosexual participants, but the difference was markedly bigger for males. In models adjusted for potential confounders and BMI at all ages, IWS was 0.09 S.D. higher (95% CI: −0.00, 0.18, p = 0.06) for sexual minority females, and 0.43 higher (95% CI: 0.29, 0.56, p < 0.001) for sexual minority males (interaction: 0.34 S.D., p < 0.001). Associations with IWS were also stronger among males than females for BMI at age 18 years (interaction: 0.11 S.D., p = 0.008), weight-based teasing at school (0.18 S.D., p = 0.04), family pressure to lose weight (interaction: 0.21 S. D·, p = 0.02), and stronger among females than males for having attended university (females: 0.09, S.D., 95% CI: 0.01, 0.18, p = 0.02, males: −0.06 S.D., 95% CI: −0.18, 0.05, p = 0.27, interaction: 0.14 S.D., p = 0.04). Using the 11-item version of the WBIS-M did not materially affect results (Tables S12–S15). Results of models using complete-case data were similar to results based on imputed data, but estimates less precise, owing to smaller sample sizes (Tables S16–S19).\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur study provides important evidence on the demographic, socioeconomic and family predictors of IWS. At age 31 years, IWS was elevated for females, sexual minorities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged adults, and this was not explained by differences in BMI in adulthood or earlier in life. Both family (as indexed by maternal qualifications) and adult (indexed by time spent not in education, employment, or training between age 21 and 29 years) socioeconomic history predicted IWS, independently of both child and adult BMI and confounders. People who had not attended university had higher IWS than those who had attended, but only among female participants was this independent of differences in adult BMI. Both male and female sexual minority participants had higher IWS than heterosexual counterparts, but this was stronger for males. In addition, several aspects of the social environment during development emerged as important for later IWS: negative weight-related comments from parents, weight-based teasing from family, and pressure to lose weight from family at age 13 years were robustly associated with IWS in adulthood, even after accounting for both child and adult BMI, underscoring the importance of the family environment. Peer relations were also important: as well as weight-based teasing at school, bullying for any reason was associated with IWS at age 31 years, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood. Lastly, feeling pressure from the media to lose weight at age 13 years was robustly associated with IWS at age 31 years, underscoring the importance of the wider social environment and its messaging about weight. Our results demonstrate that some of the higher IWS experienced by people with higher BMI in adulthood was explained by BMI during childhood and adolescence, further highlighting the importance of non-stigmatising messaging about weight for children and young people. Given substantial evidence that IWS has serious implications for mental and other aspect of health,6, 7, 8,11 these findings will be crucial for targeting prevention programmes and supporting people most at risk.\n\nHigher IWS amongst female participants in our sample is consistent with most studies on IWS to date,10,12,13 and with evidence that women are more likely to experience weight-related discrimination.9 In contrast to US studies, which have reported lower IWS amongst African American participants, we did not observe any difference based on ethnicity. This suggests there are cultural differences between the US and Europe, consistent with evidence that weight stigma plays out in contextually specific ways.23 However, the small proportion of minority ethnic participants in ALSPAC meant power to detect such effects was low. Two socioeconomic indicators (maternal qualifications and NEET history) were independently associated with IWS, indicating that socioeconomic disadvantage in both early life and adulthood may shape personal experience of weight stigma. Results accord with a representative German study which found higher IWS among adults with lower income and fewer educational qualifications,10 and suggest that a person's early life socioeconomic circumstances may have long-lasting relevance, independent of educational attainment in adulthood. Findings also accord with evidence highlighting that stigmatizing attitudes about obesity and poverty, and particularly people receiving benefits, are closely connected.28 Our findings provide much needed evidence on sexual orientation predicting IWS, which is under-studied despite evidence that disordered eating is more prevalent among sexual minorities.15,29 Our results accord with earlier studies which find higher IWS among sexual minority men compared to heterosexual men,15, 16, 17 possibly reflecting idealization of a lean, muscular body type within gay culture.15,16 However, we also find higher IWS among sexual minority females than heterosexual females, which suggests other mechanisms. In addition to the factors driving IWS in all adults, stressors experienced by sexual minority women such as internalized homophobia or sexual orientation concealment may impact eating behaviour29 and in turn affect IWS. Relatedly, we identified bullying victimization in adolescence and adulthood as a risk factor for IWS, and experiencing bullying linked to sexual orientation may also contribute to IWS in this group. More broadly, research suggests that sexual minority women are not necessarily protected from beauty norms which value thinness, especially in the dating realm.30 Earlier studies based on psychology students17 or people engaged in weight management programmes16 found IWS to be similar for heterosexual and sexual minority women. The discrepancy may reflect cultural differences between the UK and US, or consequences of sample selection, and points to the need for research involving sexual minorities drawn from general population samples in diverse countries.\n\nOur study accords with recent evidence on the importance of social processes in mediating links between body weight and psychological outcomes in adolescence.31 In particular, our findings highlight the importance of the family environment for later psychological outcomes; we found higher levels of IWS amongst those who had experienced negative weight-related comments, weight-based teasing, and pressure to lose weight from family, with these associations not explained by differences in adolescent and adult BMI. These results also align with studies suggesting that these factors may have long-term impacts on disordered eating.19,20 Findings regarding bullying in childhood and adolescence align with evidence linking these experiences with body image,32 while associations with bullying at age 23 years underscore both the continuation of bullying later in life, and its health consequences.33 Our results therefore indicate that bullying, which can be reduced following appropriate interventions,34 may be a fruitful target for intervention to reduce IWS and its consequences. Findings regarding perceived pressure from the media to lose weight align with substantial evidence of that weight stigma in the media is pervasive, and negatively affects attitudes about weight.35\n\nThis study examined IWS in a general population birth cohort study. By drawing on rich longitudinal data, we were able to investigate risk factors from childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood whilst minimising recall bias. Objective measurements of height and weight minimised measurement error in BMI, and availability of repeat measures through the life course meant associations with BMI at different stages of life could be robustly explored. However, since IWS was only included in the survey at age 31 years, influence of earlier IWS could not be explored. This may have affected reporting of exposures, such as weight-related comments at age 13 years, or influenced participants' NEET history, if people with high IWS are less likely to put themselves forwards for interviews or promotions. Although multiple imputation was used to reduce the impact of missing data in risk factors, we cannot be sure that data was missing at random, and for some variables the proportion of imputed data was relatively high. However, conclusions based on complete-case analysis did not differ, suggesting that our approach to handling missing data had not substantially impacted results. Relatedly, analysis was restricted to participants who completed the age 31 years questionnaire, and attrition by age 31 years may have influenced results. Our early adulthood BMI measure was from age 24 years, and some participants' weight may have changed between this and outcome measurement. However, tracking of BMI in this part of the life-course is likely to be high.27 Information was only available on participants’ biological sex as recorded at birth; consequently, how IWS relates to gender identity could not be explored using this data. We used a standard indicator of socioeconomic conditions in childhood (maternal qualifications), but IWS may relate differently to income-based measures, or educational qualifications of other family members. ALSPAC is a regional cohort study, and at baseline was not fully representative of the UK population, with single parent families, those living in rented accommodation and some ethnic minorities underrepresented. Replication is required in national studies, and in ethnically diverse European samples, given the low proportion of ethnic minority participants in ALSPAC. Future research in this and other surveys will be required to elucidate in more detail the mechanisms which link demographic, social and psychological risk factors across the life-course to IWS. As with any observational study, we have described associations; future work using other study designs will be required to establish if these associations are causal. Recent work has pointed to close links and possible conceptual overlap between IWS and body dissatisfaction and wider eating disorder cognitions,36 and future work should examine how these constructs are dynamically related over time. Meanwhile, further research on IWS among sexual minority women as well as men is needed to better understand IWS in this population.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current study has provided novel insights highlighting elevated IWS amongst females, sexual minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged people, and those who in youth experience bullying, weight-related teasing, and feel under pressure to lose weight, especially from family members and the media. These differences are not explained by differences in BMI and point to strong and long-lasting effects on adult psychological health. These findings hold important implications for policy and practice relating to how we discuss weight in the media, in public spaces and families, and how we respond to bullying in schools, workplaces, and other settings. This is crucial considering how prevalent pressures to lose weight and weight-related stigma and discrimination are in many cultures around the world."
