        "text": "At the most recent G-20 summit in Turkey, President Obama committed the United States to expand the work of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to thirty new countries. The president called upon governments around the world to increase their commitments to help prevent future outbreaks of infectious diseases from becoming epidemics. The White House also announced that an additional 13 countries have joined the GHSA and that the United States intends to invest more than $1 billion in resources to continue expanding the GHSA.\n\nFinland has been chairing the Steering Group of the Global Health Security Agenda throughout 2015. That group has been working to promote political awareness of global health security as a shared responsibility – making us better at preventing avoidable epidemics, detecting threats early and responding rapidly and effectively.\n\nThe Stimson Center and Fondation Mérieux USA welcomed officials from the State Department and the Finnish Embassy to discuss the White House’s announcement, Finland’s chairmanship, and the agenda for 2016. The event featured a panel of non-governmental and industry experts who reflected on their role in implementing and informing the GHSA.\n\nWHAT: A discussion on the White House’s announcement at the most recent G-20 summit in Turkey related to the Global Health Security Agenda.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nAmb. Kirsti Kauppi, Ambassador of Finland to the United States\n\nAmb. Bonnie Jenkins, U.S. Department of State\n\nLucy Maryogo-Robinson, Director of Global Health Program, Association of Public Health Laboratories\n\nWilliam B. Karesh, Executive Vice President for Health and Policy, EcoHealth Alliance\n\nJennifer B. Nuzzo, Senior Associate, UPMC Center for Health Security\n\nEmily Penrose, Program Manager, Fondation Merieux"
