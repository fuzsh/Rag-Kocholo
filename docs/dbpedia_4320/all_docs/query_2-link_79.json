        "text": "Kelly is Penrose Court’s Administrator and has been working in a similar role for the last 25 years in local schools.\n\nAt Penrose Court, Kelly enjoys working closely with her colleagues and forming relationships with our residents. Outside of work, she can often be found with her family and friends, or enjoying one of her many hobbies which includes reading, yoga or going out on long walks. Kelly plans to travel a lot more and loves going to The Lake District.\n\nJade is one of our Registered General Nurses here at Penrose Court and joined when the home opened in 2018. Having previously studied at Herts University, Jade completed a foundation degree and became a nursing associate. Jade then went straight into a top-up degree to become a qualified Nurse Recently qualifying at the end of last year, Jade has worked at Penrose Court since it opened as bank staff and is now full-time. Jade has been in the care industry for over 10 years working in the community and other private care homes.\n\nAmy started her career as a part-time carer, later moving to full times roles at Hinchingbrooke and Biggleswade hospitals. She joined us at Penrose Court as a Registered General Nurse, and is highly satisfied every day looking after others, empathising with and empowering residents and other staff members. Amy was recently awarded a Bachelor of Science in Adult Nursing with First Class Honours and also received the Martin Foss Award, an annual award given to a final year student in Nursing and Midwifery who has made the greatest contribution to the life of the Faculty of Health and Social Science.\n\nJay joined the team at Penrose Court in 2018 having first started as a member of the care team before transitioning to her current role. Jay brings a wealth of experience to her role and is instrumental in ensuring that there is an extensive programme of activities available for the residents. Jay ensures that there is always fun and laughter around the home and has a particular passion for arts and crafts and just loves interacting with all of the residents. Jay also runs the in-house salon Cut and Glow, ensuring that everyone looks and feels their very best.\n\nPaul is the weekend receptionist here at Penrose Court\n\nPaul joined quite recently and has been here since the beginning of February but is often told by colleagues and residents alike that it seems like he’s been here for a lot longer. This is Paul’s first time working in the care environment but is finding it very enjoyable and rewarding.\n\nPaul’s background hails from the Civil Service, where he took early retirement after spending over 30 years at the Department of Transport but wasn’t ready to give up and when this job came up it was a 3-minute commute from my home by foot. Paul is also a Magistrate for Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire since joining the bench in 2008 and the requirements here at Penrose Court allow Paul to continue making a difference to the local community.\n\nPaul’s passion for making a difference to people is fully satisfied in this job by the interaction with the residents and their families.\n\nEmily joined Penrose Court at the end of April 2024. Working 3 days a week in reception alongside Claire and Paul. She also works alongside Kelly helping with any additional Admin tasks. Emily has really enjoyed getting to know all the residents and forming a friendship with them and their family members.\n\nShe also enjoyed greeting the four-legged friends that come to visit our residents, as she used to work as a dog groomer before joining us here at Penrose Court."
