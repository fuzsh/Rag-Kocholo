The contest drew 710 entries from 218 high schools, and has involved nearly one thousand students from 38 states across the U.S. and from Ontario. Over 600 middle school students viewed and evaluated the videos as part of the judging process. Courageous Persuaders continues to grow in scope and reach each year as it connects with more students and partners across the nation.\n\n“Courageous Persuaders would not be possible if it were not for the gracious support from our large partner companies,” added Alberts. “Underage drinking, drinking and driving, and distracted driving are national problems and having a longstanding partnership with State Farm has allowed us to expand our national reach and ultimately positively impact more lives.”\n\nStudent scholarships and award winners:\n\nGrand Prize, $3,000 – “Underage Drinking” by Emily Penrose, Lake Orion High School, Lake Orion, MI\n\nState Farm Fan Favorite Award, $2,500 (winning school) – El Dorado High School, Placentia, CA and State Farm Fan Favorite Award, $1,000 (winning student) – “Sober Girl” by Sowmya Rajesh, Joslynne VanGinkel and Jordyn Sievers\n\nDADA Award, $2,000, Dangers of Texting While Driving – “Easy Magic Trick to Fool Your Friends!” by J.T.

In addition to the Courageous Persuaders program, the Foundation also administers Automotive Education Day at the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS), and the NAIAS Poster Contest.\n\nAbout Detroit Auto Dealers Association (DADA)\n\nThe mission of the DADA is to support its membership through legislative and industry representation, educational programs and communications, and community relations activities.\n\nFounded in 1907 by a group of five Detroit-area auto dealers after they hosted the very first Detroit Auto Show in the same year, today, the DADA membership includes 190 new-vehicle dealers who own 226 dealerships-selling 42 different vehicle lines in 66 cities throughout the greater Detroit area. The dealers are affiliated with the DADA through one or more of 12 vehicle line groups, or through individual membership.\n\nOne of the chief goals of the association is to promote the integral role that the motor vehicle plays in the economy of our nation and the world. Many of the members of the Detroit Auto Dealers Association participate in the NAIAS, LLC, which is responsible for the production of the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS).\n\nThe DADA members support their communities through charitable involvement. The most significant charitable venture of the DADA is the annual NAIAS Charity Preview. Since 1976, the Charity Preview has raised over $121 million for southeastern Michigan children’s charities – over $41 million of which was raised in the last 10 years alone. In 1998, the DADA founded the DADA Charitable Foundation Fund, one of the benefiting charities of the NAIAS Charity Preview, to support charitable organizations and activities that assist children and youth."
