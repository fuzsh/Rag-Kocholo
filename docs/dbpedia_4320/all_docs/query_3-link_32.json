        "text": "Project Overview\n\nThe refurbishment project at 100 Brook Drive, Green Park, aimed to reimagine and transform the atrium reception, enhancing the experience for tenants and visitors alike. Entrusted by the landlord, EPD collaborated closely with the client to address the limitations of the existing layout and improve the functionality and aesthetic of the space.\n\nKey Objectives\n\nOptimise Traffic Flow: Understand the flow of employees and visitors to ensure a seamless movement throughout the building.\n\nEnhance Usability: Redesign the space to better serve the actual usage patterns of tenants and visitors.\n\nCreate a Welcoming Environment: Develop an inviting and functional space that impresses both visitors and tenants.\n\nDesign Solutions\n\nReception Relocation: The reception desk was moved from the center of the atrium to the back entrance, aligning with the primary entry point from the staff car park. This adjustment better accommodates the majority of building traffic and improves the overall flow.\n\nCafé and Informal Working Area: The central atrium space, previously underutilised, was transformed into a vibrant café and informal working area. This welcoming environment now serves as a focal point for social interaction and casual meetings, enhancing the building’s communal atmosphere.\n\nBiophilic Design Elements: To counterbalance the extensive glass elements and introduce a natural touch, a striking three-story moss wall was installed, extending from the café to the roofline. This feature adds a lush, organic feel to the space. Additionally, a textured wall with creeping foliage on the opposite side of the atrium further enhances the natural aesthetic, simulating nature’s intrusion into the built environment.\n\nBreak-Out Space: Adjacent to the café area, the opposite side of the atrium was converted into a large break-out space. This area includes a large sharing table and intimate pods designed for private meetings, phone calls, or quiet work. This setup caters to the diverse needs of tenants, offering a flexible and adaptable work environment.\n\nClient Collaboration\n\nThroughout the project, EPD engaged in detailed workshops with the client and leasing agents to ensure that the design met the practical needs and aesthetic desires of the building’s users. This collaborative approach ensured a tailored solution that significantly improved the functionality and appeal of the common areas."
