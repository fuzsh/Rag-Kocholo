        "text": "After coaching for the University of Southern California in the 2019 season, Emily Gackowski returned to The Ohio State University for the 2019-20 season. She serves as an assistant coach and the novice coach. Before coaching for USC, Gackowski was a volunteer assistant coach for the Buckeyes in the 2018 season in which OSU swept the Big Ten Championships.\n\nIn 2022, the Buckeyes claimed the Big Ten Championship, the 10th conference title in program history. Ohio State then went on to race well on the final day of the NCAA Championships to claim eighth nationally. The Buckeyes have made the NCAA event 22 times in program history.\n\nThe 2022 1V4 finished second nationally with the 1V8 ending the season seventh and the 2V8, eighth overall.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the 2020 season, the Buckeyes appeared in their 21st NCAA Tournament in 2021, entering the event as one of 12 at-large selections. All three NCAA boats qualified for the championships after a second-place finish in the 2021 Big Ten Regatta.\n\nThe Ohio State 1V8 ended the 2021 campaign No. 7 (NCAA No. 7 seed) behind the No. 5 2V8 (NCAA No. 6 seed) and the No. 4 1V4 (NCAA No. 6 seed).\n\nGackowskiâ€˜S rowing career began as a novice at Indiana University. In her first year at Indiana, the rowing program saw its first NCAA appearance. In the years following, Emily earned podium finishes at each Big Ten Championship and the honor of Second Team All-America Athlete in 2017 as a senior."
