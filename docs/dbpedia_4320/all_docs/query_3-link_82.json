In those 12 years Jonah ended up receiving a degree in musical theatre from the University of Miami (the Florida one) and started performing around the country at theaters such as the Utah Shakespeare Festival, Marin Shakespeare Company, Goodspeed Opera House, Alabama Shakespeare Company, and others. He took a bite out of the big apple just as the pandemic hit. Throughout the turmoils of 2020, in a pursuit to help however he could, he hosted virtual concerts from his rooftop in New York to fundraise for organizations in need, and created a parody series using musical theater songs to emphasize the social and political issues our nation was (and is still) facing. Jonah is now based in LA and can’t wait to keep creating onstage and on screen. Catch him in Daisy Jones and The Six on Amazon Prime this spring and let him know if you need anything fact checked, he has a whole system now. Huge thank you to Stephen, Simon, and the whole Fountain family. To Allegory Creative Talent. To Ari and the NPR clan. And to John D’Agata for writing this one important story.\n\nKATHRYN KELLEY (Emily Penrose) is delighted to appear at The Fountain Theatre for the first time.
