        "text": "What drew you to the law?\n\nI love the complexity of the law, particularly how—at the margins—legal solutions require reference to multiple doctrinal areas, deep ethical principles and traditional notions of humanistic excellence. On good days, all those things are in play. On bad days, I just argue with opposing counsel.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about teaching?\n\nFor me, teaching is a compulsion, one tied up with the concept of “legacy” and the related moral obligation to aid in the intergenerational effort to pass along notions of justice and right conduct across cultures and over time. And I always learn something from my students!\n\nWhat do you hope students gain from your courses?\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope students take away a storehouse of knowledge that they can quickly and usefully apply in practice. But I also hope they receive a larger critical insight – namely, that theory and practice merge in the everyday workings of the law.\n\nWhat did you do prior to entering academia?\n\nAlthough I’ve always kept a foot in academia, I’ve spent most of the last three decades in private practice.\n\nWhat are you passionate about outside the law?\n\nFor most of my adult life, I’ve been a student and teacher of literature. One of my passions is to convince others that literature is not “outside the law.”\n\nWhat are your research interests?\n\nMy recent scholarship spins together two strands. The first, which is informed by my practice, focuses on technical and policy issues within traditional doctrinal areas of the law. The second grows from my long-time interest in theory, crossing disciplinary boundaries within the law and—even more generally—the humanities.\n\nSee my CV for a complete list of presentations.\n\nInvited Speaker, “Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act”, Tarrant County Bar Association Business Litigation Section, Fort Worth, Texas (December 2021).\n\nInvited Speaker, “Law as Performance,” Celesq Attorneys Ed Center and West LegalEd Center (June 2021).\n\nInvited Reviewer, “LAUNCH Undergraduate Research Scholars Thesis Program,” Undergraduate Research Expo, Texas A&M University (March 2021).\n\nPresenter, “Albert Camus’ The Plague,” Online Event (workshop page), Dallas Institute of Humanities & Culture (October 20, 2020).
