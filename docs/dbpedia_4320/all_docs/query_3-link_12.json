        "text": "About Me\n\nMy name is Emily Penrose. I am a student at Thomas Jefferson University majoring in Visual Communication Design with a minor in Animation.\n\nThis website is made to act as a portfolio to show my work as well as a way to connect with other artists, customers, or employers. It includes my art from my AP Art class and work from the Television Productions Workshop class at Lake Orion High school. I have a few of my own recreational projects included as well.\n\n​\n\nAs a visual artist, I have over ten years of experience with colored pencil and five years of experience with Adobe softwares like Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Figma. My Inspiration comes from media platforms and collaborating with other artists. On average, a colored pencil portrait will take me about ten to fifteen hours. I also enjoy digital design using Procreate on my iPad Air. With this style, I can do a realistic portrait in about three to five hours. I usually like to try different styles and medias of art, but my main focus is on realistic, surrealistic and animated portraits of people.\n\n​Outside of school work and recreational projects, I have customers interested in customized art through my social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. My rates very depending on the type of project my customer wants, from an authentic drawing to a logo or website design.\n\nYou can reach me through email or any of my social media platforms, located at the bottom of this page.\n\n​\n\nThank you for taking the time to learn about me and I hope you enjoy my presentation!\n\n​\n\n​Love, Em"
