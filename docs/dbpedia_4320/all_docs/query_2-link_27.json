        "text": "“The whole industry is falling down around me,” laments Emily Penrose, the beleaguered magazine editor at the center of the debate in Jeremy Kareken, David Murrell, and Gordon Farrell’s The Lifespan of a Fact, onstage at Lantern Theater Company February 2 through March 5, 2023. While essayist John D’Agata and fact checker Jim Fingal duke it out over issues of authenticity, art, and audience faith, Emily must also consider the very practical fallout of one essential question: to publish or not to publish? She must make that fraught decision in an ever-shrinking traditional media landscape, where every wrong move could be a publication’s last.\n\nIn The Lifespan of a Fact, Emily rattles off the names of the legacy companies that use the same printer as her magazine: Hearst, Condé Nast, Time, Simon & Schuster. But even among these surviving companies — “the ones that are left,” according to Emily — there are signs of the shrinking and consolidating media landscape. Hearst and Condé Nast, huge multimedia companies each founded more than 100 years ago, have both reduced frequency of some high-profile print magazines or stopped printing them altogether in a shift to all-digital models. Time, Inc. was acquired and re-acquired several times between 1990 and 2022; several of the print magazines of Meredith, its acquirer, have scaled back their frequency or likewise shifted to all-digital models. And Simon & Schuster — as of 2016 the third largest publisher in the U.S., publishing 2,000 titles a year — was the subject of a high-profile lawsuit around the increasing consolidation of media companies. In 2022, Penguin Random House (already consolidated from two formerly independent publishers) attempted to acquire Simon & Schuster, but the sale was blocked by a federal judge under antitrust concerns.\n\nPrint magazines and newspapers have been in decline for years; the rise of the internet has made print content less essential in the eyes of many, and advertisers have responded in kind by moving their money to digital advertising rather than print. There’s a demographic problem as well: as of 2017, retirees were the only age cohort in which more than 50% had a magazine subscription of some kind. Millennials were the lowest, at just 33%. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey, newspaper revenue fell by 52% and periodical revenue fell by 40.5% between 2002 and 2020. This loss of revenue has led to layoffs, shrinking budgets, and reduced or eliminated print schedules in favor of digital content.\n\nThe internet has, in many ways, democratized media — information is often free and always at our fingertips. Anyone with a connection can write, research, and publish their takes for an unlimited audience. It has also transformed the operations of media organizations; reporting the news is no longer bound by the schedule of the printing press, allowing for more up-to-the-minute reportage and increased pressure to be the first with a scoop.\n\nBut the loss of print media isn’t simply a blow to the nostalgia of holding a magazine or newspaper in one’s hands. Print magazines are more likely than newspapers or book publishers to employ dedicated ante hoc fact checkers; while many newspapers and cable shows have fact checkers to call out untruths after the fact, they do not stop the misinformation from circulating in the first place. And in a time where information can be distributed almost instantaneously, the mad dash to be first can result in errors, exaggerations, and outright lies making their way into the media ecosystem.\n\nThe shift to digital news also has local consequences. Between 2019 and 2022, more than 360 newspapers shuttered, and many were not replaced by an equivalently local digital alternative, leaving 70 million Americans with one or zero local news organizations, according to Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications. “This is a crisis for our democracy and our society,” said Penelope Muse Abernathy, visiting professor at Medill. “Invariably, the economically struggling, traditionally underserved communities that need local journalism the most are the very places where it is most difficult to sustain print or digital news organizations.”\n\n“I have a duty to my audience, my publisher, my advertisers,” Emily insists in The Lifespan of a Fact. A capable and passionate editor, she doesn’t have the luxury of publishing art for art’s sake — she must balance the art with the commercial and legal implications of every decision, making the best and most valuable magazine she can for her audience in an environment where every mistake carries dire consequences.\n\nMore reading: QUIZ: Stretching the Truth — How much do you know about writers who have blurred fact and fiction?
