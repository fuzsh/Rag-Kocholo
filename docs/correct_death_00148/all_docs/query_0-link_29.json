        "text": "The funny and imaginative children’s stories of British author Roald Dahl are favorites with readers both young and old. His action-packed tales feature memorable and often magical characters.\n\nDahl was born in Llandaff, Wales, on September 13, 1916. His early life was difficult. When he was only 3, his sister and father died. Soon after, the family moved to Kent, England.\n\nWhen World War II began in 1939, Dahl joined the British Royal Air Force. He was seriously injured during a crash landing. Dahl’s first writings were about his experiences in the military. His first children’s book, The Gremlins, was published in 1943. It is about mythical creatures who make fighter planes crash.\n\nDuring the 1950s Dahl wrote short stories for adults. After he became a father, he started making up bedtime stories for his children. In 1961 he published James and the Giant Peach. It was followed in 1964 by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which is about a poor child whose luck changes when he visits an extraordinary candy factory. His later children’s books included Danny: The Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982), and Matilda (1988). He died in Oxford, England, on November 23, 1990."
