        "text": "“Measles causes encephalitis in around 1 in 1,000 children. Measles encephalitis caused the death of Roald Dahl’s daughter Olivia in 1962. He became an ardent supporter of measles vaccination as a result of the tragic loss of his daughter. In 1986 he wrote a letter to parents encouraging them to get their children vaccinated [which is reproduced here]. He dedicated James and the Giant Peach and The BFG to Olivia.”\n\n“Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.\n\n“Are you feeling all right?” I asked her.\n\n“I feel all sleepy,” she said.\n\nIn an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.\n\nThe measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.\n\nOn the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.\n\nIt is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk. In America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.\n\nHere in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year. Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.\n\nEvery year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.\n\nSo what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?\n\nThey are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.\n\nSo what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.\n\nThe ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible."
