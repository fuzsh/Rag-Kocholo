        "text": "Grendon Cottage, in Grendon Underwood, is featured in Dahl’s book Going Solo which includes a photograph of the property with the words “Mama’s Cottage’.\n\nThe well-known children’s writer returned to his family home in London after being invalided out of the RAF in 1941, only to find his mother and sisters gone.\n\nIn Going Solo, a memoir which picks up from where his first autobiography Boy ends, Dahl tells how he traced them to the cottage in Grendon Underwood.\n\nThe book describes his war-time experiences including crash-landing over the desert in Libya and the aerial battles he took part in.\n\nHe went on to write several best-selling children’s books including James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr Fox, Danny the Champion of the World and the BFG.\n\nHe died in in Oxford in 1990, when in his mid-70s and is buried in the cemetery at St Peter and St Paul’s Church in Great Missenden.\n\nProfessor Rob Edge, a scientist who specialises in accelerators, has lived at Grendon Cottage for more than four years.\n\nHe said: “We knew about the Roald Dahl connection before we bought the house because the estate agent mentioned it in the property details. After the purchase went through, we went out and bought a copy of the book Going Solo.”\n\nProfessor Edge has decided to sell his house because he is moving to Huddersfield to take up a post at the university there.\n\nGrendon Cottage is a Grade II-listed thatched cottage with a sitting room, dining room, two bedrooms and a double garage.\n\nIt has a number of period features and is on the market for a guide price of £495,000.\n\nFor more information, or to arrange a viewing, contact Hamptons on 01865 512332 or visit hamptons.co.uk"
