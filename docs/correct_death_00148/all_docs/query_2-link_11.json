        "text": "Repton, Derbyshire\n\nIn 1929, at the age of 13, after a spell at St Peter’s boarding school in Weston-super-Mare, Dahl attended Repton School in Derbyshire. Here, one of his English teachers said of his writing: “I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended.”\n\nHere was also where Dahl and his classmates took part in tasting chocolate for the Bournville-based chocolatiers, Cadbury, another potential inspiration for his third children’s book.\n\nNorway\n\nNamed after the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, Dahl’s personal and family links with the Scandinavian country were strong, and it was where he spent many of his summers on holiday as a teenager. He described his holidays here as “absolutely marvellous” and took in places such as Drobak, Oslo and Tjome. He carried on the family tradition and took his own children on holiday to Norway in later life.\n\nDar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\nDahl spent several years living in the city of Dar es Salaam in Tanganyika, now Tanzania, after he began working for the Shell Oil Company. He lived in luxury in the Shell House, with a cook and personal servants. It was here that he had encounters with lions and the deadly black mamba, as detailed in the second half of his autobiography, Going Solo. He left Tanzania in 1939 to join the RAF.\n\nAlexandria, Egypt\n\nAfter being rescued from a plane crash in the Egyptian desert (where a crash-landing went wrong when Dahl’s plane ran out of fuel), Dahl was first taken to a first aid post in Mersa Matruh, now a popular tourist resort, before being transferred to the Royal Navy hospital in Alexandria. The crash fractured his skull and temporarily blinded him.\n\nThe coast at Alexandria, Egypt Photo: Fotolia/AP\n\nAn inquiry into his crash found that Dahl had run out of fuel looking for an airfield that didn’t actually exist – he had been mistakenly sent instead to the no-man’s land between Allied and Italian forces.\n\nWashington DC\n\nGeorgetown, Washington DC, where Dahl lived Photo: Alamy\n\nDahl saw combat in the Battle of Athens but was invalided home after suffering headaches and blackouts. From then he worked at the British Embassy in Washington DC, attempting to further America’s support for Britain in the war.\n\n• 10 things to do and see in Washington DC\n\nIn Washington he met a number of literary and publishing types and had his experiences of the plane crash published in The Saturday Evening Post. He lived at 1610 34th Street, Georgetown.\n\nBrixton Town Hall, London\n\nBrixton Town Hall Photo: Alamy\n\nDahl married his first wife, American actress Patricia Neal in 1953 at Trinity Church, New York City, with whom he had five children. He married his second wife, Felicity ‘Liccy’ Crosland, at Brixton Town Hall in London in 1983.\n\nGreat Missenden, Buckinghamshire\n\nDahl's grave in Buckinghamshire Photo: Alamy\n\nDahl’s home since 1954 was in Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire until his death in 1990. He was buried with his snooker cues, some very good burgundy wine, chocolates, HB pencils and a power saw at St Peter and St Paul’s Church in the village. Visitors today leave toys, flowers and notes by his grave. The village is also today home to the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre."
