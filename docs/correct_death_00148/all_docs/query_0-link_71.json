He was educated in England before starting work for the Shell Oil Company in Africa. He began writing after a âmonumental bash on the headâ sustained as an RAF fighter pilot during the Second World War. Roald Dahl is one of the most successful and well known of all childrenâs writers. His books, which are read by children the world over, include James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Magic Finger, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, Fantastic Mr Fox, Matilda, The Twits, The BFG and The Witches, winner of the 1983 Whitbread Award.

This is not an autobiography. I would never write a history of myself. On the other hand, throughout my young days at school and just afterwards a number of things happened to me that I have never forgotten. None of these things is important, but each of them made such a tremendous impression on me that I have never been able to get them out of my mind. Each of them, even after a lapse of fifty and sometimes sixty years, has remained seared on my memory. I didnât have to search for any of them. All I had to do was skim them off the top of my consciousness and write them down. Some are funny. Some are painful. Some are unpleasant. I suppose that is why I have always remembered them so vividly. All are true. R.D.\n\nP:10\n\nStarting-point\n\nP:12\n\nPapa and Mama My father, Harald Dahl, was a Norwegian who came from a small town near Oslo, called Sarpsborg. His own father, my grandfather, was a fairly prosperous merchant who owned a store in Sarpsborg and traded in just about everything from cheese to chicken-wire. I am writing these words in 1984, but this grandfather of mine was born, believe it or not, in 1820, shortly after Wellington had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. If my grandfather had been alive today he would have been one hundred and sixty-four years old. My father would have been one hundred and twenty-one. Both my father and my grandfather were late starters so far as children were concerned. When my father was fourteen, which is still more than one hundred years ago, he was up on the roof of the family house replacing some loose tiles when he slipped and fell. He broke his left arm below the elbow. Somebody ran to fetch the doctor, and half an hour later this gentleman made a majestic and drunken arrival in his horse-drawn buggy. He was so drunk that he mistook the fractured elbow for a dislocated shoulder. âWeâll soon put this back into place!â he cried out, and two men were called off the street to help with the pulling. They were instructed to hold my father by the waist while the doctor grabbed him by the wrist of the broken arm and shouted, âPull men, pull! Pull as hard as you can!â The pain must have been excruciating. The victim screamed, and his mother, who was watching the performance in horror, shouted âStop!â But by then the pullers had done so much damage that a splinter of bone was sticking out through the skin of the forearm. This was in 1877 and orthopaedic surgery was not what it is today. So they simply amputated the arm at the elbow, and for the rest of his life my father had to manage with one arm. Fortunately, it was the left arm that he lost and gradually, over the years, he taught himself to do more or less anything he wanted with just the four fingers and thumb of his right hand. He could tie a shoelace as quickly as you or me, and for cutting up the food on his plate, he sharpened the bottom edge of a fork so that it served as both knife and fork all in\n\nP:13\n\none. He kept his ingenious instrument in a slim leather case and carried it in his pocket wherever he went. The loss of an arm, he used to say, caused him only one serious inconvenience. He found it impossible to cut the top off a boiled egg. My father was a year or so older than his brother Oscar, but they were exceptionally close, and soon after they left school, they went for a long walk together to plan their future. They decided that a small town like Sarpsborg in a small country like Norway was no place in which to make a fortune. So what they must do, they agreed, was go away to one of the big countries, either to England or France, where opportunities to make good would be boundless. Their own father, an amiable giant nearly seven foot tall, lacked the drive and ambition of his sons, and he refused to support this tomfool idea. When he forbade them to go, they ran away from home, and somehow or other the two of them managed to work their way to France on a cargo ship.\n\nP:14\n\nFrom Calais they went to Paris, and in Paris they agreed to separate because each of them wished to be independent of the other. Uncle Oscar, for some reason, headed west for La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast, while my father remained in Paris for the time being. The story of how these two brothers each started a totally separate business in different countries and how each of them made a fortune is interesting, but there is no time to tell it here except in the briefest manner. Take my Uncle Oscar first. La Rochelle was then, and still is, a fishing port. By the time he was forty he had become the wealthiest man in town. He owned a fleet of trawlers called âPÃªcheurs dâAtlantiqueâ and a large canning factory to can the sardines his trawlers brought in. He acquired a wife from a good family and a magnificent town house as well as a large chÃ¢teau in the country. He became a collector of Louis XV furniture, good pictures and rare books, and all these beautiful things together with the two properties are still in the family. I have not seen the chÃ¢teau in the country, but I was in the La Rochelle house a couple of years ago and it really is something. The furniture alone should be in a museum. While Uncle Oscar was bustling around in La Rochelle, his one-armed brother Harald (my own father) was not sitting on his rump doing nothing. He had met in Paris another young Norwegian called Aadnesen and the two of them now decided to form a partnership and become shipbrokers. A shipbroker is a person who supplies a ship with everything it needs when it comes into port â fuel and food, ropes and paint, soap and towels, hammers and nails, and thousands of other tiddly little items. A shipbroker is a kind of enormous shopkeeper for ships, and by far the most important item he supplies to them is the fuel on which the shipâs engines run. In those days fuel meant only one thing. It meant coal. There were no oil-burning motorships on the high seas at that time. All ships were steamships and these old steamers would take on hundreds and often thousands of tons of coal in one go. To the shipbrokers, coal was black gold. My father and his new-found friend, Mr Aadnesen, understood all this very well. It made sense they told each other, to set up their shipbroking business in one of the great coaling ports of Europe. Which was it to be? The answer was simple. The greatest coaling port in the world at that time was Cardiff, in South\n\nP:15\n\nWales. So off to Cardiff they went, these two ambitious young men, carrying with them little or no luggage. But my father had something more delightful than luggage. He had a wife, a young French girl called Marie whom he had recently married in Paris. In Cardiff, the shipbroking firm of âAadnesen & Dahlâ was set up and a single room in Bute Street was rented as an office. From then on, we have what sounds like one of those exaggerated fairy-stories of success, but in reality it was the result of tremendous hard and brainy work by those two friends. Very soon âAadnesen & Dahlâ had more business than the partners could handle alone. Larger office space was acquired and more staff were engaged. The real money then began rolling in. Within a few years, my father was able to buy a fine house in the village of Llandaff, just outside Cardiff, and there his wife Marie bore him two children, a girl and a boy. But tragically, she died after giving birth to the second child. When the shock and sorrow of her death had begun to subside a little, my father suddenly realized that his two small children ought at the very least to have a stepmother to care for them. What is more, he felt terribly lonely. It was quite obvious that he must try to find himself another wife. But this was easier said than done for a Norwegian living in South Wales who didnât know very many people. So he decided to take a holiday and travel back to his own country, Norway, and who knows, he might if he was lucky find himself a lovely new bride in his own country. Over in Norway, during the summer of 1911, while taking a trip in a small coastal steamer in the Oslofjord, he met a young lady called Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg. Being a fellow who knew a good thing when he saw one, he proposed to her within a week and married her soon after that.\n\nP:16\n\nMama Engaged Harald Dahl took his Norwegian wife on a honeymoon in Paris, and after that back to the house in Llandaff. The two of them were deeply in love and blissfully happy, and during the next six years she bore him four children, a girl, Me at 8 months another girl, a boy (me) and a third girl. There were now six children in the family, two by my fatherâs first wife and four by his second. A larger and grander house was needed and the money was there to buy it. So in 1918, when I was two, we all moved into an imposing country mansion beside the village of Radyr, about eight miles west of Cardiff. I remember it as a mighty house with turrets on its roof and with majestic lawns and terraces all around it. There were many acres of farm and woodland, and a number of cottages for the staff. Very soon, the meadows were full of milking cows and the sties were full of pigs and the chicken-run was full of chickens. There were several massive shire-horses for pulling the ploughs and the hay-wagons, and there was a ploughman and a cowman and a couple of gardeners and all manner of servants in the house itself. Like his brother Oscar in La Rochelle, Harald Dahl had made it in no uncertain manner.\n\nP:17\n\nThe house at Radyr But what interests me most of all about these two brothers, Harald and Oscar, is this. Although they came from a simple unsophisticated small-town family, both of them, quite independently of one another, developed a powerful interest in beautiful things. As soon as they could afford it, they began to fill their houses with lovely paintings and fine furniture. In addition to that, my father became an expert gardener and above all a collector of alpine plants. My mother used to tell me how the two of them would go on expeditions up into the mountains of Norway and how he would frighten her to death by climbing one-handed up steep cliff-faces to reach small alpine plants growing high up on some rocky ledge. He was also an accomplished wood-carver, and most of the mirror-frames in the house were his own work. So indeed was the entire mantelpiece around the fireplace in the living-room, a splendid design of fruit and foliage and intertwining branches carved in oak. He was a tremendous diary-writer. I still have one of his many notebooks from the Great War of 1914â18. Every single day during those five war years he would write several pages of comment and observation about the events of the time. He wrote with a pen and although Norwegian was his mother-tongue, he always wrote his diaries in perfect English. He harboured a curious theory about how to develop a sense of beauty in the minds of his children. Every time my mother became pregnant, he would wait until the last three months of her pregnancy and then he would announce to her that âthe glorious walksâ must begin. These glorious walks consisted of him taking her to places of great beauty in the countryside and walking with her for\n\nP:18\n\nabout an hour each day so that she could absorb the splendour of the surroundings. His theory was that if the eye of a pregnant woman was constantly observing the beauty of nature, this beauty would somehow become transmitted to the mind of the unborn baby within her womb and that baby would grow up to be a lover of beautiful things. This was the treatment that all of his children received before they were born. A letter from Papa\n\nP:19\n\nKindergarten, 1922â3 (age 6â7) In 1920, when I was still only three, my motherâs eldest child, my own sister Astri, died from appendicitis. She was seven years old when she died, which was also the age of my own eldest daughter, Olivia, when she died from measles forty-two years later. Astri was far and away my fatherâs favourite. He adored her beyond measure and her sudden death left him literally speechless for days afterwards. He was so overwhelmed with grief that when he himself went down with pneumonia a month or so afterwards, he did not much care whether he lived or died. If they had had penicillin in those days, neither appendicitis nor pneumonia would have been so much of a threat, but with no penicillin or any other magical antibiotic cures, pneumonia in particular was a very dangerous illness indeed. The pneumonia patient, on about the fourth or fifth day, would invariably reach what was known as âthe crisisâ. The temperature soared and the pulse became rapid. The patient had to fight to survive. My father refused to fight. He was thinking, I am quite sure, of his beloved daughter, and he was wanting to join her in heaven. So he died. He was fifty-seven years old. My mother had now lost a daughter and a husband all in the space of a few weeks. Heaven knows what it must have felt like to be hit with a double catastrophe like this. Here she was, a young Norwegian in a foreign land, suddenly having to face all alone the very gravest problems and responsibilities. She had five children to look after, three of her own and two by her husbandâs first wife, and to make matters worse, she herself was expecting another baby in two monthsâ time. A less courageous woman would almost certainly have sold the house and packed her bags and headed straight back to Norway with the children. Over there in her own country she had her mother and father willing and waiting to help her, as well as her two unmarried sisters. But she refused to take the easy way out. Her husband had always stated most emphatically that he wished all his children to be educated in English schools. They were the best in the world, he used to say. Better by far than the Norwegian ones. Better even than the Welsh\n\nP:20\n\nMe and Mama Radyr ones, despite the fact that he lived in Wales and had his business there. He maintained that there was some kind of magic about English schooling and that the education it provided had caused the inhabitants of a small island to become a great nation and a great Empire and to produce the worldâs greatest literature. âNo child of mineâ, he kept saying, âis going to school anywhere else but in England.â My mother was determined to carry out the wishes of her dead husband. To accomplish this, she would have to move house from Wales to England, but she wasnât ready for that yet. She must stay here in Wales for a while longer, where she knew people who could help and advise her, especially her husbandâs great friend and partner, Mr Aadnesen. But even if she wasnât leaving Wales quite yet, it was essential that she move to a smaller and more manageable house. She had enough children to look after without having to bother about a farm as well. So as soon as her fifth child (another daughter) was born, she sold the big house and moved to a smaller one a few miles away in Llandaff. It was called Cumberland Lodge and it was nothing more than a pleasant medium-sized suburban villa. So it was in Llandaff two years later, when I was six years old, that I went to my first school.\n\nP:21\n\nMe, six The school was a kindergarten run by two sisters, Mrs Corfield and Miss Tucker, and it was called Elmtree House. It is astonishing how little one remembers about oneâs life before the age of seven or eight. I can tell you all sorts of things that happened to me from eight onwards, but only very few before that. I went for a whole year to Elmtree House but I cannot even remember what my classroom looked like. Nor can I picture the faces of Mrs Corfield or Miss Tucker, although I am sure they were sweet and smiling. I do have a blurred memory of sitting on the stairs and trying over and over again to tie one of my shoelaces, but that is all that comes back to me at this distance of the school itself. On the other hand, I can remember very clearly the journeys I made to and from the school because they were so tremendously exciting. Great excitement is probably the only thing that really interests a six-year-old boy and it sticks in his mind. In my case, the excitement centred around my new tricycle. I rode to school on it every day with my eldest sister riding on hers. No grown-ups came with us, and I can remember oh so vividly how the two of us used to go racing at enormous tricycle speeds down the middle of the road and then, most glorious of all, when we came to a corner, we would lean to one side and take it on two wheels. All this, you must realize, was in the good old days when the sight of a motor-car on the street was an event, and it was quite safe for tiny children to go tricycling and whooping their way to school in the centre of the highway. So much, then, for my memories of kindergarten sixty-two years ago. Itâs not much, but itâs all there is left.\n\nP:23\n\nLlandaff Cathedral School, 1923â5 (age 7â9)\n\nP:25\n\nThe bicycle and the sweetshop When I was seven, my mother decided I should leave kindergarten and go to a proper boyâs school. By good fortune, there existed a well-known Preparatory School for boys about a mile from our house. It was called Llandaff Cathedral School, and it stood right under the shadow of Llandaff cathedral. Like the cathedral, the school is still there and still flourishing. Llandaff Cathedral But here again, I can remember very little about the two years I attended Llandaff Cathedral School, between the age of seven and nine. Only two moments remain clearly in my mind. The first lasted not more than five seconds but I will never forget it. It was my first term and I was walking home alone across the village green after school when suddenly one of the senior twelve-year-old boys came riding full speed down the road on his bicycle about twenty yards away from me. The road was on a hill and the boy was going down the slope, and as he flashed by he started backpedalling very quickly so that the free-wheeling mechanism of his bike made a loud whirring sound. At the same time, he took his hands off the handlebars and folded them casually across his chest. I stopped dead and stared\n\nP:26\n\nafter him. How wonderful he was! How swift and brave and graceful in his long trousers with bicycle-clips around them and his scarlet school cap at a jaunty angle on his head! One day, I told myself, one glorious day I will have a bike like that and I will wear long trousers with bicycle-clips and my school cap will sit jaunty on my head and I will go whizzing down the hill pedalling backwards with no hands on the handlebars! I promise you that if somebody had caught me by the shoulder at that moment and said to me, âWhat is your greatest wish in life, little boy? What is your absolute ambition? To be a doctor? A fine musician? A painter? A writer? Or the Lord Chancellor?â I would have answered without hesitation that my only ambition, my hope, my longing was to have a bike like that and to go whizzing down the hill with no hands on the handlebars. It would be fabulous. It made me tremble just to think about it. My second and only other memory of Llandaff Cathedral School is extremely bizarre. It happened a little over a year later, when I was just nine. By then I had made some friends and when I walked to school in the mornings I would start out alone but would pick up four other boys of my own age along the way. After school was over, the same four boys and I would set out together across the village green and through the village itself, heading for home. On the way to school and on the way back we always passed the sweetshop. No we didnât, we never passed it. We always stopped. We lingered outside its rather small window gazing in at the big glass jars full of Bullâs-eyes and Old Fashioned Humbugs and Strawberry Bonbons and Glacier Mints and Acid Drops and Pear Drops and Lemon Drops and all the rest of them. Each of us received sixpence a week for pocket-money, and whenever there was any money in our pockets, we would all troop in together to buy a pennyworth of this or that. My own favourites were Sherbet Suckers and Liquorice Bootlaces. One of the other boys, whose name was Thwaites, told me I should never eat Liquorice Bootlaces. Thwaitesâs father, who was a doctor, had said that they were made from ratsâ blood. The father had given his young son a lecture about Liquorice Bootlaces when he had caught him eating one in bed. âEvery\n\nP:27\n\nratcatcher in the countryâ, the father had said, âtakes his rats to the Liquorice Bootlace Factory, and the manager pays tuppence for each rat. Many a ratcatcher has become a millionaire by selling his dead rats to the Factory.â âBut how do they turn the rats into liquorice?â the young Thwaites had asked his father. âThey wait until theyâve got ten thousand rats,â the father had answered, âthen they dump them all into a huge shiny steel cauldron and boil them up for several hours. Two men stir the bubbling cauldron with long poles and in the end they have a thick steaming rat-stew. After that, a cruncher is lowered into the cauldron to crunch the bones, and whatâs left is a pulpy substance called rat- mash.â âYes, but how do they turn that into Liquorice Bootlaces, Daddy?â the young Thwaites had asked, and this question, according to Thwaites, had caused his father to pause and think for a few moments before he answered it. At last he had said, âThe two men who were doing the stirring with the long poles now put on their wellington boots and climb into the cauldron and shovel the hot rat- mash out on to a concrete floor. Then they run a steam-roller over it several times to flatten it out. What is left looks rather like a gigantic black pancake, and all they have to do after that is to wait for it to cool and to harden so they can cut it up into strips to make the Bootlaces. Donât ever eat them,â the father had said. âIf you do, youâll get ratitis.â âWhat is ratitis, Daddy?â young Thwaites had asked. âAll the rats that the ratcatchers catch are poisoned with rat-poison,â the father had said. âItâs the rat-poison that gives you ratitis.â âYes, but what happens to you when you catch it?â young Thwaites had asked. âYour teeth become very sharp and pointed,â the father had answered. âAnd a\n\nP:28\n\nshort stumpy tail grows out of your back just above your bottom. There is no cure for ratitis. I ought to know. Iâm a doctor.â We all enjoyed Thwaitesâs story and we made him tell it to us many times on our walks to and from school. But it didnât stop any of us except Thwaites from buying Liquorice Bootlaces. At two for a penny they were the best value in the shop. A Bootlace, in case you havenât had the pleasure of handling one, is not round. Itâs like a flat black tape about half an inch wide. You buy it rolled up in a coil, and in those days it used to be so long that when you unrolled it and held one end at armâs length above your head, the other end touched the ground. Sherbet Suckers were also two a penny. Each Sucker consisted of a yellow cardboard tube filled with sherbet powder, and there was a hollow liquorice straw sticking out of it. (Ratâs blood again, young Thwaites would warn us, pointing at the liquorice straw.) You sucked the sherbet up through the straw and when it was finished you ate the liquorice. They were delicious, those Sherbet Suckers. The sherbet fizzed in your mouth, and if you knew how to do it, you could make white froth come out of your nostrils and pretend you were throwing a fit. Gobstoppers, costing a penny each, were enormous hard round balls the size of small tomatoes. One Gobstopper would provide about an hourâs worth of non- stop sucking and if you took it out of your mouth and inspected it every five minutes or so, you would find it had changed colour. There was something fascinating about the way it went from pink to blue to green to yellow. We used to wonder how in the world the Gobstopper Factory managed to achieve this magic. âHow does it happen?â we would ask each other. âHow can they make it keep changing colour?â âItâs your spit that does it,â young Thwaites proclaimed. As the son of a doctor, he considered himself to be an authority on all things that had to do with the body. He could tell us about scabs and when they were ready to be picked off. He knew why a black eye was blue and why blood was red. âItâs your spit that makes a Gobstopper change colour,â he kept insisting. When we asked him to elaborate on this theory, he answered, âYou wouldnât understand it if I did tell you.â Pear Drops were exciting because they had a dangerous taste. They smelled of nail-varnish and they froze the back of your throat. All of us were warned against eating them, and the result was that we ate them more than ever.\n\nP:29\n\nThen there was a hard brown lozenge called the Tonsil Tickler. The Tonsil Tickler tasted and smelled very strongly of chloroform. We had not the slightest doubt that these things were saturated in the dreaded anaesthetic which, as Thwaites had many times pointed out to us, could put you to sleep for hours at a stretch. âIf my father has to saw off somebodyâs leg,â he said, âhe pours chloroform on to a pad and the person sniffs it and goes to sleep and my father saws his leg off without him even feeling it.â âBut why do they put it into sweets and sell them to us?â we asked him. You might think a question like this would have baffled Thwaites. But Thwaites was never baffled. âMy father says Tonsil Ticklers were invented for dangerous prisoners in jail,â he said. âThey give them one with each meal and the chloroform makes them sleepy and stops them rioting.â âYes,â we said, âbut why sell them to children?â âItâs a plot,â Thwaites said. âA grown-up plot to keep us quiet.â The sweetshop in Llandaff in the year 1923 was the very centre of our lives. To us, it was what a bar is to a drunk, or a church is to a Bishop. Without it, there would have been little to live for. But it had one terrible drawback, this sweetshop. The woman who owned it was a horror. We hated her and we had good reason for doing so. Her name was Mrs Pratchett. She was a small skinny old hag with a moustache on her upper lip and a mouth as sour as a green gooseberry. She never smiled. She never welcomed us when we went in, and the only times she spoke were when she said things like, âIâm watchinâ you so keep yer thievinâ fingers off them chocolates!â Or âI donât want you in âere just to look around! Either you forks out or you gets out!â But by far the most loathsome thing about Mrs Pratchett was the filth that clung around her. Her apron was grey and greasy. Her blouse had bits of breakfast all over it, toast-crumbs and tea stains and splotches of dried egg-yolk. It was her hands, however, that disturbed us most. They were disgusting. They were black with dirt and grime. They looked as though they had been putting lumps of coal on the fire all day long. And do not forget please that it was these very hands and fingers that she plunged into the sweet-jars when we asked for a\n\nP:30\n\npennyworth of Treacle Toffee or Wine Gums or Nut Clusters or whatever. There were precious few health laws in those days, and nobody, least of all Mrs Pratchett, ever thought of using a little shovel for getting out the sweets as they do today. The mere sight of her grimy right hand with its black fingernails digging an ounce of Chocolate Fudge out of a jar would have caused a starving tramp to go running from the shop. But not us. Sweets were our life-blood. We would have put up with far worse than that to get them. So we simply stood and watched in sullen silence while this disgusting old woman stirred around inside the jars with her foul fingers. The other thing we hated Mrs Pratchett for was her meanness. Unless you spent a whole sixpence all in one go, she wouldnât give you a bag. Instead you got your sweets twisted up in a small piece of newspaper which she tore off a pile of old Daily Mirrors lying on the counter. So you can well understand that we had it in for Mrs Pratchett in a big way, but we didnât quite know what to do about it. Many schemes were put forward but none of them was any good. None of them, that is, until suddenly, one memorable afternoon, we found the dead mouse.\n\nP:31\n\nThe Great Mouse Plot My four friends and I had come across a loose floor-board at the back of the classroom, and when we prised it up with the blade of a pocket-knife, we discovered a big hollow space underneath. This, we decided, would be our secret hiding place for sweets and other small treasures such as conkers and monkey- nuts and birdsâ eggs. Every afternoon, when the last lesson was over, the five of us would wait until the classroom had emptied, then we would lift up the floor- board and examine our secret hoard, perhaps adding to it or taking something away. One day, when we lifted it up, we found a dead mouse lying among our treasures. It was an exciting discovery. Thwaites took it out by its tail and waved it in front of our faces. âWhat shall we do with it?â he cried. âIt stinks!â someone shouted. âThrow it out of the window quick!â âHold on a tick,â I said. âDonât throw it away.â Thwaites hesitated. They all looked at me. When writing about oneself, one must strive to be truthful. Truth is more important than modesty. I must tell you, therefore, that it was I and I alone who had the idea for the great and daring Mouse Plot. We all have our moments of brilliance and glory, and this was mine. âWhy donât weâ, I said, âslip it into one of Mrs Pratchettâs jars of sweets? Then when she puts her dirty hand in to grab a handful, sheâll grab a stinky dead mouse instead.â The other four stared at me in wonder. Then, as the sheer genius of the plot began to sink in, they all started grinning. They slapped me on the back. They cheered me and danced around the classroom. âWeâll do it today!â they cried. âWeâll do it on the way home! You had the idea,â they said to me, âso you can be the one to put the mouse in the jar.â Thwaites handed me the mouse. I put it into my trouser pocket. Then the five of us left the school, crossed the village green and headed for the sweetshop. We\n\nP:32\n\nwere tremendously jazzed up. We felt like a gang of desperados setting out to rob a train or blow up the sheriffâs office. âMake sure you put it into a jar which is used often,â somebody said. âIâm putting it in Gobstoppers,â I said. âThe Gobstopper jar is never behind the counter.â âIâve got a penny,â Thwaites said, âso Iâll ask for one Sherbet Sucker and one Bootlace. And while she turns away to get them, you slip the mouse in quickly with the Gobstoppers.â Thus everything was arranged. We were strutting a little as we entered the shop. We were the victors now and Mrs Pratchett was the victim. She stood behind the counter, and her small malignant pig-eyes watched us suspiciously as we came forward. âOne Sherbet Sucker, please,â Thwaites said to her, holding out his penny. I kept to the rear of the group, and when I saw Mrs Pratchett turn her head away for a couple of seconds to fish a Sherbet Sucker out of the box, I lifted the heavy glass lid of the Gobstopper jar and dropped the mouse in. Then I replaced the lid as silently as possible. My heart was thumping like mad and my hands had gone all sweaty. âAnd one Bootlace, please,â I heard Thwaites saying. When I turned round, I saw Mrs Pratchett holding out the Bootlace in her filthy fingers. âI donât want all the lot of you troopinâ in âere if only one of you is buyinâ, she screamed at us. âNow beat it! Go on, get out!â As soon as we were outside, we broke into a run. âDid you do it?â they shouted at me. âOf course I did!â I said. âWell done you!â they cried. âWhat a super show!â I felt like a hero. I was a hero. It was marvellous to be so popular.\n\nP:34\n\nMr Coombes The flush of triumph over the dead mouse was carried forward to the next morning as we all met again to walk to school. âLetâs go in and see if itâs still in the jar,â somebody said as we approached the sweetshop. âDonât,â Thwaites said firmly. âItâs too dangerous. Walk past as though nothing has happened.â As we came level with the shop we saw a cardboard notice hanging on the door. We stopped and stared. We had never known the sweetshop to be closed at this time in the morning, even on Sundays. âWhatâs happened?â we asked each other. âWhatâs going on?â We pressed our faces against the window and looked inside. Mrs Pratchett was nowhere to be seen. âLook!â I cried. âThe Gobstopper jarâs gone! Itâs not on the shelf! Thereâs a gap where it used to be!â âItâs on the floor!â someone said. âItâs smashed to bits and thereâs Gobstoppers everywhere!â âThereâs the mouse!â someone else shouted. We could see it all, the huge glass jar smashed to smithereens with the dead mouse lying in the wreckage and hundreds of many-coloured Gobstoppers littering the floor. âShe got such a shock when she grabbed hold of the mouse that she dropped everything,â somebody was saying. âBut why didnât she sweep it all up and open the shop?â I asked.\n\nP:35\n\nNobody answered me. We turned away and walked towards the school. All of a sudden we had begun to feel slightly uncomfortable. There was something not quite right about the shop being closed. Even Thwaites was unable to offer a reasonable explanation. We became silent. There was a faint scent of danger in the air now. Each one of us had caught a whiff of it. Alarm bells were beginning to ring faintly in our ears. After a while, Thwaites broke the silence. âShe must have got one heck of a shock,â he said. He paused. We all looked at him, wondering what wisdom the great medical authority was going to come out with next. âAfter all,â he went on, âto catch hold of a dead mouse when youâre expecting to catch hold of a Gobstopper must be a pretty frightening experience. Donât you agree?â Nobody answered him. âWell now,â Thwaites went on, âwhen an old person like Mrs Pratchett suddenly gets a very big shock, I suppose you know what happens next?â âWhat?â we said. âWhat happens?â âYou ask my father,â Thwaites said. âHeâll tell you.â âYou tell us,â we said. âIt gives her a heart attack,â Thwaites announced. âHer heart stops beating and sheâs dead in five seconds.â For a moment or two my own heart stopped beating. Thwaites pointed a finger at me and said darkly, âIâm afraid youâve killed her.â âMe?â I cried. âWhy just me?â âIt was your idea,â he said. âAnd whatâs more, you put the mouse in.â All of a sudden, I was a murderer.\n\nP:36\n\nAt exactly that point, we heard the school bell ringing in the distance and we had to gallop the rest of the way so as not to be late for prayers. Prayers were held in the Assembly Hall. We all perched in rows on wooden benches while the teachers sat up on the platform in armchairs, facing us. The five of us scrambled into our places just as the Headmaster marched in, followed by the rest of the staff. The Headmaster is the only teacher at Llandaff Cathedral School that I can remember, and for a reason you will soon discover, I can remember him very clearly indeed. His name was Mr Coombes and I have a picture in my mind of a giant of a man with a face like a ham and a mass of rusty-coloured hair that sprouted in a tangle all over the top of his head. All grown-ups appear as giants to small children. But Headmasters (and policemen) are the biggest giants of all and acquire a marvellously exaggerated stature. It is possible that Mr Coombes was a perfectly normal being, but in my memory he was a giant, a tweed-suited giant who always wore a black gown over his tweeds and a waistcoat under his jacket. Mr Coombes now proceeded to mumble through the same old prayers we had every day, but this morning, when the last amen had been spoken, he did not turn and lead his group rapidly out of the Hall as usual. He remained standing before us, and it was clear he had an announcement to make. âThe whole school is to go out and line up around the playground immediately,â he said. âLeave your books behind. And no talking.â Mr Coombes was looking grim. His hammy pink face had taken on that\n\nP:37\n\ndangerous scowl which only appeared when he was extremely cross and somebody was for the high-jump. I sat there small and frightened among the rows and rows of other boys, and to me at that moment the Headmaster, with his black gown draped over his shoulders, was like a judge at a murder trial. âHeâs after the killer,â Thwaites whispered to me. I began to shiver. âIâll bet the police are here already,â Thwaites went on. âAnd the Black Mariaâs waiting outside.â As we made our way out to the playground, my whole stomach began to feel as though it was slowly filling up with swirling water. I am only eight years old, I told myself. No little boy of eight has ever murdered anyone. Itâs not possible. Out in the playground on this warm cloudy September morning, the Deputy Headmaster was shouting, âLine up in forms! Sixth Form over there! Fifth Form next to them! Spread out! Spread out! Get on with it! Stop talking all of you!â Thwaites and I and my other three friends were in the Second Form, the lowest but one, and we lined up against the red-brick wall of the playground shoulder to shoulder. I can remember that when every boy in the school was in his place, the line stretched right round the four sides of the playground â about one hundred small boys altogether, aged between six and twelve, all of us wearing identical grey shorts and grey blazers and grey stockings and black shoes. âStop that talking!â shouted the Deputy Head. âI want absolute silence!â But why for heavenâs sake were we in the playground at all? I wondered. And why were we lined up like this? It had never happened before. I half-expected to see two policemen come bounding out of the school to grab me by the arms and put handcuffs on my wrists. A single door led out from the school on to the playground. Suddenly it swung open and through it, like the angel of death, strode Mr Coombes, huge and bulky in his tweed suit and black gown, and beside him, believe it or not, right beside him trotted the tiny figure of Mrs Pratchett herself! Mrs Pratchett was alive! The relief was tremendous. âSheâs alive!â I whispered to Thwaites standing next to me. âI didnât kill her!â Thwaites ignored me. âWeâll start over here,â Mr Coombes was saying to Mrs Pratchett. He grasped her by one of her skinny arms and led her over to where the Sixth Form was standing. Then, still keeping hold of her arm, he proceeded to lead her at a brisk\n\nP:38\n\nwalk down the line of boys. It was like someone inspecting the troops. âWhat on earth are they doing?â I whispered. Thwaites didnât answer me. I glanced at him. He had gone rather pale. âToo big,â I heard Mrs Pratchett saying. âMuch too big. Itâs none of this lot. Letâs âave a look at some of them titchy ones.â Mr Coombes increased his pace. âWeâd better go all the way round,â he said. He seemed in a hurry to get it over with now and I could see Mrs Pratchettâs skinny goatâs legs trotting to keep up with him. They had already inspected one side of the playground where the Sixth Form and half the Fifth Form were standing. We watched them moving down the second sideâ¦ then the third side. âStill too big,â I heard Mrs Pratchett croaking. âMuch too big! Smaller than these! Much smaller! Whereâs them nasty little ones?â They were coming closer to us nowâ¦ closer and closer. They were starting on the fourth sideâ¦ Every boy in our form was watching Mr Coombes and Mrs Pratchett as they came walking down the line towards us. âNasty cheeky lot, these little âuns!â I heard Mrs Pratchett muttering. âThey comes into my shop and they thinks they can do what they damn well likes!â Mr Coombes made no reply to this. âThey nick things when I ainât lookingâ,â she went on. âThey put their grubby âands all over everything and theyâve got no manners. I donât mind girls. I never âave no trouble with girls, but boys is âideous and âorrible! I donât âave to tell you that, âEadmaster, do I?â âThese are the smaller ones,â Mr Coombes said. I could see Mrs Pratchettâs piggy little eyes staring hard at the face of each boy she passed. Suddenly she let out a high-pitched yell and pointed a dirty finger straight at Thwaites. âThatâs âim!â she yelled. âThatâs one of âem! Iâd know âim a mile away, the scummy little bounder!â The entire school turned to look at Thwaites. âW-what have I done?â he stuttered, appealing to Mr Coombes. âShut up,â Mr Coombes said. Mrs Pratchettâs eyes flicked over and settled on my own face. I looked down and studied the black asphalt surface of the playground. ââEreâs another of âem!â I heard her yelling. âThat one there!â She was pointing at me now.\n\nP:39\n\nâYouâre quite sure?â Mr Coombes said. âOf course Iâm sure!â she cried. âI never forgets a face, least of all when itâs as sly as that! âEeâs one of âem all right! There was five altogether! Now whereâs them other three?â The other three, as I knew very well, were coming up next. Mrs Pratchettâs face was glimmering with venom as her eyes travelled beyond me down the line. âThere they are!â she cried out, stabbing the air with her finger. â âImâ¦ and âimâ¦ and âim! Thatâs the five of âem all right! We donât need to look no farther than this, âEadmaster! Theyâre all âere, the nasty dirty little pigs! Youâve got their names, âave you?â âIâve got their names, Mrs Pratchett,â Mr Coombes told her. âIâm much obliged to you.â âAnd Iâm much obliged to you, âEadmaster,â she answered. As Mr Coombes led her away across the playground, we heard her saying, âRight in the jar of Gobstoppers it was! A stinkinâ dead mouse which I will never forget as long as I live!â âYou have my deepest sympathy,â Mr Coombes was muttering. âTalk about shocks!â she went on. âWhen my fingers caught âold of that nasty soggy stinkinâ dead mouseâ¦â Her voice trailed away as Mr Coombes led her quickly through the door into the school building.\n\nP:40\n\nMrs Pratchettâs revenge Our form master came into the classroom with a piece of paper in his hand. âThe following are to report to the Headmasterâs study at once,â he said. âThwaitesâ¦ Dahlâ¦â And then he read out the other three names which I have forgotten. The five of us stood up and left the room. We didnât speak as we made our way down the long corridor into the Headmasterâs private quarters where the dreaded study was situated. Thwaites knocked on the door. âEnter!â We sidled in. The room smelled of leather and tobacco. Mr Coombes was standing in the middle of it, dominating everything, a giant of a man if ever there was one, and in his hands he held a long yellow cane which curved round the top like a walking stick. âI donât want any lies,â he said. âI know very well you did it and you were all in it together. Line up over there against the bookcase.â We lined up, Thwaites in front and I, for some reason, at the very back. I was last in the line. âYou,â Mr Coombes said, pointing the cane at Thwaites, âCome over here.â Thwaites went forward very slowly. âBend over,â Mr Coombes said. Thwaites bent over. Our eyes were riveted on him. We were hypnotized by it all. We knew, of course, that boys got the cane now and again, but we had never heard of anyone being made to watch. âTighter, boy, tighter!â Mr Coombes snapped out. âTouch the ground!â Thwaites touched the carpet with the tips of his fingers. Mr Coombes stood back and took up a firm stance with his legs well apart. I thought how small Thwaitesâs bottom looked and how very tight it was. Mr Coombes had his eyes focused squarely upon it. He raised the cane high above\n\nP:41\n\nhis shoulder, and as he brought it down, it made a loud swishing sound, and then there was a crack like a pistol shot as it struck Thwaitesâs bottom. Little Thwaites seemed to lift about a foot into the air and he yelled âOw-w-w- w-w-w-w-w-w-w!â and straightened up like elastic. â âArder!â shrieked a voice from over in the corner. Now it was our turn to jump. We looked round and there, sitting in one of Mr Coombesâs big leather armchairs, was the tiny loathsome figure of Mrs Pratchett! She was bounding up and down with excitement. âLay it into âim!â she was shrieking. âLet âim âave it! Teach âim a lesson!â âGet down, boy!â Mr Coombes ordered. âAnd stay down! You get an extra one every time you straighten up!â âThatâs tellinâ âim!â shrieked Mrs Pratchett. âThatâs tellinâ the little blighter!â I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It was like some awful pantomime. The violence was bad enough, and being made to watch it was even worse, but with Mrs Pratchett in the audience the whole thing became a nightmare. Swish-crack! went the cane. âOw-w-w-w-w!â yelled Thwaites. ââArder!â shrieked Mrs Pratchett. âStitch âim up! Make it sting! Tickle âim up good and proper! Warm âis backside for âim! Go on, warm it up, âEadmaster!â Thwaites received four strokes, and by gum, they were four real whoppers. âNext!â snapped Mr Coombes. Thwaites came hopping past us on his toes, clutching his bottom with both hands and yelling, âOw! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Owwwww!â With tremendous reluctance, the next boy sidled forward to his fate. I stood there wishing I hadnât been last in the line. The watching and waiting were probably even greater torture than the event itself.\n\nP:42\n\nMr Coombesâs performance the second time was the same as the first. So was Mrs Pratchettâs. She kept up her screeching all the way through, exhorting Mr Coombes to greater and still greater efforts, and the awful thing was that he seemed to be responding to her cries. He was like an athlete who is spurred on by the shouts of the crowd in the stands. Whether this was true or not, I was sure of one thing. He wasnât weakening. My own turn came at last. My mind was swimming and my eyes had gone all blurry as I went forward to bend over. I can remember wishing my mother would suddenly come bursting into the room shouting, âStop! How dare you do that to my son!â But she didnât. All I heard was Mrs Pratchettâs dreadful high- pitched voice behind me screeching, âThis oneâs the cheekiest of the bloominâ lot, âEadmaster! Make sure you let âim âave it good and strong!â Mr Coombes did just that. As the first stroke landed and the pistol-crack sounded, I was thrown forward so violently that if my fingers hadnât been touching the carpet, I think I would have fallen flat on my face. As it was, I was able to catch myself on the palms of my hands and keep my balance. At first I heard only the crack and felt absolutely nothing at all, but a fraction of a second later the burning sting that flooded across my buttocks was so terrific that all I could do was gasp. I gave a great gushing gasp that emptied my lungs of every breath of air that was in them. It felt, I promise you, as though someone had laid a red-hot poker against my flesh and was pressing down on it hard. The second stroke was worse than the first and this was probably because Mr Coombes was well practised and had a splendid aim. He was able, so it seemed, to land the second one almost exactly across the narrow line where the first one\n\nP:43\n\nhad struck. It is bad enough when the cane lands on fresh skin, but when it comes down on bruised and wounded flesh, the agony is unbelievable. The third one seemed even worse than the second. Whether or not the wily Mr Coombes had chalked the cane beforehand and had thus made an aiming mark on my grey flannel shorts after the first stroke, I do not know. I am inclined to doubt it because he must have known that this was a practice much frowned upon by Headmasters in general in those days. It was not only regarded as unsporting, it was also an admission that you were not an expert at the job. By the time the fourth stroke was delivered, my entire backside seemed to be going up in flames. Far away in the distance, I heard Mr Coombesâs voice saying, âNow get out.â As I limped across the study clutching my buttocks hard with both hands, a cackling sound came from the armchair over in the corner, and then I heard the vinegary voice of Mrs Pratchett saying, âI am much obliged to you, âEadmaster, very much obliged. I donât think we is goinâ to see any more stinkinâ mice in my Gobstoppers from now on.â When I returned to the classroom my eyes were wet with tears and everybody stared at me. My bottom hurt when I sat down at my desk. That evening after supper my three sisters had their baths before me. Then it was my turn, but as I was about to step into the bathtub, I heard a horrified gasp from my mother behind me. âWhatâs this?â she gasped. âWhatâs happened to you?â She was staring at my bottom. I myself had not inspected it up to then, but when I twisted my head around and took a look at one of my buttocks, I saw the scarlet stripes and the deep blue bruising in between. âWho did this?â my mother cried. âTell me at once!â In the end I had to tell her the whole story, while my three sisters (aged nine, six and four) stood around in their nighties listening goggle-eyed. My mother heard me out in silence. She asked no questions. She just let me talk, and when I had finished, she said to our nurse, âYou get them into bed, Nanny. Iâm going out.â If I had had the slightest idea of what she was going to do next, I would have tried to stop her, but I hadnât. She went straight downstairs and put on her hat. Then she marched out of the house, down the drive and on to the road. I saw her through my bedroom window as she went out of the gates and turned left, and I remember calling out to her to come back, come back, come back. But she took no notice of me. She was walking very quickly, with her head held high and her\n\nP:44\n\nbody erect, and by the look of things I figured that Mr Coombes was in for a hard time. About an hour later, my mother returned and came upstairs to kiss us all goodnight. âI wish you hadnât done that,â I said to her. âIt makes me look silly.â âThey donât beat small children like that where I come from,â she said. âI wonât allow it.â âWhat did Mr Coombes say to you, Mama?â âHe told me I was a foreigner and I didnât understand how British schools were run,â she said. âDid he get ratty with you?â âVery ratty,â she said. âHe told me that if I didnât like his methods I could take you away.â âWhat did you say?â âI said I would, as soon as the school year is finished. I shall find you an English school this time,â she said. âYour father was right. English schools are the best in the world.â âDoes that mean itâll be a boarding school?â I asked. âItâll have to be,â she said. âIâm not quite ready to move the whole family to England yet.â So I stayed on at Llandaff Cathedral School until the end of the summer term.\n\nP:45\n\nGoing to Norway The summer holidays! Those magic words! The mere mention of them used to send shivers of joy rippling over my skin. All my summer holidays, from when I was four years old to when I was seventeen (1920 to 1932), were totally idyllic. This, I am certain, was because we always went to the same idyllic place and that place was Norway. Except for my ancient half-sister and my not-quite-so-ancient half-brother, the rest of us were all pure Norwegian by blood. We all spoke Norwegian and all our relations lived over there. So in a way, going to Norway every summer was like going home. Even the journey was an event. Do not forget that there were no commercial aeroplanes in those times, so it took us four whole days to complete the trip out and another four days to get home again. We were always an enormous party. There were my three sisters and my ancient half-sister (thatâs four), and my half-brother and me (thatâs six), and my mother (thatâs seven), and Nanny (thatâs eight), and in addition to these, there were never less than two others who were some sort of anonymous ancient friends of the ancient half-sister (thatâs ten altogether).\n\nP:46\n\nLooking back on it now, I donât know how my mother did it. There were all those train bookings and boat bookings and hotel bookings to be made in advance by letter. She had to make sure that we had enough shorts and shirts and sweaters and gymshoes and bathing costumes (you couldnât even buy a shoelace on the island we were going to), and the packing must have been a nightmare. Six huge trunks were carefully packed, as well as countless suitcases, and when the great departure day arrived, the ten of us, together with our mountains of luggage, would set out on the first and easiest step of the journey, the train to London. When we arrived in London, we tumbled into three taxis and went clattering across the great city to Kingâs Cross, where we got on to the train for Newcastle, two hundred miles to the north. The trip to Newcastle took about five hours, and when we arrived there, we needed three more taxis to take us from the station to the docks, where our boat would be waiting. The next stop after that would be Oslo, the capital of Norway. When I was young, the capital of Norway was not called Oslo. It was called Christiania. But somewhere along the line, the Norwegians decided to do away with that pretty name and call it Oslo instead. As children, we always knew it as Christiania, but if I call it that here we shall only get confused, so I had better stick to Oslo all the way through. The sea journey from Newcastle to Oslo took two days and a night, and if it was rough, as it often was, all of us got seasick except our dauntless mother. We used to lie in deck-chairs on the promenade deck, within easy reach of the rails, embalmed in rugs, our faces slate-grey and our stomachs churning, refusing the hot soup and shipâs biscuits the kindly steward kept offering us. And as for poor Nanny, she began to feel sick the moment she set foot on deck. âI hate these things!â she used to say. âIâm sure weâll never get there! Which lifeboat do we go to when it starts to sink?â Then she would retire to her cabin, where she stayed groaning and trembling until the ship was firmly tied up at the quayside in Oslo harbour the next day. We always stopped off for one night in Oslo so that we could have a grand annual family reunion with Bestemama and Bestepapa, our motherâs parents, and with her two maiden sisters (our aunts) who lived in the same house. When we got off the boat, we all went in a cavalcade of taxis straight to the Grand Hotel, where we would sleep one night, to drop off our luggage. Then, keeping the same taxis, we drove on to the grandparentsâ house, where an emotional welcome awaited us. All of us were embraced and kissed many times and tears flowed down wrinkled old cheeks and suddenly that quiet gloomy\n\nP:47\n\nhouse came alive with many childrenâs voices. Ever since I first saw her, Bestemama was terrifically ancient. She was a white-haired wrinkly-faced old bird who seemed always to be sitting in her rocking-chair, rocking away and smiling benignly at this vast influx of grandchildren who barged in from miles away to take over her house for a few hours every year. Bestepapa was the quiet one. He was a small dignified scholar with a white goatee beard, and as far as I could gather, he was an astrologer, a meteorologist and a speaker of ancient Greek. Like Bestemama, he sat most of the time quietly in a chair, saying very little and totally overwhelmed, I imagine, by the raucous rabble who were destroying his neat and polished home. The two things I remember most about Bestepapa were that he wore black boots and that he smoked an extraordinary pipe. The bowl of his pipe was made of meerschaum clay, and it had a flexible stem about three feet long so that the bowl rested on his lap. All the grown-ups including Nanny, and all the children, even when the youngest was only a year old, sat down around the big oval dining-room table on the afternoon of our arrival, for the great annual celebration feast with the grandparents, and the food we received never varied. This was a Norwegian household, and for the Norwegians the best food in the world is fish. And when they say fish, they donât mean the sort of thing you and I get from the fishmonger. They mean fresh fish, fish that has been caught no more than twenty-four hours before and has never been frozen or chilled on a block of ice. I agree with them that the proper way to prepare fish like this is to poach it, and\n\nP:48\n\nthat is what they do with the finest specimens. And Norwegians, by the way, always eat the skin of the boiled fish, which they say has the best taste of all. So naturally this great celebration feast started with fish. A massive fish, a flounder as big as a tea-tray and as thick as your arm was brought to the table. It had nearly black skin on top which was covered with brilliant orange spots, and it had, of course, been perfectly poached. Large white hunks of this fish were carved out and put on to our plates, and with it we had hollandaise sauce and boiled new potatoes. Nothing else. And by gosh, it was delicious. As soon as the remains of the fish had been cleared away, a tremendous craggy mountain of home-made ice-cream would be carried in. Apart from being the creamiest ice-cream in the world, the flavour was unforgettable. There were thousands of little chips of crisp burnt toffee mixed into it (the Norwegians call it krokan), and as a result it didnât simply melt in your mouth like ordinary ice- cream. You chewed it and it went crunch and the taste was something you dreamed about for days afterwards. This great feast would be interrupted by a small speech of welcome from my grandfather, and the grown-ups would raise their long-stemmed wine glasses and say âskaalâ many times throughout the meal. When the guzzling was over, those who were considered old enough were given small glasses of home-made liqueur, a colourless but fiery drink that smelled of mulberries. The glasses were raised again and again, and the âskaalingâ seemed to go on for ever. In Norway, you may select any individual around the table and skaal him or her in a small private ceremony. You first lift your glass high and call out the name. âBestemama!â you say. âSkaal, Bestemama!â\n\nP:49\n\nBestemama and Bestepapa (and Astri) She will then lift her own glass and hold it up high. At the same time your own eyes meet hers, and you must keep looking deep into her eyes as you sip your drink. After you have both done this, you raise your glasses high up again in a sort of silent final salute, and only then does each person look away and set down his glass. It is a serious and solemn ceremony, and as a rule on formal occasions everyone skaals everyone else round the table once. If there are, for example, ten people present and you are one of them, you will skaal your nine companions once each individually, and you yourself will also receive nine separate skaals at different times during the meal â eighteen in all. Thatâs how they work it in polite society over there, at least they used to in the old days, and quite a business it was. By the time I was ten, I would be permitted to take part in these ceremonies, and I always finished up as tipsy as a lord.\n\nP:50\n\nThe magic island The next morning, everyone got up early and eager to continue the journey. There was another full dayâs travelling to be done before we reached our final destination, most of it by boat. So after a rapid breakfast, our cavalcade left the Grand Hotel in three more taxis and headed for Oslo docks. There we went on board a small coastal steamer, and Nanny was heard to say, âIâm sure it leaks! We shall all be food for the fishes before the day is out!â Then she would disappear below for the rest of the trip. We loved this part of the journey. The splendid little vessel with its single tall funnel would move out into the calm waters of the fjord and proceed at a leisurely pace along the coast, stopping every hour or so at a small wooden jetty where a group of villagers and summer people would be waiting to welcome friends or to collect parcels and mail. Unless you have sailed down the Oslofjord like this yourself on a tranquil summerâs day, you cannot imagine what it is like. It is impossible to describe the sensation of absolute peace and beauty that surrounds you. The boat weaves in and out between countless tiny islands, some with small brightly painted wooden houses on them, but many with not a house or a tree on the bare rocks. These granite rocks are so smooth that you can lie and sun yourself on them in your bathing-costume without putting a towel\n\nP:51\n\nunderneath. We would see long-legged girls and tall boys basking on the rocks of the islands. There are no sandy beaches on the fjord. The rocks go straight down to the waterâs edge and the water is immediately deep. As a result, Norwegian children all learn to swim when they are very young because if you canât swim it is difficult to find a place to bathe. Sometimes when our little vessel slipped between two small islands, the channel was so narrow we could almost touch the rocks on either side. We would pass row-boats and canoes with flaxen-haired children in them, their skins browned by the sun, and we would wave to them and watch their tiny boats rocking violently in the swell that our larger ship left behind. Late in the afternoon, we would come finally to the end of the journey, the island of TjÃ¶me. This was where our mother always took us. Heaven knows how she found it, but to us it was the greatest place on earth. About two hundred yards from the jetty, along a narrow dusty road, stood a simple wooden hotel painted white. It was run by an elderly couple whose faces I still remember vividly, and every year they welcomed us like old friends. Everything about the hotel was extremely primitive, except the dining-room. The walls, the ceiling and the floor of our bedrooms were made of plain unvarnished pine planks. There was a washbasin and a jug of cold water in each of them. The lavatories were in a rickety wooden outhouse at the back of the hotel and each cubicle contained nothing more than a round hole cut in a piece of wood. You sat on the hole and what you did there dropped into a pit ten feet below. If you looked down the hole, you would often see rats scurrying about in the gloom. All this we took for granted. Breakfast was the best meal of the day in our hotel, and it was all laid out on a huge table in the middle of the dining-room from which you helped yourself. There were maybe fifty different dishes to choose from on that table. There were\n\nP:52\n\nlarge jugs of milk, which all Norwegian children drink at every meal. There were plates of cold beef, veal, ham and pork. There was cold boiled mackerel submerged in aspic. There were spiced and pickled herring fillets, sardines, smoked eels and codâs roe. There was a large bowl piled high with hot boiled eggs. There were cold omelettes with chopped ham in them, and cold chicken and hot coffee for the grown-ups, and hot crisp rolls baked in the hotel kitchen, which we ate with butter and cranberry jam. There were stewed apricots and five or six different cheeses including of course the ever-present gjetost, that tall brown rather sweet Norwegian goatâs cheese which you find on just about every table in the land. After breakfast, we collected our bathing things and the whole party, all ten of us, would pile into our boat. Everyone has some sort of a boat in Norway. Nobody sits around in front of the hotel. Nor does anyone sit on the beach because there arenât any beaches to sit on. In the early days, we had only a row-boat, but a very fine one it was. It carried all of us easily, with places for two rowers. My mother took one pair of oars and my fairly ancient half-brother took the other, and off we would go. My mother and the half-brother (he was somewhere around eighteen then) were expert rowers. They kept in perfect time and the oars went click-click, click-click in their wooden rowlocks, and the rowers never paused once during the long forty-minute journey. The rest of us sat in the boat trailing our fingers in the clear water and looking for jellyfish. We skimmed across the sound and went whizzing through narrow channels with rocky islands on either side, heading as always for a very secret tiny patch of sand on a distant island that only we knew about. In the early days we needed a place like this where we could paddle and play about because my youngest sister was only one, the next sister was three and I was four. The rocks and the deep water were no good to us. Every day, for several summers, that tiny secret sand-patch on that tiny secret island was our regular destination. We would stay there for three or four hours, messing about in the water and in the rockpools and getting extraordinarily sunburnt.\n\nP:53\n\nMe, Alfhild, Else â Norway 1924 In later years, when we were all a little older and could swim, the daily routine became different. By then, my mother had acquired a motor-boat, a small and not very seaworthy white wooden vessel which sat far too low in the water and was powered by an unreliable one-cylinder engine. The fairly ancient half- brother was the only one who could make the engine go at all. It was extremely difficult to start, and he always had to unscrew the sparking-plug and pour petrol into the cylinder. Then he swung a fly wheel round and round, and with a bit of luck, after a lot of coughing and spluttering, the thing would finally get going. When we first acquired the motor-boat, my youngest sister was four and I was seven, and by then all of us had learnt to swim. The exciting new boat made it possible for us to go much farther afield, and every day we would travel far out into the fjord, hunting for a different island. There were hundreds of them to choose from. Some were very small, no more than thirty yards long. Others were quite large, maybe half a mile in length. It was wonderful to have such a choice of places, and it was terrific fun to explore each island before we went swimming off the rocks. There were the wooden skeletons of shipwrecked boats on those islands, and big white bones (were they human bones?), and wild raspberries, and mussels clinging to the rocks, and some of the islands had shaggy longhaired goats on them, and even sheep.\n\nP:54\n\nNow and again, when we were out in the open water beyond the chain of islands, the sea became very rough, and that was when my mother enjoyed herself most. Nobody, not even the tiny children, bothered with lifebelts in those days. We would cling to the sides of our funny little white motor-boat, driving through mountainous white-capped waves and getting drenched to the skin, while my mother calmly handled the tiller. There were times, I promise you, when the waves were so high that as we slid down into a trough the whole world disappeared from sight. Then up and up the little boat would climb, standing almost vertically on its tail, until we reached the crest of the next wave, and then it was like being on top of a foaming mountain. It requires great skill to handle a small boat in seas like these. The thing can easily capsize or be swamped if the bows do not meet the great combing breakers at just the right angle. But my mother knew exactly how to do it, and we were never afraid. We loved every minute of it, all of us except for our long-suffering Nanny, who would bury her face in her hands and call aloud upon the Lord to save her soul. In the early evenings we nearly always went out fishing. We collected mussels from the rocks for bait, then we got into either the row-boat or the motor-boat and pushed off to drop anchor later in some likely spot. The water was very deep and often we had to let out two hundred feet of line before we touched bottom. We would sit silent and tense, waiting for a bite, and it always amazed me how even a little nibble at the end of that long line would be transmitted to oneâs fingers. âA bite!â someone would shout, jerking the line. âIâve got him! Itâs a big one! Itâs a whopper!â And then came the thrill of hauling in the line hand over hand and peering over the side into the clear water to see how big the fish really was as he neared the surface. Cod, whiting, haddock and mackerel, we caught them all and bore them back triumphantly to the hotel kitchen where the cheery fat woman who did the cooking promised to get them ready for our supper. I tell you, my friends, those were the days.\n\nP:56\n\nA visit to the doctor I have only one unpleasant memory of the summer holidays in Norway. We were in the grandparentsâ house in Oslo and my mother said to me, âWe are going to the doctor this afternoon. He wants to look at your nose and mouth.â I think I was eight at the time. âWhatâs wrong with my nose and mouth?â I asked. âNothing much,â my mother said. âBut I think youâve got adenoids.â âWhat are they?â I asked her. âDonât worry about it,â she said. âItâs nothing.â I held my motherâs hand as we walked to the doctorâs house. It took us about half an hour. There was a kind of dentistâs chair in the surgery and I was lifted into it. The doctor had a round mirror strapped to his forehead and he peered up my nose and into my mouth. He then took my mother aside and they held a whispered conversation. I saw my mother looking rather grim, but she nodded. The doctor now put some water to boil in an aluminium mug over a gas flame, and into the boiling water he placed a long thin shiny steel instrument. I sat there watching the steam coming off the boiling water. I was not in the least apprehensive. I was too young to realize that something out of the ordinary was going to happen. Then a nurse dressed in white came in. She was carrying a red rubber apron and a curved white enamel bowl. She put the apron over the front of my body and tied it around my neck. It was far too big. Then she held the enamel bowl under my chin. The curve of the bowl fitted perfectly against the curve of my chest. The doctor was bending over me. In his hand he held that long shiny steel instrument. He held it right in front of my face, and to this day I can still describe it perfectly. It was about the thickness and length of a pencil, and like most pencils it had a lot of sides to it. Toward the end, the metal became much thinner, and at the very end of the thin bit of metal there was a tiny blade set at an angle. The blade wasnât more than a centimetre long, very small, very sharp and very shiny.\n\nP:57\n\nâOpen your mouth,â the doctor said, speaking Norwegian. I refused. I thought he was going to do something to my teeth, and everything anyone had ever done to my teeth had been painful. âIt wonât take two seconds,â the doctor said. He spoke gently, and I was seduced by his voice. Like an ass, I opened my mouth. The tiny blade flashed in the bright light and disappeared into my mouth. It went high up into the roof of my mouth, and the hand that held the blade gave four or five very quick little twists and the next moment, out of my mouth into the basin came tumbling a whole mass of flesh and blood. I was too shocked and outraged to do anything but yelp. I was horrified by the huge red lumps that had fallen out of my mouth into the white basin and my first thought was that the doctor had cut out the whole of the middle of my head. âThose were your adenoids,â I heard the doctor saying. I sat there gasping. The roof of my mouth seemed to be on fire. I grabbed my motherâs hand and held on to it tight. I couldnât believe that anyone would do this to me. âStay where you are,â the doctor said. âYouâll be all right in a minute.â Blood was still coming out of my mouth and dripping into the basin the nurse was holding. âSpit it all out,â she said, âthereâs a good boy.â âYouâll be able to breathe much better through your nose after this,â the doctor said. The nurse wiped my lips and washed my face with a wet flannel. Then they\n\nP:58\n\nlifted me out of the chair and stood me on my feet. I felt a bit groggy. âWeâll get you home,â my mother said, taking my hand. Down the stairs we went and on to the street. We started walking. I said walking. No trolley-car or taxi. We walked the full half-hour journey back to my grandparentsâ house, and when we arrived at last, I can remember as clearly as anything my grandmother saying, âLet him sit down in that chair and rest for a while. After all, heâs had an operation.â Someone placed a chair for me beside my grandmotherâs armchair, and I sat down. My grandmother reached over and covered one of my hands in both of hers. âThat wonât be the last time youâll go to a doctor in your life,â she said. âAnd with a bit of luck, they wonât do you too much harm.â That was in 1924, and taking out a childâs adenoids, and often the tonsils as well, without any anaesthetic was common practice in those days. I wonder, though, what you would think if some doctor did that to you today.\n\nP:59\n\nSt Peterâs, 1925â9 (age 9â13)\n\nP:61\n\nFirst day In September 1925, when I was just nine, I set out on the first great adventure of my life â boarding-school. My mother had chosen for me a Prep School in a part of England which was as near as it could possibly be to our home in South Wales, and it was called St Peterâs. The full postal address was St Peterâs School, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Weston-super-Mare is a slightly seedy seaside resort with a vast sandy beach, a tremendous long pier, an esplanade running along the sea-front, a clutter of hotels and boarding-houses, and about ten thousand little shops selling buckets and spades and sticks of rock and ice-creams. It lies almost directly across the Bristol Channel from Cardiff, and on a clear day you can stand on the esplanade at Weston and look across the fifteen or so miles of water and see the coast of Wales lying pale and milky on the horizon. In those days the easiest way to travel from Cardiff to Weston-super-Mare was by boat. Those boats were beautiful. They were paddle-steamers, with gigantic swishing paddle-wheels on their flanks, and the wheels made the most terrific noise as they sloshed and churned through the water. On the first day of my first term I set out by taxi in the afternoon with my mother to catch the paddle-steamer from Cardiff Docks to Weston-super-Mare. Every piece of clothing I wore was brand new and had my name on it. I wore black shoes, grey woollen stockings with blue turnovers, grey flannel shorts, a grey shirt, a red tie, a grey flannel blazer with the blue school crest on the breast pocket and a grey school cap with the same crest just above the peak. Into the taxi that was taking us to the docks went my brand new trunk and my brand new tuck-box, and both had R. DAHL painted on them in black.\n\nP:62\n\nA tuck-box is a small pinewood trunk which is very strongly made, and no boy has ever gone as a boarder to an English Prep School without one. It is his own secret store-house, as secret as a ladyâs handbag, and there is an unwritten law that no other boy, no teacher, not even the Headmaster himself has the right to pry into the contents of your tuck-box. The owner has the key in his pocket and that is where it stays. At St Peterâs, the tuck-boxes were ranged shoulder to shoulder all around the four walls of the changing-room and your own tuck-box stood directly below the peg on which you hung your games clothes. A tuck- box, as the name implies, is a box in which you store your tuck. At Prep School in those days, a parcel of tuck was sent once a week by anxious mothers to their ravenous little sons, and an average tuck-box would probably contain, at almost any time, half a home-made currant cake, a packet of squashed-fly biscuits, a couple of oranges, an apple, a banana, a pot of strawberry jam or Marmite, a bar of chocolate, a bag of Liquorice Allsorts and a tin of Bassettâs lemonade powder. An English school in those days was purely a money-making business owned and operated by the Headmaster. It suited him, therefore, to give the boys as little food as possible himself and to encourage the parents in various cunning ways to feed their offspring by parcel-post from home.\n\nP:63\n\nâBy all means, my dear Mrs Dahl, do send your boy some little treats now and again,â he would say. âPerhaps a few oranges and apples once a weekâ â fruit was very expensive â âand a nice currant cake, a large currant cake perhaps because small boys have large appetites do they not, ha-ha-haâ¦ Yes, yes, as often as you like. More than once a week if you wishâ¦ Of course heâll be getting plenty of good food here, the best there is, but it never tastes quite the same as home cooking, does it? Iâm sure you wouldnât want him to be the only one who doesnât get a lovely parcel from home every week.â As well as tuck, a tuck-box would also contain all manner of treasures such as a magnet, a pocket-knife, a compass, a ball of string, a clockwork racing-car, half a dozen lead soldiers, a box of conjuring-tricks, some tiddly-winks, a Mexican jumping bean, a catapult, some foreign stamps, a couple of stink- bombs, and I remember one boy called Arkle who drilled an airhole in the lid of his tuck-box and kept a pet frog in there which he fed on slugs. So off we set, my mother and I and my trunk and my tuck-box, and we boarded the paddle-steamer and went swooshing across the Bristol Channel in a shower of spray. I liked that part of it, but I began to grow apprehensive as I disembarked on to the pier at Weston-super-Mare and watched my trunk and tuck-box being loaded into an English taxi which would drive us to St Peterâs. I had absolutely no idea what was in store for me. I had never spent a single night away from our large family before. St Peterâs was on a hill above the town. It was a long three-storeyed stone building that looked rather like a private lunatic asylum, and in front of it lay the playing-fields with their three football pitches. One-third of the building was reserved for the Headmaster and his family. The rest of it housed the boys, about one hundred and fifty of them altogether, if I remember rightly. As we got out of the taxi, I saw the whole driveway abustle with small boys and their parents and their trunks and their tuck-boxes, and a man I took to be the Headmaster was swimming around among them shaking everybody by the hand. I have already told you that all Headmasters are giants, and this one was no exception. He advanced upon my mother and shook her by the hand, then he shook me by the hand and as he did so he gave me the kind of flashing\n\nP:64\n\nThe Loony Bin! grin a shark might give to a small fish just before he gobbles it up. One of his front teeth, I noticed, was edged all the way round with gold, and his hair was slicked down with so much hair-cream that it glistened like butter. âRight,â he said to me. âOff you go and report to the Matron.â And to my mother he said briskly, âGoodbye, Mrs Dahl. I shouldnât linger if I were you. Weâll look after him.â My mother got the message. She kissed me on the cheek and said goodbye and climbed right back into the taxi. The Headmaster moved away to another group and I was left standing there beside my brand new trunk and my brand new tuck-box. I began to cry.\n\nP:65\n\nWriting home At St Peterâs, Sunday morning was letter-writing time. At nine oâclock the whole school had to go to their desks and spend one hour writing a letter home to their parents. At ten-fifteen we put on our caps and coats and formed up outside the school in a long crocodile and marched a couple of miles down into Weston- super-Mare for church, and we didnât get back until lunchtime. Church-going never became a habit with me. Letter-writing did. Here is the very first letter I wrote home from St Peterâs. From that very first Sunday at St Peterâs until the day my mother died thirty- two years later, I wrote to her once a week, sometimes more often, whenever I was away from home. I wrote to her every week from St Peterâs (I had to), and every week from my next school, Repton, and every week from Dar es Salaam in East Africa, where I went on my first job after leaving school, and then every week during the war from Kenya and Iraq and Egypt when I was flying with the RAF.\n\nP:66\n\nMy mother, for her part, kept every one of these letters, binding them carefully in neat bundles with green tape, but this was her own secret. She never told me she was doing it. In 1967, when she knew she was dying, I was in hospital in Oxford having a serious operation on my spine and I was unable to write to her. So she had a telephone specially installed beside her bed in order that she might have one last conversation with me. She didnât tell me she was dying nor did anyone else for that matter because I was in a fairly serious condition myself at the time. She simply asked me how I was and hoped I would get better soon and sent me her love. I had no idea that she would die the next day, but she knew all right and she wanted to reach out and speak to me for the last time. When I recovered and went home, I was given this vast collection of my letters, all so neatly bound with green tape, more than six hundred of them altogether, dating from 1925 to 1945, each one in its original envelope with the old stamps still on them. I am awfully lucky to have something like this to refer to in my old age. Letter-writing was a serious business at St Peterâs. It was as much a lesson in\n\nP:67\n\nspelling and punctuation as anything else because the Headmaster would patrol the classrooms all through the sessions, peering over our shoulders to read what we were writing and to point out our mistakes. But that, I am quite sure, was not the main reason for his interest. He was there to make sure that we said nothing horrid about his school. There was no way, therefore, that we could ever complain to our parents about anything during term-time. If we thought the food was lousy or if we hated a certain master or if we had been thrashed for something we did not do, we never dared to say so in our letters. In fact, we often went the other way. In order to please that dangerous Headmaster who was leaning over our shoulders and reading what we had written, we would say splendid things about the school and go on about how lovely the masters were. Mind you, the Headmaster was a clever fellow. He did not want our parents to think that those letters of ours were censored in this way, and therefore he never allowed us to correct a spelling mistake in the letter itself. If, for example, I had writtenâ¦ last Tuesday knight we had a lectureâ¦, he would say: âDonât you know how to spell night?â âY-yes, sir, k-n-i-g-h-t.â âThatâs the other kind of knight, you idiot!â\n\nP:68\n\nâWhich kind, sir? Iâ¦ I donât understand.â âThe one in shining armour! The man on horseback! How do you spell Tuesday night?â âIâ¦ Iâ¦ Iâm not quite sure, sir.â âItâs n-i-g-h-t, boy, n-i-g-h-t. Stay in and write it out for me fifty times this afternoon. No, no! Donât change it in the letter! You donât want to make it any messier than it is! It must go as you wrote it!â Thus, the unsuspecting parents received in this subtle way the impression that your letter had never been seen or censored or corrected by anyone.\n\nP:69\n\nThe Matron At St Peterâs the ground floor was all classrooms. The first floor was all dormitories. On the dormitory floor the Matron ruled supreme. This was her territory. Hers was the only voice of authority up here, and even the eleven-and twelve-year-old boys were terrified of this female ogre, for she ruled with a rod of steel. The Matron was a large fair-haired woman with a bosom. Her age was probably no more than twenty-eight but it made no difference whether she was twenty-eight or sixty-eight because to us a grown-up was a grown-up and all grown-ups were dangerous creatures at this school. Once you had climbed to the top of the stairs and set foot on the dormitory floor, you were in the Matronâs power, and the source of this power was the unseen but frightening figure of the Headmaster lurking down in the depths of his study below. At any time she liked, the Matron could send you down in your pyjamas and dressing-gown to report to this merciless giant, and whenever this happened you got caned on the spot. The Matron knew this and she relished the whole business. She could move along that corridor like lightning, and when you least expected it, her head and her bosom would come popping through the dormitory doorway. âWho threw that sponge?â the dreaded voice would call out. âIt was you, Perkins, was it not? Donât lie to me, Perkins! Donât argue with me! I know perfectly well it was you! Now you can put your dressing-gown on and go downstairs and report to the Headmaster this instant!â In slow motion and with immense reluctance, little Perkins, aged eight and a half, would get into his dressing-gown and slippers and disappear down the long corridor that led to the back stairs and the Headmasterâs private quarters. And the Matron, as we all knew, would follow after him and stand at the top of the stairs listening with a funny look on her face for the crackâ¦ crackâ¦ crack of the cane that would soon be coming up from below. To me that noise always sounded as though the Headmaster was firing a pistol at the ceiling of his study. Looking back on it now, there seems little doubt that the Matron disliked small boys very much indeed. She never smiled at us or said anything nice, and\n\nP:70\n\nwhen for example the lint stuck to the cut on your kneecap, you were not allowed to take it off yourself bit by bit so that it didnât hurt. She would always whip it off with a flourish, muttering, âDonât be such a ridiculous little baby!â On one occasion during my first term, I went down to the Matronâs room to have some iodine put on a grazed knee and I didnât know you had to knock before you entered. I opened the door and walked right in, and there she was in the centre of the Sick Room floor locked in some kind of an embrace with the Latin master, Mr Victor Corrado. They flew apart as I entered and both their faces went suddenly crimson. âHow dare you come in without knocking!â the Matron shouted. âHere I am trying to get something out of Mr Corradoâs eye and in you burst and disturb the whole delicate operation!â âIâm very sorry, Matron.â âGo away and come back in five minutes!â she cried, and I shot out of the room like a bullet. After âlights outâ the Matron would prowl the corridor like a panther trying to catch the sound of a whisper behind a dormitory door, and we soon learnt that her powers of hearing were so phenomenal that it was safer to keep quiet. Once, after lights out, a brave boy called Wragg tiptoed out of our dormitory and sprinkled castor sugar all over the linoleum floor of the corridor. When Wragg returned and told us that the corridor had been successfully sugared from one end to the other, I began shivering with excitement. I lay there in the dark in my bed waiting and waiting for the Matron to go on the prowl. Nothing happened. Perhaps, I told myself, she is in her room taking another speck of dust out of Mr Victor Corradoâs eye. Suddenly, from far down the corridor came a resounding crunch! Crunch crunch crunch went the footsteps. It sounded as though a giant was walking on loose gravel. Then we heard the high-pitched furious voice of the Matron in the distance. âWho did this?â she was shrieking. âHow dare you do this!â She went crunching along the corridor flinging open all the dormitory doors and switching on all the\n\nP:71\n\nlights. The intensity of her fury was frightening. âCome along!â she cried out, marching with crunching steps up and down the corridor. âOwn up! I want the name of the filthy little boy who put down the sugar! Own up immediately! Step forward! Confess!â âDonât own up,â we whispered to Wragg. âWe wonât give you away!â Wragg kept quiet. I didnât blame him for that. Had he owned up, it was certain his fate would have been a terrible and a bloody one. Soon the Headmaster was summoned from below. The Matron, with steam coming out of her nostrils, cried out to him for help, and now the whole school was herded into the long corridor, where we stood freezing in our pyjamas and bare feet while the culprit or culprits were ordered to step forward. Nobody stepped forward. I could see that the Headmaster was getting very angry indeed. His evening had been interrupted. Red splotches were appearing all over his face and flecks of spit were shooting out of his mouth as he talked. âVery well!â he thundered. âEvery one of you will go at once and get the key to his tuck-box! Hand the keys to Matron, who will keep them for the rest of the term! And all parcels coming from home will be confiscated from now on! I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour!â We handed in our keys and throughout the remaining six weeks of the term we went very hungry. But all through those six weeks, Arkle continued to feed his frog with slugs through the hole in the lid of his tuck-box. Using an old teapot, he also poured water in through the hole every day to keep the creature moist and happy. I admired Arkle very much for looking after his frog so well. Although he himself was famished, he refused to let his frog go hungry. Ever since then I have tried to be kind to small animals. Each dormitory had about twenty beds in it. These were smallish narrow beds ranged along the walls on either side. Down the centre of the dormitory stood the basins where you washed your hands and face and did your teeth, always with cold water which stood in large jugs on the floor. Once you had entered the dormitory, you were not allowed to leave it unless you were reporting to the Matronâs room with some sickness or injury. Under each bed there was a white chamber-pot, and before getting into bed you were expected to kneel on the floor and empty your bladder into it. All around the dormitory, just before âlights outâ, was heard the tinkle-tinkle of little boys peeing into their pots. Once you had done this and got into your bed, you were not allowed to get out of it again until next morning. There was, I believe, a lavatory somewhere along the corridor, but only an attack of acute diarrhoea would be accepted as an excuse for visiting it.\n\nP:72\n\nA journey to the upstairs lavatory automatically classed you as a diarrhoea victim, and a dose of thick white liquid would immediately be forced down your throat by the Matron. This made you constipated for a week. The first miserable homesick night at St Peterâs, when I curled up in bed and the lights were put out, I could think of nothing but our house at home and my mother and my sisters. Where were they? I asked myself. In which direction from where I was lying was Llandaff? I began to work it out and it wasnât difficult to do this because I had the Bristol Channel to help me. If I looked out of the dormitory window I could see the Channel itself, and the big city of Cardiff with Llandaff alongside it lay almost directly across the water but slightly to the north. Therefore, if I turned towards the window I would be facing home. I wriggled round in my bed and faced my home and my family. From then on, during all the time I was at St Peterâs, I never went to sleep with my back to my family. Different beds in different dormitories required the working out of new directions, but the Bristol Channel was always my guide and I was always able to draw an imaginary line from my bed to our house over in Wales. Never once did I go to sleep looking away from my family. It was a great comfort to do this. There was a boy in our dormitory during my first term called Tweedie, who one night started snoring soon after he had gone to sleep. âWhoâs that talking?â cried the Matron, bursting in. My own bed was close to the door, and I remember looking up at her from my pillow and seeing her standing there silhouetted against the light from the corridor and thinking how\n\nP:73\n\ntruly frightening she looked. I think it was her enormous bosom that scared me most of all. My eyes were riveted to it, and to me it was like a battering-ram or the bows of an icebreaker or maybe a couple of high-explosive bombs. âOwn up!â she cried. âWho was talking?â We lay there in silence. Then Tweedie, who was lying fast asleep on his back with his mouth open, gave another snore. The Matron stared at Tweedie. âSnoring is a disgusting habit,â she said. âOnly the lower classes do it. We shall have to teach him a lesson.â She didnât switch on the light, but she advanced into the room and picked up a cake of soap from the nearest basin. The bare electric bulb in the corridor illuminated the whole dormitory in a pale creamy glow. None of us dared to sit up in bed, but all eyes were on the Matron now, watching to see what she was going to do next. She always had a pair of scissors hanging by a white tape from her waist, and with this she began shaving thin slivers of soap into the palm of one hand. Then she went over to where the wretched Tweedie lay and very carefully she dropped these little soap-flakes into his open mouth. She had a whole handful of them and I thought she was never going to stop. What on earth is going to happen? I wondered. Would Tweedie choke? Would he strangle? Might his throat get blocked up completely? Was she going to kill him? The Matron stepped back a couple of paces and folded her arms across, or rather underneath, her massive chest. Nothing happened. Tweedie kept right on snoring. Then suddenly he began to gurgle and white bubbles appeared around his lips. The bubbles grew and grew until in the end his whole face seemed to be smothered in a bubbly foaming white soapy froth. It was a horrific sight. Then all at once, Tweedie gave a great cough and a splutter and he sat up very fast and began clawing at his face with his hands. âOh!â he stuttered. âOh! Oh! Oh! Oh no! Wh-wh-whatâs happening? Wh-wh-whatâs on my face? Somebody help me!â The Ma"
