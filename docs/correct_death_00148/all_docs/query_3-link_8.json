        "text": "Back in Great Missenden, museum director Steve Gardam's challenge is to cater to all this enthusiasm in a few small rooms arranged around the courtyard of what was once a coaching inn. \"Roald Dahl's reach is bigger than one little village in Buckinghamshire,\" he says. For a man whose books have sold over 200 million copies, this is not an overstatement.\n\nBut this little village is where many of Dahl's stories began, drafted and redrafted on lined yellow notepads inside the nicotine-stained writing hut in the garden of his home, Gipsy House.\n\nThe writing hut's pokey interior is now the museum's centrepiece, every sharpened pencil and spit-stained cigarette butt carefully reassembled behind a pane of glass.\n\nA little girl presses her nose up close. \"Is that his real chair?\" she asks the woman with her. It is, complete with the ragged hole Dahl cut in the upholstery to make room for his spine, which was mangled in an air crash when he was a fighter pilot in World War II.\n\nThe museum whizzes through the biographical basics: boyhood pranks involving dead mice in gobstopper jars; adventures as a young Shell Petroleum employee based in Tanzania; wartime hijinks; time as an assistant air attache (and possibly spy) for the British Embassy in Washington DC.\n\nThe focus is on fun as much as facts. This is in deference to the museum's young audience, but it's also true that facts about Dahl can be slippery.\n\nHis first published piece was a story about his wartime crash for the American weekly, the Saturday Evening Post. It ran under the headline \"Shot Down Over Libya\" and told the story of a battle-hardened pilot trying to land a plane damaged by enemy fire. In truth, Dahl had not yet seen combat and had crash-landed after losing his way.\n\n\"He never let the finer details of truth get in the way of a good story,\" says Gardam. \"He never presented himself as a journalist. He was a storyteller and he was true to that constantly.\"\n\nBut even in Dahl's most whimsical flights of fancy it's possible to see traces of reality. \"One of the things you find about Dahl,\" says Gardam, \"is that his lived experience will be there in his work really clearly.\"\n\nGreat Missenden's high street is long and straight, lined with white cottages with doors shorter than people are today. As you walk from the station, there's an ugly, angular 1970s library on the left. This was where Dahl's fictional child genius Matilda sought refuge, inhaling Dickens, Austen and Hemingway while her mother played bingo in nearby Aylesbury. The bright-red petrol pumps at number 64, now disused, inspired the garage that gave Danny's father his living in Danny, the Champion of the World. Crown House, an old, timber-framed home, was Dahl's imagined setting for the orphanage where Sophie first saw the Big Friendly Giant blowing dreams through windows in The BFG.\n\nAmong the hundreds of documents in the museum's archive is a sketch by Dahl from an early draft of Fantastic Mr Fox. It shows a long, straight high street with fox tunnels underneath leading to every shop in town.\n\n\"He doesn't actually call it Great Missenden, but what other village would he be thinking of?\" says Gardam. \"He'd pluck things he'd seen, write them down in one of his ideas books, then it might take five or six years to sidle up to it mentally, to see if it had germinated into something more interesting.\n\n\"He was good at taking tiny incidents and turning them into great ones.\"\n\nThe walk from the museum in the village centre to Gipsy House rambles through private gravel roads to a lane hedged with holly and rose bushes. A sign asks cars to slow – not that there's any traffic. These days Dahl's granddaughter Sophie lives quietly at Gipsy House with her husband Jamie Cullum and their two young daughters.\n\nAs Dahl's youngest daughter Lucy (Sophie's aunt) tells it, childhood at Gipsy House was idyllic. She remembers sipping \"witch's potion\", her father's mix of milk with green or blue food colouring, as he told bedtime stories.\n\n\"The BFG is ... one that I remember distinctly,\" she writes in an email from the US, where she works as a screenwriter. \"Every night, we would have to leave our bedroom window open, just a crack, so that the BFG could blow dreams in … Every night, without fail, a long bamboo stick came into our room and blew dreams towards my sister and myself.\"\n\nThe Dahls' rambling farmhouse, the countryside that surrounded it, and the local characters were all fodder for Dahl's imagination. His first children's book, James and the Giant Peach (1961), began in the garden of Gipsy House. \"The birds managed to eat all the cherries from our tree before we could harvest them,\" says Lucy, reciting family lore from before her birth as the youngest of Dahl's five children with his film star wife, Patricia Neal. \"He wondered what would happen if the cherry grew so fast – even overnight – that the blackbirds couldn't eat it. The cherry became a peach and there was the seed of a story … Almost every story was based on an idea from where we lived.\"\n\nMr Fox lived under a tree at the top of the Dahls' orchard. \"Dad used to tell us … to shout hello to Mr and Mrs Fox,\" says Lucy. \"We always did.\n\n\"Later, he told us that he used us as a litmus test, as to whether the story was any good.\"\n\nThere are other stories in the Dahl family history. On December 5, 1960, on a New York street, a cab hit the pram carrying Dahl's baby son, Theo, and crushed it against the side of a bus, shattering his skull and leaving him brain-damaged. Two years later, his eldest daughter, Olivia, died of measles. Then his wife suffered a stroke that left her struggling to speak and half-paralysed. Dahl took charge of Neal's rehabilitation, often pushing her to tears.\n\n\"He would tell me I was 42 per cent better than yesterday and 51 per cent better than last week,\" Neal later wrote in her autobiography, As I Am. \"God I was so sick of his percentages, his plans, his programmes, his world.\" Still, she recovered. The marriage – fragile even before the stroke – did not, though it was another 18 years before they divorced, after Dahl's 10-year affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Felicity \"Liccy\" Crosland.\n\nThere is no room for ambiguity in Dahl's stories for children. Characters are either as sweet and good as Matilda's teacher Miss Honey or as beastly as her violent principal Miss Trunchbull.\n\nGardam wonders if these extremes were a reflection of the writer's personality. \"He blew hot and cold with people,\" he says. \"If he liked you, he really liked you. If he didn't – well, he was a man of sharp contrasts.\"\n\nJust as there are stories of Dahl thundering at journalists and browbeating his editors, there are tales of his extraordinary and often discreet generosity to charities and individuals.\n\nThe darkness that runs through his stories for children – vicious parents, flesh-eating giants, rampaging rhinos – is even stronger in the short stories for adults that were his focus for most of his working life. Many have argued that this dark streak, coupled with Dahl's boisterous, anarchic humour, is what makes his stories so appealing to children.\n\nThe cemetery on the hill in Great Missenden gets a lot of visitors. One of the pilgrims here to to pay respect is Ruth, a 31-year-old teacher from London, who has been reading Dahl since she was six.\n\n\"His writing is deceptively simple, but it's also a little bit dangerous,\" she says. \"That's important. It feels dangerous, even though you're perfectly safe.\"\n\nThe two young brothers are still mucking around on the grave, but it's time for them to go. The eldest has done a drawing in a tiny notebook. He tears out the page and leaves it on the stone for Mr Dahl.\n\nStoryteller: the tall tales of Roald Dahl\n\nRoald Dahl's childhood memoir, Boy, begins with a declaration: everything in the book is true. But it isn't; some of Dahl's tall tales are just as tall as they sound. Here are some of the myths he created around his life.\n\nWhat Dahl said\n\nBoy is full of grisly descriptions of beatings from teachers and older pupils. One incident, when a friend of Dahl's is caned, is particularly violent: \"At the end of it all, a basin, a sponge and a small clean towel were produced by the headmaster, and the victim was told to wash away the blood before pulling up his trousers.\" This is particularly shocking, writes Dahl, because the headmaster in question went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury. \"Did they preach one thing and practise another, these men of God?\"\n\nWhat really happened\n\nThere is no doubt that Dahl and his fellow pupils suffered beatings, but in this instance, the writer omitted some details and muddled others. One of his school headmasters, Geoffrey Fisher, did later become Archbishop of Canterbury, but the principal who administered this particular caning was Fisher's successor, John Christie. Dahl's biographer, Donald Sturrock, believes this was a simple error. But there's more to the story. Dahl neglected to mention his friend's crime. The victim was punished for sexually abusing other students.\n\nWhat Dahl said\n\nDahl's second memoir, Going Solo, begins on a ship carrying the writer from England to Africa, where he has been posted to work for Shell. He describes with relish the eccentricities of his fellow passengers: Major Griffiths, who begins each day by galloping naked around the deck; the elderly Miss Trefusis, who refuses to touch any food with her fingers; U.N. Savory (\"I could hardly believe those initials when I first saw them\") who pretends to have dandruff to disguise his baldness under his wig.\n\nWhat really happened\n\nNone of these characters rated a mention in Dahl's letters home. Instead, he described his travelling companions to his mother as \"pretty dull\".\n\nWhat Dahl said\n\nWhen WWII broke out, Dahl was based in Tanzania. The day war was declared, he was recruited to guard the border with Mozambique and arrest any German nationals attempting to escape. In Going Solo, this incident ends violently. An aggressive German points a pistol at Dahl's chest, before being shot in the head by one of the writer's comrades.\n\nWhat really happened\n\nDahl gave a more truthful account of this incident in a letter home, a few days after it occurred. There was no violence. The Germans – all civilians – offered no resistance.\n\nWhat Dahl said\n\nIn Going Solo, Dahl follows his encounter with the Germans with another violent and unlikely tale. His servant, a Tanzanian tribesman named Mdisho, rushes into the house holding a blood-stained sword. Mdisho tells Dahl that on hearing war declared, he ran four hours to the home of a wealthy German and sliced off his head.\n\nWhat really happened\n\nIn the biography, Storyteller: The Life of Roald Dahl, Sturrock points out that this tale is a reworking of Dahl's fictional piece, The Sword. Sturrock suggests Dahl saw the story as a fable about his transition to adulthood."
