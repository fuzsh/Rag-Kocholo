        "text": "Roald Dahl tells us “the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it.” Why not play out these memorable words on a visit to the South East while uncovering the great man’s own hidden secrets?\n\nAlthough he was not born in the South East, Roald Dahl had many connections with the region, the main one being his home in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire where many of his famous novels were written.\n\nA good place to begin to discover the story of Roald Dahl is at the Roald Dahl Children’s Gallery in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.\n\nYou can ride in a Great Glass Elevator like in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, crawl through the tunnel from Fantastic Mr Fox and listen in on the world of the BFG, the Big Friendly Giant. The school reports of Roald Dahl are on show and make interesting reading. According to his teacher, he had little ability and was very childish!\n\nAlso in Great Missenden is the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre. It’s a fun place where you can learn about the life of Roald Dahl, get involved in the story-telling sessions and concoct a revolting recipe in Cafe Twit.\n\nThere’s a chance to dress up, even to decorate chocolate because, as Roald Dahl knew so well, “a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.”"
