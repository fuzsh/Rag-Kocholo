        "text": "A new unique Roald Dahl Dictionary from Oxford. This is not an ordinary dictionary. After all, you wouldn't expect an 'Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary' to be ordinary, would you? Lots of dictionaries tell you what an 'alligator' is, or how to spell 'balloon' but they won't explain the difference between a 'ringbeller' and a 'trogglehumper', or say why witches need 'gruntles' eggs' or suggest a word for the shape of a 'Knid'.\n\nThis dictionary does all those things. All the words that Roald Dahl invented are here, like 'biffsquiggled' and 'whizzpopping' to remind you what means what, but that is not all. You'll also find out where words came from, rhyming words, synonyms and lots of alternative words for words that are overused.\n\nOxford Children's Dictionaries are perfect for supporting literacy and learning and this is the world's first Roald Dahl Dictionary from the word experts at Oxford University Press. With real citations from Roald Dahl's children's books and illustrations by Quentin Blake, this is authoritative, engaging and accessible and will inspire and encourage young writers and readers.\n\nBooks and gifts - £3.50 post and packing per order, UK addresses.\n\n-£20.00 post and packing per order, Overseas addresses.\n\nArt and craft - post and packing individually priced.\n\nOrders will be shipped by second class postage. Please allow 3 - 5 days for your order to be processed.\n\nCLICK AND COLLECT - we aim to have your order ready for collection within 3 working days, but will email you to let you know when it is available to save you having a wasted journey.\n\nCollection from:\n\nWigtown Festival Company\n\n11 North Main Street\n\nWigtown\n\nDG8 9HN"
