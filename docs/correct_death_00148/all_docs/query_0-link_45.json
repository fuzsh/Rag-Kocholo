        "text": "Roald Dahl Obituary â Death: In Loving Memory of British Author, Roald Dahl\n\nRoald Dahl Obituary: Roald Dahl was a British author who wrote many popular childrenâs books, such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The BFG, and James and the Giant Peach. He also wrote short stories, novels, screenplays, and autobiographies for adults. He was one of the worldâs best-selling authors, with his books selling more than 300 million copies worldwide. He was also a fighter pilot and an intelligence officer during the Second World War. He died on November 23, 1990, at the age of 74. But what was the cause of his death?\n\nA Rare Cancer of the Blood\n\nAccording to various sources, Roald Dahl died of a rare cancer of the blood called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS is a group of disorders that affect the bone marrow and prevent it from producing enough healthy blood cells. MDS can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, infections, bleeding, and bruising. MDS can also progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a more aggressive type of blood cancer.\n\nThe exact cause of MDS is not known, but some factors that may increase the risk include exposure to radiation, chemicals, or certain drugs; smoking; older age; and genetic mutations. There is no cure for MDS, but treatments such as blood transfusions, chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and supportive care can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life.\n\nRoald Dahl was admitted to a hospital in Oxford, England, on November 12, 1990, with an undisclosed infection. He died peacefully in his sleep on November 23, 19904. He was buried in the cemetery at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a âsort of Viking funeralâ .\n\nncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h70aiYpZxdma6puIyomaKspZa%2FunnDnpitoF2eu264zq%2Bgp59dorKuu9GyZKieXZe%2FqsDIrJ9mmaWptbC%2BjKummqSUYrGitMto"
