For further information on his life and career, see CLR, Volumes 1, 7, and 41.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the most popular children's authors of the past century, Dahl has developed a fervent and loving reading audience with his series of deviously subversive novels and picture books, in which a child is routinely cast as the presumed hero and eventual victor over an antagonistic adult world. Dahl's tales for children rely heavily on fantasy and magic to offset otherwise forbidding settings, featuring remarkable heroes and heroines whom overcome their dark circumstances to emerge into lifelong happiness. Often featuring cartoonish violence and good-naturedly grotesque humor, Dahl has emerged as a divisive figure in children's literature—beloved by children, though vocally disliked by some more conservative critics, who argue that Dahl's works are too dark and anarchic for young readers. Nevertheless, nearly every one of Dahl's books remains in print, and he continues to be one of the best-selling children's authors of all time, having sold over thirty million books since the 1960s. Several of Dahl's most famous works have also been adapted as motion pictures, including James and the Giant Peach (1961), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), and Matilda (1988).\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nDahl was born in Llandaff, Wales, on September 13, 1916. His father, Harald, was Norwegian by birth and immigrated to England in 1900 after his first wife died in childbirth, leaving Harald with two daughters, Astri and Alfhild. Harald later remarried Sophie Magdalene Hasselberg, with whom he had three additional children, Roald (pronounced Roo-aal), Else, and Asta. When Dahl was three years old, his sister Astri died of appendicitis, and his father passed soon after due to pneumonia. Widowed with three children and pregnant with Asta, Sophie honored her late husband's wish that their children be educated within the English boarding school system, selling her family's jewelry to pay for tuition. At age seven, Dahl was first placed at the Llandaff Cathedral School and, from 1925 to 1929, he attended the St. James Preparatory School in Weston-Super-Mare. When he was thirteen, Dahl moved to the prestigious Repton School, where he excelled at sports. In his autobiography, Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984), Dahl stated that many of the inspirations for his later works would come from his boarding school days—a Matron at St. Peter's became the model for Mrs. Trunchbull in Matilda, and Repton's proximity to the Cadbury candy factory inspired Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Upon his graduation, Dahl's mother offered him the chance to continue his education, despite his relatively weak grades at Repton. Dahl, however, chose to join the Public Schools Exploring Society's expedition to Newfoundland. After this extended hiking excursion, Dahl began working for the Shell Oil Company as a salesman, eventually traveling to Dar es Salaam in East Africa to oversee Shell's operations in Tanzania. When he was twenty-three, World War II commenced, and Dahl joined England's Royal Air Force (RAF) in Nairobi. Dahl details his wartime exploits in the autobiography Going Solo (1986), which included crashing into the Egyptian desert and shooting down enemy aircraft over Greece. Due to his injuries sustained during combat, Dahl was eventually reassigned as an Assistant Air Attaché for the RAF in Washington, D.C. While stationed in Washington in 1942, he was interviewed by noted columnist C. S. Forester for the Saturday Evening Post. When Dahl wrote down his own account of crash-landing his aircraft in Libya, Forester submitted Dahl's story to the Post, which was published in August 1942 under the title \"Shot Down Over Libya.\" Dahl's job for the RAF required him to spend time among Washington's elite, and he soon became well known as an animated and gifted storyteller. One of his stories, \"Gremlin Lore\" (a word Dahl coined to describe the mythical fairies that were rumored to sabotage British planes), fell into the hands of Walt Disney, who commissioned the tale for a movie which was never made. Nonetheless, Dahl published the story as The Gremlins (1943) in picture book form—illustrated by Disney animators—and his writing career began in earnest.\n\nAfter the publication of The Gremlins, Dahl gained a literary agent and saw several of his short stories featured in such publications as Ladies' Home Journal, Atlantic Monthly, and Harper's. He returned to England in 1945, releasing collections of short stories and his first novel, Sometime Never: A Fable for Supermen (1948). In 1953 he married American actress Patricia Neal, with whom he would have five children. The couple eventually settled in New York City. Professionally, Dahl was becoming more well-known for his writing, penning a number of stage plays and short stories—he received the Edgar Allen Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America three times for his crime and mystery tales. Mean-while, Dahl was also developing a reputation as a noted screenwriter, authoring the scripts for the James Bond film You Only Live Twice (1967) and the children's movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968). Dahl began his illustrious children's book career with the release of James and the Giant Peach in 1961, a story based on the tales he told his daughters Olivia and Tessa at bedtime every night. However, Dahl was also faced with several personal tragedies during this period; his son Theo suffered major neurological damage after an accident, causing the Dahls to move back to England, and his oldest daughter Olivia died of measles encephalitis in 1962. Despite this series of personal crises, Dahl released Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in 1964, which he dedicated to the strengthening Theo. Over the course of his career, Dahl would publish over twenty more children's books, among them The BFG (The Big Friendly Giant) (1982), The Witches (1983), and Matilda. In 1983 Dahl and Patricia were divorced, and he was soon remarried to Felicity Crosland, a family friend. Now in his late sixties, Dahl's health began to decline, in part due to the many injuries he suffered during World War II. Afflicted with spinal problems and forced to undergo hip replacement surgery, he was in great discomfort and had difficulty moving. Despite his ailments, Dahl continued to write, releasing a pair of autobiographies, a dozen collections of short stories, and several final children's books, including the posthumous The Minpins (1991). Dahl was diagnosed with leukemia and passed away from an infection associated with the disease on November 23, 1990 in his longtime home at Great Missenden, England. In 2005 the Roald Dahl Museum was opened in Great Missenden to honor his memory while another tribute—the Roald Dahl Children's Gallery—was established in nearby Aylesbury. Further, Dahl began a charitable foundation that continues to fund research in the fields of hematology and neurology and offer grants for literacy groups.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nDahl once commented that, \"Parents and schoolteachers are the enemy. The adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful process of civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal with no manners, no moral sense at all.\" Bearing that message, Dahl's varied works come into sharper thematic focus. Dahl often saw himself as a sort of advocate for children whom understood the world as they did. In the Dahl universe, children are the oppressed, subjugated citizens of a world they don't quite understand and in which they have no discernible power. To rectify this, Dahl paints his books with a broad hand, portraying youthful heroes in abject surroundings whom triumph over circumstance. Through a liberal helping of fantastical elements, his protagonists emerge against long odds—thanks to their innate goodness and strength of will—to find that which has been missing in their lives, while administering a measure of well-deserved justice to their adult repressors. It is this latter theme that garners the bulk of the critical opposition to Dahl's works, as the author inflicts the cartoonishly violent, child's-eye vision of justice to his litany of adult figures. Dahl's first major children's book, James and the Giant Peach, recounts the fantastic tale of a young boy who travels thousands of miles in a house-sized peach with a bizarre assemblage of animal companions. After a massive peach crushes James' neglectful aunts, the boy hero crawls into the peach through a worm hole, making friends with a centipede, a silkworm, a spider, a ladybug, and a flock of seagulls that lifts the peach into the air and carries it across the ocean to Central Park. The book enjoyed a modest success in the United States when published there in 1961, but Dahl could not find a British publisher for James until 1967. Indeed, the book includes many of the elements that drew disapproval from parents, teachers, librarians, and critics of children's literature, especially in England, for years to come: child abuse, violence (including the messy demise of several adults), unspeakable practices (such as eating \"earwigs cooked in slime\"), and the apparent promulgation of the philosophy that it is a wise child who regards adults with suspicion until they have proved that they are trustworthy.\n\nIn Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Dahl's next work, all of the characters except for Charlie and his parents are grotesques, even Willy Wonka. Of the five children who win the coveted visit to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, all except Charlie come to gruesome ends, and even though Willy resurrects them at the end, Dahl's delighted readers have no way of knowing that while they read. However, Charlie also represents one of Dahl's least morally ambiguous works; nasty character traits (selfishness, greed, addiction to television, and laziness) are punished, and admirable ones (honesty and devotion to family) are rewarded. After two shorter children's books, The Magic Finger (1966) and Fantastic Mr. Fox (1970), Dahl wrote Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator (1972), a sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The second book is considerably more complex than the first. The first work had to do with seeing that Charlie got one of the five magic tickets to visit the chocolate factory and that he was the eventual winner of Willy Wonka's special prize. The sequel involves Charlie saving the Earth from invasion by the Vermicious Knids (shapeshifters from the planet Vermes, \"the most brutal, vindictive, venomous, murderous beasts in the entire universe\") and rescuing a Commuter Capsule that travels between Earth and a Space Hotel. Dahl released Danny the Champion of the World as a children's book in 1975, though the tale is actually an expansion of an earlier short story titled \"The Champion of the World\" that Dahl published some fifteen years earlier in The New Yorker and later in his prose collection Kiss Kiss (1960). The original version was definitely intended for an adult audience—there is no Danny or any other young principal in the first version—but the book, though definitely a juvenile, differs greatly from the other children's books published by the author. It is a much gentler story, featuring adults who are neither freaks nor monsters, centering on a loving relationship between father and son. The father is portrayed in a positive way, and the doctor, the policeman, and most of the townspeople are shown as characters the juvenile readers should love and respect. Only the nasty Mr. Hazell and his henchmen are depicted with the vitriol used for most adults in Dahl's other children's books.\n\nThe Enormous Crocodile (1978) brought Dahl together with illustrator Quentin Blake for the beginning of a long and successful collaboration. It is another of Dahl's scary tales that makes young readers squirm with delighted horror as the wicked reptile zeroes in on his choice of edible prey: children. Dahl partnered with Blake again for The Twits (1980), a story that features no sympathetic human characters—the only Dahl book about which that can be said—the \"heroes\" being the monkey family imprisoned by the Twits and their savior, the Roly-Poly bird. The only humans are Mr. and Mrs. Twit, people with no redeeming characteristics to offset their revolting personalities and behavior. While the protagonist of George's Marvellous Medicine (1981) is similarly nasty, the hero of The BFG is decidedly more child-friendly. As the story opens, there are ten giants in Giant Country: nine bad giants who gobble up human \"beans\" every night, and the Big Friendly Giant (BFG) who provides humans with dreams. A little girl named Sophie wakes up in the middle of the night and sees the BFG, who eventually becomes her best friend and helps Sophie enlist the Queen of England to capture the nine bad giants. The BFG is notable for Dahl's usage of made-up language—such as whiffsy, disgusterous, rotsome, and sickable—as well as puns, malapropisms, onomatopoeia, and spoonerisms to entertain young readers. In Roald Dahl's Revolting Rhymes (1982), Dahl reimagines classic fairy tales that in some respects form the literary an-tecedent to his own works. In his revision of \"Cinderella,\" the Handsome Prince travels to Cinderella's home to confront her Wicked Step-Sisters, and in a gruesome dispensation of his own crude justice, lops off their heads. Cinderella, like much of Dahl's literary canon, is given the ability to recognize reality amidst the fantasy and is horrified. Her prince is not the shining paragon of virtue she had imagined, and she asks her fairy godmother for an alternate ending where her future is not in the hands of the homicidal prince. Instead, she finds intelligent and real happiness in the form of a marmalade-maker who provides the prerequisite \"happy ever after.\"\n\nOne of Dahl's best-known works, The Witches, begins with a convention of witches held at the Bournemouth hotel where the young hero and his convalescent grandmother are staying. The lad inadvertently overhears their plan to wipe out the world's children after turning them into mice by means of \"Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker.\" The witches catch the boy and turn him into a mouse. He escapes, purloins a vial of Formula 86, pours it into their banquet soup, and turns the witches into mice. In a departure from his usual all-problem-solving finish, Dahl reveals that the hero's conversion into a mouse is irreversible but makes good use of the opportunity to inject a heartfelt moral. \"My darling, are you sure you don't mind being a mouse for the rest of your life?\" his grandmother asks. \"I don't mind at all,\" the boy replies. \"It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like so long as somebody loves you.\" The coda shows the boy and his indefatigable grandmother planning to travel the world, turning witches into mice and then exterminating them. Though several of Dahl's works were released posthumously, Matilda was one of the author's last books published during his lifetime and went on to become one of his most popular. Matilda is a precocious child with insipid parents. Matilda's first teacher, Miss Honey, only twenty-three, struggles to challenge her pupil. When she attempts to help Matilda's parents and evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, recognize the girl's gifts, she is ridiculed. Miss Honey, it turns out, is also an orphan. Trunchbull is the aunt who raised her, abused her, and, so it seems, killed her father. Trunchbull bullies Miss Honey out of her inheritance and wages, forcing Miss Honey to live in a shack and eat almost nothing. However, Matilda discovers that she is blessed with magical telekinetic powers, which she uses to restore her teacher's rightful inheritance and rid the town of the beastly Trunchbull. Matilda's parents, petty criminals, flee England on the lam, giving Miss Honey permission to adopt Matilda. Though he is best known for his children's works, Dahl has also published several adult-themed novels, short stories, and volumes of autobiographies—these memoirs, in particular, shed light on many of the specific memories and events from Dahl's childhood that became the basis for his best-selling juvenile works.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nOver his storied career, Dahl has been portrayed as both a revered storyteller of incredible talent as well as a vilified panderer whose books demonstrate a threat to children's education. The former image is demonstrated by his selection as England's favorite children's author over such luminaries as A. A. Milne and Lewis Carroll in a poll by the BBC's Bookworm program in 1997, whereas the latter image is personified by his perennial inclusion on the American Library Association's annual list of the most challenged authors. Dahl's The Witches was even included on the ALA's top ten list of most frequently censored books between the years 1982 and 1994. The rationale for such censorship runs the gamut; the most common is reflected in Stafford County, Virginia's removal of Dahl's books from its libraries for \"encouraging children to disobey their parents.\" Other primary sources of challenge have involved issues of language (his retelling of \"Cinderella\" in Revolting Rhymes uses the word \"slut\"), the presence of magic and other supernatural elements as a source of goodness, and his judicious usage of violence, vulgarity, and perceived incentive to act out in a negative way. These complaints are typified by a review of Matilda by Ann A. Flowers in which she has contended that, \"Child neglect countered by revenge, however funny and however justified, is just not a nice theme.\" Other critics have worried about Dahl's possibly unintentional negative influence on his readers. Eleanor Cameron, for example, has wondered whether, \"Dahl caters to the streak of sadism in children which they don't even realize is there because they are not fully self-aware and are not experienced enough to understand what sadism is.\" However, while Dahl's critics have been vocal and persistent, sparking controversy against him for almost the entire duration of his career, they have only represented a small voice within the larger community of children's literature. Indeed, most have cited Dahl's rebellious style as one of his greatest strengths. Lisa Hermine Makman has asserted that Dahl's \"inveterate dissatisfaction with himself and with others is echoed in the critical attitudes toward social institutions and traditional au-thorities expressed in his works. The timeliness and popularity of his writings, to an extent, depend on their irreverence and perversity.\" David Furness has agreed, writing that, \"Far more than simply entertaining his youthful audience, Dahl writes to their fierce intelligence and passion: their wish to save the world, their unhesitating belief they can.\" In designating Dahl's ultimate place in the pantheon of children's literature, Catriona Nicholson has written that, \"Dahl's ability to combine within each story his distinctive brand of humour, fantastic adventure and strong measures of adult ridicule or exposure is a winning formula. His books offer children (and many adults) a unique reading experience for through the exuberant optimism, extravagant literary devices, and the child-centered gratification of common desires, Dahl establishes a binding rapport with his readers.\"\n\nAWARDS\n\nDahl has received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including the New England Round Table of Children's Librarians Award and the Surrey School Award for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; the Surrey School Award and Nene Award for Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator; the Surrey School Award and California Young Reader Medal for Danny the Champion of the World; the Federation of Children's Book Groups Award for The BFG; the New York Times Outstanding Books Award, the Whitbread Award, and the West Australian Award for The Witches; the Boston Globe/Horn Book nonfiction honor citation for Boy: Tales of Childhood; and the Smarties Award for Esio Trot (1990), among many others. In addition, The BFG, The Twits, Matilda, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were all voted \"one of the nation's 100 best-loved novels\" by the British public as part of the BBC's The Big Read in 2003.\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\nChildren's Works\n\nThe Gremlins: From the Walt Disney Production.

Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 2004.\n\n[In the following essay, Donaldson suggests that Dahl's version of children's fantasy subverts typical stereotypes by offering a backdrop of reality in which the fantasy and magic are inserted.]\n\nLiterature of the fantastic has been claimed as \"transcending reality,\" escaping the human condition and constructing superior alternate worlds. From W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, this notion of fantasy literature as fulfilling a desire for a better, more complete, unified reality has come to dominate readings of the fantastic.\n\n(Jackson 1981: 2)\n\nRoald Dahl's literature for children lends itself particularly well to the kind of reading that Jackson suggests has become popular in readings of fantasy; he enables his readers to transcend their respective realities through the use of the fantastic mechanisms that he writes into his books. In this way, Dahl's readers may embrace, at the very least, the illusion of a unified world. Roald Dahl concentrates on the dynamic of the dysfunctional family and the child who is at the mercy of this particular societal vice. The worlds in which he places his young characters are lonely, frightening, and often operate through relationships that have cruelty at their base. Dahl does not, however, leaves his characters stranded. He injects magic into their worlds and it is inevitably through this spell weaving that Dahl binds the children into new, loving familial relationships. This is most obviously at work in the lives of the children in Matilda (1988), James and the Giant Peach (1995), The BFG (1982), and The Witches (1983).\n\nI would suggest that it is because of this—Dahl's emphasis on the reintegration of his characters into loving, normal familial setups and hence into healthy society—that he challenges Jackson's (1981) ultimate conclusion that all fantasy is merely escapist and, hence, bad. Because Dahl concentrates on the possibilities that fantasy can bring to the \"real\" world, his fantasy does not necessarily encourage escapism but rather that satisfaction of the \"desire for a better, more complete, unified reality\" (Jackson 1981: 2).\n\nThe fact that Dahl explores this particular relationship (i.e., the relationship between parent and child) is interesting for two reasons: Dahl's own family history and the psychological stage of development of his readers. Dahl is able to write with insight into the orphaned child because of the personal experience of confusion and loss that marked the history of his own family life. Rosemary Jackson writes that,\n\nLike any other text, a literary fantasy is produced within, and determined by, its social context. Though it might struggle against the limits of this context, often being articulated upon that very struggle, it cannot be understood in isolation from it. The forms taken by any fantastic text are determined by a number of forces, which intersect and interact in different ways in each individual work. Recognition of these forces involves placing authors in relation to historical, social, economic, political and sexual determinants.\n\n(Jackson 1981: 3)\n\nDahl's literary fantasies were created within the social context in which Dahl found himself having to survive; there is a very obvious intrusion of personal experiences into his writing of literature for children. Dahl's fantasy cannot be separated from the struggle that precipitated its inception; his struggle has formed the crux of his fantasy and we must, therefore, pay particular attention to that world that created both Dahl and, later, his stories.\n\nRoald Dahl was born to Harald and Sophie Dahl in 1916, a child of his father's second marriage. When he was four, his elder sister, Astri, died of pneumonia and within the space of a month, his father followed suit. Dahl describes this event in simple terms:\n\nAstri was far and away my father's favourite. He adored her and her sudden death left him literally speechless for days afterwards. He was so overwhelmed with grief that when he himself went down with pneumonia a month or so afterwards, he did not much care whether he lived or died. My father refused to fight. He was thinking, I am quite sure, of his beloved daughter and was wanting to join her in heaven. So he died.\n\n(Dahl 1984: 20)\n\nThe effect this must have had on a young Dahl is great; merely the change in the familial dynamic would have been enough to instill a fear of change in the child, as well as an acknowledgment of death and the instability of the world around him. Kristine Howard (2000), however, further suggests that Dahl suffered from feelings of parental rejection, having had his father choose to die to be with the favored child rather than considering his young son. This is a provocative statement that ties in with Dahl's young characters, who are certainly victims of rejection by their caregivers.\n\nAdded to this emotional aspect, the practical circumstances with which the Dahl family had to cope after the death of the father were not easy, and would also have had serious repercussions on Dahl's formation. Dahl writes in Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984: 21) that,\n\nMy mother had now lost a daughter and a husband all in the space of a few weeks. Heaven knows what it must have felt like to be hit with a double catastrophe like this. Here she was, a young Norwegian in a foreign land, suddenly having to face all alone the very gravest problems and responsibilities. She had five children to look after, three of her own and two by her husband's first wife, and, to make matters worse, she herself was expecting another baby in two months' time.\n\nNeedless to say, Roald Dahl, although he seems to have worshipped his mother, and she him, could not have had the attention required by a child of that age. He certainly could not have had enough to allay the fears of abandonment prevalent in children at that age, and that would have been exacerbated in Dahl's case by the early death of his father.\n\nAs well as this, circumstances at the time necessitated Dahl's being sent away to school from the age of six. He suffered terribly from homesickness. This, too, only strengthened Dahl's recognition of the instability of the family unit; we begin to see why this theme pervades most of his writing. Dahl's experiences at school did, however, introduce a new dimension to his comprehension of the unstable family unit: in the place of his loving mother, Dahl now had grotesque authoritarian figures as his primary caregivers. Howard (2002: 1) writes,\n\nA key theme in Dahl's novels is the use of violence and cruelty by authority figures on the weak. Dahl generally depicts at least one authority in each story as incredibly cruel, sadistic and bigoted. This is a direct reflection of his experiences as a child attending boarding schools in England.\n\nJulia Round (2002: 2) has also commented on this point. She writes,\n\nIt has often been observed that Dahl's authoritarian characters (are) inspired by his school days at Llandaff Cathedral School and Repton. Dahl often suffered systematic caning and fascistic discipline: one notable figure would be his headmaster at Repton, who administered \"the most vicious beatings to the boys under his care\" (Dahl 1984: 29) and yet later became Archbishop of Canterbury. Dahl saw something deeply wrong with this authority, where sheer cruelty was hidden behind a mask of Christian virtues.\n\nExamples of these cruel characters abound in Dahl's fiction: Miss Trunchbull in Matilda (1988) and Aunts Spiker and Sponge in James and the Giant Peach (1995), as well as the witches in The Witches (1983).\n\nI do not intend to pose the argument that Roald Dahl was a traumatized child. However, I do believe that his experiences as a child engendered in him an understanding of the unspoken fears of childhood: the fear of abandonment or rejection by the primary caregiver and the helpless dependency on adults for care and the satisfaction of practical needs. Jackson says that, \"Fantasy characteristically attempts to compensate for that which is experienced as absence and loss\" (Jackson 1981: 3). Dahl's fantasy does this. Dahl explores that which he himself experienced as loss and absence, and this is a lack to which many of his readers can relate.\n\nThe bulk of Dahl's readers are between the ages of 6 and 12, within the developmental stage of middle childhood; this is important to Dahl's exploration of the dysfunctional family. Dahl presents families in which the children are rejected or mistreated (James and the Giant Peach, Matilda ) or in which the parents are completely absent (The Witches, The BFG ). These situations represent the most profound fear of middle childhood: the fear of the death of a parent.\n\nThe parent plays a pivotal role during this stage of a child's development; the child now begins to enter the larger social world around him or her and, depending on the relationship with the parent, the child will approach the world in varying manners. If the parent is either abusive or absent, the child will experience extreme difficulty in social relationships and in the development of self-esteem. This invariably causes problems well into adulthood. It is thus imperative that the child has some warm, caring, and stable relationship with an adult through whom he or she is guided into the world at large.\n\nIn his writing for children, Dahl may create a situation in which the child is the victim of a pathological relationship, but he does not leave this as the ultimate destiny of any of his characters. The child is never left at the mercy of cruelty, but finds a place where he or she is loved. This is obviously gratifying for the children who read Dahl's books. Dahl's stories are also particularly seductive in this stage of childhood for another reason. Because the children in this stage recognize their dependency on the adults in their lives, and thus the ease with which they become the victims of these adults' whims, there is a desperate need to gain some control of their own worlds. This is physically impossible in the real world in which the readers live, but for Dahl's characters, there is the means by which they are able to take control of their lives. Dahl places in the paths of each of his characters some form of magic that they, as children, are able to wield successfully and thus use to improve their situations. Dahl, therefore, both manifests the fears of his young readers and enables them to resolve their fears, vicariously, through the self-willed actions of the fictional characters.\n\nThe fact that Dahl uses magic through which to empower his readers to dissolve the shadows around them is a stroke of sorcerous genius. Dahl does not create completely fantastic worlds into which his readers can escape, the likes of Wonderland or Narnia. Instead, he roots his stories very firmly in the real worlds of the middle to lower classes, which his young readers have experienced and can easily recognize. When he then introduces his quirky brand of spell weaving into this otherwise mundane setting, Dahl makes it seem all the more possible. Magic becomes a viable option in the real world in which his readers live, and this lends his optimistic message even more power. Readers can take this \"real\" magic with them and make it a part of the world with which they interact, so that life is not as ordinary as it was beforehand.\n\nAs Rosemary Jackson (1981: 1) writes, \"Fantasy is not to do with inventing another non-human world: it is not transcendental. It has to do with inverting the elements of this world, re-combining its constitutive features in new relations to produce something strange, unfamiliar and apparently new.\" Because Dahl does this, the fantasy that he creates is potent because it is seductively \"real\" and possible. Although each of the novels discussed below is unique, they do share the same exploration of the dysfunctional family and miraculous healing through magic.\n\nIn James and the Giant Peach (1995: 1), Dahl tells us that \"until he was four years old, James Henry Trotter had a happy life. He lived peacefully with his mother and father\"; this was before his parents were eaten by a marauding rhinoceros. It is interesting to note that the children in Dahl's novels are very young, much the same age as Dahl was when he lost his own father. After the loss of his parents, James finds himself alone and frightened in a vast, unfriendly world (Dahl 1995: 1). He is sent to live with replacement caregivers, his Aunts Spiker and Sponge, who commit all manner of atrocities against our small protagonist: \"right from the beginning [they beat] poor James for no reason at all\" (2) and they never called him by his real name, but always referred to him as \"you disgusting little beast\" or \"you filthy nuisance\" (2). James is given no toys, and no other children are allowed to play with him.\n\nDahl describes the deprivation that James suffers in terms of things to which young readers will be able to relate. Dahl has no qualms about likening James's new existence to that of a \"prison cell\" (1995: 8) and his emotive description of James's state of mind leaves the reader with no option but to align themselves with the sad protagonist. Dahl writes, \"as time went on, [James] became sadder and sadder, and more and more lonely, and he used to spend hours every day standing at the bottom of the garden gazing wistfully at the lovely but forbidden world\" (10-11).\n\nDahl takes care to juxtapose the worlds of Spiker and Sponge and the magic to come. His vivid descriptions of the Aunts and their actions also serve to align the readers unequivocally with James and there can be no argument that this is a dysfunctional familial setup: \"Aunt Sponge had small piggy eyes, a sunken mouth and one of those flabby white faces that looked exactly as though it had been boiled. She was like a great white soggy overboiled cabbage. Aunt Spiker was lean and tall and bony. She had a screeching voice and long wet narrow lips. And there they sat, those two ghastly hags, sipping their drinks and every now and again screaming at James to chop faster and faster\" (12). James works away as the Aunts primp and preen and he thinks about what other luckier children might be doing and \"great tears [begin] oozing out of [his] eyes and rolling down his cheeks\" (12). When his Aunts notice that James is crying, they do not offer him comfort or stop to help him; instead, they yell, \"Stop that immediately and get on with your work, you nasty little beast!\" (15). James effectively has no family; he is despised and, being young, is utterly defenseless.\n\nThere is no way to remedy this situation but to introduce magic; even those who are firm believers in the good of social workers must admit that a little magic is infinitely preferable and would be far more effective in any situation of this kind. Directly after Aunt Spiker's last nasty comment, James hides at the bottom of the garden where he encounters a strange little man. The man approaches James and offers a bag to him, \"'Take a look, my dear,' he said, opening the bag and tilting it towards James\" (17). This is the first time in the book that James is spoken to in a relatively tender tone. The magic infiltrates James's world.\n\nInside [the bag] James could see a mass of tiny green things that looked like little stones or crystals, each one about the size of a grain of rice. They were extraordinarily beautiful, and there was a strange brightness about them, a sort of luminous quality that made them glow and sparkle in the most wonderful way.\n\n(17-18)\n\nThis description already smacks of heady magic but, for those children not yet able to read the signs, Dahl tells us exactly what these strange seeds of James's new life are:\n\nCrocodile tongues! One thousand long slimy crocodile tongues boiled up in the skull of a witch for twenty days and nights with the eyeballs of a lizard! Add the fingers of a young monkey, the gizzard of a pig, the beak of a green parrot, the juice of a porcupine and three spoonfulls of sugar. Stew for a week and let the moon do the rest!\n\n(18)\n\nThe little man tells James that \"marvellous things will start to happen to [him], fabulous, unbelievable things\" and \"[he] will never be miserable again in [his] life\" (19).\n\nJames spills the crocodile tongues, which duly worm their way into the ground, into the roots of the dead peach tree in the Aunts' garden, and finally result in the phenomenal peach. James is, in the ensuing excitement, shouted at, abused, and kicked out of the house at night with no supper. In the garden, he discovers a hole in the peach and tunnels his way up into the now enormous fruit. When the Aunts discover he is missing, they are relieved because they reason that he may be missing due to an accidental death on his part. Dahl, never one to let this kind of malice go unpunished, squashes the Aunts to death when the peach falls from the tree.\n\nAlthough the evil caregivers are vanquished through the power of the magical fruit, Dahl is not merely satisfied to leave James free of them. He realizes the importance of positive familial relationships. Therefore, in the peach, James discovers new friends and a loving family composed of huge insects. Through the magic that Dahl weaves into his life, James finds a home and friends who care for him; \"James Henry Trotter, who once, if you remember, had been the saddest and loneliest little boy that you could find, now had all the friends and playmates in the world\" (156). In addition, Dahl invites his readers to join James; James has a little house (made from the huge peach pit) in Central Park and he invites those who have read his story to pop in and visit him. Dahl offers what he has given to James to his readers, a home. This is characteristic of Dahl, who brings fantasy into the real world for his readers, and once again refutes Jackson's declaration that fantasy can only lead to the alienation of the reader from the real world.\n\nUnlike James, in The BFG (1982) we encounter Sophie, a little girl who has never had parents. She lives in an orphanage and is kidnapped by the BFG: the Big Friendly Giant. The magical reconstruction of Sophie's family unit comes about because she is a child, and therefore able to believe in the BFG and the magic he wields. Dahl uses dreams as magic in this novel. Jackson (1981: 8) writes that, \"like dreams, with which they have many similarities, literary fantasies are made up of many elements combined, and are inevitably determined by the range of those constitutive elements available to the author/dreamer.\" Thus, dreams in this novel become the means through which Sophie and the BFG transform their worlds; they literally recombine the elements of different dreams in order to create a new entity and, through it, a new way of living together as a family.\n\nDahl, as the author, is also involved in this process of recombining mundane elements to create the fantasy through which he heals Sophie's world. In this story, Sophie befriends the BFG and they decide that it is their task to rid the earth of the scourge of man-eating giants who raid various countries around the world every night. The two protagonists work together and convince the Queen of England to aid them in their plight; she does and then allows Sophie and the BFG to live in a castle adjacent to Windsor Castle.\n\nThe Witches (1983) operates in much the same way as does The BFG (1982). In both of these stories, the expression of fantastic desire is predominantly one of expulsion rather than manifestation. Jackson (1981: 3-4) posits that fantasy, being the literature of desire, necessarily deals with the expression of desire. In some forms, we desire the manifestation of our longings; in James and the Giant Peach (1995), James longs for a family who will love him and this manifests in time. In other forms, we desire the expulsion of threat; in The BFG, Sophie and the BFG desire the expulsion of the threatening giants from society. The reconstruction of the family unit seems almost a by-product of the main dynamic of the novel, which is to expel the evil. The same is true of The Witches ; the main plot deals with the vanquishing of the witches of the world who seek to destroy children the world over. However, the family unit receives some interesting reconstruction along the way.\n\nIn The Witches, Dahl does not present us with a child who is deprived of a loving caregiver. Although the little boy's parents are dead—he was present when they were killed in a car accident and he tells us that \"[he] still gets shivers when [he] thinks about it\" (Dahl 1983: 13)—he has a very close relationship with his grandmother. She, however, is very old and the threat of death is real.\n\nThis book seems to be the closest to Dahl's own life in that he spins much of the anxiety and the growing up of his own younger years into it; the grandmother is very old and when she catches pneumonia, there is the panic of memory tacked onto it. In Boy, Dahl describes his own grandmother's bout of pneumonia and the echoes in The Witches are remarkable. (Perhaps it is also interesting that this particular character does not have a name of his own; he could just as easily be named Roald.) In The Witches, the boy says,\n\nThe doctor explained to me that pneumonia is not normally a dangerous illness nowadays because of penicillin, but when a person is more than eighty years old, as my grandmother was, then it is very dangerous indeed. He said he didn't even dare to move her to the hospital in her condition, so she stayed in her bedroom and I hung about outside the door while oxygen cylinders and all sorts of frightening things were taken in to her.\n\n(48)\n\nThe little boy is made vividly aware of the fact that his grandmother does not have much time left. This situation seems more reminiscent of the dysfunction with which Dahl himself had to live than those of the other families encountered in his other books.\n\nWhen the grandmother takes a holiday to recuperate, she and her grandson encounter the witches. He is able to recognize them and mask his presence through his refraining from the act of bathing, but this does not save him and he is turned into a mouse through the Grand High Witch's Delayed Action Mouse Maker. This is the magic Dahl employs in this case: \"proper\" spell weaving by real witches.\n\nThrough the convenience of his new mouse body, however, the grandson is able to dose all the witches with a potion and rid England of all her witches. The expulsion of evil occurs. However, in view of the reconstruction of a healthy family unit through magic, there is an interesting repercussion of the boy's mouse body. He is no longer in any danger of outliving his grandmother. The threat of death and loneliness in the future has been neutralized.\n\n\"How long does a mouse-person live, Grandmamma?\"\n\n\"A mouse person will almost certainly live for about three times as long as any ordinary mouse,\" my grandmother said. \"About nine years.\"\n\n\"Good!\" I cried. \"That's great! It's the best news I've ever had!\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" she asked, surprised.\n\n\"Because I would never want to live longer than you,\" I said. \"I couldn't stand being looked after by anybody else.\"\n\nThere was a short silence. She had a way of fondling me behind the ears with the tip of one finger.\n\nIt felt lovely.\n\n\"How old are you, Grandmamma?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm eighty-six,\" she said.\n\n\"Will you live another eight or nine years?\"\n\n\"I might,\" she said. \"With a bit of luck.\"\n\n\"You've got to,\" I said. \"Because by then I'll be a very old mouse and you'll be a very old grandmother and soon after that, we'll both die together.\"\n\n\"That would be perfect,\" she said.\n\n(196)\n\nIn the book Matilda (1988), a return to the dynamic of James and the Giant Peach (1995) is seen. Matilda's family is very obviously dysfunctional.\n\nOccasionally one comes across parents who show no interest at all in their children. Mr and Mrs Wormwood were two such parents. They had a son called Michael and a daughter called Matilda, and the parents looked upon Matilda in particular as nothing more than a scab. A scab is something you have to put up with until the time comes when you can pick it off and flick it away. Mr and Mrs Wormwood looked forward enormously to the time when they could pick their little daughter off and flick her away, preferably into the next country or even further than that.\n\n(Dahl 1988: 10)\n\nDahl writes Matilda into a family who dislikes her and will never be able to give her the care she desperately needs. Her father is dishonest, arrogant, and stupid and brushes his daughter aside with little thought; he constantly tells her she is stupid and insignificant, \"'You're an ignorant little twit,' the father said. His speech was never very delicate and Matilda was used to it\" (22). Matilda's mother is a useless, powdery, greasy housewife who fawns over her husband to the detriment of her children. Matilda is also the first of Dahl's characters who encounters the authoritarian figures of the English school system, in the figure of Miss Trunchbull. Matilda thus has two fronts on which she is under attack, school and home. Dahl must allow her some form of self-defense.\n\nDahl gives Matilda a potent form of magic; her intellectual capacity is so great that she finds she can wield it as a physical force. Matilda becomes adept at telekinesis. She uses this gift to trap the dishonest Miss Trunchbull, which results in the restoration of Miss Honey's home to her (Miss Honey being Matilda's first form teacher). This, in turn, means that when the Wormwoods are forced to flee the country, Miss Honey is able to offer to adopt Matilda. Her parents' reaction is: \"I'm in a hurry,\" the father said. \"I've got a plane to catch. If she wants to stay, let her stay. It's fine with me\" (239).\n\nMatilda's parents don't care whether they see her again or not. At this stage, however, Dahl has transplanted Matilda so firmly into the affections of Miss Honey that this cold rejection by Matilda's parents is sought after by the reader. Like James, Matilda finds her real home through the intervention of the extraordinary into her life.\n\nDahl uses different forms of magic in each of the pathological familial situations in which his characters find themselves; he understands the shadow world in which most children live and, because of this, he understands that the only way in which to combat shadow is to use a means as intangible as shadow to fight it. Magic in Dahl's writing can be anything from a bizarre potion cooked in the skull of a witch to the harnessing of brain power. Because he allows his readers to equate magic with powers as diverse as these, he whispers the possibility that there might be many more kinds out there waiting to be discovered by the child who looks hard enough. One has only to take the time to look under the ordinary stones to find the magic grubs wriggling, hidden in the dirt. Dahl does not try to transcend reality; he instead offers something to his readers that will enable them to cope with the alienation and rejection they may feel in the real world in which they live. Because of this, he is a master of real magic and a true friend to the children who carry his books to school, scouts, and wherever else they may be bound.\n\nBibliography\n\nDahl, R. 1982. The BFG.

West (essay date winter 1985)\n\nSOURCE: West, Mark I. \"Regression and Fragmentation of the Self in James and the Giant Peach.\" Children's Literature in Education 16, no. 4 (winter 1985): 219-25.\n\n[In the following essay, West examines how Dahl's James and the Giant Peach highlights the juvenile desire to \"regress psychologically,\" asserting that James' insect companions serve as aspects of his fragmented personality.]\n\nRoald Dahl's fantasies for children have always been popular with young readers, but they have not always been given a warm reception by the critics. Instead of winning awards, his fantasies have tended to arouse controversy. His books have been accused of being vulgar, excessively violent, and disrespectful toward adults. Recently, however, Dahl's critical standing has improved. During the 1983 World Fantasy Convention, Dahl was given the organization's annual Life Achievement Award. BFG and The Witches, his most recent fantasies, have received a number of highly favorable reviews in such mainstream periodicals as Horn Book and the New York Times Book Review.1 Dahl's fantasies have even begun to attract scholarly attention. In a recent article published in Signal, Charles Sarland suggests that many of the criticisms of Dahl's fantasies are based on superficial readings. Dahl's writing, he argues, \"is a good deal more complex than many commentators would have had us believe.\" Although Sarland focuses his article on The Twits, his argument can also be applied to Dahl's first children's book, James and the Giant Peach. A psychoanalytic interpretation of this book indicates that it is considerably more than an exciting, transatlantic adventure story.\n\nSince its original publication in 1961, James and the Giant Peach has never been out of print.2 Part of its long-standing appeal is undoubtedly its ingenious and fast-moving plot. However, one need not scratch very far beneath the surface of the story to discover another reason for its popularity among children. In an unobtrusive way, Dahl's tale deals with a common theme of children's fantasies—the urge to regress psychologically. Dahl recognizes this urge and provides children with a framework to work through their own fantasies about regression.\n\nAs Anna Freud, Melanie Klein, and others have pointed out, children often engage in regressive fantasies when faced with ego threatening problems and anxieties. Such is clearly the case with the hero of James and the Giant Peach. James is a seven-year-old orphan who lives with two cruel aunts. He feels abused, unwanted, and unloved, and he strongly dislikes his aunts. On the day that his adventure begins, he begs his aunts to permit him to stop working and take him to the seaside. They, of course, refuse, threaten to beat him, and call him a \"disgusting little worm\" (p. 7). James flees from his aunts and begins crying over his unfortunate lot in life. Recognizing that a real-life James would be likely to begin fantasizing at this point, Dahl chooses this scene to interject the first fantasy element into the story.\n\nWhile James is crying, he meets a peculiar but fatherly old man who gives James a bag full of \"thousands of little green things\" that were \"slowly stirring about and moving over each other as though they were alive\" (p. 9). When James asks what these spermlike things are, he is told that they are magic crocodile tongues. James accidentally spills the bag near a scrawny peach tree, and the crocodile tongues quickly wriggle their way into the earth. Soon after this symbolic portrayal of fertilization, the tree sprouts a magical peach.\n\nThe peach grows to enormous proportions. While this miraculous phenomenon amazes the aunts, they are oblivious to the peach's beauty. They are primarily interested in exploiting the peach in order to make \"a pile of money\" (p. 20). The aunts begin selling tickets to the curious for the privilege of seeing the awesome fruit. After their first day of business, the aunts send James out into the night to pick up the litter left by the onlookers. James is hungry, lonesome, and afraid of the night. He longs to run away to someplace safe and warm. He longs to escape his problems and start over again. He subconsciously longs, Dahl suggests, to return to the womb.\n\nDahl fulfills James's wish in a most creative way. Toward the bottom of the peach, James discovers a tunnel leading toward the fruit's center, and he promptly enters it. What follows is a scene that closely resembles a reversal of the birthing process:\n\nThe tunnel was damp and murky, and all around him was the curious bittersweet smell of fresh peach. The floor was soggy under his knees, the walls were wet and sticky, and peach juice was dripping from the ceiling. James opened his mouth and caught some of it on his tongue. It tasted delicious.\n\nHe was crawling uphill now, as though the tunnel were leading straight toward the very center of the gigantic fruit.\n\n(p. 25)\n\nUpon reaching the peach stone, James finds a door which he uses to enter the stone. Once inside he encounters a menagerie of gigantic insects. They warmly welcome James, and one of them says to him, \"You are one of us now\" (p. 28). Although there are seven insects, only four—the Ladybug, the Old-Green-Grasshopper, the Centipede, and the Earthworm—are central characters in the story. When viewed from a psychological perspective, these four bugs can be seen as separate aspects of James's own psychological makeup.\n\nThe fragmentation of the personality is actually a fairly common phenomenon during periods of regression. In the 1940s, Melanie Klein used the word \"splitting\" to describe this process. Although there is some disagreement over the definition of splitting, the word has entered the lexicon of psychologists and psychiatrists. As it is generally used, splitting occurs when an individual begins to regard various aspects of his or her personality as separate entities rather than as features of a unified whole. These divisions are usually products of introjection or projection. When introjection comes into play, the individual draws upon memories of another person, usually a parent, to create an internalized representation of that person (also known as an introject). When projection comes into play, the individual attempts to externalize certain parts of his or her personality by projecting these qualities onto another being.3 Dahl makes use of both of these mechanisms in James and the Giant Peach.\n\nThe Ladybug and the Old-Green-Grasshopper both appear to be introjects. Dahl portrays them as kindly parents. They look after James, praise him when he does well, and share their knowledge with him. Unlike the cruel aunts, they provide James with the love that he so desperately needs. Although James's original parents died when he was four, Dahl suggests that they live on, at least in James's mind, in the form of these two insects. The Centipede and the Earthworm are projections of James's id and can be seen as competing phallic symbols. The Centipede proudly proclaims himself to be a pest. He boasts, makes trouble, sings risqué songs, and indulges in wild dances. He corresponds, in some ways, to Freud's notion of Eros. The Earthworm, on the other hand, is an impotent figure. He is powerless, whining, and defeated, and he constantly criticizes the Centipede. The Earthworm can be seen as being similar to Freud's conception of Thanatos or the self-destructive instinct. Important tensions within James's psyche are played out through the antics of these adversaries.\n\nSoon after entering the peach, James and the Centipede form a close but lopsided relationship. The Centipede immediately begins ordering James about, and James attempts to obey the Centipede's every command. For example, before James and the insects retire for the night, the Centipede insists that James remove the Centipede's twenty-one pairs of boots. James, in other words, allows himself to be controlled by his id. In the morning, the Centipede continues to play a dominant role. He climbs out of the peach and chews through the stem that anchors the giant peach to the tree. Since the peach is resting on a steep slope, it starts rolling downhill.\n\nThe first objects that the peach rolls over are the cruel aunts, leaving them \"as flat and thin and lifeless as a couple of paper dolls cut out of a picture book\" (p. 40). The death of the aunts plays a pivotal role in the story, for it represents the surfacing of James's murderous feelings toward his caretakers. As soon as these feelings are unleashed, James's safe peach stone turns into a chaotic pit. While the peach tumbles down the hill, James and his companions are violently tossed about. Frightened by the turn of events, James switches his allegiance from the Centipede to the Earthworm. When the peach finally comes to rest in the Atlantic Ocean, James and the Earthworm are wrapped around each other. Through these scenes, Dahl implies that James fears his own aggressive impulses and seeks to deny these impulses by embracing the impotent Earthworm. Dahl, however, does not allow James to remain in this defeated position.\n\nOnce the peach is floating peacefully in the ocean, James begins to rebuild his personality. He breaks his bond with the Earthworm and ventures out of the peach stone. Although he remains on top of the peach, he no longer seems to need the security of the womb. James is immediately confronted with numerous problems, but he bravely and cleverly solves each one. When the insects fear that they will starve, he explains that they can eat the peach. When sharks be-gin attacking the peach, James manages to turn the peach into an airship by tying hundreds of seagulls to the stem of the peach. Each time he solves a problem, the Ladybug and the Old-Green-Grasshopper congratulate him. Their praise helps James gain a sense of self-respect that he never had while he was living with the aunts.\n\nAs James begins to take control over his life, his relationship with the Centipede starts changing. Rather than feeling threatened by the Centipede, James grows to enjoy the Centipede's jokes and sardonic songs. Dahl underscores this change in a dramatic scene that follows one of the Centipede's wild singing sprees. The Centipede gets so carried away with his singing and dancing that he falls off the peach and lands in the ocean far below. Much to the Earthworm's disappointment, James immediately sets out to rescue the Centipede. After attaching himself to a strand of string, James dives into the ocean and swims around until he finds the floundering Centipede. The other insects then hoist the two of them back up to the peach. Through this symbolic acceptance of his id, James indicates that he can cope with his inner tensions. He has learned that he need not renounce his id in order to control it.\n\nNight falls soon after the rescue of the Centipede, and James and his companions have several more adventures before the sun reappears. Throughout these adventures, James demonstrates that he is able to deal with a variety of problems. By the morning, he is ready to reenter society. He is no longer the miserable, guilt-ridden, withdrawn character that he was in the beginning of the book. He has become, instead, a cheerful and capable boy who desires the company of other children.\n\nThe book reaches its climax with James's rebirth, an event that takes place over New York City. James is drifting over the city when an airplane flies through the strings that attach the peach to the seagulls. Like a newborn infant who has been detached from the umbilical cord, James makes a sudden entrance into society. The peach plunges to earth, and James fears he will die when it hits the ground. His life is spared, though, because the peach falls on the Empire State Building and becomes impaled on the building's spire. Thus, James owes his life to a symbolic representation of sexual intercourse, just as a newborn infant's life stems from the sexual union of his or her parents.\n\nAfter his adventure, James successfully recovers from his period of regression. Although he occasionally visits with the Ladybug, the Old-Green-Grasshopper, and the Centipede, he generally succeeds in reintegrating his fragmented personality. He allows the children of New York City to eat the peach, but he does not give away the peach stone. He has it moved to Central Park where he converts it into a snug house. Although James views the stone as his permanent home, he frequently ventures out of it and willingly allows other children to enter it. Thus, he uses the stone, not as a place to withdraw from society, but as a foundation upon which to build a social life. The peach stone seems to provide him with the type of security often associated with maternal love. Because he has this security, he is able to make friends and sustain his self-confidence. In short, he learns how to cope with the demands of both his internal world and the external environment.\n\nDahl is certainly not alone in suggesting that regression can be a positive experience. Ernst Kris and Heinz Hartmann, two prominent psychological theorists, argue that the suspension of ego control can sometimes help people deal with anxieties, and Anna Freud maintains that temporary ego regressions are a normal aspect of child development. Of course, no psychologist or psychiatrist would suggest that regression is always positive. In an attempt to distinguish healthy regression from pathological forms of regression, Michael J. Miller writes that \"regression in the service of the ego … has a definite beginning and end, is completely reversible, and is a function of successful adaption to stress or change.\" James's regression meets all of these criteria, and this partially explains why many children find the story so satisfying.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

At age nine, Dahl attended school near a sweets shop whose emissions he happily sniffed. An adolescence spent in an otherwise dreary English Public School was at intervals partially redeemed by the nearby Cadbury Company. Dahl and his lucky classmates sometimes got to taste test experimental chocolates, rating them and writing out their reactions. Dahl liked to imagine himself working there, \"and suddenly I would come up with something so absolutely unbearably delicious that I would grab it in my hand and go rushing along the corridor and right into the office of the great Mr. Cadbury himself,\" who after tasting Dahl's discovery would then leap from his chair crying, \"'You got it! We'll sweep the world with this one!'\" (Boy: Tales of Childhood 148-49). Foreshadowings of Willy Wonka's factory appear even in Dahl's first major book for children, James and the Giant Peach, when the impossibly massive fruit runs over just such an establishment on its way to thrilling adventures at sea.\n\nWhen, however, Dahl eventually got around to writing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, there his fascination with everything chocolate found its fullest expression. Dahl himself traces the novel's origin to the Cadbury experience: \"I have no doubt at all that, thirty-five years later, when I was looking for a plot for my second book for children, I remembered those little cardboard boxes and the newly-invented chocolates inside them, and I began to write a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (Boy 149). But what else might have motivated him? What might account for the charisma—and menace—of Willy Wonka, or for the unhappy, almost grisly accidents that befall so many of the children, with the exception of Charlie?\n\nBefore suggesting answers to these questions, a brief summary of the book might be helpful, especially since the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, so familiar to so many parents, departs in important respects from the highly successful text that inspired it.1 Two such differences seem particularly significant: the book contains no bewilderingly lurking Slugworth figure, but it does give Charlie a father, albeit a rather feckless and irrelevant one. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a meditation on what Artaud called the \"marginality of fate,\" and on the almost providential intervention of chance. Charlie Bucket is the only child of a desperately poor family. His father works long hours screwing caps on tubes of toothpaste, until he loses his job and resorts to shoveling snow. The father's miserable wages must support not only Charlie and his mother, but also both sets of invalid grandparents. As a result, their house isn't large enough and there isn't enough money to buy proper food, forcing them to eat \"bread and margarine for breakfast, boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch, and cabbage soup for supper,\" with Sundays a special day because everyone gets a second helping. The family therefore goes \"from morning till night with a horrible empty feeling in their tummies,\" and Charlie's bones bristle beneath the skin of his face (7).\n\nStanding within sight of Charlie's home is an enormous chocolate factory—the biggest in the world, and run by the cleverest chocolate maker in the world. For half a mile in every direction, the factory scents the air with the \"heavy rich smell of melting chocolate\" (9). The family is bewitched. The factory seems both nemesis and temptation, a symbol of everything dreaded and desired. Grandpa Joe spends many an evening telling Charlie about the factory: How its founder Willy Wonka—always described in superlatives—invented ice cream that doesn't run in the sun, and gum that never loses its taste. How the building—bricks, cement, and all—was constructed of light and dark chocolate. How nobody ever seemed to go in and nobody ever seemed to go out, and how the workers, known only by the shadows appearing in the windows at night, are no taller than Grandpa Joe's knee.\n\nOne day, Charlie's wish to go inside this most edible of factories becomes at least remotely possible. Inexplicably Wonka decides to admit five children for a visit. These lucky five will be selected by Fate: Wonka has hidden golden tickets inside the wrappings of five ordinary bars of chocolate. For Charlie there isn't much hope, since he gets just one bar a year, for his birthday, and so the family contents itself with following the drama in the papers. Four slightly despicable children find tickets, the wrapping for Charlie's birthday bar reveals no gold, and the family continues to starve. But one day, Charlie discovers a dollar in the gutter, and buys two chocolate bars from a fat shopkeeper. The first bar he eats. The second, a Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, explodes in a brilliant flash of gold. In an instant, Charlie is lucky ticket holder number five, and feels a \"peculiar floating sensation coming over him … his heart thumping away loudly somewhere in his throat\" (51).\n\nThe big day arrives. While the other four children bring both their mothers and fathers to the factory, Charlie brings Grandpa Joe. Even more spectacular than imagined, the factory doesn't disappoint, and neither does Wonka, a kind of troll-like figure with mixed motives. \"Please don't wander off by yourselves,\" he says, \"I shouldn't like to lose any of you at this stage of the proceedings!\" (64). But children do get \"lost.\" Gluttonous Augustus Gloop falls into a chocolate river. Violet Beauregarde eats gum she shouldn't and swells up like a blueberry. Identified as a \"bad nut,\" spoiled Veruca Salt is taken away by squirrels to the garbage chute. Mike Teavee, whose name reveals his vice, is reduced to a tiny video image. Only Charlie escapes doom, thus winning what has been a survival contest all along, for as Wonka explains, \"I decided to invite children to the factory, and the one I liked best at the end of the day would be the winner.\" He stresses: \"I have to have a child. I want a good sensible loving child, one to whom I can tell all my most precious candy-making secrets—while I am still alive.\" Charlie thus becomes heir to the chocolate factory, and Wonka invites his whole family to move in at once. The grandparents refuse at first, but Charlie and Wonka won't take no for an answer. \"Please don't be frightened,\" Charlie says. \"It's quite safe. And we're going to the most wonderful place in the world!\" (161).\n\nThe book reads like a morality fable: Charlie, the good child, wins the prize just by being himself, while the bad children meet with terrible ends. Their \"accidents\" hardly seem \"accidental,\" however, as Fate functions like an externalized superego, meting out appropriate punishments. Even when the bad kids do reemerge in the end, they carry with them enduring stigmata. Though dejuiced, Violet is still purple in the face, while shrunken Mike Teavee is restored but overstretched, \"ten feet tall and thin as a wire.\" On closer examination, however, the text seems far less straightforward. What has Charlie really won? Only the factory, or something more as well? And what about the accident theme? Why does Dahl permanently mark the undeserving children rather than simply humiliating them or condemning their vices in some other way? Finally, the factory's claustral architecture deserves special attention, too. Throughout the book, visitors struggle and shove their way through various tubes, corridors, enclosures, and passageways—the word \"push\" alone is used three different times between pages 64 and 68. In what follows, I try to answer these questions by examining not only Dahl's life history, but his extra-literary pre-occupations at the time he wrote the book.\n\nWhat Does Charlie Win?\n\nWe know full well what Charlie wins: the chocolate factory and everything else that goes with it, including presumably fame and fortune, and comfort for his dirt-poor, starving family. But even a cursory look at the life of Roald Dahl suggests that Charlie's gain may be more than just material.\n\nNeither in Dahl's life nor his work did expressing sincere, honest emotion come easy. Since his readers are far more accustomed to sarcasm or nonsense, when such emotional expressions appear in his fiction, they come as something of a surprise, and may even represent what Irving Alexander has called \"indicators of saliency\"—textual markers indicative of psychologically important material. To take an obvious incident, in Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the Chocolate Factory 's far less satisfying se-quel, the Bucket family finds itself ascending in Wonka's elevator/spacecraft. Charlie's grandparents aren't sure they like the idea, or Wonka himself for that matter. But Charlie leans over and whispers, \"Please, don't spoil everything. Mr. Wonka is a fantastic man. He's my friend. I love him\" (4). The last three words are startling in context. Though Wonka had warmed to Charlie towards the end of the first book, his affection was qualified by his overriding desire for an heir. And yet, while the unexpected \"I love him\" may not quite fit given what we know about Charlie and Wonka, the depth of devotion still rings true: in Wonka, Dahl—as well as Charlie—finds a father.\n\nHarald Dahl died of pneumonia when Roald was three, just two months after the death by appendicitis of Roald's seven-year old sister, Astri. Harald refused to fight the illness. Apparently wishing to join Astri in heaven, he \"did not care much whether he lived or died.\" \"So he died,\" Dahl concludes somewhat tersely, \"He was fifty-seven years old\" (Boy 20). It's hard not to be struck by the incompleteness of this account, which appears in the first volume of Dahl's autobiography. After spending just two paragraphs on this most catastrophic of events, Dahl moves matter-of-factly on, at greater length, to lighter fare. Since Dahl \"had always found it impossible to talk to anyone about his feelings,\" and during difficult times tended to say \"nothing of what he was going through\" (Treglown 147), it should not be surprising that Boy avoids discussing the psychological effects—short- and long-term—of Harald's and Astri's deaths. But those effects may appear elsewhere, and although he is not inclined towards psychobiography, Dahl's biographer Jeremy Treglown does speak of Dahl's search for \"surrogate fathers,\" including Charles Marsh, a self-made multimillionaire oil tycoon and art collector (6).\n\nTreglown, however, sees not Harald, but Roald Dahl in Wonka, citing both a similarity \"between Dahl's third-person narrative voice and Mr. Wonka's own hectic, exaggerated way of talking,\" and Wonka's Dahl-like way with dismissive criticism (155). Roald Dahl certainly dreamed of being an inventor—and in fact was one, as I will discuss. He also \"longed to be powerful enough to be able to conquer illness\" (Treglown 136), and in Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator actually has Wonka bring Charlie's grandparents back from the dead, a feat which Dahl himself might have envied, given the many losses he endured. And yet, though Wonka does resemble Roald Dahl to a degree, Treglown labels such an identification \"naive,\" and if we look beyond the superficial characteristics mentioned, a different, more compelling role for Wonka begins to suggest itself: fictional father.\n\nThough Charlie's actual father appears in both books, he is very nearly irrelevant (the film version drops the character altogether, at no expense to the story). In the Chocolate Factory he opens his mouth only to read verbatim newspaper descriptions of each new lucky winner.2 When Charlie finds the money and later wins the golden ticket, he tells his mother, not his father. And although all the other ticket winners arrive on the big day accompanied by both parents, Charlie's father, unemployed and unable to support the family, agrees that Grandpa Joe is more \"deserving.\" Considering how Joe nightly regaled Charlie with stories of Wonka's factory, he doubtlessly does deserve the honor, but the absence of parents not only makes Charlie out to be something of an orphan, it also seems to mark him as parentless in a metaphoric sense. Wonka therefore responds to Charlie differently, not only because he is the one good kid, but because he lacks—figuratively—a father, and because Wonka's \"real purpose is to find an heir,\" or son (Treglown 151). Wonka in fact really can't give the factory to any of the other children, since to do so would presumably make their very present parents the beneficiaries. While relishing the failures and humiliations of the other children and their escorts, then, Wonka treats Charlie with what seems like paternal concern. As they float along the same chocolate river that took Augustus Gloop, for example, Wonka dips a large mug into it and passes it to Charlie. \"Drink this,\" Wonka commands, \"It'll do you good! You look starved to death!… Hasn't there been anything to eat in your house lately?\" (88). This may be Wonka's single expression of unironic kindness and thoughtfulness in the entire book, and Charlie's deeply satisfying response marks the moment as especially important psychologically: \"as the rich warm creamy chocolate ran down his throat and into his empty tummy, his whole body from head to toe began to tingle with pleasure, and a feeling of intense happiness spread over him\" (89).\n\nWhen Charlie alone survives the war of attrition, Wonka, who \"had a hunch, right from the beginning\" that Charlie would win, is ecstatic: \"I'm absolutely delighted! It couldn't be better! How wonderful this is!\" (149). For as Wonka goes on to explain, the real contest was to secure his affection: \"I'm an old man. I'm much older than you think. I can't go on forever. I've got no children of my own, no family at all…. I decided to invite five children to the factory, and the one I liked best at the end of the day would be the winner\" (157). Notice how this cancels the conceit of \"chance.\" Wonka chose Charlie (most likely from the very start), and the \"accidents\" weren't accidents at all, but disqualifications of those children Wonka did not like. The convenient result is that when Wonka picks an \"orphan\" heir to become the child he needs, Charlie finds a fabulous father—and so too perhaps does Dahl.3\n\nBut there's more. Immediately after Charlie learns what he's won, Wonka takes Charlie and Grandpa Joe into the great glass elevator, which rises, shudderingly, through a thin corridor, then explodes like a rocket through the factory's glass ceiling. \"We're through! We're out!\" shouts Wonka. The craft hangs in midair, sunshine pours in, and the town lies spread out below like a picture postcard. Intentional or not, the implications seem unmistakable. Just after being introduced to the kind of father he needs, Charlie is reborn, at least psychologically. He finds himself transported into a different realm, with a different perspective, bathed in light. One half-expects Charlie to be slapped on the bottom.\n\nThis interpretation isn't necessarily at odds with Treglown's suggestion that Wonka is Dahl, since Dahl's ideal self—inventor, orchestrator of chance, master of life and death, imp extraordinaire—could coexist with this wonderfully amusing, occasionally even maternal, father image. Above all, Wonka's ability to resurrect the dead, which we learn about in the second book, certainly represents a wish that the loss-plagued Dahl would find compelling. Conjuring up a character who, Orpheus-like, enters the underworld and zaps the unliving back to their original form seems like the best sort of wish-fulfillment. Such speculations, however, remain rather general. Linking Dahl himself to the fortunes of his characters requires a closer look at specific events, since Dahl's life course was directly impacted by a remarkable accumulation of accidents.\n\nThe Fiction of Accident\n\nRoald Dahl's life was so accident-beset that the back cover of the paperback edition of the Treglown biography refers to a surfeit of \"shocking personal tragedy.\" As if to underscore the importance of the theme, Dahl's own account of his life begins with an accident that occurred even before he was born. At the age of fourteen, his father Harald fell off a roof, broke his left arm, and then lost that arm, thanks to medical incompetence. When Dahl himself was nine, his older sister took the family on a car ride which proved to be much more eventful than anyone had anticipated: she crashed the car into a hedge, causing Dahl's nose to be \"cut almost clean off my face … hanging on only by a single thread of skin\" (Boy 103). As a young RAF fighter pilot, in the fall of 1939 Dahl made a forced landing in the North African desert. When the plane struck a boulder, Dahl's skull was fractured, and his nose, having already been singled out for punishment, was driven back into his face. Crawling from the cockpit, he rolled out of danger, and was \"picked up, bleeding profusely, by British soldiers patrolling nearby\" (Treglown 43). And in perhaps the most significant disaster of all, his four-month-old son Theo—\"to whom Dahl was unambiguously devoted\"—was hit by a cab as his nanny pushed his carriage across a street. The child's skull was broken in several places. Doctors did not expect him to live, and though he did, it was with lasting neurological impairments (Treglown 137-38). This accident occurred while Dahl was working on the first Charlie book; in fact, Dahl dedicates it to Theo.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, accidents recur in Dahl's fiction. On the very first page of James and the Giant Peach (1961), Dahl's first major work, James's parents get eaten, rather randomly, by a rhino. The first sentence of Danny the Champion of the World (1975) informs us that Danny's mother died when he was only four months old, and in The Witches (1983), the little hero's parents die in an icy, Christmas-time car crash. Although an entire essay might be devoted to the accident as leitmotif in Dahl's work, I would like to focus here on what has to be his most accident-perfused book of all, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Why do accidents figure so prominently in this story, and what psychological function might they serve?\n\nFirst, there's the matter of the children's mock gruesome \"disappearances.\" That particular plot detail caused immediate controversy. Dahl's editor at Knopf, Virginia Fowler, had her doubts, calling Veruca Salt's disposal down a garbage shaft especially \"crude\" and \"revolting\"—too much on the \"adult level\" (Treglown 154). But the children's departures are not merely gratuitous or unnecessary in context, because Dahl seems, among other things, to be writing a cautionary tale. These children are done in by their own vileness. Their respective fates are not only metaphorically apt, but also display Dahl's moral tendency to increase discomfort as a means for disarming and provoking his young readers. Augustus Gloop \"drowns\" in chocolate, Mike Teavee becomes a TV image, and so on. But something more oblique, and undeniably more menacing, is also at work. For apart from whatever social comment Dahl may have intended, the book's tone at times betrays a kind of pervading menace. As Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka in the film version makes clear, something like vengeance lurks behind Wonka's pleasure over each demise. Repeatedly Wilder/Wonka stands by indifferently while each child exits in a way that would have been easily preventable. Although most readers I think would agree that these episodes are among the most entertaining and distinctive in Dahl's book, why are the children, rather than their parents punished? Why does Wonka/Dahl seem so determined to make the children pay, and so excessively, for their moral failings? What did he get out of it?\n\nOne answer lies in Dahl's history of loss. He had been forced to watch good children meet with undeserved catastrophe—his sister, dead at age seven; his infant son, suffering brain damage.4 If as Treglown suggests, Dahl did in fact identify with Wonka, then the candy maker's orchestration of \"death\" in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and his utter mastery over it in Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator allow Dahl vicariously to turn the tables on loss—to dictate its caprice, rather than be dictated to by it. Dahl's heroes admittedly do lose their parents, thus returning him to the site of his own grief surrounding the loss of his father Harald. But when Roald Dahl actively discards characters, as in the Chocolate Factory, he becomes judge and executioner within a created alternate reality in which only bad kids meet with disaster and good kids, who have done nothing wrong, triumph.\n\nBut in such a world, Dahl clearly identifies not only with Wonka but with Charlie as well, that boy who \"desperately wanted something more filling and satisfying\" out of life, who longed \"more than anything else\" for chocolate—chocolate signifying Wonka/Father. Functioning as both Wonka and Charlie grants Dahl an even headier power, the power to create a just world conforming to his will, and naturally he defines the world he prefers, a world in which he, not dumb reality, decides which children triumph, and which meet with bad ends.\n\nAnd so the departures of Augustus Gloop and his ilk—so gruesome, so bizarre, so easily preventable—thereby provide an outlet for Dahl's anger, resentment, and sense of injustice in response to the various losses he had endured. A man who did not talk directly about his feelings thus could express them through the harsh and unusual punishments he metes out to his characters. Because Augustus Gloop is a \"repulsive boy,\" and his mother a \"revolting woman,\" he is doomed. Veruca Salt is \"even worse than the fat boy,\" and in need of \"a real good spanking.\" The \"despicable\" and \"beastly\" Violet gets what she deserves, and if Mike Teavee can't be stretched back to his original size, Dahl simply notes, \"It serves him right.\" Such nasty children merit no mercy, and in Wonka's world, they get their just desserts, of the poetic sort he decrees. When loss arrives in reality, survivors are left no option but to wonder why. Why that person, why not someone else, someone more deserving of death? As an artist, Dahl creates a world in which such questions do not arise.\n\nThe battle for Roald Dahl then is not over the elimination of horrible accidents or unforeseen disasters, but rather over who gets to control them. The most detailed account of this struggle appears in The Witches, in which five children—including a \"Harald\"—also disappear or get transformed, but in this case at the hands of nefarious local witches. These powerful creatures despise children, and particularly enjoy turning kids into creatures all grownups hate and therefore destroy—a slug gets smashed, a flea gets powdered, a pheasant gets shot from the sky, plucked and roasted, and eaten for supper. In fact, the witches take special delight in making grownups eat their own offspring—by turning them into hot dogs. The ultimate plan is to change all the children of England into mice by tricking them into eating chocolate laced with a special formula, the \"Delayed-Action Mouse-Maker.\" The witches' strategy for transforming the children actually resembles Willy Wonka's scheme. After opening sweets shops from which to dispense the doctored candies, on a certain day the witches will announce in their shop windows a \"Great Gala Opening with free sweets and chocs to every child\" (78).\n\nThe orphaned hero and his cigar-smoking, witch-savvy grandmother get wind of the plan, and work to undermine it. The grandmother is an especially interesting hybrid of Willy Wonka and Harald Dahl. Like Wonka, Grandmother thumps around the house with a \"gold-topped cane\" (46).5 Her eyes, as \"bright as two stars\" (123), resemble Wonka's \"marvelously bright\" eyes \"sparkling and twinkling at you all the time\" (Chocolate Factory 61). But Grandmother also goes through life with a missing thumb, much as Harald Dahl did without his left arm, and while Grandmother only comes down with pneumonia, Harald Dahl died from it. Harald, Wonka, and Grand-mother thus seem to spring from shared and deep roots, and their distribution over many years suggests that Dahl continually reworked the same material, consciously or not, in an attempt to make metaphorical sense of it.\n\nEqually present in The Witches is Dahl's preoccupation with horrific accidents and the trauma they induce in survivors. In the book's most poignant passage (which Dahl sets off with italics), the hero, transformed into a mouse, meditates on his own lack of despair over the change. \"What's so wonderful about being a little boy anyway?\" he asks, \"I know that mice get hunted and they sometimes get poisoned or caught in traps. But little boys sometimes get killed, too. Little boys can be run over by motorcars or they can die of some awful illness\" (112). As already noted, even a short list of unfortunate ends contains the injury and/or death of Dahl's son, daughter, sister, and father. In another paper, I have discussed what I called the \"Orpheus Complex,\" a personality dynamic in which writers stricken by loss also eventually respond to that loss with the creation of literature. In at least one detail Dahl conforms to that prototype, for he too \"rewrote\" trauma in attempting to discharge lingering grief and to repair fate's damage. Charlie 's controlled \"accidents\" no doubt made for a much more habitable world, however imaginary it may have been. In a review of The Witches, Erica Jong insightfully describes the book as \"a parable about the fear of death as separation and a child's mourning for the loss of his parents,\" and goes on to note the book's psychologically beneficial effect: \"It's a curious sort of tale but an honest one, which deals with matters of crucial importance to children: smallness, the existence of evil in the world….\"\n\nAs we have seen, these \"matters\" were also crucially important to Dahl himself. To borrow the language of script theorist Silvan Tomkins, the unforeseen trauma motif found in Dahl's writing may be one of his \"nuclear\" scripts, expressing his \"unwillingness to renounce or mourn,\" an \"inability to recover what has become lost,\" and a disinclination to purify or integrate what had grown intolerably conflicted (197). According to Tomkins's system, we are all self-dramatizers engaged from the earliest weeks of life in a constant dramaturgical process of constructing personal worlds. Certain salient \"happenings\" get repeatedly edited into one or more core scripts. Apparently few in number and especially complex, these nuclear scripts emerge in the following way: something good turns bad, and negative affects predominate. When the individual tries to reverse, rehearse, avoid, undo, or repair the damage, a process of psychological magnification ensues, in which affect-laden scenes become interconnected as the person half-consciously perceives similarities between seemingly different experiences. The constellating power of the script makes it \"nuclear\"; it persists as a potent, vexingly recurrent problem, one not only repeatedly expressed, but also growing in scope and form, proliferating much like a cancer metastasizes.6\n\nAccording to Rae Carlson—who has championed script theory perhaps more than any other practicing personologist—to be afflicted with a nuclear script is to be driven by a \"demanding psychic agenda.\" In thrall to problems that can't be solved or let alone, in pursuit of the \"ideal\" scene, such people resort to \"celebrating experiences in memory and imagination, fantasizing punishment of the oppressor, escaping their own sense of punishment, and imagining perfect endings\" (\"Personology\" 5).\n\nFor Dahl, the losses of his sister and father could be originating events. Something good—an intact family—had suddenly turned bad, and as an adult writer of fiction, Dahl recurrently scripted and organized the damage via imaginative retellings. Just as he did, his heroes grapple with loss, managing in variously idealized ways to triumph, either by finding substitute parents more potent than the original ones, or by becoming the architects of their own fate. In the process, Dahl exacts revenge upon imagined oppressors, and in so doing concocts relatively perfect endings. But in addition to tending toward over-generalization, nuclear scripts also afflict their author, envelop him, and demand his constant attention. Much like Freud's war veteran, dreaming ceaselessly of the same bloody battle, Dahl repeatedly turns to the same theme of loss and its repercussions, underscoring the \"nuclear\" nature of each of these efforts.\n\nClaustra\n\nOf course, the form of return most liable to end the repetition once and for all would be a return to a time before birth, before emergence into narrative, and Dahl's universe is certainly filled with spaces which personologist Henry Murray has called \"claustral\"—enclosed, womb-resembling. To take only one of the more extreme examples, in the early James and the Giant Peach, the orphaned hero crawls into a hole in the side of the fruit, which upon further explanation proves to be a \"damp and murky\" tunnel: \"and all around him there was the curious bittersweet smell of fresh peach…. The walls were wet and sticky, and the peach juice was dripping from the ceiling\" (25). In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, references to tunnels, corridors, valves, tubes, pipes, and the like, through which the characters continuously get pushed and pulled, are so plentiful that it seems more economical to represent them through a summary rather than a catalog. Though crowds at the gate push to get in, Wonka ushers only the children through, promising that \"it's nice and warm inside\" (64). The first of many corridors is \"so wide that a car could easily have been driven along it.\" Its walls are \"pale pink,\" the lighting \"soft and pleasant\" (65). \"How lovely and warm,\" whispers Charlie. All the passages slope downward, deep beneath the surface, leading to rooms larger than football fields. As Wonka explains, \"underneath the ground, I've got all the space I want. There's no limit—so long as I hollow it out\" (67).\n\nThe group hustles and bustles along towards the \"nerve center,\" accompanied by a great deal of pushing and shoving. \"Enormous pipes\" dangle down from the center's ceiling, draining into the chocolate river. Here Augustus gets stuck in a pipe, and while his father wonders \"how that pipe is big enough for him to go through it,\" the people \"could see the chocolate swishing around the boy, and they could see it building up behind him in a solid mass, pushing against the blockage.\" The terrific pressure meant that \"something had to give,\" and in this case \"that something was Augustus\" (80). Or as Wonka drolly explains: \"Augustus has gone on a little journey, that's all. A most interesting little journey\" (80).\n\nThe group boards a boat made of glistening pink glass, and sails to \"some kind of dark tunnel,\" which turns out to be a \"gigantic pipe.\" After \"rocketing along at a furious pace,\" the group disembarks at the \"Inventing Room,\" where Wonka's ideas are born. Pipes run all over the ceiling and walls. Wonka proudly introduces the gum machine, which rumbles and steams and shakes most frighteningly, then emits \"a monstrous mighty groan, and at the same moment a tiny drawer popped out of the side of the machine, and in the drawer there lay something so small and thin and gray that everyone thought it must be a mistake\" (98-99). Exit Violet Beauregarde. Shortly thereafter, Veruca Salt disappears down a garbage chute. \"Endless pink corridors\" follow (110), the claustral imagery building up until the great glass elevator—with its button reading UP AND OUT—sig"
