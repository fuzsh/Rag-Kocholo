        "text": "Earlier this summer, Rev. Mother Dolores Hart, Prioress of the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Connecticut reminisced about Patricia Neal, one of the twentieth century’s most gifted actresses of stage and screen, big and small. Mother Dolores was speaking at the Catholic Information Center in Washington, DC on the occasion of her newly published book, The Ear of the Heart: An Actress’ Journey from Hollywood to Holy Vows.\n\n“She was the best friend I ever had,” Mother Dolores said, with a hint of that unforgettable Neal intonation. Patricia had come to the Abbey at the suggestion of Maria Cooper Janis, daughter of Gary Cooper and long-time friend of Dolores Hart.\n\nThree years ago today, this “amazing” woman, as Mother Dolores warmly remembers her, went to her reward.\n\nHer life has been compared to a “Greek tragedy.” While winning accolades for her acting prowess including a Best Actress Oscar, a Tony, three Emmy nominations, and savoring her greatest joy—that of mothering six children—she endured long periods of intense personal pain. But, through it all, she secured her greatest achievement: a surpassing quality of love, guided by the healing salve of forgiveness and the spiritual richness of the Catholic Faith.\n\n********\n\nPatricia Neal—christened “Patsy Louise”—was born on January 20, 1926 in the small town of Packard, Kentucky, a close-knit community in the heart of coal country, where neighbor looked after neighbor and life’s pleasures were simple.\n\n“Life in Packard,” she wrote in her celebrated 1988 autobiography As I Am, “was very good.” The hub of activity was the church—“of course, Baptist”—and general store.\n\nHer larger-than-life father William Burdette “Coot” Neal was from southern Virginia, where his family owned a tobacco plantation near Danville; and her earnest, warm-hearted mother, Eura Mildred Petrey, was from Packard, where her father, “Pappy,” was the town doctor.\n\n“Remember what the psalmist says,” Pappy would remind her. ‘He changes desert into pools of water.’”\n\nThe female preacher at Magnolia Avenue Methodist Church made an indelible impression on young Patsy during a revival meeting. “God is not keeping score… God is love,” she said, draped in a long flowing white gown. “I had never been talked to about God like that,” Patricia wrote.\n\nShe exhibited her flair for the dramatic early on, recalling her “first public performance” during an afternoon baseball game after studying Julius Caesar in the morning. Up at bat, her sister NiNi pitched the ball, hitting her and causing her nose to gush blood, whereupon she fell down, declaring Julius Caesar-like, “I am dead. I am dead.”\n\nAt age 11, she told TCM host Robert Osbourne in a 2004 “Private Screenings” interview, “I saw a glorious lady giving monologues and that’s all I wanted to do…” Now living in Knoxville, Tennessee, her father’s boss’ daughter, back from New York, was giving drama lessons. Her parents signed her up that Christmas. It was 1937. “My monologues,” she wrote, “graduated from the front yard to Aunt Maude’s drawing room, and my audiences were growing. I got great notices the first play I did, so I knew I wanted to be an actress.”\n\nDuring her first year at Northwestern University, her “daddy”—“the rock upon which anything good about me has been built”—died of a heart attack. Though eager to get to New York, she studied another year at Northwestern, at her family’s request, where drama teacher Alvina Krause was starting a summer theater and brought her along. From there she headed for New York, where she quickly landed an understudy role in The Voice of the Turtle and, along with it, her new name—“Patricia,” which the producer Alfred de Liagre thought matched her regal manner.\n\n“Applause,” she wrote, “was love. It was approval by everybody. And I bathed in it.”\n\nShe also wanted the real thing. In New York, at age 19, when her first “boyfriend,” the son of an abortionist, told her he loved her more than anyone else, she traded in her virginity for “love.” When he dumped her for his virginal high school sweetheart, she was deeply wounded.\n\nTrusting her well-formed, sensitive theatrical instincts, she soon made her artistic mark, landing a starring role in Another Part of the Forest (1946) by Lillian Hellman, for which she won a Tony in the first such awards ceremony. At the same time, hardened in “love,” she pursued romance without conscience and wrecked two marriages.\n\nAs the film offers started pouring in, she landed a contract with Warner Brothers and the starring role in John Loves Mary (1949) opposite Ronald Reagan, whom she met on New Year’s Eve, 1947, when she first arrived in Hollywood.\n\nA year later, director King Vidor introduced her to Gary Cooper, when she was testing for The Fountainhead (1949) and, after filming wrapped, she began a legendary affair with her married co-star.\n\n“When the young doctor took my virginity and made me a bad woman,” she wrote, “I made up my mind I would never get hurt like that again… Gary touched my heart as no one else had done before. I was really in love, and it was like I was innocent again.”\n\nPredictably, the affair brought turmoil to everyone involved. After Patricia aborted the child she conceived with Coop, “she never had a day’s peace thinking about that,” said Mother Dolores. “Why she did not have that child, why she was so stupid not to keep that child.” She also had a nervous breakdown after the affair came to an end, as it had to, by Christmas 1951. The Cooper family, too, suffered the strain of a temporary separation—Maria, as a child, famously spitting on Patricia in public, as Stephen Michael Shearer reported in Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life. “Gary adored her,” Pat wrote. And, “he loved Rocky,” she told Osbourne.\n\nEven after the affair was long over the bitterness lingered. In 1959—shortly after Patricia had seen Coop for the last time in London while he was filming The Wreck of the Mary Deare—Maria glowered at her from afar during a chance encounter in New York, evidencing how raw the wound still was.\n\nAfter Warner Bros. failed to renew her contract, she made the classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) for Fox; but that was not enough to salvage her career, tarnished by the affair. So, in 1951, she left Hollywood—its “disappointments and heartaches”—and returned to New York and the stage she loved so much, this time starring in Lillian Hellman’s The Children’s Hour.\n\nAs fate would have it, she soon met and fell in love with renowned writer, later of children’s books, Roald Dahl, whom she married on July 2, 1953. The marriage had some initial bumps—Roald asking for a divorce the first year; but, crisis averted, their children began making their grand entrances—Olivia Twenty, born on April 20, 1955; Chantal Tessa Sophia, born on April 11, 1957; and Theo Matthew Roald, born on July 30, 1960. At the same time, Roald started thriving as a writer.\n\nThen “Greek tragedy” began enveloping their lives when, on December 5, 1960, their son Theo—Patricia’s “beautiful boy,” just four months old— was struck by a taxi as the family au pair was strolling him along a New York City street. He suffered brain damage, occasioning many surgeries and the family’s move back to England.\n\nAs Theo recovered, aided by Roald’s development of a therapeutic intervention, both career and family life blossomed anew: Patricia played Mrs. Failenson in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961) and they continued settling into a marvelous life in their white cottage with plush gardens at Great Missenden, not far from London, as, charmingly, Roald began testing his stories out on his children, and writing some hits.\n\nHowever, the following year, Olivia, not qualifying for a scarce measles vaccine, contracted and died of the disease on November 17, 1962.\n\nRoald was utterly devastated. But, as they gradually picked up the pieces, Patricia landed the role of Alma Brown in HUD (1963), for which she won the Best Actress Oscar—the director Martin Ritt kindly scheduling filming in segments so she could take care of her family. A year later, Ophelia Magdalena was born on May 12, 1964.\n\nNext up was John Ford’s Seven Women, which she began filming while pregnant (a fact known only to her and Roald), only to see life change inexorably when, on February 17, 1965, while bathing Tessa, she suffered three burst cerebral aneurysms. Only 39, she was in a coma for three weeks.\n\nAs she worked to recover, she was guided by the strong, firm hand of Roald—sometimes a bit too firm. Then, one day, she received a letter that would change her life—spiritually and emotionally. It was from Maria Cooper. While Roald later burned it up, along with the other materials on her desk, she will never forget the letter’s three key words: “I forgive you.”\n\n“The grace of God in Maria” is what prompted this gesture, Mother Dolores told EWTN’s The World Over. “Maria knew that forgiveness demands an action… one of the deepest realities of Christian love.”\n\nOn August 4, 1965, Patricia, having survived three strokes, gave birth to Lucy Neal. As her newborn baby grew, Patricia continued to heal physically, making her debut speech in 1966 at The Waldorf Astoria in New York. It was a signal achievement for someone who had had to learn how to walk and speak again. As she noted in her speech, for which she had prepped and practiced to a wearying degree, “Tennessee hillbillies don’t conk out that easy.”\n\nWhen she finished, she wrote, “I knew my life had been given back to me for one reason,” though she was unsure what that was. Later she recognized, among other purposes, her stroke brought attention to this all-too-common, debilitating medical emergency, serving as a catalyst for the building of many hospitals, including the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center in Knoxville, which she would champion the rest of her life.\n\nShe credited “Roald the Rotten” for throwing her back in the deep water “where I belonged.” Indeed, by 1967, she was cast to play the leading role in The Subject Was Roses (1968). While it was difficult to learn lines, she quipped in her book, “I was a hit… just for being alive.” In fact, she was fabulous.\n\nHowever, when she won the starring role in the television pilot of The Waltons (1971), she was not asked to play the role in the TV series because executives worried her health would not bear up under the pressure. Nor did her marriage bear up and, in 1972, Roald secretly began an affair with Catholic divorcee Felicity Crosland, the London-based freelance coordinator for David Ogilvy’s ad agency, who worked with Patricia when she began filming commercials for Maxim.\n\n“While I sold coffee in my beautiful brown dress (hand-picked by Felicity), she sat on the floor staring up at me, her eyes dewy with admiration. I thought, what a lovely girl,” Pat wrote. Felicity, or Liccy, as she was nicknamed, soon became a familiar face at the Dahl house. She lived in a flat in London near Albert Bridge and began taking over Patricia’s turf without her even realizing it.\n\nIn 1973, as her Knoxville High School 30th reunion approached and the Maxim campaign was percolating, Patricia found herself returning every three weeks to New York and used the opportunity to write to Maria Cooper, who wrote back, “I very much want to see you.” Finally, after many attempts, Maria agreed to join Patricia for breakfast in her hotel suite. Upon arriving, Patricia wrote, she “spread her arms open to me. She held me and the years of emptiness between me and Gary was over.”\n\n“An amazing grace,” Patricia wrote, occurred during that meeting as she realized for the first time since her stroke, its gift: “Somehow, a memory that once had the power to wound me now passed benignly through my head.”\n\nThe memory was also being set right, as Patricia poignantly recounted in As I Am:\n\n“Maria finally asked, ‘Is it true that you were pregnant by my father?’”\n\n“Yes, I am sorry I didn’t have it.”\n\n“It’s my loss, too. I’m the only one.”\n\nThen a familiar crinkle formed around her eyes. So like Gary’s. “It could have been a helluva lot of fun with you for a—shall I we say—stepmother?”\n\nBefore the meeting ended, Maria asked her to promise to write to her mother, now “Mrs. John Converse.” When Patricia lamented she wouldn’t know what to say, Maria said, “You will,” then gave her the address and left.\n\nA few years later, while in Nice in the summer of 1978, she again ran into Maria Cooper, now married to internationally renowned pianist Byron Janis. It was right after Patricia was separated from her family. “Mr. Roald Dahl,” Mother Dolores said, “threw her out of her home, laughingly—laughing, ‘Get out of here you tramp.’ He just took her to an airport and put her on a plane and said just get out of my life, get out of the country.”\n\nSensing Patricia’s inner turmoil, Maria asked her about her “faith in God.” Understandably, Pat was struggling with it, describing the tragedy in her life and asking, as Mother Dolores recounted, “‘What am I going to do with myself?’ Maria said, ‘You go see my friend at the Abbey.’ And, she said, ‘They’ll kill me.’ And, Maria said, ‘Don’t think of that. Go there. They’re friends of Gary’s.’”\n\nThat fall, Patricia called her, Maria said, and asked about that Abbey. Maria gave her the number and the name of her good friend, Mother Dolores, who had lived at the Abbey in consecrated life for 15 years. “Through grace,” Maria said, “she was the one who picked up the phone and made the appointment and took herself to the Abbey.” Maria’s role, she said, was to “give her the opportunity,” but after that “it was Pat’s party.”\n\nA few years later, having benefited from the Abbey’s consistent guidance, when Patricia was again in New York on location for Ghost Story (1981), she happened to see the death notice for Rocky’s second husband, Dr. John Marquis Converse, on February 1, 1981, and finally fulfilled the promise she made to Maria years earlier and wrote to her mother. After Rocky received the letter, Maria told Patricia she was so moved, that she read it “over and over.” Amazingly, Patricia told Osbourne, Rocky wrote her back on April 20, “my Olivia’s birthday.”\n\n“After some time had passed,” Maria said, “she and my mother arranged to meet.” That they became friends after years of acrimony was “so good,” Patricia told Osbourne. “It’s what life’s made of.”\n\nIn 1983, after Roald asked Patricia for a divorce, devastated, she came to the States intent on writing a scathing autobiography. “Patricia came to us and Mother Benedict Duss took her up to the tower,” said Mother Dolores, and had this priceless conversation:\n\n“Patricia, my friend, you are not going to write this book about Roald Dahl that’s in you.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“Because Dolores told me. I’m telling you, you’re not going to do it because you cannot spread further ugliness. It will never help you. You will never get better. You stay here.”\n\n“How can I stay here?”\n\n“Why don’t you become a pre-postulant for a couple of months? Just put on this dress, you know. Say you’re trying it out. Nobody will bother you. Believe me. It’s so quiet.”\n\n“Patricia came and she was the best duster we ever had,” Mother Dolores said, prompting more laughter that sprinkled this recounting. “She dusted everything.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Lady Abbess secretly wished “she could stay,” said Mother Dolores. “But then Patricia left to find out how she was going to get her life back.”\n\nSubsequently, Mother Dolores reached out to her good friend Dick DeNeut for help. His idea was to come and do a film with Patricia playing Anastasia to build her confidence. But, she continued, “In the final analysis, Lady Abbess told Patricia, ‘Mother Dolores will help you write the book.’ I said, ‘Yes, well, what shall I do.’ ‘Sit there with the typewriter, you listen to everything she says and write it down.’ I have 1200 pages of Patricia Neal.” After that, Mother Dolores pondered the gargantuan task of shaping it into a book and getting it published and again called Dick DeNeut who offered to edit it, helping transform it into As I Am.\n\nPatricia Neal’s relationship with the Abbey did not end there. “Patricia,” Mother Dolores said, “came back all of her life, she found a way.” For instance, “She used to come every time we had a fair to sell her book.”\n\nOne day, she “finally said to me, ‘You know, I’m going to become a Catholic before I die. It will just be when I die.’ I said, ‘You can’t do that to God.’ And, she said, ‘Why can’t I do that to God?,’” Mother Dolores flawlessly imitating that husky, expressive voice of Patricia’s.\n\n“It was about a day before she died that she converted,” said Mother Dolores.\n\n“She was one of the most fantastic persons on screen,” Mother Dolores said citing HUD. And, just how did she do it, Mother Dolores asked her? “You don’t think about it. You just do it,” Patricia said. “Don’t even worry about it. You just know what to do and it comes to you.”\n\nIn 1990, shortly before Theo turned 30, Patricia finally decided to call Roald and his now wife, Felicity, and let bygones be bygones. She talked to Roald three more times before his death later that year. November 17 was “the last time I hung up on my love,” she wrote in As I Am—coincidentally the anniversary of Olivia’s death as well as that of his mother.\n\nOn August 8, 2010, Patricia Neal died of lung cancer at the age of 84 in her beloved Martha’s Vineyard, and was laid to rest at the Abbey of Regina Laudis, according to her wishes. “At her burial,” Mother Dolores said, “a group of her buddies bade her farewell singing ‘Luck Be a Lady’ Tonight!”\n\n“She wanted to be buried at the Abbey and so her grave is at the Abbey in the cemetery right next to my grandmother and my mother’s,” said Mother Dolores of her “best friend.”\n\n*******"
