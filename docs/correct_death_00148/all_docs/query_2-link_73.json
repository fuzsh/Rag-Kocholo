        "text": "A few years back, Neil Gaiman and I did a joint event in New York City, when we were both in town.\n\nIt was a lot of fun, as events with Neil always are. We told some funny stories, talked about books and comics, about SANDMAN and WILD CARDS and days at cons… and touched on some serious topics too.\n\nI would like to upload a video of the event if I could, but I am not sure one exists. If anyone was recording us, I have never seen the tape. But VARIETY had the best report of the session.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2022/tv/news/george-rr-martin-neil-gaiman-hate-hollywood-changing-source-material-1235416651/\n\nThat was all back in 2022, but very little has changed since then. If anything, things have gotten worse. Everywhere you look, there are more screenwriters and producers eager to take great stories and “make them their own.” It does not seem to matter whether the source material was written by Stan Lee, Charles Dickens, Ian Fleming, Roald Dahl, Ursula K. Le Guin, J.R.R. Tolkien, Mark Twain, Raymond Chandler, Jane Austen, or… well, anyone. No matter how major a writer it is, no matter how great the book, there always seems to be someone on hand who thinks he can do better, eager to take the story and “improve” on it. “The book is the book, the film is the film,” they will tell you, as if they were saying something profound. Then they make the story their own.\n\nThey never make it better, though. Nine hundred ninety-nine times out of a thousand, they make it worse.\n\nOnce in a while, though, we do get a really good adaptation of a really good book, and when that happens , it deserves applause.\n\nI can came across one of those instances recently, when I binged the new FX version of SHOGUN.\n\nMust confess, I was dubious when I first heard they were making another version of the Clavell novel. It has been a long time, a long long LONG time, but I read the book when it first came out in the late 70s and was mightily impressed. (I really need to give it a reread one of these days, but there are so many books, so little time). And the 1980 miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain as the Anjin was a landmark of long form television, right up with with ROOTS; why do it over again, when that version was so good?\n\nI am glad they did, though. The new SHOGUN is superb. Better than Chamberlain’s version, you ask? Hmmm, I don’t know. I have not watched the 1980 miniseries since, well, 1980. That one was great too. The fascinating thing is that while the old and new versions have some significant differences — the subtitles that make the Japanese dialogue intelligible to English speaking viewers being the biggest — they are both faithful to the Clavell novel in their own way. I think the author would have been pleased. Both old and new screenwriters did honor to the source material, and gave us terrific adaptations, resisting the impulse to “make it their own.”\n\nBut don’t take my word for it. Watch it yourself.\n\nActing, directing, set design, costume… it’s all splendid here. Along with the writing.\n\nAnd if SHOGUN is a big enough hit, maybe the same team will adapt some of Clavell’s other novels.\n\nCurrent Mood: thoughtful\n\nLast month I zipped down to the Isleta Resort south of Albuquerque for an afternoon, to deliver the keynote speech for the 75th anniversary luncheon of the New Mexico Press Women, and to receive their Courageous Communicator Award.\n\nThat was a singular honor, and one that really set me to thinking. Our world needs courageous communicators more than ever in these dark divided days, when so many people would rather silence those they disagree with than engage them in debate and discussion. I deplore that… but had I really done enough, myself, to be recognized for courageous speech?\n\nI am not sure I have, truth be told. Yes, I’ve spoken up from time to time, on issues both large and small… but not always. It is always easier to remain silent, to stay on the sidelines and let the storms wash over you. The more I pondered, the more convinced I became that I need to do more. That we all need to do more.\n\nI started by delivering a 45 minute keynote address, on the subject of free speech and censorship. Which, I am happy to say, was very well received (I was not entirely sure it would be).\n\nAfter the luncheon plates had been cleared away and the speeches delivered, retiring NMPW president Sherri Burr handed out the awards, including the Courageous Communicator.\n\nThe text on the trophy reads, “New Mexico Press Women On the Occasion of its 75th Anniversary Bestows its COURAGEOUS COMMUNICATOR AWARD on March 15-16, 2024 to George R.R. Martin for building new worlds and creating strong, yet nuanced, women characters in his books and television shows.”\n\nMy thanks to Sherri, and to all the members of the NMWP.\n\nCurrent Mood: contemplative\n\nIt was Robert A. Heinlein who said we can never pay back the people who helped us when we started, so we need to pay forward instead.\n\nThe last week of February saw me return to the Chicago area, for a visit to my alma mater, Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism. Not for a homecoming or a class reunion, no… but to give away a chair. February 28 was the official investiture for Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, a fellow Medill alum (Class of ’97) as the inaugural holder of the George R.R. Martin Chair in Storytelling.\n\nI attended Medill back in what they now like to call “the turbulent 60s” (and no kidding, they were pretty turbulent), and departed with a couple of degrees, BSJ ’70, MSJ ’71. I did not get back often in the half-century that followed, alas. Life got in the way, as it has a habit of doing. But I always looked back fondly on my years in Evanston, and the courses and teachers that helped shape me as a writer.\n\nI had been writing long before I arrived in Illinois, of course. Monster stories for other kids in the projects in grade school (got a nickle each for them, enough for a Milky Way, and if I sold two I could buy a comic book) and amateur superhero stories for comic fanzines when I got to high school (Powerman, Dr. Weird, the White Raider, and Garizan the Mechanical Warrior), but it was during my years at Northwestern that I began to submit to professional magazines. It was while I was in Evanston that I got my first professional rejection slip (from AMERICAN SCANDINAVIAN REVIEW, for “The Fortress,” a story I wrote for a history class at Northwestern) and made my first professional sale (from GALAXY, for “The Hero,” a story I wrote for a creative writing class at Northwestern). So it seemed only fitting for me to “pay forward” to Medill for all I learned there, by endowing a chair in storytelling.\n\nThe investiture was my first opportunity to meet Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, who was chosen over thirty other highly qualified applicants to be the first “GRRM Professor.” It seemed only fitting that I give her an actual chair, as well, as the title… so I did.\n\n(I considered presenting her with a full-size Iron Throne, but it would not have fit in her new office).\n\nCheryl has written both fiction and non-fiction. She has been a news and fashion reporter for the Wall Street Journal, InStyle, the Baltimore Sun, and other major news outlets. Her books include the bestselling novel SARONG PARTY GIRLS, set in her native Singapore. She will teach both undergraduate and graduate students, organize panels and conferences, and conduct an intensive writing workshop every summer, to help professional journalists cross over into creative writing.\n\n“​​Storytelling is at the foundation of our school, and Cheryl’s expertise in telling her own stories and helping others tell their stories will allow Medill to build on its tradition of excellence in this area,” Medill Dean Charles Whitaker said when announcing her appointment.\n\nMedill presented Cheryl Tan with a splendid medallion at her investiture. (She is wearing it in the picture above). And hey, I got one too.\n\nIt was such a delight to be back in Evanston, if only for a few hours… and to meet Cheryl Tan. I expect that she’ll be terrific.\n\nCurrent Mood: pleased\n\nExciting news for all the Wild Cards fans out there. Today is the publication day for the newest Wild Cards hardcover from Bantam, the thirty-third volume in the overall series… but no, you do not need to have read the first thirty-two to enjoy this book.\n\nSLEEPER STRADDLE is the title. And yes, as our long-time readers will no doubt guess, this one features a character who has been around since the first Wild Cards Day (September 15, 1946 — the day Howard Waldrop was born): the Sleeper, created by the late great Roger Zelazny.\n\nIn poker, a sleeper straddle is a blind raise, made from a position other than the player “under the gun.” Sleepers are often considered illegal out-of-turn play and are commonly disallowed. In Wild Cards, the Sleeper is Croyd Crenson, who was a high school freshman on his way home from school when the virus was released over Manhattan. From that day on, Croyd has been continuously reinfected by the virus whenever he sleeps, his body reshaping itself into a myriad of new shapes and forms. Each time he wakes, he is changed. Sometimes he wakes as an ace, with astonishing new superpowers, different every time. Other times he wakes as a joker, malformed and hideous. He lives in terror of the day he draws the black queen, and does not wake at all. Croyd can sleep for days, weeks, even months, but when awake he does all he can to keep sleep at bay. Unable to hold a normal job or have a normal relationship, he lives on the margins of society; he has been a bodyguard, a thief, a mercenary, a con man, a hero for hire… whatever it takes to survive. Everyone knows Croyd, and no one really knows Croyd.\n\nYou never know what you are going to get when the Sleeper wakes. He is the ultimate wild card… and our most iconic character. It is long past time he had a book of his own.\n\nThe lineup this time around:\n\n“Days Go By,” by Carrie Vaughn,\n\n“The Hit Parade,” by Cherie Priest ,\n\n“Yin-Yang Split,” from William F. Wu,\n\n“Semiotics of the Strong Man,” by Walter Jon Williams,\n\n“Party Like It’s 1999,” from Stephen Leigh,\n\n“The Bloody Eagle,” by Mary Anne Mohanraj,\n\n“The Boy Who Would Be Croyd,” from Max Gladstone.\n\nThe stories will be tied together by “Swimmer, Flier, Felon, Spy” from Christopher Rowe, featuring his enigmatic investigator Tesla. Other featured characters will include old favorites like Golden Boy, Oddity, Lazy Dragon, and Ramshead, along with some great new aces and a colorful assortment of jokers and jacks.\n\nYe editor is hardly objective, of course, but I have to confess, I have always loved Croyd, and it was great to see him in action again, in tales that spanned the decades, from the Fifties to the present day. Those of you who are already Sleeper fans will be delighted, I think, and as for all the readers out there who have yet to meet Mr. Crenson… you have a treat in store.\n\nRoger would have loved this book, I like to think. I hope you will as well.\n\nHoward Waldrop died on January 14 in Texas, of a stroke. He was 77 years old. (Two years my senior, barely).\n\nThe world got a little darker then.\n\nI learned of Howard’s passing through a phone call from a mutual friend. I was away from home when it happened, out of the country, with no email and no internet, else I would have posted something here much sooner.\n\nHoward and I never lived in the same city, nor the same state, but we had been friends for a long long time. When we first “met” — via comic fandom and the US mail — John F. Kennedy was in the White House and both of us were in high school, Howard in Texas and me in New Jersey. I had just bought a comic book from him. BRAVE & BOLD #28, as it happened. Starro the Conquerer. Howard charged me a quarter. When he sent the comic, he backed it up with a nice drawing of a barbarian on stiff cardboard, and a friendly letter asking me if I liked Conan. We struck up a correspondence that lasted more than half a century. We finally met in person in 1972, at MidAmerican Con in Kansas City. He was my oldest friend from the SF community… the kindest, brightest, funniest man you could meet… and one of the greatest writers of his generation.\n\nHe was one of a kind. There will never be another like him. But he only wrote one-and-a-half novels, so he never got the acclaim (or the money) that he deserved. These days, short story writers get little respect (’twas not always so, at least in SF and fantasy) and less money. And Howard Waldrop was among the very best short story writers ever to work in our genre.\n\nAnd certainly the most original.\n\nI last spoke to Howard less than a week before his death. He has been living in an assisted living hotel in Austin for the past few years. We have been adapting a few of Howard’s classic stories into short films, and our mutual friend Robert Taylor had just screened a rough cut of MARY-MARGARET ROAD GRADER for him on his laptop. (Howard did not use a computer and had no truck with email, texts, or social media). I was calling to ask if he liked it. He did, I am pleased to say… and I am so so so happy that he got to see the film before he left us. He was not entirely happy when we spoke… he had fallen out of bed a few days before, and had required help to get back up. That made him grouchy. Howard gave good grouchy. But talking about the film cheered him up. That was good to hear. He was laughing by the time we ended the call.\n\nWe are making a couple of other Waldrop adaptations as well, and I promised him I’d get him a cut of those as well before the end of January. I never dreamed when hanging up that we would never speak again.\n\nThere’s so much more I could say about Howard… and I will, I will. But not today. This would turn into a novel if I told all my stories in one long post. So many memories. So much laughter. So much love.\n\nI still cannot believe he is gone. I want to call him up right now, and hear him laugh again.\n\nCurrent Mood: gloomy"
