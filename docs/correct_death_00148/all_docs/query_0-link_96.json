        "text": "The Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre\n\nThe Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre is an independent charity, founded in 2001 by Roald Dahl’s widow, Liccy. Their founding objective as a charity is to further the education of the public in the art of literature and creativity, by running a museum and literature centre based on the works of Roald Dahl.\n\nSince the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre opened their doors in 2005, they have used the example of Roald Dahl’s creative craft to show that what he did, YOU can do too. More than a million people have visited the Museum to date, including an average of 10,000 school children every year."
