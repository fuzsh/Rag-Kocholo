        "text": "As I went across the various Dictionaries of Myths I talked to you about, I noticed quite a number of Medea-related articles. So, let’s begin with an article about the “Antique Medea”, written by Alain Moreau. As usual, loosely translated by me.\n\nI/ Positive beginnings\n\nA dreaded sorceress and a bloodthirsty killer: those are the two traits that have been imposed on any depiction of Medea, and that for a very long time. To be precise, this portrait can be dated back to Euripides’ Medea in 431 BCE. It might surprise one to discover that it was not always the case, and that the original Medea might have been a benevolent goddess. As often in mythology, the name reveals (or betrays) the origins: Medea’s name seems to be formed of the Indo-European root “med”, which split in modern language in two domains, the one of “meditation” and the one of “medicine”. This etymological origin is reflected in the myth, as Medea prepares all sorts of medicine and remedies – it is with them that, during her stay in Thebes, she healed Herakles who had just murdered his own children after being cursed with madness by Hera. She is also depicted as having the power of rejuvenating the old Aeson, Jason’s father, as well as giving back youth to Jason himself and to the Hyades, the nurses of Dionysos. It is also her who, in Colchis, covers Jason’s body with an herbal ointment which protects him from the deadly fire blown by the bulls of Aietes (the herb used was the legendary “prometheion”, which appeared on the slopes of Caucasus from the blood of Prometheus which falls to the ground each time Zeus’ eagle comes to eat the Titan’s liver). Considering all of this, it is very likely that Medea was originally one of the manifestations or avatar of the great Mother-Goddesses that were once honored throughout Greece and the Near-East, in the image of Cybele, Gaia, Rhea or Demeter. It is not a surprise, according to this reading, that one day she gains for a paredra a male god of smaller importance, “Iasôn”, Jason, whose name is linked to the verb “iaomai” (to heal), to the character of Iasô, a goddess of health daughter of Asklepios, and to the term “iatros”, a doctor, a term still found today with terms such as “psychiatrist” or “pediatrist”.\n\nUp until this point all is good. In the second stage of her evolution, Medea stays a benevolent character, but the goddess leaves the context of religion (and thus a static and synchronic state) to enter a “chronical” state, the one of a tale inscribed in time, the one of the legend and the myth. She becomes a helper, an auxiliary, who helps the hero to perform what seems to be impossible deeds. Thanks to her, Jason dominates the fire-breathing bulls, kills the giants born out of the ground, becomes the owner of the Golden Fleece, escapes Aietes’ ships. According to Hesiode, it is thanks to her, thanks to his new wife, thanks to the “virgin with glittering eyes” that Jason could return to Iolkos safe and happy. Still according to Hesiode, once back to Jason’s homeland she gave him a son, Medeios, who was raised by Chiron in the mountains ; and all of this was part “of the plan of the Great Zeus”. Reading these lines, one can hear the ending of a fairytale: “They married, had many children, and lived happily ever after”. With the slight nuance that Hesiod claims they only had one son.\n\nThings however were already starting to look dark. Because in this tale, we recognize a folkloric motif: the hero of the folktales must triumph of the traps laid before him with the help of a princess. However this theme is deeply linked to another fairytale motif: “the hero is helped by the devil’s daughter”. Aietes, indeed, is a being of the Otherworld. He is the master of Aia, “the land”, a nameless land, located far away in the East, and which can only be reached by crossing the unpassable rocks, the Symplegades, similar to the doors of Hades. The difference between the myth of Jason and the fairytales is that, in folklore, the devil’s daughter usually stays with her father. The terrible mistake of Jason, or rather his respect of the deal he formed with Medea (the idea of Jason’s perjury only comes in later evolutions), leads to him bringing her into the world of humankind, where she does not belong, and where she can only cause blood and death. Pindar depicts, in his fourth Pythic, a blond-haired Jason filled with male confidence who accepts the terrible trials imposed by Pelias the usurper, and who leads gloriously the Argonauts expedition towards the Golden Fleece – but if Pindar presents us a beautiful and positive picture, in truth, already by 462 BCE, the myth of Jason and Medea is blood-stained.\n\nII/ The infanticide\n\nThe determining element that shifted the glorious myth to the abominable tragedy is the theme of the infanticide. It appears with the epic poet Eumelos (8th or 7th century BCE) where Medea kills by accident her children in an attempt to give them immortality, by burying them in the sanctuary of Hera (the katakryptia process). But she fails, just like Thetis failed to give immortality to her son Achilles: the children die smothered alive. Medea has good intentions, but commits a bad action. Then, with the epic poet Creophylos (third quarter of the 6th century BCE), Medea is falsely accused by the Corinthians of killing her children, because they want to get revenge on her for the murders of king Creon and the princess Creusa/Glauke. Finally, it is Euripides, in 431, who synthetizes the two versions: he is the first to write that Medea actually and willingly killed her children.\n\nAs soon, the new image of Medea is set and fixed: she is a killer of men. She killed her brother Apsyrtos, that she stabbed before cutting him into pieces and throwing them in the sea, to slow down the Colchian pursuers. She killed the father, since he received an oracle telling him he would die by losing the Golden Fleece (according to Diodorus, he died during a night battle between the Colchians and the Argonauts). She killed Pelias, the uncle of her husband, manipulating his daughters into slitting his throat in the hope of bringing him back to life in a magic cauldron. She killed the king of Corinth, Creon, who was guilty of trying to marry Jason to his daughter, and to exile Medea. She killed her children, all boys – and this is the most famous part of her myth. She killed her husband, that she convinces to sleep by the shadow of the Argo, which was rotting on the sand: a piece of it falls and crushed his head. Finally, she is the killer of Perses, Aietes’ brother, who had usurped Colchis’ throne. Only Theseus managed to escape death at her hands in Athens.\n\nIII/ From one myth to another\n\nEuripides is thus the one who completely shifted the myth and turned Medea into this beautiful and dangerous character that imposed herself in literature. By showing, at the end of his play, Medea flying away of the palace on a dragon-tied chariot sent by her grandfather Helios, he gives her back the supernatural nature she had lost by being turned into the princess of Colchis. But the benevolent goddess has been turned into an elemental power, monstrous and maleficent. According to Seneca, the name “Medea” is linked to other words in “m”: “mare” (the sea), “metus” (dread), “malum” (evil), “monstrum” (monster), “Medusa” (the Gorgon). She is also the “mater”, the mother, but a mother who kills her children. The summit of this nefarious power is reached with Dracontius, at the end of the 5th century CE, who tells of how Medea manages to “remove the horns of the full moon”, an immense feat of magic never repeated to this day. Considering this, it is quite surprising to see that Medea now ends her career as the mere wife of Achilles (alongside Helen, Iphigenia, and Polyxene) in either the Elysian Fields or the Blessed Islands. This part of the legend appeared with Ibycos, in the second half of the 6th century BCE, before being repeated by Simonide (556-467 BCE) and finally by Lycophron, an “antiquarian”, that is to say a mythographer who collected the older and more ancient versions of legends, those of a time when Medea was a benevolent entity.\n\nWe already saw two of the reasons that explain why Medea the generous goddess becomes the bloodthirsty monster: first, the introduction of a being of the Otherworld into the human world that is the Greek civilization ; second, the evolution of the motif of the infanticide. But there are three other important elements to take into account. First of all being her relationship with Thessaly: Medea is linked to this country through Jason, who is born in Thessaly, and through the city of Ephyra. The Thessalian land was considered to be the country of witches: the Latin poets and writers always had the word “witch” or “sorceress” be followed by the adjective “Thessalian”, and the connotations of witchcraft were almost always negative.\n\nThe second element to take into account is Medea’s relationship with the Orient, which also brings us back to witchcraft and magic. It is from the East that Helios rises every day on his chariot, on his journey to the West, and Helios has among his descendants many witches, such as Circe, Pasiphae… or Medea. But above all, the Orient is characterized by cunning, cruelty and barbary, all traits that Medea bears when she tricks the daughters of Pelias, when she lies to Creon and Jason, when she kills and disembowels, when she had the Corinthian princess die in atrocious pain through a drug that burns her like acid. The Barbarian is the invader, like the Medes who had invaded Greece (and whose name was linked to the one of Medea): this is why all the iconographic depictions posterior to 480 BCE (the battle of Salamine) show Theseus the Greek fighting against Medea the Mede.\n\nThe third reason for this change of good to evil is that, at least since Euripides, Medea is perceived as a “virile woman”: in a Greek society dominated by men, such a masculine woman is to be a monster. Euripides has her use constantly a military language: she prefers to be “three times on the line, three times with the shield by her side” rather than to “give birth one more time” ; she wants to “do like hoplits”, she wants to use a word, to use strength, she keeps talking about her enemies and her glory. The Athenian, who typically locks up his woman in the gynecea, can’t stand such words.\n\nIV/ Terror and pity\n\nYet, Euripides is a much too talented of a playwright to create just a melodrama character. He uses the two tools of the tragedy, terror and pity. Medea is also the poor young woman abandoned by the one who seduced her, she is alone, far away from her family, of which she cut herself off due to her actions. She is the bronze-skinned foreigner that is disdained and dreaded, and as such she is the perfect scapegoat. She is a being of flesh torn by conflicting feelings, her hatred for Jason, and her love for her children ; children that she turns into tools for her revenge against her cowardly and unfaithful husband, while perfectly knowing that the crime she is about to commit will break not just Jason’s heart, but also her own. This duality is still maintained centuries after Euripides. Most authors of Antiquity (Ovid, Seneca, Dracontius) put a focus on the violence and monstrosity of the character – outside of a few, such as Apollonios of Rhodes or Valerius Flaccus, who rather focus on the birth of Jason’s and Medea’s love. However, modern and contemporary authors are much more nuanced: as such Cherubini, Lamartine, Grillparzer and Legouvé focus on the duality of Medea, putting at the center of their work the idea of this dark-skinned foreigner who is both dreaded and rejected. The picture of Medea as the gypsy woman is central in the works of Anouilh, Max Rouquette and Christa Wolf, who all stay faithful to the themes of the pharmakos and of the scape-goat, already present by Euripides’ work.\n\nNext article, following a chronological order, is “Medea, from the 16th to the 18th centuries”, written by Patrick Werly.\n\nDuring the Middle-Ages, Medea is depicted in several tales. Benoît de Sainte-Maure’s Roman de Troie, in the middle of the 12th century; Guillaume de Loris and Jean de Meng’s Roman de la Rose, in the 13th century; the anonymous Moralized Ovid of the 14th century ; the Jugement du Roy de Navarre by Guillaume de Machaut in the 14th century, etc…\n\nBetween the 16th and 18th centuries, Medea was mostly encountered on theater stages and within operas, in works that are more inspired by the tragedies of Seneca and Euripides, rather than by the Metamorphoses of Ovid. However, there was an effort of appropriation to be made: indeed, the myth of Medea the Scythian, of Medea the Barbarian, part of the classical works of Antiquity, was at risk of ruining the moral values and the aesthetic system that Europe had imposed upon itself. As such, a “displacement” of the figure was required. Three main authors have to be considered: Calderon de la Barca, Pierre Corneille, and Thomas Corneille as the librettist of Marc Antoine Charpentier.\n\nI/ The allegorical reading\n\nThe authors of the 17th century mostly found their sources in a mythology manual that had been published in 1552 by Noël Conti (or Noël le Comte, in Latin Natalis Comes, 1520-1582), and which was titled: “Mythology, or the explanation of fables, containing the genealogies of the gods, the ceremonies of their sacrifices, their deeds, their adventures, their loves, and almost all of the principles of the natural and moral philosophy”. Corneille used it to write his Conquête de la Toison d’Or, Caderon also probably used it for his El divino Jason. The seventh chapter of the sixth book is dedicated to Medea: after retelling the myth, Noël Conti presents the “physical mythology”, then the “moral mythology”. In both cases, the process it to try to use the myth for the moral edification of the reader, through mean of the allegory. As such, the reason behind the “dissection and death of Medea’s brothers and children” is because she wanted to put behind her appetite and concupiscence: “if someone let themselves we trapped by the slimy nets of unreasonable pleasures of the flesh, of greed, of cruelty; then it is to no surprise that good advice and counsel climbs on its chariot and flies away in the sky with winged dragon”. According to the etymology offered by Noël Conti, and that Calderon will reuse, Medea is “the advice”, “the counsel”, that is to say, the scholastic tradition, the wise decision, the choice made after a deliberation. The mythographer is aware of the negative image of Medea: but it does not matter if she is good or evil for, in the tradition of the Moralized Ovid, Medea needs to have a usefulness for the moral and religious domains. “Whether we take Medea to be advice and prudence, or to be a very wicked and malevolent woman, the Ancients, through this Fable, intended to shape us and lead us to probity, and to the integrity of the mores”. This is the moral lesson we must keep: the violence of the myth is transposed for the benefit of virtue.\n\nThis allegory can be found in the self-sacramental El divino Jason, composed in 1634 by Calderon de la Barca (1600-1681). In this play, the allegory is explicitly Christian since Jason is the Christ, Hercules saint Peter, Orpheus saint John the Baptist, etc… The fleece represents the soul, the one of a lost sheep which fled from the herd of the Christ and that Jason is thus looking for. But the quest of Jason is a dual one, because the soul is also depicted by Medea, which is also the allegory for Gentilism. Jason says of her: “Medea, who means / Advisor and Knowledgeable in all / was once the Gentilism / which offered itself to the superstitious rites / of magic / and to its idols which are but air / smoke, dust and nothingness”. The task of Jason is to bring Medea with him on the Argo ship to take her away from the land of Colchis, but also to free her from the influence of Idolatry, an actual character of the play, which embodies the religion and the pagan wisdom of the Antiquity.\n\nWhen Medea encounters Jason for the first time, on the shores of Colchis, she decides to simulate her love (“Amor le pienso fingir”), but Jason tells her he only came here to love her (“Vengo a amarte”), and then Medea is caught by her own trap, and falls in love truly (“Pensaba fingir amores / y va verdaderos son”). When she offers herself to Jason, she also offers at the same time the Fleece that he came here to seek (“Digo que de amores muero ; / tuyo sera el vellocino / que buscas, Jason divino”).\n\nFollows a strange scene in which Theseus (here, saint Andre) pronounces a long, poetic speech filled with proper names (those of the Argonauts, of Medea, of Idolatry), with names of flowers, of colors, of virtues. Each, when they hear their name, or the name of their flower, color, virtue, answers Theseus. Medea chose the clover (a leaf without a flower, which makes a beautiful border for others’ bouquets), the color green, and the virtue of Hope. In this long passage, a baroque chorus presents the union of Medea to Jason as her union to Christianity, as well as her rejection of Idolatry (“No quiero / seguirte mas, fero monstruo / Oh, como y ate aborezeo!”)\n\nJason, to redeem the mistakes of Medea, will undergo the trial of taking the Golden Fleece away from its tree (which is also the Tree of Adam). At the top, he replaces the Fleece with a Lamb which bleeds, and whose light blinds and strikes down Idolatry, while Hell opens up below her. Calderon did not stage in any way the magical powers of Medea: here, she is only a sorceress by reputation. Magic is only due to the characters of the Idolatry, and of the King (which represents the World), but it is powerless against the Argonauts led by Jason. What replaces magic in terms of supernatural effects, is the miracle, the one that Jason accomplishes. In the dramaturgy of the play, the actions that go beyond the power of man are not those of magic, but those of religion, the one to which Medea converts herself. In this allegory, the barbarian, the wizardess, abandons all of her attributes to follow the pastor-Jason. The sheep found back its flock, the soul now belongs to the Church.\n\nII/Medea as a victim\n\nMédée is the first tragedy of Pierre Corneille, which was played during the season of 1634-1635. The play is already a work part of the classical canon (the author tries to respect the unicity of location, time and action), but it does not respect the rule of “bienséance”, since we see dying on stage the king and the princess. Corneille, in his letter-preface to his play, explains that poetry often makes “beautiful imitations of actions we should not imitate”, and he plays on the two meanings of the verb “imitate”. But it is also a trick of Corneille to keep the moral safe. Indeed, the actions of Medea can be explained by the fact that she is victim of a political conspiracy; it is an explanation that allows to rationalize her actions, and thus judge them by the light of “common reason”. Jason, the man that she loves, presents himself as such: “Thus I am not one of those vulgar lovers / I adjust my flame to the good of my businesses / And under whichever climate fate would throw me / I will be in love by State maxim” (I,1). And Creon, the king, talks about Egeus, who originally had to marry Creusa before she was promised to Jason: “Whichever reasons of State might satisfy him” (II,3). Marriage is thus placed under the sign of the “reason of the State”, of which Medea is the victim. She pleads her cause by herself in these words: “Anyone who condemns a criminal without hearing them / Even if they deserved a thousand times their punishment / Turns a just sentence into an injustice” (II,2).\n\nCorneille thus introduced a judiciary dimension to his play: Medea was condemned to exile for the murder of Pelias, but she was not properly put on trial. She becomes the victim of Creon’s tyranny. But beyond her, it is all of her family, an entire dynastic branch that is victim of a tyrannical power. Indeed, Medea is the grand-daughter of the Sun, and if Jason marries Creusa, their children will dishonor the dynasty: “You will mingle, impious one, and put on the same rank / The nephews of Sisyphus and those of the Sun! / […] / I will gladly prevent this odious mixing, / Which dishonors together my family and my gods” (III,3). As such, the series of crimes is explained: Creusa’s death prevents the misalliance, while the death of the children both suppresses radically the cause of the dynastic troubles while also hurting Jason. Medea answers to the conspiracy created “by reason of State” by what was called in the 17th century a “coup d’Etat”, a premeditated act conceived in secret and that goes beyond common law. This coup d’Etat is here placed on the mythological terrain of magic, as Louis Marin analyzed. Pierre Corneille seems to be so far the only author to have turned the murder of Medea into a political act – the 20th century also made the myth politic, but in a different context.\n\nCorneille wrote another play which features Medea: La Conquête de la Toison d’or (1660). Medea the sorceress is here also a garden architect: the setting of the first act is a French-style garden, seen in perspective, and the character of Absyrte reveals that it was conceived by Medea’s art, the only one able to create such a beauty in a savage and hostile nature. Magic is here linked to the laws of geometry ; but it can be vanquished by the laws of love, such as in the twelfth Héroïde of Ovid, or to be more precise by the superior power of love. Medea says to Jason that she cannot help but love him despite his treachery: “Are you in my art a greater master than me?” (II,2). This art, she later says to her brother Absyrte, “if it has on all else an absolute power / Far from charming hearts, it doesn’t see anything in them” (IV, 1). Thus, the tragedy exposes the limits of the power of Medea: we are far away from the supreme power of the 1635 tragedy.\n\nIII / Medea in the opera: the embodiment of division\n\nIn their 1693 lyrical tragedy Médée, Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Thomas Corneille use, just like Pierre Corneille did before them, Seneca as their main source, but their opera is not concerned with the political dimension of the tragedy. What is rather important here is to gather around the character of the sorceress the most spectacular elements. We see Medea, helped by demons, by Vengeance, and by Jealousy, preparing in a cauldron the poison that will kill her rival (III,7). We see the guards of the king trying to seize Medea, but turning their weapons against each other before seizing Creon, and finally leaving to pursue “ghosts with the shape of pleasant women” (IV, 7). At the end of the fourth act, the earth opens below Creon, and he sees Medea in the waters of the Styx, while the orchestra is divided into two very distinctive groups of instruments. A same motif recurs in those scenes, like a choreography: the idea of division and separation. The guards are divided by fighting against each other, then they turn against the king they receive order froms, then the earth splits open… Medea is the one who separates, she is the creator of strife and discord. In III, 4, she says about herself and Jason “And may the crime separate us / As the crime joined us”. In the final scene, after killing her children, she claims to Jason: “Unfaithful! After your betrayal / Should I have seen my sons in the sons of Jason?”, a sentence in which the “us” disappears for the “you”, and where Medea dissociates herself from her children.\n\nBut Medea herself is divided. As the king kills himself, she is herself fractured. In the scenes IV, 5 and V, 1, she deliberates about the murder of her children, and this deliberation (in a typical 17th century fashion) is divided, as much on a semantic level as on a musical one. When the oscillation of the wizardess’ mind makes her regret her decision, we hear a slow, deep, internal music of cord instruments ; but when she is resolved to commit her crime, the tempo becomes faster and the clavecin dominates. The two rhythm finally converge when she takes her decision, because her doubts are only there for a theatrical effct. Medea is still Medea (“When you boast of being king / Remember that I am Medea”, IV, 6), as she was with Seneca (Nunc sum Medea) and as she was with Corneille (“Madam, I am queen / - And I am Medea, Conquête, III, 4).\n\nIn the genre of the opera, other pieces of note include Il Giasone (1649) of Pier Francesco Cavalli, and Medea (1797) by Luigi Cherubini, on a French booklet by François Benoît Hoffmann, where Medea switches between supplications and threats, in a role that was made famous in the 20th century by Maria Callas.\n\nIV/ Medea in paintings and drawings\n\nJean-François de Troy (1679-1752) painted, for an Histoire de Jason in seven pieces by the Gobelin manufacture, a Médée enlevée sur son char après avoir tué ses enfants (1746). This is an episode taken from the seventh book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and Ovid will indeed be the main source of painters, rather than Euripides or Seneca. Medea, on her chariot pulled by two winged dragons, has a cold, hateful stare. In one hand she holds her magic wand, with the other she points towards the body of her two dead children. Jason is trying to pull out his sword while a soldier restrains him. In the background, Corinth and Creon’s palace are burning. Two small Cupids are behind the chariot. One is breaking his bow with his knee, the other is ripping off his blindfold. This detail explains the meaning of the scene, its allegory: the two little gods of love refuse their own power, upon seeing the devastation of love when it turns into a jealousy-fueled hatred. Or maybe should we understand the message as: if such a disaster is to be avoided, love must stop to be blind. All in all, the depiction of the myth of Medea must have a moral purpose: love must be much more aware and conscious, and it should be treated with logic and reason.\n\nTo find back the tragedy and the violence of the antique myth, we must look at two drawings of Poussin from around 1645, the second being a cleaner variation of the first. The scene depicts Medea killing her second child: she holds the child naked, by the leg, his head upside-down, and she raises her arm to hit his heart with a dagger. The first child is dead on the floor, and a terrorized woman, crumpled near his body, turns herself towards Medea to stop her. A bit above, separated by a balcony, unable to stop her, Jason points his arms towards Medea while Creusa lifts her hands towards the heavens. On the second drawing, a statue of Minerva also lifts her arms to the sky, using her shield as a protection not to see what is about to happen. All the violence of the scene can be read in the way the hands are organized in this drawing – and this violence, rarely depicted in such a direct way during the 17th century, is the one of Seneca’s tragedy."
