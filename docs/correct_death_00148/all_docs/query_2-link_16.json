        "text": "As Cardiff gets set to celebrate the centenary of Roald Dahl 's birth with a major two-day festival, his widow has revealed how 'amazed' he would have been by the event.\n\nWhile Dahl and Felicity, known as Liccy, lived in Buckinghamshire, the writer was born in Llandaff, Cardiff to Norwegian parents and it's the Welsh capital which is staging City Of The Unexpected.\n\nLiccy will be in Cardiff this weekend when Dahl's stories will come to life on what will probably be their biggest live stage during the celebration.\n\nDirector Nigel Jamieson, who met Dahl when he was dating his daughter, has taken charge. He describes it as what would happen in Cardiff, if Dahl took it over.\n\nWhat is taking place in the event is unknown. It’s top secret. What we do know is 6,000 people are taking part. There will be circus performers, sports teams, choirs, drivers and old people on mobility scooters.\n\n“No other city is doing a celebration like Cardiff is,” says Liccy, whi will be present with family members, although their role is secret too.\n\n“All I know is that I’m coming with Theo, my stepson and his wife. We’re all coming to Cardiff for the weekend. I think we’ll be given instructions then. It’s a mystery to us as well.\n\n“I think he (Roald) would be amazed. He always held Llandaff and Wales in great affection.\n\n“The one thing I’m longing to do is go to the National Museum of Wales where Quentin’s (Blake's) drawings are. And there’s a wonderful portrait of Roald.\n\n“I haven’t seen that in situ yet.\n\n\"The legacy he has in Cardiff is something he would appreciate.\n\n“I think he would be overwhelmed. When we look at Roald Dahl Plass that was named after him and the blue plaque, it’s fantastic what Cardiff has done and how they have embraced him as one of their heroes.”\n\nWatch: An interview with Nigel Jamieson, director of City Of The Unexpected\n\nGrowing up in Cardiff\n\nAfter moving from Norway, Dahl’s father Harald had built up his business and name in Cardiff. After losing his first wife, he remarried to Sofie Magdalene – Dahl’s mother.\n\nRoald was born in Cardiff on September 13, 1916 and his family had what seems an idyllic existence.\n\nSofie described Villa Marie as her “dream home” – it had been designed by her husband – but it was at Ty Mynydd in Radyr where children felt they had made it. It was a home complete with turrets, fields, animals, its own laundry and outbuildings. It’s easy to see why Dahl’s biographer thinks it had an “idealised” place in the children’s minds, a place where dreams and adventures were made. But, it wasn’t to last.\n\nDahl’s sister Astri died after complications from appendicitis. She was Harald’s “favourite” and after the seven-year-old died, Harald never recovered and also died within weeks.\n\nWith an estimated value of £5m, you would have expected the family’s idyllic life could have continued even without Harald, but by Christmas 1920, the farm was put on the market.\n\nIt was another loss for a young Dahl.\n\nDahl’s biographer Donald Sturrock explains: “The house came to embody a kind of paradise, irretrievably taken from them at a very young age.\n\n“This sense of loss is echoed in many of Roald Dahl’s books, most strikingly perhaps in James and the Giant Peach, where, on the very first page ‘the perfect life for a small boy’ — which in this instance involved beaches, sun and sand rather than horses, fields and servants — comes to an abrupt end.”\n\nFrom there the family moved to Cumberland Lodge, now part of Howell’s School.\n\nDespite the loss of his sister and father, life for Roald continued. He was a regular at Ninian Park, taken by a family friend where he discovered not only the benefit of being tall (so he could see over the heads of others) but also the “thrill” of seeing the game.\n\n“It was thrilling to stand there among those thousands of other men,” he later wrote, “cheering our heroes when they did well and groaning when they lost the ball.”\n\nHis schooldays\n\nBy now, he was at kindergarten at Elm Tree House, ahead of his enrolment at Llandaff Cathedral School.\n\nOn one hand, the prank that many believed inspired one of his most famous stories and its hero Charlie, was childish and innocent.\n\nBut the impact wasn’t.\n\nIn short, Dahl found a dead mouse, he took it to play a trick on the shopkeeper in Llandaff village. When she wasn’t looking, he hid it in a sweet jar. When Mrs Pratchett found it, she understandably dropped it and smashed the jar. She knew who was responsible, and told the headteacher.\n\nAll five boys responsible were beaten. In a graphic description in Boy, Dahl explains the impact that beating had on him.\n\nWhen his mother saw the resulting “scarlet stripes” she marched to the school and gave him “a piece of her mind”.\n\nIt is that episode that many believe inspired the vicious bullies seen in so many of his books and that scenario is played out in Danny the Champion of the World.\n\nIt was also something that continued to play on Dahl’s mind, years and decades later.\n\nLiccy explains: “In those days, the terrible surely that children at boarding schools went though. That was diabolical. That really, I think, had an effect on his mind for the whole of his life.\n\n“Whenever there was child abuse on the news or came to our attention, he would rile against it. I could tell that it reminded him of those bad days.\n\n“But look at his wonderful mother, Sofia Magdalene. When she saw the marks on her child, how she stood up to the head master. What a wonderful woman and a huge influence on his life. She protected her children but she didn’t mollycoddle them. She was adventurous and she was intrepid. I think that gave him the guts for not only being a school but also a father himself and through the rest of his life”.\n\nBut it didn’t overpower him. Many, including Liccy, believe the opposite – that it inspired him.\n\nCreating Charlie\n\n“If you go through his books, I mean certainly sweets were the ultimate influence. I think it goes back to him being able to talk to children. All children love sweets and he loved them. Mrs Pratchett started a rather extraordinary imaginary world of confectionary.\n\n“It must have influenced Charlie.”\n\nLife in Wales\n\nHis experiences in Wales lived with him.\n\nLiccy explains: “He enjoyed it so. Llandaff Cathedral school influenced him like mad. His schooldays would make such a huge inspiration. They do on all of us when we’re young but I think it made an enormous inspiration on Roald. I think these were the start of many things in his mind and particularly later in his books.”\n\nHis freedom in Cardiff, his adventures in Tenby on holiday, did inspire him.\n\n“He was definitely adventurous. When he was in Great Missenden and the fire engine would start its siren he would grab the children in order to go and watch and find where the fire was. Adventure was so important to him”.\n\nIt’s that sense of adventure he wanted to pass on.\n\nChildren and computers\n\nNo-one can argue that his books have an enduring appeal. You’re just as likely to see a child reading the books now as 50 years ago.\n\n“It’s fantastic. He is so contemporary.”\n\nBut when they were written, it was a world without technology or computers. Children were children. “I don’t know where what he would think, or I can’t say,” she laughs.\n\nBut she is less generous when it comes to computers.\n\nWhen Dahl was writing, children entertained themselves outside or, on rainy days, in a book.\n\nSturrock wrote: “Dahl was part of a generation of British children for whom the natural world was a source of immense stimulation and pleasure.”\n\nBut now, his books battle with computer games and tablets.\n\n\"I don’t quite know what he would think but children still have to read,” she said.\n\n“He was very critical of writers writing on computers. He wrote everything by hand in pencil on a yellow legal pad. He felt that there would be no record of the construction of people’s books if they just deleted it on a computer.\"\n\nWhy his legacy lives on\n\n“I think one of the fascinating things that with Roald, in the archive are all his drafts of all of his children’s stories. They’re all there and you can see what changed from when he started writing to when he finished the book. I think the construction of stories not only for adults, but for children, is wonderful. For teachers it’s a way to show how a story changes so dramatically from the beginning to the end.”\n\n“I think one of the greatest gifts he gave was his books to teachers. They wrote so many letters to him saying they can get a class to behave by promising to read a chapter at the end of class to the children.\n\n“He caught them by their throat with his books and brought them into learning literature. That was so important.”\n\nBut the young naivety of his fans can add to the family’s sense of loss, not even now, years after his death.\n\nChildren still visit his home at Great Missenden, many unaware he died of a blood disease in 1990.\n\n“They come up the lane and think he will be there because to a child an author never dies. They can’t believe it, even though they’re celebrating his 100th birthday.\n\n“They come and look over the wall and ask, ‘Is this Roald Dahl’s house’ and ‘Can I meet him?’. They’re shattered when they’re told he died some time ago.”\n\nAs devastating as that realisation is, the books continue to inspire. On Tuesday, to mark Roald Dahl Day, children across the world will dress up as their favourite Dahl character.\n\nThe nation's favourite book\n\nAs part of the centenary celebrations, a poll was held to vote for the nation’s favourite book. The winner was Matilda.\n\nLiccy said: “It didn’t surprise me but I felt the question was impossible. I am often asked what my favourite book is and it’s a difficult question to answer but I particularly love James and the Giant Peach because I think it’s the survival of this child. The choice of his friends is so important. We’re just lucky if we have five really great friends.”\n\nWhen they returned to Llandaff\n\nLiccy too was born in Llandaff, in 1938. Her family left during the war but returned straight afterwards before eventually moving to Birmingham.\n\nShe remembers little of her early years but like Roald, Tenby was a regular holiday haunt.\n\nBut the couple returned to Wales together twice.\n\nThey returned to Radyr where Roald was “really shocked” there was no sign of the house, just the gatepost.\n\n“I could tell there was a real sadness there. He loved it. It was extraordinary stepping down roads and places that we had both enjoyed as children.\n\nOn their second visit, they took two of Roald’s sisters.\n\n“They loved it,” she recounts.\n\nShe has made numerous trips back since, to promote his work, charity and legacy.\n\nShe describes the Norwegian Church as “that Jewel in the Bay”. “It’s extraordinary how a small building that housed the Norwegian seamen and have them comfort still stands there today.\n\n“I remember when they were first fundraising for the church and it was very important to him. We had a model which was sent to ha and we kept it in the dining room.”"
