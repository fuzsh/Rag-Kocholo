I’m not even certain it’s a true controversy, it’s more like a marketing campaign that increasingly reminds me of that old chestnut about pornography: I know it when I see it.\n\nAnd the recent Roald Dahl fuss is just that. You may have heard that he’s been canceled or censored, or crushed by Big Brother’s jackboot, but that is not true, sadly. Some folks wanted to sell some books, and I don’t know if they’ve succeeded yet, but I’d wager they will. You are free to buy Dahl books that have been pruned and tweaked.\n\nIf you grew up with only three TV networks, you’d remember how ruthlessly they edited movies. If you don’t remember, take my word for it — they’d cut out the nudity and gore in R-rated 80s sex romps and sci-fi thrillers, and I still managed to watch the unedited versions many times.\n\nI do not think re-editing some of Dahl’s stories to suit the stuffy tastes of modern parents was what George Orwell had in mind when he wrote about the power of the state in his classic sci-fi dystopia 1984. I find it mildly scandalous…"
