        "text": "The day marks what would have been the 90th birthday of the biggest-selling children's author of all time - although, as his widow Felicity testifies, he almost certainly wouldn't have forgotten what it's like to be a child. \"I'm sure he wouldn't have, \" she says. \"That was one of his major talents. I don't think that ever dies in a person. If you've got it at 40, you've got it for life.\"\n\nAppropriately, the inspiration for the day came from children who visit the Dahl household, Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, hoping to meet their hero.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't think any of the children believe he's dead, \" says Felicity. \"I still have children coming up the lane and peering over the wall and asking if this is his house and if they can see him. I think they'd worked out that, gosh, he would have been 90, and some of them asked, 'What would he do for a party?' So it grew out of a seed of an idea that children in the UKwould wear yellow (Dahl's favourite colour) or their clothes inside-out or share a book. He loved to celebrate birthdays, but with small treats.\"\n\nAs his long-time principal collaborator and illustrator Quentin Blake, who is taking part in the birthday celebrations with a reading at the Royal National Theatre in London, points out: \"I think Roald Dahl Day is one of those ideas that, once you have had it, you think, how did we ever manage without it? The only sad thing about it is that he isn't here to share it with us. Wouldn't it have been marvellous to hear what he thought about being 90?\" (For the record, Felicity thinks he'd be \"shocked, but he would think it pretty fantastic\". ) It is, of course, a mark of any great author that their work outlives them, but Dahl is a special case. His originality, inventiveness and sense of mischief have always combined to give him an aura of eternal youth, which many young readers, as Felicity has found, continue to find at odds with the fact that he died in 1990.\n\nAmelia Foster is the director of the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Dahl's home town of Great Missenden, which houses the author's entire archive. \"It's very interesting because I think a lot of children think he's still alive, \" she says. \"We get a lot of letters to him and they seem to feel he's someone they can really talk to. I think a lot of people feel he speaks to them quite personally, so they feel they have to write and thank him personally.\"\n\nThis timelessness is partly because Dahl was always careful to consider life from a child's point of view. As he put it: \"If you want to remember what it's like to live in a child's world, you've got to get down on your hands and knees and live like that for a week. You'll find you have to look up at all these giants around you who are always telling you what to do and what not to do.\"\n\nThe arthritic consequences of doing so were by all accounts worth it. They gave the world the everlasting gobstopper and the new language of Gobblefunk, to name just two of his flights of fancy, thereby firing imaginations young and old.\n\nAs Foster recalls: \"I think, when I was reading him as a child, I thought, 'Here's an adult who hasn't forgotten what it's like to be a child, ' and I think a lot of adults grow up not wanting to be one of those who do forget.\" So we have the dark and magical world of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the wickedly grotesque realm of The Witches and the poor personal hygiene of The Twits, each as deliciously repulsive as it is humorous. As Foster says: \"The plots are so fun, but he's not afraid of showing the darker side of life\".\n\nFelicity's favourite book - though only, one suspects, because she is so often asked to choose one - is James and the Giant Peach. \"I have a little bit of favouritism towards it, \" she says. \"I just think that little fellow faces adversity and wins with a great bunch of friends, unusual friends, and I think in life friends pull you through those bad moments everybody has.\"\n\nDahl is chiefly remembered for his children's fiction, but his writing career began in non-fiction. After leaving Repton public school, he eschewed university for the Public Schools Exploring Society's expedition to Newfoundland. Upon its completion, he joined Shell as a salesman in Dar es Salaam. When he was 23, the Second World War broke out and he signed up for the Royal Air Force, which resulted in a posting to Washington. While there, he was asked by the writer CS Forester, who created Captain Hornblower, to write about his wartime experiences. His memoir was published in serial form in August 1942 and Dahl's writing career was under way.\n\nHis first children's book, The Gremlins, followed in 1943, although he was never particularly fond of it and didn't take the form seriously until, around two decades later, he had children of his own. A great many of his stories for adults and children were written in a hut at the bottom of the garden of Gipsy House.\n\nHe sat on an armchair, inherited from his mother, with a tartan rug over his legs and a writing board propped on top. He wrote longhand, with a pencil, for a couple of hours in the morning, then took a break for lunch and a gin and tonic. Another couple of hours of writing followed in the late afternoon. \"I am a disciplined writer, \" he said. \"I don't think any writer works particularly long hours because he can't. He becomes inefficient.\"\n\nHe was also prolific. The museum holds 104 boxes of material, including the drafts of each of his works, his story-ideas book and his personal correspondence. Visitors can read the different endings to Matilda and The BFG (in one draft, Sophie dies).\n\nFoster finds that children are as interested in these potentially devastating revelations as they are in his life story. \"They enjoy sitting in the replica hut and imagining him writing The BFG or Charlie the Chocolate Factory, \" she says. \"They like reading his school reports and the letters he wrote to his mum as a child. They especially love seeing the BFG sandal - the one he wore on holiday in Norway and sent to Quentin Blake because he wanted the BFG's own sandal to look just like it.\"Although his Tales of the Unexpected stories are well known, many adults are surprised to learn that Dahl wrote the screenplay for the Bond film You Only Live Twice and the screenplay of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, while visitors of all ages find that his life was as interesting as his work.\"Although he had a lot of success in his life, he also had a lot of tragedy, \" says Foster. \"His son, Theo, was brain-damaged\n\nafter a taxi hit his pram in New York. His eldest daughter, Olivia, died of measles at the age of seven, which was an echo of what happened to him as a child as his eldest sister died of appendicitis when she was the same age. His first wife had a series of strokes when she was pregnant with their fifth child. People are quite amazed by the difficult things in his life.\"Dahl's first wife was the actress Patricia Neal, whom he married in 1953. They had five children, Olivia, Theo, Tessa, Ophelia and Lucy. Dahl said that if he had not had children, he would not have written for them. As Ophelia wrote of her father in The Roald Dahl Treasury: \"Every evening after my sister Lucy and I had gone to bed, my father would walk slowly up the stairs, his bones creaking louder than the staircase, to tell us a story. I can see him now, leaning against the wall of our bedroom with his hands in his pockets,\n\nlooking into the distance, reaching into his imagination.\"Dahl met Felicity in 1972 and they were married in 1983. The Roald Dahl museum was Felicity's idea and, constantly surrounded by her husband's legacy, she often finds herself empathising with those children who feel he is very much alive. \"It's enormously comforting to me, as his widow, and it's been an enormous help in handling his death because I've been put to work in a wonderful way of being able to, I suppose, help keep him alive. That's the extraordinary thing that was realised after he died - how many areas he influenced. One of the things I have been proud of and enjoyed doing is converting Revolting Rhymes into a musical, which was performed in Edinburgh.\" THE Dahl legacy takes many forms, and it's the job of Dahl and Dahl, the literary estate, to manage them all. Individuals and companies regularly approach the estate for\n\ncopyright permission. While the recent Tim Burton remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a very high-profile example, numerous other requests are received every day. Dominic Gregory is one of those tasked with sorting through them.\"We make sure that things are done in a way Roald would feel happy with, \" he says. \"We don't have to go looking for projects because he's so popular. People come to us. It's really just a mark of how Roald continues to be this evergreen life that people are so enthusiastic about.\"The estate followed the production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory through every stage, with Gregory personally approving each item of merchandise proposed by the film studio. Though they have a firm policy only to work with people who understand Dahl and his work, they rarely have to reject proposals out of hand.\"Unless it's been a completely insane idea, \" says Gregory.\n\n\"If someone comes to us with an idea that feels wildly inappropriate for kids, we very politely show them the door.\" What's remarkable is that, in spite of recent dramatic changes in children's lives, not least in technology, Dahl's work continues to be in demand.\"The world and children's literature have changed a lot since he died, \" says Gregory. \"But I think he started and is part of that change. He was the first mega children's author of modern children's literature. In some respects, he would probably be quite bemused by what children's literature has become, but would be thrilled to know he is still Puffin's best-selling children's author and that, with the Philip Pullmans and JK Rowlings, such quality was being produced for children. He wasn't a writer who wanted it all for himself. He felt kids deserved good writing.\" Roald Dahl Day: a date for your diary Controversial, outspoken\n\nand always entertaining, Roald Dahl is one of the world's favourite storytellers.
