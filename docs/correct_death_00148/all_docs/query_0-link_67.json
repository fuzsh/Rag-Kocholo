        "text": "Background\n\nRoald Dahl is undeniably one of the best children’s storytellers. His inventive tales and unique style of narrating contributed to his very successful writing career. Dahl was born in the Llandaff district of Cardiff — the capital of Wales — in the U.K. He was the son of wealthy Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl. His father worked as a shipbroker who migrated to the U.K. from Norway in the 1880s. Dahl started his schooling at The Cathedral School, Llandaff, and later transferred to St. Peter’s boarding school in Weston. He then enrolled at Repton School, a renowned British public school in Derbyshire, and graduated from there after five years of education.\n\nDahl left a lasting impact on his readers with his tales. He wrote a story for “The Saturday Evening Post” titled “A Piece of Cake” in 1942, which was changed at the time of its publication to “Shot down over Libya”, where he recounts his experiences as an R.A.F. fighter pilot. This was his foremost work as a writer. His exceptional career as a children’s author started in 1943 when he published his first book “The Gremlins” for Walt Disney Productions. The story was anticipated to be made into a film, but the project didn’t come through. Dahl enjoyed writing for children and adults and made a successful career in both. He wrote more than 60 stories intended for mature readers, such as “Someone like You” (1953), and “Kiss Kiss” (1959); the former made him a bestseller author. Dahl’s focus then shifted to children’s stories above all else, and his distinctive writing style speaks for itself, even to readers today. His children’s stories are best known for having cruel and vile adult villains that are against the sweet and kind child protagonists. Dahl wrote some of the most cherished children’s stories of all time, such as “James and the Giant Peach” (1961), “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” (1964), “Fantastic Mr. Fox” (1970), “The B.F.G.” (1982), and “Matilda” (1988), to name but a few.\n\nDahl married twice during his lifetime. His first marriage was to an American actress named Patricia Neal and lasted 30 years. They had five children together. Dahl and Neal were divorced in 1983, and he remarried Felicity d’Abreu Crosland the same year. His second marriage lasted until his demise in 1990. Dahl lived an extraordinary life. He served as a World War II fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force; he also served as an air attaché in Washington D.C. following his plane’s crash landing, which brought him serious injuries. Aside from publishing stories, Dahl also wrote screenplays and scripts for popular films like “You Only Live Twice” (1967), and “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” (1968). He passed away at the age of 74, on November 23, 1990, in Oxford, after suffering from blood cancer. He has left an everlasting impact on his readers and admirers and continues to receive love in the form of flowers and toys sent to his resting place by his young fans."
