        "text": "Whether it's the Fantastic Mr Fox or George's Marvellous Medicine, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or The BFG, everyone has a favourite Roald Dahl book.\n\nSeptember would have been the month Roald Dahl celebrated his birthday, and to mark the achievements of the great story teller special events are centred around the actual day of his birth on September 13.\n\nRoald Dahl Day is a chance to dress up as your favourite character and throw a party, whether at home or at school.\n\nBorn in Llandaff, Wales, on September 13, 1916, many of his younger memories became inspiration for later stories - at one boarding school he had the chance to trial chocolate bars ...

But in September 1940 he suffered serious injuries after crash landing in the desert and later went on to supply intelligence to MI6.\n\nThe release of the books he would become so famous for came later, starting in the 1960s.\n\nDid you know Roald Dahl also wrote screenplays - for the James Bond classic You Only Live Twice and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? It wasn't just children's books either, novels for adults were equally as popular.\n\nRoald Dahl died on November 23, 1990, aged 74. His books were published right up until his death and posthumously.\n\nFind out how much you know about the fantastic wordsmith..."
