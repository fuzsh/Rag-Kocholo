        "text": "A reserved Theo Dahl happily bags groceries at Wynn's Market in downtown Naples, talking in his proper British accent.\n\nHe doesn't need to work there, but he wants to do it.\n\nEvery once in a while customers do a double-take after recognizing his last name — or maybe his face — and figuring out his ties to one of the world's most famous authors of children's books.\n\nTheo, 56, is the only son of Roald Dahl (as in the Dahl who wrote such well-loved stories as \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" \"Matilda,\" \"James and the Giant Peach\" and \"The BFG,\" which hit the big screen in July as a film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg).\n\nMore than 250 million copies of Roald's books have sold worldwide. He's considered a must-read for kids by parents and teachers alike. None of that has gone to the head of his son, who lives a quiet life with his wife, Madeleine, and their 11-year old daughter Alexa in North Naples.\n\n\"We try and keep a low profile,\" he said.\n\nAsked why he bags groceries, Theo said, \"I like to work, period. I've always worked. I like to keep busy.\"\n\nThen his sense of humor shows itself. \"It's not the discount. It's not the discount at all,\" he quipped.\n\nHis wife has another theory about why Theo works at Wynn's.\n\n\"He has lobster salad and I've never seen a paycheck,\" she said with a laugh. \"God bless.\"\n\nYou won't find Theo at Wynn's this week, as he and his wife celebrate what would have been Roald Dahl's 100th birthday on Sept. 13 in England, along with the novelist's throngs of fans in his home country. The Dahls' harried schedule includes visits to Roald's gravesite, several museums and the City of the Unexpected — described as \"the biggest arts event ever to happen on the streets of Cardiff.\"\n\nThe couple's adventures will include everything from a high tea at Aqua Shard in London to a dinner party with \"The Twits,\" Roald's most disgusting characters who promise to be the \"worst hosts ever,\" at The Vaults in Waterloo. The adventures will start in the village of Great Missenden in the heart of the Buckinghamshire countryside, about 20 miles northwest of London, where Roald lived and wrote for more than 35 years.\n\nThe Dahls usually visit England every year for Roald Dahl Day, held on the great storyteller's birthday. But this visit will be more special because this year marks such a milestone in cultural history.\n\n\"I wouldn't miss it. No. It has been in the works for over a year or more,\" Theo said.\n\nThe centenary anniversary has triggered a year-long celebration not just in the United Kingdom but in the United States. Although Roald Day is celebrated in the U.S., Theo said his father doesn't get as much attention here as he should. Still, he appreciates that Roald's legacy lives on through his books.\n\n\"They never take him out of the bookstores. They are still going strong after all these years,\" Theo said.\n\nRoald was also a short story writer, poet, screenwriter and fighter pilot. He died on Nov. 23, 1990, of a blood disease. He was 74.\n\nIn his writings, Roald invented almost 300 funny words and phrases, such as whizpopping (farting) and delumptious (a combination of delicious and scrumptious).\n\nAsked if he likes to write, Theo shook his head from side to side and looked a little sad.\n\n\"I wish I could. That's something you got to know,\" he said.\n\nThe fact that Theo is living a normal life in North Naples seems almost unimaginable. When he was just 4 months old, a taxi hit his pram as his nanny crossed the street in New York City. The accident sent Theo and his carriage flying 40 feet in the air, leaving him brain damaged. He underwent several surgeries to drain extra fluid from his brain, leading his father to invent a better device to combat the medical condition, known as hydrocephalus.\n\n\"I was way, way, way too young,\" he said. \"I don't remember a thing.\"\n\nTheo lived in the house he grew up in with his parents for more than 30 years and he didn't meet his wife until after his father died. He said his dad would have been surprised to see him move to the U.S., marry and have a daughter.\n\nTheo's sister, who was living in Captiva, introduced him to Madeleine when he was down here visiting in 1991. The couple hit it off, but their relationship faced resistance from some of his family members who questioned her intentions. They called off one engagement but, after feeling lost without each other, they reunited a few years later and married in 1995.\n\n\"Together we conquer,\" Madeleine said.\n\nTheo, she said, is the nicest man she's ever met. She describes him as her best buddy and, without hesitation, he agrees. They're opposites in many ways. He's the quieter one, she's the more talkative, colorful one, which he loves about her.\n\nMadeleine's personality shines through inside their home, which looks like something out of a fairy tale, from its floral pink and green couches in the sitting room to its pink and green checkered ceiling in the eating area near the kitchen.\n\n\"I do whimsical,\" she said. \"I do special. It's a happy life. It's very happy.\"\n\nThere is an extra-special room in the house known as \"Dahl Land.\" It's dedicated to Theo's father. Inside you'll find the first edition of every book Roald wrote and much more, including his books printed in different languages, a portrait of a younger Roald, black and white photos of him with his children and Academy Award-winning actress wife Patricia Neal, pictures of the family's modest home the Gipsy House, plastic Wonka bars used in the \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" movie based on Roald's book, and figurines of Roald's characters, including the BFG (Big Friendly Giant).\n\nTheo speaks fondly of his father. He remembers his dad taking him to school and playing golf and conkers with him. (In conkers, players hold a seed threaded onto a piece of string and take turns striking each other's conker until one breaks.)\n\nSome of Theo's most treasured memories are of his dad's bedtime stories, which at times could be a bit scary. He recalls his father climbing up a ladder to reach a window so he could scare Theo and his sisters. He also remembers the many hours his dad spent alone in his writing hut, specially built for him in his garden.\n\nTheo said the book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was dedicated to him. He and his father shared a love of chocolate. One of Theo's favorites is British Maltesers, similar to American Whoppers. As he ate a bag on the couch on Friday, he said he was happy to find them in the ethnic aisle of the nearby grocery store.\n\nDuring visits to England, Theo stocks up on his other favorite candy there, bringing a suitcase full of it home duty-free.\n\nTheo doesn't remember much about his family's tragedies, including the death of his oldest sister from measles or his mother's three massive strokes.\n\nAlexa, Theo's only child, doesn't seem to be fazed by the fame of her grandfather, whom she'll never have the chance to meet. She's read his books for school, and she once made a likeness of him from supplies she found in the house for a school project (she got an A+). While the sixth-grader likes to read, horses are her passion.\n\nWhat Theo wants most for his daughter is for her to be a good person, to live her life to the fullest and to find the \"right man to marry in due course,\" he said.\n\nAlmost every year since 2007, the Dahls have hosted a Roald Dahl Day at Royal Palm Academy, where their daughter goes to school. They held the last one in January to promote literacy, with a carnival theme. They purchased a copy of \"The BFG\" for each of the private Christian school's students and offered to sign them all.\n\n\"As a school we love the literary connection,\" said Scott Baier, Royal Palm's head of school. \"We want to encourage kids to read more.\"\n\nAnd the school loves the Dahls for their bigheartedness. Theo is always so friendly, and Madeleine is a \"lighthearted and wonderful soul,\" Baier said.\n\nWhen “The BFG” hit theaters, the Dahls rented out the Paragon Pavilion theater and invited friends to watch the movie with them. Madeleine was so excited to see the movie but had to miss part of it because her daughter got too scared, so she had to go out in the hall with her.\n\nTheo loved the movie, although it was far different from his father's book. He was sad to see the film come and go so quickly.\n\n\"It's so sad,\" he said. \"I kept looking in the newspaper and only one theater had it. Now it's all out.\""
