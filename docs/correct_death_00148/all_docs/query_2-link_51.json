His mom wanted him to go to Oxford or Cambridge University, but he wanted to work in a faraway place like Africa or China. He then found a job in Tanzania, Africa with the Shell Oil Company where he worked in 1932-1939.\n\n3. Adventure He wanted more adventure so he joined the Royal Air Force in 1939. In Nairobi, Kenya, he trained to become a WWII fighter pilot. When serving in the Mediterranean, he crashed in Alexandria, Egypt. His injuries were really bad: injury to the skull, spine and hip. He had a hip replacement and 2 spinal surgeries. He then went to Washington, D.C. to become an assistant air attaché.\n\n4. Writing While in Washington D.C., he started writing and his first book was The Gremlins in 1942 for Walt Disney. He then wrote more books like Someone Like You in 1953 and Kiss, Kiss in 1959. He married an actress, Patricia Neal in 1961. They were married for 30 years with five children. He read all of his stories to his children and made changes based off of his children’s reactions.\n\n5. Famous Books that are Movies"
