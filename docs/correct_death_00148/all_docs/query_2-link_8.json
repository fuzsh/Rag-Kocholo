        "text": "News\n\nlifestyle\n\nbooks\n\nfeatures\n\nA visit to Roald Dalh's childhood in Cardiff\n\nThis story is from October 2, 2016\n\nA visit to Roald Dalh's childhood in Cardiff\n\nOn Roald Dahl's birth centenary, we peek into the author's childhood.\n\nWhile Cardiff is now known more for footballer Gareth Bale, following his perfor mance in Euro 2016, the Welsh capital is also the birthplace of Roald Dahl. This is also the year that marks the celebrated author's birth centenary. For this occasion, the whole city has been turned on its head to give life to Dahl's popular characters.\n\nWhile most are aware of Dahl's Welsh connections, I pick an unusual trail -tracing Dahl's childhood link to Cardiff. I begin by hopping onto a bus to explore the legacy of one of Wale's literary legends in Landaff, in the outskirts of Cardiff. The 30-minute-bus ride takes me to the center of the leafy suburb where there's little that pertains or speaks of Dahl. I spot the tall Landaff Cathedral at a distance, which is the town's only landmark. I ask around for Dahl's home. Dahl -a best-selling author of children's books such James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The Witches, The BFG, The Twits and George's Marvellous Medicine, along with short stories for adults such as the Tales of the Unexpected -was born in Landaff in 1916.\n\nTy Gwyn (Vila Marie)\n\nLike many of Dahl's stories that have unexpected twists, everyone I checked with pointed at a different direction, during my quest to uncover his childhood. Not many knew about Dahl's Landaff connection. Finally, after a fair bit of wandering around the bylanes of the town, an elderly lady guides me to Ty Gwyn, a quaint-but-freshlypainted house on Fairwater Road.&ldquo;It's the prettiest house on the block, you won't miss it,&ldquo; she added. Her description wasn't far from the truth, and soon I spotted a stunning white house peeking out behind the bushes. The house has an enclosed courtyard, double oak front doors and a traditional three turn staircase leading to a galleried landing. Called Vila Marie then, it is here where Dahl was born. I step inside the compound to check if I could meet Dahl's family. But I'm informed that the house was sold in 2013 for &pound;1.4 million. Many locals believe that experiences in Llandaff were among the pivotal influences that shaped Dahl's imagination that would sell more than 100 million books.\n\nFrom Ty Gwyn, I walk along the road back to the cathedral where I came across Cathedral School, which Dahl first attended in 1923.The all-boys preparatory school overlooked the Cathedral Green, which used to be a stone building during Dahl's student life, and is now a group of houses, located in the centre of Llandaff village.\n\nMrs Pratchett's Sweet\n\nShop At the school gate, I'm directed to a Chinese takeaway along the road.By appearance, it could pass for one of the many Chinese takeaways that dot every town in the UK. On the fa&ccedil;ade of the eatery, I spot a blue plaque that read, `Site of Mrs Pratchett's sweetshop'. It dates back to Dahls's time at Cathedral School, as mentioned in his autobiography, Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984). At the age of eight, he and his four friends (one named Thwaites) were caned by the headmaster for dropping a dead mouse in a jar of gob stoppers at the local sweet shop, which was owned by a &ldquo;mean and loathsome&ldquo; old woman called Mrs Pratchett. I craved to indulge in some Gobstoppers, Strawberry Bonbons and Tonsil Ticklers that must've caught Dahl's fancy at the sweet shop on Llandaff High Street.I was disheartened to find that the menu at the Great Wall Chinese Takeaway, which occupies the space at present, had a completely different offering.\n\nElmtree House School\n\nTaking me a few years back in time is the next stop on the Dahl trail.It's the Elmtree House School, where Dahl attended kindergarten.This is now a private house on Palace Road, so Dahl's fans are requested to respect the family's privacy. When Dahl lived in Cardiff, this was a pre-preparatory school. He attended the institution, along with his sisters Alfhild, Else and Asta. In Boy, he notes that it's &ldquo;astonishing how little one remembers&ldquo; of his early years. But what did stay with him was the fact that it was here that he learnt to tie his shoelaces, the journeys to and from school and even the &ldquo;excitement&ldquo; of a new tricycle.\n\nI can only imagine Dahl as a child, riding across the steep pavements on his tricycle. &ldquo;I can remember oh so vividly how the two of us [his eldest sister] used to go racing at enormous tricycle speeds down the middle of the road. I do have a blurred memory of sitting on the stairs and trying over and over again to tie one of my shoelaces, but that is all that comes back to me at this distance of the school itself,&ldquo; Dahl said in his autobiography which states that he left this school at the age of seven.\n\nCumberland Lodge\n\nI walk back towards the bus stop since I can hardly spot anyone to ask for directions. It begins to drizzle and joggers with headphones race past. An old man walking his Cocker Spaniel stops and enquires if I need help. &ldquo;Roald Dahl, Cumberland Lodge,&ldquo;I ask. Walk straight down the road, he instructs. After a few minutes, I spot the Howell's School nursery. After struggling to get in on a Sunday, I'm told that this is the location that once used to be Cumberland Lodge. In February 1920, Dahl's older sister Astri died at the age of seven from an infection following a trying struggle with appendix. A few weeks later, his father, Harald passed away as well. In Boy, Dahl recounts: &ldquo;[Astri's] sudden death left him literally speechless for days afterwards. He was so overwhelmed with grief that when he himself went down with pneumonia a month or so afterwards, he did not much care whether he lived or died.&ldquo; At the time of her husband's death, Sofie was pregnant and already had five children. It was then that she moved the family back to Llandaff to a smaller home called Cumberland Lodge. He describes the house as a &ldquo;medium-sized suburban villa&ldquo;.\n\nLandaff Cathedral And Hill\n\nAs I head back, I decide to check out the town's most impressive building -one that lends its name to the town itself, Landaff Cathedral. The Anglican cathedral was frequented by Dahl as a kid on his way to school. The huge cathedral door was shut and there was no one around. As I was about to walk away, the door squeaked and I turned around to see the caretaker greeting me with a welcoming smile. He pointed me to the lush green fields towards the west, where Dahl cycled. I braved the rains to walk through a dense cover of trees. In Boy, he recounts being very impressed by a certain 12-year-old boy free wheeling on his bicycle down this hill. The cyclist was pedalling backwards with no hands on the 8 handlebars. The seven-year-old witness to this event vowed that one day he would also cycle down the steep hill the same way.\n\nNational Museum\n\nMy next stop is the National Museum in Cardiff, where I got acquainted with the works of Quentin Blake, best known for his illustrations in Roald Dahl's books. The exhibition showed the origins of some of Blake's most iconic and popular creations including The Twits and Danny, the Champion of the World. His first roughs sketches and storyboards, many of which were never made public, were on display.\n\nNorwegian Church\n\nDahl was born to Norwegian parents and was christened at the Norwegian church, which affords spectacular sights of the Cardiff Bay. The bay happens to be Cardiff's most buzzing and scenic location, with a myriad of caf&eacute;s. I spotted the church (now called the Norwegian Church Arts Centre) from a distance, located at the tip of the pier.The Roald Dahl gallery upstairs has on display works by local artists. Along the quay is Roald Dahl Pass, an open space that's home to Wales Millennium Centre. Not too far from here is where nine-year-old Dahl would set off for boarding school in Weston-super-Mare across the Bristol Channel, travelling from Cardiff Docks via an old steamer.\n\nWhile in Cardiff Bay, I couldn't help but walk through the Roald Dahl Plass. It was in 2002 that this plaza was renamed from the Oval Basin in honour of the author.The plaza is home to huge events in its own right, but when isn't hosting any events, it is the entrance to two iconic city buildings -the Senedd and Wales Millennium Centre. At the Millennium Center, you can see The Wondercrump World of Roald Dahl -and interactive exhibition of Dahl's works.\n\nIn Boy, he says: &ldquo;On a clear day, you can stand on the esplanade at Weston and look across the fifteen or so miles of water and see the coast of Wales lying pale and milky on the horizon.&ldquo;\n\nLicking Cadawalader's, the Welsh coffee and ice-cream chain's bubblegum ice-cream, I try to visualise what Dahl saw. It's not a clear day and I can barely see the boats at a distance against the setting sun. This scenic sight at Cardiff Bay seems like a perfect way to conclude my Dahl trail which was as surreal as his works.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nHelly Shah's adorable pics\n\nEntertainment\n\nâ10 captivating red-coloured birds â\n\nLifestyle\n\nMushy pics of telly couple Arjun Bijlani and Neha Swami\n\ntv\n\nâ10 habits highly obedient kids are taught earlyâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nâSreeleela impresses with classic elegance in traditional outfitsâ\n\nEntertainment\n\nPreity Zinta takes Paris by storm with her breathtaking look in an ombre gown\n\nLifestyle\n\nâPreity Zinta stuns in timeless fashion looking ever-youthful â\n\nEntertainment\n\nâIn Pics: Elegant looks of Shriya Saranâ\n\nEntertainment\n\nFrom Sonakshi-Zaheer to Dharmendra-Hema: Bollywood celebs who chose registered marriages\n\nEntertainment"
