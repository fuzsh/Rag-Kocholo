        "text": "The Old Fogies are not fair weather travellers but take any opportunity to travel all through the year. So although the temperatures were dropping we made our way to Aylesbury which is the county town of Buckinghamshire. Located about one hour from London by train, Aylesbury is part of a wide range of towns that make up the Chilterns and other areas of natural beauty in a part of England that are often overlooked by visitors.\n\nDue to its relative high position in the landscape, Aylesbury has been occupied since at least the early 4th century BC, The area became a Saxon stronghold from the 6th century and was the burial place of Saint Osgyth, whose shrine attracted pilgrims. The Early English parish church of St. Mary could well have been built on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon church, St Mary Church still stands proudly above the town although it has been changed and repaired over the centuries.\n\nAylesbury was declared the new county town of Buckinghamshire in 1529 by King Henry VIII, Aylesbury Manor was among the many properties belonging to Thomas Boleyn, the father of Anne Boleyn. Like many places, the plague decimated the population in the 17th century and was the scene of fighting in the English Civil War.\n\nAylesbury became famous for its ducks which became a major industry in the 18th and 19th century, the Aylesbury duck was bred mainly for its meat and white feathers. The opening of a railway to Aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to the markets of London, and duck rearing became highly profitable. The Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms. It is a measure of how tastes change, the ducks and swans near the canal are not likely to be on anyone’s menu\n\nThe starting point exploring for visitors to the town is the attractive market square with its cobbled areas , clock tower and surrounded by interesting buildings. Two of the grandest buildings are the old Aylesbury Town Hall and Aylesbury Crown Court where the criminals responsible for the Great Train Robbery in 1963 were sentenced.\n\nTo the north of the square is the sign for the King’s Head, the inn is one of the most historic in the area, The King’s Head is one of the oldest public houses with a coaching yard in the south of England. It is Grade II Listed Building. The oldest part of the current building is from the 15th-century, the cellars are much older, dating back to the 13th century. It is one of the few public houses that is owned by the National Trust. After a number of years serving as a hotel as part of the Rothschild business empire, the property was donated to the National Trust in 1925.\n\nSo far, so traditional but there is a surprise under the arches of the old Town Hall, coming out of the wall is a sculpture celebrating the various guises of David Bowie. It seems that Aylesbury had a live music nightclub in Aylesbury later called the Friars’ Club in 1969 which in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s hosted many of the top artists of the time, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Otis Redding, the Clash, Hawkwind, Queen, Genesis, U2, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Marillion & the Ramones.\n\nCarrying on walking and you end up in the more ‘modern’ Aylesbury with ‘The Exchange’ with restaurants and Odeon cinema.\n\nWalking further on you are facing the impressive £42 million Aylesbury Waterside Theatre with 1,200-seat auditorium which opened in 2010.\n\nNear the theatre is a sculpture of a familiar face, comedian and actor Ronnie Barker began his acting career in the town in the late 1940s and in 2010, a bronze statue of him was unveiled by actor David Jason and Barker’s one time co-star Ronnie Corbett.\n\nNear to Aylesbury is Great Missenden which was the home of author Roald Dahl from 1954 until his death in 1990, Aylesbury also celebrates the author’s life with the Roald Dahl Children’s Gallery which is within the Buckinghamshire County Museum.\n\nThe museum is part of the ‘old town’ near the church with a series of streets with interesting old buildings twisting and turning down the hill.\n\nAylesbury population has grown from 28,000 in the 1960s to almost 72,000 in the 21st century, part of this growth is that the town is an attractive ‘commuter belt’ with easy access to London. To cater for this growth, the town has two main shopping centres and plenty of retail parks around the outskirts of the town. Located within the town’s urban area is the famous Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the hospital’s National Spinal Injuries Centre is one of the largest specialist spinal units in the world, and the pioneering rehabilitation work carried out there by Sir Ludwig Guttmann led to the development of the Paralympic Games.\n\nAylesbury, like many English market towns, saw many old buildings demolished in the 1950s/1960s to make way for new retail areas. This is why the towns are often a mix of old and new and Aylesbury follows this pattern. Standing like a sentinel over the town is the 1960s County Tower, the centre of county power for decades.\n\nThe town has more than enough to keep visitors entertained for a day or two and provides a useful base to explore some of the attractive towns and villages in the area. The town has plenty of old pubs, restaurants and bars to explore with shopping ranging from chains to independents. In the Market square, Big Al’s snack bar is a bit of a local institution serving the local population for over 30 years.\n\nOld Fogies Travels are the adventures of two elderly Londoners (The Old Fogies) as they explore their home town and travel around the world looking out for the ordinary, strange, unusual and absurd."
