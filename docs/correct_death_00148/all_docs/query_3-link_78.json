        "text": "You know you’ve read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\n\nPaul Sweeney\n\nBooks have a unique way of stopping time in a particular moment and saying: Let’s not forget this.\n\nDave Eggers\n\nWhen I look back, I am so impressed again with the life-giving power of literature. If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of myself in the world, I would do that again by reading, just as I did when I was young.\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nNever give up on a child who is struggling to read. With the right help, they can overcome any obstacle.\n\nDr. Timothy Shanahan, reading expert\n\nBooks to the ceiling, books to the sky, my pile of books is a mile high. How I love them! How I need them! I’ll have a long beard by the time I read them.\n\nArnold Lobel\n\nLet children read whatever they want and then talk about it with them. If parents and kids can talk together, we won't have as much censorship because we won't have as much fear.\n\nJudy Blume\n\nWhat an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person ...\n\nCarl Sagan\n\nI feel the need of reading. It is a loss to a man not to have grown up among books.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nRead, read, read. Read everything — trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You’ll absorb it. Then write. If it is good, you’ll find out. If it's not, throw it out the window.\n\nWilliam Faulkner\n\nRule number one is to write every day because writing’s like everything else you do. The more you do it, the better you’re going to get at it.\n\nChristopher Paul Curtis\n\nGive weather reports. It helps the reality of a scene if foghorns are blowing or kites are in the sky on a windy afternoon or the day’s so hot wallpaper is peeling off the walls.\n\nSid Fleischman\n\nThe difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.\n\nMark Twain\n\nIdeas are the cheapest part of the writing. They are free! The hard part is what you do with the ideas you have gathered.\n\nJane Yolen\n\nRead, because that’s the way you learn how the language works. That’s the way you learn about emotion, on paper. That’s how you find out how stories are fastened, by reading and reading and reading.\n\nKatherine Paterson\n\nThis morning I took out a comma, and this afternoon I put it back again.\n\nOscar Wilde\n\nWhen you catch an adjective, kill it. No I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them — then the rest will be valuable.\n\nMark Twain\n\nThe first draft is a skeleton .… just bare bones. The rest of the story comes later with revising.\n\nJudy Blume\n\nIf you want to write, you should pay attention to people — everybody has a story — and listen to people when they talk.\n\nKate DiCamillo\n\nReading should not be presented to children as a chore or duty. It should be offered to them as a precious gift.\n\nKate DiCamillo\n\nWhen I say to a parent, “read to a child,” I don't want it to sound like medicine. I want it to sound like chocolate.\n\nMem Fox\n\nYou know you’ve read a good book when you turn the last page and feel a little as if you have lost a friend.\n\nPaul Sweeney\n\nTo learn to read is to light a fire; every syllable that is spelled out is a spark.\n\nVictor Hugo, Les Miserables\n\nThe man who does not read good books is no better than the man who can't.\n\nMark Twain\n\nYou may have tangible wealth untold. Caskets of jewels and coffers of gold. Richer than I you can never be — I had a mother who read to me.\n\nStrickland Gillilan\n\nOutside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.\n\nGroucho Marx\n\nSo please, oh PLEASE, we beg, we pray, go throw your TV set away. And in its place you can install, a lovely bookshelf on the wall.\n\nRoald Dahl"
