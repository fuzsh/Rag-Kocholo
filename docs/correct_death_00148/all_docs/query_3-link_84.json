        "text": "The Fine & Rare Wines auction on 12 December at Bonhams San Francisco, which featured the collection of Dr. Maurice Galante, fetched $1.3 million auction. The 909-lot auction was led by a case of six magnums of 1970 Romanée-Conti, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, which achieved $53,550.\n\nThe celebrated Romanée-Conti was a favourite wine of the beloved author, Roald Dahl. In My Uncle Oswald, the writer declared: 'Sense for me this perfume! Breathe this bouquet! Taste it! Drink it! But never try to describe it! Impossible to give an account of such a delicacy with words!'\n\nThe top lot came from the estate of San Francisco surgeon, Dr. Maurice Galante, an avid collector of wines from several regions. All of Dr. Galante's bottles were stored in an underground cellar at his home in San Francisco. His collection also included 11 bottles of 1959 Château Haut-Brion, which sold for $7,140, and six bottles of 1976 Krug Vintage Champagne, which made $5,355.\n\nElsewhere, three bottles of 2005 Romanée-Conti achieved $35,700, 12 bottles of 1993 La Tâche made $26,180, and 11 bottles of 1990 Richebourg sold for $26,180. Selections from Bordeaux included six bottles of 2000 Château Pétrus, which sold for $23,800, and six bottles of 2000 Château Lafleur, which brought $9,520.\n\nThe next auction of Fine & Rare Wines in the U.S. will take place on 20 March 2015 at Bonhams San Francisco.\n\nNOTES FOR EDITORS\n\nBonhams, founded in 1793, is one of the world's largest auctioneers of fine art and antiques.
