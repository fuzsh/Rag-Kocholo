        "text": "The charming village of Great Missenden, once the home of renowned author Roald Dahl, has been crowned one of the most stylish places to reside. With its idyllic landscapes, charming lanes and thatched roofs, Great Missenden is the epitome of a traditional British village.\n\nNestled in the Chiltern Hills of Buckinghamshire, between the towns of Amersham and Wendover, this area served as both the residence and workspace for Roald Dahl and currently houses just over 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nAnd now The Mail has dubbed Great Missenden one of the 'most desirable' places to live in the whole of the UK for 2024.\n\nREAD MORE: The beautiful commuter village 33 minutes from London named one of best places to live in 2024\n\nIt even used to be on the Tube's Metropolitan line until the 50s and 60s, when the tracks were electrified and it was decided it would run only as far as Amersham.\n\nLast year, a survey by Furniturebox also named it the most stylish place to live in Buckinghamshire thanks to its architecture, the scenery surrounding it, and its appeal for artists.\n\nA spokesperson for Furniturebox commented: \"Great Missenden is the most stylish place to live in Buckinghamshire. Any of the Bucks locations voted by residents would have been worthy winners and show why it is such a stylish county, loved by artists, filmmakers, and tourists worldwide.\"\n\nIt is interesting how many of the most stylish locations were not the most affluent places in their locality. Good style can be achieved whatever your budget and what marks out Bucks' most stylish places is how they all have a timeless quality achieved over generations by the stylish people living there.\n\n\"That same sense of style is true with furniture and having a good eye for the right piece for your home is far more important than how much money you spend.\"\n\nExploring Great Missenden\n\nFor those who fancy a bit of real-life history, take a wander down iconic streets like Church or High Street where history is etched into every corner. The Saxons once used Great Missenden as a thoroughfare between King Harold's estates in High Wycombe and Queen Elgiva's estate in Chesham.\n\nMissenden Abbey, once an Augustinian monastery founded in 1133, stood until Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. As a key stop on the route from London to the Midlands, historical landmarks like the George Inn and Court House hail from the 15th Century.\n\nBack in Victorian times, the village expanded to serve the increasing number of travellers, boasting twelve inns along High Street and Church Street.\n\nFancy something a bit out of the ordinary?\n\nWhy not try a farm boot camp or an Autumnal Dried Wreath Workshop at Peterley Manor Farm?\n\nThis charming farm hosts a variety of events throughout the year. Alternatively, you could take a leisurely stroll along the nearby Chiltern Hills.\n\nPeterley Manor Farm is also known for its mouth-watering homemade cakes, and brunch and lunch dishes made from locally sourced produce.\n\nJust a stone's throw away from the Roald Dahl Museum, you'll find the New Akash Indian Restaurant, where you can savour authentic Indian cuisine prepared with the freshest ingredients. A short 20-minute walk from the museum and near Great Missenden railway station lies The Nags Head Country Inn and Restaurant.\n\nThis historic gem, dating back to the 15th century, is one of the oldest pubs in the area and offers stunning views of the Chiltern Hills. Not only does it provide accommodation, but it also has a dining option.\n\nIt boasts an extensive wine list and a gin menu.\n\nFor beer lovers, Malt The Brewery, located just up the road from Great Missenden, offers delicious ales brewed right in the heart of The Chilterns. Nearby, you can grab a pizza at Fan Fan Pizza.\n\nGetting there\n\nGreat Missenden is easily accessible from London via a 1hr and 8 minute train ride from Marleybone Station on Chiltern Railways. If you prefer to drive, the journey will take around 1hr and 16 minutes via the A40 - though be aware this route includes tolls."
