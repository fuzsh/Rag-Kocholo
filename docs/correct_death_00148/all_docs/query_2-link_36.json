        "text": "To precise a bit the setting, the protagonist of the book \"The Witches\" is an eight (originally seven) year old boy, unnamed (but clearly inspired by young Roald Dahl), recently orphaned. He had Norwegian parents, but that lived and had a business in England - so he was born in, lived in, and went to school in England. He only went to Norway on Christmas and summer holidays to see his grandmother, the mother of his mother. After the death of his parents in a car accent north of Oslo, he goes to live with his grandmother (an old and massive cigar-smoking woman in her late eighties). She is the one that tells her grandson all about the witches - on top of having herself seen numerous cases of witches due to being a Norwegian woman, she is also a retired witchophile that spent her youth travelling around the globe to find more about witches.\n\nDue to the will of the boy's parents, he goes with his grandmother live in England instead of Norway, and due to the grandmother (never named) developping pneumonia, they decide to go for holidays on a \"healing\" town of the English Southern coast (Bournemouth, where a lot of retired and old folks go due to the \"good and healthy air\" of the area). Note that all the towns I mentionned so far are real, Dahl only uses real places in this book. They reside for the holidays in a seaside hotel, The Magnificent.\n\nA final note about the grandmother - she met a witch as a child. She survived it, but it caused her to lose her thumb, and she was so traumatized by the experience that even today she can't speak of the incident.\n\nUnfortunately for the boy and his grandmother, what they actually ignore is that The Magnificent is the hotel that was selected for the Annual Meeting of the English Witches. The Secret Society of English Witches poses as the RSPCC, the \"Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children\", with the Grand High Witch acting as their Chairman (well, Chairwoman). It is actually a reference to the real life NSPCC, the English charity organization \"National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children\". Dahl actually here wanted to make a social criticism, because he deeply disdained a lot of so called \"charity organizations\" of England, that actually did nothing real or effective to act for the cause they defend.\n\nThe witches have their reunion in the ballroom of the hotel (one witch carefully locks the door of the room with chains to prevent anyone entering during the meeting), and a very telling fact is that when they start selecting chairs for the reunion, the witches immediately chose the last rows, the ones the most far away from the stage, terrified that they are of the Grand High Witch.\n\nThe Grand High Witch appears at first as a young and pretty woman, of maybe twenty-five or twenty-six, and really tiny, roughly four and a half feet tall (1m30). She does not wear a hat (the text does not mention her hair, but the Quentin Blake illustrations represent it as long, dark, straigth), has long black gloves going up to her elbows, and a stylish long black dress falling to the ground. Her voice is very sweet and soft, \"dripping with syrup\" as the Boy describes it.\n\nBut this is only her disguise. Because, like all witches, the Grand High Witch is disguised as a human being. But contrary to the Witches, who are at least humanoid, the Grand High Witch is... much more monstrous. Her pretty face? It is a mask. Probably a magic one, given that it moves in such a way it looks like a real face, but it is a mask - she can detach it by touching it behind the ears. And when she takes it off... let's say her real face is gross, terrifying, abominable. Dahl describes it as crumpled and wizened, shrunken and shrivelled, as if it had been picked in vinegar, and it seems to be rotting away, with a cankered and worm-eaten skin around the edges, in the middle of face, and around the mouth and cheeks. It is said to be so frightful, so horrific, one can't help but be hypnotized, mesmerized by this abominable ugliness. Her eyes are said to have \"the look of serpents\", when they are not outright called \"snake eyes\", brilliant and flashing, never blinking and set very deep in the rotting and worm-eaten face. Her teeth are pointy, and her mouth filled with a pale-blue phlegm. [I am sure you can find easily Blake's illustration of the Grand High Witch.]\n\nShe does not remove her wig, her gloves or her shoes, which actually suggests that there may be things even more horrible underneath. The only indication we have is that her gloved hand is \"bony\" and that her fingers are as \"sharp as a needle\". When she unleashes her true nature, the Grand High Witch voice changes, gaining the \"same hard metallic quality\" as the witch with the snake I mentionned before (hinting that it may be another sign of the witches unnatural nature), except the Grand High Witch has a much louder and harsher voice, that \"rasps, grats, snarls, scraps, shrieks and growls\". Outside of that, the Grand High Witch is noted to have a distinct foreign accent (but that the boy, who is both English and Norwegian and can speak both languages) does not recognize - she rolls loudly and harshly the \"r\" sound, pronounces \"w\" as \"v\", adds randomly \"v\" sounds where they shouldn't be (quietly becomes qvietly) and sometimes replace the \"a\" with \"o\" (and \"was\" becomes \"vos\"). All of that makes her voice even harsher and more guttural it already is."
