        "text": "I am only now discovering the works of Roald Dahl as an adult. One of my favorite films from childhood is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory starring Gene Wilder, but I never dived into the books until I became a grownup. I loved both James and the Giant Peach and Matilda, so I’m excited to keep reading these books. Today, I’m sharing my thoughts on two more from Dahl. First, we have the classic Fantastic Mr. Fox. That’s followed by a collection of true life stories with Boy: Tales of Childhood.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nMr. Fox is a proud husband and father who is trying to get food for his family by stealing from the three local farmers, named Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. The farmers become more and more incensed by their livelihood being taken from them, so they work tirelessly to hunt down the elusive thief. The situation becomes dire as the foxes, as well as the other animals, are starving. But our title character is not called “Fantastic” for nothing. Being cunning and quite brilliant, Mr. Fox develops a scheme to outsmart the farmers and steal enough food for a huge feast. Will he be able to pull off the food haul of the century?\n\nI love Dahl’s writing, as it’s so quirky and fun. Another of his strengths is that he can be so descriptive (important for a children’s writer) that his characters step right out of the pages. The illustrations by Quentin Blake compliment the story beautifully. As typical with his books, there’s the clever protagonist who manages to defeat the horrible adults, in this case represented by the three farmers. While my childlike self enjoyed every moment of this book, my grownup side couldn’t help but feel uneasy about certain aspects of this book. For one, the three farmers are ridiculed based upon being gluttonous and their physical appearances. Also, Mr. Fox is such a fun character that we overlook that he’s glorifying stealing. As an adult, I know better and can enjoy the book, perhaps a testament to the enduing appeal of Dahl’s writing. If you have an opportunity, you should check out the Wes Anderson film version. It’s an incredibly witty expansion of the book and worth watching. Also, I am counting this for the children’s classic category for the Back to the Classics Challenge.\n\nBoy: Tales of Childhood\n\nRoald Dahl’s strengths as a writer come on full display with this wonderful book about his childhood up to age 20. This memoir is filled with humorous, and at times disturbing, anecdotes from the author’s childhood and school days. Beginning with a brief introduction about his grandfather and parents, Dahl discusses the loss of his eldest sister (who was seven at the time) to appendicitis. Within a few weeks, Dahl’s father passed away from pneumonia. The reader is reminded that the year was 1920, a time when antibiotics weren’t readily available and patients succumbed to these illnesses. His mother, faced with this double tragedy and having to raise multiple children, decided to follow her husband’s advice to raise her children in the English school system.\n\nThe majority of the book recounts Dahl’s experiences at various prep and boys’ schools. One of his most favorite memories involved getting to sample so many delicious treats from the local sweets shop: delightful confections such as Humbugs, Strawberry Bonbons, Glacier Mints, Pear Drops, Liquorish Bootlaces, and Gobstoppers. I wonder if these experiences might have influenced one of his stories. The only horror to this dream place was the owner of the shop – a horrid woman who was mean to children (and certainly an influence on his later writings featuring horrid adults). There are some particularly hilarious scenarios shared about Dahl and his friends hatching a plot to teach this mean shopkeeper a lesson, and the aftermath of the seemingly brilliant plan. Some not-so-fond memories center around what happens to boys who cause mischief. Dahl suffered several beatings on his backside with a cane, a practice that would certainly not be practiced in today’s schools. His descriptions of these horrible encounters leave you feeling like it just happened to you.\n\nOther topics explored in this memoir include homesickness, dealing with mean and nasty teachers, as well as some awful medical practices by physicians (anesthetic wasn’t commonly used either). But there are also several heartwarming moments, such as Dahl’s fellow classmates standing up for him and lending support. Throughout the book, we get to see photographs from Dahl’s childhood as well as excerpts from the weekly letters he would send to his mother, all signed “Boy” since he was the only boy in the family, having all sisters. The relationship he has with his mother is explored without being too overly used.\n\nFor anyone wanting a glimpse of the real life behind those remarkable stories Dahl would later write, I highly recommend reading his book.\n\nHave you read either of these books? I’d love to know your thoughts! Let me know with a comment below.\n\nIt was on the first of October in 1988 when a rather special child was revealed to the world. Not quite six years old, this little girl was capable of the most extraordinary things such as reading the complete works of Charles Dickens and rattling off double-digit multiplication problems with ease. While these abilities are quite impressive, I think it is fair to say that her greatest trait is her capacity to thrive despite the obstacles thrown in her path. As we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Matilda, I thought a review of this book would be quite a fitting tribute to a little girl that was without a doubt pure magic.\n\nOf the many wonderful characters born from the mind of Roald Dahl, I would have to place Matilda Wormwood as my favorite (sorry Charlie Bucket). In a room full of adults, she is clearly the most brilliant. This is not a difficult feat considering how most of the adults she encounters (her own parents included) are quite dim-witted and dull. Her father is a used car salesman who delights in taking advantage of his customers. Matilda’s mother is not much better. She leaves her daughter home alone all day so she can go and play Bingo. Matilda has an older brother, but the two are not close at all. One day, Matilda decides she has had enough and makes her first trip to the public library. Although she taught herself how to read, the Wormwood home is sorely lacking in reading material. Matilda quickly finishes the children’s section and asks the librarian for something more challenging.\n\n“So Matilda’s strong young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships on the sea. These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message: You are not alone.”\n\nBy the time she starts school, little Matilda is able to discuss classic authors on a collegiate level. Although encouraged by the kind Miss Honey, Matilda quickly makes an enemy of the school’s headmistress Miss Trunchbull. This beastly woman hates children and takes a sadistic pleasure in making them suffer. One day Miss Trunchbull turns on Matilda, unleashing a power in the little girl she never knew she had.\n\nThis is my first time reading Matilda, and one thing that surprised me was how late in the story Dahl introduces us to the girl’s magical powers. For most of the book, Matilda relies on her intelligence and propensity for pranks when dealing with the grownups in her life. For a book that is mostly remembered for Matilda’s magic, I find it fascinating that it is actually a relatively small part of the story.\n\nAs with all of Roald Dahl’s books, Matilda contains some wonderful messages for both kids and adults. Reading is crucial. Be kind to others. The most important message of all is that children are people too. Dahl is a hero who gives a voice to the often voiceless children in our world. This author teaches us that all children are precious with a multitude of strengths.\n\nThere are a lot of funny moments in this story, such as Matilda’s pranks on her father. However, Dahl also gets quite dark, particularly when Miss Honey is sharing her backstory. Although you have to read between the lines with some of it, there are some rather profound issues happening here. One of the reasons why Dahl is considered one of the greats is that he can insert those dark elements without depleting a story of its charm.\n\nI would be amiss if I did not mention the great illustrator Quentin Blake, whose artwork truly breathes life into the characters. There was never a stronger collaboration between a writer and an illustrator. In honor of Matilda’s thirtieth birthday, Mr. Blake has reimagined Matilda as an adult with some wonderful illustrations of her as an explorer, an astrophysicist, and the head of a library. I have no doubts that she accomplished all of these feats and then some.\n\nMatilda is a fun and enchanting book, the perfect read for a Saturday morning. Whether or not you read it as a child, do yourself a favor and read it as a grownup. Happy Birthday Matilda! Now go and have yourself a piece of yummy chocolate cake.\n\n“Never do anything by halves if you want to get away with it. Be outrageous. Go the whole hog. Make sure everything you do is so completely crazy it’s unbelievable…”\n\nHave you read this book? I’d love to know your thoughts! Sound off with a comment down below.\n\nI hadn’t been feeling well this week, so I needed something extra magical to help make me feel better. Roald Dahl to the rescue! This weekend, I read both George’s Marvelous Medicine and The Magic Finger. Although I wouldn’t rank them as high as James and the Giant Peach, I did enjoy them for Dahl’s witty writing and sense of fun. Both books are two of Dahl’s shortest works as each can be finished in under an hour.\n\nOne Saturday morning, eight-year-old George is left home alone with his grandmother while his mother goes shopping. Unfortunately, his grandmother is one of the most horrid and disgusting people George has ever had the misfortune to know. She is always grouchy and complains way too much. Grandmother is always telling George that he is lazy and giving him terrible advice, like how he should eat cabbage mixed with disgusting bugs! George decides that he has had enough and wants to teach his nasty old grandmother a lesson she will never forget. Rather than give her the usual medicine, the boy runs through the house mixing all manner of household ingredients together to make a very special medicine. The results of George’s fantastic creation are quite surprising!\n\nI quite enjoyed this one. Dahl has a way with words, and several parts of the book had me laughing. The descriptions of the characters are fantastic, and Quentin Blake’s illustrations truly bring this story to life. Roald Dahl stories are all about the empowerment of children over adults. While George is made to be quite clever and imaginative, Dahl makes it clear that he is still just an ordinary boy who likes to get into mischief just like all young children. I remember being a little boy and running around my house mixing different ingredients together to try to make something magical.\n\nAnother aspect of Dahl’s writing that I quite enjoy is how awful the grownups come across. Grandmother is simply awful. When his parents learn about what George has done, his father is quick to have him make the medicine again because it will make the family a fortune because this is how adults think. Of course, some horrible things happen, but they’re handled in a very whimsical manner that few writers like Dahl could accomplish.\n\n“For a few brief moments he had touched with the very tips of his fingers the edge of a magic world.”\n\nNext, we have The Magic Finger. This is a story about a girl who can create magic with her finger when something makes her angry. Her two best friends are brothers Philip and William Gregg who both go hunting with their father. One day, she sees the family shooting at some ducks so she casts a spell on them. By the end, the Gregg family sees the error of their ways and gives up hunting forever.\n\nThis is another story that features a child taking revenge on adults who do horrible and stupid things. Through this unnamed girl, the weak and powerless (the ducks) are able to stand up for themselves. What’s interesting to me about this story is how it serves as a precursor to another beloved Dahl story, Matilda (haven’t read that one, but love the film). Clearly, Dahl expands this idea of a girl with special powers into the later story.\n\nI think these two books, like all of Dahl’s children’s books, remind us about the importance of never losing sight of that sense of wonder. Also, it is important to remember that the voice of a child is always important and should not be overlooked. These lessons should always be remembered, and thank goodness we have Roald Dahl to remind us.\n\n“I put the magic finger on them all.”\n\nHave you read either of these books? I’d love to know your thoughts! Sound off with a comment down below.\n\nMy wife has a collection of almost every Roald Dahl book ever written. I don’t think there’s a living soul out there who has not been influenced one way or another by his extraordinary fiction. To read a Roald Dahl story is to be transported to a magical place where children rule the day and adults are discovered to be incredibly dim. Anything can happen in a Roald Dahl book. One of my fondest childhood memories was watching the beautiful film of Willy Wonka and his amazing chocolate factory. In fact, I still stop and watch it whenever it’s on TV (no disrespect to Depp but Wilder will always be my Wonka). Since I needed a work of children’s fiction for this year’s Back to the Classics challenge, I narrowed my choices down to either Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or James and the Giant Peach. Ultimately, my wife made the final decision on this one so you can thank her for the review which stands before you. For our fourth anniversary, I gave her this lovely fiftieth anniversary edition of the book (the theme was fruit). Reading this book was an amazing experience that made me feel like a child again.\n\nOne of my first thoughts when I started reading was how this book might have influenced one J.K. Rowling (maybe you’ve heard of her). This is the story of James Henry Trotter who is forced to live with his cruel aunts following the tragic death of his parents. If you thought Harry Potter was treated badly by the Dursleys, wait until you read about poor James under the care of his new relatives. James is routinely beaten and is neglected severely. One of Dahl’s trademarks is a tendency to exaggerate the negative qualities of his adult characters, which works to great effect. The descriptions of Aunts Spiker and Sponge are fantastic, so writers of adult works could learn a lot from Dahl. Despite the dark material, the writing is both whimsical and fun. Dahl possessed a strong wit, and writing children’s books was obviously the perfect medium for him.\n\n“There are a whole lot of things in this world of ours you haven’t even started wondering about yet.”\n\nOne day James meets a strange old man who gives him a bag of crocodile tongues that have been boiled with some other ingredients (Dahl was quite twisted). The man tells James to just add water and some hairs from his head. Once he drinks it, the boy will never be miserable again. Of course, things don’t go according to plan. James trips and spills the concoction which attaches itself to the old peach tree in his aunts’ yard. The boy’s life is never the same again as he goes on some fantastic adventures inside the giant peach with his new enlarged insect friends.\n\nI love this group of characters. My favorite was Centipede, a self-proclaimed pest who wears dozens of shoes. The other insect characters are also a lot of fun. There’s Earthworm who is blind and when not annoyed by his friend Centipede is being constantly thrust into danger. Miss Spider is a sweet lady who tells some horror stories about her family that will make you never want to kill another of the eight-legged creatures. Old-Green Grasshopper is the wise one who can play some of the most beautiful music ever heard. There are several other insect characters who don’t get as much screen time which is a shame. I never tired of the fun banter between all of the characters. While adventuring with his new friends, James is placed in multiple predicaments where he had to save everyone. Another strength of Dahl is how he empowers his child characters to do extraordinary things while maintaining a child’s unique view of the world. I never tire of that sense of wonder.\n\nIn the end, I found myself holding a special kinship with young James. As a child, I was often lonely and struggled to make friends. The truth is books were my companions. If an opportunity to fly around in a gigantic peach with some talking insects presented itself, then I would have jumped at the chance. Dahl was more than just a writer. He understood the world can often be a frightening place and how we all need people in our lives who bring meaning. This is why his special brand of magic endures.\n\nI’m really happy to have selected this as my children’s classic. Also, I couldn’t have picked a better edition in order to rekindle my relationship with Roald Dahl. In her introduction, writer Aimee Bender explores how sometimes serious readers are embarrassed to display children’s books with their favorite adult selections. Just remember that there is often more wisdom to be found in a book written for children than in some of the grownup books out there. Personally, I think time spent in childlike pursuits is time well spent. As long as we don’t lose sight of the magic, then maybe we can save ourselves from turning into dim-witted adults.\n\n“Well, maybe it started that way. As a dream, but doesn’t everything. Those buildings. These lights. This whole city. Somebody had to dream about it first. And maybe that is what I did. I dreamed about coming here, but then I did it.”\n\nThis book counts towards two of my challenges for the year. You can track my progress by clicking here.\n\nHave you read this book?
