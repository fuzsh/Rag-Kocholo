It is named the Wade-Dahl-Till valve.\n\nHis favourite writing spot was in his shed- In his garden in Buckinghamshire, Dahl had a shed where he did all his writing on yellow paper using a pencil.\n\nHe created more than 250 new words– Roald Dahl was very creative in coming up with new words. The collection of words, named Gobblefunk, includes the more familiar (for example, Oompa Loompa, scrumdiddlyumptious and snozzcumber) with the completely unusual (such as Frobscottle, Bootbogglers and Gunzleswiped)! Many of these words have entered common usage, and will all be featured in the new Roald Dahl Dictionary from Oxford University Press in 2016.\n\nHe only began writing children’s stories once he had children of his own\n\nHe wrote over 70 stories and books in total-Including 21 children’s picture books, novels & poetry collections as well as over 50 stories for adults.\n\nHe was tall– Roald Dahl was approximately 6’6” tall.\n\nHe was multilingual– Dahl could speak English, Norwegian and Swahili.\n\nHe loved chocolate– As many of his stories indicate, Dahl had a sweet tooth and loved chocolate, however he didn’t like chocolate cake or chocolate ice cream.\n\nHis characters were based on real people- Many of his characters were inspired by people Dahl met in real life.\n\nHe enjoyed photography-Alongside writing, Roald Dahl enjoyed photography and often carried a camera with him.\n\nHe had 5 children- Their names were Olivia, Tessa, Theo, Ophelia and Lucy.\n\nHis birthday is celebrated around the world – Roald Dahl’s birthday, 13th September, is celebrated as Roald Dahl Day by many schools and libraries every year – with the biggest ever celebrations taking place in September 2016 to mark the centenary of his birth!\n\nCheck out our Matilda The Musical Noticeboard\n\nSHARE THIS"
