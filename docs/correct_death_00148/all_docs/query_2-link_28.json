        "text": "For years the yellowing papers and dog-eared notebooks lay untouched in the rather grubby garden shed where Roald Dahl dreamt up his fantastical children's stories.\n\nBut now, for the first time, Dahl's drafts, jottings and letters are being sorted and catalogued, giving fascinating glimpses of the genesis of some of his most popular characters and a fresh insight into the author's mind.\n\nAmong the details which might take Dahl aficionados aback is the revelation that the author first imagined the hero of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a black boy and the piece of fruit in James and the Giant Peach as a huge cherry.\n\nIt has also emerged that Matilda died at the end of an early version of her story rather than living happily ever after, while only at a late stage was the child in The BFG named after Dahl's granddaughter, the model Sophie.\n\nTo the surprise of those friends who thought Dahl quite cavalier about his writing, the paperwork also reveals that he was fastidious, repeatedly reworking his ideas and concerned about every minute detail of the books.\n\nAfter Dahl died in 1990, his family and friends were reluctant to set foot in the hut at the bottom of the garden - approached via a walkway of pleached limes - which had been his very private den.\n\nBut the family has decided that the Dahl archive ought to be a centrepiece of a new centre which is due to be opened next year in the Buckinghamshire village of Great Missenden where Dahl lived. The Â£4m centre, which is expected to attract 40,000 visitors a year, will tell Dahl's life story and include classrooms, reading rooms and interactive displays designed to encourage children and adults to read and write.\n\nThe documents, full of spelling mistakes, crossings out and Dahl's scrawly handwriting, have been moved from the shed - which will be replicated in the centre - into the writer's old snooker room where they are being read and preserved for posterity.\n\nThere have been many surprises, not least the early drafts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which is being made into a new Hollywood film by Tim Burton, director of Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Mars Attacks.\n\nIn a draft thought to have been written in around 1961, six years before it was published in the UK, the story had the politically incorrect title, given the hero's colour, of Charlie's Chocolate Boy.\n\nDuring the tour of Willy Wonka's amazing factory, he becomes covered head to foot in chocolate. Charlie is taken to Wonka's house as a present for his son. He witnesses a burglary and is rewarded with a gift of a sweetshop.\n\nBy the third version the story was much closer to the published version, probably the seventh draft, in which all the children except Charlie, by now a white boy, meet sticky ends.\n\nNotes Dahl made when preparing to write James and the Giant Peach show how he set about realising his characters. He tried to think his way into the mind of the creepy-crawlies who were to inhabit the huge peach. For example, he imagines himself as a worm: \"I can't smell tasty things ... I can only smell the food I like, cabbage, raw meat, celery.\"\n\nHe first imagined the fruit would be a cherry, pushed along a stream by a water boatman.\n\nSophie Dahl was surprised when it was discovered that in an early draft of another of Dahl's most popular books, The BFG, the child who befriends the big friendly giant was a boy called Jodie, rather than a girl named Sophie.\n\nThere was also a shock when an early draft of Matilda was read. In the final version Matilda leaves her horrible parents to live with a nice teacher. But in the early versions she was a terribly unruly girl and died at the book's conclusion.\n\nDahl's \"ideas books\" have also fascinated the archivists. They include vivid descriptions such as \"a face like crumpled brown paper\" and \"a face like an old sea boot\". Some have a tick through them, showing they had been used in a story. Many others could not be found a home.\n\nThe \"ideas books\" also include photographs of interesting faces, including three teenage American murderers, which Dahl presumably thought he might have \"borrowed\" for a character.\n\nOther papers include a factual description of the events leading up to his daughter Olivia's death from encephalitis in 1962 after a bout of measles. Friends believe his way of trying to deal with her death was to record what had happened in a calm, emotionless manner.\n\n'Skilly wonka'\n\nThere is also correspondence between Dahl and an American man called Willy Wonka. The American wanted to know why he had used his name. Dahl replied that the name came from a boomerang-like toy which was invented by his half brother Louis called a \"skilly wonka\".\n\nLetters Dahl addressed to his mother \"Dear Mama\" also cast new light on his life and times, especially the importance he attached to family. In one written from north Africa during the second world war, where he was posted with the RAF and was shot down, he imagines being sent home for treatment. \"They may even send me to England, which wouldn't be a bad thing, would it?\"\n\nIn another he bemoans the lack of information about his sisters. \"I haven't heard that Else's been married yet. Has she?\" His postscript is the rather plaintive: \"Tell Asta she's not allowed to marry until I get home.\" He signs off: \"Lots of love and all, Roald.\"\n\nAmanda Conquy, director of the Dahl literary estate and a longstanding friend of the family, said the archive exposed sides of Dahl's character which he kept hidden during his life, especially his fastidiousness over his writing.\n\nShe said: \"He tended to make light of his work. He didn't like to talk about it and there was nothing of the pained artist about him. The archive shows that in fact he was absolutely painstaking. The archive shows the honing process, the hard graft of writing. He worked very hard at getting it right.\"\n\nGlossed the plot\n\nHow Dahl developed his ideas\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\n\nIn an early version, Charlie was one of 10 children touring Willy Wonka's factory. Charlie finds his way into a boy-sized mould and is covered in chocolate. He is taken back to Wonka's home and placed on the mantelpiece and witnesses a burglary. The thief is caught and Charlie is rewarded with a sweet shop\n\nIn the published version Dahl is more interested in the hunt for the golden tickets that allow children to join the tour as well as the sticky endings all the children except Charlie come to. Some of the children from early versions are cut. The book ends with Charlie being given the chocolate factory\n\nThe BFG\n\nOriginally the child who befriends the big friendly giant is a boy called Jodie. In the published version the child is named after Dahl's granddaughter, Sophie, now a model, actress and author\n\nJames and the Giant Peach\n\nDahl began by conceiving the magical fruit that carries his hero and creepy-crawly friends away as a cherry being pushed sedately along a stream by waterboatmen\n\nBy the final version the cherry has become a peach. The peach rolls over the white cliffs of Dover into the sea and is threatened by sharks before being flown across the globe by 502 seagulls\n\nMatilda\n\nIn early versions the story is a cautionary tale. Matilda is an extremely naughty girl who plays pranks on everyone around her. She dies in melodramatic fashion at the end of the book\n\nSome of the pranks were retained in the published edition. However, there is a happy ending. Matilda, who has supernatural powers, begins a happy life with her favourite teacher, Miss Honey, as her nasty parents flee the police"
