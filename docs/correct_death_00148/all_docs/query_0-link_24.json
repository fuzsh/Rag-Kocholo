        "text": "Roald Dahl Day is marked on 13 September to remember the author who wrote more than 20 children's books, including The Twits, Fantastic Mr Fox and The Witches.\n\nMany of them have been turned into films and even musicals, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda.\n\nHe died on 23 November 1990. Every year, since 13 September 2006 - on what would have been his birthday - there's been a special Roald Dahl Day to celebrate his stories and their characters.\n\nThis year would have been his 107th birthday. So we thought we would share some fantastic facts about his life.\n\nRoald Dahl was incredibly creative and came up with more than 500 new words and character names.\n\nSuch as the Oompa-Loompas and scrumdiddlyumptious from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and snozzcumbers and frobscottle from the BFG.\n\nHe called his language Gobblefunk, and loved to play around with words and invent new ones or meanings.\n\nOxford University Press even created a special Roald Dahl Dictionary, featuring almost 8,000 real and imaginary words which he loved to use.\n\nRoald Dahl spent around four hours every day writing stories from his garden shed.\n\nHe is said to have had a cosy old armchair and a specially designed writing board which would sit on his lap.\n\nHe would also only write his stories using a pencil and yellow paper.\n\nJames and the Giant Peach was almost called James and the Giant Cherry.\n\nIt was changed from a cherry to a peach because Dahl said a peach was \"prettier, bigger and squishier than a cherry\".\n\nHis original idea would have been for the giant cherry to be slowly pushed along a stream by water boatmen.\n\nHowever, this was later changed to a giant peach which falls from the white cliffs of Dover.\n\nMany of the characters and stories created by Roald Dahl were inspired by the people and places around him.\n\nFor example, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was inspired by his childhood.\n\nThe chocolate maker Cadbury's used to taste-test their chocolate bars at Roald's school, and he used to dream that he would invent a new chocolate bar and win praise from Mr Cadbury.\n\nThe foxes' home in Fantastic Mr Fox was inspired by a huge tree which grew outside Roald Dahl's home in the village of Great Missenden, in England.\n\nRoald even named one of the main characters in the BFG after his first grandchild - Sophie."
