Each day on his way to school, Charlie passes the best and biggest chocolate factory in the world, run by the secretive Willy Wonka. When Charlie’s father loses his job, things go from bad to worse. Grandpa Joe tells Charlie that in the past, competitors stole Wonka’s candy-making secrets, and the factory shut down. Later, the factory resumed production, but no one was ever seen entering or leaving. One day, Wonka announces that he has hidden golden tickets in five Wonka chocolate bars, with the prize of a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of Wonka products for each child who finds a ticket. Wonka-mania encircles the globe, and one by one four of the tickets are found. Charlie finds money sticking out of a snowbank and buys himself two Wonka chocolate bars; the second contains the last golden ticket.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, Last Lines Quiz"
