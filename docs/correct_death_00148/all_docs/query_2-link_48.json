        "text": "The pretty little village of Great Missenden has two claims to fame. Missenden Abbey, founded in 1133, served as a monastery for over 400 years until ruined in the Reformation. The ruins were later incorporated into a Georgian mansion, but this was gutted by fire in 1985. Now restored, it functions as a centre for conferences and adult education, and as a wedding and events venue. You can wander into its front entrance, enjoy the views and enquire at reception if the building is free to look around.\n\nAn author's inspiration\n\nIts second claim to fame is as the home of one of the world's best-selling children's authors. Roald Dahl was born in Wales in 1916, to Norwegian parents, and served with distinction in the RAF during World War II. He wrote about his wartime adventures and his first book was published in 1942. His first children's book, The Gremlins, was published a year later. In 1954 he moved to Great Missenden and lived at Gipsy Cottage until his death in 1990. He used Angling Spring Wood as inspiration for Fantastic Mr Fox, and Atkins Wood in Danny the Champion of the World. With such classics as James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, The Witches, The Twits, and The BFG to his name, he is regarded as one of the all-time great children’s storytellers. Dahl also contributed to the screenplays for two Ian Fleming novels, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (creating the creepy 'Childcatcher' character) and You Only Live Twice. He also gained fame for his dark, often macabre, adult short stories, which often included a twist in the tale.\n\nGreat Missenden's High Street will be familiar to readers of Danny the Champion of the World, for the 'Red Pump Garage', featuring two splendid old petrol pumps ('Sorry, out of fuel ever since 8 gallons went over £1…'). And No. 70, Crown House, was the inspiration for Sophie’s 'norphanage' in The BFG. You can pay your respects to the author at the Church of St Peter and St Paul, where he is buried just below the memorial bench in the shade of the trees. In typical Dahl humour, note the concrete footprints of the BFG next to the author’s simple gravestone."
