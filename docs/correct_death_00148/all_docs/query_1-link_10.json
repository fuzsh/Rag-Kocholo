        "text": "The life of Roald Dahl has been celebrated with a \"big hurrah\" in the village where he wrote many of his best-loved books.\n\nThe author lived in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, for 36 years and penned titles including The BFG and Matilda from a hut in his garden.\n\nThe Reverend Canon Rosie Harper led a service celebrating his life.\n\n\"The work of Roald Dahl brought life and energy to the village,\" she said. \"It's going to be a very positive day.\"\n\nCelebrations are taking place around the world to mark 100 years since Dahl was born, external.\n\nThe author moved to Great Missenden in 1954 with his first wife, Patricia Neal, and lived there until his death in 1990.\n\nStories including Fantastic Mr Fox and Danny the Champion of the World drew inspiration from local landmarks or characters.\n\nThe writing hut in which he would spend hours each day has been preserved and is now part of a museum which opened in the village in 2005.\n\nCanon Harper said Dahl, who is buried in the village, \"changed the dynamic\" of what would otherwise would have been a \"sleepy village filled with people who commute to London\".\n\n\"When you come to Great Missenden, you see it's full of children,\" she said."
