A Rare Cancer of the Blood

According to various sources, Roald Dahl died of a rare cancer of the blood called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS is a group of disorders that affect the bone marrow and prevent it from producing enough healthy blood cells. MDS can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, infections, bleeding, and bruising. MDS can also progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a more aggressive type of blood cancer.

The exact cause of MDS is not known, but some factors that may increase the risk include exposure to radiation, chemicals, or certain drugs; smoking; older age; and genetic mutations. There is no cure for MDS, but treatments such as blood transfusions, chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and supportive care can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life.

Roald Dahl was admitted to a hospital in Oxford, England, on November 12, 1990, with an undisclosed infection. He died peacefully in his sleep on November 23, 19904. He was buried in the cemetery at the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England. According to his granddaughter, the family gave him a âsort of Viking funeralâ .
