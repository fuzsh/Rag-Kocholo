        "text": "As part of its digital strategy, the EU wants to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure better conditions for the development and use of this innovative technology. AI can create many benefits, such as better healthcare; safer and cleaner transport; more efficient manufacturing; and cheaper and more sustainable energy.\n\nIn April 2021, the European Commission proposed the first EU regulatory framework for AI. It says that AI systems that can be used in different applications are analysed and classified according to the risk they pose to users. The different risk levels will mean more or less regulation.\n\nAI Act: different rules for different risk levels\n\nThe new rules establish obligations for providers and users depending on the level of risk from artificial intelligence. While many AI systems pose minimal risk, they need to be assessed.\n\nUnacceptable risk\n\nUnacceptable risk AI systems are systems considered a threat to people and will be banned. They include:\n\nCognitive behavioural manipulation of people or specific vulnerable groups: for example voice-activated toys that encourage dangerous behaviour in children\n\nSocial scoring: classifying people based on behaviour, socio-economic status or personal characteristics\n\nBiometric identification and categorisation of people\n\nReal-time and remote biometric identification systems, such as facial recognition\n\nSome exceptions may be allowed for law enforcement purposes. “Real-time” remote biometric identification systems will be allowed in a limited number of serious cases, while “post” remote biometric identification systems, where identification occurs after a significant delay, will be allowed to prosecute serious crimes and only after court approval.\n\nHigh risk\n\nAI systems that negatively affect safety or fundamental rights will be considered high risk and will be divided into two categories:\n\n1) AI systems that are used in products falling under the EU’s product safety legislation. This includes toys, aviation, cars, medical devices and lifts.\n\n2) AI systems falling into specific areas that will have to be registered in an EU database:\n\nManagement and operation of critical infrastructure\n\nEducation and vocational training\n\nEmployment, worker management and access to self-employment\n\nAccess to and enjoyment of essential private services and public services and benefits\n\nLaw enforcement\n\nMigration, asylum and border control management\n\nAssistance in legal interpretation and application of the law.\n\nAll high-risk AI systems will be assessed before being put on the market and also throughout their lifecycle. People will have the right to file complaints about AI systems to designated national authorities.\n\nTransparency requirements\n\nGenerative AI, like ChatGPT, will not be classified as high-risk, but will have to comply with transparency requirements and EU copyright law:\n\nDisclosing that the content was generated by AI\n\nDesigning the model to prevent it from generating illegal content\n\nPublishing summaries of copyrighted data used for training\n\nHigh-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk, such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, would have to undergo thorough evaluations and any serious incidents would have to be reported to the European Commission.\n\nContent that is either generated or modified with the help of AI - images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they come across such content.\n\nSupporting innovation\n\nThe law aims to offer start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises opportunities to develop and train AI models before their release to the general public.\n\nThat is why it requires that national authorities provide companies with a testing environment that simulates conditions close to the real world."
