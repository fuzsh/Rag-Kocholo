        "text": "We travel to enquire, to hear stories and to be awestruck by incredible scenery. Traveling has an appeal of its own. It is the gusto of exploring new destinations, discovering unique cultures, and celebrating life. On that note – Welcome to the “Land of Kings”. Rajasthan is a true state of contrasts, and Jaipur travel reflects that! From UNESCO world heritage sites to holy temples to a paradise for shopohlics to mouth watering cuisines, one thing that is hard to grasp for the first-time (or even repeat) visitor is the versality of Jaipur as a travel destination.\n\nA journey to this remarkable place is on every traveller’s wish list. But it needs to be planned with care and imagination. This World Tourism Day, let us take you the through the major spots, activities, festivals in Jaipur that make the city a major hotspot of tourism in the country.\n\nMust-Visit Spots Of Jaipur\n\nThe City Palace – This legendary palace engages one-seventh of the walled city of Jaipur with temples, edifices, courtyards, gardens and museum which make the palace a cherished tourist attraction. Built in the years 1729 – 1732, the City Palace was the official residence of Maharaja of Jaipur. A part of the palace, ‘Chandra Mahal’, is still being used by the royal family, while rest of the palace is a beautiful art and ammunition museum. The doors representing four seasons, massive silver vessels and art galleries are the most significant things to see in the complex. To experience the magnificence of the palace numerous visitors from across the globe visit the city palace every year.\n\nAlbert Hall – Albert Hall is an eye catching façade standing tall in the midst of Ram Niwas gardens contrasting acres of green in Jaipur. This solitary structure takes you back into an era where aesthetics came first and remained foremost in architectural planning. Albert Hall was designed by Colonel Sir Swinton Jacob in 1876 to greet King Edward VII, Prince of Wales on his visit to India. Later after 10 years it was opened for public viewing. The most interesting things you’d find in the museum are the Persian carpets, costumes of ancient warriors and an Egyptian mummy. Crossing those majestic gates, centuries old trees on your left and right flanks, lush gardens, multitude of pigeons in front and in the middle of it all this majestic building in Hindu-Gothic architectural style is nothing less than impressive!\n\nJantar Mantar – We would find plenty of astronomical observatories around the world, but the Jantar Mantar is by far one of the largest observatories ever built. Meticulously blending religion, science and art, the Jantar Mantar is the name given to a series of five, fascinating structures built in Jaipur, Delhi, Varanasi, Ujjain and Mathura.
