        "text": "I'm a relative novice compared to all the experts on Stack Overflow.\n\nI have 2 versions of jupyter notebook running (one through a fresh Anaconda Navigator installation and one through ????). I think this is because Anaconda was installed as a local installation on my Mac (per Anaconda instructions).\n\nI already had python 3.7 installed. After that, I used my terminal to open jupyter notebook and I think that it put another version globally onto my Mac.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure because I'm just learning through trial and error!\n\nI did the terminal command:\n\nconda install -c anaconda certifi\n\n(as directed above, but it didn't work.)\n\nMy python 3.7 is installed on OS Catalina10.15.3 in:\n\n/Library/Python/3.7/site-packages AND\n\n~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages\n\nThe certificate is at:\n\n~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/certifi-2019.11.28.dist-info\n\nI tried to find the Install Certificate.command ... but couldn't find it through looking through the file structures...not in Applications...not in links above.\n\nI finally installed it by finding it through Spotlight (as someone suggested above). And it double clicked automatically and installed ANOTHER certificate in the same folder as:\n\n~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/\n\nNONE of the above solved anything for me...I still got the same error.\n\nSo, I solved the problem by:\n\nclosing my jupyter notebook.\n\nopening Anaconda Navigator.\n\nopening jupyter notebook through the Navigator GUI (instead of through Terminal).\n\nopening my notebook and running the code.\n\nI can't tell you why this worked. But it solved the problem for me.\n\nI just want to save someone the hassle next time. If someone can tell my why it worked, that would be terrific.\n\nI didn't try the other terminal commands because of the 2 versions of jupyter notebook that I knew were a problem. I just don't know how to fix that.\n\nI am seeing this issue on a Ubuntu 20.04 system and none of the \"real fixes\" (like this one) helped.\n\nWhile Firefox was willing to open the site just fine neither GNOME Web (i.e. Epiphany) nor Python3 or wget were accepting the certificate. After some searching, I came across this answer on ServerFault which lists two common reasons:\n\nThe certificate is really signed by an unknown CA (for instance an internal CA).\n\nThe certificate is signed with an intermediate CA certificate from one of the well known CA's and the remote server is misconfigured in the regard that it doesn't include that intermediate CA certificate as a CA chain it's response.\n\nYou can use the Qualys SSL Labs website to check the site's certificates and if there are issues, contact the site's administrator to have it fixed.\n\nIf you really need to work around the issue right now, I'd recommend a temporary solution like Rambod's confined to the site(s) you're trying to access."
