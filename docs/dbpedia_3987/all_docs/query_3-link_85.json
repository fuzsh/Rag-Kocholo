It is also known as the pink city due to its dominant colour scheme of the town. Vidyadhar Bhattacharya planned the town, and it was made the capital of newly formed state Rajasthan after India got independence from the colonial rule of British.\n\nWhy is Jaipur called the Paris of India?\n\nDue to the number of tourists visiting these monuments and paying tribute to the historical traditions of the city, this city's nickname is Paris of India. Being one of the most majestic and vibrant cities in India, Jaipur got its nickname a while back when an outsider stepped in and witnessed the royal decor, ornate temples, busy marketplaces, magnificent wildlife, a fantastic nightlife, and so many trees to keep the environment light and fresh. It reminded her of Paris, which had a very similar flavour to it. She also added by saying it is difficult to capture the essence of Jaipur in mere words, and one needs to come to the Paris of India to feel the vibrancy and the colourful nature of the city to understand the nickname. Apart from being called the pink city, Jaipur's being the Paris of India caught a lot of people's attention, aided the tourism culture and gave the state's economy a significant boost.\n\nHeritage Sites in Jaipur, The Paris of India\n\nThe city consists of major landmarks of our world, like Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, city palace, Jaigarh Fort, Birla Mandir, Govind Dev Ji temple, Garh Ganesh temple, Moti Dungri Ganesh Temple, Sanghi Ji Jain Temple, Jaipur Zoo, Jal Mahal, Amer Fort, and Nahargarh Fort.

The current capital of Rajasthan came into existence around 1727 AD by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. He was 11 years old when he was the king of Jaipur, and he came to power soon after the demise of his father Maharaja Bisham Singh on 31st December 1699. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II was born in the city of amber on 3rd November 1688. In his early stages of life, he was serving as a Mughal vassal, but later he broke free from the rule of Mughal hegemony and asserted his sovereignty.\n\nFood and Culture in The Paris of India\n\nThe food and culture of Jaipur are also widely known and loved by the natives of the place and the ones who visit it as tourists.
