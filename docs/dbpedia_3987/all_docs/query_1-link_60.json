        "text": "As a student, you are paying for the tuition (teaching). Teaching is an activity designed to help you learn and acquire new skills. Teaching materials (books, slides, video lectures) can be good, bad or ugly, but they are only a (smaller) part of the whole picture. They are not an activity. Arguably, they matter less.\n\nWhat matters more, in my opinion, is the opportunity to obtain constructive feedback from your tutors. Not the grade for your submissions, but actual analysis of your work, explaining its strength and weaknesses and providing you with some ideas on how to improve and what to work on. Not a general piece of information, but something unique and produced specifically for you.\n\nI have rarely seen online courses where students have enough personal attention and receive more than just a few lines of personal feedback. Honestly, the situation with many traditionally run courses is largely the same. Being massively oversubscribed and under-staffed, many Departments are not able to provide students with sensible feedback on their work. As a (pathetic) attempt to compensate, they sometimes claim that they provide exclusive teaching materials, which, however, tend often to not really be any better than standard textbooks.\n\nMy suggestion is: don't be obsessed with materials you are provided with, but look at whether you're receiving enough attention and personal guidance from your tutors. If you're not getting enough feedback - it is probably time to raise your concerns or maybe even look elsewhere.\n\nAs a professor, I spend a large amount of time reviewing and choosing reading materials so that students can learn efficiently. Then I spend time organizing the order in which students will study these materials, planning how I will interact with students in class to coordinate with readings, planning assignments to go with the readings, etc. Time lecturing, leading discussions, answering questions, etc., are only a small part of teaching. The rest is hidden from students. (Grading and providing feedback on students' work takes up a lot of time, too.) As it happens, most of the materials that I curate for students cost money. I would probably spend more time choosing materials if I had to use only free materials. There are good free materials for some purposes, but they vary more (it's the internet, you know, so there's a lot of junk along with the good stuff); with free materials you'd have to spend more time filtering out the bad ones or working around flaws. Publishing houses and editors spend a lot of time curating good resources and helping authors to make them better, so there's a reason to expect less variation and higher quality in non-free teaching materials, on average.\n\nSo if the materials in your course are poor, that would be bad, but if they're not, but they're freely available, so what? That doesn't mean the instructors aren't helping you learn by choosing those materials and assigning them. If the instructors aren't providing enough in addition to the selected materials, that's another issue, but that's not what the question was about, as I understand it.\n\n(There are some comments on other questions that make similar points, but I felt this should be an answer. It's actually something I feel strongly about. Think about how long it would take you to learn something if you just had to poke through videos or web pages on your own, or had to spend a lot of time trying books in a library or buying them online, only to find that this one is too hard and that one's on a different subject and this other one is trivially easy, and that one over there is kind of OK, but doesn't really communicate the material in a way that's best for you, or this one has only two chapters or two minutes that are useful, .... You could do it, maybe, but it would take a long time. The point of good instructor is to make your learning more efficient than it would be if you had to do it on your own.)\n\nYou're mistaking the value of the medium vs the value of the lectures themselves.\n\nYou mentioned YouTube and Wikipedia, and have the mistaken idea that they're free. Sure, they're free to access, but they're not random YouTube videos or random Wikipedia articles. They are specifically tailored to the course and relevant.\n\nYou haven't raised issues with actual academic problems with the course. Have you had a professor that do not know the subject they are teaching? (Example: A DBA was teaching a Java course) Have you had a professor that plagiarizes tests, and they contain material not covered in the course? These are real problems.\n\nYouTube and Wikipedia are free to access. The discovery and organization of the material is not free. Just because a photocopy costs 5 cents, it doesn't mean what is being photocopied is worth only 5 cent. It could be a photocopy of an extremely valuable formula.\n\nBottom line. Evaluate the worth of the content. Don't get caught up with the medium of delivery.\n\nPerhaps the issue here is that the \"lecture\" time could be more productively used as a Q&A session.\n\nYou say :\n\nThe instructor is actually very helpful during our one-on-one sessions (though unfortunately, he only holds them once a week for just 25 minutes). It's just I wish the course were in a better shape. I would've loved to have listened to, say, an hour-long lecture from him, someone with a PhD and years of experience in the field, than some self-proclaimed expert on YouTube.\n\nand :\n\nHis actual involvement in the course is answering questions via email and helping us during office hours (which is essentially a 25-minute session only once a week). Aside from that, class time is, I kid you not, just spent reading the book (which itself is quite poorly written, and contains mistakes) and watching YouTube videos.\n\nWell this suggests the problem is not the instructor.\n\nLecture material often is poorly written (let's not kid ourselves) and mistakes are quite common in lectures, so a more \"customized\" lecture experience probably would not solve those issues. And lecturers are not always very good at speaking, so a video may be better than many people get.\n\nIt's a simple fact that you are expected to learn more yourself than simply at lectures. So I wonder if the correct approach is to get together with your classmates and discuss asking for the lecture to be replaced by a Q&A period, while students look at the video and read the notes ahead of time ?\n\nThe problem seems to be a disagreement between you and the lecturer over what your payment covers. I can't tell for sure on the information you give who is right, but if I had to make a call I would bet that they are right, since that seems more likely in general.\n\nWhat you should do is get someone you trust who is far enough from the situation to be reasonably independent, and ask them to look at the material advertising the course that you could access before signing up. Is the lecturer's behaviour out of line with was advertised? If so, you would have an argument to take up with the administration (not the lecturer directly). If not, then you need to accept that you went in with the wrong expectations, and consider what you want to do about that (eg change course).\n\nAFAIK, you pay for the piece of paper from the university that grants your degree. How you get there is sometimes with an awesome instructor and sometimes with an AWFUL one. If I had considered that I was paying for the classes then sometimes I would have been happy but mostly I would have been rather displeased with that situation. There was one mandatory class for my degree that had about 5 people show up to an average class and the rest (80+ people) only came for exams because the instructor was just. that. bad. Another time we had a quiz on some material that was taught, and after the quiz people were still discussing the material on the quiz was supposed to be worked out (no one knew!). Again, because the instructor was just that bad.\n\nTL;DR: change your perspective. You pay for the paper the degree is printed on. Not for the classes themselves. They are simply necessary to get that very expensive piece of paper. Expect roughly a 60/40 of bad/good professors.\n\nAlso, bear in mind that most professors are not professors because they want to teach. The teach because it is required as a side effect of doing research at the university.\n\nHow have the course materials being audited for quality?\n\nConsider both your personal evaluation of the utility of the materials, and those of your peers, and then consider the formal process that exists, for the teaching establishment, regarding the auditing/setting of standards for educational materials on this course.\n\nThis will give some context as to whether expert opinion has gone into the material selection, if there is a process to validate this, is there a process of consensus on this, and some actual feedback on utility from those using the materials.\n\nFurthermore, you could skim the materials used in similar courses, in other \"respected\" teaching establishments, and see if they match. Additionally, many materials have reviews and those can be helpful to examine. I have completed a lot of online courses (admittedly free Coursera ones) and Princeton,Harvard etc all use (and list) YouTube materials for their courses.\n\nThis, i think, will help position your feelings, with respect to the course, in terms of a broader quality argument.\n\nThis is one to check what the original marketing materials for the course promised, bearing in mind that they may be different to your interpretation of what appropriate teaching is.\n\nWithout that information, you're paying mainly for the materials you need to learn and the final accreditation that you're reached the academic standards necessary. And, you're probably paying a premium based on the pedigree of the university.\n\nNow, in the UK where I work, there is no guarantee of a link between the name value of a university and the quality of its teaching. My experience is that less-known universities often have higher quality teaching. There are many reasons for this, but having less name value, they have to try harder. They are also likely to attract students below the top tier, so have to concentrate more on ensuring that the teaching materials are suitable for all levels of learners. And, the academics are likely to have a more teaching oriented career path, as opposed to one that concentrates on research.\n\nOften, if you're working with a very well-known professor, they are also likely to be in great demand, and not working in a role where they're expected to concentrate on teaching. In some cases, you're lucky if you see that professor at all, as opposed to a load of grad students delivering classes.\n\nAgain, this will all depend what the original promises made were. I've written a lot of course marketing materials and if would be rate to promise contact with a particular professor, as this makes too many assumptions about how that professor's career will evolve (they may take another position, for instance).\n\nFinally, there's nothing wrong with writing a course based on curating materials. It can be quite a job to find the best ones, organise them and write the links between them. It's not that different to academic practices of the past where a professor would issues assigned reading, in the form of academic papers or textbook chapters, to the class.\n\nThere are lots of online courses structured that way, both paid and free.\n\nThere is a danger if those materials change, as they are not owned by the course. For instance, YouTube videos can be taken down and Wikipedia pages edited by third parties. So long as the teaching team monitor that and have a backup plan in place, the general principle of course curation sounds acceptable to me.\n\nThe best (youtube) videos are often wastly superior to most lecturers (sic). The problem is that finding the right video is a nightmare, especially if you are not familliar with the subject. So if the videos picked for you are relevant and accurate, and you get personal feedback time, you are indeed getting world class service.\n\nIn fact I have been trying to get the university to consider moving lectures to this kind of format. With the change that video lectures are paired with hands on exercises, with course assistant present. The benefits are considerable, as you can now invest in the material in a different way and feedback becomes your primary focus. However mostly this means that the videos need to be scripted as if they were tv shows, which is harder to do. Bootstrapping this skill, and getting material done pays itself back in no time. And yes if all you teach is available on youtube fine, use that if license permits.\n\nThe days of talking head lectures are over. After all Internet was founded to make information flow faster, better and more efficiently. Yet, we are surprised when it does just that.\n\nDont judge a book by its cover\n\nYou are judging the value the instructor can offer ONLY based on the source of the course videos.\n\nInstead assess the value you can derive out of the course based on other factors also as described in other answers such as one-on-one time you get with the instructor, his credentials, value of the certificate you are offered on completion etc.\n\nYou also need to consider the value in terms of infrastructure made available for practice.\n\nGiven that its almost a week and you havent accepted any of the answers, I assume you are finding it difficult to let it pass and move on. If so, does it interfere with your learning process? It would be in your own best interest to talk to the instructor a second time about it."
