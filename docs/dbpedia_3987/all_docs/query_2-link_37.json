        "text": "Capital of Rajasthan, India\n\nThis article is about the metropolitan area in Rajasthan, India. For its namesake district, see Jaipur district. For other uses, see Jaipur (disambiguation).\n\nMetropolis in Rajasthan, India\n\nJaipur ( , Hindi: [ˈdʒeəpʊr]) is the capital and the largest city of the north-western Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011 , the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city.[11]\n\nJaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh II, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named.[12] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[13] During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949.\n\nJaipur is a popular tourist destination in India, forming a part of the west Golden triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra.[14] The city serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Mount Abu and has two World heritage sites of Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar. On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[15] It is also known as Paris of India. Due to its beauty C.V. Raman called it \"Island of Glory\".\n\nEtymology\n\nJaipur derives its name from Sawai Jai Singh II (1693-1744), the ruler of Amer, who founded the city in 1727.[11] In Sanskrit, variations of the word \"pur\" or \"pura\" are commonly used to refer to a city or town with \"Jaipur\" essentially meaning \"The City of Jai\" or \"Jai's City,\" paying homage to Maharaja Jai Singh II, who established the city.[16]\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Jaipur\n\nJaipur was founded by Rajput chief of Kachhwaha clan Jai Singh II on 18 November 1727, who ruled the region from 1699 to 1743. He planned to shift his capital from Amber, 11 kilometres (7 mi) to Jaipur to accommodate the growing population and increasing scarcity of water.[17] Jai Singh consulted with several architects while planning the layout of Jaipur and established the city on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastra under the architectural guidance of Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[18] The construction of the city began in 1726. During the rule of Sawai Ram Singh II, the city was painted pink to welcome Albert Edward, Prince of Wales in 1876.[19] Many of the avenues still remain painted in pink, giving Jaipur a distinctive appearance and the epithet Pink city.[20]\n\nIn the 19th century, the city grew rapidly and had a population of 160,000 in 1900. The wide boulevards were paved and its chief industries were the working of metals and marble, fostered by a school of art founded in 1868.[21] In August 1981, large areas of the city including the airport were flooded due to heavy rains from a cloud burst, resulting in the death of eight people and much damage to the city's Dravyavati River.[22][23] On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[24]\n\nGeography\n\nTopography\n\nJaipur is located in the northeastern part of Rajasthan and covers a total area of 467 square kilometres (180 sq mi). The city is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains to the east and south and hill chains and desert areas to the north and west.[25][26] Jaipur generally slopes downwards from north to south and then to the southeast.[27] The city is surrounded by the Nahargarh hills in the north and Jhalana in the east, which is a part of the Aravalli range.[27]\n\nThe Dravyavati River is the primary drainage channel, which by 2014 had degenerated into an untreated sewage nallah. To address this issue, a plan for the rejuvenation of the river was developed by Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) in 2015.[28] A 13 km (8.1 mi) stretch of Dravyavati riverfront out of 47.5 km (29.5 mi) was opened after rejuvenation in 2018 and the remaining project was completed in 2022.[29]\n\nClimate\n\nJaipur has a monsoon-influenced hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, mild to warm winters. Annual precipitation is over 625 millimetres or 25 inches, falling mostly in July and August due to the southwest monsoon, causing the average temperatures in these two months to be lower compared to drier May and June. During the monsoon, there are frequent, heavy rains and thunderstorms, but flooding is not common. The highest temperature ever recorded was 49.0 °C (120.2 °F), on 23 May 1994. The city's average temperature remains below 20 °C or 68 °F between December and February. These months are mild, dry, and pleasant, sometimes chilly. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −2.2 °C (28.0 °F) on 31 January 1905, 1 February 1905 and 16 January 1964. Jaipur, like many other major cities of the world, is a significant urban heat island zone with surrounding rural temperatures occasionally falling below freezing in winters.[30]\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical populationYear188118911901191119211931194119511961196819711981199120012011Pop.142,600158,900160,000137,100120,200144,200175,800291,000403,400533,200636,8001,004,7001,518,2002,322,5753,073,350±%— +11.4%+0.7%−14.3%−12.3%+20.0%+21.9%+65.5%+38.6%+32.2%+19.4%+57.8%+51.1%+53.0%+32.3%Source: Census of India[40][41][42]\n\nAccording to the provisional report of 2011 census, Jaipur city had a population of 3,073,350.[42] The overall literacy rate for the city is 84.34%.[42] The sex ratio was 898 females per 1,000 males and the child sex ratio was 854.[42]\n\nLanguages\n\nThe official language of Jaipur is Hindi and the additional official language is English.[8] The native and main dialect of the city is Dhundari with Marwari and Standard Hindi dialects are also spoken, along with English.[43]\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Hindus form the majority religious group accounting for 87.9% of the city's population, followed by Muslims (8.6%), Jains (2.4%) and others (1.2%).[44]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\nAdministration\n\nJaipur Development Authority is the main planning authority of the city.[45] Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) was established in the year 1994.[46] The area of the municipal corporation is 467 km2 (180 sq mi) and is headed by a mayor.[47] In 2020, JMC was bifurcated into two Municipal Corporations, namely Greater Jaipur Municipal Corporation and Jaipur Heritage Municipal Corporation with 150 and 100 wards respectively.[48][49] The latest elections were held in October 2020.[50][51] The current mayor of Greater JMC is Somya Gurjar and the mayor for Heritage JMC is Munesh Gurjar since 10 November 2020.[52] The administration duties are carried out by the municipal commissioner and his group of officials.
