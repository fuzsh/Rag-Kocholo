        "text": "By promoting the consumption of ‘deforestation-free’ products and reducing the EU’s impact on global deforestation and forest degradation, the new Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 on deforestation-free products is expected to bring down greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss.\n\nThe Regulation is part of a broader plan of actions to tackle deforestation and forest degradation first outlined in the 2019 Commission Communication on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests. This commitment was later confirmed by the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the Farm to Fork Strategy.\n\nOn 29 June 2023, the Regulation on deforestation-free products entered into force. The main driver of these processes is the expansion of agricultural land that is linked to the production of commodities like cattle, wood, cocoa, soy, palm oil, coffee, rubber, and some of their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tyres, or furniture. As a major economy and consumer of these commodities linked to deforestation and forest degradation, the EU is partly responsible for this problem and it wants to lead the way to solving it.\n\nUnder the Regulation, any operator or trader who places these commodities on the EU market, or exports from it, must be able to prove that the products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation.\n\nThe Regulation on deforestation-free products repeals the EU Timber Regulation. As of 29 June 2023, operators and traders will have 18 months to implement the new rules. Micro and small enterprises will enjoy a longer adaptation period, as well as other specific provisions.\n\nThe EU is continuing to work with partner countries and companies to ensure a successful transition to deforestation-free supply chains:\n\nFind out more about implementation measures and tools\n\nFurther information can be found in the comprehensive Frequently Asked Questions.\n\nDesignated Member States’ Competent Authorities (The list will be updated when the Commission is notified of new designations)\n\nMulti-Stakeholder Platform on Protecting and Restoring the World’s Forests\n\nThe European Commission organises frequent meetings with EU Member States, selected interested parties (mainly trade and business associations and NGOs), third countries to present and discuss the main strands of work and identify best practices.\n\nAgendas, presentations and summary records of the meetings of the Platform (In the Register, select the “Meetings” tab)\n\nMember Organisations of the Platform\n\nEU observatory on deforestation and forest degradation\n\nBuilding on existing monitoring tools (e.g. Copernicus and other publicly or privately available sources) the observatory will facilitate access to information on supply chains for businesses, public entities and consumers. It provides publicly available maps and datasets on changes in the world’s forest cover and associated drivers.\n\nVisit the Observatory\n\nTeam Europe Initiative on Deforestation-free Value Chains\n\nAligned with the EU’s Global Gateway strategy, the Initiative aims to support partner countries to transition to sustainable, deforestation-free, and legal agricultural value chains. Collaborative effort of European Commission and EU Member States including Germany, the Netherlands and France, with an initial package of €70 million in funding to implement the Initiative.\n\nSee more about the Team Europe Initiative\n\nBriefing notes on sourcing of deforestation-free commodities\n\nFactsheet on the Commission proposal for a Regulation\n\nEU Deforestation Regulation: an opportunity for smallholders\n\nImpact Assessment ‘Minimising the risk of deforestation and forest degradation associated with products placed on the EU market’:\n\nExecutive Summary of the Staff Working Document on the Impact Assessment\n\nStaff Working Document on the Impact Assessment (Part 1 and Part 2)\n\nPublic consultation on “Deforestation and forest degradation – reducing the impact of products placed on the EU market”\n\nSynopsis report of stakeholder consultation as part of the impact assessment on demand-side measures to address deforestation\n\nConsultancy Report on Impact assessment on demand-side measures to address deforestation\n\nFitness Check on the EU Timber Regulation and the FLEGT Regulation\n\nA Fitness Check of the EUTR and the FLEGT Regulation was performed in 2021 to evaluate their implementation and functioning, and assess if they were fit for purpose to halt illegal logging and associated trade.\n\nFind out more about the Fitness Check\n\n'The Road to Green'\n\nWatch episode 8 of our Euronews series below, which looks at deforestation and how cocoa can be grown sustainably so that it doesn't lead to the destruction of forests."
