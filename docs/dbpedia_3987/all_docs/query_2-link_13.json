        "text": "A light-hearted, fun analysis of dissociating the Western gaze on vibrant cultural aspects in former colonies. When I saw this list by TasteAtlas on the best and worst rated foods in India, I laughed. My first question was, 'According to who?' The cultures of the world that are now popular in the West need #decolonisation the most. The list seems to be made entirely from lack of knowledge on rich Indian regional cuisine, because the only best dishes listed here are those that are popularised in Europe and Americas as 'authentic Indian food'. Jaljeera, Thandai, Gajak, Mirchi Salan are explosions on your taste buds. Indians love these foods. I personally am a fan of Mirchi Salan with Biryani. Has anyone from the West ever had proper homemade Rajma-Chawal and Kadhi-Chawal? Or just a plain Dal-Chawal with Jeera aloo? Dosa, Idli, Vada? Those are just a few of the most popular foods. I won't say I have a full knowledge of Indian regional cuisines either, and I do absolutely enjoy a hearty Butter Chicken, but come on! There is more to Indian Food than just this! These dishes maybe what so many food bloggers in the West rate regularly while absolutely sabotaging the names, but move past that if you claim to be an \"ambitious project (that) stands in contrast to the world of restaurant and food critique and blogging, which frequently overlooks beloved local food in favour of championing cuisine that lies out of financial reach and everyday experience for most of us.\" Food is an important part of decolonising cultures, and dissociating from the Western gaze. Talking about the food of a country that is more diverse than its people, you need more nuance than these 10 dishes TasteAtlas . Do better!"
