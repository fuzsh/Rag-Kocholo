        "text": "Interesting facts about Pootharekulu – the paper-thin dessert of Andhra\n\nYou're Reading\n\nSynopsis\n\nPootharekulu is a word derived from two words ‘Pootha’ meaning coating and ‘Rekulu’ meaning sheet. It is a paper-thin dessert made from rice start/gram flour, jaggery/sugar and clarified butter.\n\nPootharekulu is a word derived from two words ‘Pootha’ meaning coating and ‘Rekulu’ meaning sheet. It is a paper-thin dessert made from rice start/gram flour, jaggery/sugar and clarified butter. Read less\n\nWhy are Indians, whether in North India or down South, obsessed with desserts? Well, no matter which part of India you go to, you will find a dessert unique to the destination.\n\nTo honour the natural love that we harbour for desserts, we thought of sharing a few fun and interesting facts about Pootharekulu or Poothareku, a popular sweet from Atreyapuram in Andhra Pradesh. As the name suggests, Atreyapuram has been named after Maharishi Atri, one of the ancient seers of India. Pootharekulu is a word derived from two words ‘Pootha’ meaning coating and ‘Rekulu’ meaning sheet. It is a paper-thin dessert made from rice start/gram flour, jaggery/sugar and clarified butter.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about Pootharekulu:\n\nThe melt-in-mouth Pootharekulu is originally made from rice or gram flour, and it is coated by sugar/jaggery and ghee. The people living in Atreyapuram are skilled in making this sweet.\n\nMaking Pootharekulu requires deftness of hands. Unfortunately, preparing it does not guarantee enough income, and it has not been able to spread beyond the geographical boundaries of its place of origin. Hence, it is a dying art nowadays.\n\nEvery year, a large number of humble dwellers in Atreyapuram prepare hundreds of Pootharekulu to be sent for sale in Indian towns and cities as well as abroad. Another unique confectionery item made in this province is Maamidi Thandra or mango jelly.\n\nThis mouth-watering treat noted for its crispiness is quite addictive by nature. The fact that people do not mind spending money on it proves how much loved it is in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nPootharekulu-making is one of the largest cottage industries in India. The trade of making and selling Pootharekulu is believed to be going on for three generations now. The fact that it can be produced at a lower cost and then sold for export at a justifiable price has been a great support for income generation among the class of workers.\n\nDo you know that every house in Atreyapuram prepares 400 or so pieces of Pootharekulu every day? These pieces are sold at INR 20 per 100 pieces by the local women self-help groups who labour to produce the sweets for sale.\n\nWhen in Atreyapuram, do visit\n\nAtreyapuram is located in East Godavari district and close to the village is located Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Vadapalli. The Bhramostavam is one of the grand events held in the temple for 10 days. The special feature of this temple is the image of the deity crafted from Erachandanam wood. Sri Venkateswara Swamy is also referred to as Kalyana Venkateswara, and every Saturday several devotees throng the temple to offer prayers. Another significant temple in the village is Vaadapalli Venkanna Swamy Temple. It is believed that this historic temple has the power to fulfil prayers if one performs 11 circumambulations of the temple without a break for seven Saturdays.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
