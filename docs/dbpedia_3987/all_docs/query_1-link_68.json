        "text": "There is already a Wikipedia entry on the subject (see Parameter) that defines and distinguishes the terms parameter and argument. In short, a parameter is part of the function/procedure/method signature and an argument is the actual value supplied at run-time and/or call-site for the parameter.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also states that the two terms are often used synonymously (especially when reasoning about code informally):\n\nAlthough parameters are also commonly referred to as arguments, arguments are more properly thought of as the actual values or references assigned to the parameter variables when the subroutine is called at runtime.\n\nGiven the following example function in C that adds two integers, x and y would be referred to as its parameters:\n\nint add(int x, int y) { return x + y; }\n\nAt a call-site using add, such as the example shown below, 123 and 456 would be referred to as the arguments of the call.\n\nint result = add(123, 456);\n\nAlso, some language specifications (or formal documentation) choose to use parameter or argument exclusively and use adjectives like formal and actual instead to disambiguate between the two cases. For example, C/C++ documentation often refers to function parameters as formal arguments and function call arguments as actual arguments. For an example, see “Formal and Actual Arguments” in the Visual C++ Language Reference.\n\nLet's say you're an airline. You build an airplane. You install seats in it. Then, you fill the plane up with passengers and send it somewhere. The passengers disembark. Next day, you re-use the same plane, and same seats, but with different passengers this time.\n\nThe plane is your function.\n\nThe parameters are the seats.\n\nThe arguments are the passengers that go in those seats.\n\nfunction fly(seat1, seat2) { seat1.sayMyName(); // Estraven seat2.sayMyName(); // Genly Ai etc. } var passenger1 = \"Estraven\"; var passenger2 = \"Genly Ai\"; fly(passenger1, passenger2);\n\nIn editing, I'm often put off at how people forget: structure languages are based on natural languages.\n\nIn English\n\nA \"parameter\" is a placeholder. They set the response format, in spoken language. By definition, it's party to the call, limiting the response.\n\nAn \"argument\" is a position that is being considered. You argue your opinion: you consider an argument.\n\nMain difference\n\nThe thematic role of an argument is agent. The thematic role of parameter is recipient.\n\nInteractions\n\nThink of the argument as the male part, making the parameter the female part. The argument goes into the parameter.\n\nUsage\n\nA parameter is usually used in definitions. An argument is usually used in invocations.\n\nQuestions\n\nFinish the sentence to make it less dissonant.\n\n(A) Speaking of a definition:\n\nWhat argument will be used []?\n\nWhat [] will this parameter []?\n\n(B) Speaking of an invocation:\n\nWhat parameter will you use, []?\n\nWhat [] will be [] this parameter?\n\nAnswers\n\n(A)\n\non/in/against/with this parameter\n\nargument(s) ... take\n\n(B)\n\nand what are some example arguments\n\nargument(s) ... used on/in/against/with\n\nOverlaps\n\nAs you can imagine, after answering: in spoken language, these words will sometimes produce identical responses!\n\nSo, as a rule:\n\nUsually if someone wants parameter information, they want to know more about the type, the variable name, etc. They may become confused if you only give example arguments.\n\nUsually if someone wants argument information, they want to know what value you passed to a function or its parameter(s).\n\nThe terms are somewhat interchangeable. The distinction described in other answers is more properly expressed with the terms formal parameter for the name used inside the body of the function and parameter for the value supplied at the call site (formal argument and argument are also common).\n\nAlso note that, in mathematics, the term argument is far more common and parameter usually means something quite different (though the parameter in a parametric equation is essentially the argument to two or more functions).\n\nSimple Explanations without code\n\nA \"parameter\" is a very general, broad thing, but an \"argument: is a very specific, concrete thing. This is best illustrated via everyday examples:\n\nExample 1: Vending Machines - Money is the parameter, $2.00 is the argument\n\nMost machines take an input and return an output. For example a vending machine takes as an input: money, and returns: fizzy drinks as the output. In that particular case, it accepts as a parameter: money.\n\nWhat then is the argument? Well if I put $2.00 into the machine, then the argument is: $2.00 - it is the very specific input used.\n\nExample 2: Cars - Petrol is the parameter\n\nLet's consider a car: they accept petrol (unleaded gasoline) as an input. It can be said that these machines accept parameters of type: petrol. The argument would be the exact and concrete input I put into my car. e.g. In my case, the argument would be: 40 litres of unleaded petrol/gasoline.\n\nExample 3 - Elaboration on Arguments\n\nAn argument is a particular and specific example of an input. Suppose my machine takes a person as an input and turns them into someone who isn't a liar.\n\nWhat then is an argument? The argument will be the particular person who is actually put into the machine. e.g. if Colin Powell is put into the machine then the argument would be Colin Powell.\n\nSo the parameter would be a person as an abstract concept, but the argument would always be a particular person with a particular name who is put into the machine. The argument is specific and concrete.\n\nThat's the difference. Simple.\n\nConfused?\n\nPost a comment and I'll fix up the explanation.\n\nI'm still not happy with all these answers. They all start talking about \"function declarations\" and my monkey brain has already wandered off and started thinking about unicorns. That doesn't help me remember at all, it's just the definition.\n\nI want something that I can immediately and forever hold in my head.\n\nThe only answer here that I quickly understand is:\n\n\"Arguments are actual values that are passed in\".\n\nArguments are easier to define and as long as you know what they are then you know parameters are the other.\n\nThe other way I can think of it is:\n\nArguments are the variables outside the function\n\nParameters are the variables inside the function\n\nSimplified down to:\n\nArguments outside, parameters inside\n\nIf any one wants to disagree with me, you can leave your arguments outside ;)\n\nThey both dont have much difference in usage in C, both the terms are used in practice. Mostly arguments are often used with functions. The value passed with the function calling statement is called the argument, And the parameter would be the variable which copies the value in the function definition (called as formal parameter).\n\nint main () { /* local variable definition */ int a = 100; int b = 200; int ret; /* calling a function to get max value */ ret = max(a, b); printf( \"Max value is : %d\\n\", ret ); return 0; } /* function returning the max between two numbers */ int max(int num1, int num2) { /* local variable declaration */ int result; if (num1 > num2) result = num1; else result = num2; return result; }\n\nIn the above code num1 and num2 are formal parameters and a and b are actual arguments.\n\nLogically speaking,we're actually talking about the same thing. But I think a simple metaphor would be helpful to solve this dilemma.\n\nIf the metaphors can be called various connection point we can equate them to plug points on a wall. In this case we can consider parameters and arguments as follows;\n\nParameters are the sockets of the plug-point which may take various different shapes. But only certain types of plugs fit them.\n\nArguments will be the actual plugs that would be plugged into the plug points/sockets to activate certain equipments.\n\nIt's explained perfectly in Parameter (computer programming) - Wikipedia\n\nLoosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.\n\nIn the function definition f(x) = x*x the variable x is a parameter; in the function call f(2) the value ``2 is the argument of the function.\n\nAnd Parameter - Wikipedia\n\nIn computer programming, two notions of parameter are commonly used, and are referred to as parameters and arguments—or more formally as a formal parameter and an actual parameter.\n\nFor example, in the definition of a function such as\n\ny = f(x) = x + 2,\n\nx is the formal parameter (the parameter) of the defined function.\n\nWhen the function is evaluated for a given value, as in\n\nf(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,\n\nis the actual parameter (the argument) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the formal parameter of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms parameter and argument might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)"
