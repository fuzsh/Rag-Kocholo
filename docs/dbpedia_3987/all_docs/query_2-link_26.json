        "text": "Khiamniungan Nagas\n\nCultural Mapping Projects Uncategorized\n\nThe Khiamniungan Nagas are a fascinating tribe with a rich cultural heritage that deserves to be documented and preserved for future generations. Thanks to the efforts of the INTACH Nagaland chapter, a detailed report has been submitted to the IGH division, highlighting their ancestral traditions and present-day culture. The report delves deep into the tribe’s everyday activities, customs, marriage systems, birth rites, folklore, decorations, performing arts, religion, tattoo traditions, crafts, textiles, and much more. As one of Nagaland’s sixteen tribes, the Khiamniungan Naga live in the sub-divisional headquarters of Noklak in the Tuensang district.\n\nDespite their fascinating history, the Khiamniungan Nagas have been largely ignored in written records due to the absence of a written script. The only source of information on their history is from myths and oral legends. The British referred to them as “Kalyu Kenyu,” and they share a history with their Myanmar counterparts, with continued cross-border trade.\n\nBefore the advent of Christianity, the Khiamniungan Nagas were followers of animism and worshipped inanimate objects and the environment. The belief that all things have a spirit or soul that can offer help or harm to humans was central to the animist dogma. There is no customary practice for imparting justice, and each village holds a system of laws and practices that differ from the others.\n\nThe Khiamniungan Nagas have a strict code and forbidden taboo against intermarrying within the same clan and its subsequent sub-clans originating from the same major clan lineage. They are well-known for their basketry practices, with the menfolk being skilled and expert basket weavers, weaving traditional outfits, and constructing walls and floors made of bamboo and wood.\n\nCultural Documentation of River Ganga from Gaumukh to Ganga Sagar – Aligarh District\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThis Namami Gange project is being undertaken for the Jal Shakti Ministry, Government of India, under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) scheme. INTACH is assisting the Ministry in the capacity of a knowledge partner. Three divisions of INTACH namely; Natural Heritage (NH), Architectural Heritage (AH) and Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) divisions have been engaged in the cultural mapping project, of three aspects natural, tangible and intangible assets along Ganga.\n\nThe objective of the project is to conduct field investigation and document existing cultural assets on either side of the river Ganga (within a radius of 5Kms, starting from its source, i.e. Gangotri, down to its point of dispersal at Ganga Sagar) and to produce for the ministry a detailed, illustrated report based on the primary and secondary resources available.\n\nAligarh District\n\nThe report talks elaborately about the history of the region, the legends associated with the origin of the district related to the mythological figures. It speaks vividly about the historical trajectories, the political changes and the changing power dynamics of several dynasties and the empires that were established by them that has left an imprint on the culture and heritage of Aligarh.\n\nAligarh has a huge plethora of local art and craft traditions that engages the local people especially the women folk in the villages like the Appliqué work, brass statues, Plaster of Paris idols and decorative idols. This report also sheds light on the major industry of Aligarh, the lock making industry that employs the largest workforce in this place and plays a crucial role in the economy of the district. This report also highlights other important facets like the important personalities and institutions and their continuing legacies like the house of the Mehdis and their speciality at sherwani making and the famous Aligarh Muslim University that is intrinsically linked with the identity of the place and how it was developed based on the ideals envisioned by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and how over the years it has changed with the changing times. Along with this report gives a glimpse of all the places of religious and historical importance and the celebrations and festivities observed by the inhabitants of the district.\n\nCheck out more on the INTACH ICH Archive:\n\nhttps://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/81\n\nCultural Documentation of River Ganga from Gaumukh to Ganga Sagar – Khagaria and Katihar Districts\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThis Namami Gange project is being undertaken for the Jal Shakti Ministry, Government of India, under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) scheme.

They congregate to four locations in India at the designated six-year cycle (Ardh Kumbh) or the twelve- year cycle (Maha Kumbh) with a single purpose—a dip in the Nectar of Faith.\n\nWhat draws them in multitudes to this festival and what does the Kumbh signify metaphorically? What is the importance of the River Ganga in relation to the Kumbh? What place do these two elements hold in the tenets of Sanatan Dharma?The film explores these questions and more in a fascinating narrative that is woven by seers from different ascetic orders—Junapethadheeshwar Acharya MahaMandaleshwar Swami AvadheshanadGiri Ji Maharaj, Acharya Mahamandeleshwar Swami KailashanandGiri Ji Maharaj of Shri PanchNiranjaniAkhada, Jagad Guru Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati Ji Maharaj, Sadhvi Bhagwati Saraswati Ji of the Divine Shakti Foundation, Acharya Mahamandeleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi of the KinnarAkhada, as well as devotees and scholars.\n\nThe YouTube links to the films are\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y70ls2BJK4k (English subtitles)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VyUTD-ekh8U (Hindi)\n\nCultural Documentation of River Ganga from Gaumukh to Ganga Sagar – Buxar District\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThis Namami Gange project is being undertaken for the Jal Shakti Ministry, Government of India, under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) scheme.

This book published by Routledge, explores the shared cultural heritage among the highland and river valley communities of Northeast India and mainland South East Asia, including South China, through oral traditions. It looks at these shared cultural traditions and suggests new ways of understanding and interpreting the heritage of Northeast India. Oral traditions often bring forward an unexpected twist in understanding historical and cultural links, and this volume explores this using local knowledge and innovative engagements with oral traditions in multiple ways, from folklore and language to performative traditions.\n\nThe essays in this volume examine how communities build new meanings from old traditions, often as a recognition of the tension between conservation and creation, between individual interpretation and social consensus. They offer interesting parallels on how oral traditions behave in different socio-economic contexts, and also examine how oral traditions and memory interact with the digital world’s penetration in remote areas.\n\nThis volume will be useful for scholars and researchers of Northeast India, sociology, sociology of culture, cultural studies, ethnic studies, anthropology, folkloristics, and political sociology. This publication from December 2020 was an outcome of the oral traditions international conference organised by the ICH division in Meghalaya in the year 2016.\n\nLink to the conference:\n\nhttp://intangibleheritage.intach.org/intach-shillong-conference-2016/\n\nLink to purchase the book:\n\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Oral-Traditions-Continuities-and-Transformations-in-Northeast-India-and/Sarkar-Modwel/p/book/9780815396161\n\nCoffee Table Book- Kashi Chitran: Living Heritage of Varanasi\n\nCultural Mapping Outreach Activities Projects\n\nVaranasi, one of the most ancient cities of the world, is a precious repository of cultural heritage.

The report also looks at its sacred complexes including the famous Vindhyavasini temple, and the rich living tradition of artisanship, with crafts like carpet weaving, brassware, shellac work, and Chunar pottery carving a unique niche for the region.\n\nAlthough there are many popular opinions about its genesis, it is believed that the Kajri singing emerged primarily from Mirzapur. Birha and Laavani are also important folk song traditions here. Lorikayan is a popular folklore of the region and is sung with great emotion, usually in Bhojpuri. It is an oral tradition still prevalent among the people, primarily from the Ahir community, besides Gond, Dusadh, Teli, Kalavar, Kumhar, Mallah, Naai, Dhobi and Kherwar communities.\n\nCheck out more on the INTACH ICH Archive:\n\nhttps://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/81\n\nCultural Documentation of River Ganga from Gaumukh to Gangasagar – Prayagraj District\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThis Namami Gange project is being undertaken for the Jal Shakti Ministry, Government of India, under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) scheme. INTACH is assisting the Ministry in the capacity of a knowledge partner. Three divisions of INTACH namely; Natural Heritage (NH), Architectural Heritage (AH) and Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) divisions have been engaged in the cultural mapping project, of three aspects natural, tangible and intangible assets along Ganga.\n\nThe objective of the project is to conduct field investigation and document existing cultural assets on either side of the river Ganga (within a radius of 5Kms, starting from its source, i.e. Gangotri, down to its point of dispersal at Ganga Sagar) and to produce for the ministry a detailed, illustrated report based on the primary and secondary resources available.\n\nPrayagraj District\n\nThe report covers the foremost topics related to intangible heritage, with the research comprising a mythological and historical overview, the city in antiquity, a look at Shringverpur, Pratishthanpur and Jhunsi, and the later catch and release of colonialism. The recognition of Prayagraj as Tirtharaj or the ‘king of pilgrimage’, its deep connection with the philosophy of Sanatan Dharma, the history of the Kumbh Mela and its relevance to the city, including its related rituals and folk traditions, are some of the important aspects of the study.\n\nThe famous Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb, and the impact of the literature and language of the city on the rest of the country has been documented; as also its various communities residing in close proximity to the river.The numerous sacred complexes and ghats, the fairs and festivals,craftslike moonj basketry, performing traditions like the Pattharchatti Ramlila, and foodways unique to the region have also been recorded, along with interesting traditions like that of gehrebazi, a form of horse racing, and the well-known Sufi Daire of Allahabad.\n\nCheck out more on the INTACH ICH Archive:\n\nhttps://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/81\n\nCultural Documentation of River Ganga from Gaumukh to Gangasagar – Varanasi District\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThis Namami Gange project is being undertaken for the Jal Shakti Ministry, Government of India, under the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) scheme. INTACH is assisting the Ministry in the capacity of a knowledge partner. Three divisions of INTACH namely; Natural Heritage (NH), Architectural Heritage (AH) and Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) divisions have been engaged in the cultural mapping project, of three aspects natural, tangible and intangible assets along Ganga.\n\nThe objective of the project is to conduct field investigation and document existing cultural assets on either side of the river Ganga (within a radius of 5Kms, starting from its source, i.e. Gangotri, down to its point of dispersal at Ganga Sagar) and to produce for the ministry a detailed, illustrated report based on the primary and secondary resources available.\n\nVaranasi District\n\nKashi, Banaras or Varanasi reflects a unique identity that has resulted from the combined living memory of the communities settled here, and the multi-dimensional cultural influences accommodated by the city over the years. One of the most ancient cities of the world, it is a repository of heritage, with a series of invasions and inhabitations informing its secular and spiritual nature, each carrying with it a plethora of both intangible and tangible properties, social contracts and related norms of knowledge,traditions and customs.\n\nThe steadfast river Ganga, the famous galis, the magnificent ghats, the countless temples, the kunds and places of religious interest, the historic Banaras Hindu University, the sadhus and varied cults, the profound theories of life and death, the commerce, the craftsmanship and culinary flavours, and the vitality of the Banaras gharana and its exponents in the field of music and dance, make the intangible cultural heritage of Varanasi truly exceptional. These intangible inheritances have been listed and documented in this report. The report also highlights the connection of the river Ganga with the city and its people. From the daily Ganga aarti to the last rites and rituals, the river plays a very crucial part in the lives of its residents and the millions of tourists and pilgrims that arrive here for its darshan.\n\nCheck out more on the INTACH ICH Archive:\n\nhttps://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/81\n\nThe Ramayana Project: Vignettes of Ramayana\n\nOutreach Activities Projects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe essence of the Ramayana has been expressed in a diverse array of regional cultures and artistic mediums across India. In an effort to review the transmission, mobility, adaptation and concrete expression of the Rama theme among different communities and regions in India, and to study at close quarters the power of the ‘oral word’, a series of films have been made under the Ramayana Project of the ICH Division.\n\nOne of the most important literary works of ancient India, the Ramayana has had a profound impact on art and culture in the Indian subcontinent and South-East Asia.It’s stories defy categorization of art as folk or classical, rural or urban, textual or oral. Literary, oral, kinetic and pictorial aspects intermingle to generate multiple renditions of the text in different locales and contexts, each rendition with unique variations and linguistic distinction.\n\nThese 17 short films aim to understand and capture the ethos of the Ramayana. They portray how the story in the epic has changed to include local flavour without losing the central theme and message. The films, through experts, bring out the nuances of the distinct Ramayanas as performed in different parts of India.\n\nFor instance, the Yakshagana films from the region of coastal Karnataka illustrate how the performative aspect of the text makes it fluid, accessible and adaptable. It accounts for its preservation, survival, and transmission; with the two distinct styles within it appealing to both a rural and urban audience. These films look at the origins, structure, unique features, character-creation, and training aspects of this art form through exponents, creative artists and scholars in the field like Prof. M. L. Samaga, Dr. Prabhakara Joshy, Prof. Purushottam Bilimale, and Keremane Shivananda Hegde.\n\nGiving the perspective of a scholar, DrShastri quotes Valmiki on how ‘grief flows as verse’, and how the story has impacted the world, to stress the universal appeal of the Ramayana, while DrRomilaThapar gives the historian’s view on the faith and belief element of the narrative. The perspective of an institution is given through interviews with well-regarded acharyas of the Chinmaya Mission, an institution engaged in the dissemination of Vedanta, the science of the self as expounded in the Vedas, particularly the Upanishads, and other Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Ramayana.\n\nTelling the story of the Ramayana through string puppetry, puppet master BhaskarKogga Kamath says that Uppinakudru puppetry, the puppet play of Yakshagana, is an art form that existed as early as the 12th century, as mentioned in DaasaSahitya and SharanaSahitya. His organization goes back 350 years, with the art form, taught in the guru shishya tradition, incorporating the history and culture of 6 generations. However, the lack of interest and enthusiasm in the current generation toward this dying art form may well be its death knell.\n\nThe Ayodhya films express the deep integration between the ethos of Rama and that of Ayodhya. The common man of Ayodhya is far removed from the commercialization, and pomp and show, associated with Rama. The concept of Rama, his story, his values is a part of the daily life of the residents of this city. The devotion with which people touch the waters of the river Sarayu speaks volumes of their belief about the river and its importance to the city. For them, it is linked inextricably with Rama.\n\nFor more information please check the link: https://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/67\n\nCoffee Table Book -KarmasuKauśalam: Excellence in Action\n\nOutreach Activities Projects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThis beautifully illustrated coffee table book was created by the ICH Division for the LalBahadurShastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) at Mussoorie. Made to commemorate 60 years of the Academy as a premier institution to train officers of the civil services in India, this publication contains rare old photographs and an engaging text replete with the musings and memories of the Academy alumni and instructors. It captures the wide range of activities and studies taken up by the officer trainees, and encapsulates the true spirit of the dictum ‘unity in diversity’. The division worked on various aspects of the publication to prepare the LBSNAA Coffee table book, which was printed both in Hindi and English. It was released by the Prime Minister of India on 31st October, 2019, during the Aarambh Conference for Officer Trainees of the 94th Civil Services Foundation Course at Kevadia, Gujarat.\n\nCover of KarmasuKauśalam: Excellence in Action, the coffee table book on the LBSNAA\n\nThe release of the LBSNAA Coffee table book by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri NarendraModi, at Kevadia, Gujarat, on 31st October, 2019\n\nDocumentary on the Raas (Raax)Mahotsava of Majuli, Assam\n\nOutreach Activities Projects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nAn audio-visual documentation project, Raas (Raax)Mahotsavaof Majuli, was undertaken by theINTACH Assam Chapter and ICH Division. The detailed documentation outlines aspects of the Raas (Raax)festival held at Majuli in Assam, and its significance in the life of the people of the world’s largest river island. The film looks at four Satras—Uttar KamalabariSatra,DakshinpatSatra, SamaguriSatra and GaramurSatra—as well as the Mising Community’scelebration of this festival. While the ingenious use of masks is one of the primary aspects ofthe SamaguriSatra, contemporary mass cultural elements have made inroads into the GaramurSatra presentation. The Mising celebrate the Raas in their individual style, not so much as an extension of religious influence, but as an adaptation of borrowed elements from the mainstream celebrations of various Satras. The film has been directed by filmmaker Reema Bora.\n\nPerforming Freedom: Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nDenotified and Nomadic Tribes/Communities (DNTs) are the most marginalized social groups in Indian society. A total of 126, presently estimated to be 150, tribes/communities, were labelled and listed as ‘Criminal Tribes’ by the colonial British government through various legislations, beginning with the ‘Criminal Tribes Act’ of 1871. On the recommendations of various statutory bodies appointed by the Government of India after independence, the ‘Criminal Tribes Act’ was repealed in 1952. However, the apprehension that their free movement may cause ‘nuisance’ led to the enactment of the ‘ Habitual Offender Act’ under which these communities continued to be under a highly ‘biased’ surveillance until very recently. The stereotypes and stigma engrained in the general view, for nearly five decades after independence, denied these communities access to any meaningful citizenship rights and they had practically no access to land, education, livelihood, healthcare, and human rights.\n\nOn the appeal of DNT Rights Action Group, the Government of India appointed the National Commission for the Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities in 2005. In order to advice this commission, a study has been brought out, under the guidance of Dr. Ganesh Devy, to provide information related to the cultural expressions such as language, performance traditions, art forms, music, dance, and festivals of these communities. To study and analyze the intangible heritage components of these communities, and their co-relation to their livelihoods, this project was undertaken by Prof. Devy and the Dharwad Chapter of INTACH. The communities studied include the Lambada, Seharia, Banjara, Gondhali, Doombari, Potraj, Nathpanthi, Nandi, Pardhi, Ghisadi-Lohar, Bahuroopia,and Vasudev.\n\nfor more information follow the link: https://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/119\n\nICH Listing and Documentation Project: Endangered traditional Cuisines of Jaisalmer Region\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nA project on the documentation of endangered traditional cuisines of Jaisalmer region was undertaken by Gwalior Chapter to document and digitize the unique recipes with the aim to give life to many lost traditional cuisines.With time old ladies and chefs who were masters in these recipes will disappear from existence.\n\nDuring the primary survey, it was seen that the whole cuisine of the Jaisalmer region is divided based on the different caste prevailing in the community. Furthermore, these castes are divided into various other classes of community. For instance, Muslim community is further divided in various classes similarly Hindu community is separated by various classes. These communities use same local ingredients to cook food but their cooking “recipe” is different from each other.\n\nThese facts emerged from the survey and research and there have been drastic change in the food pattern of this region in last 25 years that needs to be noticed and documented. The reason behind this change is the tourism development in this region which has become the most significant economic activity leading towards modification not only in lifestyle but also in the eating patterns. As Jaisalmer has become important tourist destination, varied global cultures including their cuisines have entered in the houses of the Jaisalmer too. In this situation, it was decided to list and document the food customs of this region. The chapter has compiled 60 vegetarian recipes which can be tasted during the special festive occasions in the houses of Jaisalmer though most of them have now been modified as per the preferences of kitchens.\n\nThe survey is descriptive and exploratory whereby aspects of the available resources in region and the condition existing are taken into consideration. At the same time potential for preserving the traditional recipes are also studied. It is a study of what was and what is and does not include experimentation. The approach includes both to survey and to document the traditional cuisines of the Jaisalmer region. Based on the survey, the whole cuisine of this region is classified as shown in the flow chart.\n\nRecipes are further divided into Lost and Living recipes. Lost recipes are those, which are no longer prepared or cooked in any kitchen of Jaisalmer. These are disappearing from day to day life of the people. Even the preparation of cuisines during special occasions like the royal Dushhera procession have stopped due to the fact that ritual of royal Dushhera is discontinued. As a result of this these recipes have become extinct. Whereas, living recipes are those which still find place in the kitchens of Jaisalmer. Although they are modified a little as per the requirement but are still in practice.\n\nDocumenting Traditional Games in Temples of Bengaluru\n\nProjects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nFrom game boards in the Harappan site of Dholavira to paintings in Ajanta depicting people playing board games, to our epics where major events unfold around board games, India has a rich and deep tradition of playing various board games. These games and game boards form part of our city’s intangible heritage.\n\nThe main aim of this research, by INTACH Bengaluru Chapter, 2019, is to document the games which were played in temple complexes and elsewhere such as kattes (platforms around trees), mandapas, kalyanis and other vernacular structures. It will focus on the city of Bengaluru and its immediate surroundings. There are many temples which have engravings of game boards such as navakankari (Nine Men’s Morris), variations of aaduhuliaata (Tigers and Goats), vimaana, mancala etc, on their plinths, kattes, steps, edges of platforms etc.\n\nThe following games of temples were found and documented in detail.\n\nChowkaBarah is one of the oldest board games of India that is still played in some parts of the country. It is known as Chowka Bara in Mysuru and as Chakaara or Chakka in north Karnataka. This game is similar to ludo and can be played by 4 players. It is a game of chance that is played with cowry shells (called kavade in Kannada).\n\nAaduHuli-(Bagh Aur Bakri) (Credits: KreedaKoushalya) (Found in Bull Temple) AaduHuli is a traditional board game from Karnataka, South India, inspired by hunting practices. The game involves 2 players, one controls 4 tigers and the other controls a flock of 16 goats.\n\nAadu Puli Aatam– This is a two-player game of skill, strategy, and thinking like chess. There are 3 tigers and 15 goats. The tigers try to kill the goats while the goats try to corner the tigers so they cannot move. Through this game, the players are thought the importance of teamwork, how united and well-guided goats can pause the movement of powerful tigers. And also how to feed on our prey efficiently.\n\nSolahSeedi – is a battlefield game for two, where each player has 16 equally matched game pieces. The aim is to occupy enemy territory through strategic moves and planned efforts, thus defeating the opponent. It is a great way to improve strategic thinking and planning. There are very particular and fixed rules to this game, much like how battles were fought in real life in the olden days.\n\nDahdi -This is a strategy game in which the aim is to get as many points as possible by getting three pieces in a row. Two players are given 9 coins each. The players try to move them to get 3 coins in a row. Although the purpose is similar to noughts and crosses, the game is far more complex as coins can be moved and the opponent’s coins can be removed. Dahdi is a survival game where you need to anticipate your opponent’s moves.\n\nIn today’s time and age, the use of temple games is almost extinct. The condition of these engraved games is bad. Most of the impression games are diminishing and those whose condition is still good are not played at all. The whole purpose of these temple games was to promote community gatherings and activities in the temple complex. It was a recreational as well as a social activity. Most of the people visiting the temples are not interested anymore in playing the games. At the same time, there are initiatives to bring back these traditional games by organisations like Kaavde, KreedaKoushalya etc. Their main intention is to introduce future generations to these games and invest in the joy of playing them. These games are being brought back in the form of board games and kits. Spaces, where people can gather and play these games, are cropping up to replicate the community activities happening in the temple.\n\nCheck our ICH Archives link for more information:\n\nhttps://icharchive.intach.org/Detail/collections/217\n\nPrayagraj Kumbh Mela Documentation\n\nProjects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe 2019 Kumbh Mela of Prayagraj was documented as part of the Namami Gange documentation project for the NMCG. Mythological time and historical chronology may not be contiguous or of equal dimensions, but they interlock and overlap in popular imagination at the Kumbh Mela, when Prayagaraj becomes one of the most crowded places on earth during this festival in the Hindu month of Magh.\n\nThe extensive report covers the Kumbh festival and its origins, the significance of the Kumbh Mela at each place—Haridwar, Nasik, Prayag and Ujjain, the related mythological tales, and the various bathing and other rituals that attract lakhs of devotees. The various types of Kumbh, historical records and references, by foreign travellers and from local sources, the conflict between the pandas (priests) of Prayag and the British and the imposition of Pilgrim Tax, and other interesting facets that trace the evolution of this important socio-religious phenomenon in the Indian cultural landscape, are included in the report.\n\nSocio-cultural Study of Seharia Tribe of Rajasthan and M.P.\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nA project on the socio-cultural study of the Seharia tribe was undertaken by the SawaiMadhopur Chapter. The detailed report in Hindi comprises visual and written descriptions of the social systems and culture of the Seharia tribe residing in the Baran and Kota districts of Rajasthan and the SheopurKalan district of M.P. The tribe’s agricultural income is marginal but they get substantial additional income from working in the forests and collecting minor forest produce such as honey and edible gums, manufacture of kattha, collection of chironji, and from the tapping of the Salai tree. The report gives information on the history, religion, language, folklore, festivals, ornaments and attire, food and kitchen habits, marriage, birth and death rituals of the Seharia. The folk arts, crafts and performing traditions have also been documented.\n\nIntangible Heritage Aspects of Sacred Groves and Deities in North Western Ghats of Maharashtra\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe Project aims at documenting the intangible heritage of the sacred groves, its customs, beliefs, folklore, rituals and the changes it has faced. Its major focus is in and around Pune in Maharashtra.\n\nPune city originated as a tiny agricultural settlement called “Punnaka” or “Punnyavishay”, in the 8th century AD. In the mid-18th century Pune became the seat of the Peshwas and grew as a flourishing town. Later in British rule, when the Pune Municipality was formed it started growing exponentially; turning into Pune Metropolitan Region of over 1600 sq.km.\n\nBut apart from being the urban town throughout history, Pune has another side to it too. It harbours rich bio-diversity, which is recognised and protected by govt at various sites. And it also has natural heritage sites traditionally marked, worshipped, looked after and managed by the local communities as their traditions.\n\nNature worship which is an ancient Indian tradition and considers all forms of life as sacred, is also found in these rich natural heritage sites. Sacred Groves, natively known as “Devrai”, are forest patches conserved traditionally by communities in the name of a deity. It is a pre-historic practice and so these groves are often the last patches of the original vegetation in that area which houses rich endemic biodiversity. These Groves are also repositories of rich oral traditions about many customs and traditions and the related myths and stories centring around the concept of a “presiding deity” in most of these groves.\n\nMethodology adopted for the study is as followed:\n\n⦁ Literature survey, interaction with subjects\n\n⦁ Photo documentation of shrines and associated objects.\n\n⦁ Interviews of people, learned and associated people\n\n⦁ Video and audio documentation of the folklore, custom and traditions.\n\nList of sites surveyed in this are as follows:\n\n⦁ Durgabai- Ahupe\n\n⦁ Bhimshankar\n\n⦁ Morachi-Chincholi\n\n⦁ Ajeebali-Chikhalgaon\n\n⦁ Bhuleshwar\n\n⦁ Ghol\n\n⦁ Padsthal\n\n⦁ Jejuri\n\n⦁ Nageshwar\n\n⦁ Mandharadevi.\n\nThe report gives a basic overview of the history of these sites and how its present has been shaped. It goes on to give details about the traditions, beliefs, folklore and rituals associated with these places. Its a starting point for the study of this community based heritage which is getting neglected or over exploited due to resource extraction.\n\nThe Project was undertaken by INTACH Pune Chapter along with INTACH ICH.\n\nCultural Mapping of the Sauras in Odisha\n\nCultural Mapping\n\nSaora is one of the Ancient tribes of Odisha, which is also mentioned in the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. According to local legends, Savari – Rama’s devotee in Ramayana was from the Saora community. Though Odisha is the main land for the tribe, small number of people are also found in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. In earlier times, the King of Gajapati (Gajapati is a district in Southern Odisha,) owned tea estates in Assam, at the time some of the people from the Saora community migrated to Assam to work there.\n\nThey have their own native language called Sora, which is a Munda language and they are one of the very few tribes of India that have a script for the language, Sorang Sompeng.\n\nThey are known by various names like Saora, Sora, Savara etc. Though government recognises 25 sub-divisions of this community, based on occupation, food habits, dress patterns, social customs and traditions. But they themselves are not aware of this distinction, they believe there are only 2 types of Saora, Lanjia Saora- who live on the hills and still practice their unique customs and traditions, and Sudha Saora- who live in the plains and have assimilated into the mainstream society.\n\nThe highland areas of the Gunupur division in Rayagada, and Parlakhemundi in Gajapati, are the main habitation pockets of the Saora in Odisha. The natural beauty is not the only thing that is offered here. Mythology and ancient kingdoms have left their footprints in the region, as storied for the future generation.\n\nThis community is a rich bundle of heritage. It has unique art practices, religious customs as well as a dying tattooing tradition called ‘Tantangbo’. They are loosing their heritage due to conversions, modernisation as well as lack of records of their history. Thus its pertinent to record and further their dwindling customs.\n\nReport undertaken by Srishti Mandaar and Anubhav Das of The Tribal Fund for Documentation and Conservation, under the guidance of Nerupama Y. Modwel, Director ICH division.\n\nICH Compendium: Directory on the People’s Museums and other cultural spaces\n\nOutreach Activities Projects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe ICH Division has initiated a project on creating a Directory on the People’s Museums and other cultural spaces, which are intensively involved in safeguarding the living intangible cultural traditions, and reviving the traditional arts and crafts of varied ethnic communities residing in remote areas of North-East India.\n\nIn this regard multiple visits have been made to Sikkim, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.\n\nThis project is ongoing.\n\nCultural Mapping of the Khiamniungan Nagas\n\nCultural Mapping\n\nThe INTACH Nagaland chapter prepared an exhaustive report on the Khiamniungan Nagas for the ICH Division. An attempt to document the heritage, traditions and living culture of the tribe, the report focuses on their daily activities, customs, marriage systems, birth rituals, folklores, ornaments, performing arts, religion, tattoo traditions, crafts, textiles andmuch more. The Khiamniungan-Naga make up one of the sixteen tribes of Nagaland, who inhabit the sub-divisional headquarter of Noklak under the Tuensang district of Nagaland.\n\nAn enduring and profound signature in the cultural heritage of the Khiamniungan is the “log drum”. An intrinsic symbol in every village Khel, it is usually in the possession of the Khel for decades, sometimes even generations before it is replaced due to damage. Some of the festivals of the tribe have also been documented like the yahpong festival, khaolsaose-Hoka festival and many more. The folklores, myths and superstitions of the tribe are also featured in this study.\n\nCultural Mapping of Apatani Tribe, Arunachal Pradesh\n\nCultural Mapping\n\nThe state of Arunachal Pradesh in India is a land of diverse ethnic communities and cultures. It hosts at least 26 major tribes and several hundred sub-tribes and is said to be the most linguistically rich state in the country with over 90 different dialects. Arunachal Pradesh largely remains on the fringe of mainstream documentation and study as a result of its remote location, difficult terrain and an inaccessible topography. Thisstudy looks at one particular tribe in the state, the “Apatanis” whose crafts, traditions, beliefs and skills have survived over centuries but are now threatened by the effects of modernity, globalization and cultural assimilation.\n\nThe Apatanis are found in the Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh. The District is named after the Subansiri River, atributary of the Brahmaputra. The Lower Subansiri District presents a mosaic of various different cultural traditions of the many tribes that live there. It is divided into three sub-divisions, namely Ziro, Raga and Yachuli. The Apatanis are mainly found in the Ziro valley which is also known as the Apatani valley. The valley has very fertile land and is covered with bamboo groves and dense blue pine trees. Besides the Apatanis we also find the Nyishi, Hill Miri and Tagin, and interaction amongst these tribes has resulted in the formation of a unique mega-cultural landscape in the region.\n\nPeople of the Apatani tribe identify themselves as Tanii. Like the other tribes in the region, the Apatanis claim to be the descendants of the legendary ancestor Abo-Tani. They believe in the Donyi Polo, the worshipper of the Sun and Moon, and also in numerous sylvan deities. A small number of Apatanis also converted to Christianity over the years. It is important to note that the Apatanis do not have a script of their own and their material culture, made out of wood and bamboo, is easily perishable. In a scenario where there is no written script or archaeological findings to be preserved, it becomes necessary to understand the intangible cultural heritage which is still being orally transferred from generation to generation by members of the tribe. These oral narratives have been documented so that their traditional practices such as rituals, knowledge systems, festivals, traditional crafts and ethnic cuisine can be preserved for the posterity.\n\nCultural Mapping and Audio-Visual Documentation of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Varanasi\n\nCultural Mapping Projects Research and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nVaranasi, one of the most ancient cities of the world, is a repository of cultural heritage resulting from the continuous historical events of invasions and inhabitations, secular and spiritual inﬂuences, each carrying with it a plethora of both intangible and tangible properties, social contracts and related norms of knowledge, traditions and customs. Kashi, Banaras or Varanasi assumes a complex identity that has resulted from the collective memory of generations of communities settled here, and the multi-dimensional cultural constructs accommodated by the city over the ages. The steadfast river Ganga, the famous galis, the magniﬁcent ghats, the countless temples, kunds and places of religious interest, the historic Banaras Hindu University, the sadhus and their varied cults, the profound and overwhelming theories of life and death, the commerce, craftsmanship and culinary treats, the vitality of the Banaras gharana and its exponents in the field of music and dance, all add up to give Varanasi its special place in the scheme of things.\n\nUnder the guidance of Ms. Nerupama Y. Modwel, the two researchers from ICH division, Ms. Gunjan Joshi and Ms. Nishtha Gorke, collected information/data during numerous visits to Varanasi between October 2015 to March 2017. Numerous local people were interviewed for their views and personal stories. The conceptual framework spanned extensive interviews with community members, knowledge/wisdom holders, and representatives from cultural and educational institutions, craftsmen, performance artists, personal and individual data, such as family histories and photographs, the dynamic and sometimes indeﬁnable social assets of cultural heritage. Additionally, nuances of city life were observed and captured through videos, photographs and spontaneous interactions which revealed memorabilia accumulated through generations and stored in various forms by those who settled here.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, categories were created to document the intangible inheritances found in the city and the in house publication categorizes this collected data under the following themes:\n\nTraditional knowledge\n\nArt and craft\n\nCuisine\n\nOral traditions and Performing arts\n\nFairs and festivals\n\nGhat and Ganga rituals/other practices\n\nThis exhaustive study is not only relevant to study the present condition, transformations and transitions of the varied ICH found in the city, but also tries to bring multiple cultural facets under the umbrella of ICH. The cultural mapping of the city, revealing the multiple layers of its intangible heritage, has been attempted by the division and presented in this publication. A mix of primary and secondary data, this publication would be helpful to gain insight of the mixed culture of the city and can be used as a starting point for further study by researchers. As part of the project a 2017 calendar was inaugurated on INTACH’s foundation day. A short video documentation and a tourist brochure cum map have been created as well.\n\nICH Documentary : ‘LIFE IN A FISTFUL OF RICE’\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe ICH Division undertook a project on Documentation of Rice culture in Northeast region of India. For this, three states namely; Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland were chosen for the research and documentation. The imagination, cultivation, economy, and consumption of rice is constitutive to the cultural identity of communities across India. The ICH Division undertook an audio-video documentation of the intangible, cultural and material aspects of rice cultivation and its significance in various aspects of life in different regions of the Northeast, with special emphasis on Nagaland, Meghalaya and Assam along with a publication (under process) for the same. The above documentary was entered for various international film festivals in the coming year. The six months of dedicated primary and secondary research and hard work reaped along with the rice of the region!\n\nDue to the collective and wholehearted efforts of a young and talented Mr Tashi Gyamba (filmmaker) and his team and guidance and mentoring from Ms Nerupama Y. Modwel (Director, ICH) and Mr Surajit Sarkar (Associate Professor & Coordinator, Centre for Community Knowledge, Ambedkar University, Delhi) the result has been a well-made documentary. The documentary has entered for various international film festivals.

Also, any documentary/video-audio needs to be passed by the CBFC before it gets screened into the public domain.\n\nLifestyle of Sedentarised Nomadic Gujjars of Jammu Plains\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe Project was initiated by the Jammu Chapter to document the Lifestyles of Gujjar Community with the aim to assess and understand the lifestyle, socio-economic status of Dodhi Gujjars of Jammu plains. The Gujjars are originally a nomadic pastoral tribe.\n\nThe dodhi Gujjars or Banhara Gujjars mainly rear buffaloes and migrate shorter distances of about 50 kms from their base. Their animals are bulky, requiring good quantity and quality of fodder and sufficient water. A few of them also supplement their income from agriculture and forestry. During the summer months, Dodhi Gujjars migrate to Jammu from the adjoining state of Punjab for grazing purposes.\n\nThey are exclusively engaged in milk production and rearing livestock. The economy of Gujjars depends on cattle rearing while a few are also involved in agricultural activities. Very few of them own cultivable lands. This study throws light on the importance of livestock in the lives of these tribal communities. They store milk everyday and then convert it into butter/ ghee, cheese, milk bread known as Kalaris and then sell this to many Halwais (Confectioners). The economy is totally dependent on milk products.\n\nGujjars are quite hospitable and well –cultured. Known widely for their nationalistic spirit, Gujjars follow their own kinship and tradition. Gujjars of Jammu plains have maintained their own culture and linguistic identity. The tribal community has an exquisite tribal way of dressing style for both men and women. They wear colorful turbans with a unique style of wraping which is a mark of the Gujjar community.\n\nTraditional family practices of DERAS among Gujjar tribe\n\nThe Gujjar have divided themselves into three principal social kinship groups:\n\nThe dera(household)\n\nDada –Porte(Lineage), and the Gotra (clan)\n\nKunmbha\n\nThe Gujjars of the entire state of jammu and Kashmir speak Gojri which is considered an Indo- Aryan language. Linguists have traced the origin and practice of Gojri language to the BC era. The language is closest to Dogri, Pahari, Punjabi and Haryanvi. The Gojri speaking people constitute the third largest linguistic group of Jammu and Kashmir after Kashmiri and Dogri speakers.\n\nGojri has as strong tradition of folk and oral-lore which includes folksongs, ballads, folk tales, proverbs, children’s literature etc. Taja, Noora, Meerian Dhandi, Bharisyoe, Noor Beguma, Munshi (Qanchi) are the top ballads of bravery and valour of Gujjars.\n\nBait is the most important Gojri Sufiyana music and is sung in beautiful vales, forests and meadows. Bait is simply vocal music with no instrument used. The Bait comprises of poetry based on love, ethos, mysticism and some glimpses of philosophy.\n\nGujjar community has been expert at embroidery which is quite evident from the embroidered Gabbahs, Namdahs or Maatu(mattress) or the embroidery on blankets. Crotchet work is done with wool; glass or plastic beads woven with thread as jewellery, and colourful threads worn with the religious Tabeez are amongst the many examples of the artistic expression of the Gujjjar Community.\n\nICH Documentation Project: Thateras of Jandiala Guru\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe project on the Documentation of the Thateras was taken up by the Punjab Chapter with the aim to document the Craft: as a Living Cultural Heritage of Jandiala Guru. The tradition of Thateras and their craft is a magnificent journey of place and people in and through time. The tradition of the art and craft is called ‘Living tradition’ as it is expressed through the knowledge system transmitted from generation to generation and its products are continually relevant to the people through generations. The craftsmen living in Jandiala have been doing this work for the last eight or more generations.\n\nCraft, Industry and Market:\n\nThe work of Thateras is categorized as a small – scale industry and the craft as a cultural heritage. Hence the raw material and its products are taxed on the pattern of small scale industry. It affects the work negatively as the utensils become costly and do not sell. The work of the craftsmen is further affected by the presence of the middle man or the local distributor as the profit is shared by him. The operation of this ‘small scale industry’ is two –tiered which doubles the exploitation of the craftsmen and the benefit of the middle man. Since most craftsmen do not have enough capital to buy the raw material, they remain dependent on the distributor who provides them metal by weight and takes back the finished product by weight not by number of units produced by them as if it were also the raw material without any value addition. Hence the need to promote this work as a skilled craft.\n\nIndigenous Practices of the Tribes of Palani Hills\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nThe INTACH Kodaikanal chapter with the support of ICH Division undertook a project on – ‘the people of Palani hills’. The report for the same was submitted. The report has been written by Ms. Nishita Vasanth and Priyashri Mani, INTACH Kodaikanal. It is a well written account of various aspects covered under the project with special reference or focus on the intangible cultural heritage (ich) elements of the people of Palani hills.\n\nThe areas covered under this report include the details of the origin and historical evolution of the people of Palani hills, their livelihood, sustenance strategies, their heritage and traditional practices. The communities which have been covered under this project include the indigenous Paliyans and Puliyans, the Mannadiars, Arunththiyars, Aasaris, Telugu Chetniks, PirimaliKallars, Sri Lankan repatriates and others. The report is illustrated with important maps, images, datasheets strategically placed, to help the reader in understanding the complexities revolving around the subject. Not only has data from various relevant organisations has been procured and used but there is data collated on ground (over an eight month period 60 villages were studied) through personal interviews, videos and photo documentation.\n\nIn the chronological order of study, the report describes the Dolmen people; the earliest inhabitants of this place. This was followed by a study of Paliyans – the hunter-gathering community and the Puliyans. The Paliyans celebrate ‘Boothanacciamman Festival’ a dance festival which goes on till late night. The Paliyans and other communities too share similar cultural traits. There is folklore about the origin of Puliyans and formation of ‘Periyur’ (big village). It is related to ‘ManjamNeeradumVali’ spring incident which led to the formation of various communities. The report has several other references to folklore, customs and rituals of several other communities.\n\nCultural Mapping of the Kannauras of Himachal Pradesh\n\nCultural Mapping Projects\n\nA project on the Cultural mapping of the Kannaura tribe was undertaken by the ICH division in collaboration with the Tribal Fund. Inhabiting the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, often referred to as the ‘land of gods’, Kannaura is one of the tribal communities of the state.\n\nThe Kannaura are proficient in handicraft making. There are a number of artisans in the region who are following their traditional means of livelihood. The garments worn by the people are locally woven, and the style of clothing has remained unchanged. Their beautiful weaving represents the various religious symbols of Lamaism.\n\nSilver is used extensively by the community for making their ornaments. During marriage and other festivities one can find Kannaura women heavily decked up with approximately 3 kgs of silver jewellery. The statues of the deity are also often made up of silver, and this art of making statues of the deities is prevalent in Kinnaur. Kannaura people are known to have maintained their identity till date. Although many of their religious practices are intact, changes have started taking place in the traditions and cultural practices of the community.\n\nListing of ICH of Lucknow\n\nResearch and Documentation of ICH Elements\n\nThe Lucknow Chapter of INTACH undertook a project on Listing of Intangible Heritage of Lucknow.

So far many pins have been added and updated to the map which includes a series of 32 street signs with descriptions of how those streets were named, descriptions of built heritage, descriptions of intangible heritage which includes important and interesting information about festivals, local knowledge and craftsmanship.\n\nThe pins added to the map include for example:\n\na series of 32 street signs with descriptions of how those streets were named. For example:\n\nRue Francois Martin: Governor General Francois Martin is considered to be the ‘founder of Pondicherry’ where he settled as early as 1673, as its first administrator. He was made the first governor general in 1699 and Pondicherry was established as the headquarters of French India in 1701. The urban character of the city began to evolve after he implemented a grid patterned Dutch town plan. Indian weavers and artisans came to settle in Pondicherry due to his initiatives, making it a flourishing trade centre.\n\ndescriptions of built heritage:\n\nthe V.O.C.

It was brought to the Villiyanur Commune four generations ago when weavers migrated from Thekkal and Chidambaram, and it is now also practiced commonly in the Kaikalpet, Vanniyar, Rauther and Thuluva Vellalar communities. Across India, mats are weaved with a variety of materials, including jute, coir and bamboo, but in Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu in particular, the kora grass is used. Kora grass grows wild along water bodies and is abundant along the Gingee river and the Kombakkam Lake. The harvested grass is split into two and dried in the sun, which gives it a pale yellow color. Some of the grass is dyed in different shades, which is then woven with the natural grass in patterns of stripes, checks, or floral designs. The craft is traditionally practiced by women in rural communities, and those in Pondicherry work with co-operative societies to purchase the grass at a subsidized rate.
