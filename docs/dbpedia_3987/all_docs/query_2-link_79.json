What makes them different is the intricacy and the story behind the designs that make them unique to each culture and tradition of every country. Jewelry is a universal adornment to enhance one's beauty. It was also a form of currency, status symbol, and even a tool for everyday lives. Some traditional jewelry was also used as a source of power or for protection, more for their ethereal use rather than for aesthetics.\n\nEach country has its own distinct traditional jewelry that speaks about its history and culture.
