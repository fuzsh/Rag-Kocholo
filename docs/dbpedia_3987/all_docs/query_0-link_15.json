He may well be the most covered poet in the Persian language. Nor is there a dearth of work on him in other languages; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s admiration made Hafez an important figure in international literature in the early 19th century. Authors in Great Britain have since penned many commentaries in the English language. Even in the United States, Hafez has been noted in some detail by Ralph Waldo Emerson and, in our time, by more recent scholars. He has also been incorporated into the cottage industry of “Sufis” in this country that grew mostly around Rumi, another medieval Persian poet.\n\nThis embarrassment of riches begs the question: why another study? The answer, paradoxically, is in what gave rise to the question itself. There are so many, often conflicting, views on Hafez that sorting them out eventually leads one to the imperative of reading Hafez anew and interpreting it for oneself. Granted, the conclusion will share many parts from the results of others’ earlier efforts. The selection of those agreeable parts, however, is an exercise of an independent labor. The outcome, composite as it may be, will be gratifyingly unique and personal.\n\nThe process of selection in any research mitigates the goal of objectivity. The investigator’s mark is indelible. Ideally, one hopes to pursue inductively, avoiding deduction from any presupposition about Hafez. Subjectivity, however, continues in the selection of sources and beyond.\n\nThere seems to be no disagreement that reliable sources on Hafez are exceptionally limited. This makes Hafez’s own words virtually the ultimate source about him and his thoughts, reducing the problem of subjective selection among sources.\n\nBut interpreting those words again brings the problem of subjectivity into the study. To begin with, converting poetic language into evidentiary material for explanatory exposition of what Hafez said is hazardous. Poems are the distillation of the complex combination of various, sometimes clashing, emotional responses of a skillful bard.\n\nIn Hafez’s case the problem is confounded because in any of his ghazals (odes) which generally consist of 8 lines, every line potentially contains an idea independent of the other lines. An ode, therefore, does not necessarily, develop a unified idea or ideas. Furthermore, Hafez’s ghazals are not organized sequentially, either in the chronological or logical progression of thoughts. Rather, the compiler, who was not Hafez himself, organized the ghazals on the basis of the letters in the ending word of the lines. The interpreter of Hafez has no choice but to organize the poems, as well as individual lines, in sequences not ordained by the poetbut by his own choice to make the sense that he offers.\n\nTherefore, the best that can be hoped is a diligent and disciplined effort to produce an objective and inductive interpretation of what Hafez said. An interpretation, even that faulty, is still worthwhile, because the alternative is to leave the collection as others had compiled it which still needs to be subjectively interpreted by the reader. Even in that case, this work can be useful as an introduction to Hafez.\n\nI. Legends\n\nMost Popular\n\nThe 14th century Hafez is generally believed to be Iran’s most popular poet. In the pantheon of the four leading Persian poets of all time – which include the 10th century epic poet Ferdowsi, the 13th century philosophically profound Molavi (Rumi) and the wise poet Sa`di- Hafez is the supreme lyrical poet {Y; Fo:17; D:596}. His poems are venerated by Muslims, Christian, Jews, and secular non-believers alike. Many of them are memorized and recited in casual conversation. By one estimate, some 700 lines his poetry (or roughly more than 18% of all his nearly 40,000 lines of output) are repeated so often that they are used as adages and proverbs {R:684-719}.\n\nReasons\n\nWhile repetition perpetuates the popularity of Hafez’s poems, their welcome reception is due to the fact that the sound of Hafez’s language is especially pleasing to Persian ears. As a maidservant succinctly put it: “the words have been banging on my ears all my life and I love their sound {Av2:x}.” There is another, rather unique, major reason for Hafez’s popularity. His Divan is widely consulted by Iranians in bibliomancy for divination (fal-e Hafez); belief in his inspired predictions encouraged by many stories which have given him the sobriquet the Tongue of the Unseen (lesan-al- gheyb) [1]. This despite the fact that Hafez in the Divan explicitly says that: “No one knows the secrets of the Unseen (gheyb) {K114:8}.” [2]; and: “It is not known what the painter of the Unseen has done on the canvas of mysteries {K134:5}.” His book remains a favorite guide to future action.\n\nEvolution\n\nHafez boasted that he was a famous poet in his time {K240:11) as his poems were widely read and admired in Hejaz and Iraq {K253:7), Egypt, China, Rum, and Rey {K421:12). He claimed that Kashmiris and Samarqandis danced to Hafez’s poems {K431:9}. Three contemporary poets mentioned Hafez in their works: Rooh `Attar, Kamal al-Din Khojandi and Jamal al-Din Abu Eshaq {Gh: (pages) lo, lez, let}.\n\nA contemporary of Hafez, Mohammad Golandam, has said that Sufis danced to Hafez’s poems {S:662}. On the other hand, Hafez refused Golandam’s urging that he should collect his poems, giving as the reasons “the inappropriateness of circumstances and the treachery of the people of his time {S:662}. Hafez, in his Divan, complains that “the sorrow of this base world (gham-e roozegar-e doon)” killed his natural eloquence {K406:7}. In another poem, he wonders why he is not appreciated {K462:4}. Indeed, it was rumored that popular feeling against him at his death was so strong -due to accusations of heresy and even of atheisms- that religious authorities denied him the rites of burial until they were persuaded that in some poems, he proved that he was indeed a believer {Be:36-37}. The first dome-like structure over Hafez’s grave was not built until 1452 (856 H), some 60 years after his death [3]. In comparison, the tomb of his fellow poet from Shiraz, Sa`di, had become a shrine soon after his death, according to the Arab traveler, Ibn Batuta, who visited Shiraz at the time {Be:169]\n\nBeginning some 20 years after Hafez’s death, manuscripts of his poems were produced in Shiraz, both excerpted for anthologies of oblong (safineh) and rectangular (jong) formats and collected as an independent Divan of over 400 odes (ghazals). These were done by professional calligraphers and illuminators, for highly placed patrons [4]. Mohammad Golandam’s collection of Hafez’s works into a Divan is said to have been finished around 22 years after Hafez’s death [5].\n\nA metal jug (mashrabeh), dated 866 /1461-62, with verses of Hafez on it and other similar metalwork vessels, including a wine bowl (badieh)produced in Khorasan, the province of Iran northeast of Shiraz, are among the earliest evidence of the spread of the poet’s audience beyond his hometown. The reference of those verses to the act of drinking indicates that Hafez was known for his wine-drinking poems {So}.\n\nFurther east, in today’s Afghanistan, the prominent Persian Sufi poet, `Abd al-Rahman Jami, writing in 1478, maintained that Hafez’s Divan was among the best books that a Sufi could read [6]. The scenes of gatherings in mosques or taverns dominate the illustrations of many copies of Hafez’s Divan produced in Shiraz in the 16th century. By the 17th century, the illustrators turned to studies involving couples, usually a mature man and a youth {So}. In lands east of Iran, however, mystical commentaries on the Divan were the major development. The most important of these was the one written in the 17th century in India by `Abd al-Rahman “Khatmi” Lahuri {Ig} [7].\n\nMarginal notes on an older manuscript of the Divan by India’s Mughal rulers Homayun (1508-1556) and Jahangir (1569-1627) indicate that it was used for bibliomancy {Me}. Hafez’s popularity increased in India during the Mughals’ rule. Kashmir became a major center for production of his Divan in the late 18th century {So}.\n\nThe Mughals court hosted several great Persian poets at this time [8]. On the other hand, no notable major poets existed in Iran under the contemporaneous Safavid rulers (1524-1722). Focusing on the propagation of the Shiite doctrine, the Safavid Kings intentionally injured and harmed poetry, as well as Sufism [9]. The same dearth of great poets in Iran continued into the Qajar Dynasty period (1722-1925) {B}.\n\nThe literary language of Iran became fixed by Hafez’s time. As a result, his ghazals appear as though they were written yesterday {B}. In the last four centuries lines from Hafez’s Divan were incorporated in popular ballads (tasnifs) which are simple love-songs {B} They have become uniquely important in both tasnif and avaz (vocal section of a musical mode) parts of traditional Persian music, more often sung than the ghazals of any other poet {L1}. In the Qajar era a new gusheh (corner, piece) in the mode of mahur, named saqi-nameh, was created for performing selected lines of Hafez’s other poems, saqi-nameh (book of the cupbearer) and moghanni-nameh (book of the singer) {L1}.\n\nII. Literature\n\nSources\n\nHistorically, no standard procedure existed for publishing a Persian poet’s work in written form. The lyric poems such as ghazals were not routinely collected in Divans. A Divan was only a selection of poems compiled for a specific purpose, usually for presentation to a patron or for circulation among friends {Me}.\n\nANTHOLOGIES\n\nNo collection of Hafez’s poems existed at his death, as Moḥammad Golandam reported; he gathered and recorded Hafez’s scattered ghazals {Me}. In fact, the earliest stages of the “publication” of Hafez’s poems were mainly in the form of excerpts in Persian anthologies {Me}. These were “Memorials of the Poets (Tazkareh-nameh) [1],” books which aimed at providing samples of the poet’s work for various reasons. They were in vogue especially during the reign of the Timurids (15th and 16th century) who patronized the arts of the book {Me}. Notable among such Memorials that covered Hafez was Dawlatshah Samarqandi’s* Tazkerat al-Shoʿara (Memorial of Poets) [2]. Completed in 1486, it consisted of specimens of some 150 poets with their biographies and some historical information [3]. This and other similar works, such as anthologies of poets found in Moḥammad Khwandamir’s Habib al-Siyar (The Friend of Biographies), finished in 1524 [4], suffer from reflecting the general perception of the poets and their works in later era, and often couching historical events in apocryphal anecdotes { KEIr1}\n\nMANUSCRIPTS\n\nIn 1501, on the order of the Timurid ruler of Herat (Khorasan), Faridun ibn Hosayn Mirza Bayqara, a version of Hafez’s Divan (a collection of all of his poems) was prepared based on over five hundred copies of different numbers of his poems {Me}. The earliest copy of Hafez’s poems to be identified so far is a manuscript dated 1401 with 127 ghazals attributed to Hafez {Me}. Another manuscript, dated 1424, however, is considered far more reliable. It has 496 ghazals, as well as other poems by Hafez: qat`eh (fragment), masnavi (didactic poems in couplet form) and roba’i (rubai/quatrain). It is now known as “the Kalkhali Manuscript [5]. After the Bayqara compilation in the 16th century, the efforts to collect Hafez’s poems continued mostly outside of Iran, especially in Mughal India and Ottoman Turkey. In the 18th century Kashmir emerged as a major center for production of manuscripts of Hafez’s work {So}.\n\nMany lithographs of the Divan were published in various cities of India — Bombay, Calcutta and Lucknow– as well as Istanbul, Turkey. Not until 1838 was one produced in Iran. The first printed edition of Hafez’s Divan was published by the East India Company in Calcutta 1791. The first printed edition to be published in Iran dates to 1937, by Ḥosayn Pezhman Bakhtiari. However, a lithographed edition of the Divan by a Persian author, Moḥammad Qodsi Ḥosayni Radfar, which was produced in Bombay, remained the most popular in Iran {KELr2}.\n\nAUTHENTICATION\n\nMoḥammad Qazvini is considered the pioneer in establishing the tradition of critical editions of Hafez’s poetry in Iran. The Divan of Hafez (Divan-e Khawjeh Shams al-Din Moḥammad Ḥafez-e Shirazi) which he published, with the help of Ghasem Ghani, in 1941 marked a turning-point in the history of the authenticated editions of the collection. It is still accepted as one of the best. That work was based on collating the 1424 Khalkhali Manuscript with 17 later manuscripts {KELr2}.\n\nIn recent years scholars have discovered other old manuscripts of Hafez’s poems. Accordingly, Parviz Natel Khanlari has since published several editions of Hafez’s ghazals. The first was based on an anthology from 1410 collated with three later manuscripts. The second edition was based on fourteen old manuscripts, dating from 1404 to 1432. This edition of the Divan was later revised and reprinted. It is now generally used in scholarly writings on Hafez [6]. This has not stopped the publication of new versions of Hafez’s works. Indeed, the version that enjoys perhaps the widest popularity is Ahmad Shamlou’s [7]. Shamlou did not mention the manuscripts he used {KELr2}. In 1993, Hushang Ebtehaj, with the pen name of Sayeh, published his noteworthy version of the Divan [8] which was based on collating thirty manuscripts, most the same as those used by others but with the difference that he would not necessarily give preference to the older manuscripts, arguing that their dates indicated only when they were copied, not the original date of compilation {KELr2}.\n\nThe establishment of an absolutely reliable text of Hafez’s poems may be impossible as there are still, by some estimates, 1,000 known but unexplored manuscripts of the Divan in Iran and other parts of the world, and perhaps two or three times that many that are as yet unknown {Me}.\n\nOn the other hand, the versions accepted as most reliable do not show great differences. For example, a comparison of Khanlari’s version with Qazvini-Ghani’s shows that Khanlari’s total of 484 ghazals apparently only includes a handful ghazals not found in the Qazvini-Ghani’s, while omitting an equally small number of the ghazals contained in the latter.\n\nThe Work\n\nThere is no indication that any major part of Hafez’s poetic output has been lost {Br}. By far the largest part of his Divan consists of ghazals which, usually, are lyrical poems of 7 to 12 lines. Hafez’s fewer than 500 ghazals are substantially smaller than the number of ghazals produced by his contemporaries, such as Kamal Khojandi who, like Hafez, specialized in the ghazal, and Khwaju Kermani and Salman Savaji {Me}.\n\nHafez’s legacy in other forms of poetry is considered of less importance than his ghazals. Some of his qasayed (plural of qasideh) or odes, and qat`eat (plural of qat`eh) or fragments, help to elucidate his ghazals. He also wrote a few masnavis {S:609-612}.The authenticity of the rubais (quatrains) {S:643-651} , attributed to him have been seriously challenged {Br}.\n\nHafez’s saqi-nameh {S:613-617} [9], is a poem in couplet form about wine and drinking which is popular and sung in traditional music in Iran {Y}. Although features of saqi-nameh existed in Persian poetry for a century before Hafez [10], Hafez is credited with establishing it as an independent genre {Lo2}.\n\nThe Man\n\nLittle reliable information exists about Hafez’s life. The brief references in anthologies are often purely fictitious. The veracity of reporting by Mohammad Golandam, in the preface to the Divan he compiled, is suspect in view of many scholars {KEIr1}.Conjectures derived from Hafez’s poems are often based on overly literal reading {KEIr1}. Yet, these three groups are the best among sources available. According to them, the following sketch may be drawn of the man.\n\nHafez’s name was Shams al-Din Mohammad. He was born in 717/ 1317 {Gh:354} [11], and died in 792/1390. His pen-name, Hafez, refers to his knowing the Koran (Qur’an) by heart {KEIr1}. He studied Koranic disciplines and Arabic, which were the curriculums of the time, under Qavam al-Din `Abdullah Shirazi [12]. He was especially well acquainted with Kashshaf, the iconic scholarly book of learning about the Koran [13].\n\nHafez was a poor man. He depended on the patronage of the rulers and their ministers, although he could have also had some earnings by reciting the Koran for others. He witnessed the political turmoil and fluctuating fortunes of the last Inju King and the following six Muzaffarid rulers of Shiraz. He may have had a son {Kq281,2} [14]. There is no information about other members of his family, if any, or his parents. He probably lived a life alone. He probably spent all of his life in Shiraz [15]; he might have travelled briefly to Yazd.\n\nIII. Interpretations\n\nHafez Studies\n\nCritical studies of Hafez and his poetry have proliferated in Iran during this generation [1]. It is a phenomenon which has generated another: a Hafez phenomenon. The application of modern, largely Western, methods of rigorous and meticulous investigation which aimed at an objective picture of Hafez have produced, instead, many Hafezes, each a refracted subjective perception of Hafez by different investigators. The investigators have been widely diverse in political, religious, moral and aesthetic predispositions. This was a result of the unusually fertile market place of ideas and in the freedom unleashed by historical events since 1941, when the two decades of autocratic rule by Reza Shah was ended by the World War Two Allies occupation of Iran.\n\nMohammad Qazvini’s1941 seminal edition of the Divan was the product of a scholar who “superimposed” on the foundation of his “editorial practices of the traditional Muslim scholarship,” the “knowledge of European critical methods” which he had acquired in Europe, where he lived and edited ten such texts by various Iranian Poets from 1904 to 1939. He was closely associated with Edward G. Browne and R. A. Nicholson, British orientalists whose works have greatly influenced critical studies of Persian literature by Iranians {O2}.\n\nQazvini also wrote several important essays about Persian poets, but none on Hafez. It was his collaborator in preparing Hafez’s Divan, Qhasem Ghani, who produced, in 1942, the early seminal work on the history of Hafez’s times {Gh}. Before Ghani, the latest sources on Hafez by Iranian authors [2] were the two 19th century works by Reza Quli Khan Hedayat, Majmaʿ al-Fosaha (1871) and Riaz al-ʿArefin (1840s), which are considered “a final summation of the classical tradition of literary biographical dictionaries {Lo},” and the earlier tazkareh type 16th century* work by Qazi Seyed Nourallah Shoostari [3]. Another frequently used source was by an English author: Edward G. Browne, A Literary History of Persia (1908),* volume 3 of which covered 1265-1502, Hafez’s times [4]. It is “dense with nearly always accurate detail” and based almost entirely on original sources (many of which were at that time accessible only to Browne himself) {W}.” It appeared in English in 1920 and was later translated into Persian.\n\nThe renovation project of Hafez’s tomb which began in 1935 generated renewed interest in Hafez. A number of scholars published works lauding the poet. Many of them regarded Hafez as a Sufi, or at least a free-thinking mystic, in a positive light {Ri}. There were other intellectuals, however, who opposed Sufism {Ri}. Among them was Ali Dashti who wrote a book in 1936, exploring the art and meaning of Hafez’s poetry [5].\n\nIn1939, in an article, Mohammad Moin, who had the distinction of being the first PhD graduate in Persian literature from the University of Tehran, after having already studied “applied psychology, anthropology and cognitive science” in Belgium [6], “interpreted” Hafez, as a full-fledged Sufi, and even identified a specific person as his spiritual Guide (pir) [7]. In 1942, Ahmad Kasravi, a severe critic of Sufism, published his own book on what Hafez said {Ka1}. He saw Hafez as the example of socially useless poets who simply spun words to perfect the rhyme without providing any coherent or consistent worldview. He denounced Hafez as a kharabati (denizen of kharabat/ Sufi) who promoted a harmful hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, belittling reason and counselling the futility of human efforts {Ka1}.\n\nKasravi’s views on Hafez were already well known as he had discussed them in articles in his newspaper, Peyman, and, by implication, in his address on Sufi poetry at Tehran’s Anjoman Adabi (Literary Society) in 1935. They were rooted in his nationalistic Iranism (Irangari) and advocacy of a rationalist approach to modernize the country, based on kherad (reason). The other Iranian intellectuals whose writings on Hafez noted the Sufism in his poems positively, were no less eager to see Iran develop than Kasravi; they differed with him in that they found a source of national pride in Hafez and the Iranian version of Sufism which they called `Erfan (Gnosticism). Kasravi, however, viewed them as implementing the evil plan by the Orientalists, especially Edward G. Browne, to weaken Iran by spreading Sufism {Ri} [8].\n\nTwo other influential Iranian intellectuals of this time also opposed Sufism. One was Taqi Arani, the “intellectual initiator of the communist Tudeh Party {AA},” and the other was the widely read writer Sadeq Hedayat. Arani’s views were expressed in his magazine, Donya (the World) which he began in 1311/1933. A firm believer in the ideology of materialism, Arani, in an article entitled “`Erfan va Oṣul Maddi (Mysticism and Materialistic Principles),” argued that in times when mystic intuition dominated, science and hence human progress stagnated {AA). Sadeq Hedayat, who had been a student of the poet `Omar Khayyam for a long time, having written a critical essay on him in 1923 [9] – entitled Rubayyat (Quarain)-, considered Hafez as (the 11th-12th centuries) Khayyam’s most important follower {T:465}.\n\nEhsan Tabari agreed with Hedayat with respect to Hafez’s Agnosticism (shakkakiyat va la-edriyat) and Hedonism (shiveh-ye khoshbashi), but he found Hafez to be far more than simply a lyric (ghana’i) poet {T:465}. Tabari’s views were influential as he had become the heir to Arani, both as the editor of Donya and an intellectual leader of the communist Tudeh Party. He was also an admirer of Kasravi [10], and also of Hedayat’s writings. But considerably more than all those three (including Arani), Tabari was interested in the rich tradition of philosophy in Iran, which he explored in great depth during his 30 years of political exile while he received advance and doctorates degrees in philosophy, respectively, from universities in Moscow and Berlin. The results were published abroad during 1958-1968 in Donya, compiled in the book form in 1969 [11]. Tabari expressed his methodology as critical (scientific and historical), his approach as Marxist, humanist, Iranian and revolutionary. His three long articles on Hafez constitute 20% of that whole book, far more than any of the many other persons, events, and movements covered in the work he called the history of philosophy and social thoughts in Iran. He gives specific citations to Hafez’s poems to support his points.\n\nTabari concludes that Hafez’s “philosophy” is unique, special, and not easy to discover. It is different from the Hanafi and Shi`ah Islam, different from Sufigari (organized Sufism), and other schools of thoughts in Iran [12]. This, Tabari says, is the reason for Hafez’s “loneliness,” and for the extraordinary “feeling” in his poetry. But in our age, Tabari continues, Hafez’s philosophy is far more understandable. There is something new and contemporary in it. Iranians can be proud of Hafez, Tabari proclaims, no less than any other of their luminaries {T:504}.\n\nTo demonstrate that Hafez and Khayyam’ shared views on Agnosticism and Hedonism, Tabari chose the subjects of the denial of the eternal existence of the spirit (rooh), Resurrection, Heaven, and Hell. He said these are important because by expressing doubt about them, the poet in fact doubted one of Islam’s foundational principals: belief in the Resurrection (Mo`ad). Thus, the poet argued that the promises of religion about another life was vahi (an unfounded, chimerical hope) and that, therefore, we should value the life in this world, enjoy it and not fall in the trap laid by zohd (false piety), and hypocrisy of religious leaders who promoted ignorance {T:465}.\n\nTabari’s views were reflected in the writings of his followers in the Tudeh party. The poet Ahmad Shamlou echoed him when in the introduction to his 1975 book on Hafez, he referred to Hafez as one who denies Resurrection and openly confesses that he does not believe in Islam’s promises {Sh:25-26}. Shamlou was an immensely popular poet and his comments provoked strong reactions from the clerics in Iran. Their main response came from Morteza Motahari, in his 1978 book, The Causes of Attraction to Materialism, Addition to Materialism in Iran {Mo1} [13].In it, Motahari argues, on the basis of Mohammad Golandam’s saying, that Hafez was a great religious scholar and that he did not collect his poems because he was preoccupied with the teachings of Koran and practicing religious piety {D:586}.\n\nWhen this proved inadequate, another writer, Bahaʾ-al-Din Khorramshahi, took up the task by attacking Tabari’s views directly. He argued that Hafez’s skepticism (shakk) did not equal denial of Resurrection, citing his own choice of Hafez’s poems to prove his point {Kh1:215} [14].\n\nA prolific author with views on many aspects of Hafez and Divan, Khorramshahi ultimately sees Hafez as a creature of his immersion in the Koran, his thoughts and language (zaban va zehn) inseparably rooted in the Holy Book {D:588,595} [15].\n\nKhorramshahi has critiqued the works of many other contemporary writers on Hafez [16]. While any impression that Khorramshahi claims exclusive right to interpret Hafez for Koranic scholars like himself may be conjectural {D:586}, Morteza Motahari is not shy to claim such exclusivity for the `Orafa (Gnostics). This Gnosticism is a variant of Sufism which contemporary Shiite clerics of Iran accept, indeed honor, despite the fact that Sufism has often posed as an alternative to the clerics’ practice and even interpretation of Islam. In a series of talks, later published in 1358/1979, Motahari declared that only an `Aref (singular of `Orafa) who is also a literary scholar can explain Hafez {Mo2: 87-88} [17], because his Divan is “a Gnostic (`Erfani) book plus the technical aspect of poetry {Mo2:15}. “ Motahari said that Hafez was an `Aref who thought of himself as a “qualified (shayesteh) Sufi,” while Motahari considered the common “professional (herfe’i) Sufis of the poet’s time as “non-qualified Sufis {Mo2: 133}”. Motahari said the language of `Erfan is a special, coded (ramz) language and the key to these codes are given to us in some books {Mo2:11} [18].\n\nUnderstanding Hafez, Motahari said, is not in the capacity of a mere literary scholar (adib), who is not also an `Aref {Mo2:77-78}. Iranian literary scholars, on the other hand, have ignored such exclusion. Indeed, typically {Dd: xxxvi- xxxvii}, Ehsan Yarshater has said that claiming a mystical meaning for Hafez’s every single word is “utter absurdity” {Y}. Hafez’s language, he has argued, is transparent: while showing familiarity with Sufism as he was immersed in the culture of his time, it also described, for example, wine with the accuracy of a connoisseur. In short, Hafez was “a poet’s poet” {Y}.\n\nFor eminent contemporary Iranians poets being compared with Hafez is considered a great honor [19]. Some deem Hafez’s ghazals to be the zenith of poetry unattained by virtually no other Iranian poet [20].\n\nThe phenomenon of Hafez, thus, changes depending on the person creating it. It is the creature of the perception of the poet by critics of various backgrounds [21]. Ultimately, Hafez is the image in the mind of his reader. To understand him, and fathom his thoughts, one needs to read his poetry afresh for himself.\n\nArt\n\nIn contrast to the disagreements about the meanings of Hafez’s poetry, there is virtual unanimity on its artistic value. Even such a harsh critic of Hafez’s thoughts as Ahmad Kasravi concedes that the language of his poetry is sublime {Ka1} [22].\n\nGHAZAL\n\nThe discussion of the art of Hafez’s poetry focuses on his ghazals; his few poems in other genres are not considered significant {Y}. These ghazals are lyric poems of about 8 lines. The lines are held together by the same single meter and single rhyme, and sometimes, further, by a radif, which is a word or phrase ending the line. The mood of each ghazal is usually set by the first line, but the other lines may show other thoughts and sentiments.\n\nHafez’s ghazals appear designed to be sung as well as read{Y}. Euphonic effects such as alliteration and internal rhymes are numerous, which is a distinguishing feature of his poetical language {Br} [23]. Hafez’s intimate knowledge of the cantillation rules, as a reciter of the Koran, helped in harmonizing text with melody {L1}.\n\nHe uses repetition a lot, a method which is important in other Persian arts, like music [24]. In 98 percent of his ghazals, Hafez uses only 8 metrical patterns, three most frequently {Br} Deleted [21]. Ghazal was rooted in ancient minstrelsy {Br2}. By the 11th century when the ghazals became a prominent feature of literary life in Iran, they were closely associated with the arts practiced by minstrels and musicians {Br2} [25].\n\nHafez recommends that there should be music when drinking wine {K97:10}. In his Divan, there are at least 43 references to motreb and 7 times to moghanni (both generic nouns for musician or singer) {L1}, and a number of terms such as ahang, meaning melody, song, or music. Several musical modes are mentioned, including `Araq, Isfahan, and Hejaz {L1}. Songbirds are used to metaphorically represent the voice of human singers or lovers, especially bolbol (nightingale) { L1}.\n\nIn Hafez’s ghazals, chang (a kind of harp) is the most frequently mentioned instrument, followed by nay (flute) and several others – ʿud, rabab, daf, chagana– usually in contexts suggestive of merriment, and dance {L1}. Golandam reported that Sufis did Sama (dance) to Hafez’s musical poems {S: 66 2}.\n\nThe Arabic word ghazal, meaning spinning, with the figurative sense of flirting with women, over time came to be associated with erotic poetry {Br2}. It was mainly regarded as a type of oral poetry, not worthy of recording in writing. In Persian literature specimens of love poetry are attributed to the 10th century poet Rudaki. The earliest collection of Persian ghazals, however, dates to the 12th century Divan of the poet Sanai. Spreading to the works of other poets, ghazal reached its zenith with Sa`di (1210-1291) who perfected the formulation of its conventional motives. Hafez added little to what his predecessors accumulated in motives, themes and images, but he applied them with unpatrolled “density, verve and skill,” giving his ghazals a strong feeling of originality {Br2} [26].\n\nBy Hafez’s time, there were about 200 traditional poetic devices available. The Koran which was a major model used by Hafez employed some 100 of them. Hafez often uses only 7, the most important of them being tashaboh (analogy), tazad (opposites), and tanavvo` (diversity). Their function was to help create movement and harmony (mozoniyyat) in the poem {Es}.\n\nHafez also uses symbols and stylization, which were characteristics of Persian poetry and other arts, especially painting and music {Es}. Similarly, his poems are endowed with word-plays common to works of other Persian poets, especially, paronomasia or puns (jenas) and double entendre (eeham) {Br}.\n\nCOMPARISON\n\nSome experts maintain that the Koran was Hafez’s major poetic model {Es}. Hafez’s ghazals have ample implied, and sometimes explicit, references to poems of many major Persian poets, including Rudaki {K257, 461}[27], Nezami Ganjavi {K216, 460} [28], Anvari {R465}[29], and Molavi Rumi {K193,349} [30].\n\nMore than all of them, Hafez’s ghazals show the influence of Sa`di. That influence could be detected in the following ghazals: {K 117, 169, 181,183,188, 191, 216, 221, 226, 297, 308, 314, 318, 361, and 393} [31]. There are several key concepts used by Hafez which are also in Sa’di’s ghazals, such as: pesar (boy) {Fo : 427, 428}; riya, kharabat, zohd, mey, ab-e kharabat, tamat {Fo:794}. Mosharref al-Din Mosleh Sa`di (1210-12191) was also from Shiraz which venerated him by the time of Hafez [32]\n\nThe size of Hafez’s poetic output is dwarfed by that of other great Persian poets. Abu al-Qasim Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh had as many as 50,000 lines; Molavi Rumi’s collection of qhazals and quatrains in his Divan exceeds 40,000 lines, and his Masnavi had more than 25,577 [33]; and Sa`di’s Bustan, qhazals, and other poems combined total more than 15,000 lines {Fo}. Hafez spent more than forty years on about 4,000 lines of his some 500 qhazals, or roughly 10 poems a year. They are not arranged chronologically in his Divan [34], but the earlier poems, as indicated by historical clues in the content, equally the later ones in the polish of craftsmanship {Es}.\n\nThe horizon of the physical world which Hafez observes in these poems is exceptionally limited. It is almost exclusively two sites in his hometown of Shiraz, a few flowers and birds, only the season of spring. His descriptive observations become at times tedious. He reports almost nothing about the various interesting types of people who lived in the bustling environment of the center of international trade that Shiraz was at his time. He tells no stories other than brief reference to old legends. He is a biographer of his own introspection. Even his admirers admit that he has some, artistically, “weak” poems {Es}. But he also has many that are simply sublime.\n\nEhsan Yarshater, a doyen among scholars of Iranian literature, concludes “In no other Persian poet can be found such … a lyrical exuberance {Y}.” What distinguishes Hafez’s poems from the others’ is a combination of his apt choice of words, polished diction, and “silken melodious expressions{Y}.” Their appeal, however, cannot be searched by analyzing their various elements. Rather, it is due to his artistic gift, that ineffable, indiscernible thing, that “an” in Hafez’s word {K121:1}.\n\nTranslation\n\nHafez wrote in Persian, a language which, for poetic reasons, he also called Dari {K174, K10, K391:7, K443:12}[35], and Pahlavi {K477:1} which was the old language of Iran before the Arab domination. The Persian literary language in Iran had become fixed by Hafez’s time, so that his poems appear as though they were written today {B:122}. The transparency and lucidity of Hafez’s diction simply raised his natural use of the ordinary colloquial Persian to the high literary level {Y*; Av2:xxii}. He is understood by contemporary Persian speakers of our time [36].\n\nIn at least one Ghazal {K429:3}, Hafez has used some words in the old dialect of Shiraz {R:596}. Far more, his ghazals include macaronic poems (molam`at)* in which Persian and Arabic verses alternate {K416, K451, K452, K453, K454, K460}. There are also Arabic insertions, consisting of Koranic verses, pious proverbs and sayings, and lines of poetry {Br}. These which are not inconsiderable [37] were probably understood by the learned Persian in Hafez’s time -if not as much now. Hafez was aware, however, that a poet could best express himself in the language he knew best, although Arabic (Tazi) and Turkish (Turki) were also adequate languages for those who knew them {K467:7}. Scholars have treated the Arabic in Hafez’s ghazals as incidental inserts in Persian poems {Br}.\n\nHafez has said that knowing the Persian language is the prerequisite to appreciating his poems {K174:10}. Attempts at translating Hafez’s poems into other languages have been difficult. Since Sir William Jones’ first translation of some of Hafez’s poems into English toward the end of 18th century, A Grammar of the Persian Language (Oxford, 1771), his poetry has been translated into this language more than the poems of any other Persian poet. Yet, rarely, has “a glimpse of the rich clarity and vigorous beauty” of Hafez’s poems been shown to the English reader {Lol}.\n\nThere have been four main categories of translation of Hafez into English: (A) the literal prose [38]; (B) verse, by imitation of the meter, the rhyme or both [39], or in a more familiar English verse form [40], or free verse [41] ; (C) “imitation” and “creative translation” [42] ; and (D) scholar-translation [43].\n\nReaders in the United States had an early exposure to Hafez in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s translation of some 500 lines of his poetry in the 1850s [44]. Emerson’s translation was based on a German text, the 1812 translation of Hafez’s poems by the Austrian Von Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall. This was the first ever complete translation of Hafez’s Divan into a Western language. Hammer himself relied on three Turkish translations of Hafez [45]. Not only did this remove Hammer’s translation from the Persian original, but it was also colored by the views of at least one, the 16th century Sudi of Bosnia, whose Turkish translation was accompanied by his commentary. Indeed, it was this commentary that formed the basis of most European interpretations of Hafez {Ta}.\n\nHammer-Purgstall’s translation was greatly influential in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s understanding of Hafez {Ta}{{7]. The status that Goethe accorded Hafez in his 1819 West-östlicher Divan, a major work of German literature, made the Persian poet an important figure in the international literature {Ta} [46].\n\nThe translation of some 39 poems of Hafez by Gertrude Lowthian Bell, who knew Persian and spent time in Iran, is considered as the best by many British scholars {Be:15-16}. She readily acknowledged that Hafez’s poetry is “of a different age, a different race, and a different civilisation from ours.” Yet, she argued that “These are the utterances of a great poet, the imaginative interpreter of the heart of man; they are not of one age, or of another, but for all time [47].”\n\nWhat was elegant in Bell’s phrasing may sound a bit archaic now, more than a century later. Reza Saberi cures that problem for the contemporary readers in his 2002 book, The Divan of Hafez, A Bilingual Text, Persian-English (Lanham, Maryland). An experienced author in Persian, he also manages to be remarkably faithful to the language of Hafez. His fidelity remains throughout a book that covers all of Hafez’s poems.\n\nPrincipal Subjects\n\nHafez’s poems may be organized in the following general categories of subjects: love, wine-drinking, clergy, Islam, and Sufism.\n\nIV. Love\n\nCommon Themes and Figures\n\nMuch of Hafez’s poetry is about love. Nothing engages his passion more than describing love and beauty {Br}. The poet-lover is the central figure in a tale of trials and tribulations which includes an often reluctant, indifferent, and unfaithful {K205, K266} beloved, the warden of the beloved, who can turn into a rival (raqib), and the dispenser of advice against love. The major themes are the worshipful craving of the lover, the scandal of revealed love {K221}, the lover’s jealousy and fear of the other admirers of the beloved. These figures and themes are common to Persian lyrics {Y}.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nHafez says that the way to love is long and hard {K276:5). and that love is full of danger {K151:5}. To reach love one must have persistent will {K196:9} [1]. The absence of the lover is painful {K82:5, K88:1}. To love requires willingness to suffer {K155:4}. Patience and suffering because of separation are necessary to obtain love {K271:1,2}. Be happy even in missing the beloved {K192:9}. Sadness is a great gift of love {K396:5}. Hafez says his art needs the mirror of the beloved to show itself {329:8}. He is happy just that Shiraz is full of beautiful beloved, even though they are not his. {K329:5}. He says he cannot look at books when there is so much beauty to look at {K338:3}.\n\nI will always pursue love, Hafez says {K175:7}. What is the use of life if not to sacrifice it for the beloved {K231:5}? Age is immaterial: I am not old, Hafez say, if I am still a lover of a child {K325:5}. In old age, Hafez says: If the beloved comes, I will become young again {K232:1}. As he thinks about death, Hafez says he wants love at death and afterward {K328:1,4}.\n\nHafez says that understanding love is the height of knowledge {K56:5}. Love is hard to describe {K64:7}. All languages are the same in the matter of love {K467:7}. But love is not by words {K81:7}; it cannot be proven by words and logic {K90:5}. The knowledge of love is not found in books {K158:6}. No one becomes privy to secrets on the path of love; each makes his own conjecture {K121:7}.\n\nReason is not that helpful in treating the affliction of love {K462: 2}. Common physicians can not treat the pain of love; go “find a Messiah-breath type” person {K462: 8}.\n\nPhysical\n\nIn many of his poems, the love Hafez describes is physical love. He yearns for kissing and hugging the beloved {K161:6}. “To be with a beloved who has sweet lips and elegant stature/ Without kissing and embracing is not pleasant {K159:4}.” “My expectations are limited just to kissing and hugging the beloved {K435:4}.” In one poem he calls on the beloved: “Open your cloak’s knot, so that you may relieve my heart/For any relief I ever had was from being on your side {K204:6}.” In another poem, he describes how “a hundred beauties tore their collars enviously,” as his beloved walked by them {K415:1}. “May a thousand garment of virtue and cloak of chastity/Be sacrificed for the rent shirt of the beauties {K260:2}.” “My desire was for piety and safety/But that charming eye displays such coquetries that don’t ask {K266:5}.”\n\nOne cannot find love in the monastery, he says {K437:9}. Indeed, the “beauty” that is Hafez’s object of desire is sometimes simply one for the hire: “I, a beggar, fancy a cypress-statured one/Who cannot be embraced except with silver and gold {K219:7}.” He advises, pay the money and take a beauty: “Let silver go, and with gold, embrace one of silvery body {K252:6}.” He calls for an experienced, sly (`ayyar), lover, not a naïve simpleton {K244:6}. Hafez “is the lover of the face of a good-looking youth {K305:1}.”\n\nIn many poems Hafez describes the physical features of such a beloved. They include: tress {K:180:3}, face {K87:6, K107:3, 9}, lips {K206:1}, double-chin {K198:2}, eyebrows {K90:7}, eyes {K 48:6, K:165:7}, bare forearms, and alabaster legs {K202:8}, small mouth {K69:5}[2], and black mole {K83:1}.\n\nHafez does not name anyone as his beloved. In one poem, only, he refers to his beloved as “Farrokh” {K:95:1}. It has been suggested that Farrokh was the name of a male to whom Hafez was attracted [3]. In one poem, Hafez refers to his beloved as “ma`shouqeh” {K222:6}, a word which is feminine in Persian. In some other poems the word he uses is “ma`shouq”, which is generally the word for a male beloved but can also mean a female beloved -Persian is basically a genderless language. This has led a few to translate Hafez’s poems as though his beloved is female [4].\n\nIn all other poems, the beloved Hafez describes is often clearly a young male: “sweet boy (shirin pesar)” {K274:7}; “sweet boys’ lips (lab-e pesaran) {K414:4}; calling “boy (pesar)” to pour wine {K446:1}. The khat (downy hair on the jawline) that Hafez admires on his beloved {K275:5} is that of “a not yet hirsute adolescent boy” – an ephebe {Le2} [5].\n\nIn one poem, the beloved is referred to as javan (young man) {K139:3}. Other poems specify that Hafez likes his beloved to be a “14-year-old {K251:9, K284:3},” “a child {K284:2}”, “with the smell of milk on his lips {K284:4}.” He says I am not old if I am still the lover of “a child {K325:5}.”\n\nThe women beloved in Hafez’s ghazals are characters from legendary love stories of the Persian culture of his time – such as Layla and Majnun* {K341,K1,5}, Khosrow and Shirin {K466:2}, Shirin and Farhad {K309:3}, Golchehr and Orang {K336:3}, Zoleikha and Joseph {K3:6}, and Salmi (a beloved woman among the Arabs- {K261:2, K275:3} or they are allegorical religious figures such as hoor (black-eye woman of the heaven) and pari (fairy) {K404:6}.\n\nThe physical beauty that Hafez wants in his beloved is God-given, not the result of any make-up {K174:1}, or ornaments {K158:7, K169:6}. In addition, he requires much more than physical beauty in the beloved {K221:8}. He says love does not “arise” from appearance {K67:5}. We are focused on character (akhlaq) more than appearance of the beloved {K202:4}.\n\nSpiritual\n\nIn a number of poems, Hafez’s beloved is God. Hafez describes him as an anthropomorphic deity with human form, as well as emotions {K259:1,2,7; K309:10; K315:3}. This is the God that Islam introduces in its creation narrative. Hafez, rather, adopts him for his own “religion of love (mazhab-e `eshqh) {Ig:85}” [6].\n\nAs Hafez depicts it {K: 148:1}, on the day of creation, Pre-eternity (Azal), the light of God’s “Beauty manifested itself /Love appeared and set fire to the whole world.” The King of Azal gave us the “treasure of love’s sorrow” when we arrived in this world {K364:3}. “Man, and angles, are creatures of the existence of love {K443:1}.” Become a lover, Hafez says, or else you would not know the purpose for which you were created {K426:5}. Until you become Gnostic of love you won’t understand the secret of mysteries {K281:6}. Hafez says that on the day of creation he received a cup of “the wine of love (mey-e alast) {K: 144:5}” [7]. Alast (First) is another word for Azal [8]. In contrast to Sufis’ some`eh (convent), Hafez chooses to have the discourse of his religion of love in wine bars {K215:7; K208:1, 2}. The subject, he says, is beyond the understanding of school and rational discussion {K 208:3}. He adds, Mansur Hallaj (an iconic Gnostic) said it well that Shafe’i (an iconic jurisconsult) does not know the issues of love {K301:4}.\n\nDon’t disclose the secrets of love before rational people, Hafez says {K300:9}. When brain fails to explain things, love does it {K203:3}. The rational people (a`qelan) are at the center of the world but love knows that they are lost in this circle {K188:2}. “Angels do not know what love is {K260:3},” and Satan (Eblis) is a jealous “non-adept’ (na-mahram),” a “pretender (mudda`i),” as he “quarreled with God and thus is cursed with eternal separation from Him {Sgh:117}.”\n\nMan, on the other hand, accepted God’s call and entered into a covenant with him. This covenant was the promise by man to safeguard love, which God entrusted to him {K475:6} [9]. We came to this world carrying that burden of trust (bar-e amanat) as seekers of love {K359,1.2} [10].\n\nIt is a difficult journey for true lovers. Those who are always self-absorbed, are excused if they are not in love (444:1). “A dark night, fear of waves, and a maelstrom so forbidding! /How can the light-burdened of the shore know our plight {K1:5}?” The first rule on the journey of love is to be passionately insane, like the legendary lover Majnun (449:3). If you are a rational person, don’t mix with those who are crazy in love {K444:2}.\n\nHafez believes that for him being in love was not voluntary; it was an inherited gift of his “nature (fetrat)” {K306:5}. He spends his life taking steps to be fulfilled in loving God {K336:1}. Although he fears that He will not grant his wish, yet he imagines it and augurs it realization {K336:6}, trusting that there will be a happy ending {K336:4}. He asks God: “When will You have mercy on my frail life/He said: ‘When your life is not an obstacle between us’ {K301:3}.“ Thus, Hafez speaks of the Sufi “annihilation (fana)” [11]. That is the goal, which Mansur Hallaj attained on the gallows, and Hafez who aspires to it, has not yet reached: “Those who have attained their goal are at gallows like Mansur/When they call Hafez to this door, they drive him away {K189:6}.”\n\nOn the other side fana, after death, the journey for love continues, still full of dangers; you don’t escape because “your life ended {K307:5}.” Thus, Hafez implies that fana annihilates the body, while the spirit will continue to live [12]. In another poem, Hafez refers to spirit (rooh) as existing in the person while alive {K360:2}.\n\nV. Wine-drinking\n\nAfter love, wine drinking is the theme which appears the most in Hafez’s ghazals. His celebration of uninhibited and drunken revelry exceeded other Persian poets who had included bacchanalia in their works {Y}.\n\nReal\n\nThe wine Hafez speaks of is usually physical, with a few exceptions {Kh2:677-689}. It is not a symbolic construct of the imagination {L2}. He describes the wines in his poems as “the vine’s beautiful daughter {K257:6},” the fragrant and “rose-colored” wine {K257:4}, and “fiery water” {K259:3}. He declares his preference: “two-year wine” {K251:9}, intoxicating wine that can knock down a man {K273:1}. This is an earthy product.\n\nIn two poems, however, Hafez uses the term wine to mean the intoxicating drink (of love) God gave to man on the day of creation (day of Alast) {K:21: 1}, which Hafez calls the wine of Alast {K144:5}. In another poem, wine is called as the “intoxicating drink (badeh-ye mastaneh)” {K179:2} which some interpret as meaning “the drink of Gnosticism” {L2} [1]. On the other hand, in another poem, Hafez distinguishes his wine from the “heavenly wine (sharab-e kosar)” {K66:8}[2].\n\nReasons\n\nHafez seems to say that he became a wine-drinker, “on the path of love,” in reaction to the hypocrisy of the Sufis {K405:4} [3]. He asks for wine to wash away the dust of hypocrisy {K372:9}. Elsewhere, he says that during the reign of the ruler who forgave drinking as wrongdoing, in addition to Hafez, the Mofti, Sufi, Mohtaseb, Shaikh and Qazi all also drank wine. When he asked the old wine-seller about their drinking in secrecy, he was told to keep quiet and drink his wine {K280:1, 2,3,4} [4]. Hafez also says that destiny (taqdir) is responsible for his drinking {K337: 3}; it directs him toward the tavern {K314:5}. Elsewhere, he says he became a wine-drinker because of that beautiful beloved (hoor) {K321:2}.\n\nIllicit\n\nHafez implies that he repented from drinking before, but cannot keep such a promise {K322:7}. Elsewhere, he says he will not stop drinking: “I have repented a hundred times and will do not more (repenting) {K345:1}.” The Sufis and the likes have erased their drinking past, but his reputation for drinking, Hafez says, has lingered on {K175: 3,4}. He asks for a drink because Shaikh, Hafez, Mofti, and Mohtaseb all lie {K195:9}. For a draught of wine that harms no one, Hafez says, I have so much trouble from ignorant people {K266: 3}.\n\nHe guarantees that God’s mercy will extend to the sin of drinking {K422:9}. Even though drinking is a sin, Hafez says, one cannot lose hope of God’s grace {K453:4}. Indeed, in the Magians’ kharabat, Hafez, “surprisingly,” sees God’s light {K349:1}. He imagines a “wine-house of love (meykhaneh `esqh)” where Adam’s character was fermented {K194:6}.\n\nBenefits\n\nHafez resorts to wine to cope with problems facing him as a creature. The only medicine for the endless sorrow (gham) of the world is the purple wine, he says {K350:1}. He prescribes the wine cup as the dam against the drowning flood of sorrow {K124:8}. Bring wine for one cannot be safe from the heaven’s ruse and the plays of the lutist Venus and warrior Mars {K273:2}. In this world where all can easily be lost, worrying is not good, better drink wine {K365:3}.\n\nIn some poems, to fight sorrow Hafez calls for wine to bring about happiness, in the company of musicians and a singer {K470:4, 5, 6}. He seeks “the scent of life” from wine {K372: 1}. Such expectation of joy from wine, however, is minor compared to Hafez’s seeking to drown his sorrow by simply getting drunk (mast). Drench me in wine, he pleads, for I see no good in these circumstances {K287:3}. Make me so drunk that I would not be conscious of what is happening {K84:4}. Unless wine makes us forget the sorrow, Hafez says, our foundations will be destroyed by the dread of events {K125:1}.\n\nWine is the drink for “losing your base self (bikhodi)” {K 469:3}. Become its votary so you can destroy hypocrisy and false piety {K469:5}! Wine is the potion to use for love-sickness, Hafez says, as it is soothing and stops wrong thoughts {K125:6}. “Other than the Plato who resides in the barrel of wine/ who can tell us the secret of wisdom,” Hafez asks rhetorically {K256:5}. “Let’s, inebriated, pull away the veil from the mystery of destiny” {K368:3}!” I will show you “the secret of the world in the clear wine,” Hafez says, “provided that you don’t share it with the ill-natured and blind-hearted {K273:6}.” “In this world which is unreal, hold nothing but the goblet of wine {K254:7}!” Put a cup of wine on my coffin, Hafez asks, so that with it, I lose the terror of the day of Resurrection {K260:8}. My heart which was dead was revived by the scent of wine, he says in another poem {K84:6}.\n\nHafez admits that wine has vices {K177:6}. In one quatrain, roba’i 31, he warns that it will likely ruin (kharab) you and give you a bad reputation {S:651}). In a ghazal, however, he explains that he destroyed his image by wine-worshipping because he wished thus to destroy his self-worshipping {K385:2}.\n\nSetting\n\nBecause of the threat of being charged with religious heresy, Hafez considers the advice that wine should be drunk in hiding {K195:1}. He asks, rhetorically, is it not better thus to hide the problem of wine-drinking {K212:9}? This wine was likely made at home (khanegi), to avoid religious police {K278:4}. Drinking in secret was called “drinking ala Jews (shorb al-Yahoud) {K 280:3},” as it was the way Jewish people drank wine in Shiraz at that time {R:386}.\n\nHafez believes in “the old saying” that wine is forbidden without a friend as a drinking partner {K360:1}. Hafez can drink even in the absence of music {K271:8}. Hafez gets tired of drinking in hiding {K342:9}. He comes to think that drinking and having fun (`aysh) in secret is “baseless (bi bonyad) {K97:1”}. He decides to reveal his drinking with the music of the harp and reed {K342:9}.\n\nHafez sets limits on drinking time. He says don’t drink wine all year long: drink only three months and abstain nine months. {K269:2}. He says don’t drink during the day as that would “darken your heart;” you should spend the day, instead, learning a skill {K146:4}. The time for drinking is after the sunset {K146:5}. However, you may celebrate with a glass of wine at dawn to behold the arrival of your beloved {K172:2}. Another exceptional occasion is the coming of spring when “there is talk of the cypress, the rose and tulip;” that calls for drinking “the three glasses of wine (salaseh-ye ghassaleh) {K218:1}” – as the ancient Greek philosophers prescribed {R:305}.\n\nHafez’s preferred venue for drinking is the wine-house/ taverm (meykhaneh, or meykadeh). The place for him assumes a role far greater. It is only there, he says, that he can be aware of himself {K345:4}. He goes to the wine-house because the Sufi temple (khanehqah) did not “open” anything (nagshood) {K363:2}. He says don’t waste your time at school, seek that goal, “opening (goshadi),” at the wine-house {K361:9}. In both these instances, by opening Hafez seems to be referring to the Gnostics enlightenment. In the same vernacular, he says I am a “beggar (geda)” at the wine-house, “but watch me when I am drunk/How I stand proudly before the sky and command the stars {K342: 6}.”\n\nThe wine-houses in Hafez’s poems are located in kharabat. In Hafez’s times, there were many wine-houses in Shiraz, and there were run-down areas on the outskirts of the city which were called kharabat. Those wine-houses were not necessarily located in those ruins. They were managed by either Jews or Christians {Li1:52}. The imaginary wine-house in Hafez’s poems, however, are presided over by Magians (Moghan), Zoroastrian priests {Li1:52}. Hafez’s imaginary ruins are also named after them kharabat-e Moghan {K10:2, K327:1}.\n\nIn Hafez’s Gnostic musing, the “ruins” assumes the connotation of destruction associated with the Gnostic concept of fana, or annihilation of the base-self, and his wine-house becomes the “house of love (maykhaneh-ye `eshq)” {K194:6}. Here the ephebe Zoroastrian youth (mogh bachcheh/ wine seller’s errand boy) is the beauty {K165:4} who arouses Hafez’s desire {K197:5}, lures him by playing a harp and a tambourine {K290:6}, and pours him wine {L2}.\n\nHafez brings his problems to the Zoroastrian guide/elder-priest, pir-e Moghan (the pir of the Magians) who would solve them by his “insights (nazar)” {K136:3} [5]. The pir-e Moghan gazes into a wine goblet (136:4} which is “world-seeing (jahan bin)” {K136:5}. Thus, Hafez describes the legendary crystal bowl, called Jom-e Jam (Jam’s Bowl), of the mythical ancient Persian King Jamshid, which he mentions in this and other ghazals [6]. For Hafez, the ruins, which he also calls the Magians’ cloister (dayr-e Moghan) –literary, convent of the Magians-, is a refuge from restrictions of Islam. There the pir-e Moghan issues decrees (fatwas) {K360:1} in accordance with his own creed (mazhab) which allows drinking {K193:6}. Accordingly, if he says, “dye your prayer mat with wine,” Hafez follows {K1:3}, feeling secure in the sanctuary of the pir-e Moghan {K263:4}. The blasphemous contrast with Islamic decrees, which forbid drinking, is also depicted in the juxtaposition of wine with kherqeh (the Islamic religious leaders’ cloak): “wine and kherqeh” represent these two different religions {K193:6}.\n\nHafez further uses the same symbol, kherqeh, in declaring his freedom to love: “Because the beloved’s hair commands us to wear the Christians’ belt (zonnar)/Go away, O Shaikh, as kherqeh has become forbidden to us {K304:4}”[7]. The freedom that Hafez seeks in the Magians’ cloister is, however, even broader than to love and to drink; it is general “release (goshayesh)” {K40:4}.\n\nThis imaginary domain of a pre-Islamic priest enhances Hafez’s iconology of the Zoroastrian Iran [8]. On par with his reference to Jom-e Jam, is Hafez’s invocation of Nowruz, the ancient celebration of spring [9]. The “breeze of Nowruz,” he says, “brightens your heart {K445:1}.” “Like rose, spend the little that you have for enjoyment {K445:2}.” “It is fresh spring, make efforts to have fun/For many a rose will bloom while you have turned to dust.” {K447:1}.”\n\nFollowing an old Persian rite of spring, Hafez sets a celebratory stage by strewing rose petals on it [10] and, additionally, asks for wine {K198:9} as he recalls the rituals of the Zoroastrian religion {K198:8} [11] , before issuing his exuberantly unconstrained, audacious call to his guests: Come! let’s break the mold of the universe and “cast a new design {K367:1}!”\n\nVI. Clergy\n\nNo part of the established order of things arouses Hafez’ wrath more than the Muslim clerics who occupied the positions of leadership in Shiraz’s organized religion. In no fewer than 170 ghazals, he jeers at the clique {Y}. With 35% of his poems thus harping on a theme which is totally unlyrical {Y}, Hafez’s Divan becomes unique among Persian collections of love poetry {Sgh :159} [1].\n\nHis target is all inclusive. Hafez attacks all officials: the Mofti (the clergy who issues religious rulings), the Faqih (scholar of religious law) the Qazi (the judge in Islam), the Zahed (ascetics), the Shaikh (religious elder), the Moḥtaseb (morality police), the Va`eẓ (preacher), and the Emam-e Jamaʿat (leader of public prayer). In this list, he also includes the Hafez (memorizer of the Koran), and Sufi (Islamic mystic) {Y} [2]. His critical position is absolute as no praise for any aspect of their lives or works is offered [3]. No person is specifically mentioned and thus, by implication, it was immaterial if there was any change of the occupant of the position.\n\nHafez spoke positively about some Islamic principles, as distinguished from Islamic institutions and their incumbent leaders. On 17 occasions in his poems, he refers favorably to Sufis’ “Way (Tariqat),” “men of God (mardan-e Khoda)” and “the contented (darvish)” and “contentment (darvishi).” He praises the virtuous (parsa) and virtue (parsa’i) six times. He is unforgiving, however, toward the Zaheds (who in Hafez’s view are ones who practice sham piety), as well as the Mohtasebs (who police morality) and Shaikhs (elders of religion). {Y}. These, Hafez always charged with hypocrisy. They pose as spiritual and moral leaders forbidding that which they practice in secret {Y}.\n\nHypocrisy\n\nHafez illustrates the hypocrisy of the clerics in a variety of ways, using a vast collection of words denoting duplicity, deceit, chicanery, dissimulation, pretense, inauthenticity, sham, and counterfeit. Chief among these terms are riya {K126:10, K 129:9, K 171:8, K 191:6, K 197:6, K 238:5b, K 262:2 , K 269:1, K 290:7 , K 319:9, K 347:4, K 357:1, K 358:1, K 360:2, K 368:2, K 373:5, K 399:8, K 476:8}, salus { K 28:7, K 220:1, K 368:1, K 379:4, K 462:5, K 469:5} tazvir { K 9:10, K 195:9, and K 195:9}, zarq { K 67:3, K 131:7, K 145:3, K 368:1, K 372:9, K 407:12} [4].\n\nHafez acknowledges that anybody can be a hypocrite {K 357:1; 126:8}. Indeed, he admits that he is sometimes guilty of hypocrisy {K319:9, K476:8}. However, he expresses strong desire to avoid it {K131:7}. In one poem, he lumps together the whole group of “Shaikh, Hafez, Mofti and Mohtaseb” as hypocrites {K195:9}. In another, he condemns all who use the Koran as a snare of deceit {K9:10}. In yet a third poem, Hafez targets all who engage in a counterfeit charade of spirituality to fool people {K194:3}. In many other poems he directs his accusation, separately, at the Zahed {K254, K399:8}, Mohtaseb {K290:7}, Va`ez {K 220:1, K 339:7}, and Sufi {K28:7, K 238:5, K368.1}.\n\nOrigin\n\nThis anti-clerical attitude does not appear in Hafez’s early poems. On the contrary, in a qat`eh (fragment) – a genre of poems different from ghazal- Hafez lavishly praised a certain Qazi (Majd al-Din, d. 1355), a leader of the Sufis (Amin al-Din, d. 1344), and a Faqih (Azod al-Din, d. 1355), from the time of Shah Shaikh Abu Eshaq (r.1342-1353), crediting them, as among five extraordinary people (along with the ruler and his Vizier) who made Fars prosperous {Kq9}. At that time Hafez was in his mid-30s. In another qat`eh, Hafez refers to a Qazi’s classroom as “the source of knowledge {Kq3}.”\n\nHafez’s ghazals attacking religious officials and their hypocrisy first appeared in relationship to the reign of Amir Mobarez al-Din Mozaffarid in Shiraz (754/1353-759/1358) {Le1:23}[5]. The Amir showed respect and deference to the puritan ascetics (Zaheds) and strict clerics [6]. He closed the town’s wine taverns and boarded up its dens of vice {Le1:23} [7].” When “they closed the wine-houses,” Hafez expressed fear, in a poem, that they would open the door to pretense and hypocrisy {K197:6}. He says that the sin of wine-drinking in private is better than ostentatious sham worshipping {K191:6}. He would rather drink than suffer hypocrisy {K462:5}. He advises both drinking and avoiding hypocrisy {K269:1, K 407:12}. In fact, he prescribes wine as the cure for hypocrisy {K67.3, K368:2}. Against his own inclinations, however, to please his benefactor, Hafez now tried to repent from drinking and to follow the example of the Zahed {K397:8}. The benefactor, whom Hafez calls Khwajeh in this poem, probably was Burhan al-Din, the Vizier of Amir Mobarez, whom Hafez praises in a poem {K453:10}[8].\n\nOn the other hand, Hafez asks rhetorically, why is it that those who preach repentance, do not repent themselves. He points out that the preachers who put up such a show in their public sermons, themselves do otherwise in private {K194:2}. He says that he is ashamed of boasting of piety while still drinking {K 347:3}.\n\nHe resolves to drink and stay away from the hypocrites: “to rise above them in liberation,” if he can free himself from worldly needs {K347:5}” [9]. He declares that if thus he is “the rend in kharabat (the debauchee in the city’s ruins), on the one hand, and the town’s Hafez (reciter of the Koran), on the other, so be it, “I am what you see and even lower {K 347:7}.” He depends on his lord, the current “great Vizier (asaf-e `ahd),” to avenge him if fate leads him astray {K347:9}. Hafez was referring to Turanshah, the Vizier of the new ruler of Shiraz, Shah Shoja` [10]. Hafez now declares: “I have repented (from drinking and loving) one hundred times and I won’t again {K345:1}.” He says, “I am not such a real man (rend) who would abandon the beloved and wine/Mohtaseb knows that I seldom do such things {K338:1}.”\n\nReferring to Mobarez’s son and successor Shah Shoja`, who dramatically reversed the policies of his father, Hafez says, “In the age of the King who forgave mistakes and ignored violations/Hafez carried the flask and the Mofti drank from the cup// Sufi moved from the monastery to sit at the wine vat/When he saw the Mohtaseb carry a jug of wine on his shoulder.” Shaikh and Qazi were drinking in secret {K280: 1-3}.\n\nHafez’s attack on the religious leaders is primarily caused by their position on drinking wine. However, Hafez finds additional faults with the bunch. The superficial Zahed “does not understand us {K72:1},” He is so self-absorbed that he can do nothing but to criticize others. {K258: 8}. The Zahed is ignorant, the Mohtaseb is “drunk with hypocrisy,” and the Sufi is an animal {K290:7,8}.\n\nRendi\n\nHafez separates himself from the clerics and the establishment that they represent. Since the Va’eẓ chose the favor of the King and his political police (Shahneh), Hafez says, “I choose the love of a beloved {K222: 4}.” Lovers are “the people of God,” not the Shaikhs, he adds in another poem {K350:5}. As the opposite of hypocrisy, Hafez proposes the “path of love and rendi.” {K131:7}. He says “learn rendi” to become human. {K220:2}.\n\nRendi was the way the rend (hoodlum, debauchee) lived his life [11]. Hafez says, he became “a legend for his rendi,” in reaction to the “ignorant Sufi elders and the Shaikhs who had lost their ways {K409:3}” [12]. Thus, he repented from following the false pious, and asked God that He may forgive the deeds of pretentious worshippers {K409:4}.\n\nHafez longs to become a qalandar (ascetic dervish/dissolute hoodlum) by freeing himself from the Sufi cap and cloak (kherqeh) {K389:8}[13]. He recalls fondly that certain “sweet qalandar” who recited the Muslim angels’ praise of God, wearing zonnar, the belt Christians wore to mark them in Muslim lands {K79:7}. Similarly, the rend who would “set fire to the world (`alam suz),” Hafez says in a poem, “has no use for prudence {K271:4}” [14]. Far more often, Hafez identifies himself with the rend [15]. “I am a rend and say it openly {K305:2}.” He repeats, in another poem, “loudly, I am a rend {K321:2},” and in still a third poem, “we are rends {K47:9}.”\n\nHafez finds the rend’s “purity of heart (safa-ye del)” to be a miracle worker that helps open doors {K197:3}. The rend’s humble ways would take him to heaven, while Zahed’s pride would block his way {K84:7}. Hafez even calls the rendan (plural of rend) “saints (awliyay-e haq)” {K93:3}. He says his own grave would become the shrine for pilgrimage of the world’s rendan {K201:3}.\n\nHafez warns the Zahed to be careful when passing through the “rendan’s street,” lest the company of some “ill-reputed (bad- nam)” ones corrupt him {K177:6}. In Shiraz of Hafez’s time, the aristocratic families, from which the Zahed usually came, looked down upon the rendan, who were among the street mobs, the lowest social group {Li1} [16]. rendan was one of their several disparaging names for these mobs [17]. “In the streets and bazaar of Shiraz there existed an undercurrent of resistance to” the ruling class, which “most often appeared as a sullen, passive opposition using weapons of mockery and ridicule” but occasionally expressed in violence {Li1:89} [18].\n\nHafez emphasizes the impossibility of bridging the social distance between such “a bazar rend (rend-e bazari)” and “the King (Sultan)”: “How can the Sultan have a secret love affair with a bazar rend {K186:6}?”[19]. In that poem, it is the rend that Hafez identifies with, not the Sultan [20]. In another poem, he mocks those who criticize him for being a rend: “Many thanks that they are faultless! {K196:2}!” He says it is better to act as a rend than “to make the Koran a snare of deceit, like others {K9:11}.”\n\nIn one ghazal, Hafez says that a person is fated to be a rend {K145:6}. He asserts that on the day of creation (Ruz-e Azal), he was assigned to act only as a rend {K161:3}. This claim was, of course, not included in the Islamic narrative of the day of creation. Hafez, furthermore, swears by the “purity of heart (safa-ye del)” of the rendan that “morning wine (saboohi)” drinkers can open many a closed door with their prayers {K197:3}.” He continues contrasting the rend with the pious Muslim: Zahed’s “arrogant pride (ghoroor)” prevents him from reaching safety, while the rend, by way of his humility, enters Heaven {K84:7}[21].The rend is a poor beggar (geda) who knows the alchemy for spiritual riches, Hafez says in the manner of the dissenters in Islam who embraced “material poverty (Darvishi)” {K174:6}.\n\nHafez embraces that ethos, calling himself geda {K262:3}. He adopts yet another principle of the rendan, “the attitude of caring the less (laobali)” {K454:11}, and a third one: he vows not to forget “humility (oftadegi)” as pride has caused the “jealous (hasood)” Islamic leaders to lose their “honor, property, heart and religion {K135.7}.”\n\nWhile he considers himself a rend, Hafez does not forget to add that he is also “a lover (`asheq)” and one “intoxicated with wine (mast) {K196:2}.” He is a “heedless wine-worshipper (qallash-e badeh parast) {K453:5}.” He is the follower of “the religion of love (mazhab-e `eshq) {K119.7}.” In fact, he has his “own religion (mazhab-e ma).” {K47:3}.\n\nThe rend is not the alter ego of Hafez’s composite persona [22]. To those who protest for such a simple identification, Hafez responds with shouting out a duo of his opposite faces: “If I am the rend of the ruins or Hafez (the Koran memorizer and reciter) of the city/I am what you see, and even less {K347:7}”[23].\n\nVII. Islam\n\nThe comments in Hafez’s Divan about Islam may be searched in various poems relating to the Koran, the sayings and stories in Islamic traditions, Islamic rituals, Islamic principles, iconic figures in Islam, elements from the pre-Islamic past of Iran which had been integrated in the Persian Islamic culture, as well as those poems relating to other religions.\n\nKoran\n\nHafez, the pen-name of the poet, Shams-al-Din Mohammad, referred to his knowing the Koran by heart. Indeed, he was extraordinary as he could recite it from memory in fourteen different versions {K93:10}. Each version (ravayat) was based on the textual variant promulgated by one of the fourteen recognized “readers (qarian)” [1] of the Koran. Although the text of the Koran was codified by the Caliph `Uthman in 650, because of the limitation in the Arabic script, when reading it, the appearance of the placement of a vowel sign or a dot over or under a letter in different places in the hand-written manuscripts, produced significant variations in the understanding of a passage. There are an estimate1,100 instances in the Koran which can generate such different readings of particular verses [2].\n\nHafez indicates his education in the academic commentary on the Koran, in a ghazal where he mentions “the discussing of Kashf Kashshaf” in “school” {K45:3}. Kashf Kashshaf was a commentary on Kashshaf which, in turn, was the iconic commentary on the Koran, authored in the 12th Century by Mahmoud Jarrollah [3]. Mohammad Golandam, the collector of Hafez’s Divan, has said that he was Hafez’s schoolmate, in a class taught by `Abdullah, where presumably Kashf Kashshaf was taught [4].\n\nThe only book other than Kashshaf, that Hafez mentions by name in all of his poems is the Koran [5]. In comparison to the sole reference to Kashshaf, there are at least 8 mentions of the Koran. Hafez’s reverence for Islam’s sacred scripture is manifest in three ghazals where he swears to it {K 150:10, K 266:8, K 438:7}. In another poem, he professes his gratitude: “no one benefited as much from the munificence of the Koran {K312:9}.” In another ghazal, Hafez says that reading the Koran, and praying, would block all worries {K250:10}. In still another poem, he says the Devil is scared away from the people who read the Koran {K188.11}. Yet, notwithstanding all of that which you may receive, even from reciting the Koran in fourteen versions from memory, Hafez says, it is “love” that would save you {K93:10}. Furthermore, the worst sin is to make the Koran a “snare of deceit (dom-e tazvir),” as “others” do, meaning religious officials {K9:10}.\n\nKORANIC VERSES\n\nIn at least 42 of Hafez’s ghazals there are references to various verses of the Koran, sometimes more than one in a ghazal. These references are usually in the form of allusions (tamlih), common in Persian poetry. There is hardly any verbatim quotation from the Koran in the Divan [6].\n\nGod\n\nThe largest group of Hafez’s ghazals with allusions to the Koranic verses are those about God and man’s relationship with Him.\n\nThere is an allusion in two ghazals {K10:2} [7], and {K21:1} [8] to the Koranic verse 7:172 (sureh/chapter 7: ayeh/verse 172), which in effect says that man’s destiny is set on the First Day (Azal or Alast). In another poem, Hafez alludes to verse 33:73, to the effect that man, who accepted God’s burden of trust was weaker than the mountain who was refused the same {K21:4} [9]. In still another ghazal, Hafez alludes to verse 2:34 in which God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam {K465:5} [10]. Hafez alludes, in another ghazal, to verse 7:16 about the Devil’s turning into fire and striking on Adam, out of jealousy as he was not incapable of loving God {K148:2} [11]. In a ghazal, Hafez alludes to verse 37:11 which is about warding off the Devil (Eblis) from the sky with the burning meteor {K6:2} [12] , while in another ghazal, he alludes to verse 15:18 with a similar content {K257:8} [13].\n\nThe poet in a ghazal alludes to the Koranic verse 4:28 which says that man was created weak by God {K181:6} [14]. In another, the allusion is to the verses 20:120-123 which are about Adam being driven out of Heaven to earth because of disobeying God {K310:3}[15]. This allusion is repeated in another poem which specifically refers to Adam’s infraction of eating “two grains of wheat” {K332:6} [16].\n\nHafez alludes to the God’s command in verse 17:23 that he would be the only one worshipped {K337:4} [17]. In another poem, the allusion is to verse 28:31 in which God says he is the sole God {K136:6} [18]. In still another ghazal, Hafez alludes to verse 2:115 which says whichever you look you are looking at God {K193: 4} [19]. In a poem, Hafez alludes to verse 35:18 in which God says a person will not be charged with the sins committed by others {K78:1} [20]. In another ghazal he alludes to verse 2:44 which admonished those who order people to do right while failing to do so themselves {K194:2} [21].\n\nHeaven\n\nIn a ghazal, Hafez alludes to verse 98:8 which describes the beauty of Heaven as having running rivers under it {K79:8} [22]. In another poem, allusion is made to verse 53:15 which calls Heaven “the home of those who are not enamored of the trappings of this world (jennat al-ma’avi) {K422:7}” [23]. In two ghazals Hafez alludes to verse 53:14 which mentions the sedreh tree located in the “seventh sky” as, symbolically, the highest point man can reach {K37:4} [24], and {K71:3}[25].\n\nProphets\n\nIn Hafez’s ghazals there seems to be no allusion to any verse of the Koran which might mention the “Prophet Mohammad” [26]. In one ghazal, however, there is allusion to verse 68:51, which is addressed to Mohammad, that says that the deniers “nearly (va en yekad)” hurt you when they heard the Koran and in envy called you a lunatic {K239:2} [27].\n\nIn one ghazal Hafez alludes to verse 5:110 which talks about Jesus’s ability to revive the dead, a miracle ordered by God {K71:6} [28], and in another to verse 2:49 which is about “Jesus’s breath” enabling him to perform that miracle {K428:2}[29].\n\nThere are more ghazals with allusions to verses relating to Moses than any other prophet. In one ghazal Hafez alludes to verse 28:29 which talks about the Right Vale (Vadi-e Ayman), to the right of Mount Sinai (Toor), where Moses heard God’s voice {K:27:2} [30] ; and in another ghazal, Hafez paraphrases verse 28:30 in which Moses, seeing a bright light on Mount Sinai, tells his household wait, I hope I will bring you a torch from that flame {K446:6} [31]. In another ghazal, Hafez alludes to verse 7:143, in which Moses, asking God to show himself, walked to what he thought was the meeting place {K366:4} [32].\n\nIn one ghazal, Hafez alludes to verses 7:147, 20:85, 20:87 and 20:95, which are about the golden calf which Moses’ tribe worshipped after his departure to Mount Sinai, and that say the sound of that the Sameri’s calf could not prevail over Moses’ “shining hand (yad-e bayza)” – alluding to verse 20:22, which said the shining hand was one of Moses’ miracles. {K:124;7} [33]. In another ghazal, Hafez alludes to verses 20:85 et seq which refer to Sameri as a symbol of deceptive tactics since he was the magician who deceived Moses’ tribe into worship his own golden calf as the God which Moses had talked about {K:391;1}[34].\n\nIn Hafez’s ghazals there are allusions to two other persons the Koran calls prophet (nabi): Solomon and Joseph. In two ghazals, {K141:5} and {K312:2}, Hafez alludes to verses 27:19-22, which say the prophet (nabi) and King (Malak) Solomon’s bird hoope (hodhod) brought glad tidings to him from Belqis, the Queen of Sheba [35]. In another two ghazals, {K167:6} and {K273:5}, Hafez alludes to verses 27:17-19, which indicate that Solomon paid attention and understood the lowly ants [36]. In one ghazal {K115:9}, Hafez alludes to verses 12:18 and 19, which are about the prophet (nabi) Joseph’s jealous brothers throwing him into a well [37]. In another {K237:5}, he alludes to verse 12:11, which is about Joseph coming out of the well and rising to the highest position [38]. In a third {K191:7}, Hafez alludes to verse 12:93 which is about Joseph’s shirt being sent to cure his father’s blindness [39].\n\nSayings and Stories in Islamic Traditions\n\nMany of Hafez’s ghazals contain allusions, to popular “Sayings and Stories (Ahadis va Akhbar)” which formed part of the Islamic traditions. A large group of these is related to the Prophet Mohammad.\n\nIn five ghazals reference is to a saying attributed to the Prophet, to the effect that God said He is the heart of the broken-hearts: {K24:3, K 53:7, K312:4, K396:5, and K425:6} [40]. In another three ghazals reference is to a saying attributed to the Prophet that a man (Ovays Gharani) became a believer by merely smelling the scent of God coming from Yemen: {K21:3, K49:6 and K382:4} [41]. In one ghazal there is an allusion to a saying of the Prophet that it was his honor to be poor (in need of God) {K53:5} [42]. In one ghazal there is an allusion to a saying of the Prophet that Sahib, one of his companions, was a paragon of obedient abstinence {K183:4} [43]. In another ghazal there is an allusion to the saying of the Prophet that after him his followers will split into 72 factions and only one of them will find salvation {K179:4} [44].\n\nThere is one ghazal with an allusion to a saying attributed to `Ali, the last of the four Rashidun (Rightly-guided) caliphs, who immediately succeeded the Prophet, to the effect that being amazed at God is the sign of greater appreciation of Him {K168:1} [45].\n\nThe remaining sayings, also from the Islamic traditions, which are alluded to in the ghazals are not attributed to specific persons. Two ghazals allude to the saying that suffering is unavoidable in loving {K20:5 and K310:7) [46]. Two other ghazals allude to the saying that God said my kindness is greater than my anger {K78:5 and K399:2} [47]. One ghazal alludes to the saying that those who got rid of belongings are better off than those who did not {K44:6}[48]. Another ghazal alludes that the saying which advises going with a positive divination to get positive results {K57:7} [49]. A third ghazal alludes to the saying about choosing a trusted counselor {K382:10} [50]. One ghazal alludes to the saying that presence of heart is required for an acceptable prayer {K392:7} [51]. A ghazal alludes to the saying that everything returns to its origin {K397:7} [52]. Another ghazal alludes to the saying that this world is the farm where you sow for the other world {K398:4} [53]. Still a third ghazal has an allusion to the saying that the corruption of the learned is the corruption of the world {K427:8} [54]. Finally, another ghazal alludes to the saying that peace is better than conflict {K442:7}[55].\n\nIconic figures\n\nIn his ghazals, Hafez refers to several figures in their positions as iconic symbols in Islamic culture. The most numerous are references to Solomon. In two ghazals, Hafez alludes to the wind being Solomon’s ride, or vehicle {K21:7, K88:6} [56]. In another ghazal, the allusion is to the bird Hodhod who brought messages to Soloman {K312:2} [57]. In four ghazals, Hafez alludes to the legend that Solomon had a ring which enabled him to rule the world {K59:2, K117:3, K156:2, and K157:2} [58]. In one ghazal the allusion is to the practice, in the Islamic traditions, of using Solomon as a synonym for the word King {K170:2} [59]. In another, Hafez uses “Solomon” to imply reference to his actual King, Shah Shoja`{K167:1} [60]. In two ghazals, there is reference to the country of Solomon as meaning Pars, reflecting the common belief that Solomon was in fact Jamshid, the mythical ancient Persian King {K351:4, K355:8} [61]. One ghazal refers to Solomon’s legendary majesty {K480:4}. In another ghazal, Hafez alludes to the belief that Solomon with all his majesty was kindly and attentive even to the lowly ants {K273:5}.\n\nThe Prophet Khezr’s proverbial long life is referred to in two ghazals {K268:3 and K285:5} [62]. In two other ghazals, reference is to the legend that Kezr’s long life was due to the “water of life” {K40: 9 and K274:2} [63]. The legend that this “water of life (fountain of youth)” ran in darkness {K40: 9) [64] is reflected in several ghazals associating it with darkness {K125:4, K164:2, K299:8} [65]. The belief that Khezr had “blessed steps” so that wherever he went grass would grow, is reflected in reference to him as (Pey-khojasteh) in two ghazals {K190:7 and K306:7} [66]. In four ghazals there are allusions to the legend that Noah’s Ark provided safe refuge in the great storm {K19:7, K24:2, K250:5, and K301:7} [67].\n\nThere are references to several secular figures who were archetypal in Islamic tradition. Seven ghazals allude to the fabulous treasures of Korah (Qaroon) {K5:10, K50:8,K55:9, K122:7, K285:9, K341:6, and K449:1}, the archetypal rich man of Moses time [68]. In two of them the reference is to the belief that all that treasure was lost in due time {K122:7} and sank in earth because of the wrath of Moses and his followers {K50:8}.\n\nOne ghazal refers to the proverbial belief that even Alexander’s kingdom did not last {K285:5}. In two ghazals the reference is to his failure to find the fountain of youth despite all his power and wealth {K240:7, K430:5}. His legendry quest for the fountain of youth is mentioned in a third ghazal {K402:7}. That the fountain famously eluded him is mentioned in another ghazal {K268:3}. One ghazal refers to the legend that following the advice of Alexander’s teacher, Aristotle, a mirror was installed on a tower in Alexandria to watch the movements of ships and report on the world beyond {K5:5} [69].\n\nOne ghazal alludes to the belief that Plato was the symbol of wisdom and knowledge {K256:5}. One ghazal refers to the legendary pleat of Cesar’s toga {K421:2}. One ghazal mentions Zaleykha*, a noble Egyptian woman, as the symbol of a person who loses her chastity for irresistible love, in her case, of Joseph {K3:6}[70]. Joseph’s father, the Shaikh of Can’an* is mentioned as one whose suffering due to being separated from his son was proverbial {K88:1} [71]. One ghazal mentions Hatam Ta’i as the symbol of generosity {K422:8}.\n\nMansur Hallaj, the symbol of love for God at all costs, especially by going up on the gallows, is mentioned in two ghazals {K189:6; 301:4}. Dajjal, as the symbol of a man who falsely claims he is Messiah, is referenced to in one ghazal {K237:6} [72]. The proverbial love of Sultan Mahmoud Qaznavi for his slave Ayyaz is referred to in two Ghazals {K41:6, and K326:8}[73].\n\nRemarkably, the ghazals do not contain specific mention of the Prophet Mohammad as a historical figure, other than allusions to him in the Sayings and Stories in Islamic Traditions, discussed above. Nor is there any mention, as historical figures, of the four Rashidun caliphs who immediately succeeded the Prophet. This includes ‘Ali, the only one to whom there is a reference in the Islamic Traditions. Hafez does not say that ‘Ali was a Shiite or a Sunni. Hafez refers to Shafe`i as the iconic jurisconsult {K301:4}. The Shafe`i branch of Sunni Islam was dominant in many parts of Iran in Hafez’s time.\n\nPre-Islamic Iran\n\nThere are many references in Hafez’s ghazals to the legends about Pre-Islamic historical figures. These were evidently parts of the distinctly Iranian-Islamic culture of Hafez’s time [74]. The treatment of that culture and those legends in Hafez’s poems, examined here, constitutes an important element of his views about Islam.\n\nIn two ghazals there is an allusion to the story of Bijan and Manijeh, the jailing of Bijan in a well on the order of Afrasiyab, the King of the Turks, and his release by Rostam (Tahmetan) {K 337:5, K 461:5}. Bijan was the Iranian warrior son of Giv and fell in love with Manijeh who was Afrasiyab’s daughter and this led Afrasyiab to throw him in a well. This story is told in details in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh [74].\n\nIn one ghazal, allusion is made to the widespread stories about Afrasiyab’s (Poor-pashang’s) swordsmanship {K382:5} [76]. In one ghazal, Hafez alludes to the belief that Afrasiyab should have been ashamed to have shed Siyavash’s blood unjustly as he listened and followed those who maligned Siyavash {K101:4} [77]. In another ghazal, allusion is made to the victory of King Kay Khosrow*, Siyavash’s son, in the fight over Afrasiyab {K 425:3}. This story of Kay Khosrow’s revenge of his father’s killing is related in Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh [78].\n\nIn that poem there is also a reference to Jom-e Kay Khosrow, which is Ferdowsi’s name for what Hafez elsewhere in his Divan usually calls Jom-e Jam (after King Jamshid)- the allseeing Crystal Bowl. In two other ghazals, Hafez distinguishes between Kay Khosrow and Jamshid, as two Kings, which are “the subjects of many stories.” {K116:10 and K117:8}. In another poem, Hafez refers to the two of them as iconic Kings {K117:8}. In another ghazal, Hafez’s refers to Kay Khosrow’s cummerbund (kamar) {K399:4}, which was an important part of Persian Kings’ formal attire [79].\n\nKay Khosrow was from the Kayanian Dynasty, a semi-mythological group of ancient Kings, preceding the historical Achaemenid dynasty, in Persian folklore. Kay in the beginning of their names connotes the royal title. Several of them are mentioned in Hafez’s ghazals. In one ghazal, Hafez refers to three of them, Qobad, Kavous, Bahman, as well Kay, with which he means the Kayanian Dynasty {K 97:4,5} [80]. Kavous is also mentioned in two other ghazals {K343:5, K399:4}. Kay is also mentioned in three other ghazals {K343:5, K 421:2, K423:4}.\n\nIn several ghazals, Hafez refers to the Kings of the Pishdadian Dynasty, which according to Persian traditions came even before the Kayanians. They were indeed the mythological dynasty that produced the first Kings to rule the land of Persia. One ghazal mentions the Pishdadian Kings Zav and Siyamak{K398:6} who was the son of Persia’s very first King, Kayumars.\n\nJAMSHID\n\nJamshid, from the Pishdadian Dynasty, is the King Hafez mentioned by far the most. Hafez sometimes calls him Jam. Hafez is eager to tell the tales of Jamshid {K343:5},of which there are many {K116:10}. He, along with Kay Khosrow, are referred to as the iconic Kings {K117:8}. In one ghazal, it is implicitly acknowledged that Jam was more a legend rather than a historical person: “Who knows when Jam lived {K423:4}.” In another, Hafez says we don’t know how Jamshid lost his throne. {K97:5}. Another ghazal notes that he was from a time past {K12:9}.\n\nJamshid’s “kingship,” to which another ghazal refers {K115:1}, is the core of his legend. His royal “nature” is noted in one ghazal {K49:6}. His “throne” is mentioned in two ghazal {K97:5; 425:10}. He is referred to as the symbol of luxury and wealth {K459:1}. He is the metaphor for the ruler of the time {K439:1}. He is likened to the sun in the universe {K288:3).\n\nThree ghazals refer to Jamshid’s ring (khatam) {K222:3; K24:5, and K382:3} which, as the last two ghazal make clear, is the same as Solomon’s ring [81]. This was the ring that, as those two ghazals indicate, was lost to Ahriman (the Devil) but was retrieved because God’s greatest “name” was inscribed on it. With its help Solomon ruled over all creatures [82]. In one ghazal, Hafez places Jamshid’s throne as high as Solomon’s throne, in an allusion the Koranic verses 27:17 and 18, about how high a determined lowly ant can climb {K167:6} [83]. In yet two other ghazals, Hafez implies identifying Jamshid with Solomon: when he refers to “Jom-e Jam” (Jamshid’s Bowl) in the context of the loss of Solomon’s ring {K114:1} [84], and when he refers to the same bowl in the context of Solomon’s Vizier having a position as high as Jamshid {K267:7} [85]. Jom-e Jam, according to legend, was the bowl that the learned men had made for King Jamshid in which he could see the conditions of “the seven universes” [86]. Hafez refers to it in several other ghazals {K80:5; K 136:1; K 273:4, and K 269:4}. In the last poem, Hafez also attributes to the Bowl the ability to reveal the secrets of the Unseen (gheyb) world. In another Ghazal, Hafez refers to the cup-bearers of Jamshid’s wine drinking parties {K12:9}. In another, he says that the King drank wine, implying that such drinking was related to his ability to learn about the world through his Bowl {K479:2}. As that poem indicates, for Hafez, indeed, the cup of wine served that goal. In another ghazal, Hafez says that the person who drank wine in Jamshid’s parties could see the world in the cup as an amazing mirror, provided that he kept his “heart clean” {K405:3}. The same condition is repeated in another ghazal which says Jom-e Jam is not useful for those who are not “capable of perception {K443:2}.”\n\nIn one ghazal, Hafez calls Jamshid victorious {K241:3}. In another, he notes that he did not remain so, and lost his throne {K286:7}. In another, Hafez repeats that Jamshid could not keep his throne {K365:3}. In a third, Hafez concludes that the lesson of Jamshid was that even he would not last {K176:5}.\n\nIn contrast to the mythical, pre-historic Persian Kings, there is remarkably scant mention of the Persian rulers of the historical era. Hafez says nothing about the first historical dynasties, the Medes, Achaemenians and Parthians, with the sole exception of Darius III, the last Achaemenian King. One ghazal reminds the reader of the loss of “Dara’s” country in his defeat to the Macedonian King Alexander in 331 BC {K5:5}.\n\nHafez also refers to three Kings of the Sasanians who ruled Persia from the early 3rd century AD until the Arab Muslim conquest of 651. In one ghazal, Hafez refers to the popular story of the 5th Century King Bahram’s haunting of onagers (wild ass) {K273:4}. Another ghazal refers to the “head” of King Kasra (Khosrow Anooshiravan), famous as a philosopher-king, and the throne of King Parviz (Khosrow II) who lost it to the victorious\n\nOne ghazal mentions the Pahlavi language {K477:1} which was the one used during the Parthian Dynasty in the last century BC and continued to be Iran’s language until sometime after the Muslim conquest [87]. Its old script was not replaced with Arabic until the 9th Century, (at least) in Khorasan [88]. One ghazal mentions Mani as “the Chinese painter” {K348:8}. He was the Persian founder of Manichaeism, a religion which challenged the country’s official religion, Zoroastrianism in the 3rd Century. For that, Mani was arrested and died as a prisoner of King Bahram. “Mani was a gifted painter who illustrated his written texts with a kind of picture books {Su}.”\n\nOther Religions\n\nHafez does not say anything about Manichaeism. Neither does he seem to say anything about Zoroastrianism, except once, when (at the time of the reign of Shah Shaikh Abu Eshaq) he calls for a morning wine cup as “in the rituals of the Zoroastrian religion {K198;8}.” Nor does Hafez mention any Zoroastrians, except the Moghan (Magis).\n\nUnder the generally tolerant Buyid rulers in the 10th and 11th Centuries, Fars was famous for having the largest Zoroastrian population of any Moslem province – every region of Fars possessed a fire temple. The Buyid rule ended in 1062, however, and by Hafez’s time in the 14th Century, the Zoroastrian community had survived “only as a convention” in his poetry with its references to Moghan (priests) { Li1:11}. In one ghazal, Hafez also mentions the Fars fire temples, but perhaps, again, merely as a convention {K245:4}.\n\nHafez mentions the words associated with the Zoroastrianism’s references to God (Yazdan) and Devils (Ahrimanan) in one poem {K380:9}, and the latter (Ahriman) in one more poem {K382:3}. More frequently, however, he uses the customary Persian word of his time for God (Khoda). The contexts in these ghazals make clear that Khoda is Hafez’s preferred word for the theological God: the creator of all things {K181:5}, the one you should rely on for mercy {K182:5 and 269:3}, and in whose name you make demands on others {K268:5}. He uses the Arabic Islamic word for God, Allah, at least in one ghazal in Persian language, in referring to Divine attributes {K452:9}.\n\nIn one ghazal, Hafez declares that “everywhere, be it a synagogue or a mosque, is the house of love {K78:3},” by which he implies it is both for worshipping (loving) the same God. In another ghazal, the same ecumenical tone is discernible about Christian religious institutions, where Hafez says that the rituals of the Christian monks’ monastery and the sign of the cross are among the decorations of the abode of a true lover of God {K64:6}.\n\nIn one ghazal, Hafez likens his beloved’s hair to zonnar, which was the belt the Christians were required to wear, so as to mark them as non-Muslims, thus forbidding to them the Muslim clerics’ garb {K304:4}. In another ghazal, Hafez blesses that sweet qalandar (heedless lover of God) who, traversing the stages of Gnostic path, recited the angles’ praise, using zonnar (the Christian belt) as the Islamic prayer beads {K79:7} [89]. In another poem, Hafez says, he liked the news that at dawn, a Christian raucously shouted at a tavern’s door that “if Islam is what Hafez practices, woe is me if there is a tomorrow {K481: 9 and 10}.”\n\nIslamic Rituals\n\nIn a ghazal, Hafez himself foresees that wine would shake the foundations of his religion {K222:5}. In another, he says that the amorous glance of the cup-bearer, destructive of Islam, is such that all but the most obedient Muslim cannot resist the wine {K183:4} [90]. In a third, Hafez says drinking wine in clerical garb is not an Islamic ritual {K193:6}. In another, he declares that he performs the Islamic ritual of washing oneself (taharat) with wine {K128:6}. Hafez is willing to sell his prayer-rug for wine {K369:2}; adding, in another ghazal. that a prayer-rug of the pious does not even fetch a cup of wine {K147:2}. Hafez would eagerly walk around the wine-vat, in a manner that is the ritual of Hajj around the house of God {K256:7}[91].\n\nHafez says his getting drunk is too insignificant to damage Islam’s honor {K219:6}. He adds that it is not such a great merit not to drink wine but remain an animal {K220:2}. Indeed, what earns merit is wine-worshipping {K388:6}. On the Judgment Day, the Islamic elder’s prayer beads and the garb of wine-drinking rend will rank equal {K241:8}.\n\nIn drinking wine and kissing the beloved’s lips, Hafez finds the elixir of eternal life (ab-e zendegani) {K423:1} [92]. In another ghazal, Hafez says wine-house is his palace and his beloved is the beauty (hoor), both of which the Islamic pious hopes to find in Heaven {K249:5}. He says he does not care for Heaven when he has the dust of his beloved’s street {K365:5}. He says, if he cannot reach the top of the palace of union with the beloved, he will be content with the dust of its threshold {K365: 8}.\n\nHafez says once he learned about the pilgrimage to the Ka`ba in the beloved’s place, he has had no desire for the one in Mecca (Hejaz) {K255:6}. He says the merits of the Hajj pilgrimage and fasting go to the person who paid homage to the wine tavern of love {K127:2}. He asks for a cup of “the wine of love, even though” it is the fasting month of Ramadan {K458:1}. In another ghazal, he repeats his request for two or three cups from the wine they sell in the tavern of love, e"
