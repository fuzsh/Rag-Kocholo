        "text": "Meerut played a significant role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which the British called the sepoy mutiny and the Indians called the first war of independence. Beyond its historical significance, Meerut is a vibrant city famous for its sports goods industry, busy markets, and diverse cuisine. It has a popular street food culture and offers a diverse array of spicy and flavourful dishes.\n\nThe city's cuisine is also heavily influenced by Mughlai and North Indian culinary traditions, offering a wide array of delectable dishes. One of Meerut's specialties is its aromatic and flavourful biryanis cooked with tender meat and fragrant spices. Kebabs, such as seekh and galouti, are popular street food delicacies, showcasing the city's love for succulent, spiced meats.\n\nMeerut is also famous for its sweets, particularly revri and gajak, which are sesame-based treats enjoyed during the winter months. Another sweet delight is the nankhatai, a buttery cookie one can find in local bakeries. The city's cuisine is a celebration of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian delights, with an emphasis on hearty meals and flavourful snacks. Here are some of the top dishes to try.\n\nNihari is a slow-cooked stew that is traditionally made with mutton. This dish is rich and flavourful, with a thick, spicy gravy that is typically enjoyed for breakfast. The meat is cooked overnight on low heat, allowing it to become tender and succulent, absorbing the spices and flavours thoroughly. Nihari is often served with naan or khameeri roti, making it a hearty meal.\n\nMeerut is known for its kebabs, which are a must-try for any meat lover. The city offers a variety of kebabs, including seekh, shami, and galouti, each with its unique taste and texture. These kebabs are made from minced meat mixed with a blend of spices, then grilled or pan-fried to perfection. They are typically served with mint chutney and onion rings and eaten with naan or tandoori roti.\n\nSamosas in Meerut are more than just a snack. These deep-fried pastries filled with a spiced mixture of potatoes and peas, sometimes even include lentils or minced meat. The samosas are crisp on the outside and packed with flavour on the inside, making them an irresistible treat for locals and visitors alike. They are usually served with tangy tamarind chutney or spicy green chutney.\n\nJalebi is a popular sweet in Meerut. It is made by deep-frying a wheat flour batter in circular shapes and then soaking them in sugar syrup. The result is a crispy, golden treat that is best enjoyed hot. Jalebi is often eaten at breakfast or as a dessert and paired with poha, lassi or milk.\n\nBedmi Puri is a traditional breakfast item in Uttar Pradesh, consisting of deep-fried puris made from a mixture of wheat flour and urad dal (split black gram) flour, spiced with a variety of seasonings. These puris are served with aloo sabzi, a spicy potato curry that complements the puris perfectly. This combination is flavourful and filling.\n\nThis traditional Indian dessert that is rich, creamy, and full of flavour is very popular in Meerut. Made by boiling milk until it thickens and reduces, rabri is sweetened with sugar and flavoured with cardamom, saffron, and a variety of nuts such as almonds and pistachios. The result is a luxurious dessert that is often served chilled and is a refreshing contrast to Meerut’s spicy dishes.\n\nChole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish that has found a special place in Meerut’s culinary scene. It consists of spicy chickpea curry (chole) served with deep-fried bread (bhature). The chickpeas are cooked with a mix of spices, tomatoes, and onions, creating a robust and flavorful curry. The bhature, made from fermented dough, are soft, fluffy, and a perfect accompaniment to the spicy chole."
