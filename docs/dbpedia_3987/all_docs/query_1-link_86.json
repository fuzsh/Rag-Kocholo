        "text": "Who Am I\n\nHey friends. Iâ€™m Ali Abdaal. A former doctor turned YouTuber, entrepreneur, podcaster and soon-to-be author. Iâ€™ve been creating YouTube videos for over 7 years and have amassed a following of over 4 million on my main channel.\n\nThis page is a little self indulgent, itâ€™s all about me. Hopefully youâ€™ll find it interesting though ðŸ™‚.\n\nQuick Facts About Me\n\nI studied medicine for 6 years at Cambridge University, graduating in 2018.\n\nI spent 2 years working as a Junior Doctor in the UKs National Health Service.\n\nI started my YouTube channel in 2017.\n\nMy first videos were about medicine and studying. Now I make content about productivity, books, tech, and evidence-based strategies and tools to help us be more productive and build a life we love.\n\nIâ€™m 29 years old. Born in May, 1994 in Pakistan. I now live in London.\n\nMy Journey From Student to Creator\n\nMy YouTube journey started back in 2017 when I was still a student at Cambridge University. I was studying to become a doctor (the dream was to specialise in plastic surgery). Back then, I started creating videos to help other people with studying and passing exams. This is when I started my first business with my brother, 6Med. We created a platform to help people pass the entrance exams and get into medicine.\n\nFast forward a few years and the videos I was creating started to be geared more towards productivity and passing on the knowledge that got me through medical school. Iâ€™d spend every spare minute I had planning the next video, writing scripts or researching ideas.\n\nBy 2020 Iâ€™d hired a small team to help me run the channel. With their help, I was bashing out a couple of videos a week whilst working as a junior doctor. Thatâ€™s when the idea of our Part Time YouTuber Academy came to me. I figured all the knowledge Iâ€™d gained on this journey would be helpful to at least 10 people, so we launched Cohort 1 of PTYA in November of 2020. Over 350 people joined lol."
