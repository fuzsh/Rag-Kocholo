Imiquimod, an immune response modulator, is currently Food and Drug Administration-approved for cutaneous actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinomas. Emerging reports have shown it to be effective in treating some periocular and conjunctival lesions. The authors present a case of a 68-year-old white man with recurrent actinic keratosis involving the pretarsal conjunctiva, which was successfully treated with 5% topical imiquimod following previous failure with cryotherapy and interferon Î±-2b. The patient had ocular irritation that resolved on cessation of treatment. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of conjunctival actinic keratosis being treated with and successfully eradicated by topical imiquimod.\n\nTreatment of cutaneous tumors with topical 5% imiquimod cream\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSabrina Sisto Alessi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available INTRODUCTION: There are various approaches to the treatment of cutaneous tumors; one of them is treatment with imiquimod, a synthetic toll-like receptor agonist with a low molecular weight that offers a topical, noninvasive, and non-surgical therapeutic option. The main objective of our study was to provide data on 89 patients who used a 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of cutaneous tumors at the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas from 2003 to 2008. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present our experience in the treatment of 123 cutaneous tumors of various types, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, Bowen's disease, erythroplasia of Queyrat, Paget's disease, and trichoepithelioma, with 5% imiquimod cream from 2003 to 2008 in the Cutaneous Oncology Group of the Dermatology Department of Hospital das Clinicas. Patients were divided into two separate groups according to their diagnosis and comorbidities; these comorbidities included epidermodysplasia verruciformis, xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism, basal cell nevus syndrome, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, HIV, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and kidney transplantation. Treatment duration, response to imiquimod, follow-up, recurrence, and local and systemic reactions associated with use of the drug were analyzed. Epidemiological data were obtained and cure rates were calculated. RESULTS: The ratio of women to men was 1.28:1, and the mean age was 63.1 years. Tumors were located mainly on the face, back, trunk, and legs. For patients with comorbidities, the overall cure rate was 38%. These specific patients demonstrated cure rates of 83.5% for superficial BCC and 50% for Bowen's disease. Aggressive BCC and superficial and nodular BCC did not present a good response to treatment. Trichoepitheliomas and nodular BCC showed a partial response, and erythroplasia of Queyrat showed a complete response.

Methods A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted to evaluate gene expression changes in actinic keratosis treated with imiquimod 5% cream. Male subjects (N = 17 with â¥ 5 actinic keratosis on the scalp applied placebo cream or imiquimod 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days for 4 weeks. To elucidate the molecular processes involved in actinic keratosis lesion regression by imiquimod, gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide arrays and real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed on shave biopsies of lesions taken before and after treatment. Results Imiquimod modulated the expression of a large number of genes important in both the innate and adaptive immune response, including increased expression of interferon-inducible genes with known antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune modulatory activity, as well as various Toll-like receptors. In addition, imiquimod increased the expression of genes associated with activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells, as well as activation of apoptotic pathways. Conclusion Data suggest that topical application of imiquimod stimulates cells in the skin to secrete cytokines and chemokines that lead to inflammatory cell influx into the lesions and subsequent apoptotic and immune cell-mediated destruction of lesions.\n\n[In-transit metastasis in melanoma: Efficacy of topical imiquimod combined with carbon dioxide laser or with electrocautery].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElfatoiki, F-Z; Longvert, C; Clerici, T; Bourgault-Villada, I; Roudier-Pujol, C; Vasseur, E; Saiag, P\n\n2014-02-01\n\nIn-transit metastases in cutaneous melanoma are common and difficult to manage. Therapy is mainly palliative. Use of topical imiquimod has been assessed for surface metastases. We report on four patients with cutaneous melanoma metastases treated with topical imiquimod associated with carbon dioxide laser in the first two patients and with electrocoagulation in the two others. For two patients, we noted complete regression of the lesions after 15 and 18 months. For the two others, treatment was stopped after 9 to 10 months because of progression of subcutaneous metastasis and distant metastasis. Topical imiquimod is an alternative treatment used in superficial in-transit metastasis of melanoma. Its use as a monotherapy is sometimes ineffective. We elected to use combined pre-treatment with carbon dioxide laser or electrocoagulation in order to potentiate the action of imiquimod. This simple and inexpensive therapeutic strategy constitutes a palliative treatment that can allow prolonged local control of cutaneous metastasis. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

A 60-year-old man presented with varying degrees of dysplasia on the soft palate. A cover plate was fabricated and the patient was prescribed 5% imiquimod cream, a topical imunomodulator, for six weeks. The lesion improved and histological examination of an incisional biopsy found no features of dysplasia. This case highlights the efficacy of imiquimod cream in the treatment of dysplasia, and the need for development of a preparation suitable for the oral mucosa. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016.

As the incidence of NMSC continues to rise, topical therapies will be used with increasing frequency. Topical therapies may benefit high-risk surgical candidates as an alternative treatment modality and may improve overall cosmesis. The most commonly employed topical therapies are imiquimod, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and diclofenac. To review the detailed mechanism of action and side-effect profiles of each topical therapy used to treat NMSC and to explore newly discovered actions. Uncommon adverse events are also presented. An extensive literature search was performed to describe the pharmacologic actions of imiquimod, 5-FU, and diclofenac. A keen understanding of the pharmacologic concepts of these topical therapies may aid the dermatologic surgeon in making sound choices before, during, and after surgery.

On the other hand, the efficacy of ipilimumab for nivolumab-resistant advanced melanoma is extremely poor. Therefore, additional supportive therapy for anti-PD-1 antibody therapy-resistant advanced melanoma has been widely investigated. In this report, we describe a case of multiple in-transit melanomas developing in a nivolumab-resistant patient successfully treated with ipilimumab in combination with imiquimod. Our present case suggested a possible therapy for nivolumab-resistant multiple in-transit melanomas using ipilimumab in combination with topical imiquimod.\n\nImiquimod 5% cream in topical treatment of facial basal cell carcinoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGrubor Svetlana D.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC is a non-melanocytic skin neoplasm originating from the cells in the basal epidermal layer, hair follicle shell or other skin adnexa. It is the most frequent skin malignancy. Treatment is surgical or nonsurgical. Cases reports: Herein we present 2 patients with superficial type of BCC and actinic keratosis of the face. The patients have been diagnosed by dermoscopy DermLite dermatoscope by 3Gen Inc. manufacturer, and skin biopsy has been performed for histopathological examination. The superficial BCC of the face has been treated with 5% Imiquimod cream once a day for 5 days in a week, during 4 weeks, with erosions and crusts until complete skin restoration. Conclusion: Based on these case reports, it could be concluded that 5% Imiquimod cream is safe and effective treatment for superficial BCC and represents an optimal treatment to achieve good clinical and esthetic effect for the patients.\n\nComparison of imiquimod, topical fluorouracil, and electrocautery for the treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: an open-label, randomised controlled trial.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRichel, Olivier; de Vries, Henry J C; van Noesel, Carel J M; Dijkgraaf, Marcel G W; Prins, Jan M\n\n2013-04-01\n\nAnal cancer is an increasing issue in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Screening for its precursor, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), is subject of discussion. Current treatment options are suboptimum and have not been compared in a prospective trial. We compared efficacy and side-effects of imiquimod, topical fluorouracil, and electrocautery for the treatment of AIN. In this open-label randomised trial, we included HIV-positive MSM older than 18 years visiting the HIV outpatient clinic of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Patients with histologically confirmed AIN were randomly assigned to receive either 16 weeks of imiquimod (three times a week), 16 weeks of topical fluorouracil (twice a week), or monthly electrocautery for 4 months. Randomisation was done with random block sizes of three and six, stratified for AIN grade (AIN grades 1, 2, or 3) and AIN location (peri-anal or intra-anal). Participants were assessed by high-resolution anoscopy 4 weeks after treatment. Responding patients returned for follow-up 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 72 weeks after treatment. The primary endpoint was histological resolution of AIN measured 4 weeks after treatment and AIN recurrence at week 24, week 48, and week 72 after treatment. The primary analysis was done in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all patients who had received their assigned treatment at least once. The trial is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR1236. Between Aug 12, 2008, and Dec 1, 2010, we screened 388 HIV-positive MSM for AIN by high resolution anoscopy. Of the 246 (63%) patients who had AIN, 156 (63%) were randomly assigned to either receive imiquimod (54 patients), topical fluorouracil (48 patients), or electrocautery (46 patients) following withdrawing of consent by eight patients. Modified intention-to-treat analysis showed a complete response in 13 (24%, 95% CI 15-37) patients in the imiquimod group, eight (17%, 8-30) of patients\n\nElectrocautery Superior to Topical Treatments for Precancerous Anal Lesions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

Whatling\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Topical Imiquimod is increasingly used in the treatment of lentigo maligna (LM for patients not suitable or willing for surgery. It acts as an immune response modifier and is recommended for use with caution in patients with autoimmune disorders. A review of the literature did not reveal any reported cases of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP with the use of Imiquimod so far. We report a case of a 55-year-old woman with a history of Addison's and Graves' disease who had been diagnosed with lentigo maligna on the right nasal ala. Within two days of commencing of topical Imiquimod treatment, she was admitted to the hospital with extensive cutaneous and mucosal bruising and treated as acute Idiopathic Throbocytopenic Purpura. Deranged platelets were reversed promptly with treatment and Imiquimod discontinued. We demonstrate that Idiopathic Throbocytopenic Purpura is a potential life-threatening side effect of Imiquimod treatment and patients who have autoimmune disorders are at increased risk of developing this side effect. We recommend that Imiquimod is contraindicated in patients with autoimmune disease. Here we describe the clinical presentation and review the relevant literature on Imiquimod treatment for lentigo maligna and its potential side effects.\n\nPharmacokinetics and safety of imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of actinic keratoses of the face, scalp, or hands and arms.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHarrison, Lester I; Skinner, Shari L; Marbury, Thomas C; Owens, Mary L; Kurup, Sarala; McKane, Scott; Greene, Robert J\n\n2004-06-01\n\nThe safety and efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream is being evaluated for the treatment of dysplastic lesions of the epidermis (actinic keratoses, AK). The objective of this clinical study was to describe the pharmacokinetics and safety of topical imiquimod during multiple dosing of AK subjects. A total of 58 adult subjects with 5 to 20 AK lesions at the treatment site applied imiquimod cream three times per week for up to 16 weeks as follows: 12 males and 11 females applied 12.5 mg imiquimod to the face; 11 males applied 25 mg to the entire balding area of the scalp; and 12 males and 12 females applied 75 mg to both hands and forearms. Pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed after the first and last doses, as well as biweekly. Imiquimod and its metabolites were measured in the serum and urine using sensitive liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry methods. Less than 0.6% of the applied doses was recovered in the urine of all subjects. Serum imiquimod levels were low, reflecting minimal dermal absorption, and increased with dose, although not proportionally. Peak levels at the end of dosing were 0.1, 0.2, and 1.6 ng/ml for the face, scalp, and hands/arms groups, respectively. A two- to fourfold accumulation was seen at the end of dosing. Local application site reactions were the most common adverse event, reported by approximately 50% of the subjects in each treatment group. The small number of systemic adverse events, including 'flu-like symptoms, were mostly mild and did not show a dose response. Thus, minimal systemic absorption and good safety margins for topical imiquimod were seen in AK subjects with doses as high as 75 mg three times per week for 16 weeks.\n\nClinical efficacy, safety and tolerance of the Kerawort (imiquimod cream used for treatment of anogenital warts\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM. R. Rakhmatulina\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Goal of the study. To assess the efficacy and safety of Kerawort (Imiquimod, 5% cream for topical administration vs. placebo used for treatment of anogenital warts. Methods and materials. The single-blind comparative placebo-controlled study involved 90 patients (44 female and 46 male with anogenital warts. The patients were randomized into two groups: the main group (n = 45 receiving treatment with Kerawort (Imiquimod, 5% cream and the control group (n = 45 receiving placebo. The diagnosis was confirmed by the identification of human papillomavirus by the polymerase chain reaction method. The patients received treatment three times a week until clinical signs disappeared but for not more than 16 weeks. Results. In 95.6% of patients from the main group and 8.9% of patients from the control group, anogenital warts disappeared completely or the quantity/area of pathological eruptions reduced at least by 70% as compared to the baseline. No relapses occurred during the treatment and follow-up period (28 days after the completion of treatment in patients from the main group. An increase in the size and/or area of anogenital warts and/or development of new eruptions on the skin and mucous membrane of the genitals were recorded in 11.1% of patients from the control group. No serious adverse events were revealed during the study. Conclusion. Higher efficacy (Ñ < 0.0000001 and comparable safety of Kerawort (Imiquimod, 5% cream for topical administration used for treatment of anogenital warts vs. placebo were reliably established.\n\nNova modalidade no tratamento do carcinoma basocelular periocular: imiquimode New aproach to periocular basal cell carcinoma treatment: imiquimod\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nErick Marcet Santiago de Macedo\n\n2007-12-01\n\nFull Text Available O carcinoma basocelular Ã© a neoplasia mais comum da regiÃ£o periocular, sendo responsÃ¡vel por 90% dos tumores palpebrais.

Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 agonist imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier and is effective for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers. Recently, the diagnostic role of the dermatoscope has been reported in the course of treatment of AK. In addition, mast cells are now considered to contribute to both the innate and adaptive immune systems in topical imiquimod therapy. We assessed the effect of imiquimod treatment by dermatoscopic and immunohistochemical findings in 14 patients with a total of 21 AKÂ lesions. With the dermatoscope, though the mean erythema score was not significantly different between the cured lesions and the unresponsive lesions, the erythema/red pseudo-network (\"strawberry\") pattern was decreased significantly in the cured lesions. By immunohistochemistry, the number of Ki-67-positive proliferative cells in the epidermis was decreased and that of CD117-positive mast cells in the dermis was increasedÂ in the responding lesions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the number of mast cells in the dermis was increased in AK lesions effectively treated with imiquimod. Our present result suggests that mast cells may contribute an antitumor effect in human skin treated with topical imiquimod.

They usually present with an erythematous plaque that may show fine or typical \"cake icing\" scaling or ulceration that may cause itching, pain, irritation, or a burning sensation. Although most cases are noninvasive, vulvar Paget disease may be invasive or associated with an underlying vulvar or distant adenocarcinoma. The histological evidence of so-called \"Paget cells\" with abundant pale cytoplasm in the epithelium confirms the diagnosis. The origin of these Paget cells is still unclear. Treatment of choice is wide local excision with negative margins. Obtaining clear surgical margins is challenging and may lead to extensive and mutilating surgery. Even then, recurrence rates are high, ranging from 15% to 70%, which emphasizes the need for new treatment options. A number of case reports, retrospective case series, and one observational study have shown promising results using the topical immune response modifier imiquimod. This study aims to investigate the efficacy, safety, and immunological response in patients with noninvasive vulvar Paget disease using a standardized treatment schedule with 5% imiquimod cream. Topical 5% imiquimod cream might be an effective and safe treatment alternative for vulvar Paget disease. The Paget Trial is a multicenter observational cohort study including eight tertiary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. It is ethically approved by the Medical-Ethical Committee of Arnhem-Nijmegen and registered in the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (CCMO) Register by as NL51648.091.14. Twenty patients with (recurrent) noninvasive vulvar Paget disease will be treated with topical 5% imiquimod cream three times a week for 16 weeks.

Although the effectiveness of several current biologic therapies have described this pathology as a IL-23, TNF-a and Th17-mediated disease, less invasive approaches are still in use and in need of refinement. One of these is the usage of narrow band-UVB (NB-UVB) therapy to deplete specifically intra-epidermal CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells to clear psoriatic plaques. In order to improve NB-UVB therapy, we sought to determine whether skin pre-treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) would help increase the efficiency of the former at resolving psoriatic plaques. Eucerin Â® Original Moisturizing Lotion (topical vehicle) or Aldara Â® (imiquimod 5% topical cream) were applied for 5 days once daily to a maximum contiguous area of 25 cm 2 (5 cm Ã 5 cm area). Patients were provided with sachets containing 12.5 mg of imiquimod each and were instructed to apply imiquimod (I) to two psoriasis plaques (5 sachets of imiquimod allotted to each plaque). A PHAROS excimer Laser EX-308 (Ra Medical Systems, Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA) with an output of monochromatic 308-nm light and pulse width of 20-50 ns was used for all patients. Punch biopsies of psoriatic lesions (6 mm) were taken at 4 and 48 h after final application of topical treatment with or without excimer laser treatment. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed according to manufacturer's instructions and Inmunohistochemistry was used as described before. Our results suggests that although IMQ seemed to activate the type I interferon pathway as previously described, its concomitant usage with NB-UVB for clearing psoriatic skin was ineffective. Although upregulation of genes MxA, GRAMD1A and DMXL2 suggested that IMQ treatment did induce skin changes in psoriasis patients, more optimal dosing of IMQ and NB-UVB might be necessary to achieve desired treatment responses. The observation that psoriasis involvement was not\n\nClinical Success With Imiquimod Alone and In Combination With Intralesional Interferon In Basal Cell Carcinoma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHayriye SarÄ±caoÄlu\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC is the most common type of skin cancer in humans. Surgery is still the gold standart for treatment of BCCs. However, there are also less-invasive, nonsurgical therapies such as imiquimod cream and intralesional interferon (IFN alpha-2b for the patients who are poor candidates for surgery and who care cosmetic outcomes. Objective: We report 11 BCC cases with various subtypes successfully treated with either imiquimod alone or in combination with interferon alfa-2b. Methods: Patients with various subtypes of histopathologically proven BCCs who were treated with imiquimod or combination of imiquimod and IFN alpha-2b between 2005-2010 years at our outpatient clinic are included in this report. Results: Of 11 patients we reported, only 4 patients (3 infiltrative, 1 solid types recieved intralesional interferon alpha-2b 3 million IU, 3 times a week combined with topical imiquimod. The rest 7 patients recieved only imiquimod 5% cream. All patients were cured with these regimens. Conclusion: Imiquimod is found to be effective not only in superficial, but also infiltrative, solid, and nodular types. Intralesional interferon alpha-2b is also known to be effective in BCCs and it has a synergistic effect when combined with imiquimod.\n\nImiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinomas: study of 10 cases Tratamento tÃ³pico do carcinoma basocelular superficial e nodular pelo imiquimod creme a 5%: observaÃ§Ã£o de 10 casos\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCyro Festa Neto\n\n2002-12-01\n\nFull Text Available BACKGROUND: Topical treatment with 5% imiquimod cream has been demonstrated to be effective in patients with basal cell carcinoma.

The objectives of the present study were to demonstrate the effectiveness of a 12-day course of imiquimod 5% for the treatment of actinic keratosis and to examine the association between treatment effectiveness and severity of local reactions. We included patients with at least 8 actinic keratoses treated with imiquimod 5% cream for 12 consecutive days. Local reactions were classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The statistical analysis of the association between local reactions and clinical response was based on the Pearson Ï 2 test and the Spearman rank correlation test. Sixty-five patients completed the study. Complete response was recorded in 52.3% and partial response in 75.4%. We found a statistically significant association between severity of the local reaction and response to treatment in both the Pearson Ï 2 test and the Spearman rank correlation test. A 12-day course of imiquimod 5% proved effective for the treatment of actinic keratosis. Severity of local reactions during treatment was correlated with clinical response. Copyright Â© 2017 AEDV.

Definition of the transmission mode, therapy, and follow-up for long term potential complications is important. A 27-month old girl was admitted with multiple pedunculated red-purple colored cauliflower-like lesions of 1.5 years duration. Clinical/histopathological and microbiological diagnosis was condyloma acuminate due to HPV type 16. After 12 weeks of imiquimod 5% cream application (pea-sized overnight three times per week, the perianal warts had completely disappeared. The mode of transmission of HPV 16 in our case was probably horizontal, related to the sharing of common personal hygiene items in the womenâs shelter. We report herein the case of an infant living in a womenâs shelter with giant condyloma acuminata due to HPV 16, which was successfully treated with topical imiquimod therapy. This patient should be followed up for recurrence and potential malignant lesions related to HPV type 16.\n\nAcantholytic Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris Associated with Imiquimod 3.75% Application\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNatasha Atanaskova Mesinkovska\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Imiquimod is an immunomodulator with both antitumor and antiviral properties. It is currently available in two cream formulations as Aldara (imiquimod 5% and the newly approved Zyclara (imiquimod 3.75%. Imiquimod has been associated with localized erythema, crusting, and scaling at the site of application. However, more severe generalized skin eruptions including erythema multiforme, psoriasis, and hyperpigmentation have been described. The newly approved imiquimod 3.75% cream is a presumably safer alternative due to its lower concentration. This paper describes the development of generalized acantholytic pityriasis rubra pilaris after the treatment of an actinic keratosis on the forehead with imiquimod 3.75% cream.\n\nAssociaÃ§Ã£o de aciclovir oral e imiquimode no tratamento de herpes simples genital hipertrÃ³fico em paciente com sida: relato de dois casos Association of oral acyclovir and imiquimod for the treatment of hypertrophic genital herpes simplex in HIV positive patients: report of two cases\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLÃ­via do Nascimento Barbosa\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Herpes simples crÃ´nico Ã© doenÃ§a capaz de gerar apresentaÃ§Ãµes exuberantes, principalmente em pacientes com sida.

The most probable mechanism of formation of these lesions is the invasion of the epidermal CD4 T cells by the herpes simplex virus. Due to the therapeutic difficulties and the high rates of treatment failure amongst these patients, new drugs are currently being discussed on the literature. Studies based on the immunophatology of these lesions have suggested that imiquimod might work as an adjuvant therapy to the antiviral drugs.

However, the ablative modalities are painful and not suitable for children. We aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of 2 of the painless modalities, viz., 5% imiquimod cream and 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Out of a total of 40 patients of molluscum contagiosum in the study, 18 patients in the imiquimod group and 19 patients in the KOH group completed the study. The given medication was applied by the patient or a parent to mollusca at night, 3 days per week. Imiquimod was continued till clinical cure; and 10% KOH, till lesions showed signs of inflammation. Assessments of response and side effects were performed at the end of week 4, week 8, and week 12. Significance was tested by Student's t test and Mann-Whitney test. The mean lesion count decreased from 22.39 to 10.75 with imiquimod and from 20.79 to 4.31 with KOH at the end of 12 weeks. We found complete clearance of lesions in 8 (44%) patients with imiquimod and in 8 (42.1%) patients with 10% KOH. Minor side effects were seen in 15 (78.9%) patients on KOH and 10 (55.5%) patients on imiquimod. The results of this study suggest that both 5% imiquimod cream and 10% KOH solution are equally effective in molluscum contagiosum though KOH has a faster onset of action. However, KOH solution is associated with a higher incidence of side effects.\n\nImiquimod in cervical, vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia: a review.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Witte, C J; van de Sande, A J M; van Beekhuizen, H J; Koeneman, M M; Kruse, A J; Gerestein, C G\n\n2015-11-01\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is in the vast majority of patients accountable for the development of vulvar, cervical and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN, CIN, VAIN); precursors of vulvar, cervical and vaginal cancers. The currently preferred treatment modality for high grade VIN, CIN and VAIN is surgical excision. Nevertheless surgical treatment is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and recurrence is not uncommon. The aim of this review is to present evidence on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of imiquimod (an immune response modifier) in HPV-related VIN, CIN and VAIN. A search for papers on the use of imiquimod in VIN, CIN and VAIN was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases. Data was extracted and reviewed. Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed; 16 on VIN, 3 on CIN and 2 on VAIN. Complete response rates in VIN ranged from 5 to 88%. Although minor adverse effects were frequently reported, treatment with imiquimod was well tolerated in most patients. Studies on imiquimod treatment of CIN and VAIN are limited and lack uniformly defined endpoints. The available evidence however, shows encouraging effect. Complete response rates for CIN 2-3 and VAIN 1-3 ranged from 67 to 75% and 57 to 86% respectively. More randomized controlled trials on the use of imiquimod in CIN, VAIN and VIN with extended follow-up are necessary to determine the attributive therapeutic value in these patients.

This transmissible cancer is usually fatal, and no successful treatments have been developed. In human studies, the small immunomodulatory molecule imiquimod is a successful immunotherapy, activating anti-tumour immunity via stimulation of toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7 signaling pathways. In addition, imiquimod is a potent inducer of apoptosis in human tumour cell lines via TLR7 independent mechanisms. Here we investigate the potential of imiquimod as a DFTD therapy through analysis of treated DFTD cell lines and Tasmanian devil fibroblasts. WST-8 proliferation assays and annexin V apoptosis assays were performed to monitor apoptosis, and changes to the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes were analysed using qRT-PCR. Our results show that DFTD cell lines, but not Tasmanian devil fibroblasts, are sensitive to imiquimod-induced apoptosis in a time and concentration dependent manner. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 and BCLXL genes, and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic BIM gene. Continuous imiquimod treatment was required for these effects to occur. These results demonstrate that imiquimod can deregulate DFTD cell growth and survival in direct and targeted manner. In vivo, this may increase DFTD vulnerability to imiquimod-induced TLR7-mediated immune responses. Our findings have improved the current knowledge of imiquimod action in tumour cells for application to both DFTD and human cancer therapy.\n\nA comparative study of 10% KOH solution and 5% imiquimod cream for the treatment of Molluscum contagiosum in the pediatric age group.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChathra, Namitha; Sukumar, D; Bhat, Ramesh M; Kishore, B Nanda; Martis, Jacintha; Kamath, Ganesh; Srinath, M K; Monteiro, Rochelle\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAlthough Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a self-limiting condition, active therapy could prevent further spread and improve cosmesis. Most of the available treatment modalities traumatize the lesions and have to be undertaken in the hospital, therefore evoking panic in children. In the quest for an alternative therapy, this study comparing 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and 5% imiquimod cream was taken up. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of 10% KOH and 5% imiquimod in the treatment of MC. This comparative study was conducted over a period of 18 months from October 2011 to March 2013, 40 patients between the age group of 1-18 years with clinically diagnosed MC were divided into two groups (lottery method), 20 patients were treated with 5% imiquimod cream (Group A) and the other 20 were treated with 10% KOH solution (Group B). Patients were followed up on the 4(th), 8(th) and 12(th) week of treatment. At the end of 12 weeks, out of 20 patients who received 10% KOH, 17 patients showed complete disappearance, whereas out of 20 patients who received 5% imiquimod, only 10 patients showed total clearance of the lesions. Adverse events were more frequent with 10% KOH, pigmentary disturbances being the most common. With only minor adverse effects, 10% KOH is an inexpensive and efficient modality for the treatment of MC in the pediatric age group. Although 5% imiquimod was effective in clearing the lesions with minimal adverse effects, the longer duration required for its efficacy may deter its wider use.\n\n[Imiquimod combined with dendritic cell vaccine decreases Treg proportion and enhances anti-tumor responses in mice bearing melanoma].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRen, Shurong; Wang, Qiubo; Zhang, Yanli; Lu, Cuixiu; Li, Ping; Li, Yumei\n\n2017-02-01\n\nObjective To investigate the therapeutic effect of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod combined with dendritic cell (DC)-based tumor vaccine on melanoma in mice and the potential mechanism. Methods Melanoma-bearing mouse models were established by subcutanous injection of B16-OVA cells into C57BL/6 mice. DCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow and propagated in culture medium with recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rmGM-CSF) and recombinant mouse interleukin-4 (rmIL-4). DC vaccine (OVA-DC) was prepared by overnight incubation of DCs added with chicken ovalbumin. C57BL/6 mice were separated into four groups which were treated with PBS, topical imiquimod application, OVA-DC intradermal injection and imiquimod plus OVA-DC, respectively. The tumor size was calculated by digital vernier caliper. Peripheral blood CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs of the tumor-bearing mice was detected by flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of splenic lymphocyte against B16-OVA was assessed in vitro by CCK-8 assay. Results Compared with the other three groups, B16-OVA-bearing mice treated with imiquimod plus DC vaccine had the smallest tumor volume. The percentage of CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs decreased significantly in the combined treated mice. The combined treatment enhanced significantly cytotoxicity of splenic lymphocytes against B16-OVA cells. Conclusion Imiquimod combined with antigen-pulsed-DC vaccine could reduce CD4 + FOXP3 + Treg proportion and promote anti-tumor effect in mice with melanoma.\n\nThe effect of imiquimod on taste bud calcium transients and transmitter secretion.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHuang, Anthony Y; Wu, Sandy Y\n\n2016-11-01\n\nImiquimod is an immunomodulator approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma and has adverse side effects, including taste disturbances. Paracrine transmission, representing cell-cell communication within taste buds, has the potential to shape the final signals that taste buds transmit to the brain. Here, we tested the underlying assumption that imiquimod modifies taste transmitter secretion in taste buds of mice. Taste buds were isolated from C57BL/6J mice. The effects of imiquimod on transmitter release in taste buds were measured using calcium imaging with cellular biosensors, and examining the net effect of imiquimod on taste-evoked ATP secretion from mouse taste buds. Up to 72% of presynaptic (Type III) taste cells responded to 100Â Î¼M imiquimod with an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations. These Ca 2 + responses were inhibited by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + -ATPase, and by U73122, a PLC inhibitor, suggesting that the Ca 2 + mobilization elicited by imiquimod was dependent on release from internal Ca 2 + stores. Moreover, combining studies of Ca 2 + imaging with cellular biosensors showed that imiquimod evoked secretion of 5-HT, which then provided negative feedback onto receptor (Type II) cells to reduce taste-evoked ATP secretion. Our results provide evidence that there is a subset of taste cells equipped with a range of intracellular mechanisms that respond to imiquimod. The findings are also consistent with a role of imiquimod as an immune response modifier, which shapes peripheral taste responses via 5-HT signalling.

A number of established treatments are available, including surgical excision. The emergence of new non-invasive treatment modalities has prompted the development of non-invasive optical devices for therapeutic monitoring and evaluating treatment efficacy. This study was aimed to evaluate the clinical applicability of a fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscope (CFLSM) for non-invasive therapeutic monitoring of basal cell carcinoma treated with Imiquimod (AldaraÂ®) as topical immune-response modifier. Eight participants with a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were enrolled in this investigation. Sequential evaluation during treatment with Imiquimod showed progressive normalization of the confocal histomorphologic parameters in correlation with normal skin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was able to identify characteristic features of BCC and allowed the visualization of therapeutic effects over time. Thus our results indicate the clinical applicability of CFLSM imaging to evaluate treatment efficacy in vivo and non-invasively\n\nPatient Perception of Imiquimod Treatment for Actinic Keratosis and Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma in 202 Patients\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nWaalboer-Spuij, Rick; Holterhues, Cynthia; van Hattem, Simone; Schuttelaar, Marie Louise A.; Gaastra, Menno T.

Aim: This study aims to present three cases with large BCC at the medial canthal area treated with IMQ 5% cream. Materials and Methods: IMQ 5% cream was used in three patients with ages 45, 49, and 73 who preferred medical treatment over surgery. Following incisional biopsy IMQ cream was used once a day, 5 times a week and the patients were followed up weekly during 12 week treatment period and monthly after the clearance of the lesion. Results: Erythema and erosion on the surface of the lesion, injection of conjunctiva, burning and itching sensation, epiphora and punctate keratitis were seen in all patients during the treatment period. The ophthalmic side effects could be managed by topical lubricating eye drops and the inflammatory reactions resolved within 1 month after cessation of therapy. The patients were followed up for at least 3 years without tumor recurrence and the biopsies taken from the suspected area were found to be tumor free. Conclusion: Surgical excision of carcinoma of the eyelid at medial canthal area can be difficult without causing damage to the lacrimal system and reconstruction of the defect may need grafts or flaps. IMQ may provide an alternative therapy to surgery in certain cases.\n\nTopical imiquimod before intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine for protection against heterologous non-vaccine and antigenically drifted viruses: a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, controlled phase 2b/3 trial.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Li, Patrick; Wong, Tin-Lun; Zhang, Ricky; Chan, Tuen-Ching; Chan, Brian Chun-Yuan; Wai, Harrison Ho; Chan, Lok-Wun; Fong, Hugo Pak-Yiu; Hui, Raymond Kar-Ching; Kong, Ka-Lun; Leung, Arthur Chun-Fung; Ngan, Abe Ho-Ting; Tsang, Louise Wing-Ki; Yeung, Alex Pat-Chung; Yiu, Geo Chi-Ngo; Yung, Wing; Lau, Johnson Y-N; Chen, Honglin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPretreatment with topical imiquimod, a synthetic agonist of toll-like receptor 7, significantly improved the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in elderly people. We aimed to clarify its effect in a younger age group. In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled healthy volunteers aged 18-30 years in early 2014 to receive the 2013-14 northern-hemisphere winter trivalent influenza vaccine at the Queen Mary Hospital, (Hong Kong, China). Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to one of the four vaccination groups: the study group, topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-Q-ID), or one of three control groups, topical aqueous-cream control followed by intradermal trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-ID), topical aqueous-cream control followed by intramuscular trivalent influenza vaccine (INF-C-IM), and topical imiquimod-cream followed by intradermal normal-saline injection (SAL-Q-ID). Randomisation was by computer-generated lists in blocks of four. The type of topical treatment was masked from volunteers and investigators, although not from the study nurse.

The number of MC lesions was counted and side effects were evaluated at 5 points during the treatment (the initial visit, week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12). Histological changes were compared between 2 patients of each group, before and after the 2 weeks of application. In both group, the mean lesion counts decreased all through to week 12, and the reduction in number of lesions were statistically significant in both groups (p <0.005). Over 40% of each group developed local side effects, and no systemic side effects were noted in either group. Before treatment, histological findings showed little or no dermal infiltrates. After treatment, specimens showed dense lymphocytic infiltrates, especially T cells, around the lesions which had resolved. Both 10% KOH solution and 5% imiquimod cream are effective and safe treatment of MC.\n\nCost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis of Ingenol Mebutate Versus Diclofenac 3% and Imiquimod 5% in the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis in Spain.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElÃ­as, I; Ortega-JoaquÃ­n, N; de la Cueva, P; Del Pozo, L J; Moreno-RamÃ­rez, D; Boada, A; Aguilar, M; Mirada, A; Mosquera, E; Gibbons, C; OyagÃ¼ez, I\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo perform a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of ingenol mebutate in the treatment of actinic keratosis in Spain. We used an adapted Markov model to simulate outcomes in a cohort of patients (mean age, 73 years) with actinic keratosis over a 5-year period. The comparators were diclofenac 3% and imiquimod 5%. The analysis was performed from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System based on direct costs (2015 retail price plus value added tax less the mandatory discount). A panel of experts estimated resources, taking unit costs from national databases. An annual discount rate of 3% was applied. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The effectiveness of ingenol mebutate-with 0.192 and 0.129 more clearances gained in treatments for face and scalp lesions and trunk and extremity lesions, respectively-was superior to diclofenac's. The total costs of treatment with ingenol mebutate were lower at â¬ 551.50 (face and scalp) and â¬ 622.27 (trunk and extremities) than the respective costs with diclofenac (â¬ 849.11 and â¬ 844.93). The incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios showed that ingenol mebutate was a dominant strategy vs diclofenac. Ingenol mebutate also proved to be more effective than imiquimod, based on 0.535 and 0.503 additional clearances, and total costs of â¬ 551.50 and â¬ 527.89 for the two drugs, respectively. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was â¬ 728.64 per clearance gained with ingenol mebutate vs imiquimod. Ingenol mebutate was a dominant treatment option vs diclofenac and was efficient vs imiquimod (i.e., more effective at a higher cost, achieving an incremental cost-utility ratio of<â¬30000/quality-adjusted life-years).

The study of psoriasis has historically been hampered by the lack of good animal models. Various genetically induced models exist, which have provided some information about possible mechanisms of disease, but these models rely mostly on intrinsic imbalances of homeostasis. However, a mouse model of psoriasiform dermatitis caused by the repeated topical application of Aldaraâ¢ containing 5% imiquimod was described in 2009. The mechanisms of action of Aldaraâ¢ are complex. Imiquimod is an effective ligand for TLR7 (and TLR8 in humans) and also interferes with adenosine receptor signaling. In addition, isostearic acid present in the Aldaraâ¢ vehicle has been shown to be biologically active and of importance for activating the inflammasome. Interestingly, the repetitive application of Aldaraâ¢ reveals a complex aetiology involving multiple cell types, cytokines, and inflammatory pathways. In this review, we will dissect the findings of the imiquimod model to date and ask how this model can inform us about the immunological aspects of human disease.

We combined imiquimod with a salicylic acid solution 15% (SA) on areas, with thick keratin, like palms and soles to increase its penetration through the epithelium. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. The first group was subjected to cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen every two weeks for a maximum of 3 months. The second group was subjected to treatment with imiquimod 5% daily for 6-10âh onto the warts for five consecutive days per week for a maximum of 3 months. Eighty-six children were included, 35 girls and 51 boys, 49 in the cryotherapy group and 37 in the imiquimod and SA group. At the end of the third month no statistically significant difference could be noted between the imiquimod 5% and salicylic acid and cryotherapy groups (pâ=â0.154). Thirty (81.1%) children treated with imiquimod 5% and salicylic acid were free from their warts in comparison to 33 (67.3%) children treated with cryotherapy. Imiquimod 5% cream as a monotherapy or in combination with SA can be used safely in children with warts and is equally effective and more effective than cryotherapy in plantar warts. Our study is not placebo controlled and spontaneous resolution cannot be ruled out.\n\n[Assessment of the treatment with imiquimod in persistent infection by human papillomavirus with the polimerase chain reaction method].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHernÃ¡ndez Quijano, TomÃ¡s; Illanes Aguiar, Berenice; Salas Linares, Natividad; AlarcÃ³n Romero, Luz del Carmen; HernÃ¡ndez Valencia, Marcelino\n\n2006-06-01\n\nMolecular studies have shown that oncogenic genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) are the main risk factor for cervical cancer development. Sub-clinical wound does not cause symptoms and is diagnosed by colposcopy or histology, in addition the latent infection is associated with the presence of DNA of the HPV, but when clinical and histological abnormalities are not presented only molecular techniques can detect this infection. To determine if complementary processing with imiquimod, recent medicament with powerful antiviral activity in vitro as in vivo, reduces the cervical persistence of HPV. This study was carried out with 87 patients, who had antecedents of HPV cervical and intraepithelial wound with low degree. Patients were divided as follows: treated with cryotherapy, cervical loop electrosurgical and imiquimod, all with diagnosis by cervical cytology, colposcopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV. At 3, 6 and 12 months after the processing, PCR, cervical cytology and colposcopy control were carried out again. Out of the 87 patients studied, 11% (10) patients treated with cervical cytology were positive for VPH; with colposcopy 8% (7) of patients and with PCR 40% (34) of patients; decreased persistence with combined methods of loop and imiquimod was obtained in 29% (5) patients; however, when utilized imiquimod alone, there were 55% (11) patients with persistence determined by PCR method. Imiquimod appears to be beneficial in 45% of the patients, in contrast with efficacy reported until 85% in genitals and annals warts, in addition, the capacity of eliminating the viruses has been shown, therefore it is possible that its potential effect could be observed long-time. It is evident that the percentages of viral detection are improved for PCR method, compared with indirect methods as cervical cytology and colposcopy, which is favorable when virus serotypes are of high degree of transformation and ablative methods should be conservatives due to\n\nFocal epithelial hyperplasia by human papillomavirus (HPV)-32 misdiagnosed as HPV-16 and treated with combination of retinoids, imiquimod and quadrivalent HPV vaccine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGemigniani, Franco; HernÃ¡ndez-Losa, Javier; Ferrer, Berta; GarcÃ­a-Patos, Vicente\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFocal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH) or Heck's disease is a rare, benign and asymptomatic mucosal proliferation associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, mainly with genotypes 13 and 32. We report a florid case of FEH in an 11-year-old Haitian girl with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Cryotherapy was previously performed on numerous occasions with no results. We decided to prescribe a non-invasive and more comfortable treatment. A combination of topical retinoid and imiquimod cream was well tolerated and led to an important improvement. The evidence of infection by HPV-16 detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, prompted us to prescribe the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (types 6, 11,16 and 18). Subsequent PCR sequencing with generic primers GP5-GP6 and further BLAST comparative analysis confirmed that genomic viral sequence in our case truly corresponded with HPV-32. This molecular misdiagnosis can be explained by the similarity between genomic sequences of both HPV-16 and -32 genotypes. At the 1-year follow up, we observed total clinical improvement and no recurrences of the disease. Complete healing in this case may correspond to a potential action of topical retinoid, imiquimod and the cross-protection mechanism of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.

In the course of several years different technics have been used with the goal of settling these kinds of lesions in a fast and safe way.Aim: To assess the response of the treatment of vulvo-perineal condylomas treated with 5% Imiquimod and the adverse events arised from its use.Material and methods: The studied population is constituted by 112 patients who presented vulvo-perineal condylomas. Pregnant and HIV positive patients were not included. All of them underwent a complete gynecological study and specifically, cytology, colposcopy, a PCR for HPV and a vulvoscopy to assess the location of the condylomas, size and number of such. Lesions were treated with Imiquimod 5% in cream at alternate nights. Tests were carried out to verify the results of the treatment at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The maximum time of application was 16 weeks.Results: The multiple locations were the most common, followed by those ones of the perineal area and the ano-fourchette. The disappearance of condylomas occurred in the highest percentage between 4 and 8 weeks of treatment, and 3 months later no lesions were 88.8%. 87,5% had no lesions at 6 months.The most common side effects were erythema and pruritus.Conclusions: In view of the results, the treatment with 5% Imiquimod can be considered as an alternative to other destructive therapies, which in turn, acts on the latent infection.\n\nDevelopment and Characterisation of the Imiquimod Poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxyethyl Methacrylate Hydrogel Dressing for Keloid Therapy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWei-Chih Lin\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The imiquimod-poly(2-(2-methoxyethoxyethyl methacrylate hydrogel (poly(MEO2MA hydrogel dressing was developed for the keloid therapy application. Four groups of the hydrogels, including the imiquimod-poly(MEO2MA hydrogel, crosslinked with 0.2 mol %, 0.4 mol %, 0.6 mol %, and 0.8 mol % of di(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross-linker (DEGDMA, were synthesised and characterised for fabricating the imiquimod-poly(MEO2MA hydrogel pad. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST of the poly(MEO2MA hydrogel was measured at approximately 28 Â°C and was used as a trigger to control the imiquimod loading and release. The loaded amounts of the imiquimod in the poly(MEO2MA hydrogel, crosslinked with 0.2 mol % and 0.8 mol % of DEGDMA, were about 27.4 Î¼g and 14.1 Î¼g per 1 mm3 of the hydrogel, respectively. The imiquimod-release profiles of two samples were characterised in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS solution at 37 Â°C and the released imiquimod amount were about 45% and 46% of the total loaded imiquimod. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 assay was utilised to analyse the cell viability of keloid fibroblasts cultured on the samples of imiquimod-poly(MEO2MA hydrogel, crosslinked with 0.2 mol % and 0.8 mol % of DEGDMA. There was around a 34% decrease of the cell viabilities after 2 days, compared with the pure-poly(MEO2MA hydrogel samples. Therefore, the developed imiquimod-poly(MEO2MA hydrogel dressing can affect the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts. It should be possible to utilise the hydrogel dressing for the keloid therapy application.\n\nRecent Advances In Topical Therapy In Dermatology\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohan Thappa Devinder\n\n2003-01-01\n\nFull Text Available With changing times various newer topical agents are introduced in the field of dermatology. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are immunisuppressants, which are effective topically and are tried in the management of atopic dermatitis as well as other disorders including allergic contact dermatitis, atrophic lichen planus, pyoderma gangrenosum. Imiquimod, an immune response modifier, is presently in use for genital warts but has potentials as anti- tumour agent and in various other dermatological conditions when used topically. Tazarotene is a newer addition to the list of topical reginoids, which is effective in psoriasis and has better effect in combination with calcipotriene, phototherapy and topical costicosteroids. Tazarotene and adapelene are also effective in inflammatory acne. Calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue has been introduced as a topical agent in the treatment of psoriasis. Steroid components are also developed recently which will be devoid of the side effects but having adequate anti-inflammatory effect. Topical photodynamic therapy has also a wide range of use in dermatology. Newer topical agents including cidofovir, capsaicin, topical sensitizers, topical antifungal agents for onychomycosis are also of use in clinical practice. Other promising developments include skin substitutes and growth factors for wound care.\n\nTranscutaneous immunization with a novel imiquimod nanoemulsion induces superior T cell responses and virus protection.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLopez, Pamela Aranda; Denny, Mark; Hartmann, Ann-Kathrin; Alflen, Astrid; Probst, Hans Christian; von Stebut, Esther; Tenzer, Stefan; Schild, HansjÃ¶rg; Stassen, Michael; Langguth, Peter; Radsak, Markus P\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTranscutaneous immunization (TCI) is a novel vaccination strategy utilizing the skin associated lymphatic tissue to induce immune responses. TCI using a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope and the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist imiquimod mounts strong CTL responses by activation and maturation of skin-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and their migration to lymph nodes. However, TCI based on the commercial formulation Aldara only induces transient CTL responses that needs further improvement for the induction of durable therapeutic immune responses. Therefore we aimed to develop a novel imiquimod solid nanoemulsion (IMI-Sol) for TCI with superior vaccination properties suited to induce high quality T cell responses for enhanced protection against infections. TCI was performed by applying a MHC class I or II restricted epitope along with IMI-Sol or Aldara (each containing 5% Imiquimod) on the shaved dorsum of C57BL/6, IL-1R, Myd88, Tlr7 or Ccr7 deficient mice. T cell responses as well as DC migration upon TCI were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. To determine in vivo efficacy of TCI induced immune responses, CTL responses and frequency of peptide specific T cells were evaluated on day 8 or 35 post vaccination and protection in a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model was assessed. TCI with the imiquimod formulation IMI-Sol displayed equal skin penetration of imiquimod compared to Aldara, but elicited superior CD8 + as well as CD4 + T cell responses. The induction of T-cell responses induced by IMI-Sol TCI was dependent on the TLR7/MyD88 pathway and independent of IL-1R. IMI-Sol TCI activated skin-derived DCs in skin-draining lymph nodes more efficiently compared to Aldara leading to enhanced protection in a LCMV infection model. Our data demonstrate that IMI-Sol TCI can overcome current limitations of previous imiquimod based TCI approaches opening new perspectives for transcutaneous vaccination strategies and allowing the use of this\n\nCombination of PDT and topical angiogenic inhibitor for treatment of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks: a novel approach\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYuan, Kaihua; Huang, Qiaobing; Huang, Zheng\n\n2009-06-01\n\nPort wine stain (PWS) birthmarks are a congenital cutaneous vascular malformation involving ecstatic post-capillary venules. Current standard treatment for PWS is the pulsed dye laser (PDL). Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used for the treatment of PWS in China since the early 1990's. Both can achieve a certain degree of color blanching in various types of PWS lesions. However, the majority of PWS lesions require multiple treatments. Some PWS lesions can recur or become darker after successful treatment. Recently, it has been proposed that this phenomenon might be initiated by neoangiogenesis that can be caused by treatment via wound healing response. The combined use of photothermolysis and a topical application of an angiogenic inhibitor such as Imiquimod and Rapamycin, were evaluated in several pilot studies. It is well-known that PDT can induce various host immune responses VEGF overexpression. Recent clinical data also show that improved clinical outcomes are obtained through the combination of ocular PDT and anti-VEGF therapy. This article will discuss rationales and implications of using such a combination modality and highlight recent progress based on our clinical experience and published data.\n\nDevelopment of nanovesicular systems for dermal imiquimod delivery: physicochemical characterization and in vitro/in vivo evaluation.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMa, Man; Wang, Jinping; Guo, Fang; Lei, Mingzhu; Tan, Fengping; Li, Nan\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe aim of the current investigation was to develop and statistically evaluate nanovesicular systems for dermal imiquimod delivery. To this purpose, transethosomes were prepared with phospholipid, ethanol and different permeation enhancers. Conventional ethosomes, with soy phospholipid and ethanol, were used as control. The prepared vesicles were characterized for size, zeta potential, stability and entrapment efficiency. The optimal transethosomal formulation with mean particle size of 82.3 Â± 9.5 nm showed the higher entrapment efficiency (68.69 Â± 1.7%). In vitro studies, permeation results of accumulated drug and local accumulation efficiency were significantly higher for transethosomes (24.64 Âµg/cm(2) and 6.70, respectively) than control (14.45 Âµg/cm(2) and 3.93, respectively). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of rhodamine 6G-loaded transethosomes revealed an enhanced retention into the deeper skin layers as compared to conventional ethosomes. Besides, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy studies were also performed to understand the mechanism of interaction between skin and carriers. What's more, results of in vivo studies indicated the transethosomes of imiquimod providing the most effectiveness for dermal delivery among all of the formulations. These results suggested that transethosomes would be a promising dermal carrier for imiquimod in actinic keratose treatment.\n\nFirst-line therapy for human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Peru using the TLR7 agonist imiquimod in combination with pentavalent antimony.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCesar Miranda-Verastegui\n\n2009-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Current therapies for cutaneous leishmaniasis are limited by poor efficacy, long-term course of treatment, and the development of resistance. We evaluated if pentavalent antimony (an anti-parasitic drug combined with imiquimod (an immunomodulator was more effective than pentavalent antimony alone in patients who had not previously been treated.A randomized double-blind clinical trial involving 80 cutaneous leishmaniasis patients was conducted in Peru. The study subjects were recruited in Lima and Cusco (20 experimental and 20 control subjects at each site. Experimental arm: Standard dose of pentavalent antimony plus 5% imiquimod cream applied to each lesion three times per week for 20 days. Control arm: Standard dose of pentavalent antimony plus placebo (vehicle cream applied as above. The primary outcome was cure defined as complete re-epithelization with no inflammation assessed during the 12 months post-treatment period.Of the 80 subjects enrolled, 75 completed the study. The overall cure rate at the 12-month follow-up for the intention-to-treat analysis was 75% (30/40 in the experimental arm and 58% (23/40 in the control arm (p = 0.098. Subgroup analyses suggested that combination treatment benefits were most often observed at the Cusco site, where L. braziliensis is the prevalent species. Over the study period, only one adverse event (rash was recorded, in the experimental arm.The combination treatment of imiquimod plus pentavalent antimony performed better than placebo plus pentavalent antimony, but the difference was not statistically significant.Clinical Trials.gov NCT00257530.\n\nImiquimod induced ApoE-deficient mice might be a composite animal model for the study of psoriasis and dyslipideamia comorbidity.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXie, Xinran; Zhang, Lei; Lin, Yan; Wang, Yan; Liu, Weihong; Li, Xue; Li, Ping\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPsoriasis patients are at increased risk of developing lipid metabolism disturbances. Both psoriasis and dyslipideamia not only closely interact in disease development, but occur as mutual side effects in some medicine treatment. The interactive mechanism of the two diseases is complicated and still unclear. Here, we proposed applying imiquimod on the dorsal skin of ApoE -/- mice to establish a composite animal model which formed psoriasiform skin lesions under hyperlipidemic condition. By comparison with corresponding wild-type(C57BL/6) mice, the composite mice model was evaluated by skin pathological features, lipid levels, immune inflammatory factors in order to clarify the diseases interplay mechanism. In addition, IL-17 mAb treatment was applied to observe the effect of IL-17 antibody on the composite animal model. The results verified that imiquimod-induced ApoE -/- mice model presented keratinocyte hyperplasia, parakeratosis, inflammatory cells infiltration and elevated serum lipid levels, and also reflected the complex interaction between inflammation and lipid metabolism. IL-17 mAb could inhibit psoriasis skin lesions with lipid accumulation via STAT3 pathway, but no influence on elevated serum cholesterol. Imiquimod-induced ApoE -/- mice model presented the pathological features of psoriasis and dyslipideamia, which could be an ideal composite animal model for the study of pathogenesis and pharmacotherapeutics of psoriasis and dyslipideamia comorbidity.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of imiquimod cream versus surgical excision in patients with low-risk basal-cell carcinoma. We did a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial at 12 centres in the UK, in which patients were recruited between June 19, 2003, and Feb 22, 2007, with 3 year follow-up from June 26, 2006, to May 26, 2010. Participants of any age were eligible if they had histologically confirmed primary nodular or superficial basal-cell carcinoma at low-risk sites. We excluded patients with morphoeic or recurrent basal-cell carcinoma and those with Gorlin syndrome. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via computer-generated blocked randomisation, stratified by centre and tumour type, to receive either imiquimod 5% cream once daily for 6 weeks (superficial) or 12 weeks (nodular), or surgical excision with a 4 mm margin. The randomisation sequence was concealed from study investigators. Because of the nature of the interventions, masking of participants was not possible and masking of outcome assessors was only partly possible. The trial statistician was masked to allocation until all analyses had been done. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical success, defined as absence of initial treatment failure or signs of recurrence at 3 years from start of treatment. We used a prespecified non-inferiority margin of a relative risk (RR) of 0.87. Analysis was by a modified intention-to-treat population and per protocol. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (ISRCTN48755084), and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00066872. 501 participants were randomly assigned to the imiquimod group (n=254) or the surgical excision group (n=247). At year 3, 401 (80%) patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat group.

A retrospective, propensity-score-matched, cohort study compared refill/repeat and adding-on/switching patterns and outpatient visits and prescriptions (health care resource utilization) over 6 months in patients receiving IngMeb versus those receiving imiquimod, 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac sodium, and methyl aminolevulinate or aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (MAL/ALA-PDT). The final sample analyzed included four matched treatment cohort pairs (IngMeb and comparator; n = 790-971 per treatment arm). Refill rates were similar except for imiquimod (15% vs. 9% for imiquimod and IngMeb, respectively; P < 0.05). MAL/ALA-PDT treatment repetition rates were higher than IngMeb refill rates (20% vs. 10%; P < 0.05). Topical agent add-on/switch rates were comparable. PDT had higher switch rates than did IngMeb (5% vs. 2%; P < 0.05). The IngMeb cohort had a significantly lower proportion of patients with at least one AK-related outpatient visit during the 6-month follow-up than did any other cohort: versus imiquimod (50% vs. 66%; P < 0.0001), versus 5-fluorouracil (50% vs. 69%; P < 0.0001), versus diclofenac sodium (51% vs. 56%; P = 0.034), and versus MAL/ALA-PDT (50% vs. 100%; P < 0.0001). There were significantly fewer AK-related prescriptions among patients receiving IngMeb than among patients in other cohorts. Results based on the first 6 months after treatment initiation suggested that most field-directed AK therapies had clinically comparable treatment patterns except imiquimod, which was associated with higher refill rates, and PDT, which was associated with significantly more frequent treatment sessions and higher switching rates. IngMeb was also associated with significantly fewer outpatient visits than were other field-directed therapies.

Despite increasing incidence it remains poorly researched. While not life threatening it can cause significant cosmetic disfigurement. Imiquimod, a cream which enhances the body's immune response, may help deal with the number of cases that occur in low-risk sites, especially when good cosmetic results and home use without surgery are needed. This study aims 1. To compare excisional surgery with imiquimod cream for nodular or superficial basal cell carcinoma in low risk sites, with respect to 3 year clinical clearance, cost-effectiveness and cosmetic results. 2. To ascertain if certain phenotypic features and gene polymorphisms predict tumour responsiveness to treatment. Methods/Design Five hundred participants with low risk nodular or superficial basal cell carcinoma will be recruited from hospitals to this multi-centre, randomised, parallel group, controlled phase III trial. Treatment in the imiquimod group is for 6 weeks for superficial basal cell carcinoma and 12 weeks for nodular basal cell carcinoma. Both treatment groups are followed up in clinic for 3 years. Primary outcome variable: the proportion of participants with clinical evidence of success (no recurrence at 3 years. The primary outcome will be compared between the two treatment groups. Secondary outcomes include: i clinical success at 1, 2 and 5 years, ii time to first recurrence, iii cosmetic appearance of lesion site after treatment, iv level of pain, and v cost-effectiveness. Safety and tolerability data will also be reported. Discussion This study protocol describes a pragmatic randomised controlled trial which it is hoped will address the above uncertainties. Three-year results will be available towards the end of 2010.

A search of Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane library using MeSH terms including \"topical,\" \"treatment,\" \"knee\" and \"osteoarthritis\" was carried out. Original research and review articles on the effectiveness and safety, recommendations from international published guidelines and acceptability studies of topical preparations were included. Current topical treatments included for the management of knee OA include topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, capsaicin, salicylates and physical treatments such as hot or cold therapy. Current treatment guidelines recommend topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative and even first-line therapy for OA management, especially among elderly patients. Guidelines on other topical treatments vary, from recommendations against their use, to in favor as alternative or simultaneous therapy, especially for patients with contraindications to other analgesics. Although often well-tolerated and preferred by many patients, clinical care still lags in the adoption of topical treatments. Aspects of efficacy, safety and patient quality of life data require further research. Copyright Â© 2018 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The analysis used a decision tree to calculate the clinical effects and costs of AK first-line treatments, IM (2-3 days), diclofenac 3% (for 8 or 12 weeks), imiquimod 5% (for 4 or 8 weeks), during a 24-month horizon, using discrete intervals of 6 months. A hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent adult patients with clinically confirmed AK on the face and scalp or trunk and extremities was considered. Clinical data on the relative efficacy were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Inputs concerning resource use derived from an expert panel. All costs were calculated from a Greek third-party payer perspective. IM 0.015% and 0.05% were both cost-effective compared with diclofenac and below a willingness-to-pay threshold of â¬30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (â¬199 and â¬167 per QALY, respectively). Comparing IM on the face and scalp AK lesions for 3 days versus imiquimod for 4 weeks resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of â¬10,868 per QALY. IM was dominant during the 8-week imiquimod period. IM use on the trunk and extremities compared with diclofenac (8 or 12 weeks) led to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios estimated at â¬1584 and â¬1316 per QALY accordingly. Results remained robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. From a social insurance perspective in Greece, IM 0.015% and IM 0.05% could be the most cost-effective first-line topical field treatment options in all cases for AK treatment.
