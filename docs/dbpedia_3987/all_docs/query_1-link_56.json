        "text": "Because gas station operators do not know a how much you will be spending, we have to authorize the pump for some amount – typically from $75 to more than $200 depending if the card is Debit, Consumer Credit or Commercial Credit.\n\nIf we authorize too little then an SUV or truck can’t fill their tanks. If too much, then some card holders would not have the funds and therefore could not make the purchase. For example, if the pump is authorized for $100.00 and $40.00 of gas is pumped then there will be a $40.00 charge and a $100.00 hold.\n\nHolds can last for up to 30 days. This is the decision of the Debit / Credit Card Issuer.\n\nWikipedia has a pretty good article on ‘Authorization Holds.” Read it here for more information:"
