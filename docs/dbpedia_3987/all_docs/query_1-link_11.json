        "text": "Mud Paintings\n\nSensing chemical and physical changes of microbial industry\n\nThis exhibition features art made with photosynthetic bacteria. This first painting, Winogradsky Rothko, appeared outside Mann Library in 2004. Winogradsky Rothko combines the work of a 19th century soil microbiologist -Sergei Winogradsky- with a 20th century colorfield painter -Mark Rothko. Since then, many pieces have been constructed to visualize the diverse liveliness of microbes in diverse ecosystems, ranging from pristine waterways to some of the most toxic superfund sites such as the Gowanus Canal in NYC. Of note, there is a new living painting (installed March 13, 2022) in the foyer of Mann Library. This project is made of mud from BeeBee Lake. The endogenous microbes will synthesize pigments and develop a transforming colorfield painting (March-September). This project connects back to my first 'mud painting' name Winogradsky Rothko (2004) also made from mud from BeeBe Lake. This time, the 2 vessel was made to reference two 19th century Japanese Landscape Paintings. One will have just Beebe Lake mud, the other will hold 10% biochar, a long-term carbon sequestration mechanism. Both frames will be outfitted with pH, eH and temperature sensors. As the outside visually changes, the chemical and physical characteristics will be logged here."
