        "text": "Heavy Metal Fans Spend More on Band Shirts Than Any Other Fan Group\n\nHeavy metal fans are always among music’s most passionate fans, and a new study offers up some statistics supporting that.\n\nAccording to a data study and survey from Custom Ink, heavy metal fans spend more on band shirts than any other fan genre. On average, heavy metal fans spend about $500 on band shirts in their lifetime. The average metal fan owns 10 band shirts. Of course, there’s a good chance anyone reading this has spent way more on band shirts and owns much more than 10 band shirts.\n\nThere was an unfortunate finding from Custom Ink’s study/survey: “Over 30% of Americans think you don’t need to know the artist’s music to wear their merch.”\n\nNow, we’re not saying you have to be an expert in an artist in order to wear their merch, but you shouldn’t be totally clueless either. Either way, this whole statistic feels like a debate for another day.\n\nWhy Heavy Metal Music Reduces Stress\n\nThis business about heavy metal fans and band shirts reminds us of a viral TikTok from June 2023 that touted the medical benefits of the genre.\n\nLicensed clinical psychologist Dr. Nicole Andreoli, PhD explains via TikTok, “Listening to any type of music can be therapeutic and can allow for an emotional release. Heavy metal is no exception.”\n\nShe continues, “In fact, heavy metal has been found to lessen negative emotions by reducing cortisol levels, which helps to lessen stress. Research has found that people who listen to heavy metal tend to think more logically and in more complex terms than those who don’t listen to heavy metal. Heavy metal has been found to help the most with focus”\n\nDr. Andreoli added, “Now, lyrics in heavy metal do tend to focus on rage, but there’s no research linking listening to heavy metal with a desensitization to violence. In fact, listening to heavy metal has been found to be a positive way to process anger safely.”\n\nJason Momoa: 5 Times He Was Hollywood's Best Metalhead\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
