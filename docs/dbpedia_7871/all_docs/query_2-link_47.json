        "text": "“Even Paul McCartney himself would have been grateful to come up with a song like No One Knows,” says BAFTA-winning actor and musician Matt Berry – the man who invited Josh Homme to cameo in his Channel 4 sitcom Toast Of London (more on which further below). “In terms of riff, melody and vocals, that song has it all and everything in between. It’s like a Beatles tune that finishes before you want it to, so you play it again and again. Some might say it’s the perfect Queens Of The Stone Age song, but actually No One Knows is a perfect song by anyone… just incredible.”\n\nIt’s not the only track penned by the QOTSA founder worthy of such high praise – from his early rumblings in stoner gods Kyuss through to the more eclectic experimentations of The Desert Sessions, Eagles Of Death Metal, Them Crooked Vultures and beyond, the Californian guitarist has set the benchmark for rock music time and time again. Here’s a look at the greatest moments across his genre-eclipsing career…\n\nTo be fair, a lot of musicians start their first groups around that age. But in Josh’s case this wasn’t just any band – and the four albums that followed would epitomise the very movement of stoner rock, paving the path for behind-the-beat Sabbathian fuzz at a time when heavy sounds were more angular than ever. Initially calling themselves Katzenjammer (the German word for hangover) in 1987 before rebranding themselves Sons Of Kyuss and then scaling back further, the coupling of Josh’s punk sludge and singer John Garcia’s Danzig-rivalling, golden croon would become genre-defining in every sense. By the time they were recording their Sons Of Kyuss EP, the guitarist was only 16 years old.\n\nFollowing 1991’s Wretch debut, the three Kyuss albums co-produced with Masters Of Reality stoner guru Chris Goss set the benchmark for psychedelic mastery and down-tuned heaviness. Truth be told, it’s incredibly hard to pick a favourite out of 1992 second full-length Blues For The Red Sun, its Welcome To Sky Valley follow-up two years later and final album …And The Circus Leaves Town. Each has its own individual merits.\n\nThe beginnings were humble indeed – the quartet performing at the desert parties which famously used gas generators for electricity, melting the minds of local crowds. By the end of 1993, however, they were touring with Metallica. Three years later and the band were no more. “Would we have bombed or stayed in the same place or enjoyed more success? I don’t know,” frontman John Garcia once told this writer. “It was a great ride, and a lot of good things came out of it – QOTSA, Them Crooked Vultures, The Desert Sessions, Brant Bjork, Mondo Generator, Slo Burn, Unida, Hermano. I’m just glad we’re all still friends.”\n\nWhile QOTSA’s debut proved the guitarist was more than capable of fronting his own band, it wasn’t until their second album, Rated R, where Josh began fully realising the sound they’d become known for. Dialling down the heavy sludge and fuzz in favour of syncopated polka rhythms and Stooges-y garage, tracks like Feel Good Hit Of The Summer and The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret would help make way for mainstream success, with one-time Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri now also in tow. Unlike its predecessor, the list of guest personnel was vast indeed – with Judas Priest’s Rob Halford, Scream/Goatsnake’s Peter Stahl and Screaming Trees’ Mark Lanegan and Barrett Martin being among the names lending a helping hand. These years also saw prolific output from Josh’s other project The Desert Sessions, recorded in a Joshua Tree ranch stacked full of vintage recording gear, working with names as highly esteemed as PJ Harvey and Soundgarden’s Ben Shepherd across 10 expansive and spontaneous albums.\n\nRare is it for supergroups to actually live up to their promise as much as Them Crooked Vultures. Best of all, their collective noise married flavours of all the celebrated music they had behind them without feeling obvious or predictable. The 2009 album wasn’t the first time Josh Homme and Dave Grohl had collaborated – the Nirvana/Foo Fighters legend having joined QOTSA for the Songs For The Deaf album and tour, and neither would it be the last, Josh appearing on the Sound City: Real To Reel documentary and soundtrack.\n\n“We met over a decade ago,” remembers Matt Berry, speaking exclusively to K! about how the QOTSA legend ended up getting his nose sliced off by his sitcom’s lead character, Steven Toast. “What blew me away was not only is he a brilliant songwriter, guitarist and everything, but he actually knew everything I’d done when I met him. When that happens you don’t know what the fuck to do… it’s like, ‘Jesus!’ Anyone with any kind of taste will be a QOTSA fan, won’t they?! Especially if they play guitar or listen to rock music.”\n\n“It all came about because I thought he’d be really funny in it – he’s from a completely different world that has nothing to do with London Theatreland. I knew he would stick out so extraordinarily… and he did! He was actually on tour at the time, needing to be at a venue around six, so I thought no way would it happen. You just don’t expect someone that big to get involved in niche British comedy, as such. It was a massive honour, one of those things that turned out very cool. We hang out a bit, whenever he’s in town we meet up and whenever I’m over there, I go and see him. I like to visit the studio and hear what he’s doing.”\n\nWhile there are certainly some magical moments on both 2005’s Lullabies To Paralyze and 2007’s Era Vulgaris, it was 2013’s …Like Clockwork that reinstated QOTSA as a band still with their best days in front of them. The music came during one of the darkest chapters of the QOTSA frontman’s life, following complications with surgery on his knee and bouts of depression during the recovery process. “I think I was just lost, looking for something in the dark… in that dark I found this record,” he noted, upon the release of the group’s sixth opus."
