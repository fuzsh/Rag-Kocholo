        "text": "For our second installment of ‘Metal Maniacs’, Ryder Whiffen of Sentimentipede tells us all about ten records that influenced his own musical journey.\n\nNirvana – Incesticide\n\nThis is the only non-negotiable spot on this list, it never changes. This is the perfect sample of Nirvana as I believe they were 95% of the time when they weren’t writing anthems for the disenfranchised youth all over the world. It’s just a compilation of b-sides and studio versions of some live staples. However, some standout tracks for me are “Mexican Seafood”, a gross, dissonant, and chaotic little number. Also, the song “Aero Zeppelin” is one of the most criminally underrated Nirvana songs. The riffs and the dynamic shifts are crazy.\n\nLead Belly – Lead Belly’s Last Sessions\n\nThis collection of songs from Lead Belly are just a small sample size of some of the all-time great rock n’ roll songs before it was even a genre. “Cotton Fields”, “Black Betty”, “House of the Rising Sun”, “Easy Rider”, “Where Did You Sleep Last Night” and “Goodnight Irene” just to name a few.\n\nCKY – Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild\n\nI think this album is a perfect ten as well. The fact that these are some very heavy tracks and very dark disturbing imagery in the lyrics but with such pop-influenced melodies to some of the vocals, it’s truly another level of songwriting that the guys in CKY achieved here. Three awesome tracks to get you started are “Flesh Into Gear”, “Plastic Plan” and “Inhuman Creation Station”.\n\nMonsterbator – The Libel Belt\n\nA local band at number four?! What the hey guy?! In all seriousness let’s get down to brass tacks, this album is a trip down a chaotic, anxiety-filled panic attack front to back. Genius tracks include “The Audition”, “The Flats”, “Cake Weasel” and “Parvo”. If you’re into grungy, noisy, screechy and chaotic music then this is for sure for you.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age – Queens of the Stone Age\n\nStraight out of touring with The Screaming Trees and the death of Kyuss, Josh Homme comes drenched in sludge and bong-rezz on this album. Definitely more in the line of stoner metal than desert rock, it’s a sludgy, dirty album with some hints at where Josh would go later in his career. Great songs like “Mexicola” and “If Only” really show what this record can do, but out of all the albums here, this one you should really take in the full record if you want to give it a chance.\n\nNelly Furtado – Loose\n\nMight come out of left field a little bit here but Nelly Furtado fucking rules. Sorry about my language. “Maneater” is an absolute bop from start to finish, much like this record. So are the tracks “Promiscuous” and “All Good Things (Come to an End)”, plus she’s a Canadian Queen and we love that.\n\nBoards of Canada – Geogaddi\n\nThis is a really awesome album. From chaotic tracks like “Gyroscope” and “Beware the Friendly Stranger”, your creepy urges are all looked after. Then you just get into some more trance like hypnotizing grooves like “Music is Math” and “Sunshine Recorder”.\n\nKing Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard – Murder of the Universe\n\nThis album and the accompanying KEXP live set turned me into a Gizzhead. Besides the fact they released over five albums in one year, Murder of the Universe stands out to me more than almost any other album. Through the DND-esque lore built around each saga the album tells, the text to speech narration that feels like you’re trapped in the uncanny valley, and finally to the absolutely face stabbing riffs that get you going from start to finish.\n\nPezz – Watoosh!\n\nOne of my favourite albums by the members of Billy Talent, even though it pre-dates Billy Talent. Tracks like “When I Was a Little Girl”, “Bird in the Basement”, “Nita” and “M&M’s” are all certified bangers. Just goes to show the boys were always insane musicians.\n\nJoy Division – Substance\n\nBesides the studio albums Joy Division had so many mind-melting songs! “No Love Lost”, “Leaders of Men”, “Dead Souls”, “Transmission”, all of these songs on this album are pure post punk bliss.\n\n~ Written by Ryder Whiffen\n\n~ Edited by Akhenaten\n\nSlowpoke – Slowpoke\n\nAugust 22nd, 2021\n\nStoner / Doom Metal\n\nIndependently Released\n\nSt. John’s, Newfoundland\n\nSlowpoke is the long awaited debut record from the stoner and doom metal trio of the same name. Consisting of frontman and bassist Ben Chapman-Smith, guitarist Cameron Legge, and drummer Adam Young, Slowpoke have arisen in the east Canadian doom metal scene with a record that boasts beefy riffs, a few guest features, and lyrical subject matter that will likely hit close to home for many St. John’s metalheads. So let’s dive in and find out how this record stands up against the riff-laden sea of sludge full of bands who are more or less retreading old ground.\n\nThe record has a somewhat interesting beginning, opening up with a bass intro reminiscent of the Motorhead classic “Ace of Spades” on the cleverly titled “Stony Iommi”, before launching into a furiously fast series of thrashing drums combined with a punk approach to the guitars. The track blazes along way faster than you’d expect of a typical band underneath the stoner or doom umbrella, though I feel like I’m getting shades of groups like Mondo Generator and the Melvins on here. The band manages to bring a much faster approach to the stoner genre to the table on this track without sacrificing the atmosphere that the genre typically cultivates. The song does eventually transition into a much slower and atmospheric, almost meditative bridge that brings to mind groups like Kamchatka or Samsara Blues Experiment. This slow, plodding section begins quietly but gradually builds more in volume as the electric guitars begin to duel back and forth between the left and right channels as the acoustic guitars bring up the rear. Near the end the song dips into some Kyuss-esque territory that also conjures vibes of music from the Kyuss diaspora groups like Brant Bjork. At nine and a half minutes long this track certainly brings the thunder as an opener, setting up a strong vantage point from which to continue engaging the listener.\n\n“Slumlord” tips your expectations right on their head, however, as it’s a much shorter, conventional barn burner of a rock and roll track. Reminding me of groups like fellow Canadians, Diner Drugs and Doors & Fours, in the way that the riffs are combined with fast, punky, Motorhead-esque drums. Lyrically the song is, rather obviously, about a shitty, unreasonable, disrespectful landlord, something that many of us can relate to, especially in these times of ever increasing housing insecurity. It’s a catchy little ditty that would be well served with a music video, however my main criticism lies in the vocals. It feels like Ben might not be putting as much emphasis on the cleans as perhaps he should. Maybe it has more to do with the mixing, but I just feel like there isn’t as much power in the cleans as there are in the much beefier and gruffer harsh vocals.\n\nWe then come to “Sid the Cat”, a track about a famous city cat affectionately named Sid that residents of downtown St. John’s are all too familiar with, especially since he would regularly chill indoors in bars like Distortion. Musically the song feels much more bluesy than any of the other tracks on this record, making good use of the classic blues scale used by musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan. There’s a distinct Clutch-esque sound to this sound, though admittedly with a bit of a heavier slant on the guitars, a la a group like House of Broken Promises. I think the clean vocals are better presented in this track, but the harshes are provided by guest vocalist Al Yeti Bones of the band Gypsy Chief Goliath, and he definitely brings a feeling of grandiosity and intensity to the vocal styling present on this track.\n\n“Miami Camo” is one of the slower songs on the record, delving headfirst into some stoner rock tropes with its meditative vibes. Things do change up during the chorus where the pace seems to slightly quicken, and there’s a faster section during the bridge, but overall the song keeps things mid-tempo. Vocally I think this might be Chapman-Smith’s best performance, regarding both clean and harsh vocals. There’s some real power behind the cleans and the growls on here that draw me in. Instrumentally, however, it doesn’t really do much for me. In terms of the riffs and the catchiness of this track I think it’s the least memorable cut on the record.\n\nThe following track, however, “Windtalker”, exhibits much more standard rock and roll style riffs, performed in a waltz, and they’re catchy as hell. This song feels like it could’ve easily been written by The Damned Things, from the instrumentation, to the vocal melodies, to the highly melodic, bluesy and harmonized guitar solo. If it wasn’t for the production value and the differences between Chapman-Smith and Keith Buckley’s vocals I would think this was a Damned Things demo. There are shades of other bands like Audrey Horne on here as well, and overall this is probably my favourite track on this record for that reason. I’ve always said I’m a sucker for a catchy hook and this song delivers on that in spades.\n\n“Sanctuary” continues this similarly melodic and simplistic approach to songwriting, presenting some pretty damn catchy hooks throughout its seven and a half minute runtime. I’m reminded of groups like Priestess in the approach to heavy yet highly earwormy riffs, but the song doesn’t stick to one style. There are moments where the guitars chug along like Mastodon while the bass thuds against the inside of my skull like a depth charge. The track doesn’t hold back from including some Josh Homme-esque “woah woahs” during the bridge before going full 60’s psychedelia with the addition of an organ to the song’s already melancholic texture profile.\n\nWe then come to the namesake of both the record and the band itself with the nine minute closer song “Slowpoke”. This is by far the closest the band gets to ‘epic’ on this album. It’s slow and plodding in a similar fashion to some of the slower and moodier songs a group like Baroness might engage in. It’s dark and atmospheric and laden with organ passages that give it a spooky tinge unlike any of the other songs on this album. Around the halfway point the track sort of goes into this long winded breakdown that’s focused on the repetition of this one riff with slight variations, and helps reinforce the (there’s that word again) meditative vibe given off by both this song and several others on this record. We also get some guest vocals from Gordon McCready, formerly of the band Headloss and currently of Smyth Valley, though I feel like he was relatively underused, only showing up for one verse. I feel like if you’re gonna end your record with a nine minute cut and you have a guest vocalist in on it, why not utilize them a little bit more?\n\nOverall I think Slowpoke’s debut is pretty strong for a first record. The band clearly has a lot of love for other bands and artists that span the gamut of the ‘riff filled land’, drawing influence from poppier rock acts like Queens of the Stone Age as much as they do the heavier side of things like High on Fire. There’s a diversity of sound going on here, from the hard rock assault of “Windtalker” to the bluesiness of “Sid the Cat”. You’d be hard pressed to find much in the way of sameness on this album. I think the band does a generally good job of writing catchy and memorable tracks, though there are a few tracks that are duds for me personally. I also think the production leaves the record feeling a bit too fuzzed out for my liking, as there are occasions where aspects of certain songs feel muddled and lost in the muck of the stonery fog. Perhaps that was done on purpose, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was, but I would have liked a little more clarity.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7/10\n\nGood\n\nFavourite Tracks:\n\n“Stony Iommi”\n\n“Windtalker”\n\n“Sanctuary”\n\nFor Fans Of:\n\nKyuss\n\nClutch\n\nQueens of the Stone Age\n\nPriestess\n\n~ Akhenaten"
