        "text": "Following the untimely death of their regular composer Howard Ashman, who, alongside Alan Menken, had written the soundtracks for The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, Walt Disney Feature Animation were forced to look elsewhere for 1994's The Lion King. As their first film ever based on an original story, and their first to consist entirely of animal characters, the Mouse House was already taking something of a gamble. And they further refused to play it safe by appointing a pop star with no prior experience of the Hollywood machine.\n\nLuckily, the leftfield choice of British national treasure Elton John (then without his Sir title), proved to be a masterstroke. Alongside Tim Rice, the lyricist best-known for his musical theater work with Andrew Lloyd Webber, the Rocket Man delivered five instant classics. Not only did the likes of \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\" \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" and \"Circle of Life\" perfectly help push forward the narrative, but they also helped push the film to awards glory at the Oscars and GRAMMYs, a colossal box office figure of nearly one billion dollars, and permanent residency in the pop culture landscape.\n\nOf course, John and Rice can't take all the credit for Lion King's roaring success. Acclaimed composer Hans Zimmer also came on board to give an orchestral touch to the Shakespeare-inspired tale of an heir apparent, who after escaping his wicked uncle's clutches, returns years later to reclaim his rightful position. And professional singers Carmen Twillie, Sally Dworsky, and Kristle Edwards joined household names such as Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg, and Rowan Atkinson in the recording booth, further driving the massive impact of the movie and its music.\n\nThirty years after it first enamored the Blockbuster generation, we take a look at how The Lion King still sits at the top of the Disney soundtrack throne.\n\nIt's Still The Biggest Selling Disney Soundtrack\n\nForget The Jungle Book, Beauty and the Beast, or the more recent musical phenomenon that is Frozen. When it comes to pure sales, the runaway Disney soundtrack leader is The Lion King. The Rice/John/Zimmer collaboration shifted nearly five million copies domestically in 1994 alone. And its impressive worldwide total is now triple that amount.\n\nIt's a figure that also places The Lion King in the top 10 best-selling soundtracks of all time. Indeed, it's Disney's only representative in the list, which includes Prince's Purple Rain, James Horner's Titanic, and Bee Gees' Saturday Night Fever, as well as the \"I Will Always Love You\"-featuring The Bodyguard at No. 1. (It still has a way to go to beat John's commercial peak, though. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has reportedly sold an astonishing 20 million since its release in 1973.)\n\nIt Made GRAMMY History\n\nIt wasn't just at the box office where Disney firmly established its second golden age. Before the release of 1989's The Little Mermaid, the Mouse House hadn't attracted GRAMMYs attention once. By the turn of the century, however, they'd racked up a remarkable 30 nominations and 17 wins — and The Lion King played a major part in this awards dominance.\n\nIn fact, it made history by becoming the first Disney winner of both Best Male Pop Vocal Performance (\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\") and Best Musical Album For Children, while \"Circle of Life\" picked up Best Instrumental Arrangement With Accompanying Vocals, too. The Lion King also followed in the footsteps of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin by picking up the Academy Awards for both Best Original Song and Best Original Score.\n\nIt Started A Trend Of Pop Artist Composers\n\nWhile Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle had all previously lent their vocals to Disney's second golden age, The Lion King was the studio's first soundtrack to give a pop star composing duties. Alongside Tim Rice, the celebrated lyricist who'd worked on Aladdin, Elton John wrote all five of the album's vocal numbers. And it was a setup that appeared to give several of his peers ideas.\n\nRandy Newman had already picked up Academy Award nods for his composing talents on 1981's Ragtime. But it wasn't until 1995's Toy Story that the singer/songwriter began the fruitful Disney animation partnership that would also take in the Monsters Inc. and Cars franchises. In 1999, Phil Collins co-wrote and performed the entirety of Tarzan's pop soundtrack. And four years later, Carly Simon decided to get in on the Mouse House action by pulling double duty on seven songs for Piglet's Big Movie.\n\nIt Introduced Hans Zimmer To Animation\n\nThe Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Madagascar, and The Simpsons Movie are just a few of the hit animations to have benefitted from Hans Zimmer's Midas touch. But it wasn't until 12 years into his career that the German composer proved that his talents could be used just as effectively in the world of animation as live-action. And The Lion King was the catalyst.\n\nZimmer provided four instrumental pieces for the Disney phenomenon including \"This Land,\" \"To Die For,\" and \"King of Pride Rock,\" also bagging two GRAMMYS, an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his efforts. And as he told Classic FM while promoting his work on the 2019 remake, he has a certain family member to thank. \"My daughter was 6 years old. I'd never been able to take her to any premieres, and Dad likes to show off.\"\n\nIt Spawned Several Crossover Hits\n\nAlthough Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin had both spawned big Hot 100 hits (the chart-topping \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Dion and Bryson's \"A Whole New World,\" respectively), The Lion King was the first Disney soundtrack to produce two. \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" reached No. 4 in the U.S. (and No.1 in Canada and France), while \"Circle of Life\" peaked at No. 18. Even \"Hakuna Matata\" saw some Billboard action, gracing both the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Bubbling Under charts.\n\nYou're unlikely to ever see Elton John performing the latter – four of the film's cast members including Nathan Lane provided the vocals. But the two official singles have remained staples of both his live shows and countless compilations ever since. And they've crossed over to the Spotify age, too, with \"Circle of Life\" racking up103 million streams and \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" a whopping 322 million.\n\nIt Birthed Broadway's Biggest Hit\n\nHitting the New Amsterdam Theatre in October 1997, The Lion King wasn't the first Disney animation to get a Broadway stage adaptation (Beauty and the Beast had opened at the Palace Theatre three years earlier) — but it remains the biggest. In fact, thanks to a run of 8,500 shows, its $1 billion-plus gross is now the highest in the theater district's history.\n\nThe Lion King has also made it around the world, picking up numerous Tony and Olivier Awards along the way. And as you'd expect, the film soundtrack's pop numbers have been just as pivotal to the theater production's success as its immersive set design, powerhouse performances, and jaw-dropping puppetry.\n\nThose lucky enough to see the spectacle before 2010 would also have enjoyed something of a lost classic. Sung by Mufasa's hornbill advisor Zazu, the John/Rice-penned \"The Morning Report\" was omitted from the 1994 film but enjoyed a 13-year run in the stage show's opening act.\n\nIt Covers A Vast Range of Styles\n\n\"The plan was that we wouldn't write the usual Broadway-style Disney score,\" John later wrote in his 2019 memoir, Me, about his and Rice's approach to the film. \"But try and come up with pop songs that kids would like.\"\n\nIndeed, while the partnership of Menken and Ashman grounded their Disney sing-alongs in the worlds of musical theater and Tin Pan Alley, the new dream team were determined to venture outside the Mouse House's comfort zone.\n\nThe Lion King OST boasts everything from carefree novelty sing-alongs (\"Hakuna Matata\") and emotive showstoppers (\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\") to campy villain songs (\"Be Prepared\") and rumba rockabilly (\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\"). And then there's Zimmer's instrumental pieces that typically begin with cinematic strings before building up to a Zulu choir crescendo, immediately transporting listeners to the vast landscape of Pride Rock.\n\nIt Kickstarted Elton John's Second Career\n\n\"I sat there with a line of lyrics that began, 'When I was a young warthog,'\" John told Time magazine in 1995 about the inception of The Lion King soundtrack, \"and I thought, 'Has it come to this?'\"\n\nThe pop legend needn't have worried. The song in question, \"Hakuna Matata,\" might not have been his most lyrically sophisticated. But the comic interlude proved that John could put an infectious melody to literally any subject. And alongside his four other contributions, it gave him the impetus to further explore the world of musical theater.\n\nThe Brit subsequently reunited with Rice for 2000's Aida, a pop-oriented adaptation of Giuseppi Verdi's same-named opera which earned a GRAMMY for Best Musical Show Album in 2001. And then in 2005, John struck Broadway gold once again with the multiple Tony Award-winning screen-to-stage transfer of ballet drama Billy Elliot. That same year, he also teamed up with regular collaboratorBernie Taupin on the score for Lestat, a musical version of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.\n\nIt Formed Part Of The 2019 Remake\n\nProof of just how well The Lion King soundtrack has endured came in 2019 when Jon Favreau's live-action remake borrowed all five of its vocal numbers. The performers were different, of course — see the likes of John Oliver on \"I Just Can't Wait To Be King,\" Beyoncé and Donald Glover on \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\" and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner on \"Hakuna Matata.\" But while Zimmer's reimaginings gave them an additional African flavor, the songs didn't stray too far from the source material.\n\nBut even with a starrier cast and a bunch of new compositions and covers, the new Lion King OST failed to strike the same chord with the cinemagoing public, selling just a fraction of its predecessor. Even Beyoncé's flagship single \"Spirit\" failed to peak any higher than No. 98 on the Hot 100. Sometimes, the originals truly are the best.\n\nHow 1995 Became A Blockbuster Year For Movie Soundtracks\n\nWhile in a studio, Andrew Watt bounces off the walls. Just ask Mick Jagger, who once had to gently tell the 33-year-old, \"Look, I can deal with this, but when you meet Ronnie and Keith, you have to dial it down a little bit.\"\n\nOr ask Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard. \"He really got the best out of [drummer] Matt [Cameron] just by being excited — literally jumping up and down and pumping his fist and running around,\" he tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nAs Watt's hot streak has burned on, reams have rightly been written about his ability to take a legacy act, reconnect them with their essence, and put a battery in their back. His efficacy can be seen at Music's Biggest Night: Ozzy Osbourne's Patient Number 9 won Best Rock Album at the 2023 GRAMMYs. At the last ceremony, the Rolling Stones were nominated for Best Rock Song, for Hackney Diamonds' opener \"Angry.\"\n\nOn Pearl Jam's return to form, Dark Matter, due out April 19. Who was behind the desk? Take a wild guess.\n\n\"You want to see them live more than you want to listen to their albums, and they have the ability to look at each other and play and follow each other. I don't like my rock music any other way, as a listener,\" Watt tells GRAMMY.com. \"All my favorite records are made like that — of people speeding up, slowing down, playing longer than they should.\"\n\nAs such, Watt had a lightbulb moment: to not record any demos, and have them write together in the room. \"They're all playing different stuff, and it makes up what Pearl Jam is, and singer Eddie [Vedder] rides it like a wave.\"\n\nIf you're more of a pop listener, there's tons of Watt for you — he's worked with Justin Bieber (\"Hit the Ground\" from Purpose), Lana Del Rey (\"Doin' Time\" from Norman F—ing Rockwell) and much more. Read on for a breakdown of big name rockers who have worked with Andrew Watt.\n\nPearl Jam / Eddie Vedder\n\nWatt didn't just produce Dark Matter; he also helmed Vedder's well-received third solo album, Earthling, from 2022. Watt plays guitar in Vedder's live backing band, known as the Earthlings — which also includes Josh Klinghoffer, who replaced John Frusciante in the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a stint.\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nDark Matter was a comeback for Pearl Jam, but Hackney Diamonds was really a comeback for the Stones. While it had a hater or two, the overwhelming consensus was that it was the Stones' best album in decades — maybe even since 1978's Some Girls.\n\n\"I hope what makes it fresh and modern comes down to the way it's mixed, with focus on low end and making sure the drums are big,\" Watt, who wore a different Stones shirt every day in the studio, has said about Hackney Diamonds. \"But the record is recorded like a Stones album.\"\n\nWhere there are modern rock flourishes on Hackney Diamonds, \"There's no click tracks. There's no gridding. There's no computer editing,\" he continued. \"This s— is performed live and it speeds up and slows down. It's made to the f—ing heartbeat connection of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Steve Jordan.\n\n\"And Charlie,\" Watt added, tipping a hat to Watts, who played on Hackney Diamonds but died before it came out. \"When Charlie's on it.\"\n\nIggy Pop\n\nEver since he first picked up a mic and removed his shirt, the snapping junkyard dog of the Stooges has stayed relevant — as far as indie, alternative and punk music has been concerned.\n\nBut aside from bright spots like 2016's Josh Homme-produced Post Pop Depression, his late-career output has felt occasionally indulgent and enervated. The 11 songs on 2023's eclectic Watt-produced Every Loser, on the other hand, slap you in the face in 11 different ways.\n\n\"We would jam and make tracks and send them to Iggy, and he would like 'em and write to them or wouldn't like them and we'd do something else,\" Watt told Billboard. \"It was very low pressure. We just kept making music until we felt like we had an album.\" (And as with Pearl Jam and Vedder's Earthlings band, Watt has rocked out onstage with Pop.\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nYou dropped your crown, O Prince of Darkness. When he hooked up with Watt, the original Black Sabbath frontman hadn't released any solo music since 2010's Scream; in 2017, Sabbath finally said goodbye after 49 years and 10 (!) singers.\n\nOn 2020's Ordinary Man and 2022's Patient Number 9, Watt reenergized Ozzy; even when he sounds his age, Ozz sounds resolute, defiant, spitting in the face of the Reaper. (A bittersweet aside: the late Taylor Hawkins appears on Patient Number 9, which was written and recorded in just four days.)\n\nMaroon 5\n\nYeah, yeah, they're more of a pop-rock band, but they have guitars, bass and drums. (And if you're the type of rock fan who's neutral or hostile to the 5, you shouldn't be; Songs About Jane slaps.)\n\nAt any rate, Watt co-produced \"Can't Leave You Alone,\" featuring Juice WRLD, from 2021's Jordi. Critics disparaged the album, but showed Watt's facility straddling the pop and rock worlds.\n\n5 Seconds of Summer\n\nWhen it comes to Andrew Watt, the Sydney pop-rockers — slightly more on the rock end than Maroon 5 and their ilk — are repeat customers. He produced a number of tracks for 5 Seconds of Summer, which spanned 2018's Youngblood, 2020's Calm and 2022's 5SOS5.\n\nRegarding the former: Watt has cited Youngblood as one of the defining recording experiences of his life.\n\n\"I had started working with 5 Seconds of Summer, and a lot of people looked at them as a boy band, but they're not,\" Watt told Guitar Player. \"They're all incredible musicians. They can all play every instrument. They love rock music. They can harmonize like skyrockets in flight. They just were making the wrong kind of music.\"\n\nSo Watt showed 5 Seconds of Summer a number of mainstays of the rock era, like Tears for Fears and the Police. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nElton John\n\nA year after Britney Spears was unshackled from her highly controversial conservatorship, it was time for a victory lap with the God of Glitter. What resulted was a curious little bauble, which became a megahit: \"Hold Me Closer,\" a spin on \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"The One\" and \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\" that briefly launched Spears back into the stratosphere.\n\n\"Britney came in and she knew what she wanted to do,\" Watt recalled to The L.A. Times. \"We sped up the song a little bit and she sang the verses in her falsetto, which harkens back to 'Toxic.' She was having a blast.\"\n\nBlink-182\n\nWatt has also worked with pop/punk heroes Blink-182 — but not after Tom DeLonge made his grand return. He produced \"I Really Wish I Hated You\" from 2019's Nine, back when Matt Skiba was in the band.\n\nWhere in the rock world will this tender-aged superproducer strike next? Watt knows.\n\nSongbook: The Rolling Stones' Seven-Decade Journey To Hackney Diamonds\n\nMotown legend Martha Reeves had quite a day.\n\nOn March 27, the 82-year-old singer finally got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Flanked by Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Berry Gordy, Reeves donned a pearl and gold strapless gown with a show-stopping hat for the celebration. That evening, Reeves was the star of a conversation at the GRAMMY Museum in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nReeves was definitely riding high that night. \"I’m gonna try to calm down. I’ve been excited all day,\" Reeves told moderator Gail Mitchell, longtime Billboard Executive Director of R&B and Hip-Hop.\n\nBorn in Alabama but raised in the Motor City, Martha Reeves was the lead singer of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. The Motown girl group is responsible for 1960s and 1970s classics such as \"Dancing in the Street,\" \"My Baby Loves Me,\" \"Jimmy Mack,\" \"Nowhere to Run,\" \"(Love is Like a ) Heatwave,\" and \"Bless You.\" Following her time at Motown, Reeves went on to have a solo career and was even an elected councilwoman in Detroit. The GRAMMY-nominated artist was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nThroughout the evening, the Motown diva — now in a lavish purple and silver top — had the audience at the Museum's Clive Davis Theater singing along to her classics, laughing as she strolled down Motown memory lane, and even tearing up as she got personal. She even teased that she might have a new album in store.\n\nRead on for five things we learned from Martha Reeves' free-flowing, laugh-filled conversation at the GRAMMY Museum.\n\nShe Had To Fight To Get Her Hollywood Star\n\nReeves crossed paths with many legendary names over the course of her career. But one of the first people she shouted out wasn’t a star, but her manager Chris Roe. \"He’s brought me a long way in just a couple of years.\" Reeves said of the industry veteran. During the Q&A segment of her conversation, Reeves even brought Roe on stage.\n\nHer gratitude makes sense for a number of reasons. Reeves was first nominated for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2021 but the process stagnated, Roe said, because of representation that wasn’t truly in Motown singer’s corner. Reeves' management at the time, Roe noted, was treating the soul icon like a shiny trophy rather than an active musician.\n\nThe two first met when Roe was in Detroit on business; a year later Roe went all in to raise money and make her Walk of Fame star dream a reality. Onstage at the Museum, Reeves recalled walking down Hollywood Boulevard with her son in the 1970s (Reeves moved to L.A. for a time when Motown relocated to Southern California), reading the names of the stars. Her young son said Reeves should have her own marker, and his poignant memory was finally brought to fruition.\n\nMartha Reeves Credits Berry Gordy And Motown For Having \"A Vision\"\n\n\"How did Berry Gordy manage to get all of those people in one place? It was like corralling in a Western,\" Reeves said of Motown's incredible roster of talent in the '60s.\n\nShe added that, never in her wildest dreams, did she think she would soar so high alongside musical geniuses like Smokey Robinson and songwriting/production team Holland-Dozier-Holland (who arranged songs for the likes of the Four Tops and the Supremes during a piping-hot run during the mid-1960s).\n\nOccasionally, instead of answering questions, Reeves would burst into song. \"I can’t describe it,\" Reeves said at one point while describing Motown's musical resonance. \"But I can make you feel it.\"\n\nReeves noted that it was tough to think of one particular moment that wasn’t exciting or that paved the way for future success. She calls everything an \"adventure or a challenge.\"\n\nShe did say that her first tour was grueling, consisting of 94 one-nighters and only one motel chain who would allow Black guests.\n\nShe Learned A Lot While On Tour With Motown\n\nReeves went from playfully talking about how \"fine\" Marvin Gaye was and being around different kinds of artists on cross-country Motortown Revue bus trips, to more serious topics like the integration of Black music during the turbulent 1960s.\n\nShe recalled a particularly harrowing moment when the Revue arrived in Montgomery, Alabama in 1963 when the Vandellas, the Marvelettes, the Miracles, the Temptations, and others were performing for a segregated audience in a horse-training arena with American and Confederate flags. While Smokey Robinson and the Miracles performed \"Mickey’s Monkey,\" men with baseball bats separated the audience — Black on one side, white on the other.\n\nBut Robinson stepped to the microphone and challenged convention. He just wanted to make sure that everyone just had a good time and could dance. \"We’ve come a long way. Music is the reason,\" Reeves told the audience.\n\nShe Remembers Her Solo Work Fondly, Too\n\nAfter Reeves and the Vandellas disbanded and Reeves left Motown, she released her eponymous debut solo album in 1974 on MCA Records. Producer Richard Perry came in to work on the album with her, resulting in many hits.\n\nReeves spoke a lot about one track, \"Many Rivers to Cross,\" which involved 110 takes and a 40-piece choir. \"He was that diligent in getting the sound he wanted. [A] very profound producer,\" Reeves said of Perry. Reeves said she's very proud of \"Dixie Highway,\" an ode to Reeves’s Alabama root.\n\nReeves said that her mother and father — who had 11 children — taught her \"everything\" and that she was a very loved child. In fact, her parents fostered her musical talents from an early age, her mother helping with her singing and her father putting her on his lap as he played guitar.\n\nReeves Gave Her Hometown Love, And They Gave It Back\n\nReeves served as an elected councilwoman in Detroit from 2005 to 2009. \"You have to be careful what you ask for,\" Reeves said with a laugh about her time in politics. She calls the whole experience \"an education.\"\n\nBecause of Reeves’s efforts in local politics, Detroit is home to Berry Gordy Jr. Boulevard, the street on which, fittingly, the Motown Museum is located.\n\nSome of her fans and friends from Detroit made it all the way to the GRAMMY Museum for the event, donning Martha Reeves shirts and carrying Vandellas records. Several times, Reeves shouted out a friend who is a dance teacher. \"I love you so for being here.\"\n\nSome of the most moving moments of Martha Reeves' conversation came during the audience Q&A session. One member of the audience recalled meeting Reeves in New York shortly after his mother — a longtime fan of Reeves' — passed away; he shared the comfort his conversation with the singer brought him while grieving. Another attendee said he was a Detroit radio DJ and once received a ride home with Reeves; and yet another member of the audience spoke passionately about seeing the Motown Revue as a young man, and how the event was one of his first experiences in a desegregated scenario.\n\nLiving Legends: Smokey Robinson On New Album 'Gasms,' Meeting The Beatles & Staying Competitive"
