        "text": "i've seen them live before, as well as homme's side project them crooked vultures and eagles of death metal. you could say i like them haha. they were the gateway band for me into the world of the desert & stoner rock genres, which sprawls with so much massive talent that have worked & played together, so if you dig them i recommend checking out homme's desert sessions to branch out to and from!\n\nas the band has gotten older, it feels like homme has taken less risks and villains was their weakest, but the rest of their discography always has a time and place for me. some days i want smarmy, wordplay-heavy qotsa, other days i want to hear those heartfelt croons. autumn in particular is lullabies to paralyze season, was just listening to it earlier.\n\nthat said, there's also a lot of unfortunate weight they carry - oliveri being a wifebeater (who has long since been dismissed) and homme's use of homophobic slurs during live shows that he's gotten better about but never really apologized for. a \"problematic fav\" for sure...\n\nI first got deep into QOTSA and Kyuss in high school, when my stoner friends introduced me to stoner rock (and pretty much just rock in general, that's when I got into Pink Floyd, Zeppelin, Sabbath, etc.) long before I ever smoked weed. I fell in love with all of QOTSA's albums - if you've just listened to Songs for the Deaf, go back to Rated R and the self-titled record as there are incredible tracks on them, Better Living Through Chemistry is still incredible and I will still randomly start humming Regular John out of nowhere. Lullabies was a bit of a step down after Songs, and I love Era Vulgaris but it can be a divisive album. I saw Them Crooked Vultures before the album came out in Philly and it was an amazing show, experiencing the entire album for the first time in the live show.\n\nBut I think Josh Home's seminal work, the one I will always think of, is Like Clockwork, and that is both because it is an utterly incredible album and its themes hit me at the precise moment I needed them in my life. In 2013 I was deeply depressed, stuck in a dead-end job, hopeless in romance, and just numb to the world around me, going through the motions of life while barely keeping it together. Then Like Clockwork came out and I realize that I'm not the only one going through deep depression - Josh Homme, the rock god that I had listened to for years, felt the same sort of hopelessness and depression I was going through (he's said in many interviews that he was in a dark place while writing the album, due to health issues, relationship issues, and depression). It didn't magically make it better, but it was the wake up call I needed to get help and get myself through it. Honestly, going back to the record again now, I'm feeling the same emotions I was feeling then, just now tinted through the world of 2020. Just a sublime album about deep depression, coping, and surviving.\n\nWas not a big fan of their last two albums but we'll see if this next one is great.\n\nThe sound of this isn't anything like the last 2- the chorus almost reminds me of \"I'm Designer\", being that its sing-songy and falsetto.\n\nI liked them back in 2002 but sadly all I think about is how awful Homme was to Brody and had sad her life has been having to deal with pedo-creep Armstrong and then have that happen to her later in life. If he really abused both her and their children then QotSA is effectively nonexistent to me\n\nI'm not going to tell you Josh hasn't had problematic moments, but recent court docs do not make Brody out to be the victim whatsoever. She and her new boyfriend forged protection order requests and potentially lied about accusations. She's not the martyr she wants to be seen as.\n\nBut this is about the music, since ongoing litigation is hearsay and up for debate."
