        "text": "Hard rock is not what springs to mind when you think of oppressed groups, but throughout its history, despite its popularity, it has received a great deal of dismissive criticism, and today there is not much of a hard-rock scene left. Queens of the Stone Age’s near-perfect new album, “. . . Like Clockwork,” an excellent example of the form, débuted at No. 1 in early June, but it arrives accompanied by no wave of critical attention or trend pieces. The band is on the indie label Matador, after almost ten years on Interscope. Maybe they need no cohort now.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age are led by a six-foot-four autodidact named Josh Homme (rhymes with “mommy”), who was raised in the California desert. He recently turned forty, and has been in professional rock bands since he was fourteen. Homme’s first well-known band, Kyuss (named after a character from Dungeons & Dragons), played slower, menacing music, which was often called stoner rock. It was a defiantly odd sound, and though Kyuss was on a major label in the mid-nineties, it never achieved mainstream popularity. The band would have more friends today. Acts like Sleep and Sunn O))) have made long stretches of low, sustained, amplified guitar more common, and achieved critical respect. It’s an interesting irony: vibrant and accessible rock, such as Homme plays today, is now stranger than hour-long drones.\n\nIn the early and mid-seventies, the heyday of hard rock, only a curmudgeon would have denied himself the pleasure of Cheap Trick and Aerosmith, bands that acted like dumb hedonists but were clever and meticulous when making records, a balance that Homme has emulated. Hooks were laid end to end; guitars were played at high volume without becoming overbearingly fuzzy or indistinct; and there was a sense of humor about the entire affair. Then, in the late seventies, the advent of punk and its offshoots complicated everything. In a rejection of meticulous professionalism, amateurism was in, which was not helpful for bands that prided themselves on accurate playing, singing in tune, and making records sound huge with studio tricks, a technique that Queens of the Stone Age have mastered. The longhairs and the decadents were out—this was a party purge, in every sense. Big guitars and hooks snuck into the eighties only as guilty pleasures, before Guns N’ Roses brought back some of hard rock’s legitimacy. (Heavy metal, a separate category, is the water bug of the story; catchy hits were never oxygen to this life-form.)\n\nNirvana at once perfected and ruined everything. In 1991, the band released “Nevermind,” one of the four or five perfect hard-rock records. It was explicitly indebted to my favorite Aerosmith album, “Rocks,” and it quickly became a mainstream hit. Because Nirvana’s members, besides being newly minted rock stars, were also politically aware punks and weirdos, they found it profoundly alienating that they had just made the jocks’ favorite new album. This meeting of matter and antimatter contributed to Kurt Cobain’s suicide, in 1994, and helped ruin a big moment for hard rock.\n\nAfter Cobain’s suicide, indie rockers embraced anything but big guitars and hooks, which were left to bands that are still the butt of jokes: Creed, Nickelback, Daughtry. By the early two-thousands, it became easy for indie rockers to score attention with blandly loud, distorted rock that might cause seizures. But catchy, melodic hard rock had become passé.\n\nHomme ignored all this history, from Queens of the Stone Age’s first, self-titled album, in 1998, through the new one. His favored mode of songwriting is to begin with unpretentious, clipped guitar phrases, vigorous but not blustery, and drive forward with an exceptionally good drummer behind him. (Nirvana’s Dave Grohl played on “Songs for the Deaf,” from 2002, and is included on “. . . Like Clockwork.”) Homme’s singing tends toward a no-nonsense, unusually calm, low mid-range, a typical genre modification for the band: take all the power of hard rock but extract any hint of macho hysteria. Just play the song.\n\nHomme has spent part of the past few years recovering from complications that arose during knee surgery following a motorcycle accident, and the press has described “. . . Like Clockwork” as a new direction for a resuscitated front man. In fact, the album follows neatly the band’s last one, “Era Vulgaris,” from 2007. But it’s their best work, because they’re a band that relies on fine-tuning a basic formula, and they’ve added bits that improve performance. Variance is not in their interest, and they won’t show up one day playing all acoustic or channelling the American songbook.\n\nThe opening track, “Keep Your Eyes Peeled,” shows how well this album balances its unexpected modifications, adding chords that seem to be missing one key note or dropping the band out for a small burst of drumming. The song is built on a low, basic guitar ostinato, a sort of knuckle-dragging figure. Homme finishes every other measure with a corkscrew flourish that makes it hard to gauge the emotional register of the song. The lyrics move through various images of losing control. Early on, Homme sings, “Shotgun, never behind the wheel anymore,” the words coming out one by one, in a voice that is sweeter than you expect, stripped of aggression; a keyboard matches each note, subtly propping it up, as if Homme were struggling slightly. Two heavier moments of full-on blasting follow, both quickly folded into vocals or a guitar part stranded in back, humming while the band bashes. One of the album’s most gorgeous moments comes midway through the song. Homme moves into a falsetto and reduces the band to drums and a guitar figure, with a piano punctuating certain phrases. He may actually be in Hell now, gazing up at the sky and daydreaming “until all the blue is gone.” In one five-minute track, the band gives you a précis of almost everything the album contains.\n\nOn a Friday in early June, Queens of the Stone Age played an unannounced show at the Brooklyn Masonic Temple, in Fort Greene. Though there was a hard and constant rain, fans waited happily to get in. The building is an imposing stone mystery on the outside, but inside there is a traditional performance space, with a proscenium stage facing a large dance floor, surrounded by a seated mezzanine.\n\nHomme and four bandmates took the stage, accompanied by nothing more than some bright lights and a vague, colored projection. He wore a stern military-gray dress shirt; his drummer, Jon Theodore, eventually took off his shirt. His other three bandmates have a slightly darker look, as if they might be in a different, mopier band on their days off. Homme moved back and forth between a Gretsch electric guitar and an electric piano, playing “. . . Like Clockwork” in its entirety and then playing a brief handful of what qualify as hits for popular bands that don’t actually have Top Ten hits. The sound was pleasantly harsh and rattling, and several notches higher than comfortable, which was exactly right. The controlled power and variety of the set suggested that the Stone Age that Homme is interested in is rock itself, in all its iterations. It seems irrelevant whether popular and critical appreciation follows. The next album will simply continue the work. ♦"
