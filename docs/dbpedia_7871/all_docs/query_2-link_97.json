        "text": "Metal can seem a bit… intimidating for some people. And it’s true that a some of it is hard to get into, both musically and culturally. So here I want to present some of the best ‘gateway drugs’ I’ve found over the years; metal albums with strong ties to other genres, making them relatively easy to get into for the uninitiated. Below the list, I get into more detail about what exactly I consider good gateway music, but for now, let’s get straight to it:\n\nPlini — Handmade Cities\n\nDifficulty level: easy peasy\n\nFor fans of: jazz, fusion, happy music\n\nWhat’s it about? Imagine: a hundred sweaty metalheads dancing like ballerinas to slow melodic music. Plini made it happen. Their music, for lack of a better word, is just so damn comfy. Sure, they have their ‘breakdowns’, but even these are warm and friendly. They still play with a metal vocabulary though, which makes them a perfect first taste of what metal can sound like.\n\nGateway to: progressive metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Sithu Aye and Chon both have a similarly chill vibe. Mestís is a bit more intricate and jazz-oriented, while Cloudkicker is a bit more straightforward and even hypnotic.\n\nGhost — Meliora\n\nDifficulty level: easy squeazy\n\nFor fans of: glam rock, classic rock, old horror movies\n\nWhat’s it about? Some metal bands are like a cult, complete with iconography, make-up and on-stage rituals. Ghost looks like one of these bands, until you realize they’re actually a parody of all of the above. Their sound is inspired by heavy metal but they dial up the cheese factor to eleven, and I can’t help but think that they would be a perfect soundtrack for some 80’s horror B-movie. The combination of ominous guitar chugging and elegant vocal lines is actually pretty funny, which makes Ghost an easy metal band to get into.\n\nGateway to: heavy metal, doom metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Go for some of the metal classics: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Black Sabbath. You can also check out some modern doom like Type O Negative or (if you feel ready) Ufomammut.\n\nDevin Townsend Project — Epicloud\n\nDifficulty level: super gay (pretty easy)\n\nFor fans of: pop, symphonic anything, romantic classical music\n\nWhat’s it about? Devin Townsend started out in an extreme metal band, before dropping his aggressive tone (and his hair) to make music he himself has lovingly described as “super gay”. Epicloud (as in: epic+loud) is hyper-melodic for a metal album, as well as contagiously energetic and shamelessly catchy. It has the pounding drums and shredding guitar of your average metal band, but the songs themselves sound more like pop tunes than anything else.\n\nGateway to: progressive metal, symphonic metal, attraction to bald men\n\nWhere to go from here? If you want to keep it melodic, there’s a ton of modern prog bands like Haken, Frost*, and Liquid Tension Experiment for you to explore. If you dig Devin’s style, check out his other albums or (if you feel ready) his previous band Strapping Young Lad.\n\nBaroness — Purple\n\nDifficulty level: pretty easy\n\nFor fans of: stoner anything, Queens of the Stone Age or any other Josh Homme project\n\nWhat’s it about? Baroness is a band that’s a bit harder to describe because it’s so rooted in its stoner/sludge metal vocabulary, but I’m convinced that their melodicity (not a word, I know) and upbeat attitude make them a good gateway drug into the sludgier side of metal. Their signature double guitar leads give colour to almost all of the songs on Purple, and the singing is similarly melodic. It’s also a very varied album, alternating between slow and fast, heavy and light, while always keeping up a distinct feeling that I can only describe as ‘happy melancholy’.\n\nGateway to: sludge metal, stoner metal, post-metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Baroness’ Red and Blue albums are a bit more heavy. Definitely check out Mastodon as well, especially Crack the Skye for something more melodic. Then, you can stay poppy with the punk-infused sound of Torche, or (if you feel ready) go heavy with High on fire.\n\nLantlôs — Melting Sun\n\nDifficulty level: easy/medium\n\nFor fans of: shoegaze, post-rock, dreamy anything\n\nWhat’s it about? There’s a lot of moments on Melting Sun that sound like you’re listening to a bombastic post-rock band. But then there’s some kind of breakdown and it’s all… heavier, fuller, more energetic somehow. This is a great album to get into post-black metal, because it barely sounds like black metal, or even metal at all. The album title and the cover art actually give a better idea of what it sounds like than I ever could, so I’m going to shut up now. That is, if you promise to give this a listen!\n\nGateway to: post-black metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Check out Lantlôs’ earlier, heavier albums, or give Deafheaven’s Sunbather a listen (also down on this list). Alcest weaves dreamy chords and a soft mellow voice with shards of darker black metal bits, stepping up Lantlôs’ game but keeping some of its members.\n\nSkindred — Babylon\n\nDifficulty level: medium\n\nFor fans of: ragga, ska, early-2000’s alt rock\n\nWhat’s it about? There’s really only two ways you’ll like this album. Either you’re into ragga, ska or hip hop and you’re curious to see it combined with other genres, or you’ve listened to Limp Bizkit as a teenager. This is the kind of band that literally won’t play live unless every person in the audience is bouncin’, so I don’t know what’s not to like here. And there’s really not that much to say about this record, except that the combination of ragga and metal sounds so much better than you’d think.\n\nGateway to: nu metal, alternative metal, groove metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Sepultura is a great next step. Twelve Foot Ninja also has its own lovely mix of styles going on. System of a Down and Disturbed are similarly groovy, but lack the ragga influence.\n\nThe Algorithm — OCTOPUS4\n\nDifficulty level: medium\n\nFor fans of: electronic, dubstep, techno, hardstyle (is that still a thing?)\n\nWhat’s it about? The Algorithm is more of a DJ project than an actual band, which is refreshing between the groups of mostly sweaty mostly hairy mostly men that metal is occupied by. (That’s not to say that project leader Rémi Gallego isn’t any of these things, but at least it’s not a group.) Anyways, his music is a surprising mix between heavy electronics and metal, and this album sways more to the electronic side. It’s fun, it’s groovy, and there’s no angry vocals!\n\nGateway to: djent, progressive metal, mathcore\n\nWhere to go from here? Listen to his other albums, which are generally a bit heavier. Then put on Master Boot Record for some metal-infused 80’s nostalgia.\n\nDestiny Potato — Lun\n\nDifficulty level: medium\n\nFor fans of: pop, female vocals, dubstep\n\nWhat’s it about? This Serbian band is another tough one to write about. On the one hand it’s undeniable that their sound is heavy, and perhaps too heavy for some. (As a metalhead, it’s easy to forget just how inaccessible some of the music is that you listen to.) But on the other hand, Destiny Potato is incredibly poppy, to the point that many a metalhead would be ashamed of admitting to liking them. This is undoubtedly partly due to Aleksandra Đelmaš’s bright and at times super sassy vocals, but the songs are fantastic in their own right. Cuts like Take a Picture and Love Song sound like they could’ve been straight pop bangers, and the drop in U.Y.M. should give anyone who’s into dubstep goosebumps.\n\nGateway to: djent, post-hardcore, mathcore\n\nWhere to go from here? Any other project by band leader David Maxim Micic is a safe bet, as are Good Tiger and Periphery. If you’re digging the down-tuned chaos, check out Gojira.\n\nZeal & Ardor — Stranger Fruit\n\nDifficulty level: ???\n\nFor fans of: blues, soul, spirituals\n\nWhat’s it about? This one is a bit of a wildcard. I‘m not sure how listenable this is to someone who’s not used to the sound of metal. But let me try to sell it to you anyways. Zeal & Ardor started out as a project that went for the unlikely genre combination of African-American spirituals with black metal. Or in the frontman’s own words: “what if American slaves had embraced Satan instead of Jesus?” On Stranger Fruit, the band has grown their sound to include elements of soul, blues, electronic music, as well as other styles of metal. It’s really a colourful combination of sounds that transcends simply being ‘metal’.\n\nGateway to: black metal, avant-garde metal\n\nWhere to go from here? I won’t pretend that this band is easily linked to others. That said, Diablo Swing orchestra have their own strange mix of metal and swing. Algiers mixes gospel with post-punk, and Oranssi Pazuzu combines black metal with spacey psych rock.\n\nDeafheaven — Sunbather\n\nDifficulty level: tough\n\nFor fans of: shoegaze, post-rock, dreamy anything\n\nWhat’s it about? Alright, Deafheaven is no soft nut to crack for someone who’s not used to the blistering sound of black metal (think: screamed vocals, lightning fast drums, walls of guitar). But this band combines it with truly dreamy harmonies and melodies, to the point where you start wondering whether you should be furious or ecstatic. Their music generally makes me feel ‘so happy I could punch a cloud’.\n\nGateway to: black metal, post-black metal\n\nWhere to go from here? If you like the atmospheric-ness of it, check out Lantlôs and Wolves in the Throne Room. For something a bit more out-there (if you feel ready), go for Liturgy.\n\nIgorrr — Spirituality and Distortion\n\nDifficulty level: boss mode\n\nFor fans of: breakcore, baroque music, experimental anything\n\nWhat’s it about: We’re getting into the deep end here. Igorrr is not for the fainthearted. They combine many different styles — among them classical music, Balkan music, experimental electronics and various kinds of metal — into one batshit insane melting pot of noise. Still, it’s a great way into metal if you’re already used to the schizophrenic sounds of experimental music.\n\nGateway to: experimental metal, death metal, black metal\n\nWhere to go from here? Obviously, not many bands sound like Igorrr. Whourkr is another project by the same guy, and stylistically similar. If you’re ready for more weird stuff, check out Spastic Ink and Peculate.\n\nWhat’s ‘metal for normal people’?\n\nI use a few different criteria for picking albums that are good gateways into the world of metal for the uninitiated. These are, roughly in order of importance:\n\nCrossovers with other genres\n\nMelodic and harmonic clarity\n\nLack of aggression\n\nLack of extreme tempos\n\nLack of harsh vocals\n\nHumour and self-deprecation\n\nI’ve also tried to make both the “for fans of…” and “gateway to…” genres as diverse as possible, so that anyone can find at least something they click with.\n\nBecause I decided that the best way to get into metal is to hear it creatively combined with other genres, there’s some entries on this list that violate the lower criteria. With different priorities, I could’ve made a different list with only non-offensive and non-aggressive metal bands. But I see music as one big adventure. And as someone who listens to a lot of weird music, I see it as my duty to show that genres can be friends in the same music instead of fighting each other. Metal is not strictly opposite to any other genre. It’s simply a sound, or an approach to music, one that can be kneaded and stretched and mixed with other ingredients.\n\nI hope that you found something interesting here. If you did, if you have a suggestion for the list, or if you got your eardrums blown out and want to make a formal complaint, feel free to reach out!"
