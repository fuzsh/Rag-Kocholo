        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age (commonly abbreviated as QOTSA) is an American rock band formed in 1996 in Seattle, Washington. The band was founded by vocalist and guitarist Josh Homme, who has been the only constant member throughout multiple lineup changes. The band’s music style is predominantly hard rock, although they’re also billed as alternative rock and stoner rock. Repetitive riffs are a feature in their songwriting, with a distinctive sound that draws heavily from electronic dance music."
