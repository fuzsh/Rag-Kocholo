The band last performed on Saturday night in Milan, Italy, after canceling their appearance at the AMA Music Festival the previous night due to unspecified illness.\n\nOn July 2, Homme revealed that QOTSA would become the first band to perform inside the Catacombs of Paris, and that the performance would take place in \"a week's time or so.\" A specific date was not listed, and there has been no report that the show took place."
