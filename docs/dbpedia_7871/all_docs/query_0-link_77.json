        "text": "Spotify has been doing a lot of research lately, and in turn we've been learning a lot about metalhead listening habits. We've learned that metalheads are the most loyal to their genre compared to others and that Spotify is responsible for 10% of all record sales. Today, the streaming service revealed a report which lists the top 25 most listened to sub-genres in all of heavy metal. Here they are with a few bands to describe what the genre classification actually means. If you click the genre, you can access the official Spotify playlist for it.\n\nAlternative Metal – Basically late 90s, early 00 radio rock like Korn, Disturbed and Papa Roach\n\nNu Metal – Korn is listed here again, obviously, other acts include Drowning Pool, Mudvayne, Sevendust\n\nHard Rock – This seems to mean classic rock like Van Halen, Whitesnake and Ted Nugent.\n\nGroove Metal Modern mainstream metal like Machine Head, Trivium and Devildriver\n\nRap Metal – Not sure how this differs from nu metal, but featured acts include Linkin Park, POD, Limp Bizkit\n\nFunk Metal – Faith No More, Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers amongst the listed acts.\n\nMetal – aka VH1 classic metal, like Iron Maiden, King Diamond and Motorhead\n\nMetalcore – Warped Tour metal like Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine and All That Remains.\n\nSpeed Metal – Similar to just Metal, features Megadeth, Accept, Slayer\n\nMelodic Metalcore – Basically, the new wave of American heavy metal like Killswitch Engage, Darkest Hour, Unearth\n\nIndustrial Metal – Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Orgy, Powerman 5000, Static X\n\nProgressive Metal – Queensryche, Dream Theater, Symphony X\n\nPower Metal – Sabaton, Firewind, Edguy\n\nDeath Metal – Death, Obituary, Deicide, Dying Fetus\n\nThrash Metal – Slayer, Testament, Anthrax, Exodus, Kreator\n\nGlam Metal – Motley Crue, Quiet Riot, Def Leppard, Dokken\n\nMelodic Death Metal – basically Swedish metal, In Flames, Soilwork, Dark Tranquility, etc.\n\nNeo Classical Metal – Kamelot, Stratovarius, Dragonforce\n\nSymphonic Metal – Epica, Within Temptation, Nightwish\n\nDeath Core – Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Chelsea Grin, Carnifex\n\nGothic Metal – Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation\n\nGerman Metal – Edguy, Rage, Helloween\n\nGothic Symphonic Metal – Epica, Delain, Leaves' Eyes\n\nStoner Rock – Orange Goblin, Fu Manchu, High on Fire\n\nFolk Metal – Eluveitie, Tursias, Finntroll, Moonsorrow\n\nAs you can see, there are a few repeat genres here, like nu-metal & rap metal and neo classical metal, symphonic metal, gothic metal and gothic symphonic metal all having a lot of crossover.\n\nBut it certainly does paint an interesting picture. Unsurprisingly, the most popular music is the most mainstream friendly, which has radio rock play and then the more obscure genres are the ones that require a bit more of the listener's ear to grasp.\n\nHow do you feel about the list?"
