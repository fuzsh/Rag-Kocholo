        "text": "After years of heavy touring and drug abuse severely weakened his immune system, he contracted an MRSA infection during surgery. In an attempt to restart his immune system, surgeons used a breathing tube which became stuck in his throat, choking him and leading to cardiac arrest.\n\nSpeaking to music magazine NME he said: “It gave me great perspective, and it’s amazing to be alive.”\n\nHomme added “I was stuck in a room for four months and I had all these tubes in my leg,” he said. “And it was painful. And after two months in bed you go, ‘I’ve got two months left. How do I do this?’ It did the greatest thing it could ever do to me: It zeroed me . . . And I’m really thankful for it because I know what’s important.”\n\nHe explained how he coped with contracting MRSA, a staph infection that can resist antibiotics, and being declared legally dead after choking on oxygen tubes during surgery. The incident delayed the making of Queens’ latest album, this year’s . . . Like Clockwork, which was the band’s first since 2007.\n\nHomme said it took him a couple of years to recover fully from the experience as he dealt with a number of what he called “rickety” emotions."
