A decade torn asunder by a split in aesthetics (Reagan/Thatcher and their gray/brown offices and suits under harsh, buzzing lights, on the one, and punk/post-punk expanses cut up with claustophobic, suicidal interiors on the other - the divide most expertly illustrated in After Hours) often had the most luxurious sinking into the best parts of each.
