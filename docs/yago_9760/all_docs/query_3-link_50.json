        "text": "This production is 2 hours, 15 minutes\n\nIt is performed with one intermission\n\nBy Alice Childress\n\nDirected by Melissa Maxwell\n\nOn Broadway in 1957, an integrated theatre company begins rehearsals on a topical drama dealing with controversial current events, which they hope will be Broadwayâ€™s next big hit. When prejudices and stereotypes emerge in the company, talented African-American actress Wiletta Mayer faces a difficult choice: the opportunity to achieve her lifelong dream of playing a leading role on Broadway or compromising her principles. Trouble in Mind, a backstage satire of egos and attitudes, is an insightful look at who we are and who we want to be.\n\nAfterWords: A post-performance discussion with the audience. Thursday, March 5 following the performance of Trouble in Mind. Director Melissa Maxwell will join Professor Koritha Mitchell (Department of English) in a discussion about Childress's play. Mitchell, a specialist in African American literature, is the author of the award winning Living with Lynching: African American Lynching Plays, Performance, and Citizenship, 1890 - 1930 (University of Illinois Press, 2011). Shelby Brewster, dramaturg, will moderate the discussion that will include the cast and production team.\n\nTickets go on sale Monday, January 12, 2015 at 10am."
