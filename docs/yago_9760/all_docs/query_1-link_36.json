        "text": "Since he made ''Welcome to L.A.'' in 1974, Alan Rudolph has been demonstrating that a modest amount of talent and money, and a lot of nerve, can buy a certain degree of credibility and visual style.\n\n''Remember My Name'' and ''Choose Me,'' among the other Rudolph works, are so pretty, so fey, so sincere and sometimes so simple-minded that they disarm criticism by appearing to take themselves far less seriously than audiences do. It's difficult to swat a comedy - even one that's not funny - that announces in every frame, ''I'm just a sweet, small, inconsequential, loving movie about Life.''\n\nThere are even some people who would praise him as a film maker of original and possibly profound sensibility.\n\nTo preserve this illusion, Mr. Rudolph should never have made ''The Moderns,'' a project he nurtured for 12 years and describes, apparently with pride, as ''the most rejected screenplay in Hollywood.'' The new film, used as a key to all that has gone before, unlocks the door to a room with nothing in it.\n\n''The Moderns,'' opening today at the Plaza, is another Rudolph fable, this time set in Paris in the late 1920's, about artists, writers, art-forgers, collectors and, as set-dressing, characters labeled Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas and, in what might be called an off-screen cameo, Maurice Ravel.\n\nIn the foreground are fictitious characters named Hart (Keith Carradine), a struggling painter who dabbles in unauthorized reproductions; Stone (John Lone), a nouveau riche collector who, we are told, made his vast fortune manufacturing condoms, and Oiseau (Wallace Shawn), a gossip columnist who dreams of flying off to become a columnist in Hollywood, which, in this film's view of the world, is the Paris of the future.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
