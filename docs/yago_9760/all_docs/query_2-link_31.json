        "text": "RAINCITY is a misty town, outdoors and in, but not nearly as misty as ''Trouble in Mind,'' which is set there, wherever there is. Alan Rudolph's latest movie, which opens at Cinema 1 today, seems to be striving to say something but isn't able to break through the fog of his script.\n\nWe meet Hawk (Kris Kristofferson), a former cop, as he leaves prison. You can tell at once that Hawk is a good guy, and we learn later that, sure enough, his crime was to have killed a real bad guy. He goes to an ex-girlfriend named Wanda (Genevieve Bujold), who runs a cafe where improbable types hang out and improbable things happen. Hawk offers Wanda hard-boiled wisdom: ''You gotta be nice to your friends, Wanda. Without 'em, you're a total stranger.''\n\nWanda gives Hawk an apartment that, handily, has an excellent view of a trailer, into which Georgia (Lori Singer) moves with her adorable baby (Caitlin Ferguson) and her unstable companion, Coop (Keith Carradine). Hawk falls for Georgia. As he says, with his usual air of wisdom, ''If a man looked at a woman's mouth before her eyes, he'd get fooled a lot less.''\n\nMr. Kristofferson, strong and silent except when he's uttering wisdom (''A little bit of everybody belongs in hell, Lieutenant''), looks definitely hawklike. Miss Singer plays something of a ninny but is wide-eyed enough to win all hearts. Genevieve Bujold, as beautiful as ever, sports a big-city American accent, salted slightly with the Gallic, quite odd. As for Mr. Carradine, as he gets ever more deeply involved with the town's bad guys, he takes to wearing cosmetics, earrings and a spit curl. His head seems to narrow, and he winds up looking like a punk Dorian Gray.\n\nBut what is this movie about? Well, it has something to do with ineffectual bad guys who kill and maim, but mainly it's about its own mood - the mystical mist; the militia on patrol everywhere, occasionally busting up protest rallies though it is difficult to tell what is being protested; the trains flashing by; the buildings seen by the camera as abstract designs. There's something of the Orient in the air; characters burst out with commands in what sounds like Japanese - and don't overlook that Buddha and that gong.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
