        "meta_description": "In 1950s America, protests for racial equality erupt in the face of voter suppression. On Broadway, Wiletta Mayer, a talented black actress, begins rehearsals for a new play about racism – written and directed by two white men. When Wiletta finds that her arguments to tell the truth of the story are dismissed, she decides to take action. First staged over 60 years ago, Trouble in Mind is widely considered the masterpiece of actress and playwright Alice Childress - a wry and radical satire of racism in theatre.",

        "text": "First log for this play on here hehe. I found Trouble in Mind as decent, it had really good performances, direction and the set/setting being in one location was neat. Also a play about actors preparing for a play in the play was was so cool & meta, kinda didn’t dig the writing though.\n\nOh how beautifully and powerfully written this play is. The dialogue feels so pungent. It just sticks with you. It masterfully sustained an icky feeling of raw but also sometimes concealed pain and suffering… At points it almost felt marginally intrusive to watch. The pacing was pretty good (maybe at times a little too slow or fast). I mean to be honest, everything else was fine. Everything else except the acting. Okay now don’t get me wrong some of it was great but I just felt that for such a profound, thought provoking script that the actors should have been casted or directed better. Some of it just felt slightly fake, forced and repetitive in terms of characterisation. My advice would be not to watch this but to read the screenplay because the acting doesn’t do the play justice."
