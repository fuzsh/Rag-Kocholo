        "text": "For the first of the writer/director’s explorations of intertwined intimacies and missed connections, Rudolph wends a terrific cast through Southern California as Keith Carradine cuts a wide swath with conquests including BAFTA Award-nominated Geraldine Chaplin. On the soundtrack, Carradine performs several songs—including the title number and the apropos “City of the One Night Stands”—by costar Richard Baskin, who performs his own songs as well."
