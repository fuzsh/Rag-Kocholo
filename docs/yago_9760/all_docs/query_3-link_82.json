        "text": "This is the part of John Cappetta’s life he likes to call “chapter three” — the part where he’s pursuing storytelling focused on diverse and lesser represented voices. His Planet 9 Films production company in Solana Beach produces movies and stage plays borne of his desire to immerse himself in a creative process that also makes a social impact.\n\n“I think the switch to film was to explore a couple of things. I love film, I love stories and literature. I think film is a pretty uniquely powerful medium to provide an opportunity for somebody to get out of their own world and into somebody else’s world and into their perspective of the world,” he says. “That experience can be very impactful. One, it’s an opportunity to have an impact, another way to build empathy and understanding, and build bridges. A second thing is the opportunity to be involved in the creative process and making a work of art that I wanted to explore.”\n\nCurrently, Cappetta is executive producer of “Límite,” a short film by writer and director George Nicholas, inspired by the news account of a 16-year-old boy from Tijuana trying to enter the U.S. in 2013 with two bottles of unidentified liquid, prompting U.S. Border Patrol agents suspicions about the contents of the bottle and directing the boy to prove that it was only apple juice by drinking it; the boy, Cruz Velazquez Acevedo, later died. Both Cappetta and Nicholas have said that they could see some of the 16-year-old versions of themselves in Acevedo and the film’s protagonist, Manuel; that relatable element is what they hope comes across in the film, which is being screened at 6 p.m. tonight during a special engagement of the Coronado Island Film Festival at the Village Theatre (followed by a VIP reception at Brigantine; tickets are $15 and $40 at coronadofilmfest.com).\n\nCappetta, 63, is founder and president of Planet 9 Films and lives in La Jolla with his wife, Nancy Jo, and they have four adult children. Before filmmaking, he earned degrees in economics and finance, leading to a career in investment banking and business at Citibank, Credit Suisse First Boston, and the American International Group. He’s also currently founder and CEO of Andesite Capital Management, a private investment company. He took some time to talk about the kinds of stories he’s excited to tell, and what makes “Límite” part of that group.\n\nQ: Tell us about “Límite” and how you became involved in this project.\n\nA: This is a fictional, narrative film inspired by an actual, historical event that took place at our border here, our Tijuana/San Diego border. The filmmaker, George Nicholas, was just personally very struck by this story, and it stayed with him. He tried to imagine what were the circumstances that led that boy to that place. A lot of it, I think, was very personal. I think he kind of felt for him, and the moment really resonated. When I was 16, I took a lot of risks, I did a lot of dumb things that I wasn’t thinking through very well and got myself into plenty of trouble. In this case, there’s something here with this boy who’s gotten into this position and died at the hands of the border agents, so that was the inspiration for the story. It follows a boy from Tijuana who turns 16 over the course of the film, his mother works in San Diego, so she has status to come and work for three months at a time, which is not an uncommon scenario. He lives with his grandfather in a loving, supportive home where his grandfather and his mother is making sacrifices for his benefit. He’s young and immature and he wants things: he wants a girlfriend, he wants new shoes, he wants to be admired, he wants to make the soccer team, he wants all these things. In this film, he’s led down a path that, ultimately, culminates in that moment at the border.\n\nIt’s very much a coming-of-age story and I think it’s very relatable. That is the feeling I had when I first read the script and saw a cut of the film. It sort of resonated as, ‘Yeah, I can really relate with this young man. I can relate and understand.’ My mind goes to my mistakes at that age, but they didn’t have the consequences, the stakes, that were faced here. This is a case where the filmmaker had pulled his own resources together, got people to contribute, rallied friends and got some of his own resources to shoot this, and it’s very independent-looking and very beautifully shot. He reached out to me at the stage where he’d already shot it and wanted to know what to do with it now. In this case, as is not uncommon with an executive producer, I’m kind of the business half of this particular film. What’s the length we’re going to look at, what are the different edits we have, how are we going to finish it, what’s the strategy as it relates to festivals and other things? So, I’ve been working on this project with him for about a year.\n\nWhat I love about La Jolla…\n\nOur neighborhood sidewalks are packed with dogs (and their tethered human companions), joggers, cyclists, surfers, beach goers, etc.—all of it teeming with positive energy! And, I love that I can do many of my personal errands on my bicycle.\n\nQ: Your film and theater production company, Planet 9 Films, is focused on “new and diverse voices, telling underrepresented stories.” Your projects have included “Marshall,” starring Chadwick Boseman as a young Thurgood Marshall, the first Black U.S. Supreme Court justice whose early career was as a lawyer for the NAACP; “Tyson’s Run,” about a boy with autism who becomes a marathon runner; “A Snowy Day in Oakland,” starring Nicole Ari Parker, Kimberly Elise, Loretta Devine, and others, taking a light-hearted look at how folks in a Black neighborhood respond to the opening of a private therapy practice in their community. Can you talk about why it’s important to you to provide a platform for these diverse and underrepresented stories?\n\nA: I think it goes back to my perception of, ‘Why is this that way?’ That’s what drew me in and onto this path. It’s not an investment strategy at all, I’m not interested in the industry of Hollywood; I’m just trying to find a story that I think really needs to be told and I work really hard to find a way to get it on the screen, to get it out there. I want to find a way to have an impact and I think the power of film allows us to do that. It makes a good vehicle for telling stories that may change some hearts and minds. Movies create an opportunity for me to find this unique way to try to have a tiny, little impact in the world and it’s drawing on my background, my passions. With this film, it’s allowing us to see a young person who’s kind of caught up in the Border Patrol system and to see him from a totally different light than how somebody might have thought about him from reading a news story the day before. They read the story and think a certain way, and then they see the film and read it entirely differently. It’s a way for me to put those kinds of movies out into the world, and not for the sake of ticket sales, but it has to be entertaining, it has to be beautiful, it has to be something that people want to come to, otherwise it’s not having any impact at all. So, there’s the ability to make those things happen while telling the stories that are really important to tell, that get into somebody’s mind or heart on important issues.\n\nQ: What is it about these kinds of stories that appeals to you, both as a creator and as a viewer?\n\nA: (Most) projects that I’ve been involved with wouldn’t get made if I didn’t throw myself at it. Maybe that sounds grandiose, but I think that’s just the nature of it. I’m drawn by the opportunity to help facilitate a very important story getting out in the world because I’m operating with a different set of objectives than 99 percent of the industry. I don’t mean to be cliché when I say these things become super algorithm driven and it’s all sequels and there’s not a lot of risk taking. There’s not a lot of newness and risk in terms of what might be commercially viable, so independent film is a very attractive and interesting way to create and have an impact.\n\nQ: When you’re looking toward that next project, what are some elements of the story that tend to be top of mind for you, in order to say yes to moving forward?\n\nA: I have learned to kind of come at it from the standpoint that I have to believe that the film is going to work and it’s going to be viable. It’s going to be something that people are excited to go see, as opposed to it just being important to me. It has to have really good story elements where the experience is going to be fully engaging and engrossing. Like I said, I believe that it can still be very beautiful on the screen, but what I’m looking for is a point of view and a perspective that is underserved and underrepresented, that doesn’t get most of the screentime out there and that will appeal to an audience and kind of change their perspective. “A Snowy Day in Oakland” is sort of about gentrification and a broader story about mental health in the African American community. It’s also about this little block in Oakland with all of these really good people trying to live out their own version of the American dream, or whatever. I think we hit all of those small things that challenge them and we see their perseverance and the power of community. It’s just kind of a fun and uplifting story, it’s got underrepresented characters, and they all get to struggle and shine. For an audience that will see that film, it’s more inspiring and uplifting, right?\n\nMy current project is a play we produced back in 2019, and my partner and I bought the movie rights to this play, called “Paradise.” It’s about a Muslim American girl in high school in the Bronx, from a very traditional family steeped in their faith. She falls in love with science and has a teacher who recognizes her ability and encourages her toward this scholarship to Columbia University that would be for young women of Middle Eastern descent, in STEM. It’s a coming-of-age story, and then we’re dealing with science and religion and the complexities of family and individuality. There are all of these things that, I think, allow an audience to see the beauty of her culture and her faith, her life, in a way that we don’t think about very often, don’t see very often, and start to empathize from that perspective. Those are the elements that draw me to do projects, but it has to have all of the pieces.\n\nQ: With “Límite,” what did you want to focus on and explore in this fictionalized retelling of Cruz’s story?\n\nA: I think what we’re exploring are two things. One, is the human story and how easy it is for a young person having a loving family and being a sweet, good person who kind of wants to live right, and how the stakes can just be so high in certain communities. It’s an awareness of that where an audience can really say, ‘I see myself in that person’ and look at what happened to them and gain an understanding of the stakes and what’s happening there. Bear with me, but someone might read about what happened and say that we have so many stories like this, with everything that’s happened over the last four years. This is a case, though, where you might look and say, ‘OK, a smuggler is bringing liquid meth into the U.S., gets caught by Border Patrol, and dies at their hands.’ A lot of people can read that story and maybe feel a little bit bad because they might say, ‘Well, there are consequences to being a criminal’ and you just sort of see that person as a criminal. In that particular case, they broke the law, they got caught, something happened, and he died. There are lots of ways to bring awareness to that—protesting, documentary film, advocacy. All of that is wonderful and important; but film is this other vehicle that says, ‘OK, well, I’m going to create a story that we’re all going to be engrossed in and we’re going to relate to, connect to. I’m going to show the story of this boy and his grandfather, at home. Then, there’s his best friend, and we’re going to create this environment where we’re going to come to understand that he’s not a criminal, he’s a victim of a criminal organization, of circumstances, of the treatment that he received at the border.’ When you look at the archival footage (of what happened), the story that we tell here is another way to look at this kind of story from that person’s perspective. It helps you say that this is a humanitarian issue and we have a responsibility to treat individuals for who they really are, as best as we possibly can—and we’re failing horribly at it. We’re failing people, and by providing a story that we can relate to, we can relive this guy’s life for 40 minutes and see that kind of an event from an entirely different perspective. That’s the purpose of the film, that’s what drew me to it, that’s why it’s powerful. I think it’s a terrific movie, it’s beautifully shot, and a very engaging experience.\n\nQ: What kind of impact has this project had on you?\n\nA: I think about him all the time. All the time. And, my engagement with the world is altered. The film prompted a really interesting discussion at the San Diego International Film Festival from an audience where we had academics who specialized in race or in border-related issues; we had military; we had someone who was the son of a Border Patrol agent. We had this really interesting group of people and the story prompted quite a bit of passion and emotion from all perspectives. That just expanded my own personal experience of watching it and it’s helped me to look at every situation of conflict or disagreement, and have a curiosity about the other person. How does that person that I’m in conflict with right now get to that place? Living through this film and the process has meaningfully enhanced my tendency to think about how somebody got to this place, that I’m in disagreement with.\n\nQ: What is the best advice you’ve ever received?\n\nA: One of my uncles told me, fully unsolicited, “You’ll have a hard time finding a better woman than Nancy Jo, don’t screw this up!”\n\nQ: What is one thing people would be surprised to find out about you?\n\nA: I worked as a waiter at a beachfront restaurant in Italy, near Venice, one summer. It was called La Pergola, on Lido di Jesolo, and I lived above the restaurant with the family owners and the rest of the summer staff.\n\nQ: Please describe your ideal San Diego weekend.\n\nA: It starts with my wife and I, and our dog Camus, walking and exploring the tide pools near our house. If the surf conditions are right (as in calm enough!), I get out on my stand-up paddle for an hour or two, usually from Hogan’s beach. It includes a savory scone for myself and a coffee from the Wayfarer bakery in Bird Rock on one of the mornings, and loading up for the week at the farmers’ market on the other morning. An afternoon bike ride to the Mission Bay jetty, around part of the bay and back, for some good exercise and fun people watching. Then, dinner out (usually downtown, North Park area, or somewhere local to us), followed by a concert at The Rady Shell at Jacobs Park, or live theater at the La Jolla Playhouse or The Old Globe theater."
