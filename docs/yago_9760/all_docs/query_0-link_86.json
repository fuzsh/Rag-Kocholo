        "text": "This has been sitting on my \"to be read\" for quite a while, and I'm so glad I finally came around to it. It's a thrilling novel about jealousy, friendship and conscience.\n\nAfter having stolen a manuscript from her now dead friend and having published it under her own, racially ambiguous name, June lives in a constant hunt between her own conscience and the dreaded revelation by outsiders.\n\nIt's a great example of the unreliable narrator as the reader only gets to know June's own thoughts, and she's great at justifying herself. It's a book that will keep you own your toes because you're constantly required not to forget to make your own judgement of things.\n\nReady for a little visit to a japanese bookshop? This is the right place for anyone who wants to escape from everyday life and is looking for something think about. A wonderful collection of stories that was deservedly nominated for the Japanese Bookseller Award.\n\nIn a world of \"Elites\" and \"Ordinaries\", where the Elites are superior in every way, could one Ordinary change the way of life for all of those that have been banned and murdered in the Kingdom of Ilya?\n\nThe next trials are going to be different than all that came before, because Kai, the second son of the King and an Elite, needs to prove himself to the people of Ilya and show that he is worthy to be the next \"Enforcer\". Meanwhile Paedyn, an Ordinary from the Slums, gets dragged into the trials and has only one goal: survive.\n\nBut things quickly get more complicated as the chemistry between Kai and Paedyn grows (and the banter between those two should not be missed).\n\nA wonderful new world of fantasy for all lovers of \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Crowns of Nyaxia\".\n\nHarriet and Wyn didn't really think their plan through and now they have to hide the truth from their friends. Pretending to still be in a relationship is harder than they thought. Especially when there are hidden feelings involved.\n\nFollow their journey and fall in love with their \"Happy Place\". But be aware: You might need a box of tissues right beside you at all times, while reading this book.\n\nNora is done with life...in the Midnight Library she has the unique chance to try out all her different lives by undoing one regret. Which one will she choose to live hence forward?\n\nA magical what-if novel that speaks to everyone, because we have all asked ourselves at least once: \"What if\"?.\n\nEasily one of the best books I've read this year.\n\nAt the age of 8, Alice begins to see other people's emotions in the form of colourful auras surrounding them. As we follow Alice on her life's journey it is clear that her ability can be a gift and a curse.\n\nI applaud Ahern's capability to take you through the whole spectrum of emotions and the brilliant character building she did with Alice.\n\nThis book is definitely worth the hype! Although sceptical at first, unsure if it would live up to my expectations, I ended up giving a 5-star rating and even shed a tear or two at the end. Following a group of 4 college freinds as they navigate their way through life, Yanagihara lets us experience what true friendship and suffering are like. Every single page is beautifully written and encapsulating. This is a story that will stay with you forever.\n\nEvelyn Hugo tells her story of fame and what it cost her. You might think that the book is really about her husbands, after all, that's what the title suggests. The truth is though, that they only play supporting roles in her eventful, colourful and sometimes dangerous life. This was such a captivating story, I'm not surprised it will be made into a movie soon."
