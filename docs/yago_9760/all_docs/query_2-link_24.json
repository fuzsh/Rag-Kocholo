        "text": "U.S. 2022\n\nDirected by Ethan Coen\n\nProducers: Steve Bing, Mick Jagger, Victoria Pearman, Peter Afterman, T Bone Burnett\n\nExecutive producers: Michael Rapino, Ryan Kroft, Callie Khouri, Stuart Besser\n\nEdited by Tricia Anne Cooke\n\n74 min. A24\n\nA sneak preview of Ethan Coen’s solo directorial debut: an all-archival portrait of the legendary, controversial rock n’ roll maverick, Jerry Lee Lewis, packed with electrifying live footage.\n\nIn 1957, Jerry Lee Lewis topped the U.S. Country and R&B charts simultaneously with the self-consciously risqué rockabilly romp “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On.” The track’s driving, boogie-woogie piano and sly, insinuating vocals represent a rich, blistering, and then-unprecedented synthesis. As a child growing up in Louisiana, Lewis was enraptured by the gospel and blues music he’d heard made by African-American musicians in his community, and the influence stuck. In 1958, while Lewis was touring the United Kingdom, it was reported that he’d married his thirteen-year old cousin Myra Gale Brown, and also that he’d lied to the press about her age. In the ensuing uproar, the tour was cancelled, and so was Jerry Lee, at least as an international headliner; unbowed and unapologetic, he reinvented himself as a hard-driving road warrior, playing three hundred shows a year in small clubs.\n\nThe complications of a life lived on one’s own terms are at the heart of TROUBLE IN MIND. For his first non-fiction feature, Coen and his co-editor Tricia Cooke—the filmmaker’s wife and a key collaborator on several Coen classics, including the Oscar-winning FARGO—employ a found-footage approach, eschewing talking-head documentary conventions. In the process, the film also forestalls easy judgments on a man whose lurid reputation preceded him for over half a century and will forever remain inextricable from his creative legacy. The only real voice in the movie belongs to Jerry Lee, captured in a series of vintage television interviews featuring their share of smiling denials (“I’m a good boy,” he insists with the insidious grin of someone who isn’t) as well as long stretches of exhilarating, undeniable performance footage. The critic Robert Christgau once wrote that the singer seemed to be connected to his piano by his brain stem, and Lewis’ chaotic, flawless keyboard technique—another contradiction—did as much to galvanize rock and roll as Elvis Presley’s swinging hips.\n\nReviews"
