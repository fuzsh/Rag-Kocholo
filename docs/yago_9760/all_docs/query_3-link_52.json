        "text": "Trouble in Mind\n\nOne of the great romantics of American film, Alan Rudolph made “Trouble in Mind,” the movie that might be his magnum opus, in 1985, riding the reputation of his unexpectedly successful “Choose Me” and carrying several cast members, including Geneviève Bujold and Keith Carradine, along with him. Now 25 years old, this quirky, dreamlike film dates from a time when a greater range of stylistic options were available to independent filmmakers, as opposed to the chilly digital realism that seems to prevail today.\n\nSet in a retro future, created on a low budget by using selected perspectives on the then cinematically underexposed city of Seattle, “Trouble in Mind” pushes stylization about as far as American moviegoers will accept in a dramatic film, and perhaps a little bit further. At times, with its keening, Eastern-influenced score by Mark Isham and bluesy vocals by Marianne Faithful, it seems about to mutate into a musical.\n\nThe film is a Manichean morality play, a struggle between good and evil played out in blissful denial of psychological complexity. There is a couple representing innocence: Coop (Mr. Carradine) and Georgia (the radiant Lori Singer), a pair of rustic naïfs who live in a trailer camp with their baby son. And there is a couple representing experience: Hawk (Kris Kristofferson), a former police detective just out of jail for killing a gangster, and Wanda (the silken Ms. Bujold), once Hawk’s lover and now the proprietor of a cozy waterfront diner.\n\nWhen Coop gets a taste of larceny, helping himself to the petty-cash box at a work site where he has been denied a job, he takes wife, child and trailer to Rain City, as Seattle has been suitably renamed, in search of further nefarious opportunities. He ties up with an oracular stick-up man named Solo (Joe Morton) and embarks on a series of jewel robberies that lead him into conflict with Rain City’s reigning crime lord (Divine, the cross-dressing star of John Waters’s early films, here doing Sydney Greenstreet in a gray, double-breasted suit).\n\nGeorgia, perplexed by her partner’s transformation (scene by scene, he seems to be evolving from Mr. Green Jeans into the Joker, with crazily pomaded hair and a blood-red zoot suit), falls under Hawk’s protective eye, just as Hawk is protected by the wise and remote Wanda. This hierarchy of concern is gracefully conceptualized by Mr. Rudolph with his emphasis on Rain City’s vertical orientation, from the tip of the Space Needle to the view of the bay from Wanda’s window.\n\nWhenever “Trouble in Mind” threatens to become too self-consciously poetic, Mr. Rudolph’s sly sense of humor slips in to undermine the tone of brooding solemnity; minor characters exchange whispered sarcasms, and there is an absurdly huge and bloodless gun battle that suggests a parody of Brian De Palma’s 1983 “Scarface.” Patrols of stern-faced soldiers and roving bands of protestors suggest that Rain City is also under some form of martial law, for reasons that remain carefully unexplained.\n\nBut in the end this is a proudly, voluptuously melancholic film, perhaps Mr. Rudolph’s most emotionally resonant effort along with his similarly structured “Afterglow” of 1997. It’s good to have it back in this fine transfer from the original negative. (Shout! Factory, $19.97, R)\n\nEscape From Zahrain\n\nContinuing to thumb the pages of the neglected Paramount catalog, the independent distributor Olive Films has come up with “Escape From Zahrain,” a modest 1962 adventure film (it was originally released on a double bill with Don Siegel’s “Hell Is for Heroes”) starring Yul Brynner and directed by the British jack of all trades Ronald Neame.\n\nNo Oscar nominations greeted “Escape From Zahrain,” a standard-issue desert adventure in which Brynner, as a charismatic rebel leader in the fictitious Arab nation of the title, escapes from a prison transport and is forced to flee across the burning sands with an archetypically ragtag group of companions: a teenage firebrand (Sal Mineo), a sadistic killer (Anthony Caruso), an American adventurer (Jack Warden), a comic thief (Jay Novello) and a beautiful nurse (Madlyn Rhue). The film’s one surprise, and it will be preserved here, is a welcome cameo appearance by a well-known British actor with an open-minded work ethic similar to Neame’s own. (Olive Films, $24.95, not rated)\n\nFour in a Jeep\n\nA curiosity made in 1951 under the combined influence of Italian neo-realism and Carol Reed’s “Third Man,” “Four in a Jeep” was shot in occupied Vienna by the Swiss director Leopold Lindtberg. Appropriately, this cold war parable won the top prize, the Golden Bear, at the first Berlin Film Festival, where the public had no difficulty identifying with the difficulties of living in a divided city.\n\nRalph Meeker, in his first film role, is the American member of a four-man international police patrol; when he discovers a beautiful young woman (Viveca Lindfors, a Swedish actress by way of Hollywood) living in dread in the Soviet sector, he conspires with his British and French colleagues to get her out. But the Russian member of the team (the Jerusalem-born actor Yossi Yadin) is reluctant to break the rules.\n\nAt least four languages are spoken in the film; probably half a dozen more were spoken on the set. A truly international movie made at a time when postwar Europe was providing filmmakers with the world’s largest set, “Four in a Jeep” never escapes its ideological program but does offer a window into a fascinating, unsettled era, when new hopes were dawning alongside new fears. (VCI Entertainment, $14.99, not rated)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nINCEPTION Christopher Nolan’s puzzle-box thriller stars Leonardo DiCaprio as an industrial spy who specializes in infiltrating dreams, only to run up against his own subconscious. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy. This “visually arresting, noir-tinged caper, is as packed with illusions and citations as a film studies term paper,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in July. “Though there is a lot to see in ‘Inception,’ there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan’s idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, too rule bound to allow the full measure of madness — the risk of real confusion, of delirium, of ineffable ambiguity — that this subject requires.” (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray/standard combo $35.99, DVD $28.98, PG-13)\n\nSHREK FOREVER AFTER The lovable green ogre with the voice of Mike Myers encounters Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn) in an extended animated homage to “It’s a Wonderful Life.” “What fortifies ‘Shrek Forever After’ are its brilliantly realized principal characters, who nearly a decade after the first ‘Shrek’ film remain as vital and engaging fusions of image, personality and voice as any characters in the history of animation,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times in May. With the voices of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and a lot of other people, including Larry King. Mike Mitchell directed. (Paramount, Blu-ray/standard combo $49.99, Blu-ray, $34.99, standard $29.99, PG)\n\nRESTREPO A year with an American platoon in Afghanistan, observed in a harrowing documentary by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger. “What you come away with, above all, is a sense of the fragile, indelible individuality of the soldiers, whose names, faces and ways of talking are likely to stick in your mind for a long time,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in June. (Virgil Films, Blu-ray $34.99, standard $19.99, R)\n\nMADEMOISELLE CHAMBON Stéphane Brizé’s French film chronicles the love affair of a married man (Vincent Lindon) and his young son’s teacher (Sandrine Kiberlain). “This exquisitely acted film,” Mr. Holden wrote in The Times in May, “belongs to a long line of French films exploring desire and the consequences of acting on it.” (Lorber Films, Blu-ray $34.95, standard $29.95, not rated)\n\nCRONOS The first feature film by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (“Pan’s Labyrinth”) is a gothic tale about an antiquarian (Federico Luppi) who discovers an ancient device that may bring immortality — at a cost. “This film’s reflective, even stately style elevates it from the ranks of ordinary stake-through-the-heart vampire dramaturgy,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times in 1993. (Criterion Collection, Blu-ray $39.95, standard $29.95, R)"
