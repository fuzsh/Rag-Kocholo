        "text": "Like scripture, Paris in the twenties invites invocation for virtually any purpose, and one of the merits of Alan Rudolph’s wryly stylized 1988 film, “The Moderns,” is suggested by its title. The film filters Hemingwayesque elements into the fictional story of Nick Hart (Keith Carradine), an American painter living in France. With a few brilliant anachronisms (including the songs written and performed by Charlélie Couture), Rudolph turns the story’s blend of sexual obsession, artistic passion, outsized celebrity, loose money, and national bravado into a refraction of modern times—down to the newfound attraction of Hollywood as the unavoidable center of cultural attention. He’s having fun with his less-than-reverent depiction of Ernest Hemingway as a dandified and slightly bewildered wit whose bons mots are as much a mode of self-defense as of self-expression, and his presentation of Gertrude Stein as a domineering scold. Though the gentle satire may play into Hollywood’s own largely anti-intellectual stereotypes, Rudolph thrusts style to the fore: whether his own or Hemingway’s, it comes off as the essence of substance and the stuff that romantic dreams are made of.\n\nDaily Comment\n\nJoe Biden Leaves the Stage\n\nThe Shakespearean end to a distinguished reign.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nThe Return of “No Fear, No Die,” Claire Denis’s First Masterwork\n\nThis 1990 drama reveals, in documentary-like detail, the power and the politics of an illegal cockfighting ring.\n\nMusical Events\n\nAn Opera About John Singer Sargent and a Male Model\n\nDamien Geter’s “American Apollo,” at Des Moines Metro Opera, along with revivals of Debussy and Strauss."
