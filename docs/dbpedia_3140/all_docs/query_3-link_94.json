        "text": "Advertisement\n\nVarious horror-themed games have made it in to celebrate Halloween\n\nJust the one this week, but it is certainly a classic. Zombies (Zombies Ate My Neighbors in other regions) is a SNES game from LucasArts available for the usual 800 points. You take turns playing Zeke and Julie (or both at once in 2 player co-op) as they try to rescue surviving neighbors in the 55 stages. All sorts of undead lurk in the environments the game takes you to for you to stop them with the various weapons available.\n\nTwo WiiWare releases this week, including one long overdue title. LIT, a WayForward horror game for 800 points, originally arrived in the US on February 9, so it has taken a while to get here. The wait has probably been worth it, though, as we get a special enhanced version that tries to take care of some of the issues reviewers had with the original version of the game. You play Jake, who is trying to rescue his girlfriend from his high school which is overrun with undead. Pointer controls are used heavily here to aim Jake’s flash light and activate switches to turn on other lighting in the rooms.\n\nGhost Mansion Party from Gameloft also made it here this week, which took less than a week after the NA release. For 1000 points, you get a fairly generic horror-themed party game for up to four people. The Wii certainly has quite enough of these, so we’d only recommend it if you’re a huge fan of the genre.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ by Gammick Entertainment makes for the last game to celebrate Halloween, but unfortunately it seems we missed out on it! It is essentially a downloadable version of the retail game with the same name for 800 points, so if you’ve heard about it then you’ll know what to expect. It is essentially a rail shooter that follows your choice of Little Red Riding Hood or Momotarō as they blast through zombies that have invaded the last after Little Red’s grandmother was saved. The retail version got some positive reviews (I know certain members of our team like it, too!), so it is certainly a shame that we can’t download it as Australians.\n\nThe last title this week is a little bit of a strange choice, considering it is in no way fitting with the rest of the releases. A Little Bit of… All Time Classics: Card Classics is a cut down version of 42 All-Time Classics on the DS with only five card games: Blackjack, Five Card Draw, Last Card, Last Card Plus, and President. At 500 points, this seems a little light compared to the original game, so unless you just want those five then you’d probably be better suited picking up the retail version."
