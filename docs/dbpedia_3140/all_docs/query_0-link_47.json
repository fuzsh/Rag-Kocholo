        "text": "PostSurprisingly Good DSiWare Games (also on 3DS)...\n\nby HSH28 » Sat May 07, 2011 1:19 am\n\nDue to coming into a load of Nintendo Points recently, I decided to do a little trawling to find out if I'd missed any good DSiWare games. To my surprise I found a whole host of games that I hadn't really paid any attention to on the service that it turns out might be pretty damn good.\n\nSeeing as the Store itself is a pile of crap, I figure there might be a few people on here with a DSi who are completely unaware of a source of good cheap (Nintendo Points cheap at theHut at the moment) games they can purchase.\n\nAnyway, thought I'd make a topic for it and post a list of decent looking ones with some information. Feel free to add any I've missed.\n\nStarting with the probably quite well known, Art Style games, there are 7 of these games...\n\nCode\n\nAquite\n\nNemrem\n\nPiCOPiCT\n\nKubos\n\nBoxlife\n\nIntersect\n\n...they are all pretty great, the first 6 were made by Skip, while the last is Q Games and is actually a remake of a GBA game called DigiDrive.\n\nThat out of the way, there are the rest of the Nintendo published games on the service.\n\nStarship Patrol, Reflect Missile and (the unfortunately named) 3D Space Tank are all also Q Games developed and are without a doubt some of the best titles on DS period. The first is a Tower Defense game, the second an Action Puzzle game and the last a 3D shooter. 3D Space Tank is the sequel to a Japan only X on Gameboy which was developed by Argonaut Software, who obviously went on to help make Star Fox.\n\nA game I had no idea existed next, Face Pilot: Fly With Your Nintendo DSi Camera! developed by HAL, its a Hangglider game controlled by the movement of your head on the bottom screen. No doubting this might have been some kind of Pilotwings inspired project, its not on that level, but it works pretty well, its unique and well worth checking out. Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again! is NST developed and basically more MvDK, its just more of a really good game.\n\nMetal Torrent is a 2D Bullet Hell shooter developed by Arika (ex Capcom people), Link 'n' Launch an Intelligent Systems developed puzzle game in perhaps a Pipemania vein, but with twists. Wakugumi - Monochrome Puzzle a black and white tile sliding puzzle game thats pretty cool.\n\nMoving away from Nintendo there's Shantae: Risky's Revenge and Mighty Flip Champs from WayForward. The former is a really good looking 2D Platformer which is a sequel to a GBC game and the latter really good Puzzle Platformer.\n\nDark Void Zero is a fake NES 2D action game, it does a good job of it though and is probably better than the full title they put out.\n\nSoul of Darkness a shameless Gameloft Castlevania ripoff that ends up being really, really good.\n\nMaestro! Green Groove, GO Series: Ivy the Kiwi? Mini, Chronos Twins, Plants vs. Zombies. These are all ports or cut down versions of full DS games, the first one is part of a very strange Music based platformer, which sees you 'playing the platforms to produce classical music, its one of 6 areas that were in the full retail release, but it was an extremely limited run and is very rare now. Ivy is probably known by a few people, a weird little touch platformer made by Yuji Naka of Sega fame, the DSiWare version is the 50 main levels of SP with the bonus and MP taken out. Chronos Twins is a full game, originally a GBA title that got ported to DS, it sees you controlling two characters (one in the past the other the present) in a 2D sidescrolling action game. I think PvZ is pretty well known, the DSiWare version loses Vs, Puzzle and Survival modes, but keeps the DS minigames (and adds 1 new one).\n\nGlow Artisan is a puzzle game that sees you drawing lines of colour over a grid to try to match a picture, its got tonnes of content, you can also take pictures with the DSi Camera and convert them into puzzles.\n\nRytmik, not a game at all, but a cool little in depth music creating app.\n\nI'll stop there, but that is by no means the end to the stuff worth looking at on DSiWare, there is still stuff being released and some of it is actually good. If you'd given up on the thing a while ago, you really should check out some of these games if you aren't aware of them. Also like I said, feel free to post more recommendations.\n\nEDIT - More games added...\n\nMore games to look at (wasn't quite finished there rudderless)...\n\nMr. Driller: Drill Till You Drop mission, time attack and dristone modes available in this version.\n\nDragon Quest Wars grid based strategy game.\n\nGO Series: Earth Saver an action puzzle game, kind of like Qix, definitely worth checking out.\n\nPop Plus: Solo a popping bubbles puzzle game and an enhanced version of the WiiWare game.\n\nAura-Aura Climber NST developed action game, you are a little star that climbs up the sreen jumping and grappling points.\n\nAlphaBounce RPG Arkanoid type game, loads of content, well worth playing.\n\nPop Island: Paperfield isometric 3D racing capture the flag style game, support for 8 players local.\n\nZenonia massive action RPG in the Zelda/SoM style.\n\nSurfacer+ Dexterity + Strategy flower growing puzzle game.\n\nFieldrunners tower defense game.\n\nCastle of Magic Gameloft developed platformer\n\nRytmik: Rock Edition and Hip Hop King: Rytmik Edition two more versions of Rythmik but with different sounds and features.\n\nLast edited by HSH28 on Fri Dec 02, 2011 8:01 pm, edited 2 times in total.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Christopher » Sat May 07, 2011 1:22 am\n\nYeah, there are some real gems on the service. Shame it's so gooseberry fool to navigate through. I hope the e-Shop is a massive improvement.\n\nDragon Quest Wars is also really good fun.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby rudderless » Sat May 07, 2011 1:23 am\n\nNice idea, H. I think you've just about covered all the good ones, though. But that should hopefully give some people some ideas on what to spend their Nintendo Points on.\n\nQuote\n\n[iup=3595962]KB[/iup] wrote:People like Glen Whelan have a proper face!\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Christopher » Sat May 07, 2011 1:26 am\n\nOne thing to remember also, is that the game only run from the internal memory. Same thing when they run on 3DS too. You can move them an SD Card, but then you have to copy them back as they don't launch from the card.\n\nI spent loads on DSiWare last year, only bought Shantae this year.

The Wii got updated to run stuff from SD card, I presume they didn't bother with the DSi because it wasn't worth it for them, but they'll have to have it sorted for the 3DS, the damn thing comes with an SD card for gods sake.\n\nThe 3DS got more internal memory than the DSi anyway, hasn't it?\n\nLast edited by HSH28 on Sat May 07, 2011 1:30 am, edited 1 time in total.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Christopher » Sat May 07, 2011 1:29 am\n\nHSH28 wrote:\n\nsuzzopher wrote:One thing to remember also, is that the game only run from the internal memory.

Yeah it has much bigger internal memory, so shouldn't be a problem, from my understanding VC and 3DS games will run from memory cards.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby HSH28 » Sat May 07, 2011 9:29 am\n\nMore games to look at (wasn't quite finished there rudderless)...\n\nMr. Driller: Drill Till You Drop mission, time attack and dristone modes available in this version.\n\nDragon Quest Wars grid based strategy game.\n\nGO Series: Earth Saver an action puzzle game, kind of like Qix, definitely worth checking out.\n\nPop Plus: Solo a popping bubbles puzzle game and an enhanced version of the WiiWare game.\n\nAura-Aura Climber NST developed action game, you are a little star that climbs up the sreen jumping and grappling points.\n\nAlphaBounce RPG Arkanoid type game, loads of content, well worth playing.\n\nPop Island: Paperfield isometric 3D racing capture the flag style game, support for 8 players local.\n\nZenonia massive action RPG in the Zelda/SoM style.\n\nSurfacer+ Dexterity + Strategy flower growing puzzle game.\n\nFieldrunners tower defense game.\n\nCastle of Magic Gameloft developed platformer\n\nRytmik: Rock Edition and Hip Hop King: Rytmik Edition two more versions of Rythmik but with different sounds and features.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Dandy Kong » Sat May 07, 2011 9:46 am\n\nThe Game & Watch games, especially Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario's Cement Factory.\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Fruits Punch Samurai » Sat May 07, 2011 10:07 am\n\nAnyone got Rayman?

On the other hand its better than the GBA game apparently and other people don't find it to be an issue...\n\nQuote\n\nPostRe: The Surprisingly Good DSiWare Games thread...\n\nby Fruits Punch Samurai » Sat May 07, 2011 10:40 am\n\nMight get it when the shop comes to 3DS.
