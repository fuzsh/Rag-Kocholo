        "text": "Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is an action game in which players can shoot their way through hordes of zombies, evil puppets, and other creatures. Combat is constant, with action moving vertically over a 2-D environment. The two playable characters use a variety of weapons including machine guns, flamethrowers, lasers and shotguns. Body parts of zombies (e.g., heads, arms, torsos) can be shot off, sometimes leaving sets of legs walking towards the player's character. Splashes of red blood are also seen when enemies and players' characters are hit. Some bosses use projectile vomit attacks (i.e., green slime) to inflict damage upon the player. Red Riding Hood is depicted with a low cut top and exposed cleavage, and her skirt will rise up to expose her underwear when players make her crouch down. Moderate profanity (e.g., \"hell,\" and \"a*s\") is used occasionally during cutscene dialogue."
