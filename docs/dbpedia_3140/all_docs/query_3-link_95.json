        "text": "Post by 1983parrothead on\n\nI've linked to the gameplay videos if you want to see them in action. This thread is also to discuss about them.\n\nShootout (Data East, 1985) - The one that started the crosshair shooter genre.\n\nEmpire City: 1931 (Seibu Kaihatsu, 1986) - Another crosshair shooter, but with a real crosshair added to it. The grandfather of Dynamite Duke.\n\nCabal (TAD Corporation (splinter of Data East), 1988) - The one that popularized the genre.\n\nDead Angle (Seibu Kaihatsu, 1988) - Sequel to Empire City: 1931 and father of Dynamite Duke.\n\nDynamite Duke (Seibu Kaihatsu, 1989) - Unlike previous crosshair shooters, this was the first to feature close combat, which is why it was successful.\n\nBlood Bros. (TAD Corporation, 1990) - Spinoff of Cabal.\n\nNAM-1975 (SNK, 1990) - First Neo-Geo title. You even can throw bombs in this one.\n\nThe Punisher (NES) (LJN/Beam Software, 1990) - Perhaps the first to be home exclusive, as well as being a licensed game.\n\nSpinal Breakers (Video System, 1990) - Features rolling.\n\nRiot (NMK, 1992) - Crosshair shooter where you can shoot in the foreground and background.\n\nLucky & Wild (Namco, 1993) - Arcade-exclusive crosshair shooter with a steering wheel added to it.\n\nWild Guns (Natsume, 1994) - An underrated crosshair shooter similar to Blood Bros..\n\nSin & Punishment (Nintendo/Treasure, 2000) - First 3D polygonal crosshair shooter. Features close combat using weapons.\n\nSin & Punishment: Star Successor/Successor of the Skies (Nintendo/Treasure, 2009) - Sequel to Sin & Punishment.\n\nGamshara (Mitchell, 2002) - Based in Feudal Japan era.\n\nPost by Feynman on\n\nNah, those aren't quite the same. I mean, yeah, they feature a crosshair and aren't technically light gun games due to the way the guns attached to the arcade cabinet work, but they play just like light gun games, the only real difference is that your gun is stationary and operated like a turret.\n\nThe defining feature of the \"crosshair shooter\" genre being discussed here is the presence of an on-screen protagonist that you have to control and keep out of harm's way in addition to controlling a crosshair and blasting enemies.\n\nPost by Feynman on\n\nActually I guess if Empire City counts then T2 and Revolution X do as well.\n\nThough personally I think the lack of an on-screen character makes all of those games are a bit too different to be lumped in with Cabal and the like.\n\nPost by caoslayer on\n\nNinjaed just before posting them..\n\nanyways..\n\nRambo 3: www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mwc1VG5s1A\n\nGi Joe: www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYODi95wIcQ\n\nBoth with missiles as grenades and with the cross always aligned to the character in the horizontal axis.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSomething rare, Aligator Hunt, Gaelco 1994\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq0QvT86wwk\n\nYou start as kids in skateboard and then they ride and shoot with spaceships.\n\nPost by Gendo Ikari on\n\nThere a few more of them on MAME but are usually of low quality, like SWAT Police and a pirate-themed one (and it may be just an hack of Blood Bros with different graphics).\n\nPost by Garamoth on\n\nWow, that's such a small genre. That makes it possible to try them all without much of a fuss.\n\nThere's that fake Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles app from the weekly kusoge. Does that count?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nSpinal Breakers has one of the creepiest endings of any 90's arcade game, next to Cyber-Lip, King of the Monsters 2 and Chimera Beast. The protagonist Captain Waffle has a secret guest appearance in Aero Fighters 3 (it turns out that he's also the pilot from Turbo Force)."
