        "text": "Rondo of Swords is a very cool srpg which is worth playing too. It has a really cool battle system where you have to run through enemies to hurt them, so you can hit multiple enemies with one character in one turn.\n\nIt's fairly unique as far as I know. There was also a knockback mechanic, so sometimes you'd get pushed back instead of running through, which could leave you in a lot of trouble.\n\nIt also has a meaningful choice a fair way into the game which creates two story branches.\n\nI cosign Ghost Trick and Infinite Space that have also been mentioned in this thread. Super games.\n\nGhost Trick, which was already mentioned\n\nElite Beat Agents, which I am surprised was not mentioned\n\nBeyond EBA, I'd also recommend the first and second Ouendan games. They're amazing and hilarious, even if (like me) you can't read a word of Japanese. And they apparently go pretty cheap (~$30-50) on ebay, too.\n\nGonna assume OP is familiar with the Etrian Odyssey games, but if not Etrian Odyssey 3 is a fantastic JRPG dungeon crawler. There's also a fan translation for 7th Dragon that I've been meaning to get back to. You know... eventually.\n\nChou Soujuu Mecha MG (Japan-only). A 3D mech combat game by the EDF/RAD people, you control the mech with the touchscreen controls on the bottom and they can get pretty tricky with some machines.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood Zombie BBQ\n\nIt's just a super simple, super satisfying shooter rail shooter that's great to kill some time with.\n\nIsn't that DSiWare? I thought that shop was shut down? If you can get to that then get Alpha Bounce. A Breakout game with a world to explore.\n\nRondo of Swords is a very cool srpg which is worth playing too. It has a really cool battle system where you have to run through enemies to hurt them, so you can hit multiple enemies with one character in one turn.\n\nIt's fairly unique as far as I know.\n\nMario + Rabbids also lets you run through enemies to deal damage to them, it's not your main attack but some characters can cause a lot of chaos with it.\n\nAnyone know how Radiant Historia is on 3DS compared to the original? Also, same question for Strange Journey.\n\nIt's literally the same game but in widescreen with extra stuff.\n\nRadiant Historia: Perfect Chronology |OT| WE HAVE TO GO BACK! OT\n\nDeveloper: ATLUS Co. Ltd. Publisher: ATLUS (NA/JP)/Deep Silver (EU) Platform: Nintendo 3DS Release Date: June 29, 2017 (JP) | February 13, 2018 (NA) | February 16, 2018 (EU) Genre: It's an RPG from Japan with time travel so I am legally obligated to claim it is like Chrono Trigger (it's not)...\n\nI don't think radiant historia or TWEWY are hidden gems but if you haven't played them, do it.\n\nalso seconding ghost trick. Such a strange and lovely game\n\nAnyone know how Radiant Historia is on 3DS compared to the original? Also, same question for Strange Journey.\n\nDS is one of my favorite games of all time. I couldn't get more than 10-15 hours into the port. The new content does NOT feel good and just adds weird bloat to the game I did not like. The original is far better and has better art (whichyou can buy as DLC but...)\n\nJust go for the original if you can. I found the new content super detracts from the story and Meta narrative of the game.\n\nDamn I can't believe nobody posted Henry Hatsworth. It's a 2D action platformer (think Shovel Knight or Castlevania) in which you play Panel de Pon (Tetris Attack) on the bottom screen while you're platforming on the top. The puzzle slowly slides to the top the entire level, and when you click to the touchscreen the action on Top will freeze while you play your puzzles and you can match up colors to power up your guy and solve puzzles and such.\n\nBOTH the 2D platforming and the puzzles were really good. It's a top notch game and very very challenging.\n\nI came in here to post this. It's a truly unique game.\n\nDamn I can't believe nobody posted Henry Hatsworth.

It's a top notch game and very very challenging.\n\nwas going to recommend this, so instead, i'll recommend the game the guys behind henry released after it\n\nMONSTER TALE\n\nI still prefere henry hatsworth, but this one is pretty good too\n\n999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors is the best game on the DS and a gateway drug to the visual novel genre. Even if lots of text in a game doesn't seem like your bag, give it a shot.\n\nBut as far as gameplay-driven games on DS are concerned, this is the secret best game.\n\nIf you like horror games and have the ability to play translations then Nanashi no Game and it's sequel.\n\nI just finished the first and am currently halfway through the second. They are great with headphones late at night. Best to play on real hardware since you hold the DS like a book.\n\nThanks, I'd never heard of these.\n\nGlory Days 2: Weird sidescrolling mixture of Choplifter and an RTS.\n\nLooney Tunes: Duck Amuck: A very inventive mini game collection based on the classic Looney Tunes cartoon.\n\nNew International Track & Field: A pretty good version of the classic Konami sports title. Great presentation with a lot of Konami fan service.\n\nPoint Blank DS: Well, it's Point Blank but now with touch controls. Works surprisingly well.\n\nNeves: Tangram -based puzzle game. A perfect fit for the system.\n\nTrue Swing Golf: A bit barebones but well-playing touch-based golf game.\n\nI also second the Orcs & Elves and Civilization Revolution DS mentions.\n\nOne DS game I was always curious about but never actually played was the DS port of the pc classic Jagged Alliance. I loved the original back in the day. Based on the videos it looks quite faithful to the original."
