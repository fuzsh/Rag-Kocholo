They both have their own appeal.”\n\n– 3D type of Mario game (which also applies to Zelda), it isn’t always easy to perceive depth\n\n– Can see more clearly what’s closer to you with the 3D effect\n\n– Miyamoto feels that the 3DS’s 3D effect also “gives a great feeling of existence to Mario, Link and others”\n\n– This is important for Miyamoto’s games since they’re made with character “weight” in mind (making the player feel like the character has weight in its movement)\n\n– Regarding 2D Mario games, Miyamoto noted that depth-based effects are already present in many of the games, such as a Wiggler or Bullet Bill flying at the screen from afar\n\n– Miyamoto: “It’s difficult to tell when they will hit the player, so we were only able to use these lightly. However, we’ll be able to use this type of thing quite a bit on the 3DS.”\n\n– Iwata: “You went more in-depth than I’d been expected. This is the first I’ve heard of this.”\n\n– Miyamoto in response to Iwata: “No good? Don’t tell any game magazine people.”\n\nSource\n\nMessenger bag (550 coins)\n\nIdeal for carrying games, books, and much more, this durable and stylish messenger bag shows off a Club Nintendo exclusive design featuring Mario™ icons including Super Star!\n\n• 100% Black Cotton Canvas, Made in the USA\n\n• Dimensions: 15 x 13 x 3 inches, with 45 inch loop handle\n\n• Bag holds up to 30 pounds\n\nTote Bag (250 coins)\n\nA fun and functional tote bag that features a silkscreened Super Mario™ Power Up Mushroom design exclusive to Club Nintendo.
