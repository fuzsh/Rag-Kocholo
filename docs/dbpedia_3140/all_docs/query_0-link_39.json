Granted, the versus mode is imbalanced (a good Plant player puts up a good fight, but a good Zombie player wins), but IIRC, the DS retail version is THE only version of PvZ to sport multiplay--not even the PC has 2player, but i might be wrong. multiplay supports Download Play (2 DS, one game cart) and multicart (2 DS, 2 game carts).\n\nFor those who can't read this hideous font:\n\nI'm going to be buying myself a 3DS in less than a week (finally) and I'm debating on which games I should buy alongside the console.

DS was really skewed, Plant player stand no chance against a spammer Zombie player. two or three Football Zombies and you're toast if you don't have a quick nuke or two.\n\nOk, let me try to actually answer your question.\n\nI am not unlike you. I would much rather have a game saved to my 3DS then lugging around a spare game card. Perfect example was tetris. I got Tetris Axis for my 3DS, but I was highly disappointed in it. So much so I bought the DSiware Tetris Party and haven't looked back. For me, when it comes to tetris, I just want to clear lines in Marathon mode, the other modes don't matter to me in the slightest.\n\nBut back to the matter at hand. I've been looking around, and it looks like the DSiware version of Plants Vs Zombies has most of what the cartridge version does. It's missing stuff like Puzzle, Survival, and Multiplayer, and (arguably) smaller things like the Zen Garden and Tree of Wisdom. It holds the entire adventure mode and the mini games however. In that respect, it is nearly identical to the Android version of Plants Vs Zombies (which I have, which is still fun missing these things).\n\nIf you're like me, then you wont regret getting the DSiware version. However, if the stuff I mentioned that was removed is stuff you wanted, you're better off with the cartridge version."
