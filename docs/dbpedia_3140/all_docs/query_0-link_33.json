        "text": "I once wrote a long post on another website about the godlike DS exclusive Prey the Stars, so I will repost it here because I don't remember all the minutae about the game offhand!\n\nThe only reason I've even heard of this game is because Koei promoted the crap out of it in Nintendo Power, usually in double ads alongside Pop Cutie: Street Fashion Simulation. (Never tried that one and I doubt I ever will.) Weirdly enough the ads focused more on the fact that figure designer Touma designed the characters than the actual game itself. Considering the majority of players would have no clue who Touma is or why they should care that he's involved, I'm not sure why they did this. Even the most diehard of gamers would probably only know him as the character designer of Fang the Sniper from the Game Gear Sonic the Hedgehog games.\n\nAnyways, on to the actual game. You can choose between 4 wacky dog-like aliens who have the ability to bite, lick, and suck objects. These objects are scattered around flat grids, and you have to run around trying to eat as many as possible. However, they all have different elements, so there's a bit of strategy with what buttons you mash. An electric object is painful to bite so you have to suck it, while a watery object would require licking. The characters each have their own stats as well - Gabu is the all-rounder, Bari is great at biting, Pero is a licking master, and Chuchu sucks things up like nobody's business.\n\nAll of the different elemental properties correspond to various powers you can get by eating multiple of the same element in a row, like an electric ball, a metal blade, and a gust of wind, all of which can be as weapons used to attack opponents. Sometimes if you eat three of the same element in a row, you can turn into a giant monster that speedily devours objects and foes without a second thought. It can get pretty wild. In addition, eating certain \"POW\" objects fills your belly meter, which makes you grow in size. The larger you are, the bigger the objects you can eat, and you can even squish opponents beneath your feet if you're bigger than them. It's got kind of a Katamari Damacy appeal to it.\n\nAlthough it's clearly designed around multiplayer since you're always going up against an opponent, there's also a fun single-player mode where you... uh... well, I don't really know what you do since the cutscenes don't make any sense. You go around eating things to free spirits from the Earth or something, and once liberated they engage in some bizarre one-sided dialogue with your chosen monster between levels. Here's one such example of this masterful storytelling:\n\nHi! You can really wolf it down, can't you?\n\nHm? What's wrong? Why the long face?\n\nYou're wondering where everything you eat goes? The scientific explanation has a lot to do with the action of your stomach. It's called the \"guniguni\" action...\n\nIf you want to know what \"guniguni\" means, look it up in a dictionary.\n\n...But you will find nothing!\n\nYou shouldn't be worrying about these things anyway!\n\nBesides all this, there's also a ton of skins to unlock that not only change your look, but also alter your stats in various ways. They've got a bit of a loot aspect to them since there are a lot of different stat modifiers, and you can find multiple versions of the same skin with randomized stats (though you can only keep one at a time). You get these by doing various challenges in each stage like eating X amount of objects or hitting X opponents with a power. Later on it starts getting kind of cheap since they'll hide the objective with question marks (Use ????? on opponents ?? times) but it's not too annoying since they're fairly easy to guess and the levels aren't that long anyway.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it's pretty barebones, but it gets the job done. The music is nothing to write home about either, although the Mega Center theme sounds pretty nice, and the way the menu music slightly changes depending on what selection you're making is really cool. I've only ever seen that done in a few other games, like Mario Kart Wii and Ridge Racer 3D. Surprisingly enough for a niche game like this, it even supported Wi-Fi multiplayer (not that I ever found anybody online to play with, of course). Overall, it's a great little action game and I highly recommend it.\n\nSadly, most of the game I would mention like Izuna or Retro Game Challenge has already been brought up on your podcast. Contact has been mentioned quite a lot on this board, and its definitely an interest game, but it's definitely not an \"everone\" title, just like most Grasshopper games.\n\nNintendo's Clubhouse games is one of my favorites. Granted, its just a collection of simple board and card games, but it's a really polished collection, and I still keep it around with my 3DS whenever I want to play something simple. Basically anything you could get as an app, but polished, adless, and focused. There are also some really good versions of Koi Koi, Shogi, Hasami Shogi, and Shang-hai. I just wish the wifi still worked T_T\n\nMeteos is one of my favorite puzzle games, and the sister title to the Lumines games. It's a block puzzle game where you launch your pieces of the screen rather than clear them.\n\nHear me out on this suggestion: It's utter trash, and yet it's one of my favorite DS titles, and that is Tales of the Tempest. Its basically Bamco's attempt to make a Tales game on DS before Innocence and Hearts did it right, and yet I keep coming back to this. I guess its because its a lot more simple and straight forward, thus easier to play through with no language skills. Like I said, its hard to explain why exactly I enjoy it, but its cheap enough to give it a shot."
