        "text": "This article is over 14 years old and may contain outdated information\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? It’s the best and probably only game featuring a sexy, busty Little Red Riding Hood as a gunner, gunning down all of history’s beloved storybook characters. Gretel, Santa, Granny, and even the Three Little Pigs aren’t the sweet characters that you remember, though. They’re huge, deformed, and angry, and are just asking to be blasted with your gun.\n\nHearing the premise is one thing, but seeing this game in action really lets you know what’s going on here. LRRHZBBQ uses both DS screens to form a vertical playing field. Enemy bosses reside at the top while you, Red, stay at the bottom, doing your best to avoid projectiles all while shooting to take said bosses down.\n\nIn our videos, you’ll see Red go up against both Gretel and Granny. Gretel has a beard for some reason. Granny looks green and horrible, and her dentures come out of her mouth as projectile fire. Of course they do. Later, in perfect horror movie form, possessed furniture flies around Granny’s head, and then flies at you. Finally, while obviously posessed, she barfs out reptilian forms to come and bite you. Again, of course.\n\nSo far, screenshots have done this game no justice. You have to see the videos. Check out both, in a special super tall format, after the jump.\n\nGranny\n\nGretel"
