        "text": "Considering this site is one of the very few that explore alot of DSiWare games, I imagine it's influenced the members here to purchase more games. So how many have you purchased, and what games are they? Also, did this site's reviews have influence?\n\nPersonally, when buying a points card, I use this as my go to site for reviews, as I have not yet come across a bad DsiWare game that they've given a high score for.\n\nAlso, I've currently bought the following\n\n10 Second Run\n\nArmy Defender\n\nAsphalt 4: Elite Racing\n\nAlphaBounce\n\nAura-Aura Climber\n\nBejewled Twist\n\nBomberman Blitz\n\nCave Story\n\nDark Void Zero\n\nDefense Wars\n\nEscapee GO!\n\nFieldrunners\n\nFlipnote Studio\n\nMetal Torrent\n\nPhoto Dojo\n\nPinball Pulse\n\nPop Island\n\nShantae: Risky's Revenge\n\nSoul of Darkness\n\nTetris Party Live\n\nZenonia\n\nAll but 5 were purchased without reading reviews from here. (It was before finding this site )\n\n@BedCommando first of all, thanks for the kind words. A little appreciation goes a long way for us reviewers.\n\nAnd my story is similar to yours: I used to check all of the DSiWare reviews here before making any purchases, and I hadn't been steered wrong. I probably bout between 5 and 10 games based on the reviews here, but now since I've been writing reviews I've had to download a LOT more games than before, but I don't think those really count for this tally\n\nWow! I'm pretty amazed by some of the numbers in here! I've only got about 6, and one of those doesn't really count. My main problem is that I just don't have that much time for mobile gaming at the moment. I've spent all my gameplaying time over the last 3 years playing nothing but Team Fortress 2.\n\nI joined this site for its DSiWare reviews. They are a big influence on my purchases. Here's what I've got:\n\nA Kappa's Trail\n\nA Topsy Turvy Life: The Turvys Strike Back\n\nAiRace: Tunnel\n\nAlphaBounce\n\nArt Style: AQUIA\n\nArt Style: BASE 10\n\nArt Style: DIGIDRIVE\n\nArt Style: PiCTOBiTS\n\nArt Style: precipice\n\nArt Style: ZENGAGE\n\nAura-Aura Climber\n\nChronos Twins\n\nDark Void Zero\n\nDracula: Undead Awakening\n\nEscapee Go!\n\nFieldrunners\n\nFlipnote Studio\n\nFlipper\n\nGlobulos Party\n\nGlory Days: Tactical Defense\n\nGlow Artisan\n\nGO Series: 10-Second Run\n\nLooksley's Line Up\n\nMighty Flip Champs!\n\nNintendo DSi Browser\n\nNumber Battle\n\nPhoto Dojo\n\nPinball Pulse: The Ancients Beckon\n\nPop Island\n\nPop Island: Paperfield\n\nPop+ Solo\n\nPrimrose\n\nQuickPick Farmer\n\nRytmik\n\nRytmik: Rock Edition\n\nShantae: Risky's Revenge\n\nSpotto!\n\nStarship Defense\n\nSudoku\n\nTetris Party Live\n\nTrajectile\n\nX-Scape\n\n42 in all. I like most of them. And 0 DSi Points remaining, whoo!\n\nThe first 4 of these games I've downloaded 2 copies on both my DSi and my DSi XL because I play them so much. And the 3 after that I want to put on my XL, but just haven't done it yet.\n\nArt Academy 1\n\nArt Academy 2\n\nUno\n\nSuduko\n\nDr Mario\n\nAnimal Crossing Calculator\n\nAnimal Crossing Clock\n\nmyPostcards\n\nmyNotebook\n\nElectroplankton - Luminarrow\n\nDoDoGo\n\nNemrem\n\nPocketPack: Stategy Games\n\nSudoku 150\n\nCastle of Magic - deleted, didn't like it\n\nand one of those Brain Training games which I also deleted.\n\nThere are about 7 more games that I really want to download, but I've been waiting to see what I'll do about the 3DS. I can't decide if I'll sell my original DSi, and if I should get these games for the XL, or put them on the 3DS. I wish I could transfer them all to the XL.\n\nYeah, same here with joining for DSiWare reviews. If I didn't have a need to look up reviews, I wouldn't be a part of this site.\n\nyeah I bet you'd all like that\n\nAnyway, I have 31 total. See my backlog for exacts.\n\n38 in total. Here we go.\n\nArt Style: Aquia\n\nNintendo DSi Browser\n\nArt Style: Pictobits\n\nMighty Flip Champs!\n\nMario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!\n\nArt Style: Boxlife\n\nArt Style: Base 10\n\nArt Style: Zengage\n\nSudoku Student\n\nArt Style: precipice\n\nFlipNote Studio\n\nPop Plus: Solo\n\nPuzzle League Express\n\nPinball Pulse: The Ancients Beckon\n\nPicturebook Games: Royal Bluff\n\nArt Style: Digidrive\n\nCastle of Magic\n\nRayman\n\nPop Island\n\nTrajectile\n\nTouch Solitaire\n\nDark Void Zero\n\nEscapee GO!\n\nChronos Twins\n\nStarship Defense\n\nNumber Battle\n\nSpotto!\n\nAura-Aura Climber\n\nSave the Turtles\n\nPhoto Dojo\n\nLooksley's Line Up\n\nX-Scape\n\nA Kappa's Trail\n\nFace Pilot\n\nFlametail\n\nIvy the Kiwi? Mini\n\nDivergent Shift\n\nLink 'n' Launch\n\nI've enjoyed all but Sudoku Student and Rayman was too hard to complete. Currently playing Link 'n' Launch and Puzzle League Express, both of which are highly polished but tough games. I have beaten or completed all the games except the two mentioned above plus a few of the Art Style games."
