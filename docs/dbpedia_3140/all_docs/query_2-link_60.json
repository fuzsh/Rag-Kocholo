When you sign up to the forum, right at the top of the Registration Form it says:\n\nQUOTE said:\n\nWe do not host or serve roms\n\nThen it says:\n\nQUOTE said:\n\n* We DO NOT HOST or PROVIDE ROMs/WADs/ISOs; or link to websites that do contain ROMs/WADs/ISOs.\n\n* Members may NOT ASK and MAY NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION or LINKS for and to places that provide ROM, WAD, and ISO files.\n\n* Members may also NOT mention torrent or warez-containing sites or channels by name or otherwise.\n\n* We do not condone piracy in any way.\n\n* Please go elsewhere if you only wish to download or share illegal files. The GBAtemp Forums are for discussion ONLY.\n\nThen there is a box you have to tick, and next to the box it says:\n\nQUOTEI will not ask for roms or anything illegal, neither on the forums nor by private messages\n\nand then at the bottom of the page you HAVE to type in:\n\nQUOTE\n\nThere are no roms on GBAtemp\n\nYou can't say we haven't made it bloody clear enough.\n\nHolding the DS upsidedown can be a bit awkward, but just don't hold it by the topscreen since it's too flimsy. This is especially good as the game is not entirely touch-screen driven. But because it is a sports game, do expect some level of savage difficulty. Well, that is the trend with sports games at least, but the game doesn't seem very brutal when you start out, as long as you get over the learning curve. The music's nice, uses some guitars you don't get to hear much in quirky games like this that aren't just straight-up sports games. Don't worry, there's music in stages after the Animal Gym.\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward, using both the touch screen and the buttons. Use the touch screen to execute punches by tapping, sliding, and holding and tapping or sliding. Blocking is key, however, and you can hold X (now at the bottom) to put up your dukes. It seems to be a good idea to block very often and take on a patient tactic to await an opening when you can give your opponent a black eye or two. You can also dodge with the other buttons, which of course requires some quick observation. Oh, and yeah, don't worry about the Start button being up there, you can still Pause as normal. Use the touch screen to grab chili peppers to increase anger, which increases as you fight and lets you adopt a Fury stance for more powerful punches. Chili peppers burn Rommel's gut, he really wanted a cheeseburger and some french-fried potaters.\n\nThe customization on your character is pretty interesting, with a decent amount of variability and some interesting selections that can make your character nice to look at. Don't forget to double-tap selections to choose different colors, although this doesn't seem applicable to accessories. The models actually aren't too bad, considering what you might expect, the style is top-heavy. They didn't overlook tails; they seem to have made them really small. There does seem to be a tiny bit of latency between poking and waiting for the model to load in the menu here, but it's not a big deal. Plenty of unlockables gives you something to play for, though I really only noticed unlockables in the player customization with the belts you can win. The character design keeps your opponents interesting.\n\nChampionship mode contains your Tutorial dealy and all that, which explains the different moves you can make (it's more than just tapping on their face all the time!). You can pretty much pick up all you need from the Tutorial, like your punching moves and how to dodge when. Remember to stay observant; you need to be quick with your eyes as well as on your feet. Just don't let your distraction with puns like being a \"cat-tender-izer\" get in the way of victory. Just be warned that the Lightweight championship is a series of five opponents. This may seem a tad lengthy at times, but there's no quick-save between opponents.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty solid game, though it may have a bit of a weak redundancy rate because of the lack of music to listen to during the fights. Certainly worth a buy, even if you don't necessarily care for sports titles.\n\nYes, PETA won't like this game (see that Cooking Mama parody they did), but then they're the $cientology of animal rights groups, and give animal rights a bad name. Remember, do not punch your pets or animals at the zoo. Those animals do not want to be punched (and some may eat you). This is a \"VIDEO GAME\".\n\nThere seems to be a glitch with my character's hair for some reason. After fighting Chun, I somehow got hair that resembled her two-bun style, and when I went to change it my hair became wireframed instead of coloured. Odd.\n\nBIF!\n\nNekoblade said:\n\nFabis94 said:\n\nIf you can't get dumped games at GBAtemp why does it show the filesize and the file name?\n\nI mean maybe i missed something and you can download games from here...\n\nSuccessful troll is successful. 9/10\n\nGive him a break; you had people claiming this game was playable as soon as the thread was up when it wasn't available anywhere. It's not like anybody cares about the filesize and filename anyways since they usually have to be renamed and get included with spam.\n\nAnd besides, I don't see him actually asking for the game. Blows a gaping hole in your ass-umption there."
