        "text": "Not much going on this week with Indie and other games of interest. Must be the looming holiday coming up next week.\n\nHowever, there are still a few bits worth noting through the break, like the releases of The Marionette, Divinity II, and The Mystery of the Mary Celeste.\n\nClick onward.\n\nRock, Paper, Shotgun has posted impressions of King’s Bounty: Armored Princess, and it sounds like a fun time. Apparently, if you enjoy the game, you'll like the add-on. More through here.\n\nThere's a demo for Massive Assault Network 2, an online turn-based strategy game over on BigDownload. Here's the description: \"Massive Assault Network 2 is an online strategy game featuring sci-fi conflicts on distant planets. The game is based on the legendary Massive Assault series from which it inherits original 'Secret Allies' concept, streamlined turn-based gameplay, perfectly-balanced units, state-of-the- art interface and endless replayability.\" Try it out for yourself.\n\nDivinity II - Ego Draconis was released in the UK this week on PC and Xbox 360. According to the PR mail, the action RPG \"transports players back to the wide-open world of Rivellon, where they'll face the ultimate challenge of becoming a Dragon Knight\". It boasts 60 hours of gameplay, and the ability to play as either a knight or a dragon, where you must \"face your destiny and know that the choices you make will determine the gameplay and inevitably, your fate\". Cool.\n\nVector has announced a new browser-based RPG called The Seventh Dragon for PC and Mac, and it's expected to be released in December. The game is a \"persistent world simulation RPG set in the continent of Asan embroiled in global turmoil\", where players become Heroes, build cities, battle foes, and save the world from the \"conquering Devils\". Sounds like a normal Friday night after the bars close to us.\n\nA couple videos for the upcoming DSi release of Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ shows Little Red Riding Hood taking on Granny. The action rail shooter puts players in the role of the story book heroine as she kills zombies with high-powered guns and such.\n\nLuxor Adventures has landed on PC. This hidden-object adventure game follows \"a tale through time\" as players recover objects scattered throughout history, and is available now through MumboJumbo, retailers and digital distribution sites for $19.99.\n\nNew screens for The Mystery of the Mary Celeste on PC were released this week, alongside the game. In it, you're playing the ancestor of the person who found the abandoned ship, and it has you taking on the role of Mary Morehouse as she joins guests and crew of the Mary Celeste II on its maiden voyage. Shortly after the boat leaves the dock strange events start to happen and Mary must work to escape this ill fated ship. Screens through IGN.\n\nHooray! The Marionette has FINALLY been released! We played the demo over and over, ya know. In the 2D adventure game, you play a sculptor who receives a mysterious package, faints, and wakes up later outside a spooky house. Seriously. You have to try this out. You will enjoy it, and it's free. Thanks, Indiegames."
