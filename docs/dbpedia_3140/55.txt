EnjoyUp’s quirky run and gun game, Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ, is now available as a DSiWare download in Europe. Destineer published it here as a discount game by pricing it under $20. On DSiWare, Little Red Riding Hood’s Zombie BBQ is even cheaper at 800 DSiWare Points ($8). Although, it’s unclear if the DSiWare release is a full game or a trimmed down port. No word on a US release, but it’s not like Destineer has anything to localize!

Speaking of DSiWare, Digidrive is coming out next week in Japan. Q Games, the makers of Star Fox Command, created Digidrive as the final Bit Generations game for the GBA. In the game you’re like a traffic cop, directing colored arrows into groups which creates fuel to mover a wheel like core from being crushed. The 500 point DSiWare version adds touch screen controls and download play.
