        "text": "If having them pretend to be gay firefighters in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry wasn't enough funny for you, then you may be happy to know Adam Sandler and Kevin James are reuniting for another buddy comedy. Deadline reports the duo is likely to team-up for Valet Guys, a comedy which was just picked up by Sony Pictures Entertainment. Nick Bakay, a frequent James collaborator and the voice of Salem the cat on \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" is behind the pitch for the story which follows veteran valet parking guys at a South Beach hotel who witness a murder and find themselves running for their lives.\n\nReminds me of Some Like It Hot, but this will probably be more like Some Like It Unfunny. Of course, with big name, generically pleasing funny guys like James and Sandler aboard, the pitch went for a big pricetag. Bakay has been working with James since \"King of Queens\" and just recently wrote Zookeeper, and since that first trailer for the \"comedy\" almost made me throw up in my mouth, I'm not very optimistic about this one. I wish Sandler would make more films like Reign Over Me or Punch-Drunk Love, but James can just go park cars in real life for all I care. How about you?"
