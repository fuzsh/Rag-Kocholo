        "text": "CULVER CITY, Calif., May 17, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- In anticipation of the release of Columbia Pictures'/MGM's summer comedy Zookeeper on July 8, 2011, the studio has launched a new application themed to the movie in the App Store. The free Zookeeper application showcases a bright, colorful, interactive environment in which users can play up to four animal-themed casual games that take advantage of the unique capabilities of iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.\n\nThe app features games starring animal characters from the movie. Upon download, players can jump right into the action and progress as far as they can go in endless gameplay: get the monkey to collect bananas as he leaps through the branches; guide the giraffe to eat leaves on the trees before they fall to the ground; and keep the gorilla entranced with a swinging tire.\n\nThe United States version of the app also has a real world extension in which users may unlock an additional fourth game, featuring the Zookeeper elephant, by visiting a local participating zoo or aquarium (at http://www.aza.org/findzooaquarium/) accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. (The final game can also be unlocked by achieving the top rank in the other three games.)\n\nPlayers can also earn achievements and badges themed to each animal via Game Center and share their progress on Facebook. By achieving the top rank for the Monkey, Gorilla, and Giraffe games, users can also receive exclusive wallpapers for their device. The application will be offered worldwide and available in 12 different languages.\n\nCommenting on the announcement, Dwight Caines, president, Worldwide Digital Marketing, said, \"With the many unique and fun animal personalities in Zookeeper, it was a natural choice to extend the movie to an app for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. This app was inspired by the fun animals in the movie and includes games that will appeal to everyone.\"\n\nThe Zookeeper game is available from the App Store now.\n\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zookeeper/id434264236?mt=8\n\nAbout Zookeeper\n\nIn Zookeeper, the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo love their kindhearted caretaker, Griffin Keyes (Kevin James).

The animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored code of silence and reveal their biggest secret: they can talk! To keep Griffin from leaving, they decide to teach him the rules of courtship - animal style. The film also stars Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb and features the voices of Cher, Nick Nolte, Adam Sandler, and Sylvester Stallone. Directed by Frank Coraci. The screenplay is by Nick Bakay & Rock Reuben & Kevin James and Jay Scherick & David Ronn. Story by Jay Scherick & David Ronn.
