An enhanced glow to the torch symbolizes the celebration of a vibrant 100 years of Columbia Pictures’ rich history, which grew from humble beginnings to become one of the leading film studios, renowned for producing award-winning and trailblazing films that boldly reflected societal issues of the times. With the highest number of Academy Award Best Pictures wins, Columbia Pictures has entertained audiences for ten decades and continues to create cultural impact to this day.\n\n“There is one thing that separates a major studio from all other content producers: history. At Columbia, that history is reflected in the countless cultural talismans created by thousands of people over now 100 years. All of us at Columbia are proud of that legacy and honoured to celebrate it,” said Tom Rothman, Chairman & CEO of Sony Pictures’ Motion Picture Group.\n\nIn honour of the anniversary, luxury publisher Assouline will release a commemorative book highlighting 100 iconic moments of Columbia Pictures, and the studio will host festival screenings, live concerts of prominent film scores, and debut curated home entertainment products celebrating the scope of the studio’s library. Additional details regarding the 100 Year Anniversary celebration will be revealed throughout the year.\n\nColumbia Pictures was founded by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and best friend Joe Brandt on January 10, 1924.
