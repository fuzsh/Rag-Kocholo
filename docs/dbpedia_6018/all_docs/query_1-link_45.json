        "text": "MGM announced Sunday that Sony Pictures will handle global theatrical distribution for its upcoming Kevin James comedy “Zookeeper.”\n\nMGM will retain TV rights, with the two studios splitting profit across all platforms.\n\nDirected by Frank Coraci, the comedy is set to premiere Oct. 8. The film is co-produced by MGM and Sony, along with Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison and Broken Road Productions.\n\nWhile James plays the title role, Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Jon Favreau and Judd Apatow are among those voicing animals.\n\nMGM officials say the decision is not part of the ongoing financial re-organization of the cash-strapped studio."
