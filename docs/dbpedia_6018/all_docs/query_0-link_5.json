        "text": "In ZOOKEEPER, lead character Griffin Keyes, played by Kevin James, proposes to the beautiful girl of his dreams, Stephanie, just to be turned down because he’s a Zookeeper. Five years later, Griffin has become the lead Zookeeper, a status that usually takes longer to obtain. Griffin is the animal “whisperer. ” He lovingly takes care of all the animals, and helping to save many of the them with Kate, the zoo’s veterinarian.\n\nJust as Griffin is feeling wonderful about his position and the zoo, Stephanie comes back into Griffin’s life, and he once again falls in love with her. The animals listen to all this and decide to talk with Griffin about how to gain back the love of Stephanie.\n\nShocked by the talking animals, Griffin tries to run away from the Zoo, but the animals catch his attention and tell him the only way he’ll get Stephanie back is to listen to their advice. Knowing how nervous and awkward he gets around Stephanie, Griffin agrees he needs help from the animals. Once Griffin knows that the animals can speak, he becomes even closer to them, even befriending the huge gorilla, Bernie, who starts to consider Griffin his best friend.\n\nJust as Griffin is gaining confidence in getting Stephanie back, her ex-boyfriend, Gale, comes into the picture as Griffin’s rival. Working hard to regain the interest of Stephanie, Griffin awkwardly takes the animals’ advice, but to their chagrin, he also starts thinking about taking Stephanie’s advice to change his job. Meanwhile, Griffin’s coworker and friend, Kate, is gaining interest in him.\n\nZOOKEEPER is a typical Kevin James movie, where the main character awkwardly and clumsily tries to get the girl. Even though, audiences have seen this movie in different formats, ZOOKEEPER is comical and entertaining. Though there are plot flaws and the quality level is not extremely high, the audience is kept laughing.\n\nOverall, MOVIEGUIDE® advises caution for pre-teenagers regarding ZOOKEEPER. Parents should warn their children about equating animals with people, no matter how cute and lovable animals can be."
