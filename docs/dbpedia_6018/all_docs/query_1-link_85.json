        "text": "Sony Pictures has announced it is moving Kevin James-starrer Zookeeper from October 8 to July 8, 2011. That’s a week after Transformers 3 opens and a week before Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.\n\nThe studio says it recently held a test screening of Zookeeper which received positive feedback.\n\nIn the comedy, Kevin James plays Griffin Keyes, a kind-hearted zookeeper who is convinced the only way to get a girl in his life is to quit his job. The zoo animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored rule of not talking to humans and teach Griffin the ways of the wild so he can find a mate and stay at the zoo.\n\nDirected by Frank Coraci, the movie co-stars Rosario Dawson, Leslie Bibb, Adam Sandler, Cher, Jon Favreau, Sylvester Stallone, Judd Apatow, Jim Breuer, Faizon Love, Bas Rutten, Donnie Wahlberg and Ken Jeong."
