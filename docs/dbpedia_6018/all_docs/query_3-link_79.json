        "text": "Background\n\nOn May 6, 1974, Columbia Pictures reincorporated its Screen Gems division as Columbia Pictures Television. The name change was announced on May 1 and was suggested by David Gerber, who was president of Columbia's television division. In 1984, Coke demerged [[Columbia Pictures and Columbia Pictures Television. CPT was transferred to \"CPT Holdings, Inc.\". On January 30, 1984, CPT joined forces with Lexington Broadcast Services Company, Inc. (later known as LBS Communications, Inc.) and created Colex Enterprises to distribute series by Screen Gems and CPT from the 1950s to the 1970s. In October, CPT created \"The Television Program Source\" with Alan Bennett and former King World president Bob King.\n\nOn November 24, 1986, CPT was merged with Embassy Communications, forming Columbia/Embassy Television. This was also the birth of Coca-Cola Telecommunications, when CPT's distribution division merged with the Television Program Source. Coke also regrouped CPT, Embassy Communications, and Merv Griffin Enterprises into Coca-Cola Television. On December 21, 1987, Coke's entertainment business was sold to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. for $3.1 billion. Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. was renamed Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. (now \"Sony Pictures Entertainment\"), and CCT was shut down ten days later and folded into the reorganized Columbia Pictures Television Distribution.\n\nIn October 1991, CPT, TriStar Television, and MGE were reorganized into the Sony Pictures Entertainment Television Group (aka Sony Television Entertainment). On February 21, 1994, Columbia Pictures Television merged with TriStar Television by becoming Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television), and Columbia Pictures Television Distribution was renamed Columbia TriStar Television Distribution.\n\nOn January 1, 2001, Columbia Pictures Television was folded into Columbia TriStar Television to form Columbia TriStar Network Television, in a failed attempt to become a network television syndication division. However, CTNT's formation was blocked due to FCC-related television and syndication laws (also known as the \"Fin-Syn\" laws) prohibiting network participation in the financial interest of the television programs they aired beyond first-run exhibition and the creation of in-house syndication arms, especially in the domestic market. Another reason why CTNT's formation failed was due to its Japanese ownership (Sony). Ultimately, on October 25, 2001, CTNT was replaced by Columbia TriStar Domestic Television.\n\nThe CPT name was retained as an in-credit notice for The Young and the Restless until October 2002. As of July 2023, a separate entity of CPT continues to exist on paper as an intellectual property holder, and an in-name-only unit, known as CPT Holdings, Inc. (formed in 1983) to continue holding copyrights for such TV shows including The Young and the Restless and the UK version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as old incarnations from the company's television library such as What's Happening!!.\n\nCurrently, the division of what was known as Columbia Pictures Television is known today since September 16, 2002 as Sony Pictures Television.\n\n1st Logo (June 1974-July 30, 1977)\n\nVisuals: On a red background, the yellow letters \"C\", \"P\" and \"T\" appear one by one (syncing to the first three notes of the theme), zooming out. The \"T\" appears in the center, above \"C\" and \"P\", both of which slide upwards diagonally to merge with the \"T}\" to form a stylized logo, resembling a line combined with a rounded square, or a pretzel. On either side of the logo's stem are the words \"COLUMBIA\" and \"PICTURES\", and below that \"TELEVISION\". Underneath that is the byline \"A DIVISION OF COLUMBIA PICTURES INDUSTRIES, INC.\", all in a white bold Eurostile font.\n\nVariant: A stretched 16:9 variant exists. This variant is seen on current airings of some shows.\n\nTechnique: Possibly cel or motion-controlled animation.\n\nAudio: A slightly sped-up version of the 1970-1974 Screen Gems Television music, composed by Van Alexander and arranged by Eric Siday, and performed on a Moog modular synthesizer. Sometimes, the first three notes are played a bit more faster.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the TV movie The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case, the logo's theme is played on an organ and is also high-pitched.\n\nSometimes, the closing theme would play over it.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt appears on the DVD of the 1976 TV movie The Story of David with the closing music playing over it.\n\nThe first version can be seen on every episode of season 2 of Police Woman and Born Free on DVD, and was also spotted on an airing of Police Story on Black Starz! years ago. It also appeared on a 7mate airing of Police Woman in Australia as well as a Plus7 streaming print of the same episode.\n\nThe second version has only appeared on the TV movie The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case and is preserved on the VHS release and the DVD from Sony Pictures Choice Collection, as well as the CTV.ca print.\n\nIt was also seen on the two ABC comedy series Good Heavens! and That's My Mama, and the ABC drama series The Feather and Father Gang.\n\nThis was also reported to have appeared at the end of late '80s to early '90s reruns of Hart to Hart (replacing the 1982 logo).\n\nIts first appearance appears to have been on syndicated versions of 29 features from the Columbia Pictures library, including The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Professionals, Born Free, The Love Machine, and Easy Rider.\n\nThis is retained on Sony Movie Channel's airings of Cage Without a Key (as does Crackle's copy as well) and Banjo Hackett (while the DVD release of the latter has it plastered with a low pitched SPT logo).\n\n2nd Logo (September 21, 1976-September 28, 1982)\n\nVisuals: A light torch appears, as if in a sunburst, against a black screen and as it shrinks, it changes into a more \"abstract\" torch: an orange half circle, or a semicircle, with thirteen white light rays in the center and the words \"Columbia Pictures Television\" in a Souvenir font under it. The entire logo then slowly backs away as it fades out.\n\nTrivia:\n\nIt's essentially the second half of the 1976 Columbia Pictures logo, except the semicircle is orange, and the text \"Columbia Pictures Television\" appears under instead. The footage also seems to be played faster than the theatrical logo.\n\nDepending on the quality of the film print or telecine, the logo would appear slightly red. It should be noted that despite this, orange was the designated color for Columbia's television unit during this era.\n\nAccording to the book Screen Gems: A History of Columbia Pictures Television from Cohn to Coke, 1948-1983, by television historian Jeb H. Perry, this logo was described as \"a graphic representing the glow from The Lady's torch\".\n\nVariants:\n\nA B&W version exists.\n\nOn occasion, the glow around the sunburst varied in brightness or was not visible at all. This was generally the case during the 1980s on network TV.\n\nOn the Filthy Rich episode \"Town and Garden\", the animated sunburst appears chroma-keyed over the end-title scene as the show's closing theme plays over it.\n\nAn ultra dark version exists, where the text and semicircle are invisible and only the torch light remains barely visible. This can be seen on the Police Woman episode \"The Human Rights of Tiki Kim\". A similar variant with a brownish sunburst is rumored to have appeared on an episode of Fantasy Island.\n\nA nearly still version of this logo was seen on the failed TV pilot Johnny Garage. The logo slides down from the Sonny Grosso/Larry Jacobson Productions logo. The words \"In association with\" are seen above the sunburst in red, with the CPT name below the sunburst, also in red. The words are all in a thicker Souvenir font than what's seen on the animated logo.\n\nTechnique: Camera-controlled animation.\n\nAudio: A fast paced, redone version of the second half of the theatrical logo's music. Sometimes, it's the closing theme or none (the latter also occurs at the end of the final episode of Barney Miller, \"Landmark, Part 3\").\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, the theme plays at a lower pitch.\n\nSome syndicated broadcasts of this logo have a shorter version of the music, only playing the second half. This was due in part because of the splice edit method that was commonplace on early film prints of their shows.\n\nAvailability: Newer Columbia/Sony logos plaster this logo on almost all of the shows with this logo.\n\nIt appears with the show/movie's closing music playing over it on the VHS tape of the 1981 miniseries Family Reunion with Bette Davis, the 1982 TV movie Ivanhoe on DVD, the Vidmark VHS release, the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD release, the Sony Movie Channel broadcast and current prints of the 1982 Tom Selleck TV movie The Shadow Riders (its last known new appearance), and two post-1980 Barney Miller episodes: \"Homicide, Part I\" and \"Contempt, Part I\" on local syndication.\n\nIt appeared with music at the end of the 1977 TV movie A Killing Affair, but it has not been seen since Encore last aired it in 2006.\n\nIt was also seen on an international airing of Fantasy Island, followed by the 2002 Sony Pictures Television International logo.\n\nThe logo with the theme has been restored on the 2014 Mill Creek Entertainment DVD re-release of the first and second seasons of T.J. Hooker, and without the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo at all (the original Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 2005 release had the logo replaced with the 2002 SPT logo).\n\nThe logo appears silent at the end of the Barney Miller series finale \"Landmark, Part 3\" on the 2011 Shout! Factory complete DVD series set.\n\nThis logo can be seen on the Father Knows Best reunion special Home for Christmas, last seen on Laff, GetTV and Sony Movie Channel.\n\nIt also appears on seasons 3 and 4 of Police Woman.\n\nIt was also spotted on a Sony Movie Channel airing of Last of the Good Guys.\n\nThis appeared on The Making of The Deep when it was included on the Blu-ray release of The Deep.\n\nIt can be seen restored in high definition on Crackle's print of the 1978 TV movie More Than Friends.\n\nThis logo also appeared on the original airing of the 1980 failed pilot of Alone at Last on affiliate WMAQ.\n\nLegacy: This logo is a favorite among logo enthusiasts for its visual effects and music. The regular variant is also considered to be the first logo to ever be uploaded onto YouTube, uploaded sometime in March 2006 (although the original video appears to have been a deleted video).\n\n3rd Logo (September 24, 1982-June 18, 1993)\n\nVisuals: The then-current Columbia Pictures logo is shown, with the torch lady in her 1981-1993 incarnation. The words \"Columbia Pictures\" in Souvenir are seen on both sides of the torch lady, the word \"Television\" underneath in the same font. Most of the time, a company byline is seen below. The lady's torch \"shines\" throughout.\n\nFrom 1982-1989, a redrawn version of the 1982 theatrical logo was used, with the lady's robe being cream-colored.\n\nFrom 1989-1992, the actual 1982 theatrical logo was used. If one looks closely at the torch, the sunburst can be seen slowly dimming out. The word \"Television\" is still in the 1982 TV logo style, though recolored to match the Columbia Pictures text.\n\nBylines:\n\n1982-1989: \"A UNIT OF THE Coca-Cola COMPANY\"\n\nJanuary 2, 1988-1992: \"A unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc.\"\n\nSeptember 1991-1993: Bylineless\n\nVariants: There are several versions of this logo, namely in bylines, company name, and animation:\n\n1982-1989: There are blue clouds and a gold company name. The byline is the Coca-Cola one with \"Coca-Cola\" in its trademarked logo font. An early version has a much smaller Coke byline. Another version has a medium-sized byline. This was first used on Days of Our Lives and The Young and the Restless in late 1982 or early 1983. Prior to this, neither show used a Columbia or Screen Gems logo, with the exception of in-credit text on Days of Our Lives. A 16mm B/W copy of this variant was seen on a syndicated print of The Three Stooges short \"Boobs in Arms\", plastering the Screen Gems logo.\n\n1982-1988: There are dodger blue clouds and a gold company name. This version is bylineless. One of the shows to use the variant is the short-lived 1986 ABC series Starman. Another version features darker clouds.\n\n1983: There's an alternate gold company name with a medium-sized Coke byline.\n\n1985: It's just an alternate 1982 logo.\n\n1986: On the TV movie The Canterville Ghost, there is only a static image of the logo with the Coke byline.\n\n1986-1987: On the first season of The Real Ghostbusters when it aired on ABC, the first note of the CPT jingle would overlap with the final note of the show's ending theme. On the syndicated episodes, the ending theme would play in full, and the last few seconds of the CPT logo would be freeze-framed.\n\n1986-1988: There's a gold company name with a smaller Coca-Cola byline with \"Coca-Cola\" in its trademarked logo font.\n\n1986-1988: Again, the company name is gold, and this time there's a normal Coca-Cola byline with a dark and muddy Torch Lady. Also, it has very little shining animation.\n\nJanuary 2, 1988-1989: There are blue clouds and a gold company name. The Columbia Pictures Entertainment byline replaces the Coca-Cola byline. There was an early distribution logo used on Punky Brewster, which has this logo with \"Distributed by\" and the CPE byline in a plain font.\n\nJanuary 2, 1988-October 5, 1991: There are purple clouds and a gold company name. The CPE byline is shown (alternate 1988 network logo).\n\nJanuary 9, 1988-1989?: There are dodger blue clouds and a gold company name. The CPE byline is used (alternate 1988 logo, based on the 1982 bylineless logo).\n\nJanuary 1989-1992: There is a blue and ivory company name, as seen on the theatrical version. The CPE byline is used (network version, 1989; syndication prints have \"Distributed by\" on top). On some distribution variants, the sunburst fades in, rather than out. Although it stopped general use around September 1991, a few shows, such as the Married... with Children spin-off Vinnie & Bobby, used this until 1992.\n\nOn the TV movie Intrigue, the 1988 logo has a grey CPE byline.\n\n1989-1993: The text \"In Association With\" was added above the blue/ivory variant on reprints of Screen Gems shows. This followed the LBS Communications logo. From 1989-1991, the font was cheaply tacked in white with a black outline around it. This version looped part of the animation, causing the sunburst to fade out, then suddenly reappear. It would also fade in. On 1991-1993 episodes of Days of Our Lives, the logo used the IAW variant with the text in the Souvenir font.\n\nOctober 1991-1992: There is either a blue and gold or purple and gold company name with no byline. This was used during the early years of the company being owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nThere is an early version of the CPE byline where it's in all caps reading \"A UNIT OF COLUMBIA PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\" It was used on the 1988 TV movie, Badlands 2005.\n\nOpen matte versions of the 1989 and 1991 logos exist, revealing more of the Torch Lady's pedestal. The 1989 version is seen on Dark Avenger (1990) and Hardball (the latter has the phrase \"In Association With\" appearing below it), while the 1991 version is seen on Christmas on Division Street. On the 1989 version, the text looks bronze rather than gold. Another version, seen on part one of Switched at Birth, Cast the First Stone, and a few episodes of the 1989 CBS drama series A Peaceable Kingdom have no black under the pedestal. The 1989 open-matte version was exclusive to TV movies and drama shows, barring soap operas.\n\nSeptember 1991-June 18, 1993: There is a blue and ivory company name with no byline (network version; syndication prints from 1991-1992 have \"Distributed by\" on top).\n\nThere is also a B&W version of the logo on classic Columbia movies in B&W. It was also used to plaster Screen Gems logos on reprints of their shows.\n\nThere is a short version of the 1982 logo.\n\nAnother version of the 1991 logo exists where you can see a few extra steps in the pedestal, but is not a full open matte logo, like the Christmas on Division Street version. This is seen on Revolver.\n\nA version of the 1982 logo has the logo shifted up, revealing the whole pedestal. This was spotted in the 1985 miniseries Robert Kennedy and His Times.\n\nThe 1992 TV documentary Titanic: Treasure of the Deep has the 1991 logo fading in.\n\nA fade in variant of the 1989 logo exists, which was spotted on the 1989 TV pilot Shivers, which aired as part of the CBS Summer Playhouse.\n\nTechnique: Motion-controlled effects for the torch shine and text, while the Torch Lady and backdrop are a matte painting.\n\nAudio:\n\n1982-1989: A shortened, slightly higher pitched version of the Sunburst music by Suzanne Ciani. The 1976 version was also used on this logo for a long version.\n\nJanuary 4, 1988-1993: A six-note synthesized brass jingle (mixed with twinkles) that sounds like a triumphant superhero theme. Composed by Timothy Thompson on a Roland D50.\n\nSometimes, the closing theme or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the Married... with Children episode \"A Man's Castle\" as seen on The Most Outrageous Episodes: Volume 2 DVD, the 1993 music from the 4th logo is heard.\n\nA warped version with Thompson's music was heard on '80s prints of Screen Gems shows (such as Occasional Wife), where the 1988 theme is in a slightly high pitch.\n\nA slowed down version with Thompson's music also exists on the 1988 and 1991 logos. The 1988 logo was seen on the second episode of The Real Ghostbusters, part of the Ghostbusters/Ghostbusters II DVD set, while the 1991 logo is seen on the 25 December 1991 episode of The Young and the Restless. The 1988 theme also sounds much slower.\n\nOn the season 4 DVD set of Punky Brewster, at the end of the episode, \"The Nun's Story\", the short 1995 Columbia TriStar Television Distribution theme is used on the 1982 CPT logo.\n\nOn a couple episodes of My Two Dads on the S1 DVD set, it had the first two notes of the 1988 fanfare gone: the music fades in at the third note. This also appeared on the original NBC broadcasts.\n\nOn Switched at Birth and on several episodes of Designing Women, the 1988 theme reverbs for a long time after the logo fades out.\n\nOn the 1988 TV movie Intrigue, the 1988 CPT theme is in a lower pitch.\n\nOn the first three episodes of A Peaceable Kingdom, the logo fades out halfway before the theme finishes. On the first episode, the theme fades out on the 6th and final note; on the second episode, the theme out on the 4th note (though a little bit of the 5th note can be still heard); on the third episode, the theme fades out on the 6th note (though a little bit of of the 1988 fanfare can be still heard before it fades completely).\n\nSome Screen Gems programs had the \"S from Hell\" logo sloppily plastered with this logo in the early/mid '80s, in a way that the first two-three notes of the SG jingle would be heard, then the Ciani music would be heard starting in mid-jingle. One example of this would appear on '80s reruns of The Farmer's Daughter. Allegedly, during this same period, the logo would also plaster Screen Gems logos with the original music still intact.\n\nOn a rerun of a Diff'rent Strokes episode on Antenna TV, the theme from the Embassy Communications logo can be heard, due to bad plastering.\n\nFrench airings of T.J. Hooker on the French Belgium channel \"La Une\" have the widescreen 1982 logo with the 1993 CPT theme.\n\nOn a French print of a season 1 episode of Silver Spoons, the 1988 CPT logo theme can be faintly heard when it's in low volume.\n\nOn one print and also on German dubs of The Real Ghostbusters, the 2002 SPT theme is heard over the logo, due to a reverse plastering error.\n\nOn the 1980s airing of Huckleberry Hound, the first two notes of the Screen Gems \"S from Hell\" theme is heard before cutting to the 1982 theme.\n\nOn one airing of Occasional Wife, the first note of the Screen Gems \"S from Hell\" theme is heard before cutting to the 1988 theme.\n\nOn a December 1992 USA Cartoon Express rerun of The Real Ghostbusters S1 episode “Xmas Marks the Spot”, the 1989 variant has the 1982 theme due to a reverse plastering error.\n\nAvailability: Newer Columbia/Sony logos plaster most of these logos (likely due to the Coca-Cola byline used for much of the logo's run). Despite this, it appeared on some older prints of shows.\n\nIt was previously found on some episodes of Designing Women on TV Guide Network (now Pop).\n\nIt was also spotted when Chiller aired reruns of the series Werewolf.\n\nComedy Central's print of the movie Hairspray (1988) used the 7th variation listed in the opening (w/the '88-'93 jingle).\n\nLocal reruns would have the 1988 Distribution logo on several Good Times episodes, which would also appear on S1 on DVD and on Antenna TV, followed by the 2002 SPT logo.\n\nThis can also be seen at the beginning of Village of the Giants (an Embassy Pictures release) when it was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 as Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo were entering the theatre.\n\nThe 1982 logo appears on DVD in many places: the 1982 mini-series The Blue and the Gray, the 1985 version of Alice in Wonderland, several S2 episodes of Fantasy Island on DVD released from Shout! Factory, with music on most episodes on the season 4 DVD release of Punky Brewster from Shout! Factory and on Peacock, and without music (also plastering the Paramount logo) on a 1994 U.S. VHS release of Road to Bali from Video Treasures.\n\nA 16mm B/W copy of this logo exists, which was seen on some syndicated prints of The Three Stooges short \"Boobs in Arms\", replacing the Screen Gems logo.\n\nThe B&W variant of the 1982 logo can be seen on some episodes of The Donna Reed Show on Me-TV, and some movies on Antenna TV including Last Train from Bombay; the B&W variant of the 1988 logo can be seen at the end of all episodes on the Bewitched VHS release titled \"Love That Witch\".\n\nThe B&W 1982 Coca-Cola byline variant can also be seen on select reruns - mostly from season 2 - of Naked City on both Tubi and (as of this posting) Retro TV's daytime schedule. This variant usually plasters the original Screen Gems \"Torch Lady\" logo during the announcement by Harry Cohn; as a result, the Columbia Pictures Television logo fades out sooner and the remaining theme music is heard for about 5 seconds after fading out.\n\nThe 1988, 1989, and 1991 logos can be found on both volumes of the Married... with Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes DVD.\n\nThe 1989 logo also appears on the 1991 U.S. VHS release of All in the Family: 20th Anniversary Special, Switched at Birth, Cast the First Stone and Guilty of Innocence: The Lenell Geter Story (which plasters the Embassy logo).\n\nThe 1988 and 1989 logos can also be seen on plenty of S1 and S2 My Two Dads episodes on the Shout! Factory DVD release under Sony Pictures Home Entertainment's license.\n\nThe 1988 logo was also seen on a majority of 1980 episodes of Barney Miller when it last aired on WGN America (now NewsNation) and mostly on local syndication, including a vast number of the then-remastered Three Stooges shorts on local stations.\n\nThe 1988 logo was also seen on the VHS releases of Weekend War and Intrigue.\n\nThe 1988 logo also makes an appearance at the start of a Columbia TriStar Home Video release of The Karate Kid Part II.\n\nThe 1982 CPT logo can also be found on some S1 episodes of Designing Women on DVD.\n\nThe 1988, 1989, and 1991 CPT logos also appear on plenty of episodes from seasons 1-6 DVD releases (and Tubi prints) of Designing Women.\n\nThe 1991 blue/ivory open matte logo was spotted on Christmas on Division Street, which can be found on the UK VHS release from Odyssey Video, and is also retained on Crackle's print.\n\nThe bylineless 1982 version was also spotted on an episode of T.J. Hooker that aired on Australian digital Channel 7mate and was also seen on the now defunct Cloo, Universal HD, and the French Belgium channel \"La Une\" (in a widescreen variant and with the 1993 CPT theme on the latter channel).\n\nIt was also added to all second season episodes of that show on the 2014 Mill Creek Entertainment DVD reissue of the first and second seasons (the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo replaced the logo on the 2005 DVD release), and is also on all 22 episodes on the season 4 (1982-83) release of Hart to Hart from Shout! Factory.\n\nThis logo was also seen on a few episodes of some existing syndicated prints of season 1 episodes of That's My Mama!, plastering the original \"Pretzel\" logo.\n\nThe Revolver variant can be found on the VHS release of said title and appears on the Sony Movie Channel's airing of said movie. It may also appear on the Sony Pictures Choice Collection DVD-R as well.\n\nThe bylineless gold version is also retained at the start of The Producers on This TV (but not on Get TV), and TCM airings of the films The Oscar and Tyrant of Lydia Against the Son of Hercules.\n\nIt was also spotted on a Movies! airing of Hercules and the Princess of Troy, a 1993 Family Channel (now Freeform) airing of the original 1982 Annie, as well as old cable prints of Winter Kills, Stripes and Maximum Overdrive (including a TNT broadcast), replacing the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) logo.\n\nThe 1988 CPTD logo was also seen on one episode of The Burns & Allen Show, as well as the Diff'rent Strokes episode \"The Moonlighter\" both on Antenna TV.\n\nThe 1991 logo is also retained on the VHS release of Titanic: Treasure of the Deep.\n\nThe \"Distributed by\" variant can be found on the Dutch Arrow Film VHS release of Dark Avenger.\n\nHowever, the Amazon Prime print of the latter movie has the 2003 Sony Pictures Television International logo instead.\n\nThis logo, with the CPE byline, can be seen on the first season and the first few episodes of the second season of Parker Lewis Can't Lose on FamilyNet and Crackle, while later second season episodes and early third season episodes use the bylineless version. Later third season episodes use the next logo.\n\nThe bylineless, open-matte version of the 1982 logo is also seen on several T.J. Hooker episodes on Crackle.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a December 2000 Sci-Fi Channel (now Syfy) broadcast of The Hidden.\n\nThe 1991 logo is also retained on the Sony Movie Channel broadcast and the Sony Pictures Choice Collection DVD-R release of The Whereabouts of Jenny.\n\nHowever a True Movies 1 airing in the UK used the 2003 Sony Pictures Television International logo instead.\n\nThe 1982 bylineless version plasters the original 1991 logo (while retaining the ending theme) on Sony Movie Channel broadcasts and the CTV.ca print of I Still Dream of Jeannie.\n\nThe bylineless 1991 logo also appeared at the beginning of a 5Spike (now Paramount Network) airing of The Bounty Killer.\n\nIt also appeared at the end of the Amazon Prime print of Silent Cries, following the TriStar Television logo.\n\nIt also appeared on Decades airings of some Riptide episodes, which aired as part of their weekend binge.\n\nThe 1989 and 1991 variants were also spotted on many later-season episodes of Who's the Boss? on GAC Family, followed by the 2002 SPT logo.\n\nThe 1988 network variant plasters the 1987 prototype New Line Cinema logo on television broadcasts of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.\n\nThe 1989 variant was also seen at the end of a July 1993 airing of the 1991 TV movie And the Sea Will Tell on ITV.\n\n4th Logo (August 15, 1992-May 19, 2001)\n\nVisuals: There is a picture of a brand new Columbia Torch Lady, holding a light torch on top of a new pedestal against a cloud background with a blue sky around it. The word \"COLUMBIA\" appears in giant, chiseled silver letters behind her at the very top, similar to the classic Columbia Pictures logo from 1936-1976. Underneath the lady are the words \"COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION\", or until 1996, \"COLUMBIA PICTURES TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" (in the Bank Gothic Condensed Bold font), and underneath that is the byline \"a SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT company\". When the music is finished, the logo fades out, but the name and the byline stay on-screen for a split second longer before fading out.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe original artwork was created by Michael J. Deas and modeled by Louisiana homemaker Jenny Joseph, and made its on-screen debut starting with this logo, about a year before a film version debuted.\n\nA textless version, along with the Merv Griffin Enterprises and TriStar Television logos, was shown as a Video Daily Double clue under the \"Horses\" category for $500 in the December 22, 1993 episode of Jeopardy!, as shown here: \"This is the Merv Griffin logo, this is the Columbia logo, and the following is this company's\". Dave Dixon, who found that Daily Double, wagered $700 of his $1,300 and gave the correct response, \"What is TriStar?\", increasing his score to $2,000 and taking the lead. Dixon was eventually beaten by fellow contestant Jean Grewe, who became a three-day champion with $29,901 on hand, adding $4,000 to his $25,901 that he won in the previous two days.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a black-and-white variation that was used to plaster Screen Gems logos on their shows.\n\nOn the TV pilot movie of Dark Skies known as \"The Awakening\", the name and the byline fade out at the same time as the logo.\n\nAn open-matte version can be seen on the Parker Lewis Can't Lose season 3 episodes, \"Beauty and the Kube\" and \"Hungry Heart\".\n\nOn Beakman's World, a CGI toy rocket flies around the Torch Lady.\n\nA rare 1.37:1 \"academy\" version exists.\n\nTechnique: A still image of a painting.\n\nAudio: Here are the main versions:\n\n1992-December 31, 1993: The 1988 music from the 4th logo. Days of Our Lives and The Young and the Restless used this starting around April or May 1993, and used it until New Year's Eve 1993.\n\nSeptember 1993-2001: A 6-note majestic tune is heard, full of brass instruments; composed by Dave Grusin.\n\n1993-2001: A re-composition of the 1993 theme that's slightly re-arranged.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, the ending theme of the show plays over it. Otherwise, none.\n\nNBC and CBS airings would have their generic themes playing over it, starting in 1994.\n\nOn The Greatest '70s Cop Shows DVD, the short 1995 Columbia TriStar Television Distribution theme was heard on the pilot of Police Woman (this can also be heard on Gidget Grows Up), and the long Columbia TriStar Television Distribution theme was heard on the pilot of Starsky & Hutch. This was likely due to being a rushed job, resulting in bad plastering. The short CTTD theme is also heard on the first episode of the Mike Hammer TV series, The Jeff Foxworthy Show on TBS, The Dana Carvey Show episode \"The Mug Root Beer Dana Carvey Show\" on DVD, and episode 5 of season 1 of The New Gidget on CTV Throwback (plastering the 1982 variant of the 4th logo).\n\nOn early to mid '90s reruns of the short-lived series Ivanhoe, the second half of the theme is used.\n\nOn syndicated reruns of the Early Edition episode \"Red Fellas\", the 1993 TriStar Television logo music is heard due to sloppy reverse plastering.\n\nThe CPTD version of the logo sometimes used a warped version of the 1993 theme. This was a little strange to hear it be used with the CPT version of the logo on older prints of selected episodes of Charlie's Angels, possibly due to plastering over the older logos.\n\nOn the series Dark Skies starting on episode 2, older prints of some episodes of Charlie's Angels, and the 1996 TV movie Sudden Terror: The Hijacking of Bus #17, the 1995 Columbia TriStar Television theme is used.\n\nOn the Charlie's Angels episode \"Night of the Strangler\" on the season 1 DVD release, the final note of the 1993 CPT theme has a reverb effect to it.\n\nThe 1987 Coca-Cola Telecommunications theme is heard on some episodes of The Real Ghostbusters due to bad plastering. This includes a DVD print of the episode \"Captain Steel Saves the Day\" and MeTV Toons' print of the episode \"Janine's Genie.\"\n\nOn early season 1 episodes of Beakman's World, the 1988 theme is somewhat distorted by the toy rocket's noises. Later season 1 episodes only have the rocket noises playing without the theme. Starting with the second season, the 1993 theme would be heard over the logo.\n\nOn a French television broadcast of the 1993 TV movie Baby Brokers, the 2003 Sony Pictures Television International theme is heard. This is probably due to the fact that the network used an HD print with the audio of an older printing featuring the SPTI logo. This also happens on an episode of The Real Ghostbusters included on a Greek three-episode VHS compilation released by Prooptiki and Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.\n\nOn some Spring 2020 reruns of The Young and the Restless episodes on CBS, the 1976 theme can be heard due to bad plastering.\n\nLike the previous logo, on one print and also on the German dubs of The Real Ghostbusters, the 2002 SPT theme is heard, again, due to a reverse plastering error.\n\nOn a 2006 Channel 5 UK airing of the 1976 TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, the first three notes of the 1976 theme from the 2nd and 3rd logos in PAL pitched tone playing faintly in the background over a black screen before the correct 1993 theme in NTSC pitched tone appears, due to plastering over the older logo.\n\nAvailability: It has managed to pop up on several current prints of Sony series and movies even with the Sony Pictures Television logo plastering over logos.\n\nDays of Our Lives and The Young and the Restless did not begin using this logo until 1993.\n\nOn local stations, this logo been spotted on a majority of Good Times reruns.\n\nThe CPTD logo can also be found on some movies on TCM, the season 5 Good Times episode \"The Evans Get Involved: Part I\" on TV One, the end of the original version of The Producers on This TV, at the beginning of Nevada Smith and An Eye for an Eye (1981) on getTV, and the season 2 Silver Spoons episode \"Mr. President\" on Antenna TV.\n\nThe B&W version of this logo was seen on on '90s prints of I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched; it was also spotted at the beginning of the 1965 film Darling on TCM and some episodes of Dennis the Menace on Hulu (plastering the 1955 and 1960 Screen Gems logos). It can also be seen at the close of select episodes of Naked City on Tubi and Retro TV (see above), and at the end of the final season episodes of Route 66, following the Screen Gems \"dancing sticks\" logo, on Retro TV's daytime schedule (again, as of this posting). It was also spotted on older reruns of the short-lived Ivanhoe on Arte.\n\nThis logo can be seen on S1 DVD releases of All in the Family, Good Times, The Jeffersons, Charlie's Angels, and Sanford and Son.\n\nThis logo is also seen on DVD volume releases of The Real Ghostbusters, released by Sony in 2005.\n\nIt is also seen on volume 1 of Married... with Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes and The Greatest '70s Cop Shows on DVD.\n\nThe version with the 1988 music can be found on the VHS release of Married... with Children: It's a Bundyful Life, The Best of Beakman's World (the variant with the rocket) on VHS and DVD, at the start of a 1993 Columbia House VHS release of Bewitched called \"Love That Witch\", and on most episodes of the final season of Designing Women on DVD (a handful of episodes have the 1993 version and the series finale \"Gone with a Whim\" has the 2002 SPT logo).\n\nIt is also preserved at the end of The Partridge Family: C'mon Get Happy! on VHS; it's also likely preserved on other VHS releases in the 'TV Screen Gems' series. Weirdly on some episodes of Bewitched, the 1993 CPT logo is also seen between with the 1965 Screen Gems logo and the 2002 Sony Pictures Television logo.\n\nThe 1993 CPT logo is also seen at the end of the 1996 Columbia House VHS release of The Craft.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of The Graduate on Antenna TV and This TV.\n\nThe 1993 CPT logo is preserved intact on several season 5 episodes of Barney Miller on the Shout! Factory DVD set, following the Four D Productions logo.\n\nThis logo was also spotted on an airing of Just You and Me, Kid on Antenna TV, plastering the first few seconds of the 1976 Columbia film logo.\n\nIt was also spotted on some episodes of The Jeff Foxworthy Show on TBS, not falling victim to TBS's style of split-screen credits, and is also intact on the 2015 Complete Series DVD release from Mill Creek Entertainment and on most episodes on Crackle.\n\nThis was also seen at the beginning of an airing of The Natural on Antenna TV and This TV.\n\nA handful of episodes of The Jeffersons have this logo on the 2014 Mill Creek Entertainment release of season 2, with both 1988 and 1993 music.\n\nThis logo was also seen at the beginning of an airing of Moscow on the Hudson on This TV.\n\nIt can also be seen on Crackle prints of episodes of The Steve Harvey Show, The Critic, and season 3 of The Real Ghostbusters.\n\nThe 1993 CPT logo is also seen on reruns of Walker: Texas Ranger on ONE in Australia with the closing theme playing over it.\n\nIt is also retained on its DVD releases of seasons 1-3 (including the 1995 and 2000 VHS releases from Warner Home Video and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) but later seasons plaster this logo in favor of the CBS Paramount Network Television \"Wallpaper\" logo on season 4 and the CBS Television Distribution logo on seasons 5-7.\n\nThis logo was also seen on Spring 2020 Flashback Friday reruns of The Young and the Restless on CBS, with the 1976, 1988 and 1993 music.\n\nThis logo was also seen at the start of TCM's print of the Rankin/Bass Productions film The Daydreamer (possibly due to being sourced from an earlier television print, as Sony holds the TV rights via Embassy Pictures).\n\nThis logo was also spotted on a 2000 syndicated print of the TV movie Rapture, where it appeared before the Columbia TriStar Television Distribution logo (and with both logos replacing the TriStar Television logo that was originally used on this film).\n\nThis logo plasters the TriStar Television logo on Amazon Prime's print of Fugitive Nights: Danger in the Desert.\n\nThe CPTD logo can be currently seen on reruns of the original Fantasy Island on getTV.\n\nThe 1993 CPT logo is also seen at the end of a Crackle streaming service print of the Jeannie episodes \"Surf's Up\" and a CTV Throwback streaming print of the aforementioned show's episode \"The Great Ski Robbery\", following the bylineless version of the 1968 H-B \"Zooming H-B\" logo.\n\nThis logo follows the 1996 PBS logo on commercial prints of Cadillac Desert.\n\nThe 1992 and 1993 CPT logos were spotted on The Real Ghostbusters on MeTV Toons, following the short 1987 DIC logo.\n\nCopyright stamps\n\nHere is some information about the copyright stamps on the Columbia Pictures Television shows and TV movies:\n\n1974-1984: Copyright © (year) by Columbia Pictures Television, A division of Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\n\n1982-1986: Copyright © (year) by Rastar Television, Inc.
