        "text": "I love to watch movies and no one can deny the cultural importance of films on our society. The Academy Awards, more popularly known as the Oscars, is one of the greatest events of the year, where people who work in the cinematography industry receive an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements. I was taken completely by surprise when I read that Netflix received twenty-four nominations for the Oscar of 2020. Is it paradigm shift happen on the movies universe? Tough to watch movies is a great pleasure for me, I wouldn't be able to comment from a cinema critic's perspective . Nevertheless, as a Data Scientist I am capable to detect, or at least to measure, patterns and changes that are ongoing on that entertainment field.\n\nOn this day and age, new technologies are revolutionizing the our lives, work and play. So, my intention it will be to apply descriptive analysis to detect new trends of cinema and describe some existing relationships. The data set used was collected from Kaggle and assemble by TMDB and GroupLens. The sample of movies are too extensive to be entire analysed and mostly would carry vices that are not desirable. Due to that fact, I restricted my analysis about movies those were made on this century, from 01-01-2000 to 01-01-2017 (my film data set only reach till 2017) .\n\nWhen I was a Economic student, I learnt the concept of Learning Curve. According with the idea, cumulative experience in the production of a product over time increases efficiency. It seems interesting to look at the overall geographical distribution of movies made per country on the 21st century.\n\nAs expected movies companies from United States have the largest production of movies of this century, approximately 80.000 films. Without doubt American movies has a long tradition on cinema. Yet, it is impressive to see that studios from South Korea are in the 8th position and studios from Russia are in the 9th position, since their movies are not often seen in the west side of the world. In the Oscar Nominations 2020, South Korean film Parasite has been named best picture endorsing the emergence of their films industry in the world scenario. It drew my attention to see the amount of movies that American companies do with British and Canada films studios, however makes sense to me once those countries speak the same language and enable them to produce films in the same language.\n\nCarrying out my research, I want to understand better who are the studios in the market creating movies. Given that most of the movies are produced on USA I can guess that the majority of them belongs to that country. However, interesting things can happen when we look the frame closer. Therefore I split the production companies information in two periods, one from 2000 to 2017 and other from 2010 to 2017.\n\nWord Cloud is one of my favorite kind of graphs, they are simple and intuitive and frequently useful. Looking into that graph I could say that we are playing a version of seven errors game, in both graphs is possible to see studios as Warner Bros, Universal Pictures,Walt Disney or Columbia pictures, some of the most traditional films companies. However, did you notice something different in the second graph? Yes, there is Netflix appearing above the \"Production\" word. Netflix is a streaming service company and their movies are not release on the movie theater, turning the fact of the amount of movies produced by them very interesting. There is no doubt that changes are happening and that traditional films companies are facing a new kind of business emerging.\n\nSounds interesting to analyse the vote performance of the studios, at least to check what are their average grades with the public.\n\nIt was not possible to plot all the studios. Therefore, I selected ten movies companies those were considered relevant for me. Curiously Amazon Studios and Netflix appear ahead of traditional companies as Columbia Pictures, Warner Bros and Universal Studios. It is important to note that the average is strongly affected for outliers, and may cause some misunderstandings. Also, most streaming services film companies produce less movies than the others companies and their sample is relative small when comparing to the traditional companies what may help their average to be superior to others companies. However, it is conceivable that their movie production quality has been superior indeed, as I said before Netflix got 24 nominations in the last Oscar.\n\nSo far, it was possible to glean that most of the films come from United States and Netflix is a great trend company in the movie market. Now, it is time to analysis what genres are being produces to the public.\n\nDrama (21,9%) is the gender more often produced in the cinematography industry in the 21st century, then in the sequence there are Comedy, Thriller, Action and Romance. I guess that the decisions of the studios about what genre movie to filming are motivated by popularity. Here I need to be very careful because few genres may be overestimates due to variables as director, cast or budget. My role as Data Scientist is to understand what happen in the central tendency and not in individually for each situation. Nevertheless, the average here may be biased. To turn the situation around, I will analysis the median of each genres through a box-plot.\n\nThe popularity between genre movies can vary a lot among genres. Due to that fact, I applied a variable transformation on popularity because there are strong outliers in my data set and the using log function it is possible to reduce the variances among my data without change their distribution. Checking the medians of the categories it is possible to see that three of them stands out: Foreign, Documentary and Music. Explanations for those lower medians can be many, probably Foreign movies naturally enforce a language obstacle and maybe Documentaries trend to attend a more select public. Even the outliers of those categories stands out lower than the outliers for the others categories.\n\nLast but not least, lets see how are related the finance variables of the data set. Is it possible that expensive movies show better performances across the public? Lets plot a correlation map to find that answer.\n\nRevenue and budget have a strong relationship, once more expensive movies trend to be watch for more people. Actually, movies with a big budget need to achieve an economy scale to become viable their production. Cause a stir to see that budget has a strong relationship if vote counts, probably because movies with great budget are more seen than movies if lower budget. Nevertheless, expensive movies does not mean that they are popular as long as their relationship is weak. Even profitable movies are not correlated with popular movies. It helps to explain why blockbuster are not often the winners of best picture.\n\nThus, it is possible to conclude couple things about the film industry. No doubt that United States has the greatest part of the market. Yet, other countries show a good performance such as South Korea that have a language obstacle but is being recognized abroad. Netflix is a strong trend to cinema, not only because their innovative way to present their movies to the public but also for their popularity among the people. Indeed revenue, one measurement related to the traditional movie companies, and is not measured for streaming movie companies, has not huge impact on popularity of the movies what increase the perception of changes in our times. At some point, cinema replaced theater as the main entertainment medium for the public. I have no doubt that entertainment is undergoing changes and streaming companies seem to be one of the proponents of this change."
