        "text": "Blu-ray Sales: Green Lantern can't Dethrone Lion King\n\nOctober 26th, 2011\n\nDespite the presence of four new releases in the top ten on the Blu-ray sales chart, none were able to overtake The Lion King for top spot. It sold an additional 496,000 units generating $12.39 million for totals of 2.03 million units / $57.86 million after two weeks of release. More...\n\nDVD Sales: The Top of the Chart Looks Quite Horrible\n\nOctober 25th, 2011\n\nThe top of the DVD sales chart was the weakest its been in more than a month and no new release was able to top 500,000 units sold. Horrible Bosses came the closest with 451,000 units / $6.89 million. More...\n\nDVD and Blu-ray Releases for October 11th, 2011\n\nOctober 12th, 2011\n\nIt's not a particularly strong week on the home market. The biggest first run release coming out this week is Horrible Bosses, which was a surprise $100 million hit. Green Lantern will likely be the best selling release of the week, but it disappointed with critics and at the box office. As far as the best of the best goes, The Tree of Life Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack is the best bet as far as Pick of the Week goes, bu there are a few others that are worth picking up. There are also a couple of late arrivals that deserve honorable mentions this week: Castle: Season Three and Dumbo - Blu-ray Combo Pack. More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Harry Potter Breathes Life Into the Box Office\n\nJuly 19th, 2011\n\nAfter a weak start, 2011 started to improve in late April. However, by June it had all fallen apart again and it looked like the summer of 2011 would be even worse than the summer of 2010, which was the worst summer in a decade. Thank goodness Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 came along. That film made more than the entire box office did last weekend and came within $10 million of doing the same in comparison to last year. It helped the overall box office reach $262 million, or 68% more than last weekend and 47% more than the same weekend last year. 2011 is still off 2010's pace by more than 7% at $5.85 billion to $6.30 million, but at least there's some hope for the near future. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will Harry Potter Go Out on Top?\n\nJuly 14th, 2011\n\nThis week is all about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2, although I know at least a couple of people who are more interested in seeing Winnie the Pooh. Potter will dominate the box office in a way rarely seen and help boost overall box office substantially. In fact, there is a chance it will make more than the entire top ten did the same weekend last year. As long as it doesn't miss low end expectations, it should help give 2011 a much needed win.

More...\n\nWeekend Wrap-Up: Transformers Lights Up the Competition, Box Office Remains Dark\n\nJuly 11th, 2011\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon led the way for the second weekend in a row and overall the top five films were a little stronger than expected, but sadly that wasn't enough for 2011 to score a win. It didn't even come close. The overall box office was just $156 million, which was 23% lower than last weekend, but the post-holiday slump mostly explains that. However, it was 19% lower than the same weekend last year and there's no excuse for that. The bad news continues as 2011 has fallen more than $500 million behind 2010's pace, while attendance is just down close to 10%. Unless Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is an exceptional hit at the box office, the summer of 2011 could have the worst ticket sales in more than a decade. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates: Transformers Unbeaten by Zookeeper, Horrible Bosses\n\nJuly 10th, 2011\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon became the highest-grossing movie of the year so far, according to Paramount's Sunday estimate. Its total gross of $261 million is a comfortable $11 million ahead of The Hangover 2, which itself passed $250 million this weekend. While it couldn't come close to topping the chart, Horrible Bosses had a good weekend, earning a shade over $28 million and beating Zookeeper for 2nd place. The Kevin James comedy, meanwhile, posted a decent $21 million. More...\n\nWeekend Predictions: Will There Be Any Change on Top?\n\nJuly 7th, 2011\n\nWhile there are two wide releases coming out this week, it seems unlikely that either of them will seriously challenge Transformers: Dark of the Moon for top spot at the box office. In fact, it's more likely that Horrible Bosses and Zookeeper combined won't make as much as Dark of the Moon will make this weekend. The new releases are certainly weaker than those from last year and there's no hope any film will make more than Despicable Me did during its opening weekend. Worse still, June 2011 sold the fewest number of tickets for any June since the year 2000; we really can't afford another slow week at the box office, but that's likely to be exactly what we are going to get. More...\n\nContest: Tango for Two\n\nJuly 1st, 2011\n\nNeither wide release next week has monster blockbuster written all over it, but of the two, Zookeeper has the best shot at opening in first place. As such, it is the target film in this week's box office prediction contest. In order to win, one must simply predict the opening weekend box office number for Zookeeper . Whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going over, will win a copy of Immigration Tango on DVD. Whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going under, will also win a copy of Immigration Tango on DVD. Entries must be received by 10 a.m., Pacific Time on Friday to be eligible, so don't delay! More...\n\n2011 Preview: July\n\nJune 28th, 2011"
