        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nThe Studio\n\n“Three men started it and they named it after themselves: C.B.C. Film Sales Company, for Jack Cohn, Joe Brandt and Jack’s younger brother, Harry Cohn.” (Hail Columbia, Rochelle Larkin, p 11) “The enterprise was growing in distinction, and hence it required a new name. C.B.C. was now universally recognized in the trade by its sobriquet, Corned Beef and Cabbage. A company could scarcely prosper under such a handicap. On January 10, 1924, C.B.C. became Columbia Pictures.” (King Cohn: The Life and Times of Harry Cohn, Bob Thomas, p 36)\n\n“The movie business was divided into two unequal parts: The best film properties went to the major studios, the rest to the novices and dreamers on Poverty Row. Harry Cohn was going to bridge that gap.” (Larkin, p 12) “Harry Cohn assumed the presidency of Columbia Pictures Corporation in 1932. He retained his position as chief of production, becoming the only film company head to hold both positions.” (Thomas, p 79)\n\nIn 1928, Columbia added what has now become famous as their logo, the torch lady. Rather than quote some books for this one, I will point you here, where the person has already done an excellent job of summarizing the history of Columbia’s famous logo. That site is also where I grabbed the logo above and there are several more versions through the years available in that fascinating piece.\n\n“But what was Columbia’s specialty? Three Stooges shorts? Blonde movies? Rita Hayworth musicals? Or perhaps It Happened One Night (1934), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), All the King’s Men (1949), From Here to Eternity (1953)?” (Columbia Pictures: Portrait of a Studio, Bernard F. Dick, ed., 1992)\n\nColumbia was always known as a “major-minor” because it didn’t own its own chain of theaters. Joe Brandt, president of the company, had decided against it, feeling it would eventually prove not to be an asset. “Whether beneficent or not, Brandt’s decision was to establish the essential nature of Columbia as a movie company. Columbia never enjoyed the cushion of guaranteed playing time. It was required to gamble on quality films that would so engage the public that theaters would be forced to book Columbia movies. And when the United States decreed separation of film making from theater owning in the 1940’s, Columbia escaped the paroxysms of those studios which could not function without the bulwark of their theater claims.” (Thomas, p 42)\n\n“Lacking a Clara Bow or a John Gilbert, Columbia relied on castoffs from the big studios: stars who had been let go because their box office appeal had seemingly been drained. With the passé stars, Cohn combined newcomers, often borrowed at a bargain from major studios.” (Thomas, p 45) This is true; many of the stars of the studio’s biggest hits, people like Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart weren’t actually under contract to Columbia. Jean Arthur was the biggest actress for the studio in the late thirties (she was under contract from 1934 to 1944) but the biggest star at the studio was Frank Capra. Capra rose at the studio, eventually getting his name above the title and earned the studio its first Oscars. In the 1930’s, 14 Oscars were won by Columbia films and all but three of them were directed by Capra. He left the studio after Lost Horizon in 1937 but came back after being talked into it by Cohn, though he left for good after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The entire studio would win fewer in Oscars in the entire 1940’s than Capra’s films won in the 1930’s.\n\nThanks in a large part to Capra, “Columbia became the home of the sophisticated film, an eventuality that astounded the many people in Hollywood who considered Harry Cohn the compleat vulgarian.” (Thomas, p 72) But, “the 1940’s found Harry Cohn continuing his gamble on film subjects that other producers shunned, notably fantasy, musical biography and political realism. It gave him pleasure to see his competitors rush to imitate his innovations, always with lesser success.” (Thomas, p 167)\n\nThen, after unsuccessfully trying to build up William Holden and only gradually making a minor star out of Glenn Ford, Cohn found what he was looking for: a star. “The ascending stardom of Rita Hayworth provided a new and stimulating experience for Harry Cohn. Never before had he been able to discover and develop – and then to profit from – a star of top rank. Columbia had a sizable list of contract players, but they were serviceable actors and actresses who could be counted on to carry B pictures or to bolster the casts of the important product. For stars, Cohn depended on loans from the big studios or multipicture deals with prominent free-lancers. The latter were not entirely satisfactory, since they demanded huge salaries and were so independent in temperament that they resisted the dictation of Harry Cohn. His faculty for alienation was such that Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, as well as Jean Arthur, refused to finish out their commitments for films with Columbia.” (Thomas, p 217)\n\n“Hollywood – where Elia Kazan once described Harry Cohn, Columbia’s founder, as ‘the biggest bug in the manure pile.’ Cohn boasted that he had a foolproof device for judging whether a picture was good or bad: ‘If my fanny squirms, it’s bad. If my fanny doesn’t squirm, it’s good. Just as simple as that.’ Writer Herman Mankiewicz’s response was, ‘Imagine – the whole world wired to Harry Cohn’s ass.'” (Fast Fade: David Puttnam, Columbia Pictures and the Battle for Hollywood, Andrew Yule, p 207) But Cohn knew success when he saw it and when he died in 1958, the studio started to founder a bit. His death was a big deal: “Two thousand persons had come to Columbia that day, March 2, 1958. It was the largest crowd ever to attend a funeral in Hollywood. On his television program that week, Red Skelton made the comment that was to become legend: ‘Well, it only proves what they always say – give the public something they want to see, and they’ll come out for it.'” (Thomas, p xvii-xviii)\n\n“Columbia Pictures had lowly origins but it always managed to make pictures that transcended its humble beginnings. The studio had been co-founded by Harry Cohn and his brother Jack in 1924. … Harry Cohn had been dubbed ‘His Crudeness’ by Frank Capra, whose films boosted Columbia’s status and earned it a slew of Academy Awards. Cohn was paradoxivally both vulgar and discerning, and Columbia cranked out films from schlock to classics. It never boasted a stable of glittering stars, although Rita Hayworth and glenn Ford made several pictures there. … In the fifties, Columbia had forged relationships with powerful independent producers such as Sam Spiegel, who was responsible for On the Waterfront (’54) and The Bridge on the River Kwai (’57) and Stanley Kramer, who made The Caine Mutiny (’54). In the sixties, Otto Preminger, Sidney Lumet, Arthur Penn, Ted Kotcheff, Fred Zinnemann, Sydney Pollack, David Lean and William Wyler all made movies for Columbia. By the end of the decade, when Peter Guber arrived, all of this was fading. Despite the studio’s success in the late sixties, the venerable producers and directors were aging.” (Hit and Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Gruber Took Sony for a Ride in Hollywood, Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters, p 67-68)\n\n“From 1955 to 1964, [Mike Frankovich] was Columbia’s European production chief. In 1964 he left London, where he had been based for nine years, and returned to Los Angeles as Columbia’s head of production … There is no doubt that Columbia’s succession of hits in the 1960s – Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Dr. Strangelove (1964), Cat Ballou (1965), The Professionals (1966), The Silencers (1966), and Casino Royale (which went sent Columbia’s stock soaring in 1967) – resulted, in great part from Frankovich’s ability to harmonize the talents of stars, directors and writers. It is also not accidental that, during Frankovich’s tenure, Columbia films won thirty-five Oscars.” (Dick, p 20-21) But Frankovich was pushed out when Columbia was reorganized in 1968. By the way, by my count, from 1955 to 1968, Columbia won 40 Oscars.\n\n“In the early seventies, Columbia’s fortune had taken a turn for the worse. After posting record profits of $21 million in 1968 on $243 million in revenues, the company lost $40 million in 1971. Following a slight upturn in 1972, it lost $65 million again in 1973 and teetered on the verge of bankruptcy.” (Griffin and Masters, p 72-73) Those 1968 numbers include most of the gross of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (which opened in mid-December of 1967) as well as Funny Girl, two films that are both in the Top 200 all-time when adjusted for inflation. There’s no big loser in 1971 but the studio released 37 films, its most after 1958 and The Last Picture Show was the only real hit.\n\n“[Ray] Stark’s ties to Columbia had been close since the studio distributed Funny Girl, which opened in September 1968. Columbia began losing money in 1971, and by 1973 the company’s very life was threatened by three expensive box office failures – 1776, Lost Horizon, and Young Winston. Although Stark had produced none of these films, Columbia still owed him millions of dollars in deferred profits from Funny Girl and he feared that he might never get the money if the studio was forced into bankruptcy.” (Indecent Exposure: A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street, David McClintock, p 88) As a result, Stark would help shepherd in the group that would eventually take charge of Columbia, including Herbert Allen and Alan Hirschfield: “Stark had finally toppled the dynasty that had held Columbia Pictures in its grip for fifty years and replaced it was a ruling family of his choosing.” (Griffin and Masters, p 77) And what those quotes don’t mention is that Stark also produced Columbia’s biggest hit of 1973, in fact their biggest hit between 1968 and 1975: The Way We Were.\n\nMcClintock, ironically, in a footnote really hits on one of the reasons why the studio was in the state it was when the Begelman scandal hit and tore the studio apart: “Generally, the Columbia board was not particularly distinguished, containing not a single independent lawyer, banker or other voice staunchly independent of the corporation’s vested interests as represented by Herbert Allen, Matty Rosenhaus, and the others who tended to be loyal to them.” (McClintock, fn, p 126-127)\n\nThen came the Begelman scandal. I won’t dedicate much of my own writing to that because McClintock’s book is so good on the subject, so see the Books list at the bottom.\n\n“By 1981, Columbia’s management was looking good again. The company was a well-drilled unit under Herbert Allen, Fay Vincent and Frank Price. Columbia Pictures had returned to financial health. Hits like California Suite, The Cheap Detective, and Midnight Express in 1978, Kramer vs. Kramer and The China Syndrome in 1979, Stir Crazy and The Blue Lagoon in 1980, and Stripes and Absence of Malice in the current year, 1981, had kept revenues from the film division flowing nicely. Many of the earlier titles were a legacy from the Hirschfield-Begelman era. Columbia had purchased Ray Stark’s Rastar Company – with Stark still running it – for 300,000 Columbia shares, each valued at $32.50, for a total of $9,750,000. The stage was set for the entry of the Coca-Cola Company.” (Fast Fade: David Puttnam, Columbia Pictures and the Battle for Hollywood, Andrew Yule, p 181)\n\nYes, Coke bought Columbia and for some films on Wikipedia, it actually lists Coca-Cola Company as the studio. But they were mostly hands off and the studio kept moving forward, at least until Coke decided to hands the reigns over to independent British producer David Puttnam. “For the six months before David’s arrival at the studio, Columbia had been slipping badly in the box-office stakes. The total for the period was still reasonable – $291 million; however, Karate Kid II accounted for $110 million of that, leaving the balance, $181 million, split between thirteen other features.” (Yule, p 212) Again, the books really cover this era – see below for more.\n\n“The marriage of Columbia and TriStar was the end of David Puttnam. His job was eliminated, and he was paid handsomely to go away. Fay Vincent, the man who had hired him, was exiled to a vaguely defined position overseeing bottling properties – Coca-Cola’s equivalent of Siberia. Victor Kaufman took the reins amid reports that Columbia stood to lose tens of millions on upcoming Puttnam movies that America wouldn’t want to see.” (Griffin and Masters, p 211) This kind of sums up the finale of the Andrew Yule book, though I highly recommend reading more about it in the Yule book. Interesting to note that even though their book was published in 1996, Griffin and Masters don’t bother to mention, even in a footnote, that Fay Vincent bounced back from that “Siberia” posting by becoming the Assistant Commissioner of Major League Baseball and then, upon the death of Bart Giamatti, becoming the Commissioner himself for almost three years. A big job and it’s surprising that it got no mention at all.\n\n“Castle Rock was one of [Columbia]’s key relationships. The company, founded in 1987, was run by five partners, the most famous of whom was Rob Reiner, director of This is Spinal Tap and Stand by Me. Columbia Pictures (then owned by Coca-Cola) had been a major investor and owned 44 percent of Castle Rock. Columbia distributed Castle Rock films in exchange for a percentage of the domestic box office. Castle Rock paid for and controlled its own marketing.” (Griffin and Masters, p 314). At the time that Sony was buying the studio, this was key, especially for hit Reiner films like When Harry Met Sally and Misery (an appropriate film, since Castle Rock was named after Stephen King’s fictional town in Maine which is where Stand by Me takes place, even if it moved the town to Oregon).\n\nIn the last little bit before Sony took over the studio, Andrew Yule published another book that dealt a lot with Columbia: Losing the Light: Terry Gilliam & the Munchausen Saga. There is a prophetic quote in the book at the end from “a veteran journalist”: “You have to understand about Columbia Pictures. My impression is of a company in a holding pattern. They haven’t started production on a single new movie in 1989. They’re waiting for a takeover or for Ghostbusters II to open, whichever comes first.” (Losing the Light: Terry Gilliam & the Munchausen Saga, Andrew Yule, p 225) But then came the actual takeover and Gilliam, who it was claimed may never work again after Munchausen and certainly wouldn’t work for Columbia was making The Fisher King for TriStar, which was part of Columbia. Gilliam himself said “My theory is that Victor Kaufman was just trying to tidy up Columbia’s books to increase the price of the Sony sale and the last thing he wanted to succeed was something Puttnam had initiated.” (Losing the Light, p 230)\n\nFor a good look at how Sony managed to take over the studio in a bit that really can’t be adequately compressed, read Chapter 17 of Hit and Run. In early August [1991], Columbia Pictures Entertainment was rechristened: It was now called Sony Pictures Entertainment. (The two film studios were still TriStar and Columbia). The studio’s name change caused some grumbling in Hollywood about cultural heritage – especially when the big sign at the entrance to the lot was changed.” (Griffin and Masters, p 305)\n\nOne point in all of this is that there is a good argument to be made that TriStar, which was the first studio I wrote about in a Century of Film post really could have been included in this piece.\n\nSony / Columbia (depending on what you look at – BoxOfficeMojo / IMDb / Wikipedia – it may say one, the other or both, but really Sony owns the company and Columbia is the studio) continued to move through the 90’s, producing some major hits. But if Ray Stark had been the fulcrum of success for Columbia in the 70’s, in the 90’s, it was Castle Rock. Between the release of Ghostbusters II and Men in Black, an eight year stretch, Columbia only had five films make $90 million dollars and four of them were Castle Rock films (A Few Good Men, City Slickers, In the Line of Fire, When Harry Met Sally). It was responsible for two of the studio’s Best Picture nominations and its only two acting Oscars (Misery, City Slickers) during that stretch.\n\nIt would be two stars and two franchises who would rise up and help Columbia become a major force in the 2000’s (it would be the biggest studio at the box office in 2002, 2004 and 2006). The two stars would be Will Smith and Adam Sandler. Of the 46 films released by Columbia to make over $100 million between 1997 and 2011, almost a third of them would star one or the other (with one more starring Smith’s son). The two franchises would be the reason Columbia would be #1 in those three years – the first two had Spider-Man films and the third would have a James Bond film, which Columbia would have the domestic distribution rights to starting with Casino Royale. Smith would be the bigger star (of the top nine films in that stretch, the only non Spider-Man and non Smith film was The Da Vinci Code) but Sandler would be the more consistent star (nine films with over $100 million).\n\nNotable Columbia Films\n\nnote: These are Columbia notables. Unless stated otherwise, assume it’s the first Columbia film to do whatever is listed, not the first ever.\n\nDiscontented Husbands – first Columbia film (1924)\n\nThe Lone Wolf Returns – first series film (1926)\n\nThat Certain Thing – first Capra film for Columbia, first film with 1928-36 logo (1928)\n\nSubmarine – first film with sound (1928)\n\nThe Donovan Affair – first all-talkie film (1929)\n\nCall of the West – first of over 300 B-Westerns (1930)\n\nThe Criminal Code – first to earn an Oscar nomination (1931)\n\nLady for a Day – first to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (1933)\n\nIt Happened One Night – first Oscar winner for Best Picture (1934)\n\nThe King Steps Out – first use of 1936-76 logo (1936)\n\nMeet Nero Wolfe – first Rita Hayworth film (1936)\n\nBlondie – first of 28 Blondie films (1938)\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington – last Capra film for Columbia (1939)\n\nMy Son is Guilty – first Glenn Ford film (1939)\n\nThe Desperadoes – first Technicolor film – Columbia was late in the game on this (1943)\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – most successful film at the Oscars (1953)\n\nPushover – first Kim Novak film (1954)\n\nThe Revenge of Frankenstein – first Hammer film released by Columbia (1958)\n\nDead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round – known only for being Harrison Ford’s film debut (1966)\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner – first film to gross over $50 million (1967)\n\nFunny Girl – first (ever) Rastar film (1968)\n\nMurder by Death – first use of 1976-81 logo (1976)\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind – first film to gross over $100 million (1977)\n\nNice Dreams – first use of 1981-93 logo (1981)\n\nTootsie – first film to gross over $150 million (1982)\n\nGhostbusters – first film to gross over $200 million; highest grossing Columbia film until 1997 (1984)\n\nWinter People – first Castle Rock film (1989)\n\nLast Action Hero – first use of 1993-2006 logo (1993)\n\nSense and Sensibility – last Oscar nominee for Best Picture until 2010 (1995)\n\nMen in Black – first film to gross over $250 million (1997)\n\nSour Grapes – last Castle Rock film (1998)\n\nSpider-Man – highest grossing Columbia film through 2011; first film to gross over $400 million (2002)\n\nThe Social Network – first Oscar nominee for Best Picture in 15 years (2010)\n\nThe Directors\n\nFrank Capra\n\nFilms: 20\n\nYears: 1928 – 1939\n\nAverage Film: 72.2\n\nBest Film: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nWorst Film: Rain or Shine\n\nThe 20 films listed above for Capra don’t include several of his early films (pre 1933) which seem to be unavailable, all of which were also made for Columbia. As mentioned above, Capra was extremely important to the studio. He was the first director to ever earn an Oscar nomination, won Best Director three times in five years, helping Columbia’s reputation immensely and is responsible for almost every really good film that the studio made in the 1930’s. As also mentioned above, of the 14 Oscars won by the studio’s film in the 1930’s, 11 of them were for Capra films and since three of them were for Capra, he by himself matched the rest of the studio. His films also provided 39 of the studio’s 62 nominations during the decade. Without him, it would take 13 years to match those 11 Oscars and it wouldn’t Best Director again until 1953.\n\nAlexander Hall\n\nFilms: 15\n\nYears: 1938 – 1947\n\nAverage Film: 63.4\n\nBest Film: Here Comes Mr. Jordan\n\nWorst Film: Good Girls Go to Paris\n\nFor the most part, Hall was a fairly mediocre director. I tried to see all of his films because he was once nominated for Best Director (for Here Comes Mr. Jordan, the only film of his to rank above ***) but there are some I still haven’t been able to get. Of the 15 I have seen, only My Sister Eileen also manages to rise above a low ***. Hall specialized in light Romantic Comedies (only two of his film do I not classify as Comedies). Outside of Jordan, his whole oeuvre managed just one Oscar nomination (Best Actress for My Sister Eileen).\n\nCharles Vidor\n\nFilms: 8\n\nYears: 1941 – 1960\n\nAverage Film: 65.6\n\nBest Film: Gilda\n\nWorst Film: The Loves of Carmen\n\nVidor was most known for working with Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford, directing Cover Girl, The Desperadoes, Gilda and The Loves of Carmen. He was entrusted with a lot of Columbia’s first Technicolor films and his films are generally entertaining and worth watching at least once.\n\nEdward Dmytryk\n\nFilms: 10\n\nYears: 1941 – 1968\n\nAverage Film: 61.0\n\nBest Film: The Caine Mutiny\n\nWorst Film: Anzio\n\nThe Caine Mutiny is miles above any of the other work that Dmytryk did for Columbia. He made three mediocre films for Columbia in the early 40’s then was actually brought into the studio after he had already been blacklisted as one of the Hollywood 10, making seven more films for the studio from 1952 to 1968, though, outside of The Caine Mutiny, I really can’t recommend any of them.\n\nDavid Lean\n\nFilms: 3\n\nYears: 1957 – 1984\n\nAverage Film: 98.3\n\nBest Film: Lawrence of Arabia\n\nWorst Film: A Passage to India\n\nLean only made three films for the studio, two for independent producer Sam Spiegel and then one much later. But those films won 16 Oscars and earned 29 nominations, including two wins (and a nomination) for Lean himself and all are among the best Columbia films ever made and indeed in my Top 100 All-Time.\n\nRob Reiner\n\nFilms: 7\n\nYears: 1986 – 1996\n\nAverage Film: 71.7\n\nBest Film: When Harry Met Sally…\n\nWorst Film: North\n\nI should note that Reiner’s average goes up to 82.8 if you don’t count North. He made Stand by Me at the studio which gave birth to his Castle Rock Productions, which then was the home for all of Reiner’s films from 1989 to 1996, all of which, except for North, earned at least one Oscar nomination and included a Best Picture nominee (A Few Good Men) and a Best Actress winner (Misery). Reiner’s decline took place mostly at other studios, after the Castle Rock distribution deal ended.\n\nThe Stars\n\nCary Grant\n\nGrant only had a small contract with Columbia (with a simultaneous one with RKO) but it brought him one of his first major hits (The Awful Truth) as well as his first Oscar nomination (Penny Serenade). In that time, he was also in one of Columbia’s most well-regarded hits (Only Angels Have Wings), one of Grant’s plumb roles (His Girl Friday) and another Best Picture nominee (The Talk of the Town).\n\nEssential Viewing: The Awful Truth, His Girl Friday, Penny Serenade\n\nJean Arthur\n\nArthur signed a five year contract in 1934. During that time, she would be in a huge hit (Mr. Deeds Goes to Town), a Best Picture winner (You Can’t Take It With You) and the studio’s best film of the decade (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington), all directed by Frank Capra as well as the highly regarded Only Angels Have Wings. She would sign another five year contract and in the next five years would be in such films as Too Many Husbands and The Talk of the Town and would earn her only Oscar nomination for The More the Merrier. After this contract expired she retired from filmmaking, only making two more films in later years.\n\nEssential Viewing: The More the Merrier, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nRita Hayworth\n\nHayworth was the studio’s first genuine, bone-fide star. She would be in several Columbia films in the late 30’s before hitting stardom with Angels Over Broadway in 1940. She then made a couple of musicals with Fred Astaire before color discovered her with Cover Girl. She would go back to black-and-white for Gilda which made her possibly the biggest pin-up in the world (and with good reason). She was Columbia’s biggest star when she took a break in 1948 but she would come back and be a big star for them again in the 50’s. I’ve seen at least 14 Columbia films starring Hayworth and there are some still that are hard to find. Sadly, her best acting performances (Separate Tables, The Story on Page One) would not be for Columbia.\n\nEssential Viewing: Gilda, Cover Girl, Miss Sadie Thompson\n\nGlenn Ford\n\nFord is perhaps most famous for his roles opposite Rita Hayworth (The Lady in Question, Gilda, The Loves of Carmen, Miss Sadie Thompson) but he was also a star outside of working with her, most notably in The Big Heat.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Big Heat, Gilda, The Desperadoes\n\nKim Novak\n\nAfter Hayworth was gone (and even after she came back), Harry Cohn desperately wanted a pin-up to replace her. He eventually settled on Novak who wasn’t as beautiful or as talented. But she became a big star in the mid to late 50’s, even if her most notable film, Vertigo, was for Paramount.\n\nEssential Viewing: Picnic, Bell Book and Candle, 5 Against the House\n\nJack Nicholson\n\nAll of Nicholson’s early Oscar nominations were in Columbia films (Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, The Last Detail). After the mid 70’s, he wouldn’t make a film at Columbia again for a long time. In the early 90’s, he earned another Oscar nomination for A Few Good Men and also starred in Wolf and then he starred in three $100 million+ films for the company (As Good as It Gets, Something’s Gotta Give, Anger Management).\n\nEssential Viewing: A Few Good Men\n\nWill Smith\n\nSmith first worked with Columbia on Bad Boys but after Men in Black he became their biggest star ever. From 2002 to 2008 he made five films at Columbia that made a combined $900 million.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Pursuit of Happyness, Men in Black, Hancock\n\nAdam Sandler\n\nArtistically, Sandler is the worst thing to ever happen to Columbia. The vast majority of his films have been critically derided (with Punch-Drunk Love the notable exception), they have earned multiple Razzie nominations for Worst Picture and Jack and Jill is the biggest film ever at the Razzies. But it’s easy to see why Sandler is important to Columbia and his Happy Madison Productions is headquartered on their lot. His films have almost never lost money and the top 8 have earned collectively, well over $1 billion. I don’t blame Columbia for making his films; I blame the audiences for paying for them.\n\nEssential Viewing: Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me\n\nGenres\n\nIt could just be a reflection of what I have seen, but it seems that Columbia really doesn’t go in for Genre films. They really focused on Comedies (especially once Screwball Comedies came around), Dramas and, after Rita Hayworth came along, some Musicals. Even through their whole history they’ve never really branched out as much as a lot of other studios have. They did make a lot of B-Westerns (the book The Columbia Story lists 331 of them) but not a lot of Westerns outside of that.\n\nWhat they did do was series films. In The Columbia Story, the series films are separated from the regular feature films at the end of the books. It includes 111 films in 7 different series (Blondie, Boston Blackie, Crime Doctor, Ellery Queen, Jungle Jim, Lone Wolf, Rusty). These films really were the bulk of Columbia’s genre films during the years of the series films (starting in 1926, but the vast majority of them from 1938 to 1955). From 1938 to 1955, Columbia released 945 feature films but only 603 primary features (non-series, non-B Western).\n\nIn more recent years, Columbia has really started to go in for sequels in attempts to kick-start some franchises (Spider-Man, Men in Black) and remakes. From 2002 to 2011, Columbia remade all of the following films: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, The Fog, Fun with Dick and Jane, The Pink Panther, All the King’s Men, The Taking of Pelham 123, The Karate Kid and they have also made films out of the following which all used to be television shows: Spider-Man, I Spy, Charlie’s Angels, S.W.A.T., Bewitched, The Green Hornet, Smurfs.\n\nThe Top 100 Columbia Films\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nA Passage to India\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nThe Last Picture Show\n\nHamlet\n\nThe Social Network\n\nAcross the Universe\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally…\n\nThe End of the Affair (1999)\n\nThe Big Chill\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nA Man for All Seasons\n\nHis Girl Friday\n\nHope and Glory\n\nBoyz N the Hood\n\nStand by Me\n\nThe Big Heat\n\nCloser\n\nKramer vs. Kramer\n\nMidnight Express\n\nAdaptation\n\nThe Remains of the Day\n\nTootsie\n\nCasino Royale (2006)\n\nIt Happened One Night\n\nIn Cold Blood\n\nFive Easy Pieces\n\nA Few Good Men\n\nAnatomy of a Murder\n\nTess\n\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town\n\nSpider-Man 2\n\nIn the Line of Fire\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nThe Awful Truth\n\nTo Die For\n\nThe Professionals\n\nThe More the Merrier\n\nYou Can’t Take It With You\n\nStranger than Fiction\n\nThe Ides of March\n\nGhostbusters\n\nShampoo\n\nBlack Hawk Down\n\nInvestigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion\n\nPicnic\n\nSpider-Man\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\n…And Justice for All\n\nIn a Lonely Place\n\nThe Collector\n\nMoneyball\n\nOur Man in Havana\n\nAll the King’s Men (1949)\n\nRoxanne\n\nHanussen\n\nGroundhog Day\n\nAbsolute Power\n\nLéon\n\nMisery\n\nThe Guns of Navarone\n\nSundays and Cybele\n\nEducating Rita\n\nStill Crazy\n\nKing Rat\n\nHere Comes Mr. Jordan\n\nLittle Women (1994)\n\nArthur Christmas\n\nPanic Room\n\nEasy Rider\n\nDeath of a Salesman\n\nThe Big Easy\n\nBig Fish\n\nMacBeth (1971)\n\nThe Front\n\nThe Caine Mutiny\n\nHuman Desire\n\nThe Pursuit of Happyness\n\nA Raisin in the Sun\n\nA River Runs Through It\n\nSilverado\n\nFail Safe\n\nTexasville\n\nThe Deadly Affair\n\nThe People vs. Larry Flynt\n\nAwakenings\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\n3:10 to Yuma (1957)\n\nTwentieth Century\n\nAbsence of Malice\n\nNotable Columbia Films Not in the Top 100\n\nnote: Includes all films I have either already reviewed or have current plans to review in the future as well as all films I saw in the theater.\n\nGandhi (#101)\n\nPorgy and Bess (#102)\n\nQuantum of Solace (#103)\n\nCash on Demand (#106)\n\nFat City (#107)\n\nMen in Black (#109)\n\nThe Last Detail (#110)\n\nAdvise and Consent (#111)\n\nThe China Syndrome (#112)\n\nMonster House (#113)\n\nEl Mariachi (#114)\n\nA Soldier’s Story (#115)\n\nGeorgy Girl (#116)\n\nThe Last Hurrah (#119)\n\nZero Effect (#120)\n\nLady for a Day (#121)\n\nHoneymoon in Vegas (#122)\n\n***\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (#123)\n\nFly Away Home (#124)\n\nLa Bamba (#125)\n\nThe Lady from Shanghai (#126)\n\nBottle Rocket (#127)\n\nThe Buddy Holly Story (#129)\n\nPunch-Drunk Love (#130)\n\nThe Go-Between (#132)\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov (#137)\n\nTo Sir With Love (#139)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Mexico (#142)\n\nJason and the Argonauts (#143)\n\nGilda (#144)\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings (#145)\n\nCover Girl (#146)\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha (#148)\n\nCalifornia Suite (#150)\n\nOliver!

The films are listed in alphabetical order. Unless I have something specific to say, I don’t mention films that have full reviews elsewhere or films that I saw in the theater from 1989 to 2005 (they are all mentioned in those Nighthawk Awards).\n\n3:10 to Yuma – A better film than I had remembered with a good villainous performance from Glenn Ford.\n\nAbsence of Malice – A very good film that won’t get reviewed because it’s original. Well worth seeing just for Newman’s performance. Has one of my brother’s favorite film lines: “Boy, the last time there was a leak like this, Noah built hisself a boat.”\n\nAngels and Demons – My initial review of this upon seeing it was “So implausible that it makes The Da Vinci Code seems like established Catholic dogma.”\n\nBlondie on a Budget – None of the Blondie films are very good but if you see just one, see this one which has Rita Hayworth in it.\n\nCash on Demand – I tried to see all the Hammer films released by Columbia (I’m close) and this was the best that I hadn’t seen before. A tight little thriller with a strong performance from Peter Cushing.\n\nThe Electric Horseman – Not worth mentioning except that it’s one of my mother’s favorite movies.\n\nA Few Good Men – Much higher on the list above than it would have been before but I have already re-watched it for the Best Adapted Screenplay project and it took a big jump up in my estimation this time.\n\nFire Down Below – Should have been titled “Sorry, Jack Lemmon, but you’re no Robert Mitchum”\n\nGilda – I want it to be a classic but even seeing it again didn’t raise it above high ***. Definitely worth seeing though, just for Hayworth.\n\nThe Green Hornet – Rich pothead douchebag becomes superhero because he’s bored. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nI Still Know What You Did Last Summer – Let’s make a movie starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and set it in the Bahamas and not put her in a bikini. Who thought that was smart marketing? Oh, and it totally stole its ideas from Scream 2.\n\nIshtar – Just as bad as you think it’s going to be.\n\nJust Go With It – When you make me long for Goldie Hawn (this is a remake of Cactus Flower), you know you’ve done wrong.\n\nJust One of the Guys – The only thing I remember is that I think this was one of the first movies with a topless scene I ever saw.\n\nThe Karate Kid (2010) – Totally pointless and unnecessary and Jayden Smith is too young. But, there is one really good scene, which is when you realize what Jackie Chan does in the scene where he saves Smith from the bullies.\n\nThe Man They Could Not Hang – Especially given that Columbia didn’t do much in the way of Horror, this one with Boris Karloff is well worth seeing.\n\nMr. Deeds – If you thought the musical remake of Lost Horizon was the worst thing Columbia could do to a Frank Capra film you are in for a very unpleasant surprise. What the hell is Oscar level talent like Winona Ryder, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi doing in this piece of shit? This film seems like the filmmakers saw the episode of The Simpsons where Mel Gibson remakes Mr. Smith and thought that it was a brilliant idea.\n\nMurder by Death – Part of a wave of Mystery-Comedies in the mid to late 70’s. I rewatched this a couple of years ago as a condition of being loaned some hard to find films from a regular commenter. It’s funny in parts with its parody of other famous detectives (The Cheap Detective, two years later from Columbia would do the same) but doesn’t hold together well enough to be higher than a low ***.\n\nMy Stepmother is an Alien – There was a girl named Sarah Borrey in my ninth grade class and I was desperately in love with her. That same year this film, with a young actress named Alyson Hannigan who looked just like Sarah was released. That’s all I remember and I spent years looking for her again before she finally became a household name almost a decade later with Buffy and American Pie. Sarah transferred to a private high school after ninth grade and I never saw her again.\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings – One of the Columbia films I re-watched for this post because it has such a high reputation. I did bump it up a bit but it’s still at high *** and I’m not really certain why it’s ranked so high at TSPDT.\n\nThe Other Boleyn Girl – Ironies abound. Saw this in 2015, not long after Wolf Hall came out (in which some of the same events are told much better with Mark Rylance playing Cromwell instead of Thomas Boleyn) and right after Benedict Cumberbatch, who in this film, dies and his wife, played by Scarlett Johansson, ends up marrying Eddie Redmayne, lost the Best Actor Oscar race to, of course, Eddie Redmayne. In spite of that cast, not worth seeing.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop – In high school, a local mall had both Kindergarten Cop and Terminator 2 film scenes there. This was filmed at my local mall in Massachusetts. What a fall from my high school days.\n\nSt. Elmo’s Fire – The Medium Sized Chill. My best suggestion is to watch the video for the fantastic title song and skip the film.\n\nStill Crazy – A really good, fun movie with a fantastic soundtrack. See it if you haven’t already.\n\nStripes – One of the most ridiculous plots ever put on film but a fun film anyway with a pretty good score for a silly Comedy.\n\nThe Terror of Tiny Town – Really has to be seen to be believed.\n\nWalk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story – Easily my favorite thing Judd Apatow has been involved with, namely because of Reilly’s goofy, endearing performance and a really good set of original songs.\n\nThe War Lover – The film my parents saw on their first date which, for years, was described to me as “a film where Steve McQueen crashes into the White Cliffs of Dover at the end”. Worth seeing namely for McQueen’s performance even if I just spoiled the end of it for you.\n\nWholly Moses! – If you want a good example of why I can’t stand Dudley Moore, watch this terrible Biblical parody.\n\nYear of the Comet – My friend Tavis and I tried desperately to get this for years (I finally saw it years later) because William Goldman writes about in Which Lie Did I Tell, about how earnest he was about it and how no one cared. Yeah, because it’s about a bottle of wine, Bill. It’s not worth tracking down unless you’re obsessed with Penelope Ann Miller.\n\nZookeeper – More crappy Kevin James filmed in Boston while we were there, this time at our zoo (Franklin Zoo). A lot of CGI. There is no spot in the zoo that gives you a view of the Boston skyline like this movie tries to show (more than once).\n\nThe 10 Most Under-Rated Columbia Films\n\nThese are all films that I rate at **** that have never appeared in TSPDT’s Top 1000 (now 2000) or their Top 250 21st Century Films (now 1000).

I have seen none of the 69 films made before 1928. 1950 is the last year where I have seen less than 10%, 1953 is the most recent year I have seen less than 20%, 1968 is the only year since 1956 where I have seen less than 40% of the films. 1986 and 1988 are the only years since 1971 where I have seen less than half the films. I have seen at least 60% of the films in all but six years since 1971.\n\nBest Year:\n\n1987, 1993: 4 films in the Top 20\n\nColumbia has never had more than 2 films in the Top 10 but has had two films 12 times, ranging from 1934 to 1995. It had two Top 10 films and three Top 20 films each year from 1982 to 1984.\n\nEras:\n\nTop 10 most films every year except 1912-26 and 1927-28.\n\nColumbia entered the Top 10 most films in 1932 and moved into 8th in 1934. It passed Universal into 7th in 1938. It caught RKO and moved into 6th in 1942 but moved back the next year and stayed in 7th until 1959. It would stay in 6th until 1992 when it finally passed United Artists. In 2008, it would catch MGM and move into 4th place among all studios.\n\nThe Top Films:\n\nColumbia would be the last of the majors to win the Nighthawk, finally winning in 1953. But by winning four in five years, it was the fourth studio to win four awards. In 1962 it would become just the second to win five awards, after UA which did it the year before and two years later would be the first to win a sixth. Because of the 31 year wait between awards it would only be the third studio to win seven awards and it still hasn’t won an eighth.\n\nNighthawk Winner: 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1995\n\n4 Films in the Top 20: 1987, 1993\n\nTop 10 Films: 61\n\nFirst Year in the Top 10: 1934\n\nLatest Year in the Top 10: 2010\n\nTop 20 Films: 114\n\nBest Decade for Top 20 Films: 1980’s (20)\n\nWorst Decade for Top 20 Films: 1920’s (0)\n\nnote: Columbia had the most Top 20 films in the 90’s of any studio with 16.\n\nNighthawk Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 163\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Nighthawks: 54\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 97\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 24\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 36\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 576\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 146\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Actor (48)\n\nDirector with Most Nighthawk Nominated Films: Frank Capra (7)\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawks: The Shawshank Redemption\n\nBest Film with No Nighthawk Nominations: Our Man in Havana\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Drama Nominations: 85\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Comedy Nominations: 70\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Drama Awards: 26\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Comedy Awards: 27\n\nDrama Picture Nominations: 28\n\nComedy Picture Nominations: 26\n\nTotal Number of Drama Nominations: 262\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Nominations: 219\n\nTotal Number of Drama Wins: 65\n\nTotal Number of Comedy Wins: 65\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Actor (43 – Drama / 40 – Comedy)\n\nBest Drama Film With No Nominations: Tess\n\nBest Comedy Film With No Nominations: Still Crazy\n\nMost 2nd Place Finishes: A Passage to India (8)\n\nMost 6th Place Finishes: The Remains of the Day (4)\n\nMost Top 10 Finishes: From Here to Eternity (17)\n\nMost Top 20 Finishes: From Here to Eternity / Lawrence of Arabia (18)\n\nFilms With at Least One Top 10 Finish: 243\n\nBest Film Without a Top 10 Finish: Texasville\n\nFilms With at Least One Top 20 Finish: 296\n\nBest Film Without a Top 20 Finish: And Now for Something Completely Different\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 15\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 15\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 14\n\nOn the Waterfront – 13\n\nSeven Samurai – 13\n\nA Passage to India – 13\n\nTaxi Driver – 12\n\nA Man for All Seasons – 11\n\nThe Last Picture Show – 11\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind / The Age of Innocence / Sense and Sensibility – 11\n\nMost Nighthawks:\n\nSeven Samurai – 13\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 13\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 13\n\nOn the Waterfront – 11\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 10\n\nSense and Sensibility – 9\n\nDr. Strangelove – 5\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula – 4\n\nsix films – 3\n\nMost Nighthawk Points:\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 780\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 755\n\nOn the Waterfront – 750\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 740\n\nSeven Samurai – 690\n\nSense and Sensibility – 625\n\nA Passage to India – 485\n\nDr. Strangelove – 480\n\nTaxi Driver – 445\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington – 425\n\nMost Drama Nominations:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 9\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington – 8\n\nOn the Waterfront – 8\n\nThe Last Picture Show – 8\n\nA Passage to India / Sense and Sensibility – 7\n\nMost Comedy Nominations:\n\nShampoo – 8\n\nTootsie – 8\n\nThe Big Chill – 8\n\nThe Awful Truth – 7\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally – 7\n\nMost Drama Wins:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 6\n\nOn the Waterfront – 6\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 5\n\nA Passage to India – 5\n\nSense and Sensibility – 5\n\nMost Comedy Wins:\n\nThe Awful Truth – 6\n\nThe More the Merrier – 5\n\nDr. Strangelove – 5\n\nTootsie – 5\n\nThe Big Chill – 5\n\nMost Drama Points:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 560\n\nOn the Waterfront – 520\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington – 490\n\nA Passage to India – 465\n\nSense and Sensibility – 460\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 430\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 430\n\nFive Easy Pieces – 380\n\nSeven Samurai – 365\n\nThe Last Picture Show – 345\n\nMost Comedy Points:\n\nThe Awful Truth – 500\n\nTootsie – 490\n\nThe Big Chill – 485\n\nThe More the Merrier – 435\n\nDr. Strangelove – 435\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally – 435\n\nTo Die For – 370\n\nAdaptation – 365\n\nShampoo – 355\n\nHere Comes Mr. Jordan – 335\n\nAll-Time Nighthawk Awards\n\nnote: As always, films in red won the Oscar and films in blue were nominated.\n\nBest Picture\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nDr. Strangelove\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nAnalysis: The full list above, of course, is the full list.\n\nThe first three films are all 99 films. There are only 23 “99” films in film history and to have three of them is remarkable. The only other studios with more than two are Paramount and Warner Bros which both have four. All five of the films on the list win the Nighthawk as do From Here to Eternity and Sense and Sensibility while The Age of Innocence is one of the highest #2 films in film history. Another 29 Columbia films earn Nighthawk nominations including three in the 15 year stretch where Columbia had no Oscar nominee for Best Picture (Hamlet, The End of the Affair, Across the Universe). Aside from the six Dramas that win Picture, three more win the Drama award, all of them #2 in their year (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Five Easy Pieces, A Passage to India). Aside from Dr. Strangelove, eight others win the Comedy award, with two of them (The More the Merrier, To Die For) doing it without even finishing in the Top 5 for the year overall (the other Comedy winners are The Awful Truth, The Professionals, Tootsie, The Big Chill, When Harry Met Sally, Across the Universe). Overall, 57 films finish in the Top 10 and 99 finish in the Top 20 and earn at least ***.5.\n\nColumbia has won Best Picture at the Oscars 12 times, including three times in five years from 1953 to 1957 and 7 times in 20 years from 1949 to 1968. Before that, it had only won twice (It Happened One Night, You Can’t Take It With You) and since then has only won three times (Kramer vs. Kramer, Gandhi, The Last Emperor). It earned its first nomination in 1933, never skipped more than one year until 1944, when there was a gap until 1949, then never skipped more than two years in a row until 1972-1975. From 1976 to 1995, there were two consecutive year gaps (1985-1986, 1988-1989) but most years had a nominee. But then, after 1995, it would not be until 2010 that another Columbia film would earn Best Picture. Overall, there have been 51 nominees from Columbia, including the 1st and 4th most successful Oscar films, points-wise (From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront).\n\nColumbia has won Picture – Drama at the Globes 12 times, including five times from 1957 to 1966, though since 1979 it has only won twice (The Last Emperor, The Social Network). It has also won Picture – Comedy three times (Oliver, Tootsie, Hope and Glory) as well as winning Picture – Musical twice in the stretch where Musical and Comedy were separate awards (Porgy and Bess, Song Without End). In 1987, it became just the third studio to ever win both Drama and Comedy in the same year. In addition, there have been 24 Drama nominees including two each in 1965, 1966 (three including the winner), 1967 and 1970 and it had three in the gap from 1995 to 2010 where it had no Oscar nominees (The People vs. Larry Flynt, The End of the Affair, Closer). The studio has also had 37 more Comedy or Musical nominees including three in 1975 (Shampoo, Funny Lady, Tommy). It has never gone more than 4 years between Comedy nominees.\n\nThe studio hasn’t been as successful at the BAFTAs. It has won eight times (Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Dr. Strangelove, A Man for all Seasons, Gandhi, Educating Rita, The Last Emperor, Sense and Sensibility), the first four of which also won British Film. It has earned an additional 29 nominations, though 11 of them were before 1968 when there were no limits on the number of nominees. Since 1993, it only has three nominations (The End of the Affair, Big Fish, The Social Network). It has earned six Best British Film nominations (in addition to the four wins) but Casino Royale is the only one since 1967.\n\nSense and Sensibility and The Social Network both won the BFCA while seven other films have earned nominations. No Columbia film has won the PGA though 15 films have been nominated for it including 10 films in the award’s first 8 years and three films in 2011 (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Ides of March, Moneyball).\n\nThe Social Network is the only really big winner at the critics awards, sweeping all six while no other Columbia film has more than two. That’s a little deceptive, though because Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, On the Waterfront and Bridge on the River Kwai all won both awards (NBR, NYFC) in an era where there were only two and A Man for All Seasons won those two in the first year of three awards so all of those were dominant winners. In addition, five other films won two awards (Kramer vs. Kramer, Gandhi, A Passage to India, Hope and Glory, Sense and Sensibility). Eight other Columbia films have won at least one critics award with It Happened One Night, True Glory (both NBR), All the King’s Men and From Here to Eternity (both NYFC) all doing it in an era where there were only two awards. In 1971, Columbia had the NSFC winner (Claire’s Knee) and the NBR winner (Macbeth).\n\nBest Director\n\nDavid Lean (Lawrence of Arabia)\n\nDavid Lean (The Bridge on the River Kwai)\n\nAkira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai)\n\nElia Kazan (On the Waterfront)\n\nMartin Scorsese (The Age of Innocence)\n\nAnalysis: Scorsese doesn’t win the Nighthawk though the others do as do Zinnemann (From Here to Eternity), Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove) and Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility). Including Scorsese, there are 30 nominees who don’t win while there are 62 total Top 10 finishers. Capra (Mr. Smith) and Lean (Passage) win Drama awards in addition to those above while Columbia has had 10 Comedy winners.\n\nColumbia has an interesting and distinguished history at the Oscars in this category. All of its wins have been in bunches with large gaps in between. From 1934 to 1938, it won four Oscars, the only studio to ever win four in five years and the first to win three in a row (1936-38), something no other studio would do for four more decades and has only been done the two times. But then it was followed by a 15 year gap before three in five years, a 5 year gap before winning three in seven years, an 11 year gap before winning three in nine years and then a gap that has run since 1987. Columbia is the only studio to win back-to-back director Oscars without either film winning Best Picture (Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, The Awful Truth) and it’s even more incredible since both were Comedies. In fact, Columbia’s first four Oscars in this category were all for Comedies and no other Comedy would win the award until 1952 and United Artists is the only other studio with more than one Director Oscar for Comedy (it has three).\n\nColumbia has won 12 Globes but half of them were from 1949 to 1957 (including three in a row from 1953 to 1955: From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront, Picnic) and only four have come since 1966 (Gandhi, Last Emperor, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Social Network). In addition, it has earned 34 nominations including four in two years in 1992-93 (A Few Good Men, A River Runs Through It, Age of Innocence, Remains of the Day).\n\nColumbia has only won three BAFTAs: Midnight Express, Gandhi and The Social Network. In addition, it has earned 14 nominations. At the BFCA, Ang Lee won and Tim Burton (Big Fish) earned a nomination.\n\nColumbia has done well at the DGA which is much older than the PGA and coincides with Columbia’s strong era in the 1950’s and 1960’s. It has won the award nine times, six of them from 1949 to 1966 and hasn’t won since 1987. In addition, it has earned 35 nominations including eight in three years in the more extended nomination era of 1966-68.\n\nDavid Fincher is the big critics winner, sweeping the awards in 2010. Ang Lee won three awards in 1995. David Lean won both awards in the era of two awards in 1957 and won the only award in 1962 (the NYFC had a strike going) and George Stevens won the award when there was only one award. Aside from Lean, five other directors won two awards (including Lean in 1984) and 11 total directors won one award each, six of them before 1966 and two more when there were only three critics groups. The most awards have been the NYFC (11) and the NBR (9).\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nDr. Strangelove\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nAdaptation\n\nAnalysis: Nine films have won the Nighthawk, though only the top two listed here do (the other three are in very strong years). The other winners are The Awful Truth, From Here to Eternity, Lawrence of Arabia, Midnight Express, Sense and Sensibility and The Social Network. Another 28 films earn nominations and another 30 land in the Top 10.\n\nTen films win the Oscar including at least one film in every decade. Another 41 earn Oscar nominations including 10 in the 60’s and three nominees in 1965 alone (Collector, Cat Ballou, Ship of Fools). Six films win Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay (It Happened One Night, From Here to Eternity, The Bridge on the River Kwai, A Man for all Seasons, Kramer vs Kramer, Last Emperor).\n\nSix films won the Globe that are also adapted (A Man for all Seasons, Midnight Express, Kramer vs Kramer, Last Emperor, Sense and Sensibility, Social Network). Of those, only Man, Emperor and Social won the big three awards. For the nomination numbers see the next category.\n\nDuring the years before the category split at the BAFTAs six Columbia films that were adapted won Best Screenplay (Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Man for all Seasons, Go-Between, Last Picture Show, Last Detail). Since the split (in 1983), The End of the Affair, Adaptation and Social Network have all won. Before the split, six adapted films earned nominations and since the split 11 have earned nominations.\n\nFour films have won the BFCA (Sense and Sensibility, Adaptation, Social Network, Moneyball) and one has been nominated (Big Fish). All six of the Columbia WGA winners pre-split were adapted and seven more have won since the 1967 splits. See below for more statistics.\n\nSocial Network won five critics awards (all but the NYFC) while Adaptation won four (not LAFC or NSFC). Also, Sense and Sensibility and Moneyball each won three while four films won one award each, most importantly Anatomy of a Murder which did so when the NYFC was the only critics group that gave a Screenplay award.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally…\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nThe Big Chill\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nAnalysis: Six films win the Nighthawk including four above (not The Big Chill), Five Easy Pieces and Tootsie. Seventeen more films earn nominations and 13 beyond that are in the Top 10. Lately, Columbia has been far stronger with adapted scripts (there are only two Nighthawk nominees since 1993 – Stranger Than Fiction and Across the Universe).\n\nSix films win the Oscar, one of which also won another writing award (Here Comes Mr. Jordan) and two of which were nominated (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 49th Parallel). The other three winners are On the Waterfront, Gandhi and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner with the first two the only Columbia films to win Picture, Director and Original Screenplay. Columbia hasn’t had an Oscar nominee in this category since 1993.\n\nThe only two original scripts to win the Golden Globe Screenplay award are Gandhi and The People vs Larry Flynt. There have been a total of 24 Globe nominees for Screenplay (not including winner), most of them adapted but the Globe doesn’t distinguish. Columbia did score five nominations in two years in 1983-84 (Dresser, Big Chill, Educating Rita, Soldier’s Story, Passage to India) but none of them won and they had the winner (Gandhi) and another nominee (Tootsie) in 1982.\n\nThe only pre-split winner at the BAFTAs that was original was I’m All Right Jack. Since the split, Columbia has won two awards (When Harry Met Sally, Groundhog Day). There were four original films nominated before the split and there have been five nominees since the split though none since 1993.\n\nThe only BFCA nominee is Stranger Than Fiction.\n\nSix Columbia films have won the WGA, all six of them between 1967 and 1983. In total, 66 films have earned nominations (not including the 19 winners) though Stranger Than Fiction is the only original nominee since 1995.\n\nTootsie is the big winner among original scripts at the critics awards, winning New York, LA and the NSFC. Two films won two awards each (Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, Hope and Glory). Shampoo and Stranger Than Fiction are the only original scripts to win one award.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nPeter O’Toole (Lawrence of Arabia)\n\nAlec Guinness (The Bridge on the River Kwai)\n\nMarlon Brando (On the Waterfront)\n\nRobert De Niro (Taxi Driver)\n\nAnthony Hopkins (The Remains of the Day)\n\nAnalysis: Hopkins doesn’t win the Nighthawk though he does earn a perfect 9. Actually, Columbia has six perfect 9’s because there is also Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Aside from those four above and Stewart, Peter Sellers (Dr. Strangelove), Jack Nicholson (Five Easy Pieces) and Michael Caine (Educating Rita) all win the Nighthawk. Including Hopkins and the winners, there are 48 Nighthawk nominees including three in 1979 (Dustin Hoffman, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino). This is by far the most dominant category at the Nighthawk Globes with seven Comedy winners, 40 total Comedy nominees, 7 Drama winners and 43 total Drama nominees including three films nominated twice (From Here to Eternity, The Dresser, Shawshank Redemption).\n\nNine performances have won the Oscar and another 39 have earned Oscar nominations (including two from The Dresser). But, until 1973 (when Jack Nicholson earned his second nomination), there had been 7 winners and 17 nominees and there only duplicate actor was Jimmy Stewart (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Anatomy of a Murder). That would finally change starting in the 70’s with Nicholson (Five Easy Pieces, The Last Detail), Hoffman (Kramer vs Kramer, Tootsie) and De Niro (Taxi Driver, Awakenings) and even Will Smith (Ali, The Pursuit of Happyness).\n\nColumbia has done decently in Drama at the Globes (10 wins, including back to back in 1982-83) and another 27 nominations. In Comedy, while the nominations are spread out (30 over a space of almost 60 years with only one gap of more than five years), the winners are very much bunched: 1957 and 1958, then 1965 and 1968, then three straight from 1982 to 1984 with none since. That also means Columbia won both Best Actor Globes in back-to-back years in 1982 and 1983, a rare distinction (it happened once before with United Artists).\n\nThirteen films have won the BAFTA while another 27 films have earned nominations while neither number includes the four films that earned two nominations (Seven Samurai, Prisoner, Dr. Strangelove, The Dresser) while the first number does include Lawrence of Arabia which did both.\n\nWith the BFCA coming around after the height of Columbia, only four performances have earned nominations (Ali, Pursuit of Happyness, Social Network, Moneyball). The last three were all also SAG nominees as were The People vs Larry Flynt and Adaptation while Morgan Freeman won the SAG for Shawshank.\n\nFive performances have won three critics awards: De Niro in Taxi Driver, Hoffman in Kramer, Kingsley in Gandhi, Eisenberg in Social Network and Pitt in Moneyball. In addition, Awakenings won three awards, two for De Niro and one for Robin Williams. Another eight films have won two awards with Guinness in Bridge on the River Kwai winning the only two in existence at the time and the two awards in 1965 being split for Ship of Fools (because Lee Marvin also won his for Cat Ballou). Another 10 performances beyond that won one critics award each.\n\nBest Actress\n\nEmma Thompson (The Remains of the Day)\n\nEmma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility)\n\nJulianne Moore (The End of the Affair)\n\nRosalind Russell (His Girl Friday)\n\nJudy Davis (A Passage to India)\n\nAnalysis: Both Thompson performances and Davis win the Nighthawk. Aside from Moore and Russell, there are 28 Nighthawk nominees. Columbia does much better at the Nighthawk Globes in Comedy (10 winners, 20 nominees with two each in 1934, 1936 and 1938) than Drama (4 winners, 21 nominees).\n\nThe Oscars and I are not in alignment in this category as none of the five Oscar winners (It Happened One Night, Born Yesterday, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, Funny Girl, Misery) are in my Top 5 though all but Russell earned nominations (along with 29 other performances including two from Suddenly Last Summer). Irene Dunne is notable for being nominated in back-to-back years for Theodora Goes Wild and The Awful Truth.\n\nColumbia has a strange history at the Globes. It won in Comedy in 1950 (for Judy Holliday who was also Drama nominated) then Drama in 1959, 1963 and 1965. Since then, Columbia has won 8 Comedy awards and only one Drama award (Misery) and twice earned two Comedy noms (Shampoo, Annie). Altogether, there have been 32 Comedy noms (from 30 films) and 28 Drama noms (from 27 films). Streisand is the big Columbia actress here with a Comedy win, two more Comedy noms and a Drama nom.\n\nThere have been 9 BAFTA winners, mostly for British actresses (Katharine Hepburn, Woodward and Fonda are the exceptions). There have also been 25 other nominees. At the BFCA, Nicole Kidman (To Die For) and Meryl Streep (Julie and Julia) won while Diane Keaton (Something’s Gotta Give) was nominated. No Columbia actress has won SAG though five have earned noms (Sense and Sensibility, End of the Affair, Something’s Gotta Give, Memoirs of a Geisha, Julie and Julia).\n\nA Passage to India won three awards (two for Peggy Ashcroft, one for Judy Davis) and Streep won two awards for Julie and Julia. Aside from that, only eight other performances have even won a single critics award.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nToshiro Mifune (Seven Samurai)\n\nOmar Sharif (Lawrence of Arabia)\n\nClaude Rains (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington)\n\nKarl Malden (On the Waterfront)\n\nSterling Hayden (Dr. Strangelove)\n\nAnalysis: All five of these win the Nighthawk as do Frank Sinatra (From Here to Eternity), Sessue Hayakawa (Bridge on the River Kwai), George C. Scott (Anatomy of a Murder), Gene Hackman (I Never Sang for My Father), Ben Johnson (Last Picture Show), Jack Warden (Shampoo), Chris Cooper (Adaptation) and Clive Owen (Closer). It’s a strong category for Columbia. Mr. Smith and Waterfront get two other nominations and Bridge and Picture Show get one more each. In total there are 47 nominations from 41 films. All the Drama winners are listed above but there are also an additional six performances that win the Comedy award as well. Like I said, a strong category.\n\nOnly five actors have won the Oscar: Sinatra, Johnson, Cooper, Charles Coburn (The More the Merrier) and Jack Palance (City Slickers) but Waterfront had three nominees and Picture Show, Anatomy of a Murder and Mr. Smith had two each. That gives the studio 48 nominations from 43 films.\n\nNine of the Columbia films have won the Globe and another 23 have earned nominations. Only four performances have won the BAFTA (Edward Fox for The Go-Between, Johnson, John Hurt for Midnight Express, Owen) but there have been 26 total nominations, including two each for The Go-Between and Gandhi. At the BFCA, Cooper won the award while three others have earned nominations. But Columbia has been mostly ignored by SAG, earning just three nominations (Kenneth Branagh for Othello, Cooper, Jonah Hill for Moneyball).\n\nEdward Norton won three critics awards in 1996 with The People vs. Larry Flynt being one of the films listed. Two awards each went to Jack Nicholson (Easy Rider), Johnson, Nicholson again (A Few Good Men) and Cooper while seven performances have won one award each.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nMeryl Streep (Kramer vs. Kramer)\n\nEva Marie Saint (On the Waterfront)\n\nMeryl Streep (Adaptation)\n\nNatalie Portman (Closer)\n\nPeggy Ashcroft (A Passage to India)\n\nAnalysis: Portman doesn’t win the Nighthawk but the other four do as do 10 others. This is a strong category for Columbia. Aside from the 10 winners, there are 34 other nominees. The Last Picture Show manages a winner and two other nominees while Kramer vs. Kramer and Tootsie have a winner and a nomination.\n\nOf the 12 films to manage an Oscar winner and an Oscar nominee only Columbia has done it three times: The Last Picture Show, Kramer vs. Kramer, Tootsie. Columbia has also managed nine other Oscar winners and 21 other nominees.\n\nColumbia managed the winner and nominee trick at the Globes with Kramer and Only When I Laugh. It also managed ten other winners, a film with two nominees (Last Picture Show) and nine other nominees. It did the winner and nominee at the BAFTAs with Last Picture Show, Gandhi, Age of Innocence and Sense and Sensibility. Aside from those four films, it has three BAFTA wins and nine nominees. Angelina Jolie (Girl Interrupted) won the BFCA while three others have earned nominations. Kate Winslet (Sensibility) and Jolie won SAG while Cloris Leachman (Spanglish) was nominated.\n\nStreep won four awards for Kramer while three awards each went to Karen Black (Five Easy Pieces) and Jessica Lange (Tootsie) while The Last Picture Show split three awards (two for Ellen Burstyn, one for Cloris Leachman). Peggy Ashcroft won two awards (and three as lead) as did Courtney Love for The People vs. Larry Flynt. Eleven other performances won one award each.\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nThe Last Picture Show\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nAnalysis: This is based on the total points for acting for all members of the cast. It’s impressive that Lawrence of Arabia can make the list without a single speaking role for a female. Eternity and Picture Show make the list here without making the Top 5 in any individual acting categories because they were often in the Top 10, just not in the Top 5 and because they have large excellent casts.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Social Network\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nAnalysis: Social Network doesn’t win the Nighthawk but the other four do as does From Here to Eternity. Aside from Social Network, 31 other films also earn Nighthawk noms.\n\nColumbia has done well at the Academy Awards, winning 11 Editing Oscars including three in a row in the 50’s (From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront, Picnic) and back-to-back in 2010 and 2011 (Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). It has also earned 33 other nominations. It has had three four year stretches with at least one nomination: five nominations in 1936-39, four from 1977-1980 and five again from 1982-85 but also had a 13 year drought between 1997 and 2010.\n\nColumbia has only won twice at the BAFTAs (Midnight Express, Social Network) and has earned 12 nominations. It won the BFCA with Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and earned a nomination for Social Network. It has won the ACE four times (Gandhi, Last Emperor, Black Hawk Down, Social Network) and earned 17 other nominations, six of them since the group added a Comedy category.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nA Passage to India\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nAnalysis: There is a sixth perfect score for Cinematography: Age of Innocence though it doesn’t win the Oscar because (like with many categories) of Schindler’s List. It is one of 32 Nighthawk nominees in addition to the five winners. There are also 29 more Top 10 and 47 more Top 20.\n\nTwelve films have won the Oscar, half of them during the split category years and six since though only Memoirs of a Geisha has won since 1992. In fact, nine of the wins were in just 30 years from 1953 to 1982. There have also been 48 nominees, again split almost evenly (22 during the split years). In the first few years after the split (1967), Columbia did well (9 nominations in six years) but not that well (no wins).\n\nThree films have won the BAFTA (A Man for All Seasons, Tess, Memoirs of a Geisha) and 23 other films have been nominated, seven of them during the “British Cinematography” years. Columbia has been blanked at the BFCA. At the ASC there have been three wins (Shawshank, Patriot, Geisha) and nine other nominees. Last Emperor won three critics awards, Tess won two and Hope and Glory and Dracula won one each.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nThe Da Vinci Code\n\nSilverado\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nAnalysis: The first three all win the Nighthawk as do From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront, Seven Samurai, The Professionals, Taxi Driver, Sense and Sensibility and The Social Network. Another 17 films earn nominations.\n\nColumbia films have won 15 Oscars in Score though several of them were in the Musical Score category and one was in Adapted Score / Song Score (The Buddy Holly Story). Since 1987, though, the only winner is Social Network. Between all the Score categories, there have been 77 nominees and while it might not have won an Oscar in the 90’s, 10 Columbia films were nominated from 1991 to 1997.\n\nSix films have won the Globe (Guns of Navarone, Midnight Express, Passage to India, Last Emperor, Memoirs of a Geisha, Social Network) and 16 others have been nominated, although, only two of those were from 1991 to 1997, showing some disagreement with the Oscars.\n\nOnly two films have won the BAFTA (Taxi Driver, Memoirs of a Geisha) while 13 others have earned nominations. Geisha and Social Network both won the BFCA while three others have earned nominations. Social Network also won two critics awards while Taxi Driver and Midnight Express each won one.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nCasino Royale\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nBlack Hawk Down\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nAnalysis: Six films win the Nighthawk, which doesn’t include Black Hawk Down but does include From Here to Eternity and On the Waterfront. Another 25 films aside from that (including Black Hawk Down) earn nominations.\n\nSix films win the Oscar, though only two since 1968 (The Last Emperor, Black Hawk Down) but a whopping 44 have earned nominations, including 24 since 1968 and four in 2010 and 2011 combined. It’s worth mentioning that 13 of those nominations are from 1934 to 1945 when every studio was guaranteed a nomination.\n\nCasino Royale is the only BAFTA winner though ten other films have earned nominations. The Social Network is the only BFCA nominee. No Columbia film has won the CAS though eleven films have earned nominations.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nAnalysis: There are 9 Columbia films that earn a perfect score in Art Direction. The other four, in chronological order, are Lawrence of Arabia, A Passage to India, Hamlet and Marie Antoinette. Those are among 13 Columbia films that win the Nighthawk and another 17 that earn nominations.\n\nEleven films have won the Oscar but only The Last Emperor and Memoirs of a Geisha since 1982. In addition, 36 films have earned nominations. Five films have won BAFTAs (Dr. Strangelove, A Man for All Seasons, The Hireling, Close Encounters, Baron Munchausen) and 23 other films have earned nominations. There have been no BFCA nominees. The ADG missed a lot of great Columbia work by starting late but Memoirs of a Geisha, Casino Royale and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo all won awards while 13 other films have earned nominations.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\nSpider-Man 2\n\nCasino Royale\n\nJason and the Argonauts\n\nAnalysis: Columbia isn’t a big VE driven studio. Only 34 films even make the Top 20 at the Nighthawks. Eight films do win the award, all but two of them before the 1977 boom (Dracula and Fifth Element are the exceptions) and there are 24 total nominees (including the winners). Of the winners, four of them have visual effects from Ray Harryhausen and of the nominees, two are Spider-Man films two are Bond films and seven of them are Harryhausen films.\n\nThere are three Oscar winners (Guns of Navarone, Marooned, Spider-Man 2) and nine more Oscar nominees though, appallingly, none are Harryhausen films. The Fifth Element wins the BAFTA and there are 12 more nominees, including six in seven years from 2002 to 2008. 2012 earned a BFCA nom. Spider-Man 2, Casino Royale and Stuart Little 2 each won VES awards and Spider-Man 3 earned four noms while 21 total films have earned a combined 40 nominations.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nCasino Royale\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nBlack Hawk Down\n\nAnalysis: There are five Nighthawk winners (From Here to Eternity, Seven Samurai, Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Casino Royale) and 22 more nominees.\n\nThere are two Oscar winners (Close Encounters, Dracula) and five more Oscar nominees. 45 different films have earned MPSE noms for a total of 55 nominations as well as 10 awards.\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nMarie Antoinette\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nAnalysis: There are actually 10 Columbia films that earn a perfect 9 in Costume Design. The other five, in chronological order, are Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Sense and Sensibility and Hamlet. There are a total of 12 Nighthawk winners (Bridge on the River Kwai, A Man for All Seasons and Gandhi) but Munchausen doesn’t win. Aside from Munchausen there are 12 other nominees. Interestingly, Columbia has won six awards since 1989 but had no nominations that didn’t win.\n\nEleven films have won the Oscar including back-to-back winners in 1970 and 71 (Cromwell, Nicholas and Alexandra), 1992 and 93 (Dracula, Age of Innocence) and 2005 and 06 (Memoirs, Marie Antoinette). There have been 26 other nominees including four in a row from 93-96 (the first two, Remains of the Day and Little Women, are #6 at the Nighthawks while the next two, Sense and Hamlet, are winners). Eight films have won the BAFTA and there have been 19 nominees. There have been no BFCA nominees. Memoirs and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo both won CDG awards while seven others have earned nominations.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen\n\nMemoirs of a Geisha\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nHellboy\n\nAnalysis: Because of weaker years, the Nighthawk winners, of which there are seven, aren’t the same as the list above (Seven Samurai, Lawrence of Arabia, Macbeth, Munchausen, Dracula, Fifth Element, Geisha). There are 14 other Nighthawk nominees.\n\nDracula and Men in Black won the Oscar while five others have earned nominations. Tootsie, Last Emperor and Munchausen won the BAFTA while nine others have earned nominations. There have been no BFCA nominees. The Patriot and both Charlie’s Angels films won MUASG awards while Ali, Spider-Man and Master of Disguise earned noms.\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula\n\nThe Fifth Element\n\nAnalysis: Simply adding up all the points in the technical categories. Great, great technical work from these five films.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Against All Odds” (Against All Odds)\n\n“The Flame Still Burns” (Still Crazy)\n\n“El Cancion del Mariachi” (Desperado)\n\n“Separate Lives” (White Nights)\n\n“It Might Be You” (Tootsie)\n\nAnalysis: Columbia has had several films in which the song is the only aspect that earns a Nighthawk nom. Of the five films to win the Nighthawk (which includes Pennies from Heaven and Georgy Girl but not White Nights or Tootsie), only Georgy Girl earns another nomination. Of the 16 other films to earn nominations, nine of them earn no other nominations and only From Here to Eternity and Tootsie earn Picture noms.\n\nColumbia wasn’t a big Song nominee at the Academy. 33 Columbia films have earned 34 nominations but outside of the stretch where every studio earned a nomination (1938 to 1945, when it earned seven noms) and the early to mid 80’s where Columbia did well in the category (nine noms), it only earned 17 nominations spread out over 53 years. It has won the award only five times (Born Free, Way We Were, You Light Up My Life, Thank God It’s Friday, White Nights) though it won back-to-back in 1977 and 1978. All of those except Born Free also won the Globe while it has earned an additional 22 nominations. However, while it hasn’t earned an Oscar nom since 1993, it has earned five Globe noms since then. The short lived BAFTA category came during the early 80’s when Columbia was strong in this category and it earned nominations all three years (Annie, Tootsie, Ghostbusters) and won the award with the latter song. There have been five BFCA noms but no winner (none of which, of course, earned Oscar noms).\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nArthur Christmas\n\nMonster House\n\nAnalysis: Columbia isn’t a big Animated Film producer. I have seen 17 films over the years that are animated and were released by Sony. There have been two mild Japanese films (Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon, Jack and the Beanstalk), two Hanna/Barbera films (Hey There It’s Yogi Bear, The Man Called Flintstone) and several random films through the years (1001 Arabian Nights, Heavy Metal, American Pop, Care Bears Movie II, Manuelita, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Eight Crazy Nights). They released one Aardman film (Arthur Christmas) which earned Nighthawk, Globe, BAFTA, BFCA and Annie noms (and, of course, no Oscar nom). Monster House was an Amblin film and it earned Nighthawk, Oscar, Globe, BFCA and Annie noms. Then Sony began their own Sony Pictures Animation which, through 2011, has released Open Season, Surf’s Up, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and The Smurfs. None of those films reach the ***.5 threshold for a Nighthawk nomination but they have, combined, earned one Oscar nom (Surf’s Up), one Globe nom (Cloudy), one BFCA nom (Cloudy) and three Annie noms (Open Season, Surf, Cloudy).\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nInvestigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion\n\nHanussen\n\nSundays and Cybele\n\nEl Mariachi\n\nAnalysis: Columbia isn’t a big Foreign Film distributor either. I’ve seen just 37 films released in the States by Sony with Seven Samurai being far and away the best. Only six films make my cutoff (El Bruto is the other one). The first two win the Nighthawk, the next two both finish fourth, El Mariachi finishes 12th and El Bruto doesn’t make the Top 20.\n\nTwo films win the Oscar and three earn noms (Electra and Brothers Karamazov are the other two). Because of weird Globe rules and British films being distributed by Columbia, six films have won the Globe (The Best of Enemies, Young Winston, Lies My Father Told Me, Tess, Gandhi, A Passage to India) while eleven more (eight of them British) earn noms. There have been no BAFTA or BFCA noms. Of the five films to win critics awards (all of them the NBR), one is British (The Prisoner) and two are Jacques Cousteau documentaries (Silent World, World Without Sun) with the last two being Sundays and Cybele and Claire’s Knee.\n\nBest Film (by my points system):\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nAnalysis: The top four films here are among the top films of all-time, partially because of great technical work across the board and numerous great acting performances. From Here to Eternity lands fourth here while not making the Top 5 in any of the individual categories. It lands in the Top 10 in most categories but just can’t crack the Top 5 anywhere.\n\nBest Film (weighted points system)\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nFrom Here to Eternity\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nAnalysis: Age of Innocence passes Seven Samurai because of the acting which weighs more while A Passage to India finishes just three points short.\n\nBest Films With No Top 5 Finishers:\n\nHamlet\n\nAcross the Universe\n\nA Man for All Seasons\n\nStand by Me\n\nHope and Glory\n\nBoyz N the Hood\n\nThe Big Heat\n\nMidnight Express\n\nWorst Film with a Top 5 Finish:\n\nAgainst All Odds\n\nNighthawk Notables\n\nBest Film to Watch Over and Over: Dr. Strangelove\n\nBest Line (comedic): “You made a woman meow?’” (Bruno Kirby in When Harry Met Sally…)\n\nBest Line (dramatic): “The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.” (Peter O’Toole in Lawrence of Arabia)\n\nBest Opening: Closer\n\nBest Ending: The Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nBest Scene: the approach of Sheriff Ali in Lawrence of Arabia\n\nBest Kiss: Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster in From Here to Eternity\n\nBest Death: Slim Pickens in Dr. Strangelove\n\nMost Gut-Wrenching Scene: Lawrence’s realization of who must die in Lawrence of Arabia\n\nMost Heart-Breaking Scene: the end of Across the Universe\n\nBest Use of a Song (Dramatic): “The Blower’s Daughter” (Closer)\n\nBest Use of a Song (Comedic): “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” (The Big Chill)\n\nBest Original Song from a Bad Film: “Better Days” (Eat Pray Love)\n\nBest Soundtrack: Across the Universe\n\nBest Non-Rock Soundtrack: Lawrence of Arabia\n\nWatch the Film, SKIP the Book: Sense and Sensibility\n\nRead the Book, SKIP the Film: Lost Horizon (1973)\n\nFunniest Film: Dr. Strangelove\n\nBest Guilty Pleasure: The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\n\nMost Over-Rated Film: Superbad\n\nWorst Film by a Top 100 Director: North (Rob Reiner)\n\nWorst Film I Saw in the Theater: Needful Things\n\nWorst Sequel: Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo\n\nBest Sequel: Casino Royale\n\nWorst Remake: Mr. Deeds\n\nBest Remake: Hamlet (1996)\n\nPerformance to Fall in Love With: Evan Rachel Wood in Across the Universe\n\nPerformance for the 14 Year Old in Me to Fall in Love With: Alyson Hannigan in My Stepmother is an Alien\n\nSexiest Performance: Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday\n\nHighest Attractiveness / Acting Ability Ratio: Rita Hayworth in Gilda\n\nMost Surprisingly Good Performance in an Otherwise Terrible Film: Janet Suzman in Nicholas and Alexandra\n\nCoolest Performance: Daniel Craig in Casino Royale\n\nBest Opening Credits Sequence: Casino Royale\n\nBest End Credits Sequence: Across the Universe\n\nBest Tagline: “You don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies” (The Social Network)\n\nBest Trailer: Casino Royale\n\nBest Cameo: Joe Cocker in Across the Universe\n\nSexiest Cameo: Gemma Arterton in Quantum of Solace\n\nFunniest Cameo: Bruce Campbell in Spider-Man 2\n\nBest Animated Character Performance: Ashley Jensen in Arthur Christmas\n\nnote: Some of the categories that are usually here (e.g. Best Ensemble) that are covered by lists elsewhere in the post aren’t here.\n\nnote: Soundtracks I Own from TriStar Films (chronological): Lawrence of Arabia, The Big Chill, Stand by Me, La Bamba, Across the Universe\n\nAt the Theater: By the end of 2011, I had probably seen over 1000 films in the theater at some point or another and had definitely been to the movies over 1000 times. I had seen 52 Columbia films in the theater, starting with The Karate Kid Part II and including City Slickers (three times), Bram Stoker’s Dracula (twice), Spider-Man (three times), Spider-Man 2 (three times) and Across the Universe which moved me so much I wrote my first piece on this blog about it, over 10 years ago.\n\nAwards\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 237\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Oscars: 68\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 142\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 31\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 51\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 732\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 152\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Score (77)\n\nNumber of Films with Nominations I Haven’t Seen: 1\n\nDirectors with Most Oscar Nominated Films: Frank Capra / Rob Reiner (6)\n\nBest Film with No Oscar Nominations: His Girl Friday\n\nOscar Oddities:\n\nColumbia has the biggest Oscar points film ever and the #4 film but only one more in the Top 20.\n\nThe Last Emperor has the most awards for a Columbia film but only the 10th most nominations.\n\nThe only two Columbia films with more than 2 Oscars to win all of their nominations both won Picture: The Last Emperor (9 for 9) and It Happened One Night (5 for 5).\n\nThe Remains of the Day is the biggest loser, going 0 for 8 while six films for 0 for 7. Of those six films five were nominated for Picture (Pepe wasn’t) and none were nominated for Director.\n\nWhile 52.49% of all Oscar nominated films earn just one nomination, only 95 of the 237 Columbia films nominated have done so (40.08%).\n\nWhile Frank Capra and Rob Reiner have both directed six Oscar nominated films at Columbia, Capra’s films went 11 for 39 while Reiner’s went 1 for 10. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington earned more nominations (11) than all of Reiner’s combined.\n\nThe two biggest Oscar winning directors are David Lean (16 Oscars with three films) and Fred Zinnemann (14 with three films).\n\nMost Oscar Nominations\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 13\n\nOn the Waterfront – 12\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington – 11\n\nOliver! – 11\n\nGandhi – 11\n\nA Passage to India – 11\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 10\n\nGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner – 10\n\nTootsie – 10\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind / Kramer vs. Kramer / The Last Emperor – 9\n\nMost Oscar Wins:\n\nThe Last Emperor – 9\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 8\n\nOn the Waterfront – 8\n\nGandhi – 8\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 7\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 7\n\nA Man for All Seasons – 6\n\nIt Happened One Night – 5\n\nOliver! – 5\n\nKramer vs. Kramer – 5\n\nMost Oscar Points:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 675\n\nOn the Waterfront – 655\n\nGandhi – 565\n\nThe Last Emperor – 530\n\nLawrence of Arabia – 525\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 520\n\nKramer vs. Kramer – 510\n\nOliver! – 490\n\nA Man for All Seasons – 480\n\nIt Happened One Night – 410\n\nOscar Nominated Films:\n\nColumbia has three streaks of a decade or longer of having at least one nominated film: 1933-1946, 1948-1973 and 1975-1997.\n\nSince earning its first nomination in 1931, Columbia has never gone back-to-back years without at least one nominated film.\n\nThe high number for nominated films in one year is 7 in 1984.\n\nColumbia lead in 1959 with 5 films, the first year since 1933 that no studio had at least 6 films. It lead again in 1967, again with 5 films. In 1969 and 1975 it would tie for the lead (again with 5). It would tie in 1983 with 4 and lead all studios in both 1984 and 1985 with 7 and then 6. Its most recent lead was in 1993, again with 5.\n\nBecause of the late start (its first nominated film wasn’t until 1931 and its second in 1933) and because Frank Capra could only make so many films (he directed over a third of the Columbia films nominated in the 30’s), Columbia would rise briefly to a couple of ties for 7th in most overall nominated films but would mostly stay in 8th until finally passing Universal in 1966 and moving into 7th and finally catching RKO for 6th in 1970, over a decade after RKO went out of business. Even though, MGM and UA basically don’t make movies anymore, Columbia is still a ways behind both of them and mired in 6th place.\n\nBy Decade:\n\n1920’s: 0\n\n1930’s: 17 (7th)\n\n1940’s: 29 (8th)\n\n1950’s: 31 (5th)\n\n1960’s: 32 (6th)\n\n1970’s: 37 (2nd)\n\n1980’s: 37 (2nd – tie)\n\n1990’s: 29 (6th – tie)\n\n2000’s: 18 (7th)\n\n2010’s: 6 (4th – tie)\n\nTotal: 236 (6th)\n\nOscar Nominations:\n\nColumbia has lead in the total number of nominations 8 times, all between 1954 and 1987. The years were 1954 (21), 1959 (17 – tie with MGM), 1968 (19), 1971 (17), 1975 (14), 1982 (24), 1984 (24) and 1987 (15).\n\nIt rose briefly to 6th place overall in the late 30’s but only because of tracking Fox and 20th Century-Fox separately. By 1941, 20th Century-Fox had passed it (even though it started four years later). It would stay in 7th until finally passing RKO in 1962. Columbia would finally catch United Artists and move into 5th place in 2006.\n\nYears with Most Total Oscar Nominations:\n\n1982, 1984: 24\n\n1954: 21\n\n1968: 19\n\n1965, 1967: 18\n\n1959, 1966, 1971: 17\n\nBy Decade:\n\n1920’s: 0\n\n1930’s: 62 (6th)\n\n1940’s: 76 (8th)\n\n1950’s: 102 (5th)\n\n1960’s: 126 (3rd)\n\n1970’s: 109 (4th)\n\n1980’s: 114 (2nd)\n\n1990’s: 81 (5th)\n\n2000’s: 36 (12th)\n\n2010’s: 24 (3rd)\n\nTotal: 728 (5th)\n\nOscar Wins:\n\nThe longest streak of years with at least one Oscar win is 1965 to 1973.\n\nSince winning its first Oscar in 1934, Columbia has never gone three consecutive years without at least one Oscar.\n\nColumbia lead all studios in Oscars 11 times, starting in 1934 when its then 7 Oscars tied the most for a studio in a year and most recently in 1987. It lead in back-to-back years in 1953 and 1954.\n\nThe most Oscars it has won in a year is 9 in 1987, all of which were won by The Last Emperor. The Last Emperor won as many Oscars as Columbia would win in the following 13 years combined.\n\nBecause it didn’t win an Oscar until the 7th Academy Awards, Columbia has never ranked highest than a tie for 4th in total Oscars by studio and was usually 6th overall behind all the majors. By the time it passed RKO, it had been passed by United Artists and it wouldn’t pass UA until it had basically ceased making films in the early 90’s. By 1995 it had actually caught Warner Bros with 139 total Oscars but since then Warners has won 28 Oscars while Columbia has won only 15.\n\nBy Decade:\n\n1920’s: 0\n\n1930’s: 15 (3rd)\n\n1940’s: 8 (8th)\n\n1950’s: 29 (4th)\n\n1960’s: 31 (2nd)\n\n1970’s: 23 (3rd)\n\n1980’s: 26 (4th)\n\n1990’s: 9 (9th)\n\n2000’s: 8 (11th – tie)\n\n2010’s: 4 (4th – tie)\n\nTotal: 157 (5th)\n\nCritics Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Critics Awards: 72\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Awards: 36\n\nBest Picture Wins: 32\n\nTotal Number of Awards: 212\n\nCategory With the Most Awards: Actor (44)\n\nMost Awards:\n\nThe Social Network – 22\n\nKramer vs. Kramer – 12\n\nTootsie – 10\n\nA Passage to India – 10\n\nSense and Sensibility – 9\n\nMost Points:\n\nThe Social Network – 1682\n\nKramer vs. Kramer – 876\n\nTootsie – 706\n\nA Passage to India – 701\n\nSense and Sensibility – 701\n\nA Man for All Seasons – 596\n\nHope and Glory – 558\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 516\n\nAdaptation – 450\n\nMoneyball – 420\n\nHighest Awards Percentage:\n\nIt Happened One Night – 71.43%\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai – 63.08%\n\nA Man for All Seasons – 49.30%\n\nThe Social Network – 41.48%\n\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town – 37.34%\n\nOn the Waterfront – 32.02%\n\nKramer vs. Kramer – 30.83%\n\nFrom Here to Eternity – 27.48%\n\nTootsie – 25.56%\n\nAll the King’s Men – 24.36%\n\nMost Points by Critics Group:\n\nNYFC: Places in the Heart – 80\n\nLAFC: Bugsy – 270\n\nNSFC: Devil in a Blue Dress – 110\n\nBSFC: Donnie Brasco – 70\n\nCFC: Bugsy / The Fisher King / Husbands and Wives / Jerry Maguire – 60\n\nNBR: As Good as It Gets – 130\n\nGolden Globes\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 173\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Globes: 62\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 104\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 22\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 78 (36 Drama, 42 Comedy)\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 417\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 103\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Picture (78)\n\nBest Film with No Globe Nominations: Dr. Strangelove\n\nGlobe Oddities:\n\nFour films won Picture and Director before there was a Screenplay award (All the King’s Men, On the Waterfront, Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia) but only three have won Picture, Director and Screenplay (A Man for All Seasons, Last Emperor, Social Network).
