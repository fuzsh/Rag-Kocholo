Most likely, it would be Logopedia.\n\nDO NOT remove this notice once it has been placed on a page. See the Logo Timeline Wiki at risk of being shut down blog for details.\n\nGoldwyn Pictures Corporation[]\n\nBackground: Goldwyn Pictures Corporation was founded in 1916 by Samuel Goldfish (born Schmuel Gelbfisz) in partnership with Broadway producers Edgar and Archibald Selwyn using an amalgamation of both surnames to create the name (\"Selfish\" was another option). Intrigued with the company's name, Goldfish had his name legally changed to \"Samuel Goldwyn\".\n\n1st Logo (1916-1923)[]\n\nNicknames: \"The Silent/Quiet Lion\", \"The First Lion\"\n\nLogo: We see the original lion, name unknown, nicknamed \"Leo\" by Samuel Goldwyn, in the circle of a ribbon-like filmstrips which has two filmstrips flowing out the bottom side, which looks like it's in twos. Underneath the circle is a Greek drama mask. A reef surrounds it. The circle has the phrase \"ARS GRATIA ARTIS\" [Latin for \"Art for Art's Sake\"] inscribed at the top, and at the bottom is a marquee that reads \"A GOLDWYN PICTURE\". On the left side is the word \"TRADE\", and the right \"MARK\". The lion moves his head left to right throughout and does not roar, because movies did not have sound until 1923, when the name was changed. The lion then flaps his ears.\n\nTrivia: This lion was born at the Wanda and Popeye Zoo in 1900. The logo was designed by Howard Dietz, an advertising man and then-recent graduate of Columbia University, who would go on to hold many offices at MGM.\n\nVariant: There was a sepia variant of the logo.\n\nClosing Variant: Somewhere on the screen during the closing credits, we can see the small Goldwyn Pictures print logo, which consists of a lion statue resting on top of a pedestal reading \"GOLDWYN PICTURES\". We see a lion on a pedestal at the left-bottom of the screen, The film's chapter name is written at the center.\n\nFX/SFX: The lion's head moving. Still in closing variants.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The opening theme to the film or none.\n\nAvailability: One of the rarest logos ever, as many films by this company, Metro Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Pictures were destroyed in the 1967 MGM vault fire. Can be seen on early Goldwyn Pictures movies, especially on Silent Sunday Nights on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n2nd Logo (1921)[]\n\nNickname: \"The Still Lion\", \"The Painted/Strange Lion\"\n\nLogo: A still painting of a lion (name of the lion unknown), and the film ribbon and drama mask can barely be seen. The words \"TRADE\" and \"MARK\" still appear on either side of the lion. The words \"A Goldwyn Picture\" appear above the lion in Old English font.\n\nTrivia: This lion was born at the Boy and Fairy Zoo in 1904\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The film's opening fanfare.\n\nAvailability: Ultra rare. Only known to appear on What Happened to Rosa. Also appears early on in the 1993 documentary Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic.\n\n3rd Logo (March 27, 1923-April 16, 1924)[]\n\nNicknames: \"The Silent/Quiet Lion II\", \"The Slightly Roaring Lion\"\n\nLogo: The ribboning and the marquee look the same as the first one, but with a different lion. The logo begins with the lion (name unknown, possibly unamed lion) staring to one side, then immediately skips after a second to the lion staring at the other side, then it skips to the lion looking down, turning his head, and looks at the camera. After that, he roars a bit. After a second, it skips to the lion looking directly at the camera.\n\nTrivia: This lion was born at the Annoying Orange and Fred Zoo in 1903.\n\nVariant: Due to the other films being lost, there are 2 films that have 2 tints, one is sepia, and the other one is blue/ivory.\n\nFX/SFX: The lion moving.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None, or the opening theme to the film.\n\nAvailability: Ultra rare. This, however, appeared on Wild Oranges. Retained on TCM's Silent Sunday Nights. The other film, Souls for Sale (The first film to use this logo), can be seen on YouTube and other video sites.\n\nEditors Note: Due to the logo being lost, it is badly damaged to where it skips throughout whole footage. Also two of the scenes that have the lion staring at the camera can startle a few.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc.[]\n\nBackground: In 1924, Louis B. Mayer merged his company Louis B. Mayer Productions with Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., or simply MGM. In 1969, Kirk Kerkorian purchased the company. In 1981, MGM purchased the failing United Artists and in 1982, was renamed MGM/UA Entertainment Co. On March 25, 1986, MGM/UA was purchased by Ted Turner (temporarily renaming the company MGM Entertainment Co.), but after a large amount debt, sold it back on August 26, keeping the pre-1986 MGM library. MGM was then renamed to MGM/UA Communications Co.Then, in 1990 it became MGM-Pathé Communications Co. after Giancarlo Parretti purchased the company and merged it with Pathé Communications. Due to lawsuits, it was sold back to Kerkorian yet again and the company became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1992. On April 8, 2005, a consortium led by Sony (the newly-formed MGM Holdings) bought the company. During 2009-2010, MGM had financial difficulties and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 3, 2010. After escaping from bankruptcy on December 20, 2010,Spyglass executives Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum became co-CEOs and co-Chairs. Birnbaum left on October 3, 2012, and Barber was fired in March 2018. Today, the studio's output is distributed by Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros. Pictures. As of 2019, some newer releases are distributed by United Artists Releasing, the rebranding of Mirror, a joint venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures.\n\n1st Logo (November 9, 1924-April 22, 1928)[]\n\nNicknames: \"The Silent/Quiet Lion II\", \"Slats the Lion\", \"1st MGM Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named Slats. The lion inside a newly redone film-like ribboning logo. Slats moves his head from right to left and then looks at the camera, and later looks around. The words \"TRADE\" and \"MARK\" are surrounding the circle containing Slats. Below the logo is a marquee that reads \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\". On top of the circle, the phrase \"ARS GRATIA ARTIS\" is inscribed.\n\nTrivia: Slats was born at the Dublin Zoo on March 20, 1919 and was originally named \"Cairbre.\" He died in 1936.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the Metro-Goldwyn Pictures closing logo. But in later years, it was modified, but it reads \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\", rather than just \"Metro-Goldwyn\".\n\nVariant: Slats appears to move differently on every film in which he makes an appearance.\n\nFX/SFX: Slats turning his head.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None or the music's intro.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. So far, it has been spotted on He Who Gets Slapped, Confessions of a Queen, The Unholy Three (1925), The Circle, and Battling Butler, but other MGM films have Slats replaced by Jackie.\n\nTrivia: Slats was born at the Dublin Zoo on March 20, 1919 and was originally named \"Cairbre.\" He died in 1936.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the Metro-Goldwyn Pictures closing logo. But in later years, it was modified, but it reads \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\", rather than just \"Metro-Goldwyn\".\n\nVariant: Slats appears to move differently on every film in which he makes an appearance.\n\nFX/SFX: Slats turning his head.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None or the music's intro.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. So far, it has been spotted on He Who Gets Slapped, Confessions of a Queen, The Unholy Three (1925), The Circle, and Battling Butler, but other MGM films have Slats replaced by Jackie.\n\n2nd Logo (September 1, 1927-October 13, 1928)[]\n\nNicknames: \"2nd MGM Lion\", \"The Unknown Lion\"\n\nLogo: It's nearly the same as before, but the ribboning is slightly re-done and a different lion (named Bill) appears here. The usual MGM marquee is seen below. The ribboning is white, the reef is yellow, the mask is red, and the marquee is green.\n\nTrivia: Bill was born at the WildLife Zoo in 1917.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logos.\n\nFX/SFX: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The only movies this is known to appear on were silent, so the logo either has silence or the movie's intro music.\n\nAvailability: This logo was used on early color silent films. It appeared on The Heart of General Robert E. Lee, which is currently being restored by the Library of Congress. It is also said to appear on a film entitled Buffalo Bill's Last Fight. The logo should be retained if either film is shown on TCM.\n\n3rd Logo (October 1, 1927-September 27, 1928)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Jackie the Lion\", \"1st Roaring Lion\", \"3rd MGM Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named Jackie. He is in a slightly re-done film-like ribboning logo. Jackie roars three times and then looks at his trainer. The marquee \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" is seen below, the Latin phrase is inscribed on the circle, and the words \"TRADE\" on the left and \"MARK\" on the right outside of the circle.\n\nTrivia: Jackie was born at the Miles Tails Prower Zoo in 1915. He was nicknamed \"Leo the Lucky\" because he survived several accidents, including two train wrecks, an earthquake, and an explosion inside the studio. He retired in 1931 to the Philadelphia Zoo, and died in February 1935 of heart problems. His hide is currently on display at the McPherson Museum in McPherson, Kansas.\n\nVariants:\n\nUp until 1932, there was also an extended version where Jackie roared three times, then he looks away, then turns back to the camera and then fades out.\n\nThis logo would also appear in sepia tone.\n\n1949: Silver Anniversary. There is a fancy napkin which reads \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Silver Anniversary Picture\". Jackie proceeds this. Seen on Scene of the Crime, The Doctor and the Girl, and Adam's Rib.\n\nIn later colorized versions of the logo, the ribboning is in a brownish-gold color, the reef is green, and the mask is red. Also, the NRA (National Recovery Administration, a New Deal agency that existed between 1933 and 1935) logo appears on the left side, below the marquee.\n\nThere's another color variant, like the previous mentioned logo, but with the marquee in red.\n\nThere is a variant where there is copyright information around the logo. This was seen on the Our Gang shorts \"Teacher's Pet\", \"School's Out\", and \"Love Business\", as well as the Laurel & Hardy short \"Another Fine Mess\".\n\nThis has appeared superimposed over scenes on trailers of 1930s films, such as Mutiny on the Bounty, Fury, and San Francisco.\n\nIn the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo, this logo was edited to make Jackie roar once instead of three times for the CGI filmstrip animation.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\n1928-1931: Same as the previous logo.\n\n1928-1934: Same as before, but only this time, \"The End\" is larger, and the MGM logo is smaller. Sometimes, it was customized specifically for the movie, such as Grand Hotel.\n\n1934-1950: At the center, we see the word \"The End\" in a script font, or a font that was customized for the movie, and below it is the MGM psuedo logo. In the logo's early years, the logo was placed on a statue of a lion.\n\n1949-1951: On the last scene of the film, we see the word \"THE END\", and below it is the MGM psuedo logo. Below it is the words \"Made in Hollywood, U.S.A. by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\"\n\n1951-1953: Same as before, but the movie's title appears above the word \"THE END\".\n\nFX/SFX: Jackie roaring and turning his head.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Jackie roaring. The roar always varied. From 1929-1930, Jackie's actual roar was used. From 1930-1932, starting with the film Paid, a panther's roar was used. From 1932-1953, another roar was used, which would also be used for the 4th logo. For silent films, it's the music's intro only without Jackie roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nSeveral early sound movies made in 1929-1930, like The Broadway Melody, The Single Standard, Hallelujah, Marianne, Untamed, It's a Great Life, Devil-May-Care, Not So Dumb, Anna Christie, Lord Byron of Broadway, A Lady to Love, Montana Moon, Free and Easy, The Divorcee, Redemption, The Big House, The Lady of Scandal, The Sins of the Children, The Unholy Three (1930), Our Blushing Brides, Call of the Flesh, Romance, Doughboys, Madam Satan, Those Three French Girls, War Nurse, Min and Bill, Passion Flower and New Moon, have this logo without the roar, even though the movies themselves have sound.\n\nIn the early variants of the logo, at least three different roar variations were used, some more often than the others.\n\nIn 1932, a new roar track that used the roar from the 4th logo. Used from this point on until 1956.\n\nIn the 1930s, a light fanfare composed by LeRoy Shield played under Jackie's roaring, chiefly at the beginning of the Hal Roach Studios output. In the 1940s, there was a more majestic fanfare composed by Franz Waxman heard, with Jackie roaring on some films (such as A Day at the Races and The Philadelphia Story). None for the mid to later years, as some had the intro music from any film playing with Jackie roaring.\n\nThe Super 8mm version of The Wizard of Oz used Leo the Lion's roar from the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo, Jackie roars with Tanner's roar instead of his own roaring sound.\n\nAvailability: Common. Seen on films of the era such as The Wizard of Oz, and the 1930s The Captain and the Kids cartoons. The color variant was quite rare, as colorized versions are hardly ever revived on TV or video; it is seen on the colorized version of Babes in Toyland (1934). This logo may plaster Slats on current prints of old films. In later years of the century, the clips of this logo were recycled and applied as filmstrip images for the CGI filmstrip animation on the 1993-1998 MGM/UA Home Video logo. The last films to use this logo were The Affairs of Dobie Gillis, Big Leaguer, The Actress, and Main Street to Broadway.\n\n4th Logo (November 2, 1928-October 15, 1932)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Telly the Lion\", \"4th MGM Lion\", \"2nd Roaring Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears named Telly. He is in a new re-drawn film-like ribboning of the MGM logo. He is the first of the two two-strip Technicolor lions. Telly appears with a longer snarl with two roaring sound effects. The usual MGM marquee is seen below. Everything but the lion is in a green hue.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logos.\n\nTrivia: Telly was born at the Gecko's Garage Zoo in 1921.\n\nVariants: While the logo was made in color, there is also a black and white version on The Mysterious Island. The movie was originally shot in color, but only a black and white version survived.\n\nFX/SFX: Telly snarling.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Jackie's roar. Some movies would only have the music's intro or the music and Telly's roar.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants: On Crazy House (1930), the logo has no sound.\n\nAvailability: Rare. Seen on live-action color films such as The Viking (1928), The Mysterious Island (1929), and Crazy House (1930), as well as color short films like Kiddie Revue (1930) and Over the Counter (1932).\n\n5th Logo (1932-May 25, 1935)[]\n\nNickname: \"Coffee the Lion\", \"5th MGM Lion\", \"3rd Roaring Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named Coffee. He is in a slightly re-drawn film-like ribboning and mask of the MGM logo. Coffee snarls by looking down and later roars. The Latin word is still shown inscribed on the circle. \"TRADE\" and \"MARK\" appear on different sides. The usual MGM marquee is seen below. The ribboning and reef is white, and the mask is red.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logos.\n\nVariant: There is also a longer version of this logo, as well as B&W versions. Sometimes (due to film deterioration), the logo itself might be closer or further away than usually intended.\n\nFX/SFX: The snarling and roaring. The extended version has extra snarling and a brief third roar.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Just Coffee's roar.\n\nTrivia: Coffee was born at the Cola Zoo in 1924\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Seen on several MGM's short subjects in color and animated cartoons of this era by Harman-Ising on TCM and The MGM Show on Boomerang. Also seen on films such as Roast Beef and Movies and Wild People.\n\n6th Logo (September 18, 1934-December 3, 1953)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Tanner the Lion\", \"The Angry Lion\", \"6th MGM Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named Tanner. The Latin phrase on the circle is red, the words \"TRADE\" and \"MARK\" are yellow, the red mask and the ribboning are re-drawn slightly with the color orange on certain parts on the filmstrip ribbons. The reef is yellow and on the MGM marquee, the letters \"M\", \"G\", and \"M\" are red, with the remainder of the letters in yellow. Tanner roars three times in this one.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logos.\n\nTrivia: Tanner was born at the Cat and Mouse Zoo in 1930. His roar was also frequently used as a sound effect in MGM's cartoons at the time. He died in 1956 while fighting Wanda\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a longer version of this logo. Tanner would growl first, then roar three times, then Tanner would look at the camera while having his head leaning, and would growl again, and the final roar with a gasp-like sound and a growl at the end.\n\nOn some early animated shorts, the logo has Coffee's roar track. On the first roar for Tanner, it's Coffee's second roar, followed by the third roar, and the final roar is Coffee's growl.\n\n1949: MGM celebrates its silver anniversary. This is basically the same as the version seen on Jackie's, but it's in color and Tanner proceeds this. Seen on In the Good Old Summertime, Challenge to Lassie, and On the Town.\n\nThis logo strangely appeared in black & white and with Jackie's roar due to a plastering error on a TCM Australia airing of The Hucksters. Current prints of said film have Jackie.\n\nFX/SFX: Tanner roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Some movies would feature Tanner's roar or Coffee's roar on animated features by MGM. Other live-action films would have the music's intro with Tanner roaring. For the long version, it's just Tanner roaring. During the filmstrip animation for the 2nd logo on the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo, Jackie roars once with this lion's roaring sound effect.\n\nAvailability: Common. Seen on all color live-action films such as Quo Vadis, short subjects, and animated features by MGM's \"Golden Age\", with the last films to use this being The Band Wagon, Latin Lovers, and Give a Girl a Break. The long version is seen on Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove, as well as the travelogues Holland in Tulip Time, Switzerland the Beautiful, Zion: Canyon of Color, Ireland: The Emerald Isle, and Los Angeles: Wonder City of the West. The former short can be found on the DVD release of The Gay Divorcee.\n\nEditor's Note: In terms of popularity, Tanner is pretty much tied with Jackie. Especially those who grew up on Tom and Jerry consider him a favorite.\n\n7th Logo (July 17, 1953-1956)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Jackie the Lion II\", \"Tanner the Lion II\", \"Black & White Jackie, Color Tanner\"\n\nLogo: This time, the MGM marquee has been dropped and the name \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" has been placed on top of the logo, minus the hyphens (-) in between the names. Jackie's black and white and Tanner's color. Also a Registered trademark symbol is added underneath the left side of the filmstrip.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logos. Some films replace the bottom text with the word \"A [NAME OF PRODUCER] PRODUCTION\" and below it is the text \"Released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is a short version of Jackie with the last two roars.\n\nFor the Tanner version, there are two versions. One has the ribbons in silver and the other in gold.\n\nTwo films, The Long, Long Trailer and Forever Darling, have Tanner with Jackie's roar.\n\nAnother version appears with the gold ribbon Tanner with copyright info on either side.\n\nTanner was used for a 3D version which appeared on films such as Kiss Me Kate.\n\nFX/SFX: Jackie or Tanner roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the 2nd, 4th, and 6th logos.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Seen on MGM films during this era, starting with the films Ride, Vaquero! and Torch Song. The version with Jackie first appeared on Half a Hero, released on September 4, 1953, and can also be seen on Blackboard Jungle, as well as The M-G-M Parade on TCM.\n\nEditor's Note: Obviously made for widescreen. The 3D version looks incorrectly aligned upon close inspection, as Tanner, who remains in 2D, appears to be in front of the ribboning instead of the other way around. In any case, this looks to be the start of a well-established design for the MGM logo as a whole; though the ribboning isn't gold yet, and the older lions are still in use, everything else is right in place. Jackie's color is black and white and Tanner's color is brown\n\n8th Logo (July 17, 1956-1958, March 19, 1963)[]\n\nNicknames: \"George the Lion\", \"Brief Mane\", \"7th MGM Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named George. The ribboning in the logo looks more stretched out than the earlier versions. The red mask below looks re-drawn and the reef looks more stretched out below. The color of the letters \"M\", \"G\", and \"M\" are still red, but look faded. A registered trademark symbol has been added. The first version has George looking at the camera, then turns away and starts roaring. Then he would later look back at the camera and roar again and snarl. The other would have George look at the camera first, then would roar while looking up and snarl at the end.\n\nTrivia: George was born at the Furby Zoo in 1950.\n\nClosing Variant: Same as the previous logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nThis logo would appear on either a blue or black background.\n\nThere is also a black & white variant.\n\nFX/SFX: George roaring and snarling.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Tanner's re-dubbed roar or Tanner's roar with the music's intro.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Seen on MGM films during this era, starting with the film High Society. This logo surprisingly showed up on the 1963 film Any Number Can Win.\n\nEditor's Note: George isn't as well known as the other lions, due to his brief tenure as the MGM lion.\n\n9th Logo (July 18, 1957-July 10, 1987)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion\", \"8th MGM Lion\"\n\nLogo: A new lion appears, named Leo. The script \"Metro Goldwyn Mayer\" is in a new font. The reef and the mask is redrawn once again, and the ribboning on the sides are stretched out even more. Leo roars at first, then turns his head to his right. He would roar again for the second time and look away, and would do the same thing on his third roar and would look away for the final time.\n\nTrivia: Leo was born at the Royal Burgers' Zoo in Arnhem, Netherlands. The reason why his mane is shorter compared to all the other lions is because he was the youngest at the time when he was filmed.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere is also a black & white variant.\n\nA still version exists. This was spotted on Ben-Hur.\n\nBy the 1970s, the logo looks a little more enhanced.\n\nFrom 1983-February 21, 1986 and July 10, 1987, the marquee name was altered to read \"MGM/UA Entertainment Co.\", following their acquisition of United Artists in 1981. Also, on UA releases of the era, this logo preceded the United Artists on-screen text. Starting with the release of Dream Lover on February 28, 1986, it reverted back to the name \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\". However, the MGM/UA variant appeared on the 1987 film O.C. and Stiggs. The film was originally made in 1985 and was shelved for two years.\n\nOn several home media releases from the 1980s, the logo (especially the MGM/UA Entertainment Co. version) has the sides cut off and is more zoomed in. This is due to the pan and scan nature of the releases.\n\nOn DVD copies of Teen Wolf, the fade-in is cut-off and the logo starts at the first roar.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\n1957-1959: Same as the previous logo.\n\n1958-1959: Same as before, but except this time, \"Made in Hollywood, U.S.A. by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\".\n\n1959-1970: On the last scene of the movie, we see the movie's title, then the word \"The End\", and underneath is the word \"Presented by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\".\n\n1970-1975: Same as before, but this time it lacks the word \"The End\".\n\n1975-1982: Same as before, but this time the MGM Stylized Lion print logo appeared below the name.\n\n1982-1986: At the end of every MGM/UA release, the movie's title would often appear above and below would say \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" or \"FROM\" with the MGM/UA Entertainment Co. or MGM Entertainment Co. print logo below. The Beastmaster only showed just the logo.\n\nFX/SFX: Leo roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Some movies would only have Leo's roar. Other movies would have the music's intro with the roar.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants: Tanner's roar was used from 1957-1982. The sound used is Tanner's first roar. Though for the three-roar variant, the first roar is Tanner's second roar.\n\n1957-1960: Leo roars three times.\n\n1960-1987: Leo roars only twice.\n\nThere are a few variations seen on some movies with the roar. Some have Tanner's first and second roar, while a few others have that reversed.\n\nStarting with the movie Poltergeist, released on June 4, 1982, there is a new roar track for Leo. Leo's roar track becomes a synthesized one, which sounded more polished in theaters featuring Dolby/THX sound systems. Leo's image is unchanged. Though movie trailers have the 1960 roar.\n\nAround 1985, the final part for the roar changes, ending with a growl (that appeared on Year of the Dragon, though a few films released like To Live and Die in L.A. and 9 1/2 Weeks used the 1982 track). This version would be used co-currently with the 1982 roar until around 1987-1988.\n\nBrainstorm has an edited 1982 roar. The first roar is the last roar repeated two times, and the last roar is the first roar.\n\nReckless has the growls heard between the roars muted out.\n\nOn the DVD of The Beastmaster and the Shout! Factory Blu-ray of Poltergeist II: The Other Side, it uses the 1995 roar.\n\nOn the 1994 Laserdisc release of Poltergeist, the 1994 roar track is used.\n\nAvailability: Common. Lived for 30 years.\n\nSeen on such films like Jailhouse Rock, the first two Poltergeist films, A Christmas Story, Ben Hur, King of Kings, the 1980s James Bond films Octopussy and A View to a Kill, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, among others.\n\nThis logo even appears on several MGM shorts such as a few Gene Deitch Tom and Jerry shorts, among others.\n\nThe logo is preserved on pre-May 9, 1986 films by MGM that are owned by Warner Bros. via Turner Entertainment Co. However, for releases from May 23, 1986-July 10, 1987 that still use the MGM/UA Entertainment Co. logo that's copyrighted by MGM Entertainment Co. (such as O.C. and Stiggs), the logo may be kept on or replaced with the 2001 logo on productions copyrighted to United Artists using the MGM/UA logo. Your best bet would be to check MGM/UA Home Video tapes.\n\nAlso, the 1960-1982 version was plastered over with the 1983-1986 version on Two Weeks in Another Town on an international TCM airing.\n\nThe last movie to use this logo was Walk Like a Man.\n\nThis appeared on original theatrical prints of Where the River Runs Black, but video releases replaced it with the 13th logo.\n\nEditor's Note: One of the most popular logos that exists. In fact, Leo is the most famous out of all the MGM lions\n\n10th Logo (April 3,-October 13, 1968, 1977?-1981)[]\n\nNickname: \"The Stylized Lion\"\n\nLogo: On a blue background, we see a yellow-orange outlined drawing of a unknown lion's head in a circle. Below it are the letters \"MGM\" in yellow-orange.\n\nVariants:\n\nA rare variant as the background color teal-green, the lion drawning is now white, and \"MGM\" is smaller.\n\nOn trailers for the studio's films that were released by United Artists Pictures, this logo appears (in negative) above the 1976 United Artists logo. \"An MGM Presentation\" is next to this logo.\n\nTrivia: This particular logo designed remained in use long after it was retired as an opening logo. This was used as the print logo for MGM until at least 1982. The lion graphic then became the logo for MGM Grand for many years, and later MGM Mirage. It is currently used for the logo of MGM Resorts International.\n\nFX/SFX: The simple fade-in and fade-out of the logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None, but on 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film's opening theme plays over the logo.\n\nAvailability: Very rare. It was seen only on two films: The Subject Was Roses, which is intact on its Warner Archive DVD-R release, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which had the logo edited out on most TV prints, but is preserved on DVD and Blu-ray as well as some international TCM airings and the 2018 IMAX re-release. This logo remained intact on video covers from early MGM/CBS releases. The trailer variant can be seen on the trailers for films such as He Knows You're Alone and Fame, among others.\n\nEditor's Note: Even as far as abstract logos go, the onscreen graphic feels like a wasted effort. But, at least MGM still saw fit to use it elsewhere for a long time after.\n\n11th Logo (May 23, 1974-July 4, 1975)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion II\", \"Golden Anniversary\"\n\nLogo: Same as the 8th logo, but at the top, \"Metro Goldwyn Mayer\", in the same font as the 1957 logo, is in yellowish-gold. Inside the circle is the phrase \"BEGINNING OUR NEXT 50 YEARS...\", with \"B\" a bit bigger and stretched vertically, also in yellowish-gold as Leo roars. There would be a cross fade between the phrase and Leo. Instead of \"TRADE MARK\" seen on the sides of the circle, \"GOLDEN\" is seen on the left and \"ANNIVERSARY\" is seen on the right in the same color. Leo would roar again two more times.\n\nFX/SFX: The cross-fade and Leo roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the 8th logo from 1957. As a closing logo, the closing theme with the 1960 roar track was used.\n\nAvailability: Uncommon. Seen on films such as That's Entertainment!, Mr. Ricco, and North American prints of The Wind and the Lion. Makes a surprise appearance after the Sony Pictures Classics logo on the 2006 Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD of The Passenger.\n\n12th Logo (July 20, 1984-January 18, 1985)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion III\", \"Diamond Jubilee\"\n\nLogo: We have the 1957 MGM logo, but instead, the ribboning is in gold instead of white and will remain this way from this point forward. On top of the logo are the words \"DIAMOND JUBILEE\", arched in a white font. On the circle is inscribed \"METRO GOLDWYN MAYER/UNITED ARTISTS\" in red, instead of the usual Latin phrase. The mask is re-drawn once again, with the mouth inside the mask in white, and the reef surrounding the mask is not there. Below the mask is a ribboning banner that reads \"ENTERTAINMENT CO.\" On the right side above the ribbon, there is a small trademark symbol \"TM\", and below the logo is the phrase \"SIXTY YEARS OF GREAT ENTERTAINMENT\" in white. Leo roars while there is a white spark on the letters \"M\", \"E\" and \"J\".\n\nFX/SFX: Leo roaring.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The 1982 lion roar.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nSeveral trailers use the 1960 MGM lion roar.\n\nSome trailers with this logo use the 1982 roar.\n\nAnother variant has the 1960 and 1982 MGM lion roars combined. This is seen on 2010: The Year We Make Contact.\n\nOn current prints of Red Dawn, the 1995 roar is used.\n\nOn Garbo Talks, the warped version of the 1982 roar is used.\n\nAvailability: Rare.\n\nIt's only seen on MGM releases of the era such as Red Dawn, 2010: The Year We Make Contact, The Pope of Greenwich Village, U.S. prints of Oxford Blues, Garbo Talks, Mrs. Soffel, Just the Way You Are, U.S. prints of Electric Dreams, and That's Dancing!.\n\nAll home video releases of Red Dawn have this logo intact; however, a few recent TV and streaming prints of said film replace it with the 2012 logo.\n\nMost other films from the era that use this (aside from the former two mentioned) may be intact or plastered with newer logos.\n\nThe Japanese-subtitled laserdisc release of Diamonds Are Forever from Warner Home Video has this preceding the Turning UA logo, with a textual notice reading \"United Artists Presents\" appearing in between.\n\n13th Logo (November 26, 1986-April 28, 2009)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion IV\", \"The King of the Plasters\", \"Classic Lion\"\n\nLogo: The logo is the same as the 1984 logo, minus the \"ENTERTAINMENT CO.\" banner beneath the red mask. The company name is now golden colored, and will remain this way from this point forward. The mask appears in a darker red color. Leo roars twice as usual.\n\nVariants: There are different variants through the years:\n\nJune 24, 1987-1992: There is a byline that reads \"An MGM/UA Communications company\". The byline was used intermittently from 1990-1992, including the trailer for Once Upon a Crime (another version has the bylineless logo). Films with this byline are generally preceded by the MGM/UA Communications logo, though the original VHS of Spaceballs just has the lion logo.\n\nNovember 26, 1986-2001, 2008: The MGM/UA Communications byline isn't shown. Despite general use stopping around 2001, it made a surprise appearance on WarGames: The Dead Code.\n\nAugust 4, 1993-2002: Same as above, but redone in CGI style with the coloring to the text and (R) symbol are in yellow and orange gradient coloring. Once the logo makes its way to its position and Leo roars the second time, the sparkles cover the text, symbol and the reef and then flashes to make them disappear. This version has been used as part of the animation in the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video opening logo after the roller-coaster filmstrip part with the 2nd logo on the filmstrip images.\n\n1994: 70th Anniversary logo; \"70th ANNIVERSARY\" is used. On this logo, the logo is pushed up to the top. \"ANNIVERSARY\" in spaced-out letters, wipes itself on the bottom of the logo, then \"70th\" appears. Starting with this logo, the ribbons now appear in a darker golden-brown color.\n\n1999: 75th Anniversary logo; \"75A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE\" is used. The MGM logo is once again moved up. When it begins \"75\" zooms back and rests. \"A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE\" appears. The words shine. There is a version on The World Is Not Enough without animation, except for the lion roaring, of course.\n\nJanuary 13, 2001-April 28, 2009: A \"www.mgm.com\" web address is added below the logo.\n\nOn some movies such as Wicker Park, Good Boy!, and Bulletproof Monk, the web address URL is off-center in the 2001 version.\n\nClosing Variants:\n\n1986-1987: Same as the 1982 version of the 1957 closing logo.\n\nThere's a white outline MGM print logo that would have the movie title (mainly those by 007), and would have the word \"FROM\" (for MGM releases) or \"DISTRIBUTED BY\" (for UA releases) below the title above the logo. Below the logo would be a byline stating \"An MGM/UA Communications company\", then later \"A Metro Goldwyn Mayer Communications company\". Starting in the mid to late 90s, it would say \"DISTRIBUTED BY MGM/UA DISTRIBUTION CO.\", then later \"DISTRIBUTED BY MGM DISTRIBUTION CO.\"\n\nAnother closing wouldn't have the MGM print logo seen on the end of classic movies owned by MGM. They would carry a short version of the MGM logo.\n\nThere is a short black & white version of the 1995 logo that's seen after any classic MGM-owned movie in black & white, such as those by United Artists and Samuel Goldwyn Productions.\n\nFX/SFX: Leo roaring for the normal variant, The logo moving and letters appearing on the 70th anniversary logo, and the moving, zooming, and shining.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\n1986-1988: The 1982 roar.\n\n1994-October 20, 1995 and 1997: The 1982 roar, with a more raspier sound. Sounds close to the 1995 roar, but not quite.\n\nDecember 22, 1995-: Starting with the release of Cutthroat Island, the 1982 lion track was remixed using digital audio technology which blended many roars together.\n\nA silent variant of the short version has been spotted.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn current prints and the DVD of Solarbabies, the 1985 roar is used on the 2001 logo. This occurrence also happened on foreign prints of Year of the Dragon (which MGM inherited from PolyGram Filmed Entertainment along with other Dino De Laurentiis productions from the time period) and current prints of A Dry White Season and The Meteor Man.\n\nRecent prints of Yentl have the 2001 logo with the 1982 roar, probably because the opening theme was used with the roar (some prints have the 1982 and 1985 roars combined). This also happens on the 2006 UE DVD of Octopussy, and A View to a Kill, when you turn on the audio commentary.\n\nOn the MGM Home Entertainment DVD release of Mr. Saturday Night, the theatrical trailer on the disc has the logo with the 1982 roar. On that trailer, it erases any Columbia references.\n\nOn trailers and TV spots up to the late 80s-early 90s, the earliest being Running Scared (1986), the 1960 roar is used.\n\nOn Rocky Marciano (a made for TV movie), the 1995 roar is used on the 1986 logo.\n\nOn Windtalkers and the 2007 \"Family Fun Edition\" DVD of The Pebble and the Penguin, the 1994 roar is used on the 2001 logo.\n\nAt least one airing of an MGM movie in syndication has the 2001 logo with the 2008 roar track.\n\nBandits and De-Lovely both have a low-pitched 1995 roar on the 2001 logo.\n\nAvailability: Extremely common. In fact, it's probably the most common movie logo ever (with the possible exception of the Warner Bros \"Shield of Staleness\"). The 2001 logo is the easiest to find, as it is usually the one that plasters older logos. Seen on all MGM releases of this era.\n\nThe MGM/UA Communications byline version was seen on the original VHS and Laserdisc releases of Spaceballs, Overboard, Poltergeist III, A Fish Called Wanda (also on the Arrow Video Blu-ray), Fatal Beauty, Captive Hearts, P.I. Private Investigations, and Leviathan.\n\nThe bylineless 1986 logo is seen on the original home video prints of titles such as Where the River Runs Black (plastering the 9th logo), Mindgames, Blue Steel, Quigley Down Under and Thelma and Louise.\n\nIt is also seen on the MGM DVD and Olive Films Blu-ray of Fatal Instinct, as well as the Scream Factory Blu-ray of The Vagrant.\n\nIt also makes strange appearances on direct to video material such as An All Dogs Christmas Carol, The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue, and strangely takes the place of the MGM Home Entertainment logo on VHS releases like the 1999 VHS of Black Caesar, the 1998 VHS of Napoleon, and Great Balls of Fire!\n\nThe 1994 version is seen on Clean Slate, Blown Away, That's Entertainment III, and (surprisingly) the Live Entertainment VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD releases of Stargate from (the Artisan and Lionsgate Ultimate edition DVDs use the Artisan logo).\n\nThe bylineless logo with the 1994 roar appeared on original prints of The Pebble and the Penguin, Fluke, Species, and Get Shorty, and makes a surprise appearance in full before the 2001 version at the end of current prints of the UA film Sleep with Me.\n\nThe 1999 75th Anniversary version is seen on The Thomas Crown Affair and pre-2006 prints of The World is Not Enough, though the earlier and mid versions are usually replaced by the 2001 logo like on the Ultimate Edition DVD and Blu-ray release of the latter. Again, see the MGM/UA Home Video and MGM Home Entertainment tapes, along with some early DVDs from them.\n\nThe silent version is seen at the end of network prints of Topkapi.\n\nThis replaces the 1981 Columbia Pictures logo on releases of MGM owned Castle Rock/Nelson films such as When Harry Met Sally..., Lord of the Flies, Misery, and City Slickers.\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear on Red Dragon.\n\nThis logo was used on trailers on post-2008 Sony/MGM releases up to Zookeeper, though it made its last theatrical appearance on Igor, released on September 19, 2008 and was finally ended on the TV movie Legally Blondes.\n\nInterestingly, the 1988 video release of Willow from RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video (now \"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment\") retains the bylineless logo with the 1982 roar.\n\nThe 2001 variant appears at the start of some early Sony Blu-rays, in addition to some early Fox Blu-rays of catalog titles, including the Man with No Name Trilogy box set, and the 2013 German Tobis Home Entertainment Blu-ray of For a Few Dollars More.\n\nThe 1995 version was seen (between the 2006 Lionsgate and in-credit Carolco logos) on the Blu-ray and Lionsgate YouTube copy of Cutthroat Island, while the original video releases omit it and go straight to then-credit Carolco logo.\n\nIt can also be seen on the direct-to-video film Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids (though only on the American release, the Canadian release doesn't have a logo).\n\nFor some reason, the 2001 version also appears on MGM-distributed releases of the DIC Movie Toons, like Groove Squad.\n\nThe 1995 version was spotted on the early DVD releases and at the beginning of a few older episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants on Cartoon Network, Boomerang and KidsClick. At least one episode had the 2001 logo.\n\nEditor's Note: Like the 9th logo, it's one of the most popular logos ever. Some people don't like the 2001 website variant of this logo, due to its over-common presence and usage of plastering old logos.\n\n14th Logo (November 14, 2008-March 16, 2012)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion V\", \"Modern Lion\"\n\nLogo: The text, ribbons, and mask, along with its reef, are now all in a lighter, more metallic-looking shade of gold. The web address below the lion now reads \"MGM.COM\". Leo roars twice as usual.\n\nTrivia: This logo was actually based off the print MGM logo that's seen on the MGM Home Entertainment/MGM DVD print logos as seen on VHS and DVD covers and other MGM merchandise. The gold mask seen on this logo looks similar to the one in the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video logo. The footage of Leo in this logo is actually taken from a negative master of the 1958 film Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, because the original 1957 3-roar footage was believed to be lost. Leo was then given an HD enhancement, his mane and ears digitally remodelled to remove film fuzz and blemishes. They were also made to overlap the film ribbons in order to give the logo more depth. More info on the project here.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the closing variant and in 2009 on cable broadcasts (otherwise the MGM Television logo), there is a bright gold logo.\n\nThere is also a longer variant that is basically a 3-lion roar restoration, which was not seen on films at all.\n\n2010-: A closing variant appears at the end of Hot Tub Time Machine and some catalog titles, in which the words \"DISTRIBUTED BY MGM DISTRIBUTION CO.\" appear in place of the URL. On a recent WGN airing of Mr. Mom, a slightly different font is used.\n\nStarting in 2011, the logo began appearing without the URL. It first appeared on The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice in 2010. Then it made an appearance on a behind-the-scenes video of Zookeeper found on the MGM website, as well as the trailers for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 21 Jump Street and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Oddly, the roar track is not used on the former two trailers, though it is heard on the latter. The logo made its first appearance on a theatrical release with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nFX/SFX: Leo roaring. This version was created by Pacific Title.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nNovember 14, 2008-February 6, 2009: A new roar sound bite that also has elements of the 1995 MGM lion roar and is more powerful than its predecessor. This was also used on the trailers for Fame and Hot Tub Time Machine.\n\nJune 12, 2009-March 16, 2012: The 1995 lion roar is used.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants: The roar track is muted on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nAvailability: Common. This logo is found on Quantum of Solace, Valkyrie, The Pink Panther 2, The Taking of Pelham 123, Fame, Hot Tub Time Machine and Zookeeper. Also, some movies owned by MGM when aired on cable and Pay TV may plaster older logos with this. On the non-US version of Valkyrie, it precedes the 1994 20th Century Fox logo. On TV broadcasts of various MGM movies, the MGM Television logo is at the end. The last movie to have this logo was 21 Jump Street.\n\nEditor's Note: The history of this updated logo's creation is actually rather interesting. Although the 2008 roar track was wasted. Why even make it if they decided to stick with the 1995 roar?\n\n15th Logo (August 8, 2012-)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion VI\", \"Zooming Ribboning\", \"The Lion's Eye\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, we see flickers of light. The image pulls back to reveal that it is a pupil, a close-up of Leo's eye. We then see Leo, the ribboning, mask and the words \"TRADE MARK\" on both sides (from the previous logo, all in gold and metallic) ease back with the ribbons moving, as \"Metro Goldwyn Mayer\" appears shimmering and eases itself above the ribboning. The company name is darker and appears to have a \"shining\" effect applied to it. The mask is also different as well. Leo roars as this happens.\n\nTrivia: The logo was designed by LA-based graphic design company Shine.\n\nVariant:\n\nOn the game 007 Legends and Skyfall, the logo is darker and appears more golden. The flickers of light at the beginning are not seen.\n\nIn the end of some films, the logo is still.\n\nA short version at the end of the films, such as Spectre and the 2014 Blu-ray of The Terminator, exists.\n\nOn the iTunes print of Spaceballs (which features a new 4K remastered transfer), the logo starts later when the ribbons zoom out and Leo starts roaring. This oddity is most likely a sloppy attempt to plaster the 1987 variant of the 13th logo with the MGM/UA Communications byline.\n\nOn some films, the movement of Leo's eye varies. Sometimes it looks straight at the camera, and other times it moves as if Leo was looking around, either once or twice.\n\nA prototype version existed in 2011 where we zoom out of one of the ribbon holes where the lion is shown looking, then roaring in the circle. The finished product is more golden. It was said to be animated by Baked Studios.\n\nFX/SFX: The camera zooming from Leo's eye, Leo roaring, the ribbons, and the studio name.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The 1995 roar is used, along with whooshes throughout the animation and the sound of a running film projector before the lion roars. The noise dies down after the first roar. There is also an extra growling sound added after the second roar.\n\nMusic Variants:\n\nOn the Skyfall teaser trailer, there is a shortened version of the roar.\n\nThe version seen on Shine's website has the standard 1995 roar without any additional sound effects. This audio variant is also present on the iTunes print of Mad Max (which features a new remastered 4k transfer sporting this and the 1970s AIP logo).\n\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and 22 Jump Street have the opening theme to the film without the whooshes and projector sounds, just the roaring. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters and Spectre have the opening theme of the movie with the whooshes and projector sounds and the roaring.\n\nG.I. Joe: Retaliation has the 2008 roar track.\n\nNone for the still variant.\n\nA strange reverse plaster with the MGM/UA Home Video logo was found on a Portuguese dub of Exterminator 2. This can be seen here.\n\nThe prototype version has a fanfare with a different arrangement of the roar.\n\nAvailability: Common. The logo first appeared on the teaser trailer for the James Bond film Skyfall, and made its first appearance on Hope Springs (albeit in a shortened version). Appears on recent films such as Skyfall, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, among others. This also makes an appearance (in full) on Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of James Bond and the MGM 90th Anniversary trailer promo. The full version can currently be seen on Shine's website. This also appears before the Orion logo on the 2013 remastered Blu-ray releases of The Terminator and the original RoboCop, and before the UA Ovoid on the 2016 remastered Blu-ray release of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's also seen replacing the Samuel Goldwyn Company logo on the Olive Films DVD/Blu-ray of Rock-a-Doodle.\n\nEditor's Note: A great effort to modernize the MGM logo. The moving filmstrips as well as the zooming out from the eye is a great touch to actually give the MGM logo a little more substance. However, the size of the ribbon is off-putting, as Leo's head doesn't fit in the circle anymore.\n\n16th Logo (March 8, 2021-)[]\n\nNicknames: \"Leo the Lion VII\", \"Zooming Ribboning II\", \"Art for Art's Sake\", \"CGI Lion\", \"The Lion's New Design\", \"Animated Lion\"\n\nLogo: On a black background, a golden, rounded square passes by, bringing in a bright light. Another square passes while we zoom out through another to reveal we were inside the golden filmstrip ribbon. The ribbon zooms out and settles in place, this time reading \"ART FOR ART'S SAKE\" (the English translation of the usual \"ARS GRATIA ARTIS\"). A bright light is seen filtering out of the words in the ribbon, filling it with gold. By the time the light fades away from the right, the ribbon gains an extremely shiny metallic luster and the English translation changes back to its familiar Latin version. The ribbons on either side of the circle unfurl into their familiar form as Leo (now an updated, photorealistic CGI rendering of him) fades in and roars. The mask (once again redesigned, with a solid mouth this time) and leaf-like design around it grow and fade from the darkness, and the company name zooms out (just like the previous logo) and shines on top of the ribbon, with \"TRADE MARK\" fading in shortly after. The entire logo has a subtle, faint golden shine all around it.\n\nTrivia: The logo was designed by Baked Studios.\n\nVariant: A short version exists starting when Leo appears. The golden filmstrip ribbon forms a lot faster, the company name zooms out faster, and Leo roars once in this variation. This can be seen at the beginning of MGM's clips, trailers, and compilation videos on their official YouTube channel. This was also used as the basis of the MGM Television logo.\n\nFX/SFX: The ribbon settling in place, the \"Art for Art's Sake\" reading turning to Latin when painted gold, Leo himself appearing and roaring, and the text zooming out. It's all done in absolutely exceptional and breathtakingly beautiful CGI animation.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A majestic orchestral fanfare and a single drum beat plays in the beginning (notably marking the first time the MGM lion's roar has been complimented with a proper fanfare), which ends in a somber, violin-esque descent as the 1995 roar track caps it off.\n\nAvailability: Brand new. It was first uploaded to MGM's official YouTube channel on March 8, 2021, and debuted on Respect, released on August 13, 2021. It's expected to be seen on future releases from the company, like Flag Day, Candyman (2021), The Addams Family 2, No Time to Die, and House of Gucci. As of this writing, this logo is used in tandem with the previous logo, though that may change in the pacifiable future.\n\nEditor's Note: The CGI Leo could take some time to get used to and those who prefer the previous logos may also be annoyed. Nonetheless, it's a stunning update to the MGM logo everyone knows and loves, especially since the 100th anniversary is approaching. The English translation of the Latin phrase is also an excellent touch alongside the beautiful fanfare.\n\nCopyright Stamps:[]\n\nHere is some information about the copyright stamps on the MGM films:"
