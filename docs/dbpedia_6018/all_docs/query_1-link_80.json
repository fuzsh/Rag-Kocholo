Finding himself more comfortable with a lion than a lady, Griffin decides the only way to get a girl in his life is to leave the zoo and find a more glamorous job. The animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored code of silence and reveal their biggest secret: they can talk! To keep Griffin from leaving, they decide to teach him the rules of courtship – animal style. The film also stars Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb and features the voices of Cher, Nick Nolte, Adam Sandler, and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nDirected by Frank Coraci with a screenplay by Nick Bakay & Rock Reuben & Kevin James and Jay Scherick & David Ronn, ZOOKEEPER will be in theaters July 8, 2011. This film has been rated PG by the MPAA for SOME RUDE AND SUGGESTIVE HUMOR, AND LANGUAGE\n\nABOUT THE ST.
