This plunges the animals into chaos and they soon begin…to talk!\n\nHelping James with the comedic heavy-lifting are Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb, with Sylvester Stallone, Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, Jon Favreau, and Cher providing voices.\n\nThe initial teaser is a tad low on the old yuks but chances are that will improve between now and the July 8th release date.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn Zookeeper, the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo love their kindhearted caretaker, Griffin Keyes (Kevin James). Finding himself more comfortable with a lion than a lady, Griffin decides the only way to get a girl in his life is to leave the zoo and find a more glamorous job. The animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored code of silence and reveal their biggest secret: they can talk! To keep Griffin from leaving, they decide to teach him the rules of courtship – animal style. The film also stars Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb and features the voices of Cher, Nick Nolte, Adam Sandler, and Sylvester Stallone."
