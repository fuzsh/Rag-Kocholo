        "text": "Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) and news media organization Guardian Media Group (Guardian) have today announced appointments to the team leading their strategic creative partnership. The deal, announced in November 2023, will see SPE gain exclusive first access rights to the full range of the Guardian’s global journalism, with the aim of developing suitable materials for audio-visual adaptation.\n\nTara Bohn joins as head of global content development for film and TV and Lindsay Poulton is appointed as editorial director, film and TV.\n\nPrior to taking up this role, Bohn has had a successful career building and managing premium content slates as a producer, as well as a studio and network executive. Most recently, an executive on Amazon Studios’ Series team, where she worked across development and current series domestically and internationally, including: Reacher (Skydance); Carnival Row (Legendary); The Outlaws (BBC/Big Talk), and Nine Perfect Strangers (Fifth Season/Hulu). She has also worked closely with SPE on projects such as The Good Doctor (ABC) and The Scandal Anthology (BBC/Prime), among others.\n\nPoulton is the Guardian’s first editorial director, film and TV and will represent Guardian journalism and core editorial purpose in the partnership as the organization extends its presence into the global film and TV industry. Alongside this expanded focus, she continues in her role as head of documentaries, commissioning and curating the Guardian’s documentary strand, building on the huge success she has achieved, including the Oscar-winning Colette and BAFTA-winning The Black Cop.\n\nThe team brings together leading production development and journalistic experience, and in partnership with Sony’s film and TV talent, Bohn and Poulton will build the right strategic approach to find the most powerful ways to adapt stories for the screen rooted in Guardian journalism and ethos. Both new roles will be based at the Guardian’s London HQ.\n\nBohn says: “I am honoured to lead global film/tv content for this exciting new venture. In a rapidly shifting entertainment landscape, IP adaptations have become an essential and steadying force. This partnership is poised to emerge as a key leader in that space. With the Guardian’s trailblazing work and talented team, including Lindsay, combined with Sony’s powerhouse creative, I am confident we will deliver culturally defining content across all genres and formats to millions of viewers worldwide.”\n\nPoulton says: “I’m delighted to lead editorial strategy and representation across our film and tv partnerships and productions, and to embed this exciting new collaboration with Sony in the Guardian’s distinctive ethos and purpose. We are renowned for our agenda setting journalism and I’m excited to extend the impact of that work in imaginative new ways. Working alongside Tara and in deep collaboration with Sony’s creative talent, I’m thrilled to be part of this brilliant team as we bring powerful new stories to the screen.”\n\nMatthew Justice, EVP U.K. and Europe, Sony Pictures Television, says: “It is fantastic to have Tara and Lindsay bringing their pedigree and experience to lead this collaboration. Tara has an incredible eye for projects which find acclaim and audiences the world over. Coupled with Lindsay’s journalistic expertise and the sheer wealth of stories available across The Guardian’s output and archive, it’s tremendously exciting to announce this top team to take our collaboration forward.”\n\nKeith Underwood, chief finance and operations officer, Guardian News & Media, says: “We are delighted to have appointed Lindsay and Tara. With leaders of this calibre and experience spearheading our strategic creative partnership with Sony, we are very excited to see the high quality projects they bring to fruition.”\n\nAbout the SPE and Guardian partnership:\n\nThe collaboration spans the whole of SPE’s television production groups, from its U.S. scripted and non-fiction television divisions, to international production, which includes scripted companies Left Bank Pictures, Bad Wolf and Eleven, and unscripted, sport and factual entertainment producers such as The Whisper Group. As well as television, the agreement spans SPE’s feature film division, which includes labels such as 3000 Pictures, Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures and Screen Gems.\n\nUnder the deal, SPE will have access to the Guardian’s current and developing news stories, and to the Guardian archive, containing 200 years of history across articles, blogs, columns, videos and podcasts.\n\nThe deal builds upon the Guardian’s growing reputation in the TV and film sectors. The company was the first ever newspaper organization to pick up the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short for the film “Colette” in 2021, following a nomination in the same category for the film “Black Sheep” in 2019. In addition to recent deals with the BBC, Netflix and Sky, they have a slate of other projects in development in the U.K. and U.S., and three option deals with SPE that will launch the new collaboration.\n\nAbout Sony Pictures Entertainment:\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Sony Group Corporation. SPE’s global operations encompass motion picture production, acquisition and distribution; television production, acquisition and distribution; television networks; digital content creation and distribution; operation of studio facilities; and development of new entertainment products, services and technologies.
