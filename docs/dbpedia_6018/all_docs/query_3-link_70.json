Credits cannot be used for Home Premiere movies.\n\nUsers who purchase an eligible device or participate in an eligible promotion can qualify for movie credits. Your eligibility for and use of Movie Credits is subject to the terms of any applicable promotion and the Sony Picture Core terms found here: https://www.sonypicturescore.com/termsofservice/EN/CA.\n\nNote: If you think that you are entitled to credits and have not received credit(s), please reach out to our Customer Service team.\n\nUsers who participate in an eligible promotion can claim their credits in one of the following ways, depending on the details of the offer:\n\nLaunch the Sony Pictures Core application on PlayStation, click the highlighted MY LIBRARY icon in the navigation menu, and claim your credits within that tab.\n\nFor some offers, a credit voucher code will be emailed to your Sony Pictures Core associated email. Navigate to account settings in the app and – under the “Redeem Voucher” tab – enter the voucher code found in your email.\n\nNote: Once Credit(s) are claimed, the number of credit(s) will be updated within the ticket icon in the bottom left corner of the application.\n\nIf a refund is issued for an item purchased as part of a promotion that awards movie credits, the associated credits will be removed alongside the refunded item.\n\nNote: If you have had your credit(s) removed and think that you should have credits, please reach out to our Customer Service team."
