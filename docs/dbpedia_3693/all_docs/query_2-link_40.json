        "text": "As the leader of Professional Fighters League, I meet often with the top executives of all the media companies, which provides me insight into their current thinking, where the sports media rights world is going, and the likely winners and losers in the media marketplace. Those who follow me, know that I have long predicted something like today’s brilliant deal by both Netflix and WWE. First, I have said Netflix would enter live sports big in 2025. Second, I have said the major platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Apple are most interested in “non traditional” sports which have young audiences and where worldwide rights can be acquired. NEXT key media rights to watch - MMA. 👊 1. MMA fans are proven to drive streaming subscribers. 2. MMA fans used to paying for content (given PPV). 3. MMA fans are highest lifetime value (youngest demo). Today: ESPN has ALL MMA . . . UFC and PFL. Tomorrow: Which media companies will get UFC and PFL? 🤔 Amazon. Netflix. Apple. Peacock. MAX. Paramount. ESPN. 7️⃣ media companies. 2️⃣ MMA opportunities. MMA is the ONLY major sport that media companies can own ALL (no split packages, no shared rights) to differentiate. Who wins? Who loses? Will be very interesting . . . 🤨\n\nNetflix's recent deal to stream WWE matches looks like the streamer's first big move into licensing live sports rights, but that's not how the company sees it. Head of nonfiction sports Gabe Spitzer told me, \"We are not into licensing live sports rights at this point.\" He added that the WWE deal “is more of a pure licensing play, and we license things all the time,” comparing it to TV law drama \"Suits.\" “It’s sports entertainment, and that’s even what WWE says as well,\" he said. \"I wouldn’t say it fits necessarily one side or the other.” His position on the matter helps Netflix avoid acknowledging any interest in high-profile leagues like the NBA, as is rumored to be the case. It also raises the question on whether scripted fights are \"sport.\" Nevertheless, the steps Netflix is taking could be useful preparation for the future. “There’s a general expectation that at some point—not tomorrow, but in a few years—they will have to consider [broadcasting major sporting events],\" AllianceBernstein analyst Laurent Yoon told me. “They need to start thinking about this because it’s not something they can do right away.\" Feels a bit like Netflix's current live events are practice for what's to come, eh? Read on for more on why Netflix doesn't need major sports right now, why other streamers do, and why WWE is a play for growth outside the U.S., for Fortune:\n\nGet ready, folks: some day the Super Bowl will leave linear TV and become a livestreamed event exclusively. The Netflix/World Wrestling Entertainment deal is just another sign of where live sporting events are headed. Only a few months after Netflix dipped its toes into live sports, the company signed a $5 billion deal to become the exclusive home of WWE’s “Raw” from January 2025 onward in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Latin America. This means the WWE’s flagship show will leave traditional television for the first time in 31 years. When you consider the deal in context of the National Football League moving its programming over to Amazon, Peacock, and YouTube, I think the writing is on the wall: eventually premier sporting events like the Super Bowl and World Series will follow the advertising money and leave linear TV. The New Hollywood streaming companies will gobble them up. As it stands, the NFL recently tested the waters by streaming a playoff game exclusively on Peacock, which became the most streamed live event in U.S. history. “Raw” is scripted entertainment, but it’s a de facto live sporting event – three hours of action-packed wrestling comin’ at ya. It’s the top program on the USA Network, with more than 17.5 million unique viewers. But it’s more than entertainment and sports. It’s culture. WWE helped big name such as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, John Cena, and “Stone Cold” Steve Austin transcend become cultural icons. And Netflix prides itself on being a culturally relevant brand. Netflix has been a follower in live sports compared to its New Hollywood rivals. But all that changed when Netflix introduced an advertising tier. Advertisers love live sports, which attract engaged, loyal fans who provide plenty of opportunities for targeting advertising. Live sports programming has been on the rise while non-sports content has been in decline on linear TV. While Netflix competitors have been paying for coveted NFL programming, Netflix has found its own play with “Raw.” (Netflix and the WWE say that “Raw” is one of best performing shows in the 18-49 advertising demographic.) Competitor Peacock has a deal with WWE to livestream “Royal Rumble” and “Wrestlemania” until 2026 – and now Peacock has to worry about Netflix snatching up those assets. But New Hollywood is no longer in a position to keep piling on the content. A new era of cost consciousness means that streaming companies are making either/or choices. In 2023, Netflix released about 130 fewer programs last year than in 2022 (a 16 percent drop across its films, TV shows, and specials). So far, the scaling back has not hurt subscriber growth, and Netflix programs such as “Beef” are enjoying major critical accolades. In the future, Netflix continue to gobble up live sports and have its “Beef,” too? #Netflix #Sports #WWE #LITrendingTopics #TheInsider #Streaming\n\nNetflix: ‘We’ll never show live sport’ Also Netflix: ‘Oh by the way we're spending $5 billion on WWE.’ So why the massive U turn? When the reality changes, big companies quickly change their mind. Netflix are spending big on sport for 5 key reasons: ➡ Live sport is magnetic for advertisers. Live sport is ‘must watch’ and big sporting events are by far the most watched programmes on almost all linear TV channels in all countries. Advertisers love putting their brands into big sporting occasions. ➡ Their advertising growth has been weak and needs a boost. Netflix with ads is 1 year old and has just 23 million global subs. Advertiser take-up has been muted as Netflix slowly ramp up. With Prime Video now entering the market, they need momentum. ➡ Their closest competitor is investing heavily in live sport. Amazon has cricket NFL, NBA, rugby and Premier League football. Netflix needs to compete. ➡ Attracting a younger audience. Around 30% of signups to sports streaming services and viewers of big sports events are in 18-34 age range. This is the demographic that is both sought after by advertisers but also hardest to reach. Netflix will now give itself an immediate growth opportunity in this demographic. ➡ Wrestling brings a guaranteed army of fans with deep pockets. Choosing WWE is very strategic. Many wrestling fans would tend not to overlap with other sports fans, but are highly engaged and spend heavily on following their sport. This will drive major subscriber numbers for Netflix. The streaming wars are just heating up!\n\nPulling A Live Audience In The Era Of Social & Streaming... In our era of social and streaming, “live” entertainment moments are significantly less common than they once were in the era of network TV. As streamers seek to justify subscription value, we see a growing number of platforms experimenting with the value of live Entertainment events – from supplemental Sports coverage, to Comedy specials, Concerts and much to be expected in the coming year, Political coverage. This past week, Wrestlemania 40 broke Peacock’s record for most watched live Entertainment event ever, reporting over 660 million views consumed over the two days. In case you missed it, Netflix signed a $5B deal to acquire the rights to WWE Raw, Wrestlemania, and Smackdown, starting in 2025. Though maybe only exciting news for wrestling fans, it’s a broader trend signal in the industry where live Entertainment may become more of a competitive tactic to deepen the relevance of a platform in the streaming routine of subscribers with access to many. Outside of Sports, pulling live audiences is extremely challenging in our culture of on-demand Entertainment. As a result, it’s worth looking closer at how Wrestlemania 40 managed to grow its live audience YOY with a campaign narrative that outraged core fans with uncertainty and transcended the coverage of the sport entirely. The connected campaign story is an inspiring case study across talent, press, and platform support, for any upcoming live event marketing campaign: • April 2023: Fan favorite, Cody Rhodes loses the final match in Wrestlemania 39 • Spring 2023: Fans rally for a rematch between Rhodes and his opponent for next year’s event, unanimously deciding a year out that he’s overdue for the victory • July 2023: Peacock rolls out a documentary on Cody Rhodes, “American Nightmare: Becoming Cody Rhodes”, driving investment in the story among broader audiences • September 2023: Dwayne The Rock Johnson makes a surprise appearance back into wrestling for the first time in 4 years, adding uncertainty to assumed storylines and outcomes • January/February 2024: Core fans mobilize in support of Cody Rhodes to make sure his rematch is not derailed by superstar The Rock’s return to wrestling. The controversy boils over into broader pop culture coverage • April 2024: The campaign unlocks interest from core and reach audiences, versus simply bringing back last year’s viewers to “finish the story”. Wrestlemania 40 sees 140,000 in live attendance while garnering over 660M streams\n\nNetflix Spikes the Football: Behind Its NFL Megadeal Netflix Spikes the Football: Behind Its NFL Megadeal \"I think the platform and the technology gives you a way to communicate with the fans we weren't able to do in the past\" \"I think the creators bring a completely different perspective, and when they do that, I think it helps people enjoy the game more\" Netflix laser-focused on engagement and time spent, the deal is only too logical--upcoming Mike Tyson-Jake Paul boxing match \"could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and Netflix's large global subscriber base\" next year, Netflix kicks off its 10-year, $5 billion deal with the WWE for Raw, its closest thing yet to a long-term sports rights package \"We believe today's announcements show solid progress in the multi-year journey toward a scaled advertising tier, and highlight Netflix's growing focus on differentiated live content\" adding that he believes it will drive both subscriber growth and ad revenue NFL global expansion a top strategic priority, with games this season being played in the U.K., Brazil and Germany. Netflix is the largest subscription streaming service in the world, with scale on nearly every continent \"It's a global opportunity for us where I think we'll speak to fans in a unique way\" … is keep some of our inventory to deploy strategically and make sure we're thinking about where the future of media is going, where our fans are spending their time, and able to evolve and innovate in the course of these longer-term deals\"\n\nI'm at ADWEEK Outlook today and spent the morning listening to John Halley, President, Paramount Advertising and Mary Ann Fitzmaurice Reilly, SVP, Head of North American Marketing, at Visa talk about the importance of live sports events in advertising. For the record, CBS has the Superbowl this year. Reilly quoted a stat this morning that I hadn't yet heard before that intrigued me: National Football League (NFL) Games made up 93% of the most watched linear TV programs in 2023. There's not many programs of any kind on any platform that coalesce appointment viewing like this...so you know...that's impressive. This morning, Netflix made its biggest entry into live sports with the WWE planning to air \"Raw\" globally next year, in a 10-year deal valued at $5B. Netflix will also become the home of all WWE specials outside of the U.S. with TKO Holdings selecting the platform due to its global penetration, which absolutely makes sense. This in turn will provide Netflix with 3 hours of programming weekly, which should help keep that golden churn number even stronger with those key demos. If you've read Tinderbox, about the origin story of HBO, you would know that live sports coverage was an important differentiator in the story of the channel. It's clear that sports will continue to hold a very important place in popular culture, specifically in live appointment viewing. Even though I'm not a wrestling or football fan, I am cheering on those folks that are as its one of the last vestiges we have of group viewing left. 📺 #wwe #netflix\n\nAs an entertainment attorney and former talent agent, I have always been a fan of how Endeavor transitioned their business from talent representation to owned IP representation. I left the agency world since, although at times lucrative, the writing was on the wall, and the days of back-end deals for talent and packaging deals for shows were over. Sadly, agencies continue to go out of business, and it looks like AI will continue to draw blood from the industry as a whole. The bright spot, of course, is IP, which continues to be a money-maker. From this article, TKO (WWE and UFC) continues to grow, and TKO Group Holdings reported revenue of $614 million and adjusted EBITDA of $223.2 million, laying a roadmap for growth in 2024 and beyond as the company seeks to capitalize on its media rights renewals, as well as live events and sponsorship growth, telling investors that it is targeting annual revenue of $2.575 billion to $2.650 billion. I had to, of course, circle this back to our attempt to emulate a fraction of the success of Ari Emanuel with OutDrive GP, where the goal is to build an IP brand like WWE, anchored by live Professional versus Sim Live Racing events (like WWE Raw or UFC fights) and broadcasting this content in an exciting format (licensing the media rights to sports networks such as ESPN+). https://lnkd.in/gmN-8qen\n\nA bit surprising that it took Netflix this long to invest in the live sports streaming business. Netflix's prior sports content approach which included documentaries like “Drive To Survive”, \"Break Point\" and “Quarterback” have been hugely successful and the WWE's focus on drama and carefully curated storylines sits comfortably within Netflix's existing strategy. It will be interesting to see if they pivot into other sports at some point. But with Apple (MLS and the MLB) and Amazon Prime (NFL Thursday night football) already in long-term deals with the more popular sports within the US market, that may not happen anytime soon. The streaming landscape and sports rights market dynamics in Europe is also different. Amazon, for instance, faced intense competition in the bidding for sports rights, and the escalating costs of securing exclusive broadcasting rights and ultimately reconsidered their investment in European live sports (football), opting instead to focus on boxing in 2024. Interesting to see where they go from here."
