Despite the richness of the field of television studies, it seemed to us and to colleagues in attendance and with whom we discussed the matter that much of the work being done on subscription-based, multichannel television deserved to be collected in a form that would allow us, as scholars and as students, to examine the institutions, practices, and meanings that emerge from the hundreds of channels that are commonly called cable TV. The authors who contributed to this volume are among those established and emerging scholars working on issues pertaining to this kind of media. First and foremost, we extend our immeasurable appreciation to them. Each and every one brought enthusiasm and patience to this project, and the breadth of their collective knowledge never failed to impress us. At New York University Press, Eric Zinner and Emily Park offered confidence and guidance throughout the process; anonymous readers encouraged us with the depth and rigorousness of their critical engagement with the manuscript. Ronald Duculan, Josh Dunsby, Joy Van Fuqua, David Gerstner, Larry Gross, and Marita Sturken lent ideas and insights along the way. Cara Wallis at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Southern California was an invaluable research assistant. Colleagues at our various institutions provided untold support. Finally, we acknowledge the legions of scholars in various disciplines, many of whom are cited in this volume, whose work was foundational to Television Studies and which continues to inspire us.\n\nvii\n\nIntroduction Few technologies have been the subject of as many hopes and expectations as cable television. If one were to believe its varied advocates, cable TV could carry almost every international sports and cultural event into the home, allow retail shopping from the living room, permit instantaneous referenda on public issues, and assure emergency monitoring of fire and burglar alarms. What more could anyone ask for? —Mitchell Moss, “Can Cable Keep Its Promises?” New York Affairs 6, no. 4 (1981)\n\nCable TV, on the brink of a boom in the 1970s, promised TV audiences a new media frontier, an expansive new variety of entertainment and information choices. Cable seemed poised to provide access to a greater variety of media forms and points of view than could be found on oligopolistic broadcasting sources, as increasing channel capacity, a regulatory apparatus that had become amenable to the growth of the industry, and consumer demand for new services transformed how homes received television signals. The rapidly expanding industry appeared to lower barriers to entry, allowing independent entities to launch cable networks and allowing new media forms and programming formats to emerge and prosper. Music video, 24-hour news, 24-hour weather, movie channels, children’s channels, home shopping, and nostalgia channels devoted to programming long off-network shows were introduced. Prior to the cable boom, most homes in the United States received only a handful of broadcast television signals, which typically included, on VHF channels, the local affiliates of the “Big Three” networks, ABC, NBC, and CBS; in most markets, a PBS station; and, on the UHF spectrum, a few scattered, independent stations. Now, the majority of American homes receive not only their local broadcast signals but also dozens, even hundreds, 1\n\n2 cable visions\n\nof additional channels via cable or satellite dish.1 In 1980, 17.6 million television-owning homes in the United States, or 23 percent of the market, subscribed to cable TV.2 By June 2005, some 94.2 million households (86 percent of TV households) had come to subscribe to some form of multichannel video programming distribution (MVPD). Most (69.4 percent) were connected to cable; 86.3 percent of those cable subscribers received more than 36 channels. While the number of households subscribing to premium services (such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Encore, or Starz!) has declined in recent years (to 28.1 million, in 2004), a growing number (26.3 million homes, by the end of June 2005) subscribes to digital cable tiers that have increased channel capacity and interactive capabilities such as video-on-demand. In 2005, subscribers paid an average $56.51 per month for cable-TV only (or $70.75 when bundled with high-speed Internet access via cable modem), and industry revenue for the year exceeded $66 billion. By June 2005, 26.1 million homes (27.7 percent) subscribed to direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) television services, which compete with cable to provide much the same service via a wireless alternative technology. Non-broadcast networks now draw a greater share of the television audience than broadcast networks (for the 2004–2005 season, non-broadcast audiences outpaced broadcasting’s declining viewership, at 53 percent to 47 percent, respectively, in prime time, and an even greater share, 59 versus 41, for “all-day” viewing, over the 24-hour period).3 The distinctions and interconnections between broadcast and cable television have framed the way the cable television industry was both conceived and advertised. Indeed, the optimistic early “blue sky” era of cable television was accompanied by an ever-more cynical outlook on the overt commercialism of broadcast networks, leading to a simultaneous hopefulness and doubt about the symbolic power of television—especially as it concerned the empowerment of the viewer. While broadcast television was still held to the public interest obligations set out in the 1934 Communications Act, by the 1970s, TV seemed much more committed to a commercial system dependent on advertisers than to abstract obligations to the public’s “interests.”\n\nAcademic Attention: Cable Television Studies? The topic of cable television within academic settings is situated firmly within Television Studies. However, despite the increasing interest and sig-\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nnificance of cable television, there is still a striking absence of scholarly work on the various dimensions of the cable industry, including regulatory practices, the proliferation of channels, and actual programming. Previously, most television scholarship that has explored the implications for society of the shape of the television industry and the form and content of its programming have concentrated intensively on prime-time broadcasting and a few daytime genres such as talk shows, soap operas, and children’s programming. A number of anthologies, edited volumes, and textbooks strive with much success toward comprehensive overviews of television history and approaches to TV studies; consider, for example, Television: The Critical View, edited by Horace Newcomb, which was first published in 1976 and has subsequently been expertly and frequently updated in new editions.4 Yet volumes such as this one continue to draw most of their examples of industrial formations and programming from broadcasting’s mainstream forms, underrepresenting the extent to which multichannel video programming distribution systems (cable and satellite) have usurped broadcasting as the means by which we now receive TV and captured the majority of the audience that once clustered en masse around a handful of broadcast channels and now fractures across dozens, even hundreds of channels. There have been, certainly, a number of publications that focus on television content enabled by the rise of cable television. Several have taken the music video as their subject.5 More recently, a few authors have turned their attention to analyses of cable and satellite TV’s cultural and social alternatives.6 Other scholars have focused narrowly on particular highprofile cable series.7 This growing body of new research is a strong indication of the recent preeminence of cable programming and the beginnings of the scholarly attention it warrants. This book examines the role of cable television in this proliferation of formats and channels and in the disaggregation of a once-mass television audience, as well as considering some of the implications of these trends. In this book, we look beyond broadcasting’s mainstream, toward cable’s burgeoning alternatives, to critically consider the capacity of commercial media to serve the public interest. The essays in the book represent new work by leading and emerging scholars in a variety of academic disciplines —communication and cultural studies, film and television studies, media economics, gender studies—as well as by industry professionals. The essays that follow focus primarily on cable television within the United States, but we also include discussions of globalization within television\n\n4 cable visions\n\nmarkets as well as examinations of cable’s intersections with broadcasting, satellite television, and the Internet. The book is divided into three parts: Institutions and Audiences; Channels; and Programming. These categories are, of course, not mutually exclusive, and the chapters within each section necessarily touch on, draw from, and connect to the chapters in the other sections. For example, many essays in the Channels and the Programming sections explore the history of the networks and studios they examine. Likewise, essays in the Institutions and Audiences section address concerns about channel development and programming. In the remainder of this introduction we briefly outline some of the key elements and issues facing the cable industry.\n\nHow Cable Is Different: History and Regulations The emergence and increased installation of cable technology in the American home during the 1970s was positioned and celebrated in terms of cable’s difference from broadcast television. Cable television, it was claimed, could offer less “lowest-common-denominator” and crassly commercialized television, less intrusive advertising, and more interactivity on the part of the viewer, more viewer empowerment. In other words, cable TV would ostensibly “serve” the public interest in a way that broadcast television ignored. In fact, to some extent, the cable TV industry has brought new owners into the medium of television, upended longstanding programming traditions, and addressed audiences underserved by broadcasting. However, while offering many of these distinctions from broadcast television, cable television also shared a number of similarities with it. The cable market has been largely, but not exclusively controlled by the same powerful conglomerates that dominate other media markets; it has repeated and recycled broadcast programming concepts (and programming itself, in the form of repurposed and off-network syndicated series); and it has competed fiercely for those audiences already favored by broadcasters. Cable’s more relaxed regulatory environment and diverse patterns of ownership can be attributed directly to its distinctive origins. Broadcasting has, historically, been the most regulated arena of the U.S. media, reined in by a few not-so-little words first found in the Radio Act of 1927, which was written as powerful corporations positioned themselves to dominate the manufacture of radio equipment, the production of content, and its distribution throughout national networks. The act declared that broadcast\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nstations would be licensed (and licenses would be renewed) only if it could be determined that these stations would serve “public interest, convenience, or necessity.” This phrase was repeated in the Communications Act of 1934, in reference to both broadcasting (radio, and later, television) and telephony. The regulatory apparatus sought to shape broadcasting as a public trusteeship. Thus, a privately owned, for-profit industry was granted use of a public resource, the electromagnetic spectrum, through which its signals would be transmitted from station to listener and viewer. In exchange for access to this presumably scarce resource, commercial broadcasters would be obliged to serve the audience, even as they strived to profit by selling their audience to advertisers. That is, while the concept of public interest has never been precisely defined (beyond vague agreement that the broadcast industries should operate as a competitive marketplace and represent diverse viewpoints), broadcasting has been charged with the sometimes contradictory tasks of addressing not only the most potentially lucrative audiences but the nation as a whole, and addressing us not only as consumers but also as citizens.8 Thus it can be said that broadcasting emerged, in the form of radio and, following in the template established for radio, in the form of television, as an oligopolistic market whose players enjoyed significant market power and agreed to some constraints on the extent of that power. In contrast, as Megan Mullen shows later in this volume, cable TV, or as it was initially called, Community Antenna Television (CATV), originated in the late 1940s and early 1950s in the hands of individual, independent entrepreneurs without ties to established media corporations and with little scrutiny or regulation of their efforts. While cable television was spared the public-interest obligation and some of the specific ownership and content regulations pertaining to broadcasting, it would be misleading to characterize this market as entirely unfettered. Eventually, cable and direct-broadcast satellite television would be overseen by a combination of federal and local authorities. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sets ground rules for the kinds of franchise agreements that can be negotiated by municipalities with cable systems. The FCC has also, at times, regulated cable pricing. And the television industry, like any other, can be subject to antitrust policies of not only the FCC but also the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. However, most limitations on ownership and content placed on broadcasting are largely absent from cable and DBS regulations.9 This absence is justified by the fact that broadcasters transmit their signals free-to-air over\n\n6 cable visions\n\npublicly owned spectra, to be captured by anyone with a receiving set and an antenna. In contrast, cable and satellite transmissions are received only by those audience members who choose to bring this kind of television into their homes by making monthly payments and who typically acquire or lease special equipment in the form of set-top boxes or roof-top dishes. Cable and DBS are, in the eyes of the courts and other authorities, “invited guests” (perhaps, more accurately, hired help) that a subscriber could banish simply by unsubscribing. Given the purposefulness that is said to characterize reception of cable and DBS signals, Congress has seen fit to let the market rule without some of the constraints placed on broadcasting by means of the “public interest” clause; moreover, the courts have ruled that, unlike broadcasting, cable and DBS channels hold the same First Amendment rights as print media.10 In other words, the rules treat cable and DBS subscribers as citizen-consumers whose needs are best met by marketdriven media.\n\nInstitutions and Audiences Given its legacy from broadcast television, it is unsurprising that cable technology was characterized by both optimistic and pessimistic forecasts over the role cable would play in audience empowerment. Within the context of looser regulatory control and the installation of technologies that could receive programming delivered by satellite, the promise was that cable would address the problems that continued to haunt broadcast television. As Megan Mullen points out, early policy statements on the possibilities of cable (by, for example, the 1971 Sloan Commission on Cable Communications) associated the technology with a kind of “revolution” which could eventually “remedy all the perceived ills of broadcast television, including lowest-common-denominator programming, inability to serve the needs of local audiences, and failure to recognize the needs of cultural minorities.”11 The idealism of such a claim is quite similar to the language used at the emergence of other communication technologies: telegraphy, photography, radio, and television.12 Like these technologies, cable promised to radically revise the viewers’ relationship with media by encouraging a more active viewership and a newfound sense of political and cultural empowerment. Because cable did not use public airwaves, and thus was not regulated in the same ways as broadcast television, there were fewer constraints on its content. For instance, since cable was not\n\nIntroduction 7\n\n(initially) conceived as being dependent on advertisers, it promised to cater more to the direct needs and tastes of specific audiences through niche channels. Capable of this kind of direct audience address, cable channels were seen as possible facilitators of viewer empowerment and a potential catalyst for citizenship.13 Importantly, this was not simply an idea that circulated in the world of telecommunications policy. As Thomas Streeter argues, the enthusiastic claims about the value of cable as the groundwork for an information highway were included in the policy reports and city documents produced by government agencies and others interested in the new technology and planning for its implementation. This discourse also found its way into public and industry discourse.14 Moreover, since the burgeoning cable industry was not yet tied to major media conglomerates, it seemed to exist as a communication technology that encouraged independent entities to create networks and channels that allowed for alternative kinds of programming. As was the case with broadcast television, the technology that enabled cable was not the essential factor invoked in the public and policy discourse concerned with the revolutionary qualities of cable. As Streeter articulates, although constantly labeled as “new,” cable was not necessarily “new technology.” Rather, it was the use of this technology that was understood as novel: the increase in channel capacity and the development of a market so that more channels were available were the potential catalysts for the “revolution.” Indeed, it was precisely these “new” aspects of cable that made it “possible to speak of cable, not as an embodiment of social contradictions and dilemmas, but as a solution to them.”15 Cable was seen as a possible remedy to all sorts of social problems, such as racism and poverty, because it could “narrowcast” and thus more accurately represent an audience. And, as Streeter argues, “Cable, in other words, had the potential to rehumanize a dehumanized society, to eliminate the existing bureaucratic restrictions of government regulation common to the industrial world, and to empower the currently powerless public.”16 The chapters in Part I of this volume address the history and development of cable systems and audiences, and anticipate the convergence of digital media delivery to the home.\n\n8 cable visions\n\nChannels It is clear that the hyperbolic promise of cable was never quite fulfilled. In fact, the current structure of the cable industry resembles the familiar format of broadcast television in almost all ways. There was no televisuallyinspired “revolution,” and many cable channels and much cable programming are now owned and produced by the same transnational media corporations as the broadcast networks. However, the utopian discourse that framed the early debates on cable, especially in terms of the public interest, was essential for providing a context for channels such as CNN, C-SPAN, and even Viacom’s Nickelodeon to emerge precisely because it focused attention on television’s potential to empower viewers as particular kinds of citizens. To enforce public interest obligations would necessarily change the scope of the television industry, and it would certainly transform the dynamic among viewers, media owners, and advertisers. In part, this dynamic changed through the proliferation of channels, whereby in a few short years the cable industry has added hundreds of different channels to the television landscape. A familiar question results from this kind of quantity: is a more diverse television system such as cable capable of accurately representing different audiences and publics, or does the proliferation of channels and the concomitant increasing centralization of media ownership indicate that the cable industry is a particularly profitable site for new niche markets and the commodification of identity? Joseph Turow identifies cable as one place for the cultivation by advertisers of “primary media communities,” wherein communities of consumers are sought in order to nurture brand loyalty in a progressively more cluttered commercial landscape. Situating cable television alongside other communication technologies that are part of a new wave in marketing dedicated to narrow niche audiences and to the cultivation of “lifestyles” in lucrative consumer groups, Turow understands cable as part of a new “fractured society.” In fact, in seeing two cable channels, Nickelodeon and MTV, both owned by Viacom, as “pioneer attempts” to establish a kind of advertiser-shaped community, Turow argues that “While [Nickelodeon and MTV] started as cable channels, they have become something more. Owned by media giant Viacom, they are lifestyle parades that invite their target audiences (relatively upscale children and young adults, respectively) into a sense of belonging that goes far beyond the coaxial wire into books, magazines, videotapes, and outdoor events that Viacom controls or licenses.”17\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nCultivating this “sense of belonging”—the “something more” that constitutes a cable channel—has been a particularly successful way that cable channels have positioned themselves in the television industry, where it is not so much the programs on individual channels that are important, but the designs of the channels themselves: Nick is for kids, Animal Planet is for pet owners, Food Network is for foodies, etc. In Part II of this book, the authors look at specific cable channels as a way to parse out some of the contradictions in the regulatory history of cable—contradictions between the “blue skies” discourse that shaped the early cable industry and the intensely competitive nature of the current cable industry. As the authors in this section point out, some cable channels frame themselves according to a particular “theme,” such as animals or food; others shape their identity around particular audiences, such as African Americans, children, or Latinos. These narrowcasting strategies are implemented with varying degrees of success in meeting both cultural and commercial desires. Because cable channels often are designed to capture a part of the market share that is under-marketed, there are important ways in which cable channels “recognize” audiences that have been historically obscured by broadcast television. BET, HBO Latino, Bravo, Lifetime, Oxygen, and Logo, among others, have all tapped into consumer groups that have been underserved by broadcast channels, namely African Americans, Latinos, women, and gay men and lesbians. While this kind of recognition is crucial in a media society that often equates visibility with social value, it also works to commodify particular identities within boundaries established by cable companies. Additionally, niche channels have the tendency to marginalize distinct groups, identifying them as “different” from the mainstream (and thus deserving of their “own” channel), so that the result is not a harmonious multi-channel, multi-cultural televisual universe, but rather one in which broader audience channels continue to define the norms of representation.\n\nPrograms The optimism that propelled the growth of the cable industry over regulatory hurdles and then throughout the consumer market for subscription television was not only based on promises of a more competitive television market and more channels within that industry. It was also the\n\n10 c a b l e v i s i o n s\n\nprogramming that could be distributed via those new outlets that heralded a new era. But perhaps ironically, many of the most successful pioneering, nationally distributed cable networks (such as Home Box Office, launched in 1972; The Movie Channel, 1973; and Showtime, 1976) focused on feature films, most of which had already enjoyed theatrical releases. Others, such as ESPN (1979), offered more of already familiar content: an entire slate of sports programming, rather than the broadcasters’ few timeslots per week.18 Tried-and-true genres would be, in many ways, cable’s bread-and-butter, and channels from Bravo to TV Land would fill endless hours with off-network series, interspersed with flagship original programming. Early advocates for cable touted the use of cable systems to produce and air locally originated news in communities not served by broadcast stations. They also envisioned telecourses and other educational programming that would be provided by schools and universities, as well as healthcare information offered by professionals.19 While these kinds of programming would be part but hardly the eventual mainstay of cable, other content that had not found much of a home in broadcasting tried cable, too: religious programming; in-depth coverage of governmental functions via C-SPAN, launched in 1979, as a form of voluntary public service; and high-end arts and cultural programming.20 Innovative programming models such as these sought to serve audiences with interests and needs that had been largely unmet by broadcasting; some flourished, others fizzled. Still, continuing to be intent on attracting viewers with programming that is at least somewhat different from what can be found on the broadcast networks, cable has forged new kinds of programming that is not bound by broadcasting’s decency regulations on profanity and sexual content. In addition, cable has also come to broach controversial subjects that advertisers might shy away from in broadcasting but embrace in cable if cable links them to a niche market. These conditions, which have freed cable from broadcasting’s “lowest-common-denominator” strategies, have left it to devise tactical programming models which are examined in Part III of this volume. One of these tactics, most closely but not exclusively associated with advertising-free, premium subscription cable, is the creation of a “quality” genre, defined as adult-oriented drama with high production values like The Sopranos.21 Another tactic involves developing programming that appeals to small but avid audiences which have demographic qualities coveted by advertisers and which can easily be lured away from broadcasting with edgier programming such as Queer Eye for the\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nStraight Guy and Chappelle’s Show. Elsewhere, cable repackages old genres in new ways—as in the form of single-genre channels providing 24-hour news (CNN, Fox News Channel), 24-hour sports (ESPN, ESPN2), or even 24-hour game shows (Game Show Network)—and operates as only one prong of a multimedia blitz organized around particular media brands, such as the Worldwide Wrestling Entertainment. Each of these tactics is addressed in Part III.\n\nCable’s Contradictions The utopian visions of the early cable industry promised a different, improved, more connected television landscape. Clearly, many of those initial goals have been reshaped within the competitive media-conglomerate context, and some of the same struggles over what constitutes the “public’s interest” that plagued early broadcast television continue to have resonance in the more contemporary niche-channel cable universe. The essays in this book continue the exploration of the historical, regulatory, ownership, and programming parallels and disjunctures between broadcast and cable as well as other media. Additionally, these essays also address several fundamental questions that arise from cable’s particular regulatory and ownership histories. Primary among them is the ability of cable and satellite television to serve the public: does cable, with its loosened FCC controls on content and its move toward niche channels, reflect a public’s interest more accurately than broadcasting precisely because it is not bound by partisan regulatory policies? That is, how does cable’s largely for-profit structure impact its ability to serve the needs of the public as citizens as well as consumers and to serve us as members of both distinct niches and as members of a common society? Attempting to answer these questions definitively is a difficult task, primarily because the cable industry is thoroughly shaped by important contradictions regarding audiences, citizens, and the role of television as a kind of “public” service. Although it is this very contradictory nature of the cable industry that shapes the tone of this book, part of what we hope to do here is to recognize the symbolic power of television in terms of pleasure, of imagined community, and as a means of empowerment. At the same time, this symbolic power is always constrained by the political economy of the system, and this volume gives us a rich picture of the contradictions and complications of this media form. To this end, we interro-\n\n12 c a b l e v i s i o n s\n\ngate the potential of cable to fulfill a “public interest” and take seriously the potential of the industry that was celebrated in the “blue sky” period.\n\nnotes 1. Throughout this volume the term “cable” is often used as shorthand to refer to channel line-ups that are available both from wired cable services and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services. As several contributors illustrate, there are some important differences between the reach, costs, and offerings of cable versus satellite; however, the two provide a largely redundant channel line-up, albeit through different technologies. 2.

Regulations meant to ensure that broadcasting operates in the public interest by maintaining a competitive marketplace have included rules preventing any two of the major broadcast networks from merging; caps on the number of radio and/or TV stations that a company can own, which have been raised and in some instances removed over time; and the defunct Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which forced the networks to buy some independently produced programming. In regard to content, the FCC has obliged broadcasters to serve the public interest through the Fairness Doctrine, which required representation of opposing views in regard to controversial news and public affairs programming (rescindment of this doctrine unleashed talk radio and talking-head punditry); limits on the number of commercials per hour and commercialism in children’s programming; and rules that define and respond to complaints about broadcast “indecency” and “profanity.” 9. There are, of course, some limits and obligations placed on subscription TV. For example, cable and satellite systems are not permitted to air material that may be deemed “obscene,” but they are not at this time subject to the rules than regulate “indecent” material on broadcast airwaves. Since 1972, “must carry” rules (in continuously challenged and rewritten forms) have required cable systems to retransmit the broadcast signals of local stations, and since 1994, revisions to these rules have obliged cable systems to secure permission to retransmit local stations’ signals, usually involving compensation. The general structure of the industry and\n\n14 c a b l e v i s i o n s\n\ntechnological specifications—that is, rules pertaining to franchising, channel usage, pirated signals, consumer privacy, and other matters—have been developed in the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, and sections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (which, among other things, rescinded the 1992 Act’s rules regulating fees charged to consumers). And, since 1972, the FCC has required cable systems in at least the top 100 markets to set aside public access channels; see Felicia R. Lee, “Proposed Legislation May Affect Future of Public-Access Television,” New York Times, November 8, 2005, E1, E7. 10. See City of Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc. (1986); Turner v.

Over the last decade, cable has been joined by direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems as the primary means by which U.S. households receive television signals. This section explores aspects of the structure of this industry, which has both mimicked its predecessor and, in many ways, remade the medium of television. What are the individual and corporate entities that have sought to shape the structure of this industry? How did their distinctive means of delivering—and regulating—already available TV signals originate? What shape does the multichannel video programming delivery (MVPD) market currently take? And how does a subscriptionbased television market imagine and address its audiences differently from advertisement-based broadcasting? To answer these questions, this introduction considers some of the ways that cable TV differs from broadcasting, as well as the development and structure of the cable industry and its audiences. The MVPD industry—more commonly known, and therefore referred to here in most cases as the cable and satellite television industries—comprises a vast set of interacting institutions. It overlaps with—but is not entirely coterminous with—those that comprise the broadcast industry. Of course, within this volume, we cannot cover each and every aspect of these institutions in depth, but we can indicate their scope and scale. Companies, large and small, deliver video signals to our homes and other locations via cable or satellite. Programming services (the networks or channels discussed in Part II of this book) produce and distribute content delivered via those cables and satellites.1 Legislatures and regulatory agencies develop and carry out policies governing these industries; thus, for example, Congress writes rules that are enforced by the Federal Communi17\n\n18 p a r t i : i n s t i t u t i o n s a n d a u d i e n c e s\n\ncations Commission (FCC), and local municipalities negotiate and grant franchise rights to cable systems. These primary institutions interact with another set of institutions, some of whose involvement may be readily apparent; others, less so. Cable and satellite systems and networks depend on corporate entities, from globalized automobile manufacturers and fast-food chains to local usedcar dealers and family-owned restaurants, that advertise on cable and satellite channels; ad revenue provides an income stream that supplements the fees charged by cable systems to their subscribers and returned to the networks. Another key corporate agent, Nielsen Media Research, counts and analyzes audiences, producing data that advertisers use to identify appropriate venues in which to expose their brands and products to viewers. Some 3,000 public-access channels serve their localities by providing production facilities and airtime to community groups.2 The cable and satellite television industries also encompass independent contractors who maintain the cable infrastructure and install the devices needed to receive signals in our homes. Customer service representatives at call centers, some local, some not, handle inquires about accounts. At factories in Mexico and elsewhere, workers manufacture and assemble converter boxes and remote controls. And another key industry player, the audience, surfs the channels, watches the programs, sits through the ads (or not), and pays the bills. In short, the cable- and satellite-TV industries comprise a complex array of technologies, corporate entities, regulatory agents, and laboring bodies, as well as those at leisure. These interacting components of the MVPD industry have been deeply entangled throughout the history of cable and satellite TV. The shape of these entanglements has changed due partly to technological developments allowing for greater channel capacity, and especially to shifting market conditions, including the booming growth of media generally; trends toward globalization and concentration of ownership throughout media industries; and sometimes, actions by regulators that reconfigure the market. In the early years of television’s introduction as a commercial medium in the post–World War II period, the nascent cable industry was not so entangled with broadcasting. Rather, it consisted of bundles of wires in the hands of independent entrepreneurs who sought to hitch homes to new medium of television where geographical features interfered with broadcast signals. Geostationary satellites, which would eventually relay television content from the networks and to cable systems across the\n\nIntroduction 19\n\ncountry, did not yet exist; they would come in to regular use by the communications industries in the United States in 1965.3 But constraints on cable were not entirely technological. In the 1960s, broadcasters fought hard to stem its growth, and they convinced the FCC to ban CATV from the top one hundred markets.4 By the end of the decade, however, various advocacy groups, think tanks, and journalists embraced cable as a technology that could diversify and even democratize the media. In this so-called “blue-sky” period, proponents touted cable as a potential solution to social ills, a conduit for all manner of financial transactions, and a site that would enhance political participation. In the 1970s, when the FCC relaxed the rules that had contained cable’s expansion, the industry began a growth spurt that continued through the end of the twentieth century. Cable system operators were assigned monopoly franchise rights, cables were strung (or buried), rules were written, prices were set, audiences were imagined and courted. Established media companies—including newspaper and other publishing interests, such as Newhouse and Providence Journal, the broadcast networks (which had initially opposed cable TV), and others—entered the market, speculating that it was an inevitable and potentially lucrative new medium. In the 1990s, many small- to mid-sized media companies got out of the business of delivering cable, in part because they may have lacked the deep pockets that would be required to rebuild the cable infrastructure to provide for new digital services, and in part because the largest multiple-system operators (MSOs) and other investors fueled a buying frenzy with capital, largely in the form of junk bonds, coming from Wall Street interests. This wave of consolidation left a handful of MSOs in control of most of the market. In 2005, there were an estimated 65.4 million cable-subscribing U.S. households. The largest MSO, Comcast, served over a third, with 21.5 million subscribers as of June 2005. The second-largest, Time Warner, served just under 11 million homes. Together, they served almost half of all subscribers. The six largest MSOs (a list rounded out by Cox, Charter, Adelphia, and Cablevision) serve well over three-quarters of all subscribers.5 Over the last decade, competition has developed as DBS systems, growing at a rapid rate as a result of new rules promoting competition in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, have enticed a significant number of viewers to give up cable—or to subscribe to a multichannel service for the first time. In many markets, DBS competes directly with cable systems that otherwise have enjoyed local monopolies. As of June 2005, just over 26\n\n20 p a r t i : i n s t i t u t i o n s a n d a u d i e n c e s\n\nmillion households subscribed to DBS, which reached almost 28 percent of the market for multichannel video delivery (compared to only about 4 percent of the market in 1993). The market is shared among three providers, but dominated by two: DIRECTV, which is a subsidiary of News Corporation’s Fox Entertainment Group, serves over half of all DBS subscribers (almost 15 million); EchoStar’s DISH Network runs a close second, at 11.45 million. Dominion Video Satellite’s SkyAngel serves an estimated 1 million households with Christian and family-oriented channels.6 In the chapters that follow, contributing authors explore aspects of the cable and satellite television (or MVPD) industry and that industry’s attempts to organize viewers and consumers as audiences and as subscribers. They investigate the entrepreneurial innovations and deliberative negotiations that structured “pay” cable (and eventually satellite) TV as alternatives to broadcasting; the potential of a digital media environment to further diversify the television marketplace with vastly expanded channel capacity and interactivity; and the relationship of the cable channels and the programming to the TV audience, and how that relationship is necessarily reimagined in a subscription-driven system offering a diminished role to advertisers—or in the case of premium channels, in which advertising revenue is entirely absent. To begin, Megan Mullen takes us back to where “the cable begins,” to reverse the title chosen by Lisa Parks for an entry later in this section. Exploring the origins of Community Access Television (CATV), Mullen finds it in the hands of individual entrepreneurs in widely dispersed locations— from Arkansas to Oregon to Pennsylvania and New York State—as early as 1947. In each case, in which remoteness or geographical features prevented residents from receiving clear broadcast signals, CATV innovators typically solved the problem by relaying signals from an antenna placed on a mountaintop or tall building to homes via a wired network. Mullen introduces us to some of these early cable system operators, each one running a small, family-owned business outside of a major metropolitan area. Together, they laid literal groundwork for what has become a multi-billion dollar business passing approximately 108 million U.S. homes.7 Mullen explores the motivations that drove their initial efforts and, in many cases, their ongoing development of the industry, even as it changed and grew. Despite the efforts of these pioneers, cable grew slowly in the 1950s, 1960s, and even 1970s, when the means by which TV signals would be delivered to viewers was debated in terms John McMurria discusses. While the FCC dithered on whether to authorize or ban “pay-TV” systems, in the\n\nIntroduction 21\n\n1950s Congress passed a series of rules that put the brakes on the growth of pay-TV, at least temporarily; consequently, free-to-air, advertising-supported broadcast television was allowed to dominate the market, even though broadcasting was already being criticized in its earliest years for the banality of its content and its failure to provide educational programming. At the same time, however, the free-to-air system was hailed for its capacity to provide universal service, and it was supported in testimony at congressional hearings on the subject by representatives of groups advocating for veterans, senior citizens, women, civil rights, and labor unions, among others. Seeking to reform television as a more varied medium, some industry observers and players—ranging from electronics manufacturers and TV critics to educators and progressives in the federal government—pushed for adoption of pay-TV systems designed to provide additional services to subscribers. While hoping to enhance the capacity of the medium to serve the public interest, their efforts—which allowed for eventual authorization of subscription-based cable services—provided for pay-TV models. With access to these dependent on ability to pay, the principle of universal service was jettisoned in favor of market-driven solutions. Reform-minded critics of broadcasting believed that cable-based pay TV would solve the “scarcity” problem that plagued broadcasting. If only a handful of over-the-air signals could be clearly transmitted within any given locality, then broadcasting would forever be intrinsically too limited to serve the public with adequate competition and diversity in form and viewpoint. According to François Bar and Jonathan Taplin’s essay in this volume, not only did analog cable alter and expand the television market, but also its quantity and range of services would be further enhanced by a digital “revolution” which was engineered by a massive, nationwide upgrading of the cable infrastructure, as well as by an overhauling of regulations that allowed for technological convergence and cross-media ownership. Accordingly, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted cable systems and telephone companies to compete in offering multiple services (television signals, telephony, and highspeed Internet). This development, in turn, gives rise to the question: What shape will the “digital future” take? On one hand, it might look very much like prior phases of the television industry’s history in which a few powerful corporate entities exerted primary control. Alternatively, Bar and Taplin look toward the emergence of a multi-service Internet Television platform that would boast virtually unlimited channel capacity, as well as allowing for alternative distribution\n\n22 p a r t i : i n s t i t u t i o n s a n d a u d i e n c e s\n\nschemes and new producers to enter media markets. But, as the authors suggest, this very diversity could eventually destabilize the economic viability of a multichannel universe, as increasingly fragmented audiences might turn out to hold little appeal to advertisers. In sum, Bar and Taplin argue that present-day policymakers must consider the long-term implications of the directions in which they seek to reshape electronic media so as to fully protect the user’s access to an open, interconnecting, and transparent market. In the next essay in this section, Amanda Lotz turns her attention to a sector of the cable industry that differs in some dimensions from conventional (“basic”) subscription service: the premium channels, such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax. These channels, which operate according to an alternative business plan, are able to provide programming that is, in some ways, distinct from that offered by other cable channels. Since, unlike basic channels, the premium tier is financed only by subscription fees—it sells no commercials and therefore earns no ad revenue—its success is measured by numbers of paying subscribers, rather than numbers of viewers which can be translated into ratings. Without advertising, premium channels are able to offer distinct narratives and scheduling routines, revising audience expectations about television generally. While premium channels depended on a heavy rotation of feature films and sporting events in their early years, they eventually added original programming, much of which would come to be known as the “best” quality television available by any means. What Lotz then explores are the cultural implications of a media environment in which the highest quality content may be available to only a relatively small percentage of the potential audience. Lisa Parks locates audiences that are not effectively served either by over-the-air broadcast signals or by cable, and who, not unlike the early cable pioneers discussed by Mullen, sought out signals not readily delivered to them. She argues that an array of factors impacting the means by which homes (and other sites) receive television signals is frequently overlooked in TV scholarship. The shape of the cable industry, and, eventually, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) services are frequently regarded as the product of aggressively pursued industrial and regulatory agendas; meanwhile, the geography of these media is too often ignored. DBS has served not only to compete with other kinds of delivery systems, but also to function in so-called fringe areas where satellite hook-ups provide the only access to TV. Parks considers the spatial expression of this medium beyond “where the cable ends,” finding, in remote coastal and desert communities,\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nearly and pervasive adoption of satellite technology. Her materialist analysis of the growth and use of this technology complements the politicaleconomic analyses that occupy most of this section.\n\nnotes 1.

In other words, media historians—and others affiliated with the modern cable industry—readily herald the small-town inventors and businessmen who devised ways to bring the television signals of large metropolitan areas into the nation’s hinterlands. Most people enjoy hearing an “American Dream” type of story, especially when contrasted with a broadcast television industry headquartered in major cities and dominated by established corporations. There is merit in this approach to cable history. The early cable industry—better known as community antenna television (CATV)—began around 1950 in towns too small and remote for residents to receive broadcast signals using set-top (“rabbit ear”) or rooftop antennas. People across the country were well aware of television at this point, even if they lacked access to it. CATV drew from an eclectic combination of makeshift technologies that captured broadcast signals from high places (such as mountaintops) and transmitted them to television sets in lower elevations. The pioneers of these technologies were loosely if at all affiliated with existing broadcast television interests. Most were appliance dealers wishing to sell television sets. Some were radio operators, familiar with broadcast technologies. A few were simply residents of the small, remote towns with a fascination for technology. Some had backgrounds in consumer electronics, and some had technical training from military service. Virtually all of the earliest cable television pioneers held strong business, civic, and family ties to their small communities. Yet explaining their operations as simple “mom ’n’ pop” ventures is an extreme oversimplification. They actually represent, in one way or an24\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 25\n\nother, a complex industry that was in formation almost from the day the first person thought to connect a tall receiving antenna by wire to a television set. Many CATV businesses—indeed the majority, if one is counting number of systems rather than subscribers—did continue to be run locally and for relatively little profit well into the 1990s (with a fair number existing even today). And in many cases the operators of these systems were married couples, with the husband managing day-to-day operations and interacting with other professionals and the wife running the office and keeping the books. Yet the most forward-looking and professionally run of the very early systems tended to differ from this model—a little in some cases and a great deal in others. The leaders of the emerging CATV industry did more than simply sustain their own local businesses; they built (or helped build) other systems, developed new technologies and services, and worked through legal and policy issues at every level. These were individuals who perceived the potential of the infant industry and made the critical technological and business innovations that kept it from being a simple retransmission or utility service. Those systems that moved the industry forward represented a great deal more technical expertise and business savvy that the term “mom ’n’ pop” alone would imply. One goal of this chapter is to discuss how the earliest CATV systems in the United States were founded and developed. The other is to show how those CATV operators who chose to work together formed a cohesive industry that would grow and develop, rather than serve merely as a stopgap technology until more of the nation’s residents had better broadcast television service. Let’s begin with a look at five CATV systems that have been cited as “firsts.”\n\nThe First Wave: Cable Pioneers Davidson’s Claim Probably the least known CATV “first” is the story of James Y. (“Jimmy”) Davidson of Tuckerman, Arkansas—a small town ninety miles northwest of Memphis. As a young adult in the 1930s, Davidson managed the local movie theater and in his spare time ran a radio repair business, using skills he had learned as a teenage hobbyist. Davidson served in the Navy’s Signal Corps during World War II and, in a story strikingly similar to those of\n\n26 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nother community antenna pioneers, returned to Tuckerman to run an appliance store. Shortly after his return, in late 1947, Davidson found out that Memphis television station WMCT would soon be starting operations. He was disappointed that Tuckerman was too far away to receive the station’s signal, and so he and an associate set about building a 100-foot antenna tower near his store. During WMCT’s start-up period Davidson eagerly awaited and watched test transmissions—at first simply test patterns, but eventually a live telecast of a college football game. At the time, Davidson’s system had only one regular subscriber, the local telegraph operator, but he connected the American Legion hall to the antenna for this special event. A very large crowd was in attendance, and not surprisingly people clamored for CATV service a few months later (January 1, 1949) when the Memphis station began full-time broadcasting. Davidson, who is eager to compare himself to other CATV pioneers, claims to have had the first CATV franchise in the nation.1 He explains, “I knew that the utilities had to have a permit or franchise or whatever you want to call it to access the public right of ways. And I guess I just assumed that I had to as well.”2 Soon after starting the Tuckerman system, Davidson began to build community antenna systems for nearby towns. He and his associate would travel from one system to another in Davidson’s own small airplane. He also started Davco, a CATV supply and consulting business serving those who wished to start systems of their own. Journalist Tom Southwick explains that “Davco specialized in building a complete cable headend and then flying it intact to the location where it was needed and where it could be installed in a day.”3 Davidson went on to work with CATV/cable trade associations at both the national and regional levels. He remained active in the industry until the late 1970s and still follows its developments from his home near Little Rock. As of 2006, he and his wife were working on turning their home into a cable history museum and library.4 Parsons’ Claim A more commonly told story relates how L. E. (Ed) Parsons, a radio station operator in Astoria, Oregon, invented cable to please his wife, a former journalist familiar with broadcasting. The couple had traveled to a radio convention in Chicago during the mid 1940s and while there enjoyed the opportunity to watch broadcast television. At the time, there\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 27\n\nwere no broadcast television stations operating in the vicinity of Astoria. In the summer of 1948, though, it was announced that KRSC, Channel 5– Seattle, was to go on the air—and so Parsons set about finding a way to make that channel available in Astoria (some two hundred miles from Seattle). He found that KRSC’s signal filtered through the mountains surrounding Astoria in bands or “fingers” of varying strengths. One of the fingers was accessible from the roof of the two-story apartment building where he lived, so he erected an antenna. He and his wife worked as a team to tune the signal, he on the rooftop adjusting the antenna and she in the living room reporting on signal quality via walkie-talkie. No clear signal was received, however, until Parsons relocated the antenna to the top of the nearby eight-story Astor Hotel and then connected it to his own building using twin-lead cable.5 This was in November 1948, about a month after Davidson’s successful retransmission of the football game. Not surprisingly, the hotel owners were receptive to Parsons’ experiments, at least early on; television reception quickly became a draw for visitors and patrons. Since residents of Astoria approached Parsons with requests to have the antenna service extended to their homes, he had to develop a relay system and increasingly sophisticated networking technology. What he came up with was a combination of a coaxial cable network to connect buildings and transmitting antennas for sending the signal across streets. The latter technology—actually a form of broadcasting—would later cause some in the industry to question his claim of being the true inventor of community antenna television. But this might simply be a way of calling attention to the fact that Parsons never became active in the CATV/cable industry.6 In any case, Parsons did devise a workable means of distributing a broadcast television signal to residents of a community who would not have received television service otherwise. At first, Parsons charged subscribers directly for the needed equipment, most of which he had either invented or adapted himself. By the end of 1951, though, he had worked out a standard installation fee of $125 and a $3 monthly rental charge.7 Following this, he was sought out by aspiring CATV operators throughout the Northwest. Traveling in his own airplane, like Davidson, he helped locate signals and design systems. Publicity surrounding Parsons’ Astoria system had also brought CATV to the attention of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as well as to the broadcast television industry. Systems in the East that\n\n28 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nlaunched around the same time raised concerns that the new community antennas might harm the growing broadcast television industry, and thereby jeopardize a future in which all communities might have their own local television stations.8 Interestingly, for its part KRSC was receptive to Parsons’ system, seeing the potential increase in audience size as a benefit (not all television stations would be this amenable in the future). For the FCC, this presented a confusing new regulatory issue, though. Communication between Parsons and the commission (reflecting considerably more concern with the technology than with the business aspects) contributed significantly to subsequent FCC inquiries into the nature of the emerging industry—especially once other systems were known to be operating closer to Washington, D.C.9 Among those with claims to the earliest CATV systems, Parsons is the only one who did not remain involved with the developing industry. In 1953, he moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, where he remained until his death in 1989. Although he did find ways to bring television programming to remote communities there, he considered his efforts in improving radio and telephone communication networks both in Alaska and in the Arctic to have been far greater accomplishments. He ranked the CATV system in Astoria “third” among his lifetime accomplishments.10 Walson’s Claim John Walson (formerly Walsonavich) of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, holds a fascinating, if not entirely convincing, claim to have built the first CATV system in 1948. Mahanoy City is a town in eastern Pennsylvania’s anthracite coal region that lies in a narrow valley between two steep mountains. Most of its homes and businesses are row-style buildings on the sides of the mountains, structures little changed since they were built during the mining boom that began over a century ago. During the late 1940s, Walson held two jobs: maintenance worker for the utility company and part owner of an appliance store. Known to be a tinkerer, he used his experience with electrical wiring to devise a way to improve television reception (and therefore sales of television sets) in his community. Walson’s system at first relied on twin-lead cable, but quickly was converted to the more reliable coaxial cable. Within its first year, according to Walson’s claim, his business, Service Electric, had close to one thousand subscribers (a good portion of the town at that time). There is little dispute that Walson actually did connect a mountaintop\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 29\n\nreceiving antenna by wire to homes in Mahanoy City, and at a very early date. And it is well worth noting that he went on to introduce a number of precedent-setting programming and technology innovations in his community, including increased channel capacity using, first, what he described as “stacked antennas” and, later, a microwave relay.11 However, his claim to have invented CATV as early as 1948 is greatly disputed, as documented in detail by cable scholar Patrick Parsons. First, Parsons explains, it seems odd that Walson did not actually make any claim at all to having the first system until well into the 1960s. And since all of his business records were destroyed in a 1952 fire, there is no actual evidence to back the claim. Second, information in Television Factbook, an authoritative reference source that began in 1952, shows an inconsistency in data reported by Service Electric. Apparently Walson’s business reported its founding date as 1950 until 1967, at which point it began listing the date as 1948. This ambiguity was also reflected by the recollections of cable pioneers Parsons interviewed. Third, there is a credible competing claim to the first CATV system in Mahanoy City.12 Parsons provides additional information that seriously questions the likelihood that Walson had the first CATV system in the nation—or even in his own community.13 At the very least, though, Walson’s story is worth consideration because it represents the degree to which early CATV lay outside the interests of the established entertainment industries, much less the general public. Even if he had launched the nation’s first CATV system in 1948, it might have been a “tree falling in the forest” situation. Few if any news media could have perceived the significance of what had occurred because there was no context for it. Anyone living in a metropolitan area such as New York or even Philadelphia—the nearest hubs of “big media” reporting— would not have been aware that parts of rural America were unserved by broadcast television and thus had their lives changed when CATV service came to their communities. The most coverage Walson’s story even could have received as early as 1948 would have been a local news article or perhaps a few lines “buried” in a larger newspaper or trade publication. But if even this much did not happen, it should not be surprising. Tarlton’s Claim Panther Valley TV (PVTV), the system begun by Robert J. Tarlton in Lansford, Pennsylvania, in 1950, was apparently the first to receive any national press coverage; articles about it appeared in 1951 in The Wall Street\n\n30 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nJournal, Radio and Television News, and Television Digest. Lansford is an anthracite valley town with geography similar to that of Mahanoy City (sixteen miles west of Lansford). Tarlton was the son of a department store radio salesman who had developed his own interest in electronics engineering. In the late 1940s he experimented with twin-lead cable prior to the launch of an actual CATV system, once arranging makeshift reception for a wealthy acquaintance. Tarlton did not wish to claim a “first” because he did not consider his initial experiments reliable means of television reception. But unlike those systems discussed above, PVTV was a professionally run CATV business from the start. As Tarlton explained, “Many times I’ve been accused of being too conservative, but I suppose it paid off because it forced me to look for something that would be dependable.”14 When PVTV officially went into business in the spring of 1950, the system was built using coaxial cable and components manufactured by Jerrold Electronics of Philadelphia and designed specifically for CATV use. Tarlton had approached Jerrold’s owner, Milton Jerrold Shapp, upon learning that Jerrold was in the business of supplying “master antenna” systems that served hotels and apartment houses in television-served urban areas. Shapp quickly perceived the potential for equipping CATV systems once Tarlton, and soon other CATV pioneers, began purchasing components for their systems.15 In fact, Lansford’s CATV system became the showcase as well as the testing ground for Jerrold components. The role of Shapp and his company would only grow as the CATV industry evolved. Shapp had been in the electronics business since the 1940s, but it was meeting and working with Tarlton that got him interested in CATV. He first used the Lansford system to field-test components and subsequently hired Tarlton to help set up new systems during the years 1952–1958.16 By this point, Jerrold was equipping most new CATV systems with only a “service agreement” in place, according to which Jerrold would receive a percentage of the profits for a specified period in exchange for maintenance and upgrades. Tarlton explains that working for such a business, I put in systems all over the country: Clarksburg, West Virginia; Fairmont, West Virginia; out in the mid-west and western part of the country; up in Berlin, New Hampshire; and Wenatchee, Washington. We found problems in all of these systems and we overcame them. I worked with the engineering people in a cooperative manner. We made field tests in these systems\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 31\n\nand then the engineering department was able to overcome some of the problems. In the latter years with Jerrold, my primary thrust was in developing the systems, getting the systems installed and using my experience to set up the system, offices, and the entire gamut of operating the business.17\n\nFor his part, Shapp is credited with being the first in the CATV industry to successfully approach New York City banks for financial backing, surely a signal of the industry’s future direction. As Shapp summed it up: I got J. H. Whitney Company in New York . . . and I sold [them] on the idea of financing cable television systems. So our job at Jerrold was to get the franchise. First we sat down with the Whitney people and went over 40, 50 communities. They boiled it down. They would only go about 7, 8, 9, 10 systems. They boiled it down to the ones and getting franchises in those days was a heck of a lot easier than it is now. We had a perfect batting record of the first 8 or 10 systems. They put up the money for it and we formed an individual company in each community. Whitney, I think it was 50%, and Fox-Wells had about 10–12%, and I came out of that, Jerrold, we had somewhere around 40–35% of the system. So we not only got paid for all our efforts, paid for all of the equipment, but now also had a financial interest in the systems.18\n\nShapp’s role makes it clear that by the mid-1950s CATV had already attained fiscal credibility.19 It had also developed into a distinct industry, with a prominent trade organization, the National Community Television Association (NCTA), begun by Martin F. Malarkey of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Malarkey’s Role Malarkey, an appliance store owner, never claimed to have been the first CATV operator, even though his system, which launched in February 1951, was among the very earliest. Malarkey had a component-testing arrangement with equipment manufacturer RCA that was similar to the one Tarlton had with Jerrold; both electronics companies were active (and highly competitive) players in the rapid rise of CATV, and they had every reason to cultivate the symbiotic “laboratory” relationship with enterprising individuals such as these. Malarkey is best remembered, though, for playing the key role in orga-\n\n32 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nnizing the earliest CATV operators into an industry by founding the National Community Television Council (to be renamed the National Community Television Association).20 The first annual convention of this important organization was held in June of 1952 at the Neccho Allen Hotel in Pottsville, with several smaller meetings having been held there over the previous year. It hardly seems coincidental that the NCTA, the most prominent trade organization in cable history, traces its origins back to Pottsville. The city’s proximity to other early CATV communities—including Mahanoy City, Lansford, and several others—made it a logical meeting place. The NCTA will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Malarkey’s keen business sense surely was key to his leadership role in the CATV industry as a whole. Trans-Video’s fees were comparable to other systems at the time: $135 for connection and $3.75 monthly. But shortly after the start of his system, Malarkey began thinking of ways to offer subscribers more than simply retransmitted broadcast signals for their money—an idea that was years ahead of its time. First, starting in 1951, Malarkey provided a channel of closed-circuit locally originated programs. This operation was described as follows: Trans-Video Corp., Pottsville, Pa., put on a half hour live show June 27th in cooperation with one of their local radio stations. This show was staged at the antenna site and included interviews of city officials, heads of civic organizations, system personnel, visiting dignitaries, professional artists and most touching, an interview of the winner of the Soap Box Derby and his family.21\n\nReports such as this were common during the late 1960s and early 1970s, once the federal government had begun to mandate local origination. Until that point, though, CATV systems originating programs were few and far between. That Pottsville was the first is confirmed by the recollections of E. Stratford Smith, who, while working in the FCC’s Common Carrier Bureau, visited Trans-Video in 1951.22 There is also documentation that Malarkey would switch among the various signals received at the headend (the number of which exceeded system capacity) to select certain programs he felt would be more popular with his subscribers.23 This strategy, though somewhat more common in CATV’s earliest years, was similarly forward-looking in that it predicted a time and place when cable service would need to be marketed as something distinct from broadcast televi-\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 33\n\nsion. Innovations such as these were taking place within only a few years of the very first experiments with any sort of community technology. So even though historians are unlikely ever to verify that one of the systems discussed thus far actually preceded the others or was the most pioneering in its use of “modern” technology, these sorts of claims seem trivial in comparison with the larger issue of what these endeavors and many others like them represent in the history of television in the United States. Malarkey’s situation should make this clear. Although he started a couple of years later than other pioneers, he built on their knowledge in ways that moved the industry forward. The community antenna systems discussed here, along with a handful of others, quickly developed into successful local businesses, setting important precedents for such things as initial installation charges and subscription fees.\n\nThe Second Wave Marveling at the rapid growth of CATV in eastern Pennsylvania makes it easy to overlook the fact that it took less than a year for the industry to start spreading to other parts of the United States. By 1953, there were three hundred CATV systems operating in states including New York, Maryland, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, California, and Texas.24 This second wave of early systems constitutes a category unto itself. It included a number of operators active in the increasingly cohesive industry and eager to learn from the successes and failures of the earliest CATV entrepreneurs. Among this group were business men and women who sought to do more than simply provide a community antenna service and were particularly active in exploring new technologies, marketing schemes, and emerging legal issues. Even at this very early stage, the industry’s founders were becoming aware of both the potential and the complexity of their business. Oneonta Some of the eastern Pennsylvania operators had already perceived that their subscribers wanted to receive the full complement of network offerings; they also were eager to receive New York independent stations in addition to the network affiliates from Philadelphia because of the sports and movies carried by the independents. But the full marketing potential\n\n34 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nof the additional channels arguably was not fully realized until operators began to migrate from the region and use their expertise to launch new systems. One such businessman was William Calsam, who had begun the CATV system in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania in 1951. Schuylkill Haven is at the southern edge of Schuylkill County (technically outside the anthracite region) and only six miles south of Pottsville. Calsam knew Malarkey and apparently had begun his system using Malarkey’s advice or at least his example. In 1953, however, Calsam sold the Schuylkill Haven system and moved to Oneonta, New York, to begin a CATV business there.25 Calsam found a business partner in Oneonta, local attorney and real estate owner Albert Farone, and they, along with a handful of other investors, founded Oneonta Video. Calsam epitomized the professional values that guided what was by this point the close-knit and forward-looking NCTA. He became NCTA treasurer in 1954 and remained active in the organization until his 1965 retirement; he was also a charter member of the New York Community Television Association. Oneonta Video’s owners were eager to make Oneonta a showcase for new CATV technologies that would allow subscribers to receive a range of desirable channels instead of simply the nearest available broadcast signals. The full complement of broadcast network programming was readily available via community antennas from affiliate stations in nearby Binghamton, Syracuse, and Schenectady. But Calsam and Farone wanted to offer more and thus pursued two new technologies. First was closed-circuit local origination of the sort Malarkey had been using in Pottsville. Calsam’s grandson Robert McMinn, who was very familiar with his grandfather’s business, recalls that a moderately successful local programming operation existed in Oneonta briefly in the early 1960s.26 A more lasting and prescient programming scheme was Eastern Microwave. Like Walson and Malarkey, Calsam perceived that independent stations from New York City would be popular with his subscribers; as they continue to be today, stations including WOR and WPIX were known for extensive schedules of professional sports and syndicated Hollywood movies. Yet Oneonta (like Mahanoy City) lies just a little too far from New York to receive those stations’ signals using a community antenna. Calsam’s solution—similar to one in use by Walson and Service Electric around the same time—was to build a microwave relay between Oneonta and New York. In the case of Oneonta Video, this involved two mountaintop towers or “hops” between Oneonta and New York. Though\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 35\n\ntechnically a separate business, Eastern Microwave had shared ownership with Oneonta Video. Within a few years, Eastern Microwave had extended its operations to CATV systems throughout central New York, including systems owned by Oneonta Video as well as others. When Oneonta Video was sold to Newhouse Broadcasting in 1965, Eastern Microwave was an important part of the package. The business grew, eventually connecting with microwave networks in Pennsylvania (including Service Electric). It continued to deliver distant independent stations to local cable systems, setting a critical precedent for today’s cable “superstations.” Eastern Microwave also delivered the newly formed Home Box Office cable network to subscribers in New York and Pennsylvania starting in 1972, before the cable network began satellite transmission in 1975.27 Calsam and the Oneonta Video story demonstrate that, in its earliest years, CATV was already perceived at least as much as a lucrative investment opportunity as a service to a person’s own community. Calsam had left his own community very soon after starting the CATV system there in order to start a system in a town he probably had never visited before, much less held personal connections with. Farone, on the other hand, had many connections to Oneonta, but no previous interest in CATV. A shrewd businessman, as Farone was known to be, might have perceived Oneonta Video as a community service to some extent, but for him it was primarily a good investment opportunity. Several individuals affiliated with Oneonta Video recall that Farone had very little to do with day-today operations. Meadville The story of Meadville Master Antenna (MMA) of Meadville, Pennsylvania contrasts sharply with that of Oneonta Video in that it is a story of entrepreneurship and community service, carried out by individuals with very strong family ties to their community. Yet Meadville nonetheless differs in many ways from the “mom ’n’ pop” prototype as well. Meadville Master Antenna was owned jointly by George Barco and his daughter Yolanda Barco. The system was launched on June 16, 1953. As their “day job,” the Barcos ran an extremely successful law practice in Meadville. Their prominence in the community lent credibility to their CATV business. At the same time, their combined legal expertise helped\n\n36 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nthem navigate the uncharted terrain of CATV. The Barcos and James Duratz (husband of George Barco’s other daughter, Helene), who served as general manager for the system from the late 1950s through the 1980s, were a powerful presence in the emerging industry. Yolanda Barco’s story is unique for its time; women had little voice in the CATV industry of the 1950s, and the “moms” of any genuine “mom ’n’ pop” businesses did more to prove this rule than to provide the exception to it. If wives were to accompany their husbands to professional meetings—as sometimes was the case—there would be flower shows and shopping excursions to keep them busy. By contrast, Duratz confirms that, indeed, his sister-in-law was virtually the only female presence at NCTA meetings for many years (with the exception of various recording secretaries). For his part, Duratz, educated in economics and self-taught in engineering, was adept at implementing the latest technical innovations (often at the behest of the Barcos, following their attendance at industry meetings). Like Tarlton, the Barcos and Duratz were affiliated with Jerrold Electronics during the early decades of their operations. Since MMA started after Jerrold had begun manufacturing CATV components, Shapp had approached the Barcos about having one of Jerrold’s service agreements in Meadville, but the Barcos wished to retain more control of the business.28 Nonetheless, as Duratz explains, the Barco family maintained a strong relationship with Shapp and his company which clearly benefited both parties. As he put it, “Well, it was interesting that most of the development that Jerrold created was field tested by us. When we’d get something you never knew if it was going to work. You’d just have to put it out in the field and try it and make adjustments.”29 In its later decades MMA would continue both to be technologically innovative and to serve the specific needs of its community; in this company, these two goals were always seen as intertwined, not competing. In the early 1960s the system underwent a major rebuild, among other things, allowing MMA to launch a local programming operation, CTV-13. A fulltime manager, James Strickler, was hired, and CTV-13 instituted a regular program schedule in 1967. This was two years before the federal government announced that it would soon require local origination (i.e., locally produced programs aired on an available cable channel), and CTV-13 continued long after that requirement was revoked. Reflecting on CTV-13, both Duratz and Strickler point out that the local origination operation was never a profit-making venture; it was always subsidized by both MMA’s other services and the Barcos’ law practice.30\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 37\n\nOne can only speculate as to how other communities might have fared with local origination had their original owners not sold them before this practice began to be supported by the federal government. Certainly it is not a common practice today, with the exception of scattered public access operations. It is not financially feasible, and the multiple-system operators (MSOs) that now own most local cable systems clearly have no personal or philanthropic stakes in the communities they serve. The Barcos, of course, had another source of revenue—the law practice —and thus had less reason to be concerned about maximizing the revenue potential of their CATV system. MMA was not sold until the late 1980s, and even today it is owned by a small, regional MSO, Armstrong Cable, whose owners were acquainted with the Barcos. Arguably this is more a testament to the Barcos’ commitment to Meadville than it is a statement about cable television economics; indeed, in many ways it contradicts those economics because of the scale economies made possible by more extensive multiple-system ownership. But inasmuch as the law practice contributed to the Barcos’ commitment to their community, this practice also proved extremely beneficial to the newly organized NCTA during the 1950s.\n\nEarly Frustrations of the CATV Industry As discussed above, the first meetings of the NCTA actually had occurred in June 1952, fully a year before the Barcos even began their CATV system. Their absence at this early stage certainly did not diminish their role in the organization through many subsequent years, however.31 Rather, it reminds us of how unprecedented the very earliest CATV systems were, as well as the extent to which these inventors and entrepreneurs had to employ stopgap measures to keep their industry from being defeated before it even got off the ground. The issue that led to the NCTA’s first meetings seems minor by contemporary standards: CATV systems in Pottsville, as well as Lansford and Honesdale, Pennsylvania, had been selected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) as test cases. The bureau felt that an 8 percent excise tax, then being applied to leased wire services (such as newswires and the services used by the broadcast television networks to distribute programs to their affiliate stations), should also be applied to community antenna systems. The few dozen operators gathered at the charter meetings agreed to contest the tax.\n\n38 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nAlthough it would be a few years before the case went to trial, the emerging industry’s defense would be based on the fact that, for many smaller communities, it was the only way of getting television service—which, of course, larger communities received over-the-air without any charge at all.32 By the time the case did reach the courts, many more CATV systems had been launched, including those in Meadville, Oneonta, and others whose founders were among the vanguard in industry leadership. Indeed it was the Barcos who both prosecuted and provided the plaintiff for the test case, a prototypical MMA subscriber (Pahoulis) who had paid $70.49 in taxes for his service. Initially, the U.S. district court in Pennsylvania held that the tax did apply in the Pahoulis case. But this decision was overturned (along with a similar West Virginia case that had been taken over by the cable organization) in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1956.33 Surely this helped the fortunes of the emerging industry. The Barcos were joined in their legal efforts during the early 1950s by E. Stratford Smith, an attorney, who had been working for the FCC’s Common Carrier Bureau at the time the first CATV systems were being built. In fact, he had been responsible for reporting on both the Astoria and Pottsville systems. Smith quickly became so fascinated with the CATV systems he had observed that he left the FCC and went to work for the NCTA. As he explains, My personal impressions were that it was a coming thing and that it was going to be much more important than it was then. I won’t sit here and tell you that in the early 1950s I envisioned the cable television industry as it is today; I did not see that far ahead. But I did see it as a much more important way of getting television service around the country than the FCC did at the time. I can’t say that the FCC had a position. They did not even mention CATV in the Sixth Report and Order, the television allocation report in 1956. Nobody there seemed to see it as meaning anything.34\n\nSmith went on to serve as secretary to the NCTA for several years during the 1950s, and throughout the 1950s and 1960s tried many cases involving CATV. One of these was the landmark 1968 case, Fortnightly v. United Artists, which challenged CATV’s right to retransmit copyrighted television programs. He won the case for the industry, a temporary victory that led to more formal guidelines on copyright issues involving cable television. Although Smith owned some small CATV systems on the West Coast\n\nThe Moms ’n’ Pops of CATV 39\n\nfor a while, his role in the emerging industry was not primarily one of investment or entrepreneurship. Instead, his early arrival on the CATV scene signals the rapid professionalization of a grassroots industry. Without an industry already cohesive enough to have identified common problems and a distinct position vis-à-vis various government bodies, there would have been no role for him. Clearly, though, there was a role for Smith— and soon other categories of professionals—due to the fact that several of CATV’s earliest pioneers chose to move quickly beyond the basic local service stage of operations.\n\nThe Real Moms ’n’ Pops and the Role They Have Played At the beginning of this chapter, I mentioned that the vast majority of CATV systems continued for many years as small “mom ’n’ pop” operations. This fact should not be dismissed lightly since these low-profile systems have provided the only source of television service to many of the nation’s rural residents well into today’s era of satellite channels and multiple-system operators (MSOs) such as Time Warner and Comcast. For years, many of these systems were too small and isolated to be of much interest to the MSOs.35 And in many cases, local operators did not wish to give up their businesses. A particularly interesting story in this vein is that of Bainbridge Cable, a system that is “typical” in spite of a rather atypical beginning. David Coe founded Bainbridge Cable in 1953 to serve the village of Bainbridge, New York, some thirty-two miles from Binghamton and the nearest television stations. Interestingly, Bainbridge native Coe began the CATV system while still attending college, as a project for one of his engineering courses at Cornell University. He and his father financed and ran the system. In August 1967, Electronics World, a popular publication for electronics aficionados, included Coe’s story (immediately following that of Robert Tarlton) in an article entitled “CATV: Past, Present & Future.” The thrust of the article was to herald individual “ingenuity and enterprise,” and the story it tells of Coe parallels those told of his predecessors, Parsons, Walson, and Tarlton: “As news of the successful experiment spread, more and more of Coe’s neighbors began to ask if they could be connected to his antenna. And the senior project became a business. Coe started by charging $90 for connection to the system and $2 per month.”36 Bainbridge Cable actually remained independent until its acquisition\n\n40 m e g a n m u l l e n\n\nin 1994—long after surrounding systems had begun to be acquired by MSOs.37 Still, as Electronics World was eager to point out as early as 1967, while systems like Bainbridge Cable flourished, they were not industry leaders. Coe remained able to keep pace with the MSO-owned systems as new technologies and programming options came along. He began offering HBO in 1978, just two years after it became available via sat"
