        "text": "Launched\n\nOctober 9, 1986\n\nParent Company\n\nFox Media Group (Fox Corporation)\n\nSister Networks\n\nFox News, FS1, FS2, Big Ten Network, MyNetworkTV\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company (commonly referred to as Fox or the Fox Network, and stylized as FOX), is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by Fox Corporation. It's the world's third largest major network.\n\nLaunched on October 9, 1986 as a competitor to longer-established networks ABC, NBC and CBS, Fox went on to become the most successful venture at a fourth television network, becoming the highest-rated broadcast network in the 18–49 demographic from 2004 to 2012 and earning the position as the most-watched network in the United States overall during the 2007–08 season.[5][6]\n\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company and its affiliated companies operate many entertainment channels in international markets, although these do not necessarily air the same programming as the U.S. network. Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate, although most of Fox's primetime programming (as well as NFL on Fox) is subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to protect rights held by domestically based networks.\n\nThe network is named after former sister company 20th Century Fox, and indirectly for producer William Fox, who founded one of the movie studio's predecessors, Fox Film. Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nChildren's Programming\n\nFox began airing children's programming in 1990 when it launched the Fox Children's Network (later rebranded as the Fox Kids Network and then shortened to Fox Kids), a program block that aired on Saturday mornings and Monday through Friday afternoons (the weekday block gradually expanded to include a two-hour morning lineup, while its afternoon lineup expanded to 2½ hours). Programming within the block consisted mainly of cartoons, although it also aired some live-action series (particularly fantasy action programs) including Power Rangers (which later moved to ABC and Toon Disney, and has since moved to Nickelodeon), Bobby's World, X-Men, The Tick, Eerie, Indiana (which had aired in reruns on The Disney Channel shortly before joining the Fox Kids lineup) and Goosebumps. When The WB debuted the Kids' WB programming block in September 1995, Warner Bros.-produced animated series Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs and later Batman: The Animated Series (all of which originated either on Fox Kids or in syndication), moved to Kids' WB to supplement that block's first-run kids' shows.\n\nIn 2001, Fox sold its children's division and the former Fox Family Channel (now ABC Family) to The Walt Disney Company; it would drop the weekday blocks the following year (turning the two-hour time period over to its stations, rather than retaining the slots and filling them with adult-oriented daytime shows), and replaced Fox Kids in September 2002 with a new children's program block, FoxBox (which was renamed 4KidsTV the following year), after it leased the four hours of its Saturday morning lineup to 4Kids Entertainment.\n\nFox discontinued the 4KidsTV block on December 27, 2008, due to a payment and distribution dispute between the network and 4Kids Entertainment, which was later settled. Rather than lease the time to another company to produce another children's program block, Fox gave two hours of the Saturday block back to its affiliates on January 3, 2009, to allow them to run Saturday morning newscasts or affiliate-purchased E/I programming (the latter of which Fox stations now purchase from the syndication market, as the network decided to stop supplying children's programming on its own), while the latter two hours were kept by Fox to run a network-managed paid programming block named Weekend Marketplace.\n\n1990\n\nAttack of the Killer Tomatoes (1990–1991)\n\nBobby's World (1990–1998)\n\nFun House (1990–1991)\n\nPeter Pan and the Pirates (1990–1992)\n\nPiggsburg Pigs!
