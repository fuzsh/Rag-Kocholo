        "text": "Karma is a reality show created by J.D Roth. It is scheduled for release in June 2020 on the streaming platform HBO Max. It will be produced by GoodStory Entertainment, a production company co-founded by JD Roth with music manager Scooter Braun. Its format has some similarities to previous J.D Roth shows Moolah Beach and Endurance. Unlike those shows, it is hosted by extreme lifestyle enthusiast Michelle Khare instead of Roth.\n\nThe first season consists of 8 1-hour long episodes. The entire first season premiered on June 18, 2020. Prior to the premiere of the series, casting was announced for a second season of the show. However, the series was later taken down from the HBO Max service for unknown reasons and with no further news regarding the possibility of a second season.\n\nFormat[]\n\nRight to Stay[]\n\nLike Endurance, a Right to Stay challenge was played where people would be eliminated before the teams were formed based on their performance in a special challenge. In the first season though, only 1 guy and 1 girl was eliminated as opposed to the usual 3 guys and 3 girls in endurance (with the one-off 2 elimination each in High Sierras).\n\nTeam Selection[]\n\nAfter the right to stay, a challenge is conducted which results in how the remaining players will be paired. Each team consists of one guy and one girl and each team is assigned a different color. The first season contained 8 colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Gray and Pink.\n\nThe laws of Karma[]\n\nEach team upon being paired up got to choose a team color and a pair of law of Karma medallions (each law has 2 medallions) on to represent their team. The Laws were given in form of a medallion with imagery of the law on the front. In this season, 8 laws of Karma came into play:\n\nInspiration\n\nConnection\n\nPatience\n\nGiving\n\nHumility\n\nGrowth\n\nFocus\n\nResponsibility\n\nTeams that were eliminated got to give one of the teams remaining their medallion(s), which would ultimately come into play in the finale challenge. The exception is the third based team's medallions which must be won in a special challenge.\n\nThese are similar to the pyramid pieces from Endurance in that each medallion is based on a specific trait and that they could be handled down to the others teams when one was eliminated. Unlike pyramid pieces or the idols in Moolah Beach, the final mission for the third placed teams' medallions is the only time a team can acquire medallions before the finale.\n\nChallenges[]\n\nOne of the main differences from Karma from Moolah Beach and Endurance is that there is generally only one set of challenges instead of two. Each mission is team oriented and thus both members of a team need to be able to compete or the team must forfeit the mission. The winner of the challenge gets to send any two teams to the Cave of Karma (similar to Endurance's temple missions). One mission allowed the winning team to get a coin which they could use for later if they get sent to the cave of karma or give it to another team. Otherwise, the ability to send teams to the Cave of Karma was the only prize.\n\nThere is a challenge similar to the final pieces mission in Endurance where the final 2 must compete for the third placed teams medallions rather than just inherit them.\n\nKarma Coins[]\n\nAfter the team that won the challenge selected two teams to send to the Cave of Karma, The remaining teams each received a Karma Coin, which they would will to one of the two teams chosen to go to the Cave at the offering. At the offering, Each of the safe teams, excluding the team that won the challenge, came up one at a time and handed their teams coin to the team that they wanted to help at the Cave. The coins would play a role in the cave, and having more coins would give the teams more chances.\n\nThe Cave of Karma[]\n\nThe winning team of the challenge would get to select two team to send to the Cave of Karma, where they would face off in a challenge which would eliminate one team. The challenge at the Cave was to find one (or more*) Karma Coin(s) given to them. The coins were hidden by the opposing team under one of the 10 stone chambers that were on each side. After the hiding of the coins, each team would take turns to find their coin(s) by smashing open one of the chambers. The first team to find that Cave's amount of coins would win and return to the game. The losing team would be eliminated.\n\nSeason 1 Contestants[]\n\nPicture Information Team Position Picture Information Elijah Mack\n\n14, San Diego, CA\n\nGreen 8th Skylie Thompson\n\n15, Cyril, OK\n\nAdren Gilmore\n\n14, Keller, TX\n\nOrange 7th Presley Alexander\n\n14, Los Angeles, CA\n\nElijah \"Eli\" Niadas\n\n14, Melbourne, FL\n\nYellow 6th Illya Mehrzai\n\n14, Houston, TX\n\nHuck Flanagan\n\n15, Pomfret, CT\n\nGray 5th Sienna Coward\n\n14, Martinez, CA\n\nLuke Youssef\n\n14, Hampton Falls, NH\n\nBlue 4th Ariana Pettit\n\n14, St. John, AZ\n\nJustin Darrigo\n\n14, Tweksbury, MA\n\nPink 3rd Avon Stoutamire\n\n15, Mary, SC\n\nAaron Thomas Raye\n\n13, Newburgh, ME\n\nRed 2nd Andrea Munoz\n\n14, Miami, FL\n\nJack Silver\n\n14, Rahway, NJ\n\nPurple 1st Skyla Sousa\n\n14, Lowell, MA\n\nRight To Stay Eliminations[]\n\nPicture Information Picture Information Jack Sliver\n\n14, Rahway, NJ\n\nCiera\n\n14, The Bronx, NY\n\nHarrison Halewood\n\n15, Crowley, TX\n\nQuit\n\nEpisode 2 - Jack was the guy who was eliminated in the Right to Stay challenge.
