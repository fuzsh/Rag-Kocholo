Carleson\n\nAlfred A. Knopf\n\nc/o The Random House Publishing Group\n\n1745 Broadway, 17th floor, New York, NY 10019\n\nhttp://knopfdoubleday.com\n\n9780449809976, $8.80 (PB), 304 pp, Kindle $9.78, www.amazon.com\n\nBrittany Means, Reviewer\n\nwww.brittanymeans.com\n\nWhat would you do if you spent your entire life thinking that you father was a king, only to find out after his death that he was actually a fearsome dictator? In The Tyrant's Daughter, fifteen year-old Laila struggles with this realization as well as with learning how to fit into American culture after what's left of her family is forced to leave their country. Laila faces the daunting world of American high school and dating while also trying to figure out her mother's web of lies that includes a CIA agent and a rebel group. While she attempts to adjust to the strange new world, Laila also must try to keep her family from being swept up in the political mess surrounding her father's legacy in this wonderful young adult novel.\n\nTalented writer and former officer in the CIA's clandestine service, J.C. Carleson gives the reader a look into the mind of a young woman trying to survive in a new culture in spite of the complications of her former life. From the beginning, the reader is pulled in by the intriguing notion of a royal family living in a small apartment in an urban American city. Her brother's young age and her mother's emerging alcoholism show the reader that Laila must take on responsibility for her family's well-being even as she attempts to navigate this new way of life. In one scene with her younger brother, Bastien, he illustrates his naivety to their mother's addiction, and Laila's protective instinct.\n\nBastien sits in the hallway in front of our door, carefully sorting glass from paper. He learned about recycling in school, and he's been a fanatic ever since. I don't have the heart to tell him that I saw the building maintenance crew toss all the bins into one giant Dumpster, mixed together and headed to the same place....I inspect his handiwork. Four clear and three green glass bottles. All alcohol except for a single empty jar of mayonnaise. Wine and gin and whatever else my mother now drinks in place of tea.\n\nThe introduction of CIA agent Gansler complicates the story further when it is revealed that her family's safety in America is in his hands and dependent on their cooperation. Her mother must help him with an unknown plan involving a rebel group from her home country. Laila is forced into a strange alliance with the youngest member of the group, Abed, who clearly hates her family for being a part of the system that caused his family so much grief. As Laila attempts to juggle all of these issues, she must decide where her loyalties lie and what she must give up in order to make things right.\n\nCarleson keeps the reader engaged from start to finish with the seemingly never ending series of complications for poor Laila. Readers quickly become attached to Laila through her first-person narration and budding love for American culture, as portrayed in a scene where she talks about what she loves about her school.\n\nI like my locker. It's a small space of my own--the only one I have. I like my classes, with their lessons so different from those at home. World history is reinvented here--the same stories retold upside down. English class, where contractions are allowed and books are not banned, is a pleasure. I even like PE--boys and girls mixed together, their bare legs so casually mingling.\n\nReading scenes where Laila experiences things for the first time - high school dances, kisses, false bomb threats - was like experiencing them for the first time myself. Every time Laila overheard a new piece of information about her family's plight, I felt my heart race with the urge to know how she would react and what it meant for her family. This story is a wonderful coming-of-age tale that I think anyone would benefit from reading as it illuminates so well the complications of adjusting to a new culture and learning how people and American values work. It's hard to decide which route you want Laila to take, and by the end you feel as if you've made the journey with her.\n\nThe Jesus Bible, NIV: Discover Jesus in Every Book of the Bible\n\nZondervan Publishing House\n\n3900 Sparks Drive Grand Rapids, MI 49546\n\n9780310726005, $29.99, 1760 Pages, www.amazon.com\n\nCheri Clay\n\nReviewer\n\nIt's hard to find a good Bible for middle-age kids ages 9-12 years. There are plenty to choose from for younger kids and teenagers but it seems the middle-agers or nine to twelve year-olds it's hard for a Bible to hold their attention. Here is the answer the perfect Bible for your kids!\n\nAs a Sunday school teacher I am excited about this new kids Bible from Zondervan. It clearly has everything necessary in an adult Bible but in a kid format. This great Bible has it all from timelines, maps, devotions, concordance and so much more. I really love \"the simplified family tree of Jesus\" since even most adults don't like reading this and this breaks it down into an easy format. The devotions are excellent spread throughout but there is also an easy index in a unique section of Study Helps in the back of the book. I say unique as study helps are unusual for a kids Bible. I highly recommend this outstanding kids Bible. I know the age recommendation is for nine to twelve year olds but I would recommend for eight through teenage as this would be perfect as a child's first big boy or big girl Bible and last through adulthood. I love the cover that will surely get your child's attention and start them on a lifetime of reading God's Word.\n\nNoah and the Mighty Ark\n\nRhonda Gowler Greene\n\nIllustrated by Margaret L. Spengler\n\nZonderkidz\n\nc/o Zondervan Publishing House\n\n5300 Patterson Avenue, S.E., Grand Rapids, MI 49530\n\nwww.zondervan.com\n\n9780310732174, $9.99, www.amazon.com\n\nMary Crocco, Reviewer\n\nmrc-bookreviewer.blogspot.com\n\nSuitable for young readers, Noah and the Mighty Ark is a delightful Bible story penned in rhyme. Adding to children's learning experiences; the author includes challenging vocabulary words. For example - And creatures in that mighty ark all lined up to disembark.\n\nA Genesis quote from God to Noah begins the book. \"Make yourself an ark out of cypress wood... bring two of every living thing into the ark.\" An impressive approach to describe the wood of the ark.\n\nGreene continues to introduce new terms. Here she explains the construction of the ark - He built a boat lined with pitch so it would float.\n\nChildren will learn the value of hard work by following Noah's family working together to achieve their goal. For example, His sons brought water, seed, and hay. They filled the ark by night and day.\n\nGreene includes the famous mountain's name in this manner - And Ararat, a mountain steep, became a perch from waters deep.\n\nNoah and the Mighty Ark may become a favorite choice for toddlers through the age of six.\n\nThe accurate illustrations created a blurred style, which I found unnecessary.\n\nSupercell\n\nH.W. \"Buzz\" Bernard\n\nBell Bridge Books\n\nc/o BelleBooks\n\nP.O.

An EF-5 tornado is barreling down on you! Do you know what to do to remain safe? Luckily for you, all you have to do is turn the page: you're out on the Great Plains with Chuck Rittenburg and his motley storm chasing crew attempting to film one of nature's most beautiful - and dangerous - phenomena.\n\nJerry Metcalf, of Global-American Cinema, drops by Chuck Rittenburg's grubby apartment in Norman, Oklahoma, in the hopes of dragging Chuck out of his self-imposed retirement. Once a nationally acclaimed stormchaser, Chuck stopped chasing - recreationally and professionally - when a couple was tragically killed on one of his Thunder Road Tours storm treks. So when Metcalf offers him $500,000 to help track down a supercell storm, one that must include an EF-5 tornado, Chuck immediately turns him down. Yet, Chuck, though rundown, is still intelligent. He contacts Metcalf, in the hopes that maybe this opportunity, but more importantly, the money, could help get his life back on track, redeem himself in the eyes of his estranged son, Ty. Chuck states that he will chase for one million dollars, and with reluctance, Metcalf agrees. There's still a catch, though: Chuck only has two weeks to find this perfect storm...or he doesn't get any of the money.\n\nH.W. \"Buzz\" Bernard, talented author of Supercell and two other novels, thickens the plot by introducing two brothers who, under the guise of paramedics, chase storms to steal from the wreckage. In order to stop these bandits, an FBI agent, Gabriela Medeiros, tags along on Chuck's filming expedition pretending to be a journalist. Not only is Chuck now attempting to find the film crew the perfect storm, but he's also trying to meet up with the wanted criminals, too. Bernard gave his main character as difficult a situation as possible, which was enjoyable for me as the reader because it kept me wondering if Chuck was going to be able to handle everything tossed his way. It added to the suspense.\n\nSpeaking of suspense, upon reading the novel, I often times found Bernard's writing style to be formulaic. What I mean by this is that there was a clear pattern to how the plot would rise and fall as it built up to the climax. Chuck and the crew would go through a series of advancements and setbacks in a sort of obvious way. At times, I found myself thinking, \"Okay, here's another setback, but the next reversal will be one forward.\" Yet, Bernard was able to make the ending of the novel unclear through the use of a complex plot line that finally comes together at the climax in an unsuspected way.\n\nOnce the plot pattern was established, though, I decided to Google Bernard. I had a feeling he might have been a scientist and, sure enough, he had been a meteorologist who had minored in creative writing. His ability to explain meteorological terms succinctly and clearly made for smooth reading and added realism to the piece. For example, Chuck explains CAPE and CIN to Gabi and his son, Ty: \"'It's CAPE and CIN,' Chuck said, and spelled out the acronyms. 'CAPE stands for Convective Available Potential Energy. It's a measure of how much energy - fuel - there is in the atmosphere for thunderstorm development. The more energy there is, the bigger and nastier the storms are likely to be.'\" Bernard peppers the novel with explanations such as these and through these simple definitions of more complex theories, the reader can understand what is going on without being bogged down by the science aspect. He even includes a glossary at the end of the book that contains all the terminology used in the book. I really appreciated that about Bernard's style.\n\nOverall, I thought that Bernard was able to craft quite the thriller novel through the blend of science and creative writing. Personally, this book was exceptionally thrilling because Bernard and I are sort of opposites: whereas he was a professional scientist who did writing on the side, I am a writer who's minoring in meteorology. Anyone who finds tornadoes and massive storms fascinating will surely enjoy this book, as I have. It's like talking a walk on the wild side - but a heck of a lot safer.\n\nToo Hot to Touch: The Problem of High-Level Nuclear Waste\n\nWilliam M. & Rosemarie Alley\n\nCambridge University Press\n\n32 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10013-2473\n\n9781107030114, $29.99, www.cambridge.org\n\nHoward G. Wilshire\n\nReviewer\n\nToo Hot to Touch is presented as a treatise on problems of high-level nuclear waste, but it liberally mixes poorly described arcane scientific subjects with accounts that have nothing to do with high-level radioactive waste (HLRW). The audience the authors wanted to reach is not clear. The book's 22 chapters are arranged in almost random order under three headings, two of which contain chapters unrelated to the headings or the book's primary topic. Thus, continuity is hard to identify. Too many very relevant works are omitted, and too much background information is embroidered with facile expressions, presumably designed to engage the reader's attention, but which are mainly distracting. The book is reviewed as a whole in a blog on my website available at www.theamericanwestatrisk.com.\n\nThis review focuses on one of the 22 chapters, with which I take particular exception: I regard Chapter 10, A can of worms, as an insider's misrepresentation of issues surrounding the proposal of a Low-Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) disposal facility in Ward Valley, California. I was directly involved in this matter and was criticized, along with respected colleagues, in this book. William Alley was also personally involved in this issue as a U.S. Geological Survey employee, but does not disclose that fact in his book.\n\nThe core of the story told in Chapter 10 is: 1) disruption of the process of establishing a LLRW disposal facility at Ward Valley, California by three U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) geologists the Alleys call the \"Wilshire group\" (myself and two other senior USGS geologists); 2) the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) review of 7 concerns of the \"Wilshire group\" raised with Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt; and 3) the testimony of David Prudic, USGS hydrologist, before the NAS panel. Other important issues are dealt with on my website. For clarification, I have filled in some information that the Alleys do not discuss.\n\nChapter 10 starts by setting up David Prudic as a principal scientist in the publicly contentious issue of establishing a LLRW facility at Ward Valley, California. This is done in a folksy way, but describes him as \"a stickler for detail and scientific rigor\" with important information to present to the NAS panel gathered in Needles, California July 7-9, 1994. The meeting was enjoined by the NAS to examine the \"Wilshire group's\" concerns as previously outlined for the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nEnroute to Prudic's testimony, the \"Wilshire group\" is charged in the book with various sins, the most significant one, made twice, is they \"raised issues [about the safety of Ward Valley] outside their field of training and expertise (p. 137).\" For William Alley, this seems to be a claim of territorial rights-a presumption that only hydrogeologists (including him), are qualified to talk about water movement in the subsurface, and not geologists (particularly the \"Wilshire group\").\n\nLesser charges were made of breaching USGS protocols by directly contacting Interior Secretary Babbitt with their concerns (I plead guilty; otherwise our concerns would not have reached the Secretary); and sending a \"detailed report\" on their concerns to Babbitt \"Sthat had not gone through the peer-review process that precedes release of any USGS scientific document (p. 137).\" The Alleys are wrong on both counts: the \"detailed report\" was not sent to Babbit, but rather to the person who requested it, U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer, and it was peer-reviewed.\n\nHere is what really happened: The \"Wilshire group\" sent a one-page memorandum (February 24, 1993) to Secretary Babbitt expressing our concern about the inadequacies of the very limited USGS involvement in preparation of the Ward Valley Environmental Impact Report/Statement (EIR/S), and offering our assistance as he evaluated transfer of federal land to the state of California-we were, after all, his employees since the USGS is an agency within the Department of the Interior, and we did have expert experience with the geology of the Ward Valley region. On May 26, 1993 we were invited by the Secretary's office to submit a statement of our concerns, which we provided in a two and one-half page outline, dated June 2. We had no further contact with Secretary Babbitt.\n\nSecretary Babbitt's staff (unknown to us) released our June 2 memo, a copy of which found its way to the company-US Ecology-that was licensed by the State of California to operate the Ward Valley dump. US Ecology sent Babbitt a lengthy rebuttal of our short outline. We were completely unaware of that document until September 1993 when we were contacted by Senator Boxer's office. When they discovered we had not seen the US Ecology rebuttal, they sent a copy and asked for our response. After reading it, we told Boxer's staff that it was \"slick and wrong.\" Senator Boxer then asked us by letter to respond to the US Ecology critique and elaborate our concerns. It is that report (we call it the \"Boxer report\")-sent to Senator Boxer December 2, 1993 that the Alleys erroneously refer to on p. 137. We did go through USGS channels for approval to respond to Boxer.\n\nStrangely, the Alleys miss two main points about peer-review of the report: it was the decision of USGS management, in which William Alley participated, that our response to the US Ecology rebuttal be done as private citizens, and the report therefore did not go through the USGS peer-review process. It appears also that the Alleys did not read the \"Boxer report\" as its title page and text acknowledge peer reviewers.1\n\nIn preparation for the NAS review, the \"Wilshire group\" expanded to 10 members (by agreement with the National Research Council (NRC), six of whom are USGS scientists,2 but continued to be identified by the Alleys as three geologists raising issues \"outside their field of training and expertise.\" All seven of our concerns were addressed by experts on the NAS panel, but I will address only the issue of contaminant migration through thick \"dry\" (unsaturated) zones to the water table. Widely considered geologic barriers to contamination of groundwater, thick unsaturated zones represent formidable barriers at Ward Valley (~650 feet thick) and at the Beatty Nevada LLRW disposal site (~280 to 370 feet thick), the latter studied by Prudic and colleagues. Promoted by Ward Valley supporters as geologic analogs, information about either of the two sites was deemed applicable to the other.\n\nThe Alleys present their own assessment of this issue, leading to the testimony of David Prudic regarding his long-term USGS research at the Beatty LLRW facility. The bottom line of Prudic's testimony was that rain water percolation at Beatty and Ward Valley had been restricted to the upper ~30 feet of the thick unsaturated zones during the past 16,000 to 33,000 years. Therefore, contamination of the groundwater by materials dumped at those sites was not credible, at least for thousands of years.\n\nThere was, however, the inconvenient finding during Ward Valley site characterization of a very small amount of tritium at a depth of 100 feet. Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, was a major component of fallout worldwide from bomb testing during the Cold War; it is also a major constituent of radioactive materials dumped at Beatty. Tritium migrates with water and fallout tritium is widely used as a tracer for water movement in the subsurface. Hence, the finding at a depth of 100 feet in Ward Valley, if correct, would mean it had traveled 100 feet in less than 50 years, and would thus contradict Prudic's conclusions. Discussion was vigorous, with most of the NAS panel leaning toward discounting the Ward Valley data as resulting from improper sampling or analytical error.\n\nDuring Prudic's presentation, he was asked by a panel member if he had any tritium data on the unsaturated zone at Beatty. His answer was that samples had been submitted for analysis but he had not seen the results. The Alleys' characterization of this episode (p. 144-145) was that \"Prior to the [NAS] meeting Prudic learned that the tritium results had come back and were larger than expected, but he hadn't seen the results.\" Prudic avoided answering the question and the Alleys book tries to make it appear that he had told the panel of the results, but he had not. Put plainly, Prudic was informed by telephone of the tritium findings by his colleague Robert Striegl two weeks before the NAS meeting, but he hadn't received a copy of the piece of paper on which the lab report was written.\n\nFurther questioning revealed that Prudic did in fact have data showing groundwater contamination by tritium in a well drilled by USGS in 1987 just outside the dump. Groundwater was sampled once in 1989 yielding replicated positive tritium values. Prudic speculated that the tritium came from drilling fluid from the 1987 well emplacement. Continued probing revealed major tritium contamination of groundwater in a US Ecology monitoring well very close to the USGS well in 1982-1984, for which Prudic had no explanation.\n\nPrudic's failure to inform the panel of what he really knew about the new tritium results, whether or not he had seen them on a piece of paper, had a significant impact on the NAS panel's report. Four months after release of that report on May 11, 1995, a panel member made the following statement to a meeting of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:\n\nMr. Wierenga: [Excerpt] \"I had the pleasure this year to serve on a national academy panel to look into Ward Valley. As you know, Ward Valley was licensed by the State of California as a disposal site for low level nuclear waste. And it became very clear to the panel that it was not possible to give this site favorable recommendation just based on the data from the contractor. There would have been no chance in the world that we would have had the majority of the committee do this. As it is, there's all the additional information, some of it at Yucca Mountain, some of it at the Beatty site, some of it from New Mexico [WIPP site], some of it from Texas [Sierra Blanca] - the committee basically disagreed with the three hydrologists [sic][\"Wilshire group\"] who said that the site was not suitable and there were major problems.\"3\n\nThe problem is that Beatty was the only facility among the sites listed that had actually served as a waste depository, and Prudic had left the panel uninformed about new data in hand that had the potential to directly contradict his hypothesis. Models of processes in the unsaturated zone serve useful purposes, but they can only be verified by real data on what has actually happened or is happening. Prudic's model was in jeopardy, and he seemed reluctant to inform the panel of potential problems, old ones as well as budding ones. Absent from the Alleys' book is any discussion of these issues. The NAS report's majority decided (p. 23) \"Sthat the Beatty site may be useful in understanding some natural processes, but it is limited in evaluating the behavior of the Ward Valley site because of the historical uncertainties.\" That is, because of \"unexplained anomalies in the 30-year monitoring records of well data.\"4\n\nFallout from Prudic's choice to leave the panel uninformed of his preliminary tritium results was a split decision of the panel's recommendation to verify the small tritium values reported for Ward Valley. The majority of panelists favored performing the new measurements during site development, an expression of their confidence that the original measurement was in error. Two panelists favored verification before the dump was permitted. What influence Prudic's data might have had is unknown, but the panel's report was seen as a green light for constructing the dump, mitigated by a number of recommendations including testing for tritium. Preparations were made, but never realized, by the Interior Secretary to transfer the land to the State of California. The aftermath of release of the NAS report is a story of its own, addressed only in very small part by the Alleys.\n\nNOTES\n\n1\"Boxer report\" disclaimer: \"This report does not represent the policies or positions of any government agency. It does represent the professional judgments of its authors who are employed by the U.S. Geological Survey as research geologists. The report has been reviewed by professional scientists in geology, hydrology, isotope geochemistry, and soil physics, and has been modified by consultation with many experts in these fields within and outside of the USGS\"\n\n2The group is composed of five geologists, two hydrologists, one soil physicist, one isotope geochemist, and one biologist. The NRC denied us our choice of an expert on the LLRW waste stream, a very controversial issue.\n\n3There are two errors in Wierenga's statement: the panel was charged only with evaluating the seven concerns of the \"Wilshire group\", not sanctioning the site. We made it clear to the panel that we did not have a position on the suitability of the site for the proposed use; our problems were with the adequacy of the EIR/S' supporting data and analysis.\n\n4What the NAS panel knew about contamination of groundwater at Beatty eight months before releasing its report and should have influenced the majority vote of approbation for the Ward Valley site is described in my blog, but is readily available in the two dissenting opinions of the NAS report, National Research Council, Ward Valley: An Examination of Seven Issues in Earth Sciences and Ecology, National Academy Press, 1995, Appendices E and F.\n\nThese Things Happen\n\nRichard Kramer\n\nUnbridled Books\n\n2000 Wadsworth Blvd., #195, Lakewood, CO 80214\n\n9781609530891, $18.27 (HC), $12.53 (PB), www.amazon.com\n\nJanet Walker\n\nReviewer\n\nBeing cherished is about the best thing that can happen to you on Planet Earth. Relationships where the cherishment (not sure if that's a word) is one-sided often run into difficulty when trouble strikes. Trouble does call around in Richard Kramer's new novel of contemporary family life, These Things Happen and the cherishing lacking in the blend of second time around couplings and the effect on the first time around child ensures that it will change the course of what hitherto had been on the surface anyway, a loving family group.\n\nThe story revolves around fifteen-year-old Wesley's effort to build a meaningful relationship with his gay father, Kenny. An attorney who deals with gay issues, Kenny is the go-to-guy for the media on all things gay. Divorced from Lola when Wesley was ten-years-old Kenny moved in with George, an ex-actor who now runs a restaurant.\n\nWesley lives with Lola who is married to ophthalmologist, Ben, a nice guy, who tries to act as a friend to his stepson rather than a father figure. Lola decides it's time Wesley got to know Kenny and he is packed off for a trial period to live with his father and George in the small apartment they share above George's restaurant.\n\nRichard Kramer writes in an intimate style; thoughts and conversations are narrated as if the reader is either present or privy to a character's innermost feelings. The story is told in named chapters as each character, including Wesley and his best friend, Theo, muse or talk about the problems associated with life generally and more particularly, father/son intimacy when the father, Kenny uses 'call waiting' (usually in excess of a hundred) as an excuse to short circuit any conversation that touches on intimate issues with his son.\n\nGeorge, aware and distressed that Kenny doesn't get it with regard to his son's need for guidance to chart the minefield of adolescence does his best to act as an understudy mentor and he and Wesley develop a friendship based on shared interests.\n\nTheo and Wesley's friendship is tested when Theo, after winning a school election, publicly announces that he is gay. Wesley, a thoughtful intelligent teenager, digests Theo's unexpected news and concludes that nothing has really changed - Theo is still his best buddy whatever his sexual predilection.\n\nUnfortunately, Wesley's 'no problem' attitude is not shared by some of the other school students and a violent episode occurs which effects both boys and impacts badly on the family group.\n\nGeorge, the hero of the piece, gathers them all together; Kenny, Lola, Ben and Wesley to resolve issues that have arisen around Theo's 'coming out'. Lola, who has always espoused a 'live and let live' attitude to gayness, behaves like a vindictive dope; vilifying George, she reduces his group status to victim and alienates Wesley, who disappears.\n\nKenny, ineffectual as usual, doesn't know what to do so that's what he does - nothing. George and Kenny's relationship is in trouble; during the short time Wesley has stayed with them, George has begun to care for him, appreciating the smart funny boy who is fumbling his way towards becoming an adult. He is upset by Kenny virtually ignoring his son's need for reassurance and feels that Kenny does not value or cherish people close to him. George tells Kenny how he feels and it becomes apparent to Kenny that if he wants to save their relationship he had better turn off 'call waiting' and attend to the needs of those who love him.\n\nThe conclusion to this very real, poignant and often laugh-out-loud story does not provide all the answers for modern living but it does give the characters an insight into their own failings and the hope that more understanding and intimacy will prevail for the group in the future.\n\nFor a first novel, These Things Happen, is a grand achievement. My only quibble is that it was a little 'wordy' at times, mostly with the characterization of George. That said, this book is a valuable addition to literature that looks at modern life; the problems that arise in creating supportive relationships are applicable to both gay and hetero family groups.\n\nWell done Mr. Kramer, These Things Happen is an excellent read.\n\nThe Shaping of Water\n\nRuth Hartley\n\nMatador Books\n\nc/o Troubador Publishing Ltd.\n\n9 Priory Business Park, Kibworth, Leicester\n\nLeicestershire LE8 0RW United Kingdom\n\n9781783061990, eBook: $7.99, www.amazon.com\n\nKrissy McCracken\n\nReviewer\n\nA basic plot line to the book is that of many different people with a common link between them trying to conquer many different trials from survival to war to love to uncertainty. This book follows the world that is now so different from the norm and how the characters react to it and learn to live in the change. This book is written from a third person perspective. The author most likely wrote on this subject, because she lived through it during her years in Africa. The audience would be adults rather than a younger audience, because of the several ideas of this novel. Hartley, the author, does not seem to write this book in an informal way. She more writes in a way that is educated, but does not use this as an analysis. In a complete sense of the book, I enjoyed the book. I thought that it was entertaining and it was something that made me really think of the ways the world is. If given the chance I would read more from this author. I enjoyed the fact that the book had a relatable quality to it and that the themes were easy to comprehend. Change was one of the most interesting themes to me since the world seems to always want to follow that philosophy and I think that the author did a splendid job at making the audience see the change and how the characters dealt with it.\n\nThis book, The Shaping of Water by Ruth Hartley, used a great idea of connectedness to get the audience to fully comprehend the theme. The way the overlapping of characters played out made it very relatable. The weaving of the different people that the audience comes to know and the ways they collide becomes a great way to see the story. The unexpected connections are somehow believable in this tale. There are ways that people are related without even knowing the real reason, and this brings that out in a similar way making it seem to be more of a character driven work.\n\nAlong with that theme of connections, the book has very many other themes. Although the work brings them out in an understandable light and makes the readers comprehend and feel the idea of what the author is trying to say, it can make for a little too much for the audience to have to think. If there were a limited number of ideas in the book it might be clearer and more apt to hit on some more important ones in a better light. Reading a book with multiple themes could be tricky for any reader. The person may not fully understand at the beginning of why it was harder to get into the book at the time, but then if that same said person examines the book closer, they will be able to tell the different themes in the book and why that makes the piece more complex than other works that the reader has chosen to partake in reading. I also thought that the title was a good idea for the book. It not only goes with the ideas of the book, but also gives the audience something to think about.\n\nRuth Hartley actually lived a lot of her life in the same part of Africa. This was very helpful in the setting especially. The author really gave the reader a vision of what the place was like which can be seen through a number of quotes in the book starting with the very first one,\n\n\"The steep hillside on which the cottage was built was covered by scrubby undergrowth without many big trees. The contractor simply cleared away the bush and any wood that the labourers could not find a use for was piled into heaps and burnt... The hillside was so steep that it was not possible to see the bottom terrace from the new weranda of the cottage, or to see more than the edge of the corrugated asbestos of the cottage from the place where there might one day be water.\"\n\nBeing able to see the entire picture of a book is very important. That makes it so the audience is able to understand what is going on perfectly. She also shows that there is a unique aspect to the book by telling the audience more detailed information leading to the knowledge that this is in Africa.\n\n\"It is too hazy to see the Matusadona Hills. Michael has seen a pair of hornbills, and a golden oriole and two hoopoes. There was a short wind storm but mostly it has been pleasant. The boys made a fire on the beach and cooked their own boerewors.\"\n\nThis shows that knowledge by giving the name of specific things to the culture of Africa which is different than the other books one comes to read from an American style. It gives a sense of the different culture of Africa and makes the reader understand the background a little more. Which is also helped by the time lines and glossary added in the book.\n\nMind Games: A Cassie Scot Novel\n\nChristine Amsden\n\nhttp://www.christineamsden.com\n\nTwilight Times Books\n\nPO Box 3340, Kingsport, TN 37664\n\nwww.twilighttimesbooks.com\n\n9781606192795, $17.95 USD, 276 pages\n\n9781606192788; $6.50 USD, eBook\n\nMayra Calvani\n\nReviewer\n\nDistributors: Amazon Kindle; Apple iBookstore; BN.com Nook; Kobo Books; OmniLit, etc\n\nRelease date: April 15, 2014 ebook; June 15, 2014 trade paperback\n\nGenre: paranormal fantasy\n\nMind Games is the much awaited third installment in the new adult mystery series, Cassie Scot: ParaNormal Detective. Talented author Christine Amsden keeps delivering a great story filled with interesting characters, romance, mystery, and the paranormal, lots of it.\n\nIn this episode, Cassie still doesn't know why Evan broke her heart two months ago, and the mystery gnaws at her big time. She decides to keep busy and make herself useful at the sheriff's department. She also meets charismatic mind mage Matthew Blair...much to Evan's distaste. At the same time, Eagle Rock is teeming with hate from the religious community, a reaction to the recent murder of a much-esteemed pastor's wife by what the people believe was a sorcerer. The town is about to snap, with tensions between the magical and non-magical communities.\n\nAnd in the center of all this, is Matthew, whom Cassie finds irresistible. But can she trust him? According to Evan, no way. But then, Evan isn't the most objective person when it comes to Cassie. Evan and Cassie have a history, as well as a secret connection, that keeps them bound in spite of themselves.\n\nWill Cassie discover the real culprit or culprits behind the pastor's wife's murder, as well as the real face behind the anti-magical propaganda and demonstrations? Most importantly, will she wake up and see Matthew for who he really is...and find the courage to face Evan for what he did to her - when she finds out?\n\nI love this series and thoroughly enjoyed this instalment! There's something about Cassie's voice that makes her really likable. She has a good heart and is witty, too. But best of all, she is just an ordinary girl next door trying to do her best in spite of everything that happens around her - which is usually pretty remarkable, as is often the case in paranormal stories.\n\nHer relationship with Evan keeps evolving organically and there's a major revelation in this book about their connection and the secret behind their rival families. Matthew is a great addition to this episode, adding tension with his charismatic personality and inciting sparks of jealousy from Evan. The conflict between the religious and the magical communities is also well done.\n\nMind Games kept me reading late into the night, wondering what would happen next. If you haven't read any books in this series before, I urge you to pick up book one first, Cassie Scot: ParaNormal Detective. The books are best read in order. You won't be disappointed.\n\nHow to Fight Presidents\n\nThree Rivers Press\n\nc/o The Random House Publishing Group\n\n1745 Broadway, 17th floor, New York, NY 10019\n\nwww.crownpublishing.com\n\n9780385347587, 254 pages, $15.00, www.amazon.com\n\nPaul Lappen, Reviewer\n\nwww.deadtreesreview.com\n\nDid you know that a number of former American Presidents would fit in quite well in a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger action film? Imagine that they now want to beat you to a pulp. What do you do?\n\nThomas Jefferson designed his own tombstone (among many other things). He intentionally left out any mention of his time as President, because he didn't think it was that important. To quote from this book, \"If \"leaving your Presidency off of your tombstone\" isn't the nineteenth-century equivalent of \"walking away from an explosion without turning around to look at it,\" then I don't know what is.\" John Quincy Adams was involved in fighting the British when he was eight years old (What were you doing at eight years old?). He also swam the width of the Potomac every day at 5 AM, and thought that having sex outside in the snow was a good idea. James Madison may have been short and scrawny, but he did grab a couple of pistols and a horse, and rode out to the front lines to fight the British during the War of 1812 (as a sitting President).\n\nIt takes a peculiar amount of ego and ambition to want to be President, but Andrew \"Old Hickory\" Jackson belongs in a category by himself. At age thirteen, as a British prisoner of war, Jackson was forced to march forty miles, barefoot, with an undressed head wound, and suffering from smallpox. If there were no wars to fight, Jackson liked real duels. On one occasion, Jackson allowed the other man to shoot first. The bullet almost hit his heart. Jackson then shot and killed the other man.\n\nIf a person wanted a private word with Lyndon Johnson, the person frequently had to follow Johnson into the bathroom and watch him poop. Johnson's sexual conquest numbers, while President, were comparable to John Kennedy, the King of Presidential Sexual Conquests. Chester Arthur is compared to Lex Luthor, and Ronald Reagan is compared to Wolverine. William Howard Taft once got stuck in a bathtub; it took four men to extricate him. The biography of Calvin Coolidge reads like the origins of a serial killer. Every day, Herbert Hoover played a game with his friends called Hooverball. Think of volleyball played with a ten-pound medicine ball.\n\nGet past the foul language in \"How to Fight Presidents: Defending Yourself Against the Badasses Who Ran This Country Daniel O'Brien\", and this is a huge eye-opener. The reader will look at the past inhabitants of the Oval Office in a whole new way. It's also really funny. This is highly recommended for everyone.\n\nFeed\n\nM. T. Anderson\n\nCandlewick Press\n\n99 Dover Street, Somerville, MA 02144\n\nwww.candlewick.com\n\n9780763662622, $8.99, 320pp, www.amazon.com\n\nZoe Fisher\n\nReviewer\n\nFeed is authored by M.T Anderson, who is an American writer who has also created picture books, teenage literature, and adult books. His book Feed was a national book award finalist, and is read by teenagers all over the world as it is a science fiction futuristic book, with compelling language that every teenage can relate to. I chose this book to review as my first impression of it interested me, as it sounded like it was nothing like I had ever read before.\n\nFeed is set in futuristic America, in a technology based world where at least 70% of all Americans have this technology called Feed set into their brains at a voluntarily young age. It allows you to access unlimited and constant internet that connects to every thought, emotion and feeling to allow advertisements, solutions and information to flow through your mind. The book is narrated in first-person by a teenage boy called Titus, starting when he and his friends decide to spend some time of spring break on the moon. Here, they meet an odd but beautiful girl named Violet. Here, when out at a nightclub, they get hi-jacked and their feeds have to be shut down and re-imaged, so the six teenagers are left without their feed for a couple of days. The narrator and main character is a boy named Titus, and as the story wears on, gets involved in a close relationship with Violet, who starts a project to 'resist the feed'- as she has very political and informed opinions passed down from her father. However, because she only got her feed when she was seven, it keeps on malfunctioning and having problems, so therefore it is a major health risk that becomes more serious as the book goes on.\n\nThis book is extremely well thought out and thorough when contemplating the differences in the future. There are different names, foods, words and entertainment that make the story more believable, as it is highly unlikely that the world will be the same in the future. There is also a massive development in technology- space travel, up-cars (flying cars), tubes for the up-cars to go through, different layers of suburbs, each with its own season and weather. It is a different generation of names (Calista, Loga, Quendy), and creating a baby is done in two separate rooms, and can be designed to look and act like a living person, in a centre called the 'Ceptionarium'. The detail that has been included in the book made me want to know more about the world, and wonder whether some of them were predictions from the author. This was the one of the main reasons that I wanted to keep reading - the plot didn't interest me as much as the world created within the pages.\n\nI found while reading Feed, there wasn't much character description, so I found it hard to imagine the characters physically in my head. Also, as it skipped a lot of time periods, I found that I didn't really sympathise and care about the characters involved because I was missing a lot of their character development. I had trouble deciphering some of the futuristic words -skip, unit, youch, skeeze, meg, brag, mal- and therefore were confused in some parts of the book. It was slow explanation about feeds, I didn't know what it was until part two, which was at least 40 pages into the story.\n\nThe way that M.T Anderson wrote the book was definitely aim at young adults as it was extremely casual in speech with swear words and references to crude subjects. This was a nice touch, as it made it more appealing to me as I was surrounded by language that I am surrounded by in everyday life. It was strange to read, because in speech M.T Anderson was incredibly unsophisticated and unclean, but the describing in the book was really very well done. The themes of the book were relevant to today's world as well, and the messages about technology, the environment and the way the world works should really be given some serious thought. There is no doubt that he is a good writer.\n\nOverall, this book had some good points and some bad. I didn't find myself connecting with the storyline and the characters, and I would have preferred more information that M.T Anderson created. However, the messages and ideas that the book implied I found interesting, and I will remember. It was well written, but I think it is not my preferred genre of reading material. Therefore I rate it 7 STARS OUT OF TEN.\n\nThe Butcher\n\nJennifer Hillier\n\nThreshold\n\nc/o Simon & Schuster\n\n1230 Avenue of the Americas, 13th fl., New York, NY 10020\n\nwww.pocketbooks.com\n\n9781476734217, $25.00, www.amazon.com\n\nEric Long\n\nReviewer\n\nA presumed dead serial killer reemerges, hounding the streets of Seattle thirty years after he was shot and killed by lead detective Edward Shanks. Can the city that barely survived his first coming deal with his return? Jennifer Hillier, author of Freak and Creep, published in 2011 and 2012 respectively, has made a small claim to fame among thriller and dark fiction fans, with me newly among them. Her newest novel, The Butcher, set for publishing on July 15, 2014, might just surpass her last novels' success.\n\nThe Butcher, a deranged serial killer who haunted the streets of fictional Seattle in 1985, finally met his end at the hands of Edward Shanks, propelling Shanks's career forward to Chief of Police in the process. Now, in 2014, a macabre cast of characters is plagued by a past rooted in the Butcher's murders, as they attempt to adjust to the challenges of their new lives. Matt Shanks, Edward's grandson, has recently moved into his grandfather's affluent house in Sweet-Bay; however, the joy of owning a new house is short lived, as Matt stumbles upon some ancient secrets his grandfather failed to conceal. Meanwhile, Samantha, Matt's girlfriend of three years, combs the net and her police connections for her latest true crime novel, Butcherville. Sam has reason to believe the Butcher killed her mother two years after he was supposedly gunned down.\n\nJennifer Hillier's The Butcher is written in third person limited, using main protagonists' Matt, Edward, and Sam as the eyes and ears of the reader. Hillier divides her chapters by perspectives, successfully allowing the reader to inhabit each character's perspective throughout the story. This choice of narration becomes particularly effective in the case of Edward Shanks, my favorite character in the novel. About nine pages into the book, it's revealed that Edward Shanks is not the hero of Seattle everyone makes him out to be, but in reality, is a psychopathic serial killer. One of the most enthralling aspects of the novel is Edward's imperturbable, maniac viewpoint. Anyone familiar with the television series Dexter will immediately recognize the kind of psychopathic inner dialogue Edward brings to the narrative; however, unlike Dexter, Edward Shanks is not the vigilante bringer of justice Dexter is made out to be, which is why I found Shanks so gratifyingly deplorable.\n\nEdward Shanks was truly the highlight of the novel. Shanks's profound psychological observations leave the reader craving further depths into his psyche. Largely, one of the reasons I couldn't seem to put the book down was because I couldn't wait for Edward's chapters, which were always disturbing.\n\nJamie. He couldn't help but smile when he thought of her. What a delicious little things she'd been, with her bleached blond hair and black roots, the cubic zirconia nose stud, the way she'd cried once she finally figured out she was going to die, so wonderfully lithe and squirmy. They always cried. And they always squirmed.\n\nIt seems prudent to mention here that the Butcher is a serial killer and rapist. That is his method of operation. However, Jennifer doesn't divulge the gory details of the events. The passage above is about the extent of how graphically the rape scenes are covered.\n\nWhile I wholeheartedly found myself captivated in the plot of The Butcher and the ripples of his murders, the love story subplot was found wanting. The love triangle seemed obligatory and distracting from the main story.\n\nAmerica has a fascination with serial killers, and Jennifer Hillier delivers infallibly in that department. The plot, while leading at times, will never fail to shock and sweetly cause you to cringe. Often at times, after I had been won over by Edward's irresistible dementedness, I'd find myself cheering for him over the other characters. Anyone who considers themselves fans of horrors or thrillers will most certainly enjoy this book, and I'd give a stronger recommendation to those specifically interested in psychopaths/serial killers. Because, believe me when I say, Edward Shanks is one you won't soon forget.\n\nMeditation Illuminated: Simple Ways to Manage Your Busy Mind\n\nJoy Rains\n\nwww.joyrains.com\n\ntwitter: @joy_rains\n\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/joyrains\n\nWhole Earth Press\n\nPO Box 34816, Bethesda, MD 20827\n\nwww.WholeEarthPress.com\n\n9780988669901, $15.00, 172 pages\n\nFran Ponick, Reviewer\n\nThe Washington Times Communities\n\nJoy Rains, author of Meditation Illuminated, defines meditation as \"a discipline of training the mind through the practice of awareness.\" She states that the nature of the mind is to generate content, or stuff, meaning Stories, Thoughts, Urges, Frustrations, and Feelings.\n\nMost of us react to life and the \"stuff\" that's in it. Meditation is a way to control your stuff by learning to become aware of it. If you can become directly aware of your stuff, you can respond to it - and to your daily life - consciously.\n\nDesperately seeking alpha: Beyond the monkey brain\n\nThink about it: Never in the history of the world have we humans been more aware that our brains are actually electrochemical computing devices. But never in the history of the world have so many individuals been bombarded with so much data.\n\nOutside stimuli produce what are termed high beta frequencies in the brain. It's hard to think straight if your brain is buzzing along at 14 - 40 cycles per second (cps), which is what's happening when you're in that state. These are your \"monkey brain\" moments. Trying to get something done, make a decision, solve a problem, or learn anything? You'd be better off swinging in trees.\n\nAll the things that fall into the general category of cogitation simply can't be done in beta. You need to get to alpha (7.5 - 14 cps), or maybe even theta (4.0 - 7.5 cps).\n\nWhat we need is some kind of surge protector. It's time to conserve our circuitry by controlling our random reactions to more data hits than we can handle. We need to stop the craziness of beta and figure out how to think straight. That's supposedly a simple activity, but why is it so hard to sustain? And how do you even get there? Meditation is one path.\n\nThe monkey brain explores meditation\n\nThe profundity of meditation is its simplicity. Meditation Illuminated reflects that not only in its content, but also in its design. It's a beautiful book that feels good in the hand. It begins with an engaging Preface, continues with a helpful Introduction, and concludes with an encouraging Epilogue.\n\nNot a word is wasted, yet the writing throughout is graceful and generous. Even the Appendix and Endnotes, which support the science of meditation and the author's assertions, provide solid scholarship without the heavy burden of ivory tower intellectualism.\n\nThe book is divided into five parts. The first part describes STUFF, while the second presents the essence of meditation and how it works. The simple language, short sentences, and easy flow of the writing will calm even the most hurried reader.\n\nRains' writing style is deliberate without being boring, respectful without currying favor, and hypnotic without being controlling. Each chapter begins with a title supported by an explanatory subtitle and ends with a brief summary and a preview of the next chapter. These guideposts provide the reader a sense of place in the narrative, yet are neither repetitive nor didactic.\n\nPart 3 of the book, entitled \"How to Meditate,\" introduces the selection and use of an anchor, or object of awareness, as a resting place for one's attention. Rains is careful to point out that we need not abandon nor ignore thoughts and feelings while meditating. Rather, a meditator notices and acknowledges emerging thoughts and feelings, then redirects attention to the chosen anchor.\n\nThus, the continuous cycling of attention between stuff and anchor as described in Part 3 can help make meditation far less random and far more intentionally active than most people think it is.\n\nOne banana at a time\n\nOnce the reader has learned the basic tools and activities of meditation, Part 4 introduces the practical application of meditation to daily life. Part 5, the longest section of the book, introduces twenty-one approaches to intentional meditation. Beware of the variety in these choices if you have any inclination toward monkey brain thinking!\n\nAfter reading this book and gradually learning to say \"yes\" to meditation, you will want to try them all. Now. Your best bet is to back up to the paragraph titled \"Busy Mind\" in Chapter 13, \"Strategies for Addressing Common 'Obstacles' to Meditation,\" and reread the final sentence: \"The quality of your awareness is more important than the quantity of your stuff.\"\n\nBe aware that you have just turned all twenty-one suggestions for different types of meditation into stuff.\n\nSelect one, promise yourself the remaining twenty, and begin.\n\nBlood Drama\n\nChristopher Meeks\n\nWhite Whisker Books\n\nhttp://www.whitewhiskerbooks.com\n\n9780983632962, $16.95, 240pp, www.amazon.com\n\nLinda Hitchcock\n\nReviewer\n\nThe two Christopher Meeks books that I have read to date are Love at Absolute Zero, which remains a personal favorite (in my top five of 2011), and his recent Blood Drama. The novels are dissimilar yet share appealing qualities of quirkiness, light hearted humor and a stellar cast of singular characters with wildly imaginative names. LAAZ is a quest for romance using the charming physicist Gunnar's own scientific method while Blood Drama is a diverting offbeat crime novel exploring chance and randomness. In some strange fashion, it reminds me of Bobby McFerrin's irritating yet infectious ditty, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy,\" in a much more positive way and recalls Dante Hick's oft repeated phrase in Clerks \"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\"\n\nBlood Drama protagonist Ian Nash's life is in free fall with no sign of relief. Already shaken by a broken relationship, the book and his day begin with a brief meeting with his UC-Irvine dissertation committee chair, Professor Cromley. Several years and two hundred pages into his doctoral thesis on the enigmatic playwright David Mamet, Ian is brusquely informed he's \"taking the wrong approach on Mamet\" and \"doesn't fit the program.\" A heated disagreement with one of the female undergraduates may have been a contributing factor for his ousting. Tuition paid will not be refunded; teaching fellowship and stipend are immediately terminated. So sorry, not everyone is destined to earn a Ph.D. It has not yet occurred to Ian that he may also face deportation back to Winnipeg upon the termination date of his student visa.\n\nStunned and faced with the fact that the inexorable rent will soon be due, a befogged Ian drives to fill out a job application at a local coffee shop located in the lobby of a large Pasadena bank that may be hiring. Again, his timing is impeccable as a four member gang, led by a woman soon nicknamed by the media as \"the Busty Bandit,\" burst into the bank, kill two bystanders and take Ian hostage. The plot thickens as FBI Special Agent Aleece Medina is introduced to crime solve. Ian's theatrical training offer his best chance to avoid being killed by the robbers and ending the bloody spree.\n\nBlood Drama is wildly entertaining with fast-paced dialogue and plot twists caroming like a steel ball in a pinball machine. Minnesota native, Pasadena resident Christopher Meeks is a deft wordsmith; a screenwriter, playwright, reviewer and creative writing college instructor as well as an award winning fiction writer. He founded White Whisker Books in 2005 initially to publish a collection of his own short stories, The Middle-aged Man and the Sea. This small, independent publishing company uses seasoned professional editors, proofreaders, and book designers to produce top quality books from several accomplished authors. To paraphrase Bert Lahr in his guise as potato chip pitchman, \"betcha can't read just one\" of his books without joining his fan club.\n\nBlinded by Progress: Breaking Out of the Illusion That Holds Us\n\nLee Van Ham\n\nOneEarth Publishing\n\n3295 Meade Ave., San Diego, CA 92116\n\nwww.theoneearthproject.com\n\n9780991155408, $12.95 paperback; $3.95 ebook, Page Count: 208\n\nKevin L. Nenstiel\n\nReviewer\n\nInformed Americans know we're using Earth's resources faster than Nature can replenish itself. We burn carbon, squander water, generate waste, and denude land at rates unprecedented in natural history. We know we're doing it, but feel powerless to stop, and don't know why. Philosopher Lee Van Ham suggests we're beholden to an ethical edifice we can't even see.\n\nVan Ham proposes two competing philosophies: MultiEarth thinking, which consumes resources and people like we'll never run out, and OneEarth thinking, which endeavors to live in harmony with Earth, human nature, and ecology. We cannot live right, he asserts, until we live aware of our moral shackles. We must shatter the illusions concealing our morality from ourselves.\n\nReaders familiar with Bill McKibben, Wendell Berry, or Julia Butterfly Hill will recognize Van Ham's themes. But they won't recognize his reasoning, not superficially, anyway. Though much environmentalist and anti-plutocratic writing has an innate spiritual component, Van Ham applies intensive exegetical considerations to the topic, reflective of his prior ministerial career. He particularly finds, in the story of Cain and Abel, a parable of modern society.\n\nAbel, Earth's roaming steward, and Cain, Earth's settled owner, could never have lived peaceably. The relationship between those who follow Earth's ever-changing movements, and those who try to shackle Earth to their whims, will inevitably turn violent, as they forever cross purposes. Van Ham sees a late anti-urban allegory here, much like Jacques Ellul, and his exposition of two ultimately incompatible systems permeates his book.\n\nThis moral vision differentiates Van Ham from the numerous voices already propounding similar messages. While Wendell Berry, for instance, shares Van Ham's faith, Berry frequently avoids current events, focusing on transcendent, almost mystical themes. McKibben, though a professed Christian, prefers scientific arguments, using spirituality sparingly. Van Ham's moral catholicity claims the broad middle ground between these visions, the domain where most Americans live, but where environmentalists fear to tread.\n\nVan Ham spends the largest part of his book discussing what he terms the \"Five Big MultiEarth Practices Holding Us In Illusion.\" These practices correspond with important issues I've noticed, but haven't yet voiced as clearly, especially \"Giving Primary Religious Devotion to Economics\" and \"Disguising Corporatocracy as Democracy.\" Van Ham's breakdown alternates between the shock of familiarity and deep, suppressed detail.\n\nEconomics' religious structure, which most capitalists would probably deny, become obvious when considering the rituals attendant to, say, Monday NYSE openings. But Van Ham explores subterranean corners of modern economic practice, demonstrating how business insider liturgies and CNBC hymnody conceal a deeper moral landscape, one most Americans never see, but inevitably share. His discoveries, as current as the morning news, are frequently chilling.\n\nNow, many writers publish many books explicating how society rationalizes damaging humans and the Earth, while mortgaging our own future, for wasteful short-term gains. Van Ham distinguishes his book by mixing objective fact with personal writing. Not just a book of science or morality, Van Ham offers a memoir of his own struggles with eco-unfriendly living, and how he transitioned from short-term profligacy to mindful living.\n\nMuch as I appreciate Van Ham's premises, and mostly support his arguments, his exegesis remains frustratingly one-sided. In discussing MultiEarth philosophy, he characterizes it entirely in his own terms, not terms his opponents would comprehend. Consider this early characterization of his MultiEarth frenemies: \"Human species strives for lifestyles that use more resources than available on one planet.\"\n\nDoes anybody really strive for that? Or do people enamored of earthly wealth simply believe Earth's resources so vast that we cannot possibly deplete them? When approaching his opposite numbers, Van Ham might consider attempting what rhetorician Gerald Graff calls \"the believing game\" - attempting to state counterarguments in terms true believers would accept. Because right now, MultiEarth adherents could accuse him of Straw Man arguments, and dismiss him.\n\nTherefore, I recommend this book primarily for people who essentially already support Van Ham's central thesis. His reasoning will give us tools for debating technocratic zealots, and allows us to bolster our own beliefs with reason and facts. Once we've persuaded others to take our positions seriously, and only then, let's push copies of this book into Old Order followers' hands.\n\nVan Ham describes this as the first of a trilogy. In this volume, he primarily establishes the moral foundation of MultiEarth and OneEarth philosophies; he promises in future volumes to address actual plans to fix the socioeconomic Frankenstein we've created. If he maintains his personal, moral, and dryly humorous tone, I'll anticipate those coming volumes with giddy fanboy hope.\n\nAnn's Bookshelf\n\nA God in Every Stone\n\nKamila Shamsie\n\nBloomsbury\n\n9781408847213, A$29.99 (paperback), 312pages.\n\nAtavist Books\n\n68 Jay Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201\n\n9781937894306, $20.00, 336pp, www.amazon.com\n\nKamila Shamsie begins and ends her novel with Scylax, a Greek explorer who in 515 BCE was sent by the Persian King, Darius, to explore the Indus River. And in Shamsie's sensitive and eloquent telling, it is the lost Fig Circlet of Scylax, a delicate silver headband decorated with fig leaves and fruit, which links the various threads of her story together. History and myth run throughout this book, connecting different centuries, different cultures, religions and wars, and the people whose lives are touched by this silver circlet.\n\nA God in Every Stone tells many stories but it begins when Vivian Rose Spencer, a young Edwardian Englishwoman with a romantic passion for Greek history and archaeology, falls in love with Labraunda in Turkey, the place of Scylax's victory over the Carians; and falls in love, too with Tahsin Bey, a charismatic Turkish archaeologist who is her father's good friend. Too soon, the onset of war in Europe separates them. But the war also brings a young Pashtun man, Qayyum Gul, to England and it is his life which forms the second main theme of the book, touching Viv's occasionally but mostly remaining separate.\n\nIn wartime London, Viv and her sister Mary begin working in a convalescent hospital for wounded soldiers. Eventually, their father arranges for them to be moved to Class A hospitals where Viv finds herself nursing the badly wounded and dying. Qayyum, meanwhile, has been wounded at Ypres whilst serving with the British Indian Army. He finds himself bizarrely surrounded by images from djinn stories painted on the walls and ceilings of an Indian military ward in the Brighton Pavilion. For both, their wartime experiences are harrowing.\n\nQayyum, having lost an eye, is repatriated to his home in Peshawar. Viv, traumatised by the horrific injuries and continual deaths of the young men she has been nursing, eventually manages to arrange to travel far away from the war, to Peshawar. There she hopes to search for Scylax's Fig Circlet, which Tahsin Bey has hinted may be buried in the nearby ruins at Shahji-ki-Dheri. Qayyum returns to his family and tries to adjust to his life there and Viv becomes a resident of the British quarter and a rather reluctant part of the colonial social scene. She does, however, meet and befriend a young Pashtun boy, Najeeb, teaching him English and fostering his interest in the historical relics in the Peshawar Museum.\n\nViv, who is a thoroughly modern young woman, continues to teach Najeeb despite the disapproval of the British community but it is Najeeb's own family, when they learn that he is taking lessons alone with a young English woman, who are shocked by the situation and forbid him to continue with them. Deprived of her teaching, and as unrest grows and the possibility of excavation at Shahji-ki-Dheri become more remote, Viv returns to London.\n\nThe second half of the book concerns events which take place some fifteen years later. Najeeb has continued his studies, gained a history degree, and been appointed Indian Assistant at Peshawar Museum. Viv has pursued an archeological career and has become a Senior Lecturer at University College London. Qayyum still struggling with his old loyalties to the British Army, sees the inequalities around him and is exposed to anti-British feelings. Eventually, he is guided towards the Pashtun non-violent resistance movement and its leader Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, an associate of Ghandi, who has set up schools fostering Indian unity based on truth, love. Both Qayyum and Najeeb, who is his younger brother, live through the turmoil in India and, in particular, the bloody confrontation between Ghaffar Khan's non-violent activists and British troops in Peshawar's Street of Storytellers in 1930.\n\nShortly before this confrontation, Viv receives a totally unexpected letter from Najeeb who writes to tell her of his achievements since she left Peshawar and, in particular, of archaeological discoveries he has made and the possibility that he has found the location of the lost Fig Circlet of Scylax. Viv returns to Peshawar as it is still in turmoil immediately after the violence and the eventual outcome brings the story full circle.\n\nTrying to summarise such a rich and complex tale does nothing to suggest the delightful way that Shamsi, with love and humour, knowledge and insight, draws her readers into the lives and emotions of her characters. Suffice it to say that she could certainly set up stall successfully in any Street of Storytellers.\n\nBodies of Light\n\nSarah Moss\n\nGranta\n\n9781847089083, A$27.99, (paperback), 311pages.\n\n\"Lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth\"\n\nIt is the mid 1800s and Elizabeth Moberley hangs the full Biblical text of this passage above her daughter's bed. Elizabeth was brought up in a strictly Puritanical home where pleasures are dangerous, pain must be stoically borne, and the only way to spend your time is in good Christian works. This is the way she lives her life and she is determined that her two daughters will also learn these lessons. Alethea (Ally) her eldest daughter does; May, like her Aunt Mary, Elizabeth's sister, rebels.\n\nIt is Ally's life we follow in this book, learning first of the rejection and cruelty Elizabeth inflicts on her. Rejection, firstly, because Elizabeth is not prepared to deal, alone, with the pains, difficulties and demands of a small baby, and at times she feels guiltily suicidal. Rejection, secondly, because Elizabeth puts the needs of her Welfare Society women before her own and the family's comfort, believing that this is the right Christian thing to do. Cruelty, in the name of teaching Ally virtue. She burns Ally's arm with a candle to teach her fortitude, and blames Ally's nightmares on nervous weakness which needs to be punished by a strict regime of diet and deprivation. Her ambition for Ally, however, is for her to become a doctor so that she can help underprivileged women, and in many ways the pursuit of this frees Ally and gives her the courage and balance she badly needs.\n\nAlly's experiences as one of the first group of women to undertake medical training are full not only of her own struggles against the values Elizabeth has instilled in her but also full of her struggle for survival in a misogynist, male-dominated culture. Women, in this society, are expected to practice embroidery not to stitch wounds. Moss shows realistically the mixed attitudes of doctors and male students to women who are trying to enter their profession, and the grim experimental nature of much medical and surgical practice at that time. In 1880, however, Ally becomes one of the first women physicians to graduate and one of the first to practice surgery.\n\nBalanced against all this grimness is the world of Ally's father, Alfred, and his artist friends. Each section of the book begins with a description of a painting, written in the style of a reputable auction house. And each painting relates in some way to Ally and her sister, May, at different stages of their lives. As young girls, they pose in charming disarray for their father's friend, Aubrey West, whose pre-Raphaelite style favours soft flesh, rich fabrics and mythical heroines. Alfred himself designs rooms for wealthy clients, painting samples of wallpaper, choosing furnishings, and enjoying the Victorian richness which his wife rejects in his own home. For Ally, he is a remote figure, unable to help her resist her mother's control.\n\nSarah Moss does many things in this book. She shows the harshness of Elizabeth's beliefs but also the value of the work she does for poor women who have become the victims of Victorian hypocrisy about sex, illegitimacy and prostitution. She shows that radical behaviour sometimes does bring about change. And she immerses the reader in a world where luxury, beauty, comfort and joy are choices for some but are denied to others by poverty but also by self-imposed rules.\n\nBodies of Light is a thought-provoking and absorbing novel. Moss leaves Ally's story open for future development and, although May's story ends in this book, her life has been told more fully in Moss's earlier novel, Night Waking.\n\nBark\n\nLorrie Moore\n\nFaber\n\n9780571273904, 14.99, (hardback), 192pages.\n\nAlfred A.

Under the lightness of humour, however, there are often dark, distressing situations : divorce, loneliness, world disasters, old age. Her attitude seems to be that if you don't laugh about life you may not survive.\n\nIra, in the opening story is a newly divorced Jew who begins a disturbed sort of relationship with another divorcee. His wry wit pervades his perceptions of life but his meetings with Zora, always with her taciturn teenage son in tow, become decidedly odd.\n\nTeenage Nickie's mum, on the other hand, is a wonderfully zany but normal, slightly puzzled, single parent. Her interaction with Nickie, she remarks at one point, \"contained more sibling banter than it should have\". Her response to Nicki's normal teenage outbursts is to disrobe, slowly, so that Nicky flees in disgust. And faith, she muses, was invented so that parents could \"raise teenagers without dying\". Moore has a sharp eye for the weirdness of society and the country wedding which Nickie and her mum attend is a rich source of humour. The gun-firing bikers who roar up in the middle of proceedings are just glorious icing on the comic cake.\n\nOnly one story left me baffled. It has a sort of existential madness and revolves around a weird visit by three women to the house of a newly dead friend, a ghostly re-appearance and one woman's bizarre response to it all.\n\nThere are only eight stories in this book but that it enough to show Moore's originality, her ability to see the absurdities beneath every-day situations, and her sharp skill at making us laugh in a what is, too often, a frightening world\n\nThe Unexpected Professor\n\nJohn Carey\n\nFaber & Faber\n\n9780571310920, A$35.00, (hardback), 361pages.\n\nUnexpected? Yes, in a number of ways. Who would have thought that young John Carey, son of an accountant, put on Daily Report at his first grammar school for lack of interest in his lessons, would one day become an Oxford University Professor? Even he was surprised when, in 1975, he was appointed Merton Head of English Literature, and he felt guilty, he says, that he had never even finished reading the complete works of Sir Walter Scott.\n\nMost surprising, is that an Oxford don (i.e. a member of a learned, highly civilised but exclusive coterie) should be so genial, chatty and open as he unfolds his very personal love-affair with English Literature: \"how we met, how we got on, what came of it\", as he puts it.\n\nHowever, not everything in this book is about English Literature. In fact, in the early chapters it is incidental to Carey's memories of growing up in war-time and post-war England. His first memories of reading of any sort are of weekly comics that he and his sister fought over, and some old annuals which had belonged to his father when he was a boy. Following these, came the Biggles books. As a choir boy (he thought the outfit looked \"dashing\" and he was paid to sing) he was exposed to the King James Bible and to Hymns Ancient and Modern, but literature as such had to wait until he moved to a new grammar school and was exposed to the novels of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, and to the poetry of Chesterton, Arnold and Keats.\n\nOnce Carey starts to write about literature, his particular loves and hates become clear, but his memories of his life in general are often more interesting than his detailed reflections on particular books. His earliest memory is of an elephant in a parade for the Silver Jubilee of King George V when he was thirteen months old (although he admits that the elephant may have migrated from later memories), then he remembers his father carrying him to a window to see the glare in the sky from the burning of the Crystal Palace. From recollections of family life, school milk and a disaster with a trifle, he moves on to grammar school, then to conscription as a National Serviceman, where, in Egypt, as a Intelligence Officer he almost managed to blow up the entire Intelligence Section. After National Service, he took up his place at Oxford University, met his future wife and, over the years, moved up the University hierarchy until becoming Professor.\n\nCarey's reflections on his past are many and varied. He has a quick wit, a sometimes acerbic tongue and is often very funny. His main subject, he says, is books. And he does discuss in detail certain authors and particular poems and books. George Orwell crops up regularly and Carey seems to feel some affinity with him as a champion of the under-privileged classes. Carey's own experiences of the English class system stem from his time as an army officer after he was singled out as a 'Potential Leader' on account of his grammar-school A-level passes, and, later, when he was a scholarship-holder at university. In both situations he mixed with men whose family and schooling were those of the status conscious 'upper classes'. Carey tells of hearing Sir Roy Harrod's response to a guest who asked who Carey (who was sitting opposite him at dinner) was. \"Oh, that's nobody\" responded Harrod. D.H.Lawrence is admired for his outspoken scorn for ideas and his ability to \"show you the world with the grime scrubbed off\". Conrad and Larkin are applauded for believing in nothing but their art. And Charlotte Bronte's novels are dismissed as \"unexpectedly tiresome\" with \"feeble\" characters and \"tangled and disrupted\" narratives.\n\nCarey can be sharp-tongued but he is always honest in his views. He pays tribute to his grammar school education, regrets the demise of grammar schools and stiff competition, and suggests that modern students should understand the 'truth' that learning and fun \"seldom coincide\". Certainly, he worked hard for his many and varied achievements. His love of nature, his delight in his cat (wandering Wiggington), and his ongoing passion for bee-keeping reflect the breadth of his interests. Compared to the richness of detail in the early chapters, where there are some wonderful turns-of-phrase and lively expressions of opinion, the final chapters on reviewing and writing are disappointing and seem to be little more than an outline of Carey's many publications. The quotations with which he ends this book, however, beautifully answer his question \"Why read?\". And they explain, too, why books have been such an essential part of his life.\n\nThe Steady Running of the Hour\n\nJustin Go\n\nAllen & Uwiln\n\n9781743313794, A$29.99, (paperback), 466 pages\n\nSimon and Schuster\n\n1230 Avenue of the Americas, 14th fl., New York, NY 10020\n\n9781476704586, $26.00, 480pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSo, you have just finished university, you have small apartment in San Francisco, you don't even own a mobile phone, and you are suddenly contacted by some London solicitors you have never heard of before and told that you may be the beneficiary of a will. It sounds like a common internet scam. But Tristan Campbell is not so sure, and since he is to be flown business-class to London to learn more, the chance is too good to miss.\n\nIn some impressive offices in London, Tristan is told that in 1924 this particular solicitors' practice was employed to draft a most unusual will. The main beneficiary was a missing person but the will stipulated that the assets should be held in trust for eighty years in case she turned up, and if she did not the estate was to be distributed between various charitable foundations. Tristan, it seems, is possibly the direct descendent of an illegitimate daughter of Ashley Walsingham (a very wealthy Englishman who died in 1924 on one of the earliest Everest expeditions) and Imogen Soames-Andersson . Ashley left his estate to Imogen, who was the sister of Tristan's great-grandmother, Eleanor. Now, the eighty years for which the trust was to run is about to end but a family letter has been found which suggests that Charlotte, Tristan's grandmother was, in fact, Imogen's daughter, not Eleanor's as the family had always believed. No family records could be found to confirm this but Tristan has just under two months in which to obtain the evidence which would make him sole heir to a fortune.\n\nSo far, so complicated. The book however is not complicated. In alternating chapters, it relates Ashley's life and Tristan's ongoing quest for the truth about Imogen Soames-Andersson. Ashley's life was full and adventurous. His meeting and his love affair with Imogen take place in London and in a society in which interest in science and exploration flourishes, but the advent of the First World War changes everything. Ashley's experiences in the trenches in France are vividly and disturbingly described so, too, are his return to England and his subsequent involvement in climbing expeditions in the Himalayas. The difficulties, beauties, struggles and eventual failure of his oxygen-free ascent of Everest with the primitive equipment of the time is realistic and gripping. Incidents in Imogen's life and that of her close family and sister also carry the story forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Tristan travels widely, experiences many different cultures, and meets and is befriended by many different people until a last, almost unbelievable, meeting solves the mystery.\n\nIn this, his first novel, Justin Go has produced a page-turning, varied and well-plotted story. He is adept at drawing the reader into the feelings and behaviour of his characters in very different times and in different countries and cultures. I can't quite believe the speed with which Tristan manages to access exactly the material he needs at the British Library and in other major libraries around the world (I have never been able to find, call up, read and absorb material that quickly, but maybe he has a special charm). And I am not altogether convinced by the ending of the story either, although the rough family tree I scribbled in the back of the book shows that it is just about possible.\n\nNever mind, a good, well-written story is a good story: and certainly this one has enough action and interest and suspense to make it satisfying reading.\n\nThe Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly\n\nSun-Mi Hwang\n\nChi-Young Kim\n\nBloomsbury\n\n9781780745343, A$21.99, (paperback), 134 pages.\n\nPenguin Books\n\nc/o Penguin Group (USA)\n\n375 Hudson Street, 4th floor, New York, NY 10014\n\n9780143123200, $15.00, 144pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSun-Mi Hwang's books have been widely published in South Korea where they have won many awards, and this little book about a cage-hen called 'Sprout' is a simple tale, simply told, and simply and charmingly illustrated.\n\nAnyone who feels trapped in a routine job with no prospects and no recognition can empathise with Sprout's dreams of freedom. Yet when that freedom comes, life is not at all as she had expected. There are more and different dangers, and hard lessons to be learned. But Sprout is in control of her own life and, in spite of the hardships and sorrows which come her way, a strange friendship and an even stranger responsibility bring her joy.\n\nA story in which animals talk and display human emotions could be saccharin, but Sun-Mi Hwang balances sentimental moments with enough harsh reality and tension to make the story work. I am not sure that hens really can experience 'goose-bumps', but Sprout is not your average hen, so anything is possible, and even her experience of motherhood, apart from the usual joys and worries, is highly unusual.\n\nSprout is a courageous and determined heroine and the world she inhabits is the real world in which humans and animals must kill and eat in order to survive. The Hen Who Dreamed She Could Fly is a book which imaginative children will enjoy, although they may find some parts distressing. It is also a book with hidden depths to which many adults will respond.\n\nMr. Selden's Map of China: Decoding the Secrets of a Vanished Cartographer\n\nChart & The South China Sea\n\nTimothy Brook\n\nProfile Books\n\n9781781250389, A$39.99, (hardback), 211 pages\n\nBloomsbury Press\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315, New York, NY 10010\n\n9781620401439, $25.00, 240pp, www.amazon.com\n\nWhen, in 1654, John Selden bequeathed his large collection of books and manuscripts to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, his \"Mapp of China\" was the only item which he mentioned by name. It is not known how or when he acquired this old Chinese map, but in 1618 when he was writing 'Mare Clausum', his legal treatise on the ownership of the sea, this map was the most accurate chart of the South China Sea in existence. By 1640, however, its value had leached away. And by the 18th century it was regarded as an Asian curiosity and displayed on a staircase wall in Oxford University's Anatomy School alongside the tattooed skin of a Pacific Islander named Giolo. Then, it was rolled up, packed into a box, and sent to the basement stacks, where it lay forgotten for almost a century.\n\nIn 2008, an American historian of the British Empire noticed the map's entry in the library catalogue and called it up. Alerted by a librarian to something of interest in his own field of studies, Timothy Brook found himself looking at a large, very old, beautifully decorated, Chinese paper map. It was totally unlike any other Chinese map he had ever seen. It was \"perfect\": but \"it was all wrong\".\n\nBrook was fascinated by this strange map and the questions it raised, so he set about exploring not only its origins and purpose but also the secrets it contained. Along the way, he delved into the European and Chinese history surrounding it, and the lives of the many people associated with it. This ambitious project took Brook into unexpected places and involved history, law, politics, science, biography, cartography and (bringing the possible importance of the map up-to-date) a discussion of present-day Chinese claims over disputed territories in the South China Sea. In the handling of all these different aspects, he needed to be almost as much of a polymath as John Selden clearly was.\n\nSome will find all of Brook's findings fascinating and his style is easy-going and often personal. He has, as he says at the end of the book, written himself into the story of the map. For me, however, there were too many extensive excursions into historical events surrounding people remotely linked to the map and too many details of the lives of their relatives, and my interest often flagged.\n\nBrook admits that his journey of exploration was more \"convoluted and complicated\" than he expected when he set out: \"a circling maze rather than a straight path\". \"Perhaps\", he writes, mixing his metaphors, it was like those many historical expeditions which got lost at sea and his own ship \"hasn't quite made it to home port\".\n\nPerhaps, he is being a too hard on himself. Other reviewers have thoroughly enjoyed the book and have not had the difficulties I had. Certainly, the map still keeps some of its secrets, but it is an interesting and curious object. The end papers of the book show part of the map, and it is delicately coloured and beautifully decorated with Chinese mountains, trees and flowers. I wish the full reproduction of it in the book were larger so that Brook's favourite illustration - two tiny butterflies in the Gobi Desert - could be easily seen. John Selden, too, is a man whose life was full of drama and who lived in what the Chinese curse would define as \"interesting times\". His extensive knowledge and his many important achievements were, and still are, worthy of recognition.\n\nCat Out Of Hell\n\nLynne Truss\n\nArrow Books with Hammer / Random House\n\n9780099585336, A$27.99, (hardback), 233 pages.\n\nSource\n\nLauren Owen\n\nJonathan Cape\n\n9780224096393, A$32.99, (paperback), 517 pages.\n\nTwo gothic horror stories. One by established author Lynne Truss; the other a first novel by Lauren Owen. Both suitably macabre, horrifying and bloody.\n\nLynne Truss's Cat Out of Hell joins the series of Hammer Horror novellas already commissioned from literary writers like Helen Dunmore and Jeanette Winterson. Truss describes it as the comic, full and frightful tale of a missing woman and a talking cat, and she clearly had fun writing it. So much so, that she, like her narrator, is \"quite captivated by Roger\", her murderous, conniving, highly literate cat, who can do cryptic crosswords with ease, quotes Tennyson and Milton, and has \"a profound aesthetic response to cultural sites\". Roger, however, is a scary beast: and he tells us more than we might like to know about the latent devilish powers of our feline 'friends'. Purring may no longer hypnotise us, and paddling our laps does not now shred our femoral arteries, but the dead mice and birds they bring us are not gifts but proof that they believe they will get their evil powers back \"if only they do enough killing\".\n\nSo much for Roger. But we also meet his owner Wiggy (Dr Winterton); Alec, our narrator, whose sister and her dog have suddenly and mysteriously disappeared; The Captain, who is Roger's devilish cat-mentor; and The Cat Master (the first of whom was, apparently, Sir Isaac Newton) who owns that rare leaflet - Nine Lives: The Gift of Satan - which holds the secret of ultimate power.\n\nThere are devilish deeds, and gruesome deaths; and it comes as no surprise to learn that Lynne Truss has recently changed her allegiance from cats to dogs. It is a pity that Roger mesmerises her into offering a happy ending: an ambiguous one would have been so much more worrying.\n\nLauren Owen's novel, The Quick, takes considerably longer to read and is not comic at all. True to its genre, it is horribly gory. It begins quite calmly in 1890 with two young orphaned children, James and Charlotte, growing up in the crumbling ruins of Aiskew Hall in Yorkshire (of course!). We follow their lives until James, who has ambitions to be a writer, goes off to Oxford University and then moves on to London. There, he falls in with a group of young men who frequent exclusive London clubs and he meets and begins to share rooms with Christopher. Up to this point in the book, only the illicit love which develops between the two men provides the tension, but the dramatic ending of Part One signals the start of the real horror story.\n\nSuddenly we are thrown into a terrifying world where warring groups of vampires, kidnap, dismember, and otherwise bloodily destroy each other, as well as preying on The Quick, who are their source of nourishment. A Dickensian cast of scruffy children and oddly dressed men and women represent one faction of the un-dead: the members of the Aegolius Club, a sinister, mysterious, philanthropic society intent on a diabolical form of social reform, comprise the other. At the heart of the Aegoilius Club is Augustus Mould (Doctor Knife), whose notes we read and whose experiments are particularly gruesome. Charlotte and James become inextricably involved with all of this.\n\nFor a first novel, The Quick is admirable, but the first 100 pages of the book serve little purpose other than to introduce Charlotte, James and Christopher, and there is little relationship between this part of the book and the rest. The lives of a number of other characters, too, are told in unnecessary detail, especially since they all end up being summarily dispatched in a variety of gory ways. After a while the constant immersion in blood-sucking and gore becomes repetitive. A shorter book would, I think, have more impact and, as with the Cat out of Hell, the almost happy ending to this horror story comes as an anticlimax.\n\nAnn Skea, Reviewer\n\nhttp://ann.skea.com\n\nBuhle's Bookshelf\n\nKnow Yourself, Know Others\n\nJoanne Antoun\n\nBalboa Press\n\nc/o Hay House, Inc.\n\nPO Box 5100, Carlsbad, CA 92018-5100\n\nBohlsen Group (publicity)\n\n9781452511795 $16.99 www.balboapress.com\n\nKnow Yourself, Know Others: The Thirty-Second Personality Type and Life Guide System discusses nine common personality types (Instigator, Supporter, Doer, Dreamer, Agent, Patriot, Aficionado, Competitor, and Mediator), and how to determine which applies most strongly to oneself and the other people in one's life.

The Corps stationed me in the desert southwest, near the Mexican border. Several of us bought motorcycles. We rode all over the area. We often rode into Mexico -- people crossed the border more or less freely in those days. In Mexico, we smoked a lot of 'mota' and got knee-walkin' drunk in the 'tabernas'. Rubbing shoulders with the locals as we did, we sometimes rubbed locals the wrong way. All of that leads up to the fact that no Mexican ever called me 'gringo' without a hateful sneer on his face and blood in his eye. For a Mexican to call a white American 'gringo' is for a white American to call a Mexican 'spic' or 'greaser'. It ain't nice, people, and nobody talks like that who doesn't like to fight.\n\nFew people would know that better than Mexican-American author Saul Sanchez. I say so because Sanchez wrote a memoir titled 'Rows of Memory: Journeys of a Migrant Sugar-Beet Worker'. I find it curious that in his memoir, Sanchez everywhere makes free use of the word 'gringo' when he refers to 'white' American men or 'gringa' when he refers to 'white' American women. In my experience, Mexican-Americans usually say 'Anglos' in polite reference to non-Hispanic, 'white' people. From all of that I assume author Sanchez is either a racist taco bender of just some guy who passionately resents his hardscrabble childhood and truly likes to fight. What ever.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that the migrant worker's life is tough. For one whole year I shared a with a Mexican-American man. He got his living by working the fruit and vegetable crops of southern Arizona. Once, on a dare, I spent a day picking lemons in a grove near Yuma. That kind of work needs a better man than I was then -- 24 years old, 6 feet tall, 190 pounds and newly discharged from the Marines. After standing on a ladder all day in that grove, I though my arches were broken. I never went back. Other experience taught me that living as a drifter, by itself, is mighty tough. Anybody who finds him/herself living that life, (s)he will learn as Mr. Sanchez and I learned that there's almost no way out of it. Outside agriculture, if American employers ever write down all the excuses they have for not hiring drifters they'll have written a book so big that only a Mexican migrant could lift and carry it.\n\nThat said, I believe the young Mr. Sanchez, working the short hoe for years in those beet fields, had his nose so close to the ground for so long that his vision may be incurably narrowed. Both Sanchez and Omar Valerio-Jimenez (who lends an essay to 'Rows of Memory' cry the blues of migrant labor but only migrant labor as experienced by Hispanics. Both of them educated Americans, they ought to know there's nothing new in migrant labor and little or nothing in migrant labor that's unique to the Mexican experience.\n\nPenniless, ragged, starving 'gringos' that America called 'Okies' fled the Dust Bowl back in the 1930s. When they arrived in California farm country, Okie 'gringos' were treated as bad or worse than Mexicans. John Steinbeck, for one, was traumatized by what he found on the acres near Bakersfield. But Okie 'gringos' didn't have it any tougher in Bakersfield and Salinas than other groups had it in other places at other times. One recalls the railroads and the Chinese gangs that built so many of them. There were also the Irish, the Italians, and the East Europeans in their turn. There were the garment and textile workers; there was (and still is) child labor. There was the 'peculiar institution' that sparked the American Civil War. Who were the abolitionists? The underground railroaders? Who was John L. Lewis? Mother Jones? Lucy Parsons? Big Bill Haywood? Eugene V. Debs? Jimmy Hoffa?\n\nToward the end of 'Rows of Memory,' Mr. Sanchez does make brief mention of Cesar Chavez. But then Chavez was a Mexican-American, wasn't he? For the rest of it, Sanchez doesn't seem to know or care about any of the people I named, or what they did -- or what they tried to do -- and in some case died for.\n\nMy point? The condition of migrant labor in America has little or nothing to do with race or nationality. American capitalism feeds on impoverishment and powerlessness. American business doesn't give a damn where workers come from or what color workers are as long as they are desperate enough to do what the employers want for what the employers are willing to pay. Workers who refuse and attempt to organize are name 'troublemakers,' 'radicals,' 'terrorists' or 'bloody red socialists'. Typically the get beaten nigh unto death by company goons, or run out of town, or imprisoned by courts, or shot dead by police.\n\nIn short, American capitalism is engineered by Congress to empower a caste of vicious, ruthless thieves who create and exploit cheap labor. Mexican-Americans are some but by no means all of capitalism's victims. As more and more Mexican-Americans do with themselves as Saul Sanchez did -- learn to speak English and get an education -- migrant labor will become the lot of other unfortunates if meaningful, badly needed reform doesn't end the system before that time. As I write this column, I see the idea of a resurrected American Labor Movement everywhere afoot, but I see no promise whatever, anywhere.\n\nNotwithstanding problems of race and misdirected anger, 'Rows of Memory' is a powerful testament. The bulk of the book delivers details of Mexican culture and family life that 'gringo' readers may well envy. My own family circle wasn't nearly so close. Descriptions of migrant working and living conditions are factual and vivid. Mr. Sanchez's tales of his tough-loving parents and extended family tug at the heart. Accounts of vicious, skin-flint employers and lousy working conditions echo my own, 25-year, blue-collar experience. When, every once in a while, the Sanchez family gets good work from a relatively decent employer, the reader heaves a sigh of relief.\n\nSanchez might be surprised how much his account of K-12 schooling in Crystal City, Texas, resembles my own experience at school in rural Iowa.
