        "text": "Nickandmore! presents a list of every TV series that aired on the short-lived Fox Family Channel from 1998 through 2001.\n\nFox Family Channel launched on Saturday, August 15, 1998 at 12:00pm Eastern Time as a rebranding of The Family Channel, which had been purchased by Fox Kids Worldwide Inc., a joint venture between News Corporation and Saban Entertainment. The channel attempted to compete with the other major kids networks, but was largely unsuccessful. About halfway through its short run, the channel attempted to shift to a more teen/young adult focus in primetime, but that too failed. On Saturday, November 10, 2001, the channel quickly rebranded to ABC Family after having been sold to The Walt Disney Company just a month prior.\n\nThis list is just for the channel’s time as Fox Family, not The Family Channel, ABC Family, or Freeform. The list also omits paid and religious programs. Dates correspond to the “TV day”, which starts and ends at 6:00am Eastern Time. In general, First Aired is representative of when a TV show first began to air on the channel. However, there are times where this may vary, such as a pilot airing before an official premiere. See the Notes section for additional airing information.\n\nPublished: November 26, 2019\n\nUpdated: January 27, 2024 (128 titles listed)"
