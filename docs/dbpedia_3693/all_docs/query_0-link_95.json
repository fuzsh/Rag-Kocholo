The people interviewed in this film share a strong work ethic and fierce independent streak rooted in Zapotec culture. These qualities have resulted not only in powerful women but also in the region's progressive politics, manifested in their unusual tolerance of homosexuality. Veteran film editor Maureen Gosling and co-director Ellen Osborne illuminate the infectious self-confidence of the Juchitecan people (75 min., 2000).\n\nBullshit - #188\n\nHer opponents gave her the “Bullshit Award” for sustaining global poverty.

An insightful, eye-opening, and exhilarating film, Bullshit elucidates some of the most pressing social and technological questions of the 21 st century can genetically modified foods alleviate world hunger? is it legal for corporations to patent natural crops? -can indigenous knowledge inform modern genetic engineering? -as it offers a compelling portrait of a tireless and fearless activist.

The film is not just the story of modern India, but of what is happening politically in the world today: from the consequences of development and globalization to the ever more urgent need for state accountability and the freedom of speech. By Aradhana Seth (50 min., 2002)\n\nThe Easiest Targets: The Israeli Policy of Strip Searching Women and Children - #184\n\nThe organization “If Americans Knew” conducted an investigation and was astonished to learn that Israeli officials have been regularly strip-searching women and girls as young as seven and below. Many of these children have been American citizens. Moreover, the mode in which this has been done is often particularly humiliating and, at times, grotesque.

What does world hunger have to do with us? This is a film about food and globalization, the flow of goods and cash flow -a film about scarcity amid plenty. Interviewed are not only fishermen, farmers, agronomists, biologists and the UN's Jean Ziegler, but also the director of production at Pioneer, the world's largest seed company, and Peter Brabeck, Chairman and CEO of Nestlé International, the largest food company in the world.

Narrated by Morgan Freeman, Where the Water Meets the Sky is the story of a remarkable group of women in a remote region of northern Zambia, who are given a unique opportunity: to learn how to make a film, as a way to speak out about their lives and to challenge the local traditions which have, until now, kept them silent. Many in the group can't read or write, most are desperately poor, and few have been exposed to film or television. But with the help of two teachers, this class of 23 women learn to shoot a film that portrays a subject of their own choosing. It involves an issue that is traumatic for them all, and rarely spoken about: the plight of young women orphaned by AIDS. Their film recounts the real-life experiences of Penelop, an 18-year-old orphan, and her struggle to provide for herself and her siblings in the wake of her parents' deaths. What begins as a workshop about filmmaking, and a quest to tell Penelop's story, becomes a journey in empowerment as the women rise to the challenge of pressing their community to change. Uplifting and poignant, Where the Water Meets the Sky is the story of an unforgettable group of women who defy long traditions of silence and who demonstrate with courage, humor and resilience that their futures are once again something of promise. Camfed, 2008 (DVD 60 minutes)\n\nWho's Counting: Marilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and Global Economics- #181\n\nMarilyn Waring was first elected to the New Zealand parliament in 1975 at the age of 22. She was re-elected three times and blazed a trail that eventually overturned her government on the nuclear issue and launched her as the foremost spokesperson for global feminist economics. Waring challenges the myths of economics, its elitist economic policy. Why isn't the unpaid work of women counted in the gross domestic product?

(2002; 52 min.)\n\nThe Women's Kingdom - #202\n\nKeepers of one of the last matriarchal societies in the world, Mosuo women in a remote area of southwest China live beyond the strictures of mainstream Chinese culture - enjoying great freedoms and carrying heavy responsibilities. Beautifully shot and featuring intimate interviews, this short documentary offers a rare glimpse into a society virtually unheard of 10 years ago and now often misrepresented in the media. Mosuo women control their own finances and do not marry or live with partners; they practice what they call \"walking marriage.\" A man may be invited into a woman's hut to spend a \"sweet night,\" but must leave by daybreak. While tourism has brought wealth and 21st century conveniences to this remote area, it has also introduced difficult challenges to the Mosuo culture - from pollution in the lake, to the establishment of brothels, to mainstream ideas about women, beauty and family. This finely wrought film is a sensitive portrayal of extraordinary women struggling to hold on to their extraordinary society. (2006, 22 min.)\n\nYear of the Woman-A Fantasy - #210\n\nBy: Sandra Hochman\n\nThe film they couldn't stop about the revolution they couldn't stop. “Year of the Woman” is a film of the cinema verite style, a more provocative approach to documentary. Filmmaker Sandra Hochman is featured in nearly every scene, unafraid of those who she interviews (a cast which includes Warren Beatty and Gloria Steinem) and undaunted by the men and the media at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. It is a film about the first National Women's Political Caucus, which took place at the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach , Fla. Hochman was running as a delegate for Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president. In “Year of the Woman,” Hochman said she added her “own humor to what she considers a serious cause,” believing in humor's power of poignancy. In an interview with then-Washington Post columnist Art Buchwald that is interspersed throughout the film, Hochman displays such humor, at one point posing the question of whether or not Julia Child was ready to be president. In demonstrations featuring alligator masks and chants, Hochman responds to the assertion that women were freaks. When “Year of the Woman” was first released in 1973, it enjoyed tremendous success for less than a week before being purchased by an outside group and hidden from the public for more than 30 years. Hochman asserts that this occurred because the film “was too outrageous.” The uniqueness of the film is evident - interwoven with Hochman's poetry and scenes of stars and galaxies, which largely provide the distinctive, perceptive narration that is the film's point of view. As for the significance of “Year of the Woman” in today's political atmosphere, Hochman claims, “It's very relevant, because the women's movement is still part of the struggle of the women of today, fighting for equality that we still don't have in the way that we would like to...it's relevant in the same way that the founding fathers of the nation were relevant when they wrote the Constitution of the United States and are still relevant today.”\n\nSocial and Historical Issues top\n\nAdelante Mujeres! - #17\n\nProduced by the National Women's History Project.

Eloit argues that brain-related sex differences are real and clinically important, but often grossly distorted in public discourse. In this talk, Lise Eliot debunks several popular myths about sex differences in the human brain and their hormonal basis. For example, for most mental traits, male-female differences are smaller than the popular “Mars/Venus” perception and few have been linked to reliable differences in brain structure or activity. Another common misperception is that neural sex differences in brain anatomy, activation, or neurochemistry are necessarily innate or “hardwired.” These notions are dangerous, as they validate stereotypes, bias clinical judgment, and dictate sex-selective educational policies. Eliot is the author of Pink Brain, Blue Brain: How Small Differences Grow into Troublesome Gaps—And What We Can Do About It.\n\nBusting Out- #174\n\nBusting Out is a disarmingly honest and intimate exploration of our society’s fascination with women’s breasts.

Facing a more powerful and often bigoted opposition, Chisholm nonetheless won over a surprisingly large and vocal amount of support with her determination and refusal to kow-tow to the status quo. Eventually defeated by Senator George McGovern-viewed by many Democrats as the more \"electable\" candidate-she managed a few coups along the way, and remains an inspiration in markedly conservative times. This documentary is a stirring assemblage of archival footage, Chisholm's commentary both then and now, and interviews with supporters and opponents, as well as luminaries such as Black Panther founder Bobby Seale, authors Susan Brownmiller and Octavia Butler, author and activist Amiri Baraka (then LeRoi Jones), former Congressmen Reverend Walter Fauntroy and Ronald Dellums, and journalist/historian Paula Giddings.

But who sets these impossible beauty standards—and how can they be changed? In this eye-opening documentary, filmmaker and former Elite International fashion model Nicole Clark, now a champion for young girls and their self-esteem, calls for a necessary change: integrity and responsible media for our youth.\n\nCOVER GIRL CULTURE pairs images of girls and women in television and print ads with footage from the catwalks and celebrity media. Clark is given rare access to women editors from major magazines like “Teen Vogue” and “ELLE”, who provide a shocking defense of the fashion and advertising worlds. The film juxtaposes these interviews with revealing insights from models, parents, teachers, psychologists, body image experts and most importantly, the heartfelt expressions of girls themselves on how they feel about the media that surrounds them.\n\nWith an insider’s view, the film addresses issues like today’s increasingly invasive media, heightened advertising to tweens, the sexualization of girls, and consumer culture’s disempowerment of young women. An up-to-date inquiry into advertising and the cult of celebrity’s deep and negative impact on teens and young women, COVER GIRL CULTURE also suggests how to educate young women to think critically about the media.

The film opens with a pedophile describing sex with a 10-year-old little girl as “just the way it is here.” Jantraka passionately disagrees and has devoted his life to combating trafficking at its source by convincing families that education is a better alternative to selling their children. Compelling and insightful, “Daughters and Sons” conveys the urgent need to protect children before they are trafficked. In Jantraka's words, “save them today because tomorrow is too late.” From Friends of Thai Daughters, Inc. , directed by Sarah Feinbloom, winner of the Best Short in Children's Advocacy.

Shocking and often disturbing, Dreamworlds II allows its viewers to reflect critically on images which have such power precisely because they have become so common. By making their gendered messages clear, Dreamworlds II robs those images of their unchallenged power. Drawing on over 200 music videos and televised programs, the video gives a new context to these images by substituting narrative for the music these videos are meant to sell, and by rearranging them to illustrate the story they tell about female sexuality. **CONTAINS A GRAPHIC SCENE OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE** (1995, 55 min)\n\nDreamworlds III: Desire, Sex, and Power in Music Videos - #179\n\nProduced by Sut Jhally. This highly anticipated update of Dreamworlds II examines the stories contemporary music videos tell about girls and women, and by extension boys and men, providing a meticulous analysis of how these narratives both reflect and shape individual and cultural attitudes toward femininity, masculinity, sexuality and race. Systematically dismantling music video's most persistent and disturbing stock representations, and setting them against cases of real-world violence, sexism, and discrimination, the film inspires viewers to critically examine how the distorted images of the Dreamworld connect with the lives of real girls and women, as well as boys and men.

Hinds Professor of History of Science, Director, Gendered Innovations in Science, Medicine, and Engineering Project, Stanford University. Schiebinger sets out three distinct levels for analyzing issues concerning women and gender in science, efforts to increase the number of women in science, programs to remove bias and barriers from the institutions of science, and analyses of sex and gender in knowledge or research results. She gives special attention to the third level—the knowledge level, what she calls Gendered Innovations, or the use of methods of sex and gender analysis as a resource to create new knowledge. Schiebinger presents several concrete examples of how gender analysis can profoundly enhance excellence in science and engineering. Schiebinger also introduces the Stanford Gendered Innovations Project where they are developing state-of-the-art “Methods of Sex and Gender Analysis” for basic and applied research in science, medicine, and engineering. Gendered innovations—fueled by sophisticated gender methods—stimulate the creation of new gender-responsible science and technology, and by doing so enhance the lives of both men and women around the world.

Framed by the story of a community initiated lawsuit resulting in hundreds of women getting trained and working on a billion-dollar freeway, the film evolves into a primer on the feminist issues of equality, identity, and changing gender roles. Powerful testimonials by the women workers tell stories of the often unspoken gendered specifics of discrimination in the building trades; sexual harassment at the jobsite; negotiations about childcare and worker benefits; and the translation of affirmative action policy to the traditional practices of contractors and the historical conventions of the male worksite. (2000, 54 min.)\n\nHe Said, She Said - #101\n\nDeborah Tannen, author of You Just Don't Understand , takes the viewer on an intellectual journey to the core of how men and women use language, and why communication between the sexes so often goes awry .

Taking his camera from the street to the recording studio to the corridors of industry power, Hurt elicits fascinating insights into hip-hop masculinity from ordinary kids, aspiring rappers, music moguls, rap stars, and prominent cultural critics.

Armed with a video camera and an irreverent sense of humor, Shechter talks with feminist superstars, rowdy frat boys, liberated Cosmo girls and Radical Cheerleaders, all in her quest to find out whether feminism can still be a source of personal and political power.\n\nIn this enlightening documentary, screened worldwide, Shechter hunts down the answers to questions many women are grappling with about their roles and identities in today’s society: is feminism dead, hibernating, or trapped below the radar? Have the goals of the ‘70s been accomplished or have feminism’s opponents appropriated and denigrated the movement beyond all recognition?If so, how did this happen? Do you have to be political to be a feminist? And do you even have to be female? With home movies clips of Shechter as a budding feminist, archival materials from old health classes, and music by Ani DiFranco, Lavababy, Gina Young, Moxie Strapark and the legendary Helen Reddy, I WAS A TEENAGE FEMINIST redefines the F-Word for a new generation.

The film \"Judy Chicago & the California Girls\" documents this first all-woman art program, in a compelling and candid portrait of a country and culture in the midst of great social change. Highlights include a visit by radical feminist theorist Ti-Grace Atkinson, Chicago's early performance pieces the \"Cock Cunt Play\" and the \"Cunt Cheer\", and Chicago's female-centered philosophy that shaped her later work.

They are clean, educated, well-groomed and articulate. They live invisibly throughout society-the hidden homeless. It Was a Wonderful Life follows the stories of six different hidden homeless women as they struggle to survive, one day at a time, and find a place for themselves in a society ill-equipped to deal with the “used to haves.” Many of the women were left in financial straits following a divorce, loss of a job or a long illness, and were reduced to living out of their cars. Their clothes, dogs, and whatever remains of their former lives are packed in the back seat. Few receive welfare or any other form of assistance. They eke out an existence picking up bits of work here and there. The women avoid public shelters where they might be raped or robbed, preferring to sleep in their cars, or find temporary shelter with friends. With strength, humor and pride, these women manage to survive. They challenge our notion of who can feel secure in our society.

They discovered a new sense of pride and dignity in their work. Their earnings leapt upwards. Many joined unions and found substantial new benefits from labor representation.
