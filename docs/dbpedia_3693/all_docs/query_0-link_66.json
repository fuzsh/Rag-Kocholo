        "text": "Working in comic book stores has been both a blessing and a curse for me in this millenium, as I have amassed an increidbly large library of graphic novels and knowledge about the industry. In the 90s, I worked in record stores and had the same issue but with CDs and opinions. As a completist, both jobs fed into my craving for complete understanding of a band/series/author/artist.\n\nI was in high school when Counterparts came out. I loved the first track, and thought the album was pretty good. And the next time I went down to the trendy CD store in Greenfield, MA, I picked up Roll The Bones, and then I just kept getting one album every time I went into town until I owned All Of Them. But it didn't stop there. In college, I briefly worked with a progressive rock band who asked me to join them because of two things 1.) I had a massive CD collection that included all of Rush and Dream Theater's output. and 2.) When they asked me to name progressive rock bands, I mentioned early Genesis, causing the drummer to shout \"SOMEBODY ELSE GETS IT.\" which, um, sort of? We didn't make it to our first show.\n\nI bought their three 21st century albums when their comic series, Clockwork Angels came out. I neither listened to the albums nor read the comics. I hadn't had an urge to listen to Rush since college. I didn't even plan on doing a discography for them because, hoo-boy, what do you say about a band that had 40 years of songs, a legendary reputation, but who very few people outside of college ever have the desire to listen to? Then I saw the video of the marching band who performed a Rush Medley at some football game and I thought \"How visually cool, and musically boring. How is it that all marching band music just sounds like the same eternal song, no matter the source material?\" Rush deserves better.\n\nSo here is a One Album Discography of Rush, despite their tremendous output because, oooof, so many of their songs are long and pretentious. And who wants to listen to Ayn Rand put to music? I mean even the Tolkien put to music is excruciating, and I like Tolkien.\n\nPlease listen to the album reponsibly.\n\n1. It's Rush, so I feel like to properly prepare you for the experience, I can't just throw down one of their hits. Instead, you get the heavily instrumental (there is narration and the occasional verse) and incredibly long Tolkienesque The Necromancer. It's over 12 minutes of progressive rock from the 1970s that flirts with the ideas of Heavy Metal but never really commits. The different sections of the song are broken up by pitched down narration. The second section, which kicks in with drums before getting as Heavy as early Rush really gets (think really slow early Metallica with Led Zeppelinesque vocals), is probably the most satisfying part of the song. But it's all good if you're in the mood for this kind of music. Just frenetic in its pace changes.\n\n2. The first excellent riff of this album belongs to The Spirit Of The Radio. This song just throws everything at you right from the get-go. It's like three different great openings in a row. The lyrics are rarely the highlights of early Rush songs, and this is no exception. But it sounds like the kind of track you occasionally hear on a Classic Rock radio or streaming station and think \"Do I know this song? I swear I've heard these riffs before.\"\n\n3. One of the four Rush songs whose lyrics I've ever really remembered is Their Biggest Hit, Tom Sawyer. If you've only ever heard one Rush song, it was almost definitely this one. Again, a great riff, and again complex and noticably awesome drumming. It's got that whole sci-fi synthsound that places in the early 80s but the lyrics are pretty timeless. This is one of three songs that gets stuck in my head whenver I think of Rush.\n\n4. I don't think Losing It shows up on many people's Favorite Rush Songs list, but it's a great example of their ballady synth work. It has a sweet narrative that's neither Tolkienesque nor Randish, and Geddy Lee's vocals are softer here than on any of the previous tracks on this album. If the guitars were a bit softer, it could fit into that Air Supply Early 80s Soft Alternative Rock.\n\n5. Ok, here is the monster. Clocking in at over twenty minutes long, 2112 was the song and album that really drew the music nerds to Rush. It's so 1970s spacey. It's so epically long. It's so many parts. The whole album is the best example of Rush telling a single story on an album. And while it's never been my favorite Rush album, I get why it is Many Fans' favorite Rush album. This is definitely a Strap In Song. If you wash your hands the length of this song instead of \"Happy Birthday\", they'll be pruney and will smell like soap for Hours. I think it's four minutes before the vocals even kick in. You'll need a candy cigarette after this one.\n\n6. To balance it out, we have the short and somewhat sweet The Trees, which is a very folklorey song about different types of trees that accelerates as it goes on. I say it's short, but that's really just compared to the other songs on this album. It's still over four minutes.\n\n7. The Most 80s Radio Friendly Song, in my opinion, is Subdivisions. This could almost be Journey or Foreigner with Geddy Lee on vocals. The synths are much catchier here than on most tracks. It's also the apex of their Conformity Is Bad, Fight The Power songs. It doesn't sound rebellious musically, but the lyrics are very Of That Genre And Era.\n\n8. The second Hey I Know All The Words To This Song is the first Rush song I ever heard, Closer To The Heart. It was on a friend's mix called \"Windowsills\", which contained songs they liked to listen to while sitting on their ... windowsills ... contemplating the universe. It's a light, bass-centric ballad with bells. You can see it as a bit of a template for the more eccentric but mainstream grunge bands like Screaming Trees and Alice In Chains. It 100% sounds like a Mother Love Bone song.\n\n9. Where's My Thing is the fourth part of a trilogy of songs. How Douglas Adamesque, right? It's completely instrumental, and funky as Hell. I wish there were more Rush songs like this, but with lyrics. It's a blend of 80s arena metal and funk that I just don't remember hearing from anyone else.\n\n10. As I was collecting the Rush albums, Test For Echo came out, and I loved the title track. I falsely remembered how it went for years, though, and listening to it this time through I still love it, but it sounded completely different from the version that occasionally rattled around my head for the last twenty years.\n\n11. Tears is another ballad, this one almost acoustic, that I don't see on any of their retrospective hit albums. It just sounds like a familiar singer/songwriter with a guitar from the early late twentieth century. It's a great break from the relentlessness of most of Rush's work while still definitely being Geddy Lee. Also, flutes and violins? Ok.\n\n12. Another early Rush hit was Fly By Night. I didn't remember this one at all when I was doing my listen-throughs. Each time it came up I thought \"I like this Very 70s radio friendly classic rock song. Why don't I remember listening to it before?\" It's chorus is just slightly different from the way they usually approached songwriting in the 1970s that it catches me pleasantly by surprise.\n\n13. Red Sector A is very early 80s U2ish with its jangly and echoey guitars, so of course I gravitate towards it. It has an almost \"Eye Of The Tiger\" bassline in the background, and it definitely gets Rushier as it goes on, but that beginning is straight up all the early 1980s bands that I started to like in the early 90s.\n\n14. I have never understood how Neurotica wasn't one of Rush's greatest hits. They didn't even release it as a single, but it's one of those Four Songs I mentioned earlier that I remember most of the lyrics to. I suppose that's one of the benefits of rarely hearing a band on the radio but owning their albums is that you really do end up knowing that you like a song because it affects you, and not just because you're bombarded by it in public.\n\n15. The Body Electric is another jangly early 80s track. I liked it when I thought it was just a catchy song with a binary chorus. But it's based on a Twilight Zone episode by Ray Bradbury which, in turn, is based on a line by Walt Whitman. So it was pretty much designed for my enjoyment.\n\n16. The fourth song that has stuck with me during the vast years when I don't listen to Rush is Animate. This one was a single, and I get it. It's got the riffs, the easy to remember lyrics that sound like a bunch of platitudes in a love song lacking a narrative. And the breakdown, where they namedrop the album name (Counterparts) comes out of nowhere and then tosses you back to the original melody.\n\n​17. Territories flows out of the end of \"Animate\", with its almost Paul Simon rhythm guitar licks. Because of Gddy Lee's unique voice, it's instantly recognizable as Rush. Otherwise, this would be a real outlier song.\n\n18. Closing out the album is a quiet Tolkienesque ballad, Different Strings. I imagine it as a love song from Frodo to Sam at the end of their journey. It's an appropriately ridiculous way to end a Rush album that doesn't contain a focused narrative.\n\nDuring the early days of her career's shuttle-like rise (it took years to prepare for, but once she reached the digital platforms, she shot into the stratosphere), Billie Eilish was interviewed on a late night show. During the course of the interview, she was asked about Van Halen, and she didn't know who they were. She was massively ridiculed online for Not Knowing this seminal 80s rock band. But the thing is, you can't know Everything. And even if you, like Eilish, devour thousands of bands and albums, you're going to have a blind spot.\n\nSometimes a blind spot is sort of intentional. For me, that's The Rolling Stones. Apart from their massive hits, I've never really got into them. When Metric asked \"Who would you rather be? The Beatles or The Rolling Stones?\" I wanted to shout back. The Beatles, Of Course. My reimagined discography of The Beatles would be one of the lengthier discoveries I've done, even though they were only really around for a decade (though I would absolutely slot in their Anthology singles from the 90s). The Rolling Stones? You get two albums.\n\nWhen I was in high school I bought their four Greatest Hits albums, which include their work from 1964 - 1981. And I thought \"This is too much. Not all of these hits are very great. You could probably squish all the good songs on to one album.\"\n\nSo I've had my own Greatest Hits mix of The Rolling Stones for decades now. But since I was doing these discographies, I thought I should go through and listen to all their albums. Maybe a couple of times to really give them a chance.\n\nAt the end of the third listen-through, my opinion hadn't changed very much. The band, minus Mick Jagger, are extraordinary. They're versatile. They've evolved over the years. They're incredibly talented. But they're rarely innovative. When they are innovative, like they are on \"Gimme Shelter\" and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\", they're transcendent. But when they're playing American blues rock, they're just a very talented cover band with a nasally lead singer.\n\nMick Jagger is the problem. He's an excellent front man. Great energy, easy to impersonate, and when he's got a song in his range, you want to sing along with him. But, particularly in the 60s and 70s, he would try and be bluesy or morph his voice in interesting ways, and it just never worked for me.\n\nOne of my closest friends has an Exile On Main Street shirt, and has talked about the album at length to me. So I was excited to sit down and devour it. I imagined I would have a three or four album discography, and one of them would be a condensed Exile On Main Street. I listened to it twice in a row, trying to find anything that I would want to listen to again, and there was nothing for me. A group of tax dodging British millionaires trying to emulate Black American culture comes off exactly as disingenuous you might imagine from that description. Yea, the instruments sound great, but the nasally vocals clash with them, and the lyrics could be replaced with an air conditioner warranty manual, and they would have the same effect.\n\nIf I were going to be stuck on an island for a year, and given the choice between Exile On Main Street or a Right Said Fred album without even \"I'm Too Sexy\" on it, I'd choose Right Said Fred.\n\nThere is no Beatles album that I would even consider swapping out for Right Said Fred.\n\nAt the end of this last listen-through, I came out with a two album discography. And, I want to make it clear, I LOVE these two albums worth of songs. There was no struggle to fill up the two albums. I could listen to any of these songs on repeat (except \"Let It Bleed\") and be content.\n\n1. Tig Notaro has a routine about being in school, and having a teacher that asked students to bring in their favorite song. The teacher would play the beginning of the song at the end of the class. And, one day, a kid who was not Tig's friend asked Tig, because Tig is cool, what would be a cool song to play. Tig answered, honestly, You Can't Always Get What You Want. It is a very cool song. BUT it starts with a boy's choir singing the lyrics acapella. And the teacher only played that part of the song, making the kid embarrassed that people would think that he was super into boys choirs. It's a great routine. The dichotomy between that boys choir that floats at the beginning and end of the track and the Mick Jagger, congos and maracas and background singers chunk of the song is perfect.\n\n2. The drums and \"yeows!\" from Sympathy For The Devil creep through the end of the previous track. I first heard parts of this song during a live version of \"Bad\" by U2, and decided I needed to hear the original. Its a song that's been liberally covered by bands that I loved. But as much as I loved Guns N Roses in the 90s, I could never imagine deliberately listening to their horrendous whispery growled cover of this song. It sounds like a karaoke version recorded just after Rocky Horror Picture Show let out. The Rolling Stones version is such a weird mix of bongos, piano, and hooo-hooos that it always makes me smile. The guitar sounds like some sort of alien mosquito, occasionally buzzing by the song. It also has some of The Stones best narrative and lyric writing.\n\n3. So, uh, I also only sought out Ruby Tuesday because it's part of the same medley from the end of that live versino of U2's \"Bad\". Like \"Sympathy For The Devil\", it's more piano based than guitar. It also has the best fluttery flute use in rock and roll. I feel like, having grown up in the 80s and not the 60s, I don't usually enjoy this Frolicking In The Flowers rock. It (the genre, not this song in particular) was a cliched object of ridicule when I grew up. But this had the kind of catchy energy that makes it a bit of an exception. I can imagine this in an Ernest Goes Somewhere movie.\n\n4. The first really rock song on this imagined album, with it's fantastic drum intro, drum fills, and basic-ass riff is Get Off Of My Cloud. This was a song I'd hear on the oldies station pretty regularly. It's almost a Kinks song. It's nice and dirty with very 60s garage production. I can see it being a song where people at high school dances would shout the chorus at each other.\n\n5. And it leads into the dirtiest riff they ever produced. Even if you've tried (and tried and tried) to avoid The Rolling Stones, there is no escaping (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. What is there to say about this song? It's on every Best Rock Songs Of All Time List, even the one that's called Best Rock Songs Of All Time Not By The Rolling Stones. It's just that pervasive. I wonder if the lack of girly action is what led Jagger to Bowie.\n\n6. There's a bit of a twangy guitar transition from \"Satsifaction\" to another piano rag song, Let It Bleed. I kind of hate Jagger's vocals here, the fake drawl that he uses only at the end of certain lines. It's definitely a Get Ready To Stumble Home Drunk song for the end of the night at a very shitty bar.\n\n7. I think the only reason I enjoy Street Fighting Man is because I used to have a mashup of its music along with the vocals to The Temptations' \"Ball Of Confusion\", which is one of my favorite songs from that era. The music on \"Street Fighting Man\" is bright and flawless but the vocals have never really grabbed me. Too nasally and too cemented to the beat for a rock song about revolution. But that guitar riff is perfect.\n\n8. Similarly, the piano riff for Let's Spend The Night Together demands my attention every time I hear it. I do prefer the Bowie version, which I heard first, even though it is Uber 70s space rock. But this version is okay, too. The bada-bop-bop-bop-ba-da-das and the Beatlesque background vocals really make the song.\n\n9. Under My Thumb should really be a song about espionage rather than a song about taking control of a relationship from someone who used to be controlling. The lyrics on this song are kind of shitty. But that marimba and fuzz bass? *Chef's kiss\" And the quality of Jagger's vocals are perfect for this song. I just hate the lyrics.\n\n10. Tina Turner covered \"Under My Thumb\", and it's not one of my favorite songs when she sings it, either. But she should have covered Stray Cat Blues. How would it sound for an older woman to sing about how much she wanted to fuck a 15 year old groupie? Would it still be considered \"a classic\"? This is another song where I love the music but wish the lyrics were different.\n\n11. On the flipside, I love the lyrics on Mother's Little Helper. Great narrative, great rhyme scheme, great chorus. Getting old totally is a drag.\n\n12. Partially for the thematic dissonance with the previous track, and partly because I do love the organ intro and the fiftiesesque echoey production, the next track is Time Is On My Side. This has to be their best throwback song. This could be a Big Bopper track.\n\n13. The Rolling Stones have a lot of songs that are covers or blatant rip-offs of American blues. Most of them don't land for me. But Heart Of Stone sounds more like Cream or the other British bands doing blues-rock, and that hits differently. I like it. Jagger seems to be content to sound like Jagger, while the background vocals bounce between 50s croony background vocals, and the harsher 60s sound.\n\n14. Another song I first heard by U2 is Paint It Black. I love U2. They were my favorite band in high school, when I first heard their cover. I could not, with a straight face, say that their cover does the original justice. It's a paint-it-black-by-numbers version. I am glad that it turned me on to the original, though.\n\n15. Yesterday's Papers was in weird rotation on the oldies station my parents listened to. They often highlighted the echoey, barely produced rock with the slightly off-key doot-do-do-dooods in the background that were pervasive in the 60s. The highlights of the song for me are the haunting marimbas dripping off the equally hautning vibraphones giving the track something that's both very creepy, and very elevator jazz. It just makes me think about period pieces in the 60s about the 1940s for some reason.\n\n16. I almost think that the radio station previously mentioned used to medley \"Yesterday's Papers\" with Not Fade Away, since I hear them seeming to flow into each other, though they clearly do not. The vibraphones and marimbas are jettisoned for harmonica, tambourine, and hand claps. It's one of those covers that I am more familiar with than the original, even though it is not a better version.\n\n17. For me, the best song on this album is the closer. There's a lot of history behind the song that I've heard via poets, and VH1, and articles about bands who wreaked havoc on other musicians who worked with them. It's not my place to talk about it, but you should really research the history of Gimme Shelter. It's pretty dense, and important to music history. It's also just a killer song. Jagger is always better with background singers. He's never once been the best singer on a Rolling Stones album. I can't think of a single song that should even attempt to follow this.\n\nEnding the discovery on HitNRun EP was such a bummer. Latter-day Prince seems incredibly overwrought compared to his 80s and 90s output (and even his vaulted albums). So far, we've had three posthumous Prince albums (not including rereleases), Piano And A Microphone, which was a live album, Originals, which is a collection of singles and demos of Prince singing songs he wrote for other artists, and Welcome To America, easily the best of the trio.\n\nThere's not much for me to do with Piano And A Microphone. It's a live album, and not even a particularly well produced one. Nothing on it jumped out to me as Necessary. And I've sprinkled some of the tracks from Originals on previous albums because the tracks have been around forever, they just didn't have their own album in the real world.\n\nI decided to combine this most recent album with the HitNRun EP that I had already made. Look, there was no way to use 21st century Prince songs to make something as good as Sign O'The Times or anything. But this is a much more fun album to go out on than the previous version. The grungey somewhat overproduced HitNRun EP benefits from the more open and breezily mixed tracks from Welcome To America​. I would much rather listen to this album than either of the real world counterparts that make it up.\n\nWelcome To America is the obvious opening track for this album. Prince starts off going after capitalism with some moderately cheesy lyrics. It's catchy. It really wants to be Gil Scot Heron good, but it definitely sounds like an old person talking about modern things (modern being early 2010s) while using slogans from the late 80s and early 90s. It's still good, but without the music this would sound like a sloganeering slam poem that Old Heads would shit talk relentlessly when they got together.\n\nFixurlifeup sounds like a Foo Fighters track. A really good one. The lyrics are generic fixyourlifeup bumper sticker wisdom. But the guitar is a buzzing wasp, killing everything in its path.\n\nMy previous version of this album (The HitNRun EP) closed with Revelation but Welcome To America deserves better. This is some 90s sex under a waterfall music video with Kenny G on horns. It's really good for what it is, as it definitely sounds more Of An Era than an Outdated Shell Of A Song. Like, this SHOULD have been released in the 90s. People would have Fucked to this song, which is what Prince would have wanted. People still might be fucking to this song, but they're probably moving slow because they have to not because they're trying to be erotic. Nobody is breaking a hip to this song.\n\nBreak out your pompoms for Yes, it's got crunchy guitars but kind of bland sing-along vocals. Prince sings bass harmonies under the lead, and it's ... a choice. It's simultaneously a very late 80s and very late 90s production sound where the vocals feel like they're sitting in the wrong section of the mix, and all of the instruments are at the wrong volume. It's still a head bopper but with better production it could actually be good instead of just listenable.\n\nThere was a version of When She Comes on the HitNRun EP but this is not that version. That was a kind of overproduced definitely 21st century erotic Prince song. This version is Classic Prince. The instruments are stripped down. The harmonies are flawless. The lyrics are filthy. This is easily one of the best 21st century Prince songs. It could have been put out at any time in his career. Thank God for the return of Prince's falsetto erotic balladeering.\n\nAnother song from the previous version, Whitecaps is a loud bass and slamming drums song with an almost Porno For Pyros underwater instruments feel. Until the guitars kick in, it's difficult to realize this is a Prince track. He's barely a background vocalist here but it eventually morphs into recognizably Prince.\n\nThe song floats right into Stopthistrain. It's almost a continuation of the previous track, but now we at least get Prince harmonizing to Hannah Ford-Welton's lead vocals. The brief, echoey breakdown near the close of this track was probably the best part of the 3rdeyegirl portion of this album.\n\nThe lick of a bass. Prince shows up. Talking about his old days, taking the stage in our underwear. Who can help but Stare at Prince when he's on stage? And now that we've put the proper funk into the music, we're in familiar territory. He even pulls out the \"Kiss\" lick to remind us who he was. Ok. But who are you now, Mr. Nelson?\n\nThe keyboard intro for 1010 (Rin Tin Tin) is another case of This Could Be Prince From Anywhen. The lyrics are 21st century but the production is so much cleaner than most of the rest of this album. I would put this on a Best Of Prince album if I had to represent each of his albums.\n\nAnother Lover starts out with an almost Tom Morello riff before descending into ... Incubus? When I was writing about this for the previous incarnation of this album, I mentioned how itneresting it was to hear someone who influenced so much of modern music turn around and be influenced by the artists who came after him. Often it doesn't work at all. I think Duran Duran's Thank You was the first album where I thought bands should really stick to covering the songs from before they started making music, not the songs that came after them. This song isn't a cover, but it definitely sounds like Prince trying to capture a sound that has evolved past him. I still like it but it sounds like A Band With Vocals By Prince as opposed to A Prince Song.\n\nPlumelectric is straight up the licks from Rage Against The Machine's \"Revolver\" slightly retooled. Morello could have definitely sued him for credit as a songwriter. It's a banger, but, again, not precisely a Prince song even though it's definitely his fingers absolutely destroying the guitar in a late 90s grunge fashion.\n\nHere we go, Prince wants to make this woman scream in Hardrocklover which is half slow jam, half rock track. All Prince. This is the first production that sounds 2010s. It could also be a Frank Ocean track. Beyonce could be on vocals here. But, again, it's completely Prince on guitar.\n\nNow that all that heavily bassed guitar portion of the album is over, it's time for hand claps and harmonies with a 90s Prince feel instead of a 90s grunge feel. Same Page Different Book is Prince singing about war and religion, which he felt passionately about but never wrote particularly well. The lyrics to this song are ... fine. They're not going to explode your head. It has that \"Yea, I Said It\" feel without actually presenting any challenging ideas. But it feels good to listen to. The funk guitar is On Point.\n\nRunning Game (Son Of A Slave Master) is the best middle finger song on the album. It achieves what many of the rest of the songs on the actual version of Welcome 2 America aspired to. Nothing earth shattering or that you couldn't have heard at the average poetry slam before the pandemic but it feels better conceived than the other tracks.\n\nThe album Has To Close with One Day We Will All Be Free. It's just a great optimistic sounding closing track with lyrics that defy the optimistic music and title. It's the inverse of Jason Mraz's \"Life Is Wonderful\" where the lyrics are all about how great everything is while the vocals and instrumentation make it sound like someone is holding a gun to the head of Mraz's favorite dog. This is a false flag song that doesn't seem to believe in its title. And then it closes with that buzzy amp sound that filled most of the HitNRun​ era tracks. It's a phenomenal end to this particular album.\n\nThe 1980s were a bloated, cheesy masterpiece of professional wrestling. Soap opera storylines with Big Heroes (mind you, Hulk Hogan, the biggest \"hero\" in the WWE was always cheating to win, overcelebrating his friends' victories, hogging the spotlight, and stabbing his friends in the back while waving The American Flag), steroid riddled promos about vitamins, warriors, maniacs, hard times, and Space Mountain, and A-B-C match formats where the hero used the same stale and unimpressive move to somehow annihilate his previously healthy opponents. Something had to give.\n\nIt took time. Time and evolution (not Triple H, Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista; although they eventually contributed). Technical wrestling improved, storylines became more complex, and more room was made at the top for a wider variety of heroes and heels with fewer career jobbers making their way on TV.\n\nThis season sees The Four Horseman Era continue in WCW while their undercard trains to be the future of the WWE. Meanwhile WWE becomes more than just the Hogan/Savage/Warrior show, as Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, and The Undertaker make their presences known.\n\nThe middle of this season sees one of the three Gaping Creative Drouts that occured in wrestling during my lifetime. And, yet, they still contain some spectacular matches.\n\nSeason Two:\n\n​The New Power Generation\n\nStarring: Bret The Hitman Hart, Randy Macho Man Savage, The Nature Boy Ric Flair, The Immortal Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, Sting, The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase, Lex Luger, Jake The Snake Roberts, Vader, Mr. Perfect, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Virgil, Shawn Michaels, Legion Of Doom, Ron Simmons (soon to be known as Farooq), Raven, Rick Rude, Stunning Steve Austin, Miss Elizabeth, Shane Douglas, Sensational Sherri, Alundra Blayze, Dustin Rhodes (soon to be known as Goldust), Mick Foley as Cactus Jack, Scott Hall as Razor Ramon, and Kevin Nash as Diesel.\n\n200: A Not So Gentlewomens' Intermission, 1986-1990\n\nBefore we get back to WWE and WCW, and before we introduce ECW into the mix, another wrestling company deserves at least one episode in our chronology. The Gorgeous Ladies Of Wrestling inspired an incredible Netflix show, and had a decent, if often turbulent run on television over the course of four syndicated seasons. There are some amazing spots in this episode but there are no amazing matches. I doubt any reach above a two and a half on the Meltzer star scale. But the characters are fun, and Rob Sturma described it as Wrestling Hee-Haw which is an accurate description of the dad-joke sketches that absolutely saturated the show. I have kept that feel in this episode not because the jokes are good but because they're only slightly worse than some of the wrestling, so I felt like I should let this be an accurate experience of the TV show, if it were pay-per-v...sorry...premium live event length. Oh, and if you can't stomach terrible stereotypes, you're going to want to stay a million miles away from this, it is wildly 1980s offensive.\n\nAnnouncers: David McClane, Mike Morgan, Colonel Ninchotka, Sir Miles Headlock\n\n1.

Tina Ferrari & Ashley Cartier vs Hollywood & Vine\n\n201: Arrogance, 1990\n\nWhile we bid adieu to Hulkamania running wild at the end of last season, it's not dead. The 80s wrestlers didn't just disappear as 1990 rolled in. So here we see the old guard start to wind down as slightly younger wrestlers like Mr Perfect, Texas Tornado, Shawn Michaels, and The Undertaker all make their way to the top of the WWE wrestling cards. This also includes the Survivor Series where, at the end, everyone who survived the previous matches teamed up for a random faces vs random heels match. Zero points for guessing who overcame the odds to win. We also get a great buildup to a decent feud and terrible match as Rick Martel's fragrance takes on Jake Robert's vision.\n\n​Announcers: Roddy Piper, Vince McMahon, Gorilla Monsoon, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Lord Alfred Hayes, Howard Finkel.\n\n1.

Weirdly, almost all of the younger generation that appears in this season of WCW moves to WWE to get real famous next season. Still, it's fun to see Mick Foley as Cactus Jack, Steve Austin as The Hollywood Blond, and Ron Simmons just being his badass self before WWE started tossing gimmicks at him.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Terry Funk, Bob Caudle, Paul Heyman, Gordon Solie, Missy Hyatt, Tony Schiavone, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

We even start with The Rising Hero Of The Late 80s (Ultimate Warrior) vs 70s Superstar Sgt Slaughter, whose scond run in the WWE we're going to mostly skip because it was super cringey when it was happening, and it's worse now. Likewise, the Royal Rumble calls back to the 1970s, let's some of the 80s undercard and some up-and-coming 90s stars mix it up before totally 1987ing the ending.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Roddy Piper, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Howard Finkel\n\n​\n\n1.

I haven't watched it for a while, so I don't know if it's completely uncringey but I think I would remember if it was as politically graceless as the WWE. Also, bonus points for a very early Rey Mysterio match before he disappeared back to Mexico for a while.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Dusty Rhodes, Paul Heyman, Tony Schiavone, Missy Hyatt, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

Great Muta vs Sting\n\n9. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Tatsumi Fujinami (NJW Champ)\n\n205: Perfect Justice, 1991\n\nWe continue the slow passing of torches in 1991 with some excellent slow burn storylines, including the Ted Dibase/Virgil feud, and the blurring of whether Jake Roberts is a face or heel. It's also the beginning of the Golden Age of The Intercontinental Championship as some of the biggest future stars take their turns with the belt.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Bobby Heenan, Roddy Piper, Jim Duggan, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Lord Alfred Hayes, Honkey Tonk Man, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Ultimate Warrior vs Randy Savage in a Career Ending Match\n\n​206: The Chamber Of Horrors, 1991\n\nWhile the future of both WWE and WCW wrestling start to take control of the WWE in the early 1990s, WCW starts to descend into terrible gimmicks and an overreliance on tournaments to give shape to their pay-per-views. There are still some stellar performers and matches, though.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, Dusty Rhodes, Eric Bischoff, Missy Hyatt, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

Chamber Of Horrors Match\n\nSting, El Gigante, The Steiner Brothers vs Abdullah the Butcher, The Diamond Studd, Mick Foley (as Cactus Jack), Vader\n\n207: Match Made In Heaven, 1991\n\nThe double turn of Randy Savage and Jake Roberts was a perfect way to see them out of the WWE, it's almost a shame it wasn't either of their last matches for the company. They worked incredibly well together. We don't get to see their matchup in this episode, but it's totally set up here. We also get a better Dibiase/Virgil match, the total redemption of Randy Savage, and we realize that The Earthquake isn't going to get the chance to be The Monster Heel in place of Andre The Giant because The Undertaker is an unstoppable force.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Vince McMahon, Alfred Hayes, Bobby Heenan, Roddy Piper, Randy Savage, Jim Neidhart, Gene Okerlund, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs Undertaker\n\n208: Lethal Lottery, 1991, 1992\n\nWCW did a few of these Lethal Lotteries, where tag teams were put together randomly, and the winning teams' members were thrown into a 16 Man Battle Royal. It's an interesting concept. But this will be the only one I'm including in the series. Also, those Japanese wrestlers haven't gone away. They're still a vital part of this era of WCW, and it is Glorious.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, Eric Bischoff, Missy Hyatt, Magnum TA, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

Lex Luger (WCW Champ) vs Masahiro Chono\n\n9. Sting /Great Muta vs Steiner Brothers\n\n209: Fair To Flair 1991, 1992\n\nBobby Heenan's finest hour is calling the 1992 Royal Rumble, as WCW's biggest star has jumped ship and is running around the WWE with the WCW belt around his waist. It's fantastic. The rest of this match is the ending of feuds from previous episodes, and showing off a couple of new talents.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Lord Alfred Hayes, Howard Finkel\n\n1. Jake Roberts vs Randy Savage\n\n2. Undertaker (WWE Champ) vs Hulk Hogan\n\n3. New Foundation vs New Orient Express\n\n4.

Slaughter, Sid Justice, The Warlord\n\n210: Superbrawl 2, 1992\n\nAgain, this is kind of a gold buried under crap era for WCW, as it's slowly morphing from NWA to the official WCW. This episode, in particular, aligns with the earlier WWE matches from this season as 70s, 80s, and 90s stars are all represented pretty equally.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Jesse Ventura, Tony Schiavone, Eric Bischoff, Missy Hyatt, Barry Abrams, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

Sting's Squadron vs Dangerous Alliance\n\nSting, Barry Wyndham, Goldust, Ricky Steamboat, Nikita Koloff vs Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Larry Zbysko\n\n211: Damaged Goods, 1992\n\nAfter the last episode's Superkick Heard Round The Industry, Shawn Michaels begins his spinning heel turn, Ric Flair's plan to go after Hogan goes belly up when Hogan is suspended for steroids, so, instead, we get Flair vs Randy Savage, which proved to be more fun, anyway. (Don't worry, Hogan vs Flair is coming.)\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Bobby Heenan, Vince McMahon, Mr Perfect, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Howard Finkel\n\n1. Shawn Michaels vs Tito Santana\n\n2.

There's not much to say about this episode other than Congratulations to these wrestlers for making entertaining matches during one of the worst booked eras of a wrestling company that doesn't have Vince Russo on the payroll yet.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Jesse Ventura, Tony Schiavonne, Eric Bischoff, Bruno Sammartino, Missy Hyatt, Teddy Long, Magnum TA, Tony Gilliam, Gary Michael Cappetta\n\n1.

Sting vs Jake Roberts in a Coal Miner's Glove Match\n\n213: The Excellence of Execution, 1992, 1993\n\nHere we go, the old guard is almost completely gone (Hogan's appearance at the end of this episode is just to show what a desperate, aging cliche he had become THIRTY YEARS AGO.) and The Kliq (Shawn Michaels, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and XPac) are starting to dominate the entire industry, and will continue to do so for the rest of the decade.\n\nAnnouncers: Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Mr Perfect, Jim Duggan, Hillbilly Jim, Jim Ross, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Lord Alfred Hayes, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

But there's no denying its brief existence's long-term shadow on the industry. We begin with a ton of WCW and WWE stars past and future mingling with Philadelphia's homegrown talent. There won't be many ECW episodes, but the ones included will be bloody and unforgettable.\n\nAnnouncers: Joey Styles, Paul Heyman, Jay Sulli, Terry Funk, Tod Gordon\n\n1.

The Kliq and the Hart family continue to run rampant, Hulk Hogan wrestles his last WWE match for a decade, and XPac debuts (as the 123 Kid) becoming the most famous jobber of all time.\n\nAnnouncers: Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Randy Savage, Rob Bartlett, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Lord Alfred Hayes, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Vader vs Mick Foley in a Texas Death Match\n\n217: Everybody's Got A Price, 1993\n\nWWE's prime time show, Raw, expanded their ability to play with mid-term storytelling. You no longer had to compact a storyline into a single episode or make it months long in order to reach a pay-per-view event. I choose to celebrate this by condensing the Razor Ramon/1-2-3 Kid/Money Inc storyline into half an episode. We also get to see the short term revenge of Bret Hart against Jerry Lawler. Their storyline went on for months after this but the matches were at best terrible, and at worst, gross. We'll just pretend it stopped here. The Undertaker gets written off for the season here, and we wrap things up with the end of the thirty year Gorilla Monsoon/Bobby Heenan feud.\n\nAnnouncers: Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Jim Ross, Ted Dibiase, Gene Okerlund, Gene Wood, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Crush vs Tony Roy\n\n218: Crossing The Line, 1994\n\nFor the purposes of this project, I've referred pretty much all of the non-WWE episodes as WCW. By the mid-90s this was true. Before that, the NWA was the umbrella organization that ran an ever evolving set of smaller wrestling territories that gathered for the big pay-per-view events. Their titles had a variety of names that were difficult to keep track of. When WCW became The Official Competitor to WWE, NWA didn't go away, they just became less of a presence on television. They even decided to let their top title be decided in an ECW ring, and THAT is when ECW got famous. This episode ends with a unification match where the NWA and ECW titles were supposed to be merged, but instead the new champion rejects the NWA title, and declares that ECW doesn't need their support. It was a huge deal at the time, and brought a ton of eyes to the relatively new product.\n\nAnnouncers: Joey Styles, Paul Heyman, Tod Gordon, Bob Artese\n\n1. Jimmy Snuka vs Kevin Sullivan\n\n2.

No more shall Hogan, Heenan, Savage, Okerlund, Mr Perfect, Dibiase, Jimmy Hart, or any of their ilk cast their shadows on the WWE (well, ok, so SOME of them will come back eventually, but never for long). All the rising Harts, and Michaelses and, Razors both Ramon and not Ramon, and Diesels both Kevin Nash and Kane, Jerry Lawlers, and Jim Rosses shall come to forever be known as The Faces Of The WWE. I mean, for a few minutes, anyway.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Vince McMahon, Jerry Lawler, Bobby Heenan, Randy Savage, Ted Dibiase, Gene Okerlund, Todd Pettingill, Burt Reynolds, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Steve Austin, Mick Foley, and The Rock have dominated TV wrestling. WCW nailed its own coffin shut at the end of last season, so it sounds like a golden age for Vince McMahon's corporation. Ehhhh? We're nowhere near the end of the Austin/McMahon feud, but it feels like their journey from the Royal Rumble to Wrestlemania 15 is going to be its peak. We also get our first glimpse of Val Venis. I'm skipping a lot of Raw continuity because, while it's often good, every week is a different person turning on a different person until it was really impossible to tell who was teamed up with who. So, you know, it was Very Vince Russo.\n\nAnnouncers: Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, Howard Finkel\n\n1.

Over The Edge, 1999\n\nBecause Raw consistently featured pay-per-view quality booking, WWE's pay-per-view products got tremedously watered down. The Rock vs Mick Foley is great. The first five or six times. But the same pairing eight times in three months is exhausting, a lesson the WWE still hasn't learned. After this episode, we're going to skip a wide swath of main events, in order to focus on the undercard but first The Rock and Mankind have one of the best early cinematic matches in WWE history.\n\nAnnouncers: Michael Cole, Kevin Kelly, Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon,\n\n1.

The New Boss (2001)\n\nI've avoided as much as possible the WCW Vince Russo era. Just trust me, it's not worth it. A new title change very five minutes. \"Celebrity\" champions. Jay Leno wrestling. Vince Russo just chowing down on Hulk Hogan's c....ego. It's awful. So the owners decided to sell, and while Bischoff and some of the top brass at WCW made an offer, The McMahon family ended up purchasing the company, and Boom. No More WCW. It would now be owned by the WWE. The final episode of WCW Nitro had some decent curtain calls, so I've included those here.\n\n1. Vince McMahon announces he has purchased WCW\n\n2.

Vince McMahon decides to bring the NWO into WWE\n\n​\n\nWrestling is a work. It's sports entertainment with predetermined results. It's a soap opera famously designed for late twentieth century male-identified fans of steroid-riddled beefcakes. It's silly. It, like all sports, is 90% garbage, 10% amazing. It's way better than fat old white guys wearing tacky clothes on a liesurely walk through manicured grass while occasionally hitting a ball with a stick, or that other ball with a stick sport where a bunch of steroid-riddled non-beefcakes stand around in the sun (or the moon if it's a night game) waiting for someone to hit the ball in their general direction so they can maybe catch it or something.\n\nLook, it makes just as much sense as soccer or lacrosse or underwater foosball . When it's great, it's Ping Pong Parkour Great, and when it's bad, it's insufferable golf with sweatier men.\n\nI've watched A Lot of it. First in the eighties. All of my friends were into wrestling during the Hogan-centric era. All of them. Kids would act out The Interviews, not even the matches, The Interviews during recess, probably realizing they were more likely to grow up into Gene Okerlund or Tony Schiavone than Bret Hart of The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nIn the 90s, I lived with a family who got really into The Rock, Steve Austin, and Rey Mysterio, and I got hooked back in for a couple of years.\n\nPoetry slam took over most of my life in the 21st century, but I would hear people talk about certain names that I would remember, and I would go on Youtube or DailyMotion and seek out the match and see if it still had any emotional resonance. And sometimes it did.\n\nI am going to Seriously Condense wrestling history into a few seasons. Each season will contain YEARS of storylines. Maybe that sucks some of the drama out when you don't have to wait a full year for a feud to peak and resolve, but I want this list to MOVE. It will be mostly WWE (which is the product I grew up on) and some WCW. And eventually ROH, Impact, and AEW (which didn't even exist when I came up with this idea).\n\nThe first season, Rock And Wrestling starts off with a Pilot Episode that doesn't really fit with the rest of the season but includes a bunch of famous matches from before I was born. Some of those matches are historically important, some of them just introduce characters who will come back much later but who you should probably see some of their Ancient Work.\n\nI have edited all of these episodes together for my own personal use. I won't ever be sending these files out to people (because copyright is important) but I might do some free Discord viewing if people are interested.\n\nSeason One:\n\nRock, Wrestling, And The Megapowers\n\nStarring The Immortal Hulk Hogan, The Macho Man Randy Savage, Andre The Giant, The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase, The Nature Boy Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Ricky The Dragon Steamboat, The Ultimate Warrior, Jim Cornette, Brett The Hitman Hart. The Honkey Tonk Man, The Fantastics, The Midnight Ecpress, Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse The Body Ventura, Bobby The Brain Heenan, Mean Gene Okerlund, Miss Elizabeth, and Howard Finkel as \"The Fink\".\n\n100: All-American Wrestling\n\nI got into wrestling during Hulkamania, and never watched classic 70s or early 80s matches until I decided to work on this project. So this episode are all matches that are Historically Important. I was going to start with the end of Bruno Sammartino's first (and longest in history) reign as WWE (then WWWF) Champion, but the video from that match is really terrible, so I've decided to begin the series with the end of Sammartino's second reign, which also introduces us to the prototype that Hulk Hogan is based on.\n\nAnnouncers: Vince McMahon, Gorilla Monsoon, Gene Okerlund, Howard Finkel, and more.\n\n1. Bruno Sammartino (WWE Champ) vs Superstar Billy Graham, 1977\n\n2. Superstar Billy Graham (WWE Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes in a Texas Death Match, 1978\n\n3. Superstar Billy Graham (WWE Champ) vs Bob Backlund\n\n3. Terry Funk Vs Jerry Lawler in an Empty Arena Match, 1981\n\n4. Andre The Giant Vs Killer Khan in a Mongolian Stretcher Match, 1981\n\n5. Pat Patterson vs Sgt Slaughter in a Street Fight, 1981\n\n6. Bob Backlund (WWE Champ) vs Superfly Jimmy Snuka in a Steel Cage, 1983\n\n7. Dynamite Kid vs Tiger Mask 3 in Japan, 1983\n\n8. Bob Backlund (WWE Champ) vs. The Iron Sheik, 1983\n\n9. Iron Sheik (WWE Champ) vs. Hulk Hogan, 1983\n\n101: WCW Starrcade 1983/1984\n\nThe first closed-circuit wrestling spectacular for a revamped wrestling promotion, Starrcade introduces us to a bunch of faces who will become famous in the WWE but who put on some of their best matches in this slightly less soap-opera-y divison.\n\n1. Abdullah The Butcher vs Carlos Colon\n\n2. Roddy Piper Vs Greg Valentine in a Dog Collar Match\n\n3. Brisco Brothers (WCW Tag Champs) vs Ricky Steamboat and Tully Blanchard\n\n4. Harley Race (WCW Champ) vs Ric Flair\n\n5. Tully Blanchard (WCW TV Champ) vs Ricky Steamboat\n\n6. Wahoo McDaniel (WWE US Champ) vs Superstar Billy Graham\n\n102: The Birth Of Wrestlemania, 1984\n\nNo one can deny that Hulk Hogan was The Guy who made wrestling mainstream, and as quirky as the weekly wrestling Superstars shows were, I'm really not inflicting people with Famous Wrestlers Take On Jobbers (usually local talent whose job it was to lose matches and make the stars look good), so the WWE story really gets revved up with the first WWE (then WWF, no longer the WWWF) pay-per-view spectacular. The first match does not take place at Wrestlemania but was a match worthy of being on the ppv. I've also tacked on some early Saturday Night Main Event matches to stretch this out to two hours. This really helps because the main event of Wrestlemania was kind of meh. This allows the main event to be Hulk Hogan (in white diapers instead of the usual yellow) waving an American flag. Ain't nothing more 1980s WWE than that.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse Ventura, Vince McMahon, Gene Okerlund, Alfred Hayes, Howard Finkel\n\n1. The Iron Shiek vs Sgt Slaughter\n\n2. Junkyard Dog vs Greg Valentine\n\n3. Andre The Giant vs Big John Studd\n\n4. Wendi Richter (WWE Woman's Champ) vs Leilani Kai\n\n5. Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) and Mr. T vs Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorfff\n\n6. Wendi Richter (WWE Woman's Champ) vs Fabulous Moolah\n\n7. Terry Funk vs The Junkyard Dog\n\n8. Randy Savage vs George Steele\n\n9. The Dream Team (WWE Tag Team Champs) vs The British Bulldogs\n\n10. Hulk Hogan vs Nikolai Volkov in a Flag Match\n\n103: The Great American Bash, 1985\n\nWhile some of the talent from the first WCW episode jumped ship for the WWE for the Wrestlemania era, those who stayed behind worked some serious grit into their routines to balance the WWE's polished Hollywood storylines. This episode features matches from the first Great American Bash, as well as the third Starrcade.\n\nAnnouncers: Bob Caudle, Gordon Solie, Barbara Clary, Tony Schiavone, Tom Miller\n\n1. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Nikita Koloff\n\n2. Tully Blanchard (WCW TV Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes in a Steel Cage\n\n3. Abdullah The Butcher vs Manny Fernandez\n\n4. Magnum TA Vs Tully Blanchard\n\n5. The Koloff Brothers (WCW Tag Team Champs) vs Rock & Roll Express\n\n​6. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes\n\n104: The Wrestling Classic, 1985\n\nWrestlemania 2 is kind of a letdown. There aren't a ton of good storylines or matches, but if you combine it with the exceptionally well formatted (for an early 80s ppv) event like The Wrestling Classic, you get a solid 80s rasslin' show. Also, this event is 50% Randy Macho Man Savage matches. This is mostly because of The Wrestling Classic tournament, but also because, even though he wasn't Hulk Hogan, he was omnipresent in all their marquee shows.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse Ventura, Gene Okerlund, Vince McMahon, Alfred Hayes, Elvira, Tommy Lasorda, Ricky Schroeder, Howard Finkel\n\n1. Junkyard Dog vs Ted Dibiase\n\n2. Randy Savage vs Ricky Steamboat\n\n3. Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs Roddy Piper\n\n4. Randy Savage vs Dynamite Kid\n\n5. Junkyard Dog vs Randy Savage\n\n6. Ricky Steamboat vs Hercules\n\n7. Randy Savage vs George Steele in a Lumberjack Match\n\n8. Hulk Hogan vs King Kong Bundy in a steel cage\n\n105. Skywalkers, 1986\n\nWhile Hulk Hogan was the face for WWE, a certain someone to be revealed later was definitely The Man Behind The Scenes. Over in WCW, Ric Flair was the face of the promotion but his biggest rival was also one of WCW's best bookers and promoters, and 1986 was a great year for the man called Dusty Rhodes. This episodes features matches from the 2 WCW ppvs in 1986: Great American Bash 2, and Starrcade 4, as well as some of the Clash Of The Champions TV events.\n\n​1. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Ron Garvin\n\n2. Legion Of Doom (WCW Tag Team Champs) Vs Koloff Brothers in a Russian Chain Match\n\n3. Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA, and Baby Doll vs Midnight Express & Jim Cornett in a Steel Cage Match\n\n4. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes in a Steel Cage Match\n\n5. The Fantastics (UWF Tag Team Champs) vs The Bushwhackers (as The Sheepherders) in a New Zealand Boot Camp Match\n\n6. Wahoo McDaniel vs Rick Rude in a Strap Match\n\n7. Big Boss Man (as Big Bubba) vs Ron Garvin in a Louisville Street Fight\n\n8. Dusty Rhodes (WCW TV Champ) vs Tully Blanchard in First Blood Match\n\n9. Legion Of Doom vs Midnight Express in a Skywalkers Match\n\n10. The Rock & Roll Express (Tag Team Champs) vs The Minnesota Wrecking Crew in a Steel Cage Match\n\n106. The Slam Heard Round The World, 1987\n\nMore Saturday Night Main Events matches to end old storylines and tease events for Wrestlemania 3.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Lord Alfred Hayes, Vince McMahon, Jesse Ventura, Bob Eueker, Mary Hart, Gene Okerlund, Howard Finkel\n\n1. Hulk Hogan and Junkyard Dog vs. The Funks\n\n2. Ricky Steamboat vs Jake Roberts\n\n3. Hart Foundation vs Tito Santana & Dan Spivey\n\n4. Junkyard Dog vs Harley Race\n\n5. Randy Savage vs Ricky Steamboat\n\n6. Honky Tonk Man (WWE Intercontinental Champ) vs Jake Roberts\n\n7. Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs Andre The Giant ​​\n\n107. The Survivor Series, 1987/88\n\nAfter some requisite setup matches from Saturday Night's Main Events, we see a cool team tournament idea that still sort of exists to this day, a bunch of five person teams come together to tie several wrestler's storylines into fancy knots while introducing new grudges and opportunities. Plus, the first ever (it wasn't even on pay-per-view!) Royal Rumble. Ending this with a Royal Rumble gives us our first WWE episode not headlined by Hulk Hogan!\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse Ventura, Vince McMahon, Gene Okerlund, and Craig DeGeorge, and Howard Finkel\n\n​\n\n1. The Hart Foundation (WWE Tag Team champs) vs British Bulldogs\n\n2. Honkey Tonk Man (WWE Intercontinental Champ) vs Randy Savage\n\n3. Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs King Kong Bundy\n\n​4. Bam Bam Bigelow vs Hercules\n\n5. The Honkey Tonkers vs The Savage Animals\n\nHonkey Tonk Man, Ron Bass, Harley Race, Hercules, and Danny Davis vs Randy Savage, Brutus Beefcake, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, and Jim Duggan\n\n6. Hulkamaniacs vs The Giants Of Wrestling\n\nHulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Don Muraco, Paul Orndorff, and Ken Patera vs Andre The Giant, King Kong Bundy, Rick Rude, Butch Reed, and The One Man Gang.\n\n7. The Glamour Girls (WWE Womens Tag Team Champs) vs Jumping Bomb Angels\n\n8. The Inaugural Royal Rumble\n\nBret Hart, Tito Santana, Butch Reed, Jim Neidhart, Jake Roberts, Harley Race, Jim Brunzell, Sam Houston, Danny Davis, Boris Zhukov, Don Muraco, Nikolai Volkoff, Jim Duggan, Ron Bass, B Brian Blair, Hillbilly Jim, Dino Bravo, Ultimate Warrior, One Man Gang, and Junkyard Dog​\n\n108: War Games, 1987\n\nWCW's answer to The Survivor Series pits two teams of four or five people in a steel cage! I've also included the following ppv, Starcade, to flesh this out.\n\n1. The Road Warriors vs The Four Horsemen\n\nLegion Of Doom, Nikita Koloff, Dusty Rhodes, and Paul Ellering vs Ric Flair, Lex Luger, Arn Andersen, Tully Blanchard, and JJ Dillon\n\n2. Eddie Gilbert/Larry Zbysko/Rick Steiner vs Sting/Jimmy Garvin/Michael Hayes\n\n3. Lex Luger (WCW TV Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes\n\n4. Ric Flair (WCW Heavyweight Champ) vs Barry Windham\n\n5. Barry Windham (WCW Western States Champ) vs Larry Zbysko\n\n109: The Tournament Of Champion, 1988\n\nAnother Wrestling Classic style tournament takes place at Wrestlemania 4, but this time, it's to crown a new champion due to some chicanery from The Main Event that led to the tournament. Also, the closing match gives us a new champion, who's not wearing yellow and red! I've also tacked on some matches post-Wrestlemania so you can see Hulk Hogan with Elizabeth as his manager, but also end with Randy Savage defending his title, and not having Hogan around to hog his spotlight.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse Ventura, Vince McMahon, Bob Ueker, Gene Okerlund, Vanna White, Robin Leach, and Howard Finkel\n\n1. Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs Andre The Giant\n\n2. Ted Dibiase vs Jim Duggan\n\n3. Honky Tonk Man (WWE Intercontinental Champ) vs Brutus Beefcake\n\n4. Randy Savage vs One Man Gang\n\n5. Strike Force (WWE Tag Champs) vs Demolition\n\n6. Rady Savage vs Ted Dibiase for the WWE Title\n\n7. Rick Rude vs Koko B Ware\n\n8. Randy Savage (WWE Champ) vs One Man Gang\n\n110. Bunkhouse Stampede, 1988\n\nAs an event, The Bunkhouse Stampede is often considered a failure, but if you smush it together with the following event, The Great American Bash, you get a pretty solid WCW ppv event.\n\nAnnouncers: Jim Ross, Tony Schiavone, Bob Caudle, Missy Hyatt, Jack Gregory, and Tom Miller\n\n​\n\n1. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Hawk\n\n2. Steel Cage Bukhouse Stampede\n\nDusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Lex Luger, Barbarian, Warlord, Ivan Koloff, Animal, and Tully Blanchard\n\n3. The Midnight Express (WCW Tag Team Champs) vs The Fantastics\n\n4. Tower Of Doom Match\n\nLegion Of Doom, Steve Williams, Ron and Jimmy Garvin vs Al Perez, Ivan Koloff, Kevin Sullivan, IRS, and The Russian Assassin\n\n5. Barry Windham (WCW US Champ) vs Dusty Rhodes\n\n6. Ric Flair (WCW Champ) vs Sting\n\n111: The Megapowers, 1988\n\nHulk Hogan, egomaniacal former champ, and Randy Savage, egomanical current champ, join forces to utterly dominate the industry with their storyline. This episode features the first ever Summer Slam, and the second Survivor Series. Please note that the \"Hart Family\" here is not, in fact The Hart Family (Bret, Owen, The British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart), who will become the main stars of season two, but members of Jimmy Hart's wrestling stable.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Vince McMahon, Jesse Ventura, Superstar Billy Graham, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, and Howard Finkel\n\n1. Randy Savage (WWE Champ) vs Andre The Giant\n\n2. Hulk Hogan vs Haku\n\n3. Honky Tonk Man (WWE Intercontinental Champ) vs Ultimate Warrior\n\n4. Demolition (WWE Tag Team Champs) vs Hart Foundation\n\n5. Megapowers vs Megabucks\n\n6. The Hart Family vs The Warriors\n\nHonky Tonk Man, Greg Valentine, Bad News Brown, Ron Bass, and Danny Davis vs Ultimate Warrior, Brutus Beefcake, Owen Hart, Jim Brunzell, and Sam Houston\n\n7. Super Megapowers vs Million Dollar Dream Team\n\nHulk Hogan, Macho Man, Hercules, Koko B Ware, and Hillbilly Jim vs Ted Dibiase, Big Boss Man, One Man Gang, Haku, and the Red Rooster\n\n112: Chi-Town Rumble, 1988\n\n2/3rds of WCW's 1988 events smushed into one supercard, including the first of the three epic showdowns between Ricky Steamboat and Ric Flair.\n\n​\n\nAnnouncers: Tony Schiavone, Magnum TA, Jim Ross, Bob Caudle, and Gary Michael Capetta\n\n1.

Make no mistake, Hulk Hogan is in every wrestling season for years and years and years, but this Wrestlemania 6 outing marks the end of Hogan's death grip on the WWE Heavyweight title. Sure, he'll snatch it again a few times, but he'll never have another five year long run with the gold again. This also signals the end of 80s stars' domination of the industry, as \"The New Generation\" starts stepping into the spotlight. We also highlight the role of Earthquake who seems to be about to replace Andre The Giant as the WWE's Monster Heel.\n\nAnnouncers: Gorilla Monsoon, Jesse Ventura, Jim Ross, Bob Caudle, Gene Okerlund, Sean Mooney, Tony Schiavone, Gordon Solie, Gary Michael Cappetta, Howard Finkel.\n\n1.

Hulk Hogan (WWE Champ) vs Ultimate Warrior (WWE Intercontinental Champ)\n\nEvery year, more and more people on my various social media feeds post links to the Mountain Goats' \"This Year\". Some of them have never heard another Mountain Goats song, some of them have every album (even the cassettes) that John Darnielle ever even contemplated recording.\n\nI'm not at all an expert on the band. I have dated and lived with a variety of people who played their songs since the late 90s. I have enjoyed the music, dismissed the music, been frustrated by songs put on repeat, and occasionally wished for an alternate universe where The Mountain Goats didn't exist (through no fault of the actual band).\n\n2020 was the year a series of communities were forced to move from in-person to online, and that included a poetry community I'm a part of. Every week we do a themed event where people might write about birds, water, wearing a bunny suit, their personal hells, whatever mood strikes the sadistic organizer (who is me). About 1/3rd of the weeks, someone submits a poem that references The Mountain Goats. It's not always the same person, either. Some of the rest of the group scratches their facial hair and says something akin to \"I guess I'll have to look up these Mountainous Sheep\" (many in the group are comfortably unhip) \"and give their music a listen.\"\n\nWell, here you are ye ancient poets. A primer discography for The Mountain Goats. Their actual output is stunningly dense with more songs that anyone should have to listen to in a year. I've cut and pasted their EPs and their full albums together, leaving almost no corner of their output untouched. The exception? The cassette albums. Ispent a majority of the mid to late nineties messing around with other peoples' four or eight track recorders trying to help them edit their concept album about cars or their whiney, accidentally misogynist songs about how nobody loved them. The unprofessional lofi hiss (there are some that rise to professional levels) just brings back too many boring memories, so I just can't endure the cassette output. But I am combing through everything else.\n\nWe're going to start with the lowest-fidelity I can handle. The early EPs leading up to their first full-length adventure: Zopilote Machine, as well as tracks from said album. It's one of the shorter albums I've ever done for one of these discographies, but 1.) The early Mountain Goats songs tend to blend together and cause me to lose interest after a while, and 2.) It feels wrong to make this longer. Tape is expensive!\n\nEverybody ready? Sinaloan Milk Snake Song pretty much encapsulates the early sound of The Mountain Goats for me. Strummy guitar, a seemingly stream of consciousness set of lyrics, nasally lead vocals. It's musically upbeat (partially due to the background vocals from The Casual Girls and the la la la la la la la la refrains) while the lyrics are fairly downerish. It's a contrast that seems inherent in almost all of Darnielle's music. It just *sounds* like everything is going to be okay, even as he sings about how awful everything is.\n\nWe have a staticy interlude before the percussive guitar moves in for the near-Christmas song (holly and mistletoe?), Night Of The Mules. Clip-clop clip-clop.\n\nI bury the hum from the beginning of Pure Honey beneath the percussion of the previous track. I just enjoyed the way they flowed together. Like many of the songs on this mix, the track clocks in at under two minutes. It's just this weird little misdirect song, where you think it's going to have some sort of existential meaning, but it just plops in a random phrase and stops. They have a more famous version of this trick called \"Monkey Song\" but I much prefer this song, as the lyrics end almost as soon as it reaches the weirdness, and it just repeats the song instrumentally.\n\nAzo The Nelli In Tlalticpac is quite the mouthful. And it sounds like pretty much every track where one dude plays a guiatar and sings a serious and repetitive song into a four track recorder. I'm not sure I'd like this song if it weren't so lo-fi. The lyrics are fine. The guitar is adequate. It just seems to be one of the prime listenable examples of this kind of recording.\n\nDrum machines and keyboards? On this album? Yeup. If Song For Tura Santana wasn't recorded in a basement or a windowless one-room studio apartment, then it is a musical crime. It's so basic.\n\nThen beneath the basic fade out, Barbara Streisand gets all melodramatic, and then Quetzacoatl Is Born rises in nasally, strumming glory. It makes me want to break out the Saddle Creek catalogue, put on an unnecessary winter hat, and smoke some American Spirits. Into the fire you go!\n\nWe Have Seen The Enemy is one of those lovely Dude Talks Over Guitar Until Oh Shit! He's Singing Now Because This Is A Song. It's a trope I often enjoy, and this track is no exception. I also like that you get One Verse of the song, and then it's over.\n\nOn Tuesday nights for a few years, a few friends and writers would meet up for drinks at a bar called Grendel's Den. It's pretty much my only positive association with the Beowulf villain, apart from Grendel's Mother, which at least one of my former roommates used to sit in his bedroom and play for hours at a time.\n\nGoing To Lebanon seems like a musical continuation of the previous track. Like Grendel's mom has nowhere to run to / nowhere to go except Lebanon. And why not? We also have the return of The Casual Girls, who aren't always on-pitch, or even well-harmonized, and yet I enjoy them every time they show up in this discography.\n\nI guess Lebanon didn't work out for the narrator beause now he's Going To Maryland, and he didn't even take The Casual Girls with him! He's just focused on water. Which, ok. Why not?\n\nAnother song that bubbles in under the previous track is Pure Love which is a lovely keyboard-belltone song about how someone plots to steal the narrator's heart, even though he never mentions his heart or does more than hint that a crime has been committed. Also, it won't be necessary. He keeps telling you that.\n\nThe Mountain Goats has a series of songs from 1991-1995 called \"Standard Bitter Love Song\"s. They're fine. But my favorite bitter love song of his is Orange Ball Of Hate, which is also a counterpart to \"Orange Ball Of Love\", which is a fine song, but didn't quite make the cut for me, even though it would have been a neat callback.\n\nPure Heat keeps mentioning the weather from the last track. We're nearing the end of this very short album, and this feels like just the track to tow us there.\n\nIn fact, here we are at the end, and, what's that? We have another journey to take? Ok, I guess we're Going To Georgia. This song just sounds like something twenty-somethings in the mid-nineties would yell loudly along with the band. The club was way past capacity because the fire codes wouldn't be taken seriously for another five or six years. The club reeks of cheap cigarettes, sweat, and probably a bit of patchouli. The bartenders are pissed because there is almost nobody over twenty at this show. And then the song stops, and the kids cheer, but they don't Go anywhere (not even Georgia or Maryland or Lebanon) because there's nothing else to do in this town but go to small indie shows and talk about leaving. \"If I don't make it,\" the audience thinks, \"I hope this band does.\"\n\nAs I've previously mentioned, I'm not a Neil Young expert. I'm coming to this discography from ap lace of ignorance. I know those influenced by him more than I know why he influenced them. Yes, I'm familiar with his 70s hits, and his 90s resurgence but I had no idea who he was in the 80s.\n\nThere's a reason.\n\nNeil Young went through some shit in the 80s. He was given a contract with \"complete artistic freedom\" and he took advantage of that. And his albums tanked. Most of them aren't awful, they just aren't traditional Neil Young albums. It's like if U2 went direct from Joshua Tree to Zooropa. It's jarring. So jarring that his label tried to sue him for breach of contract, claiming his 80s output was \"musically uncharacteristic of (his) previous albums\". They lost. They even apologized for the lawsuit, after the fact.\n\nThe albums that make up this reimagined album are Re-ac-tor, Trans, Everybody's Rockin', and Landing On Water. Apart from Everybody's Rockin', none of them are bad albums. They're just neither excellent, nor Neil Youngish. But they're creative, and each of them has at least a couple of good songs. Everybody's Rockin' has one fun song and one good song, but its Hey Remember The 50s Rockabilly Sound was stale forty years ago, and hasn't aged any better.\n\nBut there's something charming about the combination of these styles into one eclectic, hard to pin down album.\n\nIt's definitely the 80s in NeilYoungland. Check out the synth beats on People On The Street. This ain't your guitar strumming champion of the people. Oh, wait, here comes that reedy voice, and he is trying to get you to help the homeless. Ok, so this is the familiar Neil Young, and while this is the band Crazy Horse, which have played with him before, they sure do sound different. The background vocals on the chorus sound very soft rock/r&b 80s, though I couldn't name a band that they sound precisely like.\n\nWe continue with the Computer Age sound. Though this song also has Young's guitar fingerprints alongside the synth chords. I can't decide if the main vocals on this track have been hit with a little echo but the background vocals have absolutely been vocoded to the stratosphere. Why is Neil Young suddenly on vocoder? According to Young, he was having trying to reconcile the fact that his son, who has cerebal palsy, couldn't speak, and so he was toying with making his own communication more complicated.\n\nTouch The Night hits us with some heavy guitar at the beginning before tossing in a boys' choir and synth. But then, there it is, the unmistakable Neil Young vocals that could have come from any point in his discography. This song follows the metaphoric trajectory of \"Computer Age\", as we've got a bunch of traffic and highways scattered throughout the lyrics of both songs. Apart from the synth touches, this absolutely could have come out of his late 70s output and not confused any of his fans, or his record label.\n\nThat's also true of the next song, Ra-pid Tran-sit, which is all guitars. He pitches his voice a bit lower for some of the vocals, and includes a stutter to the beginning of each non-chorus line but it's, otherwise, classic Neil Young, and comes before the Geffen records debacle, but it fits nicely on this album.\n\nMost of the albums that Geffen records didn't like, I quite enjoy. They definitely aren't hits, and I prefer them as background music than albums that I'm going to give my full focus. The exception is 1983's Everybody's Rockin', which is, at its core, a terrible record. A nostalgic for the 1950s \"rockabilly\" album. I'm glad Young had fun recording it, and touring behind it, but it is a slog to listen to. Wonderin' is one of the two tracks on the album that I don't mind, as it really sounds more like a Neil Young song in the style of the 1950s, rather than Neil Young trying to recreate a 1950s sound. As an anomoly on this eclectic album, I think it's great.\n\nThere's a nice little clanging bell that brings us back from the 1950s to the 1970s/80s guitar rock of Southern Pacific. The lyrics, about a rail worker being let go because of his advancing age, is vintage Young.\n\nLike An Inca is just enjoyable Neil Young guitar rock. He doesn't strain his voice up, the way he does on many of his tracks, which gives the song a much more relaxed vibe. Especially with the background vocals.\n\nWriting the descriptions of this album, has me realizing how much I do enjoy his more traditional work to the experimental phase. A majority of the songs on this Musically Uncharacteristic Of (His) Previous Albums, really aren't that uncharacteristic. They're musically satisfying, and include alterations to the 1960s/1970s Neil Young formula, but I don't find them all that jarring. I'm surprised more of them weren't hits for him.\n\nOk, I know why Kinda Fonda Wanda, another of his 1950s style songs wasn't a hit, but it's a ridiculous and fun song. I've trimmed the second verse off because the lyrics are novelty-style and thematically repetetive, but I enjoy the core joke of the song. Young isn't often known for his sense of humor. But it's clearly there. This is also a nice breather, as it's about a minute and a half, while the previous song was nearly ten minutes long. Twiddly-dee!\n\nI Got A Problem gives us heavy guitars, and a drum beat that would make Phil Collins's heart flutter. This is another song about having problems communicating. Yet the song, itself, from lyrics to the limited instrumentation, is crystal clear in its meaning.\n\nThe synth is back for Bad News Beat. So are generic love lyrics. But they're catchy, and very, very, very New Age 80s. You could definitely imagine this as a Cars song with Neil Young on vocals. It's not the same kind of fun as \"Kinda Fonda Wonda\" but it is light, and just sounds warm, like it could be in the background of a beach montage scene in an 80s action film. Right up until the breakdown, which is remarkably spare.\n\nYou can hear Kraftwerk's fingerprints all over We R In Control. Young's conspiracy theorist's wet dream theme song. All the lyrics are vocoded. Instead of a beach scene, this is an all-night scene where you flash across a city stopping at the inordinate amount of sinister looking, suit and sunglassed government employees, spying on the general public with no moral qualms.\n\nWe close out the album with a piano nostalgia song. Get Back On It is somewhere on the border of the Everybody's Rockin' album, and Young's 70s output. It does transition to an electric guitar ending, and will bring us into the next evolution of Young's music.\n\n​\n\nI was inspired to do a reimagined Tom Petty discography by the release of Wildflowers And All The Rest a few weeks ago. Wildflowers has consistently been my favorite Petty album since it came out. Before the new version of the album was released, my own personal mix had the original album, the two new cuts from Greatest Hits and \"Walls\" from the She's The One Soundtrack. Many of the cuts released from the new album are from the recording sessions for those two albums, as well as the original Wildflowers album. I had debated just making my versoin of Wildflowers and then tacking on a new album's worth of material, but (and it's a big but) the additional songs are great for enhancing the feel of the album, but I don't know how often I'd listen to just the non-album tracks, even if I attached them to the Greatest Hits and She's The One Soundrack songs. So I've integrated them int"
