        "text": "George is out and about and looking lovely! George + Milan Fashion Week = every girls' dream :P Today he attended the Giorgio Armani Spring-Summer 2007 men's fashion collection, which is part of the Milan Men's Fashion Week, in Milan, Italy.\n\n( + 7 images under hereCollapse )\n\nMore images are up at ClooneyNetwork and ClooneyStudio. :)\n\nFrom Yahoo! News: Giorgio Armani gave his younger rivals a lesson in effortless cool on Wednesday, showing shirts and suits so casually sexy actor George Clooney says they could help him cope with aging.\n\nMen wearing broad-shouldered pinstripe suits and dandy shoes strolled down the catwalk in small groups, hands in their pockets or arm-in-arm with chic girls in flowing silk trousers and jauntily tilted Parisian berets.\n\n\"It's beautiful. I've only been to one of his shows before, I haven't really been to menswear shows often,\" Clooney told Reuters after the show, in the middle of Milan fashion week.\n\n\"I usually can't wear clothes like that because they are made for men in their 20s, and you've got to understand that when you're aging, suits become more important.\"( Read more...Collapse )\n\nWHEN A MOVIE HIT - OR BOMB - ISN'T IN THE SCRIPT\n\nFrom an article about film production: \"You start off with a great script, the director screws it up,\" says George Clooney, who has experienced success and failure on both sides of the camera. \"An actor gives a bad performance. The editor screws up. The music sucks. The release date sucks. The ad campaign sucks.\" It takes a miracle for everything to come together, he says.\n\nREVISTING GEORGE'S BARBARA WALTERS INTERVIEWS\n\nFrom Fox News: Whenever he sees Barbara Walters, George Clooney mentions how he's still paying for telling her in an interview that he was never going to marry again.\n\nFuture Clooney dates will have an opportunity to revisit that talk, and hundreds of other interviews Walters has conducted for ABC News specials over the past three decades, due to a deal announced Monday with Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\n\"It is a wonderful way for them to be heard,\" Walters told The Associated Press. \"So many of them are classics. It is everything from Lucille Ball and John Wayne and Bing Crosby and George Burns to Matthew McConaughey and Julia Roberts.\"\n\nGEORGE'S FAMILY TREE\n\nFrom an article about celebrity heritage: According to the 1880 American census, the great-great-grandfather of George Clooney, the actor, emigrated from Ireland and became a jeweller.\n\nHis son Andrew became mayor of Maysville, Kentucky, and campaigned with the help of George’s singing aunts — Rosemary and Betty — who were radio stars.\n\n'SELF CONGRATULATORY' CLOONEY SLAMMED\n\nFrom PR Inside: Hollywood agent-turned-documentary maker PAT DOLLARD has attacked GEORGE CLOONEY's outspoken anti-war stance.\n\nDollard - the former agent of regular Clooney colleague STEVEN SODERBERGH is currently making a pro-war documentary about Marines fighting in Iraq.\n\nHe was furious when Clooney urged more Democrats to speak out against the war and 'congratulated' himself for doing so.\n\nHe tells PageSix.com, \"I read something on the Internet in which someone was patting himself on the back for having the courage to oppose the war.\n\n\"They actually equate bravery with speaking out against the president because (losing fans) might cost them one less servant at their Italian villa . . . It put me into a black rage and made me sick to my stomach.\" Dollard, a republican, also attacked the way supporters of the party in the entertainment industry have been ostracised, adding, \"Being a Republican in Hollywood today is not much different than being a communist in Hollywood in the 1950s. I'm not trying to overstate the case, but the reality is there is a blacklist in Hollywood. It's very McCarthy-like. It just shows the hypocrisy of the left.\"\n\nGEORGE MENTION\n\nFrom Philly.com: Many of us actually prefer a George Clooney-type build over, say, the washboard abs of a swimsuit model. A little bulk feels, well, masculine and comforting. Besides, being with a guy with an extra inch or so of padding, means you don't have to suck in your stomach so much.\n\nGEORGE MENTION #2\n\nFrom Net Music Countdown: The Modern Drummer article also reveals that (Danny) Carey enjoys playing basketball. So much so, that he joined the NBA Entertainment League, where he plays hoop with other basketball fanatics including George Clooney and Bow Wow.\n\nGIRLS FANTASISE ABOUT GEORGE\n\nFrom The Sun: The favourite celebrity fantasy lover for women is Ocean’s Eleven star George Clooney. Next came footie’s David Beckham followed by movie tough nut Ray Winstone.\n\nWhich leads nicely on to a column/feature from The Independent newspaper about one columnist's fantasy (Thanks to Chris for this!):\n\n( under a cut because it could be seen as sexually explicit :PCollapse )\n\nTHE CLOONEY FAN SITES\n\nClooneyNetwork has added clips of George talking about the screenplay for Syriana, being interviewed for Boffo! Tinseltown's Bombs and Blockbusters and on the TV series Hotel, and scans from Entertainment Weekly (circa Three Kings). CN also links to this site, where you can download and watch an hour-long discussion on Good Night, and Good Luck, with George Clooney, Grant Heslov and David Strathairn at NYU in December 2005.\n\nClooneyStudio has added a clip of George on Celebrity Best Friends and paparazzi pics of George out and about on his motorcycle.\n\nFinally have some time to update here :) As I'm playing catch-up with the George news, I'm only going back to June 1st.\n\nCLOONEY TO WIN CINEMATHEQUE AWARD\n\nFrom PR Inside: Academy Award winner GEORGE CLOONEY will pick up the 21st American Cinematheque Award in October (06). ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nTHE GOOD GERMAN TIDBIT\n\nFrom an article about Beau Bridges: \"Spinning Into Butter\" was just one of several projects Bridges was able to take on during his hiatus from \"Stargate SG-1.\" Another was George Clooney's \"The Good German\" feature, which \"takes place at the fall of Berlin in World War II and right after, when the U.S., Russia, England and France were occupying Germany. I play the guy who served as governor of Berlin.\"\n\nCLOONEY'S POLITICAL ROLE\n\nFrom Female First: George Clooney should play Gordon Brown in a movie about his life - according to the British politician's wife.\n\nThe chancellor - who is the frontrunner to replace British Prime Minister Tony Blair when he steps down - revealed his spouse, Sarah's, casting choice in an interview with Britain's New Woman magazine.\n\nYEN TO STAR IN SAMURAI\n\nFrom The Standard: Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen is set for a lead role in the Hollywood remake of Japanese classic The Seven Samurai, alongside George Clooney and Chinese star Zhang Ziyi, a film company said Monday. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nGEORGE CLOONEY STEALS ACTION THRILLER FROM TOM CRUISE\n\nFrom Fox News: Sources say that a hot studio property, an action thriller that Cruise desperately wanted to make in the coming year, has been taken away from him. For the first time ever, in fact, Cruise has not gotten first dibs on a Hollywood project. Instead, the movie will probably be offered to George Clooney if it hasn’t been already.\n\nCLOONEY AND PITT CLOSE DOWN LAS RAMBLAS\n\nFrom PR Inside: GEORGE CLOONEY and BRAD PITT's Las Vegas, Nevada dream is over - their ambitious Las Ramblas hotel complex is dead. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nGEORGE, NICK CLOONEY AND THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE AID STRUGGLING SUDANESE VILLAGE\n\nFrom US Newswire: In an aid project funded by George Clooney and his father Nick, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) delivered 12 tons of emergency supplies to an impoverished village in Southern Sudan hosting displaced families from Darfur and thousands of other war-impacted people. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nACTOR CLOONEY'S FATHER OPENS DARFUR EXHIBIT AT FREEDOM CENTER\n\nFrom Kentucky.com: Actor George Clooney's father, Nick, introduced an exhibit of dramatic images taken during the pair's trip to Darfur by imploring his audience to help stop the violence in the war-torn region of Sudan. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\n'SOMETIMES WE DIE': CLOONEYS LEARN FIRSTHAND OF DARFUR'S MISERIES\n\nFrom Kentucky.com: When Nick Clooney and his son, George Clooney, offered supplies to the people plagued with disease and poverty in a small village in Sudan, an elder requested plastic tarps for shelter before the rain season started. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nWARNER CLEARED BY PARIS COURT OF PLAGIARISM CLAIM ON `SYRIANA'\n\nFrom Bloomberg: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and production company Section Eight didn't plagiarize the work of French writer Stephanie Vergniault to produce the film ``Syriana,'' a Paris court ruled. ( Read more...Collapse )\n\nSPIELBERG WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A GN&GL\n\nFrom The Guardian: Spielberg praises recent lower budget releases by leading US specialty distributors like Focus Features and Fox Searchlight and the independent studio Lionsgate, adding: \"I would love to go off and make a picture like Capote or George Clooney's Good Night, and Good Luck.\"\n\nGEORGE ALMOST IN A PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION\n\nFrom an article about A Prairie Home Companion : Even the cast was ever-changing. Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson, Tom Waits, Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney were all potential participants who didn't work out for one reason or another. At one point in pre-production, the Keillor role was possibly going to be played by Clooney.\n\nAnd from a second article: \"Casting came earlier than usual. Meryl Streep was interested in the project from the very beginning. Not too surprisingly, Meryl does a really good Minnesota accent to add to her repertoire of great accents,\" says Keillor. When it came to G.K., I had intentionally written the part small - assuming I would play it. Although I thought George Clooney could also very easily have played the role.\"\n\nGEORGE EMULATING SINATRA?\n\nFrom the Huffington Post: Many actors, including George Clooney, are beginning to look like Sinatra circa 1959, when he stood up for Sammy, supported civil rights, and at the peak of his artistic powers, rallied artists to the cause of JFK. I believe we have entered a new era of activism and engagement in the entertainment industry with artists standing for good causes, studios green-lighting motion pictures about big themes and issues, and songwriters performing stories and creating new anthems for our times.\n\nFrom Brokeback Mountain to Clooney's film about Murrow to Al Gore's documentary about global warming, the revival of activism by talent is paralleled by important product touching great issues.\n\nGEORGE LUSTING AFTER BRAD\n\nFrom an honest review of O12 a review of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang : But this is a movie about the chemistry between male movie stars, in much the way that Oceans 12 was about George Clooney lusting after Brad Pitt.\n\nGEORGE MENTION\n\nFrom an article about Jason Reitman and Daniel Dubiecki: 'At film festivals, only a small number are comedies but they're always a hot ticket. The world could use more.' So are they going to be the George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh of comedy?\n\n'Good looking and genius?' he says. 'Wow. Absolutely.'\n\nGEORGE MENTION #2\n\nFrom an interview with William H Macy: \"The one thing about these award ceremonies, let's be honest, is [they're there] to sell tickets. It's all about marketing. And the actors pay the price for that. They put us in a little contest. I think George Clooney said it best: 'How are you going to decide which of these five is the best unless all of us put on a batsuit? Then you can decide.'\n\nGEORGE MENTION #3\n\nFrom an interview with Jon Tenney: The prolific actor is the veteran of eight different television series. But until now, he had not been fortunate enough to be a part of a break-out hit.\n\n\"I'm up there or maybe even tied with George Clooney before he got 'ER' \" Tenney says, laughing.\n\nRANDOM GEORGE QUOTE\n\nFrom the LA Times: In addition to drawing poor reviews and generating weak word-of-mouth, the studio's 1997 summer release \"Batman & Robin\" was criticized for having too much homoerotic appeal, including nipples on Batman's suit. George Clooney, the film's star, has joked, \"I could have played him straight but I didn't. I made him gay.\"\n\n50 WAYS TO AVOID THE WORLD CUP\n\nI think the Scots should just support England *g* From Scotsman: 31 Reclaim your TV to watch the DVD of George Clooney's Oscar-nominated Good Night, and Good Luck, released on 26 June.\n\nPOLL #1\n\nFrom Forbes: Asked which famous man they'd invite to dinner, 37 percent picked \"Tonight\" host Jay Leno. Bill Clinton placed second, trailed by George Clooney and President Bush.\n\nPOLL #2\n\nFrom NW Source: George Clooney is the man most women would like to see up close and personal, says a Lifetime Television Pulse Poll. Compared to him, younger stars aren't in the room, including Jake Gyllenhaal, Orlando Bloom and Nick Lachey.\n\nTHE CLOONEY FAN SITES\n\nSame with the news, here's what the Clooney sites have updated with in June:\n\nClooneyFan.org has added some Livejournal icons. The site also has a new pretty layout, and it seems that they’re looking for staff (in case anyone reading this in interested in helping them out :P)\n\nClooneyNetwork has added the July 2006 issue of Vanity Fair featuring an article called ‘It’s Not Easy being George’, scans of Avantoure and People, clips from Welcome to Collinwood and Bodies of Evidence, clip of Nick Clooney interviewing George and clip of George on Sexiest Southern Men. Chris is also giving away Darfur bands to anyone who would like to support the cause :)\n\nClooneyStudio has added Solaris clip (that scene), clips from ER, Murder, She Wrote and Full Tilt Boogie, deleted scene from Out of Sight and clip of Teri Hatcher talking about George.\n\nAnd it seems that IntolerableGeorge is back online but now at GeoClooney.com. :)\n\nNEW SYRIANA DVD COVER ART WORK\n\nFrom MoviesOnline: We have just received the revised cover art work for the action-drama thriller which stars Academy Award winner (Best Supporting Actor) George Clooney, Matt Damon, Jeffrey Wright and William Hurt. Warner has confirmed that it will be a single-disc only edition. It will be available in both 2.40:1 Widescreen and 1.33:1 Full Screen editions, along with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound audio tracks. Subtitles will also be provided. Extras include a 2 featurettes, deleted scenes and a conversation with George Clooney. The disc will be available to own when it hits store shelves June 20, 2006.\n\nFrom writer/director Stephen Gaghan, winner of the Best Screenplay Academy Award for Traffic, comes \"Syriana\", a political thriller that unfolds against the intrigue of the global oil industry. From the players brokering back-room deals in Washington to the men toiling in the oil fields of the Persian Gulf, the film's multiple storylines weave together to illuminate the human consequences of the fierce pursuit of wealth and power.\n\nAs a career CIA operative (George Clooney) begins to uncover the disturbing truth about the work he has devoted his life to, an up-and-coming oil broker (Matt Damon) faces an unimaginable family tragedy and finds redemption in his partnership with an idealistic Gulf prince (Alexander Siddig).\n\nA corporate lawyer (Jeffrey Wright) faces a moral dilemma as he finesses the questionable merger of two powerful U.S. oil companies, while across the globe, a disenfranchised Pakistani teenager (Mazhar Munir) falls prey to the recruiting efforts of a charismatic cleric.\n\nEach plays their small part in the vast and complex system that powers the industry, unaware of the explosive impact their lives will have upon the world.\n\nDVD Details:\n\n2.40:1 Widescreen and 1.33:1 Fullscreen\n\nEnglish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound\n\nEnglish, French and Spanish Subtitles\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nMake a Change featurette\n\nMake a Difference featurette\n\nConversation with George Clooney\n\nRevised Artwork\n\nLIE BACK AND THINK OF GEORGE\n\nFrom Wigan News: NURSES have put posters of Brad Pitt and George Clooney on the ceiling of a hospital examination room to help women relax during gynaecological check-ups!\n\nStaff at Leigh Infirmary hope the film star heart-throbs will help patients' minds wander while medical procedures are carried out.\n\nThey can also daydream about football hunk David Beckham and actor Jesse Metcalfe, who plays the gardener in TV's Desperate Housewives.\n\nThe posters have been pinned to the ceiling in an examination room on Ward 2, the hospital's gynaecology day surgery and outpatients unit.\n\nA Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Trust spokesman said: \"The posters are in the coloscopy clinic where ladies go for examinations.\n\n\"Patients can be lying on their backs for up to 15 minutes while procedures are carried out.\n\n\"The posters were suggested by Rachel Lowe, a staff nurse on Ward Two.\n\n\"She thought it would be nice to give patients something to look at other than the ceiling tiles.\n\n\"She mentioned it to her ward manager, Julie Cook, and with the help of other staff members they have made a collage of pictures.\n\n\"There used to be a poster of a polar bear skidding in the snow on the ceiling, but then they asked patients for suggestions and they said they would like to see pictures of men up there.\"\n\nOne woman attending the ward as a day patient said: \"The pictures are a great idea.\n\n\"They are something pleasant to look at while you're lying there. It's a nice distraction.\"\n\nThe collage also features pictures of idyllic tropical beach scenes, dolphins and puppies.\n\nA photo is here. :)\n\nTHE CLOONEY FAN SITES\n\nClooneyNetwork has added some video clips of George on the 1992 TV show, Bodies of Evidence.\n\nClooneyStudio has added a video clip of George promoting The Peacemaker on MovieWatch.\n\nGEORGE MENTION\n\nFrom FT.com: Celebrity has ever depended on fame, often on wealth, sometimes on beauty, and more recently, public relations has added goodness. Look at the cover of the latest issue of Vanity Fair, on which the film stars George Clooney and Julia Roberts combine with the former US vice president Al Gore to endorse the goal of saving the world from destruction. The linking of fame with the avoidance of annihilation is a terrific idea, both for humanity and the box office. Thus do morality and moolah combine, perhaps for the good of us all. If Julia Roberts looking moody can shift you from a four-litre 4x4 to a bicycle, here’s to moody.\n\nGEORGE MENTION # 2\n\nFrom The Telegraph Online: And let’s not forget perhaps the greatest tress travesty of the 20th century – when George Clooney unveiled the Caesar ’do on “ER.”\n\nGEORGE MENTION # 3\n\nFrom an article about Sarah Jessica Parker, talking about how people confuse her with her Sex & the City character:\n\n\"I have to remind them that I don't have a PhD in sex or counselling. I'm an actress. \"I wonder if George Clooney is better prepared to talk about surgeries because of ER? No!\" she added.\n\nGEORGE MENTION # 4\n\n( Under a cut because it's about every girl's favourite toy, and I'm unsure of the ages of the people who may read this :PCollapse )\n\nSCOTTISH WOMEN WANT FREE TIME, NOT GEORGE\n\nFrom Edinburgh News: A new survey has revealed that time-starved Scotswomen would rather have another 60 minutes every day than drop a dress size, while a quarter would rather have more free time than spend a night with heart-throb George Clooney. All women want is simply more time to themselves.\n\nMANLINESS AUTHOR ON GEORGE\n\nFrom an interview with Harvey Mansfield, author of 'Manliness' a book that \"looks at gender differences and the importance of manliness in politics and other areas of society\":\n\nYou mentioned Clint Eastwood earlier as a kind of epitome of manliness. Who else would you put in that category?\n\nIn my book I certainly refer constantly to John Wayne. But of the current people I know of, Brad Pitt, maybe, some say George Clooney, though some say he’s not manly.\n\nCAMELOT RECREATE VANITY FAIR SHOT\n\nThis isn't really George news as such, but Camelot (the company that run the National Lottery in the UK) have recreated the recent Vanity Fair cover image that featured George:\n\nNational Lottery operator Camelot’s own Green Team decided to emulate the cover, shot by iconic photographer Annie Leibovitz, to highlight the company’s own environmental achievements.\n\nAnd here's Camelot's creation, with the actual VF one on the right:\n\nTHE CLOONEY FAN SITES\n\nClooneyFan.org has added various photos of George at premieres and functions in 2002 - 2003.\n\nClooneyNetwork has added various photos of George filming and out-and-about, and clips from the recent entertainment shows.\n\nClooneyStudio has added more Nespresso photos, scans from OK, and a video clip of George's appearance on Larry King Live in 1997.\n\nUK RELEASE DATES\n\nA couple of UK release dates have been changed/announced:\n\nOcean's Thirteen is set to be released in the UK on June 8, 2007, which is the same date as the US release. So, at the moment, unlike with O11 & O12, there's no 2/3 month delay for Brits!\n\nHowever it seems that the UK release date of The Good German may have changed. It's no longer listed as a November release and no new release date has been added for it at the moment.\n\nSACHA BARON COHEN FOR O13?\n\nThe Ocean's Thirteen casting rumours continue. This time, it's Ali G, Celine Dion and Barry Manilow! From Cinematical.com:\n\nWho knew George Clooney was such a big Ali G fan? Apparently, the Good Night, and Good Luck director is so into the British comedian, he wrote a part in Ocean's Thirteen specifically for him. With Talladega Nights due out this summer, Ali G (or Sacha Baron Cohen) is beginning to show signs he's ready to roll with the big boys.\n\nNow that we're just three months away from the start of production, casting for Danny Ocean's third trip to the big screen is really starting to heat up. Recently, after news broke that neither Julia Roberts nor Catherine Zeta-Jones were returning, everyone from Jennifer Lopez to Angelina Jolie are rumored to be interested in a role. Clooney admitted to Sky News that he's a big fan of Cohen's work and that, if he decides to get down with the role, he'd be playing an \"oddball character.\" Oh, and the rest of Ocean's crew are just so normal, right?\n\nIn related news, singers Barry Manilow and Céline Dion are also in talks for roles in the film. If that's the case, then this means part of the plot will probably surround a Dion/Manilow concert. Wicked! Ocean's Thirteen is going to totally rock out. I'd say yes to Ali G playing an oddball character. Manilow and Dion? Um, not so much.\n\nOUT OF SIGHT (COLLECTOR'S EDITION) RELEASED ON DVD\n\nFrom Nashville City Paper:\n\nDVD of the week\n\nSteven Soderbergh didn’t get big box office numbers from his 1998 film Out of Sight, but this still ranks among the finest cinematic adaptations of any Elmore Leonard novel.\n\nIt had one of George Clooney’s best portrayals to date as bank robber Jack Foley, who used another inmate’s prison-break to cover his own escape. It also marked the initial appearance of the character federal agent Karen Sisco (played in the film by Jennifer Lopez), later the subject of a short-lived ABC television show. It even had inspired cameos from Michael Keaton (reprising a role from Jackie Brown) and Samuel L. Jackson, plus longer contributions from Ving Rhames, Albert Brooks, Don Cheadle and Dennis Farina.\n\nThis week, Out Of Sight (Collector’s Edition) (MCA) will be released, with some previously deleted scenes, multiple commentaries and production photographs that weren’t available in the previous DVD version.\n\nDUBAI CENSORS SYRIANA\n\n( Read more...Collapse )\n\nRANDE GERBER ON LAS RAMBLAS\n\nIn the March 2006 issue of W magazine, there was an interview with Rande Gerber. He talks about Las Ramblas and George and a PDF of the interview and photos is available here at the official Las Ramblas site.\n\nTHE CLOONEY FAN SITES\n\nClooneyFan.org has added photos of George at the MTV Movie Awards (1995 & 2000), Fire and Ice Ball (1996), Batman & Robin premiere (1997), Rebound premiere (1996), Ocean's Eleven premiere (2001), and MTV's Rock and Jock Baseball (1995). The site also has a new, pretty layout up.\n\nNot a Clooney fan site as such, but the website InterviewsRUs.com has a few George video clips. They have clips of George on The Today Show (Oct 2005), Letterman (Nov 2005), The Early Show (Dec 2005) and Leno (Dec 2005). Thanks Zosia!"
