        "text": "Tom Duggan, the man behind the counter at Lemon Gem Kitchen Goods in St. Louis, Mo., was so talkative that I couldn’t help but stay and chat. He was filling in for his daughter, the shop’s owner, Beth Styles. I asked him what he liked about St. Louis and he said he once had a job that entailed a lot of travel, and that he always liked coming home. “It’s a great place to raise a family, the schools in the county are good, and the real estate is reasonable,” he said. “It’s a big small town.”\n\nThis isn’t mere aw-shucks sentiment — as someone who grew up in Illinois, I can attest to the fundamental, if understated, truth of what Mr. Duggan said. St. Louis has all you could want in a city — museums, green spaces, good music and exciting new restaurants — plus that distinct Midwestern sense that if you stop random people on the street, there’s a very good chance they grew up nearby and are excited to share the name of their favorite bar with you. It also happened to be a good fit for my modest budget, making it an ideal place to spend four days this past month.\n\nMy Airbnb in the Central West End neighborhood ($65 per night for a private room in a resident’s house), about 4 miles west of downtown, centrally located and close to the Metro, made for a good home base. I also spent a night in downtown proper at the Magnolia Hotel St. Louis, where I landed a AAA rate of $125 per night. It was easy to get out to Central West End from downtown, about a 15 minute ride, on my $7.50 Metro day-pass. I also used the Transit app, which works in over 100 cities, to make my riding as efficient as I could.\n\nI spent a day walking around downtown, and had my first encounter with a helpful local at Star Clipper, a sanctuary for all who love things comics- and fantasy-related. A relative neophyte, I asked one of the managers for help. Celeste, with silver hair peeking out from under a Darth Vader knit cap, was more than happy to assist. I asked her for something a little out there; a little weird. Her face lit up, “So … how weird do we want to get?” she asked before directing me to work by St. Louis-native Jim Mahfood.\n\nMaybe I had comics on the brain this particular trip, because I headed to the Moolah Theater & Lounge for a Wednesday evening showing of “Black Panther.” Admission on Wacky Wednesday, as it’s called, is just $5, a great deal for a first-run movie in a beautiful old theater like the Moolah. The building, originally constructed for the Shriners in 1913, has wonderful architectural details like a massive barrel-vaulted ceiling in the middle of the theater, as well as some comfy couches for those quick enough to grab them. The attached bar in the theater, in addition to serving $2 Busch beer, had some themed drink specials: The King T’Challa, for example, got you a draft beer with a shot of Crown Royal for $10.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
