Figuarts\n\nBandai\n\nDigimon (デジモン Dejimon, branded as Digimon: Digital Monsters, stylized as DIGIMON), short for \"Digital Monsters\" (デジタルモンスター Dejitaru Monsutā), is a Japanese media franchise encompassing virtual pet toys, anime, manga, video games, films and a trading card game. The franchise focuses on the eponymous creatures, who inhabit a \"Digital World\", a parallel universe that originated from Earth's various communication networks.\n\nThe franchise was created in 1997 as a series of virtual pets, akin to—and influenced in style by—the contemporary Tamagotchi or nano Giga Pet toys. The creatures were first designed to look cute and iconic even on the devices' small screens; later developments had them created with a harder-edged style influenced by American comics. The franchise gained momentum with its first anime incarnation, Digimon Adventure, and an early video game, Digimon World, both released in 1999. Several anime series and films based on them have been released, and the video game series has expanded into genres such as role-playing, racing, fighting, and MMORPGs.\n\nConception and creation[]\n\nSee also: Digital Monster (virtual pet)\n\nIn 1996, the Tamagotchi was released, created by Akihiro Yokoi, Aki Maita and Takeichi Hongo. The Tamagotchi was one of the inspirations for the first release of the Digimon franchise,[3][4] a device marketed in June 1997[1][5] with the name Digimon,[6] short for Digital Monster.[7][8] Aiming at the male audience and created by Akiyoshi Hongo (a pseudonym that refers to the creators of Tamagotchi),[3] this device shows to players a virtual pet composed entirely of data and designed to play and fight.[1][6][9][10] In February 1998, the DigiMon fighting game, compatible with Windows 95 and developed by Rapture Technologies, Inc., was announced.[11] The one-shot manga C'mon Digimon, designed by Tenya Yabuno, was published in the Japanese magazine V-Jump by Shueisha in 1997.[12][13]\n\nA second generation of virtual pets was marketed six months after the launch of the first, followed by a third in 1998.[14] Each player starts with a baby-level digital creature that has a limited number of attacks and transformations[15] and to make the creature stronger by training and nourishing the creature;[1][6] when the player is successful in a workout, the Digimon becomes strong, when the player fails, the Digimon becomes weak.[1][6] Two devices can be connected, allowing two players to battle with their respective creatures, an innovation at the time,[1] however, the battle is only possible from the moment the creature is in the child level or bigger.[1] Playgrounds and subways were where the majority of users of the apparatus were concentrated; The virtual pet was banned in some Asian schools by being considered by parents and teachers as very noisy and violent.[16] The first Digimon were created by Japanese designer Kenji Watanabe, influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and \"cool.\" Other types of Digimon, which until the year 2000 totaled 279,[17][18] came from extensive discussions and collaborations between the Bandai company members.[19]\n\nEponymous creatures[]\n\nTemplate:Multiple issues Digimon hatch from types of eggs which are called Digi-Eggs (デジタマ, Dejitama). In the English iterations of the franchise there is another type of Digi-Egg that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a Digimental (デジメンタル, Dejimentaru) in Japanese. They age via a process called \"Digivolution\" which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, are capable of intelligence and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. There are currently over 1400 Digimon.\n\nAnime[]\n\nTelevision series[]\n\nThe Digimon anime series was produced by Toei Animation and Bandai of Japan. Beginning in 1999, an anime series was green-lit as the first of the Digimon films aired in theaters. Originally, Digimon Adventure was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for the film to become a children's television series was made.[citation needed] Several anime series have since been produced, with the first six series localized into English for release in Western markets.\n\nOverview[]\n\nNo. Title Episodes Originally aired Network First aired Last aired 1 Digimon Adventure 54 March 7, 1999 ( ) March 26, 2000 (2000-03-26) Fuji TV 2 Digimon Adventure 02 50 April 2, 2000 ( ) March 25, 2001 (2001-03-25) Fuji TV 3 Digimon Tamers 51 April 1, 2001 ( ) March 31, 2002 (2002-03-31) Fuji TV 4 Digimon Frontier 50 April 7, 2002 ( ) March 30, 2003 (2003-03-30) Fuji TV 5 Digimon Data Squad 48 February 4, 2006 ( ) March 25, 2007 (2007-03-25) Fuji TV 6 Digimon Fusion 79 July 6, 2010 ( ) March 25, 2012 (2012-03-25) TV Asahi 7 Digimon Universe: App Monsters 52 October 1, 2016 ( ) September 30, 2017 (2017-09-30) TV Tokyo Total 384 episodes 1999 present\n\nFilms[]\n\nSeveral Digimon featurette films were released in Japan, with some of them seasonal tie-ins for their respective television series.\n\nDigimon Adventure / Digimon: The Movie (1999)\n\nDigimon Adventure: Children's War Game! / Digimon: The Movie (2000)\n\nDigimon Adventure 02: Part 1: Digimon Hurricane Touchdown!! / Part 2: Supreme Evolution!!

An English-language adaptation of the series produced by Saban Entertainment (later Sensation Animation), the series was broadcast on Fox Kids. Saban would dub the first four anime series in the franchise, which were collectively retitled Digimon: Digital Monsters.[22] Some scenes from the original version were modified or omitted in order to comply with Fox's standards and practices. The show also featured more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score. As a cross-promotional stunt, 2001 and 2002 saw Digi-Bowl specials co-produced with Fox Sports; NFL on Fox commentator Terry Bradshaw provided interstitial segments in-between episodes as if the episodes were actually a football game.[23]\n\nThe Walt Disney Company would acquire Saban during the third series, Digimon Tamers. Reruns of the first three series began airing on the cable network ABC Family, while the fourth series, Digimon Frontier, premiered on UPN as part of a deal between Disney and UPN.[24] UPN aired the series until late August 2003, when they severed their ties to Disney.[24] Frontier aired on ABC Family concurrently, and also aired in reruns on Toon Disney under the Jetix branding.\n\nAn English version of Digimon Data Squad, produced by Studiopolis, would premiere October 1, 2007, on Toon Disney. In September 2012, Saban Brands, a successor to Saban Entertainment, announced it had acquired the Digimon anime franchise.[25][26][27] Saban would announce that they would be producing an English dub for Digimon Xros Wars, retitled Digimon Fusion, for broadcast on Nickelodeon in the United States starting September 7, 2013.[28] After three episodes, the show was moved to Nicktoons starting October 13, 2013.\n\nPreviously, Funimation Entertainment had online streaming rights to subtitled versions of Digimon Adventure 02 and Digimon Tamers.[citation needed] Digimon Adventure, Adventure 02, and Tamers, would later begin streaming on Netflix in 2013 and 2014 with Japanese audio and English subtitles.[citation needed] Crunchyroll began streaming the English-subtitled version of Digimon Fusion outside Japan in November 2011. The English-localized version of its first season became available on Netflix starting September 13, 2014, with the second season arriving on March 8, 2016.[29] After Crunchyroll acquired streaming rights to the dubbed versions and Funimation acquired rights to the subtitled versions, the dubbed versions of Adventure, Adventure 02, and Tamers were briefly removed from Netflix.[citation needed]\n\nInternational[]\n\nIn Canada, the English versions of Digimon were broadcast on YTV, with the exception of Data Squad, which aired in Family Channel's Jetix block. YTV would eventually acquire Digimon Fusion, but only the first 26 episodes were shown.[citation needed]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Digimon first aired on Fox Kids. ITV's children's slot CITV would broadcast Adventure, Adventure 02 and several episodes of Tamers during after school hours from 2001–2002. The rest of Tamers aired on Fox Kids from 2002–04.[citation needed] Digimon Frontier was originally announced to be broadcast on Jetix, but the series was later dropped.[citation needed] The series eventually saw a release on October 29, 2018.[30] From 2011, Digimon Data Squad airs on Kix!. According to Fox Kids' (2000–03) and Kix's (2010–) BARB Television ratings, Adventure, Adventure 02 & Tamers have been the most popular series'/seasons in the United Kingdom and was consistently in the weekly top 10 broadcasts for both channels for new episodes.[31] Broadcast rights and merchandising sub-licensing rights for Digimon Fusion in the UK have been acquired by ITV Studios Global Entertainment. Digimon Fusion has aired since Spring 2014 on digital terrestrial channel, CITV.[32][33]\n\nManga[]\n\nDigimon first appeared in narrative form in the one-shot manga C'mon Digimon, released in the summer of 1997. C'mon Digimon spawned the popular Digimon Adventure V-Tamer 01 manga, written by Hiroshi Izawa, which began serialization on November 21, 1998.\n\nDigimon Adventure V-Tamer 01\n\nDigimon Chronicle\n\nDigimon Next\n\nDigimon Xros Wars\n\nDigimon World Re:Digitize\n\nDigimon World Re:Digitize Decode\n\nDigimon Story: Cyber Sleuth\n\nDigimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker's Memory\n\nDigimon Chronicle X\n\nYuen Wong Yu manhua[]\n\nA Chinese manhua was written and drawn by Yuen Wong Yu (余 遠鍠 Yu Yuen-wong), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers Digimon Adventure in five volumes, Digimon Adventure 02 in two, Digimon Tamers in four, and Digimon Frontier in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently from the anime. The Chinese language version was published by Rightman Publishing Ltd. in Hong Kong. Yu also wrote D-Cyber.\n\nTwo English versions were also released. The first one was published by Chuang Yi in Singapore. The second one, which was adapted by Lianne Sentar,[34] was released by TOKYOPOP in North America.\n\nThe three volumes for Digimon Frontier have been released by Chuang Yi in English. These have not been released by TOKYOPOP in North America or Europe. However, the Chuang Yi releases of Digimon Frontier were distributed by Madman Entertainment in Australia.\n\nDark Horse[]\n\nMain article: Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)\n\nDark Horse Comics published American-style Digimon comic books, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English dub of Digimon Adventure in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.[35]\n\nPanini[]\n\nThe Italian publishing company, Panini, approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the United Kingdom (UK) reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of Adventure 02 episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official Digimon Magazine and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, Wickid. These original stories only roughly followed the continuity of Adventure 02. When the comic switched to the Tamers series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as Mitsuo Yamaki's past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from Digimon Magazine, which returned to printing translated German adaptations of Tamers episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.\n\nVideo games[]\n\nThe Digimon series has a large number of video games which usually have their own independent storylines with a few sometimes tying into the stories of the anime series or manga series. The games consists of a number of genres including life simulation, adventure, video card game, strategy and racing games, though they are mainly action role-playing games.\n\nIn late 2009, Bandai created a webpage in Japanese showing a new game to be released in 2010 called Digimon Story: Lost Evolution, which uses the same engine as their predecessors Digimon World DS and Digimon World Dawn and Dusk and was released on July 1, 2010. In February 2010, a website for the online multiplayer game, Digimon Battle Online, was launched, showing it to be based primarily in the world of the Tamers saga and its characters.[36]\n\nOn September 22, 2011, online game publisher Joymax announced the release of an MMORPG game called Digimon Masters, which was developed by the Korean publisher DIGITALIC.[37]\n\nIn 2011, Bandai posted a countdown on a teaser site. Once the countdown was finished, it revealed a reboot of the Digimon World series titled Digimon World Re:Digitize.[38] An enhanced version of the game released on Nintendo 3DS as Digimon World Re:Digitize Decode in 2013.[39]\n\nA new fighting game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was revealed in the summer of 2014, named Digimon All-Star Rumble. It was released in North America, Europe and Australia in November of the same year.[40] Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth, a role-playing game in the Digimon Story sub-series, was released in 2015 for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 in Japan.[41] It has also been released with English subtitles in North America and the rest of the world in 2016.\n\nCard game[]\n\nThe Digimon Collectible Card Game is a card game based on Digimon, first introduced in Japan in 1997 and published by Bandai. The third season (Digimon Tamers) utilized this aspect of the franchise by making the card game an integral part of the season. Versions of the card game are also included in some of the Digimon video games including Digital Card Battle and Digimon World 3.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nPage Module:Side box/styles.css has no content.\n\nOfficial website\n\nDigimonFusion, outside-of-Asia series\n\nDigimon Print Adventure V-Tamer 01 • D-Cyber • Next Television series Adventure (episodes) • Adventure 02 (episodes) • Tamers (episodes) • Frontier (episodes) • Data Squad (episodes) • Fusion (episodes (season 1 • 2 • 3)) • App Monsters (episodes) Films Digimon: The Movie • Digimon Adventure tri. • Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna Video games World series World • 2 • 3 • 4 • Re:Digitize • Next Order Story series DS • Dawn & Dusk • Lost Evolution • Cyber Sleuth (Hacker's Memory) Fighting games Battle Spirit (1.5 • 2) • Rumble Arena (2) • All-Star Rumble MMOs Battle Online • Masters Others Anode/Cathode Tamer • Digital Card Battle • Racing • Data Squad • Championship • Adventure • Survive Characters Digimon Adventure/Digimon Adventure 02/Digimon Adventure tri.
