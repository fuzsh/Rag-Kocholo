        "text": "Post by Baker on\n\nI'm in one of my moods so let's keep this going.\n\n2000 RSPW Award Ballot\n\n*This is probably how I voted.\n\nBest Wrestler\n\n*Basically an MVP award rather than \"Best Worker.\"\n\n1. HHH (#1)\n\n2. Rock (#4)\n\n3. Kurt Angle (#3)\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n1. Edge & Christian (#1)\n\n2. Hardy Boyz (#2)\n\n3. Dudley Boyz (#3)\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. HHH (#1)\n\n2. Kurt Angle (#2)\n\n3. Steve Corino (#10)- Unless Corino's face turn cost him on my ballot. In which case I'd have had...\n\n3. Steven Richards (#7)\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Mick Foley (#2)\n\n2. Tommy Dreamer (#13)\n\n3. The Rock (#1)\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. HHH (#2)\n\n2. Tajiri (#4)\n\n3. Chris Benoit (#1)- Grudging respect\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. Jeff Hardy (#1)\n\n2. Rob Van Dam (#9)\n\n3. Super Crazy (#2)\n\nBest Technical Wrestler\n\nN/A\n\n*I find technical wrestling to be a vague, almost meaningless concept. I'm in the camp that it's the wrestling version of the Supreme Court's \"I'll know it when I see it\" definition of porn. With that being said, \"technical wrestling\" as I perceive it was almost dead in 2000, with the only real 'technical match I can think of off the top of my head being HHH/Benoit at No Mercy. So I guess technically (hehe) Benoit & HHH should take #1 & #2 here in that order, but is just one match really award worthy for an entire concept? I think not.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n2. HHH (#2)\n\n3. Bradshaw (#20something)/APA\n\nMost Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Kurt Angle (#4)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#6) It was a great two months.\n\n3. HHH (#1)\n\nEDIT: Since I went hog wild on every other year.....\n\n4. Edge & Christian (#10 Edge/#15 Christian)\n\n5. Steve Corino\n\n6. Jeff Jarrett (#18)- I watched one WCW show in 2000 (a May Nitro) so Jarrett qualifies. Plus I rooted hard for him from afar.\n\n7. Tazz (#16)\n\n8. Hardy Boyz (#14 Jeff)\n\n9. Dudley Boyz\n\n10. APA\n\n11. RVD\n\n12. Lana Star\n\n13. Steven Richards\n\n14. Undertaker (#17)\n\n15. Too Cool\n\n16. William Regal (#12)\n\n17. The Rock (#5)\n\n18. Raven\n\n19. Tommy Dreamer\n\n20. Tajiri (#7)\n\n21. Rikishi\n\n22. Christopher Daniels\n\n23. Patti Pizzazz\n\n24. Sandman\n\n25. Hardcore Holly\n\nMost Improved Wrestler\n\n1. HHH (#1)- Transformed from an overrated hack into the 2nd coming of Ric Flair in the span of a few short months.\n\n2. Steve Corino (#10)- Went from a(n awesome) joke to a main eventer in the blink of an eye. Somehow made it work.\n\n3. Rikishi (#6)- Unless he lost enough points with the heel turn to take him out of my Top 3, which is very possible.\n\nMost Overrated Wrestler\n\n*2000 me thought this meant overrated by (internet) fans rather than overpushed.\n\n1. Eddie Guerrero (like #50something)\n\n2. Chris Jericho (#13)\n\n3. Chris Benoit (#20something)\n\n*I grew to accept Jericho & Benoit as the year went on (mostly thanks to HHH) but I still thought their matches were overrated by at least 1/2* on average while I was very disappointed by/didn't \"get\" Eddie at all.\n\nMost Overpushed Wrestler\n\n1. Justin Credible\n\n2. Rhino\n\n3. Crash Holly\n\n*ECW shoving Credible & Rhino down my throat is a big reason why I went off the promotion, while Crash Holly's totally unfunny 'comedic' brand of hardcore wrestling was my least favorite thing in the otherwise awesome world of 2000 WWF.\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. Kurt Angle: Olympic Dork (#2)\n\n2. Edge & Christian: Dorky teen idols (#1)\n\n3. Acolyte Protection Agency (#4)\n\n*Not sure about #3 since it appears I didn't vote for Lana Could easily have been RTC, Corino, Too Cool + Rikishi, or HHH: Best Wrestler In The World here.\n\n*EDIT- The RSPW year ended November 1st. Peak Lana was November-December. So using a proper calendar....\n\n3. LANA STAR!\n\nBest Wrestling Move\n\n1. Dean Malenko's Super Implant DDT (#11)\n\n2. Rob Van Dam's Van Terminator (#6)\n\n3. Either HHH's Pedigree (#4) or the Dudleys 3D (#3)\n\nBest Match\n\n1. HHH vs. Cactus Jack- Royal Rumble (#2)\n\n2. HHH vs. Cactus Jack- No Way Out (#3)\n\n3. Edge & Christian vs. Hardys vs. Dudleys- Wrestlemania (#5)\n\n*Super confident about this one.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. HHH vs. Cactus Jack (#1)\n\n2. HHH vs. Rock (#4)\n\n3. Hardys vs. Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz (#3)\n\nMost Underrated Wrestler\n\n*Assuming 2000 me knew this meant underpushed rather than underrated by (internet) fans.\n\n1. Taz (#20)\n\n2. Tazz\n\n3. Tazzz\n\nWorst Wrestler/Worst Worker\n\n*Don't know what the difference is between the two and I'm too lazy to look it up now.\n\nI dunno. Mideon at #1 is always a safe bet. Bulldog, Bossman, Godfather, Henry, Viscera & Road Dogg are other possibilities here.\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\nLikely some combination of Bossman/Buchanan, Head Cheese & Mideon/Viscera. Goodfather & Bull also have an outside shot.\n\nWorst Heel\n\nRoad Dogg (#3) & Rikishi (#11) have to be #1 & #2.\n\nWorst Babyface\n\nProbably Austin (#20something) since he was a face who acted like a heel.....yet still got cheered for it. Look, I didn't really \"get\" Stone Cold, ok?\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n*I triple checked. For some reason I did not have Crash Holly (my assumed #1) here. I'm starting to wonder whether I voted at all in this. So....\n\n1. Justin Credible (#14)\n\n2. Eddie Guerrero\n\n3. Chris Jericho\n\n*This is a total guess. X Pac, Road Dogg, Viscera, Henry, Bossman, Mideon, Awesome, Blackman, Chyna, and probably a few others could just as easily have been here. I didn't watch WCW, so I can't imagine voting for Hogan, Nash, Goldberg, etc. But who knows? Without Crash Holly here anything is possible. For real though....\n\n1. Crash Holly- Everything else is just noise.\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. Al Snow (like #50something)\n\n2. Undertaker (#1)- It was sad to see the once-great Undertaker wheeze his way around the ring in dud after dud.\n\n3. Kane- Was actually good from 97-99. I will argue this until I'm blue in the face. But he sucked in 2000, and has continued to do so ever since.\n\n*Eddie, Malenko, Saturn, Taz & Raven are other possibilities here.\n\nWorst Gimmick\n\n1. Mae Young gets pregnant, gives birth to a hand (#2)\n\n2. Naked Mideon (#6)\n\n*For some strange reason I did not vote for Crash Holly: Killer of all things Hardcore. So...umm....\n\n3. Either Eddie Guerrero: Latino Heat (#20something) or ECW's Network (like #50something)\n\n*Getting bored with this now. Skipping a few of these \"worst\" categories.\n\nWorst Match\n\n1. Pat Patterson vs. Gerald Brisco- KOTR (#1)\n\n2. William Regal vs. Naked Mideon- No Mercy (#16)\n\nWorst Wrestling Move\n\n1. Scotty Too Hotty's Worm (#1)\n\n2. Rock's People's Elbow (#2)\n\n3. Rikishi's Stinkface (#4)\n\n*These were cute once upon a time but they became played out/embarrassing as time marched on.\n\nWorst Feud\n\n1. ECW vs. The Network (#16)\n\nMost Disappointing News Item\n\n1. ECW taken off TNN (#5)\n\n2. Mike Awesome jumps to WCW while ECW Champion (#14)\n\n3. Mick Foley loses to HHH, is forced to retire (#7)\n\n*Apparently I did not vote for \"WWF misuses Tazz\" here.\n\nMost Obnoxious Personality\n\nI dunno. Pick 3 from Eddie, Jericho, Crash, X Pac, Road Dogg, Credible.\n\nBest Second\n\n1. Steven Richards (#4)\n\n2. Lita (#2)\n\n3. Cyrus (#8)\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Joey Styles (#2)\n\n*Apparently I did not vote for Lee Marshall at #3. How sad.\n\nBest Color Commentator\n\n1. Jerry Lawler (#1)\n\n*Maybe I voted for Cyrus (#6) and/or Joel Gertner (#7)....but I probably didn't.\n\nBest Interviewee\n\n1. Mick Foley (#3)\n\n2. Kurt Angle (#4)\n\n3. Steve Corino (#10)\n\n*Rock & HHH did a double turn in my head midway through the year. I just grew tired of Rocky's shtick that summer while starting to love HHH after years of being a HHHater. Hence Rock's lack of inclusion on this list. Edge & Christian and Steven Richards were also painful cuts.\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. ECW (#2)\n\n3. WOW (#8)\n\n*But I probably only voted for WWF at #1. And if not, there's a chance I would have flip flopped ECW & WOW just because I was hating on ECW at the time.\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Raw (#1)\n\n2. Smackdown (#2)\n\n3. WOW (#13)\n\n*Since I was going off Jakked, and down on ECW, I probably (would have) went with WOW at #3 just for shits and giggles/an FU to ECW.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n1. Royal Rumble (#1)\n\n2. Summerslam (#2)\n\n3. Backlash (#4)\n\nBest Promotional Move\n\n*Again, something I feel like I would have voted for, \"HHH defeats WCW & ECW World Champions\" doesn't appear on the list. So...\n\n1. WWF signs the Radicalz (#1)\n\n2. WWF pushes Kurt Angle to the championship (#4)\n\nWorst Organization\n\n1. WCW (#1)- Just because\n\n2. WXO (#6)\n\n*And maybe I'm cheeky enough to put ECW (#4) at #3.\n\n*Bored. Skipping the rest. That was fun....until it wasn't. Maybe I'll do another one tomorrow.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\nAs if I could possibly resist the temptation to do a masturbatory project about My Favorite Wrestling.\n\n1995\n\n*I didn't vote in any Year End Awards this year because I did not yet know such a thing existed. But this is how I think I would have voted in the RSPW Awards. Keep in mind the only promotions I watched this year were WWF, WCW and AWF. NO ECW. And a proper year goes from January 1 to December 31st. None of that November/December cutoff nonsense. Without further ado...\n\n{Spoiler}\n\n*I can only find info on the Top 5 vote getters for this year and can't imagine many of choices placing in their Top 5.\n\n*Skipping a few I don't/wouldn't have had strong opinions on.\n\nBest Wrestler/MVP Award\n\n1. Diesel\n\n2. Hulk Hogan\n\n3. Bret Hart (#3)\n\n*Ugh! But I was still marky enough to where I thought World Champion=Best for a category like this.\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n1. Smoking Gunns (#4)\n\n2. Harlem Heat (#2)\n\n3. Owen Hart & Yokozuna (#5 North American)\n\n*Again, belts=best to 1995 Baker. So no Blue Bloods, Sid & Kid, or Horowitz/Hakushi.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Goldust\n\n2. Owen Hart\n\n3. Dean Douglas\n\n*I witnessed Goldust get the hate first hand live at Survivor Series '95. No way anybody else could top him after being in the building for that. Owen concussed Michaels and bragged about it. The Dean was a fabulous shit stirrer. Honorable mention to perennial top bad guy Jerry Lawler.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Barry Horowitz\n\n2. Undertaker\n\n3. Henry O. Godwinn\n\n*I'd have been arrogant enough to put my own personal tastes over that of the masses. These were the 3 babyfaces I was most into in '95 with Hakushi in the Honorable Mention slot.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. Bret Hart\n\n3. Shawn Michaels (#1)\n\n*Easily the most iffy one so far. Owen > Bret was one of my big talking points back in the day so I'm sure I'd have put Owen first just to sell the gimmick/be a dick. Commentary and the mags told me Bret & Shawn were great pure wrestlers so they probably get #2 & #3 over \"new style\" darlings like Benoit, Eddie, Malenko, Hakushi & Jean Pierre Lafitte. Bret & Shawn being top guys would also help them over those midcarders due to perception.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. Hakushi (#4)\n\n2. Owen Hart\n\n3. Jean Pierre Lafitte\n\n*Hakushi was the top daredevil in mainstream US wrestling. Owen didn't have the flips but nobody was smoother in the air. JPL was an awesome husky high flyer. Honorable mention to Eddie.\n\nBest Technical Wrestler\n\n1. Owen Hart (#5)\n\n2. Chris Benoit (#3)\n\n3. Bret Hart (#2)\n\n*OK, so Owen > Bret wasn't COMPLETELY a gimmick. I genuinely did prefer watching him in the ring. Benoit was more \"technical\" while Eddie was more of a \"flyer,\" and I'm honestly not sure whether I had seen Malenko yet. Don't remember him wrestling much on the WCW shows I watched in late '95. Deano owns this in '96 though.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Razor Ramon\n\n2. Undertaker\n\n3. Diesel\n\n*Total guess. I just looked at these guys as \"brawlers,\" and they were successful, so I probably would have had them here. And even back then I realized the greatness of Razor's awesome punches.\n\nMost Favourite Wrestler\n\n1. Goldust\n\n2. Owen Hart\n\n3. Jeff Jarrett\n\n*My favorite category. This and MOTY always seem to be the ones I remember the best. Goldust was my man from his very first vignette. Dude was something else. JJ was my fave during the first half of the year and his IYH December comeback solidifies his spot on the list. Owen was always quality and he was back up to 1994 levels by the end of the year due to concussing Michaels.\n\n*I'm feeling frisky. Let's go for a Top 10.\n\n4. Barry Horowitz\n\n5. Dean Douglas\n\n6. Jean Pierre Lafitte\n\n7. Mr. Wonderful\n\n8. Blue Bloods\n\n9. Jerry Lawler\n\n10. Ric Flair\n\n*Probably the deepest/strongest year ever for Favorites. And it doesn't end with the Top 10. The guys in the 11-20 slots would all be 3-5 spots higher in a normal year. And because I'm an absolute madman....\n\n11. Hunter Hearst Helmsley\n\n12. Yokozuna\n\n13. Undertaker\n\n14. British Bulldog\n\n15. Disco Inferno\n\n16. Chris Benoit\n\n17. Hakushi\n\n18. Sid & The Kid\n\n19. Henry O. Godwinn\n\n20. Arn Anderson\n\n21. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n22. Dean Malenko\n\n23. Scott Norton\n\n24. The Gambler\n\n25. Hugh Morrus\n\n*BAM! What an unprecedented collection of talent that is. Let's see how far I can stretch this....\n\n----------------\n\n26. Xanta Klaus27. Buddy Landell\n\n28. \"Ambassador\" Steve Casey\n\n29. Too Cold Scorpio\n\nMost Improved Wrestler\n\n1. Barry Horowitz (#3)\n\n2. Chris Benoit\n\n3. Mabel\n\n*Horowitz takes the top spot just because he used to lose all the time and now he wins once in a while. Benoit was a forgettable lower card nobody in 1993. Now he's a Horseman flirting with stardom and I accepted it almost immediately when it could easily have been a Paul Roma 2.0 situation. Mabel probably gets #3 just because he went from a midcard tag teamer into a KOTR winner & main eventer.\n\nBest Wrestling Gimmick\n\n1. Goldust (#1)\n\n2. \"The Dean\" Dean Douglas\n\n3. Paul Orndorff becomes Wonderful again.\n\n*Damn. As with Favorite Wrestler, this is probably the deepest year ever for this category. Honorable Mentions to Jean Pierre Lafitte, Disco Inferno, Blue Bloods & Dungeon of Doom (for the concept, not the execution).\n\nBest Wrestling Move\n\n1. Marty Jannetty's Top Rope Powerbomb\n\n2. Owen Hart's Enziguiri Enzuigiri BACK BRAIN KICK\n\n3. Chris Benoit's Dragon Suplex\n\n*Marty Jannetty's mind blowing Top Rope Powerbomb on Skip at Survivor Series '95 was the craziest wrestling move I had ever seen up to that point in my life. Don't even think anything else comes close. Owen's Concussion Kick was THE move among my wrestling fan clique as 1995 drew to a close. Always thought Benoit's Dragon Suplex was wicked cool. Honorable Mention to Undertaker's Tombstone, Yoko's Banzai Drop, and the Razor's Edge. Three all time great finishers right there.\n\nBest Match\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. British Bulldog- IYH December\n\n2. Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramon- Summerslam (#1)\n\n3. Bret Hart vs. Diesel- Survivor Series\n\n*This one I am certain about.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Barry Horowitz vs. Skip\n\n2. Jeff Jarrett vs. Razor Ramon\n\n3. Razor Ramon vs. 1-2-3 Kid vs. Dean Douglas (#5)\n\n*Yikes! Weak year for feuds. Dig RSPW voting Razor/Kid/Dean at #5 though. That feud really did rule. Not sure I'd have had the smarts to vote for a 3 way feud in real time, but screw it. That feud deserves some love.\n\nWorst Wrestler/Worker\n\n1. Buddy Landell\n\n2. Hacksaw Jim Duggan (#2)\n\n3. Mo\n\n*Buddy Landell reached a hitherto unimaginable level of suck during his (un)glorious 4 match WWF stint. He quickly became the Patron Saint of Suck....the first ever \"so bad it's good\" wrestler. I'd like to think I would have been fair enough to leave Hogan off (though I probably wouldn't have). Duggan was even worse than Hogan in the ring. People rag on Mabel but wtf did Mo ever do? Talk about worthless.... Then you have Dave Sullivan, who was the double whammy of both bad and boring. Tons of other worthy candidates here as well- Most (all?) of the Dungeon, Bundy, Mantaur, both members of Team Methuselah, DDP, Renegade....even Sid would be a strong candidate if it weren't for his awesome last two months w/ Kid.\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\nSome combination of Team Methuselah (#3), Bushwhackers (#4), and Well Dunn (#5). Although I'd have a tough time leaving the Nasty Boys off, and the Blu Brothers weren't exactly world beaters either.\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Diesel (#5)\n\n2. Hulk Hogan (#2)\n\n3. Shawn Michaels\n\n*I'd PROBABLY put Diesel over Hogan just because Diesel was \"more important\" since I watched WWF a whole lot more than WCW. Then again, the main reason I didn't watch WCW for most of the year WAS Hogan. Michaels is \"only\" #3 because I still liked him up until Wrestlemania. Dishonorable Mentions to Ahmed, Skip, Razor and like 60% of the WCW roster. This category is proof that even My Favorite Wrestling had a whole lot of crap.\n\nWorst Match\n\nAvatar vs. Brian Walsh- Raw 10/23\n\n*Retroactive choice because this match is so bad it needs to be mentioned. Real time #1 would have to be....\n\n1. World War III- An impossible to follow mess\n\n*With the worst of the endless DDP/Badd series in there somewhere. Luckily I missed all the Sid/Diesel matches and most Hogan matches in real time.\n\nWorst Feud\n\n1. Johnny B. Badd vs. DDP\n\n2. Harlem Heat vs. Nasty Boys\n\n3. Dustin Rhodes vs. Blacktop Bully\n\n*These three awful, endless feuds are symbolic of Dork Age WCW. Aka: the most depressing wrestling ever.\n\nWorst Babyface\n\n1. Gorilla Monsoon\n\n2. Razor Ramon\n\n3. Diesel\n\n*Gorilla Monsoon wasn't just a corrupt commissioner. He was an openly corrupt commissioner who bragged about how corrupt he was. Stone Cold came a few years too late. He'd have been my favorite wrestler if only he'd shown up in 1995 to oppose the dictatorial regime of corrupt Commissioner Monsoon. Razor Ramon was a patronizing bully...and that was to his friends! He was even worse to his enemies. Bad guy, indeed. Kid was totally justified in turning on the jerk from Miami. Diesel did not make my list for the reasons you're thinking. His WWF Championship reign saw him as a right proper babyface. Not my cup of tea, for sure, but that's how wrestling good guys acted. No. It's Diesel's last month and a half as an 'edgy' babyface that gets him on here. He attacks fellow good guys and will only shake hands with folks wearing his merchandise. What an ass.\n\nMost Obnoxious Personality\n\n1. Shawn Michaels\n\n2. Hulk Hogan (#3)\n\n3. Skip\n\n*Pretty crazy/sad when Vince, Bischoff, Duggan, DDP, Johnny B. Badd, Alex Wright, Mongo, Gorilla, Dok, Pettengill, Roadie, Razor, Diesel, Whippleman & Onoo can't even crack the Top 3.\n\nBest Manager\n\n1. Jim Cornette (#1)\n\n2. Ted Dibiase\n\n*Cornette was my boy and I was still too dumb to realize Dibiase sucked as a manager.\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Tony Schiavone (#4)\n\n*This is probably the first year I really paid attention to announcers beyond funny heel color commentary. JR was obviously my guy and I still liked Tony because NWA.\n\nBest Color Commentator\n\n1. Jerry Lawler (#2)\n\n2. Mr. Perfect\n\n3. Larry Zbyszko\n\n*Jerry \"The GOAT\" Lawler was on fire all year. Perfect was only around for a month and a half but, well, he IS perfect. And I'm always going to be a Zbyszko fan.\n\nBest Interviewee\n\n1. Goldust\n\n2. Jerry Lawler\n\n3. Dean Douglas\n\n*I was all about the Goldust vignettes & promos. See above for Lawler. Dean Douglas was a great shit stirrer with his Report Card segments.\n\nBest Angle\n\n1. Horowitz Wins! (#1)\n\n2. Owen concusses Michaels. Brags about it.\n\n3. The Dean/Kid/Razor/Sid story.\n\n*Damn. That's a killer Top 3. Honorable Mentions to Mr. Backlund giving Dean Douglas the Board of Education (too bad it never went anywhere) and those Horsemen jerks Spike Piledriving Mr. Wonderful on the concrete floor (which also never went anywhere). The Arn/Flair feud leading to the Horsemen reformation was another good one.\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. WCW (#3)\n\n3. AWF (Where they wrestle in rounds)\n\n*I love how WWF won the real life RSPW award even though they \"sucked\" in 1995. WCW was awful up until September but really good from September on. AWF (Where they wrestle in rounds) was AWFul but I only watched 3 promotions that year. So maybe I vote for them here.\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Superstars (#5)\n\n2. Raw (#1)\n\n3. WCW Saturday Night (#4)\n\n*Superstars > Raw was one of my big (insane) talking points around this time. I was digging WCW by the end of the year so I'd want to give one of their shows some love over Action Zone. I watched Worldwide more, and Nitro was more important, but Saturday Night was my favorite WCW program for the simple fact that it was TWO HOURS! A weekly two hour wrestling show was insane to wrestling obsessed 1995 me, but in the best possible way. \"Why every week could theoretically be the quality of an In Your House or a Clash!\" And Saturday Night getting cut back to one hour in the summer because of those damn Atlanta Braves just made me hate the Braves more than I already did. Another reason for Saturday Night > Worldwide is because I have bad memories of those awful 8 months of Worldwide before WCW got good again.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n1. Survivor Series\n\n2. IYH December\n\n3. Summerslam (#1)\n\n*Survivor Series gets the nod over the equally awesome IYH December just because I attended Survivor Series. Summerslam is a strong #3.\n\nWorst Manager\n\n1. Harvey Whippleman (#1)\n\n2. Sonny Onoo\n\n3. Uncle Zebekiah\n\n*Whippleman is always a safe bet here. Sonny Onoo & Uncle Zebekiah were both awful. Colonel Parker also sucked by this point due to his stable of oldsters and the endless parade of bad feuds they put him in. The Roadie deserves a mention for being Whippleman-levels of annoying. Plus he cost Jarrett the IC Title. What a waste of oxygen that guy was.\n\nWorst Promotion\n\n1. AWF (Where we wrestle in rounds)\n\n2. WCW\n\n*AWF 1.0 was awful and depressing. WCW was just as bad, if not worse, for 8-9 months but things really picked up in September. I was literally incapable of voting WWF 'worst' anything in 1995 so the 3rd spot remains blank.\n\nWorst Major Show\n\n1. WCW Super Brawl\n\n*My cousin offered me free tickets to this show. I turned him down. I cannot stress this enough. I turned down free tickets to a wrestling pay per view in 1995. That is how not into WCW I was. I watched the show either late in the year or early 96 (but let's pretend it was late in the year) and I did not for one second regret turning down those tickets. Awful show. No WWF here because it was impossible for me to truly hate a WWF ppv in 1995.....although maybe that changes if I had seen the infamous KOTR '95.\n\nWorst Announcer\n\n1. Eric Bischoff (#1)\n\n2. Vince McMahon (#2)\n\n3. Todd Pettengill (#3)\n\n*Bischoff for being a smug prick. Vince for being a hyperactive doofus with an unhealthy crush on Shawn Michaels. Pettengill for being Vince Jr.\n\nWorst Color Commentator\n\n1. Steve McMichael\n\n2. Dok Hendrix\n\n*The other day I said I loved all things Mongo. I lied. He sucked on commentary. Dok Hendrix was another hyperactive dork in the Pettengill mold.\n\nMost Disappointing News Item\n\n1. Luger (and Alundra Blayze) sell out. But mostly Luger.\n\n2. WCW runs Nitro on Mondays\n\n3. Death of Eddie Gilbert\n\n*Luger (& Blayze) were the first \"sellouts.\" Many more would follow. There were 5 other perfectly acceptable nights to launch a new wrestling show (no Sundays because that's PPV night). So why do those jerks at WCW choose to go head to head with Raw?!? I'd have LOVED watching Raw on Mondays and Nitro on some day that isn't Monday every week. But no! Sleazy E forces us to choose. Well, I was already choosing WWF more often than not. Gilbert was really the first wrestling death to hit me a little bit. I found out about it like 9-10 months after it happened. It was such a shock. He was so young. I had been an Eddie Gilbert fan in late 80s NWA. He was also in the midst of a big action figure league push that now had to be aborted due to our (bizarre) policy of not using dead wrestlers.\n\nWorst Wrestling Gimmick\n\n1. Isaac Yankem: Evil Dentist\n\n2. Alex Wright: Dancing German pretty boy who never lost\n\n3. Renegade: Fake Ultimate Warrior\n\n*Yankem was instant Wrestlecrap. Read Alex Wright's description and tell me how in the hell that was ever supposed to make him a babyface to 1995 wrestling fans. The Renegade gimmick was carny as fuck. And Renegade sucked. Then there was the stuff I never saw in real time like Phantasio & Tekno Team 2000. Plus all the Wrestlecrap gimmicks that were grandfathered in from previous years like Johnny B. Badd, Dave Sullivan, Holly, Aldo, Dumpster, Nasty Boys, DDP, etc. Kama, Rad Radford, Mantaur & Man Mountain Rock were more Current Year suck. And what was the deal with Waylon Mercy? Sure, he had good vignettes, but in the ring he was a heel....who acted like a face sometimes? Huh? Yeah, I totally didn't \"get\" this supposedly great gimmick. Maybe it went over my head? But once again even My Favorite Wrestling wasn't afraid to be bad.\n\nMost Charismatic\n\n1. Shawn Michaels\n\n2. Razor Ramon\n\n3. Hulk Hogan\n\n*Well, that was fun. 1996 tomorrow.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\nTime to revisit My Favorite Wrestling. This time it's 1996 and we're back to RSPW style voting & rambling. This is probably my peak year for unusual opinions. It's also in the running for peak year of my fandom. Once again, I did not watch any ECW this year. Just WWF, WCW until August & AWF. But I did likely watch more wrestling this year than any previous year.\n\n1996\n\nBest Wrestler/MVP\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#1)\n\n2. The Giant\n\n3. Hulk Hogan\n\n*Michaels had an all time great year in ring wise as WWF champion. It's insane to me that Giant only got 2 votes out of 98 voters. He was WCW Champ for 4 months and I totally bought into him as The Next Big Thing. PWI > RSPW. Hogan reinvented himself with the NWO and made wrestling more popular than it had been since....well, the last time he made wrestling huge. Yet he didn't receive a single vote. Madness!\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n1. Owen Hart & Davey Boy Smith (#3)\n\n2. New Rockers (#15)\n\n3. Fire & Ice\n\n*Owen & Bulldog were a breath of fresh air who stabilized a WWF tag division that had sucked for months. I was a hot headed wrestling obsessed teenager who was just smart enough to be stupid in 1996. I was also all about giving no fucks. So y'all can keep your Harlem Heat, Gunns, Outsiders and Steiners. I'll take the New Rockers and Fire & Ice all day, every day. HM to Furnas & LaFon.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Hollywood Hogan (#4)\n\n2. Kevin Nash (#3)\n\n3. Steve Austin (#1)\n\n*Hollywood Hogan was the only wrestler who ever pissed me off so much that it caused me to quit watching an entire promotion. Kevin Nash was the biggest dick in WWF during the Undertaker feud, and this was before he had nuclear heat with me for \"selling out.\" So fuck that guy. Austin wins this in a landslide 9 years out of 10 for blatantly violating the heel code. But 1996 was a special year for heels, man.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n*OK, this is where peak 1996ness comes in. Historically I had been a heel fan, but I understood that I was rooting for bad guys. In 1996 I genuinely believed some heels were actually faces. The Horsemen come to mind. It was a sort of \"shades of gray\" thing, or 1997 Bret Hart a year early.\n\n1. John Tenta!\n\n2. Undertaker (#5)\n\n3. Bret Hart (#2)\n\n*He's not a natural disaster. He's not a fish. He's a man, dammit! He's John Tenta! He's also the best babyface of 1996. Perennial Top 3 babyface Undertaker is here more for the Diesel feud than the Mankind rivalry. Bret Hart being The Guy Who Stayed turned him into a huge babyface with me. AWF's Sgt. Slaughter deserves a mention for being an old school white meat babyface who was so OTT cheesy that you couldn't help but love him.\n\n*Turns out I didn't need that little disclaimer after all. Oh well. Fwiw, Arn & Flair were in contention.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#3)\n\n2. Dean Malenko (#4)\n\n3. Chris Benoit (#2)\n\n*HBK had an all time great in ring year. Like 10 of my top 20 matches from '96 would have involved Michaels. Malenko established the Cruiserweight division by being the best damn technical wrestler I had ever seen. While Benoit was the 2nd best technical wrestler I had ever seen who also showed off some killer brawling skillz against Sullivan. Strong Honorable Mentions to revolutionary high flyer Rey Mysterio Jr., total in ring package Eddie Guerrero, WWF's unappreciated workrate king Leif Cassidy, the silky smooth Owen Hart, and \"the future of tag team wrestling\" (LOL) Furnas & LaFon. Damn. Deepest year to date in this category.\n\nBest Jobber\n\n1. THE GAMBLER! (#3)\n\n2. Jeff Hardy\n\n3. Barry Horowitz (#1)\n\n*I unironically loved The Gambler. A jobber with a gimmick! He was a Top 10 WCW guy for me. No exaggeration. Jeff Hardy beat Razor Ramon! #NeverForget I honestly lost a lot of interest when they started jobbing out poor Barry again, but he's still the GOAT jobber. So he takes home the 3rd spot.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. Rey Mysterio Jr. (#1)\n\n2. Marc Mero (#3)\n\n3. Eddie Guerrero (#9)\n\n*Rey wins in probably the biggest landslide in any category to date. He did like 5 jaw dropping, never before seen aerial moves every single time I saw him. Mero had the mind blowing Shooting Star Press and the Merosault. Eddie had top rope splashes, frankensteiners and dives.\n\nBest Technical Wrestler\n\n1. Dean Malenko (#1)\n\n2. Chris Benoit (#3)\n\n3. Owen Hart (#14)\n\n*Malenko was to technical wrestling what Rey was to high flying. Simply the best....ever. And Benoit wasn't far behind him, while Owen was still silky smooth in the ring.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Vader (#2)\n\n2. Mankind (#1)\n\n3. Undertaker (#6)\n\n*Vader was my main man in '96. Loved his bully boy brawling tactics. Especially when done to Mr. Monsoon and Mr. Michaels. Mankind took the craziest bumps I had ever seen. #3 is a toss up with Taker, Diesel & Michaels all fine choices. I went with Taker because 1996 me surely would have voted for him over the other two for favoritism reasons.\n\nFavorite Wrestler\n\n1. Vader (Only ONE 3rd place vote?!? WTF)\n\n2. Goldust (#20something)\n\n3. Owen Hart (#17)\n\n*RSPW had awful taste in 1996. All 3 men kicked the year off with a bang (Vader squashes Gorilla, Goldust/Razor feud & IC Title win, Owen/HBK feud) and stayed strong for months. The first two did fade big time towards the end of the year but their super strong peaks keep them above Owen and....\n\n4. Ric Flair (#8)\n\n5. British Bulldog\n\n6. Leif Cassidy/New Rockers\n\n7. Jerry Lawler\n\n8. Dean Malenko (#6)\n\n9. Arn Anderson\n\n10. Lord Steven Regal\n\n*I am sad to report that aside from Flair & Malenko I am not sure all those other awesome wrestlers even got 10 RSPW votes between them.\n\n*And since I did it for 1995 let's see how far we can take this....\n\n11. Undertaker (#11)\n\n12. The Giant\n\n13. Chris Benoit (#3)\n\n14. Fire & Ice\n\n15. Fake Diesel & Fake Razor\n\n16. Salvatore Sincere\n\n17. MONGO\n\n18. Disco Inferno (#15!)\n\n19. Mankind\n\n20. John Tenta\n\n21. Furnas & LaFon\n\n22. The Gambler\n\n23. Texas Hangmen\n\n24. Bret Hart (#2)\n\n25. Bobby Eaton- It bothered me to think younger fans might view 1/2 of the GOAT tag team as a glorified jobber. Sadly that is exactly what happened.\n\n----------------------------\n\n26. Barry Horowitz- I lost interest pretty quickly once his push ended. Meaning he was to 1996 what Mr. Backlund was to 1995. What a fickle fan I was.\n\n27. Flash Funk- I'd have preferred 2 Cold Scorpio. And why was he getting pushed less than that scrub Rocky Maivia? But I still had high hopes for his '97.\n\n28. Chris Adams- AWF\n\n29. Sgt. Slaughter- Where we wrestle\n\n30. Honkytonk Man- in rounds\n\nMost Improved Wrestler\n\n1. The Giant (#3)\n\n2. Salvatore Sincere\n\n3. DDP (#2)\n\n*I didn't care about Giant at first. Then he suddenly became awesome. Sal Sincere was SO much better than boring Johnny Gunn. DDP got that outta nowhere super push and I was finally beginning to kinda sorta almost tolerate him by August. So he takes home the 3rd spot because I can't think of anybody else.\n\nMost Overpushed Wrestler\n\n1. Hulk Hogan (#1)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels (#7)\n\n3. DDP\n\n*I had never liked Hogan but I could at least respect him as a big deal. By 1996 I was a little bit 'smarter' and I found his overpush obnoxiously nauseating...even BEFORE the NWO. He and Savage beat 8 guys! Then he beat the unbeatable Giant! Fuck Hulk Hogan. HBK may have been the best wrestler in the world but his push was Hogan-levels of obnoxious....even BEFORE he won the belt. It only got worse from there. DDP was the most random, wtf, outta nowhere winner of anything ever when he captured the Lord of the Ring by winning BattleBowl. Dishonorable Mention to Sid, Ahmed, Booty Man, and those damn Bodydonnas.\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. New Rockers (#11)\n\n2. Fake Diesel & Fake Razor\n\n3. \"Slammy Award Winning\" Owen Hart (w/ cast)\n\n*I'm going with new gimmicks rather than awesome grandfathered in gimmicks like Goldust, Disco, Taker, etc. New Rockers were a hoot as dorky rock star wannabes. Fake Diesel & Fake Razor may have sucked in every possible way but I was in love with the concept. And I'm combining two fun Owen gimmicks for the heck of it.\n\nBest Wrestling Move\n\n1. Marc Mero's Wild Thing (#1)\n\n2. Rey Mysterio's flipping Frankensteiner dive to the floor (#2)\n\n3. Owen Hart's belly to belly suplex on a running opponent\n\n*Mero's Shooting Star was a jaw dropper. Like 90% of the stuff Rey did was also a jaw dropper. I picked the one I did simply because it was the highest ranking Rey move and voting for \"any cool Rey move\" would have been disqualified. I could never figure out how Owen did that belly to belly on a running opponent so smoothly. As I got older it became MORE incredible after seeing Rock & MVP's shitty versions. Such a cool move, that one.\n\nBest Match\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin- Survivor Series (#9 in 1997 because RSPW didn't understand how years work)\n\n2. Chris Benoit vs. Kevin Sullivan- WCW Great American Bash\n\n3. Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind- IYH September (#2)\n\n*This was definitely my Top 3. \"Logic\" for the order is WWF > WCW > Indecisive Finish. It's insane to me that the awesome Benoit/Sullivan brawl only got a few votes at RSPW. That was the first real \"ECW style\" match I ever saw and I was blown away. HM to the awesome HBK/Diesel fight at IYH April.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Shawn Michaels vs. Camp Cornette\n\n2. NWO vs. WCW (#1)\n\n3. Undertaker vs. Mankind (#2)\n\n*HBK vs. Camp Cornette carried 1996 WWF to real time me. NWO vs. WCW was kind of a big deal. I honestly wasn't THAT into Taker/Mankind but it lasted forever while the feuds I was really into (Austin/Bret, Goldust/Razor, Taker/Diesel) were either short-lived, or just heating up as the year ended.\n\nWorst Wrestler/Worker\n\n1. Loch Ness (#2)\n\n2. Hulk Hogan (#1)\n\n3. Sid (#6)\n\n*Loch Ness made immobile late 80s Andre look like Rey Mysterio. Hogan was the lowlight of the Worst Match of All Time, and just more obnoxious than ever this year. While Sid flat out sucked without his little buddy Kid around to make him tolerable. Dishonorable Mention to Duggan, who was at least confined to the lower card this year.\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\n1. Bodydonnas (#18)\n\n2. Bushwhackers (#2)\n\n3. Too many to choose from\n\n*Bodydonnas were the worst heavily featured act in WWF. Just so bad. Literal channel change material. Bushwhackers only appeared a few times. That's still a few times too many. How do you expect me to choose between the Barrio Brothers, Tekno Team 2000, Team Methuselah, Men At Work, Fake Razor & Fake Diesel, Public Enemy, and the Nasty Boys for that 3rd spot? My god, that's a lot of suck. Hell, you can throw the Godwinns, Faces of Fear, and American Males in there too.\n\nWorst Babyface\n\n1. Bodydonnas (#14)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels (#7)\n\n3. Hulk Hogan (#3)\n\n*Bodydonnas were unlikable, obnoxious, and just flat out stupid. Who the hell is going to cheer for these morons? Shawn Michaels was an obnoxious prick with an ego the size of Mt. Everest. Not a good look for your top babyface. Speaking of egos the size of Mt. Everest, look, it's Hulk Hogan! Dishonorable Mention to Booty Man, Sid & The Stalker.\n\nEDIT: Can't believe I forgot about that boring, senior citizen-looking greaseball Fit Finlay. He couldn't even get over as a babyface against Regal....REGAL! Like any other wrestler with a pulse could get cheered like mad against mid-90s Regal. But nope. Not Fit fucking Finlay.\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Hulk Hogan (#1)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels (#10)\n\n3. Kevin Nash/Outsiders\n\n*I disliked Hogan so much I quit watching an entire promotion because of him. Shawn Michaels was very much the workrate version of classic Hogan, but possibly even more annoying. I couldn't stand Nash (& Hall) even before they sold out. Selling out was just adding fuel to the fire. Dishonorable Mention to Ahmed Johnson, Steve Austin, Booty Man, Bodydonnas, PIG, Finlay, Sid, and a bunch of those lousy WWF low midcard wrestlers with dumb gimmicks.\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. Jake Roberts (#2)\n\n2. The Stalker (#5)\n\n3. Yokozuna (#15)\n\n*Jake Roberts looked 65 and wrestled like a man not a day under 80. I was excited for about 2 seconds when I realized Barry Windham was coming back to WWF. The dumb Stalker gimmick did him no favors but by this point he was old, out of shape, and just plain bad. It was sad to watch the once mighty Yokozuna huff and puff his way around the ring. Lowlight came when he broke the ropes against Austin at Summerslam....or maybe it was when he was too fat for the forklift. Dishonorable Mention to poor Jim \"Who\" Neidhart.\n\nMost Underpushed\n\n1. Leif Cassidy (#4)/New Rockers\n\n2. Scott Norton/Fire & Ice\n\n3. Salvatore Sincere (#20something)\n\n*The New Rockers should have been huge, dammit! Cassidy in particular was a new style workrate guy with charisma. Should have been much bigger. Fire & Ice ruled. Great look and they could go in the ring, Norton in particular. So glad to see my man a Sal get a some votes here. I'd get so pissed seeing him used as shitty Rocky Maivia personal job boy. Sincere was better than Rocky in every possible way. Dude could go in the ring. Good look. Held his own in high profile matches with Michaels & Taker. Got into his (admittedly kinda lame) character. Yet the poor guy couldn't sniff a push. Honorable Mention to poor Bobby Eaton. I'd get so depressed in real time thinking about all those young fans seeing Eaton as nothing more than a B & C Show jobber when in reality he was one of the all time greats. Disco Inferno also deserves a shout out. Dude could go! His awesome PPV match with Malenko is all the proof you'll ever need.\n\nWorst Gimmick\n\n1. TL Hopper (#3)\n\n2. Zip\n\n3. Booty Man (#6)\n\n*Once again I'm going with all new gimmicks rather than bad gimmicks from previous years which were grandfathered in. I'm also excluding Cloudy because it never wrestled a match. TL Hopper: Evil Wrestling Plumber was to 1996 what Isaac Yankem was to 1995. Skip was bad enough. Now we have to deal with his retarded looking (1996 speak) fake cousin. Skip & Zip...good grief! Who booked this crap? Booty Man was so much cringe. Yet somewhere a young, going nowhere Billy Gunn saw the Booty Man and had an idea..... Dishonorable Mention to PIG, The Goon, Freddie Joe Floyd, Who, Men At Work, Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw, \"Jailbird\" Crush, \"Real Double J\" Jesse Jammes, and probably a few others I'm forgetting.\n\nWorst Match\n\n1. Doomsday Cage Match- Uncensored (#1)\n\n2. Disco Inferno vs. Kurosawa- Nitro 7/1\n\n3. Goldust vs. Roddy Piper- Wrestlemania\n\n*The Doomsday Cage Match is my choice for worst match of all time. After that debacle I vowed never again to pay for a WCW pay per view. And I never did. Do yourself a favor and check out Disco/Kurosawa if you've never seen it. Possibly the worst finish of all time. Goldust/Piper was sports entertainment at its worst. Dishonorable Mention to a pair of seemingly endless Uncensored DUDS in Road Warriors vs. Sting & Booker, and Finlay vs Regal.\n\nWorst Feud\n\n1. Lord Steven Regal vs. Fit Finlay\n\n2. Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs. VK Wallstreet (#2)\n\n3. Bart Gunn vs. Billy Gunn\n\n*Regal/Finlay and Duggan/Wall Street stunk up the main WCW shows, while Billy vs. Bart was about as heatless a feud as you will ever see. At least most of WWF's worst feuds like Dumpster/Hopper and Bradshaw/FJ Floyd were confined to Superstars. Parker/Madusa, Lothario/Cornette, Nasty Boys/Public Enemy and DDP/B. Badd (yep, it was STILL going) also deserve a mention here.\n\nMost Disappointing News Item\n\n1. Outsiders sell out to WCW (#1)\n\n2. Mr. Perfect also sells out to WCW\n\n3. Shawn Michaels doesn't retire after getting concussed by Owen Hart\n\n*It's hilarious to me that \"Outsiders sell out\" won the real life RSPW awards. Guess RSPW was WWF country. Perfect leaving was so depressing, especially after he FINALLY started an angle after 11 months of teasing it. My #3 is only half tongue in cheek.\n\nMost Obnoxious Personality\n\n1. Hulk Hogan (#2)\n\n1. Eric Bischoff (#1)\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#12)\n\n*It's a 3 way tie for first because how do you decide who is the bigger douchebag among these 3 all time level douchebags?\n\nBest Manager\n\n1. Jim Cornette (#2)\n\n2. Sunny (#1)\n\n3. Paul Bearer\n\n*Cornette had maybe the last great year of any manager in mainstream wrestling. Really one of the all time great managerial years, period, in my opinion. I was devastated when Camp Cornette split up late in the year. Sunny was the trendy choice that year and she did her best to make an otherwise awful tag division interesting. I was never much of a Paul Bearer fan but him turning on Taker to go with Mankind finally breathed some life into a lifeless character and kicked off the best run of his career.\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Tony Schiavone (#4)\n\n*I was in love with JR on commentary by this point and I'm fairly certain I still watched enough old NWA tapes to tolerate Tony.\n\nBest Color Commentator\n\n1. Jerry Lawler (#2)\n\n2. Mr. Perfect (#4)\n\n3. Dusty Rhodes (#13)\n\n*Jerry \"GOAT\" Lawler repeats for the 4th or 5th straight year. Perfect was class on Superstars. This is the year I fell in love with Dusty and all his wacky Dustyisms on commentary. HM to Larry Legend, Lord Alfred Hayes for being arguably the best part of AWF, and Owen for doing a stellar job at KOTR.\n\nBest on Interviews\n\n1. Goldust (#12)\n\n2. Jerry Lawler (#14)\n\n3. John Tenta!\n\n*Goldust never got enough credit for his awesome promo work in 95-96. I watched a bunch of his promos from this period a few years ago and I was shocked at how much they let him get away with. The Razor stuff was tremendous. The movie quotes were great character stuff. Even his lesser known promos on Taker and Ahmed were incredibly edgy (in a good way). It's almost not fair to include Lawler since he got to talk more than just about anybody else in wrestling but the Jake stuff at Summerslam alone would earn him a spot on this list. John Tenta takes home the 3rd spot for cutting THE best mainstream wrestling promo of the year.\n\nBest Angle\n\n1. Who is the 3rd man? Why Hulk Hogan, of course. (#1)\n\n2. Vader does the world a favor by attacking corrupt commissioner Monsoon (#10)\n\n3. The Mongo Swerve\n\n*Hogan/NWO changed the business. No mystery angle before or since can match it. Vader babyfaced himself to me by living the dream. Mongo swerve was so unexpected, and that's what made it awesome. Honorable Mention to The Perfect Swerve (#7) and Goldust/Razor (#15)\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. WCW (#3)\n\n3. AWF (#10)\n\n*My WWF love had never been greater. Because now we're at war. WCW had a quality 7+ months before I called it quits. I was much more into AWF 2.0 than AWF 1.0.\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Raw (#1)\n\n2. Superstars (#4)\n\n3. WCW Worldwide\n\n*I finally had to concede Raw > Superstars when Superstars went from syndication to the USA Network. In real time I probably would have put AWF over Worldwide because WCW hate, but I really did dig Worldwide for the first 7+ months of the year.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n1. WCW Great American Bash (#4)\n\n2. WCW Bash At The Beach (#2)\n\n3. Survivor Series\n\n*Great American Bash is a Top 10 PPV of all time. I'm just annoyed I didn't get to see it live since it was in Baltimore. Bash At The Beach is the night everything changed for WCW. Not 100% sold on Survivor Series at #3. I only missed a few WWF pay per views all year but the 8-10 I did see all sort of blend together.\n\nMost Charismatic\n\n1. Shawn Michaels\n\n2. Ric Flair\n\n3. Hulk Hogan\n\nWorst Manager\n\n1. Jose Lothario (#5)\n\n2. Cloudy (#2)\n\n3. Uncle Zebekiah (#10)\n\n*Jose Lothario is the most pointless manager of all time. Babyface managers suck as a rule. Then you trot out this boring old geezer with enough anti-charisma to make Gary Hart look like Jim Cornette. Cloudy was more like Cringey. Zebekiah should have been sent back to the 70s where he belonged. Dishonorable Mention to Teddy Long, Sonny Onoo, Col. Robert Parker, Sister Sherri, Clarence Mason, Hillbilly Jim....Good grief! It's no wonder managers went out of style. Little known fact: Most managers sucked.\n\nWorst Announcer\n\n1. Eric Bischoff (#1)- Most obnoxious man in wrestling\n\n2. Vince McMahon (#2)- \"I love you, Shawn Michaels.\"\n\nWorst Color Commentator\n\n1. Steve McMichael (#2)\n\n2. Mike Tenay (#10)\n\n*I always thought Tenay was such a dork. And not JUST a dork, but a dork with all the charisma of a Jose Lothario.\n\nWorst on Interviews\n\n1. Ahmed Johnson (#1)- Yep.\n\nWorst Organization\n\n1. WCW (#2)\n\n2. AWF (#1)\n\n*I probably would have voted WCW over AWF here out of my extreme loyalty to WWF.\n\nWorst TV Show\n\n1. AWF Warriors of Wrestling (#1)\n\nWorst Major Show\n\n1. WCW Uncensored (#1)\n\n2. August Clash of Champions (#14)\n\n3. IYH May: Beware of Dog (#2)\n\n*Uncensored is the worst wrestling pay per view I ever saw. The August Clash was the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to my interest in WCW. Beware of Dog 1.0 had a long mid-show power outage so they had a Beware of Dog 2.0 a few days later. It was....weird.\n\n*Whew! Done at last. 95 & 96 were the ones I really wanted had to do. I still think I'll come back to do 93-94 and 97-99 at some point but I doubt it will be so detailed. And the saddest thing is I don't think anybody ever reads my best stuff\n\nPost by Big Pete on\n\nGood find, Bake. Every now and then, I'll read through old DVDR reviews just to get a taste of the type of Pro Wrestling they were watching and how they would curate the big shows they'd lost touch with. '06 in particular is just a Mark Henry/Fit Finlay love-in, which is so odd, but then I wasn't an avid WWE watcher myself.\n\nLet me take a look at their 1999 results.\n\n{Spoiler}Best Wrestler (Overall Package)\n\n79 49 20 582 Chris Benoit\n\n73 53 26 576 Rock\n\n33 39 34 350 Mankind\n\nUgh, how did Benoit make it up here? True '99 was arguably Benoit's best year in WCW, but he was exposed big time on promos, he seldom got pushed and ultimately never came across like a star. I could live with The Rock winning this category. He started the year on fire, made a successful transition to babyface and was beginning to give Austin a run for his money, which was unthinkable at one point. Foley also had a huge year, capitilising on all the positive changes he made in 2000. Strangely, this may have been his worse in-ring year with some serious duds, but the I Quit match with The Rock was my favourite WWF singles match of the year, the boiler room with Show was one of the best hardcore matches & the SummerSlam Triple Threat was solid for what it was. Call it recency bias since he'd just been fired on Raw at the end of the year, but Foley had become more than just a fan favourite that year, he was damn near legendary.\n\nAs far as my pick is concern, I'd go with none other than the Whole F'N Show, Rob Van Dam. RVD was never better than what he achieved in '99 and for the uninitiated, he was like Kenny Omega where he was just pulling great spectacles out of anybody and doing these amazing athletic feats. He had a lot more charisma than Benoit and it seemed like with RVD as the face of the promotion, ECW was about to explode and become bigger than it ever had before. Taz & Tajiri would also be in the conversation. Both were the cool wrestlers you'd often see pimped out in magazines, or talked up in the wrestling sites back in the day. If you had WWF Wrestlemania 2000, you weren't making Chris Benoit, you were making guys like Rob Van Dam, Taz, Sabu & Tajiri.\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n144 71 34 1001 Hardy Boyz - Matt & Jeff (New Brood)\n\n35 70 42 469 Edge & Christian\n\n31 35 26 312 Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko\n\nI'm surprised the Hardy Boyz did so well here. I can't really complain, especially if you factor in the OMEGA stuff (which I doubt they did) but as an overall package, I don't think they found their niche. They spent a fair portion of '99 trying to be The Brood which was never anything more than just a cult favourite. Same goes for Edge & Christian who were fine, but seemed like the type of team that could have broken up whenever. I'd rate Benoit & Malenko over them since the '99 WCW tag scene may have been the best the tag scene had ever been booked there, but my #1 would be the Impact Players. I'm not sure what it was, but if you put Lance Storm & Justin Credible together, you had this great tag team that could headline shows and be taken seriously as a unit. The Dudley Boyz would go close here as well, if it wasn't for the WWF stint and the botched Public Enemy feud they would have been shoe-ins at #1. Bubba went onto have a great career, but there was a long time where '99 was far and away his best year in Pro Wrestling. Nowadays, he's just about my favourite act in ROH.\n\nBest Heel\n\n105 52 39 759 Triple H\n\n66 52 33 552 Mr. McMahon\n\n55 45 32 474 Chris Jericho\n\nYep, HHH finished the year incredibly strong and after months of relentlessly being pushed strong, it was hard not to hate HHH. Meanwhile McMahon became so entertaining, they turned him babyface and the fans actually bought into it at some level which is bizarre. Jericho was kind of weak, doing an imitation of his WCW gimmick and I would have gone with Jarrett, Corino, Bossman, Bubba & Lance Storm before him.\n\nBest Face\n\n135 61 24 906 Rock\n\n89 64 61 759 Mankind\n\n46 76 54 566 Steve Austin\n\nThat's the right Top 3, Austin would have been #1 since that's where the fans saw him for the better part of the year. Meanwhile, The Rock had somewhat been put on ice until Wrestlemania and usually found himself in the C-grade storylines, putting over guys like Bossman for the sake of the promotion.\n\nBest Worker\n\n159 60 19 1013 Chris Benoit\n\n19 30 18 221 Jeff Hardy\n\n24 17 9 189 Mankind\n\nSurprised to see Hardy revered so highly. I can't disagree, he was the pick of the WWF for me with X-Pac & Test thereabouts. I was surprised to see Lynn & Eddie rated over RVD, who would have been right up there on my list.\n\nBest Jobber\n\n62 40 36 502 Barry Horowitz\n\n53 34 23 413 Pete \"Gas\"\n\n28 22 27 260 Disorderly Conduct\n\nI would have voted for the MSP who took some crazy licks on the main roster. I can't speak to any of the other choices and while it's a fun sub-category, it's one I don't keep any track of.\n\nBest Jobber To The Stars\n\n67 23 24 452 Al Snow\n\n15 18 18 165 Norman Smiley\n\n19 15 11 162 Taka Michinoku\n\nWhat a strange category. Al Snow was the face of his own division, Smiley went down a similar path so I don't think they're jobbers at all. How did Benoit not make this list?\n\nLet me scan through these lists. Best Flyer? Worst Wrestling Move? Eh let's skip to some of the more interesting categories.\n\nMost Underrated\n\n28 16 11 210 D'Lo Brown\n\n21 16 12 177 Al Snow\n\n23 14 4 165 Chris Benoit\n\nOf course Benoit makes this list. What a load of bollocks. I don't think there was a single WCW guy at the time I was watching who wasn't getting a fair shake online or in the company. So that leaves the WWF, where I think Joey Abs was one of the better big-men workers they had on the roster and he got past over since he was affiliated with the Mean Street Posse. I would have chuck Christian on there and Papi Chulo who was a lot of fun to watch on the C-shows.\n\nBest Match\n\n148 59 26 969 10/17/99 Brood v. Edge & Christian (ladder)\n\n64 58 27 548 10/04/99 Bret Hart v. Chris Benoit (Nitro)\n\n12 16 29 166 08/22/99 Test v. Shane McMahon (Love her or leave her)\n\nHard to argue with that list. I would have thrown a RVD vs. Lynn match on there ahead of the Test & Shane, but otherwise that seems like a fair representation.\n\nBest Show\n\n46 36 32 402 08/22/99 WWF SummerSlam\n\n54 28 16 386 03/28/99 WWF WrestleMania XV\n\n24 28 30 264 09/19/99 ECW Anarchy Rulz\n\nWoah, what's WrestleMania XV doing on there? With more #1 votes as well! Wrestlemania XV kind of sucked and was completely outdone by Backlash the month after. Personally I thought WWF No Mercy and arguably St. Valentines Day Massacre gave it a real run for it's money as well. Anarchy Rulz is a fair shout, but Spring Stampede should have been right up there.\n\nWorst Show\n\n126 8 9 672 10/10/99 Heroes of Wrestling\n\n22 41 36 305 07/11/99 WCW Bash at the Beach\n\n18 38 21 246 08/14/99 WCW Road Wild\n\nI'll never watch Heroes of Wrestling, so I'll take their word for it. I thought Bash at the Beach sucked and made me question whether I should keep watching WCW and shows like Great American Bash '99 & Uncensored '99 were pretty bad as well. I would have chucked WWF Unforgiven or WWF King of the Ring on here. Both were difficult shows to get into, with the Chyna vs. Road Dogg match being the highlight of King of the Ring, while Unforgiven had the worst match of the year and nothing to make up for it. It also had that awful X-Pac vs. Jericho match, which on paper had to be a huge disappointment.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\nSince Big Pete covered 1999....\n\n{Spoiler}\n\nWrestler/MVP of the Year & Most Charismatic\n\n1. The Rock (#2)\n\n2. Steve Austin (#5)\n\n3. RVD (#6)\n\n*Rock surpassed Austin down the stretch due to Austin missing time with injury. ECW revolved around 3 wrestlers in '99- RVD, Taz, Dudleys. Taz & Dudleys left before year's end so RVD takes home the #3 spot. Rock, Austin, RVD were also the 3 most charismatic men in wrestling. Mick Foley would be #4 in both categories.\n\nTag Team of the Year\n\n1. Dudley Boyz (#4)\n\n2. Hardy Boyz (#1)\n\n3. Acolytes (#5)\n\n*All 3 teams (plus Impact Players & NAO) are flawed. Hardys & Acolytes spent the first half of the year as afterthoughts (though both teams were already bringing it in the ring) while the Dudleys had a rough first couple of months in WWF. BUT the Dudleys awesome first 8 months as otherworldly heels is enough to take home the top spot. Fwiw Impact Players never held tag team gold and the Outlaws were an on and off team this year.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Dudley Boyz (#13)\n\n2. Big Boss Man\n\n3. Steve Corino (#5)\n\n*Man, this is tough. Vince would win this in a heartbeat if he was a \"real\" wrestler. Dude was a tremendous heel. But I definitely didn't consider him a \"real\" wrestler at the time. As I just mentioned above the Dudleys were heel gods in ECW. Bossman was the biggest jerk in WWF, and 1999 was a veritable jerk store. Corino was an awesome wimpy little shit stirrer. Honorable Mentions to male chauvinist Jeff Jarrett and Lord of Darkness Undertaker, who literally sacrificed & hung people. I'd say that's pretty heelish. Each man could make the Top 3 if I did this again tomorrow. Fwiw the real life Top 3 was HHH, Vince & Jericho. HHH had the wrong kind of heat with me- go away heat. Vince was a non-wrestler who had some face stints, while Jericho was just a flatout awful heel. Heels don't get cheered, you RSPW assclowns.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Mankind (#2)\n\n2. Kane (#7)\n\n3. Tommy Dreamer (#20something)\n\n*Foley was a lock here and in Best Brawler from 97-00. Most likable babyface ever. Kane somehow managed to generate sympathy despite being a 7 foot monster with supernatural powers. Poor Tommy Dreamer always had the worst thing happen to him. Steve Austin deserves a mention for having two all time great pure babyface moments- helping Mankind win the title and saving Stephanie from Undertaker. This was his best year as a 'pure' face. Rock & RVD got massive pops but they were honestly both terrible babyfaces who were jerks to their own tag team partners. Speaking of RVD's partner, Sabu also deserves a mention here. As does New Jack for being the master of the big damn save.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. RVD (#6)\n\n2. Taz\n\n3. Jeff Hardy (#2)\n\n*Yeah, this might be the most \"1999\" of all these picks. I thought RVD was the Best In The World while Taz was the best offensive wrestler going. Hardy getting #2 in real life is crazy but I honestly can't think of anybody else who'd be a lock over Jeff here. I was really into big bumping stunt shows in 1999 and nobody was better at those than Jeff Hardy.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. RVD (#4)\n\n2. Jeff Hardy (#1)\n\n3. Super Crazy (#2)\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Mankind (#1)\n\n2. Bradshaw (#3)/APA\n\n3. Dudley Boyz (#16)\n\n*Mankind is obvious. Nobody was better at recklessly kicking ass than Bradshaw/APA. Dudleyz took extreme to new heights with flaming tables. Speaking of flaming tables, the criminally underrated Balls Mahoney deserves a mention here.\n\nFavorite Wrestler\n\n1. Mankind (#1)\n\n2. Taz (#20something)\n\n3. RVD (#7)\n\n*And for shits and giggles....\n\n4. Jeff Jarrett\n\n5. Steve Corino\n\n6. The Rock (#3)\n\n7. Owen Hart (#11)\n\n8. Sabu\n\n9. Dudley Boyz\n\n10. Sandman\n\n11. Hardcore Holly (#13)\n\n12. Undertaker\n\n13. Kane (#15)\n\n14. Hardy Boyz (#8 Jeff)\n\n15. APA\n\n16. Raven (#14)\n\n17. Kurt Angle\n\n18. Tommy Dreamer\n\n19. New Jack\n\n20. Edge & Christian (#18 Edge)\n\n21. Too Cool\n\n22. Mean Street Posse\n\n23. Christopher Daniels\n\n24. Balls Mahoney\n\n25. Nova\n\n26. D'Lo Brown\n\n27. Godfather\n\n28. Christian York\n\n29. Tom Brandi\n\n30. Rikishi\n\n31. Vince McMahon- Hard person to rate. Could have been as high as #11...but then there's that whole \"non wrestler\" thing...\n\nMost Improved\n\n*I still viewed this award in a kayfabe way back in '99\n\n1. Jerry Lynn (#8)\n\n2. Hardcore Holly (#1)\n\n3. Hardy Boyz (#14)\n\n*All 3 acts transformed from lower card afterthoughts into Guys Who Matter. Kane deserves a mention for his improvement in the ring, which is really what this award is supposed to be about. Too bad Kane's improvement didn't last.\n\nComeback Wrestler of the Year\n\n1. Jeff Jarrett- I just invented this award for him. He became awesome again in '99 after being \"just there\" for over a year.\n\nMost Overrated\n\n*Back then I thought this award meant \"overrated by (internet) fans\" rather than \"overpushed\"\n\n1. Chris Jericho\n\n2. Triple H (#10)\n\n3. Lance Storm\n\n*HHH & Jericho weren't just overrated. They flat out sucked to 1999 me. Couldn't really think of anybody else for #3 so Lance gets it despite his awesome Anarchy Rulz match with Jerry Lynn. Hooray! FINALLY one great match after 2 and a half years. Dean Malenko, he was not.\n\nMost Overpushed\n\n*The real Most Overrated award\n\n1. Vince McMahon\n\n2. Shane McMahon\n\n3. Chyna (#12)\n\n*I HATED non-wrestlers winning belts and all three of these people were \"non wrestlers\" as far as 1999 me was concerned. HM to dated scrub Big Bossman, who was inexplicably all over tv.\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. Steve Corino: Old School Hero (#7)\n\n2. Undertaker: Lord of Darkness (#18)\n\n3. Jeff Jarrett: Male Chauvinist (#6)\n\n*This could really go in any order. Honorable Mention to \"Big Shot\" Hardcore Holly, Kurt Angle's late in the year run, and Mr. McMahon.\n\nBest Wrestling Move\n\n1. Dudley Boyz 3D (#5)\n\n2. Tajiri's Tarantula (#9)\n\n3. Taz's TazzPlexes\n\nBest Match\n\n*Real time voting\n\n1. Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka vs. Taz- ECW Anarchy Rulz (#8)\n\n2. Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu- ECW Arena 10/23\n\n3. Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn- ECW Living Dangerously (#11)\n\n*After seeing more stuff\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. Chris Benoit- WCW Nitro 10/4 (#2)\n\n2. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian- No Mercy (#1)\n\n3. Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko vs. Raven & Saturn- WCW Spring Stampede (#9)\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon (#2)\n\n2. Dudley Boyz vs. All ECW Babyfaces\n\nWorst Wrestler/Worker\n\n1. Mideon (#3)\n\n2. Mark Henry\n\n3. Viscera (#4)\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\n1. Mideon & Viscera (#1)\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. British Bulldog (#5)\n\n2. Al Snow\n\n2. Big Show (#20something)\n\n*Bulldog had sadly become a shell of a shell of his once great self. Gone was Leif Cassidy: Technical Wizard with charisma. In his place was Al Snow: Gimmicky hardcore wrestler with a stupid gimmick who sucked at hardcore wrestling. Big Show was so disappointing, lumbering around the ring like an 80s super heavyweight rather than the athletic \"evolution of the big man\" I grew to love in 1996 WCW.\n\nMost Underrated/Underpushed\n\n1. D'Lo Brown (#1)\n\n2. Nova\n\n3. Taka Michinoku (#9)\n\n*In 1998 I thought D'Lo was going to follow in Rock's footsteps as the next breakout mega star. In 1999 he got lost in the shuffle and I lost interest. I was a Nova believer who genuinely thought he could/should have been in Jerry Lynn's spot as the guy who got made in workrate classics with RVD for the TV Title. Taka was a case of wrong place, wrong time. He deserved better. I knew this even back in 1999.\n\nWorst Gimmick\n\n1. Beaver Cleavage (#1)\n\n2. Fabulous Moolah & Mae Young\n\n3. Da Baldies\n\nMost Disappointing News Item\n\n1. Owen Hart's Death (#1)\n\n2. WWF Titles Devalued\n\n3. Dudley Boyz initially flop in WWF\n\n*Owen's death is the most disappointing wrestling news story ever. I was gutted. Hated how WWF treated its titles this year. Even the once-prestigious WWF Championship suffered through that awful 4 month HHH-Vince-Big Show stretch. Feel like I'm forgetting something big at #3. I didn't mind Taz & Dudleys leaving ECW. But I did not like how the Duds were treated during their first few months in WWF.\n\nBest Non-Wrestler\n\n1. Mr. Vince McMahon\n\n2. Bill Alfonso (#6)\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Joey Styles (#2)\n\n3. Jerry Lawler (#1 in Best Color Commentator)\n\nBest Interviewee\n\n1. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n2. The Rock (#2)\n\n3. Steve Corino (#7)\n\n*Foley was next level on the mic (in addition to being a next level babyface & brawler) from 97-00. Rock was the GOAT catchphrase machine. Corino was an awesome wimpy little shit stirrer with surprisingly big grapefruits. Honorable Mention to Austin, Vince, Dudleys & Taz.\n\nBest Angle\n\n1. Foley wins WWF Championship (#5)\n\n2. Sandman returns at the 10/23 ECW Arena show\n\n3. Raven returns to win the ECW tag titles with his arch nemesis Tommy Dreamer over the departing Dudleys (#7)\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. ECW (#2)\n\n3. MCW\n\n*Closest year since 1990. This was the real time peak of my ECW fandom. There were plenty of times I liked ECW better than WWF this year. But I just can't imagine myself ever voting against WWF during this period. MCW was my local indie and the only other promotion I got to see, though I did religiously follow California's APW & Memphis' PPW online.\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Raw (#1)\n\n2. Smackdown (#2)\n\n3. Jakked/Shotgun (#10)\n\n*I was so hyped for ECW on TNN. FINALLY I'd get to watch ECW on a weekly basis. But it just never did much for me. Maybe it was the Friday night time slot. Or maybe it was the fact that it could never live up to the hype I'd had for 2-3 years in my head. But by year's end I was already only an occasional watcher. Meanwhile, I was really into Shotgun early in the year before Smackdown became a thing, and was still watching regularly at the end of the year when it morphed into Jakked/Metal.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n*Real Time\n\n1. ECW Anarchy Rulz (#3)\n\n2. ECW Arena 10/23\n\n3. Backlash (#8)\n\n*Spring Stampede would be #1 if I had seen it in real time.\n\nBest Promotional Move\n\n1. ECW gets a tv deal with TNN (#2)\n\n2. Mick Foley wins the WWF championship (#5)\n\n3. WWF gets a show on network tv with Smackdown on UPN (#7)\n\n*Very strong year for promotional moves. Numbers 2 & 3 would win most years. Honorable Mentions to WWF airing a commercial during the Super Bowl, WWF signing Taz & Dudley Boyz, and ECW bringing back Sandman & Raven.\n\nWorst Angle\n\n1. Vince McMahon is the Higher Power (#8)\n\nWorst Organization\n\n1. WCW (#1)- Just because\n\n*In depth 1998 awards are up next. Then 1997. Then I'll go back and cover 93 & 94. Not sure whether 93 & 94 are gonna get the in depth treatment or the quickie version. They're weird years. Sort of the bridge between my diehard casual childhood fandom and my wrestling obsessed days of 95-00.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\n1998\n\nWrestler of the Year\n\n1. Steve Austin (#1)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#2)\n\n3. The Rock (#4)\n\n*Austin was the biggest star. Foley had the best matches. Rock was the most entertaining + fastest rising young star.\n\nTag Team\n\n1. New Age Outlaws (#1)\n\n2. Dudley Boyz (#4)\n\n3. RVD & Sabu (#2)\n\n*Outlaws in a rout. I still didn't like 'em but I did grow to respect them as a Big Deal during the Hardcore Legends feud and DX run.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Mr. McMahon (#1)\n\n2. Dudley Boyz (#14)\n\n3. The Rock (#3)\n\n*I know I left McMahon off my '99 list for being a \"non wrestler.\" Well, he was fresher and even more heelish this year. I wasn't much of a Dudley Boyz fan. Then I saw Heatwave '98. There was no turning back after that. Rock was almost too entertaining for this category but his late year heel turn was just enough to get him on here. Honorable Mentions to the New Age Outlaws & Shawn Michaels for generating nuclear heat early in the year.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Mick Foley (#6)\n\n2. Terry Funk\n\n3. Al Snow (#15)\n\n*Not a strong category this year. Foley was technically a heel for over half of the year but his character was more of 'lovable heel' for much of that stretch. I don't know how any wrestling fan could ever boo Terry Funk. Snow was very much of an \"of the time\" choice. Honorable Mentions to Taker & Dreamer.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n2. Rob Van Dam (#5)\n\n3. Taz\n\n*Foley had more good/great matches than anyone else in WWF or ECW. RVD was the most exciting guy to watch. Taz is another \"of the time\" choice.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. RVD (#4)\n\n2. Sabu (#6)\n\n3. D'Lo Brown (#20something)\n\n*First two are self explanatory. D'Lo's GOAT frog splash and textbook moonsault are enough to earn him the #3 spot.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n2. Terry Funk (#3)\n\n3. Bradshaw (#16)\n\n*First two are again self explanatory. This was Bradshaw's breakout year with me. HM to Austin and like half the ECW roster.\n\nMost Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. The Rock (#2)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n3. Al Snow (#9)\n\n*I cringe at post-Leif Cassidy Al Snow nowadays (and even botchy Leif at times) but at least I wasn't alone in liking him in '98. #9! That's nuts.\n\n4. Owen Hart (#17)\n\n5. Terry Funk\n\n6. Undertaker (#12)\n\n7. Taz\n\n8. D'Lo Brown (#10)\n\n9. RVD (#11)\n\n10. Ric Flair (#5)- I had his WCW return promo thrown on the back of a comp tape. So technically I saw him compete in 1998.\n\n11. Kane\n\n12. Val Venis\n\n13. Tom Brandi\n\n14. Dudley Boyz\n\n15. Sabu\n\n16. Too Much\n\n17. Jeff Jarrett\n\n18. Godfather\n\n19. Hardy Boyz\n\n20. BWO (Nova & Meanie)\n\n21. Tommy Dreamer\n\n22. Christopher Daniels\n\n23. Christian York\n\n24. Bradshaw\n\n25. New Jack\n\n26. The Brood\n\n27. Sandman\n\n28. Quebecers\n\n29. Too Cold Scorpio\n\n30. John Kronus\n\n31. Dick Togo\n\nMost Improved\n\n1. The Rock (#1)\n\n2. D'Lo Brown (#2)\n\n3. New Age Outlaws (#7)\n\n*Rock from 97 to 98 might be the most improved wrestler ever. He went from worst to first. I was convinced D'Lo was going to follow in Rock's footsteps. I still didn't like the Outlaws but the Hardcore Legends feud got me to respect them as big deals. HM to Dudleys and Bradshaw.\n\nMost Overpushed\n\n1. Shane Douglas (#16)\n\n2. Justin Credible\n\n3. Jack Victory\n\n*1998 Shane Douglas has to be the worst wrestler to ever get a \"best in the world\" push. Whoever thought \"Let's take Aldo Montoya, have him steal one 'cool' thing from every popular wrestler, and push him to the moon.\" was a good idea should have been blackballed from the wrestling business. Jack Victory in 1998 ECW is still one of the weirdest things ever. He was a glorified jobber a decade earlier in NWA. Now suddenly he returns out of nowhere to be employed by the so-called \"hip\" promotion AND given a pretty strong push to boot? The whole thing made zero sense. HM to Bossman, who I couldn't believe was getting pushed in 1998. He seemed so dated even with a slightly updated character.\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. Mr. McMahon (#3)\n\n2. The Rock (#4)\n\n3. Val Venis (#8)\n\n*Strong category with #1 & #2 practically interchangeable. Val Venis followed the old WWF formula of a '2nd job' wrestler getting introductory vignettes. Only with more 'edginess' because Attitude Era. And those introductory vignettes were glorious. Strong Honorable Mentions to Foley, Kane and Godfather.\n\nBest Wrestling Move\n\n1. D'Lo's \"Low Down\" frog splash (#10)\n\n2. Dudley Boyz 3D\n\n3. RVD's flip dive into the crowd (#11)\n\n*Honorable Mention to Taz's Tazplexes....all of them. And Christopher Daniels Angel's Wings + Slingshot Jackhammer\n\nBest Match\n\n1. Undertaker vs. Mankind- KOTR (#1)\n\n2. Steve Austin vs. Dude Love- Over The Edge (#4)\n\n3. HHH vs. Rock- Summerslam (#2)\n\n*We're mostly in agreement here. Honorable Mention to the awesome Funk vs. Foley Raw brawl.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon (#1)\n\n2. Undertaker vs. Kane (#6)\n\n3. New Age Outlaws vs. Hardcore Legends (#7)\n\n*Strong Top 3. A little surprised to see Taker/Kane so 'low' on the real RSPW list.\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Steve Austin\n\n2. Shane Douglas (#18)\n\n3. DX\n\n*Austin was a sociopathic jerk 99% of the time....who got cheered by 99% of the audience. Douglas was nauseating when active and even worse when sitting out half the year with injuries yet still being allowed to keep the \"prestigious\" ECW World Heavyweight Championship. I'm cheating by including all of DX but you can't expect me to pick just one. All 6 of them had borderline go away heat with 1998 me.\n\nMost Underpushed\n\n1. Owen Hart (#10)\n\n2. Brian Christopher (#7)\n\n3. Al Snow (#3)\n\n*Yeah, Owen didn't really fit in anymore, but he was still given a raw deal. Especially early in the year. Poor Brian Christopher was confined to teaming with a longtime jobber in tag matches on the C Show. Al Snow caught fire early in the year. ECW failed to pull the trigger and then WWF did squat with him. Honorable Mentions to Scorpio, who I had mostly given up on, but could still wow with his aerial arsenal when given the rare chance; Togo & Teioh, both of whom were way better than \"overrated\" Taka to 1999 me; and Nova, who had da movez + charisma.\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. Vader (#4)\n\n2. Legion of Doom (#7)\n\n3. Goldust\n\n*It was sad to see the demise of the once-great Vader. I had never been an LOD fan but even I was kinda sorta sad to see what they had been reduced to. Goldust sucked in 1997. He sucked even harder in 1998. Honorable Mention to Faarooq, who was quietly terrible for 80+% of the year. The Quebecers & JJ may not have \"deteriorated\" much in a traditional sense, but they just didn't fit in anymore.\n\nWorst Wrestler\n\n1. Kurrgan (#10)\n\n2. Giant Silva\n\n3. Dan Severn (#17)\n\n*Kurrgan & Silva were awful. We're talking Giant Gonzalez-levels of suck (though still better than Loch Ness). Severn's handful of cool suplexes were negated by his mind numbing anti-charisma. Dishonorable Mention to the usual suspects- DOA, Dennis Knight, Mark Henry, Godfather, Bossman, Jack Victory, Axl Rotten, etc.\n\nWorst Match\n\n1. Too Much vs. Al Snow & Head- KOTR\n\n2. Undertaker vs. Kane- October PPV (#9)\n\n3. Shane Douglas vs. Al Snow- ECW May PPV\n\n*The Too Much vs. Snow match was an embarrassment. Taker vs. Kane w/ Austin as ref was painfully long and painfully boring. Douglas vs. Snow was a DUD hilariously pushed as an epic with the 'wrong' guy winning. It honestly almost turned me off then-current ECW.\n\nMost Obnoxious Personality\n\n1. Steve Austin\n\n2. Shane Douglas\n\n3. DX\n\n*Hmm....that terrible triumvirate looks awfully familiar.\n\nBest Non-Wrestler\n\n1. Mr. McMahon\n\n2. Bill Alfonso\n\n3. Paul Bearer\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Jerry Lawler (#1- Color)\n\n3. Joey Styles (#3)\n\nBest Interviewee\n\n1. The Rock (#2)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n3. Steve Austin (#3)\n\n*Field was insanely deep this year. It's no wonder they had so much talking during the Attitude Era what with all these mic masters on the roster. Vince, Taz, Dudleys, even Godfather, Val & Road Dogg also did good work on the mic this year.\n\nBest Angle\n\n1. Vince vs. Austin (#1)\n\n2. Undertaker vs. Kane (#16)\n\n3. DX invades WCW\n\n*Another strong Top 3. HM to D'Lo: Champion of Europe, New Triple Threat & Rock takes over the Nation.\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. ECW (#2)\n\n3. MCW (#17)\n\n*Same as '99. Actually thought about putting MCW over ECW since I was really into my local indie as the year ended. MCW got 3 third place votes in the real RSPW awards. Bet I was one of them.\n\nWorst Organization\n\n1. WCW (#1)\n\nMost Charismatic\n\n1. Steve Austin\n\n2. The Rock\n\n3. Mick Foley\n\n*These three owned this year.\n\nLeast Charismatic\n\n1. Dan Severn- Likely the all time champ in this category\n\n2. Steve Blackman\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Raw (#1)\n\n2. Shotgun (#5)\n\n3. Heat (#3)\n\n*Digging Shotgun all the way up at #5. I never really got into Heat for whatever reason. Usually only watched it on PPV days. But that's still more than I watched any other non-listed wrestling show this year.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n1. Wrestlemania (#1)\n\n2. Summerslam (#3)\n\n3. King of the Ring (#2)\n\n*Wrestlemania XIV is an all time Top 10 PPV. Maybe Top 5. Summerslam '98 is among the GOAT Summerslams. KOTR gets the nod over Heatwave because I only saw the 2nd half of Heatwave in real time and KOTR had the Foley/Taker epic.\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\n1. New Midnight Express (#8)\n\n2. DOA (#3)\n\n*The New Midnight Express is one of the very few things in wrestling history that actually offended me. WWF had some gall trying to pass those two scrubs off as the most recent version of the greatest tag team wrestling had ever seen. DOA remained as bad and boring as ever.\n\n*Skipped most of the \"Worst\" categories this year since there wasn't too much stuff I loathed.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\n1997\n\nWrestler of the Year\n\n1. Bret Hart (#4)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels (#1)\n\n3. Undertaker (#18)\n\n*One thing I've noticed about these 90s RSPW Awards is they were very much Shawn > Bret. BOO! Bret had an all time great year, yet HBK won his war over \"The Hitman\" in the end. Taker edges out Austin (#3) due to being active all year and stabilizing the WWF Championship with a 4 month reign.\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n1. Eliminators (#1)\n\n2. Legion of Doom (#5)\n\n3. Owen Hart & Davey Boy Smith (#3)\n\n*Eliminators win it based on one match (vs. Dudleys @ Barely Legal) because that one match made me think they were no less than the 2nd greatest tag team of all time. LOD beat out Owen & Davey because the Hart Foundation duo stopped teaming regularly over the summer.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#1)\n\n2. Steve Austin (#7)\n\n3. Rob Van Dam (#8)\n\nGOAT year for heels. Michaels & Austin are really 1a and 1b and I think either guy would take the top spot in any other year ever. HBK was the biggest prick in wrestling history. Austin wasn't far behind, and Austin also had the GOAT heel performance at Canadian Stampede. I only saw RVD a couple of times and hated his guts each and every one of those times. What a prick that guy was. He was the next HBK in my mind. That was not a compliment (even though it kind of was in a roundabout sort of way). Even aligning with Jerry Lawler and \"selling out\" to my beloved WWF wasn't enough to make me like the man arrogantly known as \"Mr. Monday Night.\" Dishonorable Mentions to Faarooq, New Age Outlaws, HHH & Douglas; all of whom would have a shot to place in a normal year. I wasn't watching WCW where Hogan & The Outsiders were just about on that rare Michaels & Austin level of transcendent heeldom. Like I said, GOAT year for heels.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Bret Hart (#13)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#6)\n\n3. Terry Funk\n\n*As with heels, we also had some great babyface this year with Canadian Hero Bret Hart topping the list. He was right, dammit! Mick Foley became a made man with myself and many fans when he had those memorable sitdown interviews with JR. You're not human if you didn't pop when Dude Love showed up for the first time. I am a big fan of legendary old man babyfaces going for one last run as Funk did in ECW. Plus it was Terry f'n Funk. Another man I am never going to boo. Honorable Mention to Undertaker.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. Bret Hart (#7)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels (#1)\n\n3. Eliminators\n\n*Once again silly RSPW has Shawn well above Bret. Both men were in all time great matches this year. Plus 1997 me thought they were a cut above all others. Part of this is commentary/mag propaganda and part of that is what I saw with my own eyes. I'm not even sure Rey & Dean caused as many jaw drops as that first time I ever saw the Eliminators.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. Eliminators\n\n2. Rob Van Dam (#5)\n\n3. Flash Funk (#8)\n\n*Who knew there'd be so much Eliminators on this list? I had never seen guys that size fly around the ring the way the Eliminators did. RVD was a lot like Michaels in that he could back up his boasting, and that made me loathe HBK 2.0 all the more. Flash Funk didn't get a chance to show what he could do very often but nobody was smoother in the air than the man they once called Scorpio.\n\nBest Technical Wrestler\n\n1. Bret Hart (#2)\n\n2. Owen Hart (#3)\n\n3. Taz (#5)\n\n*Bret finally surpasses Owen here. Mainly because Ringpost Figure Four. Taz was a new kind of technical wrestler...call him a technical asskicker.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Mick Foley (#1)\n\n2. Steve Austin (#3)\n\n3. Undertaker (#7)\n\n*Foley & Austin were great brawlers in different ways. Foley was wrestling's premier bump artist, while Austin was just a relentless full speed ahead attacker. Not 100% sold on 'Taker at #3 but I didn't really see any of the strong ECW contenders (Sandman, Funk, Dreamer) enough to put them above the Deadman.\n\nFavorite Wrestler\n\n1. Bret Hart (#4)\n\n2. Owen Hart (#7)\n\n3. British Bulldog\n\n*Hart Foundation 4 Life. And the rest.....\n\n4. Mick Foley (#9)\n\n5. Undertaker (#9)\n\n6. Terry Funk\n\n7. Taz\n\n8. Kane\n\n9. Ric Flair (#6)- Technically cheating. I didn't see any WCW this year but I rooted for Flair from afar more than I rooted for anybody below him.\n\n10. Jerry Lawler\n\n11. Brian Christopher\n\n12. Brian Pillman (#20)\n\n13. Sandman\n\n14. Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart\n\n15. Eliminators\n\n16. Stevie Richards\n\n17. Raven (#14)\n\n18. BWO (Nova & Meanie)\n\n19. Jeff Jarrett\n\n20. Tommy Dreamer\n\n*JJ & Tommy feel like a stretch but I wanted to end on a nice round number and they were better 5/10 options than Snow, Vader, or anybody else\n\nMost Overpushed\n\n1. New Age Outlaws\n\n2. Rocky Maivia\n\n3. Shane Douglas (#9)\n\n*I double checked. NAO & Rocky didn't receive a single vote in RSPW Awards. RSPW was weird. Anyway, Rocky sucked. So did the New Age Outlaws. In fact, their late year push was even more inexplicable to me than Rocky's early year push. Plus I was starting to come around on Rocky as the year ended. ECW was the land of cool moves and cooler characters. Yet the first ECW PPV I ever saw had boring Shane Douglas as the TV Champ and the next had him winning back the ECW Title. Shane Douglas had no cool moves and he was not a cool character. I didn't get it. Still don't.\n\nMost Overrated\n\n*From a fan/magazine perspective.\n\n1. Sabu\n\n*What a bust this guy was. Sabu was to 1997 wrestling what Ryan Leaf was to 1997 football. For the year and a half I had been reading the Apter Mags, they pushed Sabu as Jesus in Genie Pants. So I was naturally beyond hyped to finally see the greatest thing since sliced bread. Well, the first time I saw him he fell off the Raw sign on a botched dive which caused my friend Brandon to laugh so hard he cried. He must have rewound Sabu's botch 20 times that night. The 2nd time I saw him was against Taz at Barely Legal. Now for some 17 months I had been lead to believe Sabu was better than Bret, Shawn, and every new style WCW wrestler combined. I was under the assumption that ECW was Sabu's playground and everybody else there was more or less a ham and egger just living in Sabu's world. Surely Sabu would put away his Monster of the Week in a jaw dropping manner before moving on to his next big challenger. Then Taz won. And kind of easily, at that. Then Sabu turned heel and it was all just really weird. Anyway, I left that show thinking Taz was everything Sabu had been cracked up to be while Sabu himself was.....not so great. The next time I saw Sabu he had a botchfest with Sandman at November To Remember. So, yeah, by the time 1997 ended I thought Sabu was basically the Heath Shuler of wrestling. In the immortal words Sabu's clear superior, Taz.....\n\n\"Fuck Sabu\"- 1997 Baker\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. Bret Hart as wrestling's last hero + leader of the Hart Foundation (#5)\n\n2. 3 Faces of Foley (#1)\n\n3. BWO (#8)\n\n*Honorable mention to Kane & Sandman.\n\nBest Move\n\n1. Total Elimination (#9)\n\n2. Bret Hart's Ringpost Figure Four (#1)\n\n3. Taka's Michinoku Driver (#4)\n\n*Strong Top 3. Total Elimination blew my mind. As did Taka's Michinoku Driver...though it became progressively less cool every time I saw it as it morphed from a sick bodyslam piledriver into more of a sitout bodyslam. Bret's ringpost figure four was so badass. Honorable Mention to Brian Christopher's sick sunset flip powerbomb to the floor and every other cool Eliminators move.\n\nBest Match\n\n1. Canadian Stampede 10 Man Tag (#15)\n\n2. Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker- Hell In A Cell (#1)\n\n3. Davey Boy Smith vs. Owen Hart- European Title Finals (#5)\n\n*GOAT year strikes again. When 1997 started my 3 favorite matches of all time were Flair/Funk- GAB 89, Flair/Vader- Starrcade 93, and....probably Flair/Steamboat- Wrestle War 89. When 1997 ended my 3 favorite matches of all time were the Canadian Stampede 10 Man Tag, HBK/Undertaker- Hell In A Cell, and Owen/DBS- European Title finals. Honorable Mention to Bret/Austin- WM which wouldn't even have placed(!) despite the fact that it would have won in a landslide most years. Fwiw Bret/Austin would've been somewhere between my 4th and 6th favorite match of all time as 1997 ended.\n\nWorst Match\n\n1. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels- Raw 12/22- European Title Match\n\n*Fuck DX. This match was a joke. What made it even worse was Owen & Pillman did the same basic match a million times better earlier in the year. Man, did I ever loathe DX.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. Steve Austin (#1)\n\n2. Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels (#2)\n\n3. Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels (#7)\n\n*Another category, another GOAT in Bret/Austin. All 3 feuds had nuclear heat with myself and the live crowds.\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\n1. New Age Outlaws\n\n2. New Blackjacks\n\n3. FBI (#17)\n\n*There were a lot of bad teams in 1997 but only one of those bad teams was inexplicably pushed to the moon. That team was the New Age Outlaws. Whoever thought \"Let's take the two least over wrestlers on the roster and have them beat everybody with one cheat at the end of the match after getting wrecked for x amount of minutes\" should have been blackballed from the wrestling business. Except in 1998 it turned out that person was a mad wrestling genius. Whoever could have predicted that? New Blackjacks might be the most utterly boring team of all time, while the stupid FBI were very much the New Age Outlaws of ECW. Dishonorable Mention to all Nation, DOA, Los Boricuas, Truth Commission tandems & The Godwinns.\n\nWorst Heel\n\n1. Ahmed Johnson (#1)- Few heel turns are so bad they kill a career. Ahmed's was one of those few.\n\nWorst Babyface\n\n1. Steve Austin (#6)- Somehow acting like the biggest heel ever (or at least since Bad News Brown) made Austin the most popular man in wrestling.\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#8)\n\n2. Steve Austin\n\n3. Faarooq (#12)\n\n*More wrestlers had nuclear heat with me this year than probably any other and this unholy trinity represents the worst of the worst. Dishonorable Mention to HHH, NAO, RVD, Douglas, Shamrock, and everybody involved in Gang Warz except D'Lo & Chainz. Disqualifying WCW since I didn't watch and don't feel like expanding this to a Top 50.\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. Brian Pillman (#15)\n\n2. Goldust (#19)\n\n3. Vader (#12)\n\n*I liked Pillman because Hart Foundation but, man, was he ever a disappointment in the ring. See, I didn't pay all that much attention to in ring prowess during Pillman's prime. I just started caring about that sort of thing when he got injured in early 96. So for over a year all I heard (and saw a little on tape) was how totally awesome Pillman was in the ring. So I was wicked hyped for his return to in ring action in my beloved WWF where he would surely bedazzle all of us WWF rubes. Then he shit the bed every time out with some lousy Road Dogg-level wrestling. Such a disappointment....\n\n*Goldust & Vader deteriorated more as characters/Guys Who Matter than wrestlers. They were my two favorite wrestlers for most of 1996. By the end of that year I had stopped caring about them. Now usually a wrestler in their positions would have garnered some residual good will. Not this time. It was like a switch was flipped and I was instantly done with them. Vader was below Goldust because he won me back for a little while with his awesome Final Four performance but within a few weeks I realized he still wasn't going anywhere and lost interest again. This was a very 1997 phenomenon which also affected '96 faves Snow & Sincere, and guys I was ready to love as '96 ended like Scorpio & Furnas/LaFon. All those acts didn't get a push and I just very quickly lost interest in them. Hell, even Jeff Jarrett's late year return fell victim to this rare malady.\n\nMost Underrated Wrestler\n\n1. Flash Funk (#2)\n\n2. Al Snow/Leif Cassidy (#3)\n\n3. Furnas & LaFon\n\n*WWF never doing anything with Scorpio (I refuse to call him by that other name) was such a bummer. I thought (and still kinda think) he should have gotten Rocky's initial push, or at least a sweet babyface gig helping Ahmed fight the Nation. Instead he started jobbing and pulling B Show duty almost immediately. How sad. Poor Leif had an even weaker '97 than his less-than-stellar '96. It got so bad that even I gave him up on him at some point. I thought Furnas & LaFon were going to revolutionize tag team wrestling the first time I saw them at Survivor Series '96. Surely a tag title reign or three and an all time great feud against Owen & Bulldog filled with multiple **** matches was in the cards for their 1997. Nope. They were jobbing to the Headbangers within months. And then things got worse for them.\n\nWorst Gimmick\n\n1. Gang Warz (#6)\n\n2. Rockabilly (#3)\n\n3. \"Real Double J\" Jesse Jammes (#11)\n\n*All 4 Gangz had go away heat with me. I'll cover them later. Rockabilly & Real Double J were such dated, dead end gimmicks.\n\nWorst Feud\n\n1. Gang Warz (#1)\n\n2. Rockabilly vs. Jesse Jammes (#7)\n\n3. Jerry Lawler vs. George \"The Animal\" Steele\n\n*The Gang Warz between the Nation, DOA, Los Boricuas, and (eventually) Truth Commission gave us a never ending series of heatless DUD matches involving something like 18 wrestlers who all had go away heat (or worse) with me. D'Lo showed potential. I liked Chainz (Brian Lee) because of Apter Mag hype a year earlier. And The Jackyl was a cool character. Everybody else involved in this debacle I wanted to go away.....forever. Rockabilly/Fake JJ was the '97 version of those awful 1996 Superstars feuds like Dumpster/Hopper & Bradshaw/FJ Floyd.....only this one was on Raw & PPV. Lawler/Steele was a thing that happened. It would have sucked way back in 1987 and here we are a decade later with Steele even older and lousier.\n\nMost Disappointing News Item\n\n1. Montreal Screwjob\n\n2. WWF continues to lose the ratings battle\n\n3. Death of Brian Pillman (#1)\n\n*I feel like such a heel for having an actual death 3rd but the first two preyed on me a whole lot more in real time. Montreal Screwjob was the most disappointing wrestling news story of my life until Owen's death. While I died a little inside each and every week when I found out Raw lost to Nitro yet again. Hey, this was Serious Business to 1997 me.\n\nMost Obnoxious Personality\n\n1. Shawn Michaels (#3)\n\n2. Steve Austin\n\n3. Faarooq\n\n*HBK & Austin are all timers here, while race baiting Faarooq had nuclear heat with my friends and I. Honorable Mention to ECW's biggest jerk, RVD.\n\nBest Non-Wrestler\n\n1. Chyna (#1)\n\n2. Jim Cornette (#5)\n\n3. Paul Bearer (#11)\n\n*Chyna as HHH's badass female bodyguard was something completely different and went a long way towards saving Helmsley's career. I was all about Jim Cornette's late '97 Raw rants. So many classic lines in those rants. In fact, they directly led to me buying my first (and only) shoot interview tape. '97 was Bearer's best year. He was such an evil jerk (and even funny at times!) during the long build to Kane's debut.\n\nBest Announcer\n\n1. Jim Ross (#1)\n\n2. Jerry Lawler (#1 Color)\n\n3. Joey Styles (#2)\n\n*For the first of four straight years.\n\nBest on Interviews\n\n1. Bret Hart (#9)\n\n2. Mick Foley (#4)\n\n3. Steve Austin (#1)\n\n*Bret Hart had a GOAT year here too after being only so-so on interviews for much of his career. It was the series of sitdown interviews with JR that made me (re)realize the awesomeness of Mick Foley. Austin edges out Michaels for \"biggest dick\" to claim the 3rd spot. Honorable Mention to Stevie, Raven, Taz, RVD & even Sandman for cutting out of this world promos at Barely Legal. What a great introduction to ECW that show was.\n\nBest Angle\n\n1. Bret Hart forms the Hart Foundation (#1)\n\n2. Three Faces of Foley (#2)\n\n3. Kane is alive (#17)\n\n*Yep. Honorable Mention to Lawler challenges Heyman, ECW shows up on Raw\n\nBest Organization\n\n1. WWF (#1)\n\n2. ECW (#3)\n\nBest TV Show\n\n1. Raw (#1)- Only one I watched regularly this year.\n\nBest Major Show\n\n1. Canadian Stampede (#2)\n\n2. ECW Barely Legal (#1)\n\n*Canadian Stampede is my choice for GOAT ppv. Barely Legal would have won 9 years out of 10. Top 5-10 PPV of all time and the perfect intro to ECW. As for the rest, it was a lot like 1996 where the vast majority of WWF PPVs (and ECW November to Remember) just sort of blend together in that middling 5/10 range.\n\nBest Promotional Move\n\n1. The WCW juggernaut continues to poach talent from WWF & ECW\n\n2. ECW starts running pay per views (#5)\n\n3. Raw goes to two hours (#2)\n\n*Gotta give WCW some rare love. They seemed unstoppable as the year ended.\n\nWorst On Interviews\n\n1. Ahmed Johnson (#1)\n\n2. Jeff Jarrett\n\n*Ahmed is an all timer in this category and my man JJ gets here for cutting the worst shoot promo of the Attitude Era. Shoot promos were the easiest thing in the world to do. They followed a simple 3 step formula any hack should have been able to follow...\n\n1. Rant against the promotion you just left\n\n2. Complain about being held back by The Man\n\n3. Spice it up with a REAL NAME~! or two for added effect\n\nWell, Double J managed to botch THAT with a long, boring shoot promo that just put people to sleep or sent them clicking to Nitro. It was so bad that even I, Double J fan extraordinaire, am out here still bashing it 21 years later. What's even worse is his anti-Austin 3:16 comments in that promo very possibly cost him a big money angle against Stone Cold a few years later. Jarrett's return shoot is in the running for worst promo in wrestling history.\n\nWorst Angle\n\n1. Montreal Screwjob\n\n2. Ahmed joins the Nation (#2)\n\n3. Honkytonk Man's long search for a protege ends with.....Rockabilly (#6)\n\n*Don't know if the Screwjob counts here but it sucked, and I hated it. Ahmed joining the Nation killed his career. The big Rockabilly reveal was like a pauper version of Vince being the Higher Power. I wanted Disco Inferno, dammit!\n\nWorst Organization\n\n1. WCW (#1)\n\nWorst Major Show\n\n1. Survivor Series\n\n*The most depressing pay per view of my life up to that point. Sure, Uncensored '96 was worse, but this one hurt more. The show itself sucked even before the gut punch that was the Screwjob.\n\nWorst Promotional Move\n\n1. WWF screws Bret Hart\n\nMost Charismatic\n\n1. Bret Hart\n\n2. Shawn Michaels\n\n3. Steve Austin\n\n*Yep. Bret at #1 here too. BRET! BRET! BRET! Fwiw, Bret leading the Hart Foundation from his wheelchair was a great visual.\n\nLeast Charismatic\n\n1. Furnas & LaFon- There's a reason these guys never got pushed.\n\nPost by Baker on\n\n1994\n\nThis was a transitional year. It would my last as a Know Nothing diehard casual fan. It's also my least favorite year of that 93-00 Golden Age (but still pretty cool though). Only promotions I watched were WWF & WCW and I mostly stopped watching WCW when it got real bad halfway through the year once Hogan and Friends came in. I also did not see a single PPV, Raw, and possibly no WCW Saturday Night in real time. I'm shooting for a Top 3 and have a feeling things may get weird given my 1994 tastes. Links to the real RSPW Awards are only working for 1 page out of 4 so there won't be much comparing this time around. I'm fairly certain Owen & Mr. Backlund got more votes from me this year than any other wrestler yet in these awards.\n\nWrestler of the Year\n\n1. Bret Hart\n\n2. Hulk Hogan\n\n3. Diesel\n\n*Bret was finally the undisputed man in WWF with a memorable 8 month title reign, while Hogan immediately solidified himself as The Man in WCW by winning their championship in his very first match and retiring previous standard bearer Ric Flair a few months later. Diesel's meteoric rise saw him become only the 3rd man to ever win the WWF Triple Crown, and he did it in a mere 7 months. That's enough to net him the 3rd spot over Flair, Mr. Backlund & Owen.\n\nBest Tag Team\n\n1. Nasty Boys\n\n2. Headshrinkers\n\n3. Quebecers\n\n*Yuck! Look no further if you want to pinpoint the year tag team wrestling fell off the cliff. I did not like the first two teams but they both had fairly lengthy title reigms. Quebecers faded away quickly after they lost the belts to the Headshrinkers but I still have them here over HBK & Diesel because at least the Quebecers were a \"real\" team.\n\nBest Heel\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n3. Lord Steven Regal\n\n*Get used to seeing these three names.\n\nBest Babyface\n\n1. Undertaker\n\n2. Cactus Jack\n\n*The only two babyfaces I was really into this year. Loved Taker's storylines with Yoko & Underfaker, while I was 100% behind Cactus in his feud with those damn Nasty Boys.\n\nBest Worker\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. Bret Hart\n\n3. Ric Flair\n\n*Bret & Flair because the commentators told me so, and Owen because Owen > Bret was my mid-90s mantra.\n\nBest Flyer\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. 1-2-3 Kid\n\n3. Too Cold Scorpio\n\nBest Technical Wrestler\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. Bret Hart\n\n3. Either Lord Steven Regal or Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n*Commentary told us Bret was the king of technical wrestling. But I was all Owen > Bret. Regal & Backlund had commentary hype + at least one stellar match a piece where they got to show off their technical skillz.\n\nBest Brawler\n\n1. Razor Ramon\n\n2. Diesel\n\n3. Undertaker\n\n*Thinking for myself. Hooray! Pretty sure this was the same wrestlers in the same order as my 1995 ballot.\n\nFavorite Wrestler\n\n1. Owen Hart\n\n2. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n3. Undertaker\n\n*Loved all 3 guys. Shooting for 20, as is the norm from 93-00. This list really fades after #5 or #6 with a whole lot of 7/10 guys making it this year a few spots higher than they would in a normal Golden Age year (aside from '97). No Terry Funk because I weirdly have no recollection of his 1994 WCW run. Guess I'd already been Hogan'ed away by the time he came in.\n\n4. Lord Steven Regal\n\n5. Jeff Jarrett\n\n6. Ric Flair\n\n7. Jerry Lawler\n\n8. Quebecers\n\n9. Shawn Michaels\n\n10. Diesel\n\n11. Cactus Jack\n\n12. Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz\n\n13. Underfaker\n\n14. King Kong Bundy\n\n15. Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart\n\n16. IRS\n\n17. Maxx Payne\n\n18. Texicans\n\n19. Yokozuna\n\n20. Tatanka\n\nMost Improved Wrestler\n\n1. Diesel\n\n2. Owen Hart\n\n3. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n*Very strong year here. All 3 guys had 1998 Rock levels of improvement. Diesel started the year as a silent bodyguard who didn't wrestle much, used a lame punch for a finisher, and was the first man eliminated in his Survivor Series 93 match. By November he had capped off a meteoric rise by winning the WWF Championship, becoming only the 3rd wrestler to ever win the prestigious WWF Triple Crown. He did this all in 7 months. Owen transformed from a lower card JTTS, and the wrestler on the roster I was most likely to forget, into a main eventer, and my 2nd favorite wrestler of all time. Mr. Bob Backlund went from a lovable loser to a middle aged and crazy psycho who shocked the world by regaining the WWF Championship that was unfairly stolen from him over a decade earlier.\n\nBest Gimmick\n\n1. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n2. Owen Hart\n\n3. Lord Steven Regal\n\n*Yep. These three again. Honorable Mention to Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz and both Undertaker's.\n\nBest Move\n\n1. Crossface Chickenwing\n\n*The only wrestling move ever publicly banned from my school. It was glorious.\n\n2. Tombstone Piledriver\n\n3. Razor's Edge\n\nBest Match\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund- Superstars 7/30\n\n2. Ric Flair vs. Lord Steven Regal- WCW Worldwide- Marquis of Queensbury Series Match #5- 5/28\n\n3. Underfaker vs. Tatanka- Superstars 7/9\n\n*Didn't see any pay per views in real time this year. Bret/Backlund is the greatest match in Superstars history and one of the few pre-1995 matches that I knew was \"good\" despite not really knowing what 'good wrestling' was. The awesome post-match angle is just icing on the cake. The Marquis of Queensbury Series was a cool little concept. This was the deciding match. I did not like Flair going over Regal in His Lordship's specialty match though. It was a little too Hulk Hogan for my liking. That's not who Ric Flair is. Even in 1994 I knew this. Underfaker/Tatanka was a match I remembered liking that held up shockingly well when I rewatched it a year or two ago. Honorable Mention to Razor vs. Black Phantom (Gangrel) from Superstars. It's one of those random jobber matches I always remembered. Highlight is Phantom breaking out this sweet 2nd rope DDT. Pretty wild for 1994 WWF.\n\nBest Feud\n\n1. Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart\n\n2. Bret Hart vs. Mr. Bob Backlund\n\n3. Undertaker vs. Underfaker\n\n*Bret/Owen is an all timer and I was super into the other two in real time. Honorable Mentions to Razor vs. Diesel & HBK, which lasted most of the year, and Nasty Boys vs. Cactus and Friends.\n\nWorst Wrestler\n\n1. Doink\n\n2. Hacksaw Jim Duggan\n\n3. Bastion Booger\n\n*All 3 guys were terrible and embarrassing but let's talk about Honorable Mention- Bunkhouse Buck for a minute. I had never seen 70s wrestling but in my head 70s wrestling was Bunkhouse Buck. Just a bunch of old, shady uncle-looking dudes scoring pinfalls off of punches. So I naturally thought 70s wrestling sucked. Speaking of suck, I called him Bunkhouse Suck and thought that was very clever. See also: Bam Bam Bigelow as \"The Bust From The East\" or \"The Least From The East.\"\n\nWorst Tag Team\n\n1. Nasty Boys\n\n2. Well Dunn\n\n3. Bushwhackers\n\n*Yep. Nastys were the best and the worst lol. Nasty Boys were the worst pushed tag team (even though '94 was probably their best year in reality). Well Dunn was garbage on multiple levels. And I'm not even 100% sure the 'Whackers wrestled on tv in 1994 but I'm assuming they did since those turds showed up a few times every year to stink up the joint with their idiotic antics. If they didn't, throw Pretty Wonderful in their spot. They were so boring. Only Paul Roma could bring Arn down to his level one year and Mr. Wonderful down to his level the next. That dude was the worst.\n\nLeast Favorite Wrestler\n\n1. Bret Hart\n\n2. Hulk Hogan\n\n3. Doink\n\n*Bret Hart feuded with Owen & Mr. Backlund. Of course I loathed him. Hogan killed my interest in WCW....and not for the last time. Doink gets the nod over Razor, Luger, Booger, Dumpster, Duggan, Nastys, and others of that ilk. Can't believe Razor (and Ahmed) never even cracked the Top 3 in this category. I hated those guys!\n\nMost Deteriorated Wrestler\n\n1. Bobby Eaton- Poor Beautiful Bobby. From a longtime upper carder to a jobber with music. How sad.\n\nMost Underrated Wrestler\n\n1. The Patriot\n\n2. Bobby Eaton\n\n3. Texicans\n\n*Let's talk about The Patriot for a minute. The first time I saw Patriot in 1991(?) Global I was convinced this dude was the future of wrestling. We're talking next Hulk Hogan, brother. And I was ok with that! I have a distinct memory of this happening. I already had a pretty good understanding of how wrestling worked and it was so obvious that Patriot was the perfect early 90s good guy. He was patriotic, jacked, pretty athletic, and the mask would have sold like gangbusters. In short, he was $$$$. I kept waiting and waiting for Vince to bring this guy in and push him to the moon over all my favorites while the millions....and millions roared their approval. Yet it never happened. So he finally turns up in WCW and I'm like \"Well, there's the next WCW world champ.\" He immed"
