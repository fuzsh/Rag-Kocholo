        "text": "With the excruciatingly titled The Divergent Series Insurgent upon us -- and already garnering terrible reviews even before one of those shameless audience-hating cash-grab two-parters -- it's probably time to talk about the slightly mystifying rise of its leading lady Shailene Woodley. While she's certainly easy to look at (but aren't most actors?) that doesn't really explain the career. I've been mostly quiet about this because I'm aiming for positivity in 2015 but I believe I'm developing a severe allergy.\n\nLet's discuss why and her six major performances (How many have you seen?) after the jump...\n\nAnd no, it's not because of her repeated dissing of feminism. Lots of people (including myself) have said and ocassionally still say excruciatingly stupid things. Foot-in-mouth disease is especially prevalent in human beings when they are adolescents or early 20somethings before they've had to really, you know, grow up and experience the world and suffer the consequences of saying stupid things that other people hear. They say that fame freezes your emotional development in whatever age range you become famous, which is bad news for child and teen stars (and history is full of tragic stories there) since there's no really impetus for getting educated and no ability to see the world as it is since that distorting bubble of celebrity (fame, money, \"yes people\") is powerful.\n\nBut Shailene's embarrassing and damaging dismissal of feminism isn't the reason for the allergy. I didn't understand the fuss when The Descendants nearly netted her an Oscar nomination though I concede she had some good moments. But mostly I remain shocked to this day that her listless entitled deeply unsympathetic work in The Secret Lives of The American Teenager in which she only mustered about three expressions over 121 hours* launched a significant career. But I've been trying to learn to love her since it appears she's here to stay. The Spectacular Now, by roughly a billion times her best performance, did force me to reconsider and she was good if not award-worthy in The Fault in Our Stars. Will she improve as she goes? Do you enjoy her or loathe her (she already seems polarizing)\n\nHow many of her six** Insurgent-previous performances have you seen?\n\n* I did not watch all 121 episodes of this show but The Boyfriend bingewatched it for inexplicable reasons a year ago so I saw many episodes at least in the background and every single time I paid attention I was horrified that she was performing every scene in every episode in every season the exact same way.\n\n**She actually made her film debut much earlier than The Descendants in a festival flick called \"Moolah\" but it was never released as far as I can tell.\n\nI like her (as an actor... I don't really read many interviews with actors which probably helps preserve my affection for any number of talented cloth-heads). She's very good at suggesting interiority without appearing to do much and capably anchors the emotional beats of any given story while sometimes gently complicating them. She's also pretty good at showing thinking.\n\nI don't really get the animus toward her beyond her comments on feminism, and her rise is hardly a mystery - she gave a performance lots of people liked in an oscar-nominated film followed by a really fantastic performance in a well-reviewed film, then scored the lead in two giant hits. It's basically the same route Jennifer Lawrence took. Who you or I happen to like more or find more interesting is immaterial.\n\nShe's great in 'The Spectacular Now' and very good in 'The Fault in Our Stars' (and seriously, is whether or not something is 'award-worthy' really how we have to talk about performances all the time? I wouldn't have handed her a prize, but that doesn't mean it doesn't represent thoughtful, diligent and effective work, and I hate to denigrate things simply for not being podium finishers), and she's manages to sell the absurd social structures and emotional through-line of 'Divergent' against pretty considerable odds. She's also very interesting, moment to moment, in 'White Bird in a Blizzard'. And she's only made six films, so her hit rate to me seems pretty high so far. But then, I haven't seen 'Secret Life...', and I don't read her interviews.\n\nI've only seen her in The Descendants and thought she was perfectly good in it (crying! While swimming in a pool! That ain't easy, folks). And while her comments on feminism are incredibly ignorant and irritating, the way she handles inane fashion and women's magazines is pretty hilarious and gutsy. I just love how she rejects their cliche, superficial, lazy questions, although this also translates to coming off completely over it on the red carpet. Shailene, it's really not that big of an inconvenience to throw on some beautiful clothes (they don't all have to be gowns if you don't like gowns! There's a whole world of fashion out there! Look at KStew and how she adopts her style to each event) to promote the films you're getting millions of dollars to appear in.\n\nSo there are some pros and cons with her, but I'd really like to see more of her work to get a better handle on her.\n\nI don't know Shailene personally, so I'm not going to be so bold as to comment on what type of human being she is, especially compared to another actress who I don't know, but she was very good in The Spectacular Now. I can kind of take or leave everything else, but I thought she was so natural and unaffected and realistically adolescent in The Spectacular Now. I would have taken her in supporting actress over a couple of the people who ended up getting nominated that year, actually.\n\nI don't really get all the acclaim she got for The Descendants, but I generally have a blind spot where praise for that film is concerned. I think not getting that Oscar nomination was actually really good for her career. I suspect the subsequent backlash had she gotten it would have been significant. I dunno. It's not a case where I'm dumbfounded to the point of frustration about why she's being cast in things. Both she and her career are very young, so I'm open to having my mind changed about her. As it stands, other than The Spectacular Now, I haven't been hugely impressed.\n\nBut Shailene has also been confused by numerous wings of feminism that have many different approaches and beliefs. For instance, Gloria Steinem and Camille Paglia are both self-proclaimed feminists, yet with extremely different viewpoints and approaches. So when you're a young woman being asked about the term, you are exposed to all these different wings of feminism, and maybe you don't subscribe to certain ones, so you choose not to identify and instead be a person. The obsession with identity politics is problematic too, and Shailene is simply saying that she doesn't want to be labeled. I don't see the problem with that, and in fact admire her for explaining her point of view and accepting that others won't agree instead of apologizing like every other celebrity. She also has a GREAT point about outrage and how most people spend more time on what public figures say than the atrocities in the world.\n\nI think the misunderstanding is that although feminism means equality between men and women, it really isn't that simple in practice and there are many different sects of feminism that often don't agree with one another. Some, like Shailene, might not want to say they're a feminist so they don't have to be lumped with a certain sect they disagree with.\n\nHaving said all of that her best performance still is The Spectacular Now.\n\nDon't know if anyone remembers this, but in the early aughts (somewhere around 2001-2004) she was making the rounds in a bunch of television shows, making guest appearances on The District, Without a Trace, Cold Case, Jack & Bobby and most notably The O.C. (she was Marissa Cooper's little sister Kaitlin, before the character got sent to boarding school and came back portrayed by Willa Holland in Season 3). So, it's funny to see her as such a big star right now when I remember her as this pre-teen girl who would pop up on telelvision, pretty much everywhere.\n\nAs for her current roles, I haven't watched The Divergent Series and only saw a couple of episodes of Secret Life, but I've seen the rest of her movies, and I can see why she's been called upon to be a star. If nothing else, she has enough charisma to carry a movie and is believable whether she's called upon to be innocent and naive (The Spectacular Now), a mess (The Descendants, though I feel like the script didn't give her a chance to demonstrate what it says this character is like), or battling hopelessness (The Fault in Our Stars). She'll probably follow the same route as Kristen Stewart, once she's done with these franchises that are getting her money, she'll do some more risky projects (and, folks around here really need to see Clouds of Sils Maria to see what I'm talking about with KStew, she's terrific in that)..."
