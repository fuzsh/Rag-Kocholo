        "text": "The following remarks were given by Suzanne Vega at LOA’s 40th anniversary gala reception on May 1, 2023. For more on the event, including videos, photos, and transcripts of featured speeches, click here.\n\nI’ll speak for a few minutes about my longstanding love for the great Southern writer Carson McCullers. I was attending Barnard College, studying English literature and theater. I was given an assignment of choosing a person who was no longer alive from the world of the arts and coming in the next day dressed as that person and ready to answer questions as though I were on TV.\n\nI worked many jobs back then, and one was as an assistant librarian, where I put books back on the shelves after they had been borrowed (if I wasn’t sitting on the floor reading them). This was in the 1970s, and the wonderful biography of Carson McCullers by Virginia Spencer Carr had just been released. I was struck by the portrait on the cover. It was of a tall, boyish girl with blunt-cut bangs, a little jacket, a Brooks Brothers shirt, with the saddest eyes I had ever seen. I remembered this image and sought out the book.\n\nI had only read one piece of writing by Carson McCullers at that time. It was called “Sucker.” It was a short story about two boys. One seeks the love and friendship of the other, who treats him badly and calls him “Sucker.” Over the course of the story, the tide turns the other way.\n\nI love her because she was tough and yet so fragile and needy, and sometimes cruel in her private life. And we need her work today more than ever.\n\nI thought it was a great story. I couldn’t wait to read more of this guy, Carson McCullers, whoever he was. But here she was, on the cover of this 700-page biography. I took the book out of the library and read as much as I could overnight. I picked out a little jacket and then bought a pack of cigarettes and swaggered into class the next morning, ready to field questions.\n\nHer gin-drinking, smoking, bisexual persona was heady stuff for a nineteen-year-old, and I ended up writing a half-hour one-woman show based on her life and her work as my senior thesis in 1981. This was way before my first record deal.\n\nThis was a project I revisited throughout the decades. The play Carson McCullers Talks About Love came out in 2011. I rewrote the whole thing, and the final version of the play was called Lover Beloved, and that had its premiere in 2018 in Houston, Texas. It was made into a film directed by Michael Tully in 2019.\n\nI have always found Carson McCullers to be a singularly modern sensibility, regardless of what era I was working in. I love her for her compassion, her empathy, her eye for detail, especially regarding children. And I love her for her unsentimentality. I love her for her prescient vision of the Civil Rights era back in 1940 in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, published when she was only twenty-three years old. I love her because she was tough and yet so fragile and needy, and sometimes cruel in her private life. And we need her work today more than ever.\n\nNow I’d like to amuse you, hopefully. I’m going to pretend that this song is actually a dramatic monologue, and I’m going to tell you all about McCullers’s feelings about other writers of her generation, and especially about Harper Lee. This is meant to be a tribute, and even though Carson McCullers could be very shy and very humble, she also sang her own praises very well. So I’d like to do that for you now:\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nShe leaves me cold\n\nI recognize the genius\n\nBut I’m twice as bold\n\nI have more to say\n\nThan Hemingway\n\nLord knows, compared to Faulkner\n\nI say it in a better way\n\nGraham Greene\n\nHe loves me\n\nHe loves my poetic\n\nSensibility\n\nKatherine Anne Porter\n\nMight be the best one now\n\nBut in about a year\n\nI’m gonna show her how\n\nYes I will\n\nSaid to Reeves the other day\n\nProust really is the man\n\nWho comforts me in a way\n\nNo other writer can\n\nThe timeless quality of the work\n\nThe length! Is very long\n\nBelieve me Marcel Proust goes on\n\nAnd on and on and on.\n\nOh, Harper. Harper\n\nLee. Lee. Lee\n\nShe only wrote that one book\n\nI’ve written more than three\n\nDarling Tennessee Williams\n\nIt’s anybody’s guess\n\nWhy Streetcar made millions\n\nAnd Wedding so much less\n\nI will forever be pondering that one\n\nOh, Harper. Harper\n\nLee. Lee. Lee\n\nWhy do they always compare her to me\n\nTo me\n\nWon’t even talk about\n\nEudora Welty\n\nAs for F. Scott, my Sad Café\n\nIs greater than his Gatsby\n\nI’m just telling you\n\nWhat someone told me they read\n\nI never look at my reviews\n\nThey might give me the big head\n\nNow Truman Capote was hypnotized\n\nMesmerized. Cause he realized\n\nThat I knew that he knew\n\nThat he had plagiarized\n\nMy cadences!\n\nImagine his surprise,\n\nYou’ll see it in his eyes\n\nWhen I win that Nobel Prize\n\nThank you. Thank you so very much\n\nHarper. Harper\n\nLee. Lee. Lee\n\nWhy do they always compare her to me\n\nTo me\n\nShe always seems to be receiving\n\nMore than she deserves\n\nHoney, she’s poaching on\n\nMy literary preserves\n\nYes from Harper Lee\n\nWe have seen and we’ve heard and\n\nI’d like to kill more than just\n\nThat mocking bird\n\nYou know, sometimes I really would\n\nSo you just wait until next year\n\nSuzanne Vega’s critically acclaimed songs have been international chart-toppers, including her distinctive and instantly recognizable classics “Marlene on the Wall,” “Luka,” and “Tom’s Diner.” She has released nine studio albums, among them Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers, based on the one-woman play Carson McCullers Talks About Love, which she wrote and starred in, with music by Duncan Sheik. Her book The Passionate Eye collects lyrics, poems, and journalism. She is a longtime Library of America subscriber.\n\nExplore Further\n\nRelated Writers:"
