        "text": "Bartram is a tattoo artist who lives in Encinitas.\n\nDo you want to break into the tattoo business? Here is a list of things you need to seriously ponder before making the leap into this corner of the strange and tantalizing world of self-employment — or into self-employment in general.\n\nEveryone’s path into the tattoo world is different, but getting an apprenticeship and learning under a seasoned tattooer will be far more advantageous than trying to learn on your own. As far as actually getting an apprenticeship, here are a few to-the-point pointers:\n\nStart by finding a shop you like and get tattooed by everyone there. This will help establish a rapport with the staff, and show your commitment and tenacity.\n\nHang out, bring your portfolio of drawings/paintings, and, for extra points, bring cookies and/or coffee! We love snacks.\n\nDo not talk about tattooing out of your house or practicing on your friends. Telling a professional that you “bought a tattoo machine kit off Amazon to zap friends for fun, but it turned out pretty sick” is a mega-bummer for professionals. It’s like telling a doctor that you’re “pretty sure” you know what you have because you looked some stuff up on WebMD. Just don’t.\n\nDon’t give up. Or do, as that is a good way to weed out people who aren’t actually dedicated to the craft.\n\nIf you’re still reading this, consider yourself seriously interested. I encourage anyone who wishes to get into tattooing (or any avenue of self-employment) to also consider these factors first and foremost:\n\nHealth insurance: How much will health insurance cost and what kind of plan do you want/need? Paying for health insurance out of pocket is not cheap. For example, I am a 33-year-old healthy female with no preexisting conditions, and I pay $450 a month. And, no, that doesn’t include dental or vision coverage.\n\nTaxes: How much do you need to put aside for taxes on a monthly basis? Taxes are not taken out of each paycheck as we do not receive paychecks. We pay the shop out on a nightly or weekly basis and thus are solely responsible for allotting a percentage for taxes. I myself keep a separate bank account just for this purpose. I put in $500 a month, and at the end of the tax season, I write a check to Uncle Sam and watch it all disappear into the ether.\n\nEmergency moolah: How much do you need to put aside on a monthly basis for bills, emergencies, health issues preventing you from working, vacation, etc.? Sole proprietors do not receive sick or vacation pay, so again, it is up to the individual to decide if it is smart to set aside money each month to pay themselves from in case of an emergency or vacation time. There are specific insurance companies like Aflac that offer policies to cover these situations. Depending on what kind of shop you work at, they offer group rates which can be much more affordable.\n\nRetirement: How do you plan on saving for retirement? Unlike most full-time jobs that offer retirement plans with employer contributions, being self-employed means that you are exclusively responsible for setting money aside to hopefully even be able to retire one day. (I’m a millennial, so let’s be real, that ain’t happening). I personally use a Vanguard Roth IRA. I put in $300 a month, and honestly I should be putting in more, but my goal is to up it to $500 a month by the time I’m 35.\n\nEnd of career: If you don’t make it to retirement, what will you do if you have to quit tattooing (or, again, whatever your self-employed job is)? Tattooing is a very physically demanding job and the likelihood that you’ll eventually get shaky hands or a messed-up back is high. Or perhaps you have diabetes and you lose your eyesight. (Sounds crazy, but I know three tattooers to whom this has happened.) What’s your backup plan?\n\nI say all of this not to deter anyone looking to get into tattooing, but I am acutely worried about the aging tattooer population. I do not want to see my friends not be able to support themselves and their families down the road. Heck, I don’t want to find myself in such a position. But with the foresight and tools to sufficiently set yourself up to succeed in this industry, it is possible. By all means, follow your dreams, but take the time to make sure you can live them, too. And, don’t forget, bring snacks."
