Originality, seminal achievements, and lasting cultural impact are quite unique. Much more common characteristics in the history of television are replication, repetition, and overexposure of the innovative concepts/themes/genres that emerge periodically. These “hot” trends in programming ebb and flow in popularity and prevalence, but they rarely disappear completely or permanently. Examples in these broad trends/genres in TV history include westerns, variety shows, game shows, sitcoms, character-driven dramas (police, medical, legal, etc.), and, most recently and persistently, the ubiquitous “reality show.” 2 Over the first decade and a half of the twenty-first century, it has become increasingly evident that reality programming has acquired permanence as a standard television genre. The incessant proliferation of reality programming over the last fifteen years has been widely posited by scholars, cultural commentators, and critics as a seminal wave breaking on the shores of American popular culture. Nonetheless, while the intensity and scope of this reality immersion is unprecedented for the genre, it is not the first reality surge to hit the cultural shores; it is just the largest and most recent. vii\n\nviii\n\nP REFA CE\n\nOn the whole, scholars, journalists, fans, casual observers of television, and those within the industry have a reasonably accurate knowledge of the shows that established a genre or began a trend in programming. Consequently, members of these informed groups associate the variety show with Texaco Star Theater (1948–1956) or The Ed Sullivan Show (1948–1971); and the sitcom is eternally linked with I Love Lucy (1951–1957), The Honeymooners (1955–1956), or, for some, The Beverly Hillbillies (1962–1971), which touched off a 1960s inundation of sitcoms, as the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s each had their own reinvigorating sitcoms. Similar connections are made with the medical show (Ben Casey [1961–1966] and Dr. Kildare [1961–1966]); the game show (What’s My Line? [1950–1967] or The $64,000 Question [1955–1958]); the police show (Dragnet [1951–1959], Gangbusters [1952], or The Naked City [1958–1963]); and the legal drama (Perry Mason [1957–1966] or The Defenders [1961–1965]). 3 As the above brief survey of shows indicates, there are easily identifiable programs that mark the emergence of a new creative form or era in virtually all genres of television. However, there is one genre, the reality show, in which the seminal program is misunderstood, misrepresented, or completely ignored. Consequently, the central goal of this book is to address this deficit by establishing the National Broadcasting Company’s (NBC) Real People (1979–1984) as the prototypical and most influential program in the first wave of reality programming from the early 1980s into the early 1990s. Illustrative of the impact of Real People is the spate of imitators that followed in the subsequent decade. Programs such as Speak Up America, That’s Incredible, The People’s Court, and a wide array of PM Magazine–style offerings rode the wake of Real People’s popularity to varying degrees of success. In the process, the economic and artistic viability of reality programming was confirmed. A more substantive analysis of Real People reveals an unrecognized or unacknowledged link with reality-themed programming that has gone unbroken for more than thirty years. In essence, Real People is the Rosetta Stone of contemporary reality TV. Within it, one can see the revelation of subgenres of reality programming that are presently indispensable to the format. Whether the unique/intense occupation, the inspirational overachiever, the eccentric collector, the allegedly talented performer, or the just plain weird, Real People featured “everyday” characters that would not be celebrated anywhere else on television. 4\n\nPRE FACE\n\nix\n\nA quick perusal of the fundamental exemplars of modern reality TV programming (Cops, Deadliest Catch, Ice Road Truckers, Pawn Stars, Duck Dynasty, Ghost Hunters, America’s Funniest Home Videos, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, etc.) exposes the genetic link between Real People and the contemporary crop of reality shows. In point of fact, the wave of reality programming initiated and inspired by Real People has never ended. Though Real People was canceled in 1984, realitythemed programming did not disappear; the genre flourished in national syndication, and increasingly dotted the landscape of network programming in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, for a variety of reasons, Real People has not received the credit it is due, even though there has been a sizable collection of scholarship produced on reality television.\n\nTHE NARROW VIEW OF REALITY Though there is an increasing volume of analysis of reality TV, a purely historical view of the evolution of the genre has been overshadowed by work in other academic fields. There has been excellent scholarship done in the behavioral sciences focusing on the sociological or psychological aspects of the content in reality shows and the impact on the audience. The liberal arts and humanities have carved out a niche focusing on specific constituencies and their representations in the genre, with extensive work done on issues associated with gender, race, LGBT, and socioeconomic themes. Additionally, in what appears to be an understandable grasp at relevance, many of the studies focus exclusively on contemporary shows—those that were recently or still are on the air—with only a cursory nod to the origins of the genre. Prominent works in the field include Susan Murray and Laurie Ouellette’s Reality TV: Remaking Television Culture; Misha Kavka’s Reality TV; Kristie Bunton and Wendy Wyatt’s The Ethics of Reality TV; and Leigh H. Edwards’ The Triumph of Reality TV. 5 The above studies in the behavioral sciences or the humanities do not fundamentally require an in-depth appreciation of the origins of reality TV to be successful. However, in a historical analysis, a more accurate understanding of the roots of the genre will prove both necessary and useful, particularly given the ubiquity of reality TV and the likelihood that the genre is here to stay.\n\nx\n\nP REFA CE\n\nBefore credit can be assigned for the creation and popularization of reality-themed programming, several structural issues have to be addressed. To begin with, what is the definition of a reality TV show? By 2014, the genre has been stretched and manipulated so strenuously by American television broadcasters that almost any program with non-performers as featured characters, or even shows with professional performers trying to act like real people, can be classed as reality TV. The result is an epidemic of quasi-reality genres such as the washed-up celebrity show, the semi-scripted reali-dramas, and various talent and game-showstyle competitions. All of these categories have clearly reached the tipping point of narrative manipulation. Thus, the artistic result is a manifest by-product of scripting, as opposed to detached observation and documentation. A more purist definition of reality TV is delineated by Richard Crew, in his study of PM Magazine: “People portraying themselves, recorded at least in part in their living or working environment, recorded without a script, with events placed in a narrative context and the primary purpose being viewer entertainment.” 6 At this point in American culture, the pure form of reality TV has been obfuscated by the quasi-reality, ultrasensationalist fare. However, the primordial core of reality TV can still be traced to the era of Real People. The second question to be addressed is, what constitutes a “wave” or dominant trend in television programming? There is a distinct difference between sporadic or isolated programming in a specific genre and the development of an escalating trend that becomes a standardized genre. A prime exemplar of this can be seen in the development of the made-forTV film. Made-for-television films had appeared sporadically and successfully as early as 1964. Nonetheless, it was not until 1970, with the popularity of the American Broadcasting Company’s (ABC) Movie of the Week, that the TV movie began to proliferate, ultimately becoming a standard programming format. Thus, the ABC Movie of the Week is credited with creating the wave or trend. 7 A similar chain of events occurred in the reality genre. As the forthcoming introduction will elucidate, there were sporadic examples of highly celebrated reality-themed programs from the 1950s into the 1970s. With the arguable exception of a certain brand of game show in the late 1970s, there was no continuum of realitythemed shows in the subsequent era. In fact, the reality show was virtually nonexistent in the 1970s. The cultural wave or continuing trend of\n\nPRE FACE\n\nxi\n\nreality TV began with the success of Real People in 1979, and the clones that followed in its wake, up to the present day.\n\nTHE USUAL SUSPECTS The reality genre is not without purported candidates for the title of original, seminal, or catalytic reality show. In the last two decades, several programs have emerged, both in academia and the general public, as candidates for the designation. Three shows that are consistently cited are Candid Camera (1948–1950, 1960–1967), An American Family (1973), and The Real World (1992–). While all three of these shows were successful and culturally significant, their links with the origins of the reality genre can be tenuous. Candid Camera was a hidden-camera program featuring unsuspecting everyday citizens being filmed in often unusual, occasionally exasperating, but almost always funny situations manufactured by the show’s production team. At the peak of the subject’s frustration and/or incredulity, the show’s host, Allen Funt, would appear to relieve the comic tension by telling them they were on Candid Camera, and instructing them to “smile” for the hidden cameras. The set-up subjects and circumstances, coupled with the anticipated “reveal,” were hugely popular with audiences in the early 1960s, producing a top ten rated program. The popular appeal of Candid Camera was built on two principles. The first of these was the “what would you do?” factor. The scenarios made it easy for viewers to imagine how they would act if placed in a similar setup. No matter how outlandish or contrived the scenarios, viewers enjoyed placing themselves in the shoes of the unsuspecting victims. The second founding principle of the show was very basic: make people laugh, though not exclusively at the expense of the subjects. Unlike many modern variants, the purpose of the show was not to expose its participants to physically threatening situations, nor was it to hold people up to scorn or ridicule. To produce these benign laughs, Candid Camera relied on skilled writers such as William Saroyan, Woody Allen, Pat McCormick, and Fannie Flagg. 8 The fact that many of the scenarios required actors delivering scripted or improvised dialogue, in addition to the occasionally elaborate set decorations, works to dilute the purity of Candid Camera’s reality status. The\n\nxi i\n\nP REFA CE\n\nshow is clearly dependent upon non-performers for its content; nonetheless, the situations in which people were placed were not genuine, but fabricated and manipulated. Thematically, Candid Camera lies somewhere between an elaborate sociological experiment and the more modern practical-joke programs, for example, Music Television’s (MTV) Punk’d. Furthermore, there was uniqueness of form, almost a trademarked quality in Candid Camera that made it difficult to re-create artistically, without looking like a blatant counterfeit. Consequently, it did not produce a collection of immediate imitators, and did not give birth to a reality trend or wave. Another of the purported cornerstones of modern reality programming is the Public Broadcasting Service’s (PBS) creation An American Family. Originally broadcast from January through March of 1973, the series was a hybrid, a traditional documentary infused with a cinema verité style. The show orbited around the Loud family of Santa Barbara, California, who allowed their personal lives and relationships to be filmed, edited, and presented in twelve episodes. The show struck a chord with its audience, due in large part to the intimate details exposed about the family. The families’ revelations, including alcohol abuse, marital infidelity, divorce, and even emerging homosexuality, were not uncommon in 1973. However, using a real family, one with which viewers came to be familiar and likely empathized, added a measure of tension and drama that scripted fiction rarely achieves. There is no doubt that the Louds and their family travails were real, but was it reality TV? At the time, the show was framed by a variety of labels: documentary, cinema verité, nonfiction entertainment, and actuality. Reality TV did not exist in 1973; and An American Family would not create the genre. Though celebrated and widely discussed, the television industry would not act on the popularity of the series by producing similar reality-themed programming in the mid-1970s. An American Family stands alone in its time as a cultural phenomenon, but it did not create or promote the reality genre. It is evident that the claims of origination for the show are a result of recategorization, two decades later, after the reality genre had become standard fare. 9 One of the reasons An American Family is often cited as the foundational reality show can be found in its similarity to another of the programs regularly credited with starting a wave of reality programming, The Real World (1992). A creation of MTV, The Real World utilized the\n\nPRE FACE\n\nxiii\n\nintimate surveillance theme; but rather than filming a family, the show would assemble a group of strangers to live together in a well-equipped home. The producers of the show, Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, cast the program with disparate and often combustible characters chosen selectively, with an eye toward potential drama, tension, and romance. Consequently, supporters of The Real World cannot legitimately proclaim it to be pure reality, considering the overt manipulation of cast and setting. In most seasons of the show, the cast were people who would not have been living together were it not for the television production. Nonetheless, the conflicts created within the show are representative of those found in the actual real world, so there are aspects of realism in the show. At the very least, The Real World deserves credit, or blame depending on one’s perspective, for popularizing the contrived and manipulated reality show (e.g., Big Brother [2000], Survivor [2000], The Apprentice [2004]). However, even as The Real World was being conceived in the early 1990s, reality programs flourished on the major broadcast networks and in national syndication, and had been doing so since the early 1980s. The Real World receives and deserves much credit for inspiring the reality programming that followed in the 1990s and beyond, particularly in the arena of cable television. Nonetheless, to suggest that it is the seminal reality show, or mark it as the beginning of the reality trend, ignores more than a decade of reality-themed programming that preceded it. In fact, as The Real World was broadening and reimagining the genre, the ripples of the first wave of reality programming initiated by Real People were still lapping at the cultural shore. 10\n\nTHE LARGER REAL WORLD Beyond the effort to establish Real People as the genesis of the reality genre, this study also explores the milieu in which the show flourished, an era of dramatic transition for both the television industry and larger American society. When Real People premiered in 1979, television was beginning a radical transformation that would not only alter the economics of the industry, but also influence programming and creative decisions. The three major American television networks, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), ABC, and NBC, were facing major chal-\n\nxi v\n\nP REFA CE\n\nlenges from emerging technologies, most notably home video games, home video devices (Betamax, VCR, videodisc, etc.), and cable television. By the time Real People ended its run in 1984, 35 percent of the nation’s homes had video devices, and the networks had to compete with major cable channels such as Home Box Office, Showtime, Turner Broadcasting System, the Cable News Network, ESPN, Bravo, Nickelodeon, and the Disney Channel. Additionally, federal deregulation of the media produced a surge in the number of independent television stations across the nation, thus increasing the volume of competing local and syndicated programming, and further fragmenting the audience. Consequently, throughout the 1980s, the major networks began to lose an increasing share of the television audience. The smaller network audiences resulted in declining revenue, as advertisers began to spread their commercials around to other broadcast entities, creating competition the big three networks had never before faced. Unfortunately, for the networks, just as their profits began to decline, the cost of producing television shows was increasing dramatically. These economic factors would be compounded by the late 1980s, when NBC, CBS, and ABC were acquired by non-entertainment conglomerates that had a bottom-line management style and massive debt to pay off. 11 In light of these distressing factors, the ratings success of Real People and its reality spawn created an enticing opportunity. Network and independent television producers hoping to cut costs found reality programming less expensive, due to the lack of the high-priced actors and writers with which they normally had to contend. Thus, they had the same ratings potential as scripted programs, with significantly lower production costs and higher profit margins. 12 Real People had established the viability of the reality genre, creating the economic and creative model for future reality shows. The achievements of Real People and its reality brethren also began to permeate other aspects of television programming. For many, the most alarming aspect of this development was what many called the “softening” of TV news, or what some came to derisively call “infotainment.” Prior to the late 1970s and early 1980s, local and network news would regularly feature what were known as human interest stories, or feel-good news. For example, the CBS network news had veteran TV news journalist Charles Kuralt with his “On the Road” segments, in which Kuralt traveled around the country to meet interesting and heartwarming people,\n\nPRE FACE\n\nxv\n\nwhile highlighting the virtues of rural and small-town America. Local news stations would also seek out the heartwarming stories, and feature “how to” or “what to do” segments designed to appeal to local viewers. However, as reality programming grew in popularity, the “soft news” began to crowd out the traditional news coverage. At the same time, news anchors, both male and female, morphed into a more telegenic, charismatic, and engaging breed, while the stoic graying middle-aged male news readers became dinosaurs. News now had to have a personal appeal, be continuously applicable to viewers’ lives, and be delivered by likeable TV news personalities. Another area of the television industry to be influenced by the emergence of reality programming was the syndicated market. “Syndication” is a term used to describe the sale of non-network programming to local stations across the nation. Typically, the programs in syndication were largely reruns of shows and movies that had previously aired on a major network (e.g., I Love Lucy, Gilligan’s Island, The Brady Bunch, or madefor-TV movies). There was very little original programming in syndication prior to the 1980s, except for the sporadic talk or game show. Original content created for syndication was likely to produce higher ratings than reruns of an old movie or TV show, but the cost of producing original scripted programs made it an unprofitable enterprise. Accordingly, when the appetite for reality programming was revealed, syndicated producers were willing and able to meet that demand by creating original reality-themed content, because the lower production costs in that genre generated healthy profit margins. As a result, the 1980s featured an array of court shows (The People’s Court, Miller’s Court), reality-based dating shows (Love Connection, Singles), and Real People–styled shows (PM/ Evening Magazine, The World of People, Look at Us). The original programming produced for syndication would continue to expand and thrive over the subsequent three decades, becoming one of the most lucrative regions of the television industry. Beyond the insight into the television industry, Real People offers a broad and unique perspective on contemporary American society. Unlike most modern reality shows, which represent or reflect small communities (e.g., the fabricated cast and scenario, or the inaccessible lifestyle or occupation), Real People is more representative of its era, displaying the larger fabric of American life. As a result, Real People presents a clear window into the evolving American culture of the late 1970s and early\n\nxv i\n\nP REFA CE\n\n1980s. A close analysis of the segments featured on Real People uncovers the emerging “culture wars” that were beginning to roil American society in the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond. Evidence for this assertion can be found in the recurring themes on the show: coastal areas v. mid-America, small town v. big city, traditional values v. modernity in all its forms, and conservatism v. liberalism. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the conflicts among these divergent constituencies were not angry or divisive as they would become later; rather, the differences are portrayed as lighthearted examples of the diversity that makes America great. Real People could be schizophrenic in its tone and focus, even within a single hour-long episode. The series’ run offers a snapshot of opinion on the era’s populist totems, including high gas prices, inflation, unemployment, the Iranian hostage crisis, political corruption, government bureaucracy, foreign industry, and a variety of other issues that captured people’s attention. The show was also capable of progressivism, focusing on successful and trailblazing women; presenting stories about incredible achievement despite impediment; and advocating for the handicapped, senior citizens, the economically disadvantaged, and even missing children. Notwithstanding these high-minded, even noble efforts, Real People was prone to dabbling in the overtly sexual story—what critics at the time referred to as “jiggle TV.” Although promoted as family entertainment, and shown in the so-called “family hour” of 8–9 PM, there were enough clothes being shed and sexual innuendo to make most parents squirm while watching with their children. Throughout the six seasons of the show there was a continual stream of segments on cheerleaders, bikini contests, male and female centerfolds, wet T-shirt contests, various scantily clad endeavors, and strippers of all ages, gender, and body type, including a woman who stripped for God. Nevertheless, the show was not a liberal playground by any means; in fact, Real People also effectively mirrored the rising tide of Reagan era neoconservatism. The show regularly satirized big government, big cities, and cultural elitism, while simultaneously celebrating and romanticizing mid-America, small-town life, and traditional values, and promoting an almost reflexive hyper-patriotism. To wit, patriotic iconography such as Mount Rushmore, the waving American flag, the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial was frequently displayed. Yet the most consistent and laudable manifestation of this patriotic fervor was the show’s efforts to redeem and restore the Vietnam vete-\n\nPRE FACE\n\nxvii\n\nran, and to celebrate all of America’s veterans. The progressive and patriotic themes provide a useful counterbalance to some of the more ridiculous and salacious segments, as well as acting as a partial shield against the frequent critical accusations of mockery and exploitation of Real People’s subjects. Additionally, for students of American popular culture, Real People explores most of the major fads and trends of the late 1970s into the mid-1980s, including roller disco, Valley girls, break dancing, preppies, skateboarders, the Rubik’s Cube, punk music and fashion, and many others. At its broadest points, this study examines reality-themed programs from the 1950s to the early 1990s; though in the main, the primary focus is the years 1978–1984. The narrative is largely chronological, punctuated with an examination of the prevailing themes and developments of the era. The book opens with an introduction that explores the sporadic early examples of reality programs from the formative years of television through the mid- to late 1970s, just before the premiere of Real People. The core of the book features five chapters, each dedicated to a single television season, over the length of the show’s run. The year-by-year analysis includes a review of that season’s episodes, as well as the show’s evolution and recurring themes. This analysis also traces the emerging wave of reality TV, as well as changes in the television industry and larger American society. Chapter 1 examines the development of the series, as Fred Silverman empowers George Schlatter to create Real People. By the midpoint of its first full season, the show becomes a ratings success and a growing cultural phenomenon. In chapter 2, the reality trend expands across the television landscape, with shows such as That’s Incredible, Speak Up America, Games People Play, and That’s My Line dotting network schedules. Chapter 3 details how Real People balances its content with a series of offbeat characters, places, and events, while bathing the show in the rising tide of feel-good patriotism engulfing the United States in the early 1980s. In chapter 4, several years into the reality wave, the trend begins to proliferate in national syndication and local programming. In addition to daily syndicated reruns of Real People, shows such as The People’s Court, PM Magazine, a collection of dating shows, and private events made public inundate viewers. Chapter 5 details the final season of the series, during which the show falls victim to plummeting ratings, declin-\n\nxv i i i\n\nP REFA CE\n\ning cultural relevance, and a network that is trying to reframe its programming brand. Finally, there is an epilogue, which briefly reviews Real People’s extended legacy, and includes a survey of reality-themed programs from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, when the reality genre began its transformation. There are also several appendices, including a Real People episode guide, a list of reality-themed shows from 1976 to 1992, and a map of Real People segment locations. When Real People was canceled in 1984, it was summarily deposited in the bargain bin of American popular culture. This status may be a result of a slightly flawed collective memory of the show as a circus of eccentricity, jiggling bodies, and corny jokes. It is too easily dismissed as kitsch by those with selective memories, or a generation that has never seen the show. It may well be a lack of access that has circumscribed the significance of Real People, as the show has rarely been seen in national syndication in the last twenty years, nor has it been released on DVD. Regardless of the cause, the marginalization of Real People has clearly obscured its cultural legacy. A peeling back of the layers of reality programming over the last two decades reveals that Real People is the hub from which many of the spokes of the reality genre emerge. Even if one were to argue that it was not the “original” reality show, the ratings success of the show clearly inspired a wave of reality programming that had not been seen previously. Real People proved there was an audience for reality programming, and much of that audience would be acculturated to appreciate the entertainment value of reality television in the future. The transformation of American television that began with the premiere of Real People in 1979 would ebb and flow over the next three decades. However, it is important to note that there was no break or cessation between the “old” reality wave and the “new” reality wave of the last decade and a half. Though Real People disappeared in the mid1980s, the subgenres it spawned, and its confirmation of the potential of reality TV, would be the foundation for a genre that would ultimately envelope mainstream media by the early twenty-first century. Ideally, this study will redeem the reputation of Real People, and place it in its correct historical context.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nContinued thanks are extended to my editor, Stephen Ryan, for supporting my work and having a shared consciousness on the academic and cultural value of television history.

However, television broadcasting in a practicable, though experimental, form emerged in the 1920s. A prominent example of the potential capabilities of television occurred in 1927, when Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover agreed to take part in a televised speech for the American Telegraph and Telephone Company. Sitting in front of a transmitter tube in Washington, DC, Hoover delivered an address that would be seen and heard over two hundred miles away in New York City, on a two-inch by three-inch screen. The Hoover experiment produced enthusiastic headlines in major American newspapers, but it did not produce dramatic commercial advancement for television. Over the subsequent decade, television was largely a medium for amateurs and innovators, while also featuring the early stirrings of corporate involvement. 1 The national coming-out party for television occurred at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) would operate one of the more popular pavilions at the fair, in an effort to promote sales of its TV sets. Utilizing the corporate-owned National Broadcasting Company (NBC), RCA would broadcast the opening ceremonies from Flushing Meadows. The telecast included an address by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and a speech by RCA president David Sarnoff. At the time, there were only about two hundred television sets xxi\n\nxxi i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwithin a forty-mile radius, but special receivers had been set up at RCA headquarters and in the windows of several Manhattan department stores. Sarnoff’s speech served as a grand, eloquent, if not self-serving, introduction to television. As Sarnoff put it: Now we add sight to sound. It is with a feeling of humbleness that I come to this moment of announcing the birth, in this country, of a new art so important in its implementation that it is bound to affect all society. It is an art which shines like a torch in the troubled world. 2\n\nIt was not a coincidence that the following day RCA began selling its first TV sets designed for the general viewing public. For the remainder of the fair, the RCA pavilion would demonstrate television technology for thousands of visitors. In the most popular component of the pavilion, a camera was set up to allow people to appear on a large TV monitor. Visitors were gleeful as they shouted and waved while their friends and family watched them on television. 3 It can be fairly stated that from the very introduction of the medium, people have enjoyed seeing themselves, their family, friends, and other “real people” on television. With that in mind, the emergence of reality TV seems like a natural, even an inevitable development. The onset of World War II slowed the growth of commercial television in the United States. Not only was there a paucity of programming, some of which was caused by the impositions of war, but television sets were still prohibitively expensive for most consumers. As a result, most of the TV sets were owned by people of means, or by public entities such as bars, where some of the limited programming fare of baseball, boxing, and wrestling would draw big crowds. One of the more unique real-life, real-people applications of television involved wartime air wardens visiting local police stations to view televised lectures on how to properly do their jobs. In fact, there is an interesting parallel between the early years of motion pictures and those of early 1940s television programming. When motion pictures began to appear around the turn of the twentieth century, audiences were so captivated with the visual wizardry that they were mesmerized watching mundane events like a moving train, birds in flight, urban street scenes, or a man and woman dancing. Many early-adopting television viewers were equally engrossed when images of street scenes, man/woman-on-the-street interviews, and various daily live events such\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxiii\n\nas sporting events or city council meetings were broadcast. For example, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) produced a show entitled What’s It Worth? where average people would bring in heirlooms or antiques and have them appraised by the erudite Sigmund Rothschild. The viewer’s payoff came when the owner was told how much the item was worth. 4 Another of the unique early uses of non-performers on television occurred in New York City in the late 1940s. Don Weiss, the head of the New York office of the Veterans Administration, was growing increasingly frustrated with his inability to find jobs for disabled war veterans. In a truly prescient acknowledgment of the coming power of the medium, Weiss decided to use television to prove the capabilities of these men. Weiss successfully pitched his idea to station WABD; and a proto-reality show was born. A stage set was created in which the disabled soldiers could prove proficiency in fixing machinery, laying brick, working on automobiles, and varied carpentry tasks. It was essentially a thirty-minute job audition, with a semi-authentic setting, using real disabled men. Over several months, the Veterans Administration received hundreds of offers of employment for the men, while WABD received positive publicity for the nascent medium. 5 Eventually, television, like motion pictures decades earlier, would move away from mundane reality to more scripted and talent-laden fare. Early budgetary and technical limitations would bind television programming to static stage sets and live performances. Accordingly, there was an early reliance on genres such as variety and talent shows, game shows, sitcoms, and live drama. However, as the 1950s progressed, and the major networks expanded their daily program schedules, there would be opportunities, some orchestrated, some not, for reality-themed programs and for non-performers to capture the attention of the American public.\n\nACCIDENTAL REALITY STARS It is difficult to conceive of any broad study of the 1950s, whether academic or popular in nature, that does not include extensive discussion on the activities of United States Senator Joseph McCarthy. In terms of eternal infamy, deserved or not, McCarthy has few equals in American political history. Not only is he the personification of Cold War paranoia\n\nxxi v\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand fear-mongering, but his name will forever be linked with political or institutional persecution. Most examinations of McCarthy necessarily explore the role television played in popularizing, legitimizing, and ultimately derailing the senator’s campaign to expose Communist elements in American life. The narrative trajectory of McCarthy’s television “career” has been widely disseminated—from his initial foray into televised Senate hearings in the early 1950s, which helped make him a national celebrity and respected political champion; to the emerging cracks in his crusading façade, famously exposed on Edward R. Murrow’s See It Now program; to his ultimate disintegration in front of millions of TV viewers during the Army-McCarthy Hearings in 1954. A further, though admittedly alternative, analysis of McCarthy’s activities reveals him to be one of the earliest reality TV celebrities, while many of his televised appearances epitomize the standard reality drama/ suspense formats. McCarthy transcended politics; he became either the perfect hero or villain to viewers, for whom the drama, suspense, and anger were amplified by the salient reality of the events. The McCarthydriven Senate hearings of the early 1950s evoked an air of a sixteenthcentury church inquisition, with the dogged senator acting as the moralizing grand inquisitor, while the witnesses played the role of obsequious supplicant or degraded heretic. For television viewers, particularly those viewing during the day, when regular programming was sparse in the early 1950s, the real-life drama of these proceedings could be spellbinding. Even when McCarthy’s appearances were essentially scripted, as in Murrow’s See It Now exposés, or his rebuttal of those accusations on a subsequent episode, the senator’s personality and performance was the catalytic force. The real-life drama achieved its zenith as McCarthy plummeted to his nadir in his 1954 investigation of Communist infiltration of the United States Army. With twenty million viewers watching 187 hours of coverage spread over thirty-six days, McCarthy and his equally aggressive and dramatic co-counsel, Roy Cohn, battered and badgered reluctant or suspect witnesses. Given the persistent annual increase in television ownership since he began his crusade in 1950, there were now more viewers able to see McCarthy operate in his natural and unfiltered environment. What they saw was a flood of accusations and implications, but very little solid evidence to justify convening the hearing; nor any exemplars of\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxv\n\naccomplishment toward the senator’s overarching goal of exposing subversive Americans. 6 The dramatic crescendo of the proceedings occurred when McCarthy tried to impugn the character and loyalty of a young lawyer working in the office of the army’s chief counsel, Joseph Welch. In response, Welch delivered a soliloquy that would have been the envy of any television writer: “If it were in my power to forgive you for your reckless cruelty I would do so. I like to think I’m a gentle man, but your forgiveness will have to come from someone other than me.” Welch then went in for the rhetorical kill. “Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator, you have done enough. Have you no sense of decency sir? At long last have you no sense of decency?” 7 These withering dismissals of McCarthy’s tactics are among the most iconic film clips of the entire decade. Even at the time, cultural critics and political pundits recognized how television’s reality had colored events. Writing in the May 30, 1954, edition of the New York Times, James Reston marked the changing public perception of McCarthy: One cannot remain indifferent to Joe McCarthy in one’s living room. He is an abrasive man, and he is recklessly transparent. The country did not know him before, despite all the headlines, now it has seen him. It has had a startling but accurate presentation of his ideas, his tactics, his immense physical power, and it is at least basing its judgments now on first hand observations.\n\nJack Gould, renowned New York Times television critic, noted the narrative power of reality television: “The absorbing attraction is to follow the testimony as it goes first one way then another, as first the Army and then Senator McCarthy made their points. On TV it is the drama of unrehearsed actuality unfolding for everyone to see at home.” 8 Though McCarthy and his televised hearings endure as a twentiethcentury cultural touchstone, neither the Wisconsin senator nor his hearings were unique in their time, or even the most widely viewed of their kind. This distinction belongs to another proto-reality TV celebrity and US Senator with larger aspirations, Estes Kefauver. Kefauver, a first-term senator from Tennessee, found his path to national political prominence through an investigation of the criminal underworld in American cities, during early 1951. Over ninety-two days in fourteen cities, he chaired a senate subcommittee as it exposed the dark\n\nxxv i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nunderbelly of organized crime, often live on local television. The senator’s star began to rise in medium-sized cities like Detroit, where his hearings drew stronger ratings than The Howdy Doody Show; and in New Orleans, where the hearings were telecast in the evening, reportedly resulting in empty movie theaters and restaurants throughout the city. With his national celebrity beginning to peak, the Kefauver Committee landed in New York City in March of 1951. The convening of the hearings was heavily covered by the city’s newspapers, with the anticipation of a long-awaited Broadway opening or Hollywood film premiere. Not everyone was enthralled with the arrival of the televised spectacle. The Federal Bar Association of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut publically admonished the senator, stating “that the glaring melodrama created by television lights and cameras does interfere with the quest for truth in a public hearing.” 9 Kefauver himself had expressed reservations about having the hearings televised in the various cities, including New York. However, when he arrived in New York, he discovered that a temporary network of twenty-five stations had been set up to broadcast the hearings from the East Coast to the Midwest. With no opportunity to bar the cameras, and newspaper coverage increasing, the hearings morphed into a national phenomenon. The televised hearings lived up to, if not exceeded, the preliminary hype. Up from the New York underworld gurgled a cast of characters that could have been appropriated from a 1930s Hollywood gangster film. Among those testifying was former New York City mayor William O’Dwyer, who had resigned a year earlier as a result of a corruption scandal that deservedly landed at his feet. There were Joe Adonis, a reputed Brooklyn crime boss, known to be a murderer and an extortionist; Jake “Greasy Thumb” Guzik, former confidant of Al Capone and comic butcher of the English language; and Virginia Hill, former Hollywood actress and girlfriend of mobster Bugsy Siegel, who in her own way was tougher and more acid-tongued that any of the alleged Mafiosi. However, the most compelling and unwittingly dramatic of the criminal witnesses was Frank Costello, reputedly the majordomo of New York’s crime syndicate. In spite of his reputation, Costello presented himself as a respected businessman and pillar of his community. Consequently, when called to testify, he was reluctant to appear on television in a sensationalized criminal investigation. As his lawyer stated, “Mr. Costello does not come to submit himself as a spectacle.”\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxvii\n\nIn a compromise, the committee agreed to keep the camera from showing Costello’s face, instead focusing only on his hands. This was equally if not more dramatic than showing his face; for when the questioning became intense or pointed, his hands were shown in sweaty clenched fists, tearing at papers and tightly gripping a glass. His hands said all that his face could have, and more. As Jack Gould of the New York Times remarked, “His was video’s first ballet of the hands.” The narrative and visual juxtaposition of the down-home, humble, crusading public servant Kefauver and the abrasive, urban, ethnic criminal element was irresistible to viewers. The ratings for the hearings were remarkable, surpassing the 1950 World Series, and on one Tuesday when the hearings ran late, they drew a larger audience than ratings king Milton Berle. 10 Many of the hundreds of articles appearing in newspapers and periodicals not only described the proceedings, but also analyzed the social impact of the televised hearings. Life magazine noted the effect in cities that aired the New York hearings: The week of March 12, 1951, will occupy a special place in history. The U.S. and the world had never experienced anything like it. In Detroit the telephone company noticed that for hours at a time normally clogged phone lines went unused . . . thousands of people stayed away from their jobs. . . . Trolley cars in many cities carried half their normal loads. New York cab drivers wasted gas in a vain search for passengers. It became apparent that at least one-fifth of the population had absented itself from normal pursuits.\n\nNew York Times television critic Jack Gould offered daily cogent analysis: The opening session of the Senate Crime Investigating Committee was nothing less than a Hollywood thriller brought to life. For five and a half hours there were gripping and compelling drama and suspense in watching one of the seamier sides of national life spread out for all to see.\n\nOn the public reaction to the hearings, Gould suggested, “Housewives have left the housework undone and husbands have slipped away from their jobs to watch. The city has been under a hypnotic spell, absorbed, fascinated, angered and amused. It has been a rare community experience.” 11\n\nxxv i i i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe breakout “star” of the hearings was Estes Kefauver. The senator became a nationwide celebrity, gracing national magazine covers and even appearing on the semi-reality-themed show What’s My Line? in which blindfolded celebrity panelists attempted to guess the identity/occupation of the guests. In a clear reflection of his television stardom, Kefauver received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Contribution to Television in 1952. 12 Though he experienced a meteoric rise to television stardom and national political prominence, that momentum would not help him achieve his presumptive goal of becoming president of the United States. However, the power of television to create celebrities out of non-performers or real people was now clearly evident. In fact, 1950s television would produce a reality celebrity even more unlikely than two nondescript senators: a Catholic priest.\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY THE MOST REVEREND FULTON J. SHEEN, ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK In February 1952, the DuMont Network began airing a half-hour program entitled Life Is Worth Living. The off-camera introduction described it as “a program devoted to the everyday problems of all of us.” It was not, however, the “problems” that attracted millions of viewers to the program; it was the single character and star of the show, Bishop Fulton Sheen. A Catholic priest, in a predominantly Protestant nation, would seem an unlikely candidate to become one of the most revered religious figures of the decade, let alone a television star, yet that is exactly what happened. However, Sheen was not a typical parish priest; he was well educated, articulate, and most importantly, a telegenic theologian. After his trademark “Hello friends” welcome, Sheen would spend twenty-seven minutes delivering his sermon, without the aid of a script, cue cards, or teleprompter, often ad-libbing seamlessly. His only props were a blackboard, a stage set made to look like a scholar’s study, and his priestly vestments. Within eighteen months of Sheen’s premiere, his show was airing on over 130 stations across the country; drawing an estimated twenty million viewers per episode; and receiving two hundred thousand letters weekly from his audience. Sheen’s ratings success is all the more remarkable given that his competition on Tuesday nights was TV superstar Milton\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxix\n\nBerle. An oft-repeated quip of the time inquired who are you going to watch, Uncle Miltie or Uncle Fultie? Amazingly, after a later change of network and airdate, Sheen found himself in direct competition with another 1950s powerhouse, I Love Lucy. At the peak of his popularity, Sheen was appearing on the covers of national magazines and earning a reported $26,000 per episode, and he won the 1952 Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality. Given the extent of his fame and acceptance, Sheen’s success cannot be solely attributed to the support of fellow Catholics. As a matter of fact, Sheen would often comment upon and utilize the philosophy of other spiritual traditions and institutions; and a steady stream of letters he received was from non-Catholics, as were many of the awards and honors he received over the years. 13 Undoubtedly, some measure of Sheen’s popularity can be explained by a Cold War–inspired revival in American religiosity. Yet more important was the power of television combined with the relatable personality of a non-performer. Sheen was a real person talking about real issues, which struck a chord with viewers. These characteristics would be present in many future reality celebrities, though regrettably, most would not be as high-minded and noble as Bishop Sheen. During the 1950s, there were also several popular television personalities who, though recognized as professional performers, had built much of their success on the ability to interact with the average person. The two most prominent and prosperous performers in this unique subgroup were Art Linkletter and Groucho Marx. Linkletter built a prestigious fivedecade career on his ability to engage in and create entertaining dialogue between himself and members of his studio audience and selected noncelebrity guests. Shows such as Art Linkletter’s House Party (1952–1969), Life with Linkletter (1950–1952), and People Are Funny (1954–1961) utilized audience participation, viewer contests, interviews, and, most memorably, a regular segment in which Linkletter asked questions of several young children, often with comedic or poignant responses. Unquestionably, Linkletter had a notable talent for connecting with television viewers; however, were it not for the non-celebrity guests and audience interaction, his career would not have been as legendary. 14 While no informed observer would ever question the talent and accomplishments of Groucho Marx in film and theater, his comic gift and personality alone would not translate into television success. You Bet Your Life (1950–1961) reads on paper as a fairly run-of-the-mill game\n\nxxx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nshow, with money awarded to contestants for answering several questions in a category of their choosing. However, the heart of the show was the interview Marx conducted with the contestants. Virtually all of the contestants were non-professional performers, yet many were selected for their unusual skills, occupations, hobbies, or funny stories. Marx’s rapier wit would elicit and illuminate the comic aspects of the contestants’ lives, often with an off-color double entendre. While You Bet Your Life clearly would not have worked without Groucho Marx, neither would it have worked without the real people as a foil. In this case, Marx is a brilliant miner of comedic gold, but the real people are the gold mine. 15\n\nGAME SHOWS While proto-reality themes dot the landscape of 1950s programming, in several unique ways the most reality-dependent genre on television was the game/quiz show. The elasticity of the genre produced great diversity of format, from physical challenges and pure luck to specialized knowledge quiz/game shows. Regardless of format, it was the contestants, often described as “the person next door” or “your friends and neighbors,” who created the narrative and visual appeal for viewers. The most infamous, though widely popular, of the subcategories in the genre was what came to be known as the “confessional show,” often referred to by critics as the “misery shows.” The standard-bearer for prime-time misery shows is Strike It Rich (1951–1955). The self-proclaimed “quiz show with a heart” was hosted by Warren Hull, and typically featured contestants purposely selected for personal stories that were designed to resonate with an audience. In essence, the more woeful and desperate the story, the more likely it was the contestant would make it on the air. The standard format began with the contestants being introduced and interviewed by Warren Hull. Slowly, the tales of misfortune would unfold as the camera panned in on the guests. A sampling of the more emotional stories includes a childless couple who wanted to adopt but could not afford the adoption; parents who needed money to pay for an operation for their blind, hearing-impaired, and physically disabled child; and families that had grown too large at ten, twelve, even seventeen children, and needed help with the basic necessities. There was a constant stream of widows, single mothers, sickly children, war veterans, and homeless or hungry families. The com-\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxxi\n\nmon thread among contestants was a desperate economic need, a willingness to reveal intimate, even embarrassing details of their lives, and the hope of winning money to offset some of their problems. The quiz segment of the show followed the interviews, featuring reasonably easy general-knowledge questions or “name that tune” challenges. Of course, after their tales of misery, home viewers were eager for the contestants to win as much money as possible. The final segment of the show utilized what was called the “Heartline,” which allowed the TV viewers to call in offering their own assistance to the woebegone. Home audience members called in to pledge additional money or other aid, such as a place to live, free clothing, and occasionally medical care. Some years after the show was canceled, a producer acknowledged that many of the Heartline calls had been prearranged to ensure legitimacy. The most heartwarming of the contestants would often return to the show to provide an update of their circumstances, while also validating the help they had received in earlier appearances. 16 Not surprisingly, Strike It Rich was consistently accused of exploiting its downtrodden guests. Critics pointed to the unseemly nature of the intimate personal details being exposed, as well as the camera techniques used, such as tight close-ups on weeping parents or sick children, including one episode with a tight camera shot of a disabled boy’s legs as he struggled to walk with heavy leg braces. The most prominent TV critic in the nation, Jack Gould, of the New York Times, led the cultural assault, calling the show “an instance of commercial TV gone berserk,” and suggesting it was “a show that callously exploits human anxiety to sell the products of a soap manufacturer and does it with a saccharine solicitude that hits the jackpot in bad taste.” Strike It Rich even ran afoul of city and state officials in New York. In 1954, it was revealed that dozens of people had come to the show’s New York City studio hoping to appear on the show. When these unfortunate souls could not get on the show, many were stranded in the city, including a destitute family of eleven from Maryland. The New York City welfare department was compelled to extend financial assistance to get the family home. In response, the welfare commissioner called the show “a national disgrace.” In another embarrassing episode, an escaped fugitive appeared on the show, winning $165 and a place to live. In the aftermath of these incidents and mounting criticism, politicians became involved, initiating a criminal investigation and proposing bills in the state legislature to\n\nxxxi i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nprotect viewers from shows like Strike It Rich. CBS buckled under the public scrutiny and canceled the prime-time version of the show in early 1955, though a daytime version would continue until 1958. The controversy and condemnation surrounding Strike It Rich foreshadowed a frequently critical response to reality-dependent programming in the future. 17 Though Strike It Rich did have a daytime programming presence, unquestionably the most prominent and successful of the daytime misery shows was Queen for a Day (1956–1964). This confessional show was targeted toward the female viewer at home during the day. On a daily basis, four or five women would be called from the studio audience to be interviewed by host Jack Bailey. In truth, the contestants for each show were preselected and placed in the audience. The women were chosen for the depth of sadness in their personal lives and their level of neediness, but also for their ability to look forlorn, frumpy, and unattractive on camera. The physical appearance of the women was heightened by the contrasting use of glamorous fashion models to display the daily gifts awarded to the winner. Upon being called on camera, the women would be prompted by Jack Bailey to detail their depressing circumstances and explain why they deserved to be Queen for a Day. Much like Strike It Rich, there was a litany of sick children, dying relatives, starving or homeless families, and various other depressing stories. At the end of the program, after each woman told her story, the contestants would be assembled together on the stage. At that point each woman would have her misery summarized, after which the studio audience would be encouraged to applaud for their favored Queen, with an on-screen applause meter determining the winner. Bailey would then shout to the winner, “I now pronounce you . . . Queen for a Day,” and she would be cloaked in a red sable robe, with a crown placed on her head, often with tears flowing from the winner and many in the audience. Though the show was a ratings powerhouse, drawing 50 percent of the audience in many television markets, it never drew the same volume of criticism hurled at Strike It Rich. This is likely due to its primary existence as a daytime show, which placed it in a category of programming that could easily be dismissed or ignored, as opposed to prime-time programming, which was taken more seriously and subject to more comment and critique. 18 Several other confessional shows aired in the 1950s, including Glamour Girl (1953–1954), in which the “needy” or “deserving”\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxxiii\n\nwomen were awarded with gifts for their troubles, most notably a twentyfour-hour beauty makeover; and On Your Account (1953–1956), in which contestants had their misery assessed by a panel of judges, while earning money by answering questions. 19 At the opposite end of the reality-dependent game show spectrum was the quiz show, particularly the specialized-knowledge format. In the summer of 1955, CBS premiered The $64,000 Question, airing at 10 PM on Tuesday nights. Initially, the appeal of the show was the unprecedented amount of money available to contestants. The money itself was enough to create some measure of tension; however, the producers of the show amped up the drama by carefully selecting the contestants. Not only were many of the participants emblematic of the guy/gal next door, but their fields of expertise often seemed incongruous with their perceived station in life. For example, there was Gino Prato, a shoemaker from the Bronx, who was an expert on opera; Redmond O’Hanlon, a New York City police officer, whose category was Shakespeare; Marine Captain Richard McCutcheon, whose topic was cooking; and arguably the most famous contestant from the show, Dr. Joyce Brothers, a twenty-eight-year-old psychologist, who was an expert on boxing and ultimately won the $64,000 grand prize. Many of the breakout “stars” of the show were not only relatable to viewers, but also remarkable in their knowledge. The format of the show was also brilliantly crafted to stretch and build the tension over several weeks of a contestant’s run. Within several weeks of its premiere, The $64,000 Question was the number one rated show on television, reaching a peak audience of fifty-five million in September of 1955, when Marine Captain McCutcheon became the first contestant to win the $64,000 prize. 20 As is often the case in television programming, success breeds replication. After the meteoric rise of The $64,000 Question came other big money quiz shows, such as a spin-off from the original, The $64,000 Challenge, which had popular alumni from the parent show competing. Other popular quiz shows included Tic Tac Dough (1956–1959), Name That Tune (1953–1959), and Dotto (1958). Most noteworthy of the big money imitators was a show entitled Twenty-One, which premiered in March 1956. From the beginning, the show’s producers, Jack Barry and Dan Enright, faced intense pressure from their commercial sponsors and heavy competition from other quiz programs. Like their successful competitors, Twenty-One’s producers created a show built on nail-biting dra-\n\nxxxi v\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nma and excruciating tension, coupled with the carefully screened personalities of the meticulously selected contestants. Within the televised game, two competitors answered questions from a diverse group of categories, with higher points awarded for more difficult queries; the ultimate goal was to be the first to attain twenty-one points. To amplify the drama contestants were sequestered in a glass-walled “isolation booth,” which prevented them from seeing each other’s point total until the game was over. For even more dramatic effect, ties up to and including twenty-one points were possible, thus ensuring two strong competitors could appear together for several weeks. Because these programs were so reality dependent, the merits or competition of the game itself were not enough to ensure ratings success. Consequently, the Twenty-One producers chose their contestants as if it were a Broadway production. Their greatest success was in casting a villain, in the form of thirty-one-year-old Herbert Stempel, a struggling graduate student from Queens, New York. Known to his friends and family as “the walking encyclopedia,” Stempel had impressed the producers with his amazing knowledge in a broad array of topics. Nonetheless, he was deemed completely un-telegenic in both his appearance and personality, bordering on extremely unlikeable. Barry and Enright decided to accentuate these characteristics with the hope that viewers would tune in to see Stempel lose. The producers crafted him into an unpleasant know-it-all by dictating how he dressed, his haircut, and his on-air mannerisms and speech. The artifice worked to a point, particularly in the show’s ratings, but Barry and Enright realized that the American public would rather root for someone to win, as opposed to hoping for someone to lose. They needed a fair-haired hero, and they found one in Charles Van Doren. A scion of a renowned and award-winning literary and academic family, Charles Van Doren, thirty, was an English instructor at Columbia University. He was also the antithesis of the unappealing Stempel; Van Doren was handsome, pithy, modest, and self-deprecating, in spite of his obvious erudition and intelligence. As Dan Enright said of Van Doren, “he was the kind of young man you’d love to have your daughter marry.” 21 In December of 1956, after having won over $50,000, Herb Stempel was defeated by Charles Van Doren. Thus began the short career of the era’s greatest reality celebrity. During an unprecedented fifteen consecutive appearances, Van Doren became a national hero and icon, grac-\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxxv\n\ning the covers of national magazines and guesting on TV talk shows. America’s “favorite egghead” was even promoted as bulwark against the looming threat inherent in the emergence of Elvis Presley. As Karal Ann Marling has noted in her book on 1950s culture, Charlie Van Doren had provided an almost irresistible contrast to Elvis; he was articulate, conservative, neatly barbered—all the things Elvis appeared not to be. Unlike the sensual, some would say downright dirty Elvis, he was cool, restrained and cerebral, the perfect hero, it would seem, for American teens in the age of Sputnik. 22\n\nThe newly minted celebrity had won $129,000 on the show when he finally lost in the spring of 1957. Van Doren transitioned into a regular position as a “cultural correspondent” on NBC’s Today Show, at a salary of $50,000 a year. Van Doren seemed the perfect man, who now had the perfect life. Unfortunately for everyone involved, the off-camera manipulation of contestants was not limited to coaching how they looked and acted on the set of the show. In the late summer of 1958, a contestant on the quiz show Dotto exposed a scheme in which contestants on that show had been given the questions and answers in advance of their appearance. In short order, the other quiz show dominoes began to topple, ultimately reaching Twenty-One and Charles Van Doren himself. Though the youthful professor denied any wrongdoing, Herbert Stempel, after attempting extortion from Dan Enright, vindictively confessed the show’s guilt, including Van Doren’s, to reporters and law enforcement. The fabricated reality villain now seemed to be living up to that caricature. Eventually, in a stunning fall from grace, in front of a congressional committee, Van Doren admitted his culpability in fixing his appearances on Twenty-One. It was a sad public end to a brief but remarkable personality-driven phenomenon. Undoubtedly, the ethics of Barry, Enright, and the other producers and participants in the quiz show scandal can be easily assailed. Yet in a substantive way they were captives of their own genre and the medium in which they worked. The saturation of the game show format in the late 1950s created intense ratings competition. Furthermore, in the realitydependent quiz show genre, producers quickly learned that it was the contestant’s personalities, quirks, and narrative appeal that produced ratings success. In fact, the ratings for a specific game show could fluctuate wildly, even though the prize money and question format stayed the\n\nxxxv i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsame. Viewers tuned in for the personalities; when a show had an engaging contestant the ratings would spike upward, while the reverse would occur with less engaging contestants. Given the confluence of these factors with ratings expectations and the ability to manipulate reality, it is not at all surprising that the outcomes were predetermined. However, that reasonable understanding did not protect the television networks or their sponsors from the taint of scandal. To cleanse themselves they purged all the major quiz shows (The $64,000 Question, The $64,000 Challenge, Dotto, Twenty-One) from the lineups almost immediately when the scandal hit the media. 23 The smaller prize money game shows were still a viable genre, though largely during the daytime schedule; but the big money quiz show would not prosper again in prime time for almost forty years. Collaterally, the disappearance of big money quiz shows eliminated one of the platforms for reality-themed programming. In fact, reality-dependent programming acquired a stain that caused it to appear only sporadically over the next twenty years. The big three networks felt more secure manipulating fictional characters in sitcoms, westerns, and dramas than risking the inevitable criticism that would come from stage-managing real people in a reality-themed program.\n\nBRANCHES OF THE REALITY TREE The 1950s also featured a collection of miscellaneous reality-themed pieces. One with a similar motif to shows like Strike It Rich and Queen for a Day, but with a comedic tinge, was It Could Be You (1956–1961). On a typical show, host Bill Leyden would walk into the studio audience and call out the name of an audience member. It was not a random act; with the help of family members and “spies,” the show’s producers had assembled a biographical narrative of the targeted contestant. The subject would then listen as funny or mildly embarrassing stories, or occasionally tales of woe, were revealed to viewers. To take the edge off of being set upon, the contestants were awarded gifts or given the opportunity to win prizes. Periodically, the show would surprise people at their home or job. However, It Could Be You was not as maudlin or cruelly exploitative as its confessional show cousins. There was a warmhearted nature to most of the daily episodes, which included family reunions, long-lost friends re-\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxxvii\n\nunited, and the solving of small-scale problems. But as with most realitydependent series, it was the people and their stories that created the viewer interest. 24 One of the more unique reality-themed shows of the decade, You Asked for It (1950–1959), featured what were called at the time “human interest” segments. The central plot device of this weekly program was the ability for viewers to write letters requesting what they wanted to see in future shows. Culled from several thousand letters each week, the viewer requests fulfilled leaned toward the odd and sensational. Features included a one-armed wallpaper hanger on the job; men fighting wild animals such as bears, anacondas, and alligators; a six-hundred-pound cowboy riding a horse; swallowers of goldfish and swords; a Hopi rain dance using a rattlesnake; and a reenactment of William Tell’s shooting of an apple off someone’s head. Even more revealing of the audience may have been the requests that were not granted. According to the show’s host, Art Baker, the producers received requests to see a man executed in the electric chair, a reenactment of the burning of Joan of Arc at the stake, and, from multiple viewers, high-speed car crashes. This sensationalist format would be mirrored more than two decades later by reality shows such as That’s Incredible and Games People Play. 25 Another stalwart reality TV subgenre, the courtroom show, was also in an embryonic stage in the 1950s. Examples in this field include Divorce Court (1957–1969) and The Verdict Is Yours (1958), both of which dabbled in reality by using “real people stars” or “real legal professionals” in their presentations. Also noteworthy was the show Divorce Hearing (1958–1959), a pseudo-documentary featuring real-life marriage counselor Dr. Paul Popenoe talking to authentic couples in troubled marriages. Foreshadowing modern reality shows, the couples often found themselves in heated confrontations and shouting matches. These court shows were deemed by some as the “trash TV” of their day. United Press International television critic John Crosby minced no words when he said, “Divorce Hearing is the most disgusting program on television.” He further opined, “It occurred to me watching this [Divorce Hearing and other court shows] that real people are entirely too real for television. The actors impersonating real people on these shows, God knows, is bad enough. But at least they can keep their passions sufficiently under control to talk coherently.” With the benefit of hindsight this critique seems a\n\nxxxv i i i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nremarkably prescient analysis of the early twenty-first-century reality program. 26\n\nTHE 1960S The quiz show scandals of the late 1950s made the three networks and many TV producers wary of the pitfalls in using real people to create entertainment, especially in the prime-time hours. There were still game shows, talk shows, and human interest programs on during the daytime; and there were sporadic news programs, non-news documentaries, and public opinion/man-on-the-street segments. However, the reality-dependent shows and the reality TV celebrity would recede in an avalanche of scripted fare, in the form of sitcoms, westerns, drama series, and variety shows. In fact, the one reality show to create a cultural legacy in the 1960s, Candid Camera (1960–1967), was actually a reboot of a program with origins in the formative years of television in the late 1940s. The forebearer of Candid Camera was a radio program transformed into a TV show called Candid Microphone. Eventually renamed Candid Camera, the program aired sporadically in the 1950s—until 1960, when Candid Camera began a very successful seven-season run on CBS, including four consecutive years in which it was one of the top ten rated shows on television. 27 The show was created and hosted by Allen Funt. A characteristic episode featured several manufactured scenarios that placed unsuspecting non-performers in a position that would possibly test their honesty, credulity, altruism, and ultimately their sense of humor. This hidden-camera formula was described in the show’s opening narration as “people caught in the act of being themselves.” Funt was aided in his comic efforts by a cadre of actors who facilitated the scenarios, some of which were crafted by well-known writers such as Woody Allen, William Saroyan, Pat McCormick, and Fannie Flagg. At the heart of most of the comic setups were everyday occurrences that went awry. For example: Driving a car with no engine into a service station and having a mechanic examine it. Placing a guard on the Pennsylvania/Delaware border to inform drivers that Delaware was closed for the day.\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxxxix\n\nSetting up a trampoline store in which recently hired secretaries watched clients bounce through the ceiling and disappear. Setting up an office in which new employees had to contend with an out-of-control mimeograph machine. Occasionally, the show would border on the truly voyeuristic: secretly filming people at work, or people combing their hair or grooming in a mirror. The comic payoff for the audience was what Funt called the “reveal”—the moment he would enter the camera shot and inform the unsuspecting subjects they were on TV. It should be noted that everyone who appeared on the show had to sign a release form to have their likeness used in the show. According to Funt, very few people refused to sign the form, perhaps reflecting a universal desire to be on TV. Candid Camera was broadly popular within several constituencies. The viewing public responded by making the program one of the highest rated on television, including second-place finish among all shows in the 1962–1963 season. The network and the show’s producers appreciated not just the success of the show, but also the smaller budgets, with low production costs being one of the eternal appeals of reality television. Candid Camera even found vocal pockets of interest and support in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Various sociologists and social psychologists like Philip Zimbardo noted the value of Americans being able to see themselves as they really are, as well as the potential clinical applications of Candid Camera’s techniques. In fact, when the show was only sporadically aired in the 1950s, Funt did consulting work for psychologists to make ends meet. The show was not universally praised; it was susceptible to the critiques that most reality-dependent shows seem to attract. Candid Camera was called invasive, misrepresentative, exploitative, and cruel. Funt alluded to the occasional need for cruelty in humor, saying, “If you want to know what holds the man together . . . you apply a real jolt and see where the cracks appear.” A particularly harsh critique in The New Yorker called Funt and his show “sadistic, poisonous, antihuman and sneaky.” 28 Though the show was canceled by CBS in 1967, the Candid Camera formula, and Funt’s propensity for using real people, continued for two more decades. After 1967, Funt produced periodic TV specials, but made his biggest splash in 1970, when he released an X-rated feature film called What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? It was essentially the Candid Camera hidden-camera approach, but with full frontal nudity creating the\n\nxl\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhumorous situations and subject reactions. Funt would return to the risqué fare at the height of the reality wave in 1982, by producing a new version of his classic show for the adult-entertainment-themed Playboy Channel on cable television. Despite the tremendous ratings success of Candid Camera, the show stands alone as the only prominent prime-time reality-dependent show of the 1960s. This fact runs counter to the course of television history, in which success with a genre produces a mass replication, if not a saturation of similar programming. That did not happen with Candid Camera, for three reasons. First, in the wake of the quiz show scandal of the previous decade, there was still some residual trepidation about any programming that relied on “non-performers” for entertainment. Second, the Candid Camera formula of hidden surveillance was difficult to re-create without looking like an unvarnished, explicit appropriation, possibly producing legal action. Third, there was just not the demand for realitythemed shows within the industry or among viewers. Scripted programs were drawing large and loyal audiences with a seemingly endless appreciation for sitcoms, westerns, and variety shows. Though reality-themed programming was definitively cheaper to produce, the costs of financing television production were not as exorbitant as they would be in subsequent decades. Consequently, there was neither the creative nor financial impetus to produce a wave of reality programming in this decade. 29\n\nTHE 1970S Reality-themed programming would begin a slow and sporadic emergence in the 1970s. While sitcoms, variety shows, character-driven dramas, and made-for-TV movies were still predominant, by the end of the decade the creative stagnancy and growing production costs of these genres created a small opening for reality-dependent programming to establish itself, and thus begin the transformation of the television industry. For many scholars and observers of television, the Public Broadcasting Service’s (PBS) An American Family (1973) stands as not only a pinnacle achievement in the reality genre, but as the genesis of the genre. Of course, the central thesis of the present study would dispute the latter contention; however, the cultural impact of the series cannot be reasonably disputed. The narrative core of An American Family was the Loud\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxli\n\nfamily of Santa Barbara, California: parents Bill and Pat, and their five children, Lance, Delilah, Michele, Kevin, and Grant. The family agreed to let cameras into their home in May 1971, to film their day-to-day activities. The show was conceived and spearheaded by producer/director/documentarian Craig Gilbert, who was also a fixture in the family home during the filming. The result, after eight months of intrusive chronicling, is a hybrid of the traditional documentary and an exercise in cinema verité. Given the unique nature of the circumstances, the family appears remarkably unselfconscious with the cameras around. The Louds seem so much more “real” than the subjects on modern-day reality shows that portray people’s personal lives and relationships. 30 In a flash of post-broadcast recognition, the Louds would regret their naiveté and openness; for during the twelve episodes of the series the family had some highly intimate moments revealed, including probable alcoholism, the public emergence of a homosexual son, alleged marital infidelity, and eventually the onset of divorce proceedings. The public response to the series was diverse and often passionate. To begin with, the show drew approximately ten million viewers per episode, which was a remarkably high rating for non-network television, particularly given that it was a PBS offering, and thus slightly less accessible than major network programming, which may well have discouraged viewers who reflexively dismissed such fare. Whatever the reason, much of the debate generated by the show took on a distinctly academic and intellectual bent. Newspapers and periodicals across the nation featured analysis and critiques from sociologists, anthropologists, and even mental health professionals. Included in these responses were the predictable jeremiads on the collective American family and society in general. Quite unfairly, the Louds became a symbol and central example of America’s moral and cultural decline. A New York Times Magazine article on the series is emblematic of the overwrought condemnation of the Louds: When sorting through the experience of viewing the Louds, my first realization was that all of the avenues of culture as I have understood them were missing from the Loud family life. If there is such a thing as negative culture or culture minus, the Louds have it.\n\nThe same article also revealed the reflexive conservative response to the stereotypically California clan, and liberalism in general:\n\nxl i i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI think the Louds have escaped the small town mores of an earlier America. They have been educated and led into a large vacuum, and like the rest of us are cast out without the structure of work and religion that used to shape the days. We have so much freedom we are now cultural Neanderthal. 31\n\nThese critiques are similar to those voiced in recent years as the reality genre has continually slid down the slippery slope of morality and social responsibility. In most assessments of An American Family, the central question posed was, how authentic and representative was the Loud family? Acclaimed anthropologist Margaret Mead was a vocal supporter of the series, declaring the show to be “as new and significant as the invention of drama or the novel—a new way in which people can learn to look at life, by seeing the real life of others interpreted by the camera.” On the other end of the spectrum was the renowned Sociologist Herbert Gans, who diminished the impact of the Loud family by calling them “a sample of one” and doubting the deeper implications of the series, saying that “all the talk about the show’s meaning is ill founded. It is a single family portrait and nothing more.” Much like participants in modern reality shows, the Loud family found themselves greatly disappointed with how they were represented. The mother of the family, Pat, was surprised by the end product—“I think they have dealt badly with our honor and trust”—pointing out that the producers “left out all the joyous, happy hours of communication and fun.” Bill Loud, the father of the family, was equally dismayed. “If they filmed 25 normal scenes and five bizarre scenes a day, they picked the five bizarre scenes and only one of the normal ones for the finished piece.” This selective if not manipulative style of editing became the lifeblood of the “fly on the wall” style of reality shows that proliferated beginning in the 1990s. 32 Despite their initial disappointment, the Loud family did not shun the public spotlight. Months after the show aired, members of the family were still granting interviews and appearing on various TV talk shows, most notably The Dick Cavett Show. In the aftermath of the series, perhaps the most prescient and revealing quote came from the oldest son, Lance, who had emerged as openly gay during the filming. Lance celebrated and concurrently mocked the family exposé and collateral fame: “The series was the fulfillment of the middle class dream that you can\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxliii\n\nbecome famous for being just what you are. This is actually the greatest thing I’ve done to date.” 33 If the truth could somehow be extracted, this would have to be the credo for most of the modern participants in reality programming. It is easy to see why some people might point to An American Family as the genesis of the modern genre and a subsequent wave of reality programming. Clearly, similarities exist in how the PBS show and modern reality shows are shot and edited. The social commentary and criticism produced by the show are reminiscent of contemporary reactions. Just as the Loud family was upset with their representation on their show, many modern participants bemoan their allegedly unfair characterization on a given show. And while it was not the reason they did the show, the Loud family, particularly Lance, seemed drawn to the flame of cheap celebrity, as are virtually all modern-day reality subjects. All that being said, An American Family can just as easily be called a traditional documentary, or an experiment in cinema verité in the mode of Woodstock (1970), Hospital (1970), and Grey Gardens (1975). That An American Family has been labeled a seminal reality program is a consequence of the search for a reasonable and culturally comfortable explanation for the origins of a now dominant genre. It is a recategorization of the show, decades after it aired. However, in point of fact, An American Family exists in splendid isolation. There was no easily definable collection of imitators that followed in its successful footsteps; nor were there subgenres of reality programming produced by those attempting to capitalize on an emerging trend. The most successful and closest thematic descendant to An American Family is The Real World (Music Television [MTV], 1992); but there was an almost two-decade gap between the two shows. The break between the shows is too wide to make a strong case that the PBS show gave birth to the commercial success of the MTV offering, or the other reality-themed shows that proliferated in the 1990s; though there are some observers who point to The Real World as the seminal reality program that touched off a wave of reality media. Undoubtedly, An American Family created a cultural mark in its time, but it did not produce a “wave” that led to the growth of reality media; that distinction belongs to Real People. The mid- to late 1970s would produce one of the enduring syndicated TV stalwarts of 1980s reality programming, PM Magazine, also known\n\nxl i v\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nas Evening Magazine in some local markets. The show began to air on KPIX in San Francisco, on August 2, 1976. The show was essentially a local thirty-minute newsmagazine, with self-help, how-to, and entertainment options geared toward the Bay Area market. KPIX was one of a string of five local stations across the nation owned by a broadcasting entity known as Group W. When Evening Magazine became successful in San Francisco, Group W decided to replicate the format on its other stations. By 1978, the format was being sold and syndicated to non–Group W stations, as PM Magazine. Over several years in the late 1970s, a rigid format for the show emerged. Each local PM Magazine had its own set of telegenic male and female hosts who would introduce each of the stories and features. The show’s appearance was also standardized by using uniform animated graphics and theme music for each local variant. The unique component of PM Magazine was the dual foci of the show, which allowed it to present segments that were of both local and national origin. By the early 1980s, Group W had created a cooperative production structure that allowed local stations to craft their own PM Magazine geared to their market. Each local station in the syndicated chain agreed to create segments of local origin; these local segments were then placed into a pool of stories from which any other local station in the co-op could select. In other words, a station in Austin, Texas, in addition to its own locally produced stories, had access to segments filmed all over the nation. This was quite a web of national coverage when you consider that by the mid1980s there were almost one hundred stations in the PM/Evening Magazine network. 34 Former PM Magazine executive and later professor of communications Richard Crew offers an encapsulation of the finished nightly product: Each PM Magazine contained two, six-minute people-oriented stories, the mandatory locally-hosted wraps, and a set of three short lifestyle “tips” covering areas like health, how-to advice, and restaurant reviews. The resulting blend gave each market’s PM show national scope, a quality look, and an important local identity. 35\n\nThere is a reasonable debate to be had over whether PM Magazine influenced the creation of Real People, or whether Real People fueled the popularity of the PM Magazine format. The original PM Magazine pre-\n\nI N T RODU CT I ON\n\nxlv\n\ndated Real People by over two years, and additional local versions aired in a handful of markets by the time Real People premiered. However, it was not until after Real People (as well as its imitators) became a massive ratings success that the PM Magazine brand began its own tremendous growth. Clearly, the national success of reality programming made the local variety more appealing and viable to programmers around the nation. The nascent cable network Showtime also delved into the hybrid newsmagazine/reality realm with an occasional show entitled What’s Up America? (1978–1981). Given the more liberal content restrictions on cable, the show often delved into more intense, even adult subject matter than would be found on broadcast television. If one is willing to look well down the limited food chain of 1970s reality-themed programming, they will find shows such as The Gong Show (1976–1980) and The $1.98 Beauty Contest (1978). Both of these shows were born out of the unique creative talents of Chuck Barris. The game show impresario Barris was also the brain behind reality-tinged shows such as The Dating Game (1965–1973) and The Newlywed Game (1966–1980), both of which drew their entertainment from real people contestants. The Gong Show became a hugely popular daytime talent show by employing some of the least and oddly talented performers one could imagine. The highlight of every episode was usually the dismissal of the worst contestants with the flamboyant sounding of a gong, delivered by a panel of lesser celebrities. The $1.98 Beauty Contest was an updated Queen for a Day, but with an alleged wink to satire, as the contestants engaged in talent and swimsuit competitions. Both of these shows were undeniably crass and exploitative, yet entertaining to their own constituencies; though television critics and social commentators were not among them. 36 The Barris stable of shows could not have been done without real people or amateur performers, thus again affirming the entertainment value of real people. However, these shows exist on the shadowy periphery of 1970s reality-themed programs, more evocative of television’s past, rather than presaging its immediate future. Shows such as PM Magazine, What’s Up America?, and Charles Kuralt’s “On the Road,” and to a lesser degree programs like The Gong Show, reveal the potential opportunities for reality-themed programs. The missing element was a catalytic agent to expand and accelerate the presence of reality programming in the national consciousness. Real People was the missing ingredient and\n\nxl v i\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ntransformative force that would cement reality programming as a fixture in the television industry, beginning in 1979.\n\n1 THE GOLDEN GUT STRIKES AGAIN 1979–1980\n\nOn June 8, 1978, Fred Silverman began his reign as the president of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Six months earlier, Silverman had been lured away from the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) with promises of more money, executive perks, and extensive power to shape NBC into a network that reflected his philosophy of television programming. To many observers, both inside and outside the television industry, the money and power awarded to Silverman appeared well deserved. At forty-one years old, Silverman had dedicated all of his adult life to television. In 1960, while at the Ohio State University, he had written a master’s thesis assessing ABC’s prime-time schedule from 1953 to 1959. He then thrived as a programmer at independent stations WGN in Chicago and WPIX in New York, until landing an executive position at the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1963. While at CBS he rose to the position of programming chief, in which he was responsible for the production and scheduling of classic hit shows such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show (1970–1977), All in the Family (1971–1983), M*A*S*H (1972–1983), and The Waltons (1971–1981). Frustrated by a staid, cautious, and stagnant executive culture at CBS, Silverman jumped at an opportunity to become the president of ABC Entertainment in 1975. While it was certainly a professional milestone for Silverman, and he was widely respected among his peers, few in the television industry expected his ascendency to alter the status quo of the major networks. 1\n\n2\n\nCHA P TER 1\n\nNonetheless, in three years at ABC he was able to achieve what many in television had thought unimaginable. In 1976, after more than two decades as the perennially lowest-rated network, ABC finished first in the Nielsen ratings, dethroning CBS, the twenty-year reigning champion. Silverman had engineered this reversal of fortune with a deft programming touch and with a little help left over from his ABC predecessors. The result was a lineup of ratings powerhouses, including Happy Days, Starsky and Hutch, Charlie’s Angels, Three’s Company, Laverne and Shirley, and the groundbreaking mini-series Roots. 1 However, Silverman was not without his vocal critics. For more than a decade there had been an almost continuous critical drumbeat assailing the excessive sex and violence on television; by the late 1970s it had become a deafening torrent for the executives at the three major networks. Though he was not alone in his programming tastes, Silverman was regularly singled out for the violence in such shows as Starsky and Hutch and Baretta and various made-for-TV films. He was also alternately credited and blamed for the use of over-the-top sexuality and objectification of the female form in his shows—what the critics derisively called “jiggle TV.” Whether it was the bikini-clad female detectives on Charlie’s Angels, the equally underdressed beauties on Three’s Company, or just the continual stretching of the boundaries of sexual content and imagery, Silverman appeared to many as the standard-bearer of moral decay in the nation’s most powerful medium. Equally irritating for the social critics was that in the ultracompetitive and ultimately unoriginal arena of television, it was not long before the other networks were trying to match the sexually charged Silverman formula. The success of ABC guaranteed there would be even more bounce in jiggle TV. 2 In early 1978, Silverman’s contract with ABC was up for renewal; most industry insiders assumed he would stay with a number one network that was essentially his creation. However, NBC offered Silverman opportunities that ABC could or would not match. Not only did NBC offer a huge salary increase and executive incentives, but he was also presented with a more prestigious title, president of NBC broadcasting, which included control over the company’s entire entertainment division, in both television and radio. There was also an additional enticement designed to appeal to Silverman’s purportedly massive ego. As the distant third-place network, NBC presented a clean slate upon which Silverman could craft another remarkable “worst to first” transformation. Transforming NBC\n\nT H E GOLDE N GU T ST RI K ES A GA IN\n\n3\n\ninto the number one network was a daunting challenge. In the 1977–1978 season, NBC had only two original programs finish in the top twenty rated shows, and just a small collection of programs considered successful, notably Little House on the Prairie, The Big Event, The Rockford Files, CHiPs, and Quincy. As a mark of the weakness of NBC programming, its most reliable program, both in ratings and revenue, was the long-running Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Some observers of television mockingly said that NBC stood for “Nothing But Carson.” In hiring Silverman, NBC had added a man who even at a young age was one of the legendary programmers in the history of the medium; someone so well known and respected that in the fall of 1977 he was deemed worthy of a Time magazine cover story, in which his programming instincts earned him the sobriquet “the Man with the Golden Gut.” In addition to the programming brilliance, NBC was also purchasing some cultural cache. Silverman brought with him name recognition and badly needed positive publicity, if not credibility, for a struggling network. As a measure of Silverman’s status and influence, on the day in January of 1978 when his defection was announced, the Wall Street stock price of ABC dropped $1.75 a share, while stock in the parent company of NBC, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), jumped $1.25. 3 Though Silverman’s de"
