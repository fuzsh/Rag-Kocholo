One of the simplest reasons for this is the opportunity to enjoy the stunning views of the Rockies under clear blue skies, all visible through the glass-roof windows of these trains. But then, the good news is that we Indians can now have such an experience right here, in our own country.\n\nThanks to the Central Railways, we can now take a ride from Mumbai to Goa on Vistadome, a coach that has a glass roof, rotating chairs and LCD television among other interesting things. Starting September 18, the Jan Shatabdi Express running between Dadar and Madgaon has the Vistadome coach attached to it!\n\nAmong the premium features of this coach are the wide windowpanes and a button-powered transparent roof, all offering some stunning views of the Western Ghats to the passengers. Well, windows are not the only thing that the coach is worth a ride in. Each of the 40 seats in this coach have the capacity to rotate 360 degrees and have pushback facility as well. Apart from this, some of the other new and interesting features in this coach include the presence of 12 LCD television screens for entertainment, a mini fridge, automatic sliding compartment doors, an oven, juicer grinder and toilets fitted with ceramic tiles.\n\nDesigned specially for travelling between Mumbai and Goa, this first-of-its-kind glass-top coach in the Indian Railways has been developed at a cost of INR 3.38 crores. The former Railway Minister, Suresh Prabhu, while launching the coach a few months ago, said that it is being introduced to promote tourism. The bookings for this coach are already open and each seat in this coach costs INR 2,235 excluding GST, reservation charges and other miscellaneous charges, if any.\n\nend of article\n\nAlso Read"
