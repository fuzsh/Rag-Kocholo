        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nAs a regional surge in COVID-19 cases grips the area, more local arts and entertainment events have either been cancelled or postponed in the St. Louis metropolitan area. The month-long “Hamilton” national tour stop at the Fox is now postponed, the Opera Theatre of St. Louis has cancelled its festival season and people are now moving dates from spring to either later in the year or 2021.\n\nBased on the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization’s recommendations on social distancing and against large group gatherings, St. Louis city and county, St. Charles County and Illinois put a public health emergency plan in place. They have shutdown gatherings of 10 or more, encouraged social distancing and ordered everyone to Stay-at-Home. Announced dates: St. Louis quarantine is through April 22; Illinois is through April April 30; Missouri is through April 24; and the nation is recommended until April 30.\n\nHere is a round-up of the latest on community theater, regional professional theater, national touring shows, certain events and venues.

That is available through April 24.\n\nAdditionally, The Rep is collaborating with a national group of theatres to commission a series of short plays specifically developed to spark joy and connection among people who are sheltering in place. These initiatives are designed to keep the art alive and vital, even in a time of isolating quarantines.\n\n“Keep an eye out for more entertaining content and educational resources from The Rep and our local and national partners by following us on social media,” spokesman Jeremy Goldmeier said.\n\nOn March 27, The Rep announced that they have honored the entire contracts of the guest artists who devoted their talents to “Dreaming Zenzile” and “The Cake,” despite their runs being delayed or cut short.\n\n“In these uncertain times, The Rep felt it was imperative that these artists, whose livelihoods depend on their contracts, not bear the additional burden of lost wages in this pandemic,” a statement said.\n\n“As you know, The Rep has an extraordinarily talented and dedicated staff that works year-round to support the productions, education, and community initiatives to serve the greater St. Louis region. We have continued to pay the full salaries of our full-time, year-round administrative staff, with no furloughs or other lapses in pay. We have moved our administrative and box office teams to work remotely to serve you during this period,” a statement said.\n\nPlay at Home\n\nThe Repertory Theatre of St. Louis has teamed with Baltimore Center Stage, Long Wharf Theatre, The Public Theater and Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company to present Play at Home, a series of micro-commissioned short plays from some of the American theatre’s most exciting and prominent playwrights.\n\nThese new plays – which all run 10 minutes or less – are available for the public to download, read and perform at home for free at playathome.org.\n\nIn the wake of widespread event cancellations following the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the participating theatres conceived Play at Home as a way to support artists, connect people to theatre, and to ignite imagination and joy in these uncertain times.\n\nEach organization commissioned multiple playwrights – most of whom had plays canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak – to create new works that were big, joyful and not bound by the constraints of what might be “possible” on a traditional stage.\n\nThe Rep’s commissioned playwrights feature:\n\nRegina Taylor (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 production of Oo-Bla-Dee)\n\nKaren Zacarias (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 production of Native Gardens)\n\nSteph Del Rosso (playwright of The Rep’s 2020-2021 world premiere of The Gradient)\n\nGuadalís Del Carmen (who appeared at The Rep as an actor in 2020’s Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles)\n\nTre’von Griffith (a St. Louis performer and playwright, co-founder of TLT Productions)\n\nThese plays are meant to be read at home among family and friends, and we highly encourage readers to share photos or videos of their home performances on social media using the hashtag #playathome.\n\nMax and Louie Productions\n\nEstelle Siteman of Max & Louie Productions said they optimistically look forward to bringing the second play of our 2020 season,”Looking for Normal” by Jane Anderson to the Marcelle. “This beautiful ,moving play full of wit and wisdom opens July 16 through the 26.2020,” she said.\n\nMoonstone Theatre Company\n\nSharon Hunter said Moonstone Theatre Company has postponed their July opening of “The House of Blue Leaves” to July of 2021 at the Wool Studio Theatre at the J. They will announce our season shortly. which will now begin in November 2020 with a Neil Simon comedy.\n\nThe Midnight Company\n\nMidnight Artistic Director Joe Hanrahan has moved his one-man play from May 28 – June 13 to a June 4 – 20 run. This is the premiere of the full version of “Now Playing Third Base for the St. Louis Cardinals…Bond, James Bond,” which will be at The Chapel, 4238 Alexander Drive, 63105. Performances are Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with a matinee on Sunday at 2 p.m.\n\nIt was performed in a shortened version at the 2018 St. Louis Fringe Festival, and audiences responded enthusiastically and critics raved. Snoops Theatre Thoughts said “A delightful show that’s part personal memoir, part history lesson, part nostalgia, and all fascinating. A difficult show to describe but what it is is excellent.” Limelight said “Hanrahan jumps from omniscient narrator to 15-year old movie fanatic to baseball and theatre historian, the audience hanging on every word. The Cardinals are the talk of the town again. This show should be the talk of the town, too!”\n\nHanrahan said, “There’s never been a play we’ve done that’s received such enthusiastic, visceral reaction, due, surely, to the St. Louis history of the show. At the Fringe, productions are limited to one-hour playing time, and this new version will allow us to incorporate new material that should make the show ever more entertaining and informative.”\n\n“Now Playing Third Base for the St. Louis Cardinals…Bond, James Bond,” concerns a teen-age boy in 1964. JFK’s assassination still casts a pall on the nation. The Beatles’ emergence in February of ’64 starts to lighten the mood of the nation. The Cardinals continue the good times in St. Louis with a mad dash toward the pennant. And when a new movie hero hits the screens that summer, a bunch of boys on a baseball field have their first theatre experience when one of their gang offers a 30-minute one-man show of “From Russia with Love.” Throughout, the playwright draws links between what’s happened and happening – from JFK to James Bond, from segregation in St. Louis to segregation in baseball’s Southern Leagues and Florida stadiums where The Beatles were supposed to play, from WWII to British film production crews and JFK hit squads, from the first cave man who stood up by the fire to the theatre musings of Peter Brook…all of it swirling in front of the eyes of a young boy, and the memory of that time.\n\nShane Signorino will direct the show as he did at The Fringe (Shane just received a Theatre Critics Circle nomination as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for Midnight’s POPCORN FALLS), Kevin Bowman will serve as Production Designer, Michael B. Perkins will design video support (as he did for Midnight productions of A MODEL FOR MATISSE, JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG, and LITTLE THING BIG THING), and Elizabeth Henning will be Stage Manager.\n\nThere will also be a concurrent exhibit in The Chapel lobby of memorabilia from 1950’s/60’s baseball and James Bond films, presented by George Venegoni.\n\nNew Line Theatre\n\nNew Line managed to get two weekends of performances of “Head Over Heels” before the local government mandates of crowd size forced it to close early in mid-March.\n\nIts June production of “Urinetown” has been cancelled.\n\nStray Dog Theatre\n\n“Annie,” which was to open April 9, has been postponed, with dates to be announced.\n\n“We will honor all tickets already purchased to any of the new performance dates once they are announced.

Bell.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone for the hard work they’ve already put into the production and we would like to thank you for your patience as we work to bring you the quality story telling you, our family, deserve. Annie is that bit of light we all need right now, ‘the sun will come out tomorrow’ and we will overcome anything,” Bell said.\n\n“We know we are not the only organization dealing with these difficult decisions and we stand with them, ready to come back stronger. Your continued support of all arts organizations is always appreciated but never more than in times like these. We look forward to seeing you soon,” he said. “Please stay safe and be kind to one another.”\n\nKenneth Lonergan’s “Lobby Hero” is set to run June 4 – June 20\n\n“However, due to the extreme strain currently being faced by many organizations we have made the decision to halt online sales of upcoming productions. We will resume online sales once matters have settled and the timeline of events moving forward becomes more defined,” Bell said.\n\n“You may continue to purchase tickets for upcoming shows by calling our Box Office at (314) 856-1995 or emailing us at boxoffice@straydogtheatre.org.

On April 7, Andrew Jorgensen, general director of Opera Theatre, announced the cancellation of the 2020 festival season that was to open May 23 and run through June 28 with this repertory: the world premiere of Tobias Picker and Aryeh Lev Stollman’s Awakenings, Bizet’s gripping opera Carmen, Strauss’ effervescent comedy Die Fledermaus, and the long-awaited company premiere of Carlisle Floyd’s Susannah.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the size of seasonal staff required to produce each opera season, it is not possible for us to assemble the same casts, creative teams, and backstage artisans at any other point in the next several months. Even if we could postpone our season by a month, we simply don’t know when it will be safe for groups to gather again.\n\nAt this time, there is no active plan in place to move any of the 2020 productions into the 2021 Festival Season. However, they are still evaluating various options and scenarios — stay tuned for more!\n\nFor a complete list of all affected programs and public events, including information on whether an event is canceled or postponed, visit the website and scroll down for a complete list:\n\nhttps://www.opera-stl.org/beyond-the-stage/updates-regarding-covid-19\n\nThis page will be updated frequently in the weeks ahead as new information becomes available regarding the status of events, including possible rescheduling or digital streaming.\n\n“As always, our highest priority is the health of the entire OTSL family — patrons, staff, and artists,” the statement reads.\n\nShakespeare Festival St. Louis\n\nThe 2020 Shakespeare in the Park production of “Much Ado About Nothing” has been moved to Aug. 12 – Sept. 6. Producing Artistic Director Tom Ridgely said it was in order to provide the best possible chance of safely gathering artists and audiences for its 20th anniversary season. It is to be directed by Bruce Longworth.\n\n“For the past 20 years in St. Louis, the opening of Shakespeare in the Park has helped to mark the unofficial start of summer,” Ridgely said. “This year it’s clear that the only way to care for our actors, crew, volunteers and community is to give as much time as possible for social distancing measures to take effect and hope to be one of the ways we all bring our summer 2020 to a much happier close.”\n\nThe previously announced creative team of Matt Pace & Brien Seyle (Original Music), Josh Smith (Scenic Design), Dorothy Englis (Costume Design), John Wylie (Lighting Design) and Kathy Ruvuna (Sound Design) remains the same.\n\nIn response to the widespread cancellation of live events, the Festival has already shifted to generating a full schedule of new and original content for the online and social media platforms under the umbrella of “ShakespeareTV.”\n\nThese include the previously aired “watch party” of its canceled regional tour of Cymbeline, a live reading of “Venus and Adonis” (which Shakespeare wrote during a plague-induced theater closure) and a five-night reading of Albert Camus’ postwar masterpiece “The Plague.” Together they’ve already been viewed 10,000 times.\n\nNow through May 29 on ShakespeareTV, which can be accessed on their Facebook page:\n\nTHE ZOOM PLAYS: a weekly series of 20- to 30-minute original plays written especially to be performed live over the videoconferencing app Zoom. Created and performed by local playwrights, directors and actors.\n\nGREEN SHOW MONDAYS: an eclectic variety program featuring music, comedy and performance from Festival favorites.\n\nSHAKESPEARE AND CHILL: a special selection of Shakespeare-inspired movies featuring live commentary from artists and scholars, co-curated by Cinema St. Louis.\n\nOther one-night only events to be announced.\n\nMay 29 – June 21 is SHAKE20\n\nA 20th anniversary reboot of the beloved engagement program SHAKE38 featuring community responses to 20 of Shakespeare’s plays streaming on Facebook and Instagram Tuesdays through Sundays 8 p.m. during the Festival’s originally scheduled run, May 29-June 21.\n\nLike the original, SHAKE20 will be a region-wide collaboration involving artists and organizations including SHAKE38 alumni: Slightly Askew Theater, Prison Performing Arts: The Alumni Group, RS-Theatrics, Poor Monsters and Theater Nuevo. More details about the program and how to apply will be shared soon.\n\n“In the meantime, we hope that you and yours stay well. We have planned an incredible season of free Shakespeare, and we cannot wait to share it with you. It’s an interesting time to be in the business of live theatre and touring productions, but the Festival is committed to paying our artists and staff throughout this crisis,” Ridgely said.\n\nSo, if you have ever considered becoming a member, know that we are always grateful for your support—but especially so at this time,” he said.\n\n“During this crisis, we feel more connected to Shakespeare and his contemporaries than ever before. Biographer Jonathan Bate wrote, ‘The Plague was the single most powerful force shaping [Shakespeare’s] life and those of his contemporaries.’ During times of quarantine, Shakespeare wrote some of his most important sonnets and plays,” Ridgely said.\n\n“We can’t claim to have his genius, but we will take inspiration from his dedication and from artists around the world that are stepping up to create, facilitate, and share stories in new and exciting ways. Stay tuned for updates on new and existing Festival programs,” he said.\n\nFor more information, visit the website sfstl.com and on social media.

It was the final production of the group’s 109th season.\n\n“As our country copes with the growing threat of the Coronavirus, one of the most important steps we must take to protect ourselves and each other is the kind of “social distancing” that is impossible at a theatrical production. Our Board of Directors believes it is highly unlikely that the need for social distancing will be any less in April than it is today, and decided that the best course of action for our company and our patrons was to act now to cancel the show,” a statement reads.\n\nPatrons who have purchased advance tickets through Brown Paper Tickets will be issued automatic refunds.

As we watch music education and theatre programs rapidly die\n\nin our schools, the need to keep community theatre alive is more important now\n\nthan ever,” McCreight said.\n\nThe best musical award was the first for Curtain’s Up\n\nTheater Company, and with his win, director Glenn Saltamachia made AFL history.\n\nHe is the first person to win both Best Director Awards at the Best Performance\n\nAwards and at the Theatre Mask Awards in April, which honors dramas and\n\ncomedies.

To win the TMA and BPA for\n\nDirecting in the same year is an honor I could never have dreamed of. I have worked with two outstanding companies-\n\n– LGP and CUTC, and I have been blessed and extremely lucky to have had\n\noutstanding, talented, wonderful casts, production crews, technicians, and\n\nmusicians to work with,” Saltamachia said.\n\n“The honor is more a\n\nreflection of their talent, hard work and determination than anything I have\n\nbrought to the table. I have always said my greatest talent as a director is\n\nthat I surround myself with extremely talented, capable people who share my\n\npassion for good theatre. The fact that both my shows also won for Best\n\nEnsemble in their respective categories proves my point,” he said.\n\nSaltamachia said he was bit by the theater bug when as a\n\nbrand new second lieutenant in the Air Force, he auditioned for the Kessler Air\n\nForce Base Little Theatre production of “Charley’s Aunt.”\n\n“Throughout my Air Force career, I would participate in productions wherever we\n\nwere stationed when I had the time and circumstances allowed,” he said. “After\n\nretiring from the Air Force in 1997 in Belleville, I began to hear of all the\n\ngreat local community theaters, and in 1999, I got up the nerve to audition for\n\nthe Looking Glass Playhouse production of “Oliver!” and I’ve never stopped.”\n\nSaltamachia has directed 10 shows for LGP since 2001, his\n\nfirst being “The Odd Couple.” Then, he worked with some Edwardsville people who\n\nwere starting a theater company, Curtain’s Up. He appeared in “The Curious\n\nSavage” and has directed six shows for them, the first was “Fiddler on the\n\nRoof” in 2008.\n\nOver the years, he has directed shows for Clinton County\n\nShowcase in Breese, Hard Road Productions in Highland, and in Belleville, Brass\n\nRail Players, Downtown Players and Cathedral Players.\n\n“The thing I love most about directing is the process. I\n\nlove everything about it! From script\n\nanalysis, planning conferences for concept development, set design and staging\n\nmonths before production. Then the fun starts with auditions and rehearsals,”\n\nhe said. “But the absolute best part is watching as a group of diverse people;\n\nwho may not have known each other before, come together, work hard and share\n\ntheir talents to produce something we are all are proud of. And on the way we\n\nbecome a family who love each other and develop friendships for life.”\n\n“Thanks to AFL. I am honored and humbled, but I am smart\n\nenough to know I didn’t win these awards by myself,” Saltamachia said.\n\n“Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” Goshen Theatre ProjectTerry Pattison, who won awards for costume design and set\n\ndesign for Goshen Theatre Project, said the group is in its fifth season.\n\n“The Lion King had 46 kids in it, all under the age of 15.\n\nThere were well over 160 costumes, all hand-created. Most of the masks and\n\nanimals were constructed from a high-density foam so they stayed light weight,”\n\nshe said.\n\nThe animal costumes included: Lions, lioness, hornbills,\n\nostrich, zebra, gazelle, egrets, giraffes, wildebeasts, rhino, meerkat, warthog\n\nand various birds.\n\n“I am honored to\n\nhave received two BPA’s this year, one for costuming and the other for scenic\n\ndesign. I am always creating something in one way or another and it is a\n\nhumbling experience to have been recognized against all the other talent in the\n\nSt. Louis community theater circuit,” Pattison said.\n\nLucinda Gyurci, who founded Arts for Life in 1998, said she\n\ncontinues to be inspired by community theater productions.\n\n“Big Fish” Shooting Star Productions“I feel fortunate to have watched many young people, who\n\ngrew up in community theatre, become wonderfully talented adults; some making\n\ntheir way to Broadway; some establishing their art in local professional\n\ntheatre; and some bringing up their next generation in their own footsteps on\n\nthe stage,” she said.\n\nJoe Paule Sr. received the Lifetime Achievement Award for\n\nhis work as a musician in numerous pit bands, orchestras and as a music\n\ndirector. Kim Klick and Glenn Guillermo were honored with two special awards,\n\n“TRG Recognition 20th Anniversary Exceptional Volunteer Award,” citing\n\nextraordinary above and beyond service.\n\nSean Harvey “Crazy for You”\n\nTwo special youth awards were given to Caroline Santiago\n\nTurner, who received Best Youth Musical Performance for “Violet,” and\n\nSean Harvey, named Best Youth Featured Dancer, as Bobby in “Crazy for\n\nYou,” both produced by the Gateway Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nAllison McDonald of Timberland High School and Kira Averett\n\nof Mascoutah received the 2019 AFL Youth Scholarships.\n\nThe ceremony was directed by Ken Clark, with music\n\ndirection by Diane Hanisch.
