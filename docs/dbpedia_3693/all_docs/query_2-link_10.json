        "text": "Playing It Straight - Fox show where a woman dated a bunch of guys, some of whom were - shocker!- actually gay. Cheesy but there were some really hot guys.\n\nMr. Personality - a woman dates a bunch of guys wearing creepy masks. Hosted by Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe Littlest Groom - Nuff Said\n\n\"Pirate Master\" didn't even air all of its episodes in 2007 but burned them off on CBS.com.\n\nKathy Hilton's show was so horribly bad but fun! Snootily telling people they weren't good enough to \"be a Hilton\"!\n\nTLC had the shows \"In A Fix\" and \"Clean Sweep\" which were \"Trading Spaces\" coattail riders but they both had a LOT of hot \"carpenters\" on them.\n\nI LOVED \"While You Were Out\"! Even Farmer was so cute and I'm heartbroken that he is allegedly straight. He was so gay on the show! And Jason Cameron was very hot, too!\n\nTrading Spouses - ok, not totally forgotten thanks to the GOD WARRIOR, but almost. There were some other episodes almost as crazy as that one. A couple memorable ones were a hillbilly family that had a pine nut farm and this weird hippie family from CA who always went barefoot and slept in the same bed (think they had 2 boys around puberty age). I thought it was vastly superior to Wife Swap because the episodes were long enough that you really got to know these freaks, and the \"twist\" with the money at the end resulted in some classic reality tv momentslike the God Warrior's meltdown.\n\nNYC Prep - this show was horrifying and hilarious! I binged it on Netflix - I think it might still be there. Wonder where those creeps are nowadays, especially PC.\n\nHow Clean Is Your House? - before Hoarders, this was the show that made me feel better about my lazy housekeeping.\n\n\"Lost\"\n\nTeams are dropped blindfolded into a \"mystery\" country. The teams don't know each other, they are paired up for the show. They are given no money until they figure out where they are. Then with minimal resources they must find their way to the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThere were two seasons, the first started in Mongolia and the second in Bolivia. Perhaps a victim of the huge success of The Amazing Race, they premiered around the same time.\n\nIt wasn't too bad but ratings were dismal. Far far worse has come along since then.\n\nThe Amazing Race rip-off is coming back to me... I think it was called \"Lost\".\n\nDiscovery Kids had a Survivor for tweens called \"Endurance\" that was actually really well done. I watched that even though I wasn't part of the target audience. (I must have been about 30 at the time.)\n\nMTV had Sorority Life, and the inferior Fraternity Life. Both shows were atrocious, but it was fun to watch them getting drunk with friends and ripping the sisters and pledges apart.\n\nTrue Beauty. Vanessa Minillo and Carson Kressley looking for the most beautiful person without telling the contestants that they are looking for \"inner\" beauty and tricking the contestants with various temptations (cheating, backstabbing, that sort of thing) that are filmed with hidden cameras. In the second season (yes there was one) Vanessa is kept away from the contestants until they are being eliminated and face the reason why they got booted (because they got caught being \"ugly\").\n\nLong before \"Survivor\" brought Reality TV to our lives (the competition type anyway), there was a show on weekends where guys and girls competed from different colleges, remember? Except EVERY challenge had a sexual undertone to it so it was ahead of its time -- \"Girls, you will take this hose and suck up all the jelly from your guy partner's shorts! Ready?!\" I would watch it with my mouth dropped.\n\nWhat was the MTV one where they went to schools and paid cash to get them to do gross stuff? I remember one hideous dykey girl eating a ball of hair (and wax) for $100 and it still makes me ant to vomit.\n\nA couple of years ago there was a show where three teams were trapped in a cage or room and had to escape without being caught by the guards. There were three levels or parts and at the end the winner received some huge cash prize. Each episode took place in a different location (prison, airfield, jungle/swamp, battleship, etc.) I kind of liked that one, but can't remember the name.\n\n\"Starting Over\", a daily reality soap opera where troubled women live in a house and are counseled by.....wait for it....Iyanla, right after her blow up with Oprah. But the highpoint was a life coach named Rhonda Britten. She had one patient named Lisa that she completely loathed. Once Lisa stood her up during an assignment and for her punishment, Rhonda locked her in a cage. She told Lisa with an evil smile on her face \"you know I'd never do anything to humiliate you.\" Towanda Braxton was also a housemate\n\nRU the Girl - where Chilli and T-Boz looked for a replacement for Left Eye and went with someone named OSO Crispy....to join TLC and then never heard from her again. P Diddy Starmaker - A Mark Burnett/Diddy show like Idol The Road To Stardom with Missy Elliot - Winner was some girl who had a record deal already. Fashion Star on NBC - a show that was a blatant home shopping program. Styled to Rock with Rhianna -Yeah this one was bad Pop Stars - Before there was Idol there was Pop Stars on the WB - with Eden's Crush and Scene 23 the second season. I wanna marry Harry - where they had a Prince Harry look alike...\n\nPeople forget Kristen Wiig starred in that first season of \"Joe Schmo\".\n\nYigit was the winner of \"Top Chef: Desserts\" (on DVD, by the way, I put it on in background sometimes). He was adorable. The crazy guy was in that season too, he was hot but nuts. Oh and the other almost winner, cute in a seedy way, was arrested for child porn, I think. To my shock!\n\nI think \"Fashion Star\" was the one where a male contestant told a female judge her opinion meant nothing to him because he was a menswear designer and Jessica Simpson told him \"Women are ruling the world\" and got a big round of applause. He got kicked off. The whole thing was pretty much vomit. One contestant from Austin got his 15 minutes and did a fashion runway show in a mall there with Tim Gunn. I was embarrassed to be there. AND you had to go buy $100 worth of Lucky Brand cheap shit even to talk to Gunn, ha, fuck that. I left.\n\n\"The Pick-Up Artist\", where nerds were given truly lame ways to \"score\" with women. Taught by the aptly named Mystery, who lived up to his name as you wonder why any woman, even a blind one, would give him a second look. And he was assisted by his wingmen, who no one gay straight male or female would be attracted to even at last last call.\n\nI watched every episode\n\nR109, I only saw one season (maybe two) in the early 2000's. See if this season sounds familiar: There were a pair of female twins (I think they were religious twins); an older male and some alpha female from Boston. The Boston female made it to the final two. The winner was either an asian male or female and was pretty strategic. I think it was the first season where they brought in ex-bf's and ex-gf's. The asian male was pretty hot IIRC but I don't remember if he was an ex or the contestant.\n\nWere all those people in the same season? If so, it was the only season I watched.\n\nDoes anyone else remember the horrible fashion design competition, \"The Cut,\" starring Tommy Hilfiger?\n\nMuch better was \"Make Me a Supermidel,\" which delighted in putting the straight male contestants in homoerotic photo shoots. (There were girls, too.). It was the launch pad for Ronnie Kroell and his hetero crush Ben, and for Sandhurst, the delectable Trinidadian tour guide on the execrable (current) show \"Tour Group.\"\n\nThere was also \"She's Got the Look,\" a modeling competition for over-40 women featuring Kim Alexis and Beverly Johnson. It gave the world an early glimpse of Leanne Locken, villainess of \"Real Housewives of Dallas.\"\n\nI wish they'd bring back the male modeling show, \"Manhunt,\" which rocketed Matt Lanter to the C-List.\n\nThe one with Flavor Flav, wearing a huge clock around his neck, looking for a woman. There was one episode where all the women contestants were standing together, Flavor was interviewing some, and an obese black woman got so excited, she took a huge dump right on the marble floor in the foyer of the mansion. All the women contestants were freaking out over the smell, not understanding where it came from, until they found the pile of diarrhoea on the floor. The woman was missing though. Flavor went looking for her and found her on the toilet in one of the bathrooms.\n\nI have asked numerous people and none of them remember this, but there was an unbelievably bottom-of-the-barrel Project Runway knock-off called \"STYLE ME with Rachel Hunter.\" It was glorious.\n\nThe challenges were so pathetic (\"Here's your $20 budget, and 2 balls of yarn. Come up with a GLAM LOOK for a sorority girl\"...some lame shit like that...), but for me every week's highlight was when they'd do the rundown of the grand prize, while panning across the contestants' faces. These people would be screaming, praying, almost crying whenever they heard the prize...\"$10,000 and the chance to style Rachel Hunter for an upcoming red carpet event.\"\n\n(BONUS TIDBIT: had a young Carrot Top look-a-like contestant.)\n\nR93, you're a genius to remember Starting Over. I used to watch every night, very late when I was high. I was in college so this is what 12 years ago? I cried a few times when the housemates had breakthroughs!! I believed in life coaches and loved how the show really took its time to fix the problems of these women. Some were there for months before they graduated. I still barely remember it but you have helped me recover a piece of my misspent youth. That was Iyanla, damn. But the blond miss Britton was way more interesting. Those ladies were hardcore.\n\n[quote]Anybody remember Murder in Small Town X? Summer 2001. Really well done, but poor ratings. The winner was a firefighter who died on 9/11\n\nI LOVED \"Murder in Small Town X.\" I don't want to say it was more cerebral than a lot of reality shows, but I did really appreciate that the contestants were rewarded for putting clues together, rather than being able to keep disgusting food town. Plus, setting it in a slightly darker version of Cabot Cove appealed to the Jessica Fletcher in me.\n\nWhat was especially tragic about the winner, Angel's death was that the show's finale aired literally a week before 9/11. One of the other contestants also turned up on The Apprentice.\n\n[quote] I was hoping you were lying [R129]. That look terrible. How weird was the winner?\n\nShe seemed like a nice enough young woman but the whole concept was ridiculously flawed. Sure you can dress anyone up to look like Elvira but you can't copy the humor and voice and personality. Apparently the winner was not well-received when they sent her out to do appearances after winning the show and they quickly ended her run as \"new Elvira.\" Audiences wanted the real Elvira, not some weak copy even if she was approved by the original.\n\nHere's an interesting blog post about the show with an interview with the winner. She put a positive spin on it but I read an interview with Cassandra Peterson where she said the fans were really quite nasty to the winner. She made it sound like the girl's life might have been in danger if they kept sending her out as New Elvira so they just ended that promotion.\n\nBritish TV had a few tragic misfires in the early 2000s - there was Castaway 2000, where a pack of weirdoes were dumped on an island in Scotland and challenged to build a community (twats, the lot of 'em), not to mention the godawful The Bachelor (similar to the American shitefest, and it was highly amusing to see a recognisable male model speaking in a rather squeaky voice) and...duh duh duh - Driving School - which was more of a docu-drama, but it was bollock-shrinkingly bad.\n\nThere was a show called \"Cowboy U\" that had city dwellers competing on a cattle ranch learning how to become cowpokes. A gay man won a second place award and some woman fitness instructor was the winner. It ran from 2003 to 2007.\n\nAlso Richard Branson had a competition to hire someone to be a president of one of his American business', \"The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best\". A blond blue eyed Mormon guy ended up winning, but the results seemed rigged.\n\n[quote] Don't forget I Love Money, with the contestant that committed a murder-suicide.\n\nR160, was that the woman who was chopped up by her bf and put in a dumpster or she was put in a suitcase? I just saw that story, or one similar on ID a week or so ago. The bf was hot and ended up hanging himself before police could find and arrest him.\n\nDoes anyone else remember a Bravo show called \"The It Factor\" which followed showbiz aspirants as they pursued the careers. I watched the first season, which took place in NYC, and apparently there was a second season which took place in LA. Narcissism reigned supreme. The standouts in the season I saw were Daisy Eagan, trying to establish a career as an adult after her Tony win as a little girl (she came off okay), an entitled cunt named Katheryn, and (especially) an arrogant camera hog named Godfrey who later became the 7-Up man.\n\nJust checked he IMDB entry for he show -- it also featured DL fave Jeremy Renner, though I don't remember him at all!\n\n\"The Swan.\" The show featured homely and/or overweight women in a contest to see who, after being sliced up with extensive plastic surgery and undergoing other beauty treatments, would become the most transformed, the one who became \"the swan.\" The winner was given prizes and supposedly her life would be ever so much better after becoming The Swan. One promo featured a woman in hysterics after seeing the results of her beauty regimen, sobbing \"I'm so BEAUTIFUL!\" \"The Swan\" is one lists of \"the worst reality tv shows of all time.\"\n\nBefore the Style Network was revamped as Esquire TV it was home to some trash that I couldn't help but be taken in by. Namely \"Big Rich Texas\" and it's similarly themed spin-off \"Big Rich Atlanta.\" Also \"Jerseylicious\" about Italian hairdressers. Some really great fights on that one, including a brawl in a fast food restaurant parking lot and a club fight where one of them kicked the other in the head. Classy girls, they were.\n\nOn MTV they had a short lived show about young stylists called \"Styled\" which I watched.\n\n\"Chains of Love.\" Originally produced for NBC and then they dropped it before it aired and UPN picked it up. A bachelor or bachelorette was literally chained to members of the opposite sex and one person was unchained each episode. So stupid.\n\nWhat was the one ABC never aired about families competing for a house on a cul-de-sac in Texas? I think it was called \"Welcome to the Neighborhood.\" The neighbors were all horrified when the contestants were liberals and minorities. It never aired because it violated fair housing laws. I'm pretty sure a gay couple won.\n\n[quote]What was the great one with Vitamin C where they had awful singers vying to be an \"Idol\" but somehow made them think they could sing.\n\n\"Superstar USA.\" Someone upthread posted a few clips. What I remember is the last show with the live audience — they told the audience that the contestants were all with Make-A-Wish Foundation and this was their dream, so be sure to cheer loudly no matter how they performed.\n\nIt was hilarious, but the reveal was awful and made you feel bad for watching.\n\nA few years ago Fox announced a limited run of \"Celebrity Swan,\" which was supposed to feature extreme makeovers of DL fave Erin Moran and Monica Lewinsky. I thought the baby Jesus had answered a prayer, but it still hasn't happened.\n\nKept is a reality television series that centered on Jerry Hall (model and ex-wife to Mick Jagger) searching for a kept man. The show premiered on the American cable network VH1 in late May 2005. When Hall narrowed the list down to twelve, she spirited them off to London and eliminated them one by one.\n\nThe final three consisted of Anwar, Austen and Seth. In the August 4 finale, Hall was torn between Austen and Seth but ultimately chose Seth as he knew how to have fun and she thought he had matured throughout the process. Seth claims that he got his $100,000 in prize money but after filming stopped he never saw Jerry, the penthouse apartment, or the Lamborghini again.\n\nMr. Romance is a 2005 US tongue-in-cheek reality television show which aired on Oxygen. It was created by Gene Simmons and hosted by Fabio.\n\nMr. Romance featured a group of 12 male contestants, mentored by Fabio, entering a \"romance academy\" hoping to win a shot at novel cover fame. Each week the contestants would compete in romance-related events like romance novel cover photo shoots and learning to dance, with each contestant rated on their facility in the activity. The two lowest-scoring contestants at the end of the regular season were eliminated and the remaining ten contestants went on to compete in the Mr. Romance Pageant to select the winner. Fabio delivered show-ending homilies on the lesson of each episode.\n\nAt the pageant, Randy Richwood was crowned Mr. Romance.\n\nI vaguely remember Cougars Vs. Kittens; I did watch the entire season of a show where they took women from the lower 48 and bused them up to the tundra of Alaska. This show was on FOX and it was called, \"Bachelorettes in Alaska: Looking For Love\". It was the most degrading show to the women involved. It was supposed to be \"empowering' because the women would do the choosing. In reality it was filled with a bunch of passive-aggressive Alaskan men.\n\nMTV's The 70s House is an American reality television show created by Aaron Matthew Lee. The show premiered on MTV on July 5 and ended September 6, 2005. The show featured twelve contestants (six male, six female) who thought they were participating in a The Real World-type reality show, but instead were thrust into a 24/7 simulation of the 1970s. They were required to part with all modern technology including cell phones, laptops, and MP3 players, as well as all modern clothing and lingo, only to adopt their cultural equivalents of the 1970s. It was billed as a competition to see who can \"be the most 70s.\"\n\nThe twelve contestants were: Andrew Severyn, Ashley McCarthy, Corey Hartwyk, Geo Herrera, Hailley Howard, Jami Stallings, Joey Mendicino, Lynda Khristine, Lee Wireman, Peter, Ruben, and Sarah Bray.\n\nReality show/game show THE MOMENT OF TRUTH: People were hooked up to a lie detector and had to answer intrusive personal questions for money.\n\nI loved this New York Times review:\n\n[quote]Ty, a personal trainer, said yes when he was asked if he has delayed having children because he is not sure that Catia, his wife of two and a half years, would be his “lifelong partner.” After he replied, a disembodied female voice delivered the verdict. “The answer is — ” (long, dramatic beat) “true.” The camera panned to Catia, who stopped smiling and murmured, “I’m dying here.” Her friend April turned to her and asked in a semiwhisper, “Is it worth $100,000 to learn that?”\n\n[quote]As it turned out, Catia got nothing along with the information. When Ty replied no to the question of whether he had ever touched a female client more than was strictly necessary, the polygraph contradicted him, and he lost all his winnings. Ty ran to his wife and tried to hug her. Catia submitted to his embrace but turned her cheek away, [bold]pursing her lips in a foreboding moue of lip gloss and recrimination[/bold].\n\nAnd one of those Bachelorette type of shows except where the girl's two extremely bitchy friends helped pick the winner/guy she'd marry -- who wisely said, after a whole season, that maybe they would get married but not then and not on the air. Her blonde friend was the single biggest cunt on TV except for maybe Rachel Zoe's horrible assistant and Omorosa.\n\nAMAZING how many of these there were, now that we look back on it. And how most didn't play.\n\nPop Idol, the originator of the Idol franchise, ran for two seasons on ITV in Great Britain, only to be shelved permanently in favor of Simon Cowell's X-Factor, along with Britain's Got Talent and BBC's The Voice. It's as if Pop Idol never existed, never mind that it laid the foundation for all the other shows to follow. I've never watched one episode of X-Factor, not even the American version. The most that I've ever seen of the show was Whitney Houston's legendary flop performance in 2009. Wow, that was a disaster of epic proportions. The arrangement was horrible, first off. It bore no resemblance to the actual \"Million Dollar Bill\", Whitney sang too early, and even the backing singers were off, way off.\n\nTake Home Chef is a half-hour reality cooking show starring Curtis Stone. It originally aired on TLC.[\n\nIn each episode, Stone introduces himself to a stranger in a grocery store, typically a woman in her 20s or 30s, and asks if she is cooking a meal for someone that night. When the person responds affirmatively, Stone offers his services to help cook dinner. They drive to the participant's house, cook the meal, and then surprise the participant's partner or guest upon his or her arrival.\n\n[quote]nd one of those Bachelorette type of shows except where the girl's two extremely bitchy friends helped pick the winner/guy she'd marry -- who wisely said, after a whole season, that maybe they would get married but not then and not on the air. Her blonde friend was the single biggest cunt on TV except for maybe Rachel Zoe's horrible assistant and Omorosa.\n\nI remember that show; the girl looked like Courtney Cox and she was from Michigan. Her father was some life long military guy and a real asshole. I think it was a set up and the guy she chose to marry was her real life boyfriend pretending to be a stranger.\n\n[quote]What about the show (can't remember the name) where they were trying to cast the leads in a \"Grease\" revival on Broadway? I know Laura Osnes was one of the winners. And there was another one about finding a lead for \"Legally Blonde.\" One or both of these featured DL fave Seth Rudetsky.\n\nThe Grease version was called \"You're the One that I Want.\"\n\nIt was based on a British series called \"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?\" Hosted by Graham Norton, with Andrew Lloyd Weber and John Barrowman as two of the judges. That was followed by \"Any Dream Will Do,\" which was in turned followed by \"I'd Do Anything\" (which added Barry Humphries and Cameron MacIntosh), followed by \"Over the Rainbow,\" followed by \"Superstar.\" The latter had Amanda Holden as the host and Dawn French joining Weber as a judge.\n\nAt least a few of them aired on BBC America.\n\nThe Legally Blonde thing was an MTV Show with the unwieldily title \"Legally Blonde - the Musical: The Search for Elle Woods.\"\n\nBlind Date, and The Fifth Wheel make me think of Elimidate, which was so bad and good.\n\nThe guy would have meathead-voice or douche-voice, and be all \"I really want to bang all of 'em but the rules say I have to pick one, so let's see who can handle me\"\n\nAnd one of the girls would be all\" \"Woo, I'm in it to win it bitches!\", and then later she'd get cut, and she'd be all \"WhatEVER. You two deserve each other! Y'all just jealous! WhatEVER.\"\n\nNASHVILLE STAR - Another Failed show with Jewel as a judge (god could ANYONE be more humorless and boring)...\n\nFun Fact - The Swan's plastic surgeon was Dr. Terry Dubrow - husband to Heather Dubrow...you know famous TV actress Heather Dubrow.\n\nThere was that Kelly Ripa produced show about Soap Star's IRL - I forget what it was called but Kristen Storms was on it and she was a mess. Brandon Beemer too...being totally het.\n\nThere was the MTV show THE CUT hosted by Lisa Left Eye Lopez - which gave us international superstar Anastasia.\n\nThere was I want to work for Diddy -that gave us Laverne Cox\n\nWasn't there that Shania Twain one. Was it called Why Not? And wasn't it on Oprah's OWN network?\n\nOWN has cranked out a lot of reality shows in its relatively brief existence. Most of them bland and forgettable. If there were any interesting ones I'll leave it to the rest of you to remember them or go through the Wikipedia of them.\n\nI do remember one with those old ladies who first got famous making fun of the Kardashian sex tape. Golden Sisters or something.\n\nGod, I remember about 95% of these. Good times! I think R63 and R80 are thinking of the same show, which I watched too. It only lasted one season - I knew the prize was too much $$ for the show to last long. I also watched Endurance R56. I remember one contestant was a really nelly tween boy, who was flaming from space. It was nice that all the other kids treated him as \"normal\".\n\nAnother show that didn't last long, and was on only about 2-3 years ago. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson (I think it was him) hosted a show where contestants did crazy things like hang out of 90 story window, or swim with sharks, all in the name to showing you were TOUGH! I remember all the contestants being insufferable - some muscle head fame whores too busy \"performing\" for the camera.\n\nSomebody help me.... I remember some make-up challenge show.\n\nThe contestants were about 40% arty women, 55% SUPER-femmey gay guys, and there was one middle-aged straight guy-he did much more subdued, somewhat 1970's inspired, realistic looks, but nobody liked him because he was 'boring'. The women, and especially the gay guys all did super dramatic, over-the-top ridiculous artsy makeup, that no one would ever actually wear in real life. All the gay guys were femme and ridiculous but there was one that was above and beyond. I think his name was 'Maxi'. I could be wrong but that's what I remember. He was constantly carrying a fancy lace parasol with him wherever he went, like indoors and shit, and always wanted to add 'more drama' to his work.\n\nHow could anyone NOT remember Lindsay. It was a train wreck of epic proportions. Very sad that Lindsay didn't get it, even after she saw it. And she was an executive producer. She had one very bizarre long shot of her crying, crying, crying. That's it. We saw she was a party girl but also completely unprofessional, blowing off assignments right and left. The photo shoot for an Asian fashion magazine would put anyone off working with her. The editor, who called her a bitch under her breath, later said she had no advice for Lindsay because she wasn't close to her but said that advice she would give her own daughter is that even if she made choices that she didn't like, just never waste your life. Oprah sent a life coach to her and even she gave up on her.\n\nI felt bad because it was obvious Lindsay is a lost cause but Oprah was an enabler by giving her over one million dollars for it and then telecasting it.\n\nRock of Love descended from Flavor of Love, and Flavor of Love only happened because of the weird Flava Flav renaissance that was happening at that time. And that revival was happening because of his appearance on The Surreal Life where he was in a romance...or friendship...or whatever the fuck that was with Brigitte Nielsen. I think there was even a show in between The Surreal Life and Flavor of Love where he ran off to Italy to find her but she was there with some Italian boytoy, and they all sort of hung out awkwardly together.\n\nI don't think The Surreal Life is as forgotten as most in this thread, if you mention it to anyone age 25+ they'd remember it, but it has sort fallen to the backburner of our pop culture memories compared to the dumb splash it made at the time. One season had Ron Jeremy, and Tammy Faye, and for some reason I remember the guy from Smashmouth(hey now you're a rockstar get your game on get paid). And the classic season had Omarosa fighting with Janice Dickinson who screamed 'My father was a pedophile!' while she ran out of the house, while Bronson Pinchot (Balki) cried.\n\nUltimately, what I'm saying is that Brett Michaels got chlamydia from some psycho-bitch, because Omarosa pulled a knife on Janice Dickinson. It is the circle of Life.\n\nI suppose Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew isn't as forgotten as most upthread, but I detect it's starting to fade from our memories. It shouldn't though. Tonnes of great moments. Like half the people who went on it are dead now. As any good Datalounger will tell you, Bai Ling is, and shall forever be, on the roof.\n\nIt also spun off the somewhat more forgotten Sober House, which was even more of a shitshow. Mary Carey. Andy Dick. Dennis Rodman. Porn actress Penny Flame. The old drummer from Gun N Roses having a dope freakout on camera.\n\nSpeaking of Janice Dickinson, she was also on Celebrity Rehab!\n\nAll I remember of I'm a celebrity get me out of here was Janice Dickinson having a nervous breakdown clinging to Sanjaya, telling him he was a good boy for comforting her.\n\nI had to google this to get the actual name: The Real Gilligan's Island. From wikipedia:\n\n[quote]Contestants on the show were required to participate in challenges based on plots from the 1960s television show.\n\nShit actually ran two seasons! I only remember it because they gave away a DVD of the premiere episode with either TV Guide or Entertainment Weekly and I had it floating around near my TV set for years.\n\nI can't believe we've gotten to nearly 300 posts, and no one has mentioned Bridalplasty, one of the sleaziest, most exploitative, and absolutely engrossing and brilliant TV shows of all time.\n\nI also firmly believe that Janessa was the most evil reality show villain of all time.\n\nIt was on Netflix for a while, but I recently bought the complete season (one paltry season) on iTunes.\n\nR276, I thought they only opened one location in Hollywood and Vine and it quickly closed down. It was a horrible show because the judges already had in mind what kind of restaurant they wanted and kept changing the contestants' concepts. All the final restaurants were nothing like their original concepts. One girl who only wanted to serve healthy food had hers turn into something completely different and then they eliminated her.\n\n[quote]Remember when Fox ran Paradise Island and the whole point was trying to get self-centered loser couples to cheat on each other on TV?\n\nCertainly do. The second season featured so much naked aggression among the contestants I nearly had a panic attack watching one episode.\n\nYes, I am a Mary.\n\n[quote]What was the great one with Vitamin C where they had awful singers vying to be an \"Idol\" but somehow made them think they could sing.\n\nThat would be WB Superstar USA (mentioned at R7 and R8)... fucking hilarious. I always felt guilty for watching, but still laughed until tears were running down my face.\n\nWB Superstar USA - Rosa - \"Wind Beneath My Wings\"\n\nFood Network keeps throwing out random concepts for new shows, hoping something will stick. They do these shows as 6 episode runs, then most disappear.\n\nBobby Flay is the king of that channel - his ego is unstoppable! I remember two short-lived series he tried, giving advice to people who ran food-based businesses. I remember him helping a woman who had a food truck and then he visited a restaurant in NYC run by a black female, and gave her advice on how to improve it. **Found it on IMDB: Three Days to Open\n\nThen there was another show where ordinary people opened their home kitchens and made a meal that was judged by Flay and at least one other person. **Found on IMDB: Bobby's Dinner Battle\n\n\"There Goes the Neighborhood\" was a weird one. Families lived in a walled off neighborhood cut off from the outside world. They had to compete against other families for things like food and electricity.\n\nIt was hard to watch. Families had to backstab to win and there was a lot of resentment and paranoia. Little kids were caught in the middle. The show didn't last long.\n\nRoom Raiders is a \"dating/reality\" series on MTV\n\nOn the show, three men or women have their rooms inspected, or \"raided\" by another single man or woman. The raider does not meet or see any of the three singles (any personal photographs of the contestant are removed from the room or covered with a smiley face sticker). At the end of the episode, the raider chooses to go on a date with one of them based on the contents of their rooms. The three contestants watch and comment, while sitting in a van, as their rooms are inspected. After the raider has finished with each of the rooms, the three contestants then raid the raider's room. Finally, the raider confronts the three contestants and makes his or her choice\n\nHigh School Reunion is a reality television series chronicling real-life high school reunions.\n\nThe program originally aired on The WB for two seasons between 2003 and 2005, and featured reunions of classes after ten years.\n\nA new version of the series began airing on TV Land on March 5, 2008, focusing on the 20-year reunion of the 1987 graduating class of J.J. Pearce High School in Richardson, Texas. Filmed in Maui, the series featured documentary-style interviews with the classmates, who are assigned \"labels\" to describe their high school roles.[1]\n\nThe series returned to TV Land in February 2009 with members of the Class of 1988 of Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona reuniting and the promise that one of them would reveal a major secret. Once again class members had labels such as \"The Class Clown\", \"The Cowboy\", etc.\n\nThe series returned with its third season premiering on January 13, 2010. It follows the members of the Class of 1989 of Chaparral High School in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n-PopStar (launching pad for Garrett Hedlund and Nicole Scherzinger) -Search for the New Partridge Family (with Emma Stone as a contestant) -Daisy of Love -That's Amore -For the Love of Ray J -Real Chance of Love -Showbiz Dogs (with the Polish lady screaming HE BIT ME UN THA WAGINA!) -Next -Star Dates -The Mole -Search for the Next Pussycat Doll and the second season Girlicious -Glam God -Hell Date -Elimidate -Date My Mom -College Hill\n\nThe only one thats got me stumped was the one dating show where the guys were covered by masks, Monica Lewinsky hosted the first season and Kathy Griffin hosted the second\n\nA little trivia: Emma Stone won the part of Laurie on \"Search for the New Partridge Family\" as Emily Stone. #3 was Alanna Allen who played the bitch in \"Camp\". The runner up for Keith was Stone's roommate David Petruzzi. David was boyfriends with Max Crumm who would later go on to win the part of Danny in \"You're the One that I want\". Teddy Geiger was also one of the Keith finalists at age 16.\n\nTiny People, Even Tinier Cakes--With 19 Kids and Counting!\n\nI'm pretty sure this was on TLC for 10 seasons.\n\nBut seriously, I really liked the Martha Stewart version of the Apprentice. I could never stomach Trump's version. I wish they would bring it back. But unfortunately the new version will be with Schwarzenegger--whom I loathe.\n\nI really enjoyed the first season of The Apprentice, where the focus was on the contestants and their tasks, and the contestants were looking for solutions and how to execute the best.\n\nThings started to change pretty quickly, when more and more attention was on Trump's boardroom antics - I can remember in Season 2 there were 90 minute episodes advertised with \"more boardroom!\" And the shitty contestants were all about throwing each other under the bus, instead of succeeding as part of their team.\n\nParadise Hotel and Paradise Island are not the same show. Paradise Hotel (season 1) is absurdist genius, and was not on an island. I was bed-ridden that summer, and it completely sucked me in.Somehow, I was on Dave's email newsletter for the year or two he published, and he went into local politics. I did not see Paradise Island.\n\n[quote] that reminds me of a best selling book I read sometime in the 1970,s titled, \"What Really Happened to the Class of '65..\" I think they even made a mini-series back then about it.\n\nHey I read that book when I was 12 years old, back in the 70's. I had no idea the book was a best seller- I just found it on the shelf at the library. Pretty good book. I do think they made a miniseries or movie about it.\n\nMake Me a Supermodel is an American reality television modeling competition series based on the British reality series of the same name. Following an audition preview on January 2, 2008, the series premiered January 10, 2008 on the cable television network Bravo.\n\nFor Season 1, the bottom three contestants were selected at the end of each episode and viewers of the show determine which of the three contestants will not continue in the competition with the judges picking the winner of the episode; for the final episode, the viewers determined the winner. For Season 2, viewer participation was removed, and all model eliminations and winners were selected by the judges.\n\nThe first season was hosted by supermodels Tyson Beckford and Niki Taylor, and judged by fashion casting director Jennifer Starr and model agent Cory Bautista. The second season premiered on March 4, 2009, with Beckford returning as the sole host. Nicole Trunfio replaced Taylor and act as a mentor to the female contestants, while the judging panel will be completely revamped. The show features top photographers such as Roxanne Lowit, Markus Klinko & Indrani, Howard Schatz, and Suza Scalora.\n\nWork of Art: The Next Great Artist is an American reality competition show that airs on the cable television network Bravo, in which up-and-coming artists compete for a solo exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum and a cash prize of $100,000. The show is produced by Pretty Matches Productions and Magical Elves Productions, the same company that created Project Runway and Top Chef. The series premiered on June 9, 2010. Work of Art was renewed for a second season in September 2010 which began on October 12, 2011.\n\nThe advent of social media (particularly Twitter) has altered our social and political landscape over a very short span of time. I just don't think anyone would be brave enough to put that kind of show on the air today for fear of backlash. I think it's a fun concept, but I think many others probably wouldn't and now they have a really good way to make their feelings known (which can spread like wildfire).\n\nOh God I loved Trading Spouses. Some of them were quite touching. I loved the one where the farm lady went to Manhattan. She had to do what the original wife did for a couple days. They had her go do the workout the wife did at a fancy gym. The personal trainer told her it would be hard. She changed into shorts and a t shirt. Now this was a woman who lifted hay, chopped wood, carried feed, fixed tractors....etc etc ....she did the workout without breaking a sweat showing off her beautiful working muscles.\n\nI loved Extreme Makeover. Not the home edition the one where the reworked someone. I also lived for Nanny fucking 911. I would have nannied some of those kids right in their goddamn faces. I loved how so many of the dads seemed to be falling for the fat, frumpy, yet caring nannies by the end of the show.\n\nTrump produced a Bachelorette type show to find a man for OMAROSA. I think they did two seasons. One of the contestants was Al B Sure! who many suspect is gay.\n\nNeedless to say, the show did not bring everlasting love to OMAROSA. However, it was nice to see a dating show featuring all AAs.\n\nWE TV had a show in the middle 2000's that featured a couple (Bryan and Jennifer Masche) that had sextuplets. The wife was a horse-face blond nurse who almost died during childbirth and the husband was a bully who didn't seem to have a job. They moved across country to a bigger home to raise their kids in. They bickered all the time, mostly because the husband was a controlling babyman who browbeat the wife with scripture quotes.\n\nAfter the show disappeared, I read that they got a divorce. Jennifer remarried and Bryan began a campaign of harassment (out of jealousy?) because he didn't like the way the couple treated his kids. I used to read the comments about this show on TWOP and they were brutal. Everyone could see that this marriage was going into the shitter.\n\nSpeaking of E! they had that awful reality show with Clint Eastwood's then wife (they're divorced now) and some South African singing group she was managing. Tyler Shields was on it because he was dating one of Eastwood's daughters at the time. The only notable storyline, at least for me, was that two of the guys in the group were gay and hooking up and came out on the show. Needless to say, they were treated pretty poorly by their straight shitty group members after that. Passive aggressively so.\n\nR394 Speaking on Ashley Parker Angel:\n\nThere & Back: Ashley Parker Angel is a MTV reality television series than ran for 10 weeks in early 2006. It chronicled the efforts of former O-Town member Ashley Parker Angel to launch a solo career while providing for his new family. In the show, Ashley must manage to balance his career while also having to provide for his fiancée, Tiffany Lynn, and his new son, Lyric (whose birth was the very first shown on MTV). The show debuted on January 9, 2006 and ended with the season/series finale on March 13, 2006.\n\nLong Island Princesess - OMG that was my favorite...that tiny little jewish cunt who's daddy had some sort of weird sex/love thing with her.\n\n\"I don't like putting out mixed cheeses...I feel that is something poor people do..\"\n\nand when they confronted her about being a cunt she walked out of a corn field calling her daddy telling him she was attacked and could he send a jet to come get her? OMG the best...\n\nthen she had some sort of stroke IRL...and I felt bad for a second...but then I thought...strokes are for poor people..\n\nWhen Liza Minnelli was married to David Gest they were supposed to have starred in a reality show together. Now THAT would have been something. I think a couple of episodes were filmed but I don't remember any of them actually airing. What happened with that? I vaguely remember hearing that it was Gest's fault the series never materialized, something about him being a horror to deal with.\n\n\"Age Of Love\", where a bunch of 40-something \"cougars\" think the show is about them being courted by hot guys half their age--until the producers change things up and fly in a group of 20-something \"kittens\" as competition;\n\n\"The Starlet\", a sort-of \"American Idol\" for aspiring young actresses, with none other than DL-fave Faye Dunaway (poor thing) in the Simon Cowell role. I'll never forget Faye shitting on some poor girl's dream: \"Young lady....you. Don't. Have. It.\"\n\nIt's a Brad, Brad World is an American reality documentary television series on Bravo. The series debuted on January 12, 2012. On August 29, 2012, Bravo announced that the series has been renewed for a second season which debuted on March 6, 2013 The series follows Brad Goreski as he breaks away from his career as the assistant of Rachel Zoe and establishes his solo career. Goreski is shown working with celebrity clients along with attempting to share his talents to other designers.\n\nWasn't there some show about the lesbian scene in...I think Los Angeles...something with sugar...Gimme Sugar?\n\nThere were several spinoffs of that tattoo parlor show Miami Ink/LA Ink/ NY Ink. All they did was do tattoos for various randoms(who usually had a personal background story about overcoming adversity), and then fight with each other.\n\nAnd everyone remembers The Anna Nicole Smith show? Remember her lesbian assistant with low self-esteem? Was it Kimmy? And didn't her show feature fabulous gaysian Bobby Trendy at one point? Did he in turn get his own reality show?\n\nAnna Anna Anna Anna Anna Nicole-you're so bodacious!\n\nDon't most of them get forgotten after a few years because they're just trash? In years to come people will probably remember the ones that started it all like Big Brother and maybe even I'm a Celebrity - Get Me Out of Here, but who's really going to remember Growing Up Gotti, Jersey Shore/Geordie Shore, Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo, The Simple Life etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe thing is the \"reality\" label is put on everything now, including stuff like American Chopper and The Biggest Loser.\n\nThis thread has gotten so big that people aren't reading it, they're just posting the titles of shows that have already been posted.\n\nSo I'll add the tattoo show that was about covering an embarrassing tatt with something a little less embarrassing. The entire show was about \"artists\" changing \"Winona Forever\" to \"Wino Forever\" for sad sacks and it was quite a stupid show.\n\nI'm fairly sure no mention has yet been made of \"You Are What You Eat\" where a bitchy brit lady laid out every disgusting thing people have consumed in a week. Seven day's worth of revolting burgers, fries, doner kebabs, breads and pastries, sodas, beers, candy, etc. would be piled onto a long table in an effort to horrify people into changing their bad habits. Gillian would also examine and critique their poops.\n\nThere was an endurance show on about 3-5 years ago. Teams were dropped off in remote areas and had to get to different points before other teams. Once the reached a stop point, a helicopter would drop supplies that they could use on the next leg. They could not take ALL of the supplies, only like 7 of the ones deemed most essential. Every episode the new set of teams were dropped in a different environment (I think). What was that show?\n\nThis was NOT any of the Bear Grylls shows or the one shown on A&E with the teams comprised of experienced hikers, military men, and tour guides.\n\n[quote]I miss the plastic surgery show with dr Rey and his lollipop headed wife Halley. I got strangely attached and then it was gone.\n\nI liked Dr. 90120 too. Now they have a show on Netflix called The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills. I couldn't get past the first episode...way too obviously scripted.\n\nMark DeCarlo was so good on \"Studs.\" And that reminds me of my mother, who would change the channel when anything gay related came on, even though she claimed not to be a homophobe. Anyway, when she was very ill and near death Mark DeCarlo played the LAGMC \"It Gets Better\" video on a local Chicago show and it was the ONLY time she ever watched anything gay voluntarily and I think she liked the fact the gays were doing something about the suicide spike at that time with the Trevor project. Anyway, DeCarlo said he was in the video for his gay brother (never mind that he seems like he belonged....). Anyway, it comes back to me now because this recent wedding proposal video has a \"Jeff\" who is a dead ringer for a DeCarlo.\n\nI hope that I am not repeating, but 460+ replies is a lot to get through this time of night. Two obscure favorites that I loved: 1) \"Debbie Does Dallas... Again\" - excellent behind the scenes of the Vivid remake of the cult classic from the late 70's. This was 2007 and porn chic seemed to be back. Everyone was fascinated with the starlets and the performers were living the dream and making serious bank. Soon after - torrents, piracy, file sharing and HIV outbreaks would rock the industry in a very bad way...... 2) \"Love is in the Heir\" - the year was 2005 and the premise was just to ridiculous to not be a guilty pleasure \"Alleged Iranian Princess comes to America to make her mark in country music\". I couldn't stop watching. This fame whore had already been in bad reality segments about being a spoiled uber rich brat in very bad E segments.\n\nAnother fan of the first season of [italic]Top Chef: Just Desserts.[/italic] Such a perfect storm of maladjusted and insane -- in addition to crazy Seth and creepy Morgan, there was cunty, bitter Heather H.\n\nSeth had not one but two spectacular meltdowns. Remember when he had to be taken out on a stretcher? LOL\n\nWhat made Morgan's arrest all the more shocking was that he was raising a young son as a single dad. Oddly, there doesn't seem to have been any movement on his case since 2011.\n\nSeth says he begged production to let him leave before he had his final meltdown but was pressured into staying; then, after he was removed from the show, he says was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold. He's in the process of changing his identity so he can make a fresh start after being blacklisted from the restaurant business.\n\nHave vague flashbacks of a show, not that old maybe late 2000's, that was about wealthy Manhattan wastes-of-space couples who were pregnant for the first time, who hired people to help come up with a name for their baby. 99% of what actually occurred in the show, was, on its own, paint-drying level boring....but taken as a whole it was sort of a cultural insight into how self-absorbed and horrible this ridiculous social milieu was\n\nSorry to bump an old thread...\n\nSomeone upthread mentioned TEMPTATION ISLAND. Remember when one of the contestants was a hot Italian-American named Tony? He did a jack-off video and another where a gay guy sucked him off. He later claimed that for the latter he had been drugged. He ended up losing his regular job as an elementary school gym teacher.\n\nI too loved PBS's MANOR HOUSE, FRONTIER HOUSE, and COLONIAL HOUSE. I recall that one of the teenage girls of one of the families on FRONTIER HOUSE departed early because her boyfriend back home was killed in a car crash while they were filming the show. I enjoyed Oprah and Gayle's visit on COLONIAL HOUSE, but admittedly their presence shattered whatever reality they were aiming for because Oprah absolutely refused to be treated as a black person would in those days and the contestants were in awe of her celebrity.\n\nThe first season (2000) of Big Brother followed the international format, with viewers voting out the houseguests. It started out strong but took a ratings nosedive because America voted out all of the interesting/shit-stirring houseguests early on. On the other hand, it's notable for having the most successful houseguest of any BB franchise: cosmetics queen Jamie Kern Lima, who sold her company to L'Oréal for more than a billion dollars a few years ago.\n\nIt was very corny and early 2000s, with Dr. Drew and some lady from AOL offering weekly commentary on the houseguests. One of them, a middle-aged frau named—wait for it—Karen, confessed in the house that she didn't love her husband anymore and wanted a divorce."
