        "text": "Game play\n\nAs noted above, Fun House was played with two teams, each comprising a boy and a girl. One of the teams wore red uniforms and the other gold. In the third and final season, a kid was paired with a child or young teen celebrity from a popular TV series. One of the young teen celebrity contestants was actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who at the time was a cast member on the series Parenthood.\n\nStunt rounds\n\nThree stunts/games were played on each episode. One involved the boys, one involved the girls, and the third involved all four players. Several games, such as \"Pinhead\" and \"Dump-O\", were races to answer a certain number of questions first, with the losing player being covered with disgusting materials (slime, garbage, etc.) by an unusual contraption. The team who won each stunt earned 25 points. If the stunt ended in a tie, both teams received the points. After each stunt, play moved to a podium at center stage where a toss-up question relating to the stunt was asked for 25 points.\n\nGrand Prix race\n\nThe Grand Prix race was played as the fourth and final round and involved both teams racing two laps around a track that circled the studio, trading lanes after the first lap.\n\nTwo different formats were used for the race. In one format, the teams used vehicles to run the course, with one teammate pushing/pulling and the other riding, and they traded roles in addition to lanes for the second lap. The other format was a relay race on foot, with each teammate running one lap. Small challenges were usually set up around the track that each team had to complete during the run, such as gathering and carrying items, running through tires, or squirting targets with a seltzer bottle. Roth signaled the start and finish of the race with the green and checkered flags used in motor racing.\n\nTeams had several opportunities to collect tokens for extra points along the course. White tokens were worth 10 points each, and blue ones awarded 25. In the second season, a \"Token Bank\" was placed alongside each lane; during the second lap, one member of each team could reach inside their lane's bank and pull out one handful of tokens. In order to count toward a team's score, tokens had to be either within the vehicle or placed in a bag given to the team before the start of the race. Any tokens dropped on the floor were out of play and could not be picked up.\n\nThe winners of the race scored 25 bonus points, after which Roth counted up the points from each team's tokens, starting with the trailing team. The team with the higher final score won the game and advanced to the Fun House, while the losing team received parting gifts. If the final scores were tied, Roth asked a toss-up question to decide the winner.\n\nThe Fun House\n\nThe Fun House was a structure containing a variety of rooms and obstacles as well as several large tags. Six tags were red, each marked with a different prize; the others were green and awarded cash amounts from $50 to $250. All cash tags were placed in plain sight, but the prize tags were sometimes hidden within the rooms. Every room that held a prize tag, hidden or visible, was marked with a placard indicating the prize.\n\nThe team had two minutes to enter the Fun House and collect as many tags as possible. Only one teammate could be inside at a time, and he/she could take no more than three tags before having to exit so the other could enter. Both members received all prizes and cash picked up by either of them, including any carried by a player who was still inside the Fun House when time ran out. One tag was secretly designated as the \"Power Prize\" and awarded a bonus vacation to both teammates if either of them found it.\n\nWhen Fun House moved to Fox for season three, a large alarm clock called the Glop Clock was hidden in the Fun House. If found, it awarded the team an extra 15 seconds once the clock ran out.\n\nPrize totals on Fun House were usually much higher than were available on other children's game shows of the time such as Nickelodeon's Double Dare or Finders Keepers. A team on either of those two shows could usually walk away with approximately $2,000-$3,000 in cash and prizes, while a team on Fun House could often win cash and prizes that often topped $5,000. It should also be noted that while the main game of Fun House was played for points, both of the Nickelodeon shows mentioned saw their main games played for money.\n\nRooms\n\nFirst season\n\nBalloon Lagoon (a small pool filled with water and balloons; tag is hanging above pool; players could enter the Fun House through the Lagoon from a set of stairs leading into it, but could only exit it through ladders at either side)\n\nFundromat (a giant revolving tunnel filled with clothes)\n\nTiny's Room (two closets, one of which had Tiny in it with a seltzer bottle and the tag)\n\nThe Shower Room (a series of connected shower stalls with seven doors, only one of which was unlocked)\n\nThe Dump (Ballroom covered with trash cans and trash bags; tag is hidden in one of the cans)\n\nThe Swamp (Small lake with the tag in the mouth of an artificial alligator)\n\nSmall Tall Hall (5 doors, with the doors going from small to largest)\n\nIcecave/Batcave (cave \"inside\" Mt.

The show aired in weekly syndication, mostly on weekends.\n\nIn place of cheerleaders, Kinnear was assisted by two referees, Richard McGregor and Donna Wilson. Voiceover artist Beau Weaver replaced Hurley as announcer.\n\nAs before, two teams competed. This time, there were four members of the team instead of two. Like on Fun House, there was an equal distribution of males and females.\n\nThis version featured much more risqué content and stunts than the children's version, often involving crude college gross-out humor and games that required lewd bodily movements among the participants.\n\nStunts were reworked to accommodate the larger teams. The first stunt featured the men, the second featured the women, and the third featured all eight players. Scoring remained the same.\n\nThe fourth round was the \"College Mad House Finals\", a ninety-second speed round of general knowledge questions. The two teams would stand in line behind the podium and each member of the team had a pie. Buzzing in with a correct answer won the team 25 points and the player got to hit the opponent with his/her pie. After two players played, they moved to the end of the line and the next two moved up to face each other. Play continued in this manner until time ran out, and the team in the lead won the game. If the teams were tied, one more question was played with the next two players in line. The tiebreaker was an all-or-nothing question, as buzzing in with a wrong answer resulted in an automatic loss. This game mechanic, minus the pies, was later used on the Stone-Stanley game show Shop 'Til You Drop, which premiered a year after College Mad House went off the air.\n\nThe winning team then got to run through the Mad House, which was laid out in the same manner as the Fun House except with rooms that were more centered on college life than children. One at a time, the winning team would run through the Mad House trying to collect as many of the prize tags and cash tags as possible. A player was not limited as to how many tags he/she could grab, but after thirty seconds elapsed that player had to freeze wherever he/she was and the next player in line was sent into the Mad House. Play continued until all four team members had taken their turn or until all of the tags had been found. There was no Power Prize in the Mad House; instead, the bonus vacation was awarded if the team managed to \"clean house\" by getting all of the tags before the last teammate into the Mad House ran out of time.\n\nBoard game\n\nFun House was a board game that is based on the American children's game show of the same name. This board game utilized dice, markers, and a board game that plays like a real fun house. It was loosely based on the game show and was released in 1988. The layout of the board was surprisingly similar to The Game of Life.\n\nTravel game\n\nTiger Electronics (1989)\n\nA Klix Pocket Travel Game was released in 1989.\n\nVideo and computer games\n\nHi Tech Expressions (1989, 1991)\n\nGames released from the Commodore 64 & MS-DOS were released in 1989 while a version for the NES was released in 1991.\n\nExercise videos\n\nWarner Home Video (1990)\n\nIn 1990, two exercise videos were released under the Fun House Fitness collection hosted by Jane Fonda and J.D. Roth respectively. the first one was called The Swamp Stomp for kids ages 3–7 while its second and finale line of exercise videos was called The Fun House Funk for kids ages 7 and up. it was re-issued as part of Jane Fonda Collection DVD compilation in 2005.\n\nPilot\n\nThe format was basically the same as the show that eventually made it to air, but with some differences:\n\nThe announcer was Brian Cummings. Unlike Tiny and MC Mike, he did not appear on camera.\n\nTeams played for money rather than points. Each stunt earned $25 to the winners, with $1 per item for the runners-up (similar to how the \"Key Game\" worked in the British version).\n\nInstead of three stunts, there were four (two stunts for the boys, two stunts for the girls).\n\nThe Grand Prix race also had red tokens in addition to white and blue. Red ones were worth $10, white, $25, and blue, $50. Winning the race also earned $50.\n\nIn the Fun House, both teammates could grab two tags at once, and that was it. There was also a room that contained seven amounts-- $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $1,000, and $2,000, the amount of which could be won by stopping a light at random. There were only seven tags in the house, and the Power Prize tag earned the team all the prizes, totaling over $25,000. The team still had two minutes to grab tags.\n\nThe scoreboards used the classic eggcrate font, instead of the new eggcrate font which was used on the series.\n\nBritish version"
