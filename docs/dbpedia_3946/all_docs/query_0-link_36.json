        "text": "Fifty years ago, Tulsa newspapers didn’t mention the uprising at the Stonewall Inn in New York City.\n\nIt’s impossible to know the thinking of editors at the time. But, it’s likely the incident was viewed as a far-away big city thing of rabble hanging out at a gay bar.\n\nToday, Stonewall represents the spark of the modern LGBTQ civil rights movement. It is the reason for Pride month in June with commemorations of the 50-year-old event concluding this weekend.\n\nIt started with a June 28, 1969, police raid on a gay bar in Greenwich Village and grew into two days of protests and violence. Afterward, advocacy groups formed and grew through the U.S.\n\nTulsa may not have registered Stonewall then, but its impact made its way here.\n\nEfforts among LGBTQ people to organize began in Oklahoma before Stonewall but ramped up in the ’70s. News stories did not include names, citing requests for anonymity.\n\nToby Jenkins, executive director of Oklahomans for Equality, said that’s not unusual.\n\n“For the first few years of our organization, our historical minutes did not have names in the event our records were seized,” he said. “We were considered criminals in Oklahoma until 2003.”\n\nThe first name attached to any news story as an advocate was John M. Faires, who was chairman of the Gay Community Caucus, a group he formed with three others. He is a Tulsa native and came out during his 20s.\n\nAt age 74, Faires said he vaguely recalls hearing about Stonewall on the network nightly news.\n\n“It was about the local things, and we needed to make things better here for us,” Faires said. “I was just terribly naïve and thought someone needs to do or say something. I thought if someone started it, others would follow. That didn’t happen.\n\n“I was the one crazy enough to do it and didn’t think about the repercussions.”\n\nTulsa had several gay clubs serving as the hub for socializing. Most LGBTQ people were fearful to live openly, so these were safe places.\n\nFaires said police officers would come into the clubs to harass patrons or find reasons to stop and arrest them while leaving, including jaywalking.\n\nIn April 1976, Faires made a complaint to the Tulsa Community Relations Committee about discrimination. The committee agreed to investigate.\n\n“We want no preferential treatment over heterosexuals, only equality,” Faires told the committee. “By what right does the government have to say who I can or cannot love or who I can have sex with? As far as I’m concerned, only one person can tell me that. That’s God almighty. And I have a pretty good relationship with him.”\n\nA Tulsa Tribune editorial, “Militant homosexuals,” on April 21, 1976, criticized the city committee’s decision. The piece stated LGBTQ people made bad employees, shouldn’t be around children and insulted them as “swisheroos.”\n\nMany letters to the editor followed: “Predictably, you have completely missed the point,” “…you carried things too far” and “Your editorial just forced me to become involved.” Only Faires put his full name to a letter, others used unidentifiable initials.\n\nIn June 1976, the committee sent out surveys to gain opinions about homosexuality. Results showed a majority of businesses did not want to hire or promote LGBTQ people but would not discourage them as customers.\n\n“If you are a homosexual in Tulsa, you can expect generally fair treatment from hotels, motels and restaurants. You might have a little trouble getting housing, but the source of the greatest discrimination will be employment,” the Tulsa World’s Janet Pearson’s reported.\n\nIn February 1978, Oklahoman Anita Bryant went to the Capitol to speak to lawmakers about her anti-gay message. Faires led a protest outside.\n\n“We’re not going to lie down and be a doormat for anybody. We are here as Americans,” Faires said to the crowd.\n\nFaires lost his job at a utilities company. He was self-employed before entering the health care field for most of his career.\n\n“It started off with police harassment in clubs, then we got into housing, employment and those sorts of thing,” Faires said. “AIDS came along, and everything halted. People went so far back in the closet we had to take sunlight to them in buckets.”\n\nEventually, the other group members moved so it disbanded, and he stepped away from activism.\n\n“I did my thing, and it was someone else’s turn,” Faires said. “If I had something to do with what is now going on, I’m very happy for that.”\n\nIn Oklahoma City, the Oklahomans for Human Rights advocacy group formed. Tulsa’s chapter started in 1980 and took over planning Pride events in June 1982.\n\nThere was no public listing of events for the nine-day series of events. There was no proclamation and no parade.\n\nSimilar discreet events were planned the following years.\n\nPride stayed low-key, but the group developed a speakers bureau and sponsored a nationally affiliated LGBTQ softball tournament.\n\nNative Tulsan Tom Neal went away for college and work during the ’70s and ’80s and worked in activist groups such as GLADD.\n\n“A lot of it was like planting seeds, preparing the earth. Then AIDS came along and devastated the community, shortchanged focus and scared the powers that be,” Neal said. “In the ’90s, we still didn’t feel like we had been making progress, but all the work done then and now has been good.\n\n“It’s been an accumulation of a lot of gradual little steps and building relationships. I’m an in-your-face, confrontational activist. There are times and places that is needed. Then, other people are consensus builders who did a lot of ground work. It’s like good cop-bad cop.”\n\nBy the early ’90s, Neal returned to Tulsa and started moving Pride events into the light. In 1993, it was held in Owen Park and Mayor Susan Savage issued a proclamation of support.\n\nPride events moved to Veterans Park, and occasional parades would be held in areas along the Brookside and Cherry Street neighborhoods. Funding for permits to close streets and obtain security was an obstacle.\n\nIn 1996, Tulsa opened the state’s first LGBTQ community center. In 1998, activism led to the creation of the nonprofit H.O.P.E. (Health Outreach, Prevention and Education) for HIV/AIDS services.\n\nNeal stepped back as an organizer but continues advocacy, particularly in workplace protections. He would like to see recruitment of LGBTQ people in public jobs such as police office and firefighters.\n\n“We can get married, but it’s a mixed bag of current civil rights including sexual orientation and gender discrimination,” Neal said. “That’s still an uphill battle. Some states provide full protection and other states don’t. All of us worry about backsliding. Just because there has been a legal decision, we could get a different makeup on the Supreme Court.”\n\nNeal said the impact of Stonewall cannot be overstated.\n\n“Surprisingly, it did have an impact in tiny states with small populations far, far away from New York. It did have an impact here, but it’s taken 50 years to come this far,” Neal said.\n\nJenkins was named executive director of Tulsa Oklahomans for Equality in 2008, a year after the opening of the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center at 621 E. Fourth St. The group then voted to become Oklahomans for Equality.\n\n“When we purchased our permanent space, we changed our name because we felt like equality more closely reflected and expressed what we were wanting,” Jenkins said.\n\nTulsa now boasts a Pride Street. The Equality Center offers a variety of programs around LGBTQ and immigration rights and has an art gallery, support groups and a black box theater. Same-sex marriage is legal, and businesses recognize the benefit of LGBTQ diversity on staff.\n\n“I’m shocked this happened in my lifetime,” Faires said. “What bothers me now is fear of going back to the old days because of the amount of hate that has come out in the last two years with this administration.\n\n“It scares me people have lost their view of what reconciliation is and how you treat other people. You may not like them and may not agree with them, but they have as many rights as you do.”\n\nFeatured video\n\nTulsa City Councilors offered a forum recently on the Equality Indicators report, which uses 54 equality measures that compare outcomes of groups likely to experience inequalities.\n\nRead the story: 'We have to realize we're one city': Discussion on Equality Indicators offers chance at dialogue\n\nGinnie Graham\n\n918-581-8376\n\nginnie.graham@tulsaworld.com\n\nTwitter: @GinnieGraham\n\nSubscribe to Daily Headlines\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nGinnie Graham\n\nTulsa World Editorials Editor\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
