        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- The 2022 TCS New York City Marathon has been named a Safe Space by the historic Stonewall Inn.\n\nIt's the first sporting event to receive the designation from the bar, the original safe space for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe Spirit of Stonewall celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, and how the bravery to take a stand has evolved into the Pride movement and celebrations of today. Through this commemorative release, Stoli supports the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative and its powerful mission to eliminate the social intolerances that profoundly impact the lives of LGBTQ citizens in America and abroad.\n\nTaylor Swift made a surprise appearance before about 100 people at the Stonewall Inn in New York’s Greenwich Village, the site of the pivotal 1969 riots that launched the gay rights movement.\n\nAfter a rousing pair of songs from Sara Bareilles — including a version of “Brave” that had virtually all of the 100-odd lucky people inside singing along — Swift was greeted by the evening’s headliner, “Modern Family” star Jesse Tyler Ferguson.\n\nTaylor Swift honored Pride month with a special performance.\n\nSwift, 29, made a surprise appearance on Friday night at AEG and Stonewall Inn’s pride celebration commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, taking the stage at the legendary gay bar to perform one of her biggest hits — “Shake it Off.”\n\nSwift was introduced by the event’s headliner Jesse Tyler Ferguson after the Modern Family star teased her appearance with a plethora of Swift references.\n\nAEG, the world’s leading sports and live music company, announced today that it has pledged its support to Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative’s (SIGBI) development of an LGBTQ+ anti-bias training standard in conjunction with anti-bias training experts.\n\nThe standard is designed to ensure that all people are treated equally in public spaces regardless of gender, gender expression or gender identity. This multi-phase initiative will further SIGBI’s aim to make sure that the LGBTQ+ community is welcomed everywhere. Once the standard has been developed, SIGBI’s goal is to have the training standard adopted on a local and national basis.\n\nOn June 14, AEG and SIGBI are partnering with Hawkins Mikita, Spring Place and Tie The Knot to host the first annual SIGBI Summit luncheon at Spring Place in the Soho district of New York City, which will convene prominent New York-based LGBTQ+ organizations. A panel session will include Adam Eli, co-founder of Voices4; Stacy Lentz, president and CEO of SIGBI; Gregory Lewis, Executive Director and CEO, True Colors United; Devin Norelle, a transgender advocate and Assistant Editor at Out magazine; Angelica Torres, a NY-based activist; and Emanuel Xavier, poet and Gay City News Impact Award recipient\n\nIn partnership with the brand’s parent company’s Only The Brave Foundation, DIESEL will make a donation to The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative (SIGBI), a non-profit organization that supports LGBTQ+ social initiatives worldwide, promoting tolerance and equality. DIESEL and OTB Foundation are proud and honored to contribute to the cause of The Stonewall Gives Back Initiative, in remembrance and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\n\nThe New York Yankees revealed the first recipients of the Yankee-Stonewall scholarship on Wednesday at the Stonewall Inn, the historic site where the ongoing fight for LGBTQ+ rights began in 1969.\n\nThe major league baseball team first announced its plan last September, in collaboration with the Stonewall Inn and the New York City Department of Education, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn uprising. In its inaugural year, the Yankees-Stonewall Scholarship Initiative provided $10,000 college scholarships to five high school students from each of the city’s boroughs.\n\nThe violent police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City in 1969 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the gay rights movement. But police officials had long refused to admit that officers’ behavior and the raid itself were not justified, leaving a rift between law enforcement and gay-rights supporters that seemed to deepen distrust over the years.\n\nOn Thursday, as people around the world began commemorating the 50th anniversary of the clash, New York’s police commissioner took a step toward making amends, issuing an unusual official apology on behalf of the Police Department for the actions of officers during the Stonewall uprising.\n\nWe’ll be picking a winner randomly after May 19, 2019. All submissions may be considered for our ROCKETMAN pre-show so make sure it’s awesome. Brooklyn Brewery’s The Stonewall Inn IPA will be available in May at select Alamo locations commemorating and celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. The beer is brewed in support of The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative.\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue is taking a stand on social injustice - and designers are on board.\n\nOn May15, Saks launches a comprehensive campaign to support the LGBTQ community in Honor of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Inn Riots and the 2019 WorldPride Festival.\n\nSaks will sell a capsule collection of unisex fashion items created by 15 designers and brands and will donate 30 percent of the proceeds to the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, also known as SIGBI, with a minimum payment $100,000 donation.\n\n“…There are still places here in the U.S. and around the globe where being LGBTQ can still get you killed and is criminalized. It is incredible that this year we can watch all the world gather to celebrate where Pride began.\"\n\nMadonna rang in 2019 at the historic Stonewall Inn in New York City, kicking off the 50th anniversary of the police raid and riots at the bar that are considered the birth of the gay rights movement. \"I stand here proudly at the place where Pride began, the legendary Stonewall Inn, at the birth of a new year,\"…\n\nFor the second year in a row, JetBlue is a proud sponsor of The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative (SIGBI), which leverages the historic significance of the New York City LGBT landmark to help other communities that don’t have the same LGBT resources or support. JetBlue was an original SIGBI donor when the nonprofit was formed in 2017…."
