        "text": "Scott G. Brown has devoted his life to advocating for the rights of LGBTQ people through writing, speaking, and educating people about HIV prevention. But Brown is not only an activist, he's part of history.\n\nAt 76, Brown is one of the oldest survivors of the 1969 Stonewall raid and riots. Despite uncertainty in the LGBTQ community caused by President Donald Trump, Scott says the country's foundation is one of the most powerful tools we can use, just as those who participated in Stonewall did.\n\n\"Many lives are at risk because of the ... uncertainty of the present administration’s policies,\" Brown said. \"Nevertheless, peaceful protests, public assembly, and free speech are First Amendment rights of the U.S. Constitution and our biggest resource.\"\n\nThe Stonewall riots are often considered the initial spark in the gay rights movement, following a spontaneous raid in June 1969 on New York City’s Stonewall Inn, a mafia-owned gay hangout, infamous at the time for its watered-down drinks, dodgy owners and lack of a liquor license. The riots were the responses to the innermost feelings of the crowd who were fed up with the harassment and assault by the police.\n\nBrown moved to New York in 1961, and said that despite being black in a very turbulent time for people of color, he never encountered any racism in Greenwich Village’s gay community: “We were the flower children, hippies and the peacemakers. Everything was about love and coming together. There was no overt racism in the gay community.”\n\n“The Village was a melting pot for all sexes and races,” he said .\n\nThe Stonewall bouncer, Ed Murphy (who later went on to become one of the community’s fiercest allies), had previously worked in a hotel with Brown years before the riots. Describing him as a “uniquely bald” man who was nice to everyone, Brown explained how Murphy welcomed him into the bar with drink vouchers on the night of the initial raid. The Stonewall was “packed wall to wall with drag queens, gays, lesbians, and transgender people of all colors” moments before the violence began.\n\nAccording to Brown, although the bar catered to the LGBTQ population, the first room was used by the straight-looking patrons to give the appearance of \"normality\" to passersby. Those who desired more intimate body contact entered by a side door, which led to a back room featuring a large dance floor. This was where the drag queens and trans people hung out. Patrons would feed quarters into the jukebox for popular tunes by Janis Joplin, Diana Ross, and The 5th Dimension.\n\n“This was a luxury for same-sex partners desiring passionate contact not acceptable in most New York bars at the time,” Brown said.\n\nBefore the riots took place, Brown recalls the bar looking “like something from the Elizabethan period,” and though the venue was “a dungeon from the outside” Brown describes it as a “paradise” as soon as he entered.\n\n“We were having the time of our lives when policemen came into the bar and announced, 'This is a raid and we are taking the place. We will be checking IDs and making arrests,' \" Brown said. The patrons who were dressed in conventional attire were the first to be searched, ID-ed, and let go. Brown and his partner were among this group.\n\nThe raid was to monitor the anti-LGBTQ three-piece clothing rule, ensuring men and women wore clothing designated for their gender in a bid to curb queer identity. “I had no idea that it would be a revolutionary night,” Brown said. “But then again, a spark can cause a fire.”\n\n“The Stonewall was rare because it allowed gays, drag queens, hustlers, and homeless young gays to congregate and do their own thing without any hassle or embarrassment.”\n\nMany heroes emerged from the riots, including Marsha P. Johnson, a black trans drag queen and activist, who has since been heralded as the jewel of NYC’s gay community.\n\n“Upon leaving, we were confronted with an angry crowd on the street as far as the eye could see. A paddy wagon was outside and some of the drag queens were sitting inside. They were all pretty, prissy, and made-up with lipstick and rouge, in tight dresses and high heels,” Brown recalls. In his book Stonewall 46 Anniversary: Notes of a 1969 Stonewall Participant, Brown wrote: “As the policemen pushed and hurried them to the paddy wagon, one of the drag queens elbowed a pursuing policeman in the midsection and ran in the opposite direction. Another threw a shoe, which struck another policeman.”\n\n“The angry crowd began to shout insults at the police when they emerged from the bar with trans people in handcuffs,” Brown adds. One of them was Stormé DeLarverie, another hero of the night, who subsequently shouted, according to Brown, “Why don’t you guys do something?”\n\n“Then all hell broke out,” he somewhat pleasantly recalls. “In retaliation to the arrests, the crowd threw bottles, coins, garbage can lids, and rocks. Brown describes the riots as \"our Rosa Parks moment, when we were tired of hiding our faces.”\n\nThe retaliation sparked new hope for LGBTQ people across America and further led to the gay liberation movement a year later. The Stonewall sadly didn’t last in the shadows of the riots, and only three months after the raid was up for lease. Various establishments subsequently filled the venue — a bagel store, a Chinese restaurant, a shoe shop — but it wasn’t until the '90s that the inn reopened as a queer venue.\n\nHowever, Brown admits that it wasn't until 2007 when the Stonewall Inn reopened after a renovation, that he truly realized the significance of the riots. “The unsurmountable progress that has been made toward HIV prevention and HIV antiretroviral drugs has made HIV a chronic illness rather than a death sentence. People are living longer and healthier lives more than ever,\" he said. \"The courageous stand made in the Stonewall riots opened the doors to new successes in the medical field, and in the political arena.\""
