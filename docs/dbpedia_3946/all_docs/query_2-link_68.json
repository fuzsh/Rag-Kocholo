        "text": "Background and Riots\n\nIn 1969 the solicitation of homosexual relations was an illegal act in New York City (as well as in many other urban centers). Bars that catered to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, transgender, and queer) people were places of refuge where the clientele could socialize in relative safety from public harassment. However, many of those bars were subject to regular police harassment.\n\nThe Stonewall Inn was a well-known gathering place for LGBTQ people. The dark, crowded bar, reputedly operating without a liquor license, became the target of a police raid in the early hours of Saturday, June 28, 1969. Nine policemen stormed into the Stonewall Inn and arrested the employees for selling liquor without a license. They roughed up many of its patrons. In accordance with a New York criminal statute that authorized the arrest of anyone not wearing at least three articles of gender-appropriate clothing, the police took several people into custody. It was the third such raid on Greenwich Village gay bars in a short period of time.\n\nThe people milling about outside the bar suddenly became hostile as they watched bar patrons being forced into a police van. Onlookers jeered and gathered close instead of scattering from the scene as they had almost always done in the past. They began throwing bottles and debris at the police officers, who were alarmed by the crowd’s unexpected fury. They called for reinforcements and barricaded themselves inside the bar while some 400 people rioted. Rioters repeatedly broke through the barricade, and the bar was set on fire. Police reinforcements arrived just in time to extinguish the flames, and they eventually dispersed the crowd.\n\nThe riots outside the Stonewall Inn waxed and waned for the next five days. Many historians characterized the uprising as a spontaneous protest against the continually occurring police harassment and social discrimination suffered by LGBTQ people in the 1960s. Although there had been other incidents of protest by gay groups, the Stonewall incident was perhaps the first time that lesbians, gays, transgender, and queer people saw beyond external differences and acted as a united group fighting for a common cause. Occurring in the context of the civil rights and feminist movements, the riots sparked among LGBTQ people the realization that they had to take a more active approach in gaining their civil rights as U.S. citizens.\n\nOutcome\n\nStonewall soon became a symbol of resistance to social and political discrimination that would inspire solidarity among LGBTQ groups for decades. Although the riots caused by the raid on Stonewall Inn did not begin the gay rights movement as such, the riots did serve as a spark to bring about a new generation of political activism. Older groups such as the Mattachine Society, which was founded as a discussion group for gay men in southern California and had flourished in the 1950s, soon made way for more-radical groups such as the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA). These organizations launched numerous public demonstrations to protest the lack of civil rights for LGBTQ individuals. They also often used such tactics as public confrontations of political officials and the disruption of public meetings to challenge and change the moral customs of the times. Acceptance and respect from the establishment were no longer being humbly requested but angrily and righteously demanded. The broad-based radical activism of many LGBTQ people in the 1970s eventually set into motion a new, nondiscriminatory trend in government policies and helped educate society.\n\nThe event sparked the formation of scores of gay rights organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, OutRage! (U.K.-based), GLAAD (formerly Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), PFLAG (formerly Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and Queer Nation. In 1999 the U.S. National Park Service placed the Stonewall Inn on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2016 President Barack Obama designated the site of the Stonewall uprising a national monument. The 7.7-acre (3.1-hectare) monument included the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and the surrounding streets and sidewalks."
