The Stonewall riots, as they came to be known, marked a major turning point in the modern gay civil rights movement in the United States and around the world. Based on David Carter’s “Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution,” and told through interviews with Stonewall patrons, reporters and the policeman who led the raid, “Stonewall Uprising” recalls the fervently hostile climate in which the gay community was forced to live.\n\nThe vast majority of medical authorities decreed homosexuality a mental disorder and often prescribed brutal treatment, including lobotomy.\n\nHomosexual acts were illegal in every state except Illinois and gays frequently found themselves being hauled off to jail, their names splashed in the next day’s newspaper.\n\nPolice entrapment was rampant, and being arrested meant that licenses to teach, practice law, medicine, or cosmetology might be denied or revoked.\n\nEven in Greenwich Village, where thousands of people moved to escape the constant oppression of their hometowns, patrons of gay bars were accustomed to frequent police harassment. But on June 28, 1969, when the N.Y.P.D. raided the Stonewall, the gay community experienced what one Village Voice reporter who was on the scene called it a \"Rosa Parks moment.”\n\nFor the first time, patrons refused to be led into paddy wagons, setting off a violent uprising that launched the gay rights movement. Exactly one year later, America saw its first Gay Pride Parade as thousands marched up Sixth Avenue.\n\nWATCH ON YOUR SCHEDULE:\n\nThis film is available on demand for a limited time with the PBS App. Stream your favorite PBS shows, create the perfect watchlist, connect with your local station, and more — anywhere you watch.\n\nExtend your viewing window with KPBS Passport, a benefit for members ($60 yearly) using your computer, smartphone, tablet, Roku, AppleTV, Amazon Fire or Chromecast.
