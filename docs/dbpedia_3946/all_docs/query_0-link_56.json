        "text": "Heartwarming beauties, lively humor, conversation starters, much-needed mirrors: classics in the making.\n\nDial publishes books for two through teen that aim to entertain, enrich, and encourage our readers. We care deeply about amplifying underrepresented voices and about artistic excellence, and we’re proud of the many awards that have highlighted our focus on these priorities.\n\nRecent awards include Newbery Honors for Roller Girl by Victoria Jamieson and Fighting Words and The War that Saved My Life by Kimberly Brubaker Bradley; the Printz Medal for I’ll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson; a Geisel Honor for The Bear in the Family by Maya Tatsukawa; National Book Award Finalist When Stars Are Scattered by Victoria Jamieson and Omar Mohamed; the Morris and APALA Awards for Darius the Great Is Not Okay by Adib Khorram; a Caldecott Honor for One Cool Friend by Toni Buzzeo and David Small; a Coretta Scott King Honor for How I Discovered Poetry by Marilyn Nelson; a Sibert Honor for Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom by Lynda Blackmon Lowery; Schneider Family Book Award Honors for Get a Grip, Vivy Cohen by Sarah Kapit and When Stars Are Scattered by Victoria Jamieson and Omar Mohamed; Stonewall Honors for Darius the Great Deserves Better by Adib Khorram and I’ll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson; the Sydney Taylor Book Award for Dancing at the Pity Party by Tyler Feder; and Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Honors for Darius the Great Is Not Okay by Adib Khorram, The Best Man by Richard Peck, and It’s Only Stanley by Jon Agee.\n\nEstablished in 1961, Dial Books for Young Readers was an innovator of titles for the very young, including the first quality board books published in the U.S., Rosemary Wells’s Very First Books line, and some of the first wordless picture books, Mercer Mayer’sA Boy, A Dog, and a Frog titles. More recently we continue to publish acclaimed and kid-popular picture books, such as the New York Times Bestsellers Dragons Love Tacos by Adam Rubin and Daniel Salmieri, The Book With No Pictures by B.J. Novak, The Rabbit Listened by Cori Doerrfeld, If I Built a School by Chris Van Dusen, and the Ordinary People Change the World by Brad Meltzer and Christopher Eliopoulos.\n\nDial’s history of publishing change-making books by Black, Indigenous, and creators of color includes such classic titles as Mildred D. Taylor’s Newbery Medal winner Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, Julius Lester’s Newbery Honor winner To Be a Slave, Leo and Diane Dillon’s Caldecott Medal winner Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People’s Ears, s, Jerry Pinkney’s Caldecott Honor winner The Talking Eggs (written by Robert D. San Souci), and Joseph Bruchac’s acclaimed Code Talker.\n\nOther exemplary middle grade and young adult titles from Dial’s backlist—all speaking to our “classics in the making” mission—include Richard Peck’s Newbery Medal winner A Year Down Yonder, Ingrid Law’s Newbery Honor Book Savvy, Holly Goldberg Sloan’s New York Times Bestseller Counting by 7s, Rob Harrell’s much-honored Wink, Jack Cheng’s award-winning See You in the Cosmos, Nancy Werlin’s National Book Award Finalist The Rules of Survival, Gabby Rivera’s acclaimed Juliet Takes a Breath, and Cassie Beasley’s New York Times Bestseller Circus Mirandus.\n\nWe do not accept any unsolicited submissions.\n\nKate Harrison (she/her) spent much of her childhood in a tiny town in Southern Missouri that is best known for its “Throwed Rolls” restaurant, where you actually have to catch your bread in order to eat it. It inspired a strong work ethic, a true love of carbohydrates, and maybe a weird sense of humor. She went to college in North Carolina and worked at Harcourt Children’s Books before spending the last thirteen years at Dial Books for Young Readers. She feels extremely lucky to work with so many incredible authors and illustrators, including Victoria Jamieson, Omar Mohamed, Rob Harrell, Cori Doerrfeld, Ingrid Law, Maya Tatsukawa, Ursula Vernon, Paul Griffin, Hannah E. Harrison, Samantha Cotterill, Jory John, Liz Climo, Vanessa Roeder, Gideon Sterer, Lian Cho, Brad Montague, and many others. Her goal with every book she publishes is to inspire laughter, empathy, introspection, courage, creativity, a new perspective, or hopefully all of those things together. You can often find her wandering around a park (with a small or large child climbing and/or wiping boogers on her), listening to an audiobook, bingeing on podcasts, or reading and eating ice cream late at night when her three kids are finally asleep."
