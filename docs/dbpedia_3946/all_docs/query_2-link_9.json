        "text": "In the weeks following Stonewall, activists in New York organized the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). A few months later, the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) was founded in December 1969. New LGBT+ activist organizations began to form across the United States and internationally. Many of these groups formed at college campuses. While historical accounts have largely focused on the activism on the east and west coasts post-Stonewall, LGBT+ activism was flourishing all over the country, including the midwest and the southern United States.\n\nHowever, gay liberation was not equally liberating for everyone. People of color, women, and trans people were often marginalized by the mainstream gay rights movements, and continued to form their own organizations. In 1970, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson went on to found the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries. Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower formed the Queens Liberation Front in 1969. People of color largely continued to work in separate movements for racial justice and civil rights, never having felt welcome by the predominately white homophile movement.\n\nSimilarly, a number of lesbian activists began to organize independent groups, including lesbian separatist organizations and collectives. Del Martin, co-founder of the Daughters of Bilitis wrote in 1970: \"Goodbye to the male chauvinists of the homophile movement...Gay is Good but not good enough-so long as it is limited to white males only\" (Source: The Advocate).\n\nGLF Chapters\n\nA number of Gay Liberation Front chapters formed throughout the United States. Some worked directly with other GLF chapters, while others worked autonomously. In addition to New York, consulting directories and primary sources show that there were known Gay Liberation Front groups in the following states:\n\nAlabama\n\nArizona\n\nArkansas\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nConnecticut\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nHawaii (One chapter had a listed address at 215 Oahu Avenue in Honolulu (via Waikiki Ministries) and another chapter at 95-605 Waikalani Drive, Wahiawa, Oahu.)\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nIowa\n\nKansas\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisiana\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nMissouri\n\nMontana\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOhio\n\nOregon\n\nPennsylvania\n\nRhode Island\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nVermont\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington\n\nWisconsin\n\nLavender Menace and Radicalesbians\n\nIn 1970, lesbians in the New York Gay Liberation Front went on to form the Radicalesbians, a lesbian activist organization. Try searching activist's names in the Library of Congress Online Catalog to find relevant materials. Known members included: Karla Jay, Martha Shelley, Rita Mae Brown, Lois Hart, Barbara Love, Ellen Shumsky, Artemis March, Cynthia Funk, Linda Rhodes, Arlene Kushner, Ellen Broidy, and Michela Griffon. Angela Romagnoli and Lynn Stern formed the Ann Arbor Radicalesbians, which published the Purple Star.\n\nThe National Lesbian Feminist Organization (NLFO) was founded in Los Angeles, California in 1978. This founding convention was attended by 143 delegates from various parts of the United States.\n\nPrimary Sources:\n\n\"Drag Queens to Form Their Own Organization.\" Gay, no. 1, 1969, p. 10.\n\n\"Drag Queens Demonstrate.\" Drag Magazine, Vol. 1., 1971.\n\nHomophile Action League, HAL Newsletter, Jan/Feb 1970."
