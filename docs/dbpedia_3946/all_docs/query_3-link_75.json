        "text": "The origin of the LGBTQ+ community's Pride Month stems from the Stonewall Uprising, which began on June 28, 1969. At the time the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay club located in Greenwich Village in New York City, bars and clubs were considered a safe haven for the LGBTQ+ community to fully express themselves without fear or repercussion.\n\nDue to regulations in place, New York City Liquor Authority prohibited any establishments from serving alcohol to LGBTQ+ individuals. Because of this, crime families often ran gay clubs and bars without liquor licenses to evade law enforcement.\n\nThe Stonewall Inn became a prominent and exclusive club for the LGBTQ+ community, owned by the Genovese crime family. Police raids still continued, but bars and clubs would receive tips in the event of raid. However, no tip was given when police raided the Stonewall Inn, and a dozen people were arrested. Patrons of the Stonewall became increasingly upset and angry with the constant discrimination, leading to the eruption of a riot involving hundreds of people which would last for five days. This event in history sparked a movement for gay liberation.\n\nA year after the Stonewall Uprising, the first LGBTQ+ Pride March took place at the Stonewall Inn where thousands of people attended."
