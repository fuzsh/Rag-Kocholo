        "text": "\"It was the Rosa Parks moment,\" says one man. June 28, 1969: NYC police raid a Greenwich Village Mafia-run gay bar, The Stonewall Inn. For the first time, patrons refuse to be led into paddy wagons, setting off a 3-day riot that launches the Gay Rights Movement. Told by Stonewall patrons, Village Voice reporters and the cop who led the raid, Stonewall Uprising compellingly recalls the bad old days when psychoanalysts equated homosexuality with mental illness and advised aversion therapy, and even lobotomies; public service announcements warned youngsters against predatory homosexuals; and police entrapment was rampant. At the height of this oppression, the cops raid Stonewall, triggering nights of pandemonium with tear gas, billy clubs and a small army of tactical police. The rest is history.\n\nKate Davis and David Heilbroner have been producing award-winning documentaries for 15 years, with wins at Sundance, Chicago, San Francisco and Hot Docs film festivals, as well as an Emmy and an Oscar nomination in 2018.\n\nEkaterina, a transgender woman and trans rights activist, is a member of the initiative group T-Action, lecturer, presenter and science commentator. She co-created T-Actionâ€™s video short for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.\n\nGalina is a Petersburg journalist. Born in Leningrad, she has worked at radio stations, newspapers and news agencies in Leningrad/Petersburg. She currently works for the news website MR7.ru, as well as the Internet newspaper Fontanka.ru."
