        "text": "Subseries A: Jack Eyerly\n\nThis subseries contains documents specific to Jack Eyerly that were donated after the rest of the materials in this collection. The papers in this subseries reflect Eyerly's interests in his genealogy, art writing, and Northwest art. It also holds pieces of memorabilia such as Polly Eyerly's nameplate from her time as the Curatrix of Education at the Portland Art Museum, photos of Jack Eyerly wearing an Experiments with Art and Technology button shortly after his founding the Portland chapter of the EAT group, and photos with many of the Oregon artists that Eyerly would become friends with over the course of his life. A small publication titled \"Jack Eyerly Memorialized\" is also included. Written by Jim Shull and collaborators, this piece accompanied the service in Eyerly's honor after his death. Shull described this piece as being a labor that was not quite complete. The process of writing it began years before Eyerly's death and was a collaboration between Eyerly, Shull, and many other interesting characters. \"Jack Eyerly Memorialized\" offers stories from the large cast of artists and friends that Eyerly made over the course of his life. It offers information that helps to frame the rest of the materials in the collection, as many of those who offered stories for the memorial also have documents throughout this collection. This subseries provides notes by the secondary arrangers of this collection who worked to compile the material and transfer it to the Willamette University Archives and Special Collections.\n\nBox Folder 51 1\n\nJack Eyerly Business Cards\n\n51 2\n\nBen Vautier - Fluxus Artist\n\n51 3\n\nJack Eyerly Biography\n\n51 4\n\nMounted Photos of Jack Eyerly with two other people\n\n51 5\n\nVital Records\n\n51 6\n\nColor Coordination Sheet from John and Blair\n\n51 7\n\nPhoto of young Jack Eyerly wearing Experiments in Art and Technology (EAT) button\n\n51 8\n\nFour Generation Ancestor Chart\n\n51 9\n\nNegatives - Jack Eyerly and Others - Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) exhibition\n\n51 10\n\nThe elusive popcorn on the river boat photo\n\n51 11\n\nJack Eyerly Business Cards and Photos\n\n51 12\n\nOtto Piene Photos\n\n51 13\n\nPolly Eyerly - Curatrix of Education nameplate\n\n51 14\n\nBob Christ & Al Monner photos\n\nPhotos by Bob Christ and Al Monner, documenting U of O exhibition curated by Eyerly and Tom Robbins - Artists included Lee Kelly, Ronald Peterson, Jan Evans, Donald Peel, Joseph Petta, and more.\n\n51 15\n\nJack Eyerly Resume\n\n51 16\n\nJack Eyerly, The Sunday Oregonian, Eunice Jensen, Artist Finds a way\n\n51 17\n\nJack Eyerly, The Sunday Oregonian, Larry Hanson, The Light Works Critique\n\n51 18\n\nJack Eyerly, The Sunday Oregonian, Dennis Cady, Artist's Book Locally Produced\n\n51 19\n\nJack Eyerly Memorialized, written by Jim Shull and collaborators\n\n64 1\n\nArt and drafting (sketches, sketchbooks, supply catalogs, and correspondence) (folder 1 of 2)\n\n64 2\n\nArt and drafting (sketches, sketchbooks, supply catalogs, and correspondence) (folder 2 of 2)\n\n64 3\n\nJ. projects (Jack Eyerly - projects and notes)\n\n64 4\n\nImages and words\n\n64 5\n\nNotebook with notes by Eyerly\n\n64 6\n\nInk and watercolor sketches\n\n72 1\n\nNewspaper article by Jack Eyerly \"Show 'huge family scrapbook,'\" and newspaper clipping featuring Jack Eyerly\n\n72 2\n\nNewspaper article featuring Jack Eyerly\n\n72 3\n\nDrawings, poems, and sketches by Jack Eyerly; Photographs of Jack Eyerly with friends and family\n\n76 1\n\nDrafts of poetry and personal notes\n\n76 2\n\nLetter to Jack Eyerly from the Portland Art Museum concerning his art\n\n82 1\n\nPhoto prints of Jack and artworks , etc.\n\n83 1\n\nJKE (Jack Kenneth Eyerly) - drawing words (notes and sketches) (folder 1 of 2)\n\n83 2\n\nJKE (Jack Kenneth Eyerly) - drawing words (notes and sketches) (folder 2 of 2)\n\n87 1\n\nPosters made by Jack Eyerly for various events and exhibits\n\n88 1\n\nPiano Mandolin\n\n96 1\n\nJack Eyerly sketches and art\n\n97 1\n\nPortland bus poster (\"In Case of Nuclear Attack\")\n\n101 1\n\nSeattle Bus poster\n\n101 2\n\nJack Eyerly notes and sketches\n\n101 3\n\nJack Eyerly sketches\n\n106 1\n\nThe Paletteers proudly present \"HAW!\", Salem High humor annual\n\nSubseries B: Clifford Gleason\n\nClifford Gleason was an artist of significant note before his death in 1978. Gleason was a student and collaborator of Louis Bunce during the Works Progress Administration era, and would go on to be a long-term teacher at the Museum Art School in Portland, now the Pacific Northwest College of Art. As a student of Bunce, Gleason was one of the early abstract painters of the Northwest and was well known for his paintings, drawings, and murals. In this subseries there are documents relevant to his many shows over the years, as well as many documents specifically related to a retrospective put on by Eyerly at the Blackfish Gallery in 1985 in Gleason's honor, which was titled \"The Late Paintings.\" Many of the works presented in this show are represented by inventory lists and supplemented by either slides or photos of the images used in the show. These materials also document the assistance that Gleason received from his friends and colleagues during his career as an artist.\n\nBox Folder 1 1\n\nMiscellaneous Loose Materials\n\n1 2\n\nMiscellaneous Loose Materials\n\n1 3\n\nLinda Farris\n\nReferences locating a piece by Gleason\n\n1 4\n\nGleason works on paper shown at Rogue Valley Art Association & Photos by Jack Eyerly\n\n1 5\n\nOregon Art Foundation OAF - Melton/Lawrence/Eyerly\n\nNotice from lawyer after Gleason's death\n\n1 6\n\nGovernor's Exhibition\n\n1 7\n\nNotes - Lists Towards Friends - Collectors - List for Governor's Reception (Gov.

One such group included artists with disabilities who aimed to challenge contemporary viewpoints about what it means to live with a disability and how artists with disabilities are able to express themselves. Chiaki Kawajiri, along with collaborators Emery Blackwell and Bonnie Dunn, created a series of photographs entitled \"Flesh of my Flesh,\" which focused on the nude forms of two people with disabilities in an intimate setting. The papers in this collection surrounding this work focus upon the artists' perspectives, the discourse between artists and the public, the gallery showings of the images, and the collaborative relationship between Eyerly and the artists. It touches upon issues of identity, accusations of exploitation of Blackwell and Dunn by Kawajiri, and the further proliferation of the artists with disabilities movement.\n\nBox Folder 3 1\n\nChiaki Kawajiri -

Kazlov was an abstract painter and showcased his works at various galleries in both New York and Oregon. Eventually, he settled down into a home on the Oregon coast in a small community north of Florence, Oregon. During his time at his coastal home, he worked on his paintings alongside his wife, and fellow artist, Luthera (Lu) Stone-Kazlov who worked in a collage-weaving style. While on a trip to Bali in 1992 to investigate buying property, Kazlov was out swimming with a friend when a sudden and powerful undertow pulled him under and drowned him. A letter from Eyerly details the small ceremony that was held in Bali where his body was cremated after his death. Eyerly's papers focus equally upon the life, death, and legacy of Kazlov, with many pieces of correspondence between Eyerly and Luthera Kazlov. Also contained are a series of photographs from an exhibition of Kazlov's works from 1992, likely from a posthumous retrospective arranged by Eyerly. There are also several pieces of correspondence involving Trudi Kazlov, the mother of Brian Kazlov, writing to Eyerly for information about her son.\n\nBox Folder 3 89\n\nPackage with pictures taped together into panoramas\n\n3 90\n\nKazlov 88\n\nShow cards, resumes, biographical notes, correspondence\n\n3 91\n\nLuthera Stone - Photos\n\n3 92\n\nJounne Mulcahy\n\n3 93\n\nBrian Kazlov - OK Harris - Art in America\n\nBrian Kazlov, O.K.

Their letters begin in the early 1960s and continue until the late 2000s with many hundreds of letters exchanged over this time. Paolucci was a well-respected dancer, and she collaborated with various groups and coordinators in many locations such as Eugene (OR), Portland (OR), Seattle (WA), Dallas (TX), Santa Fe (NM), and others. While primarily a dancer, Paolucci was also involved with the visual arts and posed as a model and muse for artists in every city where she stayed. Paolucci also pursued teaching yoga, dance therapy for adults and troubled youths, and studying Ivanovitch Gurdjieff's spiritual and philosophical teachings. This subseries is composed almost entirely of letters exchanged between Eyerly and Paolucci regarding artistic endeavors, dance, and personal anecdotes.\n\nBox Folder 4 22\n\nPat Whalen\n\n4 24\n\nPat P.

He was involved with many different projects, foremost in this collection being his work on the Albina Mural Project. Shamsud-Din was also heavily involved with the Black United Front, a pro-black movement that was evolving in Portland in the late 1970s and early 80s. He was a spokesperson for the movement and was recognized by local news outlets as one of Portland's most influential black individuals of the time. Shamsud-Din was vocal on many issues regarding the black community in Portland, in one case calling for a boycott of the Lloyd center during their 20th anniversary celebration because of the board's involvement in keeping school districts separate. Many of the documents in this subseries reflect an intersection between Shamsud-Din's position as an artist and as a member of the black community. These documents show Shamsud-Din's interest in the equal education of the children from his community, creating art that reflects an underrepresented identity, and the process of finding the resources to make these goals into reality.\n\nBox Folder 5 30\n\nIndependent Publishing Resource Center Materials\n\n5 31\n\nTallah Allen / Craig Thompson\n\n5 32\n\nPeggi Taylor\n\n5 33\n\nHarry Smith\n\n5 34\n\nMatt Groening - The Road to Womanhood Comic\n\n5 35\n\nPat Rosencranz - Comic History\n\n5 36\n\nIndependent Publishing Resource Center (IPRC) Rebecca Gilbert\n\n5 37\n\nRAD\n\n5 38\n\nCharles Erskine Scott Wood\n\n5 39\n\nMeditations on the Book of Creation\n\n5 40\n\nLuthera Stone-Kazlov\n\n5 41\n\nThe Taildragger\n\nNewsletter of the Pearson Air Museum\n\n5 42\n\nCenter for Innovation and Research in Cable Television (CIRCT)\n\n5 43\n\nIsaac Shamsud-Din\n\n5 44\n\nIsaac Shamsud-Din Miscellaneous\n\n5 45\n\nArt for Justice Mural, Albina\n\n5 46\n\nIsaac Photo by A.

Sinclair desired to create a full experience around the fireworks show and was well respected for his ability to craft those experiences. These papers cover Sinclair's design of a show for the 20th anniversary of the Lloyd Center, as well as for many individual private shows. Additionally, a film was created by Harry Dawson entitled \"Fireplay,\" which documents Sinclair's process of creating the pyrotechnical show for the Lloyd Center.

The items within the boxes maintain their original order left by Eyerly, reflecting his design and construction of these papers over time. In many cases these items are in a dialogue with each other over the course of a box and create a narrative of the interactions between artists and groups over time. Throughout the subseries many artists appear multiple times, engaging in new dialogues based upon their box and surrounding folders. There are many artists represented, but individuals such as Ray & Genevieve Barnhart, Deryl Clegg, Tom Cramer, Bob Crist, Don Day, Larry Hanson, Karl Krogstad, Jim Shull, Sid & Pat White, along with others, have many files related to them throughout the collection in multiple locations and compiled over many years of correspondence.\n\nBox Folder 8 10\n\nAce Francis - Work Spaces Limited\n\n8 11\n\nUlvis Alberts\n\n8 12\n\nAnt Farm\n\n8 13\n\nRex Amos\n\n8 14\n\nDon Anawalt\n\n8 15\n\nThyrza Anderson\n\n8 16\n\nArtists Equity - Northwest\n\n8 17\n\nMary Ashley\n\n8 18\n\nBourne, Lars\n\n8 19\n\nBuhmann, Max\n\n8 20\n\nBunse, Don\n\n8 21\n\nBrunk, Al-Kay\n\n8 22\n\nCauduro, Edward\n\n8 23\n\nCavender, Myron\n\n8 24\n\nMike Chase\n\n8 25\n\nCraig Cheshire\n\n8 26\n\nChilstrom, Ray/Betty/Hazel/Gladys\n\n8 27\n\nJames Cicarelli - Gary Hood at Lewis and Clark\n\n8 28\n\nCidoc - Cuernavaca, Mexico\n\n8 29\n\nClarke, John\n\n8 30\n\nJohn Clatworthy\n\n8 31\n\nBob Coghill (Linda)\n\n8 32\n\nLinda Coghill\n\n8 33\n\nHal Cohen\n\n8 34\n\nCMI / Portland State University (PSU) Center for the Moving Image\n\n8 35\n\nJim Colley\n\n8 36\n\nConnie Collins\n\n8 37\n\nSteve Coleton / Film Proposal\n\n8 38\n\nFOOD Co-Ops\n\n8 39\n\nConjecturism\n\n8 40\n\nTerry Conrad\n\n8 41\n\nNancy & Gerry Conrath\n\n8 42\n\nContact Center\n\n8 43\n\nCoplans, John\n\n8 44\n\nBob and Carol Costello\n\n8 45\n\nDave Cotler\n\n8 46\n\nJoseph Cornell\n\n8 47\n\nJim Cox\n\n8 48\n\nColeman, Bob\n\n8 49\n\nSarah Reed Blodgett\n\n8 50\n\nSpace Show\n\n8 51\n\nOregon Arts Commission (OAC) Grant Request\n\n8 52\n\nGrant Exhibits\n\n8 53\n\nInformation Release & Press\n\n8 54\n\nMail List - Dana Atchley\n\n8 55\n\nMailer\n\n8 56\n\nMiscellaneous Project Applications to the Oregon Arts Commission (OAC)\n\n8 57\n\nSpace Co.
