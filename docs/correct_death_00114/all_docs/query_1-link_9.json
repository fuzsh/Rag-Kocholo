        "text": "Charles Mingus understood jazz. More importantly, he understood the blues, and how integral that is to the emotion in jazz. Due to his musical influences being Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, his work both accepted and rejected traditional jazz guidelines, but never strayed far from what the heart of jazz really is: swing.\n\nWhen compared to contemporaries such as Miles Davis or John Coltrane, Mingus’s career is atypical. Due to bouts of clinical depression over the course of his career, he had intense moments of productivity before leaving the jazz scene for extended periods of time due to his mental illness. This, paired with the notion that Mingus was a strict traditionalist, explains Mingus’s relatively small discography containing mostly albums of an established style or genre. As Davis and Coltrane explored the realms of jazz fusion and free jazz, respectively, Mingus stayed true to his big band and bebop roots, sometimes delving into Third Stream (a fusion of western classical music and jazz, but with strict requirements).\n\nHis masterwork is undoubtedly the conceptual album ballet The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady. Recorded with an eleven-piece band, the record’s loose concept revolves around slave life in the south. The music is drenched in Third Stream, big band, flamenco, blues, and gospel, and is unique of both its time period and genre. The album only has four discernable “songs” on it, instead, the piece is divided up into movements as its structure is more akin to a symphony than to a typical jazz album. Other essential recordings by Mingus are: The Clown (with the crescendo of “Haitian Fight Song” and the spoken word narration of the title track), Blues & Roots (featuring one of his most swinging compositions “Moanin'”), Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus (an album featuring re-recordings of his past compositions in a new style derived from the recording of The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, such as the aforementioned “Haitian Fight Song,” renamed to “II B.S.”), and Let My Children Hear Music (his last masterpiece combining most of the elements of his music up to that point).\n\nThroughout his life, Mingus was a politically and socially outspoken man and a heavy proponent of equal rights. His large stature and quick temper led him to be considered as one of jazz’s most intimidating figures, however, unlike most other jazz musicians of the 50s and 60s, Mingus did not shoot heroin. Mingus died at age 56 in Cuernavaca, Mexico in 1979 after succumbing to complications from ALS. Today, Mingus’s compositions live on through the Mingus Big Band, a touring group of handpicked musicians (some of them formerly had been Mingus’s sidemen at some point during their careers) that perform some of his most enduring compositions led by Sue Mingus, the widow of Charles."
