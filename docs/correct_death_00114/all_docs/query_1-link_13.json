Charles Mingus was an influential American jazz musician known for his innovative compositions that drew from various genres including bebop, gospel, blues, and classical music. As a bandleader, he looked for talented musicians and unconventional instrumental configurations. He had a fiery temperament that sometimes led to on-stage outbursts but was also dedicated to collective improvisation and emphasizing each musician's strengths. Mingus had an early interest in trombone and cello but became recognized as one of the most proficient jazz double bass players. He recorded and performed with many influential artists including Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker.",
