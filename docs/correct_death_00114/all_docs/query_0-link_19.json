        "text": "(1922–79). American musician Charles Mingus went beyond the trends of jazz with a personal style so distinctive that the trendsetters scrambled to catch up with him. In elevating the string bass from a mostly rhythmic to a solo instrument, he changed the way not only jazz, but also pop music, is played.\n\nMingus was born in Nogales, Arizona, on April 22, 1922. He studied trombone and cello and at 16 began playing string bass. For five years he studied with a symphonic musician who provided him with a solid technical background. In the 1940s and ’50s he played with several big-band leaders, including Stan Getz, Duke Ellington, and Lionel Hampton, for whom he also composed music.\n\nMingus moved to New York, New York, in 1951, where his career as a composer took off. His Jazz Workshop bands drew enthusiastic audiences, and in the 1960s he appeared frequently at national and international jazz festivals as well as in New York clubs. He also enjoyed a successful recording career.\n\nMingus drew inspiration for his compositions from many sources—Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and blues, gospel, and 20th-century symphonic music. The result was a sound uniquely his own. Most of his work stemmed from collaborations with such improvising musicians as drummer Donnie Richmond and trumpeter Thad Jones.\n\nThis music greatly influenced younger musicians because it retained the best of traditional jazz but offered the freedom of improvisation. As a performer Mingus was inspirational as well. His technical brilliance did not mask his distinctive musical personality, and his inventive playing demanded a place in the forefront. In his hands the bass became a versatile and expressive melodic instrument.\n\nIn the 1960s Mingus became notorious as a problem performer because he would not tolerate inconsiderate audiences. He also became a spokesman for the civil rights of African Americans and the better understanding of musicians. Late in the decade he dropped out of the music scene, but he began to record again in February 1972, and his last creative years are considered by some to be his best. Mingus died in Cuernavaca, Mexico, on January 5, 1979.\n\nMingus left an autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, and a wealth of music in recordings, works for large and small ensembles, and film scores. Some of his better-known works are Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and Pithecanthropus Erectus."
