This intellectual blindness has been programmed. The only way\n\nto understand eugenics as a sophisticated \"crowd control\" device is to view the big picture. The big picture\n\ntells us that powerful Mind Control is all around us and even runs through us. This is no passive\n\ndevelopment. Like usury, eugenics is a major \"crowd control\" and Mind Control device employed by the\n\nelite against the non-elite which has been deliberately made invisible via your own belief system. It's\n\ntop-down programming has been manipulated secretly. By \"depatterning\" our minds, beginning in\n\nchildhood, Tavistock and their Tory American allies serve a broader agenda of psychological warfare\n\nagainst the democratic mind.\n\n\"We are your overlords.\"— Led Zeppelin\n\nTo weaken the moral fiber of the nation and to demoralize workers in the labor class by creating mass\n\nunemployment, demoralization can be advanced as a science. It can even be made utterly irresistible, sexy\n\nand hip. As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome, the\n\nreport envisages demoralized and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs, simultaneously\n\nseeking more and more top-down government. Top-down reversals of individual-rights-based social\n\ncontracts, like the U.S. Constitution, require the destruction of parental authority then replacing the parent\n\nwith programmed bureaucrats. Through crisis, this can produce a cascading effect toward mass\n\nprogramming, effectively reversing the Constitution.\n\nView the YouTube video: History of Eugenics and the plan for World Domination\n\nThe elite cannot possibly accomplish this parental and constitutional coup legally, due to obvious rational\n\narguments, so they will require powerful cultural shaping methods employed through Mind Control over\n\ngenerations to manipulate the irrational subconscious mind. Enter Tavistock. The youth of the land will be\n\nencouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel against their parents and the status quo, thus\n\nundermining and eventually destroying the family unit. This process will favor war, violence and\n\nbureaucrats over parents. Ultimately, the \"Sun King\" power system will then be put in place where wrongful\n\nauthority will function as a psychologically blinding authority, allowed to carry out all atrocities fully invisibly.\n\nIn this regard, the Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could\n\nbe achieved. Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of Professor\n\nWillis Harmon. This work later became known as the \"Aquarian Conspiracy\".— Targets of the Illuminati and\n\nthe Committee of 300 By Dr. John Coleman.\n\nEven the traditional parental duty, known for centuries to advance healthy and intelligent children, can\n\neffectively be trivialized, demonized and criminalized in the non-elite masses. Through Freudian\n\ntaboo-building and Mass brainwashing, the elite can fully control the most powerful tool known for child\n\ndevelopment for centuries! This critical knowledge can be fully suppressed and controlled by a very small\n\nelite. The non-elite masses are now so thoroughly programmed not to question the thugs and criminals at\n\nthe top of the Sun King power pyramid, that we now routinely destroy non-elite parents and children by the\n\nmillions simply because of Tavistock Freudian taboos. Then our children are fully set up to be\n\nmind-controlled by powerful Tavistock rock music, movies, video games, on and on and on.\n\nPage 1 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nDr. John Coleman, former intelligence officer with Britain's MI6 and author of Conspirators Hierarchy, The\n\nCommittee of 300, was one of the first writers to bring the world's attention to the existence of the pivotal\n\nrole that Tavistock plays in shaping political, social, educational, and economic 'opinions', especially in the\n\nUnited States. It is in the United States where mass deception about child development, child\n\nempowerment and \"crowd control\" media propaganda is most profoundly universal due to highly\n\nunconstitutional wrongful authority by the federal government.\n\nTavistock, a progressive society, was founded in London in 1 920; the Tavistock Clinic opened in 1 920. It\n\nalways had secret ties to British Freemasonry. Its aims include social control, information control; and\n\ncontrol of the hidden information environment. Practically, his means it has control mechanisms in\n\nacademia, multimedia, intelligence, and medicine especially pharmaceuticals. Tavistock is part of the\n\nglobal shadow government.\n\nNo group did more to propagandize the U.S. to participate in WWI and WWII at a time when the majority of\n\nthe American people were opposed to it. British oligarchs used Tavistock to shape and control public\n\nopinion in order to manipulate the British public (and later the American public) into accepting the notion\n\nthat war with Germany was necessary in order \"to secure a lasting peace.\" The plan to 'create' public\n\nopinion began in 1 91 3 as a propaganda factory centered at Wellington House in London.\n\nFunding was initially provided by the Royal family, but soon to include the Rothchilds (related to Lord\n\nNorthcliffe by marriage) and the Rockefellers. Wellington House would grow into the Tavistock Institute in\n\n1 921 after the propaganda \"victories\" of the First World War and the Federal Reserve banking system\n\n(created in 1913) had been secured. Three elements combine to make the Institute unusual, if not unique:\n\nit has the independence of being entirely self-financing, with no subsidies from the government or other\n\nsources; the action research orientation places it between, but not in, the worlds of academia and\n\nconsultancy; and its range of disciplines include anthropology, economics, organizational behavior, political\n\nscience, psychoanalysis, psychology and sociology.\n\nWe assume large corporations have economic objectives. But we don't expect them to have a secret social\n\nand occult agenda as well. For example, we don't expect them to engineer arrested development and\n\nfamily breakdown. We don't expect them to use pop culture to foster alienation and dysfunction. But\n\nevidence suggests Tavistock and its sister organizations do exactly that. With advanced psychology, the\n\n\"programming\" of the unconscious mind through popular culture, movies, television and even comic books\n\nbecame a major concern for Congress in the 1 950s in regard to communist programming. The best\n\nmethod to counter-act such an attack on our children, it was assumed, was to advance and control such\n\nprogramming ourselves. Tavistock was called in to arrange such programming of our collective\n\nunconscious minds for national securtity reasons.\n\nBut central bankers based in the City of London control the cartels that dominate the world and they have\n\ntheir own agendas. They finagled the right to print money based on our credit and quite naturally used this\n\nadvantage to buy everything worth having. This might be tolerable if limitless wealth was all they wanted.\n\nBut they also want limitless power: not just one-world dictatorship but total control over our minds and\n\nsouls. Popular culture is engineered to brainwash each of us from cradle to grave. Trends and megatrends\n\nare manufactured, engineered by corporations.\n\nSociety evolves slowly toward \"social efficiency\" all by itself; society under stress, however, evolves much\n\nfaster! Thus the deliberate creation of crisis is an important tool of evolutionary socialists. Does that help\n\nyou understand the global drama a little better, or well-publicized doomsday scenarios?\n\nTavistock provided most of the detailed programs for establishing the Office of Naval Intelligence, (ONI).\n\nThis wing of intelligence dwarfs the CIA in size and scope. The U.S. Government gave billion dollar\n\nPage 2 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\ncontracts to Tavistock. Tavistock’s strategic planners provide most of the long-range plans used in the\n\ndefense establishment.\n\nAccording to LaRouche and other authorities, Tavistock organized and trained the entire staffs of the Office\n\nof Strategic Services (OSS), the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of the Allied\n\nExpeditionary Forces, and other key American military groups during World War II. During World War II,\n\nthe Tavistock Institute combined with the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller Foundation for\n\nesoteric experiments with mind-altering drugs. The present drug culture of the United States is traced in its\n\nentirety to this Institute, which supervised the Central Intelligence Agency’s training programs. The \"LSD\n\ncounter culture\" originated when Sandoz A.G., a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg &\n\nCo., developed a new drug from lysergic acid, called LSD. James Paul Warburg (son of Paul Warburg who\n\nhad written the Federal Reserve Act in 1910), financed a subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute in the United\n\nStates called the Institute for Policy Studies, whose director, Marcus Raskin, was appointed to the National\n\nSecurity Council. James Paul Warburg set up a CIA program to experiment with LSD on CIA agents, some\n\nof whom later committed suicide. This program, MK-Ultra, supervised by Dr. Gottlieb, resulted in huge\n\nlawsuits against the United States Government by the families of the victims.The English Tavistock\n\nInstitute has not restricted its activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the programs of such\n\nsupposedly \"conservative\" American think tanks as the Herbert Hoover Institute at Stanford University,\n\nHeritage Foundation, Wharton, Hudson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Rand. The \"sensitivity\n\ntraining\" and \"sexual encounter\" programs of the most radical California groups such as Esalen Institute\n\nand its many imitators were all developed and implemented by Tavistock Institute psychologists.\n\nhttp://www.whale.to/b/tavistock_q.html\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Society of which Prescott Bush was a director was a project of the Order of Skull and\n\nBones. The society \"would evolve into the CIA's cultural engineering effort of the 1 950s, the drugs and\n\nbrainwashing adventure known as 'MK-Ultra'. ..an anti-American project which poured drugs into the\n\ncountry and worked to fabricate the drug-sex youth culture.\" It would build powerful hysteria centered on\n\ndestroying the parent-child bond, advance the idea of broad child abuse requiring strong government sex\n\nand drug inquisitions, secretly promoting broad acceptance of divorce and family dysfunction. The Bushes\n\nwould then champion \"family values\" as public officials.\n\n\"A behavior control research project was begun in the 1 950s, coordinated by the British psychological\n\nwarfare unit called the Tavistock Institute, with the Scottish Rite Masons, the Central Intelligence Agency,\n\nand other British, U.S., Canadian, and United Nations agencies. The project became famous in the 1970s\n\nunder a CIA code name, 'MK-Ultra.' Its notoriety for brainwashing by drugs, hypnosis, electroshock, and\n\nother tortures caused many books to be written about the project, and the U.S. Senate conducted hearings\n\nwhich exposed many of its abusive features. The true intent of using this research against millions of\n\nAmericans through \"Child Services\" organizations was never publicly presented. President Gerald Ford\n\nappointed a commission headed by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, to correct the CIA's misconduct.\n\nThere was a widespread anti-establishment view at the time, that here was the fox appointed to guard the\n\nhen house.\"\n\nThe Mental Hygiene movement was organized into the World Federation of Mental Health by none other\n\nthan Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England who, with Hjalmar Schacht, the financial engineer\n\nof the Nazi rearmament program and member of the British Round Table, and Benjamin Strong of the New\n\nYork Federal Reserve Bank, conspired to precipitate the Great Depression. Under Adolf Hitler, Hjalmar\n\nSchacht was appointed Minister of Economics. [See: Eugenics: All in the Family]\n\n\"The Mental Hygiene movement was organized into the World Federation of Mental Health by Montagu\n\nNorman, former Brown Brothers partner and Bank of England Governor. Norman had appointed as the\n\nPage 3 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nfederation's chairman, Brigadier John Rawlings Rees, director of the Tavistock Psychiatric Clinic, chief\n\npsychiatrist and psychological warfare expert for the British intelligence services. ..its goals were population\n\ncontrol, eugenics and political power.\n\n\"The world financial crisis led to the merger of the Walker-Harriman bank with Brown Brothers in 1931 .\n\nFormer Brown partner Montagu Norman and his protege Hjalmar Schacht paid frantic visits to New York\n\nthat year and the next, preparing the new Hitler regime for Germany.\"\n\nThe interaction between the British, American and German Eugenics societies laid the foundation for\n\nimplementation of the race purification ideology behind Hitler's Third Reich. In 1912, the First International\n\nCongress of Eugenics was held at the University of London. The president of the Congress was Major\n\nLeonard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin and one of the first English vice presidents was Sir Winston\n\nChurchill, later Prime Minister of England. In 1 921 , the Second International Congress of Eugenics was\n\nheld in New York City. The sponsoring committee included Herbert Hoover, later President of the U.S., and\n\nthe Carnegie Institute of Washington (Rockefeller). Madison Grant, a director of the American Eugenics\n\nSociety, was the treasurer. The event was held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York,\n\nwhere Averell Harriman served on the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 1932, the Third International Congress on Eugenics elected as its president Dr. Ernst Rudin, a\n\npsychiatrist who directed the various branches of the Rockefeller-founded/funded Kaiser Wilhelm Institute\n\nin Germany, and designated Rudin president of the worldwide Eugenics Federation. In 1933, Rudin was\n\ncommissioned by Hitler's Minister of the Interior to write a sterilization law for Germany. Rudin's Law for the\n\nPrevention of Hereditary Diseases in Posterity was modeled on statutes already passed in Virginia and\n\nother states in the U.S. When Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, Ernst Rudin\n\npraised Hitler, giving credit to him because \"the dream we have cherished for more than thirty years of\n\nseeing racial hygiene converted into action has become reality.\"\n\n\"The most important American political event in those preparations for Hitler was the infamous 'Third\n\nInternational Congress on Eugenics,' held at New York's American Museum of Natural History August\n\n21-23, 1932, supervised by the International Federation of Eugenics Societies. 9 This meeting took up the\n\nstubborn persistence of African-Americans and other allegedly 'inferior' and 'socially inadequate' groups in\n\nreproducing, expanding their numbers, and amalgamating with others. It was recommended that these\n\n'dangers' to the 'better' ethnic groups and to the 'well-born,' could be dealt with by sterilization or 'cutting off\n\nthe bad stock' of the 'unfit.'\n\n\"Italy's fascist government sent an official representative. Averell Harriman's sister Mary, director of\n\n'Entertainment' for the Congress, lived down in Virginia fox-hunting country; her state supplied the speaker\n\non 'racial purity,' W.A. Plecker, Virginia commissioner of vital statistics. Plecker reportedly held the\n\ndelegates spellbound with his account of the struggle to stop race-mixing and inter-racial sex in Virginia.\n\n\"The Congress proceedings were dedicated to Averell Harriman's mother; she had paid for the founding of\n\nthe race-science movement in America back in 1 91 0, building the Eugenics Record Office as a branch of\n\nthe Galton National Laboratory in London. She and other Harrimans were usually escorted to the horse\n\nraces by old George Herbert Walker-they shared with the Bushes and the Farishes a fascination with\n\n'breeding thoroughbreds' among horses and humans.\n\n\"Averell Harriman personally arranged with the Walker/Bush Hamburg-Amerika Line to transport Nazi\n\nideologues from Germany to New York for this meeting. 1 1 The most famous among those transported\n\nwas Dr. Ernst Rudin, psychiatrist at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography in Berlin,\n\nwhere the Rockefeller family paid for Dr. Rudin to occupy an entire floor with his eugenics 'research.' Dr.\n\nRudin had addressed the International Federation's 1928 Munich meeting, speaking on 'Mental Aberration\n\nPage 4 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nand Race Hygiene,' while others (Germans and Americans) spoke on race-mixing and sterilization of the\n\nunfit. Rudin had also led the German delegation to the 1 930 Mental Hygiene Congress in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"At the Harrimans' 1 932 New York Eugenics Congress, Ernst Rudin was unanimously elected president of\n\nthe International Federation of Eugenics Societies. This was recognition of Rudin as founder of the German\n\nSociety for Race Hygiene, with his co-founder, Eugenics Federation vice president Alfred Ploetz.\n\n\"As depression-maddened financiers schemed in Berlin and New York, Rudin was now official leader of\n\nthe world eugenics movement. Components of his movement included groups with overlapping leadership,\n\ndedicated to:\n\n-sterilization of mental patients ('mental hygiene societies');\n\n-execution of the insane, criminals and the terminally ill ('euthanasia societies'); and\n\n-eugenical race-purification by prevention of births to parents from 'inferior' blood stocks ('birth control\n\nsocieties').\n\n\"Before the Auschwitz death camp became a household word, these British-American-European groups\n\ncalled openly for the elimination of the 'unfit' by means including force and violence.\"\n\nBehind the Tavistock Institute and its brainchild, MK-Ultra, was the largesse of the Rockefeller Foundation,\n\n\"a global instrument for radical social change, using American money and British strategy.\" British\n\npsychiatry: from eugenics to assassination by Anton Chaitkin reveals John D. Rockefeller's interest in\n\npsychiatric genetics, which \"applied to psychiatry the concepts of eugenics (otherwise known as race\n\npurification, race hygiene, or race betterment) developed in London's Galton Laboratory and its offshoot\n\nEugenics Societies in England and America.\" Besides Rockefeller and the British Crown, the families of\n\nWarburg and Harriman were the primary funders of eugenics internationally.\n\nThe \"science\" of eugenics deliberately conceals vital information from parents and children: all the Mind\n\nControl manipulation devices employing sex, drugs and usury are easy to protect children from through\n\nobjective education. This education is deliberately repressed! What's worse, active psychological warfare\n\nincludes active demoralization campaigns making this education even more urgent as parents are\n\nsimultaneously victimized by this eugenics scam.\n\n\"The foundation's 'German centers combined the search for organic signs of mental illness with eugenic\n\nprojects.... The [Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry in Munich] had initially been endowed with 1 1\n\nmillion marks, contributed by Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach [head of the Krupp steel and arms\n\nfamily] and James Loeb [Paul Warburg's brother-in-law], an expatriate American of the Kuhn-Loeb banking\n\nfamily. Loeb mobilized his American-Jewish friends to support the institute,' and they invited the foundation\n\nto reorganize and expand the Munich enterprise. Loeb also continued financing the institute. Loeb's\n\nrelatives, the Warburgs, owners of Kuhn Loeb bank, were the intimate banking partners of William\n\nRockefeller. Together with him they had set up the Harriman family in big business, using capital supplied\n\nby the British royal family's personal banker, Sir Ernst Cassell. The three families, Rockefeller, Warburg,\n\nand Harriman, together with British Crown agencies, jointly sponsored much of the social engineering\n\nenterprise we shall describe here. The Rockefeller Foundation made an initial grant of $2.5 million in 1925\n\nto the Psychiatric Institute in Munich, gave it $325,000 for a new building in 1 928, and continuously\n\nsponsored the institute and its Nazi chief Rudin through the Hitler era. The foundation paid for a 1930-35\n\nanthropological survey of the 'eugenically worthwhile population' by Nazi eugenicists Rudin, Verschuer,\n\nEugen Fischer, and others.\"\n\nThrough funding the \"research\" of Ernst Rudin and Otmar Von Verschuer, they also financed the horrific\n\nexperimentation of Verschuer's medical commandant, Josef Mengle, the \"Angel of Death\" of Auschwitz\n\nPage 5 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nwhose experiments on children, especially twins, provided scientific data for the Kaiser Wilhem Institute:\n\n\"Of the 3000 twins who passed through Mengele's labs, only 200 survived the war. Depending on the type\n\nof experiment endured by the twins, they were driven to various labs at Auschwitz or neighboring Birkenau\n\ncamp. Most received routine blood and x-ray tests, often on a daily basis... Mengele's experiments both\n\nphysical and psychological; experimental surgeries performed without anesthesia, transfusions of blood\n\nfrom one twin to another, isolation endurance, reaction to various stimuli, injections with lethal germs, sex\n\nchange operations, the removal of organs and limbs, incestuous impregnations... Mengele injected\n\nchemicals into the eyes of children in an attempt to change their eye color... Unfortunately a strict veil of\n\nsecrecy over the experiments enabled Mengele to do his work more effectively, and 'twins who were\n\nsubjected to the most grusome procedures took his secrets to their graves.' The full extent of his grusome\n\nwork will never be known because the records he sent to Dr. Von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute\n\nwere shipped out 'in two truckloads' and destroyed by the latter. Any remaining notes Mengele carried with\n\nhim on his escape to South America and those were never found.\"\n\nAccording to Fritz Springmeier, Josef Mengele was used by the Illuminati to develop trauma-based mind\n\ncontrol by experimenting on Jewish victims in the Holocaust, and after the war Mengele was smuggled to\n\nthe U.S. to put mind control into practice as one of the CIA's main mind control programmers. The author of\n\n\"Mind Control The Ultimate Terror\" credits Mengele with development of the MK Ultra mind control\n\nprogram:\n\n\"Dr. Joseph Mengele of Auschwitz notoriety was the principle developer of the MK Ultra and Monarch mind\n\ncontrol programs. Mengele and hundreds of other high ranking Nazis were secretly moved into the United\n\nStates and South America in the aftermath of World War II in an Operation designated Paperclip. The\n\nNazis continued their work in developing mind control and rocketry technologies in secret underground\n\nmilitary bases. The only thing we were told about was the rocketry work with former Nazi star celebrities\n\nlike Warner Von Braun. The killers, torturers, and mutilators of innocent human beings were kept discretely\n\nout of sight, but busy in their underground military facilities which soon became home to thousands upon\n\nthousands of kidnapped American children snatched off the streets and placed into iron bar cages stacked\n\nfrom floor to ceiling. These children would be used to further refine and perfect Mengele's mind control\n\ntechnologies. These children (at least the ones who survived the 'training') would become future mind\n\ncontrolled slaves who could be used for anything from sexual blackmail to assassinations.\"\n\nrole of george h.w. bush:\n\neugenics revived as population control\n\nTavistock's Many U.S. Mind Control Subsidiaries.\n\nBy Dennis L.

Now why would the U.S. want someone\n\nto head Pakistan who has and publicly uses very bad information (Osama's murder) if she was wrong? Or,\n\nif she was correct, why would the press and media censor such important news from the American people?\n\nCould it be that the power elite doesn't want the public to know Osama's dead because that would\n\ndecrease interest in the \"war on terror\"? And could Bhutto's \"spilling the beans\" have played a role in her\n\nown assassination? Concerning another of my recent articles, \"The Power Elite's Use of Wars and Crises\"\n\n(January 28), someone may have gotten the impression that the First World War was planned beginning\n\naround 1 910. Actually wars are planned by the power elite far in advance, and the First World War,\n\nfollowed by a world government, was planned long before 1 91 0. For example, in 1 908 THE JOURNAL OF\n\nAMERICAN HISTORY (Vol. 2, No. 4) begins with these words: \"'The most fearful war of the century is\n\ncoming soon. After the war, will come world-peace--the highest development of the race in this cycle.' This\n\nis the prediction made a few days ago by a distinguished political economist.\"]\n\nI was listening to a discussion regarding the Middle East and thought to myself \"Don't they understand that\n\nwhat's happening has been planned?\" This is not only true in geopolitics (FDR said nothing happened in\n\npolitics by accident) but in all facets of life. In music in the 1 950s and 1 960s, rock music didn't just happen\n\nby accident. Theodor Adorno and others theorized years earlier how it could change people. Similarly in\n\nart, Bertolt Brecht said, \"Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it.\"\n\nMany people are familiar with the impact of the Leipzig and Frankfurt Schools upon society, but relatively\n\nfew understand the impact of Tavistock. Therefore, this article will look at that organization and how it has\n\nshaped/planned our lives and the course of the world.\n\nThe name Tavistock is associated with human relations and psychiatry (see statue of Freud in front of\n\nTavistock Institute). Charles Dickens (who had written of \"pencils of light,\" which is similar to the term\n\n\"points of light\") moved to Tavistock House in October 1951 . Tavistock is an area in southwest Devon in\n\nEngland, but the story begins elsewhere.\n\nThe term \"psychiatry\" was first used in 1 808 by Johann Christian Reil, and it means \"doctoring of the soul.\"\n\nThe primary schools of psychiatry were established in the early 1800s in Leipzig and Berlin.\n\nAt Leipzig University in 1 879, Wilhelm Wundt established the first psychological laboratory, and among his\n\nstudents were Ivan Pavlov, William James (the \"Father of American Psychology\"), and G. Stanley Hall\n\n(who would become the mentor of John Dewey, the \"Father of Progressive Education\"). Pavlov is\n\nwell-known for his stimulus-response experiments with dogs. In Clarence Karier's SCIENTISTS OF THE\n\nMIND (1 986), one reads concerning James that \"we pass from a culture with God at its center to a culture\n\nwith man at its center.\" James was also noted for his famous description of reality as \"one great blooming,\n\nbuzzing confusion.\" Of possible interest in this regard is that a symbol of Rosicrucianism is \"buzzing\" bees\n\nseeking the nectar (wisdom) of a (blooming) rose. And Hall founded \"genetic psychology\" while also using\n\nWundt's experimental psychology in the area of child development. Hall and James meshed in John\n\nDewey, an educational psychologist, who co-authored the first \"man-centered\" HUMANIST MANIFESTO\n\nin 1933. Dewey, John B. Watson and other leading psychologists in the early 20th century were interested\n\nin the behavior of people. They didn't believe that man had a soul in the Biblical sense of the word. Thus it\n\nwas not surprising that at the 6th International Congress of Philosophy, which took place at Harvard\n\nUniversity in 1 926, it was stated that the \"soul or consciousness... now is of very little importance....\n\nBehaviorism sang their funeral dirge while material ism-the smiling heir- arranges a suitable funeral for\n\nthem.\"\n\nWhat does all this have to do with Tavistock? In 1920, the Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology\n\n(TIMP) was founded. It was involved in psychotherapy, and psychiatrists at the Tavistock Clinic wanted to\n\napply their findings to the general public in the form of certain social service programs.\n\nPage 7 of 52 Sep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nJohn Rawlings Rees (who would be a co-founder of the World Federation for Mental Health in 1 948) was\n\nDeputy Director of Tavistock at this time (he would become Director in 1 932). Rees developed the\n\n\"Tavistock Method,\" which induces and controls stress via what Rees called \"psychologically controlled\n\nenvironments\" in order to make people give up firmly held beliefs under \"peer pressure.\"\n\nRees' Tavistock Method was based on work done by British psychoanalyst Wilfrid Bion regarding the roles\n\nof individuals within groups. This design was later shifted in a series of conferences (1 957-1965) led by A.\n\nKenneth Rice, chairman of Tavistock's Centre for the Applied Social Research. The shift was to the\n\ndynamics of leadership and authority relations in groups. According to the A.K. Rice Institute, \"In 1 965 Rice\n\nled a conference in the United States, as the Tavistock Method began to be developed in the U.S. by\n\nMargaret Rioch and others. The A.K. Rice Institute is now the U.S. equivalent of the Tavistock Institute.\"\n\nIn 1930, TIMP had been involved with the second biennial Conference on Mental Health, where\n\npsychiatrist J.R. Lord advocated challenging old values, saying \"the aim should be to control not only\n\nnature, but human nature.\" And he spoke of the \"necessity to disarm the mind.\"\n\nRees went even further than this on June 1 8, 1 940 at the annual meeting of the National Council for Mental\n\nHygiene of the United Kingdom. In his speech on \"Strategic Planning for Mental Health,\" he proclaimed:\n\n\"We can therefore justifiably stress our particular point of view with regard to the proper development of the\n\nhuman psyche, even though our knowledge be incomplete. We must aim to make it permeate every\n\neducational activity in our national life.... We have made a useful attack upon a number of professions. The\n\ntwo easiest of them naturally are the teaching profession and the Church: the two most difficult are law and\n\nmedicine.... Public life, politics and industry should all of them be within our sphere of influence.... If we are\n\nto infiltrate the professional and social activities of other people, I think we must imitate the Totalitarians\n\nand organize some kind of fifth column activity! If better ideas on mental health are to progress and spread\n\nwe, as the salesmen, must lose our identity.... Let us all, therefore, very secretly be 'fifth columnists.'\" (See\n\nMENTAL HEALTH, Vol. 1 , No. 4, October 1 940)\n\nIn 1935, Harvard psychologist (1930-1967) Gordon All port co-authored THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RADIO\n\nwith Hadley Cantril. Allport would be a leading agent in the U.S. for the Tavistock Institute, and Cantril in\n\n1 937 would be a member of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Office of Radio Research at Princeton\n\nUniversity established to study the influence of radio on different groups of listeners. In 1 940, Cantril would\n\nauthor THE INVASION FROM MARS: A STUDY IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PANIC regarding the radio\n\nbroadcast of H.G. Wells' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. Tavistock senior staffer, Fred Emery, would later\n\n(HUMAN RELATIONS, Vol. 12, No. 3, August 1959) begin his article on \"Working Hypotheses on the\n\nPsychology of Television\" with the words: \"The psychological after-effects of television are of considerable\n\ninterest to the would-be social engineer.\"\n\nDuring the Second World War, Tavistock was part of Great Britain's Psychological Warfare Department.\n\nOn May 7, 1 944, Dr. Rees of Tavistock and the British War Ministry injected Nazi prisoner Rudolf Hess\n\nwith the narcotic Evipan. According to Lt. Col. Eugene Bird in PRISONER NO. 7: RUDOLF HESS (in the\n\nchapter titled \"A Secret Drug\"), Rees examined Hess 35 times. Rees and his associates via chemicals\n\ncaused Hess's memory to fail and then \"explained that they could bring back the memory with an injection\n\nof Evipan.\" Hess was told that \"while under its influence he would remember the past he had forgotten.\"\n\nIn 1945, Rockefeller Foundation medical director Alan Gregg was touring various institutions that had been\n\ninvolved in war medicine to see if any group would commit to undertake the kind of social psychiatry that\n\nhad been developed by the Army during wartime (e.g., cultural psychiatry for the analysis of the enemy\n\nmentality), and see if it could be relevant for the civilian society (on April 11,1 933, Rockefeller Foundation\n\npresident Max Mason assured trustees that in their program, \"the Social Sciences will concern themselves\n\nPage 8 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nwith the rationalization of social control,... the control of human behavior\"). This led to a Rockefeller grant\n\nthat resulted in the birth of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London in 1 947. Tavistock would\n\njoin with Kurt Lewin's Research Center for Group Dynamics (RCGD) at the University of Michigan the next\n\nyear to begin publication of the international journal, HUMAN RELATIONS, relating theory to pracice. The\n\nfirst volume contained articles such as \"Overcoming Resistance to Change,\" and \"A Comparison of the\n\nAims of the Hitler Youth and the Boy Scouts of America.\" The Tavistock Institute would use Lewin's\n\ntechniques to arrange \"therapeutic communities.\"\n\nLewin had received his Ph.D. from Berlin University in 1914, and in 1932 came to the U.S. in the area of\n\nchild psychology. During the Second World War, he worked for the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (which\n\nwould become the CIA) in psychological warfare. He founded the RCGD in 1946. The next year his\n\nresearch center along with a division of the National Education Association (NEA) began the National\n\nTraining Laboratories (NTL) which furthered Lewin's social engineering via \"T-groups\" (training groups),\n\nwhere group consensus is facilitated by trained individuals.\n\nOver the next two decades, the NTL would spread its operations to various countries around the world.\n\nAnd in its ISSUES IN (HUMAN RELATIONS) TRAINING (1962), its sensitivity training is referred to as\n\n\"brainwashing.\" Recently, NTL has conducted programs relevant to Tavistock such as \"NTL and\n\nTavistock: Two Traditions of Group Work,\" \"Tavistock Program: Re-Thinking and Planning for\n\nOrganizational Change,\" and \"The Tavistock-Task Working Conference which is a program structured\n\naround various group configurations.... Periodically each group will review its actions and results to learn\n\nfrom processes, roles, values, and methods as they evolve.\" Other recent NTL programs have featured\n\npeople such as New Ager Jean Houston and the witch Starhawk.\n\nThe year after Tavistock and the RCGD began publishing HUMAN RELATIONS, the journal (Vol. II, No. 3,\n\n1949), published \"Some Principles of Mass Persuasion\" by Dorwin Cartwright who helped establish the\n\nInstitute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. In this article, Cartwright reveals: \"It is\n\nconceivable that one persuasive person could, through the use of mass media, bend the world's population\n\nto his will.\" The article goes on to describe \"the modification of cognitive structure in individuals by means\n\nof mass media\" and how \"a person can be induced to do voluntarily something that he would otherwise not\n\ndo.\" The article also provides \"a list of essential requirements for the success of any campaign of mass\n\npersuasion.\"\n\nSeven years after Cartwright's article appeared, prominent psychiatrist R.D. Laing was appointed senior\n\nregistrar at the Tavistock Clinic in 1956, three years after he left the British Army Psychiatric Unit. He\n\nbegan experimenting with LSD in 1 960, and then in 1 962 when he became a family therapist at the\n\nTavistock Institute of Human Relations, he also met Gregory Bateson while visiting the U.S. Bateson had\n\nbeen with the Office of Strategic Services (forerunner of the CIA), and then led the MK-Ultra hallucinogen\n\n(LSD) project. Bateson's and Margaret Mead's daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson, along with New Ager\n\nJean Houston, would later help Hilary Clinton write IT TAKES A VILLAGE. IN 1964 Laing met LSD\n\nproponent Timothy Leary in New York and also authored \"Transcendental Experience in Relation and\n\nPsychosis\" (THE PSYCHEDELIC REVIEW, Vol. 1 , No. 3, 1964). Three years later Laing participated in the\n\nJuly 1 5-30 1 967 Dialectics of Liberation Congress.\n\nIn 1964, Fred Emery, who would be a senior member of Tavistock, wrote \"Theories of Social Turbulence\"\n\nwhich he explained more fully in FUTURES WE ARE IN (1975). According to this theory, individuals or\n\nsocieties faced with a series of crises will attempt to reduce the tension by adaptation and eventually\n\npsychological retreat as if anesthetized (similar to Pavlov's \"protective inhibition response\"). This can lead\n\nto social disintegration, which Emery called \"segmentation.\"\n\nIn 1970, the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) of the NEA published TO\n\nPage 9 of 52 Sep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nNURTURE HUMANENESS: COMMITMENT FOR THE 70s, in which Sidney Jourard (Fellow at the\n\nTavistock Clinic and former president of the Association for Humanist Psychology), wrote: \"We are in a\n\ntime of revolt.... The new society will be a fascist state or it will be pluralistic and humanistic.\" The primary\n\ncharacteristic of the fascist state is increasing control over people's lives by government in league with\n\ncorporations. Sound like today?\n\nRelevant to this, in October 1997 the Tavistock Institute (and Manchester University) completed a final\n\nreport (under Contract ERB-SOE2-CT-96-201 1 ) for the European Commission, and described in a report\n\nsummary was that there will be \"partnerships between government, industry, and representatives of worker\n\norganizations.\" The report summary also described \"the relevancy of Goals 2000, SCANS (U.S.\n\nDepartment of Labor SECRETARY'S COMMISSION ON ACHIEVING NECESSARY SKILLS) typology\n\nwith its profound implications for the curriculum and training changes that this will require,\" valid skills\n\nstandards and portable credentials \"benchmarked to international standards such as those promulgated by\n\nthe International Standards Organization (ISO).\" The report summary went on to say that \"there is\n\nincreasing attention being focused on developing global skill standards and accreditation agreements.\"\n\nIn the 1 990s, the Tavistock Institute not only began a new journal titled EVALUATION in 1 995, but the\n\nInstitute and the European Commission also worked on a feasibility study to research the effect of using\n\n\"Smart Cards\" in competence accreditation. The study was carried out in the U.S. and parts of Europe. The\n\nproject involved assessing and validating students' skills, with information placed on personal skills Smart\n\nCards which \"become real passports to employment.\" The implication, of course, is that without this \"real\n\npassport,\" one will not be employed.\n\nWelcome to the Tavistock psychologically conditioned feudal fascist state of the future, under the power\n\nelite's planned World Socialist Government! This will lead to what Daniel 8:23-25 foretold: \"And in the latter\n\ntime... a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up... and shall destroy\n\nthe mighty and holy people... and by peace shall destroy many....\"\n\nHow is it possible that the \"holy people\" will be destroyed? It's because today many so-called Christians\n\nare sitting on their posteriors while the \"religion\" of secular humanism has been taught in public schools for\n\nover four decades. Values are being taught in public schools based upon situation ethics without reference\n\nto God as moral authority. This is a primary tenet of secular humanism (see the first and second\n\nHUMANIST MANIFESTO), which was declared a \"religion\" by the U.S. Supreme Court in Torcaso v.\n\nWatkins (1961 ). Public school students are taught (without reference to God's moral authority) to decide for\n\nthemselves what's right or wrong based on the situation. And so-called Christians are letting this \"religion\"\n\nbe taught in public schools while the Supreme Court has banned the God of THE HOLY BIBLE as moral\n\nauthority in the same schools. Over four decades of this has produced more secular humanists than God's\n\n\"holy people,\" whose dwindling ranks will be vastly outnumbered by secular humanists who will \"destroy\"\n\nthem as a result of their \"situation.\" God, please help us!\n\nTavistock was the post WWII model for the CIA's more extensive Monarch Program, which comprises\n\nuntold millions of unconscious, programmed assets now throughout N America, Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nThe CIA has now provided us with a massive paper trail to follow an \"Enemies Domestic\" agenda via\n\nsubconscious psychological warfare in order to shape the nation. Demoralization, Crisis and Normalization.\n\nThis is the shaping process used over and over employed by both CIA and KGB. The problem is, both\n\npolitical organizations seemed to have the same agenda: groom us all away from constitutional clarity,\n\nseeking their \"protection\" as we all cower in our living rooms as mind-slaves.\n\nAccording to some reputable researchers, Sigmund Freud was Tavistock's first director, followed by his\n\nPage 10 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\ndaughter, who apparently still runs the facility. It was used to program the postwar leaders of Germany's\n\ngovernment, churches, schools, corporations, etc., from among the POWs who were easy to manipulate.\n\nLots of us who post on EW are washouts of Tavistock and Monarch programs, I suggest, including me.\n\nLawful payback is pretty refreshing after someone has tried their best to ruin our lives, I think.\n\nMost of the Tavistock facility is probably underground, so I hope someone will drop plenty of orgonite into\n\nopen pipes around that neighborhood.- — Don\n\nTavistock, England-This has been the primary programming center for England.

The Illuminati Formula Appendix I: The\n\nProgrammers\n\nBecause of the intensive artillery barrages of World War I, many soldiers were permanently impaired by\n\nshell shock. In 1 921 , the Marquees of Tavistock, 1 1 th Duke of Bedford, gave a building to a group which\n\nplanned to conduct rehabilitation programs for shell shocked British soldiers. The group took the name of\n\n\"Tavistock Institute\" after its benefactor. The General Staff of the British Army decided it was crucial that\n\nthey determine the breaking point of the soldier under combat conditions. The Tavistock Institute was\n\ntaken over by Sir John Rawlings Reese, head of the British Army Psychological Warfare Bureau. A cadre\n\nof highly trained specialists in psychological warfare was built up in total secrecy. In fifty years, the name\n\n\"Tavistock Institute’ appears only twice in the Index of the New York Times, yet this group, according to\n\nLaRouche and other authorities, organized and trained the entire staffs of the Office of Strategic Services\n\n(OSS), the Strategic Bombing Survey, Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, and\n\nother key American military groups during World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, the Tavistock Institute combined with the medical sciences division of the Rockefeller\n\nFoundation for esoteric experiments with mind-altering drugs. The present drug culture of the United\n\nStates is traced in its entirety to this Institute, which supervised the Central Intelligence Agency’s training\n\nprograms. The \"LSD counter culture\" originated when Sandoz A.G., a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned\n\nby S.G. Warburg & Co., developed a new drug from lysergic acid, called LSD. James Paul Warburg (son of\n\nPaul Warburg who had written the Federal Reserve Act in 1 91 0), financed a subsidiary of the Tavistock\n\nInstitute in the United States called the Institute for Policy Studies, whose director, Marcus Raskin, was\n\nappointed to the National Security Council. James Paul Warburg set up a CIA program to experiment with\n\nLSD on CIA agents, some of whom later committed suicide. This program, MK-Ultra, supervised by Dr.\n\nGottlieb, resulted in huge lawsuits against the United States Government by the families of the victims.\n\nPage 11 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nThe English Tavistock Institute has not restricted its activities to left-wing groups, but has also directed the\n\nprograms of such supposedly \"conservative\" American think tanks as the Herbert Hoover Institute at\n\nStanford University, Heritage Foundation, Wharton, Hudson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and\n\nRand. The \"sensitivity training\" and \"sexual encounter\" programs of the most radical California groups such\n\nas Esalen Institute and its many imitators were all developed and implemented by Tavistock Institute\n\npsychologists.\n\nOne of the rare items concerning the Tavistock Institute appears in Business Week, Oct. 26, 1 963, with a\n\nphotograph of its building in the most expensive medical offices area of London. The story mentions \"the\n\nFreudian bias\" of the Institute, and comments that it is amply financed by British blue-chip corporations,\n\nincluding Unilever, British Petroleum, and Baldwin Steel. According to Business Week, the psychological\n\ntesting programs and group relations training programs of the Institute were implemented in the United\n\nStates by the University of Michigan and the University of California, which are hotbeds of radicalism and\n\nthe drug network.\n\nIt was the Marquees of Tavistock, 1 2th Duke of Bedford, whom Rudolf Hess flew to England to contact\n\nabout ending World War II. Tavistock was said to be worth $40 million in 1 942. In 1 945, his wife committed\n\nsuicide by taking an overdose of pills. APPENDIX I [SECRETS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE By Eustace\n\nMullins]\n\nResearch into the use of microwave weapons and their use for mind control began in 1 950s at the\n\nTavistock Institute, one of Britain's leading psychiatric research establishments. The UK institute was\n\nresearching into ways of mind controlling the British population without them knowing. The monkey\n\nsubmission response, whereby the dominant monkey caused submissive behaviour in the underlings, was\n\nthe brain state of most interest to the British scientists. Having found this specific brain rhythm for docile\n\nsubmissive, zombie-like behavior, it was then recorded and used as the template for the ELF signal\n\nbeamed on UK microwave transmitters. Britain was the first discoverer of microwave technology, used for\n\nradar, in the 1940s and therefore had a commanding lead over everyone else in this field.

Up to that time, Tavistock had successfully retained its secretive role in\n\nshaping the affairs of the United States, its government and its people since its early beginning in London,\n\nin 1 91 3 at Wellington House.\n\nSince Dr. Coleman's original article exposing this ultra-secret organization, others have come forward with\n\nclaims of authorship, which they were unable to substantiate.\n\nTavistock began as a propaganda creating and disseminating organization centered at Wellington House,\n\nwhich was where the original organization was put together with intent of shaping a propaganda outlet that\n\nwould break down the stiff public resistance being encountered to the looming war between Britain and\n\nGermany.\n\nThe project was given to Lords Rothmere and Northcliffe and their mandate was to produce an\n\norganization capable of manipulating public opinion and directing that manufactured opinion down the\n\ndesired pathway to support for a declaration of war by Great Britain against Germany.\n\nFunding was provided by the British royal family, and later by the Rothschilds to whom Lord Northcliffe was\n\nrelated through marriage. Arnold Toynbee was selected as Director of Future Studies. Two Americans,\n\nWalter Lippmann and Edward Bernays were appointed to handle the manipulation of American public\n\nopinion in preparation for the entry of the United States into WWI, and to brief and direct President\n\nWoodrow Wilson.\n\nFrom a somewhat crude beginning at Wellington House, grew an organization that was to shape the\n\ndestiny of Germany, Britain and more especially the United States in manner that became a highly\n\nsophisticated organization to manipulate and create public opinion, what is commonly termed, “mass\n\nbrainwashing.” This requires the building of duplicitous mind-control devices into wrongful government for\n\nwhich the subconscious mind understands as tyranny but the conscious mind cannot articulate.\n\nDuring the course of its evolvement, Tavistock expanded in size and ambition, when in 1 937, a decision\n\nwas made to use the German author Oswald Spengler's monumental work, Untergange des Abenlandes\n\n(The Decline of Western Civilization ) as a model.\n\nPreviously, Wellington House board members Rothmere, Northcliffe, Lippmann, and Bernays had read and\n\nproposed as a guide the writings of Correa Moylan Walsh, in particular, the book The Climax of Civilization\n\n(1 917) as corresponding closely to conditions that had to be created before a New World Order in a One\n\nWorld Government could be ushered in.\n\nIn this endeavor the members of the board consulted with the British royal family and obtained the approval\n\nof the “Olympians” (the inner core of the Committee of 300) to formulate a strategy. Funding was provided\n\nby the monarchy, the Rothschilds, the Milner Group and the Rockefeller family trusts.\n\nIn 1936, Spengler's monumental work had come to the attention of what had become the Tavistock\n\nInstitute. In preparation for changing and reshaping public opinion for the second time in less than twelve\n\nPage 13 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nyears, by unanimous consent of the board, Spengler's massive book was adopted as the blueprint for a\n\nnew working model to bring about the decline and fall of Western civilization necessary to create and\n\nestablish a New World Order inside a One World Government.\n\nSpengler held it bound to happen that alien elements would be introduced into Western civilization in\n\nincreasing numbers, and that the West would fail at that time to expel the aliens, thereby sealing its fate, a\n\nsociety, whose inward beliefs and sound convictions would become at variance with its outward profession\n\nand thus Western civilization would fall by the wayside in the manner of the ancient civilizations of Greece\n\nand Rome.\n\nThe two World Wars cost the German nation almost one quarter of its population. Most of the intellectual\n\nenergies of the German nation were diverted into war channels in defense of the Fatherland at the expense\n\nof science, arts, literature, music and the cultural, spiritual and moral advancement of the nation. The same\n\ncould be said of the British nation. The blaze kindled by the British under the direction of Tavistock set all of\n\nEurope on fire, and did incalculable damage according to the Tavistock blueprint that matched Spengler's\n\npredictions.\n\nClassical and Western are the only two civilizations that could bring a modern renaissance to the world.\n\nThey had flourished and progressed just as long as these civilizations remained under the control of the\n\nAnglo-Saxon Nordic Alpine, Germanic races. The unsurpassed beauty of their literature, art, their classics,\n\nspiritual and moral advancement of the female sex with a very large corresponding degree of protection,\n\nwas what distinguished Western and Classic civilizations from others.\n\nIt was this bastion that Spengler saw coming under increasing attack and the thinking at Tavistock ran on\n\nparallel tracks, but with a totally different goal. Tavistock saw this civilization as a stumbling block to\n\nushering a New World Order, as did the emphasis on protection and elevation of the female sex to a place\n\nof high respect and honor.\n\nThus the whole thrust of Tavistock was to “democratize” the West by an attack on womanhood, and the\n\nracial, moral, spiritual and religious foundation upon which Western civilization rested.\n\nAs Spengler suggested, the Greeks and Romans were devoted to the social, religious, moral and spiritual\n\nadvancement and the preservation of womanhood and they were successful for just as long as they were\n\nin control and could arrange matters so that government was carried out by a limited number of responsible\n\ncitizens supported by the general populace below them, all being of the same pure unadulterated race. The\n\nplanners at Tavistock saw that the way to upset the balance of Western civilization was to force\n\nunwelcome changes in the race by removing control from the deserving to the undeserving in the manner\n\nof ancient Roman leaders who were supplanted by their former slaves and aliens, whom they had\n\npermitted to come and dwell among them.\n\nTavistock, by 1 937, had come a long way from its Wellington House beginnings and the successful\n\npropaganda campaign that had turned the British public from being strongly anti-war in 1 91 3 to willing\n\nparticipants through the arts of manipulation with the willing cooperation of news communications media.\n\nThe technique was carried across the Atlantic in 1 91 6 to manipulate the American people to support of the\n\nwar in Europe. In spite of the fact that the vast majority, including at least 50 U.S. Senators were adamantly\n\nopposed to the U.S. getting dragged into what they perceived was essentially a quarrel between Britain\n\nand France on the one hand, and Germany on the other, largely over trade and economics, the\n\nconspirators were undeterred. At that point Wellington House introduced the word, “Isolationists” as a\n\nderogatory description of those Americans who opposed U.S. participation in the war. The use of such\n\nPage 14 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nwords and phrases has proliferated under the expert brainwashing of the Social sciences scientists at\n\nTavistock. Terms like “regime change,” “collateral damage” became almost new English language.\n\nWith the Tavistock plan modified to suit American conditions, Bernays and Lippmann led President\n\nWoodrow Wilson to set up the very first Tavistock methodology techniques for polling (manufacturing)\n\nso-called public opinion created by Tavistock propaganda. They also taught Wilson to set up a secret body\n\nof “managers” to run the war effort and a body of “advisors” to assist the President in his decision-making.\n\nThe Creel Commission was the first such body of opinion-makers set up in the United States.\n\nWoodrow Wilson was the first American president to publicly proclaim himself in favor of a Socialist New\n\nWorld Order inside a Socialist One World Government. His remarkable acceptance of the New World\n\nOrder is found in his book The New Freedom.\n\nWe say “his” book, but actually, it was written by Socialist William B. Hayle. Wilson denounced capitalism.\n\n“It is contrary to the common man and it has brought stagnation to our economy,” Wilson wrote.\n\nYet, at the time, the United States economy was enjoying prosperity and industrial expansion as it had\n\nnever experienced before in its history:\n\n“We stand in the presence of a revolution— not a bloody revolution, America is not given to spilling\n\nblood— but a silent revolution, whereby America will insist upon recovering to practice those ideals which\n\nshe has always professed, upon securing a government devoted to the general and not the special\n\ninterests. We are upon the threshold of a time when the systematic life of the country will be sustained or at\n\nleast supplemented at every point by government activity. And now we have to determine what kind of a\n\ngovernment activity it shall be; whether, in the first place, it shall be directed from government itself, or\n\nwhether it shall be indirect, through instrumentalities which have already constituted themselves and which\n\nstand ready to supersede government.”\n\nThe United States, harried, hounded, pushed and shoved is headed on a fast track to the New World\n\nOrder, propelled along by the Radical Republicans of the War Party who have been taken over by the\n\nscientists at the Tavistock Institute for Human Relations.\n\nJust recently I was asked by a subscriber \"where do we find the Tavistock Institute?\" My response was:\n\n\"Look around the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, the White House, the State Department, the\n\nDefense Department, Wall Street, Fox T.V. (Faux T.V.) and you will see their change agents in every one of\n\nthese places.\"\n\nPresident Wilson was the first U.S. president to “manage” the war through a civilian committee guided and\n\ndirected by the Bernays and Lippmann from Wellington House, to which we have already made mention.\n\nThe resounding success of Wellington House and its enormous influence on the course of American history\n\nbegan before that in 1 913. Wilson had spent almost a year tearing down the protective trade tariffs that had\n\ndefended the American domestic markets from being overwhelmed by “Free Trade,” essentially the\n\npractice of allowing cheap British goods made with cheap labor in India to flood the American market. On\n\nOctober 1 2, 1 91 3 Wilson signed the bill that was the beginning of the end of the unique American middle\n\nclass, long the target of the Fabian Socialists. The bill was described as a measure to “adjust tariffs,” but it\n\nwould have been accurate to describe it as a bill to “destroy tariffs.”\n\nSuch was the hidden power of Wellington House that the vast majority of the American people accepted\n\nthis lie, not knowing or realizing that it was a death knell for American commerce that would lead to\n\nNAFTA, GATT and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Even more astonishing was the acceptance of\n\nPage 15 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nthe Federal Income Tax Act that was passed on September 5, 1 91 3, to replace trade tariffs as the source\n\nof revenue for the Federal Government. Income Tax is a Marxist doctrine not found in the U.S. Constitution\n\nanymore than the Federal Reserve Bank is found in the Constitution. Wilson called his twin blows against\n\nthe Constitution, “a fight for the people, and for free business,” and said he was proud to have taken “part\n\nin the completion of a great piece of business...” The Federal Reserve Act, explained by Wilson as\n\n“reconstructing the Nation's banking and currency system” was rushed through on a flood-tide of\n\npropaganda emanating from Wellington House, just in time for the hostilities that began the horror of WWI.\n\nMost historians are agreed that without passage of the Federal Reserve Bank Act, Lord Grey would not\n\nhave been able to start that terrible conflagration.\n\nThe deceptive language of the Federal Reserve Act was under the guidance of Bernays and Lippman who\n\nset up a “National Citizen's League” with the notorious Samuel Untermeyer as its chairman, to promote the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank, that secured control of the people's money and currency and transferred it to a\n\nprivate monopoly without the victim's consent.\n\nOne of the most interesting pieces of history surrounding the imposition of the foreign financial slavery\n\nmeasure was that before it was sent to Wilson for his signature, a copy was given to the sinister Colonel\n\nEdward Mandel House as the representative of Wellington House and the British oligarchy represented by\n\nthe banker, J.P. Morgan.\n\nAs to the American people, in whose name the disastrous measure was instituted, they had not the faintest\n\nidea how they had been connived, cheated, lied to and utterly deceived. An instrument of slavery was\n\nfastened around their necks without the victims ever becoming aware of it.\n\nWellington House methodology was at its height when Wilson was coached in how to persuade Congress\n\nto declare war on Germany, although he had won election on the solemn promise to keep America out of\n\nthe war then raging in Europe, a great triumph for the new art of public opinion making. It was just that - the\n\npoll questions were shaded in such away that the answers reflected the opinions of the public; not their\n\nunderstanding of the questions, nor their understanding of the processes of political science.\n\nIt is more effective to manage society by mind control than by physical coercion. The events of 9-1 1 and\n\nthe \"war on terror\" mostly are exercises in mass brainwashing. German psychiatrist Kurt Lewin, who\n\nbecame director of the elite-sponsored Tavistock Institute in 1 932, developed the thinking behind 9-1 1 . In\n\nthe book \"Mind Control World Control\" (1 997) Jim Keith writes:\n\n\"Lewin is credited with much of the original Tavistock research into mass brainwashing applying the results\n\nof repeated trauma and torture [of individuals] in mind control to society at large.\" \"If terror can be induced\n\non a widespread basis into a society, Lewin has stated, then society reverts to a tabula rasa, a blank slate,\n\na situation where control can easily be instituted from an external point.\"\n\n\"Put another way: By the creation of controlled chaos, the populace can be brought to the point where it\n\nwillingly submits to greater control. Lewin maintained that society must be driven into a state equivalent to\n\nan 'early childhood situation.' He termed this societal chaos 'fluidity.'\"\n\nElite planners designed Sept. 1 1 for its shock value. In the aftermath, they were able to impose a security\n\ncrackdown, a costly military build-up and a war in Afghanistan and Iraq on a stunned population. Keith\n\ncites another Tavistock researcher Dr. William Sargent author of \"Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of\n\nConversion and Brain-Washing\" (1957): \"Various types of beliefs can be implanted after brain function has\n\nbeen sufficiently disturbed by ...deliberately\n\nPage 16 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\ninduced fear, anger or excitement.\"\n\nThis blueprint was laid out long before Sept. 1 1 , 2001 . The official story of that\n\ntragedy doesn't bear scrutiny there was no wreckage at the Pentagon. All three buildings were demolished\n\nby explosives. Our \"leaders\" are accomplices to the murder of over 3000 Americans and the destruction of\n\nan American icon. The plan is to fold the US into a \"world government\" controlled by London-based central\n\nbankers. Our cultural, economic and political elite is complicit in the ongoing cover up. Much of this secret\n\nplanning can be found in Eugenics books coming out of England, as this science behind the Nazi\n\nmovement originated with them and is the elite's one unifying force around the world.\n\nFUTURE SHOCK\n\nMost political and cultural events are contrived by the elite for their psychological effect. JFK could have\n\nbeen disposed of in more humane ways. (He had many health problems.) Instead, for its shock value, they\n\nshot him down , in Mort Sahls' words, \"like a dog in the street.\" Jim Keith: \"The Kennedy assassination was\n\na British Intelligence, i.e. Tavistock hit, and its purpose was to shock the American consciousness into a\n\nnear-comatose state for reprogramming, the standard Tavistock modus operandi.\"\n\nThe same can be said for the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. It all climaxed\n\nwith the beatings of demonstrators at the 1 968 Chicago Democratic convention. After that, my generation\n\nturned inward as we were programmed to do. \"Turn on, Tune in, Drop Out\" said CIA funded pied piper\n\nTimothy Leary. [\"I mean who was I supposed to work for, the KGB?\" Leary quipped. (Keith p.99) Leary\n\ndidn't realize that there wasn't a big difference.]\n\nMany young people became \"dead heads\" after Jerry Garcia's Grateful Dead. Keith writes: \"An FBI internal\n\nmemo from 1 968 mentions the employment of the Grateful Dead as an avenue 'to channel youth dissent\n\nand rebellion into more benign and non-threatening directions.' [They] performed a vital service in\n\ndistracting many young persons into drugs and mysticism, rather than politics.\"\n\nKeith goes on to document CIA connections to the creation of mind control cults used to create \"controlled\n\nchaos.\" These include the Symbionese Liberation Army, Jim Jones, Charles Manson, Scientology, the\n\nUnification Church, Son of Sam and Heaven's Gate. The John Lennon assassination also ties in.\n\nTo bring the picture up to date, add the murder of Princess Diana, Columbine, the\n\nblowing of the levees in New Orleans, the burning of Black churches, and the bird flu scare. What we have\n\nis an ongoing secret war by the central bankers against society, a drumbeat of psychological torture\n\ndesigned to keep society off balance or zoned out.\n\nTHE BITTER TRUTH\n\nThe most significant thing about our life is that we are victims of elite mind control. We have been trained to\n\nbe apathetic, trivia-minded and self absorbed. Apart from the political shocks, we are hardly aware of the\n\nvicious attack on our natural heterosexuality by a psy-op known as \"feminism\" masquerading as womens\n\nrights.\n\nWe get our values, identity, meaning and love from our family roles. Women were\n\nbrainwashed to abandon the female role and compete for the male role. A woman who\n\ndedicated herself to husband, home and children was stigmatized. This is part of the\n\nPage 17 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nlong-term elite program to eliminate the institutions of marriage and family.\n\n\"Tavistock Institute has developed such power in the USA, that no one achieves\n\nprominence in any field unless he has been trained in behavioral science at Tavistock, or one of its\n\nsubsidiaries.\" Read how Tavistock directs hundreds of elite think tanks and corporations in the United\n\nStates. The degree of elite coordination is breathtaking.\n\nFor example, Century 21 has a new ad where a real estate agent is greeting a middle\n\nclass Chinese couple arriving to settle in America. The voice-over says something like: \"This is the shape\n\nof the future. We are agents of change.\"\n\nObviously this ad will not appeal to Americans looking for a realtor. Rather, it\n\nconditions them to embrace immigration. Central banker dupes and lackeys have used the term \"change\n\nagents\" to describe themselves for decades.\n\nMankind is in the grip of a satanic force and is sinking into a coma. Our \"leaders\" work for an occult cabal\n\nof super rich perverts and criminals who secretly plot the end of Western Civilization and world tyranny.\n\nThey see us as animals to be trained or culled.\n\nThe good news is that the animals \"owe\" them a lot of money for their fiat currency. So if we can tune out\n\ntheir madness, we can relax. The chaos is controlled. Wars are all orchestrated and they love money too\n\nmuch to destroy us, at least not yet. (As per Alex Jones endgame documentary, they actually plan to\n\nreduce the population by 80%.)\n\nThe Aquarian Conspiracy\n\nIn the spring of 1 980, a book appeared called The Aquarian Conspiracy that put itself forward as a\n\nmanifesto of the counterculture. Defining the counterculture as the conscious embracing of irrationality -\n\nfrom rock and drugs to biofeedback, meditation, \"consciousness-raising,\" yoga, mountain climbing, group\n\ntherapy, and psychodrama. The Aquarian Conspiracy declares that it is now time for the 15 million\n\nAmericans involved in the counterculture to join in bringing about a \"radical change in the United States.\"\n\nWrites author Marilyn Ferguson: \"While outlining a not-yet-titled book about the emerging social\n\nalternatives, I thought again about the peculiar form of this movement; its atypical leadership, the patient\n\nintensity of its adherents, their unlikely successes. It suddenly struck me that in their sharing of strategies,\n\ntheir linkage, and their recognition of each other by subtle signals, the participants were not merely\n\ncooperating with one another. They were in collusion. It - this movement - is a conspiracy!\"1\n\nFerguson used a half-truth to tell a lie. The counterculture is a conspiracy - but not in the half-conscious\n\nway Ferguson claim - as she well knows. Ferguson wrote her manifesto under the direction of Willis\n\nHarman, social policy director of the Stanford Research Institute, as a popular version of a May 1 974\n\npolicy study on how to transform the United States into Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. The\n\ncounterculture is a conspiracy at the top, created as a method of social control, used to drain the United\n\nStates of its commitment to scientific and technological progress.\n\nThat conspiracy goes back to the 1 930s, when the British sent Aldous Huxley to the United States as the\n\nPage 18 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\ncase officer for an operation to prepare the United States for the mass dissemination of drugs. We will take\n\nthis conspiracy apart step-by-step from its small beginnings with Huxley in California to the victimization of\n\n15 million Americans today. With 'The Aquarian Conspiracy', the British Opium War against the United\n\nStates has come out into the open.\n\nThe Model\n\nThe British had a precedent for the counterculture they imposed upon the United States: the pagan cult\n\nceremonies of the decadent Egyptian and Roman Empires. The following description of cult ceremonies\n\ndating back to the Egyptian Isis priesthood of the third millennium B.C. could just as well be a journalistic\n\naccount of a \"hippy be-in\" circa A.D. 1 969: \"The acts or gestures that accompany the incantations\n\nconstitute the rite [of Isis). In these dances, the beating of drums and the rhythm of music and repetitive\n\nmovements were helped by hallucinatory substances like hashish or mescal; these were consumed as\n\nadjuvants to create the trance and the hallucinations that were taken to he the visitation of the god. The\n\ndrugs were sacred, and their knowledge was limited to the initiated . . . Possibly because they have the\n\nillusion of satisfied desires, and allowed the innermost feelings to escape, these rites acquired during their\n\nexecution a frenzied character that is conspicuous in certain spells: \"Retreat! Re is piercing thy head,\n\nslashing thy face, dividing thy head, crushing it in his hands; thy bones are shattered, thy limbs are cut to\n\npieces! \"2\n\nThe counterculture that was foisted on the 1 960s adolescent youth of America is not merely analogous to\n\nthe ancient cult of Isis. It is a literal resurrection of the cult down to the popularization of the Isis cross (the\n\n\"peace symbol\") as the counterculture's most frequently used symbol.\n\nThe High Priesthood\n\nThe high priest for Britain's Opium War was Aldous Huxley, the grandson of Thomas H. Huxley, a founder\n\nof the Rhodes Roundtable group and a lifelong collaborator of Arnold Toynbee. Toynbee himself sat on the\n\nRIIA council for nearly fifty years, headed the Research Division of British intelligence throughout World\n\nWar II, and served as wartime briefing officer of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Toynbee's \"theory\" of\n\nhistory, expounded in his twenty-volume History of Western civilization, was that its determining culture has\n\nalways been the rise and decline of grand imperial dynasties. At the very point that these dynasties - the\n\n\"thousand year Reich\" of the Egyptian pharaohs, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire - succeed in\n\nimposing their rule over the entire face of the earth, they tend to decline. Toynbee argued that this decline\n\ncould be abated if the ruling oligarchy (like that of the British Roundtable) would devote itself to the\n\nrecruitment and training of an ever-expanding priesthood dedicated to the principles of imperial rule.3\n\nTrained at Toynbee's Oxford, Aldous Huxley was one of the initiates in the \"Children of the Sun,\" a\n\nDionysian cult comprised of the children of Britain's Roundtable elite.4 Among the other initiates were T.S.\n\nEliot, W.H. Auden, Sir Oswald Mosley, and D.H. Lawrence, Huxley's homosexual lover. It was Huxley,\n\nfurthermore, who would launch the legal battle in the 1 950s to have Lawrence's pornographic novel Lady\n\nChatterley's Lover allowed into the United States on the ground that it was a misunderstood \"work of art.\"5\n\nAldous Huxley, along with his brother Julian, was tutored at Oxford by H.G. Wells, the head of British\n\nforeign intelligence during World War I and the spiritual grandfather of the Aquarian Conspiracy. Ferguson\n\naccurately sees the counterculture as the realization of what Wells called The Open Conspiracy: Blue\n\nPrints for a World Revolution. The \"Open Conspiracy,\" Wells wrote, \"will appear first, I believe, as a\n\nconscious organization of intelligent and quite possibly in some cases, wealthy men, as a movement\n\nhaving distinct social and political aims, confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political\n\ncontrol, or using it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of a number of people\n\nin a certain direction who will presently discover with a sort of surprise the common object toward which\n\nPage 19 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nthey are all moving ... In all sorts of ways they will be influencing and controlling the apparatus of the\n\nostensible government.\"6\n\nWhat Ferguson left out is that Wells called his conspiracy a \"one-world brain\" which would function as \" a\n\npolice of the mind.\" Such books as the Open Conspiracy were for the priesthood itself. But Wells's popular\n\nwritings (Time Machine, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and so forth), and those of his proteges Aldous Huxley\n\n(Brave New World) and George Orwell (1 984 and Animal Farm), were written as \"mass appeal\" organizing\n\ndocuments on behalf of one-world order. Only in the United States are these \"science fiction classics\"\n\ntaught in grade school as attacks against fascism.\n\nUnder Wells's tutelage, Huxley was first introduced to Aleister Crowley. Crowley was a product of the\n\ncultist circle that developed in Britain from the 1 860s under the guiding influence of Edward Bulwer-Lytton\n\n- who, it will be recalled, was the colonial minister under Lord Palmerston during the Second Opium War.\n\nIn 1886, Crowley, William Butler Yeats, and several other Bulwer-Lytton proteges formed the Isis-Urania\n\nTemple of Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. This Isis Cult was organized around the 1 877\n\nmanuscript Isis Unveiled by Madame Helena Blavatsky, in which the Russian occultist called for the British\n\naristocracy to organize itself into an Isis priesthood. 7\n\nThe subversive Isis Urania Order of the Golden Dawn is today an international drug ring said to be\n\ncontrolled by the Canadian multi-millionaire, Maurice Strong, who is also a top operative for British\n\nIntelligence.\n\nIn 1937, Huxley was sent to the United States, where he remained throughout the period of World War II.\n\nThrough a Los Angeles contact, Jacob Zeitlin, Huxley and pederast Christopher Isherwood were employed\n\nas script writers for MGM, Warner Brothers, and Walt Disney Studios. Hollywood was already dominated\n\nby organized crime elements bankrolled and controlled through London. Joseph Kennedy was the\n\nfrontman for a British consortium that created RKO studios, and \"Bugsy\" Siegel, the West Coast boss of\n\nthe Lansky syndicate, was heavily involved in Warner Brothers and MGM.\n\nHuxley founded a nest of Isis cults in southern California and in San Francisco, that consisted exclusively\n\nof several hundred deranged worshipers of Isis and other cult gods. Isherwood, during the California\n\nperiod, translated and propagated a number of ancient Zen Buddhist documents, inspiring Zen-mystical\n\ncults along the way.8\n\nIn effect, Huxley and Isherwood (joined soon afterwards by Thomas Mann and his daughter Elisabeth\n\nMann Borghese) laid the foundations during the late 1 930s and the 1 940s for the later LSD culture, by\n\nrecruiting a core of \"initiates\" into the Isis cults that Huxley's mentors, Bulwer-Lytton, Blavatsky, and\n\nCrowley, had constituted while stationed in India.\n\nLSD: 'Visitation from the Gods'\n\n\"Ironically,\" writes Ferguson, \"the introduction of major psychedelics like LSD, in the 1960s, was largely\n\nattributable to the Central Intelligence Agency's investigation into the substances for possible military use.\n\nExperiments on more than eighty college campuses, under various CIA code names, unintentionally\n\npopularized LSD. Thousands of graduate students served as guinea pigs. Soon they were synthesizing\n\ntheir own 'acid.' \"9\n\nThe CIA operation was code named MK-Ultra, its result was not unintentional, and it began in 1 952, the\n\nyear Aldous Huxley returned to the United States.\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, was developed in 1943 by Albert Hoffman, a chemist at Sandoz A.B. -\n\nPage 20 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\na Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg. While precise documentation is unavailable as to\n\nthe auspices under which the LSD research was commissioned, it can be safely assumed that British\n\nintelligence and its subsidiary U.S. Office of Strategic Services were directly involved. Allen Dulles, the\n\ndirector of the CIA when that agency began MK-Ultra, was the OSS station chief in Berne, Switzerland\n\nthroughout the early Sandoz research. One of his OSS assistants was James Warburg, of the same\n\nWarburg family, who was instrumental in the 1963 founding of the Institute for Policy Studies, and worked\n\nwith both Huxley and Robert Hutchins.\"10\n\nAldous Huxley returned to the United States from Britain, accompanied by Dr. Humphrey Osmond, the\n\nHuxleys' private physician. Osmond had been part of a discussion group Huxley had organized at the\n\nNational Hospital, Queens Square, London. Along with another seminar participant, J.R. Smythies,\n\nOsmond wrote Schizophrenia: A New Approach, in which he asserted that mescaline -- a derivative of the\n\nmescal cactus used in ancient Egyptian and Indian pagan rites -- produced a psychotic state identical in all\n\nclinical respects to schizophrenia. On this basis, Osmond and Smythies advocated experimentation with\n\nhallucinogenic drugs as a means of developing a \"cure\" for mental disorders.\n\nOsmond was brought in by Allen Dulles to play a prominent role in MK-Ultra. At the same time, Osmond,\n\nHuxley, and the University of Chicago's Robert Hutchins held a series of secret planning sessions in 1952\n\nand 1 953 for a second, private LSD mescaline project under Ford Foundation funding. 1 1 Hutchins, it will\n\nbe recalled, was the program director of the Ford Foundation during this period. His LSD proposal incited\n\nsuch rage in Henry Ford II that Hutchins was fired from the foundation the following year.\n\nIt was also in 1 953 that Osmund gave Huxley a supply of mescaline for his personal consumption. The next\n\nyear, Huxley wrote The Doors of Perception, the first manifesto of the psychedelic drug cult, which claimed\n\nthat hallucinogenic drugs \"expand consciousness.\" Although the Ford Foundation rejected the\n\nHutchins-Huxley proposal for private foundation sponsorship of LSD, the proposal was not dropped.\n\nBeginning in 1 962, the Rand Corporation of Santa Monica, California began a four-year experiment in\n\nLSD, peyote, and marijuana. The Rand Corporation was established simultaneously with the\n\nreorganization of the Ford Foundation during 1 949. Rand was an outgrowth of the wartime Strategic\n\nBombing Survey, a \"cost analysis\" study of the psychological effects of the bombings of German population\n\ncenters.\n\nAccording to a 1 962 Rand Abstract, W.H. McGlothlin conducted a preparatory study on \"The Long-Lasting\n\nEffects of LSD on Certain Attitudes in Normals: An Experimental Proposal.\" The following year, McGlothlin\n\nconducted a year-long experiment on thirty human guinea pigs, called \"Short-Term Effects of LSD on\n\nAnxiety, Attitudes and Performance.\" The study concluded that LSD improved emotional attitudes and\n\nresolved anxiety problems. 12\n\nHuxley At Work Huxley expanded his own LSD-mescaline project in California by recruiting several\n\nindividuals who had been initially drawn into the cult circles he helped establish during his earlier stay. The\n\ntwo most prominent individuals were Alan Watts and the late Dr. Gregory Bateson (the former husband of\n\nDame Margaret Mead). Watts became a self-styled \"guru\" of a nationwide Zen Buddhist cult built around\n\nhis well-publicized books. Bateson, an anthropologist with the OSS, became the director of a\n\nhallucinogenic drug experimental clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital. Under Bateson's\n\nauspices, the initiating \"cadre\" of the LSD cult - the hippies - were programmed. 13\n\nWatts at the same time founded the Pacifica Foundation, which sponsored two radio station WKBW in San\n\nFrancisco and WBM-FM in New York City. The Pacifica stations were among the first to push the\n\n\"Liverpool Sound\" - the British-imported hard rock twanging of the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the\n\nAnimals. They would later pioneer \"acid rock\" and eventually the self-avowed psychotic \"punk rock.\"\n\nPage 21 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nDuring the fall of 1 960, Huxley was appointed visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of\n\nTechnology in Boston. Around his stay in that city, Huxley created a circle at Harvard parallel to his West\n\nCoast LSD team. The Harvard group included Huxley, Osmund, and Watts (brought in from California),\n\nTimothy Leary, and Richard Alpert.\n\nThe ostensible topic of the Harvard seminar was \"Religion and its Significance in the Modern Age.\" The\n\nseminar was actually a planning session for the \"acid rock\" counterculture. Huxley established contact\n\nduring this Harvard period with the president of Sandoz, which at the time was working on a CIA contract\n\nto produce large quantities of LSD and psilocybin (another synthetic hallucinogenic drug) for MK-Ultra, the\n\nCIA's official chemical warfare experiment. According to recently released CIA documents, Allen Dulles\n\npurchased over 1 00 million doses of LSD -- almost all of which flooded the streets of the United States\n\nduring the late 1960s. During the same period, Leary began privately purchasing large quantities of LSD\n\nfrom Sandoz as well. 14\n\nFrom the discussions of the Harvard seminar, Leary put together the book The Psychedelic Experience,\n\nbased on the ancient cultist Tibetan Book of the Dead. It was this book that popularized Osmund's\n\npreviously coined term, \"psychedelic mind-expanding.\"\n\nThe Roots of the Flower People\n\nBack in California, Gregory Bateson had maintained the Huxley operation out of the Palo Alto VA hospital.\n\nThrough LSD experimentation on patients already hospitalized for psychological problems, Bateson\n\nestablished a core of \"initiates\" into the \"psychedelic\" Isis Cult.\n\nForemost among his Palo Alto recruits was Ken Kesey. In 1 959, Bateson administered the first dose of \"SD\n\nto Kesey. By 1 962, Kesey had completed a novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which popularized\n\nthe notion that society is a prison and the only truly \"free\" people are the insane. 1 5\n\nKesey subsequently organized a circle of \"SD initiates called \"The Merry Pranksters.\" They toured the\n\ncountry disseminating SD\" (often without forewarning the receiving parties), building up local distribution\n\nconnections, and establishing the pretext for a high volume of publicity on behalf of the still minuscule\n\n\"counterculture.\"\n\nBy 1 967, the Kesey cult had handed out such quantities of \"SD that a sizable drug population had\n\nemerged, centered in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Here Huxley collaborator Bateson set\n\nup a \"free clinic,\" staffed by **Dr. David Smith - later a \"medical adviser\" for the National Organization for\n\nthe Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML); **Dr. Ernest Dernberg an active-duty military officer, probably on\n\nassignment through MK-Ultra; **Roger Smith-a street gang organizer trained by Saul Alinsky. During the\n\nFree Clinic period, Roger Smith was the parole officer of the cultist mass murderer Charles Manson; **Dr.\n\nPeter Bourne - formerly President Carter's special assistant on drug abuse. Bourne did his psychiatric\n\nresidency at the Clinic. He had previously conducted a profiling study of Gl heroin addicts in Vietnam.\n\nThe Free Clinic paralleled a project at the Tavistock Institute, the psychological warfare agency for the\n\nBritish Secret Intelligence Service. Tavistock, founded as a clinic in London in the 1 920s, had become the\n\nPsychiatric Division of the British Army during World War II under its director, Dr. John Rawlings Rees. 1 6\n\nDuring the 1 960s, the Tavistock Clinic fostered the notion that no criteria for sanity exist and that\n\npsychedelic \"mind-expanding\" drugs are valuable tools of psychoanalysis. In 1967, Tavistock sponsored a\n\nConference on the \"Dialectics of Liberation,\" chaired by Tavistock psychoanalyst Dr. R.D. Laing, himself a\n\nPage 22 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\npopularized author and advocate of drug use. That conference drew a number of people who would soon\n\nplay a prominent role in fostering terrorism; Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael were two prominent\n\nAmerican delegates.\n\nThus, by 1 963, Huxley had recruited his core of \"initiates.\" All of them -- Leary, Osmund, Watts, Kesey,\n\nAlpert -- became the highly publicized promoters of the early LSD counterculture. By 1 967, with the cult of\n\n\"Flower People\" in Haight-Ashbury and the emergence of the antiwar movement, the United States was\n\nready for the inundation of LSD, hashish and marijuana that hit American college campuses in the late\n\n1960s.\n\n'The Beating of Drums . . .'\n\nIn 1963, the Beatles arrived in the United States, and with their decisive airing on the Ed Sullivan Show,\n\nthe \"British sound\" took off in the U.S.A. For their achievement, the four rocksters were awarded the Order\n\nof the British Empire by Her Majesty the Queen. The Beatles and the Animals, Rolling Stones, and\n\nhomicidal punk rock maniacs who followed were, of course, no more a spontaneous outpouring of\n\nalienated youth than was the acid culture they accompanied.\n\nThe social theory of rock was elaborated by musicologist Theodor Adorno, who came to the United States\n\nin 1939 to head the Princeton University Radio Research Project.17 Adorno writes: \"In an imaginary but\n\npsychologically emotion-laden domain, the listener who remembers a hit song will turn into the song's ideal\n\nsubject, into the person for whom the song ideally speaks. At the same time, as one of many who identify\n\nwith that fictitious subject, that musical I, he will feel his isolation ease as he himself feels integrated into\n\nthe community of \"fans.\" In whistling such a song he bows to a ritual of socialization, although beyond this\n\nunarticulated subjective stirring of the moment his isolation continues unchanged . . . The comparison with\n\naddiction is inescapable. Addicted conduct generally has a social component: it is one possible reaction to\n\nthe atomization which, as sociologists have noticed, parallels the compression of the social network.\n\nAddiction to music on the part of a number of entertainment listeners would be a similar phenomenon.\"1 8\n\nThe hit parade is organized precisely on the same principles used by Egypt's Isis priesthood and for the\n\nsame purpose: the recruitment of youth to the dionysiac counterculture.\n\nIn a report prepared for the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, Paul Hirsch described\n\nthe product of Adorno's Radio Research Project. 1 9 According to Hirsch, the establishment of postwar\n\nradio's Hit Parade \"transformed the mass medium into an agency of sub-cultural programming. Radio\n\nnetworks were converted into round-the-clock recycling machines that repeated the top forty hits.\" Hirsch\n\ndocuments how all popular culture - movies, music, books, and fashion - is now run on the same program\n\nof preselection. Today's mass culture operates like the opium trade: The supply determines the demand.\n\nThe Vietnam War and the Anti-Vietnam War Trap\n\nBut without the Vietnam War and the \"anti-war\" movement, the Isis cult would have been contained to a\n\nfringe phenomenon - no bigger than the beatnik cult of the 1 950s that was an outgrowth of the early\n\nHuxley ventures in California. The Vietnam War created the climate of moral despair that opened\n\nAmerica's youth to drugs.\n\nUnder Kennedy, American military involvement in Vietnam - which had been vetoed by the Eisenhower\n\nadministration - was initiated on a limited scale. Under Lyndon Johnson, American military presence in\n\nVietnam was massively escalated, at the same time that U.S. efforts were restricted - the framework of\n\n\"limited war.\" Playing on the President's profile, the anglophile Eastern Establishment, typified by top White\n\nHouse national security aide McGeorge Bundy and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, convinced\n\nPage 23 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nPresident Johnson that under the nuclear \"balance of terror,\" or the regime of Mutual and Assured\n\nDestruction, the United States could afford neither a political solution to the conflict, nor the commitment to\n\na military victory.\n\nThe outcome of this debacle was a major strategic withdrawal from Asia by the United States, spelled out\n\nin Henry Kissinger's \"Guam Doctrine,\" adoption of the spectacular failure known as the \"China Card\"\n\nstrategy for containing Soviet influence, and demoralization of the American people over the war to the\n\npoint that the sense of national pride and confidence in the future progress of the republic was badly\n\ndamaged.\n\nJust as Aldous Huxley began the counterculture subversion of the United States thirty years before its\n\nconsequences became evident to the public, Lord Bertrand Russell began laying the foundations for the\n\nanti-war movement of the 1 960s before the 1 930s expired. Russell's \"pacifism\" was always relative - the\n\nmeans to his most cherished end, one-world government on the imperial model, that would curb the\n\nnation-state and its persistent tendency toward republicanism and technological progress.\n\nLord Russell and Aldous Huxley cofounded the Peace Pledge Union in 1937 campaigning for peace with\n\nHitler-just before both went to the United States for the duration of World War.20 During World War II, Lord\n\nRussell opposed British and American warfare against the Nazis. 1111 947, when the United States was in\n\npossession of the atomic bomb and Russia was not, Russell loudly advocated that the United States order\n\nthe Soviets to surrender to a one-world government that would enjoy a restrictive monopoly on nuclear\n\nweapons, under the threat of a preemptive World War III against the Soviet Union. His 1950s \"Ban the\n\nBomb\" movement was directed to the same end-it functioned as an anti-technology movement against the\n\npeace-through-economic development potentials represented by President Eisenhower's \"Atoms for\n\nPeace'\" initiative.\n\nFrom the mid-1 950s onward, Russell's principal assignment was to build an international anti-war and\n\nanti-American movement. Coincident with the escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam under British\n\nmanipulation, Russell upgraded the old Peace Pledge Union (which had been used in West Germany\n\nthroughout the postwar period to promote an anti-capitalist \"New left\" wing of the Social Democratic Party,\n\nrecruiting several future members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang in the process) into the Bertrand\n\nRussell Peace Foundation.\n\nIn the United States, the New York banks provided several hundred thousand dollars to establish the\n\nInstitute for Policy Studies (IPS), effectively the U.S. branch of the Russell Peace Foundation. Among the\n\nfounding trustees of the IPS was James Warburg, directly representing the family's interests.\n\nIPS drew its most active operatives from a variety of British-dominated institutions. IPS founding director\n\nMarcus Raskin was a member of the Kennedy administration's National Security Council and also a fellow\n\nof the National Training Labs, a U.S. subsidiary of the Tavistock Institute founded by Dr. Kurt Lewin.\n\nAfter its creation by the League for Industrial Democracy, Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the\n\numbrella of the student anti-war movement, was in turn financed and run through IPS -- up through and\n\nbeyond its splintering into a number of terrorist and Maoist gangs in the late 1 960s.21 More broadly, the\n\ninstitutions and outlook of the U.S. anti-war movement were dominated by the direct political descendants\n\nof the British-dominated \"socialist movement\" in the U.S.A., fostered by the House of Morgan as far back\n\nas the years before World War!.\n\nThis is not to say that the majority of anti-war protesters were paid, certified British agents. On the contrary,\n\nthe overwhelming majority of anti-war protesters went into SDS on the basis of outrage at the\n\ndevelopments in Vietnam. But once caught in the environment defined by Russell and the Tavistock\n\nPage 24 of 52\n\nSep 12, 2016 09:10:04PM MDT\n\nhttp://robertscourt.blogspot.com/ 2008 / 06 /are-republicans-next-nazi-party-see.html\n\nInstitute's psychological warfare experts, and inundated with the message that hedonistic pleasure-seeking\n\nwas a legitimate alternative to \"immoral war,\" their sense of values and their creative potential went up in a\n\ncloud of hashish smoke.\n\n'Changing Images'\n\nNow, fifteen years later, with nearly an entire generation of American youth submerged in the drugs that\n\nflooded the nation's campuses, the Aquarian Conspiracy's Marilyn Ferguson is able to write: \"There are\n\nlegions of [Aqua"
