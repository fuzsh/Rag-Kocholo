        "text": "The Sequoia Seminars - A History\n\nKibitz: One of the original questions : What was Willis Harman so excited about at the Sequoia Seminars in 1954?\n\nWhat was Stolaroff so excited about? Well it turns out that they were excited about Gerald Heard.\n\n....\n\n1954 Gerald Heard gives a lecture to the Sequoia Seminar about mind expansion and describes the effects of certain mind-altering drugs - Myron Stolaroff and Willis Harman attending, Then in 1956 that Heard tells Stolaroff about LSD and directs him to Al Hubbard for a visit to Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver...\n\nThis thread is an investigation into the history of \"The Sequoia Seminars\" which began in the early 1950's around Stanford University and later went on to investigate the concepts of \"LSD Therapy\". This all started with a confusion over \"The Secora Seminars\" which turned out to be \"The Sequoia Seminars\" and a Willis Harmon was also referenced as Willis Harman ...\n\nAlso I had found that between 1953 and 1954 a discovery had been made for the large scale production of LSD and I was looking for government programs related to this discovery (Chatter - Artichoke):\n\nhttp://www.naderlibrary.com/aciddreams.refer.htm\n\n...\n\n\"for eliciting true and accurate statements\" D (CIA) \"Potential New Agent for Unconventional Warfare, LSD,\" 5 August 1954.\n\n\"will most probably be found in the biochemistry departments\" D (CIA) untitled cable, 26 May 1954. the purchase of ten kilos of LSD D (CIA) Memorandum to Chief of Security Research Staff, from Chief of Technical Branch, \" ARTICHOKE Conference, 22 October 1953,\" 16 November 1953\n\n\"This is a closely guarded secret\" D (CIA) Memorandum to Director of Central Intelligence via Deputy Director of Plans,\n\n\"Potential Large-Scale Availability of LSD through Newly-Discovered Synthesis by [deleted],\" 26 October 1954.\n\nhttp://scientific-misconduct.blogspot.com/2008/05/quiz-question-who-produced-lsd-for-cia.html\n\nQuiz question - Who produced LSD for the CIA and MK-ULTRA in 1954?\n\nIn fact CIA documents show that a U.S. source for LSD supply was desired. In 1953 the CIA provided Eli Lilly with funding to attempt synthesis of LSD for CIA use without the need for the expensive and scarce reagents required by Sandoz. A year later, Lilly chemists succeeded in their quest, and subsequent supplies were from Lilly[1,2]. Another more potent chemical used by MK-Ultra, BZ (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate), was produced by Hoffman-La Roche.\n\nhttp://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/index/LSD_turns_60.html?cid=3267632\n\nFrom 1947 to 1966, Sandoz produced and sold LSD tablets and the drug became popular, especially in the United States.\n\nthe SanDoz patent for LSD ran out in 1963.\n\n------\n\nAlthough the Eli Lilly process was published (somewhere) certain details were left out....\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/brotherhood_of_eternal_love.pdf\n\n...\n\nOne objective was to keep any further LSD out of the hands of the West's enemies; another was to find out as much as possible about the drug; and the third was to experiment with LSD as a weapon in warfare and espionage.\n\n...\n\nBack home in the United States, the Eli Lilly company in Indianapolis established a new process for LSD which meant that the drug could now be mass-produced. The CIA agent who reported this development to his superiors noted that the military services had access to a home supply of LSD by the ton. Eli Lilly kept details of the full process confidential and made up a special batch of LSD for the CIA.\n\n...\n\nPoint Richmond was the prototypical underground laboratory.\n\nOwsley, Scully and Melissa Cargill moved there early in the summer of 1966.\n\n...\n\nOwsley was still working on the basis of a formula for LSDthe formula released by Eli Lilly in the 1950s which left out key details on purification and prevention of decay for commercial rather than security reasons. Point Richmond became a proving ground for filling in some of those blanks. Owsley had got as far as crystal LSD, which in itself required a reasonable level of purity; but he believed that if he could achieve absolute purity, then the LSD would be extra special with extra special results. Between them Owsley and Scully created 20 to 30 grams of what they thought was the purest LSD anyone had yet produced. The crystal lost its yellowish tinge and became almost blue-white under the fluorescent lamp. It was pure enough to be pizioluminescentif the crystals were shaken or crushed, they gave off flashes of light. (LSD is one of a very small group of compounds with this property.)\n\n| ---------\n\nI need to start somewhere so here is goes (I'll re-edit this post till it looks clean)....\n\nSecora Seminar - 1954 - Need help with more information\n\nAnyone have any more info on the \"Secora Seminar\" or related history? Thanks in advance.\n\nTavistock - Systems Psychodynamics - mass brain-washing techniques\n\nhttp://www.dprogram.com/willis_harmanp1.html\n\nGlobal Mind Change\n\nHow did your own interest in the subject of consciousness start? Was it an early passion?\n\nWillis Harman:\n\nNo, I was trained as a scientist, thought I was going to be a chemist for a while, ended up as an electrical engineer and then systems engineer. And then in 1954 at age 36 I had an up-ending experience that I hadn't asked for and the net result was my path through life took a sudden swerve. It was a two-week seminar which, there was nothing like it at the time although later on there were things like Est and Silva Mind Control and all kinds of things, but at that time, it was a fairly intensive seminar and I only came into it because I didn't realise that. I was tricked into coming into it, thinking it was going to be a nice, safe intellectual discussion.\n\nWhat was the seminar, specifically?\n\nWillis Harman:\n\nIt was called The Secora [Sequoia] Seminar. The same group became Beyond War, they still exist, I think. It became apparent to me through that experience that I had feelings that I was not even aware of, you know my unconscious mind. Its rather hard to explain how an experience suddenly opens you up. It's not exactly a rational, linear process. At any rate I just started to search around for whoever knew something about any part of this.\n\nI made one trip to Europe and got aquainted with The Society for Psychical Research, that was back in the days of Sir George Joy and Rosalyn Heywood. Celia Green was just a youngster coming in at that time. So in the next half dozen years or so I got somewhat involved in psychical research and somewhat involved in the psychedelic research. That sort of blew up in a way in the 1960's! So I shifted over to doing research on the future.\n\nThe \"1954 Secora\" seminars were \"The Sequoia Seminars\"\n\nI have now determined that the \"1954 Secora\" seminars were \"The Sequoia Seminars\"\n\nWe have a nexus of SRI - RAND - Tavistock - Music via AMPEX - Myron Stolaroff - Merry Pranksters Kesey - and more ....\n\nAlso goes back to 1947 - mescaline experiments University Vancouver - Jolly West Project Chatter\n\nwhich is also project paperclip via Mescaline experiments that were performed at Dachua\n\nSome preliminary links:\n\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=mescaline+experiments+University+Vancouver+1947+chatter&btnG=Search&aq=f&oq=&aqi=\n\nIt still exists (no mention of the historical LSD \"therapy\" sessions in 1954):\n\nThe Sequoia Retreat Center of Northern California\n\n....\n\nOther special weekends have featured Dr. Willis Harman, co-founder of the World Business Academy and President of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, Dr. Elisabet Sahtouris, scientist and author, Helen Palmer, psychologist and author, and Brian Swimme, physicist, teacher and author.\n\nBeyond War's successor organization, the Foundation for Global Community is active and can be found at http://www.globalcommunity.org/. Sequoia Seminar was purchased by the Hendricks family in 2005. After much renovation and capital improvements, they have passed stewardship to us.\n\nThe Sequoia Retreat Center stands on the shoulders of peace makers, reconciliation makers, stewards of the land and Sequoias. Our roots are in the people who have created extraordinary lives. We honor and extend that work by holding this space open.\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/eisner_betty/remembrances_lsd_therapy.pdf\n\nhttp://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft1870045n&chunk.id=d0e1544&doc.view=print\n\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/20565623/storming-heaven-american-dream\n\n...\n\nTo give another illustration of how things were developing: in 1954 Gerald Heard gave a lecture in Palo Alto to an organization called the Sequoia Seminar. Sitting in the audience was an engineer named Myron Stolaroff. Stolaroff was in charge of long-range planning at\n\nAmpex, which was one of the first of the high-technology companies to emerge in the valleys south of San Francisco. Stolaroff had heard Gerald speak several times before and considered him one of the world's outstanding mystics. So when Heard began rhapsodizing\n\nabout the effects of certain mind-altering drugs, Stolaroff was predictably upset. \"I thought you went to all these places anyway,\" he asked. \"Why do you take this?\" And Heard had replied, \"Oh, but it just opens the doors in so many ways to so many vast dimensions.\"19\n\nWhether he admitted it to himself or not, Myron Stolaroff was hooked, and a few months later, in Los Angeles on business, he visited Heard and had another long discussion about these new mind drugs. At one point Hubbard's name had come up, and Heard had implied\n\nthat if Stolaroff wished to try any of these substances, Al was the man to guide him through the experience. So Stolaroff had written Hubbard and one day Al had turned up on the doorstep, bounding into Myron's office with a tank of carbogen, a \"fun-loving guy\" who \"radiated an enormous energy field.\"20 After the formal introductions were over, Hubbard had suggested that Stolaroff take a few lungfuls of the carbogen, and twenty or thirty breaths later the director of long-range planning was abreacting all over his office.\n\nStolaroff, who had been skeptical of a lot of Gerald's claims, was convinced. He arranged to visit Vancouver at the earliest opportunity for one of Hubbard's patented LSD sessionsby 1959 Hubbard was claiming he had conducted seventeen hundred LSD sessions.\n\nIt was a terrible experience. During those hours in Hubbard's apartment, Stolaroff relived his birth, the actual physical birth, gasping and writhing for what felt like days, until he broke through to the world, which actually smelled of ether. Although it was a torturous few\n\nhours, Myron emerged from the LSD womb convinced that many of his personal eccentricities and neuroses could be traced back to the trauma of his birth. This was not a radical possibility as far as psychoanalysis was concerned; Otto Rank, one of Freud's last\n\ndisciples, had explored the effects of birth on the emerging psyche in numerous articles. But it would have taken psychoanalysis years to attain the level that LSD had reached in one climactic rush. Stolaroff returned to Ampex convinced that LSD \"was the greatest discovery\n\nthat man had ever made.\"21\n\n...\n\nMyron Stolaroff was a good example. Stolaroff had been in charge of long-range planning at Ampex, one of the first of the big electronics firms to settle south of the Bay Area, when he had been bitten by the psychedelic bug. Together with Hubbard he had tried to interest Ampex's management in a program that would use LSD to solve all kinds of corporate problems, interpersonal problems, design problems, long-range planning problems. But the plan had foundered on Al's penchant for Christian mysticism. Stolaroff didn't let go, though: he started holding weekly LSD sessions for some of Ampex's more adventurous engineers;\n\nHubbard came down from Canada one weekend and took them all to a remote cabin in the Sierras where he guided them through the kind of ontological earthquake only Al could manufacture. The senior management of Ampex had been horrified. Having gotten to know\n\nHubbard through rather extraordinary circumstances, it didn't seem at all irrational for them to be worrying, \"What if this nutball drives our best men crazy?\" So there had been sighs of relief when Stolaroff decided to leave Ampex and set up his own nonprofit psychedelic\n\nresearch center in Menlo Park, Californiathe International Foundation for Advanced Study. The Foundation, which opened in March 1961, wasn't the only organization working with LSD in the San Francisco area.\n\nThe Palo Alto Mental Research Institute had been studying the drug since 1958, and had been instrumental in introducing dozens of local psychiatrists and psychologists, as well as interested laymen like Allen Ginsberg, to the perplexities of the Other World. But the Institute's composure had been shaken by several terrifying incidentscolossal bad trips in which the subject returned from the Other World in questionable shapeand interest in LSD's therapeutic potential had diminished. LSD programs were also under way at the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, the San Mateo County Hospital, and Napa State Hospital, but no one was offering psychedelic therapy, and what little research was being done was unexciting: Leo Hollister (who will soon reappear in association with a hopeful young writer named Ken Kesey), at the Veterans Hospital, was still doing model psychoses work.\n\nThe point was that most LSD researchers were fairly conservative. So when a couple of engineers set up shop (Stolaroff's vice president, Willis Harman, had been an engineering professor at Stanford) and began poaching bread and butter patientsunlike Osmond and Hotter, Stolaroff wasn't just concentrating on chronic alcoholics, he was soliciting the man off the street, who in this case was the neurotic professional in the high tech-high education hub that surrounded Stanfordthere were more than raised eyebrows. Charging five hundred dollars for one session with a highly questionable drug? The whole thing smacked of chicanery, despite the fact that Stolaroff had a licensed psychiatrist running the actual therapy sessions. But what was worse, it was chicanery with good word of mouth. The San Mateo Call Bulletin, scenting a medical scandal, had interviewed a number of Stolaroff's patients and found them laudatory to the point of hyperbole. At the Foundation's first and last open house, Stolaroff had been cornered by a disgruntled therapist who growled, \"One of my ex-patients thinks you're a saint making it clear that he thought Stolaroff was a charlatan.14 What was one to make, after all, of the Call Bulletin's statement that the Foundation's aims were \"partly medical, partly scientific, partly philosophical, partly mystical\"?15 The first two, okay, but philosophy was for philosophers, and mysticism? mysticism was for cranks!\n\nhttp://fileshare200.depositfiles.com/auth-1252948980c9064f26db53789dde2968-66.249.71.8-613571625-19999864-guest/FS200-17/Markoff,_John_-_What_the_Dormouse_Said._How_the_60s_Counterculture_Shaped_the_PC_Industry.pdf\n\nFor the unrepentant patriarch of LSD, long, strange trip winds back to Bay Area\n\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/12/MNGK0QV7HS1.DTL\n\nhttp://mindcontrolforums.com/acid-dreams-cia.htm\n\n| -------------------\n\nThe people involved are connected to Tavistock - RAND - SRI - AMPEX and the CIA.\n\nSome of the Players:\n\nArthur Balfour [Rhodes Round Table], one of the Prime Ministers of England, was a member of the Society for Psychical Research\n\nhttp://www.spr.ac.uk/expcms/index.php?section=1\n\nWelcome to the Website of the Society for Psychical Research\n\nThe SPR was the first organisation established to examine allegedly paranormal phenomena using scientific principles.

Seminars were held at Asilomar and other locations. By the 1940's it was clear that a permanent facility was needed. Early meetings were held in a cottage and participants stayed in tents during the two and three week summer seminars. *[Harry's Last Lecture: click here]\n\nSequoia Seminar was incorporated in 1949 and the building of the lodges and cabins you will find here today began. The first lodge was built on land at the Quaker Center in Ben Lomond. Here the tradition of working together was begun and the goal of blending buildings with the land was met in \"Casa de Luz\", House of Light. This first lodge was given to the Quaker Center in 1973.\n\n...\n\nOther special weekends have featured Dr. Willis Harman, co-founder of the World Business Academy and President of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, Dr. Elisabet Sahtouris, scientist and author, Helen Palmer, psychologist and author, and Brian Swimme, physicist, teacher and author.\n\n| -------------------------\n\nAnother Player: Sieigfried Linkwitz\n\nhttp://www.linkwitzlab.com/about_me.htm\n\nWork / Fun Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto and Santa Rosa, California, '61-'98\n\n(R&D Design Engineer, Project Mgr., Section Mgr., Senior Engineer)\n\nSiemens, Zentrallabor, Muenchen, Germany, '61\n\nTelefunken, Hannover, Germany, '57\n\nEducation Ongoing ...\n\nStanford University, EE, '62-'64\n\nTH Darmstadt, Germany, Dipl.

Hubbard\n\nhttp://old.disinfo.com/archive/pages/article/id1284/pg1/index.html\n\nYou will not read about him in the history books. He left no diary, nor chatty relatives to memorialize him in print. And if a cadre of associates had not recently agreed to open its files, Captain Alfred M. Hubbard might exist in death as he did in life--a man of mirrors and shadows, revealing himself to even his closest friends only on a need-to-know basis.\n\nThey called him \"the Johnny Appleseed of LSD.\" He was to the psychedelic movement nothing less than the membrane through which all passed to enter into the Mysteries. Beverly Hills psychiatrist Oscar Janiger once said of Hubbard, \"We waited for him like a little old lady for the Sears-Roebuck catalog.\" Waited for him to unlock his ever-present leather satchel loaded with pharmaceutically-pure psilocybin, mescaline or his personal favorite, Sandoz LSD-25.\n\nThose who will talk about Al Hubbard are few. Oscar Janiger told this writer that \"nothing of substance has been written about Al Hubbard, and probably nothing ever should.\"\n\nHe is treated like a demigod by some, as a lunatic uncle by others. But nobody is ambivalent about the Captain: He was as brilliant as the noonday sun, mysterious as the rarest virus, and friendly like a golden retriever.\n\nThe first visage of Hubbard was beheld by Dr. Humphry Osmond, now senior psychiatrist at Alabama's Bryce Hospital. He and Dr. John Smythies were researching the correlation between schizophrenia and the hallucinogens mescaline and adrenochrome at Weyburn Hospital in Saskatchewan, Canada, when an A.M. Hubbard requested the pleasure of Osmond's company for lunch at the swank Vancouver Yacht Club. Dr. Osmond later recalled, \"It was a very dignified place, and I was rather awed by it. [Hubbard] was a powerfully-built man . . . with a broad face and a firm hand-grip. He was also very genial, an excellent host.\"\n\nCaptain Hubbard was interested in obtaining some mescaline, and, as it was still legal, Dr. Osmond supplied him with some. \"He was interested in all sorts of odd things,\" Osmond laughs. Among Hubbard's passions was motion. His identity as \"captain\" came from his master of sea vessels certification and a stint in the US Merchant Marine.\n\nAt the time of their meeting in 1953, Al Hubbard owned secluded Daymen Island off the coast of Vancouver--a former Indian colony surrounded by a huge wall of oyster shells. To access his 24-acre estate, Hubbard built a hangar for his aircraft and a slip for his yacht from a fallen redwood. But it was the inner voyage that drove the Captain until his death in 1982. Fueled by psychedelics, he set sail and rode the great wave as a neuronaut, with only the white noise in his ears and a fever in his brain.\n\nHis head shorn to a crew and wearing a paramilitary uniform with a holstered long-barrel Colt .45, Captain Al Hubbard showed up one day in '63 on the doorstep of a young Harvard psychologist named Timothy Leary.\n\n\"He blew in with that uniform . . . laying down the most incredible atmosphere of mystery and flamboyance, and really impressive bullshit!\" Leary recalls. \"He was pissed off. His Rolls Royce had broken down on the freeway, so he went to a pay phone and called the company in London. That's what kind of guy he was. He started name-dropping like you wouldn't believe . . . claimed he was friends with the Pope.\"\n\nThose who knew Al Hubbard would describe him as just a \"barefoot boy from Kentucky,\" who never got past third grade. But as a young man, the shoeless hillbilly was purportedly visited by a pair of angels, who told him to build something. He had absolutely no training, \"but he had these visions, and he learned to trust them early on,\" says Willis Harman, director of the Institute of Noetic Sciences in Sausalito, CA.\n\nhttp://www.fargonebooks.com/high.html\n\n...\n\nHis [Hubbard's] services were eventually recruited by Willis Harman, then-Director of the Educational Policy Research Center within the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) of Stanford University. Harman employed Hubbard as a security guard for SRI, \"although,\" Harman admits, \"Al never did anything resembling security work.\"\n\nHubbard was specifically assigned to the Alternative Futures Project, which performed future-oriented strategic planning for corporations and government agencies. Harman and Hubbard shared a goal \"to provide the [LSD] experience to political and intellectual leaders around the world.\" Harman acknowledges that \"Al's job was to run the special [LSD] sessions for us.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Abram Hoffer, \"Al had a grandiose idea that if he could give the psychedelic experience to the major executives of the Fortune 500 companies, he would change the whole of society.\"\n\nHubbard's tenure at SRI was uneasy. The political bent of the Stanford think-tank was decidedly left-wing, clashing sharply with Hubbard's own world-perspective. \"Al was really an arch-conservative,\" says the confidential source. \"He really didn't like what the hippies were doing with LSD, and he held Timothy Leary in great contempt.\"\n\nHumphry Osmond recalls a particular psilocybin session in which \"Al got greatly preoccupied with the idea that he ought to shoot Timothy, and when I began to reason with him that this would be a very bad idea...I became much concerned that he might shoot me...\"\n\n\"To Al,\" says Myron Stolaroff, \"LSD enabled man to see his true self, his true nature and the true order of things.\" But, to Hubbard, the true order of things had little to do with the antics of the American Left.\n\nRecognizing its potential psychic hazards, Hubbard believed that LSD should be administered and monitored by trained professionals. He claimed that he had stockpiled more LSD than anyone on the planet besides Sandoz--including the US government--and he clearly wanted a firm hand in influencing the way it was used.\n\nHowever, Hubbard refused all opportunities to become the LSD Philosopher-King. Whereas Leary would naturally gravitate toward any microphone available, Hubbard preferred the role of the silent curandero, providing the means for the experience, and letting voyagers decipher its meaning for themselves. When cornered by a video camera shortly before this death, and asked to say something to the future, Hubbard replied simply, \"You're the future.\"\n\nIn March of 1966, the cold winds of Congress blew out all hope for Al Hubbard's enlightened Mother Earth. Facing a storm of protest brought on by Leary's reckless antics and the \"LSD-related suicide\" of Diane Linkletter, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Drug Abuse Control Amendment, which declared lysergic acid diethylamide a Schedule I substance; simple possession was deemed a felony, punishable by 15 years in prison. According to Humphry Osmond, Hubbard lobbied Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, who reportedly took the cause of LSD into the Senate chambers, and emerged un-victorious.\n\n\"[The government] had a deep fear of having their picture of reality challenged,\" mourns Harman. \"It had nothing to do with people harming their lives with chemicals--because if you took all the people who had ever had any harmful effects from psychedelics, it's minuscule compared to those associated with alcohol and tobacco.\"\n\nFDA chief James L. Goddard ordered agents to seize all remaining psychedelics not accounted for by Sandoz. \"It was scary,\" recalls Dr. Oscar Janiger, whose Beverly Hills office was raided and years' worth of clinical research confiscated.\n\nHubbard begged Abram Hoffer to let him hide his supply in Hoffer's Canadian Psychiatric Facility. But the doctor refused, and it is believed that Hubbard buried most of his LSD in a sacred parcel in Death Valley, California, claiming that it had been used, rather than risk prosecution. When the panic subsided, only five government-approved scientists were allowed to continue LSD research--none using humans, and none of them associated with Al Hubbard.\n\nIn 1968, his finances in ruins, Hubbard was forced to sell his private island sanctuary for what one close friend termed \"a pittance.\" He filled a number of boats with the antiquated electronics used in his eccentric nuclear experiments, and left Daymen Island for California. Hubbard's efforts in his last decade were effectively wasted, according to most of his friends. Lack of both finances and government permit to resume research crippled all remaining projects he may have had in the hopper.\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/hubbard_al/hubbard_al.shtml\n\nErowid Character Vaults - Captain Al Hubbard 1901 - Aug 31, 1982\n\nSummary\n\nAlfred Matthew Hubbard was known as the Johnny Appleseed of LSD. Born in Kentucky, he had angelic visions as a young boy that reportedly guided him in building a radioactive battery, which he sold for $75,000 in 1919. During Prohibition, he used his skill with electronics to set up a ship-to-shore communications system in the back of the taxi he drove to help smuggle alcohol into the U.S. and Canada. He was caught and served an 18 month prison sentence. However, his skills had not gone unnoticed. A scout from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) recruited Hubbard into the OSS.\n\nCaptain Hubbard was put to work of shipping heavy armaments from San Diego to Canada prior to the U.S. officially joining WW II...and eventually faced a congressional investigation. To avoid federal prosecution he moved to Vancouver and became a Canadian citizen. There he founded a charter boat company and became a millionaire in the 1940s. He later received a full presidential pardon (#2676) from President Harry Truman.\n\nIn 1950, Hubbard experienced another angellic visitation telling him that something important to the future of mankind would soon be coming. When he read about LSD the next year, he knew that was it and immediately sought and acquired LSD, which he tried for himself in 1951. Following his own experience, he started to turn others on. He became well known for his procedure of initially introducing people to carbogen, to see how they reacted to a short-term alteration in consciousness, before he scheduled their LSD sessions.\n\nAt various times over the next 20 years, Hubbard reportedly worked for the Canadian Special Services, the U.S. Justice Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and according to rumors, may have been involved with the CIA's MK-ULTRA project.\n\nHe also worked at the Hollywood Hospital with Ross McLean, with psychiatrists Abram Hoffer and Dr. Humphry Osmond, with Myron Stolaroff at the International Federation for Advanced Study in Menlo Park, and with Willis Harman at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) running psychedelic sessions with LSD.\n\nHow his government positions interacted with his work with LSD is still not known. During those years he introduced more than 6,000 people to LSD--including scientists, politicians, intelligence officials, diplomats, and church figures--and became known as the first \"Captain Trips\", travelling about with a leather case containing pharmaceutically pure LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin.\n\n\"If you don't think it's amazing,\" said Hubbard, \"just go ahead and try it.\"\n\nhttp://dogeatdogma.com/lsd.htm\n\n...\n\nUnder the auspices of MK-ULTRA the CIA regularly dosed its agents and associates with powerful hallucinogens as a preemptive measure against the Soviets' own alleged chemical technology, often with disastrous results. The secret project would see at least two deaths: tennis pro Harold Blauer died after a massive injection of MDA; and the army's own Frank Olson, a biological-warfare specialist, crashed through a closed window in the 12th floor of New York's Statler Hotel, after drinking cognac laced with LSD during a CIA symposium. Dr. Osmond doubts that Hubbard would have been associated with such a project \"not particularly on humanitarian grounds, but on the grounds that it was bad technique.\"\n\n[Note: Recently, a researcher for <i>WorldNetDaily</i> and author of a forthcoming book based on the Frank Olson \"murder,\" revealed to this writer that he has received, via a FOIA request of CIA declassified materials, documents which indicate that Al Hubbard was, indeed, in contact with Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and George Hunter White--an FBI narcotics official who managed Operation Midnight Climax, a joint CIA/FBI blackmail project in which unwitting \"johns\" were given drinks spiked with LSD by CIA-managed prostitutes, and whose exploits were videotaped from behind two-way mirrors at posh hotels in both New York and San Francisco. The researcher would reveal only that Al Hubbard's name \"appeared in connection with Gottlieb and White, but the material is heavily redacted.\"]\n\nHubbard's secret connections allowed him to expose over 6,000 people to LSD before it was effectively banned in '66. He shared the sacrament with a prominent Monsignor of the Catholic Church in North America, explored the roots of alcoholism with AA founder Bill Wilson, and stormed the pearly gates with Aldus Huxley (in a session that resulted in the psychedelic tome <i>Heaven and Hell</i>), as well as supplying most of the Beverly Hills psychiatrists, who, in turn, turned on actors Cary Grant, James Coburn, Jack Nicholson, novelist Anais Nin, and filmmaker Stanley Kubrick.\n\nhttp://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft1870045n&chunk.id=d0e1544&doc.view=print\n\nPsychology in Sequoia Seminar\n\nPsychology was the most poorly defined of all the elements that made up Sequoia Seminar's philosophy, yet it was one of the most important and, even more than the ideas of Buchman or Heard, it set Sequoia Seminar apart from the tradition of Henry B. Sharman. Since Harry always argued that psychology would eventually prove what religion already knew, why bother with psychology at all? Because, among the three appropriate objects of loveGod, self, and otherlove of self or integrity required that people come to understand their subconscious needs and fears so that they could be free to carry out the will of God. The movement believed psychology could help people toward religion, and religion could help them psychologically.\n\nA physician participating in a 1953 seminar wrote that he had learned that psychiatry taught, \"To be happy you must be properly oriented to your environment and totally integrated, so that every action is a productive one leading to full potentiality.\" The seminar taught him that Jesus had said the same thing two thousand years ago and, he concluded, \"a well-adjusted person is, by definition, religious.\"[81]\n\nPsychology was, nevertheless, also perceived as potentially dangerous; when wrongly used it could either undermine the religious message or become the primary purpose of the group, relegating the teachings of Jesus to a secondary role. Freudian psychology, which defined religious belief as neurotic, was an example of the first danger. Harry believed that \"Freudian psychology leads to a mechanistic view of the universe and to a philosophy of meaninglessness.\"[82] There is some indication that the Rathbuns felt, not without reason, that Boyden and her followers fell into the second danger when they split off from the main Sharman group in 1941 and began their own work.[83] The Rathbuns referred to them as \"the psychologizers.\"\n\nThe exact role that psychology played in Sequoia Seminar meetings prior to 1955 is not clear, although its flavor is suggested by a list of recommended readings from 1950 that included works by Rollo May and Erich Fromm in addition to books by Kunkel, Jung, and Heard.[84] Much of the psychological activity that did occur took place under the direction of Emilia [Rathbun] with the assistance of Betty Eisner. Eisner had been a student of Harry's in the business law course. She had attended a Records study group at the Rathbuns' home in 1936 and was at the first Sequoia Seminar in 1946. She had gone on to earn a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and came up from her home in southern California to help lead some special seminars in the mid-1950s.[85]\n\nA set of very complete notes from a 1952 continuation seminar gives some insight into the kind of psychological activity that took place in the sessions. A parenthetical comment near the beginning of the notes indicate that there were \"several sessions during which Seminar participants verbalized their 'seventh veil' matter, their inmost blocks to further growth and progress on the Way.\"[86] These group confessions may have owed something to Emilia's years of experience hearing confessions in her Oxford Group work. When she told the participants, \"nothing that has been said is a surprise, at least to me,\" she was repeating language she had used to describe her Buchmanite experience. Emilia assured the group that they became more lovable when they opened up and admitted their \"inmost natures and problems,\" and explained that it was all part of the process of discovering what they could be so that they could see where they were and how they could move toward what God intended them to be.[87]\n\nAs the decade progressed the role of psychology in the group's activities increased. In 1956 Emilia and Betty Eisner were coleaders of a group that wrote spontaneously on themes suggested by Emilia, \"trying to express their own feelings rather than intellectual concepts.\"[88] In addition to spontaneous writing, they also did Jungian dream interpretation in groups and used art to express their feelings.[89] The 1958 annual report explained, \"painting and other art work is becoming an increasingly important part of our program, particularly at the Continuation seminars. We are learning how such activities can contribute to the process of individual change with which we are concerned.\"[90]\n\nSo pervasive was the psychological approach by 1958 and 1959 that almost all of the continuation seminars given in those summers were psychologically focused and many included art. The most explicit was a seminar entitled \"Group Therapy\" led by Betty Eisner. It was described as \"an intensive group therapy situation and will be conducted on a very personal level aimed at removing barriers within the individual which obstruct his growth in creative living. . . . The use of art materials will play an important role.\"[91]\n\nTwo comments made in 1959 indicate that the heavy emphasis on psychology may have gotten out of hand. The announcement letter for the 1959 seminar season cautioned potential participants that the leaders were \"neither qualified nor intended to perform the function of psychotherapy,\" and they would not accept anybody who seemed more interested in that than in pursuing a religious life. About the same time, a handwritten memo from Emilia asked if people should not be \"well grounded in the teachings of Jesus and have made the decision to follow the 'way' before they are enrolled in any group which has as its objective the process of introspection (therapy).\" And, conversely, she asked if people who started work in psychotherapy should be \"told that the process in the seminar structure leads to a choice of 'the way' of life commended by Jesus (commitment)?\"[92]\n\nEmilia's [Rathbun] fear that the psychotherapeutic aspects of the work might have begun to take precedence over the religious purpose seems particularly apt in retrospect. Although nobody knew it at the time, Sequoia Seminar was one of a stream of sources for what would become the \"human potential\" movement of the 1960s. Their stress of religious values kept them from total involvement, but for several years in the late 1950s they were the place where some of the California activists in the human potential movement got their start.\n\nOne was Del Carlson. Carlson was a Marine Corps veteran who had been attracted to a Records study group at San Jose State College in 1947 and who had participated actively in Students Concerned. He stayed with the movement after the demise of Students Concerned and was, for a dozen years, one of the mainstays of the group. A high school art teacher, he had his summers free and devoted them to Sequoia Seminar. He was the group's registrar, business manager, and leader of art therapy sessions until 1962.[93]\n\n...\n\nCarlson was also a friend of Michael Murphy, the man who founded Esalen. In fact, Carlson was a coleader of the first formal seminar ever held at Esalen in 1962, when it was still called Slate's Hot Springs.[94]\n\n...\n\nEven more important, both to Sequoia Seminar and the human potential movement, was Willis Harman.\n\nAn engineering professor at Stanford, Harman had attended a study group led by Harry [Rathbun] and then had gone to a Sequoia Seminar in 1954. He had not expected the heavy emphasis on meditation, introspection, and self-exposure, but he found that his engineer's rational world view was \"permanently destroyed\" as a result of his experience there. He embarked on an extended period of self-education in mysticism and psychic phenomena and moved into the inner circle of Sequoia Seminar.[95]\n\nHarman had been very impressed by Gerald Heard's lectures on his experience with mescaline; he also made contact with Myron Stolaroff, one of the original American experimenters with LSD, who was also briefly involved with Sequoia Seminar.\n\nOn November 16, 1956, eight of the Sequoia Seminar leadership group accompanied Harman to the home of a physician member of the movement, where Harman took LSD for the first time [Interesting Harman in another interview says 1954] . In subsequent years almost every member of the Sequoia Seminar inner leadership group experimented with LSD on a number of occasions.\n\nMany of the drug sessions were led by Betty Eisner who was very interested in the psychotherapeutic possibilities of low doses of the then legal hallucinogen. She and Harman disagreed strongly, however, on how the drug should be used since he [Harman] preferred larger doses that would provide the user with mystical experiences, rather than the milder effects that Eisner sought.[96]\n\nEven though LSD was still a noncontrolled substance and, therefore, legal to use, Sequoia Seminar employed it very cautiously. It was never distributed to anyone other than group leaders, and their sessions were carefully planned and supervised, usually with the presence of one of the planning group members who was a medical doctor. There appear to have been few if any \"bad trips,\" and the drug-induced mystical experiences and psychotherapeutic sessions are usually remembered positively by those who partook of them.\n\nExperimentation with LSD stopped after 1959 because most of those involved felt there was nothing more to be gained from continued use and perhaps also because of a difficult confrontation between Emilia Rathbun and Betty Eisner that may have involved the use of the drug. Those, like Harman, who wished to pursue further interests in the drug left Sequoia Seminar and became active in other\n\ngroups such as Esalen and the International Foundation for Internal Freedom.[97]\n\nJust how far the Rathbuns had moved from the tradition of Henry B. Sharman by the end of the decade is illustrated by the controversy that surrounded the last meeting of the trustees of the Sharman will in 1959. Harry was not only one of the trustees of the self-liquidating foundation set up by the will; he was also its executor.\n\nIn 1958 plans were made to dispose of the last twenty-five thousand dollars of the funds from Sharman's estate, and Harry apparently hoped that the bulk of the money could go to Sequoia Seminar. To convince the others that his group met the intention of the will, Harry invited them out to California for a seminar.[98] Opposition from the other trustees to the kind of program that the Rathbuns were running killed both the visit and any hope Harry had of getting Sharman funds, although Harry did lead a seminar for the trustees the next year at Springfield College in Massachusetts.\n\nWord of the psychological emphasis had spread, and those who toed the orthodox Sharman line were not pleased with what they had heard. One trustee reported that a number of students of his had gone to Stanford and had reported back unfavorably on the Rathbuns' work. Another summed up his objections by telling Harry that he believed Sequoia Seminar was \"quite different from those led by Dr. Sharman. Very little serious study of the Records themselves seems to be attempted and much time is devoted to the personal problems of the individual members. Training and skill in psychology and psychiatry seem to be very important.\"[99] And finally, a third pointed out that Sharman had wanted efforts directed at students and faculty, but Harry and Emilia were working mainly with nonacademic adults.[100]\n\nThe alienation of the trustees and the experimentation with LSD were both aspects of the way psychology had come to dominate the work of the group. This domination could have made the group an ongoing force within the new human potential movement in California. That course was not followed, however, because in the period between 1959 and 1962 Emilia underwent a number of severe personal strains that eventually climaxed in a religious revelation. This revelation was the basis for a reclarification of the whole meaning and purpose of the movement.\n\nThe psychologizing that Emilia had first questioned back in the early 1940s when it was led by Elizabeth Boyden had slowly worked its way into her own group, and by the end of the decade it threatened to eclipse the religious work completely. The philosophy that had evolved was based in part on the validity of psychology as a means for personal insight, but it also used the evolutionary and mystical theories of Gerald Heard, and always the objective study of the life of Jesus in the Sharman tradition. Emilia's personal crisis of the period after 1959 would have the effect of redressing the balance and putting psychology back into a secondary role. Psychology would be exchanged for a new interpretation of the religious message that would finally move Sequoia Seminar from proto-sect to a fully self-conscious religious movement.\n\nThe increasing stress on psychology toward the end of the 1950s, and the growing formalization of ideology, were both indications that the group was moving away from the churches (both literally and theoretically) and toward the sect end of the church-sect continuum. The codification of the movement's ideology decreased the likelihood that they would change to go along with trends in the larger society. The focus on psychology was perceived by members as a \"service,\" exactly the kind of service predicted by the economic model as compensation for the increased cost of sect membership. The transition was not yet complete. The most obvious component of a sect is its divergence from standard church values. It is that divergence that makes membership so costly. At the end of the 1950s, Sequoia Seminar was still primarily a gospel study group that could operate from within the churches. There were signs of uniqueness beginning to appear, but they would not be fully embraced until after Emilia had her vision of a New Religion for the Third Age.\n\n| ------------------\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/eisner_betty/eisner_betty.shtml\n\nSep 29, 1915 - Jul 1, 2004\n\nSummary\n\nBetty Grover Eisner, Ph.D. was a clinical psychologist who was part of the group of LSD researchers active in Los Angeles in the 1950s and 60s.\n\nAccording to Oscar Janiger, she participated in discussions about potential socially acceptable uses of LSD with a group including Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, Alan Watts, Anais Nin, and Sidney Cohen.\n\nDr. Eisner worked with LSD, mescaline, amphetamine, ketamine, Ritalin, and carbogen with her patients, both in individual and group settings.

Until much more is known about the personal (biochemical and psychological), familial, and social factors that contribute to alcoholism, so it will remain. Most new therapies are merely adjunctive to AA and will continue to be so until it is shown that they have therapeutic value when used alone. In my view, psychedelic therapy is best used as a preparation for AA.\n\nWhen Bill W. and Dr. Bob founded AA, alcoholism had not been accepted as a disease, either by society at large or by the medical profession. Society considered it a moral problem, but found itself confronted with an interesting dilemma, for only a small proportion of the total drinking society drank excessively. No moral sanctions were required for the majority, who eventually made social drinking an integral part of the culture.\n\nThe majority who remained moral drinkers could not understand why a minority became intemperate or alcoholic. Moral sanctions were applied on the premise that excessive drinking arose from defects of character, defects of will, and defects in society. These sanctions included education, persuasion, incarceration, and banishment. Unfortunately, the most stringent measures had little permanent effect, and the proportion of the drinking society (a concept developed by Dr. H. Osmond) remained the same or increased. Medicine also considered alcoholism a non-disease.\n\nThe founders of AA introduced the medical model first to alcoholics, later to society, and finally to the medical profession. This concept was very appealing to alcoholics because it gave them a satisfactory explanation for their misfortunes. If they were sick and not evil, then they might expect the same sort of treatment they would receive if they developed pneumonia or diabetes. Bill W. and Dr. Bob also introduced the concept of allergy, which thirty-five years ago was incorporated into medicine as a new group of diseases. (1)\n\nBut AA insisted that alcoholism was more than a physical illness. It also carried strong personal responsibility. An alcoholic could not be censured for being an alcoholic, but he could be for doing nothing about it.\n\nSociety resisted the idea that alcoholics are sick, since it got no guidance from a reluctant medical profession. Doctors expect diseases to be more or less definable, to have treatment that may be ineffective but must be in common use, and to have a predictable prognosis. When they became convinced that AA did help large numbers of alcoholics remain sober, they gradually accepted alcoholics as patients. Even now, the majority of hospitals are extremely reluctant to admit alcoholics who are drunk, and many doctors dread seeing them in their offices. Eventually AA forced the profession to accept the fact that alcoholism, which has been estimated to afflict 5 per cent of the population, is a disease. This marked the beginning of the final solution to the problem. For, having accepted the disease concept, doctors were challenged by the enormous problems, and, in a matter of a few years, several major therapeutic discoveries were made.\n\nThe newer adjunctive therapies developed for alcoholism may be divided into the psychological and the biochemical. Psychotherapy, deconditioning therapy, and psychedelic therapy are examples of purely psychological therapy, while sugar-free diets for relative hypoglycemia, mega vitamin B3, megascorbic acid, and adrenocortical extracts (or extracts of licorice) are examples of pure chemotherapies.\n\nPsychedelic therapy is the only therapy that has prepared alcoholics to become responsible members of AA, when previously they had been unable to do so.\n\nPsychedelic Therapy\n\nWe must distinguish sharply between psychedelic reactions and the means for inducing them. Failure to understand this distinction has led to several futile researches, best exemplified by the study of Smart and Storm (1964), which was widely circulated in an extreme form before publication of the watered-down version.\n\nPsychedelic therapy refers to a form of psychotherapy in which hallucinogenic drugs are used in a particular way to facilitate the final goal, which for alcoholics is sobriety. The drugs may be mescaline, LSD, psilocybin, and many others, as well as combinations. It is therefore trivial to test the effect of LSD or other hallucinogens on alcoholics in such a way that there is no psychedelic reaction. In fact, these trivial experiences have led to trivial data, as reported by Smart et al. (1966), who claimed that a group of ten alcoholics given LSD did not differ in outcome from a group of ten given another psychoactive drug. Close examination of their report shows that no therapy was given, nor was there any encouragement of discussion of problems. The experience was not psychedelic, but was more in the nature of an inquisition, with the subject strapped to the bed, pretreated with dilantin, and ill from 800 mcg of LSD.\n\nSince no investigator has ever claimed that LSD used in this way does have any therapeutic effect, this experiment suggests that LSD used with no therapeutic intent or skill is not apt to help. One of the subjects given LSD by Smart et al. described his experience in comparison with a psychedelic reaction he received from smaller quantities of LSD in Saskatchewan. The experiences and the outcome were quite different.\n\nPsychedelic therapy aims to create a set and a setting that will allow proper psychotherapy. The psychedelic therapist works with material that the patient experiences and discusses, and helps him resynthesize a new model of life or a new personal philosophy. During the experience, the patient draws upon information flooding in from the altered environment and from his own past, and uses it to eliminate false ideas and false memories. With the aid of the therapist, he evaluates himself more objectively and becomes more acutely aware of his own responsibility for his situation and, even more important, for doing something about it. He also becomes aware of inner strengths or qualities that help him in his long and difficult struggle toward sobriety.\n\nThe book The Use of LSD in Psychotherapy and Alcoholism, edited by H. A. Abramson (1967), contains the best collection of scientific papers on psychedelic therapy.\n\nAround 1952, Osmond and I had become familiar with psychotomimetic reactions induced by LSD. There was a marked similarity between these reactions and schizophrenia and the toxic psychoses. Delirium tremens is one of the common toxic states. It occurred to us that LSD might be used to produce models of dt's. Many alcoholics ascribed the beginning of their recovery to \"hitting bottom,\" and often \"hitting bottom\" meant having had a particularly memorable attack of dt's. We thought that LSD could be used this way with no risk to the patient.\n\nWe treated our first two alcoholics at the Saskatchewan Hospital, Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and one recovered.\n\nOther early pilot studies were encouraging, and we increased the tempo of our research until at one time six of our major psychiatric centers in Saskatchewan were using it. As of now, we must have treated close to one thousand alcoholics.\n\nWithin a few years after our first patients were treated, we became aware that a large proportion of our alcoholics did not have psychotomimetic reactions. Their experiences were exciting and pleasant, and yielded insight into their drinking problems. It became evident that a new phenomenon had been recognized in psychiatry. Osmond created the word psychedelic to define these experiences, and announced this at a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1957.\n\nFollowing this, our researches were aimed at improving the quality and quantity of psychedelic reactions. Within the past ten years, major studies, under the direction of Dr. Ross MacLean, Hollywood Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia, and under the direction of Dr. S. Unger at Spring Grove State Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, have added materially to our knowledge of the effect of psychedelic therapy on alcoholism.\n\nI will not review the results of psychedelic therapy in detail. This has been done in the books edited by H. A. Abramson and in The Hallucinogens by A. Hoffer and H. Osmond (1967). The one striking conclusion is that every scientist using psychedelic therapy with alcoholics found the same proportion of recoveries. Whether the experiments were considered controlled or not, about 50 per cent were able to remain sober or to drink much less. This seems to be a universal statistic for LSD therapy.\n\n(1). Dr. Walter Alvarez recently told me that when he wrote a paper on food allergies at the Mayo Clinic about fifty years ago, he was severely criticized by his colleagues. Only strong support from one of the Mayos, who discovered that he himself had a food allergy, protected Alvarez from even-more-powerful assault. Medicine seems very reluctant to take unto itself new diseases. (back)\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose.shtml\n\nLSD comes in several different forms. The most common is paper blotter.

His father was a local merchant, and the family was prominent locally. Myron graduated first in his class both from his high school and from the local military junior college. At Stanford University, he received a Phi Beta Kappa key and a Tau Beta Pi key in recognition of his scholarship. He was a student at Stanford when David Packard and Bill Hewlett came back to campus to show off their first commercial oscillator. Near the end of the Second World War, he received an engineering degree and took a job working as the first employee of Alexander M. Poni-atoff at a small electric-motor company in Belmont, California.\n\nHe began as a design engineer and later helped Poniatoff prototype the first magnetic reel-to-reel tape recorder, which launched the company that took its name from Poniatoff's initials plus \"ex\" for excellence. Ampex Electric and Manufacturing had been founded in San Carlos after Poniatoff had begun looking for new applications for his high-quality\n\nmotors. Ampex is no longer a factor in Silicon Valley and today is remembered largely because its corporate logo is still prominently visible on Highway 101, the freeway that slices through the heart of the Valley. However, Ampex was as significant as Hewlett-Packard in the Valley's lineage, and many pioneering engineers still remember the company fondly.\n\n...\n\nOf course, none of that was apparent from what was nothing more than an invitation to attend a lecture being given by Harry Rathbun, a professor of business law at Stanford. Rathbun was a charismatic teacher who was tremendously popular on campus, where he lectured to overflow classes on subjects that included discussions of personal ethics and values.\n\nRathbun's presentation was given in a small library in South Palo Alto, and it struck Stolaroff \"between the eyes.\"14 The themes the law professor addressed that evening included \"Who are we?\" and \"Where are we going?\" They were Big Questions About Life. Stolaroff was transported, realizing that his life had been hollow and that the questions Rathbun\n\nwas asking and answering mesmerized him.\n\n...\n\nAs it turned out, Rathbun's own life had been transformed when he and his wife, Emilia, attended a 1935 wilderness retreat led by Henry B. Sharman, a wealthy retired Canadian. Sharman had written a book entitled Jesus as Teacher, which probed the historical records surrounding the New Testament.\n\nAfter returning to Stanford, the Rathbuns began conducting study groups for Stanford students in their home on the teachings of Christ. The sessions were later expanded to include a two-week retreat at a center that was established in the mountains about forty miles southwest of campus near the sleepy beach town of Santa Cruz.\n\nThey became known as the Sequoia Seminars and ultimately, in the 1970s, spun off a series of cultlike groups (including the Creative Initiative Foundation, Beyond War, and Women to Women Building the Earth for the Children's Sake) that attracted a broad, largely upper-middle-class following.\n\nIn many cases, people who joined them sold their homes and personal belongings and dedicated their lives completely to these groups. However, long before the 1970s, the Sequoia Seminars had a less well known but more dramatic and far-reaching consequence, in their immediate impact on Myron Stolaroff. Although he had been angered by Harry Rathbun's sneaky trick of guiding him to the phi-losophy of Jesus, Stolaroff remained intrigued by Rathbun's ideas.\n\nThe following year, he decided to set aside his anti-Jesus bias and his concern about what was happening to Jews around the world in the name of Jesus and attend a longer set of discussion groups led by the Rathbuns. At the seminar, Stolaroff became a convert. By the time it was over, he felt that he had experienced true love for others for the first time in his life and become a believer in \"the power of the message\" of Jesus.15\n\nHe decided that the most important thing that he could do with his life was to commit himself to the will of God.\n\n....\n\nIt was during one of his visits in 1956 that Heard spoke enthusiastically to Stolaroff about a new drug called LSD. The very idea shocked the young engineer, who couldn't figure out why a world-famous mystic would need to take a drug. Nevertheless, Heard was fervent and told Stolaroff about an unusual man who would occasionally come from Canada and administer the substance to both him and Aldous Huxley.\n\nWith two passports and with a murky history of connections to both law enforcement and intelligence agencies, Al Hubbard was without question one of the most curious characters in America during the 1950s and 1960s. There are conflicting accounts of Hubbard's life, but the best summary of his early years appears in Jay Stevens's Storming Heaven: LSD and the American Dream.\n\nBorn in Kentucky, Hubbard surfaced publicly in Seattle in 1919 with the invention of a perpetual-motion machine.17 Later, there were tales of his running war materials by boat up the West Coast, where they were then shipped by land through Canada to Great Britain. And there was an intimation that he had had some loose affiliation with the Manhattan Project as a black-market supplier of uranium. Even after Stolaroff had come to know Hubbard well, he wasn't certain where the truth lay. But he soon fell under Hubbard's spell, viewing him as an especially powerful and articulate individual.\n\nHubbard is intriguing in part because while most popular accounts of the introduction of LSD in America focus on the roles played by author Ken Kesey and psychologist Timothy Leary, Hubbard was an earlier proponent, and an important influence in the use of psychedelics by a number of Silicon Valley's pioneering engineers.\n\nHubbard, while he was the president of a Canadian uranium mine, had discovered psychedelics in the early 1950s when he participated in mescaline experiments at the University of Vancouver.\n\nHe found LSD in 1955, and in addition to Huxley, Heard, and perhaps more than one thousand others during the 1950s, he introduced the drug to Stolaroff and indirectly to a small group of engineers who formed a splinter group from the Rathbuns' Sequoia Seminar.\n\n...\n\nMyron Stolaroff\n\nHe [Stolaroff] returned to California a zealot, a convert to the new LSD faith. He had decided that experiences like the one he had had in Canada were the answer to the world's problems.\n\nLSD would give society a new set of powerful tools to advance human development. Like Engelbart, Stolaroff set off on his own grand quest to augment the human mind.\n\nHis first stop was his closest friends at the Sequoia Seminar, where he had become a member of the group's planning committee. He introduced them to LSD in turn and created an informal research group composed of five fellow engineers and their wives.\n\nThe group included a young Ampex engineer, Don Allen; Stanford electrical engineering professor Willis Harman; and several others from both Hewlett-Packard and SRI.\n\nStolaroff's study group set in motion an unheralded but significant train of events, plunging a small group of technologists into the world of psychedelics almost a decade before LSD became a standard recreational drug on American college campuses.\n\n...\n\nFadiman had gone to Harvard and studied social relations. He soon came to consider the field as psychology without rats, and he had instead focused his energy on being an actor. After graduating in 1960, he spent a year in Paris, and while he was there Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert along with Aldous Huxley passed through on their way to deliver an academic paper on psychedelics in Copenhagen.\n\nIn Paris, Alpert, who had been Fadiman's professor at Harvard, told him, \"The greatest thing in the world has happened to me, and I want to share it with you.\" He proceeded to pull a small bottle out of his pocket, introducing his former student to LSD.\n\nForced back to America by the threat of the draft, Fadiman moved to California a year later and arrived at Stanford as a distinctly unhappy graduate student in 1961. He was feeling that school was a waste of his life, which he would have rather spent in more cultured\n\nAugmentation Europe.\n\nMoreover, having recently been introduced to psychedelic drugs, the world suddenly seemed like a much different place. Full of self-pity, he began leafing through the Stanford class catalog looking for something that might be interesting to study. He found a small section of crossdisciplinary classes, including one being taught by an electrical engineering professor, Willis Harman, called \"The Human Potential.\" The class was to be a discussion of what was the highest and the best to which human beings could aspire.\n\nIn his new, more highly attuned state, Fadiman thought to himself, There's something here. That morning, he walked across campus to visit Harman. The man to whom he introduced himself looked like a totally straight and conservative engineering professor, and when Fadiman asked if he could take the interdisciplinary course, Harman replied that it was already full for the quarter, and perhaps he should think about it for the next quarter.\n\n\"I've taken psilocybin three times,\" Fadiman said quietly. The professor walked across the room, shut his office door, and said, \"We'd better talk.\"\n\nIn the end, Fadiman became Harman's teaching assistant. He was able to talk to the students about things that Harman felt he couldn't. He also soon became the youngest researcher at the newly founded International Foundation for Advanced Study, Myron Sto-laroff's project for continuing his research on the uses of LSD.\n\nWhen Stolaroff and Harman set up shop in Menlo Park in March 1961, they weren't the only ones on the Midpeninsula exploring the therapeutic uses of LSD. Experiments were already being conducted at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Menlo Park, and the Palo Alto Mental Research Institute had also begun introducing local psychiatrists and psychologists, and even writers such as Allen Ginsberg, to psychedelic drugs.15\n\nBut the foundation was something new. Engineers rather than medical professionals led the project, and the clinic was intent on charging a five-hundred-dollar fee for each experience. An early local newspaper report described the foundation's goals as being \"partly medical, partly scientific, partly philosophical, partly mystical.\"16\n\nStolaroff, with the help of Willis Harman, largely funded the foundation, the real purpose of which was to conduct the research needed to make LSD credible in the medical profession. They worked with several psychologists, including Fadiman, as well as the mysterious Al Hubbard, who was a mentor to both Harman and Stolaroff and who became a member of the board of directors.\n\nFadiman, who soon was teaching at San Francisco State, finished his Ph.D. in psychology at Stanford, and his research at the foundation focused on the changes in beliefs, attitude, and behavior that resulted from taking LSD.\n\n...\n\nThe foundation was not far from Roy Kepler's bookstore and a short walk from the hole-in-the-wall store where the Midpeninsula Free University store and print shop were to locate in the mid-sixties. In another building a block away, Brand later established the Whole Earth Truck Store and the Whole Earth Catalog. About a mile away from the truck store, the original People's Computer Company settled and in turn was the catalyst for the Homebrew Computer Club in the mid-1970s. The club itself served to ignite the personal-computer industry.\n\n...\n\nMost of the Bay Area was comfortably oblivious. Beginning in 1961, for a period of more than four years, the International Foundation for Advanced Study led more than 350 people through LSD experiences.\n\n...Among the participants were Dr. Charles Savage, a physician who had conducted medical experiments for the U.S. Navy in the early 1950s, exploring the use of psychedelics as a truth serum,\n\n...\n\nIn his hunt for subjects for the foundation's creativity studies, Fadiman called George Leonard, a California-based editor for Look. The magazine was at work on a special issue entitled \"California: A New Game with New Rules.\" Leonard and a colleague came to the foundation and took part in an LSD session in an attempt to help them think through the design of the issue.\n\nIn the end, Leonard, who wrote about his trip in his autobiography, Walking on the Edge of the World, wasn't sure if the experience made a difference. However, the June 28,1966, edition of Look introduced the rest of the world to the social and cultural changes that were ripping through California. On the cover was a photo of Jim and Dorothy Fadiman, locked in a deep embrace amid a field of California poppies.\n\nA backlash was inevitable. Fadiman continued to oversee the LSD creativity research with scientists and engineers, until one day, while\n\nhe was at the office with a group of four scientists lying on the floor listening to music in preparation for work on their technical problems\n\nwhile under a low dose of LSD, he opened an official-looking letter from the Food and Drug Administration. He knew what was coming.\n\nIt was July 1966, and the government was looking for ways to show that it was acting to stop teenage drug use. The letter was an order to immediately stop the foundation's research. Fadiman turned to his colleagues and said, \"I think we opened this letter tomorrow.\"\n\nThe formal experiments ended, but the secret was out. In 1966 and 1967, LSD was seeping out of an isolated bohemian niche and into the mainstream of America. It would even permeate SRI, the largely military funded research center that sat just blocks away from offices of the foundation and the Whole Earth Truck Store.\n\nStanford Alumni Obits:\n\nhttp://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2002/sepoct/classnotes/obituaries.html\n\n...\n\nLucille Emma Orsolini Carley, 34, of Palo Alto, April 9, at 93.

Many Deadheads consider this era of the Dead to be the experimental apex of the band's history. It is also the first album with Tom Constanten as an official member of the band. Rolling Stone, upon reviewing the album, mentioned that \"no other music sustains a lifestyle so delicate and loving and lifelike.\" The album was certified gold by the on May 13, 1997.\n\nThe title of the album is a palindrome created by cover artist Rick Griffin and lyricist Robert Hunter . According to the audio version of the Rock Scully memoir, Living with the Dead (read by the author and former Dead co-manager himself), the title is pronounced \"OX-OH-MOX-OH-AH\". The words \"GRATEFUL DEAD\" on the front of the album, written in large, flowing capital letters, can also be read \"WE ATE THE ACID\". The artwork around the bottom edge of the album cover depicts several phallic representations. In 1991 Rolling Stone selected Aoxomoxoa as having the eighth best album cover of all time. Tapes of outtakes from the recording sessions exist among fans.\n\nThe group had already initiated recording sessions for the album when Ampex manufactured and released the first Multitrack recording machine offering 16 tracks of recording and playback (model number MM-1000). This doubled the number of tracks the band had available when they recorded Anthem of the Sun the previous year\n\nQuote\n\nAmpex is an American electronics company founded in 1944 by Alexander M. Poniatoff. The name AMPEX is an acronym, created by its founder, which stands for Alexander M. Poniatoff Excellence. At one time public, Ampex is currently a privately held company.- Origins :Alexander M...\n\nAs a direct consequence, the band spent eight months off-and-on in the studio not only recording the album but getting used toand experimenting withthe new technology. Garcia commented that \"it was our first adventure with sixteen-track and we tended to put too much on everything ... A lot of the music was just lost in the mix, a lot of what was really there.\" As a result, Garcia and Lesh went back in the studio in 1971 to remix the album, removing whole sections of songs for a re-release. The first release from 1969 has not been commercially available since the 1971 remix replaced it. Although somewhat rare, this original mix still circulates among tape traders and vinyl collectors to this day.\n\nMusical personnel\n\nJerry Garcia\n\n- guitars, vocals Bob Weir\n\n- guitars, vocals Tom Constanten\n\n- keyboards Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan - organ\n\nPhil Lesh\n\n- basses, vocals Bill Kreutzmann\n\n- percussion Mickey Hart\n\nProduction personnel\n\nGrateful Dead - producers and arrangers\n\nBob Matthews - executive engineer\n\nBetty Cantor - engineer\n\nRon Wickersham - consulting engineer\n\nDan Healy - consulting engineer\n\nOwsley Stanley\n\nOwsley Stanley also known as The Bear, was an underground LSD cook, the first to produce large quantities of pure LSD.... - consulting engineer (credited as \"Owsley\")\n\nRam Rod, John P.

Because Augustus Owsley Stanley III has spent his life avoiding photographs, few people would know what he looks like.\n\nThe name Owsley became a noun that appears in the Oxford dictionary as English street slang for good acid. It is the most famous brand name in LSD history. Probably the first private individual to manufacture the psychedelic, \"Owsley\" is a folk hero of the counterculture, celebrated in songs by the\n\nGrateful Dead and Steely Dan.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Stanley -- at 72, still known as the Bear -- has been living with his wife, Sheila, off the grid, in the outback of Queensland, Australia, where he makes small gold and enamel sculptures and keeps in touch with the world through the Internet.\n\nAs a planned two-week visit to the Bay Area stretched to three, four and then five weeks, Bear agreed to give The Chronicle an interview because a friend asked him. He has rarely consented to speak to the press about his life, his work or his unconventional thinking on matters such as the coming ice age\n\nor his all-meat diet.\n\nSporting a buccaneer's earring he got when he was in jail and a hearing aid on the same ear, he keeps a salty goatee, and the sides of his face look boiled clean from seven weeks of maximum radiation treatment for throat cancer. Having lost one of his vocal cords, he speaks only in a whispered croak these days. At one point, he was reduced to injecting his puree of steak and espresso directly into his stomach.\n\n\"I never set out to change the world,\" he rasps in recalling his early manufacture of LSD. \"I only set out to make sure I was taking something (that) I knew what it was. And it's hard to make a little. And my friends all wanted to know what they were taking, too. Of course, my friends expanded very\n\nrapidly.\"\n\nBy conservative estimates, Bear Research Group made more than 1.25 million doses of LSD between 1965 and 1967, essentially seeding the entire modern psychedelic movement.\n\nLess well known are Bear's contributions to rock concert sound. As the original sound mixer for the Grateful Dead, he was responsible for fundamental advances in audio technology [AMPEX] , things as basic now as monitor speakers that allow vocalists to hear themselves onstage.\n\nSays the Dead's Bob Weir: \"He's good for a different point of view at about any given time. He's brilliant. He knows everything.\"\n\nBear, whose grandfather was a Kentucky governor and U.S. senator, grew up in Los Angeles and Arlington, Va. He was thrown out of military school in the eighth grade for being drunk and dropped out of school altogether at 18. He managed to get accepted to the University of Virginia, where he spent a year studying engineering. By 1956, he was in the Air Force, specializing in electronics and radar.\n\nLater, Bear studied ballet, acting and Russian, worked in jet propulsion labs [JPL] as well as radio and television, and then entered UC Berkeley in 1963, but lasted less than a year.\n\nThen he discovered acid [1963-1964?] .\n\nHe found the recipe for making LSD in the Journal of Organic Chemistry at the UC Berkeley library. Soon after, Bear began to cook acid. [His girlfriend was a chemist at UCB]\n\nThe Berkeley police raided his first lab in 1966 and confiscated a substance that they claimed was methedrine. When it turned out to be something else -- probably a component of LSD -- Bear not only walked free but successfully sued the cops for the return of his lab equipment.\n\nBy the time he made a special batch called Monterey Purple for the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival -- Owsley Purple was the secret smile on Jimi Hendrix's face that night -- \"Owsley\" was an underground legend.\n\nIn December 1967, agents arrested him at his secret lab in Orinda. The \"LSD Millionaire\" headline in The Chronicle prompted the Dead to write the song \"Alice D. Millionaire.\" In 1970, after a pot bust in Oakland, a judge revoked Bear's bail, and he served two years at Terminal Island near the Los Angeles\n\nHarbor.\n\n\"If you make some, you've got to move some to get some money to make it,\" he says now. \"But then you had to give a lot away to keep the street price down. So anyway, I'm sort of embedded in this thing that I'm tangled up in. ... Just as soon as it became illegal, I wanted out. Then, of course, I felt an\n\nobligation.\"\n\nBear, chemist to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, was involved with the Dead almost from the band's beginnings at Kesey's notorious Acid Tests. Bear was the Dead's first patron and, briefly, their manager. He bought the band sound equipment and began to use the Dead as a laboratory for audio research [with AMPEX equipment] .\n\n\"We'd never thought about high-quality PAs,\" says the Dead's Weir. \"There was no such thing until Bear started making one.\"\n\nBear made the first public address system specifically dedicated to music in 1966. If he was the first concert sound engineer in rock music to take his job seriously, his habit of making tape recordings of the shows he mixed also gave the Dead an unprecedented archive of live recordings dating back to the\n\nband's first days. Many of Bear's tapes have been turned into albums.\n\nBear has always lived in a quite particular world. \"He can be very anal retentive, on a certain level, on a genius level,\" says Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane. \"I've seen him send his eggs back three times at Howard Johnson's.\"\n\nHis all-meat diet is a well-known example. When he was younger, Bear read about the Eskimos eating only fish and meat and became convinced that humans are meant to be exclusively carnivorous. The members of the Grateful Dead remember living with Bear for several months in 1966 in Los Angeles, where the refrigerator contained only bottles of milk and a slab of steak, meat they fried and ate straight out of the pan. His heart attack several years ago had nothing to do with his strict regimen, according to Bear, but more likely the result of some poisonous broccoli his mother made him eat as a youth.\n\nAs a sound mixer, Bear holds equally strict viewpoints, insisting that the most effective rock concert systems should have only a single source of sound, his argument quickly veering into the realm of psycho-acoustics.\n\n\"The PA can only be in one spot,\" he says. \"All the sounds have to come from a single place because the human brain is carrying around the most sophisticated sound processing of any computer or living creature. It equals the bats that fly by echo. It equals the dolphins. It equals the owls that hunt\n\nat night without any daylight at all. It is a superb system for locating and separating one sound from everything else.\"\n\nBear left Northern California in the early '80s, convinced that a natural disaster was imminent. He predicted at the time that global warming would lead to a six-week-long ultra-cyclone that could cover the Northern Hemisphere with a new ice age. Determining that the tropical northern side of Australia would be the most likely region to survive, Bear made a beeline for Queensland and says he felt at home the moment he set foot on the new continent.\n\n\"I might be right about the ice age thing,\" he allows. \"I might be wrong.\"\n\nOld friends express shock that Bear would ever even admit to that possibility, but, if not exactly mellowed in his old age, he has found room to accommodate other points of view. \"He's come a long way,\" says Wavy Gravy, who visited Bear in Australia this year. \"He used to be real snappy and grumpy. Now he can be actually sweet.\" His four children are grown. He has five grandchildren, and his oldest son, Pete, in Florida, just became a grandfather, making Bear a great-grandfather for the first time. His other son, Starfinder, a veterinarian, hosted a party for him last month at his Oakland home attended by the old Dead crowd [I've been there] , a tortoise and a caged iguana. He has two daughters, Nina and Redbird, and maintains his own Web site (http://www.thebear.org/) where he sells his sculpture and posts various diatribes and essays.\n\nHe keeps up with the music scene -- he singles out Wolfmother and the Arctic Monkeys as new bands he likes. \"Any time the music on the radio starts to sound like rubbish, it's time to take some LSD,\" he says. Owsley Stanley (he legally dropped the \"Augustus\" 40 years ago) has also not joined the ranks of the penitent psychedelicists who look on their experiences as youthful indiscretions.\n\n\"I wound up doing time for something I should have been rewarded for,\" he says. \"What I did was a community service, the way I look at it. I was punished for political reasons. Absolutely meaningless. Was I a criminal? No. I was a good member of society. Only my society and the one making the laws are\n\ndifferent.\"\n\nAt the hilltop San Anselmo home where Bear had been house-sitting, pretty much all available space was taken over with his belongings. He squatted over the piles, trying to figure out what to ship and what to take with him. Two days before his flight, it looks like he'll need every minute.\n\nThis time, he was extending his stay to catch his old friends Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady of Hot Tuna play at the Fillmore. But when he left for the airport the next day, he got as far as Sausalito before he discovered that he had left the briefcase with the tickets back in San Anselmo, and the trip\n\nhome was postponed for another week.\n\n\"I even said, 'I wonder what I'm leaving behind this time?' before I left,\" he says, somewhat sadly.\n\n| ------------------\n\nhttp://www.brainsturbator.com/forums/viewthread/253/\n\nhttp://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/06/a_tribute_to_on.php\n\nOwsley Stanley appears at '67 drug arraignment. Chronicle photo, 1967\n\nCredit: Chronicle Photo\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_Stanley\n\nOwsley Stanley (born Augustus Owsley Stanley III, January 19, 1935) also known as The Bear, was an underground LSD cook, the first to produce large quantities of pure LSD.\n\nHis total production is estimated at around half a kilogram of LSD, or roughly 5 million 100-microgram \"hits\" of normal potency, although accounts vary widely. The widespread and low-cost (often given away free) availability of Stanley's high-quality LSD in the San Francisco area in the mid-1960s may have been crucial for the emergence of the hippie movement during the Summer of Love in the Haight-Ashbury area, which one historian of that movement, Charles Perry, has described as \"one big LSD party.\" Stanley was also an accomplished sound engineer, and the longtime soundman and financier for seminal psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead.\n\nStanley designed some of the first high-fidelity sound systems for rock music, culminating in the massive \"Wall of Sound\" electrical amplification system used by the Grateful Dead in their live shows, at the time a highly innovative feat of engineering, and was involved with the founding of high-end musical instrument maker Alembic Inc and the pre-eminent concert sound equipment manufacturer Meyer Sound. The combination of his notoriety in the psychedelic scene and his reclusive tendenciesin part cultivated to confuse the authorities; he avoided being photographed and refused to be interviewed for many yearsled to the perpetuation of many inaccurate tales about him.\n\n...\n\nEarly life\n\nWhen Stanley was twenty-one, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1956 and served for eighteen months before being discharged in 1958. Later, inspired by a 1958 performance of the Bolshoi Ballet, he began studying ballet in Los Angeles, supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer.[1] In 1963, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene. He dropped out after a semester, took a technical job at KGO-TV, and began producing LSD in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus. His makeshift laboratory was raided by police on February 21, 1965. He beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment. The police were looking for methamphetamine, but found only LSDwhich was not illegal at the time.\n\nStanley moved to Los Angeles to pursue the production of LSD. He used his Berkeley lab proceeds to buy 800 grams of lysergic acid monohydrate, the basis for LSD. His first shipment arrived on March 30, 1965. He produced 300,000 capsules (270 micrograms each) of LSD by May 1965 and then returned to the Bay Area.\n\nIn September 1965, Stanley became the primary LSD supplier to Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters; by this point Sandoz LSD was hard to come by and \"Owsley Acid\" had become the new standard. He was featured (most prominently his freak-out at the Muir Beach Acid Test in November 1965) in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, a book detailing the history of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters by Tom Wolfe. Stanley attended the Watts Acid Test on February 12, 1966 with his new apprentice Tim Scully and provided the LSD.\n\n| ---------------------\n\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/20565623/storming-heaven-american-dream\n\nStorming Heaven - LSD & The American Dream\n\nAuthor: Jay Stevens\n\n...\n\nOwsley's scientific aptitude gained him admittance to the University of Virginia's School of Engineering. He lasted a year. By 1956 he was in the Air Force. He spent eighteen months at Edwards Air Force Base, in the high desert plateau east of Los Angeles, specializing in\n\nelectronics and radar.\n\nAfter his discharge, he moved to Los Angeles, where the electronics boom was just beginning, and spent the next few years drifting from job to job, never making more than eight thousand dollars a year, and never really exercising the intellect he knew he possessed.\n\nDuring these years Owsley married, divorced, and remarried in a Tijuana ceremony that was later invalidated. He fathered a child, moved back with his first wife and then out again\"just a little boy afraid to grow up, a Peter Pan,\" one of his wives later told a reporter.4\n\nIn 1963 he was arrested for writing $645 dollars worth of bad checks, for which he received a suspended sentence and three years' probation.\n\nAfter his trial ended, Owsley decided to take another crack at college, this time at Berkeley. He rented a room in a cheap boarding-house that catered to students and ex-students and began \"moving in boxes full of such stuff as ballet shoes, a complete beekeeper's outfit and a painting in progress that showed the arm of Christ on the cross, portrayed more or less from a Christ's-eye view.\"5 Whatever competition he had as \"house eccentric\" was soon routed.\n\nOwsley wrote poetry, studied Russian, drew strange but technically acceptable pictures, was a ballet enthusiast and an electronics nut. He was a sharp but eccentric dresser, a bit of a dandy, and he preferred to be known by his nickname. Bear. He reminded housemate\n\nCharles Perry of a character in William Burroughs's Naked Lunch, the one who \"has a theory on everything, like what kind of underwear is healthy.\"6 Some of his theories were truly brilliant, others merely weird, but he defended them all with a tenacity that was wearing on\n\nthose who thought the whole thing was about becoming mellow, hanging out, absorbing and contemplating. But if Owsley was hyperopinionated, he wasn't a bully about it. \"There was something disinterested and nobly intentioned in his relentless enthusiasms. And his ideas were never boring,\" remembered Perry.\n\nOwsley never ate dinner with us because he was antivegetarian. He argued that since the human race is descended from carnivorous apes, our digestive system is designed for meat alone, and vegetables are slow poison. Once when we smoked some hashish and developed a case of the munchies, he accused me of trying to poison him with apple pie. \"I haven't had any plant food in my system for years,\" he groused between mouthfuls. \"My digestion will be f_cked up for a month.\"7\n\nHe lasted a semester at Berkeley before quitting to take a technical job at KGO-TV. On the surface it seemed he was settling back into his habitual rut, and indeed he might have but for two additional factors. The first was his discovery of LSD. What happened to Owsley in the Other World we can only surmise from the reports of others.\n\nTim Leary, in his incomparable style, wrote how Owsley had \"taken the full LSD trip, hurled down through his cellular reincarnations, disintegrated beyond life into pulsing electronic grids, whirled down beyond atomic forms to that unitary center that is one, pure, radiant, humming vibration.\"8 And when he whirled back up he was no longer the dilettante artist, the brilliant f**k-up.\n\nOwsley returned with a mission: he was going to save the world by making the purest and cheapest and most abundant LSD possible.\n\nAnd this was where the second factor became important. By the purest chance, Owsley had just begun a romance with a chemistry graduate student at Berkeley named Melissa.\n\nOwsley's first lab was in the bathroom of a house near the Berkeley campus. There is some evidence that in addition to LSD, he was also making Methedrine. At least this was what the police thought when they raided the house in February 1965, and confiscated a chemical that may or may not have been an intermediate step toward LSD. It wasn't Methedrine, in any case, although that is what the police decided to charge him with.\n\nOwsley's reaction to the bust became the foundation of his legend. Instead of panicking, he hired Arthur Harris, the deputy mayor of Berkeley, as his lawyer, and Harris quickly got the case thrown out on the grounds that no Methedrine had been found. But Owsley wasn't\n\ncontent with simple vindication. Once the charges were dropped, Owsley turned around and successfully sued the police for the return of all his confiscated laboratory equipment. Then he disappeared.\n\nHe surfaced briefly in Alexandria, Virginia, where he contacted his family. \"He was only four miles away but we spoke on the phone,\" his father later told a reporter. \"He got mad at me, tried to tell me booze is worse [than drugs]. I told him to wash his hands and come back\n\nand talk to me about it We haven't had a pleasant relationship. We're not in accord with what he's doing. His life is divorced from ours. He's had two wives and a child by each and lives with another woman. When he came here with that floozy I wouldn't let him in.\"9 As a\n\nparting shot, AOS2 described his son as \"emotionally unbalanced, but has a brilliant' mind.\"\n\nLos Angeles became Owsley's new base of operations. He formed a company called Bear Research Group and began ordering the necessary chemicals for synthesizing LSD. Using the Bear Research cover, he purchased substantial quantities of lysergic monohydrate, the essential ingredient in the LSD synthesis. All told he accumulated 800 grams500 from Cycio Chemical and 300 from International Chemical and Nuclear Corpsigning, in both instances, affidavits to the effect that the chemicals would be used for research purposes only. He paid cashtwenty thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills to Cycio alone, which suggested that the Berkeley factory, despite its short lifespan, had been more lucrative than anyone supposed.\n\nOwsley received his first shipment of lysergic monohydrate on March 30, 1965. By May he had turned it into LSD. His method of distribution was largely word of mouth, which may be why the police once again learned of his clandestine lab. Unbeknownst to Owsley, Captain Alfred Tremblay, commander of the Los Angeles narcotics division, was emptying his garbage cans at regular intervals. Among the items Tremblay retrieved were several order forms, one of which came from Portland, Oregon, with a request for forty capsules and a\n\npostscript: \"love to Melissa.\"10\n\nA year later Owsley's garbage would be prominently displayed during Tremblay's Congressional testimony. But by then Owsley had vanished from Tremblay's turf. As soon as his first run was complete he returned to San Francisco, where he amazed his old\n\nhousemates with the fact that he had actually made his own LSD. According to Charles Perry, Owsley's first product was \"devastatingly strong in an almost heavy-handed way that recalled Owsley's own insistent manner.\" Like the Pranksters, Owsley's psychedelic perspective contained a lot of machismo; he was always taunting his friends to \"take two and really cut loose into the cosmos.\"11\n\nOwsley learned of Kesey sometime in the summer of 1965, setting the stage for their fateful meeting in the early morning hours after the aborted Beatles party. Fateful because without Owsley the Acid Tests probably would never have taken place, for the simple reason that LSD was too difficult to obtain. The dream of handing out thousands of doses was just that, a fantasy, or had been until that cocky little boho materialized out of the crowd of teenyboppers and said, \"I'm Owsley.\"\n\nThis was the second bar in the Owsley legend: he was the Pranksters' chemist.\n\nFlush with money, Owsley became the counterculture's most benevolent patron, buying sound equipment for indigent bands like the Grateful Dead and bankrolling the Haight's first newspaper, the San Francisco Oracle. According to his old housemate, Charles Perry, Owsley's Berkeley hideout frequently resembled a medieval court, with \"a regular retinue of petitioners present[ing] themselves like serfs pleading for boons from the King. I can still see Owsley listening warily but regally to their requests, enthroned in the nude on a huge fur-covered chair, drying his hair with a hair dryer.\"12 Owsley's personal enthusiasms, always exotic, became even grander. He collected oriental rugs and state-of-the-art electronics. He kept an owl, which he fed live mice. He made personalized perfumes, mixing the essences to suit his interpretation of the recipient's personality.\n\nIf Owsley didn't invent the hippie dealer look, he certainly perfected it, with his elaborate turquoise belts and handtooled\n\nboots. Food was another of his passions, and he enjoyed entertaining his entourage at various fine restaurants. The price of the meal was usually an Owsley soliloquy, either on the subject of antivegetarianism or else his famous LSD rap, a marathon romp through\n\nEinsteinian physics and Buddhist philosophy, which added up to one large apercu: the Divine Force had given mankind LSD to counteract the discovery of nuclear fission.\n\n| -------------------\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/scully_tim/scully_tim.shtml\n\nTim Scully\n\nAug 27, 1944 -\n\nSummary\n\nTim Scully is best known in the psychedelic underground for his work in the production of LSD from 1966 to 1969, for which he was indicted in 1973 and convicted in 1974. His best known product, dubbed \"Orange Sunshine\", was considered the standard for quality LSD in 1969. Scully worked with Owsley Stanley and Nick Sand in the late 1960s.\n\nDuring his LSD manufacturing career, Scully worked in four labs (documented in his 1973 trial):\n\nWith Bear (Owsley) in a Pt.
