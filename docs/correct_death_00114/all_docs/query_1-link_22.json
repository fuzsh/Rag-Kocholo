        "text": "1942 - November 16, 1979\n\nTwiggs Lyndon was road manager for the Allman Brothers Band, but also worked for Little Richard, Otis Redding, and, later, for the Dixie Dregs.\n\nThe Allman brothers played two packed shows at a Buffalo, New York club named Aliotta's on April 29th, 1970. When the road crew arrived the next afternoon to pick up the band's gear, the owner met them and refused to pay, claiming that the band had shown up late for the show.\n\nTwiggs, the Allman Brother's tour manager, was called to the club to speak with the club's owner, Angelo Aliotta. An argument and scuffle apparently ensued. Aliotta was stabbed three times with a ten-inch knife, causing fatal injuries. Lyndon was arrested at the scene and charged with first-degree murder. He spent 18 months in a Buffalo jail awaiting trial. The book, Skydog: The Duane Allman Story contains an interesting account of these events.\n\nDuring the murder trial, Lyndon's lawyers argued that he had been temporarily insane at the time of the incident; touring with the Allman Brothers, they declared, would drive anyone insane. To demonstrate the point, bassist Berry Oakley was called to the stand and, though he was barely coherent and had to run to the bathroom several times to vomit, he did manage to answer a few questions:\n\n\"Did you take any dope in the last month?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"In the last week?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah.\"\n\n\"What about the last hour?\"\n\n\"You bet.\"\n\nIncredibly, Lyndon was acquitted.\n\nThe Allman's live album At Fillmore East was released during this period. The Allman Brothers liked to include the road crew in band activities, including the photo shoot for this album cover. Since Twiggs was in jail and unavailable for the shoot (with famous Rock 'n' Roll photographer Jim Marshall) Lyndon's photo was superimposed over the roadie group photo that appears on the back of the album's cover.\n\nIn addition to other contributions to the Allman Brothers, Twiggs designed the album cover for the band's Win, Lose or Draw album. The artwork depicts an interior shot of a deserted Old West saloon: \"A poker table topped with half-empty whiskey bottles, cards, and chips sits front and center, surrounded by six empty chairs representing the then-current members.\" Two empty chairs lean against a table in the background, representing past members Duane Allman and Berry Oakley.\n\nTwiggs died in 1979 in a parachute jump at an upstate New York airport. In the book, Midnight Riders: The Story of The Allman Brothers Band by Scott Freeman, the author noted: \"Lyndon was the veteran of three hundred jumps. He stepped out of an airplane at 8,500 feet, his chute never opened and Twiggs was killed on impact. He was 37. Although it was impossible to know, a lot of people suspected suicide. They said Twiggs had never been the same after Duane Allman and Berry Oakley died, and the irony was inescapable-the airport was in a little town named Duanesburg.\"\n\nIn an August 2000 interview in Goldmine magazine, guitarist Steve Morse states: \"Anybody who said it wasn't an accident, first of all, wasn't there and is just trying to romanticize this crap. I spent all night driving and talking to Twiggs about everything. I spent a lot of time with him right before he went into the plane. I also spent hours, days, weeks, months talking about parachute jumps with him. I even dropped him out of one of my planes so he could make an appointment. Instead of landing, he would just jump.\"\n\nTo add to the irony, the Dixie Dregs first major label release, 1977's Freefall (Capricorn Records) features cover art showing Twiggs and the band jumping from an airplane!\n\n09/27/197926Jimmy McCullochWingsHeart Failure (drug related)London, England"
