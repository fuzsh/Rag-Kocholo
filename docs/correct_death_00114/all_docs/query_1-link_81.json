Well, yes, it could have been.Charles does sound English, doesn't it? Their prince is named Charles, isn't he?.\n\nA bright circumpolar asterism of the northern sky, said to resemble a wagon or cart. It is part of the constellation Ursa Major and includes the seven stars Dubhe, Merak, Phecda, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid\n\nDown from the heights reels the glittering Cassiopeia as the hours wear on, while Charles’ Wain lumbers up from behind the vapour-soaked swamp trees that sway in the night-wind.\n\nAn obsession, especially one that keeps intruding irrelevantly into other matters\n\nIt is characteristic of Cobbett that he could always be relied on to produce conjuror-like from any subject one of his many King Charles' heads."
