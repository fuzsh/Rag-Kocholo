DEDlCATiOnS 1968 This manuscript was entrusted to: My Beloved Daughter, Susan Leary and to My Beloved Son, Jack Leary 1995 Now the manuscript is passed, by them, to: Dieadra Martino Ashley Martino Sara Brown Brett Leary Annie Leary Davina-Susana Martino iv High Priest ♦ Timothy Leary William Burroughs ORJGlnAL ACKnOWLEDGEMEnTS the events related in this history reflect the collective consciousness and collaborative behavior of several thousand people— spiritual researchers who have shared dark confusions and bright hopes, given their emotion, muscle, brain, and risked scorn and social isolation to pursue the psychedelic yoga. Homage and gratitude to these fellow explorers. Richard Alpert and Ralph Metzner have participated in every phase of the long ascent and continue to climb higher. His-story is their story. Three tender elvish flowers, Rosemary Woodruff, Susan Leary, and Jack Leary, have endured the harshest ordeals of the journey— at home and in prison— and have survived, blossoming. Loving thanks to the psychologists and religious philosophers who have coun- seled at our centers in Cambridge, Boston, Zihuatanejo, Antigua, Millbrook, and Manhattan. The original art for this manuscript is the illuminated work of Allen Atwell and Michael Green. The editorial acts of love were performed by Susan Firestone, Lorraine Schwartz, and Jean McCreedy. The psychedelic revolution is a religious renaissance of the young, for the young, by the young. This volume presents Old Testament background for the new witness of those born after 1946, children of the Atomic Age. The authentic priests, the real prophets of this great movement are the rock- and-roll musicians. Acid-rock is the hymns, odes, chants of the turned-on love gen- eration. For the first time in history, teen-agers (our new advanced mutant species) have written their own songs, beat their own rhythm, created their own religion.

This volume presents Old Testament background for the new witness of those born after 1946. . . .\" Thus, 27 years ago, did we pompously, parentally, announce the Birth of the Baby Boomers! So Pass out the Loaded Cigars. Here's more '68 pulpit-parent sermonizing. \"The authentic priests, the real prophets oF this great movement are the rock-and-roll musicians. . . . For the First time in history (!), teen-agers (our new advanced mutant species) have written their own songs, beat their own rhythm, created their own religion.\" And then came the solemn-inspirational Locker-Room Exhortation. \"The work oF the psychedelic scholar-politicians (described in this history) is over. . . .\" With love and confidence we turn our work and our planet (?) over to the young and their prophets: (the rock n rollers). x High. Priest * Timothy Leary The 1968 edition celebrated 19 rock groups: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Monkees, etc. Ok. These pronouncements were breathless, pious, embarrassingly grandiose. But they did lurch in the right direction. The inevitable future. The '60s Youth Movement did change human culture. It did, among other things, popularize-legitimize this astonishing concept of \"New Generation\" as a major cultural issue. Globally. GENERATIONALISMO! It is hard for us to realize that this concept that each generation of Teen- Agers Re-Creates a New Culture was not a major historical force before the 20th Century. For example, in the slow-witted 1975 edition of \"The New (?) Columbia Encyclopedia\" the only reference to this explosive word refers to the \"Generation of 1898\", in Spain! jhE GAY 90s BOHEMIANS WEI\\E NOJ JEENE^S My charming, elegant, educated, worldly, Irish-Catholic grandparents, Sarah Rooney S Dennis Leary, did not imagine that they belonged to a \"generation\". Dutiful Catholic teen-agers of the Victorian Age, 1860-1890, danced, dressed, courted the way their parents (and the Protestants) did. Polkas & Waltzes! And their coming-of-age trips were not to Woodstock or Katmandu. Like the Protestants they read about in the papers, they dutifully sailed to Europe on the traditional Cunard steamships and made the classical, obligatory \"trips\" to the Louvre, the Vatican Museums and the Opera Houses. THE LOST GENERATION OF THE '20s Just recently I learned that my sophisticated Aunt Betty died in 1923 of a cocaine overdose! Betty in her scandalous trips to Paris, New York and Reno (for a semi-legal divorce) was a \"hell-raising\", \"whoopee\", sophisticated \"flapper\". A duti- ful member of the Roaring '20s counter-culture: THE \"LOST\" GENERATION. New) Acknowledgements xi This catchy term was invented by a certain Gertrude Stein, an astute, brave, scientifically-trained sister who flaunted lesbian credentials and courageously glo- rified the concept of Counter-Culture. My darling, beloved parents, Abigail 8 Timothy, were part of this new culture. These pious, prudish, patriotic, middle-class Catholics openly swigged the major illegal drug of the time! And they smoked cigarettes (not in public, for ladies, of course). Abby and Tote belonged to the first cohort to understand generational differ- ences. They called it \"progress\", i.e. Model T Fords, canned goods, lip-stick(I). My parents (silently) knew they were different from their parents. They were the first generation in human history to listen to radio and talk via electric wires. They smoked and drank like the film stars. Their Radio Broadcasts were lec- tures or symphony concerts. They were \"teened\" too soon to be imprinted by Decca Records playing Jazz and Dixieland. Television? No way! My parents stubbornly rejected TV like suspicious primi- tives. The way Literary People today fear computers. It is interesting to recall that those magic terms BOHEMIANS 8 LOSJ GENE^AJION were applied to upper-middle-class adults. F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound, Mabel Dodge, D.H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, Ford Maddox Ford, Georgia O'Keeffe, the Expressionist painters, the jazz musicians. None of these \"avant-garde\", cultural innovators were \"teen-agers\". GEN 1: THE SPOCK PARENTS For example, the psychedelic experiences described in High PRjESf were organized and made credible by people who \"teened\" 1920-1940. The quaint, schol- arly attitude of this book emerged from sages like Walter Clark, Frank Barron, Aldous S Laura Huxley, Gordon Wasson, Arthur Koestler, Allen Ginsberg, Harry Murray, Houston Smith, Sri Gayatri Devi, Alan Watts, William S. Burroughs, And me. In i960 we Middle-Aged, Middle-Class, Naive, White, Harvard Faculty Intellectuals expected that psychedelic drugs would be used by Academic Scholarly Adults who had read William James (\"Varieties of Religious Experience\") and the Pop-Hindu and Pop-Bhuddist texts. Our mission was to train graduate students to xii High Priest + Timothy Leary Alan Watts High Priest + Timothy Leary xiii use psychedelic drugs as tools for research, psychotherapy and mystical experi- ences. It never occurred to us that a new post-war generation who grew up with Television would use psychedelics as a rite-of-passage. Turn On. Fine Tune. Off-On, Drop Out. We indulgent parents unwittingly produced: GEN 2: BABY BOOMERS The Woodstock Generation shocked and scorned us \"square\" parents. Then, in turn, the Hippies grew up and produced children. GEN 3: THE SKEPTICAL YUPPIES And these Disco-Punkers of the cocaineyos and the booze-crack '80s grew up scorning their hippy-dippy parents. And now, in the 1990s we welcome the next New Breed! GEN 4: THE SUPER SKEPTICAL SCREEN-AGE NET-SURFERS Today, with wary anticipation, we watch this mysterious info-matic new breed, in front of computer screens, feeding neuro-enriched light-waves to their hungry brains. Fine-tuning, scanning, melding, morphing technicolored Screen Images. Linked into the InterNet, exchanging new light-speed realities. May we humbly hope that they will up-load a few shards and fragments of these archaeological Hi^h Priest chips and around ten other story- books by the author on the World Wide Web.

Priest ♦ Timothy Leary Allen Ginsberg FOREWORD BY ALLEfl GlnSBERfi By the late '40s of this memory Century the people I knew best and loved most had already broken thru the crust of old Reasons S were dowsing for some Supreme Reality, Christmas on Earth Rimbaud said, Second Religiousness according to Spengler's outline of civilization declining through proliferation of non-human therefore boring technology; Blake had called \"0 Earth 0 Earth return!\" centuries before, echoing the ancient gnostic prophecy that Whitman spelled out for America specifically demanding that the Steam-engine \"be confronted and met by at least an equally subtle and tremendous force-infusion for purposes of spiritualization, for the pure conscious, for genuine aesthetics, and for absolute and primal manliness and woman- liness—\" Ezra Pound's mind jumped to diagnose the dimming of the world's third Eye: \"With Usura the line grows thick.\" One scholar who transmitted Blake's kabbalah, S. Foster Damon, could remember his sudden vision of tiny flowers carpeting Harvard Yard violet before World War One, an image that lingered over 60 years in mind since his fellow student Virgil Thomson gave him the cactus peyote to eat. Damon concluded that rare beings like Blake are born with physiologic gift of vision, continuous or intermittent. William James, whose pragmatic magic probably called the Peyote God to Harvard in the first place, had included shamanistic chemical visions among the many authentic \"Varieties of Religious Experience.\" His student Gertrude Stein experimented in alteration of consciousness through mindfulness of language, an extremely effective Yoga since mechanical reproduction of language by XX Century had made language the dominant vehicle of civilized consciousness; her companion Alice B. Toklas contributed a cookbook recipe for Hashish Brownies to enlighten those persons over-talkative in drawing rooms unaware that \"the medium is the message.\" This synchronism is exquisite: William S. Burroughs also once of Harvard shared Miss Stein's mindfulness of the hypnotic drug-like power of language, and collaborated on cut-up rearrange- ment of stereotyped language forms with friend Brion Gysin, who had originally given Miss Toklas the recipe for her famous Brownies. Burroughs among others had begun experiments with drug- shamanism after World War Two— for the author of \"Naked Lunch\" it was a pragmatic extension of his Cambridge interest in linguistic Anthropology. That same gnostic impulse broke through to clear consciousness simultaneously in many American cities: Gary Snyder realized the entire uni- verse was alive one daybreak 1948 in Portland when a flight of birds rose out of the stillness in a xviii High Priest ♦ Timothy Leary gully by the city river, a natural vision —The masters of the Berkeley Renaissance read Gertrude Stein aloud and practiced Poetic kabbalah (charming synchronism that psychologist Timothy Leary met poets Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan in that same 1948 student scene)— Neal Cassady drove Jack Kerouac to Mexico in a prophetic automobile to see the physical body of America, the same Denver Cassady that one decade later drove Ken Kesey's Kosmos-patterned schoolbus on a Kafka- circus tour over the roads of the awakening nation— And that wakening began, some say, with the first saxophone cry of the new mode of black music which shook the walls of white city mind when Charles Parker lifted his birdflightnoted horn 8 announced a new rhythm of thinking, an extended breathing of the body in music and speech, a new consciousness. For as Plato had writ, \"When the mode of the music changes, the walls of the city shake.\" The new consciousness born in these States can be traced back through old gnostic texts, visions, artists, 8 shamans; it is the consciousness of our ground nature suppressed 8 desecrated. It was always the secret tale of the tribe in America, this great scandal of the closing of the doors of perception of the Naked Human Form Divine. It began with the white murder of Indian inhabitants of the ground, the theft and later usurious exploitation of their land, it continued with an assault on all races and species of Mother Nature herself and concludes today with total disruption of the ecology of the entire planet. No wonder black slaves kept for non-human use into this century in tear-gassed ghettos of megalopolis were the first Aliens to sound the horn of Change, the first Strangers to Call the Great Call through Basilides' many Heavens. Amazing synchronism again, that Mr. Frank Takes Gun, Native American Church amerindian Peyote Chief, invited the brilliantly talk- ative silver-haired psychiatrist who directed a Saskatchewan mental hospital in the 1940's to partic- ipate in a Peyote ritual, and that same Dr. Humphrey Osmond having recognized a wonder of con- sciousness thus experienced passed on the catalyst in Mescaline synthetic form to Aldous Huxley; and that Huxley's 1945 essay on the chemical opening of the Doors of Perception found its way to the tables of Bickford's Cafeteria Times Square New York 8 the couches of Reed College and Berkeley, where artist persons, having heard the Great Call of the African American, already initiat- ed themselves en masse to subtle gradations of their own consciousness experienced while smok- ing the same Afric hemp smoked by Charles Parker Thelonious Monk 8 Dizzy Gillespie. Dr. Timothy Leary takes up his part of the tale of the tribe in a Mexican hut and brings his discovery to Harvard harmoniously— and there begins the political battle, black and white magic become public visible for a generation. Dr. Leary is a hero of American consciousness. He began as a sophisticated academician, he encountered discoveries in his field which confounded him and his own technology, he pursued his studies where attention commanded, he arrived beyond the boundaries of public knowledge. One might hesitate to say, like Socrates, like Galileo?— poor Dr. Foreword xix Leary, poor Earth! Yet here we are in Science Fiction History, in the age of Hydrogen Bomb Apocalypse, the very Kali Yuga wherein man's stupidity so overwhelms the planet that ecological catastrophe begins to rehearse old tribes-tales of Karmaic retribution, Fire 8 Flood 8 Armageddon impending. It would be natural (in fact deja vu) that the very technology stereotyping our consciousness 8 desensitizing our perceptions should throw up its own antidote, an antidote synthetic such as LSD synchronous with mythic tribal Soma 8 Peyote. Given such historic Comedy, who could emerge form Harvard technology but one and only Dr. Leary, a respectable human being, a worldly man faced with the task of Messiah. Inevitable! Not merely because the whole field of mental psycholo- gy as a \"science\" had arrived at biochemistry anyway. It was inevitable because the whole profes- sional civilized world, like Dr. Leary, was already faced with the Messianic task of accelerated evo- lution (i.e., psychosocial Revolution) including an alteration of human consciousness leading to the immediate mutation of social 8 economic forms. This staggering realization, psychedelic, i.e., con- scious expanding 8 mind-manifesting in itself, without the use of chemical catalysts, was then forced on all of us by images of our own unconscious rising from the streets of Chicago, where city tear gas was dumped on Christ's very Cross in Lincoln Park AD 1968. The drains are backing up in the cities, smog noise and physiologic poison in food turn us to insect acts, overpopulation crazes the planet, our lakes corrupt, old riverways become dark fens, tanks entered Prague and Chicago streets simultaneous, Police State arrives in every major city, starvation wastes African provinces, Chinese genocide in Tibet mirrored American genocide in Vietnam, Alarm! Alarm! howls deep as any Biblic prophecy. Ourselves caught in the giant machine are conditioned to its terms, only holy vision or tech- nological catastrophe or revolution break \"the mind-forg'd manacles.\" Given one by-product of the technology that might, as it were by feed-back, correct the berserk machine and liberate the inven- tor's mind from captivity by hypnotic robots, Dr. Leary had in LSD an invaluable civilized elixir. For, as Dr. Jiri Roubichek observed early in Prague (\"Artificial Psychosis,\" 1958), \"LSD inhibits condi- tioned reflexes.\" And this single phrase, for rational men, might be the key to the whole gnostic mystery of LSD and Dr. Leary's role as unique, alas solitary, courageous, humane 8 frank Democratic Boddhisatva-teacher of the uses of LSD in America. For he took on himself the noble task of announcing the evidence of his senses despite the scary contumely of fellow academicians, the dispraising timorous irony of scientific \"professionals,\" the stupidity meanness self-serving cowardice and hollow vanity of bureaucratic personnel from Harvard Yard to Mexico City to Washington, from the violent-mouthed burglar-Prosecutor G. Gordon Liddy working with the igno- rant Sheriff's Office in Dutchess County NY to the inner greedy sanctums of the US Treasury xx High Rriest ♦ Timothy Leary Department in D.C., our whole \"establishment\" of civilization that defends us from knowledge of our own unconscious by means of policemen's clubs, and would resist the liberation of our minds and bodies by any brutish means available including teargas, napalm 8 the Hydrogen Bomb. Dr. Leary conducted himself fairly 8 equitably, given the extremity of his knowledge, it took an innocent courage to explore his own unconditioned consciousness, to take LSD and other chem- icals often enough to balance praxis as well as explanation, and to attempt to wed the enormity of his experience to Reason. An heroic attempt to communicate clearly and openly through civilized technologic media to his fellow citizens, despite centuries of identity brainwash accelerated now to mass paranoia and Cold War Apocalypse, required of Dr. Leary the proverbial wisdom of serpent 8 harmlessness of dove. Timothy Leary tells the tale of his tribe in book aptly titled The Politic* Ofj Cc6ta&y, 8 events enlarged since he wrote his book and chose its title charge the author's handiwork with prophetic enormity. The battle of generations that erupted in 1968 simultaneously in Prague, Chicago, Mexico City, Paris, New York (and Moscow underground)— everywhere the State's electronic consciousness was interlinked— transcended antique battles of Cold War and Race. We witnessed planetary con- frontation wherein controlling Elders trapped in a suicidal mechanical consciousness deployed their destructive technology against their own children in the streets of their own cities. 'Tis Blake's Urizen tormenting tender Los in Eternity! New generations have risen spontaneous with new consciousness and a mutant politics of flower power that is rooted in the ground of human consciousness itself: an acceptance of human identity as one with green living nature on a living planet where all creatures are a living God. The public philosophies and technologies of all civi- lized Governments at present are at war with this God, and the planet itself is within decades of destruction. No wonder there was sudden appearance of Adamic hair. Eve walked naked in the streets; ancient body-rhythms beat out thru the airwaves in electric mantric Rock from Bratislava to San Francisco, 8 youths ingested shamanistic elixirs to recover consciousness of planetary arche- types. One politic synchronism that concerns this text should be gossiped forth contextual. Timothy Leary quit public life to write a book in Mexico some years ago but he was searched by Agents of Government as he went to cross borders, arrested for possession of some herb, and thus forced to interrupt his writing, returned to public action, and defend his person by attack from by the State. So he traveled to academies and lectured to the young, 8 thus he paid large legal fees required by the State 8 thus maintained an Ashram of fellow seekers well known in Millbrook. Agents of Government then raided and repeatedly abused the Millbrook Utopia, whereupon Dr. Leary was obliged to be Dr. Leary and lecture more to raise money for his family of imprisoned friends. Foreword xxi Agents of Government concluded this phase of prosecution with a piece of Socratic irony so bla- tantly echoing an old Greek injustice that the vulgar rhetoric of a Tyrannous State would need only be quoted to be recognized, were it not for the fact that these States were then so plagued with Tyrannously inspired chaos and public communication so flooded with images of State Atrocity from the alleys of Saigon to the parks of Chicago that official public conscience here now, as memorably in Russia and Germany, was shocked, dumbed S amnesiac. I quote from the Spring 1968 State Document in any case for the delectation of gnostic Cognoscenti, that is to say myriads of the present young: To Hon. Edw. W. Wadsworth Clerk, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Room 408—400 Royal Street New Orleans, LA 70130 Re: No. 23570 Timothy Leary—Vs— United States of America . . .We are applying for an order from the District Court requiring the Defendant to sur- render to the United States Marshal . . . The appellant continues his publicized activities involving the advocacy of the use of psy- chedelic drugs by students and others of immature judgment and tender years and is regarded as a menace to the community so long as he is at large Very truly yours, Morton L. Sussman United States Attorney By: James R. Gough, Asst. U.S. ATTY. Chief, Appeals Research Division Thus requesting revocation of Dr. Leary's bail'd liberty while his political-religious defense for possession of an herb approached Supreme Court, Agents of Government checked further con- versation with the young. The Millbrook Ashram having been simultaneously dispersed by Agents of Government, his immediate financial responsibilities lightened, Timothy Leary retired back home to Berkeley with his mate and completed his description of The Politics Of Ecstasy. A twin book, High Pr'mt, was also finished in 1968; in Hi$h Prieit Dr. Leary composed letters anecdotes conversations and personal letters together into a number of chapters concerning friends and colleagues in worlds of science and art, 8 presented his history of consciousness-alter- ing drug Fate in the course of a decade's official and unofficial experiments from Mexico thru Harvard thru Millbrook. His prose by now more supple than before, the book's collage structure contains generous exegesis of the persons and events of a psychedelic brotherhood and scientific xx ii High Rriest ♦ Timothy Leary confreres that altered the consciousness of that American decade. Next year his legal appeal reached the Supreme Court, in May 1969 the Law under which he was arrested was ruled unconstitutional. Government attack on his person continued, 8 Dr. Leary was arrested and subsequently tried, convicted and sentenced to ten years without appeal bail by Judge Byron McMillan of Orange County for possession of two marijuana cigarette stubs— planted in his car ashtray by a California policeman. Federal authorities chose to retry Dr. Leary on his Laredo arrest on another technicality, this time not for failure to report natural grass for govern- ment tax, but on the charge of \"transporting\" a smidgeon of marijuana the few hundred yards from the middle of the International Bridge to the Customs Shed where he had been detained years ear- lier. Convicted in Texas trial, our philosopher was sentenced by Judge Ben Connally to ten years also; both sentences set consecutively, bail denied, Dr. Leary at time of this writing was jailed in California from February 19, 1970. Terminology of both judges agreed with government lawyers' boorish language that Dr. Leary was a \"menace to the community.\" Bail denial was successfully appealed in the Texas case, and as of August 7, 1970 bail was (perhaps) to be granted by some Supreme Court for California despite United States Attorney's obnoxious plea that our philosopher \"represents a danger to other persons and to the community.\"* The text of United State* ofl America, Appellee's OPPOSITION TO APPLICATION FOR BAIL PENDING APPEAL contained the following hideous paragraph ii (e) \"Attached hereto as Exhibit D-i is a copy of an article purportedly authored by Timothy Leary in Playboy magazine in which he dis- cussed the facts giving rise to the case at bar, and which bears also upon his aims and activities which are at the basis for the Government's opposition to his release in bail.\" Further documents appended included Dr. Leary's pacifist testimony at the celebrated Chicago Conspiracy trial, 8 news reports of various university lectures including one at Ann Arbor, Michigan early 1971 whereat Dr. Leary discoursed to raise funds for legal appeals for the poet John Sinclair also jailed for several decades and denied appeal bail after conviction for a year earlier for having been entrapped giving two joints to a local bearded agent who'd infiltrated his multiracial Detroit Artists' Workshop. Another disgusting document appended was a secret agent's report to the Laguna Beach Police Department \"concerning additional suspects involved in the BROTHERHOOD OF RELIGIOUS LOVE. Refer to attached report for additional detail.\" Such a hexed country! \"Judge McMillan labeled Leary an insidious and detrimental influence on society,\" quoth LA. Timed February 20, 1970, and a \"pleasure seeking, irresponsible Madison Avenue advocate of the free use of LSD,\" quoth Long Beach Pre&& March 17 same year. Suffering armed fools cheerfully, Dr. Leary's made an exquisite religious covenant in jail. \"Imprinting\" as ontological key is suggested, 8 re-imprinting via Biological mouth-intake (food Foreword xxiii chemistry) is proposed as proper philosophic action. Hardly an affair of State— were we only to know State in theory. Leary's jail texts economically define use and role of LSD; here's formal psy- chological discussion of character-alteration by means of insight-creating drugs, such discussion related to Socrates' discussion at deathbed 8 texts on Catholic Hell Punishment, these juxtaposed with Judiciary reality of Jail society; all accomplished in professional manner with saintly aplomb. What's going on in his head? Day to day observation of Heavy Metal Fix— the inside facts of jail— compassionate shrewd analysis of Charles Manson as jail-conditioned soul. A few gists 8 piths: \"psychopharmacology plus bio-rhythmic sequential analysis— Alchemy 8 Astrology.\" Dr. Leary's notes include disquisitions on Hell from Church Fathers paralleled with prison weather, as if prison were that Hell spoken of old incarnate now in minds of State Judge 8 Jailers— thoughts interleaved with quotations from official rejection letters aren't mailed thru jail walls. Dr. Leary touches a few political nerves— J.E. Hoover \"a 75 year old bachelor virgin.\" (Actually, Sir Tim and Anyone, Hoover, an ear-voyeur, had tapes of ML King, tapes of a \"wild party.\" King was afraid Hoover'd \"do something foolish 8 play it in public.\" He did, to newsmen and various lawmakers and wire service folk— no one was interested in this old queen's tired blackmail— Invasion of priva- cy anyway.) Dr. Leary's jail Note& make a science fiction classic, Orwell come true. As Neal Cassady also'd spent 2 years in San Quentin a decade earlier, entrapped by shifty Narcotics Agents for a joint. An answer to this tough problem of human aggression? Medicine, 3 lumps hashish daily diet 75% of Aggressiveness. This fact courtesy U.S. Arms Control Disarmament experiments Princeton 1970. Dr. Leary was jailed for theory and practice of research on LSD 8 Cannabis. A shame for Harvard, on the Academics of America, 8 on the State. \"His prophecies,\" like those of Hippocrates he paraphrases, \"and his techniques with potions, if become widespread, would totally free each individual from State control and make possible complete liberty of consciousness.\" Dr. Leary had taken the burden of giving honest report of LSD 8 Cannabis in terms more accu- rate 8 harmless than the faked science of the Government Party Hacks 8 therefore his imprison- ment was an act of insult to Science, Liberty, Common Sense, Freedom, Academy, Medicine, Psychology as an Art, and Poetry as a tradition of human mind-vision. Well, jail'd honed him down to rib 8 soul. * Bail was not granted. Dr. Leary left San Luis Obispo jail months later, on his own initiative.-A.G.

Priest + Timothy Leary Richard Alpert Rf-intRQDi/cTion From i960 to 1963 over 200 visionary-drug sessions were guided by the Harvard Psychedelic Research Project. The guides numbered around 40. There were faculty members S graduate stu- dents from the Psychology and Divinity departments. There were, also, a dozen or so distinguished visiting advisors including Allen Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts, William Burroughs, Marshall McLuhan, Charles Mingus, Arthur Koestler, etc. The Harvard Psychedelic Center functioned as a global clearing house for information about self-administered brain-change drugs. Please do not be put off by the ironic title (Priest?) which was suggested by a certain, late-night prankster, Paul Krassner. First let's discuss the playing rules which guided these explorations. The project personalized, humanized, psychologized the basic playing-princi- ples of the new Quantum Psychology: Einsteinian Relativity, Heisenberg Determinacy, Planckian Chaotics, McLuhan Linguistics. 1. Einsteinian Relativity... ...when applied to human behavior, becomes Interpersonal Interactivity. Continual feedback of changing viewpoints. The traditional role of impersonal (Newtonian) scientists setting up experi- ments and measuring the behavior of animal-or-human subjects was outmoded. The new emphasis on Interpersonal Relations and Field Theory was marketed (in various American-British Research Centers ) as Social Psychology, Group Counseling, Gestalt Analysis, Feedback Techniques, Client-Centered Counseling, 12-Step Programs. Hands-On , D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) methods. Patients and therapists formed teams to study the here-now experiences. The Staff acted as coaches, tour guides. The Patients-Subjects were the stars. Our staff did not administer drugs to the subjects. Typically, one or more staff members (guides) would be selected, by lot, to trip with the subjects. We tried to be Interpersonal not Impersonal. xx vi High Priest ♦ Timothy Leary The deal was common-sense-fair-play. We provided Brain-Activating drugs. And we provided books S reports from other trippers. Both guides and tourists planned the Setting and mutually defined the Set, i.e. the goals. Divinity students wanted to have mystical experiences. Prisoners wanted to learn why they messed-up. (Well, in candor, it must be said that most prisoners were happy about getting \"high in the slammer\". They agreed to write reports and fill out score-Boards (questionnaires) about their experiences. The Harvard guides agreed to do the same. This was our main-street understanding of Einstein's Inter- Active, Feed-Back theories. The trips in this book included legendary intellectuals: Aldous Huxley, William Burroughs, Gordon Wasson, Walter Clark, Arthur Koestler, Charles Mingus, Maynard and Flora Lou Ferguson, Frank Barron, Ralph Metzner, Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson. Less renowned, but equally enlightening, were a sophisticated Black Junkie, a witty British adventurer, a Hip Hindu Lady Guru, a real tough Boston-Mafia mur- derer. And three courageous Christian Theologians. My children, Susan and Jack, acted as guides and observers. 2. Heisenberq Determinacy Observers create the realities they inhabit. Viewpoints. Perspectives. The set- ting for each excursion was planned by the trippers. Each voyager returns with different stories to tell. The aim is to take responsi- bility for, and notes about the realities you determine. 3. Planckian Chaotics: The basic nature of the universe, we are told, is indescribable chaotics. Ultra- Complexities which boggle the word-processing mind. Psychedelic drugs apparently activate \"right\" brain circuits which overwhelm, unfocus, dilate, disorder the linear \"left\" brain-mind. (The words \"left\" and \"right\" are metaphorical and not anatomically precise.) Practically, this means you have to dilate your pupils to become a visionary. One of the classic terms for describing this experience is \"ineffable\". Chaotics Reintroduction xxvii cannot be verbalized by the grabbing mind. The least inaccurate metaphor is \"surf- ing\" the accelerated neurological oceans of light-waves. 4. McLuhan Linguistics Quantum Physics defines basic elements as quarks; bits of o-i Information which form temporary clouds of energy-matter. The best way to describe chaotics is to use the media-language of the galaxies (and the brain). Light! VOXLUMINA It is instructive to recall such ancient Hindu-Buddhist words for the \"right brain\" experience as Illumination, Enlightenment, Revelation, Visions. Consider the poetic, lyric, eye-balling words for great moments: head-lights, high-lights, lime-lights, spot-lights, brightness, brilliance, flame, radiating scintilla- tion. Sadly, we realized that books like High priest could produce only squiggly black letters on white paper; words just package-labels for the neuro-retinal events within. We pioneer researchers did try to enlighten our reports. In the early '6os we studied how great religions have used light to dazzle eyes and imprint vulnerable brains of the faithful. Stained glass windows. Candles. Reflecting jewels. Gregorian chants. Bells. So we developed \"light-shows\". They were primitive affairs. Light reflected through bowls of colored jello. Eight slide-projectors producing layers of multi-col- ored swirling images. Three or four sound tracks scrambling ear balls. Now, 30 years later, multi-media digital disks allow us to re-produce-communi- cate psychedelic experiences. Film and CD ROM versions of this book, High Prle&t, are being developed. The Inadequacy oFThis Book The lettered texts presented in the following pages employ some primitive ways of suggesting the confusing, jumbled complexities of the \"turned-on\" brain. Note that each page presents an on-going interplay dialogue between the viewpoints of the author and (in the margins) comments from other sources. xxv Hi High Priest ♦ Timothy Each chapter unfolds in the context of I CHING readings. To hint at the disorder of the psychedelic experience, we have occa- sionally used poetic-scramble and the cut-and-paste methods introduced by William Burroughs, James Joyce and Brian Gysen. You will note (and, perhaps, be amused by) our Breathless Spirituality, our lav- ish use of religious metaphors. Today, of course, we are beginning to use neurological and digital terms to suggest how we can operate our brains. But in 1962 there was no language in American Psychology for these experi- ences. Except the wretched psychiatric litany of hallucination-victim-disease. Drugs like LSD, Mescaline, Psylocybin were called \"psychotomimetic\". Temporary insanity! We intuitively rejected the Disease-Victim model and relied on the classic ter- minology of religious-mystical states. There is a lot of heavy-duty celestial name-dropping. Gods. Sacraments. Miracles. Christs. Buddhists. William Blake. Gilgamesh. St. Johns of the Cross. Divine Rascals. Heavens S Hells. Today we use the metaphors of computers, virtual realities, chaos engineering, neurotransmitters. Turning on, operating and fine-tuning the brain. However, I am proud of the pre-neurological, theological innocence revealed in this book. We were joyfully, reverently recapitulating the metaphors of medieval Soul Engineering. And, looking back, I am proudly aware of the survival principles which guided us. Sense oF humors. Conformance to Laws of Levities. Celebrations of Chaotics. Illuminations, Brain Surfing as team sports. So, whether it's living it or dying it— Always do it: with friends!

Thus the superior man Brings order out of confusion. (IChing) TRIP 1 In the beginning God cre- ated the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep. 00 Nicholas in The Magus by John Fowles: For a while wander into madness. let my mind j bottomless Supposing all my life that last year had been the very opposite of what Conchis so often said — so often, to trick me once again — about life in general. That is, the very opposite of hazard. 00 And God said let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good; and God sepa- rated the light from the darkness. 00 In the beginning was the turn on. The flash, the illumination. The electric trip. The sudden bolt of energy that starts the new system. The turn on was God. All things were made from the turn on and without Him was not any thing made. In this turn on was life; and the life was the light of men. It has always been the same. It was the flash that exploded the galaxies, from which all energy flows. It was the spark that ignites in the mysterious welding of amino-acid strands that creates the humming vine of organic life. It is the brilliant neurological glare that illuminates the shadows of mans mind. The God-intoxicated reve- lation. The Divine union. The vision of harmony, samadhi, satori, ecstasy which we now call psy- chedelic. What happens when you turn on? Where do you go when you take the trip? You go within. Con- sciousness changes. Your nerve endings, neural cameras, cellular memory banks, protein structures become broadcasting instruments for the timeless humming message of God located inside your body. The external world doesn't change, but your experience of it becomes drastically altered. You close your eyes and the thirteen billion cell brain computer flashes multiple kaleidoscopic mes- sages. Symbolic thought merges with sensory explo- sions; symbolic thoughts fuse with somatic-tissue events; ideas combine with memories— personal, cellular, evolutionary, embryonic— thoughts col- lapse into molecular patterns. You open your eyes and you see your tidy tele- vision-studio world of labeled stage-props fusing with sensory, somatic, cellular, molecular flashes. January 1959 00 3 Your nervous system is prepared to register and coordinate up to one thousand million units of flashing information each second. A psychedelic trip lasts from five to twelve hours. Each trip takes off from a stage-set struc- tured by the physical surroundings and the cast of characters present. Each person in the session is a universe of two billion years of protein, protean memories, and sensations. A heady mix. How to describe this multiple, jumbled, rapidly changing process? What do you do after you turn on? The Light shineth in the darkness and the dark- ness comprehendeth it not. You TUNE IN. tune in means to bear witness to the Light, that all men might believe. The turn on bolt shatters structure. Reveals the frozen nature of the artificial stage-set men call reality. Certitude collapses. There is nothing but the energy which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world. E = MC2. We discover we are not television actors born onto the American stage-set of a commercially spon- sored program twenty centuries old. We are two- billion-year-old carriers of the Light, born not just of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of the Light that flashed in the Pre- cambrian mud, the Light made flesh. tune in means that you sit in the debris of your shattered illusions, and discover that there is noth- ing, you are nothing except the bearer of the wire- coil of life, that your body is the temple of the Light and you begin once again to build a structure to preserve and glorify the Light. You bear witness crying, the Sun that comes after me is preferred before me, and your days are spent preparing the earth for the Son to come. That is tuning in. And to tune in you must drop out. drop out means detach yourself tenderly, aes- thetically, harmoniously from the fake-prop studio of the empire game and do nothing but guard and glorify the Light. My first trip came in the middle of the journey of this life (when I was thirty-five years old) and Nicholas in The Magus: I stared at myself. They were trying to drive me mad, to brainwash me in some astounding way. But I clung to reality. 00 And God saw that it was good. 00 From The Magus: I cannot believe Maurice is evil. You will understand. 00 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 00 4 00 Death of the Mind From The Magus: \"I come to tell you that you are now elect.\" I shook my head violently from side to side. \"You have no choice.\" 00 awoke to the consciousness that I was trapped in a dark room, in a hastily constructed, thin-walled stage-prop home in Berkeley, California, and the ribbon of light had been lost. I was a rootless city-dweller. An anonymous insti- tutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars, and drove home each night and drank martinis and looked like and thought like and acted like several million middle- class liberal intellectual robots. Woke up, fell out of dead Made the bus in fleconds flat There was no connection with soil or with my racial past. My clan gods slumbered. My tribal banners were hidden, forgotten in cellular reposi- tories. Then the Lord God said, \"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.\" 00 From The Magus: I turned away again, to try to get her to say more. But she sat in the chair and I felt her eyes on my back. I knew she was sitting there, in her corn-gold chair, and that she was like Demeter, Ceres, a goddess on her throne; 00 How I entered this flimsy stage-set I cannot well recall, so full was I of sleep at the time. I dropped out, taking leave from my job (as Director of Psychological Research for the Kaiser Foundation Hospital) and sailing for Spain on the S.S. Independence, American Export Lines, with my two children, Susan, age nine, and Jack, age seven. We settled in a villa in Torremolinos on the Costa del Sol. There the kids trooped off across the field to school each morning while I stayed home to die messily. The coast of Spain Malaga to Gibraltar is the southernmost part of Europe, and down to this bottom sift and fall the psychological dregs of the Continent— drunken Swedes, cashiered Danes, twisted Germans, sodden British. The main occupation of the Torremolinos colony was drug taking— and the drug was alcohol. Found my way upstairs and had a poke I had brought with me a trunk full of psycho- logical data— thousands of test scores and numer- ical indices which demonstrated with precision why psychotherapy did not work. In America, I had a staff of statisticians and clerks and rooms of calcu- lators and computers to handle the data. But I had said good-bye to all that and sat sweating in a small room in a Spanish house adding and sub- tracting long columns of figures. Hour after hour. 6 00 Death of the Mind Then the man said, \"This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, be- cause she was taken out of man.\" 00 But I just had a book Having read the look It was a brutal yoga. Each laborious calculation was proving that psychology was just a mind-game, an eccentric head trip on the part of psychologists, and that psychotherapy was an arduous, expensive, ineffective, unimaginative attempt to impose the mind of the doctor on the mind of the patient. Each arithmetical index was pushing me farther and farther from my chosen profession. And though the moles were rather small I had to count them all The dying process was slow. I would throw down the ballpoint pen and walk fast to the main street of the village and sit in a bar and drink and talk detached-zombie-fashion with the expatriates and leave abruptly and run back to the house and continue the paralyzing cal- culations, sweating in panic. Now he knows how many moles it takes to fill the Alpert Hall Boredom, black depression, flashes of frantic, restless anxiety. No place to go. / led the news today oh joy And though the views was rather mad In December the rains came and the Mediter- ranean was gray and cold. On Christmas Eve I met a young, runaway prostitute from Valencia and took her home. By New Years I had the clap. From The Magus: \"You may search the house.\" She watched me, chin on hand, in the yellow chair; unnettled; in posses- sion. Of what, I didn't know; but in possession. I felt like a green young dog in pur- suit of a cunning old hare; every time I leapt, I bit brown air. 00 Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to attain form. Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a mans fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark. ( I Ching III ) In the middle of January I moved with the kids to a steam-heated hotel, but Jack's un-house-trained puppy and my distant gloom freaked the owner, so I moved to an apartment tunneled into the rock at the foot of Calle San Miguel. It was a cave with oozing stone walls. The beds were always damp. January 1959 00 7 Well I just had to graph There the break-through-break-down started. It began in the head. One morning my scalp be- gan to itch. By noon it was unbearable. Each hair root was a burning rod of sensation. My hair was a cap of fire. I ran down the beach and cut my feet on rocks to keep from ripping my fingers through my scalp. By evening my face began to swell and huge water blisters erupted from my cheeks. A young Danish doctor came, injected me with a huge needle, and gave me sleeping pills. Somebody broke and 1 went into a steam In the morning I was blind— eyes shut tight by swollen tissue and caked with dried pus. I felt my way to the bathroom, lit a candle, and pried open one eye before the mirror. Broke up, sell out of bed In the oblong glass I saw the twisted, tormented face of an insane stranger. I saw the rotograph A Spanish doctor came and gave me more shots and more sleeping pills. He had never seen such a case before. Jack and Susan crept into the room to look at me with big sorrowful eyes. The bed was cold and soggy but I slept. The third day the disease had spread to my body. Huge watery welts blossomed on my back, stomach, and flanks. Both the Danish and the Spanish doctors shook their heads, and both in- jected me from large metal hypodermics. In the afternoon I hired a taxi and was driven to Malaga to consult the specialist. His eyes bulged and he shook his head and gave me two injec- tions. I'd ove turned you on Before returning to Torremolinos I sat at a side- walk cafe and drank a Coca-Cola. A pretty, young Swedish girl joined me. She was traveling with her parents and was bored and rebellious, hungry for adventure. She steamed with erotic vapor. I looked at her and smiled weakly. See you later. Back at Torremolinos the doctors agreed I should move to a steam-heated hotel. We had to smuggle the dog in. Jack and Susan left to stay with a But the serpent said to the woman, \"You will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\" 00 From The Magus: \"Responsibility!\" I wheeled round on her again. \"Do you really think we do this just for you? Do you really believe we are not . . . charting the voyage?\" 00 But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, \"Where are you?\" And he said, \"I heard the sound of thee in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.\" 00 8 00 Death off the Mind From The Magus: \"With all the necessity of a very complex experiment.\" \"I like my experiments simple.\" \"The days of simple experiments are over.\" 00 sabbatical family from the University of Pennsyl- vania. The Lord God said to the serpent, \"... I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. 00 Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the gar- den of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life. 00 By night the disease had spread to my extrem- ities. My wrists and hands were swollen to arthritic paralysis. My ankles and feet ballooned. I couldn't walk or move my fingers. I sat in the darkness for several hours and then came the scent of decay. Overpowering odor of disintegration. I got up from the chair, but my feet buckled and I fell to my knees. I crawled across the room to the electric switch and pulled myself up to flick on the light. He didn't notice that the frights had changed Jack's puppy had been very sick and a rivulet of yellow shit ran along the floor. We would be ex- pelled from the hotel if the chambermaid found the evidence. I crawled to the bathroom and pulled down a roll of toilet paper. For the next hour I crept along the tile floor cleaning up the mess. It was slimy mucus. The color of peanut butter. I crawled to the bathroom. The toilet didn't work. I crawled to the window which overlooked the back yard of the hotel and heaved out the wad of toilet paper. There were electric wires about four feet below the window and the discolored strings of paper caught on the wires and hung down like banners swaying in the breeze. Flag of my action. Using an umbrella as a cane, I hobbled along the hallway, down the back stairs, and across the rutted muddy back yard. Each step was torture. I fell several times. I stood on a packing crate and flailed at the paper banner like a madman fighting vul- tures. Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative lines; this means that in the chaos of difficulty at the beginning, order is already implicit. So too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite. ( I Ching III ) January 1959 00 9 By the time I wrenched back to the room, two hours had elapsed. I was weak and trembling. I slumped in the chair for the rest of the dark night, wrapped in a Burberry mackintosh. I died. I let go. Surrendered. I slowly let every tie to my old life slip away. My career, my ambitions, my home. My identity. The guilts. The wants. With a sudden snap, all the ropes of my social self were gone. I was a thirty-eight-year-old male animal with two cubs. High, completely free. I could feel some seed of life stirring inside and energy uncoil. When the dawn came I moved my hands. The swelling was gone. I found a pen and paper. I wrote three letters. One to my employers, telling them I was not returning to my job. A second to my insurance agent to cash in my policies. And a third long manuscript to a colleague, spelling out certain revelations about the new psychology, the limiting artifactual nature of the mind, the unfold- ing possibilities of mind-free consciousness, the lib- erating effect of the ancient rebirth process that comes only through death of the mind. The ordeal in Spain was the first of some four hun- dred death-rebirth trips I have experienced since 1958. The first step was non-chemical. Or was it? Conchis in The Magus: He leant forward, after a long silence, and turned up the lamp; then stared at me. \"The disadvantage of our new drama is that in your role you do not know what you can believe and what you cannot.\" 00 DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING: Works supreme success, Furthering through perseverance. Nothing should be undertaken. It furthers one to appoint helpers.

In the fall of 1952 we learned that the 16th cen- tury writers, describing the Indian cultures of Mexico, had recorded that certain mushrooms played a divine role in the religion of the natives. The so-called mushroom stones really represented mushrooms, and that they were the symbol of a reli- gion, like the cross in the Christian religion or the star of Judea or the crescent of the Moslems. I was first drugged out of my mind in Cuernavaca, August i960. I ate seven of the Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico and discovered that beauty, revelation, sensuality, the cellular history of the past, God, the Devil— all lie inside my body, outside my mind. In the days of Montezuma this town called horn- of-the-cow was the center of soothsayers, wise-men, and magicians. Cuernavaca is the southern anchor point of a line running from the fabled volcanic peaks Popo and Iztaccihuatl over to the volcano of Toluca. On the high slopes of the volcanoes, east and west of the capital, grow the Sacred Mushrooms of Mexico, divinatory fungi, Teonanacatl, flesh of the Gods. In the summer of i960 Cuernavaca was the site of considerable activity by American psychologists —soothsayers, medicine men, would-be magicians— from the North— vacationing on research grants and working in the lush valley of Morelos in sight of the snowy peaks of the legendary volcanoes. Erich Fromm was running an experimental proj- ect down the highway, studying the social and emo- tional currents of Indian village life. Over in Tepoztlan, ten miles to the east, Professor David McClelland, on vacation from Harvard, was working on plans to help underdeveloped countries raise their economic standards through psychologi- cal techniques and the Protestant ethic. His statis- tics showed that Catholic, Moslem, Buddhist coun- tries were poor. Elliot Danzig, Mexico's leading industrial psy- chologist, was a few cornfields away in his villa which sits next to the cliff under the altar of the God Tepozteco. It was at this altar, often shrouded in rain clouds, that the Aztecs had worshipped the God, Tepozteco, to drumrolls of the arousing 12 August 1960 00 13 thunder and bolts of lightning, the clinging flame. It was he who showered down blessings including the gift of pulque ... a milky beer fermented from cactus, which contains its own abundance of thunder over the earth. In Cuernavaca another villa served as summer headquarters for four American psychologists- Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert of Harvard, Frank Barron of California, and Richard Dettering of San Francisco. Thus we find a mushroom in the center of the cult with perhaps the longest continuous history in the world. The happenings of that summer in quiet Cuerna- vaca were to set up reverberations which have echoed now for years. Many of the scientists who were working and vacationing there that season have had their lives dramatically changed, and none of them will ever completely escape from the myste- rious power, the challenge, the paradox of what started to unfold. I was working on a book about the philosophy of the behavioral sciences. I was dissatisfied with the theory and methods of psychology and trying to develop an existential-transactional approach to the study of human events. Existential means you study natural events as they unfold without prejudging them with your own concepts. You surrender your mind to the events. Transactional means you see the research situa- tion as a social network, of which the experimenter is one part. The psychologist doesn't stand outside the event, but recognizes his part in it, and works collaboratively with the subject towards mutually selected goals. This philosophic position, when applied, gener- ates a lot of emotion. For one thing, it bypasses the traditional experimenter-subject and doctor-patient relationships. It tells the doctor and the scientist to relax his control. It urges that everyman be his own scientist. Do his own research. It bypasses the con- trolled experiment in favor of the natural sequence of behavior. You don't have to design an experi- ment, Dr. Jones, you are already part of one. The 1967 phenomenon of several million Ameri- cans taking LSD on their own, exploring their own consciousness, doing it themselves, developing their We have found this cult of the divine mushroom a rev- elation, in the true meaning of that abused word, though for the Indians it is an everyday feature, albeit a holy mystery, of their lives. There are no apt words . . . to characterize your state when you are, shall we say, \"Bemush roomed.\" What we need is a vocabu- lary to describe all the modalities of a divine in- ebriant. 14 00 God Reveals Himself These difficulties in com- municating have played their part in certain amus- ing situations. Two psychia- trists who have taken the mushroom and known the experience in its full dimen- sions have been criticized in professional circles as being no longer \"objec- tive.\" Thus we are all divided into two classes: those who have taken the mushroom and are disqualified by our subjective experience and those who have not taken the mushroom and are dis- qualified by their total ig- norance of the subject. I am profoundly grateful to my Indian friends for having initiated me into the tre- mendous mystery of the mushroom. Of alcohol they speak with the same jocular vulgarity that we do. But about mush- rooms they prefer not to speak at all, at least when they are in company and especially when strangers, white strangers, are pres- ent. own methods of turning-on, is nothing less than an existential-transactional revolution in psychology. The professionals— the doctors and the experimen- talists and the government officials— don't like it. The idea of people going out and solving their own problems, changing their own consciousness, irri- tates the doctors. They say it's indiscriminate, un- supervised, uncontrolled, and basically for kicks. They are right. It is and it should be. That's what life itself is. An indiscriminate, unsupervised, un- controlled two-billion-year-old energy dance with ecstatic communion as the goal. These laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. ( I Ching XVI ) The villa in Cuernavaca, which became the back- drop for my mushroom revelations, needs to be described. The setting, the surrounding, is a key factor in the outcome of any visionary voyage whether you use mushrooms or marijuana or LSD or rosary beads, and in this regard the Cuernavaca mushroom eaters were fortunate. The Spanish-style villa was out on the Acapulco road near the golf course. It was a rambling white stucco house with scarlet trim, surrounded by gray stone walls. The walls were pierced by two red-iron scroll gates and there was a long veranda and a wide staircase leading down to a carriage drive. Down below was a sloping lawn ringed by flowers. Two rows of red urns flanked the stairs. The villa had been built by Mexican Moslems and remodeled by Mexican Viennese. It was colorful, open, and lush. Next to the upper terrace was the swimming pool, lake blue, and the lawn fell away downslope to a lower green terraced lawn. The close-cropped turf was thick rough Cuernavaca grass, good to look at but matting into heavy piled green carpet, scraping your bare feet and leaving tattooed welts on your back after you lay on it. August 1960 00 15 The lower lawn was shaded by lacy Ahuehuate trees, and on the walls of the villa, vines, green, splashed with red, yellow, orange, and the clear blue of the mile-high Morelos sky and the lush green of the golf course fairway down below the wall.

A frequent visitor was Gerhart Braun, anthropol- ogist-historian-linguist from the University of Mex- ico. With him would come Joan, his girl friend, and Betty, an English major from the University of California, who wrote poetry and cracked jokes and played touch football with the kids. Gerhart had been studying the Aztec culture and translating old texts written in Nahuatl, the lan- guage used by the Aztecs before the conquest. He had discovered repeated references to the use of Sacred Mushrooms by Aztec soothsayers on cere- monial occasions to predict the future, to feel better, to solve mental problems. On the eve of the Emperor's coronation Mexico City got high on mushrooms. But the Spanish his- torians, most of them priests, rarely mentioned the magic mushrooms. And when they did it was in prudish, frightened terms. Evil! Danger! Fear! Then, when evening and darkness come and you are alone with a wise old man or woman whose confi- dence you have won, by the light of a candle held in the hand and talking in a whisper, you may bring up the subject. They are never exposed in the marketplace but pass from hand to hand by pre- arrangement. The Aztecs before the Spanish arrived called them Teonanacatl, God's flesh. I need hardly remind you of a disquieting para' lei, the designation of the elements in our Eucharist: \"Take, eat, this is my body . . .\", and again, \"Grant us therefore, gra- cious Lord, so to eat the flesh of Thy dear son. . . .\" 16 00 God Reveals Himself The orthodox Christian must accept by faith the miracle of the conversion of the bread into God's flesh: That is what is meant by the Doctrine of Transub- stantiation. By contrast, the mushroom of the Aztecs carries its own conviction; every com- municant will testify to the miracle that he has experi- enced. In the language of the Mazatecs the sacred mush- rooms are called 'nti si tho. The first word, 'nti, is a par- ticle expressing reverence and endearment. The sec- ond element means \"that which springs forth.\" Gerhart's curiosity was aroused and he had asked around about the mushrooms and discovered that they grew on the volcanic slopes near Mexico City. So one day we drove up to the village of San Pedro near the volcano of Toluca and walked around the marketplace asking about the Sacred Mushrooms. Bruce Conner came with us shooting movies, dancing around filming the sides of meat hanging in the butcher shops and the swarms of black flies and the piles of fruit, the sidewalk dis- plays of cloth woven in red and yellow seed and cell designs. There was much thoughtful shaking of heads by the shopkeepers when the mushrooms were men- tioned—and conversation in low Spanish in the back rooms. Old Juana was the one to see. Where did one find Juana? She would come to the market. Wait right here under the arch. She'll come soon. We stood there for an hour while the sandaled market-day crowds padded by. An old woman, backbent, gray stringy hair, black shawl, eyes down, creaking stiffly, Senora Juana. She brushed by us, not responding to our hail, not stopping or looking up at us. She passed through the market street and turned at the corner and walked away from the village. We followed along the rutted dirt road, and on the outskirts of town Gerhart walked faster and caught up with Juana. She stopped and they began to talk. We stood back and waited and watched. Juana seemed to be listening, then she looked up at Gerhart, nodded her head, pointed up to the moun- tain, turned, pointed back to the town, and then started off down the road. Gerhart returned to us smiling. Okay. It's all set. She'll get the mushrooms next Wednesday and I'll meet her in the marketplace next Thursday. The following Thursday Gerhart phoned from Mexico City. Excited. He had met Juana in the market. They had gone away from the tumult of the market to the shade of a church wall. He asked her if she was sure they were safe. She popped two of them in her mouth before his eyes. He washed them in cold water, and they are resting now on the center shelf of his refrigerator. See you Saturday. August 1960 00 17 Saturday, the day of visions, dawned sunny and clear. Around noon Gerhart and his group arrived from Mexico City. Joan and Betty the poet. I met them on the lawn and the group stood in a welcoming circle. My son Jack's iguana, a four- foot dinosaur, crawled up and lay on his belly, blinking his black ancient ebony eyes, and everyone stooped to inspect the long blunt snout, the pat- terned design of his canvas skin, our old friend who crawled up from the crevice of our planet's history and breathed slowly and flicked his lids and watched us live and die. They said he was a hun- dred years old. The maid was surprised when we walked into the kitchen to wash the hongos and she was even more surprised to learn that we weren't planning to cook them. Crudos? Her dark eyes narrowed. Then the resigned shrug. Americans are eccentric. Gerhart had talked with the University botanists and had researched the field thoroughly. So while he supervised the cleaning he started to lecture on the mushrooms. Known and used by the Aztecs. Banned by the Catholic church. Said by leading botanists not even to exist! The trance-giving mush- rooms. Pushed out of history's notice until the last decade when they had been discovered by Weit- linger and Schultes and the American mycologists, Valentina and Gordon Wasson. Pause to clear throat. By now they had been eaten by a few scientists, a few poets, a few intellectuals looking for mystical experiences. They produced wondrous trances. Oh yeah? What does he mean by that? There were two kinds, females and males. The lady mushrooms were the familiar umbrella shape, but black, ominous, bitter-looking. The male's anat- omy was so phallic there was no need to ask why they were called males. Wondrous trances. The words meant nothing. We moved out to the pool. The mushrooms were in two large bowls, male and female separate, on the table under the huge beach umbrella. Gerhart was still lecturing, now about the dosage. Six females and six males. The effect should begin after an hour. Then he stuffed a big, black, moldy-damp mushroom in his mouth and made a face and chewed and I watched his \"The little mushroom comes of itself, no one knows whence, like the wind that comes we know not whence nor why.\" For more than four cen- turies the Indians have kept the divine mushroom close to their hearts, sheltered from desecration by white men, a precious secret. We know that today there are many curanderos who carry on the cult, each ac- cording to his lights, some of them consummate artists, performing the ancient liturgy in remote huts be- fore minuscule congrega- tions. They are hard to reach, these curanderos. Do not think that it is a question of money. 18 00 God Reveals Himself Perhaps you will learn the names of a number of re- nowned curanderos, and your emissaries will even promise to deliver them to you, but then you wait and wait and they never come. You will brush past them in the marketplace, they will know you, but you will not know them. The judge in the town hall may be the very man you are seeking: And you may pass the *ime of day with him, yet jver learn that he is your curandero. After all, would you have it any different? What priest of the Catholic Church will perform mass to satisfy an unbeliever's curiosity? Adam's apple bounce as it went down. Gerhart was voyager number one. I picked one up. It stank of forest damp and crumbling logs and New England basement. Are you sure they are not poisonous? Gerhart shrugged. That's what I asked the old witch and she swore that they were okay and she popped a few in her mouth to demonstrate. I looked around. Joan, following Gerhart's exam- ple, was munching somewhat unhappily. She was explorer number two. Mandy, my girl friend, was miserably chewing. She was number three. Dick Dettering was looking down so that the loose pouches under his eyes sagged. Well, Dicko? He gave a fierce scared look and began to nibble at his palm with squirrelly movement. He was number four. I went next. They tasted worse than they looked. Bitter, stringy. Filthy. I took a slug of Carta Blanca and jammed the rest in my mouth and washed them down. Number five. Poet Betty standing by the edge of the terrace was suddenly vomiting black strings in the bushes. Then she ate more. She was number six. Gerhart was telling us that the males had no effect and served only a ceremonial function. Every- one was listening to his own stomach expecting to be poisoned. Quite a picture, six of us sitting around on the sunlit terrace in our bathing suits waiting, waiting: asking each other, how many did you take? Males or females? Do you feel anything? Two people fasted. Ruth Dettering was eager to eat but she was pregnant and Dick scolded her with froggy harumphs until she agreed to wait. She had been a nurse and I was glad t1 at she was going to be out of trance. I talked to her about how to call for an ambulance and stomach pumps. And Whiskers fasted. Whiskers was a friend of a friend and had arrived the night before. He was slight in build, sweet in demeanor— a sensitive logician just flunked out of Michigan, clipping his words, hesitant, pedantic, anxious about sending a cable to his mother. To his mother? August 1960 00 19 He claimed he suffered from nervous fits and so he passed up the visions. He was sitting next to Gerhart and was dressed in bathing trunks over flowered undershorts, and green garters and black socks and leather shoes and a silken robe. He had been appointed scientist and was taking elaborate notes of Gerhart's reactions. Religion in primitive society was an awesome reality, \"terrible\" in the original meaning of the word, per- vading all life and culmi- nating in ceremonies that were forbidden to the pro- fane. Suddenly I begin to feel Strange. Going under dental gas. Good-bye. Mildly nauseous. Detached. Moving away away away From the group in bathing suits. On a terrace under the bright Mexican sky. When I tell this the others scoff Hah, hah. Him. Power of suggestion. Skepticism? Of my mind? Of me? Of mind? Of my? Oh, now no. No matter. Dettering says he feels it too. Let me point out certain parallels between our Mexi- can rite and the mystery performed at Eleusis. O muses, O great genius, aid me now! O memory that wrote down what I saw, here shall your noble character be shown. ( Inferno II ) Oh my friend. Do you feel tingling in face? Yes. Dental gas? Yes. Slight dizziness? Yes. Exactly.

Viennese analyst. Comic. Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Can't stop. At the heart of the mystery of Eleusis lay a secret. In the surviving texts there are numerous references to the secret, but in none is it revealed. From the writings of the Greeks, from a fresco in Pompeii, we know that the initiate drank a potion. 20 00 God Reveals Himself Then, in the depths of the night, he beheld a great vision, and the next day he was still so awestruck that he felt he would never be the same man as before.
