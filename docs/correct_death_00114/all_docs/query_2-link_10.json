        "text": "Calculation of double energy angle differential neutron albedos for radiation shielding applications\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLitaize, O.; Diop, C.M.; Nimal, J.C.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nVoid radiation shielding problems can be dealt with albedo concept which is an alternative to the complex bringing into operation of the 'exact' transport method calculations (SN, Monte Carlo). Up to here, differential albedos are used for single reflections from walls in the NARCISSE-3 propagation albedo code developed at CEA and used for project calculations. For taking into account the neutron multiple reflections on lacunar medium walls, double energy-angle differential albedos are needed. TRIPOLI-4 neutral particle transport Monte Carlo code in three dimensional geometries, has been chosen to implement a double differential albedo calculus routine and therefore to generate albedo data for different kinds of medium. The surfacic estimator, which could be used, is not enough efficient because all neutrons do not contribute to the result. A new estimator is carried out. At each collision site, during the neutron history simulation, it allows to compute the probability of the neutron to go through the medium and to come through the reflection surface in the direction and at the energy considered. This estimator is about hundred times more efficient than the surfacic estimator. (author)\n\nA simplified unified Hauser-Feshbach/Pre-Equilibrium model for calculating double differential cross sections\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFu, C.Y.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nA unified Hauser-Feshbach/Pre-Equilibrium model is extended and simplified. The extension involves the addition of correlations among states of different total quantum numbers (J and J') and the introduction of consistent level density formulas for the H-F and the P-E parts of the calculation. The simplification, aimed at reducing the computational cost, is achieved mainly by keeping only the off-diagonal terms that involve strongly correlated 2p-1h states. A correlation coefficient is introduced to fit the experimental data. The model has been incorporated into the multistep H-F model code TNG. Calculated double differential (n,xn) cross sections at 14 and 25.7 MeV for iron, niobium, and bismuth are in good agreement with experiments. In use at ORNL and JAERI, the TNG code in various stages of development has been applied with success to the evaluation of double differential (n,xn) cross sections from 1 to 20 MeV for the dominant isotopes of chromium, manganese, iron, nickel, copper, and lead. 11 refs., 2 figs\n\nDouble differential cross sections of ethane molecule\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKumar, Rajeev\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPartial and total double differential cross sections corresponding to various cations C2H6+, C2H4+, C2H5+, C2H3+, C2H2+, CH3+, H+, CH2+, C2H+, H2+, CH+, H3+, C2+ and C+ produced during the direct and dissociative electron ionization of Ethane (C2H6) molecule have been calculated at fixed impinging electron energies 200 and 500eV by using modified Jain-Khare semi empirical approach. The calculation for double differential cross sections is made as a function of energy loss suffered by primary electron and angle of incident. To the best of my knowledge no other data is available for the comparison.\n\nMeasurement of the double differential dijet rate in deep inelastic scattering at HERA and comparison to NLO QCD calculations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPoeschl, R.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThe analysis presented the measurement of the dijet rate R 2 , the fraction of dijet events in all DIS events, as a function of the kinematic variables x B and Q 2 in the range of 5 2 2 and 10 -4 B -2 . The analysis is based on data collected with the H1 detector in the years 1996/97. The large amount of integrated luminosity (21.9 pb -1 ) available for this analysis allowed for the first time a double differential measurement of R 2 as a function of both x B and Q 2 . The single differential dijet rate, R 2 (x B ) and R 2 (Q 2 ), increases for increasing Q 2 as well as for increasing x B . The double differential dijet rate R 2 (x B , Q 2 ) is more sensitive to the x B dependence of dijet production since it shows a strong increase towards small values of x B if Q 2 is kept fixed. The double differential dijet rate has been compared to predictions of NLO QCD calculations. For the comparison it is required that at least one of the jets has a transverse energy 5 + Î GeV where Î = 2 GeV was chosen to be the central cut scenario. The dijet rate is well described by NLO calculations when Î¼ r 2 = Q 2 is chosen as the renormalization scale albeit at the cost of large scale uncertainties. If, however, Î¼ r 2 = Q 2 + E t 2 is chosen, which considerable reduces the scale uncertainties, substantial contributions from other sources of dijet production are needed.

To precisely model 3D and 4D tracks, the cross section for the ionisation by an incoming ion, double differential in the outgoing electron energy and angle, is required. However, the double differential cross section cannot be theoretically modelled over the full range of parameters. To address this issue, a database of all available experimental data has been constructed. Currently, the database of Experimental Double Differential Ionisation Cross sections (EDDIX) contains over 1200 digitalised experimentally measured datasets from the 1960s to present date, covering all available ion species (hydrogen to uranium) and all available target species. Double differential cross sections are also presented with the aid of an eight parameter functions fitted to the cross sections. The parameters include projectile species and charge, target nuclear charge and atomic mass, projectile atomic mass and energy, electron energy and deflection angle. It is planned to freely distribute EDDIX and make it available to the radiation research community for use in the analytical and numerical modelling of track structure.\n\nEvaluation of double differential yield as used for representation of neutron spectra\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSolieman, A.H.M.; Comsan, M.N.H.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe neutron intensity for TOF spectra representation has, until now, only been expressed in terms of double differential yield; number of neutrons per unit charge per unit solid angle per unit neutron energy interval (i.e. neutron intensity at a given resolving power). For accelerator-based neutron sources, the double differential yield - in terms of neutron energy interval - is found to be affected by the kinematics of the neutron producing reaction, to produce intensity irrelevant spectra. The results affect not only the applications that depend on relative neutron intensities, but also the applications that depend on the neutron intensity-weighted integration of the neutron spectra (e.g. neutron average energy calculation, and dose calculation using kerma factors). Other definition of the double differential yield - in terms of projectile energy loss - is suggested to avoid the drawbacks of the old definition. The neutron spectra that are driven using the two definitions are discussed\n\nDistorted wave calculations for double electron transfer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMartinez, A.E.; Rivarola, R.D.; Gayet, R.; Hanssen, J.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe resonant double electron capture by alpha particles in helium targets is studied, at intermediate and high collision energies, using the Continuum Distorted Wave - Eikonal Initial State (CDW-EIS) model. Differential and total cross sections for capture into the He (1 s 2 ) final state are calculated in the framework of an Independent Electron Approximation (IEA). Theoretical results are compared with the experimental data available at present for capture into any final state of helium.

The correction factor for flux attenuation and multiple scattering, that make a deformation to the measured spectrum, were calculated. The energy dependence of the correction factor was determined and a comparison with other works is shown. Calculations for Fe 56 at two different scattering angles were made. We also reproduce the experiment performed at the Nuclear Analysis Laboratory for C 12 at 25 celsius degree and the calculated correction factor for the is measured is shown. We found a linear relation between the scatter size and the correction factor for flux attenuation\n\nFactorization of differential expansion for antiparallel double-braid knots\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMorozov, A.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nContinuing the quest for exclusive Racah matrices, which are needed for evaluation of colored arborescent-knot polynomials in Chern-Simons theory, we suggest to extract them from a new kind of a double-evolution â that of the antiparallel double-braids, which is a simple two-parametric family of two-bridge knots, generalizing the one-parametric family of twist knots. In the case of rectangular representations R = [ r s ] we found an evidence that the corresponding differential expansion miraculously factorizes and can be obtained from that for the twist knots. This reduces the problem of rectangular exclusive Racah to constructing the answers for just a few twist knots. We develop a recent conjecture on the structure of differential expansion for the simplest members of this family (the trefoil and the figure-eight knot) and provide the exhaustive answer for the first unknown case of R = [33]. The answer includes HOMFLY of arbitrary twist and double-braid knots and Racah matrices overline{S} and S â what allows to calculate [33]-colored polynomials for arbitrary arborescent (double-fat) knots. For generic rectangular representations fully described are only the contributions of the single-floor pyramids. One step still remains to be done.\n\nEnergy and angle differential cross sections for the electron-impact double ionization of helium\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nColgan, James P.; Pindzola, M.S.; Robicheaux, F.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nEnergy and angle differential cross sections for the electron-impact double ionization of helium are calculated using a non-perturbative time-dependent close-coupling method. Collision probabilities are found by projection of a time evolved nine dimensional coordinate space wave function onto fully antisymmetric products of spatial and spin functions representing three outgoing Coulomb waves. At an incident energy of 106 eV, we present double energy differential cross sections and pentuple energy and angle differential cross sections. The pentuple energy and angle differential cross sections are found to be in relative agreement with the shapes observed in recent (e,3e) reaction microscope experiments. Integration of the differential cross sections over all energies and angles yields a total ionization cross section that is also in reasonable agreement with absolute crossed-beams experiments.\n\nMeasurement of neutron-production double-differential cross sections for intermediate energy pion incident reaction\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIwamoto, Yosuke; Shigyo, Nobuhiro; Satoh, Daiki\n\n2002-01-01\n\nNeutron-production double-differential cross sections for 870-MeV Ï + and Ï - and 2.1-GeV Ï + mesons incident on iron and lead targets were measured with NE213 liquid scintillators by time-of-flight technique. NE213 liquid scintillators 12.7 cm in diameter and 12.7 cm thick were placed in directions of 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150deg. The typical flight path length was 15 m. Neutron detection efficiencies were derived from the calculation results of SCINFUL and CECIL codes. The experimental results were compared with the JAM code. The double differential cross sections calculated by the JAM code disagree with experimental data at neutron energies below about 30 MeV. JAM overestimates Ï + -incident neutron-production cross sections in forward angles at neutron energies of 100 to 500 MeV.

The data was derived by comparing the measured TOF spectra with detailed Monte Carlo simulation, and corrected with n-p scattering cross section. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations based on the Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model have been performed to compare with experimental data. Measured differential cross sections were also compared with other measurements. It was found that the experimental results were in agreement with other measurements and theoretical calculations, while discrepancies were also present in the whole energy region and at some angles.

This type of cross section can correctly take account of the energy-angle correlated reaction kinematics. Accordingly, the transport phenomena in materials with highly anisotropic scattering are accurately calculated by using this cross section. They include the following four codes or code systems: PROF-DD : a code system to generate the multi-group double-differential form cross section library by processing basic nuclear data file compiled in the ENDF / B-IV or -V format, ANISN-DD : a one-dimensional transport code based on the discrete ordinate method, DOT-DD : a two-dimensional transport code based on the discrete ordinate method, MORSE-DD : a three-dimensional transport code based on the Monte Carlo method. In addition to these codes, several auxiliary codes have been developed to process calculated results. This report describes the calculation algorithm employed in these codes and how to use them.

The angular distribution was measured at eight angles from 20 deg. to 160 deg. allowing the extraction of angle-differential, energy differential, and total production cross sections. A first set of comparisons with several theoretical calculations is also presented\n\nModel of the double-rotor induction motor in terms of electromagnetic differential\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAdamczyk Dominik\n\n2016-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper presents a concept, a construction, a circuit model and experimental results of the double-rotor induction motor. This type of a motor is to be implemented in the concept of the electromagnetic differential. At the same time it should fulfill the function of differential mechanism and the vehicle drive. One of the motor shafts is coupled to the direction changing mechanical transmission. The windings of the external rotor are powered by slip rings and brushes. The inner rotor has the squirrel-cage windings. The circuit model parameters were calculated based on the 7.5 kW real single-rotor induction motor (2p = 4. Experimental verification of the model was based on comparison between the mentioned single-rotor motor and double-rotor model with the outer rotor blocked. The presented results showed relatively good compliance between the model and real motor.\n\nMeasurement of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections in proton-proton collisions at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nChatrchyan, Serguei; et al.,\n\n2013-12-01\n\nMeasurements of the differential and double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections are presented using an integrated luminosity of 4.5(4.8) inverse femtobarns in the dimuon (dielectron) channel of proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at sqrt{s} = 7 TeV. The measured inclusive cross section in the Z-peak region (60-120 GeV) is \\\\sigma(\\\\ell \\\\ell) = 986.4 +/- 0.6 (stat.) +/- 5.9 (exp. syst.) +/- 21.7 (th. syst.) +/- 21.7 (lum.) pb for the combination of the dimuon and dielectron channels. Differential cross sections $d\\\\sigma/dm$ for the dimuon, dielectron, and combined channels are measured in the mass range 15 to 1500 GeV and corrected to the full phase space. Results are also presented for the measurement of the double-differential cross section d^2\\\\sigma/dm d |y| in the dimuon channel over the mass range 20 to 1500 GeV and absolute dimuon rapidity from 0 to 2.4. These measurements are compared to the predictions of perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading orders using various sets of parton distribution functions.\n\nImproved forced impulse method calculations of single and double ionization of helium by collision with high-energy protons and antiprotons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFord, A.L.; Reading, J.F.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOur previous forced impulse method calculations of single and double ionization of helium by protons and antiprotons have been improved by including d orbitals in the target centre basis. The calculations are in good agreement with experimental measurements of the ratio R of double to single ionization, without the 1.35 scaling factor we applied to our previous results. We also compare the separate single and double ionization cross sections to experiment and find good agreement. Experimental cross sections differential in projectile scattering angle at large angle (greater than 2.5 mrad) are compared to our impact parameter dependent ionization probabilities at small impact parameter, for the double to single ratio. The agreement is good, except at the lowest energy we have considered, 0.3 eV. (Author)\n\nMeasurement of double differential cross sections of secondary neutrons in the incident energy range 9-13 MeV\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTang Hongqing; Qi Bujia; Zhou Zuying; Sa Jun; Ke Zunjian; Sui Qingchang; Xia Haihong; Shen Guanren\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe status and technique of double differential cross section measurement of secondary neutrons in the incident neutron energy range 9 to 13 MeV is reviewed with emphasis on the work done at CIAE. There are scarce measurements of secondary neutron double differential cross sections in this energy region up to now. A main difficulty for this is lack of an applicable monoenergetic neutron source. When monoenergetic neutron energy reaches 8 Me/v, the break-up neutrons from the d + D or p + T reaction starts to become significant. It is difficult to get a pure secondary neutron spectrum induced only by monoenergetic neutrons. To solve this problem an abnormal fast neutron TOF facility was designed and tested. Double differential neutron emission cross sections of 238 U and 209 Bi at 10 MeV were obtained by combining the data measured by both normal and abnormal TOF spectrometers and a good agreement between measurement and calculation was achieved\n\nMeasurement of neutron-production double-differential cross sections for high-energy pion-incident reaction\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIwamoto, Yousuke; Iga, Kiminori; Kitsuki, Hirohiko\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDouble-differential neutron-production yields for 870-MeV Ï + , Ï - and 2.1-GeV Ï + incident on iron and lead targets were measured with NE213 liquid scintillators by time-of-flight technique. The two-gate integration method was used for the pulse shape discrimination between neutrons and gamma-rays. Neutron detection efficiencies were derived from the calculation results of SCINFUL and CECIL codes. The experimental results were compared with the calculation including the neutron transport in the actual thickness target by the contribution use of both NMTC/JAERI97 and MCNPX.

Flight path was 2.7 m. The neutron detector was biased at 1.3 MeV. The time resolution was about 1.2 ns. The data were compared with existing data and theoretical calculated results. Good agreement is achieved\n\nDouble Hopf bifurcation in delay differential equations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRedouane Qesmi\n\n2014-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper addresses the computation of elements of double Hopf bifurcation for retarded functional differential equations (FDEs with parameters. We present an efficient method for computing, simultaneously, the coefficients of center manifolds and normal forms, in terms of the original FDEs, associated with the double Hopf singularity up to an arbitrary order. Finally, we apply our results to a nonlinear model with periodic delay. This shows the applicability of the methodology in the study of delay models arising in either natural or technological problems.\n\nInvestigation of impact-parameter dependent double differential electron emission probabilities in proton-helium collisions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSchiwietz, G.\n\n1986-07-01\n\nThe process of ionization in ion-atom collisions was investigated. Thus absolute double differential electron emission yields were measured for the collision system H + +He. The experimental results are compared with theoretical results partially calculated in this work. For the coincidence measurements an electron time-of-flight spectrometer with a large solid angle was constructed. For the measurement of the scattered projectiles a fast position sensitive ion detector and a data preprocessing unit were developed.

W.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nCurrent computational tools used for space or accelerator shielding studies transport energetic heavy ions either using a one-dimensional straight-ahead approximation or by dissociating the nuclei into protons and neutrons and then performing neutron and proton transport using Monte Carlo techniques. Although the heavy secondary particles generally travel close to the beam direction, a proper treatment of the light ions produced in these reactions requires that double-differential cross sections should be utilised. Unfortunately, no fundamental nuclear model capable of serving as an event generator to provide these cross sections for all ions and energies of interest exists currently. Herein, we present a model for producing double-differential heavy-ion production cross sections that uses heavy-ion fragmentation yields produced by the NUCFRG2 fragmentation code coupled with a model of energy degradation in nucleus-nucleus collisions and systematics of momentum distributions to provide energy and angular dependences of the heavy-ion production.

The measured energy and angular distribution of double differential cross sections (DOCS) of these electrons are compared with the theoretical calculation provided by R.D. Rivarola et al. The single differential cross sections (SDCS) are deduced by integrating the DDCSs over solid angle and emission energy. For the calculation of DDCS for He a first-order Born approximation is employed. Within the framework of this model, both the incident and the scattered electrons are described by plane waves, whereas the initial atomic bound state is described by a Lowdin's wavefunction and the final continuum state for the ionized electron is chosen taken into account the interaction between the emitted electron and the residual target at large asymptotic separations. The experimental data is in reasonably good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

The grid-doubling technique employs small cells in a thin layer surrounding the fault. The remainder of the modelling volume is filled with larger cells, typically two or four times as large as the small cells. In the resulting non-conforming mesh, an interpolation method is used to join the thin layer of smaller cells to the volume of larger cells. Grid-doubling is effective because spontaneous rupture calculations typically require higher spatial resolution on and near the fault than elsewhere in the model volume. The technique can be applied to non-planar faults by morphing, or smoothly distorting, the entire mesh to produce the desired 3-D fault geometry. Using our FaultMod finite-element software, we have tested grid-doubling with both slip-weakening and rate-and-state friction laws, by running the SCEC/USGS 3-D dynamic rupture benchmark problems. We have also applied it to a model of the Hayward fault, Northern California, which uses realistic fault geometry and rock properties. FaultMod implements fault slip using common nodes, which represent motion common to both sides of the fault, and differential nodes, which represent motion of one side of the fault relative to the other side. We describe how to modify the traction-at-split-nodes method to work with common and differential nodes, using an implicit time stepping algorithm.\n\nTransformation formulas for legendre coefficients of double-differential cross sections\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShi Xiangjun; Zhang Jingshang\n\n1989-01-01\n\nApproximate analytical formulas have been derived for the transformation of Legendre coefficients of double-differential continuum cross sections of two-body nuclear reactions from the center-of-mass to the laboratory system. This transformation differs from that of elastic-scattering angular distribution coefficients on its accuracy which depends not only upon the target mass, but also upon outgoing energies. A fast code has been written to transform Legendre coefficients of neutron inelastic scattering cross-sections. The calculations have been carried out using a recently introduced numerical integration method for more complicated problems in which the energy spectrum is either an evaporation spectrum or a spectrum obtained from a (pre-)compound model. The results are quite satisfactory provided that the target mass or the outgoing energy is not sufficiently low\n\nCalculating differential Galois groups of parametrized differential equations, with applications to hypertranscendence\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHardouin, Charlotte; Minchenko, Andrei; Ovchinnikov, Alexey\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe main motivation of our work is to create an efficient algorithm that decides hypertranscendence of solutions of linear differential equations, via the parameterized differential and Galois theories. To achieve this, we expand the representation theory of linear differential algebraic groups and develop new algorithms that calculate unipotent radicals of parameterized differential Galois groups for differential equations whose coefficients are rational functions.

The measured cross sections were compared with the calculated values by HETC-KFA2. For the neutrons, the calculated results deviate from the experimental data in the neutron energy region below 30 MeV. The calculated values of gamma-ray production agree with the experimental data at gamma-ray energies from 1 to 7 MeV within a factor of three.

For the final state, an approximation of the well-known 3C wave function is used. An extensive study has been made by varying the angles of detection and the energies of each ejected electron. We have investigated the double ionization of each molecular state (1b 1 , 3a 1 , 1b 2 and 2a 1 ) and identified the mechanisms of this process.\n\nH + Ar collisions. II. Differential scattering calculations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNeumann, H.; Le, T.Q.; van Zyl, B.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nDifferential elastic scattering cross-section calculations have been made for H + Ar collisions using classical and eikonal techniques. The calculation procedures are described and compared with existing experimental data. It is shown that the angular distribution of the elastic cross section is similar to that obtained for proton production in such collisions at energies above about 200 eV. By combining the angular dependence of the computed elastic cross section with experimental measurements described in the preceding paper, absolute differential cross sections for proton production have been determined\n\nScattering and absorption differential cross sections for double ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nThe scattering and absorption differential cross sections for nonlinear QED process such as double photon Compton scattering have been measured as a function of independent ï¬nal photon energy.

The data were deduced by comparing the measured TOF spectra with the calculated ones using a realistic Monte-Carlo simulation. The DDX were normalized to nâp scattering cross sections which are a neutron scattering standard. The results of the elastic scattering angular distributions (DX) and the secondary neutron emission DDX at 25 different angles from 15 deg to 145 deg were presented. Meanwhile, a theoretical model based on the unified Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model for light nuclei was used to describe the double-differential cross sections of n+{sup 9}Be, and the theoretical calculation results were compared with the measured cross sections.\n\nNew developments in the calculation of double beta decay\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEngel, J.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nI review recent work on computing double beta decay rates. After a discussion of shell model and Quasiparticle Random Phase calculations, I argue for a model based on the notion of generalized seniority that combines the advantages of both earlier approaches.

The experimental data were compared with the LA-150 data library, which agreed generally with the present data. KERMA(Kinetic Energy Released in MAtter) coefficients(of Fe) were deduced from the experimental data and compared with the integral measurement and calculations by the LA-150 data library. (author)\n\nCalculated differential secondary-particle production cross sections after nonelastic neutron interactions with carbon and oxygen between 15 and 60 MeV\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrenner, D.J.; Prael, R.E.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nCalculated values are given for double-differential (energy/angle) cross sections for the nonelastic production of hydrogen and helium isotopes and heavier-mass recoils, after the interaction of 15- to 60-MeV neutrons with carbon and oxygen. The data are calculated with an intranuclear cascade code, including alpha clustering and particle pickup, followed by a Fermi-breakup mechanism, incorporating decay via intermediate particle-unstable states. The predictions have been extensively tested against available experimental data in this energy/mass range. copyright 1989 Academic Press, Inc\n\nMeasurements of prompt fission neutron spectra and double-differential neutron inelastic-scattering cross sections for 238U and 232Th\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBaba, Mamoru; Itoh, Nobuo; Maeda, Kazuto; Hirakawa, Naohiro; Wakabayashi, Hidetaka.\n\n1989-10-01\n\nThis report presents the summary of experimental studies of prompt fission neutron spectra and double-differential neutron inelastic-scattering cross sections of 238 U and 232 Th. The experiments were performed at Tohoku University Fast Neutron Laboratory employing a time-of-flight technique and Dynamitron accelerator as the pulsed neutron generator. From the experiments, we obtained the following data for both nuclei; 1. prompt fission neutron spectrum for 2 MeV neutrons, 2. double-differential neutron inelastic-scattering cross sections for 1.2, 2.0, 4.2, 6.1 and 14.1 MeV incident neutrons. Both in experiments and data processing, cares were taken to obtain reliable data by avoiding systematic uncertainty. The experimental data were compared with those by other experiments, evaluations and model calculations. Through the data comparison, some fundamental problems were found in the experiments by previous authors and the evaluations. The present data will provide useful data base for refinement of the evaluated data and theoretical models.

Using the method the asymptotics of the form-factor of electron is calculated. The ladder and cross-ladder diagrams are asymptotically considerable in every order of the perturbation theory. The way in which the asymptotics of the 4-order diagrams is calculated has been shown. The diagrams of this order and reduction procedures for them are given in a graphic form. The photon mass Î¼ 2 not equal to 0 plays the role of a regulator, removing infrared divergencies. The double logarithmical asymptotics of the form-factor of electron on the mass shell is calculated rigorously in an arbitrary order of the perturbation theory [ru\n\nAn order Î±s Monte Carlo calculation of hadronic double photon production\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOwens, J.F.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe results of an order Î± s calculation of hadronic double photon production are discussed and compared with data from both colliding beam and fixed target experiments. The calculation utilizes a combination of analytic and Monte Carlo integration methods which make it easy to calculate a variety of observables and impose experimental cuts.

They are based on proton-proton collision data at $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb$^{-1} $. The measured inclusive cross section in the Z peak region (60-120 GeV), obtained from the combination of the dielectron and dimuon channels, is 1138 $\\\\pm$ 8 (exp) $\\\\pm$ 25 (theo) $\\\\pm$ 30 (lumi) pb, where the statistical uncertainty is negligible. The differential cross section $\\\\mathrm{d\\\\sigma/dm}$ in the dilepton mass range 15 to 2000 GeV is measured and corrected to the full phase space. The double-differential cross section $\\\\mathrm{d^2\\\\sigma / dm \\\\, d|y|}$ is also measured over the mass range 20 to 1500 GeV and absolute dilepton rapidity from 0 to 2.4. In addition, the ratios of the normalized differential cross sections measured at $\\\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 8 TeV are presented. These measurements are com...\n\nDouble differential cross sections for methane molecules at intermediate energies\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nYavuz, Murat; Ozer, Zehra Nur; Ulu, Melike; Dogan, Mevlut; Okumus, Nimet; Sahlaoui, Mohammed; Benmansour, Houda; Bouamoud, Mammar\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDouble differential cross sections (DDCS) can be obtained by the measurements of energy and angular distributions of one of the two outgoing electrons by a detector. In this pespective, we used methane molecule as a target that is reasonable to expect to understand ionization mechanisms of polyatomic molecular systems.\n\nElectron-helium S-wave model benchmark calculations. II. Double ionization, single ionization with excitation, and double excitation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBartlett, Philip L.; Stelbovics, Andris T.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe propagating exterior complex scaling (PECS) method is extended to all four-body processes in electron impact on helium in an S-wave model. Total and energy-differential cross sections are presented with benchmark accuracy for double ionization, single ionization with excitation, and double excitation (to autoionizing states) for incident-electron energies from threshold to 500 eV. While the PECS three-body cross sections for this model given in the preceding article [Phys. Rev. A 81, 022715 (2010)] are in good agreement with other methods, there are considerable discrepancies for these four-body processes. With this model we demonstrate the suitability of the PECS method for the complete solution of the electron-helium system.\n\nCalculation of coupling factor for double-period accelerating structure\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBian Xiaohao; Chen Huaibi; Zheng Shuxin\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn the design of the linear accelerating structure, the coupling factor between cavities is a crucial parameter. The error of coupling factor accounts for the electric or magnetic field error mainly. To accurately design the coupling iris, the accurate calculation of coupling factor is essential. The numerical simulation is widely used to calculate the coupling factor now. By using MAFIA code, two methods have been applied to calculate the dispersion characteristics of the single-period structure, one method is to simulate the traveling wave mode by the period boundary condition; another method is to simulate the standing wave mode by the electrical boundary condition. In this work, the authors develop the two methods to calculate the coupling factor of double-period accelerating structure. Compared to experiment, the results for both methods are very similar, and in agreement with measurement within 15% deviation.

Comparison of the experimental data with the evaluated nuclear data file, ENDF/B-IV revealed that the data file could not reproduce the experimental ones, particularly in the angular distributions. Nuclear model calculation showed that the preequilibrium process was important in the present incident energy region. Measurements have been performed for titanium, niobium, molybdenum, lead, and thorium (in progress), including the light elements, carbon and aluminum.

Spallation neutrons are used as incident particles. As a part of this, the experiment was performed by using of NE213 liquid organic scintillators to detect outgoing-neutrons. Incident-neutron energy was determined by time-of-flight technique, and outgoing-neutron energy spectrum was derived by unfolding light-output spectrum of NE213 with response functions calculated by SCINFUL-R. Preliminary cross sections were obtained up to about 100 MeV, and were compared with calculations by the GNASH code. It is hoped to get pure measurements by using measured response functions for our detectors used in this study.

A type of complicated valve core structure were designed with tortuous flow path made from reversal double elbows. It is very difficult to calculate the pressure-drop of the un-fully developed two-phase flow under high temperature and pressure which flow through the valve core. A calculation method called 'constant (varing) pressure-drop progressing step by step design method' was developed. The complicated flow path was disintegrated into a series of independent resistance units and with the valve stem end progressing step by step the dimensions of the flow path were designed in accordance with the principle that in every position the total pressure-drop of the valve should amount to that required by the design goal curve. In the course of calculating the total pressure-drop, the valve flow path was also divided into a series of independent resistance units. The experiment results show that design flow characteristics are approximately consistent with the flow characteristics measured in the test\n\nMeasurements of (n,xp), (n,xd) double differential cross sections of Al and C for neutrons at 75 and 65 MeV\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNauchi, Yasushi; Baba, Mamoru; Iwasaki, Tomohiko [Tohoku Univ., Sendai (Japan).

The present result of 9 Be is compared with existing experimental data. The data of 238 U and 209 Bi are compared with theoretical calculations.

The developed sensor has a conventional (inner) bridge on a micromachined diaphragm and a secondary (outer) bridge on the chip...... substrate. A novel approach is demonstrated with a combined measurement of outputs from the two bridges, which results in a combined deduction of both differential and static media pressure. Also following this new approach, a significant improvement in differential pressure sensor accuracy is achieved....... Output from the two bridges depends linearly on both differential and absolute (relative to atmospheric pressure) media pressure. Furthermore, the sensor stress distributions involved are studied by three-dimensional finite-element (FE) stress analysis. Furthermore, the FE analysis evaluates current...\n\nDouble-photoionization of helium including quadrupole radiation effects\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nColgan, James [Los Alamos National Laboratory; Ludlow, J A [AUBURN UNIV; Lee, Teck - Ghee [AUBURN UNIV; Pindzola, M S [AUBURN UNIV; Robicheaux, F [AUBURN UNIV\n\n2009-01-01\n\nNon-perturbative time-dependent close-coupling calculations are carried out for the double photoionization of helium including both dipole and quadrupole radiation effects. At a photon energy of 800 eV, accessible at CUlTent synchrotron light sources, the quadrupole interaction contributes around 6% to the total integral double photoionization cross section. The pure quadrupole single energy differential cross section shows a local maxima at equal energy sharing, as opposed to the minimum found in the pure dipole single energy differential cross section. The sum of the pure dipole and pure quadrupole single energy differentials is insensitive to non-dipole effects at 800 eV. However, the triple differential cross section at equal energy sharing of the two ejected electrons shows strong non-dipole effects due to the quadrupole interaction that may be experimentally observable.\n\nCovariance Matrix of a Double-Differential Doppler-Broadened Elastic Scattering Cross Section\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nArbanas, G.; Becker, B.; Dagan, R.; Dunn, M.

L.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nLegendre moments of a double-differential Doppler-broadened elastic neutron scattering cross section on 238U are computed near the 6.67 eV resonance at temperature T = 103 K up to angular order 14. A covariance matrix of these Legendre moments is computed as a functional of the covariance matrix of the elastic scattering cross section. A variance of double-differential Doppler-broadened elastic scattering cross section is computed from the covariance of Legendre moments.

A description of the experimental details and data analysis is presented. The experimentally observed systematics of reactions leading to DIAS, to nonanalog ground states, and to low-lying 2 + states are described. Lowest-order optical-model calculations of DIAS DCX are compared to the data. Efforts to understand the anomalies by invoking additional reaction-mechanism amplitudes and a higher-order optical potential are described. Calculations of nonanalog DCX reactions leading to J/sup Ï/ = 0 + states were performed within a distorted-wave impulse-approximation framework. The sensitivities of these calculations to input parameters are discussed. 58 refs., 41 figs., 16 tabs\n\nBenchmark test of MORSE-DD code using double-differential form cross sections\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNakagawa, Masayuki; Mori, Takamasa; Ishiguro, Yukio\n\n1985-02-01\n\nThe multi-group double-differential form cross sections (DDX) and the three dimensional Monte Carlo code MORSE-DD devised to utilize the DDX, which were developed for the fusion neutronics analysis, have been validated through many benchmark tests. All the problems tested have a 14 MeV neutron source. To compare the calculated results with the measured values, the following experiments were adopted as the benchmark problems; leakage neutron spectra from spheres composed of nine kinds of materials measured at LLNL, neutron angular spectra from the Li 2 O slab measured at FNS in JAERI, tritium production rate (TPR) in the graphite-reflected Li 2 O sphere measured at FNS and the TPR in the metallic Li sphere measured at KfK. In addition in order to test an accuracy of the calculation method in detail, spectra of neutrons scattered from a small sample and various reaction rates in a Li 2 O cylinder were compared between the present method and the continuous energy Monte Carlo method. The nuclear data files used are mainly ENDF/B4 and partly JENDL-3PR1. The tests were carried out through a comparison with the measured values and also with the results obtained from the conventional Legendre expansion method and the continuous energy Monte Carlo method. It is found that the results by the present method are more accurate than those by the conventional one and agree well with those by the continuous energy Monte Carlo calculations. Discrepancies due to the nuclear data are also discussed.

This enables to study the top-quark properties and its production and decay mechanisms in unprecedent detail. The dileptonic decay channel of the top-quark pair, in which both W bosons, produced from the top-quark decay, decay into a lepton and neutrino, is studied in this analysis. The limitation to one electron and one muon in final state used in this work allows to strongly suppress the possible background processes and leads to a higher signal purity. About 40k events with a top-quark pair have been selected using the â(s)=8 TeV data recorded with the CMS detector in the year 2012. Exploiting this large sample, double differential top-quark pair production cross sections are measured for the first time. The cross sections are studied as functions of various observables which describe the top and top-pair kinematics. To obtain the full kinematics of the t anti t final state, which contains two undetected neutrinos, a kinematic reconstruction procedure was developed and exploited in this work. The new procedure makes use of all available constraints and is based on a repeated reconstruction of each event with detector observables smeared according to their resolutions in order to obtain for each event solutions for the kinematic constraint equations. In order to obtain double differential cross sections, the distributions of reconstructed observables are then corrected for detector effects by using a double differential unfolding procedure, which is based on a Ï 2 minimization. The double differential cross sections presented in this work allow to test the Standard Model in detail and investigate previously seen disagreements between measured and predicted single differential cross sections. The results of this work are compared to Standard Model predictions (up to next-to-leading order of the hard\n\nMeasurement of neutron production double-differential cross-sections on carbon bombared with 430 MeV/ Nucleon carbon irons\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nItashiki, Yutaro; Imahayashi, Youichi; Shigyo, Nobuhiro; Uozumi, Yusuke [Kyushu University, Fukuoka (Japan); Satoh, Daiki [Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Ibaraki (Japan); Kajimoto, Tsuyoshi [Hiroshima University, Hiroshima (Japan); Sanami, Toshiya [High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Ibaraki (Japan); Koba, Yusuke; Matufuji, Naruhiro [Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba (Japan)\n\n2016-12-15\n\nCarbon ion therapy has achieved satisfactory results. However, patients have a risk to get a secondary cancer. In order to estimate the risk, it is essential to understand particle transportation and nuclear reactions in the patient's body. The particle transport Monte Carlo simulation code is a useful tool to understand them. Since the code validation for heavy ion incident reactions is not enough, the experimental data of the elementary reaction processes are needed. We measured neutron production double-differential cross-sections (DDXs) on a carbon bombarded with 430 MeV/nucleon carbon beam at PH2 beam line of HIMAC facility in NIRS. Neutrons produced in the target were measured with NE213 liquid organic scintillators located at six angles of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90Â°. Neutron production double-differential cross-sections for carbon bombarded with 430 MeV/nucleon carbon ions were measured by the time-of-flight method with NE213 liquid organic scintillators at six angles of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90Â°. The cross sections were obtained from 1 MeV to several hundred MeV. The experimental data were compared with calculated results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation codes PHITS, Geant4, and FLUKA. PHITS was able to reproduce neutron production for elementary processes of carbon-carbon reaction precisely the best of three codes.\n\nDouble symbol error rates for differential detection of narrow-band FM\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSimon, M. K.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThis paper evaluates the double symbol error rate (average probability of two consecutive symbol errors) in differentially detected narrow-band FM. Numerical results are presented for the special case of MSK with a Gaussian IF receive filter. It is shown that, not unlike similar results previously obtained for the single error probability of such systems, large inaccuracies in predicted performance can occur when intersymbol interference is ignored.\n\nExclusive Double Diffractive Higgs Boson Production at LHC\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPetrov, V; 10.1140/epjc/s2004-01972-4\n\n2004-01-01\n\nExclusive double diffractive (EDD) Higgs boson production is analyzed in the framework of the Regge-eikonal approach. Total and differential cross-sections for the process $p+p\\\\to p+H+p$ are calculated. Experimental possibilities to find Higgs boson at LHC are discussed.\n\nFully differential cross sections for the single ionization of helium by fast ions: Classical model calculations\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSarkadi, L.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFully differential cross sections (FDCSs) have been calculated for the single ionization of helium by 1- and 3-MeV proton and 100-MeV/u C6 + ion impact using the classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method in the nonrelativistic, three-body approximation. The calculations were made employing a Wigner-type model in which the quantum-mechanical position distribution of the electron is approximated by a weighted integral of the microcanonical distribution over a range of the binding energy of the electron. In the scattering plane, the model satisfactorily reproduces the observed shape of the binary peak. In the region of the peak the calculated FDCSs agree well with the results of continuum-distorted-wave calculations for all the investigated collisions. For 1-MeV proton impact the experimentally observed shift of the binary peak with respect to the first Born approximation is compared with the shifts obtained by different higher-order quantum-mechanical theories and the present CTMC method. The best result was achieved by CTMC, but still a large part of the shift remained unexplained. Furthermore, it was found that the classical theory failed to reproduce the shape of the recoil peak observed in the experiments, it predicts a much narrower peak. This indicates that the formation of the recoil peak is dominated by quantum-mechanical effects. For 100-MeV/u C6 + ion impact the present CTMC calculations confirmed the existence of the \"double-peak\" structure of the angular distribution of the electron in the plane perpendicular to the momentum transfe"
