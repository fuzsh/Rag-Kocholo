Indeed, this book is primarily and overwhelmingly about African Americans, other topics being in service of this goal. It proceeds both chronologically and topically. Thus readers may want to turn to particular chapters to sample particular issues: Chapter  concerns the early involvement between U.S. Negroes and Mexico. U.S. slavery and Mexican abolitionism made for a contentious relationship and contributed to Mexico’s loss of Texas and the war of , and the loss of California. After the U.S. Civil War Negroes made a number of organized eﬀorts to settle south of the border in an attempt to escape persecution and seize opportunity. Chapter  expands upon the respective roles of Jack Johnson and Henry O. Flipper. Johnson’s bold alliance with Mexican revolutionaries was a precursor to Paul Robeson’s alliance with the Soviet Union, the Nation of Islam’s ties to Japan, and Martin Luther King’s inspiration from India. Flipper, on the other hand, was ﬁrmly in the tradition of the Negro who stays true to the United States, no matter the provocation or the insult. 1\n\nvii\n\nPreface\n\nChapter  concerns the experience of African Americans scattered along the two-thousand-mile border between the United States and Mexico stretching from southern California to southern Texas.As a “minority” among “minorities,” African Americans certainly faced discrimination but the bigotry was absorbed also by those of Mexican descent, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. This created an opportunity for some Negroes, leading scholars to conclude that they were constructed as “white” in pockets of this borderland. In addition, though the inﬂuence of socialism on U.S. Negroes has been adequately sketched, less attention has been paid to the impact of the other powerful ideology of that era: anarchism. Spurred by the impetus created by the Revolution and World War I, the NAACP enjoyed tremendous growth during this era. One of their key leaders—John Shillady—was a product of the anarchist movement, which had deep roots in Mexico. Chapter  deals with the shocking level of violence in the borderlands, especially Texas, notably antiblack depredations. A striking and telling point was the murderous beating of NAACP leader John Shillady in Austin, and ever more gruesome lynchings throughout the state. Complicating this picture was the presence of armed Negro troopers—uncommon in the South as a whole—who were supposedly tasked to deter attacks from Mexico and still restive Native Americans; however, they were not unwilling to enforce equality at gunpoint. Chapter  deals with the Negroes who were a battering ram against Native American sovereignty in helping to “win the West”—the “Buﬀalo Soldiers.” In  they invaded Mexico in search of Pancho Villa after his raid in Columbus, New Mexico—and were soundly defeated at Carrizal in what W. E. B. Du Bois termed a “fool’s errand.” This was occurring as the United States geared up to enter World War I, thus stretching to the limits the nation’s military capacity, and ultimately leaving the United States in the unsustainable position of being heavily dependent on blacks to defend a land of white supremacy. Simultaneously, as chapter  suggests, in the South—where the bulk of Negroes continued to reside—many among this “minority” were ﬂeeing conscription en masse and migrating north into the maw of urban anonymity. This is a largely neglected reason behind the “Great Migration” of this era—a mass movement that transformed rural Negroes into urbanites, with consequences that are still being tolled. The plight of “Spanish American” troopers in the Southwest was similar to that of their Negro brethren but because some possessed a “white phenotype” and had viii\n\nPreface\n\nMexican roots (a nation that was not indiﬀerent to their situation) they were a diﬀerent kind of “minority” than the Negro. Chapter  expands upon the travails of the “Buﬀalo Soldiers,” notably their invasion of Mexico in  in the aforementioned futile hunt for Villa. A number were killed, while others were taken prisoner as the invaders left Mexico empty-handed. However, their marauding was celebrated in the United States, and their display of belligerence seemed to bring Negroes ever closer to ﬁrst-class citizenship.This chapter also examines the defection of a number of African Americans who chose to ﬁght on behalf of Mexico, and the duplicitous activities of some whom I term ironically “African American,” namely, “whites” from South Africa, with no evident “racial” sensitivity, who found themselves sharing a trench with U.S. Negroes unfaithful to Washington. Chapter  is about the “Plan of San Diego” and related eﬀorts by Mexico, together with Germany and Japan, to cultivate African Americans as allies within the United States.This created an enormous national security problem for Washington and ultimately eroded white supremacy as the United States sought to insure that Negroes would not be attracted to the nation’s antagonists. Further, the existence of militant “race-based” movements among U.S. Negroes and Mexicans, assisted by foreign powers, created powerful momentum for the formation of militant “class-based” movements (e.g., the Communist Party) among Euro-Americans to whom they seemed a reasonable alternative and foil. The epilogue brings this story full circle, from the period since the Revolution to the present, tracing the momentous relationship between those of African and Mexican descent. Mexico has continued to be a site of exile for African Americans, as the presence there of one of this nation’s greatest artists—Elizabeth Catlett—well attests. Simultaneously, the continued migration of Mexican workers to the United States provides new challenges and opportunities for the nation and African Americans alike. In a real sense the inspiration for this book was sparked during my childhood. My older sister—Mary Horne Young—with whom I collaborated on a number of books, was also a linguist of no small note. Having resided in Germany, Turkey, Colombia, and South Korea she knew the predominant languages of these nations as well as a number of Native American languages. Her knowledge of Spanish in particular inspired me to study this beautiful language. Unfortunately, she passed away recently.This book is dedicated to her memory. ix\n\nPreface\n\nWhile conducting research in Mexico City, I was helped by Cindy Hawes and Maria del Rocio Perez Cadena. Angela Gilliam, Alma Stevenson, Diana Arnhalt, and Roman Padilla were also helpful. As with all the books I have written of late, Walter Hill of the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland, has been of extraordinary assistance to me and has become a good friend. Numerous other archives and libraries were consulted in the course of researching this book. Foremost among them have been the Rio Grande Historical Collections of New Mexico State University; the Center for Southwest Research, University of New Mexico; the New Mexico State Records Center and Archives in Santa Fe; the University of Texas, Austin; the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; the University of Texas, El Paso; the El Paso County Historical Society; the El Paso Public Library; the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research; the California State Archives and California State Library of Sacramento; the San Diego Historical Society; the Huntington Library in San Marino, California; the Arizona State Library, Archives and Oﬃce of Public Records in Phoenix; the Arizona Historical Society in Tucson; the University of Arizona; the Library of Congress; and state archives in Wisconsin, New Jersey,Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Particularly helpful was the archive in Mexico City of the Secretario de Relaciones Exteriores. I have been fortunate to have been associated with leading scholars in this general ﬁeld, including John Mason Hart of the University of Houston and Zaragosa Vargas of the University of California, Santa Barbara. I have also been inﬂuenced by the works of James Sandos, Benjamin Johnson, Juan Gomez Quiñones, Rodolfo Acuña, Kevin Mulroy, Helen Delpar, Garna Christian, William Loren Katz, Emilio Zamora, and Jeﬀ Perry, among others. A good deal of this book was written while I was associated with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.The library there and at Duke University were of immeasurable assistance in researching this book. As is evident, the ultimate inspiration for this book was the heroic courage and labor of the peoples of the borderlands, who still have many stories to share with researchers and writers.\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nJack Johnson was smiling. Why the burly black boxer would be mirthful was unclear. After all, here he was at the border between Tijuana, Mexico,1 and southern California about to surrender to the U.S. authorities after avoiding their clutches for years. A prison term was sure to follow and in  an African American—even a celebrity like the former heavyweight champion—could hardly expect a bacchanalian revel behind bars. Palm trees swayed lazily in the summer breezes nearby and ocean waves crashed on the beach as Johnson, in a wellappointed automobile, approached the boundary between Mexico and the United States. He exited the car, shook hands with several Mexican oﬃcials, no doubt thanking them for the lavish hospitality he had enjoyed from their government in recent months. Motion picture cameras whirred and still cameras clicked, seeking to capture this exceptional event for posterity. Spectators watched. Then he walked slowly to the U.S. Customs House, presented his passport to an eagerly awaiting oﬃcial, and stepped across the border onto U.S. soil.2 Somewhat disingenuously, he told the assembly, “The Mexican Government had issued no deportation order against me, as was reported some weeks ago, and I could have remained in Tijuana as long as I was willing to obey the laws of Lower California. But for a long time I wanted to return and get my troubles adjusted.”3 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs his feet hit the ground on the land of his birth, the curtain came down on a remarkable decade and a striking epoch in which African Americans had sought to take advantage of the extraordinary ripples of change unleashed by the Mexican Revolution in . Belying his image as an insouciant bon vivant, Johnson was in the vanguard of this trend. As recently as , as his homeland was rocked by anarchist bombings and “race riots,” Johnson contributed to the sense of nervous apprehension by placing ads in black newspapers. “Jack Johnson’s Land Company,” based in Mexico City, extended the following enticing invitation: “Colored People.You who are lynched, tortured, mobbed, persecuted and discriminated against in the boasted ‘Land of Liberty.’ . . . own a home in mexico where one man is as good as another and it is not your nationality that counts but simply you!” The price was reasonable—“. an acre and up”—but “best of all there is [no] ‘race prejudice’ in Mexico and in fact, severe punishment is meted out to those who discriminate against a man because of his color or race. Neither is there censorship, espionage or conscription.”4 These were heady claims with more than a touch of exaggeration. Yet African Americans reeling from pogroms and medieval punishments could hardly ignore these alluring words. Likewise, the U.S. authorities, who were beginning to view their southern neighbor with unease as a vector for subversion, also had to pay attention. Though Johnson, like his successors Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali, was wildly popular among his fellow African Americans, his solidarity with revolutionaries in Mexico by no means represented the full spectrum of opinion among Negroes. His putative polar opposite, Henry O. Flipper, stood assuredly on the other side of the barricades.The ﬁrst black man to graduate from West Point, he was a dedicated “Indian ﬁghter” in the “Wild West.”5 Like Johnson, he too symbolized U.S. weakness during the Revolution in that Washington was unduly dependent on full-time black soldiers—and mostly white part-time volunteers in the National Guard— a troublesome combination for a nation grounded in white supremacy.6 Like Johnson, he too ﬂouted rigorously enforced social norms by initiating an intimate relationship with a Euro-American woman. Just as this faux pas led to criminal charges and exile for Johnson, it led to Flipper being drummed out of the military—at least, that was his opinion and that of his many avid supporters.7 But unlike Johnson, Flipper continued to make himself useful to the U.S. authorities. A ﬂuent Spanish-speaker, he became an expert witness in 2\n\nIntroduction\n\nelaborate court cases leading to the dispossession of the land of Mexican Americans in the Southwest. He was the “nation’s ﬁrst prominent black civil and mining engineer”8 and assisted budding U.S. transnational corporations in extracting wealth from Mexico. And he became a noted spy against revolutionary forces in Mexico and a trusted aide of Senator Albert Fall of New Mexico, he of the massive scandal that was to be known as “Teapot Dome.” Flipper was the archetype of the fervently patriotic Negro even as he is being ﬂayed by his nation’s blood-soaked ﬂag. Unlike Othello, Flipper’s service to the state was eventually honored. President Bill Clinton pardoned him, clearing him of the charges of peculation that ostensibly led to his being ousted from the military.9 The decision by the U.S. Postal Service to honor him was endorsed by then Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, a Georgian like Flipper.10 Colin Powell “kept a photo of Flipper on his wall while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staﬀ.”11 Johnson had epicurean tastes and was attracted to radical positions, while Flipper was a man of rectitude and stiﬀ-necked patriotism. Not only do the two present contrasting black images. They also illustrate how essential the much reviled Negroes had become to U.S. national security, no matter how this phrase was interpreted. Just as actual and presumed antagonists of Washington such as Mexico, Japan, and Germany looked longingly to African Americans as potential allies, soldiers like Flipper steadfastly defended their homeland at a time when “slackers” were hiding in the bushes. To be sure, given that the United States was embroiled in armed conﬂict in places ranging from Mexico to Europe to Asia in the second decade of the twentieth century, the reluctance of many men to enroll in the military was understandable, particularly immigrants faced with the diﬃcult choice of wielding weapons against their former homelands. But unlike the battleﬁelds in Europe and Asia, the Revolution that rocked Mexico was on the doorstep of the United States; it inﬂamed the border and led to the deaths of countless U.S. citizens. This Revolution, which dislodged the long-time rule of Porﬁrio Diaz, was also due in no small part to the machinations of the United States. Relations between the United States and Mexico “cooled considerably near the ﬁnale of the Porﬁriato,” as Diaz’s lengthy rule was termed. For “in an attempt to regain his waning popularity, Diaz suddenly adopted a nationalistic stance than ran counter to American interests.”12 But the most fruitful opportunities for Negroes, and the greatest challenges to the United States, resulted 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nfrom the rise to leadership of Venustiano Carranza in Mexico late in the revolutionary decade. Moreover, the need to rely on Negro troopers was heightened by the fact that in the border areas, where those of Mexican origin resided in large numbers, the U.S. authorities could not rely on Latinos to confront Mexico, if need be. Or so they thought. In New Mexico, for example, the Attorney General was concerned that “Old Mexico Mexicans” may not stand with Washington.13 Earlier, the Attorney General with some exasperation confessed that “the authorities in Washington of course cannot quite appreciate the conditions under which we are laboring down here. The southern part of the state” — the border region — “is composed chieﬂy of native and old Mexico Mexicans whose loyalty to the United States is a matter of doubt in some quarters” and “causes our people to be extremely uneasy at the present time. . . . I have made a close study of the situation and I feel perfectly sure if the Mexicans in old Mexico as a whole start war against the United States that we will have a number of Mexicans in New Mexico who will try to join them.”14 New Mexico’s worry was Mexico’s joy. The Consul of the latter in El Paso,Texas, boasted in  that those of Mexican descent in Arizona and New Mexico were oﬀering “emphatically” to “take up arms” against the United States.The Consul General in San Francisco concurred, as did his counterpart in Phoenix. These Mexicans had “riﬂes” and “pistols” they were eager to use to defend Mexico, he thought. Today the numbers of those who appeared ready to oppose the United States seem rather high—“,” in Brownsville, “,” in San Antonio, “,” in El Paso, and “,” in Phoenix.15 Whatever the case,Washington could not risk the possibility that this was empty verbiage and had to rely even more on its African American troops who, unlike those of Mexican origin and some European immigrants, did not have an allegiance to the real or imagined foes of Washington. Their importance was enhanced further by the fact that in many border counties those of Mexican origin far outnumbered those who were not. As one scholar has put it, “Mexico ﬁgured as the prototype of American business and economic expansion into the underdeveloped world,”16 forming a template for later ventures in Korea and Vietnam, Chile and Cuba, Congo and Angola. Consequently, it was feared at that time that revolutionary transformation in Mexico could decisively impact critical\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nand proﬁtable U.S. investments in the oil and mining sectors, which underscored further the need for Negro troops. During the dramatic decade of the Revolution, the Mexico that Flipper and Johnson encountered was a country of about  million scattered sparsely over a vast area equal to the United States east of the Mississippi. With tremendous mountain ranges and long coastal lowlands, hot southern jungles and a burning northern desert, a great temperate central plateau cut by gorges hundreds of feet deep, Mexico was enchanting, beautiful, and formidable. It was a land of arid agriculture and rich mines, not to mention gushing petroleum.The then Marxist exile Charles Shipman, who was an acquaintance of Johnson, described his adopted homeland as a place “of the lone horseman, the ox-turned treadmill, the handguided wooden plow and (incomparable beast of burden) the burro. Peopled essentially by Indians and part-Indians, most of them poor, ragged and illiterate—born to oppression.”17 The Revolution—a rending upheaval of mass movements marked by profound anticlericalism, far-reaching land reform, deep-seated hostility to U.S. imperialism, and democratic promise— was a direct response to this oppression.According to one analyst, this volcanic eruption “resulted in one million deaths through combat, starvation and disease.” Mexico’s population was said to be . million in , but only . million in . “At least , but some estimate as many as one million Mexicans ﬂed to the United States,”18 bolstering a Mexican American population that was to ally with and, at times, cross swords with, African Americans in urban areas such as Los Angeles. The ouster of the government of Porﬁrio Diaz at the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century also ushered in a period of instability with frequent regime changes and challenges from guerilla and peasant movements led by Pancho Villa in the north and Emiliano Zapata in the south.The Mexican Revolution was the ﬁrst great radical transformation of a society in the twentieth century.Virginia Woolf famously insisted that “on or about December  . . . human character changed.”19 Woolf ’s verbal extravagance also speaks to the profound metamorphosis that was the Mexican Revolution, which was inaugurated as she made her solemn pronouncement. More to the point, Booker T. Washington claimed that he had “never seen the colored people so discouraged and bitter” as they were “in the summer of .”20 Inevitably, disgruntled African Americans began to take a new look at Mexico as it captured front-page headlines during the era of Woolf and\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nWashington.The Mexican Revolution demonstrated to Negroes—just as the Civil War had—that no government was necessarily eternal.The social explosion across the border created opportunities for them to address frontally and forcefully the oppression of white supremacy in the United States, which had led them to become discouraged and bitter. That Mexico would serve as a beacon of hope for Negroes was not new. During the antebellum era thousands of enslaved Africans ﬂed to freedom across the border, as Mexico had abolished slavery long before the United States. As this capital ﬂight enraged powerful slave owners and complicated diplomatic relations with Mexico, the latter realized that collaborating with Negroes might be mutually proﬁtable.21 Actually, Mexico was not alone in recognizing the beneﬁt of making a special appeal to the dispossessed. In  James Dickson, a “poet-propagandist for the Texas revolution,” sought to knock together an “Indian Liberating Army” that would set up a vast secessionist realm in the present-day southwest United States where “only Indians could own land.” This compelled John Quincy Adams “to deliver a geopolitical analysis on the ﬂoor of Congress, which he then wrote out for newspaper and pamphlet distribution. . . . [H]e warned that the United States risked a multifront war with Seminoles and fugitive slaves in Florida; Mexico had reason to ally with Indians on the western border; and over all loomed the possibility that European powers might intervene. The United States would ﬁnd itself ﬁghting a ‘Mexican, Indian, Negro and English war.’” Adams’s words struck a chord in Mexico where his speech was “received as a global statement supporting their cause against U.S. expansion. They distributed a pamphlet translation.” As in the  –  era, Adams’s “strategic vision operated in combination with his Yankee patriotism to suggest that Congress, if it was to head oﬀ the interethnic and international threat, might have to use its war powers to mobilize [the] Black population in the U.S. interest—that is, as elements in the modern, New Englandish [sic] social revolution for which he was a long term spokesman.”22 Driven to sympathy with the Negroes, Adams wound up defending enslaved Africans who had engineered a bloody revolt on the ship Amistad. In similar fashion, the United States itself was compelled to make “racial” reforms in order to undercut the subversive appeals of Jack Johnson and Mexico and their German and Japanese allies. Something similar occurred again during the Cold War when national security concerns led once more to “racial” reform.23 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nHistorically, the fractious United States, a settler state knocked together by sullen slaves, dispossessed indigenous peoples, and European and Asian immigrants with ties of various levels of intensity to their homelands, faced grave national security concerns. Negroes and advocates for Indians were not the only domestic constituencies who sensed that the border might be the Achilles heel of an increasingly powerful United States. After the Civil War, embittered Confederates ﬂed to Mexico where they helped prop up the puppet regime of Maximillian installed by France, which likewise saw an advantage in pressuring the United States from the border. During the war, the Confederates sought vainly to forge a deal with Mexico in order to undercut Washington. The celebrated Virginian, Matthew Fontaine Maury, “engaged in a long series of negotiations with Emperor Napoleon of France and the Archduke Maximilian of Austria concerning the separation of California from the United States and its restoration to Mexico as a reward for French intervention on the side of the South.”24 Negro soldiers again rode to the rescue of the United States. George Washington Williams, a budding historian fresh from dispatching the Confederacy into oblivion, “received a commission as lieutenant in the First Battery from the state of Tamaulipas.” By helping to oust the puppet regime from power he removed the possibility of a Confederate “contra” base along the border, bolstered by European powers. He was not alone.25 The idea of retaking the lands seized by the United States from Mexico during the  war reemerged during the Revolution.The bold and breathtaking “Plan of San Diego,” apparently backed by Germany and Japan, suggested depriving the United States of these lands (including Texas and California), establishing independent Negro and Native American republics in their stead, and, not least, liquidating the Euro-American male population there. The “Zimmerman Telegram” purportedly revealed yet another plan by Mexico, in league with Germany, to retake lands earlier snatched by the United States during the mid-nineteenthcentury war.26 These brazen and daring notions were preﬁgured in the minds of black ﬁction writers. In , The Crisis, the oﬃcial journal of the NAACP, edited by W. E. B. Du Bois, published a story about a Jack Johnson–type ﬁgure pressed to join Washington in resisting a takeover by Mexico, aided by Japan: “Already the Orientals, through their secret treaties with Mexico, were at the beginning of things. The American consulate in Mexico City had been damaged; several Americans in Mexico had been imprisoned, tortured and killed; shots, always ‘random shots,’ had been ﬁred 7\n\nIntroduction\n\nacross the border into the United States, wounding our citizens and destroying property; then began the desertion of our Negro soldiers to Mexican ranks.There these trained men of a race never before disloyal to their land or ﬂag, manned the machine guns for the ‘Mexicans.’” “Disloyalty” was “spreading among the Negro troops.” Though ﬁctional, this scenario could not fail to resonate in a nation heavily dependent on such troops at a time when Mexico was talking about forging an alliance with Japan and Germany, while an overstretched United States was about to contemplate sending even more troops to Europe.27 Negroes were complaining and quoting Kipling: “It’s Tommy this and Tommy that . . . and chuck him out, the Brute. But it’s please to walk in front, sir, when the guns begin to shoot.”28 Riding to the rescue was Jed Blackburn, “the discredited Negro prize ﬁghter.” Negroes were demanding “justice” in exchange for defending the United States. Even Blackburn was reluctant at ﬁrst. “‘What!’ roared the scowling giant. ‘Fight for this country?’ Then Japan bombarded San Francisco. Then San Diego. Finally, he led a , strong Negro army to repel the invasion—and the nation was saved.”29 There was something in the air that preﬁgured the “Plan of San Diego” and impelled thoughts of Negro subversion and sedition. With every passing day it was becoming increasingly evident that the combination of Mexico—hostile toward Washington, not least because of the  war and the perceived dominance by U.S. investors of the Mexican economy—and a battered Negro population across the border with unresolved grievances, had created a combustible situation. It was ironic that the force standing between the annihilation of Euro-Americans and the machinations of their protagonists were Negro troops who had proved their mettle by subduing Native Americans and who were now being asked to repel attacks from Mexico.30 Because the soldiers—even Negro soldiers—were armed, they were a potent symbol of authority in the dankest precincts of Jim Crow such as the former Confederate state of Texas and the Southwest generally. Some Negro soldiers in Columbus, New Mexico (site of a raid by Pancho Villa, one of the most devastating attacks on the U.S. mainland before  September ) “and black women ran into whites on sidewalks and forced them to yield the right of way in order to avoid trouble.” In this topsyturvy world, there were “white women passing as black to avoid local or military mores on race-mixing.”31 In , as the awesome prospect of the United States entering the European war combined with anxiety about the dangers to the South, some Negro soldiers in Houston responded to 8\n\nIntroduction\n\nJim Crow by using their arms and leaving a number of dead whites in their wake. According to one historian, this helped to revive “ancient fears of Nat Turner and John Brown”32 and, like John Quincy Adams decades earlier, convinced the sober-minded that white supremacy could not rule in the old way. In short, it contributed to what I have elsewhere termed the “general crisis of white supremacy,”33 wherein racism was increasingly unable to work its magic, not least because those who suﬀered its perpetual indignity were unwilling to accept its dictates. Thus, prior to the Houston tragedy the Arizona authorities decided that the better part of wisdom “would advise against [exhibition] of Birth of a Nation in this state at the present time.”34 This racist ﬁlm, which gloriﬁed the Ku Klux Klan, was endorsed by President Woodrow Wilson and electriﬁed countless Euro-Americans, could not be wholeheartedly embraced in this southwestern state that was on edge and still relied on Negro troops to repress still restive Native Americans and threats from Mexico. George H. Smalley, secretary of the state’s Council of Defense told Miles Merrill, President of the Loyalty League in Bisbee, where Negro troops could be useful in controlling rebellious miners, that he could “only express my personal sympathy with your movement to suppress the presentation of the Birth of the [sic] Nation in view of the Colored Boys’ prompt response for service in their country’s war crisis.”35 A few years later, a signiﬁcant victory against white supremacy took place in the sprawling border town of El Paso, Texas, as the “white primary”—which severely vitiated black voting rights—was successfully challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.36 El Paso proved to be a critical battleground during the Revolution. Sitting adjacent to Juarez, Mexico, it contained a burgeoning population of Mexican descent and a growing community of African Americans. There the two groups developed ties of singular intimacy. As early as  Negro men engaged in militant protest against enforcement of a state law against miscegenation that would have complicated the lives of all those who had married women of Mexican descent, who were deﬁned as “white.”37 Negroes also had a ringside seat as the Revolution unfolded a stone’s throw from their homes years later. Frances Hills was born in  but she recalled later that at her “old house on  Park Avenue [in El Paso] there were holes where Pancho Villa’s shots from over in Mexico had landed over here. . . .That was during my mother’s lifetime that that happened because she was aware of that. She talked to me about it.”38 It was diﬃcult for Negroes to remain indiﬀerent to the Revolution as bullets whizzed by 9\n\nIntroduction\n\nWest Texas. They pondered the momentous developments unfolding in Mexico and determined what it all meant—and acted accordingly. Though the Mexican guerilla leader Pancho Villa was viliﬁed relentlessly in Washington—in terms similar to those used today to describe Osama bin Laden—he became something of a folk hero among many Negroes.A Negro pastor in Baltimore claimed that Villa was “his brother.” He said that his own father was a “slave; that his grandfather was a white man and that from pictures he has seen of Villa there can be no doubt about the relationship.”39 No, no, said another interlocutor.True,Villa was an “American Negro” but he was a “former member of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry” of the heralded “Buﬀalo Soldiers,” “none other than George Golsby.”The erudite “Professor Frederick L. Monsen of New York City, an expert anthropologist” averred, “I have known Villa personally for years. He was my guide for several months while I was making investigations in Mexico. He has Negro blood in his veins.”40 Friedrich Katz’s comprehensive biography of Villa acknowledges that he had “crispy kinky black hair of the Negro type.”41 The Negroes’ fascination with Villa reﬂected a long-time engagement with Mexico itself.The father of Langston Hughes, the Harlem Bard, was one of many Negroes to escape to Mexico in search of a refuge from Jim Crow. Hughes himself spent a considerable amount of time there, perfecting his ﬂuent Spanish.42 In the early s Richard Wright declared that “for a black man Mexico was a welcome haven.”43 The talented bassist Charles Mingus was “born on the border, and grew up near it. He had family from New Mexico that spoke [Spanish] and often said he was Mexican himself.” He spent his declining days in Mexico, died there, and his ashes were “wrapped” in a “box in the kind of Mexican blanket on display at every marketplace in turista Mexico.”44 As Jack Johnson was crossing the border northward to face an uncertain fate in a prison cell, Reverend Julius O’Pettigrew of Oklahoma was contacting the Mexican consul in Calexico, California, in the hope of moving southward toward freedom. His family, along with thirty other black families wanted to emigrate to Mexico. Why? The U.S. government did not provide the legal protection he pleaded for. Negroes were subject to countless insults and fraudulent contracts, they were assassinated and lynched and burned like beefsteak on a stake on the merest pretext by those who deﬁned themselves as “white.”They wanted to become Mexican citizens. Rather quickly the consul concluded that his government 10\n\nIntroduction\n\nwould permit the entry of all these families, reinforcing Mexico’s historic role as a refuge for refugees of all types.45 Perhaps Johnson was smiling as he surrendered to the U.S. authorities because he recognized that the Mexican Revolution was of no small moment for a persecuted and tormented African American population.\n\n11\n\nchapte r 1\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nThe Muslim armies that invaded and occupied Spain and Portugal beginning in  included the precursors of African Americans — soldiers from sub-Saharan Africa. Africans, consequently, were a factor in the New World virtually from the onset of Columbus’s journey, if not before.1 Tucson is one of the oldest settlements in the nation now known as the United States.There are “claims that the city is even older than either of the contestants for ﬁrst honors—Santa Fe and St. Augustine,” for “according to authentic records, Marcos de Niza and the Negro, Estevanico, explored Arizona in . . . .We can place the date of Tucson’s settlement in .”2 The noted New Mexican archivist and writer Myra Ellen Jenkins has observed that the famed Pueblo Revolt of , “which drove the Spanish from New Mexico for twelve years,” was led by a “Negro, or at least a mulatto.”3 Africans ﬁgure signiﬁcantly in the early history of the “land of enchantment.” Consider Sebastian Rodriguez, a “pure bred Negro from Africa.”The “earliest mention of him is in .”“Both of his parents were ‘jungle’ Negroes [sic]” and “might have come to New Spain by way of Brazil; his birthplace, however, was most likely a small river or the name of a district in Luanda [Angola].” A drummer with the military, he became a “town crier” in New Mexico and by  was a major landowner in Santa Fe.4 12\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nAccording to Robert Lloyd Carlton, “around  percent of the Spanish-Mexican population of Upper California in  had been of partNegro ancestry.”5 “Many of the ﬁrst settlers of Los Angeles,” says Scott Tadao Kurashige, “came from the Mexican city of Rosario located in the Sinaloa region where people of African descent and mixed ancestry were common.”6 As Mexico surged to independence from Spain in the early nineteenth century, those of African descent played a prominent role. “Father Miguel Hidalgo, the ﬁrst leader of the revolt against Spain, issued several decrees in late  demanding immediate manumission of all slaves on pain of death.”7 Theodore G.Vincent writes that the “mule driver Vicente Guerrero was Mexico’s equivalent of the United States’ Washington and Lincoln.” He was a “descendant of the , to , African slaves brought to colonial Mexico, he also had indigenous and Spanish roots.”To be sure, the color line in Mexico was not absent but it was not drawn as sharply as in the United States and, in any case, it was directed in the ﬁrst place toward the indigenous population. Moreover, given ongoing tensions between the United States and Mexico, it made simple good sense for the latter to befriend the most disenchanted residents of the former. In  the German visitor Carl Christian Beecher compared the legal status of Afro-Mexicans with African Americans. “These blacks,” he said, “as is known, are free in the Republic of Mexico; which is to say, they enjoy, intimately, the same rights as do the rest of the inhabitants of the state, which is not the case in the United States of North America, where, as a result of the laws, or for prejudices, the blacks are humiliated and pressed down to the category of the lowest level of men.” Guerrero had used “the September  independence celebration in  to issue a presidential edict intended to deﬁnitely end the institution of slavery. Guerrero had the federal district oﬃcial, Jose Maria Tormel, write the decree. Tormel had tried for three years to get the Congress of Mexico to deﬁnitively abolish slavery so as to discourage the inﬂux of white settlers to Texas from the United States, who set up slave plantations thanks to special contracts and stood apart from the Spanish-speaking Mexicans.”8 Mexican oﬃcials “had attempted to abolish the slave system gradually through the Colonization Law of , which emancipated slave children on their fourteenth birthdays.Another law in  forbade the further importation of slaves into Texas, but white colonists”—who viewed this maneuver as a threat worthy of secession—“simply ignored this statute in the 13\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nface of weak Mexican enforcement.”9 According to James SoRelle, these colonists were responsible for the fact that despite stubborn competition, “slavery in Texas was worse than in other states.” In Texas, where the “Old South” merged seamlessly with the “Wild West,” brutal confrontations occurred between masters and enslaved Africans. But unlike their besieged compatriots elsewhere in the country, the latter had a convenient escape hatch on the border.They found it simpler to escape to the south than to the west or north. Interviewed in , ninety-two-year-old San Antonio resident Felix Haywood, a former slave, chortled, “There was no reason to run up north. All we had to do was to walk south, and we’d be free as soon as [we] cross[ed] the Rio Grande. In Mexico you could be free.” The former slave Walter Rimm felt similarly. “All we had to do was walk, but walk south and we’d be free as soon as we crossed the Rio Grande. In Mexico you could be free,” he added with emphasis. “They didn’t care what color you were, black, white, yellow or blue. Hundreds of slaves did go to Mexico”—actually thousands—“and got on all right. We would hear about them and how they were going to be Mexicans. They brought up their children to speak only Mexican [sic].”10 U.S. slaveholders recognized early on that abolitionism in Mexico was the open backdoor facilitating the massive ﬂight of capital in the form of enslaved Africans. As early as  the authorities of New Orleans contacted the Mexican government about their eﬀort to recover their “property” which had escaped and found refuge south of the border.11 Confederate Texans found it hard to forget that enslaved Africans in that state escaped and fought with Mexico against them and their predecessors during the war of the s.12 A century later, the famed Negro journalist J. A. Rogers, in writing of “Vicente Guerrero—Liberator of Mexico,” acknowledged, “It would be interesting to know, however, just how large a part the decree [of emancipation] by this Negro president played in the presence of Texas in the American Union today, for the revolt of Texas from the Mexican republic was clearly inspired by the fact that the temper of the Mexican masses was against slavery.”13 Mexico’s reputation as an abolitionist stronghold may explain why the famed black frontiersman Jim Beckwourth was accused of siding with Mexico during the  war.14 This hearty pioneer was not alone in his presumed pro-Mexican predilections. James N. Leiker is no doubt accurate in writing that “during most of the nineteenth century, African Americans held Mexicans in 14\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nhigher esteem than other immigrant groups.” “Tejanos even aided runaway slaves by hiding them in homes and churches until they could be shepherded into Coahuila or Tamaulipas.” There was an “overall friendly tone of black-Hispanic interaction.”15 Because of the threat of contagion posed by “free West Indian, Northern and Latin American sailors, among others, the port of Galveston too required captains to either deny their black sailors shore leave while in port or to place them in jail for the duration of the ship’s visit.” Though Texas had bolted from Mexico, it could not forget that the noted abolitionist Benjamin Lundy, who published the ﬁerce antislavery polemic “The War in Texas” in , “had received permission from Mexican authorities to establish a colony of free Negroes [in Corpus Christi] prior to the Texas Revolution.” As it turned out, slavery—or rather the “freedom” to engage in slavery — was a “primary cause of the Texas Revolution, aﬀected debates regarding the annexation of Texas” by the United States, and “played a considerable role during the Mexican-American war and in Manifest Destiny generally, and, of course, was the reason why Texas joined the Confederacy at the start of the Civil War.”16 As the Civil War approached, there was powerful incentive for enslaved Africans to ﬂee to the south. In  the inveterate traveler Frederick Law Olmsted quoted a Mexican oﬃcial saying that the ﬂeeing Negroes “could make money faster than Mexicans themselves could, because they had more sense. [And] the Mexican government was very just to them, [so] they could always have their rights as fully protected as [if] they were Mexican born.” In addition, discrimination against the Indians was a higher priority in Mexico than that against those of African descent, thus creating at least a small opening for opportunity. Still, “Afro-Mexicans,” who often faced more discrimination than arriving U.S. Negroes, sought to “escape the laws of caste in Central Mexico [and] signed on to help settle the wilds of California. There many took important political oﬃce after Mexican independence. During the ‘Yankee’ invasion of California in , it was said that the strongest resistance was mounted by Governor Pio Pico and his brother Andres, the zeal for Mexico on the part of these two Afro-Californianos clearly being related to the fears of the type of law the legally racist United States would impose.”17 It was also the indefatigable Olmsted who recalled during his stay in antebellum Texas that he heard “stories” of the “danger to slavery in the West by the fraternizing of the blacks with the Mexicans.They helped them in all their bad habits, married them, stole a living from them, and ran them 15\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\noﬀ every day to Mexico.”18 One of the many reasons for lingering hostility toward those of Mexican origin in Texas was the perception that they were hostile toward slavery. In the s local slaveholders in a Texas neighborhood were infuriated simply because “several Mexican families moved into the vicinity.” They charged that the “Hispanic Texans aided slave runaways and intermingled in a spirit of equality with bondsmen, thus stirring up ‘insubordination.’” Thus “they adopted and enforced extra-legal methods of ridding the community of ‘rascally peons’ as well as curbing the freedom of Austin slaves . . . the vigilantes summarily ejected about twenty families and other Mexican Texans received equally rough treatment the next year.”19 Certainly, “to many blacks, the words ‘border’ and ‘Mexico’ meant freedom and opportunity.” Texas oﬃcials estimated that by  more than four thousand black fugitives, valued at more than $. million, had entered northern Mexico.20 “By the mid-s several Texas counties had passed laws prohibiting Mexicans from communicating with slaves.” In a precursor to the “Plan of San Diego” during the Revolution, Colorado County’s “Anglos hanged three blacks and evicted all Mexicans after uncovering a supposed plot to kill local whites and ﬁght their way to the border.”21 This occurred in  as regional tensions over slavery skyrocketed. Reportedly, two hundred enslaved Africans were involved. In addition to liquidating most of the Euro-Americans there, they planned to plunder their homes and then escape with suﬃcient capital to establish a livelihood. The accused were said to have accumulated pistols, knives, guns, and ammunition.22 It was in Mexico’s interest to attract U.S. Negroes to their northern border as a ﬁrewall against further Euro-American advance; recognizing this, enslaved Africans were inspired to make ever more desperate plans for escape. To say that the border was permeable is an understatement. One reason that there had not been many Negroes in antebellum Brownsville, to cite one example among many, is that before the Civil War slave owners had hesitated to bring their enslaved Africans to such Texas border towns for fear they might scurry across the border.23 Thousands of enslaved Africans were able to escape into Mexico without trouble because the border, called the Rio Grande in the United States, was little more than a heavy-duty stream. There was “scarcely a bend in [this] river,” said one commentator, that “cannot be forded with the exception of a few feet of swimming.” This also meant that aggressive ﬁlibusters from the United States could easily invade Mexico. 16\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nIn fact, the two phenomena were linked, as ﬁlibusters wanted to seize Mexican soil in order to extend the border further south, providing a further buﬀer for slaveholding and making capital ﬂight more diﬃcult. Sam Houston himself “lost” two slaves and he was far from being alone. One ﬁlibuster complained acridly in the s, “Something must be done for the protection of slave property in this state. Negroes are running oﬀ daily. During the past week, seven slaves left this portion of the country. Let the frontiers of slavery begin to recede and when or where the wave of recession may be arrested God only knows.” Getting Mexico “Americanized and Southernized” was therefore a fervently held objective for ﬁlibusters.24 Little wonder. In San Antonio in  one slave owner concluded glumly that Negroes “cannot be kept here without great risk to their running away.” At that time the country south of San Antonio was open, ﬂat, and uninhabited, the Mexican border was not far away, and, of course, there were always Mexicans more than happy to aid enslaved Africans in escaping. Moreover, often these Africans took slave owners’ property with them when they escaped, compounding the loss. This led to the creation of a “vigilance committee and a police force to stop the practice.”25 The latter had to contend not only with rebellious Negroes and their Mexican allies but also with Native Americans imbued with a ﬁrm sense of sovereignty. In the southwest, for example, “the Kiowas also quickly emerged as the deadliest of the southwestern Amerindians. In proportion to the numbers, they killed more Anglo-Americans on the Texas-Kansas frontier than the Comanches.” It is striking that the Indians were referred to as “red niggers,” a telling indication of the weight of slavery on the minds of English-speakers. Moreover, the leader of the Confederacy, Jeﬀerson Davis, who served as Secretary of War from –, was “decisive for the West in a way that few Americans notice. . . . It was his army and his policies, renewed in the s after they were aborted in the Civil War, that carried out the ﬁnal conquests of the western Amerindians.”26 Though the “Buﬀalo Soldiers” were to become a major spearhead against Native Americans, before the Civil War their mutual opponents often linked the sad fates of Black and Red alike. Though the Mexican government was notorious for its unfavorable treatment of Indians, they sought assiduously to attract the Seminoles of Florida who had warred against the United States for years. The Seminoles, who in a sense had merged with runaway enslaved Africans in Florida,“were attracted strongly by the idea of the Mexican colony.”They 17\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nestablished the Seminole maroon settlement in Coahuila, Mexico, which became an object of hatred for the slave owners of Texas after Mexico helped them ﬁght oﬀ U.S. slave hunters in the s.27 Interestingly, the Seminoles had ﬂed a “Hispanic”-dominated Florida for a “Hispanic”dominated Mexico, for “once Florida became a territory of the United States the Indian, African and white worlds that had once coexisted and shared space were deliberately separated.”28 In a foretaste of the intoxicating era of the Revolution, in the antebellum era Mexico never relinquished the notion of trying to “persuade the Indians” of the southwest to “turn against the young republic of Texas.”29 But this kind of plotting worked both ways for there were those in the United States, particularly in the south, who lusted hungrily after Mexican territory even after the conﬁscatory war of the s. The infamous “Knights of the Golden Circle,” for example, sought to seize territory in Mexico and elsewhere in the hemisphere as the basis for a great slave empire.30 In aid of this scheme, ﬁre-eating southerners clamored for the reopening of the African slave trade. Galveston, the hometown of Jack Johnson, was only a few hundred miles by ship from Havana; as late as the s Africans were being smuggled into Texas from there. However, these illicit activities backﬁred as the “unassimilated Negroes” were rebellious, unreconciled to the deprivation of their liberty, and consequently more willing than U.S. Negroes of older vintage to escape to nearby Mexico.31 However, too much can be made of the antislavery impulse among the population of Mexican origin. In , when the Confederate military was collapsing throughout the south, pro-Confederacy Rafael Armijo and Manuel Armijo, merchants with stores in Albuquerque, Mesilla, and other towns continued to proﬁt by selling great quantities of merchandise to the secessionists. Indeed, they bought and sold enslaved Negroes as late as  April , helping to bolster the nascent proslavery forces in New Mexico.32 During antebellum times New Mexico was inﬂuenced deeply by the slave state of Missouri, the other end of a major trade and transportation route, and by its immediate neighbor to the east,Texas, a state in good standing in the Confederacy. In  an attempt was made to bar the entry of Negroes to this sparsely populated region.33 Nevertheless, “most Tejanos,” or Texans of Mexican origin, “refused to support the Confederate cause.”34 The secession itself upset the previous consensus. Of course Negroes remained hostile toward slavery but some Mexicans saw an advantage in 18\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nsplitting their powerful northern neighbor or even manipulating Confederates as a pawn against Washington. Recall that this was at a time when France, which had not relinquished its dream of reviving its hemispheric empire, had seized power in Mexico, while the United States was enmeshed in the Civil War. It was not as if Washington, particularly in this conﬂict’s early stages, was so fervently antislavery that it would have been an abomination to oppose the United States. How was Mexico supposed to respond when during the Civil War the United States “produced preliminary terms for black colonies in Mexico, British Honduras, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica before the U.S. government’s insistence upon the colonists’ retaining U.S. citizenship caused a collapse of negotiations”? Sanctifying the presence of U.S. citizens in their midst— citizens who owed a debt of ersatz “freedom” to Washington—could have created a permanent force for destabilization.35 U.S. Negroes were not predisposed to back the puppet regime in Mexico City, particularly in light of stories in the southern press in August  asserting that Maximilian was amassing troops along the Rio Grande and contracting with foreign speculators for a large number of Negroes to be kept in slavery for ten years on the understanding that their temporary bondage might be renewed and they could be transferred for sale without being consulted.36 Not surprisingly, Negroes sided with Maximilian’s opponents, just as Confederates gathered on the other side of the barricades. After the Civil War a number of Confederates, including the aforementioned Matthew Fontaine Maury,37 ﬂed ignominiously to Mexico where they hoped to establish a base against the United States and continue their traitorous rebellion by other means. But Negro soldiers and an enraged Mexican population put an end to these pipe dreams by ousting the French. But thousands of Confederates unwilling to reconcile themselves to U.S. rule continued to ﬂee south after the Civil War; the fact that “most Confederates in Mexico had collaborated with Emperor Maximilian” made their continued stay unpleasant, particularly after his ouster.38 Vengeful “former Confederates,” seeking retribution for their perceived ill-treatment south of the border, “launched several raids into Mexico” after the Civil War,“sometimes wearing blackface or Indian disguises. One of the most notorious raids occurred in late  when a band of  to  Texans crossed to the Rio Grande’s west bank near Fort Clark and murdered a group of villagers at Resurreccion.” This enraged Mexico and heightened tensions along the border, ironically and perhaps deliberately 19\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nfrom the Confederates’ viewpoint, leading to “confrontations between Mexicans and African American soldiers.” These “armed enforcers of American aggression now became a familiar sight” along the border. Negroes found themselves in repeated confrontation not only with rebellious Native Americans. In , for example, “Mexicans and Tejanos . . . began to riot, looting homes and villages with cries of ‘kill all Americans and death to the gringos.’” In these circumstances, armed Negro soldiers became the thin blue line between a white supremacist order and a revolt against it.This paradox was far from comforting to the U.S. authorities, for “fears about a multiracial coalition of Blacks, Indians and Mexicans had accompanied the ﬁrst Anglo settlers to Texas and remained a continuing source of anxiety through the post-Civil War years.” Hanging like smog in the warm borderland air was the weighty question: “Could Blacks be trusted to ﬁght other people of color?”39 James Leiker, like others, has concluded that “during most of the nineteenth century, Blacks held Mexicans in higher esteem that they did other immigrant groups, a legacy of Mexico’s historical opposition to slavery.” This fed their desire to assist Mexico. “In the s,” for example, “Black Texans even had approached Mexico’s government with plans to launch a colonization movement there and boost Mexico’s cotton production.”40 No doubt they felt that giving their lives to Mexico made more sense than doing the same north of the border. Blacks were not allowed to ﬁght to protect their own interests in the United States.“In , Blacks in Harrison County attempted to organize their own militia and protect themselves from racial violence. Local [whites] with the help of state forces, crushed the movement, but rumors of armed, uniformed Blacks provoked paranoiac fears that lasted for months.”41 Though Mexico and those ﬂeeing white supremacy in the United States supported one another, their mutual response to the indigenous people was another matter altogether. Like the “Buﬀalo Soldiers,” the “Seminole Maroons” who returned to the United States after the Civil War “played a major role in helping to clear West Texas of Indian bands hostile to white settlement of the area.”They “killed, maimed, imprisoned and destroyed the villages and properties of diverse bands of Kickapoos, Apaches, Cheyennes, Kowas and Comanches. . . .They played a major role in furthering the policy that had brought them back to the United States by driving these bands onto reservations or deep into the Mexican frontier and facilitating white expansion into West Texas.”42 The role of these celebrated “Seminole Negro Indian Scouts” was heightened by the reluc20\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\ntance of the governments of Benito Juarez and others in Mexico City to crack down on “raiding” Indians who crossed the border freely into the United States.43 This changed after Porﬁrio Diaz came to power. However, those who subdued Native Americans on behalf of a white supremacist government may have thought they were simply doing their duty as “citizens” (albeit third-class citizens), or that their welfare would improve by killing Indians. In reality they only undermined their long-term interests by weakening the opposition to a white supremacist government in Washington. The Negro soldiers—or “Seminole” soldiers, which was functionally the same thing—might have noticed that just as they were aiding in the “winning of the west,” crushing Native American resistance and preventing those of Mexican origin from ﬁghting back, Negroes continued to endure diﬃculties in the land they were busy securing. In San Diego County, for example, the immediate neighbor of Baja California, Mexico, “it was not until well after the Civil War that whites gave up their attempts to keep blacks from entering the state. Before  a black could not testify against a white in a court of law, vote in public elections, intermarry with whites, or farm on certain lands.” Even though there were only about ﬁfty-ﬁve Negroes in San Diego County in , equality was far from being a reality.44 After the death of Reconstruction some African Americans organized to migrate en masse to Mexico. There were also countless individual migrations, as evidenced by the father of Langston Hughes, the writer. Shortly after he was born, his parents separated because his father wanted to escape the United States and go “where a colored man could get ahead and make money quicker, and my mother did not want to go. My father went to Cuba, and then to Mexico, where there wasn’t any color line, or any Jim Crow.”45 That Langston Hughes’s father was not alone in wanting to go to Mexico is indicated by the experience of the Alabama Negro colony in Mexico in the s. Fleeing pell mell from Jim Crow, lynchings, and the rest, Negroes were leaving for Liberia, Central America, and elsewhere.There were “ten large colonies” in Mexico. A Mexican oﬃcial had assured the migrants that his nation “will be their Canaan, the land of hope and promise, where they would ﬁnd relief from the persecution of southern whites.” He wanted them to grow cotton, a process with which they were quite familiar. Hundreds left Alabama and were “warmly supported by the Mexican government.”46 It was “one of the greatest colonization experiments in Alabama history.”47 As it turned out, 21\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nthis migration project was unsuccessful and many Negroes returned to the United States; however, the dream of escaping tyranny persisted.48 Surely this vision animated the imagination of William Ellis. Born in  on a small farm near Victoria,Texas, as the Civil War was winding to a halt, by the s this “mulatto” was an “entrepreneur who often claimed Cuban and Mexican origins,” a common trait among Negroes seeking to escape the ravages of Negrophobia. Early in his career he worked as an agent for a leather and hide merchant in San Antonio, who sent him to Mexico. By  he became the “ﬁrst Negro broker” on Wall Street, then became the “Duke of Harrar, an Ethiopian province” which led to “two million acres of land” being “bestowed upon him.” He “seems to have continued working as a broker in New York, with a branch oﬃce in Mexico City,” where he died “while on a business trip.”49 One of Ellis’s many ventures involved establishing a Negro colony in Mexico that would raise coﬀee and cotton. Despite his attraction to Ethiopia, he “pointed out that Mexico was not only closer but more civilized than Africa.” This was apparently not an isolated view. When the Negro emigrationist Henry Turner proposed migration as a “solution for race problems . . . shouts of ‘Africa!’ were met with shouts of ‘Mexico!’”50 Ellis made a persuasive case for emigration. “[As long] as the Negro is suppressed as he is in the United States,” he thundered,“the better class of them will seek new ﬁelds, and Mexico, standing at the very doors of the United States, oﬀering inducements to all, will prove a welcome home to the Negro.” When he visited Mexico City in  the leadership there agreed to the idea of a massive Negro colony of twenty thousand. Six years later he agreed to bring ﬁve thousand. The press in the southern United States was rife with rumors that hundreds of thousands of Negroes would follow Ellis as if he were some sort of Pied Piper. Ellis and his followers were encouraged by the fact that in  Luis N. Fouche, a Negro from Florida, had established a colony named “Eureka” near Tampico, and the same year forty other Negroes settled near Veracruz.This was in contrast to Bishop Turner, who only managed to bring a thousand Negroes to Africa after two decades of struggle. Yet Ellis’s project also proved to be unsuccessful.51 This may have had something to do with Ellis himself. His experience convinced him that “Negroes are worthless as pioneers” and denied “emphatically all stories of cruelty or shooting and says that the company has simply charged up [to] one hundred thousand dollars the experiment cost them to proﬁt and loss . . . this incident has created a very bitter feeling 22\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nthroughout Mexico against the American Negro.” One Negro, Anthony Jones, said that “on reaching the hacienda the Negroes found themselves in the worst form of bondage; they were cruelly and inhumanely treated; the food was not ﬁt to eat. No letter to friends in the States was allowed to go out in the mails.” There were even “raging” cases of “smallpox.” This account was disputed by an oﬃcial investigation that found that “the houses” in Mexico were better as a whole than those used by Mexican farm laborers. The food was the same. The pay under the contract was “better than that given to Mexicans.”52 Nevertheless, African Americans were understandably entranced by Ellis’s message.Writing from Mexico City in , he reported that he had “just received my concessions from the Mexican government for the introduction of (,) twenty thousand Afro-American colonists from the southern United States of America into the states of Veracruz, Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosi, in which states have over three million acres of rich lands and from the Mexican government I receive for every person over () twelve years of age ($) ﬁfty dollars in government bonds bearing (%) six percent interest. I have  (two thousand) families ready to start within the next () days. I will furnish all the colonists for the ﬁrst two years with all necessary farming tools, implements, wagons, also clothing and provisions of every kind.” Not surprisingly, many Negroes starving in the wilds of Jim Crow leapt at the opportunity.53 However, for those who were poverty-stricken in the ﬁrst place it was diﬃcult to ﬁnd the wherewithal to move abroad.This proved to be an almost insuperable obstacle for en masse emigration. Those who had managed to accumulate a modicum of capital, such as the father of Langston Hughes, fared much better, either as migrants or entrepreneurs. Consider Junius G. Groves of Edwardsville, Kansas, for example. He shipped potatoes and other farm products to nearly every portion of the United States, “and to Mexico.” He “never found his color to be a hindrance to him in business” there.54 Thomas Bass, a Negro rancher living in Mexico, would have agreed. His horses had won “blue ribbons” at state fairs in Iowa and Minnesota and he did even more south of the border. As a result, it was hard to suppress the desire to emigrate. In , James Fowler established the “Colored Colonization Company of San Diego” and it was not long before it declared,“the Mexican emigration fever is rife here.”55 Of course, Negroes were not the only ones who thought of repairing to Mexico. In  Jim Crow advocates proposed to the authorities in Mexico that a section of their territory be utilized for a Negro colony 23\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nestablished by segregationists. Not surprisingly, this proposition was viewed more negatively than similar ideas emanating from Negroes themselves, since the Mexicans feared that their purposes were malign and, like similar proposals during the Civil War, were little more than a Trojan horse.56 Mexico was not the only country in Central America viewed as a refuge by besieged Negroes. Beginning in the s, as Reconstruction ceased, between seventy and eighty Negroes arrived weekly in Puerto Barrios in Guatemala from New Orleans particularly.They were part of a contingent of railroad workers who were pivotal in this industry throughout the entire region, including Mexico. These “Afro-North Americans . . . catalyzed the Guatemalan railroad labor movement and established a precedent for other Guatemalan labor movements.” They “organized the earliest challenge to the state and multinational corporations.” By the early s, they “composed the largest segment of the railroad and banana industries’ workforce.” There were few women. Many were artisans. They were enthusiastic advocates of the revolutionary ferment of . On the other hand, they had a tendency to side with Euro-American contractors in the latter’s conﬂicts with the Guatemalan government. Perhaps this was why the U.S. Consul there defended them, as “an aﬀront to any U.S. citizen was considered an aﬀront to the entire nation.” Nevertheless, these Negroes “staged the ﬁrst public protest against the state and foreign capital in Guatemala” and were blunt “agents of deﬁance” with “reputations as revolutionaries and strike instigators.” But with the advent of the Mexican Revolution, antiforeigner—particularly anti-U.S.—sentiment spread like wildﬁre in Central America and the presence of Negroes was compromised, becoming virtually untenable. However, their presence smoothed the path for the ﬂamboyant Jack Johnson’s arrival in Mexico City.57\n\n24\n\nchapte r 2\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nJack Johnson was alienated. Criminal charges ﬁled against him because of his consensual relationship with a EuroAmerican woman had forced him into exile.White supremacists were infuriated with him since his victories in the ring over various “white” challengers — and the presumed arrogance with which he had dispatched them—had, in their mind, provided a vicious blow to the solar plexus of “racial” superiority itself. Films of these matches were banned routinely and some in Washington, and the region ranging from Austin to Richmond particularly, wanted to make him pay. Of course, there were consolations for Johnson.Through a lengthy exile that had included stops in Britain and Russia, he had maintained a distinct fondness for the Spanish-speaking world, embracing the ambience of Barcelona and Havana before settling down in Mexico City. The revolutionary atmosphere of Mexico worked on him like a tonic. Trundling about the broad boulevards of the capital in a late-model automobile, he was as much of a ﬁxture in the city as the Spanish colonial architecture that gave the capital its distinctiveness. He may have been gone from the United States but he was far from forgotten. The memories of his riveting boxing matches with outgunned “white” opponents were ever present. When James J. Jeﬀries lost to 25\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nThe heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson was a potent symbol against white supremacy, particularly when he pummeled his “white” opponents into submission. Compelled to leave the United States because of hostile reaction to his relationship with a Euro-American woman, he wound up in revolutionary Mexico where he attempted to persuade other disgruntled African Americans to migrate south of the border. Courtesy Library of Congress.\n\nJohnson, “there were several racial disturbances in Texas as a result of this ﬁght. . . . Governor T. M. Campbell asked the legislature to bar any ﬁlms of the ﬁght, and it did so. Other legislators tried unsuccessfully to get a law passed which would bar for all time ﬁlms in which Negroes were participants.”1 As early as  U.S. Attorney General George Wickersham was informed that “special interest [had been] manifested by the President [himself] in the investigation of charges against John A. Johnson, heavyweight pugilist.”2 William Howard Taft was not generally viewed as a friend of the Negro and, in any case, was being pressured to rein in Johnson who had upset the dictates of white supremacy not only with his mating patterns but his aﬄuent lifestyle as well. Mita Jorgenjsen of Beaver Dam, Wiscon26\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nsin, addressed the president by saying, “in the name of God[,] also in the name of my country’s ﬂag . . . I want to say. . . . I cannot see why this bad man Jack Johnson who, as it stated in the Chicago papers some time ago can have any white girl in Chicago, well”—she added incongruously and without apparent irony—“that means me too.” Johnson, she sputtered, was no more than a “snake in the grass.”3 After Johnson’s predictable conviction, the authorities were quick to ascertain “whether his action violates condition of bond.”4 They suspected that Johnson might ﬂee but were conﬁdent that the “French authorities might refuse to permit [Johnson] to land for the same reasons that our immigration authorities would refuse to admit a foreigner in similar circumstances to this country.”5 Meanwhile, many Negroes were rowing in the opposite direction. George W. Harris, editor of the New York Amsterdam News, which sought to appeal to the mushrooming Negro population of Harlem, conceded that the “colored people of New York condemn the folly of ‘Jack’ Johnson.” But “they ask you to stop his persecution by federal authorities at Chicago because of his race.”6 Despite their best eﬀorts, Johnson was able to slip from the grasp of the authorities in Washington, although they did not give up. By early  the “American Consul at Cienfuegos, Cuba . . . reported by telegraph that [Johnson]” was en route.7 But at the urging of Washington, “an oﬃcial of the Cuban Legation” reported that “the Cuban government will be glad to deport this defendant as an undesirable alien.”8 For some reason, however, the Cuban authorities had diﬃculty deporting him. Perhaps it was because the magnetic Johnson was popular in Cuba, just as he was popular in Black America. He was taking on bouts and earning cash; the U.S. Consul General in Havana reported that “we have kept comparatively close watch upon Mr. Johnson and have ascertained that apparently he has no present intention of leaving Habana [sic]. He is said to have taken a home [here].”9 But if Washington’s counterparts in Havana had their way, Johnson would soon be ousted from the “Pearl of the Antilles.” Captain Cushman A. Rice of Havana, newly installed as President of the Sporting Club of Cuba, declared that if he had a choice Johnson would not ﬁght there.“Let me say for myself, as well as every man of means on the island that a bout between [Johnson and the challenger Jess Willard] will not be tolerated for a single moment.” Why? “The race question is too delicate a subject to ever allow a white man to battle with a Negro. Our interests are too valuable to allow the ﬂames of race feeling to be fanned into a riot. . . . Never 27\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nwill we tolerate mixed bouts. . . . We don’t want any civil war and that’s what it would mean if a black started to muss up a white man. It can’t be done with safety. . . . You know they [Negro Cubans] went oﬀ into the woods to run a government of their own about three years ago and we had to go out and shoot them.We don’t want that.We don’t intend to do anything that would put the idea in their heads again.”10 The island was still reeling from what was widely viewed as a “race war” a few years earlier. Were Johnson to pound on the skull of some white man it would surely disrupt “racial” harmony, thought some Cubans. Being alienated from his homeland, Johnson thought that Negroes should leave the United States for “France, glorious France” or “Latin America, the garden of the world” that “oﬀers us all the golden privileges of a land that has never known racial prejudice.” Mexico was “willing not only to give us the privileges of Mexican citizenship, but will champion our cause.” Although darker Mexicans and Latin Americans may have disagreed with his overly optimistic analysis of “race” relations in the region, lynching and other excesses, which were routine in the United States, were less prevalent in the hemisphere as a whole.That was not all. “If you want us, Mexico,” Johnson exclaimed, “we are ready to become your citizens and willing to do all that we can to make you a great power among the nations. If you want us, Latin America, we are ready to dwell among you and make you rich as we have made the southern white man rich.” With a ﬁnal ﬂourish and in ironic and ringing words he added, “in other words, the Negro is on the auction block, and the nation or community that bids the highest will receive him.”11 It was inevitable that after being deprived of citizenship rights, maltreated, lynched, and burned at the stake, some Negroes might conclude that they would be better served by allying themselves with foreign powers, even revolutionary powers like Mexico who were at odds with Washington. That Jack Johnson, one of the most celebrated and aﬄuent Negroes of his time, would so boldly and audaciously articulate Negro militance was indicative of the dilemma faced by Washington. For if the comfortably well-oﬀ Johnson thought this way, what of those less fortunate? Washington was in no mood, however, to reﬂect on the “racial” tides of history and how its own policies might have inﬂuenced Johnson’s views. Its ally in London, straining to maintain an empire comprised overwhelmingly of the “colored,” was similarly unwilling to listen to Johnson’s plea. When he was in the United Kingdom in , Whitehall “made clear to 28\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nthe Negro prizeﬁghter that if he does not leave voluntarily he probably will be deported.”Apparently “innumerable complaints [were] received by the authorities with regard to his obnoxious attention to white women.”12 The “white slave department of Scotland Yard” (tellingly) was charged with monitoring him and was said to have “received certain complaints with reference to Johnson’s conduct.”13 While Washington became embroiled in ever sharper conﬂicts with Mexico and newer “threats” such as the Soviet Union, Johnson continued to be deﬁant. One who knew the boxer reported,“I have become a friend of Jack Johnson, and can positively assert that he has sent money and written articles to aid the Negroes in their struggle in the United States. He makes collections among the Negroes and their sympathizers. . . . He tried to go to the Antilles, especially Cuba, to foment a rebellion among the Negroes.” Although he was not a “Socialist,” he “calls himself simply, defender of his race”14 (emphasis in original). Johnson was not a diﬃcult man to keep under surveillance. He stood out in a crowd, particularly when traveling in Europe. Over six feet tall and a hefty  pounds, the muscular pugilist looked as if he had been expertly sculpted out of a block of ebony. He smoked but did not drink, and carted around large amounts of cash that he spent liberally—this alone made him conspicuous at a time when most blacks were poor. When he was ﬁnally jailed in Leavenworth penitentiary in , the wallet of the forty-two-year-old Johnson contained “$,.” — more than most people in the United States earned in a single year.15 Johnson’s wealth allowed him to get his antiracist machine rolling.This was the judgment of the U.S. Military Attaché in Madrid, where Johnson had made a stop before decamping for Mexico. He was a “traitor to his country, judged by his own words,” said the attaché indignantly, without pondering whether the United States had acted as a traitor to Johnson and his people. “Two rich Mexicans at present in Madrid and who are soon going to the United States have entered into agreement with [Johnson] to send him and his wife to Mexico where a ﬁght will be arranged between him and some American. George Velcia and Gus Rhodes of Johnson’s suite have already asked for their passports. Johnson claiming he will get there without a passport.” An unnamed source was cited as declaring that on “one night in Johnson’s house,” Johnson proclaimed, “I was for Germany before and am for her yet and always will be.” Supposedly, he claimed to have intelligence about German submarines oﬀ the coast of Spain and was asked pointedly, “Johnson, you being in exile from the 29\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nUnited States with various indictments hanging over you, why didn’t you use this information to make yourself good with the United States and get these indictments lifted so you could have returned to the United States with honor?” Johnson is said to have replied, “Oh, to hell with them, I would not believe any promise they would have made me.” On the other hand, he was duly impressed with the U.S.’s adversaries. “The Germans treat me as a man and my wife as a lady.”16 The U.S. authorities were unmoved. They characterized Johnson as an unrepentant “traitor.” It was “rumored that two rich Mexicans at present in Madrid” were planning to send him to Mexico, now in the throes of revolutionary transformation, “for a ﬁght.” One informant, who was said to have penetrated Johnson’s inner circle and had spent “a week in company of the Johnson family . . . and their set,” concluded in disgust that Johnson was “surrounded by a set of cheap admirers and parasites. . . .They are all hand-in-glove with the German element.”17 Thus, as the United States entered World War I in , months after the Bolshevik Revolution and as Mexican unrest continued, the authorities were inclined to take Johnson’s challenge quite seriously. When he wrote from the Palace Hotel in Madrid to Arturo Craven in Mexico City, U.S. spies were quick to monitor his every word, as he was on a special “list.” “Writer conﬁrms his [cable] to addressee as follows, ‘send me ﬁve thousand pesetas in advance and also transportation ﬁrst class for three persons.’”The “addressee wishes writer to go to Mexico so that several bouts can be arranged there, and writer [Johnson] seems very anxious to go.”18 It is striking that Johnson remained so upbeat about Mexico, for certainly his relationship with this nation was not free of tension. No doubt, this was evidence of his even more conﬂicted ties with his homeland. Later he recalled a “proposed ﬁght” in the border town of Juarez, that was said to be “ﬁnanced by Pancho Villa, the bandit leader.”The then leader of Mexico, Carranza “declared that if [Johnson] attempted to land at Veracruz he would make me a prisoner and turn me over to the United States.” That was one reason he wound up ﬁghting Jess Willard in Havana, overriding similarly stern local objection. In an oblique reference to the rumor that Washington would smile more kindly upon Johnson if he were to lose to Willard, the latest in a long line of “great white hopes,” Johnson observed, “Those who chafed under the disappointment of having a man of my race hold the championship, I was told, would be molliﬁed” if he lost the ﬁght—which he promptly did. But when Washington’s antagonism toward him did not diminish, Johnson’s anger probably grew.19 30\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nJohnson arrived in Mexico in , a fateful year of “race riots” in the United States and Bolshevik consolidation in Russia. The United States had accused Mexico of collaborating with its most recent antagonist, Germany, during World War I. Mexico City had become a “headquarters for a swarm of international drunks, spies, broken-down newspapermen, fences for stolen jewelry and paintings, and propagandists for all brands of politics.”20 The Chicago Defender, which appealed to a growing Negro population in this midwestern metropolis, did not share this opinion. There it was reported that Johnson had arrived in Mexico City “several days ago from Cuba and has become the idol of the citizens of this great city and the leading people, high military dignitaries and big political leaders are his constant companions. He was brought here by a syndicate of Mexicans under a contract for a year to stage bull matches in the bull ring which has a seating capacity of ,. . . . His wife is with him and they are living in a home of the sort that one might ﬁnd in the  block on Lake Shore Drive,” a particularly posh section of Chicago. In contrast to the bad publicity his marriage had received in the United States, in Mexico “already Mrs. Johnson’s social secretary has been kept busy answering invitations for the Johnsons to accept dinner parties and theatrical engagements.”21 The Johnsons were not just social butterﬂies. Johnson quickly formed a “land co.” and proclaimed,“Brazil may have its opportunities, but there are far better ones in this city,” referring to Mexico City. “I believe this to be the best place in the world for our people. . . . The expense of coming here, especially from the southern states, is considerably less than going to South American countries.”22 Johnson rapidly became a ﬁxture in the landscape of Mexico City. Soon plans were revealed for him to become a “movie star,” assuming “the role of Pedro Cronolio, a Mexican adventurer. A beautiful love story features [in] the plot; old days on the Mexican border, lust for gold and the sudden rise to the highest position of human attainment in the Mexican government.”23 Johnson’s antagonists too had taken to the silver screen to counter his magnetic appeal. At least two movies had been made about him, both revealing their hatred of him.24 African Americans, under cinematic assault from Birth of a Nation and similarly odious ﬁlms, could only shake their heads in amazement. As for Johnson, he did not shrink from associating with other U.S. radicals in exile. As he was arriving in Mexico, so were other North American 31\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\ndissidents. The lengthening list included the nascent communist, Mike Gold, who had crossed the border, like so many others, to escape the draft. “At one point collecting money in the streets of Mexico City for a Spanish translation of the Soviet Constitution, he encountered the African American boxer Jack Johnson, with whom he was acquainted.” After they had exchanged small talk, the benevolent Johnson bestowed a $ contribution upon him for this radical cause.25 There was a de facto alliance between Johnson and the budding communists in his midst. They publicized his dissidence. As the exile, Charles Shipman recalled, “The stolid black giant was a popular hero in Mexico. When he fought an Argentinian [sic] in the Mexico City bullring, Mike [Gold] and I were there. In fact we went there with him on the runningboard of his car.” “On the way home from the ﬁght Mike prodded him, ‘Say Jack, you got something against the Bolsheviki?’”26 This Johnson denied. Such incidents conﬁrmed many people north of the border in their opinion that Johnson had gone over completely to the cause of radicalism and was bent on using Mexico as a beachhead of subversion against his native land. Johnson “took the lead in a hard-drinking circle of military men and Cientiﬁcos or mining millionaires, who lived in baroque mansions and breakfasted every day promptly at seven. . . .The railway magnate Paulino Fontes was a member of this set and he took Johnson out to call on President Carranza in the palace at Chapultapec.”That Johnson’s ardent rhetoric could be backed up by muscular action was the worry of Washington. One State Department oﬃcial nervously asserted that “Jack Johnson, of pugilistic fame, has been spreading social equality propaganda among the Negroes in Mexico and has been endeavouring [sic] to incite colored element in this country.” That he was now a “friend” of Carranza, who no longer worried about Johnson’s past ties to Pancho Villa and his assault on the central government in light of the latter’s strength, meant that Johnson could hardly be ignored.27 Had Johnson been a solitary Negro ﬁghting the depredations of Jim Crow by himself, the threat he posed would have been minor. But as a writer to the NAACP journal put it in , corresponding from Torreon in Mexico’s interior, “The Jews and the Irish and many, many others had to leave home to solve their economic and race questions” and “[here] a real man can be a real man. There is, as you know, no prejudice [here].” Move to Mexico, he urged. His only complaint related to Euro-Americans who when “they come here use every opportunity to give us a black 32\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\neye.”28 Obviously, they would have to be dealt with at the appropriate moment. The Bureau of Investigation was fully apprised of this migration and the impassioned rhetoric it inspired. An October  report stated that “many Negroes are going into Mexico. Twenty were counted at the theatre in Mexico City one night. They are publicly in favor of riots in the United States and are conferring with many Carrancista generals . . . with a view, supposedly, of assisting the Carrancistas in case of trouble with the United States.” Johnson “gave a boxing exhibition in Nuevo Laredo,” along the border, “a short time ago and something like  Negroes from the United States . . . conferred” privately with him.“It is suspicioned [sic] by well posted Americans that this meeting was had in Nuevo Laredo for the purpose of giving Johnson a chance to have an understanding with his visitors and to further Carranza propaganda in the United States. At this time, there are three Negro musicians and a small well educated yellow Negro in Nuevo Laredo and several Americans have informed me that they have seen him in close consultation with the Carrancistas there. It is rumored that Johnson has a commission under the Carranza government.” What was to be done in response? The Bureau deemed “advisable to have an investigation in Mexico City of Jack Johnson’s activities in order to determine to what extent he is endeavoring to incite the Negroes of this country.” Closer investigation of the Negro musicians who were ﬂocking to the border in search of greater opportunity was also advised.Among these were Louis Markham and Jerry Smith of San Antonio, and James Kelley of New Iberia, Louisiana. The ﬁrst two may have been inﬂuenced by the “moving pictures” that “have been exhibited in San Antonio recently showing Jack Johnson in dress suit and stating he is a member of the best clubs in Mexico City.”29 Johnson later confessed that in Mexico, “I made many friends among whom was Carranza,” who “made every eﬀort to make my stay in the Mexican Republic a pleasant and comfortable one.” Washington knew that Carranza was not above deploying coercive diplomacy against the United States and the U.S. embassy in Mexico City could not have been happy with Johnson’s admission that “frequently” he and Carranza “met each other in private.”Their mutual grievances against Washington would no doubt have been a topic of conversation.30 The busy leader showed his aﬀection and concern for the famed ﬁghter by “going as far to provide me with escorts of soldiers when I had occasion to travel in sections of the country infested by bandits or 33\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nrevolutionists.” Carranza, he said admiringly, was a “man of broad views. . . . He was greatly interested in world politics and in the future relations between his country and the United States.” Unlike many exiles, Johnson did not limit himself to the modern and comfortable capital city but traveled around the nation frequently. True to his word, he did take “part in some of the bull-ﬁghting exhibitions which were being frequently held in Mexico City and vicinity.” He “had been urged by the governor of Lower California to visit that section”—and he promptly did. “It was necessary for us to travel in a round about way, our course traveling through Guadalajara and Sonora, two Mexican states in which bandits, as well as Indian tribes, were indulging in depredations. . . . [On trains] passengers were robbed and many were slain.” Johnson himself was stopped by a “horde of savage [sic] Yaqui Indians” in Sonora. “I began talking to them, having gained suﬃcient knowledge of the Mexican vernacular. . . .When I told them who I was, they were suﬃciently interested to halt their looting.” Eventually, Johnson became so fond of the Mexican hinterlands that he “opened a café” in “Tia Juana.”31 There were tens of thousands of U.S. citizens in Mexico, though few of them seemed to be as close to the leadership as Johnson. Most had the kind of Jim Crow attitudes that had driven Johnson into exile in the ﬁrst place. So what would happen when white supremacy of the old sort confronted those no longer willing to submit to its dictates? An incident involving Johnson hinted at an answer. He and a group of friends went to eat at Sanborn’s original drugstore and restaurant in Mexico City, now a chain and still in business today.Walter Sanborn, the U.S. owner,“drew the color line and refused to serve Johnson. [Johnson] left but returned a few hours later with three or four of Carranza’s generals.They drew their pistols and demanded that Sanborn apologize. Mexico, they informed him was not ‘white man’s country.’ Sanborn was forced to shake hands, embrace and ﬁnally serve Johnson.”32 The Chicago Defender reported this story with immense joy. Sanborn “has had his license revoked by the city authorities” after telling Johnson and his entourage that “he did not serve ‘colored people.’” Johnson, the Defender said proudly, is “regarded as an important factor both in the business and political life here. He is the promoter of one of the largest land corporations in Mexico. Through this concern hundreds of men from the southern states are settling here.”33 Earlier it had been reported that D. H. Moore of the Chamber of Commerce in Jim Crow New Orleans entered a Mexico City restaurant, looked around, and said with disgust, “No [expletive deleted] could eat 34\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nwith white people. . . . Jack overheard the remarks and without further preliminary landed an uppercut on his chin. No arrests were made, as the champion was in a country where the color of a man’s skin is no bar to him receiving justice. . . . In Mexico no man can insult another on account of his race, creed or color and get away with it.”34 To many Negroes Johnson was an unapologetic “racial” avenger, correcting insulting slights that had to be silently tolerated on pain of being lynched north of the border. On the other hand, those who supported white supremacist values were outraged by Johnson’s behavior.The conservative oilman William F. Buckley, Sr., took note of the words of a U.S. Senate aide who declared that “Walter Sanborn of Mexico City was very badly treated by General Merrigo and General de la Torre and forced him to wait on Jack Johnson.” This conﬁrmed for him the fact that “Johnson stands very high with the Carranza government and [there] are more Negroes now in Mexico City than ever before. Americans from there are of the opinion that the Carranza government are carrying out through Johnson quite a propaganda in the United States. Some time ago Johnson gave an exhibition in Nuevo Laredo and had about twenty Negroes from diﬀerent portions of the United States to meet him there.”35 Nervously, Buckley contemplated the possibility that Johnson was forming a revolutionary base in the borderlands for anti-Washington activities. With his ambitious land company and his image as a tough lone opponent of white supremacy, Johnson’s popularity was soaring among Negroes—just as he was being viliﬁed by antagonists. A spy who had inﬁltrated the Socialist Party in Mexico told his paymasters in Washington that “Johnson wished to spread race propaganda and he was interested in socialist ideology.” In a speech “given before a cheering crowd in front of the Vega Hotel in Nuevo Laredo, Johnson said that when and if the gringos invaded Mexico, American blacks would stand alongside their Mexican brothers.”36 In Nuevo Laredo, cheek by jowl with Texas, the feisty ﬁghter was “accompanied by General Juan Perez and Manuel Mijares, who are supporting him with funds, as he entertains them by exhibition bouts, punching the bag, and above all telling them how much better they are oﬀ than the [expletive deleted] American Gringoes, and that the colored race are going to show them that when, or if the time ever comes when the Americans will attempt to come over there, the black man is your friend, and are with you, and will stand by you.” Hoots of delight reportedly greeted this assertion and as he departed for a nearby saloon “where he is a drawing card,” he was “followed there by [a] crowd in 35\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\ncheers.” Johnson was slated to ﬁght one “Porky Flynn” there but after the latter “objected” to ﬁghting a Negro—or objected to the idea of being pulverized by one—the bout was canceled.37 The United States worried that Johnson would spread his insurgent message into places that theretofore had been silenced by Jim Crow. It was particularly worried about Johnson’s visit to Panama, site of the strategically sensitive canal. A. L. Flint reported with evident anxiety in a “conﬁdential” missive that Johnson “may come to the Isthmus in the near future from Mexico.”38 Similar concerns arose closer to home. “Over the entire south,” stated one intelligence report, “particularly Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas there are spread secret societies of Negroes for the purpose of aggressive action against the whites,” “perhaps ” in Houston alone. “The returned Negro soldiers” inspired by Johnson “are fostering this society and arms in great numbers are being procured. . . . In the recent riot at Longview [Texas] . . . everyone was greatly surprised to see Negroes coming out of the cane brakes with - caliber riﬂes and as much as  rounds of ammunition. . . . In the county in which Longview is situated, approximately  ﬁrearms were taken. . . .The Houston riot of a few years ago,” when Negro soldiers fatally wounded a number of whites, “was one of the ﬁrst results of this Negro society.” Subduing the Negroes would not be easy, as “much diﬃculty will be encountered in obtaining Negro informants, as in the present situation none could be trusted.” It was no coincidence that this ferment was erupting in the regions closest to Mexico. “Eﬀorts are thought to be under way by the Carrancista government to get Negroes into Mexico in order that they may assist the army, many of them having already been trained in our own service.”39 In fact, thought U.S. intelligence, Johnson himself was not only “publicly in favor of race riots in [the] U.S.,” but was also one of the key “promoters of the Carranza propaganda in the U.S.,” propaganda that included “eﬀorts under way to get Negroes into the Mexican army.”40 Johnson had become a ﬁxture in Nuevo Laredo, his presence across the border from Texas presenting a continuing challenge to Washington; there he was accompanied by “Gen. Juan Perez and Manuel Mijaes who are supporting him with funds.” He was also “fermenting racial feeling with blacks & Mexicans against whites.”41 This campaign could simultaneously strip the United States of one of its prime ﬁghting forces—Negro troopers—and augment those of Mexico.\n\n36\n\nA Tale of Two Negroes\n\nThe U.S. authorities were outraged at Johnson’s behavior. He had committed two major transgressions for a black man—consorting with EuroAmerican women and allying with foreign powers. He was a “notorious cur,” said an indignant citizen who was pressing the U.S. government to restrain Johnson. What about the “indictment . . . for white slavery under the Mann Act in the case of one Lucille Cameron. . . . Is it not possible to get him back into the States and give him the dose he so justly "
