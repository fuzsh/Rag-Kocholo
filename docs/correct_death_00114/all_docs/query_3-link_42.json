        "text": "Tonight's Jazz Feature is by a fine pianist who always seemed to have a bit of an undeserved low profile. His name is Jack Wilson and he was born in Chicago on August 3, 1936 and passed away at age 71 on October 5, 2007. He was a favorite of some great singers like Nancy Wilson and Dinah Washington and was sought after for his musicality and fine touch. Wilson performed in Chicago with all the great players from the Windy City then moved for a few years to New York and recorded several good albums for Atlantic Records then out to Los Angeles where he kept busy in the movie and TV studios and played a lot of Jazz too. He got a contract to record for Blue Note Records and did 3 albums for them and tonight's Jazz feature is his best of the 3. \"Easterly Winds\" displays Wilson's playing and his composing abilities and this band selected by Wilson sounds like a working band even though they were only assembled for this album. The people involved aside from Jack Wilson are Lee Morgan on trumpet, Jackie McLean on alto saxophone, Garnett brown on trombone, Bob Cranshaw on bass and the great Billy Higgins on drums. Wilson wrote 4 of the 6 tunes on the date and does the ballad \"A Time for Love\" as a trio and brings in a tune by saxophonist Frank Strozier called \"Frank's Tune\". \"Easterly Winds\" is an overlooked latter day classic and it tonight's Jazz Feature. Check it out!.\n\nTonight's Jazz Feature is a belated Birthday tribute to a sadly neglected Jazz giant and innovator. St.Elmo Sy;vester Hope was born in New York on June 27,1923 and died in that city at age 43 on May 19,1967 from a bout with pneumonia. Elmo grew up with his close friends Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell but somehow the honors that were given to Monk and Powell eluded Elmo Hope. His unique piano style reflected the influences of Monk and Powell but were very much his own. His recordings as a sideman and leader are rather sparse but tonight's Jazz Feature presents a session that is one of the best examples of Elmo's style and compositions. Elmo had just returned to New York after some very lean years in Los Angeles and recorded these pieces for a small obscure label and sadly they got poor distribution. They have been resurrected and show Mr. Hope in the best light with people he respected and who enhanced his music. Elmo is accompanied by bassist Paul Chambers and drum master Philly Joe Jones and he delivers 9 of his fine creations. Happy Birthday Anniversary Elmo Hope! Enjoy his music tonight!\n\nTonight's Jazz Feature is a tribute through music to Canada Day, today July 1,2024. The great Canadian born pianist/composer and Jazz Master Oscar Emmanual Peterson was born in Montreal on August 15,1925 and passed away at his home in Mississauga, Ontario on December 23,2007 after a long career and receiving just about every honor Canada could bestow on this artist. The Jazz Show is proud to present \"The Canadiana Suite\" an 8 movement suite composed in honor of the country of his birth and performed by his long standing Trio with the incomparable Ray Brown on bass and Ed Thigpen on drums and of course Oscar Peterson on piano.. It was recorded for Limelight Records (a Jazz division of Mercury Records) in New York on September 9,1964. Happy Canada Day to all!\n\nTonight's Jazz Feature spotlights the late and deeply missed vibraphonist/marimbaist Bobby Hutcherson. This group was led by Hutcherson after the breakup of the ground breaking Bobby Hutcherson/ Harold Land Quintet. Bobby continued his innovative ways and formed this band of mainly San Francisco based players. Their sound was more airy and floating and lighter but no less compelling. Bobby brought in some of the positive aspects of \"fusion Jazz\" that prevailed in the early 70's but kept the tradition of Jazz happening. He also divided his time between the vibraphone (it has metal bars) and the marimba (it has wooden bars). which delivered an interesting contrast. Tenor and soprano saxophonist Manny Boyd added to the great sound of this band. George Cables is on electric and acoustic piano, James Leary 111 is on bass and contributes the bulk of the compositions here,. On drums is the great Eddie Marshall and Kenneth Nash on percussion. This fine album delivers a variety of great moods. The album was recorded in San Francisco in February of 1976. It was issued on Blue Note Records and called \"Waiting\". It was definitely worth waiting for....so enjoy it tonight;.\n\nTonight's Jazz Feature is unique even in the varied discography of Charles Mingus. First of all Mingus plays only piano here and chants, sings and delivers verbal encouragement to the soloists. Also the band is built around the amazing talents of Roland Kirk (aka Rahsaan Roland Kirk) who plays his tenor saxophone, manzello (a type of soprano saxophone), his stritch (an elongated alto saxophone), flute and various percussion and sundry instruments like whistles, gongs etc. In the band too is tenor saxophonist Booker Ervin and trombone great Jimmy Knepper, both Mingus favorites. On bass is Doug Watkins and on drums is of course, Dannie Richmond. The music is loose, free and covers all the emotions from humor to anger and is sometimes surrealistic. This band was formed in the Summer of 1961 and marked a switch in style for Mingus but was still reflective of his immense musical personality. This album was recorded for Atlantic Records on November 6, 1961 and issued as \"Oh Yeah!\". It stands alone and is tonight's Jazz Feature.\n\nTonight's Jazz Feature is an important album recorded in one of the golden years of Jazz: 1959 but rarely mentioned. This album marked the first issued album under a new Blue Note contract by alto saxophone giant, Jackie McLean. Jackie was starting a new phase in career and this album marks the first step and it's a big step. Jackie emerges here from his early influences namely Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins. Jackie also has one of the most distinctive sounds that's sometimes raw and harsh but always soulful and full of feeling. On this fine album McLean is featured with a frequent partner, trumpeter Donald Byrd. On piano is the fine Walter Davis Jr. who also composed four of the six tunes on the date. Paul Chambers is on bass and the drums are played by the innovative Pete LaRoca (aka Peter Sims).. All in all \"New Soil\" deserves recognition as another of the seminal recordings of 1959. Enjoy!"
