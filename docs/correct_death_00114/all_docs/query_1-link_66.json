One of the most significant events that marked the progressive and increasing normalization of its use in the city was precisely the appearance of indigenous workshops dedicated to the piano-makings. Those first craftsmen who, in some cases âlike for example, Pedro GÃ³mezâ, knew the ins and outs of the construction of the novel pianistic mechanics out of the country, opened their workshops in the decade of 1830 putting with it on record that already at that time started a local demand of instruments that justified sufficiently its work. It has been obtained information of four factories that worked between 1830 and the beginning of the 20th century. This said documentation states that the Valencian instruments made during that period (1830â1915 as much obtained great success in the internal market as in the outsider, and obtained prestigious awards in exhibitions and national and foreign displays. Also has provided with the knowledge of the production and marketing systems of those workshops, and of the characteristics that had the Valencian pianos made at the diverse times; that information has helped to value the economic and social function that had the Valencian manufacture of pianos in the 19th century and has allowed its comparison with the developed one in other Spanish provinces during the same time.\n\nHacia 1830 comenzÃ³ a generalizarse el uso del piano en Valencia. Uno de los hechos mÃ¡s significativos que marcaron la progresiva y creciente normalizaciÃ³n de su utilizaciÃ³n en la ciudad fue precisamente la apariciÃ³n de talleres autÃ³ctonos dedicados a la fabricaciÃ³n de pianos. Esos primeros artesanos que, en algunos casos âcomo por ejemplo, Pedro GÃ³mezâ, conocieron los entresijos de la construcciÃ³n de la novedosa mecÃ¡nica pianÃ­stica fuera del paÃ­s, abrieron sus talleres en la dÃ©cada de 1830 dejando constancia con ello de que ya se iniciaba por\n\nPrimo report sullâattivitÃ entomologica in Italia nell'ambito del piano nazionale per la sorveglianza della West Nile disease\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Goffredo\n\n2008-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Il virus West Nile (WNV, neuropatogeno per uccelli, cavalli e uomo, Ã¨ mantenuto in natura da un ciclo primario di trasmissione tra uccelli e zanzare, in particolare quelle del genere Culex; il cavallo e lâuomo sono considerati ospiti a fondo cieco. Un focolaio circoscritto di encefalomielite equina da WNV verificatosi in Italia nel 1998 ed unâepidemia scoppiata in Francia nei pressi del confine italiano, hanno indotto il Governo Italiano ad attuare un piano di sorveglianza allo scopo di valutare il rischio di reintroduzione del virus. Il piano ha previsto la sorveglianza entomologica in 15 aree di studio considerate âa rischioâ di introduzione del WNV in Italia. Lâindagine entomologica, nel periodo compreso tra il 2003 e il 2007, ha visto come risultato la cattura di 28.798 zanzare, 14.765 adulte e 14.033 larve, appartenenti a 22 specie. In conformitÃ con i dati riportati in letteratura, otto tra le specie identificate sono state trovate naturalmente infette con WNV o infettate con successo in laboratorio in alcuni paesi dellâEuropa e degli Stati Uniti dâAmerica: Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1897 (=Stegomiya albopicta, Aedes vexans (Meigen, 1830, Anopheles maculipennis (Meigen, 1818, Coquillettidia richiardii (Ficalbi, 1889, Culex modestus (Ficalbi, 1889, Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758, Culex theileri (Theobald, 1903 e Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas, 1771 (=Aedes caspius.\n\nEuropean Piano Schools : Russian , German and French classical piano interpretation and technique\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSofia LourenÃ§o\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The goal of this research is to characterize representative performances by famous pianists in order to determine main influential trends in performance, derived specifically from traditional piano practices referred to as National Piano Schools. Previous research (LourenÃ§o, 2005, 2007 has shown strong musical correlation of particular characteristics, namely the aesthetic, the technical, the historic and the repertoire. The concept of piano interpretation school is a useful concept for analyzing the universe of piano performance. Piano pedagogy literature of each European National Piano School has been analyzed together with an empirical audio analysis of recordings through a check-list survey. Overall the main National Piano Schools consist of three essential branches: the Russian school; the German school; the French school. The identification of National Piano Schools provides a powerful framework of study and an awareness of Europe's elusive music heritage and it main influences. Furthermore, as pianists use their whole body to enhance their communication of the music's spiritual, emotional and dramatic essence, this study also aims to contribute into research on performance practice.\n\nEl piano de la mÃºsica de salÃ³n.

A similar question can be asked of virtually all musical instruments. A particular note-such as middle C-can be produced by a piano, a violin, a clarinet, and many other instruments, yet it is easy for even a musically untrained listener to distinguish between these different instruments. A central quest in the study of musical instruments is to understand why the sound of the \"\"same\"\" note depends greatly on the instrument, and to elucidate whichaspects of an instrument are most critical in producing the musical tones characteristic of the instrument.

Matching tones are created when a pedestrian steps on a particular stripe or key. A digital camera is directed at the crossing from above. A special computer vision application was developed, which maps the stripes of the pedestrian crossing to piano keys and detects by means of an image over which key the center of gravity of each pedestrian is placed at any given moment. Black stripes represent the black piano keys. The application consists of two parts: (1Â initialization, where the model of the abstract piano keyboard is mapped to the image of the pedestrian crossing, and (2 the detection of pedestrians at the crossing, so that musical tones can be generated according to their locations.

In this study we developed a music playing robot (which can also work as a service robot for public performance. The research is mainly focused on the mechanical and electrical control of piano-playing robot, the exploration of correlations among music theory, rhythm and piano keys, and eventually the research on playing skill of keyboard instrument. The piano-playing robot is capable of control linear motor, servo-motor and pneumatic devices in accordance with the notes and rhythm in order to drive the mechanical structure to proper positions for pressing the keys and generating music. The devices used for this robot are mainly crucial components produced by HIWIN Technology Corp. The design of robotic hand is based on the direction of anthropomorphic hand such that five fingers will be used for playing piano. The finger actuations include actions of finger rotation, finger pressing, and finger lifting; time required for these 3 stages must meet the requirement of rhythm. The purpose of entertainment robot can be achieved by playing electric piano with robotic hand, and we hope this research can contribute to the development of domestic entertainment music playing robots.\n\nMedtner.

The sampled objects belong to different classes, there are for instance weapons of offence and defence, such as swords and greaves, small decorative objects for personal use, such as rings, fibulae, belt hooks, belt decorations, and small tools, such as the knives used by women, reels, needles and razors, but also small functional parts, such as rivets and nails, repairs and even a kind of musical instrument, such as the tintinnabula. The methods employed were AAS and SEM, where possible, and XRF in all cases. The aim of the research was that of evaluating the skill of the local artisans, of determining the most common copper-based alloys in use in Sicily in this period and comparing the data with the analysis results of contemporary groups of finds from other areas of the Italian peninsula and from other European regions.\n\nEl artÃ­culo presenta el resultado de los anÃ¡lisis realizados a los metales de base cobre de la importante necrÃ³polis siciliana de Madonna del Piano, prÃ³xima a Grammichele (Catania, fechada entre el Bronce Final 2 y la Primera Edad del Hierro IA.

LâÃ©tude de ces deux dÃ©marches dâinterprÃ¨tes conduit Ã une conclusion croisÃ©eÂ : lâabstraction gouldienne nâest rien dâautre quâun dÃ©placement du jeu vers dâautres instruments (ceux qui servent Ã la prise de son et au montage de ses enregistrementsÂ ; le Â«Â faire-corpsÂ Â» hÃ©ritÃ© de la culture pianistique romantique est plus dialectique que fusionnel, et en cela implique une capacitÃ© de mise Ã distance. A partir de cette double conclusion, on tÃ¢che enfin de repenser la place du jeu Ã lâinstrument dans la mise en Åuvre dâune interprÃ©tation, en interrogeant le dialogue qui sâinstaure entre la partition telle quâelle sâÃ©crit et le geste tel quâil se joue.Our study leans on an opposition between two pianists' attitudes about their work with the instrument. Gould claims a necessary separation from the keyboard in order to prioritize reading. Arrau, on the contrary, relies on a technique which consists in âbeing oneâ with his piano. The analysis of these two interpretsâ behaviours leads to a crossed conclusion: the gouldian abstraction is nothing else than a displacement of the playing towards another kind of instruments, the ones he uses in sound recording and cut up; Arrauâs âbeing oneâ is more dialectic than at first sight, and it therefore implies a real distancing from the piano. This constatation leads to rethink the place of the piano playing in the setting of an interpretation, and to highlight the real dialogue which develops itself between the score as it has been written and the gesture as it is played.\n\nDesign of Piano -playing Robotic Hand\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLin Jen-Chang; Hsin-Cheng Li; Kuo-Cheng Huang; Shu-Wei Lin\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUnlike the market slowdown of industrial robots, service & entertainment robots have been highly regarded by most robotics reseach and market research agencies.

We studied the changes in integrated electromyographic activity, using the abductor pollicis brevis functioning as an agonist during the teaching of identical selective movements of piano playing in two groups, one with EMG biofeedback and the other following traditional method of instruction. The analysis of variance revealed an increase in the peak amplitude and the relaxation rate values for the biofeedback group. These results have implications for the application of piano playing techniques and reveal EMG biofeedback as an aid in the teaching of thumb attack with the abductor pollicis brevis as agonist.\n\nImproving Students' Intrinsic Motivation in Piano Learning: Expert Teacher Voices\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCheng, Zijia; Southcott, Jane\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMany students learn to play the piano but some lack the motivation to continue learning.

The proposed system makes use of the novel idea of modeling a segment of music as a third generation mobile communications signal, specifically, as a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access signal. The proposed model considers each piano note as a CDMA user in which the spreading code is replaced by a representative note pattern. The lack of orthogonality between the note patterns will make necessary to design a specific thresholding matrix to decide whether the PIC outputs correspond to the actual notes composing the chord or not. An additional stage that performs an octave test and a fifth test has been included that improves the error rate in the detection of these intervals that are specially difficult to detect. The proposed system attains very good results in both the detection of the notes that compose a chord and the estimation of the polyphony number.\n\nPerceptions of Challenge: The Role of Catastrophe Theory in Piano Learning\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBugos, Jennifer; Lee, William\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the perceptions of private piano instructors on the role of challenge in teaching and learning the piano and to examine the potential application of catastrophe theory in understanding the role and outcomes of such challenges.

The filter design is based on the analysis of the pulses generated by the hammer blow and propagating along the string. In the five lowest octaves, the hammer force is reconstructed by considering two waves only: the incoming wave from the hammer and its first reflection at the front end. For the higher notes, four- or eight-wave schemes must be considered. The theory is validated on simulated string velocities by comparing imposed and reconstructed forces. The simulations are based on a nonlinear damped stiff string model previously developed by Chabassier, Chaigne, and Joly [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 134(1), 648-665 (2013)]. The influence of absorption, dispersion, and amplitude of the string waves on the quality of the reconstruction is discussed. Finally, the method is applied to real piano strings. The measured string velocity is compared to the simulated velocity excited by the reconstructed force, showing a high degree of accuracy. A number of simulations are compared to simulated strings excited by a force derived from measurements of mass and acceleration of the hammer head. One application to an historic piano is also presented.\n\nPiano training in youths with hand motor impairments after damage to the developing brain\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLampe, RenÃ©e; Thienel, Anna; Mitternacht, JÃ¼rgen; Blumenstein, Tobias; Turova, Varvara; Alves-Pinto, Ana\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDamage to the developing brain may lead to impairment of the hand motor function and negatively impact on patientsâ quality of life. Development of manual dexterity and finger and hand motor function may be promoted by learning to play the piano. The latter brings together music with the intensive training of hand coordination and fine finger mobility. We investigated if learning to play the piano helped to improve hand motor skills in 18 youths with hand motor disorders resulting from damage during early brain development. Participants trained 35â40 minutes twice a week for 18 months with a professional piano teacher. With the use of a Musical Instrument Digital Interface piano, the uniformity of finger strokes could be objectively assessed from the timing of keystrokes. The analysis showed a significant improvement in the uniformity of keystrokes during the training. Furthermore, the youths showed strong motivation and engagement during the study. This is nevertheless an open study, and further studies remain needed to exclude effects of growth and concomitant therapies on the improvements observed and clarify which patients will more likely benefit from learning to play the piano.

We aimed to study the short-term effects of keyboard training in music-naive subjects on the motor/premotor cortex activity and interhemispheric interactions, using electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS. Twelve subjects (experimental group underwent, before and after a two week-piano training: (1 hand-motor function tests: Jamar, grip and nine-hole peg tests; (2 electroencephalography, evaluating the mu rhythm task-related desynchronization (TRD during keyboard performance; and (3 TMS, targeting bilateral abductor pollicis brevis (APB and abductor digiti minimi (ADM, to obtain duration and area of ipsilateral silent period (ISP during simultaneous tonic contraction of APB and ADM. Data were compared with 13 controls who underwent twice these measurements, in a two-week interval, without undergoing piano training. Every subject in the experimental group improved keyboard performance and left-hand nine-hole peg test scores. Pre-training, ISP durations were asymmetrical, left being longer than right. Post-training, right ISPAPB increased, leading to symmetrical ISPAPB. Mu TRD during motor performance became more focal and had a lesser amplitude than in pre-training, due to decreased activity over ventral premotor cortices. No such changes were evidenced in controls. We demonstrated that a 10-day piano-training was associated with balanced interhemispheric interactions both at rest and during motor activation. Piano training, in a short timeframe, may reshape local and inter-hemispheric motor cortical circuits.\n\nAn Investigation of Music Teacher Candidates' Performance Anxiety Levels in Piano Examinations\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKiliÃ§, Deniz Beste Ãevik\n\n2018-01-01\n\nExamination anxiety in piano education, one of the important courses in music education, can negatively affect both success in examinations and the education of students.

An experimental setup consisting of accelerometers and a calibrated microphone was used to capture key and hammer movements, as well as the acoustic signal. Five selected keys were played by pianists with two types of touch (``staccato'' and ``legato''). Timing and dynamic differences between the original performance, the corresponding MIDI file recorded by the computer-controlled pianos, and its reproduction were analyzed. The two devices performed quite differently with respect to timing and dynamic accuracy. The Disklavier's onset capturing was slightly more precise (+/-10 ms) than its reproduction (-20 to +30 ms); the BÃ¶sendorfer performed generally better, but its timing accuracy was slightly less precise for recording (-10 to 3 ms) than for reproduction (+/-2 ms). Both devices exhibited a systematic (linear) error in recording over time. In the dynamic dimension, the BÃ¶sendorfer showed higher consistency over the whole dynamic range, while the Disklavier performed well only in a wide middle range. Neither device was able to capture or reproduce different types of touch.\n\nTipos de memoria, aptitudes y estrategias en el proceso de memorizaciÃ³n de estudiantes de piano\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarta Cuartero\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This research analyzes different memory types -muscular, visual, auditive..- and the strategies followed by a group of 10 piano students from the first year of âConservatorio Profesionalâ (5th year of studies when memorizing an unfamiliar score depending on three conditions: in the first one the students may use the piano (physical practice; in the second one they may not use the piano (mental practice with listening but have an audio recording of the score, and in the third one, they have no piano and no recording (mental practice without listening. The memorization phase (30â, the performance by heart of the score (1â-2â and a short interview of the student are video-recorded to evaluate the performance and the memorizing processes. The outcome of the performance is analyzed as a function of the students preexisting skills (piano and musical language, of the behavior and attitude variables and of the memorization phase processes. The results show that the performance quality depends significantly on the access to the piano during the memorization (p<0.01 and, to a lesser extent, to the audio recording. This shows the importance of muscular and also auditory memory, corroborating the results in the literature. The preexisting skills of the participants, in particular note-reading skills (p<0.01 and piano technique (p<0.05 influence the performance quality, while the different memorizing strategies used have no significant correlation with the performance or the skills, contrarily to our expectations.

Relatively little evidence exists on whether motor skill retention benefits from distributed practice, with even less evidence on complex motor skills. We taught a 17-note musical sequence on a piano to individuals without prior formal training. There were five lags between learning episodes: 0-, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min. After a 5-min retention interval, participants' performance was measured using three criteria: accuracy of note playing, consistency in pressure applied to the keys, and consistency in timing. No spacing effect was found, suggesting that the effect may not always be demonstrable for complex motor skills or non-verbal abilities (timing and motor skills. Additionally, we taught short phrases from five songs, using the same set of lags and retention interval, and did not find any spacing effect for accuracy of song reproduction.

The resulting curves of development of complexity represented by the fractal dimension showed up a very reasonable correlation with the perceptional density of events during these pieces. The seventh piece of Ligeti's ``Musica ricercata'' was used as a test case. Here, each new part of the piece was followed by an increase of the fractal dimension because of the increase of information at the part changes. The second piece ``Galamb borong,'' number seven of the piano Etudes was used, because Ligeti wrote these Etudes after studying fractal geometry. Although the piece is not fractal in the strict mathematical sense, the overall structure of the psychoacoustic event-density as well as the detailed event development is represented by the fractal dimension plot.\n\nThe development of the idiomatic piano language through Clementiâs edition of D.

Six months of piano training improved behavioral auditory word discrimination in general as well as word discrimination based on vowels compared with the controls. The reading group yielded similar trends. However, the piano group demonstrated unique advantages over the reading and control groups in consonant-based word discrimination and in enhanced positive mismatch responses (pMMRs) to lexical tone and musical pitch changes. The improved word discrimination based on consonants correlated with the enhancements in musical pitch pMMRs among the children in the piano group. In contrast, all three groups improved equally on general cognitive measures, including tests of IQ, working memory, and attention. The results suggest strengthened common sound processing across domains as an important mechanism underlying the benefits of musical training on language processing. In addition, although we failed to find far-transfer effects of musical training to general cognition, the near-transfer effects to speech perception establish the potential for musical training to help children improve their language skills. Piano training was not inferior to reading training on direct tests of language function, and it even seemed superior to reading training in enhancing consonant discrimination.\n\nComposer Recognition based on 2D-Filtered Piano-Rolls\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nVelarde, Gissel; Weyde, Tillman; Cancino ChacÃ³n, Carlos\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe propose a method for music classification based on the use of convolutional models on symbolic pitch-time representations (i.e. piano-rolls) which we apply to composer recognition.

Music has also a well-known impact on the emotional state, while it can be a motivating activity. For those reasons, musical training has become a useful framework to study brain plasticity. Our aim was to study the specific effects of musical training versus the effects of other leisure activities in elderly people. With that purpose we evaluated the impact of piano training on cognitive function, mood and quality of life in older adults. A group of participants that received piano lessons and did daily training for four-month (n=13 was compared to an age-matched control group (n=16 that participated in other types of leisure activities (physical exercise, computer lessons, painting lessons, among other. An exhaustive assessment that included neuropsychological tests as well as mood and quality of life questionnaires was carried out before starting the piano program and immediately after finishing (4 months later in the two groups. We found a significant improvement on the piano training group on the Stroop test that measures executive function, inhibitory control and divided attention. Furthermore, a trend indicating an enhancement of visual scanning and motor ability was also found (Trial Making Test part A. Finally, in our study piano lessons decreased depression, induced positive mood states, and improved the psychological and physical quality of life of the elderly. Our results suggest that playing piano and learning to read music can be a useful intervention in older adults to promote cognitive reserve and improve subjective well-being.\n\nCrossmodal effects of Guqin and piano music on selective attention: an event-related potential study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhu, Weina; Zhang, Junjun; Ding, Xiaojun; Zhou, Changle; Ma, Yuanye; Xu, Dan\n\n2009-11-27\n\nTo compare the effects of music from different cultural environments (Guqin: Chinese music; piano: Western music) on crossmodal selective attention, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data in a standard two-stimulus visual oddball task were recorded from Chinese subjects in three conditions: silence, Guqin music or piano music background. Visual task data were then compared with auditory task data collected previously. In contrast with the results of the auditory task, the early (N1) and late (P300) stages exhibited no differences between Guqin and piano backgrounds during the visual task. Taking our previous study and this study together, we can conclude that: although the cultural-familiar music influenced selective attention both in the early and late stages, these effects appeared only within a sensory modality (auditory) but not in cross-sensory modalities (visual). Thus, the musical cultural factor is more obvious in intramodal than in crossmodal selective attention.\n\nExtended Piano Techniques and Teaching in Music Education Departments\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAkbulut Demirci, Sirin; Sungurtekin, Mete; Yilmaz, NilÃ¼fer; EngÃ¼r, Doruk\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe article is composed of the results of the study carried out within the scope of the project entitled \"Extended Piano Techniques and Teaching in Music Education Departments.\" Within the scope of the project, 16 students taking education at Music Education Department, Uludag University, learned six pieces composed for the project viaâ¦\n\nA Hybrid Resynthesis Model for Hammer-String Interaction of Piano Tones\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJensen Kristoffer\n\n2004-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper presents a source/resonator model of hammer-string interaction that produces realistic piano sound. The source is generated using a subtractive signal model. Digital waveguides are used to simulate the propagation of waves in the resonator. This hybrid model allows resynthesis of the vibration measured on an experimental setup. In particular, the nonlinear behavior of the hammer-string interaction is taken into account in the source model and is well reproduced. The behavior of the model parameters (the resonant part and the excitation part is studied with respect to the velocities and the notes played. This model exhibits physically and perceptually related parameters, allowing easy control of the sound produced. This research is an essential step in the design of a complete piano model.\n\nLack of spacing effects during piano learning\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nWiseheart, Melody; D?Souza, Annalise A.; Chae, Jacey\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSpacing effects during retention of verbal information are easily obtained, and the effect size is large.

It is argued that the accuracy, consistency, and scope of conclusions of previous studies can be compromised by limitations of the conventional methods relating to key inputs; physical distortion; numerical distortion, particularly when differentiation or integration of measured signals is used to derive primary response variables; contact identification; and synchronization issues. These problems are discussed, and experimental methods that have been devised to avoid them are described and illustrated by detailed results from a study of the hammer-string interaction in a vertical piano. High resolution displacements are obtained directly by non-contact high-speed imaging and quantitative motion tracking. The attention focused on achieving very accurate and consistent temporal and spatial alignment, including the objective procedure used for contact identification, allows meaningful comparisons of responses from separate tests. String motion at the strike point and on each side of it, as well as hammer motion, is obtained for eight dynamic levels from 1.06 to 2.98 m/s impact velocity. Detailed observations of the force-compression behavior of the hammer interacting with real strings are presented. The direct effects of hammer shank deflection and agraffe string pulses on the interaction are also highlighted.\n\nLearning piano melodies in visuo-motor or audio-motor training conditions and the neural correlates of their cross-modal transfer\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nEngel, Annerose; Bangert, Marc; Horbank, David; Hijmans, Brenda S.; Wilkens, Katharina; Keller, Peter E.; Keysers, Christian\n\n2012-01-01\n\nTo investigate the cross-modal transfer of movement patterns necessary to perform melodies on the piano, 22 non-musicians learned to play short sequences on a piano keyboard by 1) merely listening and replaying (vision of own fingers occluded) or 2) merely observing silent finger movements and\n\nA.L. SOKOVNINâS PIANO SCHOOL. ELENA RESHETNICHENKO â SOME TRAITS OF THE CREATIVE PORTRAIT\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMELNIC TAMARA\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article is dedicated to the memory of E. Reshetnicenco â an educator at the General Piano Department, one of the most talented representatives of A. Sokovninâs piano school. In the creations of romantic composers, which form the basis of the concert repertoire, is captured the figurative and emotional field, the most consonant to the nature of the pianist. At the same time, her interpretations combined an analytical approach to the compositions, a thorough reasoning of details, and disregard of external effects. All these were distinctive features of all Sokovninâs disciples.\n\nPianists exhibit enhanced memory for vocal melodies but not piano melodies.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWeiss, Michael W; Vanzella, PatrÃ­cia; Schellenberg, E Glenn; Trehub, Sandra E\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNonmusicians remember vocal melodies (i.e., sung to la la) better than instrumental melodies. If greater exposure to the voice contributes to those effects, then long-term experience with instrumental timbres should elicit instrument-specific advantages. Here we evaluate this hypothesis by comparing pianists with other musicians and nonmusicians. We also evaluate the possibility that absolute pitch (AP), which involves exceptional memory for isolated pitches, influences melodic memory. Participants heard 24 melodies played in four timbres (voice, piano, banjo, marimba) and were subsequently required to distinguish the melodies heard previously from 24 novel melodies presented in the same timbres. Musicians performed better than nonmusicians, but both groups showed a comparable memory advantage for vocal melodies. Moreover, pianists performed no better on melodies played on piano than on other instruments, and AP musicians performed no differently than non-AP musicians. The findings confirm the robust nature of the voice advantage and rule out explanations based on familiarity, practice, and motor representations.\n\nO meÌtodo de leitura aÌ primeira vista ao piano de Wilhelm Keilmann e sua fundamentacÌ§aÌo teoÌrica\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria Elisa Risarto\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This article aims at analyzing the foundation methods of teaching sight reading at the piano as proposed by Wilhelm Keilmann in his Introduction to Sight Reading at the Piano or other Keyboard Instrument.

To do this, the non-rectangular plate is embedded in an extended rectangular simply supported plate on which a spring distribution is added, blocking the extended part of the surface, and allowing the description of any inner surface shapes. The acoustical radiation of the embedded plate is ensured using the radiation impedances of the extended rectangular simply supported plate. This method is applied to an upright piano soundboard: a non-rectangular orthotropic plate ribbed in both directions by several straight stiffeners. A modal decomposition is adopted on the basis of the rectangular extended simply supported plate modes, making it possible to calculate the modes of a piano soundboard in the frequency range [0;3000] Hz, showing the different associated mode families. Likewise, the acoustical radiation is calculated using the radiation impedances of a simply supported baffled plate, demonstrating the influence of the string coupling point positions on the acoustic radiated power. The paper ends with the introduction of indicators taking into account spatial and spectral variations of the excitation depending on the notes, which add to the accuracy of the study from the musical standpoint. A parametrical study, which includes several variations of soundboard design, highlights the complexity of rendering high-pitched notes homogeneous.\n\nAn Analysis of Students' Self-Efficacy and Motivation in Piano, Based on Different Variables and the Reasons for Their Failure\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEgilmez, Hatice Onuray; Engur, Doruk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this study, the self-efficacy and motivation of Zeki Muren Fine Arts High School piano students were examined based on different variables as well as the reasons for their failure.

Its purpose was to address curriculum building problems in piano pedagogy. Yet, the growth and complexity of the meetings led to a change of the original purpose of the Conference, what can be interpreted as a lack of clarity or uncertainty about the meanings and boundaries of the field. Eventually, this growth led also to the end of the Conference.

The research was outlined as a multiple process carrying out in three phases. The paper discusses the valuation of the training model through the assessment of the studentâs level of attainment. The analysis included descriptive statistics for all the variables, and correlations between variables and the level of attainment. Factors that influence the studentâs progress in piano playing, studentâs individual characteristics (traits,and cognitive abilities, were measured objectively and were related to significant aspect of musical behavior. These items were assessed at the commencement of the studentâs tuition program and at the cut-off date set for the study period. Findings confirmed that the change of training model has significant impact on the studentâs progress in very short period, in this case three-week research period. Introduction of organized, and intuitive training model influenced cognitive abilities and motor skills, and personality constructs, such as anxiety, motivation, sense of contentment, self confidence, energy and effort. The difference is large enough to permit the conclusion that the proper training model leads to an important progress in studentâs piano playing.\n\nMusical Preferences as a Function of Stimulus Complexity of Piano Jazz\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGordon, Josh; Gridley, Mark C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSeven excerpts of modern jazz piano improvisations were selected to represent a range of perceived complexities.

Whether all stroke individuals respond similarly to the intervention and whether gains can be maintained over time remain unknown. We estimated the immediate and retention effects of a piano training program on upper extremity function in persons with chronic stroke. Methods: Thirteen stroke participants engaged in a 3-week piano training comprising of supervised sessions (9 x 60min and home practice. Fine and gross manual dexterity, movement coordination and functional use of the upper extremity were assessed at baseline, pre-intervention, post-intervention and at a 3-week follow-up. Results: Significant improvements were observed for all outcomes at post-intervention and follow-up, compared to pre-intervention scores. Larger magnitudes of change in manual dexterity and functional use of the upper extremity were associated with higher initial levels of motor recovery. Conclusions: Piano training can result in sustainable improvements in upper extremity function in chronic stroke survivors. Individuals with a higher initial level of motor recovery at baseline appear to benefit the most from this intervention.\n\nVibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: Reduced models, mobility synthesis, and acoustical radiation regime\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoutillon, Xavier; Ege, Kerem\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIn string musical instruments, the sound is radiated by the soundboard, subject to the strings excitation. This vibration of this rather complex structure is described here with models which need only a small number of parameters. Predictions of the models are compared with the results of experiments that have been presented in Ege et al. [Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard: (non)linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid-frequency ranges, Journal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288-1305]. The apparent modal density of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen from various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes, below and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics and by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be localised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the ribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of coupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in most cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the dynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous plates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an orthotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an arbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation point, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three inter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and high-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent modal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements. The dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation scheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It appears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical\n\nTchaikovsky: Piano Concerto N1 in B flat minor, Op.23 / David J.

In the last decades, new data-collection technologies and MIDI-based analysis allowed researchers to measure key-control specific features in timbre nuances modeling [Goebl-Bresin-Galembo 2004; Bernays-Traube 2011; 2013]. Within the field of piano performance, the present study attempts to objectively describe piano touch and the means with which it can be controlled, by: (1 providing elements for an adequate scientific understanding of touch; (2 clarifying the relationship between touch and timbre; (3 defining the extent to which the parameters of key-velocity, tempo and articulation vary as a function of different types of touch.\n\nNarratives in Teaching Practice: Matti Raekallio as Narrator in His Piano Lessons\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHyry-Beihammer, Eeva Kaisa\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe present article considers the narratives told in piano lessons, studied as both a teacher's \"way of knowing\" and as echoes of \"masters' voices\" in classical music.

As such, in the present paper, we examine the piano mover's problem. We propose a multi-agent architecture that has a training agent, learning agents and intermediate agent. Learning agents are heterogeneous and can communicate with each other. The movement of an object with three kinds of agent depends on the composition of the actions of the learning agents. By learning its own shape through the learning agents, avoidance of obstacles by the object is expected. We simulate the proposed method in a two-dimensional continuous world. Results obtained in the present investigation reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nPoetiche del sublime.

Infine, nella seconda parte, il paradigma estetico del sublime fornirÃ i termini entro i quali tracciare una ricostruzione del procedimento adattivo che lega allâoriginale leopardiano la trasposizione musicale realizzata nel 1941 da Goffredo Petrassi.\n\nChildren's Invented Notations and Verbal Responses to a Piano Work by Claude Debussy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nElkoshi, Rivka\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study considers the way children listen to classical music composed for them and the effect of age on their spontaneous invented notations and verbal responses.

The diversity of brain mechanisms involved and the joyful character of playing an instrument make musical instrument training a potential vehicle for neurorehabilitation of motor skills in patients with cerebral palsy (CP. This clinical condition is characterized by motor impairments that can affect, among others, manual function, and limit severely the execution of basic daily activities. In this study, adolescents and adult patients with CP, as well as a group of typically developing children learned to play piano for 4 consecutive weeks, having completed a total of 8Â hours of training. For ten of the participants, learning was supported by a special technical system aimed at helping people with sensorimotor deficits to better discriminate fingers and orient themselves along the piano keyboard. Potential effects of piano training were assessed with tests of finger tapping at the piano and test"
