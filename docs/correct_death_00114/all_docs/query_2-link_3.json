The roots of hip hop can be traced back to West African griots and poetry/music performances in New York City in the 1960s-1970s by artists like The Last Poets. Hip hop began in the Bronx in the 1970s during block parties where DJs would isolate the percussion breaks of funk and soul songs to make them more danceable. DJ Kool Herc is considered a pioneer in this technique. Emcees also began speaking over the music. Breakdancing arose during these early block parties. Hip hop spread through collaborations between DJs/MCs and grew to incorporate rapping, DJing, breakdancing, and graffiti art.",
