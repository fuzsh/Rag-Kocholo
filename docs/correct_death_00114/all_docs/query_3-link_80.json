WARE & MATTHEW SHIPP DUO - Live in Sant'Anna Arresi, 2004 (Aum Fidelity 100; USA) \"Live in Sant'Anna Arresi, 2004 is the 2nd volume in AUM Fidelity's David S. Ware Archive Series, and the first release of the saxophone master in rare duo performance with fellow master of music, pianist Matthew Shipp. Though sharing 17 years together in the legendary David S. Ware Quartet (along with bassist William Parker and a series of drummers), Shipp recalls that he and Ware performed duo concerts perhaps six times at most in that period. Thankfully, on this latter-day occasion, their work together in this form was professionally recorded. This concert is one continuous long-form improvisation; it spans an incredibly wide range of approaches and dynamics. The ecstatic deep listening experience of free jazz performed at a highest level avails itself here in full. Their delightfully pithy 'trading fours' encore to the concert is also included. Obviously the very deep levels of communion which were developed within the context of Ware's Quartet inform this work. In equal evidence is each of them embracing the leaderless duo context, challenging and expanding their mutual language throughout.\"\n\nCD $14\n\nEVAN PARKER / PAT THOMAS / JOHN RUSSELL / JOHN EDWARDS / ALEX WARD / ALISON BLUNT / BENEDICT TAYLOR / DAVID LEAHY / KAY GRANT - Mopomoso Tour 2013 / Making Rooms [4 CD Box Set](Weekertoft 1-4; UK) \"Originated by guitarist John Russell and pianist/trumpeter Chris Burn, Mopomoso is an improvised-music organisation that has run a series of monthly concerts in London ever since 1991, making it the longest-running such series in the UK. Between April 23rd and 30th 2013, Mopomoso embarked on a tour of England which visited seven cities outside London. At each stop, local improvising musicians supported the core group of musicians-Russell, saxophonist Evan Parker, bassists John Edwards and David Leahy, pianist Pat Thomas, violinist Alison Blunt, violist Benedict Taylor, vocalist Kay Grant and clarinetist Alex Ward.\n\nMaking Rooms is a four-CD set that was recorded on that tour. The discs are distinct, each one by a subset of the core group-the trio of Parker, Russell and Edwards (also known as House Full of Floors after their 2009 Tzadik album), Thomas solo, the all-string trio of Blunt, Taylor and Leahy, and the Grant-Ward duo.”\n\n4 CD Box Set $48 (In stock next week, please order as soon as you can)\n\nTISZIJI MUNOZ With JOHN MEDESKI/DON PATE/JOHN LOCKWOOD/RAKALAM BOB MOSES/FRANKLIN KIERMYER - Alpha Nebula Expanded: The Monster Peace (Anami Music 58; USA) Featuring Tisziji Munoz on guitar & vocals, John Medeski on piano, Don Pate & John Lockwood on basses and RaKalam Bob Moses & Franklin Kiermeyer on drums. Over the past decade guitar guru, Tisziji Munoz, has organized a series of double bands. This one has guitar & piano up front with two bassists and two drummers. Everyone in this sextet has worked with Mr. Munoz on many previous sessions except for drummer Franklin Kiermyer, who is only on one previous Munoz CD, called \\Alpha Nebula’. Although Mr. Kiermyer has recorded infrequently in recent years, you should recall a number of great discs he did in the nineties with Pharaoh Sanders, Sam Rivers and Dave Douglas.\n\nI have often wondered why a double bands with two bassists and two drummers? I do know that John Coltrane, who is Munoz’s biggest inspirations, did use two bassists (on ‘Ole’) and two or more drummers on other sessions. Right from the opening blast, the entire band is burning together in wave upon wave. John Medeski, who Munoz gave the name Lam Sobo, takes the first solo, unaccompanied at the start and then building from calm to most majestic in a short interlude. From there it is soon back into the that massive, raging, fire-breathing roller coaster ride. Both bassists and drummers create a powerful cushion, allowing Munoz to reach for the stars with his unstoppable lightning-like licks. While both bassist buzz and/or bow together, the drummers do a great job of providing layers of lines which match Munoz amazingly well. Mr. Kiermyer, who is a longtime disciple of Elvin Jones’ circular storm force drumming, is a great choice and both he and Ra-Kalam sound wonderful together. There are a number of mostly solo piano sections which also sound great and bring out a more spiritual side to John Medeski’s ever-inspired playing. There is something ultimately triumphant going in here, it is as if we are at battle with some darker forces and somehow we are able to break free with a ray of sunshine bearing down. Perfect timing for tonight’s (11/19/16) third and final presidential debate. Dig deep as the the powers that be are trying to tell us something important. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG\n\n2 CD Set $17\n\nRA-KALAM BOB MOSES With STAN STRICKLAND / VIVEK PATEL / MARK ZALESKI / JOHN LOCKWOOD / TONY FALCO - Song of the Free Will (Ra-Kalam Records 011; USA) Featuring Ra-Kalam Bob Moses on piano, djembe & percussion, Stan Stickland on tenor sax, bass clarinet & flutes, Vivek Patel on trumpet, Mark Zaleski on alto sax, John Lockwood on bass and Tony Falco on drums. Longtime drummer, composer,bandleader and professor, Bob Moses has released more than a dozen discs on his own Ra-Kalam label. Mr. Moses has been living and teaching in Boston for many years and often records with former students and fellow teachers. I do know reeds player, Stan Strickland, from his early records with Marty Ehrlich and ongoing collaborations with Mr. Moses. I don’t know either of the other two horn players here but I do know bassist John Lockwood from his work with the Fringe and several Munoz records. Young drummer, Tony Falco has also been working with Munoz on several newer recordings.\n\nWhat makes this disc different from most discs on Ra—Kalam, is that Mr. Moses concentrates on piano instead of drums, a first for him. This session originally started out with just piano and drums, Moses and Falco. Ra-Kalam decided it needed more to flesh it out so he added a handful of his favorite musicians, hence this disc. “Skies of Copenhagen” opens with cerebral flutes, dreamy trumpet, haunting piano, humming bass and sublime percussion. Moses plays inside the piano to great effect, muting & rubbing the strings or bouncing something on top of them, adding a mysterious haze to the proceedings. Each of the fourteen pieces seems to evoke a different vibe or restless spirit. The calm vibe at center slowly builds as the piano and drums increase in tempo and intensity. There is a version of the civil rights anthem, “We Shall Overcome”, which is most enchanting. There is something most endearing going on here, helping me to make throughout the day in an even better way. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG\n\nCD $12\n\nKARMA SHENPEN OZER With STAN STRICKLAND / JOHN LOCKWOOD / TUPAC MANTILLA GOMEZ / RA-KALAM BOB MOSES - Sun’s Golden Rule (Ra-Kalam Records; USA) Featuring Karma Shenpen Ozer on guitar & compositions, Stan Strickland on flute, tenor sax & bass clarinet, John Lockwood on bass Tupac Mantilla Gomez & Ra-Kalam Bob Moses on drums & percussion. I hadn’t heard of the leader/guitarist on this date, Karma Shenpen Ozer, before this disc arrived. What I do know is that this disc was produced by Ra-Kalam Bob Moses and that Mr. Ozer is backed by some of Moses’ usual collaborators: Strickland, Lockwood and Mantilla. This discs starts with a refreshing laid-back, dreamy vibe. Mr. Ozer plays several guitars, all flowing in a d around one another in a somber stream. Calm, delicate, sublime. It took some time to adjust to the that central, peaceful vibe. There is one track called, “Chaco Canyon” where the group sails out to space for some more cerebral, freer sailing. The bowed bass and layers of percussion create ghost-like phantoms which are most hypnotic. I wish there were more of this going on. Overall, the calm vibe does feel good especially during those times when we are surrounded by stressful distractions. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG\n\nCD $12\n\nThree New Discs from the Fine Folks at CorbettVsDempsey:\n\nEUGENE CHADBOURNE With TOM CORA/JOHN ZORN/DAVID LICHT + SCOTT MANRING/ROBBIE LINK - There’ll Be No Tears Tonight + 2 Bonus tracks (CvsD 030; USA) Featuring Eugene Chadbourne on guitars, dobro & vocals, John Zorn on alto, soprano & bari saxes & bird calls, Tom Cora on cello & David Licht on drums plus Scott Manring on lap steel guitar and Robbie Link on acoustic bass. This session was originally recorded in the Spring of 1980 and released on an LP for Eugene Chadbourne own Parachute label. I had just started seeing & hearing Mr. Chadbourne (plus Mr.’s Zorn & Cora) during the previous year thanks to Fred Frith who was just about to move to New York. I had seen/heard Mr. Frith improvise with a new cast of early Downtown musicians who I didn’t take seriously or understand at first, probably due to being a jazz or prog snob. After hearing Mr. Zorn play in a bebop quartet and checking out several game pieces, I was slowly becoming a big fan of this new and under-regarded scene.\n\nI remember buying this album when it came out and being rather confused since Mr. Chadbourne sings and covers a number of classic country songs. Neither of these things I had heard Chadbourne do live by this point. I had rarely listened to any country music so I was only vaguely familiar with some of these songs. It would be another decade before I started exploring the depths of country music from folks like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard. Strangely enough, every song on this reissue, except for the final free jam, is a cover of a country standard. The artists covered include: Carl Perkins, Roger Miller, David Allan Coe, Hank Williams and Willie Nelson. Side One features a quartet with Chadbourne, Zorn, Cora and Licht.\n\nStarting with a swell version of “Honey Don‘t”, a rockabilly song that was covered by the Beatles. There is something most charming about the way the quartet both skewers and plays these songs in an affection way, Downtown style. Doc Chad does a great job of covering songs that resonate with the universal feelings of lost love, loneliness, frustration, religion and drinking. Some songs end in a blaze of free insanity, yet everything organically flows through connected interludes. The sly, subversive attitude of what made Downtown music a distinctive blend is apparent throughout this disc. Mr. Chadbourne’s lightning quick licks and goofy yet heartfelt vocals are often at the center of these songs. Within a year or so Mr. Chadbourne would organize a group called the Chadbournes (with Zorn, Cora & Licht) which would quickly mutate into Shockabilly (with Mark Kramer & David Licht). There is a gleeful,uplifting vibe in this music which I find most charming. It is fascinating to hear this detour or signpost from what Downtown was and what it became afterwards. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG\n\nCD $15\n\nJOE McPHEE & ANDRE JAUME - Nuclear Family (CvsD031; USA) Featuring Joe McPhee on alto & tenor saxes & pocket cornet and Andre Jaume alto & tenor saxes & bass clarinet. “Multi-instrumental master McPhee and his longtime colleague, French saxophonist and clarinetist Jaume, joined forces for this studio recording in 1979 that was prepared but never released. It is primarily structured around pairs of tunes by Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, and Duke Ellington (or Billy Strayhorn), adding Ornette Coleman's \"Lonely Woman\" for good measure. The results are stunningly intimate and show the twosome's capacity for creative interplay at a fairly early stage in its unfolding. Mingus's \"Pithecanthropus Erectus,\" which was performed by a larger group on Topology, gets pared down to its essential walking-bass-ness, while Monk's \"Evidence\" is taken apart, and solo spots by both men are riveting as one would expect. Part of CvsD's ongoing historical effort to unearth and reissue McPhee's important discography, this previously unknown recording will delight existing fans and make new ones.” - CvsD\n\nCD $15\n\nTRISTAN HONSINGER With SEAN BERGIN / TOSHINORI KONDO / TIZIANA SIMONA / JEAN-JACQUES AVENEL / MICHAEL VATCHER - Picnic (CvsD 28; USA / Data 852; Netherlands) “A little-known gem of Dutch free music, Picnic is the brainchild of cellist Tristan Honsinger, who composed all but one of its 12 compositions. Brilliant and whimsical, the tracks bring to mind Honsinger's work with ICP Orchestra, for whom he has also composed extensively. Here he's working in an incredible ensemble, with trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, saxophonist Sean Bergen, Jean Jacques Avenel on bass, Michael Vatcher on drums and percussion, and Tiziana Simona Vigni on voice. Deceptively vicious little songs with hilarious twists and the kind of intense improvising you'd expect from a band that incorporates players of this caliber, it's a unique LP, originally issued on the tiny Data label, never before reissued. And it's worth having alone for the beautiful recording by Data's Dick Lucas, which captures Vatcher's incredible high snare on \"Restless,\" a minute of pure energy better than Red Bull, and Vigni's oblique vocals, which were sung mostly in English by the Italian singer, who didn't speak a word of the language. Remastered by Lucas from the original tapes, featuring the gorgeous cover, in another deluxe package.” - CvsD\n\nThere is something about New England-born, Amsterdam based cellist, Tristan Honsinger, that always surprises me and makes me smile. In Honsinger’s hands and voice, the lines between eccentricity and inventiveness are often blurred. We never know what to expect yet something magically twisted always happens. This mysterious disc was recorded and released in 1985 and brings together an unusual bunch of characters: Mr. Honsinger, longtime cellist & madman for the ICP Orchestra, unpredictable trumpet demon Toshinori Kondo (early Downtown collaborator with Chadbourne & Frith), Dutch saxist Sean Bergin who was originally from South Africa, French bassist Jean-Jacques Avenel (longtime member of the Steve lacy Trio) and another American expatriate, Michael Vatcher on drums.\n\nCD $15\n\nTHE WESTERLIES//SAM AMIDON/NICO MUHLY/DUKE ELLINGTON/ et al - The Westerlies (Songlines 1617; Canada) The Westerlies are Riley Mulherkar and Zubin Hensler, trumpets, and Andy Clausen and Willem de Koch, trombones. Childhood friends from Seattle, they formed in New York in 2011 while studying at Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music. Following their critically acclaimed debut album Wish the Children Would Come On Home: The Music of Wayne Horvitz, The Westerlies return to their roots as an original music ensemble with this self-titled sophomore release, showcasing the quartet in a boldly personal setting. This double-disc set features 14 compositions by The Westerlies, as well as pieces by Ellington and Ives, and an English folk ballad arranged by Sam Amidon and Nico Muhly. The Westerlies bring together jazz, improvisational, classical and folk approaches, navigating the music with the precision of a string quartet, the audacity of a rock band, and the charm of a family folk ensemble. This album is the product of four composer-performers who, though they grew up in the same city, have unique and diverse musical backgrounds. The listener can hear each composer gently tugging the ensemble in the direction of his own taste, and the band follows, expressing their friendship through musical empathy. The high-res recording is a collaboration with producer/engineer Jesse Lewis (Roomful of Teeth, Brooklyn Rider, Silk Road Ensemble with Yo-Yo Ma), and it pushes the expressive palette and sonic limits of chamber music. The Westerlies are an accidental brass quartet, the product of a shared history and musical philosophy; because of their somewhat unorthodox instrumentation, they've cultivated an entirely original and personal repertoire of compositions, arrangements, and vocabulary. This is not conservatory music: it exudes warmth, beauty, humor, surprise, and genuinely quirky attitude, but it's all performed with consummate skill. It's music that's equally at home in rock or jazz clubs, in concert halls, at folk festivals, or on \"indie-classical\" series. check out a sample at: //www.westerliesmusic.com/music\n\n2 CD Set $16\n\nVASCO TRILLA - The Rainbow Serpent (FMR 417; UK) Featuring Vasco Trilla on prepared drums assorted percussion. Although this disc is listed as (mainly) percussion, it starts with swirling drones: bowed cymbals? a small motor whirring? This disc was recorded at a studio in Barcelona, Spain. The title of this disc, ‘The Rainbow Serpent’ refers to a “common deity, often a creator god, in the mythology and a common motif in the art of Aboriginal Australia.” - Wiki. The sound of carefully bowed cymbals and ritualistic percussion is what makes this disc work. Some of the sounds are motorized and sound sped up and a bit disorienting. What this most reminds me of is Jo Jones Tone Deaf Music Company, a dadaist instrument-maker who worked with Yoko Ono & John Lennon for one side of Ono’s ‘Fly’ album. When things quiet down, there is a calm drone of bells of cymbals being bowed perhaps? Each piece seems to focus on one vibrating texture: bowed styrofoam? rubbed surfaces? Each piece creates a different mood or vibe. Mr. Trilla plays a normal-sounding drum kit on a few of these pieces, still creating calm. graceful, thoughtful series of rhythmic ideas. Parts of this also sound a bit like Bertoia Should Sculptures. Transforamtive and most often enchanting in its own way. - BLG/DMG\n\nCD $13\n\nFREE NELSON MANDOOMJAZZ - The Organ Grinder (Rare Noise 068; EEC) Featuring Rebecca Snedder on alto & soprano saxes, Colin Stewart on electric bass and Paul Archibald on drums & keyboards plus guests Luc Klein on trumpet and Patrick Darley on trombone. The saying goes: what’s in a name or don’t judge a book by the cover, however we do often prejudge musicians and groups due to the way they look or their names, serious or silly. This is the third disc from the UK trio, Free Nelson Mandoomjazz (FN MDJ), and you must admit that this is one of the most ridiculous names we’ve heard in a long while. I never got a chance to hear their first disc, but we recently got a promo copy of their second and I must admit that I am quite impressed. FN MDJ hail from Edinburgh and I hadn’t heard of any of the members before this disc arrived. I am not sure how large the scene is in Scotland, but I am familiar with the Raymond MacDonald Group and the Glasgow Improvisers Orchestra.\n\nThis trio has a strong, dark sound with the electric bass growling at the center. When the trio erupts into a faster tempo on “Open the Gate”, Ms. Sneddon squeaks and twists those notes in a most Zorn-like way. Although not quite so funky Free Nelson sounds like an the British band Back Door (1971-1976), who had the same instrumentation. Things get a bit dark and gloomy midway through this long disc, the bass throbbing at the center withe the horns chattering at the sides. Although most of the pieces here are originals, there is one cover, Horace Silver’s “Calcutta Cutie”. An odd choice, not really since the band do it in a unique way, giving a middle-eastern vibe. I really dig the twisted horn harmonies on “LORA”, falling somewhere between British jazz and South Africa groove from the early seventies. Each piece seems to evoke a different mood, Sometimes eerie, sometimes filled with suspense but always rather transformative. The one thing I like most about the Rare Noise label is the way they search for select oddly mixed groups with members from jazz, rock and progressive scenes and then come up with unpredictable yet stunning results. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG\n\nCD $15\n\nThree New Discs from the Wandelweiser Collective Composers label, In Stock shortly:\n\nJOHN CAGE - Branches (Wandelweiser EWR 9901; Austria) The Ensemble Daswirdas performs John Cage's \"Branches\" composition, which is based on a previous work, \"Child of Tree\", but here each performer plays an 8 minute variation of that work, which is performed on amplified pods, cacti, and other plant materials. \"The score for this work consists solely of performance instructions. The instruments to be used are amplified pods, cacti, and other plant materials, such as pod rattles from a Poinciana tree, which Cage specifically mentions in the score. Other instruments are to be selected by the performers, using I-Ching chance operations. Cacti are played by plucking needles with toothpicks, amplifying their sounds via cartridge-like attachments, originally constructed by John D. Fullemann. Branches is essentially a series of variations of Cage's Child of Tree, strung together on a string of silence, which precedes it in performance.\"- John Cage.Org\n\nCD $13\n\nRADU MALFATTI - Radu Malfatti (Wandelweiser EWR 9801; Austria) Austrian trombonist and composer presents two works: a solo piece for trombone comprised of a series of detached sonic events; and a work performed with the Wandelweiser String Quartet, using bowing and blowing techniques to create punctuations of unusual sound.\n\n\"In Radu Malfatti's music nothing special happens.That is a distinct quality. Very simple things happen which can easily be named as bowing or blowing; bowing on the tailpiece, bowing on the tuning peg for the third string, blowing at a specified angle into the trombone, blowing with a specified shape of the mouth cavity. These activities become perceptible because of the sounds: one hears the noise of bowing, that is, thus-bowing or thus-blowing. In these works no sound goes beyond this perceptible activity. The sound of bowing or of blowing can he distinguished from the corresponding activities, but cannot, however, be detached. Not once is an independent object created, such as a motive or a figure, a rhythm or a pulse - or even a particular sound. Only sounding: \"a-sounding-of-some-length\"; for instance, \"a-bowing-of-some-length\". - Antoine Beuger\n\nCD $13\n\nSERGIO MERCE - Be Nothing (Wandelweiser EWR 1604; Austria) A beautifully ambient album of analogue synthesiser, microtonal saxophone and electronics by Argentinian saxophonist Sergio Merce, a single long track that pauses and resumes its rich tones and harmonies at a deliberate and measured pace, allowing each environment to ring.\n\n\"The cover is white with grey sans-serif text and on the inside sleeve, across from a dilated monochrome image of snow or possibly sand, are the lowercase words: \"why are we frightened to be nothing?\" Which would normally set me squirming, except that this is classic Wandelweiser - a select group of composers and performers whose aesthetic fixates on sparse, quiet, slow and subtly shaded sounds. The hour-long title track - the disc's only one - for analogue synthesizer, microtonal saxophone and electronics by Argentinian saxophonist Sergio Merce often dissolves into long stretches of silence or pauses for whole minutes to consider a single groggy drone. It goes further into ambient territory than most Wandelweiser releases - yoga studios may find good use for it - but it is something worth listening to. The overtones are whispered, but listen closely and they're incredibly lustrous; gentle palpitations in the bass keep nudging the momentum forwards, unhurried but always on the move.\"- Kate Molleson, The Guardian UK\n\nCD $13\n\nBack in Stock after Two Months, I still haven’t heard it but we did get a promo so…\n\nPAULINE OLIVEROS / ROSCOE MITCHELL / JOHN TILBURY / WADADA LEO SMITH - Nessuno (IDA 035; Italy) Featuring: Pauline Oliveros - V-Accordion. Roscoe Mitchell - alto & soprano saxophone, flute, John Tilbury - piano and Wadada Leo Smith - trumpet. “In 2011 Pauline Oliveros, Roscoe Mitchell, John Tilbury and Wadada Leo Smith opened the AngelicA Festival with 3 days of concerts… they performed solos and duets (Pauline and Roscoe; John and Wadada), and finally, for the first time ever, these 4 distinct musical voices performed together, as a quartet… Over time AngelicA (which is 26 years old) has always tried to bring together different worlds, even ones that were very far apart from each other (although distance is nothing but an illusion if it is not prescribed by cultural boundaries): through the creative forces that come alive in these encounters, if possible, to rediscover spaces for expression beyond the original contexts… A vision that comes, takes over, and pushes you in that direction, which otherwise would be hard to explore… I am very thankful for the musicians who took up the invitation as a natural possibility…” - Massimo Simonini (March 2016)\n\nCD $16\n\nTwo New Intakt just about to Arrive Early!\n\nWe listed these two last week and then found out that they were not shipping until closer to street date.

I can’t wait to hear this new from Downtown’s most ambitious saxist & composer Ingrid Laubrock. Each of Ms. Laubrock’s several projects/bands (Anti-House, Sleep Thief, Duo with Tom Rainey & Paradoxical Frog), shows her growth as a diverse, skillful composer as well as becoming a daredevil, risk-taking saxist. Considering the line-up, this looks to be one the year’s most talked about discs. CD release concert at Roulette on Thursday, December 15 at 8pm. Promo just arrived so that I will review soon. - BLG\n\nCD $18\n\nALEX VON SCHLIPPENBACH / EVAN PARKER / PAUL LOVENS - Warsaw Concert (Intakt 275; Switzerland) Featuring Alexander Von Schlippenbach on piano, Evan Parker on tenor sax and Paul Lovens on drums. “These recordings, from 16 October 2015 in Warsaw, make a great all-round representation of the trio as we are right now. The ‘free’ improvisations also develop material which has crystalised over the years. There was no plan agreed in advance. Nothing was discussed or decided. Everything improvised. The paraphrases of particular jazz themes, like embedded particles, should not be understood as quotations. They are a reference to our history, creating contrasts and also serving as an springboard for further development. We played continuously, without planned breaks. That’s how it mostly goes with us.\n\nThe immortal trio. It has already achieved a lot, and in many cases you could say, that’s enough. But not necessarily for us. It’s like this: we’ve been playing together so long it doesn’t really matter if we carry on or not. If we were to stop, there are things we’d miss (the anti-depressive effect for instance) but in some senses it might also be a relief. If we carry on it’s also good, because people do actually need our music, and there’s still lots to be said. So we will carry on and in December we’ll be going on our ‘Winter Journey’.\n\nAnd it was great in Warsaw. A top rate concert hall from the broadcasting company. Good recording technology. But we never saw Kinga, an assistant it was agreed we would be given. - Alexander von Schlippenbach, July 2016\n\nCD $18\n\nHistoric & Archival Recordings, Reissues & Restocks Items:\n\nCHARLES MINGUS With JACKIE McLEAN/JIMMY KNEPPER/MAL WALDRON/MAX ROACH/GEORGE BARROW/EDDIE BERT/HAMPTON HAWES/DANNY RICHMOND/ et al - Complete Albums Collection 1953-1957 [4 CD Set] (Enlightenment 9093; EEC) One of the most important figures in the development of American music, Charles Mingus will forever be remembered as being amongst the most inspirational and innovative composers and musicians of the 20th Century. A virtuoso double bassist and an accomplished pianist, Mingus' extensive back catalogue of legendary recordings set a new standard in jazz experimentation, blending hard bop with elements of gospel, blues, classical and avant-garde. With a fearsome reputation as bandleader, Mingus' direction drew some of the finest performances from the best performers ever to grace the genre, and in turn he left his mark on the work of generations of jazz musicians. This four disc collection, containing 10 original Charles Mingus records, serves as a superb introduction to the genius of the great man as bandleader. Running at over five hours in completion, with these classic records remastered to the highest possible quality, this compilation of early works demonstrates just how advanced Mingus' skills were at this early point in his recording career. Featuring a host of fine supporting musicians across a selection featuring some of his most important albums, this set will prove a delight for both the long term fan and those new to the glories of Charles Mingus' music.\n\n4 CD Set $18\n\nCHARLES MINGUS With JOHN HANDY/BOOKER ERVIN/SHAFI HADI/JIMMY KNEPPER/HORACE PARLAN/PEPPER ADAMS/DANNIE RICHMOND/ et al - Complete Albums Collection 1957-1960 [4 CD Set] (Enlightenment 9094; EEC) Renowned for his virtuoso musical ability, his compositional genius and his astonishing body of work, Charles Mingus has left an enduring and revered legacy equal to, if not surpassing, any other jazz musician. A pioneer of double bass and keen practitioner of collective improvisation within his various groups, Mingus enlisted the talents of many up-and-coming musicians, encouraging them to interact with each other in the most unconventional ways. His skills as an arranger brought him much acclaim from his peers, with legendary trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie dubbing him an \"organisational genius\" and comparing him to a young Duke Ellington. As testament to Mingus' abilities, he produced many groundbreaking albums during his lifetime, a number of which remain counted among the finest jazz records ever made. This boxed set, featuring eight complete albums across four CDs, captures perfectly the genius of Charles Mingus during one of the most exciting and musically adventurous periods of his career. Containing over five hours of music, beautifully remastered from the original recordings, the collection presented here is the ideal starting point for any student of the great man's music and a fitting reminder of his genius for the more seasoned admirer.\n\n4 CD Set $18\n\nCHARLES MINGUS With ERIC DOLPHY/CHARLIE MARIANO/TED CURSON/BOOKER ERVIN/CLIFFORD JORDAN/JOHNNY COLES/JAKI BYARD/DANNIE RICHMOND/ et al - Complete Albums Collection 1960-1963 (Enlightenment 9095; EEC) Charles Mingus passed away in Cuernavaca, Mexico, on 5th January 1979 at the age of 56; his ashes were scattered in the Ganges River. Following his death, Mingus has continued to be recognized as a major force in jazz music and much of his previously unheard work has now been released. In 1989, Mingus' original vision for the Town Hall Concert was realized by composer Gunther Schuller on Epitaph (Columbia, 1990). Produced by Mingus' widow Sue, the piece lasted in excess of two hours, and was performed by a 30-strong band which included appearances from Wynton Marsalis, Don Butterfield and John Handy. In 1993, Mingus' entire catalogue of compositions was preserved by the Library of Congress, an event described as \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history\". He received a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997, and was inducted into the Jazz at Lincoln Center, Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame in 2005. The Mingus Big Band has been performing and recording the music of Charles Mingus for over 20 years, and they received a Grammy in 2011 for Mingus Big Band Live at Jazz Standard (Jazz Workshop, Inc. /Jazz Standard, 2010). They have continued to showcase his compositions at the famous New York club every Monday night since 2008. This four CD set collects together eight original Charles Mingus albums from the early 1960s. Containing over five hours of music from the great man and featuring some of the finest jazz ever recorded, the sheer magnificence of his talents is here displayed in all its glory for both the newcomer to Mingus' music and for the seasoned admirer. Featuring a body of work that revolutionized the jazz genre and equally changed the course of 20th century American music forever, this compilation will delight and astonish all those who take the time to listen. Eight albums included: ’Newport Rebels’, ‘Oh Yeah’, ‘The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady’, ‘Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus’, ’Tijuana Moods’, ‘Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus’, ‘Mingus’ and ‘Town Hall Concert’.\n\n4 CD Set $18\n\nKENNY BURRELL With JIMMY RANEY/HANK MOBLEY/DONALD BYRD/ART FARMER/MAL WALDRON/TOMMY FLANAGAN/PAUL CHAMBERS/KENNY CLARKE/ - Complete Albums Collection 1956-1957 [4 CD Set](Enlightenment 9091; EEC) In the world of jazz guitar, few players can measure up to the skill, stature and sheer influence that Kenny Burrell brought to the genre. With his trademark straightforward playing that fused jazz and blues beautifully, this pioneer featured on hundreds of albums, both as leader of his own groups and as a much in-demand sideman for others. Often hailed as the greatest guitarist in the world - he was the personal favorite of the legendary B.B. King - Burrell's playing has gone on to permanently change the way in which the instrument is approached and, in so doing, has influenced generation after generation of likeminded musicians. This four disc collection, containing eight fully remastered albums, provides the perfect introduction to one of the finest and most innovative musicians still active today. Totaling over five hours music, presented here is the entirety of Kenny Burrell's early catalogue as band leader, demonstrating clearly why his place in the history of jazz is justly deserved. Recorded with the assistance of some of the finest players of his generation, the set not only provides an ideal starting point for a study of this legendary guitarist, but an essential component for any eclectic jazz collection.\n\n4 CD Set $18\n\nKENNY BURRELL With JOHN COLTRANE/TOMMY FLANAGAN/IDREES SULIEMAN/JUNIOR COOK/TINA BROOKS/SAM JONES/ART BLAKEY/ et al - Complete Albums Collection 1957-1962 [4 CD Set](Enlightenment 9092; EEC) Since he first played professionally, Kenny Burrell has been one of the most respected guitarists in all of jazz. He has been referred to as \"the greatest guitarist in the world\" by B.B. King and \"the grand master of jazz guitar\" by Dizzy Gillespie, and he has influenced the work of Jimi Hendrix, Pat Metheny and a host of other respected players. With his direct approach that blends elements of jazz and blues in an impeccable manner, Burrell's work has graced more than 90 albums recorded under his own name, and he has featured on many more as sideman to some of the other most influential figures in jazz, including Billie Holiday, Jimmy Smith, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Randy Weston, Yusuf Lateef and Sonny Rollins. This four disc box set, encompassing an essential half decade in the staggering career of this extraordinary musician, is testament to the ongoing appeal and quality of Kenny Burrell's sound, and illustrates why he remains a true jazz legend more than 50 years since the release of these LPs. Containing eight complete, remastered albums and over five hours of Burrell's sublime, soulful playing, this set provides the ideal selection of the man's music, and reveals the roots of just about every skilled guitarist that has come along since.\n\n4 CD Set $18\n\n482 Music CD Sale!\n\nThe Entire in-Print catalogue will soon be lowered in price.

Originally released on Trojan in 1974, it was essentially a re-release of the Soul Rebels LP from 1970, with a few extra tracks. This historic release marked Bob Marley & the Wailers first collaboration with Lee Perry and the true beginning of their musical and spiritual commitment to Rastafari. This is Bob Marley and the original Wailers (Peter Tosh & Bunny Wailer) long before they became international reggae superstars with Island.

Tony Allen talks about the album: \"After Black Voices (KSTA 006LP) and Psyco On Da Bus albums, I came back with HomeCooking which was an album filled with guests. I brought in Ty, who had remixed some of my work previously, to rap on the record, and Damon Albarn, who had already sung about me on 'Music Is My Radar'. On the first day in the studio, Damon didn't record anything because we were enjoying ourselves too much. He came with two boxes of champagne and everyone got boozed and he decided he'd take the music back to his own studio and finish it there. That was the beginning of our friendship and since then we've done a lot of different things. Since the early days I've been trying to find things that everybody will want to listen to. I've always been pushing Afrobeat in different directions. Here's another one again, another style, almost clean but still rough, raggedy and radical.'' Also features: Mary & Norman and Eska.\n\n2 LP set $28\n\nGRAHAM LAMBKIN - Community )Kye 045; USA) \"Kye is proud to announce the release of Community, the new solo LP by Graham Lambkin, following 2011's Amateur Doubles. 'Community is a music steeped in sociological review. It sits as a keen barometer, taking the temperature of the world around it. Community is both willing servant and social mirror - it performs its basic civic duty without fuss, then shatters.' (José Perez, downstairs neighbor). Mastered by Jason Lescalleet, Community arrives in a deluxe matte finish gatefold with corresponding printed inner-sleeves in an edition of 500 copies.\"\n\nLP $24\n\nMYRIAM GENDRON - Not So Deep as a Well (Feeding Tube Records FTR 146-4; USA) The debut LP by Montreal's Myriam Gendron is one of 2014's signature releases. Feeding Tube had previously been made aware of Myriam when she performed at the Michael Hurley cover tune showcase at the Casa del Popolo. That event, tied to l'Oie de Cravan's publication of The Words to the Songs of Michael Hurley, introduced Myriam as a wonderful if spectral guitarist and singer, whose signature sound was as light as it was intoxicating. Her next performance was an event including the American poet Charles Plymell, and she debuted a set of material based on the poems of Dorothy Parker. Everyone was blown away. Plymell and Gerard Malanga were effusive in their praise of her work, and when a tape fell into the hands of Richard Meltzer, he agreed that Myriam's approach to the material attained a singularity of loss that had not yet been approached. The set was a stun gun, set on its highest possible notch. It blew away anything similar, and achieved a wordy beauty that both buggered description and celebrated itself. Parker's poetry -- though little-known in comparison to her prose -- offers many possibilities of both beauty and humor. Myriam grabs every edge availed to her, and does so beautifully. This album glows with holism and is one of the most beautiful evocations of times past and present and future you will hear. Edition of 500.\n\nLP $19\n\nFOUR THING - Four Thing (Feeding Tube Records FTR 290; USA) \"Zach Phillips was a fixture in the Brattleboro scene for a good many years. As a member of Blanche Blanch Blanche and Big French (among others), as well as the creator of many solo projects under various guises, runner of the OSR label, and all around Renaissance handyman, Phillips moved to Brooklyn a while back. Once ensconced there he began playing as half of CE Schneider Topical, and generally stirring up the same kinds of mytery-aktion which had marked his northern existence. Four Thing is the result of one his more oblique strategies. Ostensibly a surrealist parlor game involving four objects, four players, and four potential event sequences, Four Thing is one of Zach's concepts made flesh. Or vinyl. Four lyricists -- Jeremy Daly (Lou Breed), Quentin Moore (Big French, etc.), Hanna Novak (playwright & theater tech associated with Half Straddle) and Christina Schneider (of CE Schneider Topical and Jepeto Solutions), interpreted by four singers -- Becca Kauffman (Ava Luna, Jennifer Vanilla), Ben Russell (Brooklyn-based actor), Sami Stevens (Tredici Bacci), and Colin White (R. Hundro), with music and direction by Zach, and superb squint-em art by Sarah D. Smith (Blanche Blanche Blanche). Hard to figure exactly if there are four objects dealt with in each set of lyrics, but whether or not there are, the structures of the 16 pieces have an elegantly compelling weirdo-pop logic that will make any room feel like a parlor. The keyboard based miniatures make us think what the Weekend might have sounded like if they'd decided to enlist the Bonzos's Neil Innes as a member. There's an edge to the proceedings that zooms in and out like a crazy, animated telescope. Parts recall expanses of the classic Peter Blegvad/John Greaves LP, Kew Rhone, although there are also kinks that make one think of Art & Language-era Red Krayola. It's kind of like listening to a Rubik's cube. In the best way possible.\" --Byron Coley, 2016. \"This is an opera, an opera based on a made-up game. Four weird librettists, four weird singers, some unholy chug of gem crashes in the popping by below.\" --Chris Weisman, 2016.

Includes CD. With half a century of existence, Beninese band Poly-Rythmo can easily be considered a legend of African music, alongside Fela Kuti and Tinariwen. Drawing their name from the extensive mix of influences that forged their sound (American soul and funk, Nigerian Afro-beat, French chanson, Congolese rumba, etc.), they have been impressively productive, releasing hundreds of EPs and dozens of albums from 1969 to 1980 alone. In 2014, orchestra conductor Florent Mazzoleni visited the band and decided to produce Madjafalao, recorded in the legendary African studio Satel. With its warm tone and mastery of rhythm variations, Madjafalao (\"Watch Out\") will instantly become a classic of Afro-beat and Poly-Rythmo will share their warm joie de vivre with thousands of people.\n\nLP+CD $26\n\nCHAITANYA HARI DEUTER/BHAGWAN SHREE RAJNEESH - Kundalini Meditation (No Label 001; USA) Space age masterpiece from krautrock mystic Deuter, this album contains the music for the first two stages of an hour long kundalini meditation developed for westerners by Rajneesh (later known as Osho). The stages involve listening to the music and \"Shaking\" (stage one), \"Dancing\" (stage two), and \"Witnessing\" (stage three). These stages are not really meditations but a sort of preparation to facilitate meditation. Rajneesh had been trying to teach the practice of direct meditation for ten years before he realized his effort was futile: \"I would say, 'Relax', to those I was teaching. They would appear to understand the meaning of the word, but they could not relax.\" He developed a technique that would activate the body with intense movement, creating tension in order to allow for the stillness of the meditation. Deuter and Rajneesh (along with a team of disciples that tested and consulted on these methods) collaborated to make music that would (in stage one and two) occupy the mind and compel the body. The music of stage three was designed to relax the body and compel the mind to awareness, acting as a transition to stage four, which is silent, with the person lying down, (actually) meditating. Speaking about music, Rajneesh wrote, \"Between sounds of music there are gaps of silence. The authentic music consists not of sounds, but of the gaps. Music can make you aware of those gaps more beautifully than anything else.\" While living at the ashram as a disciple of Rajneesh, Deuter produced a series of compositions to be used in these \"active\" meditations. They were recorded using a multitrack tape machine and an assortment of acoustic and electronic instruments - guitar, tambura, bells, percussion, and synthesizers. The playing style is repetitious yet dynamic, incorporating loops, Indian classical motifs, musique concrète, and pastoral acoustic passages. Kundalini Meditation, never released on vinyl in the states, is presented here for the first time with the full length tracks. It was originally released in 1979.\n\nLP $20\n\n*******\n\nBruce Lee Gallanter’s Recommended Gig List for September of 2016:\n\nTHE STONE is located at the NW corner of Avenue C & East 2nd Sts.\n\nTHE STONE RESIDENCIES - BRIAN CHASE - OCT 18–23\n\n10/21 Friday\n\n8 pm - Susie Ibarra & Brian Chase (drums)\n\n10 pm - Lee Ranaldo (guitar) Susie Ibarra, Brian Chase (drums)\n\n10/22 Saturday\n\n8 pm - Anthony Coleman (piano) & Brian Chase (drums)\n\n10 pm - COLLAPSIBLE SHOULDER - Chris Cochrane (guitar) Kevin Bud Jones (synth, sampler) Kato Hideki (bass) Brian Chase (drums)\n\n10/23 Sunday\n\n8 pm - DRUMS AND DRONES\n\nBrian Chase (tuned snare drum, computer, electronics)\n\n10 pm - Samita Sinha (voice, electronics) Brian Chase (drums)\n\nTHE STONE RESIDENCIES - AVA MENDOZA - OCT 25–30\n\n10/25 Tuesday\n\n8 pm - Solo - Ava Mendoza (guitar, electronics, sing)\n\n10 pm - Ava Mendoza Quintet - Peter Evans (trumpet) Ava Mendoza (guitar) Matt Mitchell (Prophet 12 synth, piano) Devin Hoff (bass) Mike Pride (drums, perc)\n\n10/26 Wednesday\n\n8 pm - Unnatural Ways + John Dikeman - Ava Mendoza (guitar, sing) Tim Dahl (bass) Sam Ospovat (drums) John Dikeman (tenor sax)\n\n10 pm - Trio - John Dikeman (tenor sax) Ava Mendoza (guitar) Man of Mystery (drums, percussion)\n\n10/27 Thursday\n\n8 pm - Quok - Ava Mendoza (guitar) Tim Dahl (bass) Weasel Walter (drums)\n\n10 pm - Pavone/Mendoza Duo - Jessica Pavone (viola) Ava Mendoza (guitar)\n\n10/28 Friday\n\n8 pm - Bran(…)pos + Mendoza Duo - Bran(…)pos (vox, electronics) Ava Mendoza (vox, guitar)\n\n10 pm - Quartet - Ava Mendoza (guitar) Matt Nelson (sax) Jamaaladeen Tacuma (bass) Ryan Sawyer (drums)\n\n10/29 Saturday\n\n8 pm - Unnatural Ways + Levy Lorenzo - Ava Mendoza (guitar, sing) Tim Dahl (bass) Sam Ospovat (drums) Levy Lorenzo (electronics, percussion)\n\n10 pm - Unnatural Ways - Ava Mendoza (guitar, sing) Tim Dahl (bass) Sam Ospovat (drums)\n\n10/30 Sunday\n\n8 pm - Quartet - Matt Nelson (sax, electronics) Ava Mendoza (guitar) Max Johnson (contrabass) Weasel Walter (drums)\n\n10 pm - Chaser - Dominika Michalowska (vokills) Ava Mendoza (guitar) Shayna Dulberger (bass) Oran Canfield (drums)\n\nThere are no refreshments or merchandise at The Stone.\n\nOnly music.
