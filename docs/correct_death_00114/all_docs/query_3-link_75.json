        "text": "Billy Lamont (April 28, 1930 - June 3, 2012) was a professional dancer, R & B singer and songwriter.\n\nBilly Lamont (sometimes spelled La Mont) was an Afro-American R&B singer whose death in 2012 passed unnoticed, apart from a mention in a local New Jersey newspaper. Biographical information about him on the Internet is virtually non-existent. The following is largely based on an interview with Dan Kochakian in Blues & Rhythm magazine during March 2001.\n\nMount Airy\n\nBorn Ray Pamade Denson , in Mount Airy, Surry County, North Carolina, he moved to Georgia at a young age and later to New Jersey, probably Irvington. He would remain a resident of the Garden State for the rest of his life. Ray was a very good dancer and started to dance professionally in 1951, taking on the professional name of Billy Lamont. His singing career started more or less by accident in 1956 when he was recruited as a last-minute replacement for H-Bomb Ferguson on a show that also featured Chuck Willis and Solomon Burke, among others.\n\nBy that time he had already written several songs and in 1957 he gave a tape of his songs to Arthur Candino who was an A&R man for Savoy Records. Candino liked what he heard and invited Lamont to do a session in New York City on July 25, 1957. Billy was a little nervous, as he had not been singing for very long and he was in awe of the session musicians, people like Sammy Price (piano) and Kenny Burrell (guitar). But it turned out well and \"I Got A Rock 'n' Roll Gal\"/\"I'm So Sorry\" was released in October, on Savoy 1522.\n\nIn December 1958 he released, “Tom Cat\"/\"Millie\", for the tiny Candelo label, with King Curtis on sax. This was followed by what some consider being his best rocker; the Little Richard- styled \"Country Boy\", with backing by the Upsetters. However, it was the slow flip-side that was promoted, \"Can't Make It By Myself\", which was in the style of Gene Allison's \"You Can Make It If You Try\". Allegedly, it was Billy's biggest seller, though it didn't make the national charts.\n\nA second OKeh single, \"I'm Gonna Try\"/\"Now Darling\" (1960) featured the same accompaniment: Grady Gaines and the Upsetters, the Gibraltars on backing vocals and arranger Robert Banks on piano. In June 1960, Billy did a one-off session for the King label, resulting in the single \"Hear Me Now\"/\"Come On Right Now\", the top side being a virtual clone of \"Bony Moronie\", but not as powerful.\n\nThe next time Lamont appeared on record, it was uncredited. In the wake of Chris Kenner's success with \"I Like It Like That\", Lloyd Price reissued a 1959 recording by Kenner, \"Don't Make No Noise\", on his Prigan label in September 1961. The flip-side, \"The Right Kind Of Girl\", was also credited to Chris Kenner, but was actually sung by Billy Lamont.\n\nIt wasn't until 1965 that Billy recorded again. \"Shake And Jerk\"/\"Girls, Girls, Girls\" was one of the first releases on the new Bang label, produced by Gene Redd. The same year \"So Called Friend\"/\"(Darlin') Please Come Home\" was released on Johnny Brantley's Bran-T label, in the soul style that was so popular in the mid- and late 1960s.\n\n\"(Zap! Pow!) Do the Batman\"/\"Do the Thing\" was recorded for Atlantic in January 1966 with Gate Wesley and his band, one of the first Batman records. Billy's final record in the 60’s was \"Sweet Thang\"/\"Please Don't Leave\" (20th Century Fox), released in 1968, but the backing track was already recorded in June 1966 with Jimi Hendrix on guitar.\n\nThe 1970s brought very few new releases by Lamont. \"Communications Is Where It's At, Parts 1 & 2” was credited to Billy the Baron & His Smokin Challangers, released in 1976. Probably Lamont's final release was the 12-inch maxi single \"The Man With the Master Plan\"/\"The Cowboy\", credited to Billy Lamont & the Unn Band, issued in 1980. After which he produced and recorded some gospel recordings for Jet Records, but it is not clear if these have been released. About the 1990s it is assumed that he had retired from the music scene by then.\n\nBilly Lamont died on June 3, 2012, at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, aged 82.\n\n(Edited from tims.blackcat.nl . The 2nd out of only two photographs of Lamont is taken from the cover of the Blues & Rhythm magazine where all his information was sourced)\n\nJimmy J. Hughes (April 25, 1935 – April1 -1997)* is an American former rhythm and blues singer, whose biggest successes in the mid-1960s, notably his hit \"Steal Away\", were important in the early development of the Muscle Shoals music industry.\n\nHughes, a cousin of Percy Sledge, was born and raised in Leighton, Alabama, close to Muscle Shoals. He began singing in a gospel quartet, The Singing Clouds, while at high school. In 1962, he auditioned for record producer Rick Hall at his FAME Studios. Hall was impressed, and recorded Hughes on a song, \"I'm Qualified\", that Hall had co-written with Quin Ivy. The record was leased to the Guyden label in Philadelphia, but was not a hit. Hughes returned to his day job at a rubber factory, and began singing secular R&B songs in local clubs.\n\nEarly in 1964, he returned to Hall with a powerful ballad he had written, \"Steal Away\", partly based on the gospel song \" Steal Away to Jesus\", and recorded the song in one take, backed by the studio rhythm section of guitarist Terry Thompson, keyboardist David Briggs, bassist Norbert Putnam and drummer Jerry Carrigan. Hall and his friend Dan Penn then promoted the record around radio stations in the South, and it rose to # 17 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe record has been cited as \"a prototype not only for subsequent great soul singers such as Johnnie Taylor and Al Green, but also would help define the signature Muscle Shoals sound.\"On the basis of Hughes' record, Hall signed a national distribution deal with Vee-Jay Records for his FAME label. Hughes' follow-up record, \"Try Me\", reached # 65 on the Hot 100, and he recorded an album, Steal Away, released on the Vee-Jay label, which included the first songwriting collaborations between Dan Penn and Spooner Oldham. He also toured with Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Bobby Womack and others.\n\nHughes' next few singles were unsuccessful, as Vee-Jay Records diverted their attention to The Beatles and The Four Seasons, and then folded. However, in 1966, after the success of Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman\", Hall negotiated a new deal for his label to be distributed by Atlantic Records. Hughes returned to the charts with \"Neighbor, Neighbor\" (# 65 pop, # 4 R&B), \"I Worship the Ground You Walk On\" (# 25 R&B), and \"Why Not Tonight\" (# 90 pop, # 5 R&B), before moving to the Atlantic label itself with \"It Ain't What You Got\" (# 43 R&B, 1968).\n\nEarly in 1968, Hughes moved to Stax Records, where his recordings were issued on the subsidiary Volt label. His first record for the label, \"I Like Everything About You\", reached # 21 on the R&B chart, but later records were less successful. At the time, Stax was undergoing a major reorganisation with new management and new artists. Although his records, including a 1969 album Something Special, were produced by label boss Al Bell, Hughes later stated that he felt like the \"low man on the totem pole\" at the label, and became frustrated by what he saw as a lack of promotion.\n\nHe also tired of touring and being away from his family, and in 1970 gave up recording and performing. He retrained, and got a government job making parts for nuclear power plants in the Tennessee River Valley, in later years only singing as a member of the congregation of his local church in Leighton.\n\n*Wikipedia gives date of birth as 3 February 1938 whereas most others give birth date as April 25, 1935, also one source gives the year 1934. Now this is where I have to tread carefully as whilst researching about Jimmy Hughes I have come across a great many web sites that report of his death from cancer on 1 April 1997, including Alabama Music Office, All Music Guide, Soulful Kinda Music, and “findagrave.com”. Yet Wikipedia state that reports of his death are incorrect. So if anyone can help me solve this mystery please do. (Edited from Wikipedia)\n\nSamuel Aaron Bell (April 24, 1921 - July 28, 2003) was an American jazz double-bassist.\n\nBell was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma. When he was a child, Bell's mother taught him to play the piano. In high school, he learned the trumpet and the tuba. Bell entered Xavier University in New Orleans in 1938 and was introduced to the bass violin, for which he showed an immediate and natural affinity that startled and impressed his teachers. Xavier bandmaster Allegretto Alexander assigned bassist Bell to both the university’s stage band and swing band.\n\nBell graduated in 1942 and spent the next four years in a U. S. Navy Band in Indiana. Immediately after being discharged from the Navy, Bell returned to Muskogee to teach music and take charge of the Manuel Training High School Concert and Marching Band, which he led to a championship at the all-state competition in Enid.\n\nThis career phase ended when Bell sat in with Andy Kirk’s Clouds of Joy band when it played in Tulsa. He toured with Kirk for a year, then entered New York University and earned his first Master’s degree, in music education, in 1951. He resumed performing, first with Teddy Wilson at the Embers Club in New York, then freelanced with such luminaries John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Lester Young , Stan Getz, J. J. Johnson, Lucky Millinder, Jimmy Lunceford, and Cab Calloway. He also led the Aaron Bell Trio, based at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills.\n\nIn 1960 Bell was offered a position in Duke Ellington's orchestra opposite drummer Sam Woodyard. He left Ellington's orchestra in 1962, and went on to play with Dizzy Gillespie before taking a series jobs on Broadway as a pit musician.\n\nEllington, Strayhorn & Bell\n\nHe served as bassist, arranger and pianist and conductor for Sammy Davis, Jr., then worked as staff bassist for the NBC studio orchestra, played numerous Broadway shows; and recorded frequently, scoring several albums in his own name for the MGM, RCA and Herald labels.\n\nBell was a resident artist at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York City from 1969 to 1972. At La MaMa, he wrote music for Ed Bullins' one-act plays, produced as Short Bullins in 1972, and for William Mackey's Family Meeting. His music for Bullins' plays also went on tour with the Jarboro Company, named after Caterina Jarboro and directed by Hugh Gittens, on their 1972 Italy tour. During this tour, the company performed Bullins' one-acts and Richard Wesley's Black Terror in Milan and Venice.\n\nBell gave a performance of his original compositions, including the pieces he wrote for those plays, on March 19, 1972, as part of the Music at La MaMa concert series. He also wrote the music for the Cotton Club Gala, which was originally produced at La MaMa in 1975.\n\nIn 1969, Bell joined the music faculty of Essex County College in Newark, New Jersey. His tenure there included more than 10 years as chair of the Performing Arts Department and a wide range of other responsibilities, including creating and the directorship of the instrumental and jazz program and serving as professor of theory, counterpoint, orchestration and jazz. Bell earned a second Master’s degree and Doctorate in theory and composition from Columbia University. He was considered the foremost academic authority on Ellington’s music.\n\nIn the 1980s, he returned to the piano. Bell retired from active performance in 1989 and died in 2003, at the age of 82, at the Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.\n\n(Edited from okjazz.org & Wikipedia)\n\nCharles Mingus Jr. (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American jazz double bassist, pianist, composer and bandleader.\n\nMusic was always considered important in the Mingus family. Growing up in the Watts section of Los Angeles, Mingus was exposed to classical music through the piano and violin lessons of his two older sisters. Mingus's parents bought him a trombone when he was eight years old, but he felt uncomfortable with the instrument and soon took up the cello, which he loved. He switched to the double bass--the instrument on which he would build his reputation--in high school, where his fellow orchestra members included future jazz stars Dexter Gordon and Chico Hamilton. During his late teens Mingus augmented his classroom studies with private lessons; his tutors included jazzmen Joe Comfort and Red Callender, as well as a former bassist with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Herman Rheinschagen.\n\nMingus's activity in the jazz scenes of Los Angeles and San Francisco began even before he graduated from high school. In 1940 he replaced his former teacher, Red Callender, in Lee Young's band; the following year he joined Louis Armstrong's organization, where he remained until 1943. As \"Baron Mingus\" he led various ensembles of his own, but it was as a member of Lionel Hampton's band that he began to revolutionize jazz bass playing with his highly charged, lightning-fast solos. Economic pressures prompted Mingus to briefly drop music for a job with the U.S. Postal Service until 1950, when vibraphonist Red Norvo invited him to be part of a trio that would also include guitarist Tal Farlow. The Red Norvo trio attracted national attention for introducing the West Coast's \"cool jazz\" to a wide audience.\n\nIn 1951 Mingus relocated to New York City, a hothouse of jazz creativity where he worked regularly with such musicians as Art Tatum, Bud Powell, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker. In 1953 he joined the band of his idol, Duke Ellington, but when a personality clash between Mingus and another band member led to a violent altercation, Mingus became one of the few musicians ever fired by Ellington. During the mid-1950s Mingus began to mature as a composer, modifying conventional forms by adding the startling rhythmic contrasts that would become his trademark. Some listeners found his music disturbing, but to others it was challenging and stimulating.\n\nMingus's energy led him to engage in many activities during the late 1950s, in addition to composing and upholding his reputation as one of the greatest soloists of all time. Angered by the unfair treatment meted out to musicians by major recording labels, Mingus established Debut Records in 1952. From 1953 to 1955, Mingus gave written contributions to the Jazz Composers Workshop, but in 1955 he founded his own workshop, based on his belief that written notation was not equal to his composing style.\n\nDuring the early 1960s Mingus experimented with free-form jazz and also wrote some of his most richly textured, rhythmically complex music, including such pieces as \"The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady\" and the album Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus Mingus. His influence on the young bass players of the day was incalculable, but, ironically, he gave up playing bass at this time. Instead he played piano, \"on which he resembled a watery Thelonious Monk,\" according to jazz critic Whitney Balliet in his book Such Sweet Thunder.\n\nMingus's behavior became increasingly erratic; frequently he ignored contracts, walked offstage early, or spent more time haranguing audiences about their ignorance and inattention than he did playing. Band members were routinely upbraided--even physically attacked--onstage for making mistakes or failing to show the proper attitude. Grappling with deep-seated psychological problems, Mingus dropped out of the music scene in the mid-1960s to concentrate on writing an autobiography. In 1968 he was evicted from his New York City apartment, and much of his written music was lost in that episode.\n\nWhen Mingus finally returned to music--and the bass--in June, 1969, he was motivated mainly by economic pressures. To his surprise he found himself accorded the status of an elder statesman. His stream-of-consciousness autobiography, Beneath the Underdog, was published in 1971, the same year he received a Guggenheim fellowship for composition. He became a part-time instructor at the State University of New York in Buffalo; wrote music for films; collaborated with singer Joni Mitchell on her tribute recording Mingus; and traveled extensively with his workshop. In 1974 Mingus organized what Leroy Ostransky, author of Understanding Jazz, deemed \"the greatest jam session since the expression was coined,\" which was recorded and released as Mingus at Carnegie Hall.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Mingus was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). His once formidable bass technique declined until he could no longer play the instrument. He died at the age of 56 on January 5, 1979\n\nin Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he had traveled for treatment and convalescence. His ashes were scattered in the Ganges River.
