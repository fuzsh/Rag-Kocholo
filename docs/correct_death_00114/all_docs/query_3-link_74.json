        "text": "And so love goes. And so life goes. And so I go.”\n\n“I see no greatness in my self…I’m a simple-minded, child-like, insipid sort of moronic and kind of awkward feeling adolescent.”\n\n-Neal Cassady on himself\n\nKorean War Vet Ken Babbs, captain of Ken Kesey’s “Trips Festival” bus, co piloting Neal Cassady on amphetamine at wheel rolling up highway to Millbrook estate near Poughkeepsie[sic] N.Y. where Dr. Tim Leary’s Castalia Foundation was then experimenting with D.M.T. on half-hour psychedelic trip useful for psychiatric sessions. Burglar Gordon Liddy, then assistant D.A. in Poughkeepsie raided the Foundation a number of times illegally lacking search warrants during that season, so Castalia folk were jittery on arrival of honking Day-glo graffiti’d “Merry Prankster” Further bus which’d been driven crosscountry S.F. to N.Y. via Texas before Fall 1964 Presidential, “A Vote For Goldwater is a vote for fun” logo painted above bus side windows, L.S.D. Kool-aid in pitcher in icebox. Kesey & Pranksters’d met with Jack Kerouac a day before, & set out to visit hero Leary first time, I went along, late summer 1964.\n\n– Allen Ginsberg c. Allen Ginsberg Estate\n\nTimothy Leary psychedelic research pioneer and Neal Cassady first meeting at Millbrook N.Y. in Ken Kesey-Merry Pranksters’ “Further” bus which Neal’d driven crosscountry S.F. to N.Y. via Texas before Fall 1964 presidential, with “A Vote For Goldwater is a Vote for Fun” logo painted large across bus side, L.S.D. cool-aid pitcher in icebox. Neal scratching amphetamine itch in his driver’s palm.”\n\n– Allen Ginsberg c. Allen Ginsberg Estate\n\nNeal Cassady & I went upstairs to attic at Millbrook estate Castalia Foundation big house where Timothy Leary and friends were then experimenting with DMT, a half hour trip – here Neal resting eyes closed with Millbrook lady friend (Susan Metzner, wife of Dr Ralph Metzner) in charge of holding the vile of liquid psychedelica. I’d driven upstate from New York City with Ken Kesey & Merry Pranksters in their day glo painted bus recently arrived East crosscountry from California, Neal at the wheel, Fall 1964.\n\n– Allen Ginsberg c. Allen Ginsberg Estate\n\nJack Kerouac and Neal Cassady\n\n“Rather, I think one should write, as nearly as possible, as if he were the first person on earth and was humbly and sincerely putting on paper that which he saw and experienced and loved and lost; what his passing thoughts were and his sorrows and desires.”\n\n-Neal Cassady to Jack Kerouac\n\nJack Kerouac (right) with Neal Cassady, circa 1952.\n\nPhotograph by Carolyn Cassady\n\nAllen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady\n\n“Neal is awareness, mine is consciousness. The consciousness is shallow, awareness is all embracing.”\n\n-Allen Ginsberg on Neal Cassady\n\n“What’s your road, man? -holyboy road, madman road, rainbow road, guppy road, any road. It’s an anywhere road for anybody anyhow.”\n\n-Neal Cassady as Dean Moriarty in On The Road\n\n“For Neal sex was the one and only holy and important thing in life.”\n\nJack Kerouac on Neal Cassady\n\n“Neal will leave you in the cold anytime it’s in his interest.”\n\nLuAnne Cassady (the 15 year old bride of Neal Cassady)\n\nabove quotes:\n\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/al/filosofy/beatquote.html"
