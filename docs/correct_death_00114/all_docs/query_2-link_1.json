        "text": "Mr. P.C. - Paul Chambers\n\n© - Steven A. Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\nOver the years, it seems to me that so much attention has been paid to Jimmy Blanton, Oscar Pettiford, Ray Brown, Charles Mingus, and Scott LaFaro for altering the Jazz bass landscape that Paul Chambers’ contributions in this regard have often been overlooked.\n\nPerhaps this is in part due to the fact that although Paul appeared on countless modern Jazz recordings from the mid-1950’s until his death in 1969, many of them of the highest significance as trend setters or statement makers in the music, he didn’t record that much or that often as a leader\n\nMost of what he did record under his own name was issued between 1956 and 1960, during Paul’s 9 year tenure with Miles Davis [1955-1963], and while all of them are deserving of greater attention, I thought I’d highlight four to provide a basis for this blog feature.\n\nEach of the four recordings is complimented by excellent insert notes which reveal a great deal about Paul’s background and the musicians and music who feature on these LPs.\n\nLet’s start with Leonard Feather’s always masterful and well-written annotations to Whims of Chambers: Paul Chamber Sextet [Blue Note 37647; CDP 7243 8 37647 2 3] which was recorded on September 21, 1956.\n\nGiven his background, I especially enjoy it when Leonard breaks down what’s going on in the music in terms of song structure, keys, chord progressions, meters, et al.\n\n“WHO shall silence all the airs and madrigals that whisper softness in chambers?”\n\n—John Milton\n\nUnless Milton was uncannily prescient when he quilled the above line it is unlikely that he was referring specifically to Paul Chambers. Nor were the airs and madrigals he had in mind as complex or as stimulating as Whims of Chambers or Tale of the Fingers. But Milton's question seems opposite, for on these sides we find not only softness and subtlety in Chambers but also a strong, virile instrumental voice that cannot and shall not be silenced; a sound that must and will command attention during the coming years wherever jazz is heard.\n\nThe role of the jazz bass player was largely a metronomic assignment until, in 1939, Jimmy Blanton's flight through time and space, when he alighted in the Duke Ellington airport, transformed the entire scene. Since that time scores of talented men have put hundreds of fingers to work proving that Blanton was right; that the bass is capable of melodic invention and rhythmic variety unknown before his day.\n\nOscar Pettiford is the man generally assumed to have inherited the Blanton mantle, though Ray Brown, Red Mitchell, Percy Heath and a few more have exhibited formidable prowess and extraordinary heights of inspiration. And now, to join the handful of giants of whom one can speak in the same breath as these few, the inner jazz circle has welcomed Paul Laurence Dunbar Chambers Jr.\n\nAmong other achievements Chambers can claim to be the first jazzman to earn dual renown as an arco and pizzicato bass soloist. Born in Pittsburgh April 22, 1935, he entered music through a windy side entrance when he and several schoolmates were fingered to take up music and the baritone horn became his assignment. Later he took up the tuba. \"I got along pretty well, but it's quite a job to carry it around in those long parades, and I didn't like the instrument that much.\" [Besides, you can't bow a tuba.) So Paul became a string bassist, around 1949 in Detroit, where he had been living for a while since the death of his mother.\n\nPlaying his first gig at one of the little bars in the Hastings Street area, he was soon doing club jobs with Thad Jones, Barry Harris and others who have since effected the Detroit-New York junction. His formal bass training got going in earnest in 1952, when he began taking lessons with a bassist in the Detroit Symphony. Paul did some \"classical\" work himself, with a group called the Detroit String Band that was, in effect, a rehearsal symphony orchestra. Studying at Cass Tech, off and on from 1952 to '55, he played in Cass' own symphony, and in various other student groups, one of which had him blowing baritone sax. By the time he left for New York at the invitation of [tenor saxophonist] Paul Quinichette, he had absorbed a working knowledge of several armfuls of instruments.\n\nThe Quinichette job was Paul's first time on the road. Since then he has worked with Benny Green's combo; at the Bohemia in New York with George Wellington's quintet; at the Embers and Birdland with Joe Roland; and on several jobs with the since-split trombone twins, JJ. Johnson and Kai Winding. For the past 18 months most of his working hours have been devoted to the furnishing of a solid understructure for Miles Davis, and it was with the help of two colleagues from Miles' combo (John Coltrane and Philly Joe Jones) that the present LP gained much of its power and conviction.\n\nPaul was about 15 when he started to listen to Bird and Bud, his first jazz influences. Oscar Pettiford and Ray Brown, the first bassists he admired, were followed in his book by Percy Heath, Milton Hinton and Wendell Marshall for their rhythm section work,Charles Mingus and George Duvivier for their technical powers and for their efforts in broadening the scope of jazz bass. Blanton, of course, is his all-time favorite, the perennial poll winner in his ballot.\n\nSpeaking of polls, a review of the last Down Beat critics' referendum shows that Paul won in the New Star bassist category by a comfortable margin with 85 points. (This means that 8 1/2 critics voted for him — one critic, initials L.F., betrayed a split personality.) And now, with that honor in the bag, Paul has something new to crow about: his first Blue Note LP as a leader.\n\nDonald Byrd, whose horn plays a meaty role in the sextet, is a 24-year-old Detroiter who, like Paul, studied at Cass Tech. and worked in the Wallington Quintet; for a while he was a Messenger in Art Blakey's service.\n\nJohn Coltrane, a native of Hamlet, N.C., is 30, was raised in Philadelphia and has a background of assignments in rhythm and blues groups, Earl Bostic, Eddie Vinson, as well as with the jazz outfits of Johnny Hodges, Gillespie, Miles.\n\nPaul's partners in the rhythm team include Horace Silver, Blue Note's adopted son; Kenny Burrell, another Detroiter and recent addition to the Blue Note family (his own LP is 1523), and the indomitable Philadelphia Joseph Jones, Blue Note alumnus of dates with Elmo Hope, Lou Donaldson et. al.\n\nOmicron, named by Donald Byrd for a Greek letter but framed along modern American lines with a Woody 'n You chassis, has a fascinating introduction and coda written in 6/8 as well as solo expenses by Silver, Burrell and the horns, and some estimable Chambers pizzicato. Whims of Chambers is a charming blues played by Paul and Kenny in octave unison, dedicated to the rhythm section, of which all four members acquit themselves superbly on the solo passages. Coltrane's Nita has an interesting pattern; at the 23rd measure of each chorus it goes into six bars of suspended rhythm followed by a two-bar break. When the unison horns take over after the drum solo you may, on first hearing, wonder how they knew when to come in; which only proves that Philly Joe cannot be fully dug at one hearing.\n\nWe Six has Coltrane showing his big, bulging tone on a minor Byrd theme. Coltrane is the living reminder of the existence of more than one way to get a big sound on tenor, for at no time, in tone or in style, could he be mistaken for a disciple of the Coleman Hawkins school. Paul has one of his amazingly fluent bowed solos here, after which Kenny and Horace both get in a good smooth groove.\n\nDear Ann, after a pretty chord-style guitar intro, shows Byrd in the medium-slow theme, named for Mrs. Chambers (Paul, married four years, has produced Eric, 3 and Renee, 2 and expects the former to start climbing up the bass any day now for his first solo chorus.) Dear Ann shows the Chambers pizzicato at its most agile and fertile.\n\nTale of the Fingers is our favorite track, if we may be personal. Based on the Strike Up the Band chord sequence, it opens with four choruses of bowed bass, and never before have there been 128 measures even remotely like this. Horace is in there wailing too, and later Philly Joe trades some fours with \"The Bow\" before Paul takes over solo for the finale, but frankly, it is difficult to recall anything that happens after those first choruses, because anything that followed them would necessarily have been anticlimactic. I would call Chambers a gas, except that it is depressing to think about gas chambers; so perhaps a bolder word may be permitted. Chambers, as his fellow-musicians have been saying ever since they heard his very first solo, is a bitch.\n\nJust for the Love, a Coltrane line, is built in 12-bar sequences but uses changes somewhat removed from the conventional blues routine. Tenor, piano, trumpet, guitar, pizzicato bass and drums (i.e. the entire sextet) can be heard individually in that order.\n\nIt may not be long before Pittsburgh and Detroit start a fight about which city can claim Paul Chambers as a hometown boy. He's a valuable enough man on anyone's team to generate just such a squabble and these sides. I'm sure you'll agree, offer the most eloquent evidence to date.”\n\n—Leonard Feather\n\nEarlier in 1956, Paul had been on The Left Coast and recorded one of the dozen LPs ever issued on Herbert Kimmel’s Jazz West label. Entitled Chambers Music [JWLP: 7], here are Herb’s notes to that session. It’s particularly great fun to read about his reference to “Philadelphia Joe Jones” more commonly known as Philly Joe Jones or even Philly JJ.\n\nCHAMBERS' MUSIC [JAZZ WEST JWLP: 7]\n\nA JAZZ DELEGATION FROM THE EAST\n\nPAUL CHAMBERS, bass; PHILADELPHIA JOE JONES, drums JOHN COLTRANE, tenor saw; KENNY DREW, piano\n\n“When he was a teenager in Detroit, Paul Chambers was called \"Stringbean\" by his friends. Paul didn't tell me this himself, it came out by accident in a conversation which took place between sets at San Francisco's Blackhawk when one of Chambers' Detroit pals dropped in to chat about old times. Of course, if you're only twenty years old like Paul, \"old times\" means a few years ago. Each year is like a century, considering all the activity it spans.\n\nThe \"stringbean\" appellation seems to fit him even now. Where other bass plays have to peek around the sides of their giant fiddles to be seen, Paul finds it easier to look down over the top. His height undoubtedly is an asset for a musician who plays so large an instrument. This is especially noticeable when Paul plays a solo with his bow, holding it as easily as a toothpick and wielding it as delicately as a rapier. This ability to bow convincing jazz is what really distinguishes Paul Chambers from the rest of the field of plucking bass players. While the ability to play pizzicato bass swingingly is not to be sneezed at, the added attraction of a solo which offers the listener an opportunity to hear appropriately placed legato notes and figures along with the clipped ones makes Chambers' work an absolute must for jazz fans.\n\nPaul's background is already well known. He placed sixteenth in Down Beat's poll last year (1955). He has worked with Paul Quinichette's group in several cities (including a stop at New York's Birdland); also, he has worked with Benny Green and Sonny Stitt. His most recent job — which brought him to the west coast — is with the Miles Davis Quintet.\n\nPhiladelphia Joe Jones:\n\nThere is unanimous agreement among Los Angeles jazz citizens that Joe Jones is the best jazz drummer to visit this city since Max Roach was here last year. Since his first appearance with Tadd Dameron at the Royal Roost in New York (in the jazz-history-making year of 1946), he has worked with many of the great stars of the past ten years: Ben Webster, Kai Winding, J.J., Sonny Stitt, and, most recently, Miles Davis. His role in the Davis band is that of swinging anchor for Miles' wandering horn; the competence with which he performs this role in more than slightly responsible for Miles' recent resurgence.\n\nJohn Coltrane:\n\n“Train\" first played big-time jazz with Dizzy Gillespie in 1950. Since then he has worked with several New York and Philadelphia groups; his tenor saxophone currently blends into Miles Davis' Quintet. His work in the Davis group is noteworthy for the many driving solos he contributes and for his ability to obtain a faraway, whispery sound at times, complementing the detachment of Miles' horn very effectively.\n\nKenny Drew:\n\nKenny's most recent album on jazz:west (JWLP-4) with [alto saxophonist] Joe Maini is the fourth LP under the Drew name. Also, his quintet and arrangements can be heard supporting the vocals of Jane Fielding in another jazz:west album (JWLP-5). Before these recent efforts Kenny worked with Buddy DeFranco, Dexter Gordon, Benny Carter, Sonny Criss, the late Wardell Gray, and other West Coast stars. Currently, he is traveling with Dinah Washington's jazz troupe.”\n\n— Herbert Kimmel\n\nThis music was recorded in March of 1956 at Western Recorders in Hollywood. Don Blake was the engineer. In order to pick up the complete range of Paul Chambers' bass, two microphones were employed for that instrument alone. One was attached to the tail-piece of the instrument, while the other was placed immediately in front of the sound holes. The following tunes were recorded:\n\nTRACK:\n\n1. DEXTERITY {Charlie Parker) 6:45\n\n2. STABLEMATES (Benny Golson) 5:53\n\n3. EASY TO LOVE (Cole Porter) 3:52\n\n4. VISITATION (Paul Chambers) 4:54\n\n5. JOHN PAUL JONES (John Coltrane) 6:54\n\n6. EASTBOUND (Kenny Drew) 4:21\n\nPhotographs taken at the recording session by William Claxton. The entire production of this album was supervised by Herbert Kimmel.\n\nJAZZ: WEST Records, 535Z West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles 19, California\n\nCopyright 1956 by Jazz: West Records\n\nA few years after this native Detroiter recorded in New York and Los Angeles, respectively, he made his next two recordings in Chicago for the VeeJay, a Chicago-based label that was important because it gave a number of young musicians a platform to record their music before they went on to greater fame and fortune including Paul, Lee Morgan, and Wayne Shorter. It also supported the locally based Jazz groups like the MJ2+3 [headed up by drummer Walter Perkins and pianist Harold Maybern], [alto saxophonist] Frank Strozier and [pianists] Ramsey Lewis and Eddie Higgins.\n\nFortunately these VeeJay recordings.COMPILED & REISSUED ON CD BY JORDI PUJOL (FRESH SOUND RECORDS)\n\n1st Bassman, as the VJ-004 catalogue number implies was one of the earliest issues for the label and its features Paul along with a terrific line-up of Tommy Turrentine on trumpet, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Yusef Lateef on tenor sax with Wynton Kelly on piano and Lex Humphries on drums rounding out the rhythm section. The six tracks that comprise the album are all original compositions by Yusef.\n\nThe notes are by Barbara Gardner a Chicago-based writer just making her mark with contributions to Downbeat at this time.\n\n“Every Chamber of Commerce in America believes it has something to crow about in its city. Pittsburgh has steel, Milwaukee has beer. Grinders Switch has Minnie Pearl and Detroit shouts about its cars. Yet Detroit, each year pours into the mainstream of American culture an unsung export - the emerging, revitalizing jazz musician. The flow is steady, reliable and unpretentious and Detroit accepts it as a common, secondary product. Yet, there has been nothing either common or secondary about the national and world acceptance of Detroit's jazzmen and their contribution towards keeping jazz a forward-moving, progressive art form. In 1959 and early 1960 most of the leading big bands and combos had at least one Detro-ite in the ranks. Count Basie, Miles Davis, the Modern Jazz Quartet, the Jazztet and the Adderley Quintet, to name a few, all owed a debt to Detroit.\n\nThe entire musically prolific Jones family is a Detroit contribution. Brothers pianist Hank, drummer Elvin, and trumpeter Thad are among the jazzmen most in demand. Bernard McKinney, trombonist; tenor man Yusef Lateef; trombonist Curtis Fuller; young trumpeter Donald Byrd; the Adderley pianist Barry Harris; Alvin Jackson and his brother, vibes player, Milt - all these active musicians are products from the jazz assembly line in the Motor City.\n\nAnd then there is Paul Chambers. Had Detroit nothing more to its credit than the musical spawning and nursing of Chambers, then the contribution would have been a worthy one.\n\n\"The bass has been buried in the rhythm section of jazz groups too long. It is high time someone devoted his career to the great melodic and emotional potential of this instrument.\" These words must have been uttered by the often-quoted Mr. Somebody Sometimes and he might just as well have directed his wish to Paul Chambers, for in 1954, Chambers picked up this specific challenge and since that time, the jazz bass instrument has never been the same.\n\nAs a solid, rock-rooted swinger, Paul Chambers is unquestionably to be regarded in awe and wonder. He is Foundation Personified in the rhythm section; keeper of the beat; coordinator of the pulsating background to which the soloists vibrate.\n\nAs a soloist, he is imaginative and adventurous. Never satisfied to merely \"walk\" and \"stroll\" (commendable attributes when well executed) Chambers urges his bass to skip and gallop unafraid on foreign soil.\n\nIt is to be expected that Chambers should record an album of original tunes. The moods, effects and interpretations are interesting and varied. This album contains elements of departure and experimentation. Yet there is enough of the familiar swinger still remaining.\n\nIf you have ever wondered what Paul Chambers would do if he were free to choose his men and his tunes, you have your first answer here.”\n\n— BARBARA J GARDNER\n\nPaul Chambers - GO! [VeeJay VJ-017]COMPILED & REISSUED on CD BY JORDI PUJOL (FRESH SOUND RECORDS) is graced with the following notes by Dick Martin, Station WWL, New Orleans\n\n\"The most talented new bassist to enter the jazz scene in recent years.\" That is the opinion of critics and jazz men alike - and offered by the time Paul Chambers was barely twenty-one. Born Paul Laddwrence Dunbar Chambers, Jr. in Pittsburgh, in 1935, he started his professional career when only fourteen, playing baritone horn and tuba around Detroit with Kenny Burrell and other combos\n\nHe left Detroit with \"The Vice-Prez\" - Paul Quinichette, and worked with him for about eight months. Subsequently, in 1955, he was heard with the combos of Benny Green, Joe Roland, J J Johnson and Kai Winding, George Wellington, and Miles Davis - with whom he played through most of 1956. His favorite bassists are ex-Ellingtonian the late Jimmy Blanton and cellist-bassist Oscar Pettiford.\n\nAJto saxophonist Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley is also proficient on tenor, clarinet, flute and trumpet. Such versatility between reed and brass instruments, though not too common, lies in the fact that he studied brass and reed instruments in high school in Tallahassee from 1944 to 1948... at which time he formed his first jazz group. Upon graduation he become band director at Dillard High School in Ft. lauderdale. During this time (from 1948-1950) he also had his own jazz group in south Florida. He become leader of the 36th Army Dance Band while serving in the Army from 1950-'52; led another Army band at Ft. Knox from '52-'53. \"Cannonball\" first attracted attention in the musical \"pro\" circuit when he sat in with Oscar Pettiford at Cafe Bohemia in New York City in the summer of 1955; and almost immediately was signed by one of the major jazz labels. In the spring of '56 he and his brother Nat started touring with their own combo.\n\nThe nickname \"Cannonball\" evolved from \"Cannibal\" a name given him by high school colleagues in tribute to his vast eating capacity. His favorite alto-saxophonists ore the late Charlie Parker and Benny Carter so it's not surprising that he sounds much like the former on up-tempo numbers and like Carter on ballads. With his advent on the professional scene he was considered the outstanding new alto saxophonist by musicians and critics alike; and since then has gleaned a following that is legion.\n\nOn the four selections in which trumpet was used the nod went to Freddie Hubbard a young man from Indianapolis, Indiana who is currently working with Sonny Rollins... and who, for the past few months, has enjoyed the acceptance of John Coltrane as well.\n\nPianist Wynton Kelly was brought to this country from his native Jamaica at the age of four He was playing professionally when only eleven; and when he was fifteen went on a Caribbean lour with the Ray Abrams Octet. He worked mostly in the rhythm and blues field for the next few years; and was accompanist to Dinah Washington for three years. He was a member of the Dizzy Gillespie combo when only twenty-one years old. His musical versatility is demonstrated by the fact that he not only plays mostly modern piano, but has also played organ for Sunday mass in his church in Brooklyn.\n\nThe talented \"Philly Joe\" Jones is the drummer on \"Awful Mean\"; the balance of the drumming chores fell to Jimmy Cobb who has also worked with Dinah Washington, Cannonball's old group, and with Miles Davis.\n\nIn \"AWFUL MEAN\" Philly Joe's ominous drum roll brings on the four-man firing squad for this moderate-tempoed blues, the pace for which is set by Chambers' bass. The melody, as laid down by \"Cannonball\" in the first chorus, hits the musical mark with the devastation of Birdshot. The mood is funky; and solos by Wynton Kelly, then Adderley, are followed by the leader's 'coup de grace', using a bow rather than the traditional 45 just to make sure, Philly Joe adds some tasty sharpshooting of his own.\n\nAfter a unison first chorus on the old favorite \"JUST FRIENDS\", Hubbard, Kelly, Adderley and Chambers solo in that order for two choruses apiece. Paul's agility in bowing on this up-tempo swinger is remarkable; and Jimmy Cobb drives and punctuates well throughout One has the feeling that here are close \"aficionados,\" rather than \"just friends\"...\n\n\"JULIE ANN\" (named for a daughter in the Adderley household, perhaps?] is a fast waltz, but often with a cross-rhythm 4/4 feel to it. Paul is pizzicato on this one, soloing first followed by Freddie and the composer in turn. It's a pretty melody which everyone apparently enjoyed playing as evidenced by a fade at the end, rather than a definite close-out.\n\n\"THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE\" finds the quartet in a relaxed mood and at a moderate tempo; and if you have eyes to dance about now, this is your meat. Paul walks his bass with authority.\n\nDespite the boppish syncopation reminiscent of the late '40s of the first and ride-out choruses, the blend of Hubbard's muted trumpet and Cannonball's alto in lower register than when he is soloing brings to mind the precision and sound of another group under the aegis of a stellar bass man of twenty years or so ago, John Kirby. The phrasing of Charlie Shavers and Russell Procope in the Kirby group was less abrupt, of course, but the sound and attack were most similar to what we hear in Paul's composition, \"EASE IT.\"\n\nGershwin's 1930 hit \"I GOT RHYTHM\" (from the show \"Girl Crazy'} is a flag-waving finale with a pace that brings to bear on the dexterity and fluid drive of all concerned. Jimmy Cobb boots things along and solos more extensively than heretofore.”\n\n\"Moon Glow with Martin\", Dick Martin, Station WWL, New Orleans\n\nRecording Supervised by SID McCOY.\n\nAs of this writing, the editorial staff at JazzProfiles is awaiting a copy of Rob Palmer’s Mr. P.C.: The Life and Music of Paul Chambers from Equinox Press.

As we have seen the cost of moving such a large group of men about the world was high, and there were also hidden payouts that Herman had to make over the years as a result of confusion over managerial contracts — often he found himself paying two groups of people for the same service. Always an honourable man with the highest reputation, he was sometimes stricken with less than efficient management, and the resultant financial problems tended to emerge after the perpetrator of them had left. The low point of such matters occurred when the police came to see him backstage at the Newport Jazz festival as the result of his manager's failure to settle a long standing bill with a local bus company.\n\nAll these costs added up, and what was left emphasised the historical fact that being a sideman in a big band on the road is not the best paid job. The musicians had to settle their own hotel bills in addition to the expense of running their homes. This led to a high turnover in the ranks, with men constantly quitting when they found jobs at home.\n\nBut there were advantages in the shifting personnel. Once more Herman tapped a continuing and remarkable lode of young players, as well as attracting returning veterans like Carl Fontana and Sal Nistico. Trumpeter Bill Byrne joined in late 1963 and has stayed for two decades so far. Youngsters of the finest kind, jazz stars of the future once again proliferated in the ranks — saxophonists Bob Pierson, Frank Vicari, Al Gibbons, Roger .Neumann, Joe Romano were all great tenor soloists and dazzling technicians. Joe Temperley from Scotland had new things to say in his hard driving baritone sax style, part Harry Carney, part Temperley. He was eventually succeeded by the great bebop veteran Cecil Payne. Young Bill Watrous joined the returning Henry Southall and veteran Bob Burgess in the trombones, and the tasteful and inventive pianist Al Dailey joined in 1967. The band starred at that year's Monterey Festival and recorded Bill Holman's prodigious suite Concerto For Herd, a masterpiece spoiled by poor recording quality. Woody played soprano on The Horn of The Fish, another Holman composition. He came to the instrument after hearing John Coltrane play it in a club one night. Next day Woody went out and bought one, quickly mastering the awkward beast — although it had been made easier to play since the days when only Sidney Bechet and Johnny Hodges could cope with it. The Monterey set was recorded for Verve. Woody had left CBS earlier that year and in 1968 signed lor the Chess company, tor whom he appeared on their Cadet label.\n\nAlways ready to explore new ideas, the band followed the rush into electronic rhythm sections and the blending of traditional Herman brass and reed sections with electric piano, bass and guitar dismayed some of the older fans but, in the traditional line of Herman philosophy, brought in the young audience to whom the rock beat was the key to unlock the music.\n\nThe band recorded a group of pop songs of the day as their first contribution to Cadet, and the album was issued under the title Light My Fire. The Monterey band had by this time, October 1968, given way to an almost completely new line up. Ex-Blakey Messengers pianist John Hicks teamed with drummer Ed Soph in the rhythm section. Soph was to be another recurrent Hermanite. The trumpets blasted McArthur Park and Sal Nistico was wreathed with echo for Hush, the Deep Purple number. Woody featured on a delicate outsider, Impression Of Strayhorn.\n\nBill Chase returned to the trumpets in time for the next Cadet album, Heavy Exposure when Donny Hathaway on organ and two extra percussionist were added to the band. Nistico and Chase fought their way through it all and Bob Burgess played some good improvisations over the new style rhythm. But the good charts were weighted down by that very heavy section.\n\nHelp was at hand, and three remarkable young musicians once more appeared to change the direction the band took — trumpeters Tony Klatka and Bill Stapleton and the brilliant young New Zealander, Alan Broadbent. Broadbent was a most imaginative and skilful arranger and although he didn't stay long as the band's pianist, he contributed a string of fine arrangements to the Herd over the years. He wrote all but one of the arrangements on an album called simply Woody and they included a remarkable fourteen minute reworking of Blues in the Night which displayed Alan, Sal Nistico and Tony Klatka as soloists.\n\nBy the time Woody signed for the Fantasy label in 1972, Harold Danko had charge of the electric piano and Tom Anastas, who had been with the band on baritone in the sixties, returned. Greg Herbert and Frank Tiberi were on tenors, and both were to be major soloists in the ensuing years, with Tiberi taking charge of Woody's instruments (Woody rarely warms up and Frank's job, in addition to keeping the horns in good repair, included wetting the reeds and handing the horns to Woody as he walked on stage). The first album was The Raven Speaks mixing pop music with jazz, and producing traditional blues shout ups and a reworking of Herbie Hancock's Watermelon Man which for some reason became entitled Sandia Chicano.\n\nThe second album for Fantasy, the 1973 Giant Steps, saw the band firmly back on a jazz path with a set of dazzling arrangements by Stapleton, Broadbent and Klatka. Jim Pugh, a young trombonist in the best Herman tradition, played lead and took poised and supple solos, while Andy Laverne took over the keyboards. Laverne brought a new concept to the electronics, widening the sound colours without compromising the music, and at last the rhythm meshed properly with the horns. He lashed the band along on Chick Corea's La Fiesta, which also used Greg Herbert on piccolo along with Tiberi on tenor and Woody's soprano. Pugh played a thoughtful Meaning Of The Blues and Broadbent had one of his most inventive compositions recorded in BeBop And Roses, an imposing exercise in retrospection. The title track, originally a juggernaut exercise for composer John Coltrane, emerged as a chase for Tiberi and Herbert, finally confirming their abilities as outstanding soloists.\n\nColtrane was represented again on the Thundering Herd album from 1974 when Klatka arranged the haunting Naima and Stapleton did Trane's Lazy Bird. Klatka also wrote the fine Blues For Poland recorded at this session and featuring in addition to Laverne and the composer, the excellent Czech baritone saxist Jan Konopasek.\n\nPoland continued to attract Woody and he returned there in 1976 with a band crammed with prodigious stars. Pugh, Tiberi and Byrne were still there, with Tiberi now playing bassoon to add to tenor and flute. Alongside him was tenorist Gary Anderson, who wrote some formidable charts for the library. A new source of sidemen suddenly opened up. In 1975 Herman had played a jazz festival in Wichita and had heard a trio composed of students from the North Texas State University. This comprised Lyle Mays on keyboards, Kirby Stewart on bass and drummer Steve Houghton. Woody was most impressed and, since he had decided he needed to change the whole attitude of the rhythm section in the band, he took the trio on en bloc.\n\n'It turned out to be a good thing for the school,' bassist Marc Johnson told the author. 'Whenever any of the guys left Woody's rhythm section, they would recommend someone else from North Texas, so we had an open channel to the rhythm section.'\n\nMarc himself eventually joined Woody. 'It was another gradient in my career, because the level of consistency which was demanded of you was quite remarkable. Later, when I joined the Bill Evans Trio, I found the experience with Woody indispensable. I couldn't have done the gig with Bill if it hadn't been for that. Woody's book is so diverse. There are so many styles and idioms that you're asked to play, and to play well, that it's a real challenge. You had to master swing from the forties and the contemporary rock beat and at the same time bend to fit in with such a large group of musicians.'\n\nBack from Europe, the band returned to Carnegie Hall on 20 November 1976 to celebrate Woody's 40th anniversary as a bandleader. It had taken Woody and his manager Hermie Dressel three months to organise the concert, and a representative selection of the hundreds of ex Herdsmen appeared along with the contemporary band. Nat Pierce sat in for his chart of Apple Honey, joined by Flip Phillips, Jim Pugh, Phil Wilson, Pete Candoli and Don Lamond, and backed Flip on Sweet And Lovely. The Four Brothers were Jimmy Giuffre, Stan Getz, Al Cohn and Zoot Sims, and Mary Ann McCall was there to recreate Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams with Nat. Bill Harris was commemorated as Jim Pugh played Everywhere and Phil Wilson Bijou. Getz was as elegant as ever with Early Autumn, Blue Serge and Blue Getz Blues with Ralph Burns on piano for Autumn. Cohn, Giuffre and Getz were backed by pianist Jimmy Rowles on Cousins and the Candoli brothers shared the Klatka chart of Brotherhood Of Man. The young Herd was on good form, and contributed two more recent hits, Broadbent's Blues In The Night chart and Gary Anderson's rock-propelled version of Copeland's Fanfare for The Common Man, even more inspiring in Woody's version, dare it be said, than in Copeland's original! This was an emotional occasion, as one might imagine, and fortunately it was captured for posterity on record. Woody was so carried away that he even forgot to play Woodchopper's Ball.\n\nFour months later, in March 1977, came a dreadful contrast to the anniversary. Woody was driving through Kansas when he fell asleep at the wheel and collided with an oncoming car. His injuries were so serious that there were fears for his life, and it seemed out of the question that he would ever lead the band again. Apart from injuries to his body, one of his legs was horribly mangled. As the anxious weeks went by he showed his resilience and his life was no longer in danger. When the weeks turned to months his determination to pull through had him moving gingerly with the help of a walker, and then, incredibly, in late 1977, he was not only back with the band, but the walker became a familiar sight all over Europe as he led the band on tour.\n\nAt the beginning of 1978 the band recorded for Century with a galaxy of guest arrangers including Chick Corea, Vic Feldman, Ralph Burns and regulars Stapleton, Anderson and Broadbent, and at the same time cut an album of ballads featuring Flip Phillips on tenor with an added string section.\n\nBy now the Monterey Festival was almost synonymous with Herman's name. The roots of the band had really been on the California coast since Woody made his home there in the forties. Los Angeles was full of off-the-road Herdsmen — Nat Pierce, Bill Berry, Bill Perkins, Shorty Rogers, the Candolis, and in addition there was a pool of brilliant young musicians who worked in the Hollywood studios.\n\nBig bands of a very high standard proliferated in the city, led by Frankie Capp and Nat Pierce, Bill Berry, Roger Neumann, Bill Holman, Bob Florence and many others. But these were static, not touring bands like the Herd.\n\nUp north in Concord, wealthy entrepreneur Carl Jefferson had been developing a fine jazz record label as well as his flourishing automobile business. He had issued albums by the best of the West Coast musicians, restricting himself firstly to small groups. But he was anxious to start a big band catalogue, and was fortunate to find the Frankie Capp-Nat Pierce Juggernaut and the Bill Berry LA Big Band more or less on his doorstep. His issues by these bands were immensely successful, with Juggernaut's first album topping the polls in Europe for many months.\n\nTo the Berry and Capp-Pierce bands it must have seemed that they were on their way to international status. But fate had it that Nat's old boss had left Fantasy and didn't have a record company. Jefferson moved in surely to begin a lasting and, in Herman terms, very important association between Woody and Concord. Berry and Capp-Pierce were caught in the backwash and there were no more albums from them as Woody's became the house band. Jefferson was obviously determined to promote his new star properly and the albums the band made added top guest stars, and Woody fronted other groups made up from local stars or former sidemen. With no expense spared in production and the band maintaining its normal high standards the albums could hardly fail.\n\nThe first one was done on 15 September 1979 at Monterey. In a remarkable example of hedging his bet, Jefferson recorded Getz, Dizzy Gillespie, Slide Hampton and Woody Shaw with the band with Getz as bewitching as ever in the Broadbent chart What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life? But the band was not outshone by the guests, and Frank Tiberi had another Coltrane tune, Countdown, in an arrangement with Frank and Bob Belden on tenors. Dave Lalama, the band's pianist, also followed in the tradition of pianist-arrangers and featured with Woody and baritone Gary Smulyan on Duke's I Got It Bad, which Dave had arranged. Slide Hampton arranged two of Dizzy's compositions, Woody 'n' You and Manteca to feature the composer and guests along with drummer Ed Soph.\n\nWhile the recording side of things went well, the touring band business was very much in decline as the eighties began and even the perennial Count Basie, by now doyen of the bandleaders, was feeling the pinch. As the 'name' leaders of the sixties and seventies parked their buses, Woody cleverly switched the emphasis of the band's work to schools and from the late seventies on as much as 80 per cent was in teaching clinics at colleges throughout America. Woody had initially been persuaded into this field by Stan Kenton, who so imaginatively developed the idea of a jazz clinic. Woody quickly grew to love this kind of work and found that it was good for both the students and the men in the band. It was also financially rewarding and was vital in keeping the Herd together. At that same 1979 Monterey Festival he led a contingent from the California All-Star High School band. A portfolio of 27 of the Herd's arrangements was produced for use in the clinics.\n\nBut still costs rose inexorably. The band had to earn $18,000 a week just to keep its head above water, and although the sidemen were making between $300 and $450 a week, expenses on the road had to come out of that.\n\nMuch of the strain was taken off Woody by his expert manager Hermie Dressel, and Bill Byrne took care of the road manager's headaches. Woody paced himself sensibly and tried to keep the overnight hops to under 400 miles. He still had pain from his accident, although he claimed to have got used to the clank of the steel rod supporting the various fractures in his leg.\n\nWith some fanfare the Herman band took over a club in New Orleans in which Woody had an interest. The idea was for the band to be permanently resident there, and indeed the Chopper was justly honoured by being made King Of The Zulus at the Mardi Gras celebrations. But the venture began as the world recession deepened, and the idea was not a success.\n\nBack on the West Coast, Jefferson pressed ahead with his ideas for Woody, and shifted his outdoor recordings to his own Concord Festival. In 1981 he brought him back to head a group which included two former Herman stars, Jake Hanna and Dave McKenna along with Dick Johnson, Cal Tjader and youngsters Scott Hamilton, Cal Collins, Warren Vache and Bob Maize. Oddly enough the presence of Japanese clarinettist Eiji Kitamura on this session emphasised the heat and potency of Herman's playing and showed once again what a fine jazz soloist he was and is. In July of that year Woody flew to New York for a session with half a dozen old timers from the Herd. This was a four tenor front line with Al Cohn, Sal Nistico, Bill Perkins, Flip Phillips, John Bunch, George Duvivier and Don Lamond. The music was vigorous and energetic with a tasteful selection of early hits including Tiny's Blues, Four Others, Not Really the Blues and The Goof And I, along with a fine new Cohn composition, Woody's Lament. In such bustling company Woody restricted himself to playing alto on Tenderly. It was notable, as was confirmed in succeeding years, that Flip Phillips's playing was getting better and better.\n\nStan Getz and Al Cohn returned to guest with the band at the 1982 Concord Festival, and by now there was another new and splendid pianist/arranger, John Oddo, who wrote four of the compositions on the subsequent Concord album and arranged most of the others. Bill Holman contributed Midnight Run which featured Woody, Bill Stapleton on flugelhorn and a new ebullient character on trumpet, George Rabbai. Bill also wrote the band arrangement of The Dolphin to showcase Getz. Lemon Drop reappeared after many years with Rabbai singing the bop vocal and Cohn particularly on form. New names and good soloists abounded as usual — John Fedchock on trombone, Randy Russell and Bill Ross on tenors and Oddo himself at the piano. The album received a Grammy nomination.\n\nIn September 1982 the band toured Japan. Stapleton was replaced by Bill Byrne who had missed the Concord Festival, as indeed had Frank Tiberi who now came back to replace Russell. The band had always been so popular in Japan that its presence on its own was enough to fill the various halls, but Al Cohn, Med Flory, Sal Nistico and Flip Phillips had been added to the tour as guests, and the success was overwhelming. The Concord album which resulted showed the usual exotic mixture of titles, with standards like Four Brothers and Rader's Greasy Sack Blues alongside Chick Corea's Crystal Silence, Flip's The Claw (for the tenors) and Oddo's chart of Rockin’ Chair with a good humoured vocal duet between George Rabbai and Woody and space for Rabbai to tread Armstrong ground with his trumpet solo.\n\nBack in the States the band recorded for Concord with Rosemary Clooney, another of the label's big successes. John Oddo wrote all of the arrangements save one, and the session offered a fine chance to hear the quality of the section work. It seems likely that Oddo is to tread the paths made by Ralph Burns and Nat Pierce, because his writing for the band has great substance and depth. Miss Clooney is fortunate in having such support, as an ear bent to the arrangement of Summer Knows will demonstrate.\n\nThe big band was working mainly out West as 1984 drew to a close, and Woody began 1985 by taking a small group of alumni into New York's St Regis Hotel. Among the names he planned to use were Carl Fontana, John Bunch, Al Cohn, Flip Phillips and Jake Hanna.\n\nThen disaster struck. It had been discovered that there were huge tax irregularities in the band's affairs of the middle sixties, at a time when the manager Abe Turchen looked after the money. It transpired that Turchen had set money aside for payment to the Internal Revenue Service (including the tax due from the individual musicians) and instead of paying it over had gambled it all away. By the time all this came to light Turchen had died and Woody was held responsible for the full amount and was in grave danger of being sent to jail. The I.R.S. has been relentless in pursuing the old man for the full amount and he has to keep working to pay them or risk having all his possessions seized (there is currently a rumour that the Service is trying to seize the Hollywood home that Woody and Charlotte bought from Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall back in the forties).\n\nIt is a sad commentary on the American way of doing things that an honourable man should be hounded and have his last years over-shadowed by reprisals for something that was not of his doing. Surely there must be someone in authority who could write the matter off and leave Woody to enjoy a peaceful old age.\n\nAlthough he was obviously suffering from severe exhaustion Woody toured Europe in the summer of 1985 with a magnificent group of all stars: Harry Edison on trumpet, Buddy Tate and Al Cohn on tenors, John Bunch on piano, bassist Steve Wallace and drummer Jake Hanna. The music was magnificent with Cohn and Tate particularly striking sparks from each other. Woody, not a hundred per cent fit, had lost some of his fluency on clarinet, but he showed on I've Got The World On A String his vocal abilities were little impaired—the breakneck Caldonia would have thrown a Jon Hendricks, never mind Woody! The musicians in the band showed great concern for the leader and Buddy Tale in particular took care of Woody and his affairs.\n\nWoody had a big band ready for the beginning of 1986, the year of his 50th anniversary as a bandleader. The new library drew heavily on Ellington material and the new Herd was every bit as skilled and effective as the earlier ones. It was notable that the old man's clarinet playing had recovered from the frailly that had been noticeable in his work at the 1985 Nice Jazz Festival. Although it was not to go away and would remain with him for life, he seemed to be philosophical about the burden of his tax problems.\n\nWoody Herman and his Herds have conquered the hemispheres, and his bands are as popular throughout Asia as they are in Europe, as much in demand to work in Los Angeles as in New York. Herman goes on and claims, as he says in the letter to the author printed elsewhere in this book, that he is too old to retire. There is an old adage that if you always want to look young, you should hang around with very old people. Herman has achieved that end by reversing the formula. He always works with young people. One of the greatest achievements of any Herd is the potent dispensation of energy. Energy comes best from young people, but with the experience of the old coach to guide them, it is always deployed to maximum effect.\n\nOf course, you must have the right young people, and one of Herman's talents is in spotting potential greatness in a player before anyone else does (Charlie Parker had this ability as instanced by the way in which he selected the apparently musically incoherent Miles Davis for his group — Parker knew then about Miles what we all know now). Another important quality is Woody's unerring ability to edit a performance on the stand. He knows exactly when to cut a soloist off or, if the man is in full flight and likely to add something constructive, when to let him take an extra couple of choruses without destroying the balance of the arrangement. He looks forward, hates to look back, and if you ask him which was the best band he ever had he'll answer 'The next one'.\n\nOn the face of it the formula is fairly simple. Take a team of good soloists, add some good section leaders, a rhythm section with roots, some good writers and a player-coach. Anyone could do it.\n\nOr could they? Phil Wilson's thought is a wise one.\n\n'Nobody does what Woody does as well as he does. If we could only figure out what it is he does . . .'”\n\nWoody Herman died in 1987.\n\n↧\n\nTony Williams 1945-1997: The Unpredictable in Jazz Drumming - Revised and Expanded\n\nThe following feature on drummer, bandleader and composer, Tony Williams has been revised to include below \"A Lesson from Tony\" sent to us from drummer Ed Soph who teaches at the University of North Texas and the Tony Scherman Interview with Tony that appeared in the March, 1992 edition of Musician Magazine and which originally featured on these pages as a separate postings. This represents another of our efforts to \"put it all in one place\" so that these combined features might be easier to research in the future.\n\nThe original posting about Tony Williams has consistently been one of the most popular pieces on the blog having received over 13,000 hits to date.\n\nWe receive many requests from around the world to re-post this feature so we thought we'd take this opportunity to honor them at this time.\n\nTo put it mildly, Tony Williams' drumming on Miles Davis' 1963 recording of Seven Steps to Heaven shocked the Jazz world in general and Jazz drummers in particular.\n\nNo one had ever played Jazz drums like that before.\n\nBar lines disappeared; solos stopped and started everywhere and anywhere; drums crackled, popped and exploded; cymbals splashed and crashed in unexpected places; the hi-hat was played on four-beats-to-the-bar almost as though it were being danced on; the metronomic pulse that underscores Jazz became heightened and unrelenting.\n\nTony pushed, shoved and pulled the momentum of the music unceasingly, almost unmercifully at times.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way.\n\nPianist Victor Feldman, who was himself a master drummer, and who essentially wrote the title tune with a few additions by Miles, was scheduled to play on that date along with Los Angeles-based drummer, Frank Butler.\n\nAlthough Victor and Frank did play Seven Steps to Heaven with Miles, along with Joshua, another original by Victor, and the other songs on the LP [Victor's arrangement of Basin Street Blues remains a masterpiece of re-harmonization] during Miles' brief stint on the West Coast in 1963, Victor was too busy in the Los Angeles studios [and Frank had other stuff going on] and didn't make the trip back to New York to record his two original compositions with Miles for Columbia [CL 2051].\n\nEnter Tony Williams' stunning recording debut on Seven Steps to Heaven.\n\nThe rest as they say is history.\n\n“Though regarded as one of the greatest drummers in the 20th century, in many ways Tony Williams remains un-credited with his contributions to American music. Speak to his collaborators and the musicians he has influenced about his music, and you often hear what amounts to mysteries and fables.”\n\n- Ken Micallef, “Bridge to the Beyond,” down beat, November 2008\n\n“Tony Williams was only seventeen years old when he joined [Miles] Davis in May 1963 …. Williams was so young that Davis faced problems with authorities when he was booked to play nightclubs where minors were not allowed. But Williams compensated for his lack of professional experience with an excess of power, passion and creativity – indeed no other percussionist in the history of Jazz ever played so well, so young.”\n\n- Ted Gioia, The History of Jazz, p. 333.\n\n© -Steven A. Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\nTony Williams literally walked into my life.\n\nTo digress for a moment, during most of the decade of the 1990s, I lived in San Francisco, but I could have lived anywhere because due to a dispersed, national group of clients, I traveled a portion of every week, every year for over a decade.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, all bad, San FranciscoInternationalAirport is a horrible place for the business traveler. Delays and flight cancellations are the rule rather than the exception, so I frequently found myself stranded following business meetings.\n\nFortunately, I worked for a major firm that allowed me to stay in a hotel of my choice while the company’s travel agents re-booked my flight home for the following day [hopefully].\n\nOne such incident occurred in October, 1993 when a cancelled flight to San Francisco found me staying over at the Palmer House in Chicago.\n\nOf course, every Jazz fan has heard about Chicago’s legendary club – The Jazz Showcase. Founded in the late 1940’s by Joe Segal, its tenure as a club that featured top Jazz groups rivaled that of Max Gordon’s Village Vanguard in New York.\n\nAlthough I was aware of its existence, I had never been there. Being marooned overnight in Chicago one autumn night gave me the opportunity to do so.\n\nWhen I asked at the hotel’s Concierge Desk if they could help with directions to the club, one of the gentlemen there looked up at me, gently smiled and in a wonderful accented voice asked: “Fancy short walk do you?” I found out later that it was a Yorkshire accent in which the use of articles such as “the” and “a” are dropped.\n\nNow, October is generally an absolutely gorgeous month in Chicago weather-wise, so when I said I did, he continued: “Out front door of hotel, turn right down Monroe for block to Michigan Avenue, turn left, you’ll find it ways up on right in old Blackstone Hotel.”\n\nPiece ‘o cake. Twenty minutes later I was in the beautiful lobby of the historic Blackstone with its aged, wood paneling and marble columns. I gather that Joe Segal had been forced to move The Jazz Showcase from a previous location and it was now housed in one of the hotel’s conference rooms just off the main lobby that had been re-fashioned for this purpose.\n\nOn the bill that evening was guitarist John Scofield who was fronting a trio that included Larry Goldings on piano and Hammond B-3 organ and Bill Stewart on drums.\n\nThere were more marble columns in the club area, in fact, these seemed so ubiquitous that they blocked a number of views of the stage. I glommed onto a small table off to the side of the stage with a perfect view of Bill Stewart [old habits die hard for drummers].\n\nJust after the set began, someone was at my shoulder and pointing to the other chair at the table while asking: “Is anyone sitting here.”\n\nI was so engrossed in watching Bill and listening to the music that I didn’t even look up to the male voice asking the question. I just held out my hand in the direction of the chair and said: “It’s all yours.”\n\nWhen the tune was finished, I looked over at my table guest, smiled and in a flash of recognition said” “You’re Tony Williams!” And he said: “Yes, I am, and you’re a drummer.” “How did you know that?”, I queried. Tony offered: “The whole time you were digging Bill, your left foot was playing the high-hat on 2 and 4 and your right foot was feathering the bass drum on all 4 beats.”\n\nAnd that’s how I met Tony Williams. He bought me a drink “ …for being kind enough to share ‘my’ table with him….” I found out that, while he had been born in Chicago and was in town on some personal business, he too, lived in the San FranciscoBay area.\n\nWe talked about drums and drummers until Bill Stewart came by our table, and then all three of us talked about – you guessed it – drums and drummers.\n\nWhen Bill left us to get ready for the next set, Tony shared how much he was enjoying writing for his own band and continuing his studies to expand his knowledge of music theory and harmony.\n\nI had to confess that while I had been very familiar with Tony’s musical travels with Miles Davis in the 1960s and the group Lifetime in the 1970s, I had really lost touch with his career after that.\n\nHe asked for my address in San Francisco and a short while later two Blue Note CDs that Tony had produced with his then current group, and for which he had written most of the music, arrived in my mailbox.\n\nLater he sent me a copy of the CD Marvelous on which he appears with pianist Michel Petrucciani and bassist Dave Holland.\n\nIn the ensuing years, my world became professionally busier and, as it is sometimes wont to do, LIFE skipped a heartbeat and three years later in June, 1997 Tony was gone having died from complications following a surgery.\n\nWhile working on the Davy Tough and Papa Jo Jones blog features, the JazzProfiles editorial staff began reflecting on who amongst contemporary Jazz drummers have been similarly influential in terms of setting trends in drumming styles?\n\nThe name that readily came to mind was Elvin Jones as elements of his method of playing have had a far-reaching influence of drummers such as Peter Erskine, Bill Stewart, Adam Nussbaum and a host of others. The way in which Elvin accented eight note and quarter note triplets and inflected them with the bass drum is everywhere apparent in the phrasing of many of today’s Jazz drummers.\n\nBut what of the influence of Tony Williams? It’s there, but why is it harder to discern as compared with that of Elvin? The answer may lie in Elvin’s predictability as compared with Tony’s unpredictability.\n\nAlthough he would reconfigured them by beginning and ending on different parts of the drum kit, Elvin essentially played the same “licks” over and over again to create, what many describe as a “polyrhythmic” feeling or sound to his drumming.\n\nWith Tony, you never knew what was coming next; the licks and phrases were not repetitive so how could they be copied? How does one mimic unpredictability?\n\nInstead of rudimental phrases, Tony Williams offered drummers a whole new concept of playing Jazz drums based around what has been described as “controlled chaos.”\n\nTony underscored this tendency by making tempos sound “elastic” and by playing with intense swiftness and a pulsating forward motion. All of these qualities became more pronounced in his playing as the years moved along.\n\nThe following description by Peter Watrous is an excellent overview of the elements and evolution of Tony’s approach to Jazz drumming:\n\n“Early in his career he was the master of the ride cymbal. He liked a clean spare sound evoking the slight sizzle of fat in a frying pan, and often moved abruptly between light and cluttered textures. And in his swing, Mr. Williams was utterly committed. …\n\nAs part of the Miles Davis quintet rhythm section with Herbie Hancock on piano and Ron Carter on bass, Mr. Williams radically changed the way a band worked. In his hands, tempos were pliable, ….\n\nAlong with his band mates, Mr. Williams took group improvisation further than it had gone before, developing structural improvisations that made the form of a tune seem finally irrelevant to the music. Thirty years later, his early playing is still striking for its audacity; his capacity to listen, to hear within the group and augment the musical conversation, seemed unbounded.” [New York Times obituary, June 7, 2009].\n\nBefore moving on, let’s be clear about what type of drumming is being discussed here. This is not the unobtrusive playing-like-the-wind style of Jo Jones, or playing under a band like Davy Tough; Tony Williams drumming is pure, unadulterated, bombastic explosiveness.\n\nIn a 1992 interview he have to Bill Milkowski for the Modern Drummer, Tony stated:\n\n“I like to play loud. I believe the drums should be hit hard.”\n\nMaybe the reason that Tony’s style is so idiosyncratic is that he did not come up into the world of Jazz through the typical big band route. And the reason for that is easy to understand because when Tony was growing up, primarily in the 1950’s, for all intents and purposes, big bands were a dying breed.\n\nPerhaps another basis for the stylistic distinctiveness of Tony’s drumming is because it embraced the new, more complex Rock ‘n Roll that was just coming into existence as he was reaching his majority in the mid-to-late 1960s.\n\nThe infusion or inflection of Latin rhythms also gave Tony’s drumming another element of uniqueness in combination with other sources that he drew from outside the mainstream of the Jazz tradition.\n\nAs is the case with many creative young people, Tony was in-step with the influences around him; the influences of his time. His temperament seemed to prefer the inclusion of these seemingly disparate influences, rather than drawing lines or creating categories based around mutual exclusivity.\n\nGiven this process of development, Tony’s impressionistic and fiery timekeeping made an enormous contribution to the landmark series of recordings made by the Miles Davis Quintet in the late 1960’s including Seven Steps to Heaven, Miles Smiles, Sorcerer, E.S.P., Nefertiti and Filles de Kilimanjaro.\n\nWhat was apparent in the 1960s was that Jazz was changing and, according to many, not necessarily for the better. But this was largely the opinion of those Jazz fans who preferred the understated swing of the 1930s or the straight-ahead rhythms of the post World War II be-bop and hard bop eras.\n\nThe former group heralded the tap dance-like drumming of Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson while the latter group preferred the driving propulsion of Max Roach, Art Blakey and Philly Joe Jones.\n\nTony along with drummers of his generation and those that would follow, while certainly respectful and admiring of the technical ability of all these drummers, heard the music differently and wanted to incorporate other elements into their drumming in response to it.\n\nDrummer Terri Lynne Carrington explains Tony’s significance this way:\n\n“Every time I hear Tony I remember how great he is. It’s always fresh and amazing. Tony brought the drums to the forefront more than ever. He took from Roy Haynes and moved it forward in his own way. I hate to talk in absolutes, but he made the greatest individual personal statement on the instrument ever. His technique was incredible and he had the most important element – time feel.”\n\nPut another way from drummer Peter Erskine:\n\n“Words seem inadequate to describe his work with Miles, and how new it was and yet completely tied into tradition. … all of a sudden the drums were right in your face, the visceral reaction was that it was one of drumming’s biggest shots across the bow.”\n\nAnd this from drummer Bill Stewart about Tony’s seminal recordings with Miles:\n\n“One of the things I love about Tony’s playing in this period is his listening ability, his interaction and timing. He plays these interactive things at moments in the music that propel the music forward. It’s about the spaces he plays those things in…. The other thing that crept into his playing was using the hi-hat on all fours sometimes.”\n\nThese late 1960’s recordings by the Miles Davis Quintet on which Tony appears as such a dominant force are a dividing line of sorts for those Jazz fans who prefer the group’s from the period from 1955-1965.\n\nIn this later period, Miles continued to push forward and explore new areas for his music through the use of electronic instruments, primarily keyboards and guitar, percussion instruments that are played either in Latin rhythms [including the newly arrived bossa nova] or freely to add tonal colors and cross rhythms and by using rock beats. Add to this what has been described as Tony Williams “scorched earth campaign” drumming, and it is easy to understand why those who preferred more traditional Jazz styles could become disenchanted with this music, let alone overwhelmed by it.\n\nAs drummer Billy Hart explicates:\n\n“When Tony joined Miles … he had been a prolific young student under Alan Dawson. Tony had figured out the bebop guys, and that they were playing Latin from Dizzy and Bird’s interest in Afro-Cuban. Around the same time, the Brazilian thing hit. Tony had the advantage over the previous bebop drummers in that he could compare the Cuban vocabulary with the Brazilian. … Tony was in a position to use all incoming styles as part of his vocabulary.”\n\nWhat super-charged all of this was Tony’s whole-hearted embracing of rock drumming and the manner in which he infused it into Jazz, especially of Miles’ Filles de Kilimanjaro and one particular tune on this album – Frelon Brun.\n\nDrummer Lennie White details the significance of this turn of events as follows:\n\n“Tony plays Jazz-Rock, not Fusion. The connotation is different. Added to this was another innovation in the way he got a whole new drum sound with his larger kit and the way played eight notes and back beats. Tony played grooves and beats with a Jazz sensibility. He played his grooves on the sock cymbal. He’s got Papa Jo Jones up top with his back beat stuff on the bottom with bass drum and snare, playing in between like a great Jazz drummer would. He’s playing the history of Jazz drumming, because he is comping. He never forgot his roots.”\n\nIn 1998, the year following Tony Williams’ death, the Mike Zwerin published a feature for www.culturekiosque.com entitled Tony Williams: Finding His Beautiful Vase in which he commented:\n\n“He would not be who he is without those he learned from. It’s a matter on universality. As he learned technique, he also learned that the drums are more important than he is.\n\nHe compares the learning process to a dusty living room. You’re comfortable there, it’s home, but one day you see something in the corner that attracts your eye. You never saw it before. To get it, you have to move everything and clean the dust. Williams cleaned and cleaned and found his beautiful vase. Improvising is about being able to clean your dust, to find the vase and to recognize that it is beautiful in itself.” …\n\nAn optimist by nature, Williams does not believe in the good old days. He will not hold on to the past, he can envision the days when he will no longer play the drums.\n\nThe drummer never stops playing back there – there are aching feet, ankles, thighs, hips and elbows. He cannot imagine himself doing that forever. Plus, he loves being in his home south of San Francisco, even when he’s staring at the walls.\n\nP.S. All hats off to Tony Williams. RIP.”\n\nPart 2: Tony Williams - The Tony Scherman Interview\n\n© -Steven Cerra, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\nA LESSON FROM TONY WILLIAMS\n\n“When I was a kid, for about two years I played like Max Roach. Max is my favorite drummer. Art Blakey was my first drum idol, but Max was the biggest. So I would buy every record I could with Max on it and then I would play exactly what was on the record, solos and everything. I also did that with Art Blakey, Philly Joe Jones, Jimmy Cobb, Roy Haynes, and all of the drummers I admired. I would even tune my drums just like they were on the record.\n\nPeople try to get into drums today, and after a year, they’re working on their own style. You must first spend a long time doing everything that the great drummers do. Then you can understand what it means. Not only do you learn how to play something, but you also learn why it was played. That’s the value of playing like someone. You can’t just learn a lick; you’ve got to learn where it came from, what caused the drummer to play that way, and a number of things. Drumming is like an evolutionary pattern.”\n\nOur recent re-posting of an earlier piece on the late drummer Tony Williams [1945-1997] generated a lot of interest including a very nice note from drummer Ed Soph who teaches at the University of North Texas admonishing us for not saying more about the role of Tony’s teacher Alan Dawson in helping to shape Williams’ exciting approach to drumming.\n\nEd also kindly sent along the “Lesson from Tony” that opens this feature.\n\nThe earlier piece on Tony also overlooked other aspects of his later career particularly his tremendous accomplishments as a composer, arranger and bandleader, the latter during a time in the mid-1980’s when very few new, modern Jazz quintets were being formed.\n\nThe following interview by Tony Scherman is intended to rectify some of these omissions.\n\nVery sadly, five short years after the interview was conducted, Tony would be dead from complication following an appendix surgery.\n\nMarch, 1992\n\nMusician Magazine\n\nCan’t Stop Worrying, Can’t Stop Growing: Tony Williams Reinvents Himself\n\n“This may sound self-aggrandizing, but playing the drums was always easy for me. From an early age, it was so easy to figure stuff out it was almost embarrassing. I needed to prove to myself that I was deserving of all the praise, needed to feel that I'd accomplished something—that I had accomplished something, the person that I am. I needed to tackle something that was hard, that wasn't God-given, and see it grow. That's what writing music has been, and is, for me. I had to go get a teacher, I had to study composition for seven years. That was work. Writing music, that's work. Drumming has never been work, it's always been fun. It's still fun. So I could never put the word 'work' in my life, and how can you be a success to yourself if you've never had to work?\"\n\nAs he enters middle age, Tony Williams looks less and less African American, more and more exotic, near-Eastern: Persian, Lebanese, Assyrian. In profile, his nose hooks luxuriantly. His big almond-shaped eyes are sleepy and liquid; their blank stare can be unnerving. He wears his hair semi-straightened now, brushed back into a stiff little ducktail, and with his lazy rolling gait and odd-shaped body—thick biceps, thick waist—he looks like an ill-tempered Buddha.\n\nTony Williams—a handful. He plays like the rushing wind, like an avalanche, like a natural disaster. People look at each other and start to laugh, he's so good, so loud, so unapologetically in their faces. There's nothing polite about Tony Williams's drumming, nor anything overly diplomatic about him. He's testy, suspicious, self-involved. Still, the gibe I've heard more than once—\"the only thing bigger than Tony Williams's talent is his ego\"—strikes me as untrue. Beneath the cold manner flickers a real vulnerability: unhealed wounds. I'll bet he's easily devastated. Something gnaws at this guy, some basic insecurity, and if it makes him difficult and defensive, it's also made him hungry to learn. How many drummers can write a fugue? Compose for string quartet? Organize a spectacularly tight five-man jazz group and write every bit of its thirty-song repertoire—sinuous, muscular, haunting pieces? Williams's composing hasn't yet approached the level of his playing (how many drummers could you non-fatuously call \"the world's greatest\"?), but his achievement is pretty amazing: He's willed a new facet of himself into being.\n\nBack in 1963, Tony was already working hard, if somewhat in the dark, at composing. \"When I was a kid I thought this was what you did: you worked at whatever there was to get better at. Being a good musician meant to keep studying, keep learning. You didn't just specialize. Even back then, the thing that drove me on was wanting to do more, to have a say, to create an atmosphere.\"\n\nHerbie Hancock, a former prodigy himself, was a suave twenty-three to the kid's eager-beaver seventeen. \"Tony was always calling me up: 'Hey man! What's happening!' and I'd think, 'Aw kid, don't bothah me!' and try to gracefully get him off the phone.\" Callow or not, the kid was an astonishing drummer. When the pair joined the Miles Davis Quintet that spring, says Hancock, \"I very quickly went from thinking of Tony as someone who was a real good drummer for a kid to realizing he was a great drummer who happened to be a kid.\" Thirty years later, Hancock is still an intrigued Williams-watcher. \"Tony Williams,\" he says, \"is one of the most intelligent people I have ever known.\"\n\nWhen Tony wrote the songs for his first album, 1964's Life Time, he played piano with two fingers, \"one on his right hand,\" says Hancock, \"one on his left. No chords really, just two lines, and I had to write out the notes for him. His writing was very raw. But I wasn't about to dismiss something because it was a two-fingered composition; knowing the kind of mind Tony had, I just wanted to not get in his way, to help him realize whatever he had in the back of his head. And I still think the compositions on those first two albums [Life Time and Spring] were great.\n\n\"Today he's mastered the vocabulary, but without losing the beauty of that rawness. He's got a full palette now, from angular and surprising to very singable, very beautiful in the conventional sense. My feeling is, he has really got the compositional approach down. Tony doesn't need to study with anybody, at least not for a long while! I'll put it this way. Wayne Shorter and Stravinsky are my favorite composers of all time. Tony is developing so quickly as a composer that he's already one of my favorite jazz composers, and maybe moving toward being one of my favorite composers, period. I absolutely like his pieces that much.\"\n\nMiles liked them, too; the Davis Quintet's classic Sixties albums are sprinkling Williams tunes like \"Pee Wee\" and \"Hand Jive.\" But for Tony, \"writing always felt hit-and-miss: 'Maybe this'll work, maybe it won't, why won't it?'\" He had taken sporadic private lessons in theory and harmony since the mid-Sixties; 1979, however, was a turning point. He'd left Manhattan for the San Francisco Bay Area (where he still lives) \"feeling in a hole, in a rut; 1 felt like 1 wasn't doing what I had the talent to do: write music, have a band, have better relationships.\" He thought about quitting music. Instead, he started private lessons in composition, mostly with Robert Greenberg, a young composer and university professor.\n\n\"It was a regular course of study, like at a university. You do a lot of analyzing of other people's work: Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms. I started with species counterpoint, went to intermediate forms of counterpoint, like canons, then invertible counterpoint, like fugues, and on to larger forms of composition—minuet and trio, theme and variations, rondo, that type of thing. It's all about learning how to weave structure and melody into a composition.\" When a recharged Williams launched his quintet in 1986, some of the band's best pieces came straight from his exercise book—\"Arboretum\" was an assignment in counterpoint, \"Clear Ways\" in voice-leading. Tony left Greenberg three years ago; \"the band started working so much, I couldn't do my lessons. But 1 plan to go back and pick up where I stopped.\"\n\nBefore 1979, Williams says, \"I knew everything there is to know about harmony and theory. What I mean is, I had a good solid grounding in all that stuff. But I didn't know how to organize. You might know emotionally what you want to say, but then it becomes a matter of getting the material to move where you want it to. It's problem-solving. For me it was like, 'I know there's a problem here but I don't know what it is.' When I come up to a problem now, I can pinpoint it. On paper. I can look at it and say, 'Oh, that's the problem and it's because of this, this and this, so if I adjust this, take that out, move this in'... problem solved.\"\n\nWhat kind of problem, how to resolve a chord? \"No, not how to resolve a chord, that's easy. How to expand an idea. How to make it go somewhere and then return. My big problem used to be that I agonized over things. I'd get an idea and not know what to do with it. Now when I get an idea, I know what to do. Writing is just being able to, as Bob Greenberg used to say, push notes around. Make the notes do what you want them to do.\n\n\"Sometimes when I was studying I'd wonder, 'What the hell am I doing? Will there come a time when I'll use this stud'and say, \"Oh, this is why you've spent six, seven years staying up and writing these lessons out and driving back and forth to Berkeley three times a week?\"' But my insides would tell me, 'This is what you should be doing.' And now I can say, 'Yes! This is why I was doing it.'\"\n\n\"What's the payoff?\"\n\nLong pause... \"The fact that you're here. How's that? See, not only am I not just a drummer, I'm not just a musician either. I'm a person. A lot of things that are valid for me aren't only in musical terms. The fact that you're here and we're talking about what I've written, it tells me all those lessons have paid oil, are bringing me attention, it shows me I've done things people are interested in.\"\n\n\"Well, I like the songs. They stay in my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm glad. And that's why I wanted to study. I wanted to be able to write songs the way 1 knew I could, to present music my friends would like to hear, that would make people feel different things.\n\n\"So making the decision to study was easy. I make that kind of decision a lot. Moving to California was another of those things my insides told me to do. And after I got to California I decided to take swimming lessons. [\"He did? Tony learned to swim? Aw, that's beautiful!\"—Hancock.] I wanted to be able to go to a swimming pool and not just stand and wade; I got tired of going by the deep end and being scared. Now I can dive into the deep end. When I was in New York I was in therapy. In California, I have a therapist. It's helped me look at parts of my life 1Ineed to look at. It's the same kind of process—I'm always challenging myself to get better.\"\n\n\"Tony's composition, 'Sister Cheryl,'\" says Herbie Hancock—\"the first time I heard that tune [in 1982, when he and Williams played it on Wynton Marsalis's debut] I was shocked. Suddenly there was no more guesswork; Tony could really write chord changes. But what amazed me was that it was in a style that had eluded him for a long time. You know whal Tony once told me? That he wanted to be able to write a tune anybody could sing, like a very natural kind of pop melody. Not that 'Sister Cheryl' is pop— it isn't—but it's catchy. Tony was always asking me what I thought of this or that tune that he wrote. See, I can write melodies people can sing. Tony could never do that, not till then. In many ways—though it's not all the same, and it's definitely Tony's writing—'Sister Cheryl' reminded me of 'Maiden Voyage.' It's one of my favorite compositions ever.\n\n\"The way he wrote it, you just move the bass line and the chord will change radically. It starts on a B-major chord, but using the second instead of the third. It's B, C-sharp, F-sharp. With so few notes in the chord, you get lots of flexibility. From B-major it goes to A-flat minor 7— and everything from that first chord fits with the second chord. Then you go to A with a B-major. That's the theme. Now, all these chords fit with the B, C-sharp and F-sharp of the first chord, so by changing the bass line you've changed all the chords, but kept the harmony hanging over from that very first chord. The melody moves, the bass moves, but the harmony stays the same; the outer part changes, the inner part doesn't. It's a nice piece of work.\"\n\n\"Tony's harmonies are like a breath of fresh air,\" says the Williams Quintet's fine pianist, Mulgrew Miller. \"Remember, we're talking about a jazz composer who isn't himself a harmonic and melodic improviser. So his progressions may be a little unorthodox—Tony didn't learn jazz writing by playing 'Stardust.' The standard iii-vi-ii-V-I turnaround, there's none of that. You won't hear many 32-bar choruses either: as long as the song needs to be, that's how long he writes 'em. And the keys he chooses are somewhat unusual. 'Sister Cheryl,' that's in B-major. Outside of practicing scales, I'd never even played in B-major; it's mostly sharps. A piano player might fool around with something in B and say, 'Hmmm, I like this progression, I think I'll move it down to E-flat.' Not Tony— it's B.\n\n\"He's got a tremendous set of ears and he loves harmony; he loves the color of complex chords. Catchy melodies are one of his traits, but catchy melodies with complex harmonies. The chord progressions and chorus lengths are almost always unconventional. And that goes back to Wayne Shorter. Listen to Wayne's 'Nefertiti.' Most of his pieces with Miles were like that: simple melody, complex harmony. A piece of Tony's like 'Two Worlds' is so melodic, if someone heard only the melody, they'd have no idea what harmonic convulsions, what explosions, are going on underneath. Of all Tony's pieces, that's probably the meanest (\"Every time I call 'Two Worlds,'\" says Williams, \"I see at least one guy scrambling for the sheet music\"]: a lot of changes at a fast tempo, and they're complex changes, like G 9 to A-flat major 7 to B-flat 11 to B-minor flat 6th. The challenge to the improvisor is finding the continuity in all these changes that don't relate!\n\n\"I just think Tony hears something different from most people. He's got influences, like Wayne and Herbie and contemporary classical music, but mainly it just comes from being an inventive person. It's the same thing that lets him play the way he does. From what I hear, Tony was challenging the accepted forms right from his earliest days. Listen to those records with Eric Dolphy. It's clear that even at the age of eighteen he was an advanced thinker,\"\n\nTony Williams lit his third fat cigar in two hours. \"It's a mark of a good song when anyone can play it, when it's so well-placed on the paper that it doesn't need a special interpretation, a great artist, to make it sound good.\" Brushing back the hotel-room curtain, he stood surveying Central Park West. He was beautifully dressed in a loose shirt, baggy winter pants and gorgeous two-toned shoes; circling his comfortable middle was the same metal-studded belt he'd worn the day before for his maiden voyage on David Letterman's TV show.\n\n\"It's like when you hear a hit song being played by some guy in a Holiday Inn bar and you say, 'Yeah, that's a great song.' Last night Paul Shaffer played 'Sister Cheryl' and it was a real turn-on. The song sounded so good. Those are good players, but what I'm saying is, the song translates easily from one group, one medium, to another; it doesn't take my band to play it.\n\n\"Or there's 'Native Heart'—the fact that I wrote that song (the title track on Williams's newest album] just knocks me out. It's like someone else wrote it and I'm getting a chance to play it. I worked on that song four, five months, playing it every day on the piano. It was crafted, like fine leather, like shoes.\"\n\n\"Could you analyze it for me?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think I'd like to do that. Anyway, I can't. I write the songs and then I forget about them. It's up to the other guys to learn them. I don't need to. I'm playing the drums. Unless I'm working on a song, I can't tell you its chords; I'd have to go back to the piano with the music and I'd be able to play it after an hour or so. Besides, when you're writing, you have certain little things inside that tickle you, and you don't want to give them away. They wouldn't feel special if you flaunt them; it's like saying, 'Oooh, look how clever I am!' These things are private, they're little gems to me.\"\n\n\"But they're what's interesting: the things underneath.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and I'm interested in keeping them underneath. All I did in 'Native Heart' was invert the idea.\"\n\n\"Of the melody—?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\"\n\n\"—or the chords?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n[Coyly] \"I don't want to give away all my secrets here! They're precious things!\" Finally he relents. \"Okay, what happened was, I had this idea and I wanted to make a song out of it.\" He sings a simple little eight-bar version of the melody. \"In itself it was just an idea, just a real short thing. So first of all I had to weave length into it.\" Setting out, he broke the phrase into two-bar chunks and put a one-bar rest between each. More important, he rewrote it, introducing a subdominant in the eleventh measure so the tune didn't resolve so quickly. \"All I did was put in a few new notes. And then the second time (he phrase comes around, you go right to the five chord, the dominant—bang!—and it resolves. So I aired it out, fleshed it out, by putting in the subdominant.\n\n\"Okay, now I had to figure out, 'Where is this song going?' I had this two-note thing happening in the melody [D to A, a fifth]. Now, I deeply wanted the song to sound organic. So what I did was, I took that two-note phrase and gradually stretched it [to a sixth, F to D and then G to E] while slowing it down. Then 1 compressed it [accelerating it as it descends toward the tonic]—and when you compress a figure it brings a sense of resolution. So that was the work I did [in bars 25-33] to give the song a middle part, a so-called bridge, that sounded like it belonged, that was part of the opening melody.\" Just to strengthen the connection, Tony took a phrase from the fourth and fifth bars of the opening melody, turned the notes—B, C, D and B—upside down, and made this the last two bars of the middle: \"a mirror, a reflective callback,\" as he puts it, of the opening melody.\n\nAll he needed now was an ending. \"I was going to end it one way, with a little phrase that kind of drifts off. I decided that was too protracted, even though 1 liked the phrase.\" So he wrote another ending: the opening melody, but with a few new intervals and one brand-new note, an A-flat: \"It's a piece of music, and a note, that's never been heard in the song before, so it really puts a cap on things. And then 1 said, 'Hey, wait a minute'—and I took that first ending, the one I'd loved but hadn't used, and made it the intro and outro. It was perfect there.\" And he had his song: a sultry, moodily swirling 45-measure composition, patiently teased from an eight-bar scrap.\n\n\"I think more about these kinds of things than I do about drums. 'Cause like I said, the drumming has never been a problem for me. That was the problem! I felt like all everybody wanted was this drummer, that Tony Williams was not there, that I didn't matter. And it caused me a lot of emotional pain.\n\n\"I'm not talking about fans, I'm talking about people I worked with. That was the pain, that if I weren't this drummer I wouldn't have these people as my friends. And 1 realized that was true. Everything that went on told me that. There I was in New York by myself—seventeen, eighteen, nineteen—and the only reason I was here was because I played the drums as well as I did. It was strange, very strange. In Miles Davis's band I was the youngest, the smallest and, as I felt, the least educated. I didn't feel good about myself. So that's to answer your question why would a person who's good at one thing want to be good at something else too. And those are valid reasons.\n\n\"I'd like to write things I wouldn't have to play. I'd like to write for certain orchestras. I've never been the type that needed to play drums in order to feel like a person. I choose to play, it's my desire to play. I'm not the kind of guy that goes around with drumsticks in his hands beating on things. I could live without drumming. There was a couple of years when I didn't play at all; I just hung out, lived off the rent from a house I own uptown here. Because I don't need the drums, I think I play belter. I respect them too much to use them as a crutch. When I sit down at the drums it's because I want to; it's like 'I'm here to be your friend.'\n\n\"The drums are my best friend. The drums are the only thing I've been able to count on totally, except my mother— and sometimes when she gets pissed off, boy, she can give me a look.... If it weren't for the drums, I wouldn't be here. But I can listen to the drums in my head. I mean, I rarely, in the last ten years, get the feeling to just go downstairs and play drums. I never practice. I can not play for a year and it'll only take me a night or two to get back to where I was. After thirty-six years, there's a certain level you won't never go below.\"\n\nWhich leaves him free to chase his new passion. Last autumn, in \"one of the most thrilling experiences I've ever had,\" Williams performed his first extended composition, the fifteen-minute \"Rituals: Music for Piano, String Quartet, Drums and Cymbals,” with the Kronos Quartet and Hancock. He's sniffing out the world of soundtracks: \"I'd do basically anything, movies, TV, jingles, just to see how it came out.\" The quintet, finally getting its due as one of the best of jazz's small groups, is always digesting some new Williams piece, and he's also writing for an electric band (sax, guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums) he plans to start.\n\n\"The more I write, the easier it comes. And it's really a pleasure to be able to write something, have it make sense, and then play it: to have it be not just an exercise but something the other guys enjoy playing. That's more important to me than just being able to say 'I wrote this.'\n\n\"I'm really surprised I've had the emotional stamina to stay resilient. Especially considering how burnt out I was feeling maybe fifteen years ago. It took courage to put a band together when no one else was doing it, and to write all the music. I've had to put myself out there for the scrutiny of everyone, to write songs everyone would scrutinize and criticize and review and critique. That's something that's very scary. To have done it, and to have gotten the reaction I've had, has been very, very wonderful.\"\n\n\"But it shouldn't have been scary, you'd been writing for years.\"\n\n\"What do you mean 'shouldn't have been'? It just was. Like I said, my writing was not the kind of writing I would have wanted it to be. Now it is. But I had to trust that. So now, I've finally gained trust in these other parts of myself.\n\nI’m not just ‘Tony Williams drummer.’ And that feels pretty neat.”\n\n↧\n\nElvin Jones - \"He's A Real Gone Guy\"\n\n↧\n\nSteve Slagle - ALTO MANHATTAN\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMingus, Balliett and Dinosaurs In The Morning [From The Archives]\n\n© - Steven A.

Without this means of preservation, the music might simply have bumbled on a while as a minor facet of American life and then vanished.”\n\nVanished like the dinosaurs?\n\nNo recording machine - no Jazz?\n\nThe answer is most assuredly “Yes” for without the recording machine, Jazz, “... the most evanescent of arts,” could have vanished like the dinosaurs.\n\nInstead, we can listen to Jazz recordings in the morning while sipping our favorite beverage which, I would imagine is far better than discovering dinosaurs in the morning through our breakfast nook window!\n\nCopies of Dinosaurs In The Morning can still be had through online booksellers in various editions for reasonable sums of money and its 41 essays make for unsurpassed reading on the subject of Jazz.\n\nJudge for yourself; here Whitney’s narrative on bassist Charles Mingus.\n\n© - Whitney Balliett, copyright protected; all rights reserved.\n\nMingus\n\n“UNTIL 1939, when Jimmy Blanton appeared, the bass fiddle had occupied the position in jazz of a reliable tackle. It had, a decade before, replaced the tuba in the rhythm section, and its best practitioners—Pops Foster, Al Morgan, Wellman Braud, Milt Hinton, Walter Page, and John Kirby—had become adept at rigid timekeeping and at itemizing the chords of each tune. These bassists also boasted tones that could be felt and even heard in the biggest groups. But they rarely soloed, and, when they did, restricted themselves to on-the-beat statements that were mostly extensions of their ensemble playing. Blanton, who died in 1942, at the age of twenty-one, abruptly changed all this by converting the bass into a hornlike instrument that could be used both rhythmically and melodically. Since then, the bass has taken over the rhythmic burdens once carried by the pianist's left hand and by the bass drum, and it has added a new melodic voice to the ensemble. At the same time, a group of Blanton-inspired bassists have sprung up to meet these new duties, and have included such remarkable performers as Oscar Pettiford, Ray Brown, Red Mitchell, Wilbur Ware, Paul Chambers, Scott LaFaro, and Charlie Mingus.\n\nAll are first-rate accompanists and soloists, and all possess exceptional techniques. The youngest have even begun to wander toward the fenceless meadows of atonality. Chief among these bassists is Mingus, the greatest pizzicato player the instrument has had. He is also the first modern jazz musician who has successfully combined virtuosity, the revolutions brought about by Charlie Parker, and the lyricism of such pre-bebop performers as Ben Webster, the boogie-woogie pianists, and Billie Holiday.\n\nLike many contemporary jazz musicians, Mingus is far more than an instrumentalist. He is a formidable composer-arranger and a beneficent martinet who invariably finds, hires, and trains talented but unknown men. A big, loosely packed man of thirty-eight, with a handsome face and wary, intelligent eyes, Mingus is an indefatigable iconoclast. He is a member of no movement and vociferously abhors musical cant. He denounces rude audiences to their faces. (A recent scolding, administered in a New York night club, was tape-recorded on the spot, and has been printed in an anthology of jazz pieces. It is a heartening piece of hortatory Americana.) He unabashedly points out his colleagues' shams and weaknesses in his album-liner notes or in crackling letters to magazines like Down Beat. When tongue and pen fail him, he uses his fists. Mingus compresses all this dedication into his playing, which is daring, furious, and precise. Despite the blurred tonal properties of the bass, Mingus forces a kaleidoscope of sounds from it. However, much of the time he uses a penetrating tone that recalls such men as Foster and Braud, and that is especially effective in his accompanying, where it shines through the loudest collective passages. (It sometimes shines so brightly that Mingus, in the manner of Sidney Bechet, unintentionally becomes the lead instrument.)\n\nMingus's supporting work is an indissoluble mixture of the rhythmic and the melodic. By seemingly playing hob with the beat— restlessly pulling it forward with double-time inserts, rapid tremolos, or staccato patterns, reining it in with whoa-babe legato figures, or jumping stoutly up and down on it—he achieves the rhythmic locomotion of drummers like Sid Catlett and Jo Jones. Yet he carefully fits these devices to each soloist, lying low when a musician is carrying his own weight, and coming forward brusquely and cheerfully to aid the lame and the halt. It is almost impossible to absorb all of Mingus at a single hearing. In addition to carrying out his rhythmic tasks, he simultaneously constructs attractive and frequently beautiful melodic lines. These may shadow a soloist, or they may be fashioned into counter-lines that either plump the soloist up or accidentally upstage him. Mingus is a dangerous man to play with.\n\nHe is also an exhilarating soloist. Because he is the sort of virtuoso who has long since transcended his instrument, his finest solos are an eloquent, seemingly disembodied music. The pizzicato bass was not designed for the timbres Mingus extracts from it. He may hit a note as if it were a piece of wood, getting a clipped thup. He may make a note reverberate or, rubbing his left hand quickly down the fingerboard, turn it into an abrasive glissando. Sometimes he fingers with the nails of his left hand, achieving a rattling sound. Or he may uncoop a string of whispered notes that barely stir the air. He will start a solo in a medium-tempo blues with a staccato, deck-clearing phrase, cut his volume in half, play an appealing blues melody that suggests the 1928 Louis Armstrong, step up his volume, line out a complex, whirring phrase that may climb and fall with a cicadalike insistency for a couple of measures, develop another plaintive a-b-c figure, improvise on it rhythmically, insert a couple of sweeping smears, and go into an arpeggio that may cover several octaves and that, along the way, will be decorated with unexpected accents.\n\nMingus's solos in ballad numbers are equally majestic. He often plays the first chorus almost straight, hovering behind, over, and in front of the melody—italicizing a note here, adding a few notes there, falling silent now and then to let a figure expand—and finishing up with an embossed now-listen-to-this air. There are only half a dozen jazz soloists skilled enough for such complacency.\n\nMingus the bassist is indivisible from Mingus the leader. He conducts with his bass, setting the tempos and emotional level of each tune with his introductory phrases, toning the ensemble up or down with his volume or simply with sharp stares, and injecting his soloists with countless c.c.s of his own energy. His methods of composition are equally dictatorial and are a fascinating variation of Duke Ellington's. Mingus has explained them in a liner note:\n\nMy present working methods use very little written material. I \"write\" compositions on mental score paper, then I lay out the composition part by part to the musicians. I play them the \"framework\" on piano so that they are all familiar with my interpretation and feeling and with the scale and chord progressions. . . . Each man's particular style is taken into consideration. They are given different rows of notes to use against each chord but they choose their own notes and play them in their own style, from scales as well as chords, except where a particular mood is indicated. In this way I can keep my own compositional flavor ... and yet allow the musicians more individual freedom in the creation of their group lines and solos.\n\nMost of his recent work can be divided into three parts—the eccentric, the lyrical, and the hot. His eccentric efforts have included experiments with poetry and prose readings and attempts to fold non-musical sounds (whistles, ferryboats docking, foghorns, and the like) into his instrumental timbres. The results have been amusing but uneasy; one tends to automatically weed out the extracurricular effects in order to get at the underlying music. The lyrical Mingus is a different matter. His best ballad-type melodies are constructed in wide, curving lines that form small, complete etudes rather than mere tunes. Their content dictates their form, which resembles the ragtime structures of Jelly Roll Morton or the miniature concertos of Duke Ellington, both of whom Mingus has learned from. But Mingus has been most successful with the blues and with gospel or church-type music. The pretensions that becloud some of his other efforts lift, leaving intense, single-minded pieces. More important than the use of different tempos and rhythms in these compositions, which repeatedly pick the music up and put it down, are their contrapuntal, semi-improvised ensembles, in which each instrument loosely follows a melodic line previously sketched out by Mingus. The results are raucous and unplanned, and they raise a brave flag for a new and genuine collective improvisation.\n\nMingus’s most recent records—\"Mingus Ah Urn\" (Columbia), \"Blues & Roots\" (Atlantic), and \"Mingus Dynasty\" (Columbia)—offer some spectacular things. Most of the compositions are by Mingus and are played by nine- or ten-piece groups (a size beyond the budgets of most of the offbeat night clubs in which Mingus generally performs), which employ his collective techniques with considerable aplomb, thus pointing a way out of the box that the big band built itself into before its decl"
