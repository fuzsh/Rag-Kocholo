Then two oboes join the bassoon for a short phrase in unison rhythm that peters out after seven beats. There is a pause, and a jocular clarinet breaks the silence with a brash upward run and a melody that is a mocking variant of the opening trumpet tune. Then the strings join in, and the movement is truly under way. Leonard Bernstein is rehearsing an orchestra of young musicians at the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival. It is summer 1988. In a month he will turn seventy. He is seated, chatting about the work. He is wearing dark glasses and a loose-ﬁtting sky-blue shirt over a white T-shirt. Although he smiles frequently, there is a weariness in the set of his mouth and in the gravelly sound of his voice. The musicians themselves are not\n\n1\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nmuch older than Shostakovich was when he wrote this work, but it is Bernstein who is telling them about its wonders and paradoxes. He speaks about Shostakovich’s antiauthoritarianism, about how quirky and unheroic the symphony’s opening is, about its takeoffs on Wagner’s Tristan, about how its ﬁrst gestures end in sarcastic shrugs. He emphasizes that in the ﬁrst and second movements the playing must be terse and witty so as not to anticipate that, in the Lento which follows, parody will give way to overﬂowing romantic feeling, unmasking the clipped difﬁdence of the opening of the work to reveal the intensity, the love of the very music it is rebelling against, behind it. He talks about an extraordinary place in the slow movement that is the most mysterious moment in the work. The sound in the strings must be as soft as humanly possible, yet also urgent. The only way to achieve this is to play with practically no bow at all, but with the fastest possible vibrato. It is as if, Bernstein seems to be saying, the music captures what Shostakovich was at that moment, what he was leaving behind, and what he would become—all in one work. Bernstein speaks like an old scholar, immersed in a text, who suddenly looks up and starts to talk about it. Although he is, in fact, an old scholar, he doesn’t look precisely “old.” It is more as if he were young but tired, perhaps even tired of being himself. At the same time there is nothing resigned or routine in his bearing. He speaks of the score with the greatest immediacy, conveying excitement about every detail on the page. He raises his hands to begin the symphony, and instantaneously there is discipline, a spring and economy in his gestures, an irresistible inner rhythm. The tinny trumpet tune sounds, the bassoon joins in; he brings down his arms in tiny increments, one for each beat, as the two oboes and bassoon make their unison diminuendo, then makes a brusque upbeat for the bawdy clarinet entrance. He soon stops the clarinetist, a young woman: “No, no—forte,” he says. “Really.” They start 2\n\ni ntroducti on\n\nagain, and again stop. “Surprise us. . . . Come.” They start once more. “No, but on the right beat,” he says with mild irritation, pausing. “Don’t look so scared. Come on, just play the scale forte. One before 1.” He calls out vigorously: “One, two, three! . . . Atta girl—good.” But then he stops again. “It’s not forte. Why aren’t you playing forte?” Then he asks gently, “Why are you so frightened?” Although there is an audience watching the rehearsal and a ﬁlm crew ﬁlming it, and there are a hundred musicians onstage, the moment feels private. He smiles, his hands come together. “Forte. Loud. Loud. Come on, and stay forte for four bars. Atta girl; good.” Pausing again: “You see, in the last bar it comes down to mezzo forte. When the bassoon joins you, she has to join you mezzo forte. And she comes in sounding louder than you because you’ve already gotten to piano. I don’t know why you are so shy. Is it just today?” (She shrugs.) “You’re not a shy girl, right, by nature?” He sings out her clarinet line boisterously. “Do every note the same—forte.” Then in a slightly self-caricaturing tone he counts “One, two, three” and cues her. The passage sounds much better. He looks buoyant. At the performance a week later, now dressed in his concert tuxedo and white bow tie, he is guiding the players through the score, giving signs little and big to remind them of everything they had worked on in rehearsal. In one sense the music is now in their hands. But he is controlling the journey, like a pilot steering an ocean liner, and there is enormous concentration and tension in his body. By the close of the last movement he is bathed in sweat, and he can hardly keep his eyes open for the rivulets of water streaming down his face. There is an ovation. He waits for several moments, seems to gasp for breath while a look of exhaustion passes over him, then nods to the players with satisfaction. Not yet turning to the audience, he hugs the concertmaster and ﬁrst cellist. They suddenly look like boys, bashful, moved. He motions to the orchestra to rise, 3\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nthen ﬁnally turns and bows. On the way to the back of the stage he takes the hand of the clarinetist in passing, and she smiles. Returning toward the stage, he acknowledges the timpanist, then the ﬁrst oboist, then motions for the clarinetist to rise and holds her hand up. She blushes. As he returns to the podium his face is gray with fatigue for a moment; he points with pride to the concertmaster and the ﬁrst cellist, who stand. He bows; he receives ﬂowers from a girl wearing a white dress with a redand-green ﬂoral print on it and kisses her hand. He motions for the orchestra as a whole to rise again, bows and turns to them, throwing the ﬂowers out one by one, and then as a bunch. For a moment Bernstein looks not seventy, but forty. He leaves the stage again and returns again, this time acknowledging the bassoonist and the pianist and reaching over one more time to congratulate the clarinetist. The pianist puts a ﬂower in his lapel. As if suddenly seeing the moment as she will remember it years from now, the second oboist puts her head in her hands; a violinist looks down sadly, lost in thought, holding her violin and a ﬂower together, her blond hair hanging over her face. Bernstein makes a gesture to the orchestra like a prizeﬁghter at the end of a ﬁght. The audience continues to applaud. Another glimpse. This time it is from 1959, when West Side Story was still running on Broadway and he was in his second year as music director of the New York Philharmonic. “Everyone thinks they know what they mean by ‘classical’ music. But in fact we use that word because we can’t think of a better one,” he is telling the audience of ten-year-olds, who are dressed up in their best Sunday clothes and accompanied by their parents at a Young People’s Concert. Bernstein is dynamic and improbably handsome, and seems like he is in his own living room. In fact he does not appear to be performing at all, but simply to be completely engrossed in his subject—the subject of what is meant by the term “classical music.” He shows how inadequate the other terms besides “classical” are—“art music,” “symphonic 4\n\ni ntroducti on\n\nmusic,” “highbrow music,” “serious music,” reserving particular scorn for the word “good”: “Well, we all know that there is ‘good’ Beethoven, and there is ‘good’ Spike Jones, and they are both good in their way. So we’re certainly not going to use that word ‘good.’” He goes on to say that one aspect of so-called classical music is that it can’t be changed—it is exact music— with tempo, dynamics, and phrasing carefully written down by the composer. Saying that it is ﬁxed in all these ways that, say, the McHugh/Fields song “I Can’t Give You Anything but Love” is not and isn’t meant to be, he proceeds to sing the song in the style of Louis Armstrong and then Fred Waring, stirring delight in the audience and a ripple of amusement in the viola section behind him. (It is a throwback to his early teenage years, when he would entertain his father’s friends by improvising in many styles.) Then he returns to his original subject that “classical” is the wrong word because “classical” properly refers to a speciﬁc period and place—eighteenth-century Europe— when the effort to create a perfection of form, modeled on that of the ancient Greeks, was paramount. He contrasts what was happening in America at the time—the struggle to create a new society in a savage land (there is an awkward reference to ﬁghting “Indians” here)—with the bringing to perfection of an older culture happening concurrently in Europe. Astonishingly, he then compares the construction of a fugue to building a Ferris wheel with an erector set, comparing the strands of counterpoint in the ﬁnale of Bach’s Fourth Brandenburg Concerto to metal beams, and the way they sound when they are all playing together to the spinning wheel on top. When the cellos, violas, and violins have illustrated their parts and he then has them all play together, the children are leaning forward in their chairs. He moves on to the later eighteenth century with a heart-tugging melody from the slow movement of Mozart’s C-Major Piano Concerto, K. 467, explaining that even though the aims of the generations immedi5\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nately after Bach changed (“as different as milk is from orange juice”), the devotion to perfection of form was still a constant. He conducts the Marriage of Figaro overture and then, performing the last movement of Haydn’s Symphony No. 102 in B-ﬂat Major, he digresses to the subject of humor in Haydn (“in music you can only make jokes about music”) and then doubles back to repeat part of the Mozart slow movement. The ineffable, indescribably tender music ﬂoats through the hall, deeply sad, yet weightless, luminous—not only nonverbal but without physical form, and gone as soon as he gives the musicians a cutoff. His voice gets quiet as he reminds the audience that the composers seeking perfection of form in this period are also full of emotion. All the great composers, regardless of idiom, “want to tell you something.” Nevertheless, he says, leaping forward to the next generation, in Beethoven the emotions are “bigger, and easier to see”; it is like “classical music under a magnifying glass.” Instead of simply being “gay,” it is “crazy with joy.” Romanticism is about being free with your emotions, “not so proper and shy, but telling your deepest feelings right away, without even thinking about whether you should.” He goes to the piano, plays part of a Chopin nocturne, then turns to conduct an intense passage from the slow movement of a Schumann symphony, his face furrowed with feeling. Some of the children in the hall are restive, but others are looking on with widened eyes, their heads propped on their hands. The Schumann is “burning, unashamed, real passion,” he is saying, adding that this “Romanticism” wasn’t a decision composers made, but rather a natural reﬂection of changes that were happening historically in the way people lived, thought, felt, and acted. And “it all started with that ‘classicist’ Beethoven. I guess you could say that he was a classicist who went too far. He was so full of feeling and emotion that he couldn’t keep himself chained up in all of those rules and regulations of the eighteenth century, and so he just 6\n\ni ntroducti on\n\nbroke his chains and started a whole new kind of music.” At the words “broke his chains,” Bernstein looks out at his audience and mimes breaking the chains. “And that was the end of ‘classical’ music.” Professionally Leonard Bernstein was a conductor, pianist, composer, and teacher. But he was also a powerful cultural and political voice and symbol, transcending all categories. Because he had an extravagantly extroverted temperament and a burning need to create as copious and varied a record of his work as he could; and because he lived during the heyday of the recording industry, at the dawn of the television era and of video recording, and before the advent of the Internet and e-mail correspondence, he left behind him what may well be the most extensive documentation in recordings, ﬁlms, and on paper of any musician in history. His archive at the Library of Congress already lists 400,000 items, upwards of 17,500 items in correspondence alone. Then there is the ever-expanding ﬁlm record, including countless musical performances, the programs he made for Omnibus, Ford Presents, and Lincoln Presents, the ﬁfty-three Young People’s Concerts, the six Norton Lectures, and numerous assorted additional documentaries (some two hundred hours in all, not counting concerts ﬁlmed for onetime broadcast that may or may not have been subsequently taped over), as well as the recordings, the books, the articles. And then there are his musical works: the works for Broadway, the symphonies, the choral music, the two operas, the songs, the piano pieces, the early chamber works. During the 1950s and 1960s Bernstein was not only the best known of all American classical musicians; he was almost as famous as Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe. The ﬁrst Americanborn and -trained conductor to rise to prominence, he was young, gifted, and explosively vital at just the right moment in history to be recognized and eventually put at the helm of a major orchestra, and he paved the way for all the American7\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nborn conductors who followed him. He was also the ﬁrst major American conductor to be recognized internationally. He had an immense following as a guest conductor, both before his assumption of the music directorship of the New York Philharmonic, where he presided for eleven years, and for the rest of his life, when his reputation only continued to rise. He conducted many thousands of concerts on every continent and in every major city in the world, over 1, 247 with the New York Philharmonic alone. He had special relationships with the Boston Symphony, the Israel Philharmonic, and, in the last two decades of his life, with the Vienna Philharmonic. He was also a superb pianist. He became a conduit to classical music to the millions who watched his Young People’s Concerts and Omnibus programs on television, and who read his books. He composed for both the Broadway stage and the concert hall. West Side Story ranks among the best-known works of musical theater by an American. All this presents a dizzying record of activities in a bewildering number of ﬁelds. No single book could even touch on all the major events in such a life, let alone be comprehensive. Like so many aspiring musicians who grew up in New York City in the 1950s, I went to Carnegie Hall and later to Lincoln Center to attend many of the early Young People’s Concerts. I watched the rest of them at home, on my family’s small blackand-white television screen, which was framed within a varnished wooden cabinet that had speakers on each side, little closing doors in front, and a rather rickety phonograph in a large, retractable lower drawer. When I sat at the piano making up my ﬁrst musical ideas (one couldn’t yet call them “compositions”), I had already encountered a great deal of music I would not otherwise have heard, had I not been a member of this “Bernstein generation.” My childhood friend Hank Chapin was close to Bernstein because of his father, Schuyler, who worked at Columbia Records and later at Bernstein’s Amber8\n\ni ntroducti on\n\nson Productions. On a few occasions in his family’s company, I saw the conductor ﬂeetingly at a restaurant, when he would appear, fresh from a performance at the Philharmonic, to have a late dinner, coffee, drink, and smoke at a distant table. At these moments, an electric current of excitement seemed to encircle his presence when he passed by and greeted us. Hank sang in the boys’ choir of Mahler’s Third Symphony and later narrated Benjamin Britten’s The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra at a Young People’s Concert, during which I sat in the front row of the audience. During my high school and college years, I returned to the Philharmonic to hear Bernstein conduct performances of Mahler, Beethoven, Ives, Stravinsky, and others. But my interests as a composer took a detour around Bernstein’s own music. In this I might have been inﬂuenced, at least to a degree, by the fact that he was never mentioned in any composition class or course I took on twentieth-century music. The only time I remember his name coming up in discussions with a musical mentor occurred in a conversation I had when I was in my early twenties with the great composer Roger Sessions. Sessions spoke of being aggrieved at the degree to which Bernstein had wasted his remarkable compositional talent, after producing such a ﬁne work as his Jeremiah Symphony at the age of twenty-ﬁve. He said that it was a shame that Bernstein had chosen “a life of fame and worldly success over one of achievement.” When I was close to ﬁfty I came upon a letter from Hank’s father in my parents’ papers, asking them if they wanted to bring me over to play some of my music for Mr. Bernstein. Schuyler had told him about my teenage compositions, and the maestro had expressed an interest in hearing them. Somehow that letter was never mentioned to me. If I had met Bernstein I probably would have been awed but reticent. While I was precocious in my musical efforts, I knew that I was not yet a 9\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\ncomposer. I now regret not hearing what he might have had to say to me. I can’t help wondering what advice he would have offered about musical study, about how to view a life in music, and about my sincere, if awkward, early compositions. During his lifetime Bernstein was easy to criticize because he was so visible, so outspoken, so dramatic, so active. His mistakes, when he made them, became public knowledge. Some people saw him as divided and conﬂicted, or as a person pursuing too many goals to achieve all of them well; others saw him as a man of myriad gifts, excelling in many areas. But even now there don’t seem to be many who have a tempered view of him. It remains hard to evaluate his work in an evenhanded way. Such a high degree of visibility has the paradoxical effect of being blinding. Furthermore, Bernstein was by nature theatrical and did not fade into the woodwork as some of our favorite intellectual ﬁgures do. He was no Franz Kafka, tormented in his social relationships and asking that his works be burned after his death. He also wasn’t Richard Rodgers, who, conventional-looking in a business suit, would not have stood out from a thousand other men on a subway platform waiting for a commuter train. He was more like a contemporary Franz Liszt, a personality on such a big scale that he would naturally manage to offend many people along the way. And his appetite for love was on a scale equal to Liszt’s own, as is now evident from the voluminous archive of love letters to him, from both men and women, at the Library of Congress. Many of his relationships were of the ﬂash-in-the-pan variety, but a surprising number turned into lifelong friendships. His self-regard and need for attention were also, to be sure, extreme. But if this was “narcissism,” it was of an unusual kind, since it was also counterbalanced by passionate interest in others, extraordinary powers of observation and memory about people, and insight into them. One has the impression that, while Bernstein often took up all 10\n\ni ntroducti on\n\nthe oxygen in a room, he had an equal need to breathe oxygen back into it. Conductor Carl St. Clair described how Bernstein the teacher would enter a classroom at Tanglewood and hug, touch, and embrace everyone in sight. “He needs that energy from people,” he wrote, “but whatever he takes from you, you get back with interest.”1 Sometimes it is hard to remember that Leonard Bernstein is no longer alive. Today, when we see him conducting or teaching on ﬁlm, his immediacy and communicative reach are such that he seems to leap out of the past into our present. It is sometimes difﬁcult to remember that, despite the voluminous external record he left behind, he was also just a man living his life from the inside, and that his life was as temporary as anyone else’s. This book attempts to capture some of the shape and some of the details of his life, while placing an emphasis on the music and musical thinking at its heart. The general public long ago intuited that, like his ancestor at the New York Philharmonic, Gustav Mahler, and his successor there, Pierre Boulez, Bernstein conducted, played, taught, and talked about music from the perspective of his more hidden life as a composer. In 1976 the peripatetic musician wrote, “Stillness is our most intense mode of action. . . . In stillness every human being is great; he is free from the experience of hostility; he is a poet, and most like an angel.”2\n\n11\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Dust 1918–1927\n\nWhen he was four years old, Leonard brought some balls of dust he had gathered from under the bed into the bathroom sink to see whether he could construct a man. He was still an only child, living with his parents in Revere, Massachusetts, above a tailor shop. He must have heard his father, who was always quoting from the Talmud or the Old Testament, saying “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return”; or perhaps it was that “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” Leonard put the dust into the bathroom sink, turned on the tap, and tried to mold the viscous blobs into lifelike forms. Then, as if in a bad dream, he couldn’t turn the faucets off. Not only did the sink overﬂow and ﬂood the bathroom ﬂoor, but the water then ﬂowed through the ceiling into the tailor shop below, destroying some suits and dresses, and resulting in embarrassment and expense for his struggling\n\n15\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nparents. Years later, recalling this, he said, “There was hell to pay.” But for the most part Leonard brought his parents joy. His birth brightened their world, and for a brief time it almost seemed as if his existence had made sense of their marriage. Russian Jews transplanted to Massachusetts, they were both suffering, although in different ways. Almost from the day Sam and Jennie married, on Sunday, October 28, 1917, it had become apparent that their outlooks did not mesh, and that they lacked a romantic bond which could smooth over their differences. In the year Leonard was four, their ﬁghting had even resulted in a two-week separation, and it was not the ﬁrst one. Sam (Shmuel) had been born in the town of Ozeryany, Ukraine, where his father, Yudel, was a scholar rabbi, the last in a long line of rabbis in the family tree.1 The oldest of four children, Sam spent his childhood on a farm in nearby Berezdov (Ukrainian: Berezdiv). Here his father studied and prayed while his mother did the physical work on the farm and brought up the children. Although Sam was deeply religious and a born scholar himself, he bridled against the claustrophobic narrowness of an environment in which he could be beaten simply if he let his skullcap fall off during evening prayers. He entered yeshiva and even contemplated becoming a rabbi but, at the age of thirteen, shortly after his bar mitzvah, started dreaming of following his cousin Herschel to the “golden country.” In 1903 Herschel had made the long journey from his hometown of Korets all the way to Hartford, Connecticut, where he changed his name to Harry Levy, married an American-born woman, Polly Kleiman, and became a barber. In 1908 Sam said goodbye to his two sisters and little brother and snuck out of the house at night, without saying goodbye to his parents, carrying only a few items of clothing and a blanket, with the sound of his siblings’ crying still in his ears. He was sixteen years old.2 The Atlantic crossing was a nightmare. A memory of the crowding, 16\n\ndus t\n\nﬁlth, vermin, bugs, excrement, and rotten food in the steerage hold stayed with him for the rest of his life. Leonard’s mother, Jennie, had been born Charna Resnick in the town of Shepetovka (Ukrainian: Shepetivka), only twentyone miles from Samuel’s home in Berezdov. She had been such a bright, lively, and imaginative child that her mother Perel had hired someone to tutor her in Russian and Hebrew, a rare privilege then for a girl. Family stories had her wandering off alone into the marketplace, and swimming where she wasn’t supposed to. She particularly loved music, and once followed an itinerant band of musicians—klezmers—into the gentile part of town, where she fell asleep in a park and had to be returned home by a policeman. Jennie’s ship crossing from Riga to New York in 1905 at the age of seven with her mother, younger brother, and younger sister was, like Sam’s, a horrendous three-week ordeal of hunger, fear, and pain, during which she endured a broken wrist and lay famished, surrounded by the sick and dying on the heaving boat, while her mother repeatedly begged the ocean to spare them. Once in America, the family was reunited with her father, Simcha, who now worked in the textile mills of Lawrence, Massachusetts. She was placed in the Lawrence Elementary School’s fourth grade at the age of only eight, and the next year she moved on to the Tarby School, where she did well enough to begin dreaming of someday becoming a teacher. But such aspirations were cut short when she was sent to work at the American Woolen Company to help support the family. There she experienced the appalling, often lethal conditions that precipitated the famous Lawrence Textile Strike, an uprising that eventually spread to the nine principal mills in the town and involved twenty-seven thousand workers.3 Jennie was an attractive and spirited young woman of eighteen when Samuel Bernstein ﬁrst visited her.4 Her parents had heard of his scholarly family even back in Ukraine. They admired his ambition and intelligence, and thought he had a fu17\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nture. In 1917, soon after buying Jennie an engagement ring, Sam was drafted into the army. Jennie had begun to appreciate his way with a joke and a story. She was touched seeing him in uniform marching down Essex Street, on his way to the train that would take him to Camp Devens. Not long after, when he was discharged due to poor eyesight and unexpectedly turned up in the Resnicks’ kitchen, Jennie found herself, to her own surprise, embracing and kissing him in front of everyone. A wedding date was set. At the time he married Jennie, Sam was working as an assistant manager at the Boston branch of Frankel and Smith, “suppliers of hair and beauty products.” He had gone from a job helping out his uncle Harry in his Hartford barbershop to a stock boy position with Frankel and Smith, from which he had worked his way up. Sam was devout, intense, rule-bound, sometimes harsh, like a “driven, diligent Horatio Alger hero,” as Burton Bernstein puts it in his book Family Matters. His principal reading matter and point of reference for all things, worldly and unworldly, was the Talmud. By contrast, with her own education cut short, Jennie’s “chief interests seemed to be food, the small available pleasure of life . . . movies and their celluloid celebrities, romantic novels . . . gossip with her coevals.”5 She dreamed of hobnobbing with elegant people and felt trapped by Sam’s “consuming ambition and penny pinching.” For his part, Sam had contempt for her family. In August 1918, late in her pregnancy, Jennie moved temporarily from Sam’s home in Chelsea to stay with her parents in Lawrence to await the birth. She went into labor at 3 a.m. on August 25 and was taken to Lawrenceville General Hospital, where, later in the morning, Leonard was born.6 He was a colicky little fellow with a “weak chest,” in Jennie’s words, but he was also a great joy to his parents, even if his asthma attacks kept his mother up long into the night taking care of him. 18\n\ndus t\n\nBy the time he was only a year and half, Leonard was already speaking so volubly that his parents dubbed him “the little old man.” His neighbors in Revere had a piano, and he became hungry for the sound of it, banging on their door, shouting for “moynik” (music). Jennie claimed years later that when the Victrola played at home—novelty songs such as “Oh by Jingo” or Jewish cantorial music—the little boy would become calm and stare out the window, drumming with his ﬁngers on the windowsills as if he were making the music himself. Having a son who might someday inherit his business made Sam redouble his own efforts at work, if such a thing were possible, and within a year he was the manager at Frankel and Smith. By 1923 he would have his own beauty supply business, the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company, on 59 Temple Place in Boston. By seizing the chance to acquire the exclusive New England franchise for the Frederics permanent wave machine, Sam rode the quest of the 1920s craze for curly hair. Trucks painted with the slogan “In Boston, it’s Bernstein—The Best in the Beauty Business” would travel throughout the metropolitan area, delivering his products to hairdressers, and a steady stream of merchants would line up at his store to buy wigs. Sam could be stern, judgmental, gloomy, and brooding, but he also had a playful side. He would dandle his son on his knee, singing “Ride away to Boston, / Ride away to Lynn, / You better be careful or you’ll fall in,” laughingly opening his legs as if to drop him. At a party, if Jewish music played, he would cut loose, dancing in the ecstatic Hasidic manner. Through whatever combination of genetics, inﬂuence, and personal experience forms personality, all the characteristic traits of this mismatched couple can be discerned in the adult Leonard Bernstein and in his music: the religiousness, studiousness, traditionalism, strength, rebelliousness, and dark moods of his father; the sociability, warmth, gaiety, love of glamour, and attraction to show business of his mother. Along with these traits 19\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nhe inherited the intelligence and social liberalism the couple shared. Bernstein’s childhood began on a footing that was unstable enough to account for his lifelong hunger for connection, particularly to his father, and his deep need for family. Even his tortured search for a lost faith could be traced to Sam’s combination of reverence for the Talmud with ﬂight from the constrictions of orthodoxy. Leonard had started life as an only child. On October 23, 1923, Jennie gave birth to Leonard’s younger sister, Shirley Anne. Brother Burton was born on January 31, 1932, when Leonard was thirteen. His parents made him, but it was with his two younger siblings that he formed the loving family he longed for.\n\n20\n\n2 A Piano 1928–Spring 1935\n\nIn 1923, the year Sam formed his own business and became the father of his second child, he also brought the family into the Mishkan Teﬁla Temple in Boston, which had built a “palatial synagogue” in a “monumental American Renaissance style” and was “the ﬁrst synagogue in Boston to align itself with the new religious movement known as Conservative Judaism.” The temple was a veritable symbol of what one Jewish newspaper called “the risen generation of the second migration,” Eastern European Jews who had come to America with nothing and managed to build small fortunes. Philosophically, the temple was explicitly oriented toward “Liberalism, Zionism, and Social Service.” By the time the Bernsteins became members, the temple boasted a magniﬁcent organ and an exceptional cantor.1 Eventually Sam became Mishkan Teﬁla’s vice president. Leonard began studying at the Hebrew school at age eight, and it was at temple that, at the age of ten, he was ﬁrst thun-\n\n21\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nderstruck by hearing live music. In 1928 the temple hired as music director a brilliant composer, organist, and conductor named Solomon Gregory Braslavsky (1887–1975), who had been a leading orchestral and choral conductor in Vienna and a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary there before coming to Boston. Braslavsky performed repertoire from every era at the temple, assigning Hebrew texts to works by Mendelssohn, Verdi, and Schubert for choir and organ, and adding his own compositions, such as his contrapuntal Adon ‘olam (“Lord of the World”), and the high holiday prayer Un’saneh tokef. When Leonard heard the cantor sing in his rich, sweet baritone, and the organ and choir join in, he became so overwhelmed with emotion that he would start to cry. He never forgot this music or Braslavsky, who became his ﬁrst musical mentor.2 In the same year that Braslavsky arrived in Boston, Aunt Clara’s piano arrived in the Bernstein household, an event that changed Leonard’s life forever. Clara, Sam’s sister, had come to America in 1911. She was an eccentric—a nutritionist, vegetarian, and nudist—with a commanding Wagnerian soprano voice, and when she married for the third time and moved to Brooklyn to run a bridal shop, she sent the Bernsteins a sofa and an old mahogany upright, with a middle “mandolin” pedal, that she no longer needed. From the moment he touched the piano, Leonard couldn’t tear himself away from it. Caressing the keys and causing the sounds to issue forth from the strings made the world, and his place in it, suddenly come into focus: “I suddenly felt at the center of a universe I could control, or at least be at the center of, in that I felt it revolving stably around me, instead of [my] being tossed around in it, which I had felt up until then. . . . I was safe at the piano.”3 He began to play constantly, disturbing the peace of the household. He picked out “Goodnight, Sweetheart” by himself and quickly learned to read music notation under the guidance of a beautiful 22\n\na pi a no\n\nand exotic-looking girl in the neighborhood named Frieda Karp, who played well enough to give him lessons for a dollar each. It soon became evident that he had an exceptional ear and an instinctive grasp of theory. Without knowing the proper names of chords, he made up his own system of harmony and could soon improvise plausibly on songs he heard on the radio, such as Irving Berlin’s “Blue Skies.” After only a year he was playing Bach preludes, Mendelssohn’s “Spring Song,” and other selections from a green-covered anthology called 100 Pieces the Whole World Loves, which ﬁfty years later he would still carry with him wherever he traveled. His father was willing to pay the dollar per lesson but was less than enthused about the piano playing itself, and he often shouted from his bedroom when it got too late at night. His mother was drawn to the music, as she had been attracted to the wandering klezmers as a child, and when Leonard played Chopin’s Nocturne in E-ﬂat Major, op. 9, no. 2, she would stand by the piano and weep.4 When he started composing his own pieces at around the age of twelve, he would play them for her in different versions and ask her which she liked best. His relationship with his father, however, was often fraught. Sam was subject to black moods and to bursts of temper. At least once Leonard interposed himself between Jennie and Sam during a heated argument, when Sam began to angrily chase after her, holding a raised bottle. Sometimes Leonard would hide under the dining room table when Sam came home. By contrast, the happy marriage and healthy, laugh-ﬁlled atmosphere of family get-togethers at Uncle Harry Levy’s home in Hartford left an indelibly positive impression on young Leonard. It was the one place where his parents seemed to relax and enjoy themselves. Moreover, there, on Harry’s expensive Victrola, Leonard fell in love with Rosa Ponselle’s rendition of the dramatic aria “Suicidio!” from Ponchielli’s La Gioconda, Zez Confrey’s piano solo “Kitten on the Keys,” and W. C. Polla’s 23\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\n“Dancing Tambourine,” which he analyzed as a “March made into a novelty piece,” an early instance of his stylistic acumen. Leonard’s playing soon outstripped that of his teacher—he was “reading a Chopin ballade she could barely play herself,” he recalled later—and she suggested that he seek instruction at the New England Conservatory. The teacher he found there, Susan Williams, started him on music that surpassed in complexity anything he had yet encountered, Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsodies. Fighting with Sam over the increased cost of the lessons forced him to earn money giving lessons to small children himself, as well as to start playing for weddings with two friends who played saxophone and drums. While Miss Williams ultimately proved an unreliable guide in terms of piano technique, she must have recognized the promise in his playing, since she placed the thirteen-year-old last in her student concert program of March 30, 1932, performing the Brahms Rhapsody in G Minor. No doubt the ﬁery music he was learning inﬂuenced his ﬁrst unﬁnished attempt at composing, a Piano Concerto in C Minor he dubbed “The Russian–Gypsy War.” Siblings Leonard, Shirley, and Burton adored each other, forming a kind of independent minifamily of their own, with Leonard as the “father” in the constellation. By the time she was eight, Shirley was studying the piano under her brother’s tutelage, and they were able to play through four-hand arrangements of Beethoven symphonies together. (They had volume 2: symphonies 6 through 9.) She was so talented that they were soon singing through entire operas together, she taking the female roles, he taking the male ones (in his enthusiastic but terrible voice), and both singing the choruses. He, rather than her parents, became the person she most wanted most to please. The two had an exceptional camaraderie and closeness that continued throughout their lives and ultimately eclipsed\n\n24\n\na pi a no\n\nher other relationships with men. Despite many romances in later life, Shirley, who later worked in theater and television production and as a literary agent, never married and was candid about the fact that she hadn’t found a man who interested her to the degree her brother had. Leonard and a neighbor, Eddie Ryack, created an imaginary country, “Rybernia” (an amalgamation of their names), with leaders (themselves), a national anthem, and a language based on their parents’ Yiddish and garbled English, and, with the heedless cruelty of youth, words based on the speech patterns of a local boy with a harelip. The language included a riotous collection of parental expressions such as “How you gonna did it?” and “smose snapas seven” (“almost half-past seven”).5 The three Bernstein children expressed their Americanness and independence from their immigrant parents by speaking “Rybernian” as a private code that they maintained throughout their lives. Another citizen of Rybernia was Sid Ramin, an extraordinarily musical boy just a few months younger than Leonard who lived down the street. Leonard met Sid at age ﬁfteen and taught him piano and his own version of “harmony.” Ramin would remain a lifelong friend and became a masterful musician who co-orchestrated West Side Story, A Quiet Place, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and innumerable works by composers other than Bernstein. The two boys would take long walks almost every day, and Sid would mainly listen as Leonard expounded on everything under the sun. Ramin attended Leonard’s bar mitzvah in 1931 at Temple Mishkan Teﬁla and was amazed, along with the congregation, by his friend’s poise and eloquence. Instead of one of the standard prepared speeches, Leonard delivered “an articulate and personally crafted” one of his own that the headmaster of the Hebrew school, Solomon\n\n25\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nZuckrow, had helped him translate into Hebrew.6 Samuel was so proud of his son that he bought him a baby grand piano as a present. Leonard exuded conﬁdence. One day he and Ramin were walking down Abbotsford Street in Roxbury when they heard a woman practicing the piano, repeatedly stumbling over the same passage. Leonard bounded onto her porch, climbed in her window (which was next to the piano), sat down next to her, and played the piece through for her, saying, “This is how it is supposed to go.” She was so dumbfounded that she couldn’t even catch her breath before he had bounded out again. Ramin also witnessed Leonard’s bond with his sister. He remembers climbing upstairs with Leonard and tiptoeing into ten-year-old Shirley’s room while she was sleeping. Awed by her mystery, Leonard held her ﬁnger, to see whether he could tell from that what she was dreaming.7 In 1929 Leonard ﬁnished sixth grade at the W. L. Garrison School and began studying at the prestigious Boston Latin School, where he was to stay six years. Boston Latin was the oldest public school in the United States, a kind of poor boy’s Andover or Exeter, known for its rigorous classical training. It accepted students from all walks of life, but the workload was so arduous and the school’s standards so high that only one in three students who entered it made it to graduation. In his years there Leonard received the “Modern Prize” for the highest combined grade average, the “Reading Prize,” and the “Classics Prize” (he had to translate an average of forty lines of Latin a night), and he participated in the French Club, the Physics Club, and the Glee Club. At the weekly assemblies during his senior year, after the Old Testament reading by the headmaster, he would often play the piano. That year he received a prize for excellence in music and cowrote the class song, “All for One, and One for All.” But his real musical development occurred outside of school, ﬁrst in his piano studies 26\n\na pi a no\n\nwith a new teacher and secondly in what must have seemed at the time a mere recreation, the informal theatrical productions he mounted with friends. In October 1932 one of Leonard’s ﬁrst girlfriends, a talented pianist named Mildred Spiegel, whose family had a Baldwin grand on which he practiced, suggested that he audition for Heinrich Gebhard, one of the best-known piano teachers in Boston. Gebhard was encouraging but referred him to his assistant, Helen Coates. It was an important encounter. Coates was a tall, disciplined, rather prim woman eighteen years older than Leonard (just one year short of his mother’s age). She was perhaps the ﬁrst person who fully recognized how exceptional his musical abilities were. Leonard’s playing was passionate but unruly. She would sit at the adjoining piano, teaching him, as he later put it, “how not to bang, [how] to use the pedal discreetly, how to discipline [his] crazed and raging ﬁngers.”8 He was a superb sight-reader, learned music faster than any student she had ever had, and had an insightful responsiveness to everything she taught. In her chaste, protective, and maternal way, Coates was in love with him. She soon put his lessons at the end of the day so that they could stretch out as long as they needed to, including time for him to play his arrangements of Russian and Hebrew melodies, so that she could help him notate them. The lessons broadened his musical world and emboldened him as a composer. Over time, Helen Coates became Bernstein’s lifelong secretary and “keeper of the ﬂame.” When he started to perform in recitals in 1933, she began to compile the ﬁrst in a series of scrapbooks containing announcements, programs, articles, and reviews of her student’s music and performances; these would eventually chronicle ﬁfty-ﬁve years of his professional life. It wasn’t until the spring of 1932 that Leonard ﬁrst heard a live orchestra. Surprisingly, he was seated next to his father. The event was a Boston Pops concert conducted by Arthur 27\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nFiedler, held to beneﬁt the Histadrut, the Zionist trade union movement in Palestine, for which Temple Mishkan Teﬁla had reserved a few tables. The concert left him crazed with excitement, particularly the performance of Ravel’s Bolero that closed the program. After that, as often as Leonard could manage to squeeze ticket money out of his father, he started to attend Boston Symphony programs, either with Sid Ramin or with Mildred. He had a second musical epiphany when he heard Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. His father gave him the two dollars to purchase the sheet music, and he marked up his copy so that he and Ramin could play it as a four-hands piano piece. While Sam shared Leonard’s enthusiasm for Bolero, he was adamantly opposed to his thinking of music as a career. The only musicians in his experience had been the klezmers of the shtetl. It had taken every ounce of his strength to pull himself out of the poverty of shtetl life and up from the squalor of his ﬁrst days in New York, when he had spent twelve hours a day cleaning ﬁsh in the Fulton Fish Market. He had seized on every opportunity that had come his way to move up the ladder of the beauty supply business and to establish a decent and stable life for his family. That his ﬁrst-born son would scorn all his efforts and not continue to build on his achievements was unthinkable to him. When Leonard performed the ﬁrst movement of the Grieg Piano Concerto with the Boston Public School Symphony at Roxbury High School on May 14, 1934, Sam did not attend.9 Helen Coates wrote to Sam of her disappointment at not seeing him there, and on July 20, 1934, she received a reply typed on his business stationery, with “Samuel Bernstein Hair Company / 480 Washington Street” emblazoned at its top: Miss Helen G. Coates: While I am conﬁdent of his progress in his music education, I shall want him to continue to treasure his accomplishments in the connection solely from an idealistic viewpoint. Not-\n\n28\n\na pi a no withstanding my respect for a professional career in the musical world, from a practical standpoint I prefer that he does not regard his music as a future means of maintenance.10\n\nSam’s business was among those that, like the ﬁlm industry, not only did not succumb to the Depression but actually ﬂourished during it. The rise of his fortunes enabled him to build a small summer house on Lake Massapoag, in Sharon, Massachusetts. It was there, in the summer of 1934, that Leonard organized his ﬁrst theatrical production, a drastically cut and rewritten, cross-dressing Carmen performed by neighborhood kids. Leonard was Carmen in a red wig and black mantilla, his friend Beatrice Gordon was Don Jose, and a Boston Latin schoolmate, Dana Schnittken, was Micaëla, wearing blond tresses supplied by Sam. Leonard spearheaded every aspect of the production, taught all the parts individually, and played the piano. Since much of the libretto included interpolations in Yiddish, or references to local events and people, he also wrote a helpful synopsis for ten-year-old Shirley to read as a prologue. By the following summer, the entire neighborhood looked forward to the young musician’s next venture, which turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Mikado. Leonard again took responsibility for every aspect of the production, from trimming the score, casting it, and getting props and scenery taken care of, to teaching everyone their parts in his “raw and unappealing voice,” as one participant later described it, as well as playing the piano. He sang Nanki-Poo, and eleven-year-old Shirley was Yum-Yum. Seventy years later, members of the troupe in their late eighties remembered the Sharon productions with emotion as giving everyone a goal for the summer, and their leader as having extraordinary charm, energy, a joyful spirit, and seemingly endless patience. He had the gift of being able to galvanize them all with his enthusiasm and determination. Leonard was physically attracted to both sexes. While he\n\n29\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nhad a series of girlfriends, among them the young pianist Mildred Spiegel; his “matador” Beatrice Gordon (whom he called “Tiger on Brocade,” an anagram of her name); and petite, darkhaired Elaine Newman, who looked like Loretta Young and with whom he acted out scenes from Noel Coward’s Private Lives, he could also be smitten with his male companions in a romantic way. When he was passionately drawn to someone— as he often was—his impulse was the same, regardless of gender. At sixteen, in his last year at Boston Grammar, he wrote a school essay titled “Friends and Freud” in which, under the guise of discussing what he had gleaned about Freud’s views on homosexuality, he seemed to be trying to sort out his feelings: Most people have experienced, at some time during their adolescence, the psychological sublimation of consuming friendship . . . that companionship which has so exaggeratively [sic] theorized by the doctrinaire Freud as love between two members of one sex. . . . It seems to me that Freud has unnecessarily placed the subject in a decidedly unclear light which tends to affect destructively the relations of youth. . . . Why should beautiful relationships like these be smutted with talk of abnormality?11\n\nLater in life, when he underwent psychoanalysis and came to admire Freud deeply, he surely came upon the psychoanalyst’s 1915 observation that “by studying sexual excitations other than those that are manifestly displayed, it has [been] found that all human beings are capable of making a homosexual objectchoice, and have in fact made one in their unconscious.”12 In the spring of 1935 Leonard was accepted into Harvard University. Sid Ramin remembers standing with him on the street when he announced his plan to acquire a Harvard accent, which indeed he did.\n\n30\n\n3 Harvard Fall 1935–Spring 1939\n\nDuring the years that Leonard attended Harvard, he not only developed a “cultivated” accent but also encountered many of the ideas and met many of the people who would inﬂuence him for the rest of his life. Indeed, his trajectory through the school foreshadowed the meteoric rise, high accomplishments, and some of the difﬁculties of his future years. But when he arrived there he was only an aspiring pianist seeking a liberal arts education. Being a conductor couldn’t have been further from his mind, and he had composed no music of his own other than the 1935 class song for the Boston Latin School, “All for One, and One for All,” and a small psalm setting for voice and piano. But, as his friend Mildred Spiegel put it with considerable understatement, Leonard “never hid his light under a bushel,” and from the beginning he was a star at Harvard, bursting with energy and opinions, and becoming quickly known as a pia-\n\n31\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nnist. Friends from the time describe him as commandeering the piano at every party (not unlike George Gershwin, who was likewise magnetized by the presence of the instrument). He would often walk in the front door and go directly to the piano, simply moving aside whoever might have gotten there ﬁrst. He had a seemingly endless repertoire of popular songs and lighter pieces in his memory and ﬁngertips. He would play boogie-woogie, Chopin, and light classics such as Ernesto Lecuona’s “Malagueña.” Often he could be found there hours later, still wearing his overcoat, playing passionately, with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. (He had started smoking at the age of fourteen.) Throughout his life he never required much sleep. If he was not at a party, he would spend long hours drinking beer into the night with friends at the dorm, discussing God, art, politics, and sex. According to Spiegel, he “became bored if made to have a regimented existence,” and he always seemed to need to have many projects going at once, not necessarily including homework.1 He was irregular in his attendance of classes and an inveterate procrastinator, yet he tended to do brilliantly. Friends from the time later remembered his habit of waiting until the last day to write an assigned essay, tearing his hair out, deciding to address another topic entirely rather than the assigned one, writing feverishly through the night, and ending up getting an A. While classmates struggled on the four-part harmony exercises assigned in A. Tillman Merritt’s counterpoint and harmony course, he completed them swiftly, with an ease and skill that far outstripped theirs. He loved to be the center of attention, even if it meant being obnoxious. He once derailed an entire session of Merritt’s class with his stubborn insistence that Bach should have notated a G-sharp as an A-ﬂat. Toward the end of term, having been an intermittent participant in the course at best, he suddenly showed up to play a dissonant, dancelike piano piece he had composed, rather than the study 32\n\nha rva rd\n\nin sixteenth-century counterpoint that was due. When Merritt said, “Well, Leonard, this is not exactly what we are doing in this class,” Leonard “banged his ﬁst loudly on the piano and said, ‘Well, I like it!’”2 As of freshman year, Leonard was now studying piano regularly with Heinrich Gebhard, and he continued to do so until graduation. Among Leonard’s many performances as an undergraduate were the Ravel Concerto in G Major, Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, and the Grieg Concerto, with the Massachusetts State Symphony, all sponsored by the Federal Works Progress Administration, and solo music by Bach, Chopin, Liszt, Brahms, Debussy, Ravel, and Hindemith. He was praised in the press for “authority, ease and clarity” in the Ravel and “virtuosic brilliance and profound interpretation” in the Grieg. Response to the Gershwin was more muted, with one critic calling it “adequate” and another as “hardly up to those we are in the habit of hearing.” Leonard was headstrong and on his own schedule, but he was also a born student, and one with charm, depth, and a hunger for fatherly understanding and guidance. In the space of only a few years, many father ﬁgures did appear in his life who sought not only to guide him but also saw him as a friend. One of his mentors at Harvard was a philosophy teacher named David Prall, who taught courses in aesthetics. Leonard attended Prall’s classes more consistently than he did the music courses, and also became a regular at the informal discussion groups Prall held at his home, which were sometimes also attended by the young painter Robert Motherwell and future literary scholar Harry Levin. In his lectures Prall was able to draw the kinds of connections between the arts, and to express a view of the way the arts combined the intellectual and the sensual, that must have conﬁrmed Leonard in his own creative outlook. One can see the traces of Prall’s thinking in Bernstein’s scripts for the Young People’s Concerts of many years 33\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nlater, and in the worldview behind the Norton Lectures given when he returned to Harvard in 1973. Deeply knowledgeable about music (his sister was a music professor at Mills College in California), Prall had a great gift for explicating its surface. But he also abhorred the idea of making art into an abstraction that could be separated from lived experience. He was an intellectual who, in a manner surprising for an academic, included the body and the senses in his consideration and valuation of art: “Written music . . . offers to the technically trained musician the very structure of the beauties he silently hears. . . . [But when the music is actually played] the most gifted composer has a new experience of his music, in which it takes on its proper sensuous proportions and achieves its full volume and richness and the precise speciﬁc quality that is given to the outer ear, and never its absolutely full, intricate, subtle tonal quality to the inner ear, the ‘ear of the mind.’” He discussed the elements of an art form’s language in physical terms, emphasizing, for example, that the swiftness or slowness of a rhythm cannot be measured in absolute terms but only in “relation to the time-rates of human processes, breathing, pulse, and other organic functions which are beyond our conscious control.”3 Prall further stimulated an interest in the world of the ancient Greeks, which Leonard had ﬁrst developed at Boston Latin and which would bear fruit in his incidental music for Aristophanes’s The Birds and The Peace, as well as in his 1954 Serenade.4 As Leonard frequently reminded his own students in later life, the words to “learn” and to “teach” are one and the same in many languages. Burton Bernstein was on the receiving end of Leonard’s compulsion to teach almost from the moment he learned to talk, and he received his own “Harvard education” by proxy when he was only four or ﬁve, during his brother’s weekend visits. As bedtime stories he learned about intervals, 34\n\nha rva rd\n\nthe modes, and the circle of ﬁfths, and then he went to sleep to the sounds of Leonard practicing the Ravel Concerto or some other difﬁcult work in the living room below. (He eventually became a staff writer at the New Yorker and the author of nine books.) In the summer of his freshman year, Leonard again mounted a production in Sharon, this time of Gilbert and Sullivan’s HMS Pinafore, with Mildred Spiegel as Buttercup and interpolated music from Aida, to which Shirley and two neighborhood girls performed “Egyptian dances” choreographed by Leonard. When not playing Pinafore on the piano, Leonard would sit on the porch listening rapturously to Indian music on a small phonograph, exclaiming, “Isn’t this wonderful? I could have an orgasm!”5 In his junior year Leonard met another talented young composer, Harold Shapero, who was a freshman. The two young men discovered that their families lived just a few houses from each other in Newton, and soon they were spending long hours at the library listening to music together.6 During vacation, in one of their conversations after playing catch in Leonard’s backyard, they discussed their ambitions. Harold said that he wanted to win the hearts of as many girls as he could. Leonard said that he wanted everyone in the world to love him. Leonard borrowed all the four-hand music the library owned, and soon they were playing through arrangements of Beethoven, Mozart, and Schubert symphonies together. Leonard would get them jobs playing concerts and entertaining at suburban parties as a four-hand and two-piano team. They eventually played more than twenty concerts together, performing Hindemith’s Sonata for Piano, Four Hands; Stravinsky’s Concerto for Two Pianos; Mozart’s complex Sonata for Keyboard FourHands in F Major, K. 497; and a work considered a classic today, Shapero’s own Sonata for Piano, Four Hands, which was dedicated to Leonard. They would also sometimes play musi35\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\ncal pranks at the expense of their listeners. One involved ﬂatting all the dominants in a Mozart four-hand sonata, so that the music came out sounding “like Grieg.” On another occasion they improvised compositions on the spot that were listed in the program as works by Prokoﬁev and Shostakovich. Shapero found Leonard to be endlessly fascinated with matrimony and attracted to couples as a pair, and he later recounted an incident hinging on this that scarred their friendship. After their most prestigious concert, at the Boston Institute of Modern Art, at which Shapero’s marvelous sonata had received its premiere, they were treated to a fancy dinner. When Leonard started to ﬂirt and “smooch” with the wife of a guest, the more prudish Shapero whispered words of disapproval to him, at which point Leonard slapped him. The slap— hard enough to startle, but not to hurt—was utterly uncharacteristic of him. Leonard listened to as much modern music as he could, and he had a remarkable ability not only to remember it but also to penetrate its inner workings and grasp its technical means. To earn extra money he played for silent ﬁlms. An audience of a thousand Harvard students gave him a standing ovation at the end of his accompaniment for Sergei Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin, in which he improvised for over an hour, rifﬁng on Stravinsky’s Petrushka, jumping from one Russian folk song to another, and managing to hold his on-the-spot soundtrack together with aplomb. Leonard already adored Prokoﬁev’s Classical Symphony and Stravinsky’s Le Sacre du Printemps when an older Harvard friend, Arthur Berger—who was later to become a distinguished composer, professor at Brandeis, and a founder of the journal Perspectives of New Music—took him to the Cambridge music store Briggs and Briggs to listen to a recording of Aaron Copland playing his Piano Variations. Leonard was bowled over by this oracular, stark, and dissonant work and was deter36\n\nha rva rd\n\nmined to learn it. Since he couldn’t afford the sheet music himself, David Prall bought it for him, encouraging him to write a paper about the work for class. Leonard soon had the piece memorized, and it was added to his “party pieces,” albeit one that, as he frequently joked, would “clear the room.” He had a vision of Copland as a bearded patriarch. Leonard couldn’t afford a full subscription to the Boston Symphony, but by sharing one he attended concerts every other week. As luck would have it, in January, during midterm week, he attended the American conducting debut of the inspiring Greek conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos. On the program was Mitropoulos’s string orchestra arrangement of Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 14 in C-sharp Minor, op. 131.7 There are several competing accounts of Bernstein’s meeting with the charismatic conductor, but however they met, their connection, as so many connections seemed to be for the younger musician, was personal, resulting in an invitation for Leonard to watch him rehearse with the Boston Symphony. This was the ﬁrst time Leonard grasped how a conductor worked with musicians, and what his role entailed. The older man listened to Leonard play some of his ﬁrst compositions and thought him destined for greatness. (Mitropoulos was himself a composer as well as a conductor.) The two subsequently exchanged intense, confessional letters and at one point spent two weeks together in Minneapolis, but it appears doubtful that the two became lovers, despite the implications of a mutual attraction in a ﬁctional account Leonard wrote about their meeting, called “The Occult.” In spring term of his sophomore year Leonard completed a work for a piano trio that Mildred Spiegel had formed with two friends, Dorothy Rosenberg and Sarah Kruskall. Despite its polyglot mix of inﬂuences and some compositional loose ends, the work makes a conﬁdent impression. The ﬁrst movement begins strikingly, with a passionate, Hebraic lyricism reminis37\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\ncent of Ernest Bloch. Its angular and almost atonal ideas are then taken on a somewhat discursive journey, through harmonic territories suggestive of Scriabin and Ravel, with quite a bit of imitative counterpoint along the way. (In fact, some of the music appears to have been drawn from exercises written for counterpoint class.) A few climaxes hearken back to Brahms and Tchaikovsky. By contrast, the witty and ebullient middle movement, a marchlike scherzo, has both moment-to-moment appeal and consistency. Apart from a few Gershwinesque turns of phrase, it sounds Russian in character, and its piquant modern tonality—not too far from that of Prokoﬁev—is handled with deftness. The ﬁnale returns to themes from both movements but suggests that the composer has grown since writing the ﬁrst one, managing a reconciliation between its transparent French textures and the Russian/Hebraic materials. The ﬁnal cadence is ingenious. With its directness, concision, and clarity of expression, the work was an early sign that, for all his bravado and distractibility, writing music drew a kind of purity and even restraint out of the nineteen-year-old composer. He may have been an inveterate show-off at a party, but on paper he was precise and serious.8 In the summer of 1937 Leonard had his ﬁrst summer job, as music counselor at the all-Jewish Camp Onota, in Pittsﬁeld, Massachusetts, where he taught the campers rounds and campﬁre songs, led a small band, and music directed the summer show. On July 11, during parents’ weekend, he was asked to play the piano during lunch. At ﬁrst he declined. But when the news came over the radio of George Gershwin’s sudden death of a brain tumor at age thirty-nine, he went to the piano in the noisy mess hall, played a loud chord, silenced the campers and their parents, and announced that “America’s greatest Jewish composer” had died. He then played Gershwin’s Prelude No. 2, experiencing an almost eerie sense of identiﬁcation with the composer. A month later he made an ingenious arrangement 38\n\nha rva rd\n\nof Rhapsody in Blue for a motley collection of camp musicians playing clarinet, recorder, accordion, two ukuleles, percussion, and piano solo, with an additional part for three male singers. Later that summer a brilliant, eccentric, theater-loving young man from the Bronx named Adolph Green, who could do imitations of Al Jolson, recite Kipling’s “Gunga Din” and endless numbers of other poems by heart, and was reputed to have a photographic memory for music, came up to the camp from New York to play the role of the Pirate King in Pirates of Penzance. Leonard greeted Adolph by dragging him instantly into the mess hall, where, on an old upright piano, he played the old Harold Shapero prank of performing a brilliant ﬁveminute “prelude by Shostakovich,” asking him whether he had heard it. When Green replied that, surprisingly, he didn’t ﬁnd it familiar, Leonard threw his arms around him, saying that he was the ﬁrst person who had admitted not knowing it. (The music was, of course, Bernstein’s own.) Their friendship was immediate and always remained a central one for both of them.9 Fortuitous meetings seemed to proliferate throughout his undergraduate years. November 14, 1937, became a banner day in Leonard’s life when he found himself seated next to Aaron Copland himself in the balcony of a dance debut by Anna Sokolow at the Guild Theatre in New York. Since it was Copland’s thirty-seventh birthday, he invited everyone in the row over to his loft for a party afterward, whereupon Leonard sat down at the piano and performed the Piano Variations for him by heart. The composer was astonished by Leonard’s playing, by his lively personality, and by the “sheer amount of information about music new and old, and not only about music” that the eighteen-year-old knew. For his part, Leonard thought that the man he already considered America’s greatest composer was “about the most sensational human being I’d ever come across.”10 39\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nWhen he heard Copland’s new, exuberant El salón México in 1938, he was as bowled over as he had been by the Variations, this time by the snazzy orchestration, gemlike construction, and joyful inventiveness, which made the work what he called in a letter to Copland “a perfect roller-coaster ride.” “It’s a secure feeling to know we have a master in America,” he wrote, railing against those who couldn’t see that “a composer is just as serious when he writes a work, even if the piece is not defeatist . . . and weltschmerzy and misanthropic and long.”11 He was so taken with El salón México that he made himself a solo piano version to play. Leonard absorbed lessons and techniques from both sides of Copland’s music. The spare four-note opening of the Piano Variations, as stern as the beginning of Beethoven’s Fifth, yet somehow so “American,” was an object lesson in leanness, in the power of just the right notes at the right time. Copland managed to derive every bit of this work from its opening eleven measures. This was multum in parvum, as they would have said at Boston Latin, “much from little.” This quality of stark, surprising speciﬁcity was the ﬁnding of what Nadia Boulanger, Copland’s teacher, used to call “la note choisie” (the chosen note). Like the uncluttered prose of E. B. White, Thornton Wilder, or Robert Frost, or the plain frankness of an Edward Hopper or Georgia O’Keeffe painting, Copland’s music was suggestive of the relative newness of the nation, of its geographical openness, its rawness and lack of pretense, and of a kind of barrenness—an American loneliness. For all his apparent unruliness, Bernstein had a fastidious mind. His ﬁrst compositions were already notable for their transparency of texture. Looking at Copland and showing him his ﬁrst music solidiﬁed his own tendency to an uncluttered kind of writing and allied him more with the Francophile neoclassical Boulanger school of composition (which included, along with Copland, Virgil Thomson, Roy Harris, Elliott Carter, and dozens 40\n\nha rva rd\n\nmore young Americans), than with the denser, thornier, more chromatic and introspective Austro-German school. Without knowing it, he was like a Boulanger student, at one remove. Bernstein was also fascinated by Copland’s rhythms, by the way idiomatic folk and popular tunes could be woven into the fabric of a complex work such as El salón México, generating such vibrancy and immediacy with their syncopations, irregular meters, asymmetrical phrase structures, and those moments when two competing beat patterns were superimposed. Copland was able to distill his folk sources and modify them, and to invent his own ideas modeled upon them, so that they could be extended into symphonic structures. Leonard also thought that the elements that seemed so distinctively American in Copland’s work all bore some relationship, however distant, to the elements of jazz. Ideas of this kind would eventually generate the premise behind his undergraduate thesis. Around this time, Leonard started writing about music for the Harvard Advocate, where he was music editor, and for the important New York music journal Modern Music. In his article “Boston Carries On,” in Modern Music on May 6, 1938, he wrote cockily that Prokoﬁev’s ﬁrst piano concerto “shows up wretchedly” compared with that composer’s ballet Chout, adding, “Truly it is not a good piece . . . its one real tune is worked to death.” But he also shrewdly noted that, due paradoxically to Prokoﬁev’s very inability “to write profoundly tragic music,” his rendering of Romeo’s grief at Juliet’s grave in Romeo and Juliet has its own “very strange beauty.” About his teacher Walter Piston’s ﬁrst symphony, given its premiere at the same concert, he wrote that, despite its ﬁne lyrical sense, expert orchestration, and masterly construction, “adverse criticisms were profuse and diverse: some thought the Largo unduly long and uninteresting; others found the work lacking emotional appeal.” At some point in his junior year, Leonard started working on a Piano Sonata dedicated to his piano teacher, Heinrich 41\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nGebhard. A kind of improvisatory fantasy in two movements, the darkly introspective sonata shows surprising authority and craft, if not yet a uniﬁed style. The work derives all its ideas from those stated at the outset: a spiky, ﬂeet-ﬁngered passage reminiscent of Copland; a hortatory chordal statement in a minor key that sounds like Scriabin; a tone row; and some angular, jazzy ﬁgurations in the spirit of Gershwin. (It is worth noting that the three musical role models evoked by these materials shared Leonard’s Russian ancestry.) In the lyrical slow movement, the shape of the long, continuous melody and the way in which the asymmetrical rhythms of the chords in the accompaniment break up 4/4 time into unequal eighth-note groups inaugurate a dancelike lilt characteristic of so many passages in Leonard’s future music—whether slow or fast. Unlike the Piano Trio, the sonata maintains its unsettled, brooding tone throughout; after ﬁfteen minutes it slows to a bleak standstill, ending with the tone row in isolated pitches in the upper register. Leonard’s senior year was a time of burgeoning interests and startling accomplishments. To begin with there was his thesis, which took as its central proposition the bold (and unHarvardian) notion that jazz was the ﬁrst truly American music to have penetrated into the soul of the people to the degree that it could constitute the foundation of a national idiom. His position was argued with considerable speciﬁcity. Beginning with comments on musical “nationalism” generally, he distinguished between a superﬁcial kind, in which folk music is cited or quoted without affecting the overall language of the music, and a more “spiritual” one, in which the smallest elements and the very cut of the form are permeated with the folk traditions of a given culture. He argued that, unlike hymnody, American Indian music, or other folk music, speciﬁc elements derived from jazz, such as the blues scale and the syncopated rhythms originally associated with an explicit beat (but 42\n\nha rva rd\n\nnot dependent on one), had seeped into the metaphorical soil in which the ﬁrst uniquely American concert music was growing. (In a letter, Copland approved of his musical examples but—characteristically—advised him not to “try to prove too much.”) In making this case, Leonard dismissed many nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American composers in such general terms that one exasperated faculty reader scrawled on the manuscript: “What sweeping criticism! I wonder what critics in 1975 will have to say on young American composers of 1938!”12 He was still hard at work on his thesis when he was asked to serve as composer, music director, and conductor for an undergraduate production of Aristophanes’s comedy The Birds, to be given by the Harvard Classical Club at Sanders Theatre in April. The musical score for The Birds built on the fun of the “Yiddish Carmen” from his Sharon summers, and presaged much that was to come from its composer. The eclectic score made references to everything from Debussy, to “La donna è mobile,” to Louis Armstrong, to the Indian music Leonard had recently heard in a performance by the dancer Uday Shankar (brother of Ravi Shankar). In keeping with the tone of Aristophanes’s wildly imaginative satirical allegory, the music was full of “energy and jagged rhythms, with occasional moments of lyricism.” Turning Aristophanes’s “ragged poet” into a “jazz poet,” Leonard taught the student playing the role how to “sing the blues in Greek,” writing the words out for him phonetically. The instrumental ensemble consisted of winds, strings, percussion, and harp. Passages from the score later made their way into Fancy Free and On the Town. Nearly ten years later, a duet for muted violin and cello from The Birds, transcribed for two clarinets, became the lonely opening of Symphony No. 2 (The Age of Anxiety).13 Both Helen Coates and Aaron Copland attended the performance of The Birds.14 It was the ﬁrst time that Leonard had 43\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nconducted in public, and Copland was immediately struck by his natural conducting ability and the appropriateness of the role to his personality. He had the energy, intelligence, conviction, and personal skills needed to pull together an elaborate production—he had, after all, been organizing musical events and music directing ever since his teenage years—and he also had the musical knowledge, score-reading skills, leadership abilities, and physical coordination conducting requires. All these qualities helped him to carry off an even more impressive theatrical undertaking just one month later, on May 5, 1939, when he organized, music directed, and played the piano for a production of Marc Blitzstein’s musical The Cradle Will Rock, modeled on the already fabled New York production, in which Blitzstein himself had been the onstage pianist. Bernstein cast his ﬁfteen-year-old sister Shirley (under the pseudonym Shirley Mann) as Moll, the prostitute. Blitzstein came up from New York to attend the dress rehearsal and opening night, and spent the afternoon walking and talking with Leonard along the Charles River. He thought the performance “packed a thrilling wallop” and that Bernstein was like a reincarnation of himself.15 Their bond was instantaneous, intense, and lasting. Perhaps no living composer other than Copland was a greater inﬂuence on the young musician than Blitzstein turned out to be. The mastery of text setting in his vocal music left an indelible imprint on Bernstein, his clear life choices less of one. A ﬁne pianist, Blitzstein declared himself a composer ﬁrst. While he had written some superior concert music, his deeper allegiance was to music theater with a social message. Although brieﬂy married, he was unapologetically homosexual. Blitzstein was also a communist (until 1949, the year of his operatic masterpiece Regina, based on Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes), and Cradle was an incendiary, pro-union work dedicated to Bertolt Brecht. Unbeknownst to all at the time, Leonard’s production, favorably reviewed in the Boston press, 44\n\nha rva rd\n\nﬁrst gave rise to notes on the young musician and his “left-wing associations” in a folder at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After graduation Leonard spent the summer in New York, where he lived with Adolph Green at 61 East Ninth Street. He looked unsuccessfully for work, composing at night while Green was off performing at the Village Vanguard with his ﬁve-member comedy group, the Revuers, which also included Betty Comden and Judy Holliday. Comden never forgot the night Green brought Leonard to the club and how much he loved their show. After the act he went to the piano and proceeded to play for them all until six in the morning, everything from Bach and Buxtehude to the “Honky Tonk Train Blues.” He seemed to know every song ever written, lyrics included, and it wasn’t long before he had memorized the Revuers’ entire repertoire too. In 1938 he played the piano in their musical satire of Hollywood, “The Girl with Two Left Feet,” and in June 1940 he performed with them on NBC television, with Aaron Copland (unbilled) turning pages. Years later, as Comden wrote, if they forgot an old lyric, they would call Leonard and he would immediately sing the entire song for them. By August 29 he had completed a setting, in Hebrew, of words from the Lamentations of Jeremiah for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, and had also written out his expert solo piano transcription of El salón México, a labor of love that Copland thought Boosey & Hawkes might be interested in publishing. The publishers took the arrangement, paying Bernstein $25 for it. It was his ﬁrst publication. Copland considered the Hebrew lament to be Leonard’s best work so far, particularly the outer sections. He found the middle “less spontaneous and stiff in the joints.” He cautioned his young friend on the “romanticism” of his idiom: “somehow, someday,” Copland admonished him, “that richness of feeling which I call romantic will have to be metamorphosed so that it comes out more new-sounding, more fresh.” Copland identiﬁed a Hebraic strain in Bernstein’s 45\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nmusic but may not have recognized that this very quality distinguished Bernstein’s gift from his own. It was the same ardent intensity that he later brought to his conducting. In an interview with Vivian Perlis forty years later, Copland admitted that in the beginning he perhaps “didn’t take [Bernstein] very seriously as a composer, because he could do everything, and that was just one more thing Lenny could do.”16 In late July, with Copland and others now recommending that he seriously pursue conducting, Leonard auditioned for Fritz Reiner at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, armed with endorsements from Copland and Mitropoulos but suffering from an acute case of hay fever.17 When quizzed by the renowned Hungarian maestro (who was conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at the time), he fortunately recognized that the score he was asked to sight-read was the Brahms Academic Festival Overture—not because he knew the entire work, but because an old school song he’d learned had made use of one of its melodies. Dimitri Mitropoulos sent Leonard the extra ﬁnancial support he needed—$75 a month for living expenses—to take advantage of the scholarship he received from Curtis, and in the fall Leonard moved to Philadelphia.\n\n46\n\n4 Curtis, Tanglewood, Boston, and New York Fall 1939–1942\n\nAt Curtis, Leonard was plunged into a professional musical world that was in stark contrast to the broadly intellectual environment he was accustomed to at Harvard. He took orchestration with Randall Thompson and conducting with Fritz Reiner. Turned down for piano studies with Rudolf Serkin, he was assigned instead to the redoubtable Isabelle Vengerova. Bernstein was extraordinarily fortunate to encounter three utterly different conducting styles as a student. Where his principal future mentor Serge Koussevitzky, soon to be encountered at Tanglewood, would be inspirational and expansive, a conductor of warmth, ﬂexibility, and large gestures, who emphasized what he called music’s “internal rhythm,” Reiner, a far sterner personality, was the epitome of discipline and control, managing to convey all the musical power he needed to with a tiny beat pattern and an impassive facial expression. From Reiner Leonard learned once and for all, if he needed to, that\n\n47\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\none could not stand in front of an orchestra unless, at the very least, one had internalized every last detail of the score one was conducting. Leonard was also deeply marked by his encounter with the saintly, lonely Mitropoulos, a man who emanated humility in person but was extraordinarily impassioned on the podium, even more extravagant in his conducting style than Koussevitzky, and an early advocate for Gustav Mahler, who would become such a central ﬁgure in Bernstein’s world.1 Isabelle Vengerova had a similarly transformative effect on Leonard’s pianism. She was born in Minsk and, like Heinrich Gebhard, had studied in Vienna with Theodor Leschetizky, who had himself studied with Beethoven’s celebrated pupil Carl Czerny. Her piano lineage was thus impeccable.2 Bernstein dubbed Vengerova “Tyranna,” and the name stuck, because she was indeed a terrifying ﬁgure, as much for the relentless psychological torture that could characterize her lessons as for her uncompromising attention to detail and devotion to the composer’s markings. She believed that one had to be “200 percent prepared” for a performance, since one was destined to lose 100 percent of it onstage. Certainly no one dreamed of being unprepared for a Vengerova lesson, since she seemed able to tell from only a few notes not only how many hours you had practiced, but even, it was rumored, on which days of the week. While she sometimes taught through “intimidation, fear, and personality destruction,” in the words of one student, she was a great pedagogue of the piano and was ﬁercely devoted to her students.3 She had an ability to inculcate a beautiful legato; she paid a rare degree of attention to the physical distinction between playing on black keys and white keys (“One plays on two levels”) and to matters of pedaling, balance, and dynamics.4 She taught Leonard how to hear himself.5 Renée Longy-Miquelle was his teacher in score reading, a task at which he was a spectacular natural. The two also had a brief romantic liaison, despite the age gap. (She was forty-four, 48\n\nc u rt is , t an glewood, bos ton, a nd new york\n\nand he was twenty-two.) He studied orchestration with Randall Thompson, whose Second Symphony would later ﬁgure in his repertoire, and counterpoint with Richard Stöhr. Stöhr was a middle-aged refugee from Vienna, who had known Mahler and Korngold and had once had a ﬂourishing career.6 Having previously studied counterpoint with Walter Piston, Leonard gave him a hard time at ﬁrst but ended up as his friend and later cotaught the class with him. (Stöhr lost his job when the theory department was downsized years later, and Bernstein sent him $500 a month for the rest of his life.) Bernstein’s talent and brash self-conﬁdence incurred enmity from some of his classmates, to the extent that another conducting student reputedly purchased a gun and told Thompson that he was going to shoot Bernstein, Reiner, and Thompson, too. After this rival was escorted away, tensions apparently eased between Leonard and his fellow students. Before the year was out, Leonard had conducted both the Tannhäuser overture and Brahms Third Symphony. But for a few months, his plans for the following year were thrown into disarray when Dimitri Mitropoulos proposed that Leonard join him the following year in Minneapolis as pianist for the orchestra and apprentice assistant conductor. By mid-April an apologetic Mitropoulos had written Leonard that the plan had turned out to be impractical, and that he should return to Curtis for his ﬁnal year after all. Meanwhile, in March, Copland wrote Koussevitzky’s secretary urging the conductor to admit Leonard as a summer conducting student at the newly formed Berkshire Music Center: “I have seldom met his equal for sheer musicianship. His musical memory is remarkable, and so is his ability to sight-read both scores and piano music. He is besides a ﬁrst-rate pianist. . . . Randall Thompson told me that Mr. Reiner considered Bernstein one of the best students he had ever had.”7 Later that month, Leonard met with Koussevitzky in Boston and was instantly accepted into his summer class. 49\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nIn the spring of 1940, thanks to Thompson, Leonard’s Four Studies for Two Clarinets, Two Bassoons, and Piano were included, almost apologetically, on a League of Composers broadcast from Philadelphia, alongside works by Samuel Barber, Vincent Persichetti, Oscar Levant, and others. (Bernstein was, of course, not a composition student.) Writing in Modern Music, composer Conlon Nancarrow singled it out as the most interesting of the works played.8 The summer of 1940 was the fulﬁllment of a dream Serge Koussevitzky had cherished even while still in Russia: the establishment of a music academy of international standing, with renowned musicians and composers on the faculty. Situated on the idyllic Tanglewood estate (named for the Tanglewood Tales Nathaniel Hawthorne had written while staying there), with its serene great lawn and giant oak and spruce trees, what had been a short summer festival of Boston Symphony Orchestra performances was now expanded to include a school, in which 312 students, many on scholarship, would study with a faculty that included Aaron Copland, Paul Hindemith, and Gregor Piatigorsky. As Koussevitzky’s student at the Berkshire Music Center, Leonard once again found a champion and father ﬁgure who had much to teach him. For the older conductor it was the discovery of a surrogate son and potential successor at the very moment when his lifetime dream was ﬁnally being realized. In the ﬁrst summer, Leonard was already conducting the Institute Orchestra of the Berkshire Music Center in works by Haydn, Brahms, Copland, and Gardner Read. He roomed with several friends: Harold Shapero, violinist (later violist) Raphael Hillyer from Harvard, and Lukas Foss from Curtis.9 Copland and Hindemith were teaching composition, and it is noteworthy that Leonard never enrolled in either of their classes, as he similarly had avoided formal composition study at Harvard and Curtis. (Walter Piston once remarked that, as far as composi50\n\nc u rt is , t an glewood, bos ton, a nd new york\n\ntion went, Bernstein seemed to just “have it” and didn’t need to study.) Fortunately, during this period he had many opportunities to show Copland his music. Copland’s focus was on Leonard’s recognizing his own voice and discarding outmoded inﬂuences. “That’s all warmed over Brahms or Scriabin,” he would say, “but these two bars are you. Go back home and work on these two bars.”10 Such meetings, looking his music over with Copland during the ﬁrst years of their friendship, constituted the only real lessons in composition he ever had, and they taught him about “taste, style, and consistency,” as he later put it. When the summer was over, Leonard nostalgically recalled the time he and Copland had spent together: “Not seeing you is something of a shock. . . . I’ve never felt about anyone before as I do about you, completely at ease, and always comforted by you. This is not a love letter, but I’m quite mad about you.”11 For his part, Copland’s letters to Leonard convey a degree of warmth, abandon, and joy matched nowhere else in his correspondence, even while being tempered frequently, as the years went on, by practical, paternal advice and sometimes stern admonitions. The exchanges between the two show that they had brieﬂy been lovers, but their enduring connection was on a far more essential level. Copland was among the sanest, shrewdest, most level-headed and generous of artists, and he would remain a lifelong source of common sense in Leonard’s peripatetic life. He always took the long view. Even in his composing, he made it a habit to give compositions a “cooling-off period” before making ﬁnal critical reﬁnements in them. In one letter written right after news of the Anschluss had reached America in March 1938, he cautioned Leonard, “As for your general ‘disappointment’ in Art, Man, and Life I can only advise perspective, perspective and yet more perspective. This is only 1938. Man has a long time to go. Art is quite young. Life has its own dialectic. Aren’t you always curious to see what tomorrow will bring?”12 Over the years there were several shifts in their 51\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nrelationship, as Bernstein’s fame grew and “mentorship” was left behind. But they remained close and profoundly affected the course of each other’s lives. The presence of Copland and Hindemith in the same environment, combined with Leonard’s friendship with the young violinist Raphael Hillyer, who would later help found the Juilliard String Quartet and remain with it as violist for twentythree years, apparently stimulated Leonard to compose his ﬁrst fully integrated work. The Sonata for Violin and Piano, begun in 1939 and dedicated to Hillyer, fulﬁlls the promise of the earlier Trio and Piano Sonata and leaves behind the youthful disjunctions of idiom the earlier pieces contained. The work owes at least as much to Hindemith’s quartal harmonies, long lyrical lines, and lucid counterpoint as to Copland’s bold Americanism, but it has its own voice: serious, lonely, honest, on the pastoral side. The two-movement structure of the Violin Sonata capitalized on a faculty of Leonard’s musical mind that was to mark many of his works: a penchant for variations, for musical forms that evolve forward in a straight line through continuity and change, rather than through development and return. Perhaps this associative thinking related to his gift for word games— anagrams, crossword puzzles, acrostics. It is noteworthy that two of the ﬁrst pieces that had a galvanizing effect on him were Ravel’s Bolero and Copland’s Piano Variations, two obsessive works that mine a succinct musical idea in a succession of transformations.13 The Violin Sonata employs variation principles in a highly original way, concealed behind what seems like an unaffected stream of plaintive, lyrical invention, much of it in three-part counterpoint. The ﬁrst movement could be described as a modiﬁed sonata form, with a compressed recapitulation in which the second theme returns before the ﬁrst, making it a kind of palindrome.14 The second movement is a long footnote to the 52\n\nc u rt is , t an glewood, bos ton, a nd new york\n\nﬁrst: four variations on its second theme, followed by two variations on its ﬁrst theme. Variation four is arguably one of the most beautiful passages in all of Bernstein. He later used it, with some modiﬁcations, as the third variation in the “Seven Ages” movement of his Age of Anxiety Symphony. The poignant Violin Sonata became overshadowed by the more outgoing Clarinet Sonata of 1942, and remained virtually unknown and unpublished until after the composer’s death. One could argue that it was an equally strong work, and that young Leonard seriously underestimated it. Back in Philadelphia, Leonard lived in a second-ﬂoor apartment above a grocery store, just down the street from the Delancey Pharmacy on South Twenty-Second and Pine Streets, which was a central gathering place for students at Curtis. Shirley Gabis, a sixteen-year-old pianist, used to see him there, and in the fall of 1940 he sat next to her at a concert and they soon began spending a great deal of time together. He was her ﬁrst boyfriend, and they remained close for the next ﬁfty years. (Gabis eventually married composer George Perle.) The young pair played the Hindemith Four-Hand Sonata together, and she found him “an incredible teacher, the way he sat there and labored with me over those pages. And I remember once when he sat down with my mother and analyzed a Beethoven Sonata for her . . . you knew he was a born teacher. He had an extraordinarily electrifying communicative gift. . . . He was a gorgeous young man, warm, charming, all embracing of the world. His extroversion was extreme. . . . I found myself always backing away slightly from that aspect of him. No one at Curtis had ever seen anyone like him. There were camps—there were people who were for Lenny and there were people who couldn’t stand Lenny. The ones who loved him were in love with him, and the ones who didn’t, hated him.” Yet Leonard’s detractors often ended up on his side. For all his air of knowing more than everyone else—and of being a literate Harvard stu53\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\ndent and not just a “pianimal”—he was not someone Gabis saw as being self-centered. On the contrary, he had an unmatched ability to take in other people and to understand them. “When you were with Lenny, it was as if he saw right into you” she said. “He would listen, and he knew what you were—he was very smart that way, very intuitive. He almost understood you better than you understood yourself in some way that was quite uncanny.” He may have had passionate impulses toward anyone of either sex that he was drawn to, but his homosexual side tormented him. According to Gabis, “he was still torn,” not yet the openly “omnisexual” person of later years. He told Gabis: “I have a canker in my soul.” Gabis’s mother, Rae, ran a beauty salon. One day Samuel Bernstein visited her and ended up discussing his son’s life. He said to her, “What does he have to go and be a musician for? If he worked for me, I could pay him $100 a week.”15 In his ﬁnal year at Curtis, Leonard was an active pianist and conductor. Among other things, he performed the Scriabin Fifth Sonata and the Stravinsky Concerto for Two Pianos (with Annette Elkanova, to whom he may also have proposed), and conducted the Brahms Serenade No. 2 in A Major. He received his diploma in the spring, with As in orchestration and form, an A+ in piano from Vengerova, and the only A that Fritz Reiner ever accorded a student in conducting. Before returning to the Berkshires, he appeared in Boston’s Jordan Hall on May 26 as soloist with the Women’s Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alexander Thiede, performing both Joseph Wagner’s Fugal Triptych and Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1, op. 15. On June 11 he had the unexpected opportunity to conduct the Boston Pops in Wagner’s Die Meistersinger overture in front of twenty-two thousand people at the Esplanade on the Charles River, where he acquitted himself very well.16 In his second summer at the Berkshire Music Festival, he 54\n\nc u rt is , t an glewood, bos ton, a nd new york\n\nand Harold Shapero both went out with Kiki Speyer, a beautiful young woman who was the daughter of the English horn player at the Boston Symphony. Kiki was in love with Leonard, and the two even talked of marrying. But in the end he disappointed her, confessing his attraction to both women and men and saying that he didn’t think he would ever marry. (He conﬁded to some of his friends at the time that he found men even more beautiful than women.) That summer he performed the piano in Copland’s Vitebsk trio and conducted young William Schuman’s American Festival Overture and Randall Thompson’s Second Symphony. In the Berkshire Eagle he was described as talented and inspiring, “although unable to obtain complete hold on his players.” Before facing his unknown future, he took a train to Key West, Florida, where he was able to escape from his romantic entanglement with Kiki and, inspired by hearing Cuban bands over Radio Havana, wrote sketches in a Latin American style for a ballet he called Conch Town.17 These sketches would later be put to use in Fancy Free and West Side Story. He also began working on a Sonata for Clarinet and Piano for his friend David Oppenheim. Samuel was becoming grudgingly reconciled to his son’s choice of career. He helped ﬁnd him a studio in Boston at 295 Huntington Avenue, printing up business cards advertising lessons in piano and musical analysis. Unfortunately, Leonard set up shop on December 5, 1941, just two days before Pearl Harbor. (Leonard was of draft age but had received a deferment as a result of his asthma.) Few students materialized, and the following year was a frustrating one, although it included the premiere of his Sonata for Clarinet and Piano with clarinetist David Glazer at Boston’s Institute of Modern Art. (Dedicatee Oppenheim played the New York premiere with Bernstein and recorded the work in 1943.) The Clarinet Sonata is a luminous little piece that crystal55\n\nleona rd berns tei n\n\nlizes Leonard’s early forays into composition into ten minutes. It is outgoing compared with the Violin Sonata, due to the sonorousness and precision of the piano writing, the prioritizing of the melodic line in the clarinet, the relegation of counterpoint to a more textural and accompanimental function, the danceable, often motoric rhythms in the fast sections, and the gemlike clarity of the form. The ﬁrst movement is probably the purest and most audible sonata form in Bernstein’s output, with ﬁrst and second t"
