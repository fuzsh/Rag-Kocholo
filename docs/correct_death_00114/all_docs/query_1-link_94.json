The name Steeleye Span comes from a character in the traditional song Horkstow Grange that tells the story of a fight between John [Steeleye] Span and John Bowlin but they are fictional characters. Tim forms his first band Rattfinks while still at St Albans High School. Another famous band, The Zombies, comes from that same school. Along with Fairport Convention Steeleye Span is in the class of the best known acts of the British folk revival. They record British hit singles Gaudete and All Around My Hat. Their All Around My Hat certifies Gold. Steeleye Span has 3 Top 40 albums. In December 2008, Tim receives a diagnosis of inoperable cancer. Due to his health he gives up music to become a writer and photographer. In 2008, he reunites with Maddy Prior for a one-time performance on BBCs Electric Proms. In the early morning of December 24, 2009 Tim Hart dies at 61 from lung cancer.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

But WUCO-1270 in Marysville, OH goes one better because St. Gabriel Radio sells non-commercial Religious WUCO to ICS Communications to take it commercial. ICS owns two other radio stations that are generally in the same area east of Marysville and north of Columbus. They include Spanish WDLR-1550 Delaware, OH and Classic Rock WVXG FM (95.1) Mount Gilead, OH. The deal involves a total price of $225K for WUCO with a $5K deposit, plus $20K cash on closing day to make a total down payment of $25K and a promissory note for the remaining $200K.

Greetings from Ghana! A friendly place to be sure. They speak English, love Obama, have a scrappy free press, and have 5-6 community radio stations. I am on a \"food security intervention\" assignment, NGO-speak for hunger. Trying to help the local farmers get better prices for their crops. HECK! I could (have) stayed in Central Texas and worked on that! Tomorrow I have to ride on the BACK of a mountain bike, for fifty+ clicks, on a road 'too bad for cars' to a community radio station in some village south of here. Gonna' be a bone-jarring, bladder-blasting, dust-choking, African sun frying day at the office. jim ellinger\n\nTOM ELLIS (Boston-East Sandwich, MA) Jim...One of the luckiest breaks of my life happened one Sunday in Seguin, Texas. I was the lone ranger on Sundays at KWED. Signed on at sunrise, and off at sunset. Ran the transmitter by remote control from the studio. At 10am I plugged into a live broadcast from the Lutheran Church. Just before 11am, I unplugged the Lutherans, did the station break thing, and plugged into the Catholics live. This gave me a two hour break to prepare an hour-long noon news. Just after delivering the news and getting a record show started the phone rang. It was Jack Roth, owner of KONO, who happened to be out for a Sunday drive and told me he just heard my newscast and wanted to hire me as a radio news anchorman on KONO. Two weeks later I was at KONO. That was the Fall of 1958. In April, 1961, the news director of KONO-TV called me at work and said his anchorman had quit suddenly that morning, and would I be available to anchor 12 Star Final that night? BINGO! That was the beginning of a wonderful career in television news. Tom\n\nWHERE DO YOU READ JRRR? Tell us how far away from Houston, TX that you read JRRR. Got a news tip or a question?

Christmas came early this year for the Hartman family. My wife and I became grandparents again. Our new granddaughter, Claudia Nadine, arrived weighing in at 7 lbs.,4 oz. Thank you, Lord. Jim, may you and Lacy have a blessed Christmas and a happy New Year. Remember...Jesus is the reason for the season. And, Jim, thank you for \"JRRR\". You have us spoiled. God bless our men and women in the armed forces...and God bless America!\n\nCHARLES GEORGE Subject: The CD is Dead? Hi, Books are also in the same way as CDs. Novels, short stories, newspapers. I don't even subscribe to a newspaper since I can get the stories online. The problem is when all the companies in the game are owned by the same people. Also churches. How many could actually sit and listen to a sermon like Wesley, Spurgeon, etc. One year for Lent, I bought a copy of Standard Sermons of Wesley and I found it hard to even read pass the first paragraph, etc. When non-profit groups talk about making a profit? TV stations that run programs I like at pledge drive then they disappear. I find I read more than when I was younger, have more time, just less money. Makes me think of the song Circle Game, Joni Mitchell. I saw an interesting movie from 1962 on Channel 8-3, All Night Long an interesting movie as a period piece to see Charles Mingus and Dave Brubeck and other Jazz musicians. An adaptation of Othello. I guess I am not interested in progress makes me think of the song That's All by Merle Travis. Charles George\n\nSOMEONE FORWARD THIS ISSUE OF JRRR TO YOU? GREAT!

CA. His death comes just two days before his 70th birthday on December 22nd. In a post on the bands website (www.bbhc.com/), Sam Andrew remembers, For me and many people, James was the real 1960s, the real exemplar of that counterculture, the forerunner. When I met James in 1966, he was going to die in two weeks of pleurisy. It was always something. James was such a hypochondriac that I was sure he was going to outlive all of us. Now he is gone. Sam founds Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1965 with Peter Albin and Dave Getz. Gurley is the next to join. The group needs a strong singer so band backer Chet Helms contacts Janis Joplin in Austin, TX. In June 1966 Janis travels to San Francisco to join the band. In September, 1967 Big Brother releases its debut album Big Brother and the Holding Company that they record in just three days in Chicago, IL. It remains on Billboard's Pop chart for 30 weeks. Cheap Thrills releases in 1968 and hits #1. But Big Brother only records two albums with Joplin. In a 2007 interview Gurley confesses that then head of Columbia records, Clive Davis, tells Janis to leave Big Brother and go solo with better studio musicians. After he leaves Big Brother James lives a quiet life in Palm Desert, CA. Occasionally he performs on solo projects. In 2000, he releases the album Pipe Dreams. James Gurley's survivors are his wife Margaret and sons Hongo and Django. Big Brother and the Holding Company band members plan a memorial service for James in January 2010 in San Francisco, CA.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

He warns that the CD industry is pretty much all over and that there is no replacement right now thats viable. It just means no ones going to invest in music...no-one is going to get tour support, record deals, publishing deals, all the rest, which is how every band since The Beatles have managed to get going initially...this sort of parasitical medium will basically kill the host, which would not be good. The ISPs shout innocent but The Edge retaliates ...that they are distanced enough that they can hold up their hands and say, Its not us. Were not doing anything, but in the end, people are buying broadband access in order to get content of some sort. I think that the people who have been making it their lifes work to create that content have got a reason to be upset...for young groups, its important that this gets resolved.

Dont know if you're aware, but I worked at the old 93-Q (CHR) for a whopping 42 days in afternoon drive in 1988, followed by three years of itinerant part-time work around Houston, including K-Lite. I had my first \"CC experience\" at the then-brand new 98.5 when they moved them in from freaking Beaumont (!!). I'd never encountered such heartless b_s in my life.

LOL. Hope you got my card in time for Christmas. I live in the country and when it snows, its like being in heaven as the earth is so silent and the sheer pristine beauty of natures wonder makes me forget temporarily of the condition of this world. But then I remember how wonderful it is to have friends across the world  some youve never met  still that friendship is always there like you Jimmy.

Just letting you all know that as of yesterday, Ed is under the care of hospice. It came up rather suddenly. I can no longer get him out of bed or his chair or car by myself and even with Kristi helping it's still hard. I cancelled an appt with his kidney doctor and they suggested I get Home Health. ...they said Medicare would not approve him because they have such strict guidelines and you have to be showing improvement and since all his doctors think he is not going to improve they suggested we get private home health. Well obviously I can't afford to pay those rates so they suggested Hospice. That took me a little aback since I didn't think we were really there yet. So a Hospice Nurse came out and at first she didn't think he would qualify under their guidelines either but upon further consideration they accepted him. But they will send a Nurse Practitioner out 3 x /week to bathe him. He was very lucid yesterday and I didn't want to make that decision without his knowledge so we had a long talk and he agreed it was a good idea. I reminded him that before he was born God knew the number of his days and if we live, we live to the Lord and if we die, we die to the Lord so whether we live or die - we are the Lord's. I have accepted this, but I'm still very sad. He has been precerted for 3 months and then Medicare makes them reevaluate all their patients so, if on the slight chance he has improved - then they will discharge him. There's a lady in our church who has been in hospice for 2 years. I'm still giving him all his meds, etc. The kidney failure and his Parkinson's at least aren't painful. He has just been quite quickly slowing down more and more and losing strength. So keep him in your prayers, please. Love, Jan\n\nTRIVIA ANSWER: The original version of Louie Louie by The Kingsmen costs just $36 to record but it sells over 12 million copies.\n\nCHUMBE SALINAS (Benavides, TX) Subject: Ed Case.

When I met them in the mid 70's, Ed was an account executive with Paul Williams and Chet Hancock at KTRH! They remained in touch thru the years! I know that he was real big on Jazz and associations related to Jazz. Beautiful voice! Again, Paul Williams can probably fill you in with more info.

This is the result of a decade of performance bruises, breaks and sprains that eventually requires surgery on his knees and feet. For instance, in August 2009 he falls off a stage during a concert that breaks his shoulder. Dr. Brian McKeon, Assistant Clinical Professor of Orthopedics at Tufts School of Medicine maintains, Managing and controlling his pain has been challenging, and despite our use of alternative therapies and the creation of custom shoes built by a team of engineers from Timberland, Steven's pain has progressed. McKeon is also the team doctor for the Boston Celtics. Tyler issues a statement to People.com: With the help of my family and team of medical professionals, I am taking responsibility for the management of my pain and am eager to be back on the stage and in the recording studio with my bandmates Joe Perry, Joey Kramer, Tom Hamilton and Brad Whitford.

He mentioned 1976. I didn't land there until about 1984, but I'm certain nothing had changed. The control room board was something out of the 50's, I think, and we were still playing single song cuts on carts when even college radio stations were playing CD's. The mic was on a table stand on the board in front of you, the only place I ever saw that it wasn't on a boom, out of the way. There were no turntables even if you wanted to play an LP and did anybody ever think of how they would get out of the building if it caught on fire? The only door that wasn't locked from the inside was the front door out to Caroline. There was a family of raccoons that lived under the building. Still and all, I enjoyed every minute of it. The music we played was great and I enjoyed passing along my knowledge of it. I can remember only one time in nearly fourteen years there when Paul Berlin got on me about going on too long about how ungrammatical the lyrics to \"The Girl from Ipanema\" were. I did and he was right. I don't understand why stations these days don't even announce the names of the records they are playing. Do their listeners just somehow know the names of the songs and the artists? It's sad that KQUE passed into oblivion. The music was timeless. The Houston Symphony still plays Mozart and people pay to get in. Mike Marshall\n\nSOMEONE FORWARD THIS ISSUE OF JRRR TO YOU? GREAT! You can subscribe to JRRR right here.

But his contract is up for renewal. Rumors surface that due to America's economy plus to still keep his job, under his new contract, Roe accepts a huge pay cut down to around $250,000 a year. Mike Fowler, WLS GM, confirms on Friday, December 18, 2009 that he works out a conditionally new two-year contract with Roe Conn to remain on the air. Fowler also mentions that he presents an offer to Cisco Cotto morning co-host on news/talk WIND-560 to move to WLS as Roe's co-host. Fowler insists Cisco is a conservative, and were a conservative radio station. Cisco is a prior newscaster on WLS-890.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

Farid Suleman, Citadel CEO, alleges Our business will continue as usual, and the company will work to emerge from the restructuring process as quickly as possible. Citadel, the 3rd-largest US radio company, owns and operates 224 radio stations plus produces programming on more than 4000 affiliates. Under the terms of the deal, Citadel owes $762.5 million to lenders. Its debt holders include Deutsche Bank, CIT Group and GE Capital. They receive 90% of the common stock in the new Citadel. In 2001, Forstmann-Little buys Citadel stock for $2 billion. Forstmann-Little is a big loser in the new scheme. Its 29% share of Citadel vanishes into thin air. Farid blames Citadel's $2.7 billion purchase of ABC Radio in 2006 as the culprit for their turmoil. In other words they bit off more than they can chew.\n\nNEXTMEDIA IS THE NEXT TO FALL One day after Citadel files for Chapter 11 reorganization, Colorado-based radio and outdoor advertising company, NextMedia, also clicks the bankruptcy link. NextMedia files for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of Delaware. NextMedia owns 36 radio stations, but declares that the reorganization does not result in any management changes or any staff reduction. After all of the dust settles NextMedia expects its total debt to be approximately $128 million.

What ever became of Ezba? As I recall he had a few songs that got regional airplay but never quite hit the big time. Good talent, though. It's really fun hearing from all the San Antonio air talent from the 50's & 60's. I remember bringing stuff to KONO just to get to see Lee Baby Simms while in high school. Bob Sinclair had a song \"Going to build myself a girl\", if memory serves me correctly. There was also a Nick St. John on KTSA and I'm not sure if it is the same person who passed away last year. There were two KONO jocks that visited my high school (Jefferson) in the 60's and whose photos are in the yearbook. I think it was Don Green and maybe Couser, but I could be wrong. It was also interesting to hear from Tom Ellis. I was his cameraman at KONO-TV during the time just prior to and after Outlet bought them. Good memories. Bob Miller\n\nNICK ST.

The controlling elite became so complacent and satisfied with their position and power that they absolutely refused to listen to anyone who disagreed with them or offered any warnings. In addition to the aliens they imported to do their labor and dirty work, their rulers kept getting weaker and weaker in the brain cells and stronger in their egos. They kept building monuments to themselves. (Obamacare) (Climate change) (Cap and trade) Their armies were stretched completely beyond their capacity and ability, and anyone who disagreed with the way things were being run were executed...for example Jesus Christ.

In 1966, we have so much fun when I'm Program Director/Music Director and DJ on KHFI FM. Mel is Sports Director and anchor on our sister station TV42. After Cal Druxman leaves KHFI Mel tacks on Cal's radio management duties. Cal is another wonderful, wonderful radio person. Pennington has such a fantastic sense of humor plus he's an all around good guy. How many radio managers are fun to be around? One day we go to eat lunch at an Austin greasy spoon restaurant. The place is full of people. When the waitress approaches our booth, Mel puts his arm high in the air, points his finger toward my forehead and shouts Do you know who this is? Everyone in Austin, TX knows that Mel is a TV42 star with his sports broadcasts, but I'm just a lowly FM DJ. Very embarrassing. The waitress looks at us like we're ready for the Looney bin. Those times at KHFI are some of the most wonderful experiences in my entire radio career. Will go back there right now in a heartbeat.\n\nWHERE DO YOU READ JRRR?

Dan dies at 63 on Thursday, December 17, 2009 at the St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA after he loses his 30-year battle with Crohn's disease. O'Bannon writes the script for the 1979 blockbuster hit Alien. plus Blue Thunder and Total Recall. John Carpenter, a classmate of his at USC's film school, tells The Times on Friday, I think Dan had more talent than he was allowed to show in the movie business. He was multitalented: a production designer, editor, director, writer. One of the things that endeared him to me was his rebellion against all authority, including myself, the studios, anybody who was above him. OBannon does computer animation and graphic display work on Star Wars. He also directs the 1992 horror flick The Resurrected. Dan O'Bannon is born on September 30, 1946 in St. Louis, MO. Before he receives a bachelor's degree in film from USC in 1970, he studies fine art at the Washington University in St. Louis and attends MacMurray College in Jacksonville, IL. Dan's survivors include his wife of 25 years, Diane and son, Adam. A memorial service is pending.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

The River Ganges is holy to a billion Hindus worldwide. This invokes the wrath of the U.S.-India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) who indicates that Glenn insults the River Ganges which is part of Indias religious heritage. On Friday, December 18, 2009 Beck says that he didn't mean to offend anybody. USINPAC Chairman Sanjay Puri said that Glenn Beck has issued a brief apology about his comments on the Ganges River but his apology does not go far enough in addressing the core issue of his long rant that mocked India, its education and health care system as well as Indian American Physicians in the US who were educated in that medical system.

JEFF CUNNINGHAM (Austin-Kyle, TX) I saw where my old boss, Jack Roth, had passed away recently. Of course, at 83 anything is possible, but he and I connected the first time we met. I knew that I had to have a job and so did he. He did not use that as an effort to lower my salary. He gave me a raise over what I had been making and bypassed the waiting period for insurance. He treated me like a king. Mr. Roth was a strange fellow in a lot of ways. He could be mad and steaming at a jock for doing something stupid, then when I walked up we began to exchange Robin Williams lines. Jack either loved you...or he didn't.

JUDD TAKES ON TIGER WOODS Internationally famous PGA golfer Tiger Woods is in a heap of trouble because his night life with several mistresses surfaces. His multi-million dollar endorsements begin to flee. But Nike stands by their man. Country music comedian Cledus T. Judd is not one to let this hot news slip by without a parody of some kind. He has a hilarious remake of Buck Owens' #1 hit from the 1960s, I've Got A Tiger By the Tail.

I'd be happy if it were 90 every day. I love hot weather, and having grown up in the Big Thicket not a whole lot north of Houston I know about humidity...and believe it or not I love to sweat. I wore a few layers here today with the temp in the mid 20's. Sounds like the Bayou City is living up to its name. You're mighty flat there, so there're not a lotta ways for the water to run and hide. Sticking out in the Bay here we also get oodles of rain, but at least we have multiple elevations, so the water runs away. Only immediate low lying coastal areas flood. I remember one winter in San Antonio (can't remember the date) when I was living in Hollywood Park we got about six inches of snow all of a sudden, so there was a brief envelope of time to make a snowman. KONO decided to offer some silly prize to the first snowman delivered to the station and you should have seen all the pickups with snowmen zooming into the parking lot. Of course the snow melted before the day was done. Fortunately, we didn't get an ice storm with the snow. San Antonio is hands down my favorite spot in the whole wide wonderful place known as Texas. Here's to health, wealth and happiness, and might as well add peace while I'm at it. Tom\n\nC.C. MCCARTNEY (Nashville-Hendersonville, TN) I'll be having my yearly physical tomorrow (today) December 14th from 9 am cst until 11 cst. I'll be back all tuned up and ready to rock by noon.

The one I worked with was actually newsman Robert Conway, as he appears on the recording I sent you. Have no idea where he is today. The other was DJ Joe Conway, who was at WWDJ and WOR-fm/WXLO after my time there. Seems he is the one who recently passed on, unfortunately. Your writer, John Porcaro is more familiar with Joe, as noted in his WWDJ Tribute Collection on www.reelradio.com, an outstanding aircheck website, featuring this partial DJ listing: \"There were many excellent DJs who passed through the 97 DJ doors.

Jan teams with Bill Anderson on the Classic tune For Loving You which sails to #1 on Billboard around Christmas 1967. She joins Bill Anderson again in 1969 on If It's All the Same to You that peaks at #2 on Billboard.\n\nCHARLES GEORGE (Dallas, TX) Yes, I agree with your editorial comments. That is why I ordered a book on playing the guitar by Fredrick Noad and The VNR Encyclopedia of Math from Alibris. I will have plenty of time to practice music and math which I am very weak at. I hate the fact that I have never been very good at math. Also the computer/calculator has helped in the process as well as making me more dependent, the tools are great if you know when and how to use them. Like when talking about 2 and a half cars. I would buy an LP at Goodwill for 80 cents and could not figure why it was a $1. I also have another grudge, I hate it when Dallas stations seem to think only North Dallas is Dallas and it shows in their jokes on the air. I tune to their competition or even turn off the radio. I figure a team that plays in Tarrant County needs to not have Dallas in their name. I would like professional sports better if the players were from the teams they play for... I hope you are staying warm and safe. Here in Dallas it has been pretty drippy. Thanks to NetFlix, I stayed in and watched a couple of interesting movies with Emanuelle Beart. Makes me wish I knew French. DW, The Voice Of Germany has been putting a good signal in at 3pm CST, though it is beamed to Africa, they have taken their broadcasts to the Americas off of shortwave.

At first, Gene is reluctant to accept the role as Bat Masterson until he discovers that in real life Bat wears a derby hat and carries a gold-handled cane. Frederic James Barry, his son, says that Gene Barry dies at 90 of undetermined causes on Wednesday, December 9, 2009 at a rest home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Woodland Hills. In 1999 Barry recalls, I went over to the wardrobe department, picked out a brocaded vest, looked in the mirror, and there was this elegant gentleman. I said, 'Hey, that's Bat! That's me!' Gene also portrays other men of action who dress well in the TV series Burke's Law and The Name of the Game. From the 1950s to the 1970s Barry pretty much plays the same character in all three series. Gene excels in Hollywood movie roles as well. In 1953, he stars in the sci-fi classic War of the Worlds. In 1955, he appears opposite Clark Gable in Soldier of Fortune. Barry sings in musicals like Kismet and Destry Rides Again but after two decades as a TV star, he finds himself typecast as a TV actor. Gene Barry is born Eugene Klass in NYC in 1919. He meets his wife, Betty Claire Kalb, when they perform in the city. They wed for 58 years, until she dies in 2003. In addition to Frederic, Gene's survivors include another son, Michael and daughter Elizabeth.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

CC\n\nTUNES THAT RECYCLE Many bands, groups and singers record songs that are hits by others and include them in LPs and singles which become hits again. When Mike Marshall and I are DJs on WFAA-820/570 in Dallas, TX in 1968 we play a tune by French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat, Love Is Blue (L'Amour est Bleu) that is #1 for 5 weeks on Billboard. Nearly every new LP that we see after that has the song inside its cover. In January 2000, The Four Lads include The Four Aces' hit Love Is a Many Splendored Thing in their LP, 16 Most Requested Songs. But it's The Four Aces' Love Is a Many Splendored Thing that is a smash single on Billboard after it lands on the chart on August 27, 1955. It's also the title of a movie with stars William Holden and Jennifer Jones. The song rises to #1 for 6 weeks and sells over a half million copies. In 1950, Columbia records signs The Four Lads as backup singers. They sing behind Johnnie Ray on many of his hit records that includes his debut single Cry which in 1951 is #1 for 11 weeks. Standing on the Corner (Watching All the Girls Go By) by The Four Lads lands on Billboard on April 28, 1956. It reaches #3 for 1 week on Billboard. It's from the Broadway musical The Most Happy Fella that stars Robert Weede. When The Beatles hit America's shores in 1964 many groups and singers fade from the charts. Ironically, the last tune by The Four Preps on Billboard is A Letter to the Beatles that peaks at #85. The song I'll always Love You is by several singers - I'll Always Be in Love With You - Jack Pleis (#65-1956), I'll Always Love You - The Spinners (#35-1965), I'll Always Love You - Brenda Holloway (#60-1964) and I'll Always Love You - Taylor Dayne (#3-1988).\n\nWHERE DO YOU READ JRRR?

YOU! GET OFF MY CLOUD! According to Jerry Del Colliano in Inside Music Media the next gloom and doom for terrestrial radio consolidators is cloud music. We agree that Apple is the undisputed leader in mobile entertainment with its iPods and other nifty items. Well, Steve Jobs has another innovation up his sleeve. Apple buys the cloud service Lala last week that fails on its own. About four years ago Lala is a CD swapping service. Then, it begins to allow its customers to make copies of their music collections in the cloud. What Apple gets is the brains and technology to someday bring music libraries to us fans anywhere, anytime on any device which can be exclusively from Apple. While radio consolidators cut personalities, use repeater radio and voice tracks to save money this really costs them in the long run with the loss of ratings plus negative flows of revenue. All radio stations begin to sound just alike with nothing but flip card readers who let the machines play the same few songs over and over again. According to Jerry Del Colliano the only salvation for terrestrial radio is to get back in the entertainment, discovery and music business. JRRR believes that tiny repeater playlists, no more personality on the air, the eradication of newscasts plus the loss of local radio content sends listeners away like the Swallows when they fly south for the winter. Will they ever come back to Capistrano?\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

The Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame Annex in NYC closes its doors for the final time on January 3, 2010. S2BN Entertainment, a partner in the venture, discloses the shocking news on Friday, December 4, 2009. Caren Bell, S2BN spokeswoman, states, We would have liked for the exhibition to go on longer, and there is no doubt the economy factored into our leaving, but overall we had a good year. The annex at 76 Mercer Street in Manhattan charges $26.50 for fans to view such interesting items as John Lennon's handwritten lyrics to Imagine, one of Elvis Presley's jumpsuits and Bruce Springsteen's 1957 Chevy, along with other artifacts. Phil McGuire (53) of Bakersfield, CA exclaims, I think it's important for any city of this stature to have a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This is one of the reasons why we come to New York, because we don't have something like this in California. Jeff Haas (47) of Fort Lauderdale, FL who brings his Led Zeppelin-loving son, Andrew, (15), laments, They shouldn't close it. S2BN spokeswoman, Bell, says that the museum might create a touring exhibition after it turns out the lights at the annex.\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION: In 1965, Elvis Presley memorabilia sells more than $30 million worth.

COPELAND [author of B-Western Boot Hill plus 19 other books] (Knoxville, TN) Subject: WNOX-990. 'Legends of WNOX to sign new book in Knoxville, TN by Wayne Bledsoe. Personalities who appeared on legendary radio station WNOX will gather to celebrate and sign copies of the new book \"Knoxville's WNOX\" by Ed Hooper. Sunshine Slim Sweet, one of the stars of the famed \"Midday Merry-Go-Round\" show in the 1940s and '50s, John Pirkle, one of the station's best-known personalities of the 1960s as well as the station's rock-era program director, Dave Young, who started at the station in 1968, Phil Williams, who remains an active radio celebrity and many others associated with the station. The book is a showcase for vintage photographs from the 1930s through the 1960s, along with chapters on the history of the station. WNOX was most famously the launching point for many of country music's biggest stars for three decades. \"Everyone knows about the station's role in country music, but it was just as much of a powerhouse in rock radio,\" said Ed Hooper, author of the book. \"There are not really many old timers left,\" said Young. \"A bunch of people went through the door during the rock 'n' roll era, but there's no telling where they are...\" The book-signing will be 5-7 pm Thursday, Dec. 10, at Rickard Ridge BBQ, Cove Lake, Caryville; 2-4 pm Friday, Dec. 11, at UT Bookstore, 1502 Cumberland Ave.; and 11 am-1 pm Saturday, Dec. 12, at Waldenbooks, Knoxville Center.'\n\nWNOX-990 is the 8th radio station to sign on the air in North America and the 1st one in Tennessee. In the day of uncluttered airwaves we can hear WNOX's AM signal as far south as Daytona Beach, FL and as far north as New York City. WNOX is lightening rod for Country music's greatest stars plus some of Americas best radio broadcasters. WNOX later becomes a top flight Top 40 radio station. WNOX's call letters remain an iconic landmark for Knoxville and East Tennessee.\n\nCHAD EVERSON (Minneapolis-St Cloud-Princeton, MN) Subject: Jim Rose Remembers Radio (#748) December 07, 2009 [Monday] I am saddened by the death of Big Bill Lister.

Jim, Paul Williams' correction of the Four Lads recording 'Standing on the Corner' was correct, but then he credited the Lads with 'Love Is A Many Splendored Thing' which was incorrect. That was the Four Aces. I think the list of group names beginning with The Four...was exhausted sometime in the Sixties which ultimately led to names like Toad the Wet Sprocket. Mike Marshall\n\nJERRY MILLER [Mueller] (Houston, TX) Jim...I have to correct a bit of Paul Williams note about the 4 Aces and 4 Lads. The Aces did 'Love is a Many Splendored Thing', not the Lads. Al Alberts, lead singer of the Aces, passed away recently I read (in JRRR), in Philly I think. Ran a famous restaurant. The 4 Lads also hit with 'Standing On The Corner', from the show, 'Most Happy Fella', in about 55/56. Jerry Mueller\n\nSOMEONE FORWARD THIS ISSUE OF JRRR TO YOU? GREAT!

Bill stands at 6 7\" tall. He also records the famous Hank Williams tune There's a Tear in My Beer along with many other tunes. In 1951 he decides that he needs a beer-drinking song. But Weldon's family discloses the fact that he never drinks alcohol. His son, Weldon Lister Jr. recalls that his dad tells his good friend Hank Williams that he needs a new song, Hank told my dad, I've got one that will cock your pistol.' Hank records a demo for my dad. The tune is There's a Tear in My Beer. Lister's son says that after his dad records the song, he tosses the demo aside. In 1988, he and his wife Lila go through boxes in the attic. They come across the old acetate demo disk. While on tour, Hank Williams Jr. visits the Listers. Weldon remembers He told Hank Jr. Your daddy gave this to me a long time ago, and I think it belongs to you'. Hank Jr. just about fell on the floor. In 1989, Hank Williams Jr. releases a version of the song that combines Hank Sr's voice off the demo with his own. In 1990 the tune wins the Best Country Vocal Collaboration Grammy. Just months before he dies, Big Bill Lister performs nightly for crowds of 300-plus on a 7-day Heart of Texas Records cruise from Galveston to the Caribbean. Tracy Pitcox, Heart of Texas Records President, says He got a standing ovation every night. He was never someone who thought he was a star. He never had one ounce of ego.\n\nIF YOU THINK THIS ISSUE OF JRRR IS WORTH READING...Please forward this entire issue to five of your friends and associates!

A popular poem of his is The Raven. In summer 1969 Stonewall Jackson's single 'Never More' Quote the Raven hits #25. A copy of Edgar Allen Poe's first book Tamerlane and Other Poems sells for $662,500 at a recent Christie's auction. But the buyer is a mystery. This sets a record price for most expensive American literature. According to Christie's a letter by George Washington sells for $3,218,500 which also sets a world record for a missive by the first President. The 1787 letter is to his nephew, Bushrod Washington.\n\nTRIVIA QUESTION: What inspires Lynyrd Skynyrd's biggest hit that goes to #8 in 1974, the Classic Sweet Home Alabama?
