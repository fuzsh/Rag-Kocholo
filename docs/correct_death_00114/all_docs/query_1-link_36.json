        "text": "The blogs on this page range from music-related to spiritual to musings on my thoughts, observations and opinions about whatever interests me. Actually, all of that is spiritual to me. Some of these have been published by other organizations, but all are my original writing.\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nThe End of an Era\n\nDear Friends,\n\nWhen I stepped down from directing the music for the Jazz Worship service at Old South Church in early September, my good friend and musical partner, ZoÃ« Krohne, who led the singing at that service for 10 of the 18 years of its existance, stepped up as the musical director. This was always meant to be temporary, as the church intended to take some time to discern what kind of service best meets the church's needs and hopes for the future. ZoÃ« has done a spectacular job, and it's been my pleasure to play under her leadership at the service several times this fall. But all good things must end, as they say, and this coming Thursday, December 21, will be ZoÃ«'s last service and the last Jazz Worship service at Old South as the church transitions to something different in this time slot in the New Year.\n\nI will be playing at this final service, along with Doug Rich (who played at the very first Jazz Worship service back in 2005 and many, many times since) and Mark Shilansky (who has played at quite a lot of them as well), and of course, ZoÃ«. I hope you will consider joining us as well. This service will be the annual Blue Christmas service, which recognizes that this time of year is not all bright and merry for many of us. It's certainly not if you live in the Ukraine or Gaza, and it may not be if you've lost someone you love, or are alone, or feel depression as the cold months come on, or feel overwhelmed by the multitude of expectations the season holds, the over-busyness, the pressure to spend large sums of money which you may or may not have, and a plethora of other things. The service is not meant to try to cajole you into feeling jolly, but rather to acknowledge that you may not, and to bring you into a community of others who may share your feelings. There will be some familiar music and some less familiar, and while we wish for it to bring you some sense of hope, it is mostly on the melancholy side- the bluer side. So along with Miles Davis, Joni Mitchell and Sarah McLachlan, you'll hear a pair of songs by the contemporary group, The Brilliance, among other things. And there will be words of comfort and prayer. There's a lot that resonates with me in this service, and if it does for you, I hope to see you on Thursday, for this, our last Jazz service. And even if you love Christmas and find great joy in all of its trappings, you may find that this provides a refreshing break in the busy-ness of the time. We start preludes a few minutes before 6:00 pm in Old South's Gordon Chapel, located at 645 Boylston Street in Copley Square. All are welcome- whether or not you celebrate Christmas at all!\n\nIn the New Year I will have some gigs in non-church settings to announce- so stay tuned for that!\n\nThank you for reading, and best wishes to you for a healthy and peaceful ending to this year, and the promise of a fresh start in the year to come!\n\nNovember 8, 2023\n\nHow is retirement going?\n\nOver the past weeks a number of people have asked me how I'm enjoying retirement. I have to say that each time I hear the question, I am at a complete loss as to how to answer in a way that makes sense to me. The truth is, I don't feel \"retired,\" am not even sure what that word means, and have no idea what other people's expectations are for retirement. The word conjures up images of sitting on a Caribbean beach sipping a cool drink before a dunk in the ocean- a nice thought, but one which better fits my definition of \"vacation.\" In retrospect, I regret having used the word in connection with leaving my role at Old South Church; though I am no longer working there on a weekly basis, I have never intended that change to suggest that I was retiring from playing music. In fact, the intention in leaving was, in large part, to allow more time to pursue other outlets for musical expression. What repertoire would I like to be playing at this point in my life? Who would I like to be playing with, and where would we play? What songs might I be writing to reflect my present perspective? I loved working at Old South, and at the same time, it took so much time and creative energy that I had very little left to either book gigs or envision, let alone put together, what I would like to be doing as a musician outside of playing for worship services. Now that I do have more flexibility, I'm finding that it takes time for these things to fall into place, particularly when they involve other people, as is my intention. On top of that, I've been a bit out of the loop in the wider musical world, due both to my work at Old South and from the isolation of Covid. So while I don't have \"the next thing\" in place yet, I would say that rather than being retired, I am in transition.\n\nFor those who might be interested, I can tell you what I have been up to since leaving my job as music director for Jazz Worship at Old South Church in early September. On the musical front, I've applied for a grant from my local cultural council for a performance, which, if funded, will take place in April. I don't want to say too much about this yet, in the event that it is not funded or only partially funded, but if it all comes together, it will be a multi-cultural, multi-arts collaboration which I'm very excited about. I am also working on trying to book some gigs at venues in the Greater Boston area which will likely take place in the earlier part of the new year if they come through. While at this point I don't have anything concrete to report, I will certainly let you know where, when, and what other musicians are involved when I do. In the meantime, I have recorded a track for a benefit recording spearheaded by singer/songwriter Linda Marks, and played live a number of times in the past months- for church services- including one at a funeral service and two at Old South Church's Jazz service- as a sideman, rather than as the leader- a role I really enjoy (no responsibility for planning the repertoire, writing out charts, booking musicians, communicating with musicians and staff, feeling responsible for it all coming out well- just the fun parts!) In fact, I will be playing there this Thursday, November 9, along with Linda Brown-San Martin and Doug Rich, under the leadership of ZoÃ« Krohne. So if you're of a mind....\n\nBeyond that, the two major themes of my present life have been visiting friends and being a grand-parent to my just-turning-one (tomorrow) grandson, Will. I've had great fun babysitting Will and some quality visits with friends in Western Mass and New Hampshire, as well as spending the better part of a week in Tulsa with an old friend and semi-annual travelling companion. Perhaps I will write more about that in another email (the second most asked question being, \"Why Tulsa?\" or just, \"Tulsa?\") I continue to try to improve on the saxophone, practicing every day, and I've written one new instrumental piece, which we played at one of the aforementioned jazz services, and am hoping to do a lot more writing. I'm also looking forward to doing more jamming with friends, just for the fun of it. I think as with any major change, there is a period of transition which has to take its natural course before settling into something new- if one ever settles into anything! And sometimes, the best things are those which I don't see coming; and the good stuff almost never happens when I try to force something which doesn't take shape naturally. So at this point, there is still much to be determined, all in its own time. But I'll tell you one thing I don't plan to do, and that's retire!\n\nSeptember 12, 2023\n\nThank you!\n\nI'm writing to say thank you to all of you who attended my last Old South service as music leader for Jazz Worship either in person or on-line this past Thursday. It was a very special evening for me, and I am both filled with gratitude and humbled by the kind words of support and appreciation which I received from both those participating in the service and those who spoke or wrote to me afterward. I am extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to play music in a setting that afforded me the ability to express my spiritual, political and artistic yearnings in one place, to people who were fully present and open to receive and give back what I had to offer. It has been a gift to work with so many talented people- musicians, clergy, staff and volunteers, for such an extended run. I do not have the words to adequeately express my gratitude.\n\nZoÃ« is keeping the music alive at the Old South Jazz service, and has some great musicians lined up for the coming Thursdays. As always, you can count on compelling words from Old South's clergy. Preludes start a few minutes before 6:00 in Gordon Chapel.\n\nIf you either missed or would like to revisit my farewell service from last week, you can view it here:\n\nJazz Worship - September 7, 2023\n\nThanks again for your support!\n\nSeptember 5, 2023\n\nMy Last Jazz Service\n\nIt is with a mix of profound and conflicting emotions that I navigate my final week as music director of Jazz Worship at Old South Church in Boston, culminating with this Thursday's service on September 7. While a church service should always be about things much greater than those who participate in it, I will celebrate the completion of 18 years in that role and say farewell while striving to bear in mind the real reasons we've been gathering in this place each week. As I reflect upon the gift this has been, it seems to me that this work has been my true calling, the setting in which what I have to offer is most in tune with the needs of that setting, and where the most authentic expression of my art and myself have been given voice. I have been blessed to work with incredibly talented clergy, staff and some of the finest musicians in the Greater Boston area (and beyond), and I have learned from them all. And I have been blessed to serve congregants, some who come with regularity, some who may be just passing through, who receive our offerings and send their own music back to us, multiplying our efforts many times over. I am grateful.\n\nAnd at the same time, it feels right to step back from this. While the the service lasts but an hour, there are, of course, many hours of behind the scenes work required to pull this off each week. In my role, those hours are given to choosing songs with intention to support the theme the clergy will preach on, collaborating with them on the liturgy and logistics of the service, reporting back to them on our song choices and specific needs for each service, hiring and communicating with musicians, making sure our sound needs will be met and our pay checks will be written, learning new songs, coming up with arrangements, writing out new charts and updating others, and, of course, practicing as much as possible. All of this has given my weeks structure, and these responsibilities can also take as much time as I have to give to them. And as soon as one service ends, the cycle starts anew in preparation for the next. After 18 years, it can feel, at times, relentless, and it can become more challenging to maintain the enthusiasm to keep the stream flowing and fresh. It would not be right to give this any less than 100%, and it becomes increasingly difficult to do so. Both the church and me are better served by making space for new beginnings and fresh energy.\n\nConcurrent with my personal situation is the fact that the church has undergone a great deal of staff change since Senior Minister Emeritus Nancy Taylor retired in May of 2022, and a new Senior Minister fills that role starting this week. It's a good time to take stock and discern the needs of the church in fulfilling its mission as a sanctuary in the city in this moment and looking to the future.\n\nFortunately for those who find the service meaningful, it will continue through the fall while this discernment process takes place, and the music will be led by the person I've worked most closely with in preparing the services and has given so much to both its process and execution through the past 10 years, our extremely talented and gracious vocalist, ZoÃ« Krohne. I know the music for the service will be in good hands under ZoÃ«'s direction, and I look forward to seeing what innovations might come about as she spreads her wings further in this capacity. I don't know what will follow beyond the Advent season, but knowing Old South Church, I am confident that it will be creative and meaningful, and designed to serve as broad a cross-section of our citizenry as possible. I look forward to seeing that that looks like!\n\nFor my part, I don't know exactly what will come next- a major impetus to step back is the fact that, given the needs of the service, I haven't had time to develop anything ongoing outside of that, or to take on the necessary work of booking and promoting performances in other venues. I know that whatever I do, I will continue to work with my two most consistent and sympathetic collaborators- and two of my best friends- ZoÃ« and Doug Rich. When I find out what we're doing and where we're doing it, you can be sure I will let you know!\n\nSo, this has been a long way of saying that I hope you will join us, either in person or on-line this Thursday, September 7, for Jazz Worship at Old South Church, with preludes starting at about 5 minutes before 6:00 pm. We will have a larger than usual band, as I wanted to include more of the musicians who have been regulars in the past few years, with Mark Shilansky and David Hunte both playing keyboards, and John Baboian playing guitar along with ZoÃ«, Doug and me. I've chosen songs- some celebratory, some reflective- in the hope of leaving you with my parting message in song. I've heard rumours that there will be special food at the conclusion!\n\nOld South Church is located at 645 Boylston Street in Copley Square, at the intersection of Boylston and Dartmouth Streets. If you're joining us on-line (either live or after the fact), you can find a link to the service here:\n\nOld South Church Livestream\n\nThank you for your support over the years!\n\nJuly 18 2023\n\nMovie Music\n\nA number of years ago I was asked to write the theme music for a documentary film. That film, entitled, Project Censored: The Movie, explores the nature of media censorship of news which may be damaging to the corporate sponsors of \"the news.\" The resulting, winnowed news is likened to junk food- filling, but ultimately not good for us. At the behest of the film-makers, I've just uploaded the song I wrote for the movie, which I called \"Junk Food News.\" If you'd like to hear it, you can find it on a number of popular music streaming platforms, including Spotify, I-Tunes and YouTube Music. Here are some links to it on those platforms, and you can find it on others you my use as well:\n\nJunk Food News on Spotify\n\nJunk Food News on YouTube Music\n\nJunk Food News on I-Tunes\n\nTo learn more about the film, please visit: Project Censored: The Movie\n\nJuly 11 2023\n\nBig Change at Old South Church's Jazz Worship\n\nWeâve been in the midst of a season of change, beginning with the Covid pandemic, the retirement of our beloved Senior Minister, Nancy Taylor, the departure not long after of our also loved Shawn Fiedler, the good news of Rick coming on board as Interim Senior Minister and Ashleyâs ministry with us, then Helenâs retirement, and finally, the fresh news of John Edgertonâs return to Old South as the next settled senior minister. Thatâs a lot of change in a relatively short amount of time, some of it felicitous, some sad, some bittersweet, and it can be hard to adapt to it all. But times of great change are also times of great opportunity, and it will be exciting to see where and how Old South feels Godâs call in what is essentially a new epoch for the church, a time to discern, establish priorities, and make changes where they will help further the ways we act as the hands and feet of God in this place and in this moment.\n\nAs it is a time of new beginnings, I feel itâs the right time for me to announce my retirement as well. The first Thursday in September will mark the completion of my 18th year of leading the music for Jazz Worship, and that seems like a good landmark to celebrate my last service in this capacity. It has been a gift and a blessing to play a small part in the workings of this great church, and it has been a privilege to work with many gifted ministers, starting with Nancy Taylor, who conceived this service with me and got it off the ground, and all of the associate pastors, student pastors, ministerial interns, staff, talented musicians, and laypeople who I have worked with, learned from and worshipped with through these years. I have loved this work, and it has been one of those labors of love which can take as many hours as I have to give it. It has been the focus of my week for all of these 18 years, and, perhaps not surprisingly, even more so when I retired from a day job some 7 years ago. I am at an age when I feel that if I am to do new things, Iâd better get on it!\n\nOne of my heroes is David Ortiz, whom I view as a model for how to retire with style: He announced that the 2016 season would be his last, and during that season he hit 38 home runsâthe most ever by a player in their final seasonâand had 127 RBI while batting .315. He led the AL and MLB in a number of categories and had one of the best seasons of a 20 year career that is sure to land him in the Hall of Fame. Many people entreated him to continue playing, as he was clearly at the top of his game. But he chose to go out while he was at his best, rather than continue until his declining skills became painfully apparent to everyone watching, as is so often the case. Well, Iâm no David Ortiz, but I would like to retire as music director for Jazz Worship while I am still playing at a level commensurate with my particular abilities.\n\nI am confident that the Saints of Old South Church will discern faithfully what God is calling this community to moving forward. For my part, my intention is to continue to explore avenues of artistic and spiritual expression. My longtime motto has been, âtake a little of the church into the club, and a little of the club into the church.â But for a while now, I have had very few opportunities to play in what I would call âmainstreamâ venues. I would like to get back to that while I can, and to play with a group to develop a repertoire that we know very well and can explore very deeply, rather than imagining each week as a fresh slate in search of repertoire geared to support a particular theme. I still plan to play in churches from time to time, and would love to play at Old South on a very occasional basis if invited. So I hope this is a change, but not a final farewell!\n\nThank you for all of your support over the years, and please join us over the course of the summer!\n\nMay 10, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #14: Brubeck and Desmond\n\nWhen I started my little \"Song of the Week\" project, the intention was to create a forum to share songs I've written over time. I am grateful for the positive response I've received to many of these. But this week, I'm going to take a rest from that, and instead send you a song written by one of my early jazz heros, whose music still moves me greatly, Dave Brubeck. It probably goes without saying that the saxophone playing of Paul Desmond, Dave's partner for decades, is a huge part of what I love about the Dave Brubeck Quartet's music. Paul was my first jazz saxophone influence, and continues to inspire me more than half a century after being introduced to his music as a sophomore in high school. Many of his improvised solos seem so perfectly crafted to me, free of extraneous notes and always finding the sweet ones which seem unexpected yet inevitable at once, as if they had been carefully composed and edited rather than played off the cuff in the heat of the moment. And rather than go with the trend of the day and attempt to sound like Charlie Parker (another hero of mine), who changed the way virtually everyone played regardless of their instrument, he resolutely followed his own path, which is both more authentic to the nature of jazz, and earned him the respect of Parker himself. So while I didn't write this week's song, my playing and that of my compatriots, Doug Rich and Erez Dessel, represents our own improvised interpretation of this song, and I think of improvisation as spontaneous composition in its own right.\n\nHere's our version of the song: Forty Days\n\nA number of people have asked when I have gigs coming up in settings other than our weekly jazz church services at Old South Church. Unfortunately, those have been few and far between of late, a situation which I am hoping to change. I do have a couple of things on the calendar over the coming months, though. I will definitely provide all of the details as the dates come closer, but for now:\n\nOn June 24, I will be presenting a painting and music improvisation with my artist friend, Patrick St. Pierre at an event called \"Art in the Garden\" hosted by Open Spirit in Framingham. The event, at 39 Edwards Street, will run from 1:00 - 4:00 pm, and the musical portion will run from 2:00 - 3:00. Patrick and I will be influencing each other's artistic choices as he paints an un-premeditated picture while I improvise on the saxophone to create an original, spontaneous work of art. Following our presentation, Patrick will give a brief talk on our process before inviting anyone who would like to make their own painting to my improvisation. The event will include other arts activities as well. Full details to come at a later date!\n\nAnd on August 31, ZoÃ« Krohne and I will be leading a band with our friends Marlene del Rosario and Ron Mahdi in an outdoor concert at the McAuliffe Branch of the Framingham Public Library. We are very pleased to be invited back to participate in this free concert series, having really enjoyed playing in this beautiful setting to a very responsive audience last summer. The concert starts at 7:00 pm, and you are invited to bring your own lawn chair or blanket to set up in the grove behind the building.\n\nIn the meantime, I invite you to join us for Jazz Worship at Old South Church this Thursday, May 11, beginning with preludes at 5:55 pm. Rev. June Cooper, recently retired as longtime director of City Mission Society of Boston, will be preaching a sermon which honors former Old South member and first African American published poet Phyllis Wheatley, lifting up her message of perseverence and hope in the face of unfathaomable oppression. Conseulo Candelaria-Barry joins ZoÃ« Krohne, Doug Rich and me to play music by composers ranging from Ornette Coleman and Charlie Parker to Graham Kendrick, Pat Humphries, and songs from both South African and North American freedom movements. Please join us!\n\nApril 26, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #13\n\nThis week's Song of the Week was written for a service commemorating those lost in the Middle Passage. May we always remember.\n\nIf I Could Drain the Oceans\n\nThis Thursday at Old South Church's Jazz Worship service, Rev. Ashley Popperson will preach on the impossibility of going back to \"what was\" at a particular time, and the healing that comes when we embrace the change, including the wounds that come with it. Pianist Matt Richard joins Doug Rich, ZoÃ« Krohne and me in providing musical support. We'll play songs by Sonny Rollins, Sting, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Lennon & McCartney, and me as well as a favorite from the tradition of spirituals created by peoples of African descent.\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #12\n\nTwo weeks ago I sent you a song written in honor of my friend, Stanley Swann, who left the planet too early. This week I'm reaching back into the vaults to send you a song that you can hear Stanley play on, with the belief that he lives on through his music and in the hearts of those who loved him. This is from my 2002 CD, echoing, and the song, \"Holler,\" inspired by African American field hollers, is absolutely driven by Stanley's powerful drumming. But in addition to really laying down the law rhythmically, listen to how he picks up on and highlights what others of us play at various times, and leads us into section changes and a key modulation. As I recall, we recorded this live in the studio in one take at the end of the day, so there's no editing or overdubbing here to make it sound better than we played it- that's Stanley responding in the moment in real time, elevating all of us!\n\nAnd if you like the elegant piano playing on this cut as much as I do, Consuelo Candelaria-Barry, who played it, will be playing with Doug Rich, ZoÃ« Krohne and me this Thursday at Old South Church for Jazz Worship starting a few minutes before 6:00 pm. We'll be celebrating Earth Day a couple of days early (and should be celebrating it every day, for that matter), and we would love it if you'd celebrate with us! The church is located at 645 Boylston Street, Boston, in Copley Square (right at the Boston Marathon finish line!)\n\nHere's the link to the song: Holler\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nMaundy Thursday and Song of the Week #11\n\nThis week at Old South Church, as Thursday is Maundy Thursday, an occasion of great significance in the Christian journey, rather than offer one of our usual Jazz Worship services, we join with the clergy and the Festival Choir under the direction of Mitchell Crawford to offer a service of Tenebrae (shadows) depicting the Last Supper and arrest of Christ through word and music. The jazz ensemble will include frequent collaborator Mark Shilansky on piano and the addition of Miles Walcott on drums, who join ZoÃ« Krohne, Doug Rich and me.\n\nThis is always a very moving service for me, perhaps my favorite of the year. In addition to a dramatic telling of the story as we experience light turning to darkness, the music brings together disparate elements to create a mosaic of colors with the intention of illuminating the message told through the spoken word. The music includes compositions by Bruce Cockburn, George Harrison and Billy Strayhorn along with Taize chant, traditional hymnody played with a jazz inflection, plainsong and an arrangement by David Hurd. I am grateful for these boundary-breaking collaborations bringing together jazz and classical elements, ensemble with choir and organ, which, while musically rich, symbolizes for me the search for wholeness and unity that this journey is ultimatley about.\n\nThe song I've chosen as this week's Song of the Week has a tangential connection for me to Maundy Thursday, in that it was written to mourn and celebrate the life of a good friend and musical partner who died before those who loved him were ready to let him go. Stanley Swann was a drummer par excellnce who Doug and I partnered with frequently, and seemed to have the ability to read the minds of those he accompanied, calculating his beats to emphasize the rhythms being spontaneously created by the improvisors around him so accurately that they sounded as if meticulously orchestrated in advance. I wrote a longer blog about Stanley (and this song) which I \"published\" on November 12, 2015, so rather than repeat what I said there, I will refer those who might be interested to my website, where I have archived my blogs. This link will take you to the blog page, and, if interested, you can scroll down to the date in question to find the blog: Blog Page\n\nHere's a link to the recording of the song, \"A Flower is a Day; A Friend is Forever,\" made by Doug Rich, Erez Dessel and me during the isolation phase of the pandemic: A Flower Is a Day; A Friend Is Forever (for Stanley) And if you're wondering why there are no drums in a song about a drummer, well, Stanley was the drummer, and if you listen deeply enough, perhaps you'll hear him.\n\nApril 2, 2023\n\nLenten Devotional on the theme Traveling Together Toward Easter (#5)\n\nâ¦But no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler. Job 31:32\n\nWhen I was in Singapore with a band I was in, we had a day off from performing engagements, and though companionship is high on my lists of both the necessities and delicacies of life, if youâve ever been on a road trip where youâre spending virtually every minute of every day with the same group of people, often crammed into cars and small hotel rooms, youâll understand why I decided to take that day off from the band as well. Another musician friend who had been to Singapore previously had tipped me off to a nature preserve just outside the main part of the city, and I set off by bus on my own to take that in.\n\nIt was like no other place Iâd been, and as I walked through the paths, surrounded by lush vegetation and both flora and fauna that were exotic to me, what I remember being most fascinated by were the wild monkeys who roamed freely, as I had previously only seen monkeys in zoo environments which restricted their movement. I remember it being a very hot day, and the trail went up and down some inclines, and in short order, I was drenched in sweat, but happy. At some point along the way, a couple of young kids came up behind me, and to my amazement, took the kind of interest in this sweaty, more or less middle-aged foreigner that I had in the monkeys. Supposing there must have been many foreign tourists who had made their way to this place, I was surprised that I held any fascination for them, but for whatever reason, they were eager to interact, and laughed a lot, and attached themselves to me for the remainder of my walk. Their parents lagged behind at a respectable distance, close enough to make sure their kids were safe, but far enough to let them have their own experience. When we finally reached the end of the trail, the parents joined us and took some pictures of the kids and me together.\n\nIn the course of my travels, this was not the first or last time I was befriended by strangers, but it is one of the most memorable. It reminds me of how we often let fear of people who seem different prevent us from taking the first step to open the door to friendship. It reminds me to trust, rather than be suspicious of the stranger I might meet unexpectedly on the path. It reminds me of the naturally inquisitive nature of children, and how easily we lose that as we grow older. And it reminds me that I may have something of interest or value to other people, and should not withhold it.\n\nI would love to meet those children now, almost thirty years after our first meeting. I would love to ask them what they remember, if anything, of our encounter. I would love to see if they are still inquisitive, still bold in their desire to make contact with people from unfamiliar places, still fascinated and friendly, free of fear and judgment. I would love to take a new picture of us together, and to tell them that because of them, I try to be more open to strangers I meet along the trail, greeting them not with tolerance, but with enthusiasm; that I try to be more like them. I would love to tell them, âThank you.â\n\nWelcoming God, May we always meet strangers along the way with the eagerness of a child, assuming the best, seeing you in everyone, and offering companionship for the journey. Amen.\n\nMarch 29, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #10\n\nIf you were to set a well-known bible passage to a Latin montuno, would it still sound \"biblical?\" Listen to this week's song of the week and make up your own mind about that! I can't take credit for the words to this one, which actually puts together two ancient prayers (only one of which has a Latin beat), but I did write the music. ZoÃ« sings it beautifully, and Doug and Erez provide the rhythm and harmony. Here's the link: The Lord's Prayer/Psalm 23\n\nMarch 25, 2023\n\nLenten Devotional on the theme Traveling Together Toward Easter (#4)\n\nFor everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. 1 Timothy 4:4\n\nThere are many reasons why people travel: it might be for work, for a much needed vacation, or it could be family-related; and in the latter case, it might be a happy occasion like a wedding, reunion or holiday celebration, or something less welcomed, like attending a funeral or supporting a loved one in the last phases of their life. As I look back on the travelling Iâve done over the course of my life and reflect on my current stage of the journey, more and more, I see the goal as embracing all of these types of travel, even the less pleasant ones, as a form of adventure travel.\n\nThe last big tour of a band I was in took us from here to Texas, then to California, and from there to Singapore. The flight to Singapore was very long. In fact, through some sort of weird metaphysics which I still donât understand and have something to do with crossing the international date line, I arrived in Singapore an hour before I left Los Angeles, though it took over 24 hours to get there. But the real adventure came when we had a 4 hour layover in Narita, Japan.\n\nAs is frequently the case, as I look back on my life as a much younger person, Iâm amazed at the choices I made, the boldness of my decisions, and the audacity with which I was able to pull off things which my current self would deem impossible. I guess you could say that Iâm amazed at my sense of adventure! In this instance, while some of the band chose to wait it out in the airport, I managed to negotiate the subway system, get myself to a temple which I had heard about, find a noodle joint where I ordered and enjoyed a bowl of noodles, and get myself back to the airport in time to catch my flight- all without speaking or understanding a word of Japanese.\n\nWhen I think about how I might live every second of my current life with this zest for adventure, the key seems to be to try to live with gratitude for all of it, including the challenging parts which, given the choice, I wouldnât seek out. And the trick to that, I think, is to be open to what comes rather than upset by what doesnât go according to plan, greeting the unexpected road as an opportunity. Miles Davis famously said, \"Itâs not the 'wrong' note that matters- itâs the one you play after it.\" Maybe I love jazz as much as I do because jazz teaches me that even those âwrong notesâ can be made to sound beautiful by what we play next. If we respond with acceptance, self-awareness, lack of judgment, and use the tools weâve developed over years of practice, something unintended or even unwanted can be the starting point of something beautiful. And the good news is that when we approach life this way, we are sometimes gifted by the help of others. As saxophonist Paul Desmond put it, âI could play the wrongest note possible and Dave (Brubeck) would respond with a chord that would make it sound like it was the only note I could have chosen.â As a person who makes a lot of mistakes in life, as well as in music, I need to ask myself, âHow can I turn my difficult passages and missteps into something beautiful?â When the adventure becomes bumpy, can I gracefully accept what comes and adapt to it- and give thanks for the opportunity to deeply experience something unexpected and new? Can I be grateful for all of lifeâs journey? Can I see it all as an adventure, and savor it?\n\nMerciful God, thank you for the adventure youâve given me. May I accept the road before me in its grandeur and its pitfalls, and see the beauty in all of it.\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #9\n\nWith some notable exceptions, darkness generally gets a bad rap. We hear about going over to \"the dark side\" and there's that time-worn cliche of the bad guys dressing in black while the good guy wears a white hat. Of course, the most pernicious association between darkness and negativity is expressed in racist attitudes toward people of color. This week's Song of the Week is a meditation, of sorts, on lightness and darkness, informed in part by my reading of Ibrahim X Kendi- though, as always, my intention was to write in a way that tends more toward poetry than didacticism. On the musical side of the equation, while I intended for this to have a light Latin feel, I was very surprised by the introductory piano solo that Erez plays, which leans more toward tango than the salsa I was imagining. But I think it works! I hope you enjoy it! Light and Dark\n\nMarch 18, 2023\n\nLenten Devotional on the theme Traveling Together Toward Easter (#3)\n\nI will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up. Isaiah 49:11\n\nTo the elders among youâ¦ Be shepherds of Godâs flock that is under your care, watching over themânot because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 1 Peter 5\n\nThere are many types of journeys, some measured in miles, some in the passage of time, and some describing emotional passages or transitions. Sometimes, more than one of these comes into play over the course of the journey. Parenting is one of those.\n\nWeâre now in the stage of life where weâve raised two daughters, and both now have a child of their own. We have journeyed from the sleepless, though blissful nights of caring for a newly born babe through the toddling times to full out running and talking up a storm; through the ups and downs of schooling and friendship traumas, with excursions to extra-curricular activities; to visiting and finally attending college, living at home after college before finding a life partner and starting an independent life as an adult. Weâve experienced all of the emotional as well as the literal miles driven to get from there to here. Now, as we settle into our role as grandparents, a new journey has begun; or at least, the journey has taken a turn on a road that was new to us. Weâve strapped on our seatbelts and are eagerly following that path, finding joy not only in the excitement of new life, but in our bonding with each other through this shared experience and our now changed relationships with our children. Even as we care for their young ones, our children have now begun to take care of us, as Nina did when she did all of our grocery shopping at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nLike all roads, though, this one is not straight, and there are occasional bumpy passages to traverse. Though we think weâve gained some wisdom from having travelled the parenting road a couple of times, we find that not only have some new practices evolved for making the trip, but that our children have ideas of their own, and a right to make different choices than we might. There are new road signs along the way, and some of them are clearly marked, âDo not enter!â And of course, we donât know exactly where this road is leading, even as we cruise along full speed ahead!\n\nAs in all journeys, we set out on the path we think is the best one for us, or that we stumble onto, perhaps making some unexpected turns along the way, but adapting to the changing circumstances we encounter. We continue a journey begun long ago with the birth of our children, but in a changed relationship as our children become parents, now caregivers to both their progeny and, increasingly, to us. As in all journeys, we are all always somewhere, and always on the way to somewhere else. May we celebrate and be grateful for both, and to those who travel with us!\n\nGracious God, send us travelling mercies as we journey through life, and make us grateful for the road behind us and the one ahead, though it may not take us where we thought we wanted it to.\n\nJenny Allen and Willie Sordillo\n\nMarch 15, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #8\n\nThis week's Song of the Week is one for which I wrote music and adapted a pre-existing text for the lyrics. The original text, from the pre-Christian book of Isaiah, is poetic in a way that I hope can lead to multiple interpretations, regardless of one's religious beliefs (or absence of same!) Recorded during the isolation period of Covid's presence in our lives, this is also one where Zoe and I were able to collaborate with my good friend, Gary Lapow, who lives in Berklee, CA, through the wonders of remote recording technology. I am grateful for that opportunity, and his contributions play a major role in this interpretation, which you'll see is very different from other recordings I've posted on my YouTube channel. So thank you, Gary! Here's the link: I Go Before You\n\nAs always, Zoe, Doug Rich and I will be playing for Jazz Worship at Old South Church this Thursday with preludes starting at 5:55. This week we'll be joined by our frequent partner on piano and vocals, Mark Shilansky. The theme of the service, and much of the music, is \"Rest.\" If you can't make it to 645 Boylston Street in person, you can join us online via Old South Livestream\n\nThat said, I will once again make a pitch for live gatherings, and those which involve music, in particular, if you're able (and understanding that not everyone is!) I say this after hearing my friend, Josh Rosen play at the Lily Pad this past weekend both in a duo setting with Stan Strickland and with his group, The Melt (both of which I highly recommend!) A couple of weeks prior, I went to the same venue to witness an engaging set by a band called Bog Berries, led by one of my former students, Cooper Evello. (I also recommend them!) And my feelings about the heightened experience of being there live to witness spontaneous creativity and communal interaction were echoed in an account in a biography I'm currently reading about Sonny Rollins, where musicians hearing the young, game changing Charlie Parker for the first time were awed by what he was inventing not when first hearing him on record, but upon seeing him play live in a club. It's just a different experience altogether, and there are layers of meaning that can only be communicated and understood through face to face interaction. Layers of joy, too, I'll say!\n\nAnd speaking of that, I am hoping that in coming months I will have some club or otherwise public events outside of church to tell you about. I've been slow to get on it with booking things since Covid hit for a variety of reasons, some better than others (like grand-parenting), but it's time I get it together. Stay tuned!\n\nThanks, as always, for your support, and for reading these missives and listening to the songs! I appreciate it!\n\nMarch 11, 2023\n\nLenten Devotional on the theme Traveling Together Toward Easter (#2)\n\nAnd God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. 2 Corinthians 9:8\n\nWe talk a lot about what to take with us when we pack for a journey, and less about what not to take. When I travelled a lot with a band I was part of, I learned how to pack efficiently, whether massaging a few weeksâ worth of essentials into a suitcase or maximizing the amount of instruments, gear and people that could be elegantly fit into a van. I learned how to take everything I needed, but only what I needed for the journey, and how to get the most out of the available space. Now that weâre older, Jenny and I are very much in a âtravelling lightâ mode. We buy as little as possible and have given away many things we donât need, whether kitchen utensils we have doubles of, books we may love but will likely never re-read, and even some things kept around for purely sentimental reasons (which I find particularly hard to off-load). I think of the movie, âUp in the Air,â in which George Clooneyâs character has a side-job as a motivational speaker, and begins his talks with a small backpack and the statement, âThis is your lifeâ¦.â He travels constantly, and has got packing light down, using that as a metaphor for the other kinds of baggage we carry with us. What do we need, and what are we better off without? In this season of Lent, so often associated with giving something up, I wonder not only what I can do without as an individual (and not just for Lent), but what we might pare down on collectively. What do we do out of sentiment and habit that no longer serves us well? Can we shed some of our individualism to benefit our collective well-being? Can we wean ourselves off fossil fuels? How about deeply rooted prejudices weâve carried with us since childhood, often unconscious of their place in our backpack until someone else feels their weight and pushes it back on us? I wonder what other societal habits, rituals, and addictions we might rid ourselves of in search of something more useful, efficient and consistent with our values? And are there things about the way we âdo churchâ that no longer serve us as they once did, yet we continue out of habit, loathe to part with more out of sentiment than how well they serve us in this time, and into the future? I have a box of old letters in my basement which I rarely, almost never, in fact, look at, yet I keep around as a matter of sentiment. I can make an argument for keeping those letters, and we as a church and as a wider community can make arguments for keeping some of our traditions. In some cases, the argument is good enough to justify maintaining the practice. But in this dark season of Lent, as we journey forward toward the light of Easter, I wonder if we might consider the weight of our suitcase, take stock of what weâre carrying, and ask ourselves what we really need not only to feel connected to our past, but to sustain us as we journey into the road which lies ahead. Provisioning God, give us the wisdom to know what we need to do the work you have called us to do, and leave the rest behind, trusting that like the sparrow, you are watching us, and will provide all that is essential. Amen. March 7, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #7 and Special Guest this Thursday\n\nI'm reaching back for this week's Song of the Week for a song I wrote in 1990 and recorded with the Latin band I was part of for a decade, Flor de CaÃ±a. This served as the title song for a collection of songs written by pro-feminist men on an album released by Flying Fish Records and benefitted organizations providing services to people with AIDS. This was at the height of the epidemic, when PrEP and viral suppression drugs did not exist, and thousands were dying. The majority of the artists contributing songs to the project identified as gay men and more than one was HIV positive. To put this in context, this was 7 years before Ellen DeGeneres came out with a kiss on her TV sitcom and was blacklisted for a number of years as a result.\n\nThe song itself is a little more abstract and mystical than all that- or at least I hope so! I played rhythm guitar and sang the lead vocal on this, so it's different in that regard from what you usually hear from me these days. The track also features Rosi Amador's singing and Brian Folkins-Amador's lead electric guitar playing as well as bandmates Laura Burns on bass, Hector Cancel on percussion, and Jorge Martinez on keyboards. Rosi and Brian are best known these days for their work with their band, Sol y Canto, which has been going strong for nearly 30 years. One more fun fact to put this in historical context: In 1988, when Flor de CaÃ±a's first album was released on Flying Fish, which was one of the largest and most respected folk music labels at the time, it was the first recording the label released on CD, and they were nervous about making the leap to that format, fearing that the folkies who bought their products would be reticent to embrace the new technology, preferring to stick with vinyl. In those days, we lugged boxes of recordings to sell from the stage in three formats: CD, vinyl, and cassette! Streaming was something water did!\n\nEnough talk- here's the song (this is audio only, no video this week): Feeding the Flame (Willie Sordillo with Flor de CaÃ±a) 1990\n\nAs for present times, this Thursday at Old South Church's Jazz Worship, we will be absent our exceptional and beloved vocalist, ZoÃ« Krohne, who will have a week off. While we will miss her, I am excited that another old and dear friend and amazing singer will be stepping in to fill that role. Louise Grasmere has performed in a variety of settings, ranging from bands to a duo with her partner, percussionist Linda Shoemaker, but may be best known for her work with the Mystic Chorale, which is where we first met over 25 years ago. She has a voice that can fill any room with or without a mic, and is a masterful interpreter of any song she chooses to sing. If you've heard Louise, you know what I'm talking about- if not, you're in for a treat! Either way, please join us on March 9 at 6:00 pm (preludes start at 5:55) at Old South Church, 645 Boylston Street, Boston (on the corner of Boylston and Dartmouth in Copley Square).\n\nA final note: We lost a true legend on March 2 in saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter. His influence on how we hear and play jazz, from his work with Miles Davis and Weather Report to his solo recordings and work with Esperanza Spalding cannot be overstated. In his honor, pianist Matt Richard and bassist Doug Rich will join me in playing three of his compositions this Thursday.\n\nThanks for reading, listening to these songs, and supporting live music! Feel free to share any or all of this!\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nLenten Devotional on the theme Traveling Together Toward Easter (#1)\n\nJesus replied: ââLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.\" Matthew 22:37-39\n\nEvery other year, my friend Sox and I embark on a journey together, a pilgrimage, of sorts, to visit musical and cultural shrines which have significance to us. Our travels have brought us to the Newport Jazz Festival, the Woodstock Museum, the Rock ân Roll Hall of Fame, and a Native American Music and Dance Festival among other places.\n\nSox and I have been friends for nearly fifty years, and while we share a number of perspectives and passions, we have different dispositions when it comes to some matters. Sox is an enthusiastic and dedicated planner. He loves to do research and come up with detailed itineraries well in advance of any outing. When he packs for a road trip, a large cooler with many pre-planned meals is always included. I, on the other hand, like to make a sort of general plan and then see where the wind takes me, following my instinct and the inspiration of the moment. Both perspectives have merit, and these sojourns have been successful in part because we respect each otherâs place of comfort and compromise when it makes sense to. In fact, our perspectives balance each other, giving us a better outcome than either alone might produce. So while we may start the day with a âfixedâ plan, as we did the morning we visited the National Civil Rights Museum and were to visit another museum in the afternoon, we allow ourselves to abandon the plan, as we did on finding the Civil Rights Museum to be so profoundly moving that we spent more time there than we had scheduled. When we left, later than expected and emotionally wrung out, rather than keep to the plan and cram another museum in, we went to an old growth forest, where Sox walked while I played my saxophone to the trees. This flexibility and understanding of our differences and compassion for each otherâs needs is not only why our travels are sustaining, itâs a reason weâve maintained such a close friendship while living in different parts of the country for the great majority of those fifty years.\n\nI would venture that this is a good model for any deep relationship, whether a friendship, a marriage, a work partnership, or a community. Itâs not always easyâsometimes there is intense negotiation, and sometimes one party makes a greater sacrifice in the compromise than the otherâbut ultimately, the rewards are great, as lasting bonds are formed and deepened through the years, and each of us benefits from the otherâs perspective.\n\nCertainly, there are times when compromise is not possible. We need to stay true to our core values, particularly when issues of justice and equality are at stake. Yet, our challenge throughout our travels is to see the humanity in everyone, and remain open to finding our common ground. If it is sometimes challenging to find the middle ground with those we love, how much more so with those we may not know, and with whom we lack an embrace of shared passions, passionate, perhaps, only in our disagreement. But as we traverse the winding road of life, how might our lives be enhanced, and what might our world look like if we were able to see each otherâs differences, but also our similarities, and without necessarily agreeing, seek compromise when possible?\n\nUniting God, help us to see you in all whom we meet, to appreciate difference, and to learn to compromise where we can while holding fast to our principles of inclusion and justice for all. Amen.\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #6 and Live Music\n\nThis week's Song of the Week was written as a message, to myself, first and foremost, to respond to the climate crisis, but can apply as well to other crises of inequality and injustice. There's a little theological motivation in there, and the song reflects my belief that faith is expressed through action. Lest that all sound too heavy, political and biblical, it's an upbeat, rock 'n roll tune which hopes to inspire and motivate rather than depress and bring down. And my intention, as always, was to write lyrics imbued with some poetic qualities rather than coming across as a diatribe or pamphlet. But judge for yourself! Here's the link: Send Me\n\nI watched a video recently from one of the YouTube saxophone dudes I follow, Jay Metcalf from Better Sax, in which Jay showed scenes of several live concerts he attended recently.* While at the venues, he interviewed some of the top saxophone players on the scene today, specifically asking each how they got to the level of musicianship they had attained. There was one significant thing that every one of them cited: Going to hear great musicians play live. Though all had studied with great teachers, practiced countless hours, and listened to and watched videos of great performances over a lifetime of study, each said that nothing had more impact on their growth than seeing great musicians play in concert.\n\nFor me, personally, going out to hear live music has been one of the most important factors in my psychic recovery from the isolation of the Covid era. Though I listen to and watch a great deal of music via recordings and videos, and can be deeply moved by great songs and great performances in those formats, there is nothing like the joy I feel when listening to my friends play in small haunts in Cambridge or higher profile artists play at the Newport Jazz Festival. The energy of a live setting, where, under the best of circumstances, the musicians take risks and the audience response becomes part of the performance, creating a communal vibe which is much greater than the sum of its parts is pure magic, and it feeds my soul. And yes, there is also some mysterious learning that takes place when watching a great musician play live- I don't know how it happens, but I know that I have come home from a performance which moved me and at least to some degree, felt like I played better and in ways that I hadn't previously. And part of why all musicians want to play with musicians who are more advanced than they are is that great players lift up our own playing to a higher level.\n\nI write this in hopes of encouraging you to attend live performances to the degree that you feel comfortable at this stage in the Covid game. I've been to venues which required proof of vaccination and mandatory masking, and some which left it up to the individual. And as with everything else, each of us needs to abide by our own standard of comfort, weighing the potential benefits against the potential dangers. For me, the benefits have been enormous, and I've been willing to live with a certain amount of risk for that payoff. There is nothing like a live performance! So I hope you will consider this invitation in light of your own circumstances, to go out and hear and participate in a live performance, whether it's at the Lilypad in Cambridge, the Berklee Performance Center, Scullers, or Jazz Worship at Old South Church, where you will find me, ZoÃ« Krohne, Doug Rich and different piano players and guitarists each week. This week, Mark Shilansky joins us not only to play piano, but to join ZoÃ« on a couple of vocal duets. We start preludes at 5:55 pm. I hope to see you there!\n\n*You can watch Jay's video here: I Asked Top Saxophone Players How They Got So Good\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #5\n\nThe song I'm sending you this week is called, \"Unexceptional,\" and unless I've missed the mark, it's self-explanatory, so I won't say more. I hope you enjoy it, and if you care to pass it on to others, please feel free. Here's the link: Unexceptional\n\nAt Old South Church this week, Zoe, Doug and I will be joined by the always wonderful and inventive Mark Shilansky on piano. We'll be venturing into the sands of Lent with help from jazz compositions by Paul Desmond and Clifford Brown, as well as some well-loved hymns from the African American church tradition, a bossa nova, and a song that was a big hit on the country charts for Dierks Bentley. To find out how this all fits together, please join us at 6:00 on Thursday.\n\nFebruary 15, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #4\n\nThis week's Song of the Week is an instrumental which I titled \"Black Friday.\" One of the nice things about instrumentals is that while they are capable of creating a stong mood, they can tell any story that mood may conjure in each individual listener. This is another one written during the period when I was challenging myself to write a song a week that I felt comfortable performing in public. That initiative arose in large part as the result of a friend in Indiana inviting me to perform as part of a concert series he curated in Fort Wayne, with the directive to play my \"most authentic music\" as opposed to just rehashing standards. In part because my primary public playing for a number of years has been at the weekly jazz service at Old South Church, where I choose songs primarily to support the theme of each particular service, as opposed to developing a repertoire in the way that a working band might, my internal response to my friend's invitation was, \"What is my authentic music at this point in my life?\" I am grateful to Ketu for prompting that question, as it sparked a period of intense creativity for me. And especially as I began my performing career as a guitar playing singer-songwriter, though I have aspired to be the best guitarist and saxophonist I'm capable of, I think my most unique and authentic voice has been through my songwriting. I love lyrics that tell a story or convey an aspect of our common human experience with a minimum of well-crafted words, and have worked hard over many years to sharpen my skills in service of that goal; but I have been just as deeply moved by say, an improvised lyrical solo by Paul Desmond which is equally honed, with just the necessary, well-chosen notes, sculpted to something as lean and incisive as a well-written and editied composition, and at the same time, deeply evocative on an emotional level. I've been moved by Desmond's playing since my sophomore year in high school when an upper classman invited me to join his band and turned me on to the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Though I have been moved and inspired by many other musicians and genres over a lifetime of listening and playing, I've come back to that music frequently over the course of my life, and it has never failed to move me deeply.\n\nI'm miles away from Paul Desmond, but here's my instrumental, \"Black Friday,\" recorded at home during the pandemic by me, Doug Rich and Erez Dessel: Black Friday I hope itsays something to you.\n\nTomorrow at Old South Church, Doug, Zoe and I will be joined by a very special guest and longtime friend, Jacqueline Schwab. You may know her as the Americana pianist who has played on the majority of Ken Burns films and recorded albums dedicated to particular styles or periods of American music, like her album of songs related to Mark Twain. Or you may be a county dance fan, and know her as part of the popular ensemble, Bare Necessities. Or perhaps you saw her accompanying folk legend Jean Redpath on the David Letterman show. It's less likely that you were at the White House when she performed there, but you might have seen her on PBS playing with the American Pops Orchestra or GBH's recent Holiday Celebration. Jacqueline and I have performed together on an occasional basis over a number of years, and while our musical backgrounds are very different, we have found places in the middle, between her strengths and mine, which stretch us both and can lead to exhilierating results! The thing which comes through most strongly for me in all of Jacqueline's playing is that while she is technically brilliant, she embues every note with a very deep passion and intention. And that's a powerful combination, where most of the best music resides!\n\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #3\n\nThis week's song is one that I composed for a very specific occasion, but with the intention of writing it in a way that I hope allows multiple interpretations, based on the frame of reference and personal experience each listener brings to it. For some, the impetus in writing the song may be obvious, while for others, perhaps not. I hope that however you interpret this, it will have meaning for you; and whatever meaning you may find in the song is the correct one! Here's a link: Sacrifice\n\nTomorrow's Jazz Worship service at Old South Church will focus on reconciliation and the notion of giving up seeing others as enemies, with implications for what is needed to achieve or at least move toward racial justice. The spoken word message from Katherine on these themes will be supplanted by music from Duke Ellington, Iris Dement and others, with sprinklings of bossa nova and funky Valentines added for good measure. Guitarist John Baboian joins Zoe, Doug and me in the band. We start with a prelude at 5:55 pm in Gordon Chapel. Hope to see you!\n\nFebruary 1, 2023\n\nSong of the Week #2\n\nThank you for the positive response to last week's \"Song of the Week.\" I really appreciate both that you listened to it, and that you took the additional time to write to me. Thank you!\n\nToday I'm sending you the most recent song that I've written. The recording is from its debut (and so far, only) performance last week at Old South Church. So while this is less polished than a song we've played longer and allowed to find its own groove or recorded under more controlled circumstances, I'm following the advice of Bob Reynolds, one of the saxophone gurus I follow, who says, \"Can't wait for perfect!\" Indeed, at this stage of life, I am far more interested in getting things out there than in chasing unattainable perfection, even as I continue to strive to improve.\n\nI think the song speaks for itself, so I won't say too much more about it, other than this was one where the words came very fast, in the middle of the night, and my job was just to listen to the voice in my head and write down what was coming through. Unlike most songs I write, where the music comes easier than the words, I struggled in putting these words to music, going through numerous iterations to land where I did, though as I listen to this now, there's nothing complex about the music. I guess the challenge was in writing something that captured the mood I was after, allowing the words to come through and balancing the darkness of the verses with a sense of positivity, and that didn't sound suspiciously like another song I'd been listening to recently! I hope you like it! Live Every Moment: A Note to Myself\n\nWhile I'm here, I want to express gratitude for the opportunity we had this past Sunday to play for worship at Pilgrim Church in Duxbury. We're told that there were many more people in attendance than on a usual Sunday, in large part, I believe, because people came hoping for meaning, solace and the support of community as that town reeled from the tragic deaths of three children earlier in the week. I believe strongly in the healing power of music, and of people coming together in community, and I beleive some healing took place in that hour, so I am grateful that we were able to participate in this gathering. When I get side-tracked, trying too hard to be as good as the saxophone players who inspire me (and whom I am not even in the same universe as), it's good to be reminded that gatherings like this one are what I am meant to be doing. Being inspired by greatness is good; striving to improve is good; but one doesn't have to be John Coltrane to follow one's calling and to do good.\n\nI am also grateful that tomorrow evening at Old South Church I will be playing with the same band which played on Sunday, comprised of Zoe Krohne, Doug Rich and Mark Shilansky. We'll be playing our usual eclectic mix of spirituals, a bossa nova by Antonio Carlos Jobim, a ballad by Charles Mingus, a lighter piece by Duke Ellington, and a song by one of our favorite contemporary jazz singers, Lizz Wright. We start preludes at 5:55 pm in Gordon Chapel at Old South Church in Boston, or you can watch online.\n\nJanuary 25, 2023\n\nThis Week and Song of the Week\n\nIt's been a hard week with the mass shootings in California, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the tragic and at this point still mysterious deaths of two children in Duxbury, where I will be playing this coming Sunday morning. Among so many other things. I won't try to offer false hope or piety in the face of this, but I do believe that our only recourse is to find support in the communities we're part of, and to continue to work in those communities for peace, equality and sustainability. I feel this especially strongly as the grandparent of two beautiful children, and wonder what kind of world we're sending them into.\n\nThough music has been at the center of my life for most of my life, I don't see making music as a solution. But I do see it as something which can help us through some difficult times so that we have the strength to become part of the solution. The songs of others have given me great joy, moved me in ways that mere words cannot, and inspired me both to go on living, and to live a creative life in whatever ways I can. And I have written songs to help myself make sense of the world around me and the feelings within me. My hope is that by sharing them, other people might find a common experience or feeling expressed, or even be led to look at something from a different perspective than they had previously encountered.\n\nTo this end, I would like to begin sharing songs I've written over the course of my life through this format. I'll put a link to one song a week in an email and send it out. You can take it or leave it. If you like it enough to share it with others, I would be honored, but I have no expectations in doing this- it's there, and you can respond to it in whatever ways you like, or not at all!\n\nThis week's song is called Generosity, and was written in early 2019, before the pandemic came around and changed everything. At the time, I was in the midst of a task I set for myself of writing at least one song a week that I felt good enough about to perform in public. This song was one of those. The recording was done from the separate homes of the five musicians involved during the pandemic, when that was the only way we could create music. Each musician recorded their part to the recorded tracks of whomever had recorded before them, the audio tracks were then mixed to create the stereo track, and Doug Rich put together the video which you see here, lining up the videos each of us had made of ourselves recording our parts with the stereo mix I sent him. The musicans are: Doug Rich, bass; Zoe Krohne, vocals; Erez Dessell, keyboard; Michael Patterson, guitar, and me playing alto saxophone. I hope you enjoy it. Here's the link: Generosity\n\nAs usual, Zoe, Doug and I will be playing for Jazz Worship at Old South Church in Boston this Thursday, starting a few minutes before 6:00 pm. This week we'll be joined by guitar virtuoso John Baboian. We are continuing to livestream these services as well as offering them to an in-person congregation. We'd love for you to join us in person, but we're also grateful when you tune in on-line. You can do that through this link: Old South Livestream. You can find archived versions of past services through that link as well.\n\nAnd if you happen to be in the Duxbury area this Sunday, Doug, Zoe, Mark Shilansky and I will be playing for worship at Pilgrim Congregational Church starting a few minutes before 10:00 am.\n\nThanks for reading, and may you be well.\n\nApril 10, 2022\n\nClear Water\n\nWashing has as much impact on our emotional well-being as it does on our physical health. Weâre more ready to meet the challenges of the day when fresh from a morning shower, free of the grime and stress of yesterday. We have a fresh start. Water cleanses our bodies and our souls.\n\nI wrote the song below in 1989, but as history has evolved, so has the song, with one of the original verses no longer describing the present state of the world, and other events coming to the fore. That verse has now been re-written twice. Perhaps this is as it should be in a song which employs water as its central metaphor: like a river whose path shifts over time with the rising and falling waters, water not only cleanses us, but changes us, ever changing beings in an ever changing world.\n\nYou can watch a video recording of this song here: Clear Water- Willie Sordillo Jazz Ensemble\n\nYou can listen to the original version here: Clear Water - Flor de Cana\n\nAll over this world I see my people suffering and dying\n\nI see them hungry and homeless at my door and over the sea\n\nBut I know, yes I know just as sure as I'm breathing and walking\n\nThat a people that's bound up is one day bound to be free\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd the clear water come down, wash away the pain in my heart\n\nAnd the clear water come down, cleanse my soul\n\nAnd the clear water come down, wash away the pain in my heart\n\nAnd the clear water come down, cleanse my soul\n\nIn South Africa there's a man who spent half his life in a jail\n\nIn Memphis they shot down a man who once had a dream\n\nBut you can't kill a dream and you can't keep a dream behind the walls of a cell\n\nWhen they unlocked that door, Nelson was already walking free\n\nChorus\n\nSometimes it feels like all reason and right are gone from this land\n\nEven a plague is a weapon when truth bows to lies\n\nBut Black Lives still Matter; we canât give up now; we canât live in fear\n\nItâs our time to walk in the arc with eyes on the prize\n\nChorus\n\nApril 3, 2022\n\nToo Much Water\n\nFor my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die. Genesis 6:17\n\nWe understand water as the essential nectar of life, a source of nourishment and cleansing, physically and spiritually. We marvel at and are enriched by the beauty and peace of a flowing stream, a placid lake, the constancy of waves breaking on an ocean shore, the seeming endlessness of the seas. We are blessed by the gift of water.\n\nWhat then, do we make of it when thereâs too much water? Where is the blessing when the rains donât stop, the dam bursts, and the flood waters come? Twenty days in, Noah was likely giving God thanks for the ark, but of the rain saying, âReally, God?â How might the people of New Orleans have felt about water when the levees broke and the city filled up like a giant, poisonous bathtub, obliterating homes and lives? How do we feel about the inevitable storms and rising tides that are the result of climate change we have brought upon ourselves?\n\nPerhaps when thereâs too much water, when we feel ourselves submerged and drowning, see our crops flooded and the rain unceasing, God is giving us a warning: Too much of a good thing is never a good thing; curb your greed. In a world where we often assume that more is better, maybe God is reminding us to be mindful of what is precious: the resource of water, certainly; and also the resource of community, which requires that we preserve it by sharing and caring for each other rather than seeking to gain and hoard as much as we can for ourselves. All that glitters is not gold; but the glint of the sun off a breaking wave might signal that some things are more precious than gold. Will we choose to squander our fortune on short-term satisfaction, ignoring the long-term consequences of our wastefulness in service of our perceived self-interest; or will we choose to conserve and mindfully share our resources, using only what we need while attending to the health of our wider community and the prospect of sustained viability for generations to come? How will we respond to too much water? When the waters rise and reclaim the land on which you built your house, do you hear God speaking?\n\nBeneficent God, help us to discern your voice when we are overwhelmed in the abundance of your gifts, drowning in your generosity. May we understand your message to us, and may we take responsibility to adjust our behavior accordingly. May we feed your sheep. All of them. Amen.\n\nMarch 21, 2022\n\nLet It Rain\n\nIn 1985 I spent three months in Nicaragua on one of several trips I made there during the 1980âs. It was both a hopeful and challenging time, as the people had succeeded in ousting a brutal dictator and were sowing the seeds of a more equitable society, but came under military attack from Contra rebels who supported the old order.\n\nDuring these months, my home base was Managua, where I lived with a family in their shotgun style home with a dirt floor in the main building, and an outhouse and chickens running free in the back yard. The infrastructure in Managua had been depleted first by a devastating earthquake in 1972 which left much of the city un-reconstructed as the dictator pocketed most of the relief money which came in from around the world, and now the Contra war. During those three months, there was also a drought.\n\nOne result of all of this was that water became a precious commodity, something to be careful in rationing if not hoarding. Running water was shut off in different sections of the city on different days, such that any given part of town had running water three or four days a week. Meanwhile, rain barrelsâoften replenished on the running water days rather than by rainâcollected water needed for drinking, cooking, bathing, and even pouring down toilets, as the only means of flushing waste. Actually, rather than becoming a precious commodity, everyone became extremely attuned to how precious water is at all times.\n\nSometimes we need to be deprived of something we take for granted to fully appreciate its value. While I complain when the water isnât hot enough in my comfortable home in Framingham, in Managua, in those times, nothing felt as luxurious as the ice cold shower I was able to take every few days. Even mud from a brief downpour can become a welcome sight when the same torrent which created it washes away the brown dust and fills our rain barrels, giving hope for the continuance of life.\n\nWe live in a time of many challenges now. In our fractured world we witness many things weâve taken for granted becoming scarce. How much deprivation is necessary before we are willing to take measures necessary to protect the bounty of water and other resources we consume? How do we maintain hope in bleak times, when greed and the drive for short term profits impede our ability to maintain a planet that sustains life? From what fount shall we fill our rain barrels with water and hope?\n\nIf God is like water, life-giving and essential to our being, what will it take for us to appreciate this aquifer we take for granted? What will it take for us to realize that in this waterfall lies our hope?\n\nBountiful God, pour down on us in torrents, but let us not take this bounty for granted. Give us hope, but give us the courage to take the hard and necessary steps which turn hope into being. Amen.\n\nDecember 29, 2021\n\nSunday not Thursday\n\nWhile it's tempting to feel sorry for ourselves having to live through these strange times, the Christmas story, if we heed the context, is a stark reminder that the world has long been a troubled place in need of healing, and as hard as these times seem, they are and always have been, even in the best of times, much harder for some people than others. But the Christmas story is also a reminder that there is hope; that another way is possible, even if sometimes hard to envision and always hard to attain. We get a glimpse of that ray of elusive possibility cutting through the shadows as we approach a new year and an Epiphany. We will endeavor to reflect that beam of hope this week at Old South Church.\n\nThere will not be Jazz Worship this Thursday. However, the Jazz Ensemble will be providing music for All-Church Worship this coming Sunday, January 2 at 10:00 AM. Our musical selections will help us walk with the Magi and see the newborn babe through the eyes of a child. Our sources included traditional favorites of the season, a French carol from the 15th century, and a contemporary telling of the story from our friend, Matt Myer Boulton. Our pianist this week, Consuelo Candelaria-Barry, is another old friend, and a musician of great depth with an ear for beauty and a touch to match.\n\nPlease join us in person or from your computer.\n\nNovember 30, 2021\n\nThis Week, This Month and a New Recording\n\nFor those of us who celebrate Christmas, weâve just entered the season of Advent, a time of waiting and expectation, and one which I normally associate with darkness, and specifically the âdarkness before the lightâ variety. It sometimes feels like weâve been in a sort of darkness and waiting for the past couple of years, so as I think about Advent, one of my internal responses is, âSo what else is new?â But to be fair, there have been some bright pools of radiance in the midst of the bleak, and itâs probably a better idea for me to focus on those, carrying over the invitation to invest in gratitude that Thanksgiving provides, prodding my sense of expectation that more light lies just ahead, though maybe around a corner or two.\n\nAt Old South Church in the coming weeks, we will try to balance our embrace of the darkness with our hope for better days to come. Our musical offerings will include some of my favorite paeans to the dark, but we will also tender refrains which inspire joy. Well, hope, peace, joy and love, the four sisters of the season. We inaugurate this endeavor this Thursday evening, December 2, with preludes starting at about 5 minutes before 6:00 pm, both in-person and on-line. Joining ZoÃ« Krohne, Doug Rich and I this week will be Carolyn Wilkins, the author of several works of fiction and non-fiction, and a psychic as well as a gifted pianist and long-time teacher at Berklee College of Music. Also, happily, an old friend of ours. As is our practice, we will be drawing on music of varied origin both secular and sacred rather than relying on either pure jazz or church sources, though all of it spiritual in the way music of meaning, whether sung or played, by necessity is. So whether Advent is your thing or not, I hope there will be something among this collection that will meet you where you are and draw you in a bit. The repertoire will include a jazz standard, a song from Sara Bareilles and Joe Tippett, one by Andrae Crouch, and rather unintentionally, half a dozen by me, among other things. To join us, either come with your mask to 645 Boylston Street in Copley Square, or settle in in front of your computer at home via Old South Church on Livestream\n\nFor the remainder of the month, our pianist will be the always inventive Mark Shilansky. As in previous years, this series will culminate in our Blue Christmas service on December 23. More on that in a future mailing.\n\nIncidentally, if youâve been watching these on-line and noticed occasional difficulties with the sound reproduction, weâve just invested in some new equipment which Iâm hoping we will be able to employ this week and which I am very hopeful (notice the Advent connection there) will have a positive impact in how we sound over the World Wide Web. There has definitely been a learning curve to going hybrid, but I think weâve made a lot of progress to this point and that this next step will bring us much closer to helping you feel that youâre in the room with us, even as you watch from home.\n\nFinally, on another note, one of the bright spots I alluded to earlier was the chance to go into a recording studio in Western Mass one day this summer with my good friend, Bert Marshall, and record a track for his new CD. (Yes, they still make those!) I love Bertâs songwriting, singing, guitar playing and arranging, and Iâm very excited that the album is now officially out! If youâd like to hear samples and/or purchase it, you can find download information at Hearnow.com. If you prefer to have a physical CD, those are available from Amazon.com .\n\nThatâs it for now- hope to see you soon, and thank you for reading!\n\nNovember 3, 2021\n\nSo Long, Facebook\n\nI de-activated my Facebook account this week. I had planned to delete it, but gave in to the less definitive option of de-activating, which means I can come back without losing anything thatâs been previously posted if I get cold feet. I initially created an account when my daughter was in her adolescent years, mostly so I could keep track, more or less, of what she was up to. Once in that world, I found myself entranced by the ability to re-connect with friends from my own youth as well as keep abreast of the comings and goings of friends closer to home. It seemed like a little bit of magic that I could remain in contact with people I met on a visit to Chile without the delay of international mail, and that we could exchange photos as well as words, with a minimum of effort. And of course, I thought I needed a social media presence to sustain a musical career. My daughter, meanwhile, closed her account ages ago, abandoning this medium taken over by older folks for more hip platforms, and has never looked back.\n\nThe reasons to leave Facebook are many and obvious. My biggest objections are political. Facebook is an ideal medium for the spread of lies and misinformation which have harmful effects. Despite the fact that it is also a medium which can aid the spread of truths, we know how siloed we all are. It would be exceedingly difficult to find a single person whose mind was changed by a Facebook post. So the medium becomes a platform for organizing others who share preconceived political views, and we have seen the disastrous results when those views are based on lies and misinformation, passed along unmediated, even when the mediator surely knows they are providing the current for those lies. And we have seen how Facebook has responded to those who have called them out for their role in promoting hate speech and lies. I do not wish to support Mark Zuckerberg and his type in gaining obscene profits from such destructive and reckless behaviors. Yes, I believe in free speech; I also believe (as does our legal system) that some forms of speech, like slander, are excepted from âfreeâ speech. I do not consider lies and hate speech \"free\" either.\n\nNext is the pervasive invasion of privacy and increased vulnerability to predators through cybercrime that using these platforms presents. It freaks me out that after visiting the website of a musical supply house, the saxophone reeds I just ordered or the microphone I merely looked at shows up in a targeted ad on Facebook. Iâm not under the allusion that leaving Facebook eliminates this invasiveness, but anything I can do to minimize the notion that I am being spied on 24/7 is a good thing.\n\nAnd finally, there are the countless hours I have spent scrolling through posts. While Iâm grateful to know of news from my friends and to be made aware of other news, recordings and articles that I might have otherwise missed, I wonder how many songs I might have written, how much better a musician I would be if Iâd spent even half of that time with my instrument instead of looking at a photo of the scrumptious meal my friends ate last night.\n\nThe big plus, of course, is that it is a handy and immediate form of communication, and communication is paramount in my book. Music, for me, is all about communication. And in a world which communicates more and more exclusively on social media platforms, it seems foolish on some levels, or at least naive, to withdraw from a medium which so many people depend on to stay connected. Perhaps this will ultimately draw me back in...weâll see. Short of becoming a hermit, there is no getting away from the internet world, and I will continue to communicate with you through these messages, and to maintain a website www.williesordillo.com and a YouTube channel, where I will post new music videos from time to time.\n\nThank you for reading this, and for your support! As always, if you would no longer like to find things like this in your inbox, shoot me an email and I will take you off the list- you do not need to provide a reason.\n\nIn the meantime, Iâm looking forward to another Jazz Worship service at Old South Church in Boston this Thursday, November 4. We will be focusing on those whoâve gone before us and the ways our community supports each other in times of grief and loss. There will be a ritual to call forth the ancestors, a message from our seminarian, Jess Young Chang, and music from the jazz and African American Spiritual traditions as well as a new instrumental I composed for this service. Our good friend, pianist and singer David Hunte joins ZoÃ« Krohne, Doug Rich and me in the band. We begin with preludes at about 5:50 pm. If youâre not able to attend in person, you can watch via livestream through Old South Church on Livestream\n\nI hope to see you soon!\n\nApril 7, 2021\n\nYou Be the Judge\n\nIf youâve been reading these emails or attending our Virtual Jazz Coffeehouses with any regularity, maybe youâve noticed that quite a few of the songs weâve chosen to play since the pandemic began have been from a particular era, the 1960s and â70s. This was a time of great social, cultural and political ferment and change, in which artistic and musical creativity both responded to and propelled all that was going on. And a lot was going on, including the War in Viet Nam, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Womenâs Movement as well as the burgeoning of Flower Power and nearly universal use of marijuana among young people. It also happens to be the era in which I spent my teens and twenties. So as I approach one of those milestone birthdays, I ask myself, âAm I choosing these songs because of the relevance they hold today, or because the music from that time really was better then than itâs ever been; or am I just getting old?â Before you answer that, consider some of the composers whose works weâve played:\n\nBob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, George Harrison, John Coltrane, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Bill Withers, Leonard Cohen, Eric Clapton, Charlie Parker, James Taylor, Dave Brubeck.....\n\nI suspect that thereâs some truth in answering in the affirmative to all of those questions. I do choose songs for their relevance to the themes of our services and in response to the events taking place in our current world, and I believe that these songs written 40-50 years ago speak to those issues eloquently and in artistically engaging ways. And yes, there is an element of nostalgia there for me as well, which I suspect is there for some of you, too. This is not to say that there havenât been great songs written since, and I fully support the younger voices that have risen to create new forms of expression and which have, in some cases, addressed our current political context head on. But another significant matter is authenticity, and I believe that it is critical that anyone whose intention is to create meaningful artistic expression must speak from their own experience and context. And beyond cultural appropriation, would you really want to hear me rap, anyway?\n\nTonight at the Virtual Jazz Coffeehouse we are asking the question, âShould we be afraid of the dark?â We will hear Nancy Taylorâs always insightful words in response to that question, and a poem by Emily Dickenson. Our musical contribution to the conversation comes from that rich era of my youth: Paul Simon, Jesse Colin Young, George Harrison and Mary Lou Williams. Yeah, Iâm getting old, but I defy you to find better sources of inspiration than this!\n\nPlease join us at 6:00 pm this evening: Jazz Coffee House 4/8/21 on Livestream\n\nAnd if youâd like to consider our question of the day further via Zoom following the service: Jazz Coffee House | Old South Church in Boston, MA\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPeace and love,\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nBirdsong and Bob Dylan\n\nBird vocalizations can be divided into two distinct categories. While both bird calls and bird songs are used to communicate things related to survival, songs are used in situations where birds feel secure. They tend to be louder, longer and, as one would expect, a lot more musical than calls, which among other things, indicate alarm or a threat to territory.\n\nWe humans, of course, vocalize in a variety of ways as well, though for some of us, singing feels more natural than to others. There are reasons for this: some people are gifted with naturally beautiful voices; some seem to have a genetic propensity for music; some are born into a family where music and singing are nurtured, encouraged and shared; and some people have had unfortunate experiences of being discouraged from developing their innate instinct to sing.\n\nIn my case, though playing a musical instrument was encouraged and lessons were part of my life from an early age, I was not a singer. I did not feel good about my singing voice, and I did not enjoy it. I sang when I was told to in school, and in church, where the hymns always seemed to be in the wrong key for me, and made me yawn as I attempted to keep up. Though music was a big part of my life through high school, I left the singing to others whenever I had the option.\n\nThough I was already familiar with Bob Dylanâs music, when I got to college I started delving into it in a much deeper way, and began to learn to play some of his songs on guitar. But it was his voice that was the revelation: he didnât sing like anybody elseâhe sort of spat out the words in a talk-sing kind of way, and didnât worry about it being pretty. And it worked. Moreover, it gave me permission to sing, too. I realized then that it didnât have to be pretty to be effective, and that the point was to communicate in my own voice rather than try to sound some way I couldnât. This opening eventually led to voice lessons, practice, and improvement. I never became a great singer, but I was able to find a place in the world of folk music, which was more accepting of a variety of vocal styles and timbre than some other genres, and was even able to make a meagre living as a travelling folk singer for a time.\n\nI am very much aware of my limits as a singer in my current band, where Iâm standing next to someone whose singing routinely moves people to great depths through a combination of sincerity and an exceptionally beautiful instrument. I have found that my truest, most effective singing voice comes through an alto saxophone. But every so often I will sidle up to a mic and chirp out a harmony to ZoÃ«âs transcendent melody, and there is joy in that. And like birdsong, it comes from a place of security.\n\nBy now, Iâm sure youâve figured out that in telling my story, Iâm talking about things that I believe are universally true. Hereâs what I think we can learn from birdsong and Bob Dylan:\n\n1. Singing comes naturally if itâs not discouraged (ask any bird).\n\n2. Singing isnât always about singingâmaybe thereâs something else youâd like to do that you havenât been encouraged to do or thought you couldnât do.\n\n3. We can learn to do things we thought we werenât any good at, in our own way and time, and with guidance from people skilled at what we want to learn who communicate well.\n\n4. We each have a unique voice, a unique path to follow. The trick is to find yours and run with it.\n\n5. Context matters. What is appreciated in one context may not be in another. Find out where your voice is needed and will be heard.\n\n6. The pretty way isnât always the best way.\n\nWhat would you add to this list?\n\nI know thereâs a bird that sings, âBobwhiteâ¦.Bobwhiteâ¦.Bobwhiteâ¦..â Somewhere, thereâs got to be one that sings, âBobDylanâ¦.BobDylanâ¦.BobDylan.â\n\nMusical God, Help us overcome the discouraging messages weâve received, and help each of us find our unique voice. Let us sing with sincerity, whether or not our song is the prettiest song in the forest, and help us appreciate the many and varied songs which come through the trees to reach our ears. Amen.\n\nMarch 18, 2021\n\nSuffering, Death and Living Well\n\nLast weekâs Virtual Jazz Coffeehouse theme was suffering, and this weekâs is death. Itâs our way of saying, donât get too excited about the onset of spring and the expanding availability of the vaccine- thereâs plenty of suffering left to go âround and in the end, we all die. Just in case you were wondering.\n\nWell, actually, itâs more about making meaning of those ever-present realities, and moreover, how our understanding of them affects the way we choose to live. This weekâs question, âShould we fear death?â like previous weekâs questions, seems simplistic on the surface- my glib self responds, âOf course we shouldnât....but what we should do and what we actually do are frequently not the same thingâ- and provokes more questions than answers. A glance at the New York Times daily digest and I think maybe a better question is, âShould we fear life?â\n\nWe will attempt to address some of this through song and spoken word this evening, and I promise you, our intention is to leave you with more reason to feel hopeful than discouraged or overwhelmed. Aiding us in this undertaking are two songs Iâve long loved by two musicians I admire greatly: Greg Brownâs âBrand New Angel,â which was sung by Jeff Bridges in one of my favorite movies, Crazy Heart, and âEvery Little Moment,â by my friend and mentor, Billy Novick, whom you may have heard play in a variety of situations ranging from Club Passim to Prairie Home Companion to John Sayles movies to major ballet companies in Washington, DC and China. We will add to this archived songs from traditional sources and Sweet Honey in the Rockâs Ysaye Barnwell. Regardless of the darkness of the times or the topic, through it all, music remains a balm for me. And I hope for you as well.\n\nPlease join us at 6:00 this evening at https://livestream.com/oldsouth\n\nFinally, hereâs a replay of one of the songs from last weekâs service: Willie's YouTube Channel\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nMarch 6, 2021\n\nSoaring (A Lenten Devotional on the theme, \"Nesting, Singing, Soaring\")\n\nAnd I say, âO that I had wings like a dove!\n\nI would fly away and be at rest;\n\nTruly, I would flee far away;\n\nI would lodge in the wilderness;\n\nI would hurry to find a shelter for myself\n\nfrom the raging wind and tempest.\n\nPsalm 55:6-8\n\nNesting, singing, soaringâ¦.it sounds so idyllicâespecially soaring, after nearly a year of getting all too familiar with nesting! How many times have I wished to lift my wings and leave the ground, and with it, all of my earthly burdens as I soar off to some faraway tropical island where Covid doesnât exist and hateful politicians hold no sway! In this happy state, I would be sure to be singing all the way! Ah, to be a feathered birdâthat would be the life!\n\nBut as it is with most things, the reality of a birdâs life is not as carefree and easy as we might like to think. There is the constant scavenging for food, the responsibility of caring for the chicks, the need to pick up and move in response to seasonal changes which are less regular than they were in pre-climate change times, and of course, the ever-present danger of predators. As much as we want to believe a bird can just fly off at the first sign of danger, anyone whoâs ever lived with a cat with outdoor privileges has probably had the experience of being greeted by their darling fur-ball with a mouthful of feathers in offering. And birds, themselves, like the hawks which swoop down to grab an unwitting bunny for lunch, can be predators. Nature is a glorious thing, and it is, among other things, a brutal struggle for survival in which the stronger, better adapted or more shrewd literally feed off the weaker, slower and guileless.\n\nThe facts of the natural world are not an analogy for human activity; we are part of the natural world, and as such, subject to the same needs, dangers, and struggle for survival. We can be and frequently are brutal and predatory in this pursuit. And as with our tendency to romanticize birds, we are prone to reducing our view of human nature to simplified terms. We tend to see things in black and white, good vs. evil. But as it is with birds, our reality is more complex, nuanced and multi-layered. Good and evil live in all of us and are always at war, always present, even in our better moments. When I do a good deed, am I not it in part, doing it to stroke my own ego, as well as out of genuine concern for others?\n\nThere is a positive side to this: if I believe that good and evil both live in everyone, then I must believe that even the most hateful of people has within them the seed of goodness that might be nurtured, that the hope of change for the better is always present.\n\nThis complexity, this ongoing struggle to shift the balance in favor of the good most of the time and the fact that we sometimes lose this battle, giving in to our darker passions of fear, hatred, judgement, and selfishness does not make us horrible people. It makes us complex beings. It makes us human. The struggle between good and evil goes on within us as individuals, and it goes on in the wider world of which we are a small part. The fact that this struggle will go on without end, good never vanquishing evil in this realm, whether within us or in the larger picture, does not mean that we should give up on striving for goodness; it means that we need to keep working toward it, trying to shift the balance in the direction of good, even with the knowledge of its unattainability. When we accept the reality of the world as it is, rather than romanticizing it, and continue to work for good in spite of the sure knowledge that we will falter along the w"
