Joseph Jackson Engle was born in Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia), November 25, 1832, and died at his home, near Berryville, Va., Septem her 4, 1911. Brother Engle was converted at a camp meeting in Hampshire County when a youth, and joined the Methodist Church, and, feeling called of God to preach, was duly licensed a local preach er. His name first appears in the minutes bf the Baltimore Conference in 1856. That year he traveled Wardensville Circuit as junior preacher. Then one year each on Christiansburg, Newport, and Newcastle circuits. In 1861 he was at Salem with J. C. Dice, and in 1862-3 he served as Baltimore Conference^ 1912. 13 chaplain in the Confederate Army. His health failing, he left the army, and in 1864-5 he traveled Rockbridge Circuit. He was appointed to Mount Sidney at the Conference of 1866, and served there three years. He was appointed to Churchville Circuit in 1869, and served there three years: 1872-3, Bridgewater; 1874-7, Roan- oke; 1878-81, Freedom. His old army trouble returning, he asked a superan- nuate relation at the Conference of 1882, and was never able to reenter the effective ranks. It is easy to estimate the life of a man as ingenuous as J. J. Engle. He had no concealments. Frank, manly, noble in his life before God and men, he lived his life as a Christian and a citizen, and no man questioned his honesty and sincerity. He was a converted man, and never doubted his relation to God as his Father, and he considered his call to the ministry of Jesus Christ as direct and sure as were the convictions that led him to faith in the Saviour. He was not very demon- strative, but never hesitated to tell what God had done for him. Great revivals were the fruit of his ministry, and many whom he led to Christ doubtless w'el- comed him when at last he got home. He was a Methodist of the old sort, and be- lieved in his Church and her doctrines. Nor did he follow blindly any man, but read and thought for himself, and the more he read and thought the more firm- ly he held to the interpretation the Meth- odist Church gives to the word of God, and the more gladly be preached her theology. He received the Bible as the inspired word of God, and strove to form his life according to the divine precepts. Brother Engle was for thirty years or more a sufferer, but never complained. Believing that what he suffered was by the will of God, he bore each day’s pain patiently in hope of the rest at last in heaven. During the last few months of his life there was a strikingly beautiful smile which came now and then as he talked with some friends, and that grew in sweetness as he drew near the end. The end came suddenly, and he passed away without pain. After a restless night, his daughter went to his bedside toward the morning and spoke to him, but there was no response, the spirit had passed up to God. December, 1862, Brother Engle was married to Miss Mary Isabelle Goodwin, of Botetourt County, Va., who survives him, together with two children. Rev. J. S. Engle, a member of tbe Baltimore Conference. Mothodist Episcopal Church, South, and Mrs. Mamie Gaunt. For nearly fifty years she was his counselor and helper in his work for God, bearing with him the toil of the itinerant life, and now' looking to the reunion with her husband in heaven. A good man has gone to be with his God and Saviour. — •/. T. Williams. Asbury Capertox McNeeb, son of A. B. and Sarah T. McNeer, was born January 2, 1845, near Salt Sulphur Springs, W. Va., and departed this life December 19, 1911, in his home, near Alderson, W. Va. He was of Scotch descent, and the oldest child of a family of nine children. Two brothers and six sisters survive him. Brother McNeer was married three times. His first marriage was with Miss Marietta Deisher, of Botetourt County, Va. His second was with Miss Frances R. Circle, of Botetourt, Va. There were three chil- dren by this marriage: Ella D., Rembert D., a member of the Baltimore Conference, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Emerald B. McNeer, all of whom are liv- ing. His third marriage was with Miss Mattie Horn Nulty, of Rockbridge County, Va., who survives him, and now mourns the loss of a kind and faithful husband. By the last marriage there were five chil- dren, four of whom survive. A. C. Mc- Neer was converted in his boyhood. At the age of thirteen years he took upon himself the vows of Church membership. This was largely the early fruitage of Christian training received in the home of his childhood. His parents w'ere faith- ful members of the Methodist Church, and their home was pervaded by a Christian atmosphere. In 1868 Brother McNeer was licensed to exhort by the Quarterly Con- i ference of Centerville Circuit, held at j Johnson’s Cross Roads, Rev. J. H. Waugh | presiding. Soon thereafter he was li- ; censed to preach, and preached his first j sermon in his home church. In 1870 he < served on Blue Sulphur Circuit under j the presiding elder, and was admitted on trial . in the traveling connection, in the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in the spring of 1871, at the session of the Conference held in Salem, Va., Bishop Pierce presid- ing. His first appointment was to War- densville Circuit as junior preacher with Rev. William Hedges, as preacher in charge. In 1872-3 he served Alleghany Circuit; 1874, ^Montgomery Circuit, Md., with Rev. William A. McDonald, preacher in charge; 1875. South Fork Mission; Baltimore Conference, 1912. 1876, Hardy Mission; 1877-9, Bath Circuit; 1880-1, New Castle; 1882, Mount Bethel; 1884-6, James River; 1887-9, Furnace Mis- sion; 1890-1, Rockingham Circuit; 1892-4, West Augusta; 1895-7, Greenville, W. Va.: 1898-9, Rockbridge Baths. In 1900 he was appointed the second tln\\e to Bath Circuit; 1901-2, to Collierstown; 1903, ap- pointed the second time to Alleghany Cir- cuit, where he served three more years. Here the itinerant career of this faithful, uncomplaining servant of God closed. In 1906 he felt compelled to request a place upon the retired list of our ranks. And, truly, Asbury C? liicNeer merited a place among that noble band, who have wrought faithfully in cultivating Immanuel’s land, and upon whose labors we have entered. For thirty-six years he wrought faithfully in sixteen different fields of labor, not one of which was the most remunerative among us. He served in some of the most difficult places in our territory. He may possibly have complained because of the meagerness of the support he received in some of these fields, but if so the writer of these lines failed to hear his expres- sions of complaint. Uncomplainingly he went to his work in the Master’s name, and possessing a good degree of the Mas- ter’s spirit. His reward is on high. In manner Brother McNeer was reticent and unassuming. As a preacher he was plain, practical, and scriptural, a faithful ex- pounder of the word of God. He loved to preach, and after his retirement from the active work was always ready to ren- der cheerfully such services as his im- paired health would permit. His last sermon was preached in Trinity Church, near his home, a short time before his death. His last illness was not protracted. He died of pneumonia after a brief illness of one week. Living, he “lived unto the Lord,” and dying, he “died unto the Lord,” and now has joined “the great multitude which no man can number, be- fore the Throne .” — John A. Anderson. Ques. 22.

Lafayette Bramble was born May 22, 1830, in Raven Wood, W\\ Va., and died at Milan, Mo., June 16, 1912, full of years, rich in Christian experience, and in com- plete resignation to the will of God. He was married three times, but outlived all of his companions. Of the first union ten children were born, seven of whom are still living. He was a devoted husband, a loving father, never losing sight of his children, corresponding with each as long as he lived, and from the home of one of his children, in Milan, Mo., went to his eternal home. In 1852 he was admitted into the ministry of the Meth- odist Episcopal Church, and served pas- torates for several years in Ohio. About 1880 he moved into that portion of West Virginia, where there is no Methodist Episcopal Church, and he transferred his membership to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, where he served his day and generation acceptably in West Vir- ginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Montana, till the Master said, “It is enough; come up higher.” He came to this Conference in 1890, and served East Helena, Boul- der, Townsend, and Bozeman, and even as late as 1909 and 1910 supplied Ham- ilton. He was granted a superannuate relation in 1902. He wms loyal to the Church and to God throughout his long life, and always won the respect and con- fidence of the people wherever he lived. He was noticeably adapted to conditions, and in a quiet way achieved a measure of success in all of his appointments. He was sane and stainless for more than fourscore years, and he grew old as the stalk of wheat grows and ripens for the harvest. His interest in the Church and the moral and spiritual welfare of man- kind was constant and paramount. His relation to his brethren was brotherly, humane, and sincere. In the charges in this Conference which he served, the mention of his name calls forth expres- sions of appreciation and praise. He was ready to answer the summons to the land of eternal day, and without fear, Sunday, June 16, 1912, quietly and peace- fully passed into the realm of endless Sabbath. In the presence of many friends and the bereft loved ones he was laid to rest, from our church, in Oak- wood cemetery, Milan, Mo. Peace to his ashes, and blessings upon his name and memory. — D. D.

Lauck, was born in Win- chester, Frederick County, Virginia, De- cember 10, 1833. He removed to Parkers- burg in November, 1851, but returned to Winchester in the course of some fifteen months, still claiming the latter place as his home. In March, 1854, he gave up his residence in Frederick County and again removed to Parkersburg, Wood County, Va., which place he adopted as his future home, and where he dates his conversion, December 10, 1855. Shortly after his con- version he commenced the study of the- ology, preparatory to entering the minis- try. His studies were pursued privately, not wishing his friends, even, to know that such was his intention, fearing the responsibilities that might be urged upon him. It was not a great while, however, until by some means, Rev. Samuel Kelly, who was at that time stationed at Par- kersburg, became acquainted with the fact, and very kindly offered his services, and also. the use of his library — both of which offers were gratefully accepted; and he soon became a regular pupil of Brother Kelly’s, to whom he acknowl- Wcstifru Vin/nna (funfercncc, 1912. tMiKod lilnmolf Rroally IiuIo1>(«m1.

He began the practice of law in Cat- lettsburg, Ky„ and soon became known as a lawyer of recognized ability. He formed a partnership with .Judge W. C. Ireland, which continued for many years. He was happily married to Miss Lutie V. Ireland, a noble woman in every respect, and whom he was wont to call his “guardian angel.” Of this happy union three chil- dren were born, of whom two still live, William Ireland and Mrs. Pamelia Miller. He was converted under the preaching of the mountain evangelist. Rev. George 0. name, in 1884. Soon after this notable event he felt that he was called of God to preach the gospel. He immediately re- sponded heartily to this call, and soon en- tered the ministry of the Methodist Epis- copal Church, South. His first charge was Charleston, W. Va., where he was em- inently successful. He was afterwards stationed at Huntington, and then Ash- land, Ky., and later was made presiding elder of the Ashland District, holding this last position for four years. In the mean- time he spent some years in Texas, whith- er he went for the sake of his health. Several years ago Brother Hampton lo- cated and settled in Ashland, Ky., where he resumed the practice of law. This ac- tion was taken on account of the long and serious affliction of his wife’s mother, after the death of Judge Ireland. After the passing away of his own wife, in the spring of 1911, he felt that he must again take up his loved employment, the minis- try, and was readmitted into the Western Virginia Conference one year ago and sta- tioned at Buffalo on the Great Kanawha River. It was at this last-named place, in the midst of his work, that he sickened and died, from a severe cold contracted while holding his regular services. His son Ireland, son-in-law Dr. J. L. Miller, and his daughter, Mrs. Pamelia Miller, were at his bedside when the last moment came. All that the best medical skill and loving hands could do was done for him, but all in vain. He passed into the “great beyond” early on Friday morning, January 19, 1912. On Sunday afternoon, January 21, the writer, aided by a num- ber of the brethren, paid the last tribute to his memory in the presence of an im- mense concourse of relations, friends, and old comrades of army days, in our First Church in Ashland. In the twilight hour in the beautiful cemetery just beyond the city, we laid his body to rest by the side of his faithful wife, to await, with her. the call of the Master on the morning of the resurrection. John W. Hampton was a friend to everybody who needed a friend. Warm and generous-hearted, he was always “going about doing good.” His faith was simple and strong. His love was honest, and deep, and abiding.
