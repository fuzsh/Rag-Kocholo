An event co-hosted by the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing and the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity will focus on enhancing the classroom environment and, when necessary, diffusing incivility in the classroom.\n\nCynthia Clark, professor of nursing at Boise State University, will present strategies for dealing with uncivil students and faculty during the half-day interactive program from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 8, in the Multipurpose Room, Building B, at the SIUE East St. Louis Center. Registration will begin at 8 a.m.\n\n\"We will welcome Dr. Clark, nationally noted researcher, who will provide background materials and a wealth of knowledge and lead SIUE faculty in tabletop exercises on the emerging issue of incivility in the classroom,\" said SIUE School of Nursing Dean Marcia Maurer.\n\nClark, an award winning professor, has published several works including \"Student Perspectives on Incivility in Nursing Education: An Application of the Concept of Rankism\" in Nursing Outlook and \"The Dance of Civility and Incivility in Nursing Education,\" a published abstract from the 2008 Western Institute of Nursing Conference, Garden Grove, CA.\n\nThis topic emerged from a recent School of Nursing administrative retreat. In their observations of recent classroom behavior, both faculty and administrators have observed a trend towards new provocative behaviors from some students who might require additional strategies of classroom management.\n\nClark currently is researching the development of policy to address disruptive students in higher education, as well as conducting an international student incivility study on nursing education in Hangzhou China.\n\nShe has presented nationally on topics, including incivility, impaired nurses and adolescent mental health issues. She promotes student learning and contributions locally, regionally, nationally and internationally.\n\nTo register for the event, contact Kris Heather in the School of Nursing, 618-650-2551, or kheathe@siue.edu. Advance registration is strongly recommended, as only 150 seats are available.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/23/08\n\nSIUE International Trade Center To Jointly Conduct S.A.

The four companies will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nDuring 2007, the Illinois SBDC-ITC at SIUE assisted in $41.7 million export sales from the region, the creation of nearly 60 jobs, retention of more than 430 jobs, and the counseling and training of nearly 400 clients. The SBDC-ITC, a not-for-profit export information center, is funded through DCEO and the University to serve exporters in the 45 southernmost counties of the state.\n\nThe SBDC-ITC provides:\n\no Free individualized export counseling and evaluation of a company's export readiness;\n\no Customized international market research;\n\no Identification of foreign buyers, agents, distributors and partners;\n\no Export finance assistance;\n\no Participation in trade missions and trade shows worldwide;\n\no Offers an extensive library of international trade publications and databases.\n\nWhat to expect:\n\no Matchmaking-two days of customized, one-on-one business appointments with\n\nprospective agents, distributors and representatives who have expressed interest\n\nin Illinois company products or services;\n\n-Interpreter service during all appointments\n\n-Local transportation\n\no Export counseling-in-depth briefings by the U.S. ambassadors to the host country\n\n-Export counseling and pre-trip briefing sessions to be provided by the SIUE\n\nSBDC-ITC before making matchmaking appointments;\n\n-Networking event in each country with the local business community\n\no Travel and Logistical Assistance-preferential rates in hotels;\n\n-Logistical and on-site support\n\n-Illinois companies will receive continuous follow-up assistance to ensure\n\nmarketing objectives are met in the targeted markets\n\nFor more information or to register, contact the SBDC-ITC, (618) 650-2452, by\n\ne-mail: International-Trade-Center@siue.edu or via website at www.siue.edu/ITC.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/19/08\n\nLocal Organization Helped By SIUE Student Nurses Association\n\nThe SIUE School of Nursing Student Nurse Association chose to support families who are helped by Epworth Children and Family Services in St. Louis as their holiday project this year.\n\nAshley McFarland, secretary for SNA and the chair of the volunteer committee said that the choice of Epworth came about because members of the committee wanted to do something that would focus directly on children and families in need during the holiday season.\n\nThe student group encouraged the School of Nursing faculty, staff and other students to give to the effort, providing them with a Wish List that Epworth published, which included everything from comforters to toys to toasters.\n\n\"When we delivered the items to the administrative team at Epworth they were so pleased,\" McFarland said. \"I know that they appreciated our efforts. They even called me the next day to thank me again.\"\n\nService is one of the goals of SNA and something that the group has spent more time in during the past couple of years. The project for Epworth Children and Family Services is just one of many service-minded efforts for the year. Other examples include serving meals at the Ronald McDonald house; helping local Girl Scouts earn Health Badges; raising money for and entering teams in Relay for Life and renovating the playground for the Crisis Nursery.\n\nFor more information on Epworth, visit http://www.epworth.org/.\n\nFor more information about this project, contact SNA Advisor Karen Kelly, SIUE School of Nursing associate professor of primary care/health system's nursing at kkelly@siue.edu.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/19/08\n\nSIUE Student Wins Gilman Scholarship To Travel To India\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Nathaniel Tallent will leave the United States for the adventure of a lifetime Dec. 27.\n\nA highly competitive $5,000 Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship will cover about half the cost for a trip to India, where Tallent will spend the spring semester studying and about another month learning more about the place of his birth.\n\nBorn in Calcutta, India, the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville sophomore was adopted at the age of 8 months and raised in Decatur. He has no records that contain any information about his birth parents and he knows very little about his native country.\n\nTallent, who is majoring in early childhood education and plans to graduate in spring 2011, contacted SIUE's Office of International Programs. There he received help and guidance from Julie Beall-Marshall, study abroad coordinator, to locate alternative funding sources and other opportunities to make his study abroad dream come true.\n\nHe will study at the University of Hyderabad in Hyderabad, India, taking courses on the cultural and historical aspects of the country.\n\n\"I've always wanted to study abroad,\" Tallent said. \"Several of my cousins studied abroad and I thought I'd really like to study in India.\n\n\"I wasn't really expecting to get this scholarship. I applied for it and I hoped for it, because it's really helping out.\"\n\nTallent wrote an essay as part of the application process, in which he explained why he wants to make the overseas journey.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to experience life in an emerging economy such as India, where I was born and to get an idea what my life might have been like,\" he said.\n\nFunding from the program-sponsored by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and administered by the Institute of International Education-will cover about half the cost of Tallent's trip. The remainder of the cost for his travels will be paid by loans that he will repay upon graduation.\n\nTallent is the second SIUE student to receive a Gilman Scholarship.

The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing and the Epsilon Eta Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International are looking for original works, including oral presentations, poster and evidence based projects for the Annual Martha Welch Nursing Research Day this spring.\n\nAbstracts for original works that demonstrate the development of nursing partnerships in research, practice and education must be submitted for consideration by Jan. 5, 2009. Oral presentations, poster displays and evidence based practice projects submitted electronically will be considered for inclusion in the day's events.\n\nPartnerships: Weaving the Threads of Collaboration into Today's Nursing Research, Practice and Education will be the topic for the day, which will take place April 10, 2009 in the Morris University Center. Educators, clinicians, administrators and students are encouraged to submit abstracts that demonstrate collaborative efforts on the part of nurses and other health care providers in a variety of settings. Submissions will be reviewed and presenters will be chosen by a review committee.\n\nThe research day is named for Welch, a former SIUE nursing professor who died in 1993. As a clinical psychologist, she was one of the University's first graduate faculty members.\n\n\"Martha Welch was very involved in research,\" said Angie Peters, director of development for the SIUE School of Nursing. \"The day was introduced in her honor out of regard for her and her research efforts, as well as our deep commitment to continue her legacy.\"\n\nFor submission guidelines or more information visit http://www.siue.edu/nursing/organizations/stt/index.shtml.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/12/08\n\nPakistani Representatives Visit SIUE School Of Education\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

The first group of students is completing the inaugural semester of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's Early Childhood On Site teacher education program this fall.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate students through the part time program are completing their time at the Marie Schaefer School in O'Fallon. The program allows SIUE School of Education students to achieve Illinois Teaching Certification Type 04, which involves training from birth through Grade 3, while they still pursue their current job.\n\nPracticum hours are required; however placement and scheduling are flexible to fit working students' needs. Current students are employed by Head Start, as well as through private child care and school districts, which helps them balance work, family and school.\n\nClass locations are based on proximity to students. Students working in early childhood settings might be able to finish some or all of their student teaching requirement in their current place of employment, while being paid.\n\nNew students will be admitted in fall 2009, which classes offered in the evenings and online. Students take two courses per semester.\n\nFor more information, contact Martha Latorre, SIUE associate professor of curriculum and instruction, 618-650-2223, or, mcarlto@siue.edu.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/11/08\n\nChanges\n\nPersonnel\n\nYvonne Mitkos joined the University Dec. 1 as director of Instructional Services.\n\nRetirements\n\nGloria Atkins, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Administration, effective Dec. 1, after more than 19 years of service.\n\nDavid Clelland, a coordinator in the Department of Geography, effective Nov. 30, after more than 29 years of service.\n\nJerry Hoffee, assistant to the director of Research and Development for the East St. Louis Center, effective Aug. 1, after 11 years of service.\n\nKathleen Porter, an accountant in Administrative Accounting, effective Dec. 1, after more than 19 years of service.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/11/08\n\nBOT Meeting Yields Actions Pertaining To SIUE\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Three projects, totaling more than $6.1 million, on the campus at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, are moving forward as a result of action today by members of the SIU Board of Trustees. Two actions were taken today by the full board and a third had been previously passed by the board's executive committee and announced at today's meeting at SIU Carbondale.\n\nThe full board approved roof replacement, totaling $4.8 million, for seven buildings on the SIUE campus-Founders, Alumni, Dunham and Rendleman halls-as well as the Vadalabene Center, the Supporting Services Building, located south of the core campus, and the 200 building in University Park, where the SIUE School of Pharmacy is located. Some 337,000 square feet of roofing material is expected to be replaced during the project which will be funded through an internal loan to be repaid by the Facilities Maintenance Fee.\n\nThe full board also approved installation of four vent condensers, totaling $300,000, at the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center in SIUE's University Park. The project is being funded by a grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. The vents, installed on the center's flash tank and on its four fermentation tanks, will better control vapor phase emissions and significantly reduce process vapor losses.\n\nThe board's Executive Committee announced that it had recently approved a project proposal and a $1.1 million budget to install synthetic turf on Guelker Field at SIUE's Korte Stadium. The committee approved the project and budget because the regular monthly board meeting of Oct. 16 was cancelled. The project, funded through internal operating funds, will remove the field's existing natural grass and replace it with a high quality turf suitable for college-level tournament soccer playing and training. The life of the synthetic turf is estimated at 15 to 20 years.\n\nIn addition, University officials said the new turf would open the door for other uses with minimal field expense and would open the field for year-round play. The field is now used between 80-100 days per year. Officials cited an NCAA study which shows \"no major differences in the incidence, severity, nature or cause of injuries sustained on artificial turf or on grass.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n12/11/08\n\nSIU Board Of Trustees Approves Alternative Tuition Rate\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees today passed a measure that will provide an alternative tuition rate for high-achieving and talented out-of-state students. The passage took place at the board's regular meeting at SIU Carbondale.\n\nUnder the measure, which will take effect fall semester 2009, out-of-state students who are assigned discretionary tuition rates will pay 1.2 times the current in-state rate. Non-resident students now pay 2.5 times the current in-state rate. In 2007, the board approved a policy which allows the president and the chancellors to charge, upon approval by the board, alternative tuition rates for special situations and/or special populations of students. That approval improves recruitment of students who might not otherwise attend SIUE.\n\nToday's expansion of that policy promotes geographical access and a campus climate of academic excellence to the benefit of all SIUE students.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/10/08\n\nState Recognition For SIUE's Kinesiology Student Association\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's Kinesiology Student Association recently excelled at a state competition in St. Charles.\n\nTaking 1st and 2nd places in two Illinois Alliance for Health, P.E., Recreation and Dance Conference competitions against 14 other teams, SIUE's chapter showed \"evidence of the high quality of students, faculty and programs\" through the Department of Kinesiology and Health Education, said E. William Vogler, professor and department chair.\n\nThe SIUE team took 1st place in the organization's annual Jeopardy trivia contest and 2nd in the team building competition. Kinesiology students Scott Mahring, a senior from Creve Coeur, Ryan Czyz, a senior from Ottowa and Sarah Konecek, a junior from Edwardsville, answered questions about anatomy, biomechanics, exercise physiology, sports and cultural trivia.\n\nKinesiology students Alie Stach and Levi Mahon, seniors from Edwardsville, and Eddie Gonzalez, a senior from Berwyn, took part in the team building competition.\n\nBack to top\n\n12/10/08\n\nSpace Still Available For FOTAD Trivia Night Jan. 17 At SIUE\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Members of the biological sciences faculty at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville have received nearly $4,000 in research funding from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) for two research projects.\n\nRichard Essner and Peter Minchin, both associate professors in the SIUE Department of Biological Sciences, have been awarded $2,000 for their project, \"A Multivariate Habitat Model for the State Threatened Cerulean Warbler and Other Neotropical Migrant Songbirds in Southwestern Illinois.\" The object of the study will include establishing 140 permanent vegetation plots on the SIUE campus and the adjacent Bohm Woods State Nature Reserve. Data is expected to be collected on the composition and structure of the forest community, looking at both woody and herbaceous plant species of the area. The study also includes a census of the area to generate baseline data for future efforts aimed at monitoring population trends within the designated area.\n\nIn their research application, Essner and Minchin wrote: \"the forested bluffs of Southwestern Illinois attract large numbers of migrating songbirds .... These once extensive oak-hickory forests are now highly fragmented ....\" They also wrote that the research will be used \"to estimate population size and density for target species and will be combined with vegetation data to generate a predictive habitat model that will be used to inform future conservation and land use decisions in Southwestern Illinois.\"\n\nAssociate Professor Kurt Schulz was awarded $1,860 from the IDNR for his research project, \"Comparison of Shrub Honeysuckle Eradication Techniques for Private Landowners,\" to help control escaped Asian honeysuckle species which are major threats to native woodland animals and plants throughout Illinois. \"To control this species,\" Schulz wrote in his research application, \"we must reduce the number of plants in the landscape contributing seed.\" Schulz's study will compare two safe \"green\" control techniques suitable for private citizens who wish to eliminate invasive honeysuckles from their property. The study also will evaluate how well these techniques perform during various parts of the growing season.\n\nSchulz's project will be conducted on the campus of SIUE, involving undergraduate and graduate students in an active role. According to Schulz, teaching through research has been a hallmark of the SIUE Department of Biological Sciences for several years. \"This project demonstrates the value added to college education by faculty research,\" Schulz said. \"It also provides direct benefits to the citizens of our region and to the state of Illinois. \"We greatly appreciate IDNR support.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n12/4/08\n\nRegional Botball Season Gets Under Way; Also Big News For SIUE\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) The 2009 regional Botball season gets under way with teams attending a two-day Botball Educator Workshop at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville on Saturday, Feb. 28, and Sunday, March 1. After that the teams have eight weeks to design, build and test their robots before returning to SIUE for a head-to-head regional competition Saturday, April 25, which is free and open to the public. Botball is an educational program created by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics of Norman, Okla., a non-profit organization. These educational robots are created and programmed by students to complete certain tasks without the use of a remote control.\n\nThe 2008 Greater St. Louis Botball Regional-sponsored by KISS and the SIUE School of Engineering-attracted 17 teams from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Missouri. St. Mary's School of Edwardsville placed first in an exciting final round against Edwardsville High School.\n\nBut, SIUE Computer Science Professor Jerry Weinberg said the big news is that it has been announced recently that the SIUE School of Engineering and KISS will be sponsoring the 2010 Global Conference on Educational Robotics, featuring the International Botball Tournament, at SIUE in July of that year. \"The Global Conference is produced by KISS as the culminating event to the Botball Educational Robotics competition season,\" Weinberg said. \"In addition to the International Botball Tournament, the Global Conference is designed to give students an academic and professional experience that will encourage them to discuss technology-related ideas with their peers, promote college and careers in science and technology, and provide opportunities to interact with role models.\"\n\nStudents attend sessions presented by international professionals in robotics and technology related fields from academia, government and industry, he explained. \"These breakout sessions are an opportunity for students, teachers, mentors, and other participants to exchange ideas in a professional conference environment,\" Weinberg said. \"Discussions encourage original thinking on topics that range from technological innovations to ethics and robotics.\"\n\nSIUE and KISS are the annual hosts to the Greater St. Louis Botball Regional robotics competition where hundreds of high school and middle school students from around the region test their engineering and computer programming skills in a head-to-head robotics competition.

During an economic downturn, people only need to look across the world to put things into perspective.\n\nLimited access to water in South Africa's rural areas has moved faculty and students through the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Nursing to act, with the Epsilon Eta Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International to raise money for infrastructure in a village to pipe in water.\n\nInspired by Gladys Mabunda, an SIUE associate professor of family health/community health nursing who is from South Africa, the organization has been raising money for the cause since 2005.\n\nMabunda recalls living in a village that did not have running water. As a child, she would wake in the morning, walk a mile to a nearby river and lower a container into a well to get water for her family for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Then, loaded with the water she would trek the mile back to her home. She said the quality and cleanliness of the water always raised public health concerns and still does today in rural areas.\n\nBefore starting high school her family moved from the village to a township, where she then had running water. Neither she nor any of her nine siblings live in a village today, but Mabunda said she never will forget what her early years were like.\n\n\"There is so much need around the world,\" she said. \"The issue is who do you help? I encourage people to get engaged. There are many people living in conditions such as this. I'm really proud to be part of this project, and part of the School of Nursing, which is doing something to help in the area I'm from.\"\n\nOrganizers hope to generate enough for the installation of a pipeline that will allow running water to be delivered and accessed at the Belfast Clinic near Hazyview in the province of Mpumalanga in the northeastern region of South Africa.\n\n\"Some days, I wish we could pick up all of our extra resources and drop them where they're needed,\" said Rhonda Comrie, assistant professor of primary care/health systems nursing at SIUE and the Epsilon Eta Chapter's president. \"We have so many resources. They have so few.\n\n\"At first we wanted to bore a hole for a well. We thought that shouldn't be too expensive. But then we found out it was. It would have to be a very, very deep well, because there is no water in that area.\"\n\nInstead, it would be more economical to pay for the pipeline, she said, adding the chapter is working through fundraisers and activities to raise $6,500, which she hopes it will have sometime next year.\n\nThe latest fundraiser, held earlier this month, was a wine tasting, which raised $400, bringing the grand total to nearly $2,400.\n\n\"The longer it takes, the longer it will take to get clean water to the village,\" she said. \"Right now they have to line up and wait for hours and carry their water from whatever source they have.\"\n\nWhile some villages are lucky enough to have pumps, she said, in some places in Mpumalanga, water sources are miles away, requiring people to walk or make transportation arrangements to get their water-a commodity that is in short supply.\n\n\"If you have clean water, you can have better health,\" Comrie said. \"Our first goal is to help them gain access to clean water for drinking.\"\n\nDonations can be made for the cause through the Chapter at SIUE School of Nursing, Rhonda Comrie, Campus Box 1066, Edwardsville. For more information, contact Comrie at (618) 650-3935 or rcomrie@siue.edu.

Five SIUE civil engineering students joined some 45 other students—representing architecture, urban design, art, and traffic engineering disciplines from Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Illinois, Drury University, Saint Louis University and Missouri University of Science & Technology—in a design charrette earlier this month to propose re-design options for the Thomas Jefferson National Expansion Memorial and the surrounding downtown St. Louis riverfront area..\n\nA charrette (a collaborative session of designers working toward a solution to a proposed project) took place at the downtown St. Louis Mansion House complex overlooking the Memorial grounds. Teams of students offered strategies and design scenarios for proposed change to the grounds, which include the St. Louis Gateway Arch. During the charrette, students were exposed to a collaborative work environment, addressing a complex set of urban issues simultaneously. Students learned about negotiation and integration of multiple forces that often affect the decision-making process, and how to become productive generators of design.\n\nThe final designs were unveiled in a Nov. 9 presentation; posters of the designs are being exhibited at the Landmarks Association of St. Louis, 911 Washington Ave., in downtown St. Louis. In January the designs will become part of an exhibit in Wash. U’s Steinberg Gallery alongside a curated show highlighting Eero Saarinen and his original proposal for the Gateway Arch. Architect Fred Powers, of Powers Bowersox Associates of St. Louis, coordinated the project. The National Park Service has agreed to alterations in its general management plan. The Park Service also announced a national design competition to generate ideas to revitalize the St. Louis riverfront memorial.\n\nClick here for a photo from the charrette\n\nBack to top\n\n11/18/08\n\nArts & Issues Continues Its Season With The Boys Of The Lough\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Bringing their traditional sounds home to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville for the holidays, the Boys of the Lough return to SIUE at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 10, with A Celtic Christmas—continuing the nearly 25 year old tradition of the University’s Arts & Issues series. The Boys’ show is a celebration in music and song of the vital Celtic traditions of midwinter from the Atlantic lands of Northern Europe and North America.\n\nThey’ll be performing in Meridian Ballroom. The official media sponsor for the A&I series is the Edwardsville Intelligencer, while the series official hotel sponsor is Hampton Inn and Suites. Grant Andree, coordinator of the series, has gathered an impressive season of great performers and interesting speakers for 2008-09. “The warmth and spirit of the holidays comes through when the Boys of the Lough perform their traditional melodies and exciting instrumentation,” Andree said.\n\n“The Boys appeared on our Arts & Issues stage in 2002, transporting audience members back to a time when the only protection against the cold, wind and snow was music and storytelling,” Andree said. “The Boys infuse that kind of coziness in their program. We’re elated to have them back.”\n\nThe first of the full-time professional Celtic ensembles to appear on the international scene, the Boys of the Lough now occupy a unique position of respect in the world of traditional music. They have completed more than 70 tours of North America and have celebrated more than 40 years together as a band. This Christmas concert is part of an 11-city tour that begins with a Nov. 29 appearance in Cincinnati on public radio’s A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. With lively jigs, reels, waltzes and tunes primarily played on fiddle, chromatic accordion, flute, tin whistle, guitar, concertina and mandolin, the Boys of the Lough sing their ballads and folk songs in sean nós (old style) without accompaniment and occasionally in Irish Gaelic.\n\nThis holiday tour also sees the launch of the Boys’ new album, Midwinter Live, with live performances from the holiday tour. Selected album tracks may be heard at www.boysofthelough.com. The CD will be available at the Dec. 10 SIUE concert. Two previous albums by the group have garnered Grammy Awards.\n\nRemaining events in the Arts & Issues series (all appearing in SIUE’s Meridian Ballroom) include: Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin who will speak about “Leadership Lessons from Abraham Lincoln,” at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 5; a National Geographic Society presentation, along with NPR’s Neal Conan as narrator, “First Person: Stories from the Edge of the World,” 7:30 p.m. Friday, Feb. 20; Nashville singer-songwriter Peter Mayer and Company, “Beyond Abbey Road,” 7:30 p.m. Friday, March 20; and drummer, bandleader and composer T.S.

Paterson, director of the Career Development Center (CDC) at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, has been named the 2008 E. Sam Sovilla Educator of the Year by the Midwest Cooperative Education and Internship Association [MCEIA]. Paterson accepted the honor earlier this year at the annual MCEIA Conference at the Atheneum Hotel and Suites in Detroit. The award is given to a professional who:\n\nDemonstrates commitment to the professional growth of students;\n\nWorks to ensure effective co-op and internship partnerships;\n\nContributes professional expertise through activities such as conference presentations, MCEIA committee involvement; and performs other noteworthy achievements.\n\nThe MCEIA Awards and Recognition Committee, the Board of Governors, and the organization as a whole congratulated Paterson on a commendable accomplishment. In a career that spans 27 years in higher education, they said, Paterson has excelled in all of the criteria. For 22 of those years, she has been in co-operative education or career services at SIUE.\n\nSIUE Assistant Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Scott Belobrajdic, says he’s not seen a finer planner. “Whether she is guiding the day to day activities of the CDC or shaping one of the six commencement ceremonies she oversees each year at SIUE,” Belobrajdic said, “Jean brings together individuals from all facets of the university to plan and conduct first class operations. Those planning skills are no doubt driven by an incredible pride in her profession, in her institution and the quality of service she and her colleagues deliver to each and every student.”\n\nPaterson is known as a visionary and committed professional, Belobrajdic pointed out. “Her passion and dedication are inspirational to many of those around her. Her attention to detail keeps all of us on our toes and keeps the important work of the SIUE Career Development Center in front of all.”\n\nThe MCEIA is a non-profit organization of employers, educators, and interested individuals and/or groups from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin which seeks to promote an understanding of the significance and value of cooperative education, internships, and other experiential learning; strengthen the functioning of those elements; and, provide a source of information to all interested persons.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/17/08\n\nSIUE Political Science Student Named Lincoln Laureate\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) Political Science major Lindsey L. Lester-Brutscher was named Southern Illinois University Edwardsville’s 2008 Student Laureate of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois.\n\nLester-Brutscher recently was honored with 43 other students at the annual Lincoln Academy medallion ceremony in Springfield. Each year, a student from each of Illinois' four-year public universities is chosen to represent his or her institution. The students receive a Student Laureate Medallion, a $150 honorarium and a certificate of achievement.\n\nAn O’Fallon resident, Lester-Brutscher—who already has a bachelor’s and a master’s in Russian Area Studies—decided to pursue a bachelor's in Political Science after retiring from the Navy as a commander after 21 years of service.\n\nUpon her retirement in 2003, she taught General Equivalency Diploma and U.S. citizenship test preparation classes at a community college, as well as Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps courses at an area high school. Her teaching experiences inspired her to return to the classroom to earn a degree that would allow her to teach social sciences to at-risk youth. She is pursuing the coursework and certification needed to teach middle school and secondary education classes in the state of Illinois.\n\nLester-Brutscher, who was awarded the 2007-2008 Non-Traditional Student Award by SIUE’s Student Government, will graduate in spring 2009. She currently is maintaining a 4.0 grade point average.\n\nChancellor of The Lincoln Academy John B. Simon said, “These students have exhibited a personal commitment to excel as seen by their remarkable academic accomplishments. But just as important, these students serve as role models to other Illinois students, as well as to their own family and friends. With hard-working, dedicated individuals such as these, Illinois and the rest of the nation can look forward to a bright and prosperous future.”\n\nThe Lincoln Academy of Illinois is a not-for-profit and nonpartisan organization that was founded in 1964 to honor the state’s most distinguished citizens. The group is directed by a board of regents with members appointed by the governor.\n\nClick here for a photo of Lester-Brutscher, flanked by Chancellor of The Lincoln Academy John B.

Just when she is beginning to think her day will never come, the fir tree is chosen to help a sick little boy celebrate Christmas. Year after year the fir tree returns to the boy, and the friends learn that with time, hope and faith, miracles really do happen.\n\nFOTAD is a support group for the SIUE Department of Theater and Dance and uses the proceeds from SfC to help fund merit awards for talented SIUE theater and dance students.

In addition, FOTAD awards another $5,000 each year for freshman scholarships, travel stipends and other support for the department. In addition, FOTAD also sponsors a Trivia Night in January (set for Jan. 17).

The Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Department of Theater and Dance is extending its regular Mainstage season across campus to the James F. Metcalf Theater to present The Lower Depths, a play by Maxim Gorky, the celebrated Soviet playwright from the early part of the 20th Century. The play will be staged at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, Dec. 3-6, and Friday and Saturday, Dec. 12-13, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 7 and 14, all at the Metcalf.\n\nPerhaps Gorky’s best known play, The Lower Depths is considered a hallmark of Russian/Soviet socialist realism. Subtitled “Scenes from Russian Life,” Gorky’s pervading theme of harsh truth vs denial presents that backdrop against a group of memorable characters who wish nothing more than to shut out the bleak reality of their existence. The Lower Depths was considered the first success for the famous Soviet director Konstantin Stanislavski who later influenced members of The Group Theater in America such as Luther and Stella Adler, Clifford Odets and Lee Strasberg, who in turn later influenced many actors and directors who themselves went on to become Hollywood legends.\n\nTickets are $10; senior citizens, $8; SIUE faculty and staff, $6; students, $6; SIUE students with valid Cougar ID, no admission charge.

LOUIS) Civil Engineering is a good career choice to consider and is one that helped build a bridge to success for one native East St. Louisian, according to Sharon Byrd, a civil engineer with the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), who is part of a new mentoring program at the SIUE East St. Louis Center (ESLC). The program, Career Education Exploration, is designed to help increase minority representation in the civil engineering industry.\n\nAbout 50 students from the Upward Bound EC and Upward Bound BEMV will participate in the program twice a month until December. Students will receive instruction on how to build a bridge and construct a model replica, said Barbara Sams, Upward Bound EC program director. Instructing the students are Byrd, a 1986 graduate of the ESLC’s Upward Bound Program and Lincoln Senior High School, and IDOT Civil Engineer Delon Coleman. “This is a chance for the students to get a first-hand look at how the infrastructure of a community is put together,” Ms. Sams said. “It’s also an opportunity for exploring new career paths and scholarship funds that may become available this year.”\n\nByrd said she hopes that Upward Bound students and other minority students will consider pursuing the exciting career opportunities in the field of engineering. IDOT’s mentoring program introduces students to engineering projects that encourage teamwork and problem solving, she said..\n\nIt was in high school when Byrd decided to become an engineer. “I mainly credit this to the Upward Bound Program at the East St. Louis Center and the excellent District 189 math and science teachers that I had from elementary school through high school,” she said. Byrd earned a bachelor of science in engineering technology at Western Illinois University in Macomb and a bachelor of science in civil engineering at SIUE.\n\n“I faced challenges being one of the few minority females in civil engineering, but my commitment and sacrifices paid off,” Byrd said. “I know we have some talented future civil engineers among our youth today, and IDOT is excited about helping to discover them.”\n\nBack to top\n\n11/10/08\n\nInstructor Both Warns And Challenges Students\n\nby Patricia Merritt\n\n(EAST ST. LOUIS) Students are under attack by many negative influences and many of them don’t even know it, says Muhammad Raqib, program director for Educational Talent Search (Cahokia/Madison), part of the East St. Louis Center's TRIO Programs. Muhammad presented the workshop: “The Negative Conditioning of Our Youth” to TRIO students this past summer.\n\nHe examined some of the messages in hip-hop and rap music, television, the movies and internet. He pointed out that many young people know the rappers who spew negative lyrics, which have destructive messages and language. Unfortunately, Raqib pointed out, many youth are not as familiar with historical African Americans who have positively contributed to the betterment of black people. Muhammad also took a critical look at the family structure, school life and peer pressure in the black community. When there are negative circumstances and outcomes involved, they can interfere with the success of students, he added.\n\n“The workshop is not designed to blame young people for the problems of the world,” Mr. Muhammad said. “Nor is it designed to expect them to be able to solve all these problems. But it was developed to help students understand what is going on around them so that they can better manage their lives, deal with problems and find solutions. “The goal,” Muhammad continued, “is to encourage students to embrace positive qualities, values, morals and education and use these things as a foundation.”\n\nBack to top\n\n11/10/08\n\nMore Literacy Methodology To Be Interwoven In Classes\n\nBy Patricia Merritt\n\n(EAST ST. LOUIS) The ability to read, write, comprehend and communicate effectively is the essential purpose of literacy, said Michael O. Afolayan, SIUE professor of Curriculum and Instruction. Literacy involves comprehension, critical thinking and analytical skills and is vital to a student’s success, he added. Therefore, Afolayan believes, literacy methodology should be incorporated in every aspect of teaching.\n\nThe professor, at the request of SIUE East St. Louis Charter School Program Director Anthony Neal, is working with Charter School teachers to incorporate more literacy techniques in their classrooms. He has spoken to Sherry Nelson’s reading class and Edna Woods, social studies class. Afolayan has also enlisted the help of the University’s PRIME (Promoting Recruiting Improvement for Minority Educators) students to help enhance literacy efforts in the classrooms.\n\nSamuel Byndon, an active member of PRIME and an SIUE graduate student in education, expects to help expand students’ understanding by being a mentor. Byndon told students in Nelson’s class that he struggled with grades while in college. However, after serving 18 months as a ground soldier in Baghdad, Byndon had more of an appreciation for life, knowledge and education. When he returned to college, he applied himself more diligently and graduated from Milliken University in Decatur with a bachelor’s in history and political science. “The world is rapidly changing but literacy will remain at the core of foundational instruction,” Afolayan said.\n\n“I am pleased to work with the Charter School students and in partnership with the teachers to help ensure educational success,” he said. The professor also said he is excited about having some of his SIUE colleagues help him with literacy in the Charter School classrooms. Jennifer Bolander and Stephanie McAndrews, both assistant professors of Curriculum and Instruction; will conduct a series of workshops on incorporating literacy into subject areas for the Charter School.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/10/06\n\n37th Annual SIUE Holiday Crafts Fair Set For Dec. 3-4\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Local businessman Ralph Korte defied the odds. A self-made man and a U.S. Army Korean War veteran with an eighth-grade education, he built a successful company from the ground up.\n\nMore than 50 years after launching his company-today recognized among the nation's top 400 construction firms-Korte is being honored with a scholarship fund created in his name at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. His company established the endowed scholarship fund in construction management.\n\n\"The purpose of this gift is to honor his 50 years of service and recognize his retirement from The Korte Co.,\" said Susan Bowman, the controller at The Korte Co. and Korte's daughter. \"He has always been a big proponent of SIUE, in general, and education and construction, and giving back to the community. This is another way of giving back. This scholarship combines all of Ralph's passions and is another way of giving back.\n\n\"The award in his name represents his 50 years of dedication and commitment to the construction industry in Southern Illinois. It is his legacy.\n\n\"He's always said that he feels his degree is what propelled his business to the next level. He attended school two nights a week for nine years to earn his bachelor's. This award will make it a little easier for someone else who otherwise would not have the chance to attend college.\"\n\nToday, the Korte Co., valued at more than $300 million, has locations in Highland, St. Louis and Las Vegas.\n\nThrough the Ralph F. Korte Scholarship Endowment for Construction Management, interest earnings from the balance of the gift will be used to award a scholarship each year. The scholarships will cover the cost of tuition and provide students an opportunity to work toward obtaining a valuable degree and providing a competitive edge in the workforce.\n\nAwards will be administered through the SIUE School of Engineering's Construction Management program and the SIUE Foundation.\n\n\"Ultimately this scholarship is to be awarded first and foremost on the basis of need,\" said Patrick Hundley, SIUE's vice chancellor for University Relations. \"Recipients of this award should exhibit need to the point of not being able to attend college without this award.\"\n\nThe University's Office of Student Financial Aid and the recipient's high school counselor will determine a student's level of need. Along with need, a student must demonstrate a minimum 3.0 high school grade point average, and must maintain a 3.0 or better GPA during tenure at SIUE. The award can be renewed for a maximum of four years, at which time graduation with a degree in construction management is expected.\n\nA strong supporter of the value of higher education, Korte obtained his GED and continued his education as a non-traditional student on nights and weekends through the SIUE School of Business, graduating with a bachelor of science in 1968.\n\nGuided by his passion for learning and helping others, Korte was instrumental in promoting the idea for the Department of Construction Management within the SIUE School of Engineering. He believes business skills, combined with strong construction and design knowledge, are essential to creating leaders in the construction industry.\n\nKorte has given to many community and university causes through the years. At SIUE he has supported athletics through his fundraising efforts for the current track and field and soccer stadium, known as Ralph Korte Stadium, which hosted track and field and soccer events during the 1994 Olympic Festival, as well as his support of the 35-acre tract, The Gardens at SIUE; a Missouri Botanical Garden Signature Garden featuring woodlands, water features, grasslands and sculpture. He also has served as the SIUE Foundation Board president and chairman, and is a longtime member of the board.\n\nBack to top\n\n11/4/08\n\nElection Day: SIUE Nursing Student On Oprah As First-Time Voter\n\n(CHICAGO) The Oprah Winfrey show made a call for first-time voters and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville student Sarah Fuemmeler answered.
