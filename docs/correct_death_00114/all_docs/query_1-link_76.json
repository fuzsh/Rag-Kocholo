Not sure what my favorite Daniel song is... Probably something off the most recent album, which I think is his best, or “Long Lost Love.” I like so many songs by so many other artists... It’s hard. I’d pick the Beach Boys’ “Endless Summer” collection as their best, even though I’m working on a book about “Smile” at the moment. My favorite Stones is “Exile,” or maybe the “Trident Demos” boot, which gets played a lot. For Tom Waits it’s “Mule Variations,” and I think “Blood On The Tracks” is probably Dylan’s best.\n\nwebsite: www.DougSulpy.com\n\nother - I’m the author of “The 910’s Guide To The Beatles’ Outtakes,” “Get Back,” and several other books about The Beatles, as well as “The 910,” a newsletter for collectors which has been around since 1990. Strangely, my introduction to Daniel Johnston’s music had nothing to do with The Beatles at all – a friend of mine ran a record store on the Jersey Shore, and one day when I walked in said: “this is interesting... I think you have to hear this...” and put on “Fun” for me, which had just come out on Atlantic. That’s all it took to get ME hooked :-).\n\nname: Morten Elbech\n\ncountry: Denmark\n\ntown: Copenhagen\n\nfavorite bands: Daniel Johnston, Jane's Addiction, Billie Holiday, Guns N' Roses, Chicks On Speed, Sonic Youth, Nick Cave, Tom Waits, Velvet Underground, The Raveonettes, Will Oldham, Jandek, Primal Scream, Honey Is Cool, Julie Ruin, Kristin Hersh, and Roy Orbison\n\nfavourite Daniel Johnston songs: Peek-a-boo, Going Down, Scuttlebutt, Never before/again, Fish, Chord Organ Blues, True Love Will Find You In The End, Tell Me Now, The Goat Show\n\nwebsite: http://ilove.spencerpenny.com/\n\nother: I've been lucky enough to catch Daniel Johnston live in concert three times; Amsterdam, Holland (2000), Hamburg, Germany (2002), and Malm�, Sweden (2003).

I ordered it because I was listening alot to the Groovie Ghoulies and they covered \"to go home\" and \"Devil town\", both of which were songs I really liked. It was awesome to see him in concert last year here in Salt Lake, I was blown away all over again, he's such an amazingly honest and heartfelt performer. Daniel is a huge influence for me, I spend alot of time with music. I covered \"Museum of Love\" on my first album (owed to a past love) since its one of my most favorite songs.

I saw Daniel at the Meltdown last year and was spellbound. A lot of people don't understand why I think Dan is such a great artist (I include musical art in that), but I know in my heart that I am right.\n\nname: Christopher Petkus\n\ncountry: USA\n\ntown: Austin, TX\n\nfavorite songs: Impossible Love, Kool-Aid, Bloody Rainbow, Daniel’s Live and let Die\n\nother: Daniel cranks!\n\nname: Matt Owen\n\ntown: Billings, Montana\n\nfavorite bands: Yo La Tengo, Hank Williams, Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, MC5, the birds outside my window, Patti Smith, Foo Fighters, the sound of rain on the highway, the White Stripes, the Eels, etcetera etcetera\n\nfavorite songs: Quitter, I Save Cigarette Butts, Ain't No Woman Gonna Make a George Jones Outta Me, Casper the Friendly Ghost, new album!\n\nother: I've been listening to Daniel for about 15 years now I think. The first albums of his I got were the homemade ones distributed by Homestead Records. My old garage band in Wyoming used to do a rocked-out version of 'I Save Cigarette Butts'. We played in a bar once, and I remember a cowboy swinging his girl around to that song!\n\nname: Eric Robinson\n\ncountry: US\n\ntown: Bloomington, IN\n\nfav bands: Daniel Johnston, Bob Mould, Sparklehorse, Grant Lee Phillips, Cat Power, Roky Erickson\n\nfav songs: I Lose, Hey Joe, Funeral Girl, Like a Monkey in a Zoo, Sad Sac & Tarzan, etc.\n\nOther: artist, writer, sometime-musician, full-time scuzzbag.\n\nname: Eric Alan LeClair\n\ncountry: United States of America\n\ntown: Hollis Center, Maine\n\nfavorite music: late-period john coltrane, albert ayler, captain beefheart and his magic band, wesley willis, prince, queen, daniel johnston and my own.\n\nfavorite daniel johnston songs: the entire \"songs of pain\" album, \"harley man\", \"story of an artist\", \"honey i sure miss you\", \"it's over\", \"fish\" etc.\n\nother: as i surf i'm dismayed at how many seem to like daniel solely for his mental illness or some sort of perverse form of credibility. i think he deserves all the good he's gotten { and probably more} just by listening to a few bars of his music. i'll step down now.\n\nname: Jason Young\n\ncountry: U.S.\n\ntown: Dublin, OH\n\nfavorite Musicians: Daniel Johnston, Scott Walker, Tom Waits, Sparklehorse, Nick Cave, Dylan, Andy Gibb(!), Jandek, Love, Brian Wilson, Johnny Dowd, and Edith Piaf.\n\nfavorite Daniel Johnston Songs: Dont Be Scared, Put My Love Out The Door, Wicked Will, My Yoke Is Heavy, Billions/Rock, Catie, Premarital Sex, The Sun Shines Down On Me, Fly Eye, and Cold Hard World...stop me before I list 'em all...\n\nother: \"Me\" is a 30 year old male living close to Columbus, hoping that Daniel's \"pending\" performance in Columbus in April will become a reality. I've spent the majority of my \"free time\" over the past year listening to Daniel's music and being constantly awed by it. I was knocked out when I heard his reference to Red Donnely in \"Cold Hard World\", as I grew up near Daniel's birthplace and watched Red Donnely on the 6 o'clock news each night with my mother, watching things like the \"Hostages In Iran\" ordeal, so \"Cold Hard World\" immediately hit home and I was able to find solace in his other songs as well. I could go on for hours about the impact his music has on me, but I know better than to do that to strangers!\n\nNo website or photo yet, I'm still somewhat new to all things cyber...but I'm glad I found your site. Been listening to the new CD, which is good, and I'm sure will grow on me, like Sparklehorse took awhile to do....but nothing probably can ever compare to his classic \"basement tapes\". His legacy could rest solely on those recordings, but what's he doing now is still far better than the vast majority of what you may find at Sam Goody, etc. My dream is that he will one day be produced by Tom Waits, or by the also severely underrated Scott Walker.\n\nname: Rachel Perry\n\ncountry: USA\n\ntown: NYC\n\nfav. bands: The Strokes, The Smiths, The White Strips, The Donnas, Ben Kweller, Sebadoh, Will Oldham, The Hives, Daniel Johnston, many more!\n\nfav. songs: Danny Don't Rap; True love will find you in the end; Phantom of my own opera; ahh, too many!\n\nname: Jean-Luc Le T�nia (The Best French Singer In The World)\n\nfrom: France, Le Mans\n\nfavorite band and singers: Daniel Johnston is my very preferate!\n\nI love too: Les Wampas , Jean-Louis Costes, Tricky, Eminem, and a lot of the short nice love songs of the sixties\n\nwebsite: I appears on the website www.ignatub.com\n\nfor Daniel Johnston: all your songs are very beautiful and make me cry inside! i hope they will all be edited and that you find true love before the end!\n\nname: Neil Cheyney\n\ncountry: England\n\nfavorite bands: hundreds, but right now: Mogwai, Low, Cocteau Twins, Cindytalk, Dead Can Dance, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, A Silver Mount Zion, Daniel Johnston, Can, Faust, Codeine, Bastro, Gastr Del Sol, Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Kristin Hersh, The Wolfgang Press, Pixies, The Breeders, The Cure, Jim O'Rourke, David Grubbs, The Reindeer Section, Papa M, Stereolab, Flying Saucer Attack, Amp, Windy And Carl, Half Japanese, Tortoise, Ui, Trans Am, Thomas Koner, David Sylvian, Radiohead, Bongwater, Sebadoh\n\nfavorite Daniel Johnston songs: Some Things Last A Long Time, Spirit World Rising, Speeding Motorcycle (with Yo La Tengo)\n\nOther: sadly have only seen Daniel play just the once, at David Bowie's Meltdown shows in Summer 2002\n\nname: Jason Benjamin Irvin\n\ncountry: USA\n\ntown: Jacksonville, FL\n\nfavorite Bands: Butthole Surfers, Devo, Daniel Johnston, The Residents, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, They Might Be Giants, Jandek, Ween, Velvet Underground, the list goes on...\n\nfavorite Songs: Grivances, Wild West Virginia, Sorry Entertainer, Funeral Home, Foxy Girl, Davinare, Fish, Mountain Top, McDonalds On The Brain\n\nname: Jeffrey Brivic\n\ncountry: USA\n\ntown: Los Angeles, CA\n\nfavorite Bands: Daniel Johnston, Danny and the Nightmares, Stereolab, Underworld, Half Japanese, Beatles, Elvis Costello, Velvet Underground, Steely Dan, Faust, Captain Beefheart.\n\nfavorite Songs: I Save Cigarette Butts, My Yoke is Heavy, Some Things Last a Long Time, Worried Shoes, More Dead Than Alive, Pothead, Despair Came Knocking, Urge, Scrambled Eggs and Walking the Cow.\n\nname: Tim L (Timmel)\n\ncountry: USA\n\ntown: Towson, Maryland\n\nfavorite bands: Daniel Johnston, Jad Fair, Half Japanese, Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth, Hovercraft, Radiohead, Wesley Willis, Ryan Adams, Nirvana, Rancid, NoFx, Neil Young\n\nother: I had the chance, and god was it a chance, to actually get to meet Daniel before his show at the Ottobar in Baltimore Md.

I also converted all my Daniel Johnston cassettes that i bought from museumoflove.com to cdr. what fun it is to drive at night and listen to my fav cd, \"Songs Of Pain\".\n\nPic: It's attached.. its me and Daniel after the show when i saw him"
