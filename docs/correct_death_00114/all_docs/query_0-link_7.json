        "text": "\"Mingus, a volcano...\n\nCharles Mingus, it will eventually be known, is a leading composer. Born in Nogales in 1922, Mingus died in Cuernavaca (Mexico), below the volcano, on January 5, 1979. Mingus alone was a volcano. A volcano of anger and joy. A boiling troupe leader and a composer as sophisticated as he is powerful. \"Francis Marmande (Le Monde).\n\nTo immerse ourselves in the fabulous music of the inevitable American double bassist and composer, Jacques Vidal, who recorded three albums around Mingus, will be surrounded by Pierrick PÃ©dron on the saxophone, trombonist Daniel Zimmermann, Xavier Desandre-Navarre (drums and percussion) and singer Isabelle Carpentier who will say/sing texts she has written or extracted from the composer's autobiography."
