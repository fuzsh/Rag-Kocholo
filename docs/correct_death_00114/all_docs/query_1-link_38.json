The materials date from the early 1940s to 1996, with the bulk falling between 1960 and 1988. Of particular interest in the Biographical Materials series is an unfinished autobiography entitled “The Saga of Society Red,” a project which Gordon began in 1983. It is composed of a number of interrelated vignettes which recount various incidents in Gordon’s life and career. It also deals with his relationships with a number of jazz musicians, including Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, and Lester Young; his European tours; and meetings with celebrities.\n\nThe Awards and Honors series contains various awards, citations and honors that Gordon received over his career. It spans 1977 to 1990.\n\nThe Music series contains works composed by Gordon and by others and includes scores, lead sheets, parts, and fragments of pieces. It contains manuscripts, holograph manuscripts, printed items, and photocopies. Many of the items are annotated. There are full scores and parts for Gordon’s works Rainbow People, Montmarte, and Soy Califas. The music by other composers includes works from the film 'Round Midnight. In addtion, there is a collection of music manuscripts handwritten by Gordon that were found in Gordon's briefcase that he always carried with him to rehearsals and on the road. Most of these original manuscripts were written by Gordon, with the exception of two pieces. The music is arranged alphabetically by title.\n\nIncluded in the Correspondence series are letters, greeting cards, postcards, telegrams, notes, and related materials sent to and from Gordon and his wife Maxine. In addition, there are letters of sympathy sent to his family upon his death. Correspondents of interest include Jimmy Carter, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Ronald Reagan, and Bertrand Tavernier. There are also original typescripts and photocopies of correspondence between Gordon and various record companies, agents, managers, and performing venues, including a cache of material between Gordon, his agent Bob Leonard and Blue Note Records executives Francis Wolff and Alfred Lion. This material includes handwritten letters from Dexter Gordon from various locations, including Los Angeles, Paris and Copenhagen. It also contains recording contracts. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically by name of correspondent, except for the Blue Note material which is arranged chronologically.\n\nThe Clippings series contains an extensive collection of clippings dating from 1976 to 1988, with a few materials from the early 1940s. The Serials, Periodicals, and Magazines series contains a number of national and international publications, many of which are jazz-related. These contain articles on Gordon, his music, and related subjects. The Scripts series includes Gordon’s personal copies of scripts for the motion pictures Awakenings, To Sleep with Anger, Paris Jazz, Crime Story and Leonard VI.\n\nThe Business Papers series contains an extensive amount of bills and receipts, mostly dating from 1976 to 1989, as well as a collection of performing and recording contracts. These materials provide a glimpse into Gordon’s performing activities during this period.\n\nThe Iconography series includes photographs, contact sheets, watercolors, sketches, posters, and miscellaneous items that bear Dexter Gordon's image. These date from the early 1940s until the 1990s. The collection of photographs is particularly extensive and features mostly black and white prints of Gordon in formal portraits, candid shots with family and friends, and in performance. A group of color snapshots documents Gordon's marriage to Maxine in the early 1980s. Many photographs and contact sheets feature other jazz musicians, including Charles Mingus, Billy Eckstine, and Woody Shaw. The photographic materials are arranged by photographer when available.\n\nMichael Ferrando, processing technician Robert Saladini, music specialist July 2001\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents\n\nSelected Search Terms\n\nPeople\n\nCarter, Jimmy, 1924- --Correspondence.\n\nGillespie, Dizzy, 1917-1993--Correspondence.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990--Archives.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990--Correspondence.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990--Photographs.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990--Portraits.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990.\n\nGordon, Dexter, 1923-1990.
