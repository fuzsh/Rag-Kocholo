Jazz legend, Charles Mingus was born on a military base in 1922 in Nogales, Arizona. He was raised in California, where his earliest exposure to music came from joining the church choir and other local singing groups.

It's reported, at 17-years-old, he wrote his first concert piece titled, "Half Mast Inhibition." The piece was only recorded 22 years later by an orchestra led by Gunther Scheller.

Mingus had a forte of musical talents that went beyond his renowned leadership as a bass player. He was a composer, bandleader and celebrated pianist.

During his illustrious career, Mingus toured the world with legendary bands such as Louis Armstrong and Lionel Hampton. Fellow musician Ron English reflected on Mingus' career and said:

"He represented what we aspired too â€” that kind of creative freedom. That was the kind of music we wanted to make."

Mingus' life on the road took an abrupt halt after he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 1977. His illness prevented him from being able to write and compose music.
