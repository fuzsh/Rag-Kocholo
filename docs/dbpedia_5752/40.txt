SALT LAKE CITY ( ) - You'd have to be a "dummy" to attempt this prank.

Officers were called to a scene where a dummy was in the middle of the road.

"No I'm not calling someone a 'dummy' it was an actually (sic) dummy," Lone Peak, Utah, police .

The dummy, named Fred by the police department, was placed in the road, so a group of juveniles could watch the reactions of people driving by.

The juveniles found the prank to be quite funny. But the woman who happened upon Fred did not.

Officers took Fred into custody.

He's now being used to prank fellow co-workers at the station, according to the Lone Peak Police Department's Facebook post.

Officers are inviting anyone who would like to claim Fred to stop by the station and have a "chat with us."
