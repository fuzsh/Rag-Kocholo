David Crone has been making people laugh for over 30 years with his unique blend of comedy ventriloquism and magic. After pulling a magic trick out of a cereal box when he was a kid, David became enchanted with illusions and entertainment. He has honed his passion into an unforgettable interactive stage show featuring a fresh combination of ventriloquism, magic, and comedy.

With a degree in electrical engineering and a minor in theater from the University of Pittsburgh, David joined the corporate workforce as a software engineer – even before that was cool. He climbed the ranks into upper management at America Online, complete with corner office and executive assistant. But David’s urge to have fun never escaped him. He made sure that work, for himself and his whole team, included laughter every day.

Eventually, David decided he should share his zest for fun with the rest of the world. Now David takes his act to corporations across the country, performing at special events, holiday parties, and departmental meetings, where he specializes in giving audiences side-splitting entertainment – with a message, or just for fun.
