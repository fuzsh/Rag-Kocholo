        "text": "This guide defines what IRS form W-8BEN is, its purpose, whether the IRS requires it, when and who should submit it, and to which parties it should be sent. How to fill out the tax form using IRS Instructions for Form W-8BEN is also covered.\n\nThe payee needs to file the Form W-8BEN before the first payment to prevent withholding of the full 30% of U.S. income tax.\n\nDo not rely on this W-8BEN guide alone as a source of tax advice. Refer to official IRS instructions on the IRS website and consult your attorney or CPA.\n\nIRS form W-8BEN is titled Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting (Individuals).\n\nThe screenshot below shows IRS Form W-8BEN.\n\nHow Do I Fill Out Form W-8BEN?\n\nWhich Countries Have Tax Treaties With the United States?\n\nMany foreign governments have tax treaties with the U.S. Under these agreements, residents of eligible foreign countries (who are not necessarily citizens of those countries) may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on U.S. sources of income. Some examples of countries that have tax agreements with the U.S. include:\n\nIn order to establish a claim of tax treaty benefits under the Internal Revenue Code, earners of eligible income need to fill out Form W-8BEN.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Form W-8BEN and Form W-8BEN-E?\n\nBusinesses that are foreign entities should file Form W-8BEN-E (Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting – Entities) instead of W-8BEN, which is for individuals only. Foreign businesses are subject to the same tax rate (30%) that foreign individuals are subject to, and like individuals, they too may qualify for a reduced tax rate if their home country has a tax treaty with the U.S.\n\nWhich W8 Form Should I Use?\n\nIn total, there are five W-8 forms:\n\nForm W-8BEN\n\nForm W-8BEN-E\n\nForm W-8ECI\n\nForm W-8EXP\n\nForm W-8IMY\n\nOther W-8 forms, besides W-8BEN and W-8BEN-E, are described below.\n\nForm W-8ECI. This one has a rather long name (Certificate of Foreign Person’s Claim That Income Is Effectively Connected With the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the United States) and is designed for nonresident aliens who conduct a business or trade in the U.S. other than personal services. (If you are a beneficial owner receiving compensation for personal services performed in the United States, file Form 8233 or W-4 instead.)\n\nForm W-8EXP. As the name of this one suggests (Certificate of Foreign Government or Other Foreign Organization for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting), only foreign governments or other groups use this form to claim a reduction in tax withholding.\n\nForm W-8IMY. The last form on our list (Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Flow-Through Entity, or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding and Reporting) is only used by intermediaries, flow-through entities, and certain U.S. branches.\n\nTax Savings Are Available to Those Who Persevere"
