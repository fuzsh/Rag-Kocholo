        "text": "Hello!\n\nCan anyone please help me with the commands for creating a dummy variable?\n\nCurrently, I have time series data between the years 2004-2019 (financial data).\n\nI want to create a dummy variable for the years (2008,2009,2010) = 1, all other years 0. This will represent the financial crisis years. I have 6 independent variables and hoping for the 7th to be my dummy variable.\n\nAnyway,\n\nI'm really stuck on how to do this and don't know what the commands are.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nThis is something you can probably find in any introduction to Stata. There are different ways to do this, but the simplest version is:\n\nCode:\n\ngenerate financial_crisis = 0 replace financial_crisis = 1 if year==2008 | year==2009 | year==2010\n\nI assumed that the variable that indicates the year is called \"year\".\n\nWhen I'm running a fixed effect regression, how does it work with the dummy variable and incorporating this into the analysis? I'm investigating the effects of the financial crisis so do i just run the regression as normal? Do I need to incorporate diffferent commands when using a dummy variable?"
