        "text": "The Weakest Dummy is a NPC that acts as a training dummy. You can attack it however you would like to test and train combos. If you have Private Server+ you can spawn both the Attacking Dummy and Blocking Dummy, which do exactly as their names imply.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy also shows the angles, and what trajectory it is falling at, as well as damage, and how much HP it has left. When the dummy is directly stunned, its health percentage will turn red.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe Weakest Dummy appears to have a suit with a tie and black hair and with \"Sharpnine's Face of Joy\" face, this is due to the death of the creator of Dragon Ball, Akira Toriyama.\n\nAs of April 15, 2024, The Weakest Dummy has a \"Training Arc\" appearance, similar to the Funeral outfit, but more damaged and worn out. The Dummy's expression seems to also have changed to a much more motivated, \"Don't Wake Me Up\" face. The tie, left shoulder and right forearm being noticeably tattered.\n\nAs \"Homeless Dummy\" his hair is changed to gray with ripped, brown clothing.\n\nAs \"Santa Dummy\" he wears ripped Christmas clothing with a beard.\n\nAs \"Goku Dummy\" he looks like Goku.\n\nAs \"UI Dummy (Ultra Instinct Dummy)\" he has his shirt off with the Ultra Instinct aura.\n\nBlocking Dummy\n\nA variant of the Weakest Dummy, constantly blocking. This forces the player to attack from behind, training the player for potential blocking in PvP.\n\nAttacking Dummy\n\nA variant of the Weakest Dummy, constantly throwing M1s. This can train the player for blocking in PVP.\n\nAttacks\n\nTrivia\n\nAttacking and killing the Weakest Dummy makes your Ultimate bar go up but doesn't fill up your ultimate bar as much as attacking players.\n\nIf you're alone, however, it will fill the bar up the same as a normal player.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy has the same amount of health as a player, and there is a common misconception that the dummy has less health than a player, when in reality it only seems that it has less health because it doesn't regenerate. However, as of May 28, 2024, after an unknown update, it will regenerate all health immediately after about 10-20 seconds.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy is based on the protagonist of Dragon Ball, Goku.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy doesn't have a ping, as it is an NPC. So, in a ping-based game, this is a huge downside to training with the dummy as some ping based techs such as all the shove techs become completely impossible on the dummy and other techs such as the Kyoto tech become much more difficult.\n\nTyping /e scriptable5155 makes your camera locked to The Weakest Dummy's torso, seeing his perspective. If it doesn't work, it is most likely deleted now.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy now only does the Super Saiyan emote and nothing else. It's also known as the spawn animation.\n\nA lead developer of The Strongest Battlegrounds showed a clip of the Weakest Dummy dodging a Blitz Shot from a Destructive Cyborg in the official Yielding Arts Discord. This heavily implies a Weakest Dummy boss fight.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy’s attack counter is very rare, it is nearly impossible to do. This is likely due to the dummy's training arc.\n\nThe Weakest Dummy is capable of spawning with a random emote but when it performs the \"Thinker\" Emote it will say one of the following:\n\n\"My purpose is an eternity of suffering.\"\n\n\"Is this the only legacy I'll leave in this cruel world?\"\n\n\"I'm but a hollow shell filled with pain and despair.\"\n\n\"I'm a shadow cast in the darkest corners of this bleak world.\"\n\n\"The darkness of my existence is suffocating...\"\n\n\"I'm merely a shadow of my existence.\"\n\n\"I'm condemned to suffer while the world moves on.\"\n\n\"I'm a prisoner of this wretched existence.\"\n\n\"I'm condemned to this endless torment.\"\n\n\"This agony is my only constant companion.\"\n\n\"I'd trade my immortality for a moment of peace.\"\n\n\"I'm a broken doll in a world that revels in my shattered pieces.\"\n\n\"I'm a forgotten soul in a universe that has turned its back on me.\"\n\n\"My agony is a silent scream that no one can hear.\"\n\n“I’m just a vessel for people to unleash their cruelty.”\n\n\"I am a vessel of suffering fueled with nothing but pain and sorrow.\"\n\nWhen the Weakest Dummy was changed to the \"Funeral Dummy\" the dummy can only perform the following emotes:\n\nUmbrella\n\nWHY?\n\nPretty Please\n\nSalute\n\nKneel\n\nWhen the Weakest Dummy was changed to the \"Training Arc Dummy\", the dummy seems to only perform the following emotes/exercises: (WIP) (I also don't know the names of these emotes so please change them if you know the names.)\n\nJumping Jacks\n\nWeight\n\nStretches (Not Looped)\n\nUpside-Down Push Ups\n\nGravity (Not Looped)\n\nFlex (Not Looped)\n\nShadow Boxing\n\nSit Ups\n\nWarmup\n\nGallery\n\nTBA"
