        "text": "Teething can be distressing for some babies, but there are ways to make it easier for them.\n\nEvery baby is different, and you may have to try a few different things until you find something that works for your baby.\n\nTeething rings\n\nTeething rings give your baby something to chew safely. This may ease their discomfort and distract them from any pain.\n\nSome teething rings can be cooled first in the fridge, which may help to soothe your baby's gums.\n\nThe instructions that come with the ring should tell you how long to chill it for.\n\nNever put a teething ring in the freezer, as it could damage your baby's gums if it gets frozen.\n\nNever tie a teething ring around your baby's neck, as it may be a choking hazard.\n\nIf your baby is chewing\n\nOne of the signs that your baby is teething is that they start to chew on their fingers, toys or other objects they get hold of.\n\nIf your baby is 6 months or older, you can give them healthy things to chew on, such as raw fruit and vegetables. Soft fruit like melon can soothe gums.\n\nYou could also try giving your baby a crust of bread or a breadstick.\n\nAlways watch when your baby is eating in case they choke.\n\nFind out what to do if your baby starts choking\n\nIt's best to avoid rusks because nearly all brands contain some sugar.\n\nAvoid any foods that contain lots of sugar, as this can cause tooth decay, even if your child only has a few teeth.\n\nTeething gels\n\nThere's a lack of evidence that teething gels are effective. It's recommended that parents try non-medical options for teething first, such as a teething ring.\n\nIf you do decide to use a gel, make sure you use a teething gel that's specially designed for young children.\n\nGeneral oral pain relief gels are not suitable for children.\n\nTeething gels contain a mild local anaesthetic and are only available from pharmacies. Speak to a pharmacist for further advice.\n\nThere's no evidence that homeopathic teething gels are effective. If you use a homeopathic gel, make sure it's licensed for use in the UK.\n\nSome unlicensed homeopathic gels advertised on the internet have been linked to serious side effects.\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has a list of licensed homeopathic gels.\n\nParacetamol and ibuprofen for teething\n\nIf your baby is in pain, you may want to give them a sugar-free painkilling medicine.\n\nParacetamol or ibuprofen can be given to relieve teething symptoms in babies and young children aged 3 months or older.\n\nChildren under 16 years old should not have aspirin.\n\nAlways follow the instructions that come with the medicine.\n\nIf you're not sure, speak to your GP or pharmacist."
