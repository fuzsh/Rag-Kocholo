To do this, we should be able to test the movesets of weapons we found.\n\nFor example: I’m a strength build but I found an int/faith scythe, I need either 3 level ups dedicated to this, or a respec. But I don’t know if I’ll like the moveset of the scythe. What to do? New character?..\n\nThere’s multiple ways to skin this cat, some suggestions:\n\nhave all unlocked weapon types as a lvl1 weapon available at the dummy arena so we can test them on dummies\n\nlet us equip weapons without meeting the requirements, but they do zero damage\n\nThanks in advance for the consideration. Looking forward to trying all the movesets you’ve come up with!"
