        "text": "Hey there, @jake2ba.\n\nHappy to help out here. We have a Test Drive version of QuickBooks Online that you can use to test certain features. Keep in mind that the Test Drive won't save any data, it resets automatically. If you'd like a more in-depth test, you can signup for a free trial account here.

We're always available to help you here in the Community. Have a great Thursday!\n\nThank you for posting here in the Community, @Michael0908. I can show you how to test our payroll feature.\n\nYou use the test drive to test or see how our Payroll feature works in QuickBooks Online (QBO).\n\nUsing this sample account, you can explore and experiment with the features and options that you might not feel comfortable trying in your own QuickBooks Online account. Please take note that the app will not save the changes you make.\n\nSee this link for the US test drive: https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive/.\n\nCheck this article for detailed guidance: Test drive QuickBooks Online.

I'm always here to answer them for you. Take care and have a great rest of the day!\n\nI'll make sure you get to practice your expertise using QuickBooks Online (QBO), @teja4.\n\nYou can either utilize our QBO Test Drive or sign up for a free 30-day trial account to practice QuickBooks. With this, you'll get to explore and test the system's features and have a first-hand experience with the product.\n\nIn case you opt to sign up for a 30-day trial QBO account and then decided to proceed with a subscription, visit the Billing & Subscription menu on the Account and Settings page to complete the process.

You can refer to these articles to know more about them:\n\nGet started with QuickBooks Online\n\nLearn about QuickBooks Online with how-to videos\n\nPlease don't hesitate to let me know if you need further assistance while you practice using QuickBooks. You can drop a comment below, and I'll gladly help. Keep safe always, @teja4.\n\nGood morning, @CrystalClearCF.\n\nThanks for chiming in on this thread. Let me share some insight into the Payroll feature within the QuickBooks Online test drive account.\n\nAfter getting into the QBO test drive account, there should be a Payroll tab on the left-hand side of the screen. This would be your Payroll feature.\n\nFeel free to come back if you have any other questions or concerns. We're always here to lend a helping hand. Take care!\n\nThanks for joining this thread, @Darcy Root. Let me clarify things for you.\n\nThe fake QBO account that you created will not be cleared or removed.\n\nIf you enter some transactions into this account, you can re-enter this to the correct one. Before doing so, make sure the fake has not been canceled.\n\nIn QuickBooks, there are multiple ways to enter and track transactions. You can create a sales form, like an invoice or sales receipt to capture the entire business cycle. We recommend this method in most cases since it gives you the most flexibility and features.\n\nAnother way is to add transactions directly to an account register. For detailed steps, please see this article: Manually add transactions to account registers in QuickBooks Online.\n\nAdditionally, I'll be sharing this link that includes different articles you may utilize to manage your QBO account: Account Management.\n\nFill me in if you have other concerns with your QuickBooks Online account. I'm always around to help. Keep safe!\n\nI'll help you access the test drive seamlessly, @DL43.\n\nAllow me to chime in and share more details about accessing our QuickBooks Online test drive.\n\nYes, you can access the test drive even if you don't have a QuickBooks Online account. Using this test drive, you can explore and experiment with the features. Remember that the test drive won't save any data and connect banks; it resets automatically.\n\nAlso, the browser will save caches and cookies whenever you use it. I'd recommend using an incognito window while accessing the test drive to avoid the sign-in prompt, or I don't have a QuickBooks Online account. See the links below for the correct link:\n\nUnited States: https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive\n\nUnited States QuickBooks Online Advanced: https://qbo.intuit.com/redir/testdrive_us_advanced\n\nYou also have the option to create a 30-days trial account. This way, you can connect with your bank and manage your business data. Be sure to toggle the switch Get a 30-day free trial to activate your trial on the pricing page.\n\nIf you wish to continue using your trial account, you have to pay full price before the end date by going to the Gear icon, then Billing and subscription. This way, you can continue using QuickBooks with the data you entered in the trial account.\n\nCheck out our handy tutorials, user guides, and webinars to help you get started in QuickBooks:\n\nGet started with QuickBooks Online\n\nLearn about QuickBooks Online with how-to videos\n\nPlease don't hesitate to let me know if you need further assistance while you practice using QuickBooks. You can drop a comment below, and I'll gladly help. Keep safe always, @DL43.\n\nHello, @DL43.\n\nOn behalf of my colleague, MichelleBh, you're welcome. I'm glad that the steps provided above were able to help you with your concern about accessing your QBO test drive.\n\nThe QuickBooks Community will always be around to lend you a hand any time you need guidance.\n\nI'll be around if you need further assistance with any QBO-related tasks.
