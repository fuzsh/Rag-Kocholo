        "text": "how to file a flight plan (I’ll be using FF, do I basically use it like Autorouter (put departure / arrival / alternate airports and let it work it’s magic).\n\nYES. FF will give yo a list of previously cleared routes with the type and altitude of aircraft. To make your life easy as first timer, I suggest you simply pick the one you like best and file that. FF will generate ack and – if applicable – change messages\n\n- Am I expected the flight the flight plan all along / Can I ask for shortcuts (if I don’t get a “staight line” routing).\n\nYES, mostly ATC will give you the shortcuts automatically. That said, at least out here in the West most routes are pretyy direct anyway\n\n- How do I close the plan (I might arrive at untowered place).\n\nAt a towered airport the tower does that for you. At non-towered you either close it in the air with the last controller you talk to (APP or CTR); on the ground you sometimes can reach FSS (Flight Service) via a RCO (remote communication outlet); this will be marked in the AF/D (now known as chart supplement) publication. On some airports you can also reach the relevant APP/CTR via another form of remote comms, marked with an encircled capital ®.\n\nNote, that you can obtain a departure clearance at a non-towered field by phone on 1-888-766-8267. If you do this, be prepared to get an intermediate clearance that gets you to a point in the system from where DEP/CTR can slot you into the flow. This can mean a clearance to a VOR with a hold. This type of clearance usually also involve a void time, so make sure you’re ready to go before calling.\n\nOne more thing: I don’t know if these things exist in the NY area (I think they do), but in CA we have something called TEC routes. This stands for Tower En-route Control and are standardized routes in extremely busy areas. They are to be found in the back of the AF/D. If that may be a factor for you route, have a look at them and be prepared to get a clearance that reads something like ’Depart via the ODP, direct XYZ VOR, then BURP19, climb and maintain 3000, expect 8000 five minutes after departure. The BURP19 part here being the TEC route. FF knows this and you can simply put BURP19 into the FPL field and it will populate the FPL with the intermediate fixes along said route. If your airplane is so equipped, you then simply send the whole shabang to the panel and voila! you got everything on your 430 or whatever.\n\nHappy flying!\n\nPS, edited to add: suggest you get the paper vresions of teh AF/D and also the TERPS (Terminal Procedures). While FF has all the info, it’s easier to familiarize yourself by having the paper versions"
