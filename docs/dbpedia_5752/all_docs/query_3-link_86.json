        "text": "It turns out that a lot of Ford mechanics don‚Äôt think you should purchase a Ford.\n\nThat‚Äôs what can be deduced from a viral TikTok video created by Roadrunner (@allgasnobreaks99.50.80.5). It pulled in more than 5.5 million views as of Monday morning from a video posted Tuesday.\n\nIn it, the creator interviews multiple mechanics, many wearing Ford uniforms or sweatshirts. He asks the simple question, ‚ÄúWhat car should you never buy?‚Äù\n\nThe first mechanic breaks into nervous laughter before saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Then the first of many in the two-and-a-half-minute video says, ‚ÄúFord.‚Äù\n\nOne mechanic even quips, ‚ÄúI would say Ford, but then that would put us out of business.‚Äù\n\nThe survey did elicit some other responses. One singled out the Dodge Neon, and another opted for the whole GMC fleet. One looked askance at BMWs. Another remarked, regarding the Nissan Sentra, ‚ÄúF*ck the CVT,‚Äù referring to the continuously variable transmission system Nissan uses.\n\nA July Daily Dot story highlighted a car expert‚Äôs five cars he wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äútouch with a ten-foot pole,‚Äù and the Nissan CVT figured heavily into the list.\n\nBut the survey tipped heavily to the Ford brand, with one mechanic offering the ‚ÄúFord Focus from 2013‚Äù as a very specific example of a car he didn‚Äôt rate.\n\n@allgasnobreaks99.50.80.5 What car should you never buy #repost #fyp #fyp„Ç∑„Çöviral #trend #foryourpage #etb #eatthatbread #tiktok #ford #subaru #nissan #dodge ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Roadrunnerüöõ‚òÄÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è\n\nAre they right?\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports survey from February, Ford ended up in the middle of the pack for its customer satisfaction survey. The survey sought to determine, according to its language, ‚ÄúBrands are ranked on the average percentage of owners who said in CR member surveys that they would buy the same vehicle again.‚Äù\n\nFor this most recent survey, Rivian came out on top, supplanting Tesla, with 86 percent of Rivian owners surveyed saying they would buy a Rivian again if given the choice.\n\nOf the 29 brands featured in the survey, Ford was squarely in the middle with 67 percent of respondents saying they‚Äôd do it again, tied with GMC in 15th place. Other brands in the top five included Mini, BMW, Porsche, and Tesla, while Volkswagen and Infiniti brought up the rear.\n\n‚ÄúFord gonna see this and they gonna get fired,‚Äù one predicted.\n\nAnother cracked, ‚ÄúFord..keeping mechanics employed.‚Äù\n\nSomeone else observed, ‚ÄúWorking at ford and telling us not to buy it is CRAZY.‚Äù\n\nThe Daily Dot has reached out to the creator via TikTok comment and to Ford via email."
