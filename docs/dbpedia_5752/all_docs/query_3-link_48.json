YouTube takes the breach seriously and will take down the infringing video. It also penalizes the offender with a strike. And as in baseball, if you get three strikes, youâre outta there! YouTube boots you and your channel if it gets to this point.\n\nTo ensure that it doesnât happen to you, follow this advice:\n\nRemember who owns the copyright\n\nItâs fairly simple: If you created the video, the copyright belongs to you; if you upload content created by someone else, the copyright belongs to that person, and you better get their permission before you upload it it.\n\nAs soon as the work is created, so is the copyright, and since 1992, thereâs no longer a renewal process. Copyright lives with the creator â and even lives on for a period after the death of the creator.\n\nAttribution does not absolve a copyright violation\n\nSome people steal other peopleâs work and claim it as their own, and thatâs blatant infringement. But itâs no less of an offense when you use content and then add a line saying, âCreated by soâandâso,\" or \"No copyright infringement intended,\" or \"All rights belong to their respective owners.\" Itâs still a breach that can earn a strike and a block of the video.\n\nIf you use someone elseâs work in your video without that personâs permission, it doesnât make it less of an offense just because you give the person credit. Youâre still in violation because attributing the creator doesnât absolve you if you donât get permission.\n\nKnow the consequences\n\nTwo things can happen if you commit a copyright violation, and though they sound similar, theyâre completely different:\n\nTakedown notice: If someone spots content theyâve created being used without their permission, they can send YouTube a complaint. If itâs a breach, YouTube takes down the video and issues the offender a copyright strike.\n\nIf you feel compelled to lodge a complaint, just be extra sure that itâs your content and that the breach is accurate, because youâre initiating a legal process.\n\nContent ID match: Content ID is a system YouTube uses to automatically match content that violates copyright against the millions of videos uploaded every month to the site. For Content ID to work properly, copyright owners have to upload soâcalled reference files â original versions of their work that prove they own the rights.\n\nNormally, record labels, movie studios, or TV stations go through this process for all the work they publish, so individual artists donât have to worry about it. Every new video uploaded to YouTube is checked against this huge library of reference files, and if there is a match, YouTube automatically files a copyright claim for the owner of the work.\n\nNo matter how a copyright violation may have been discovered, if you breach another content creatorâs copyright, that creator is in a position to have YouTube take down your content. In the event of a mistake, you can send YouTube a notice saying that an error occurred, but you had better be darn sure about it. If the claim ends up being proven correct, or if you were untruthful in any way, you may find yourself in much bigger trouble, including legal action.\n\nThe profit motive is irrelevant\n\nSome folks will say, âHey, itâs all right if I use someone elseâs content, because Iâm not looking to make any money.â Say that before the judge and the verdict will still be âGuilty of copyright infringement!â\n\nWhether you intend to make money from the video or you simply want to share your masterpiece with the world, it still doesnât mean that you can violate copyright law. You need to get permission from the copyright holder.\n\nGetting permission for using copyrighted material\n\nGetting permission to use someone elseâs copyrighted material is often well within the realm of the possible. A nicely written note explaining how you would use the content usually is enough for a rights holder to grant permission.\n\nJust remember that it can get dicey, because sometimes permission comes with the caveat that you cannot monetize the overall video. That restriction can hurt bigâtime if your intention is to quit your day job, but it may end up being a bittersweet solution if youâre merely looking to add flavor to your video.\n\nFair use is complicated\n\nAlbert Einstein never failed math, unicorns donât exist, and fair use is anything but easy â or fair â to understand. Debunking the first two of these myths is easy. All right, maybe the first is, but when it comes to fair use, thatâs a singleâhorned horse of a different color.\n\nMany misconceptions exist surrounding fair use, among them the notion that you can use anything you want as long as you donât go beyond some arbitrary time constraint. But itâs much more complicated. In some editorial situations, you can use copyrighted material without permission, but you must fully understand those situations to avoid future trouble.\n\nIf you feel the need to exercise fair use, and the use is for nonprofit and educational purpose, here a few acceptable uses to consider:\n\nCriticism: Reviewing a movie or some form of music makes it perfectly acceptable to use copyrighted material without permission, for example short clips on the work you critique.\n\nParody: If youâre poking fun at something, itâs acceptable to use content without first gaining permission.\n\nCommentary: This one depends on how you use the material. If itâs used just enough to illustrate your point, itâs acceptable. For instance, gamers on YouTube often record themselves playing a new video game and offer funny observations. This is, within limits, fair use.\n\nAcademic: If you're creating educational content, it's considered fair to use to reference other works in certain situations.\n\nAnd now for the misconceptions:\n\nYou can use 40 seconds of anything: Itâs completely untrue. You canât use even 4 seconds if it doesnât comply with the circumstances in the preceding list. As a best practice, use the least amount of copyrighted material to get your point across, and always credit the original copyright owner.\n\nThe notion that you can decide fair use for yourself: Fair use is complicated for many situations, so you may not be sure exactly what youâre allowed to do. The thing is, if you stretch the limits of fair use too far, and harm the original copyright owner's ability to profit from their work, you can be sanctioned by YouTube. Thatâs why a copyright attorney should decide any serious question over fair use.\n\nDonât let copyright issues on YouTube lead to a strikeout\n\nThree strikes and youâre out is a common understanding when playing baseball. But in baseball, you get another chance after another eight batters have had their try. YouTube doesnât share this benevolence, so if they give you three strikes â especially for copyright issues â that means a lifetime ban from its partnership program.\n\nThatâs something you donât want on your record; worse yet, once that happens to you, you wonât be able to recover any of your videos. So, you want to avoid getting strikes at all costs.\n\nThere are two types of YouTube strikes:\n\nCommunity guideline strike: This type can result from a variety of causes, ranging from uploading objectionable content to having a misleading thumbnail or caption. You can learn more about these guidelines on YouTube's Community Guidelines page.\n\nCopyright strike: If some part of your video includes content from another creator and that creator did not grant you permission, you can get a copyright strike. You can appeal it or take down the video to avoid a possible strike.\n\nOther things you should know:\n\nMandatory copyright school must be completed: After your first strike, YouTube requires that you take an online course and take a little quiz to be sure youâre up to speed on copyright regulations.\n\nStrikes come down, eventually: As long as you havenât struck out, community guideline strikes and copyright strikes disappear after 90 days from the time theyâre issued. At that point, YouTube restores any channel privileges you lost while you waited out the strike. If you draw three community guideline strikes or three copyright strikes over a 90-day period, your YouTube channel will be terminated.\n\nYour fate usually lies with the copyright holder: That person can decide whether the video you uploaded should be removed, flagged in certain regions, or even monetized. Yes, thatâs right: Even though the video may contain only a small portion of the personâs material, they're entitled to all monetization proceeds. They can even put ads on your video, if you havenât added monetization.\n\nWipe the slate clean\n\nIf you get a copyright strike from YouTube and youâre positive that youâre in the right, go ahead and appeal the strike with a copyright counter-notification.\n\nIf youâre not sure whether you can win, maybe itâs better to wait it out until the strike expires. You see, after you appeal the strike, your personal information goes to the copyright holder and that person can possibly sue you for copyright infringement. If the situation gets to this level, you still can work out an agreement directly with the copyright holder and see whether they will file an appeal with YouTube on your behalf if you both agree that you were within your rights to use the copyrighted material. Itâs worth a shot.\n\nYouTubeâs robots are good at finding copyright infringements\n\nWhether intentional or inadvertent, sometimes the content of other creators gets used in a YouTube video. Sometimes the breach is noticed, and at other times it goes undetected by the original creator. But as YouTube continues to refine its copyright detection system, the system will find infringements more quickly than ever.\n\nPart of those refinements to YouTubeâs copyright detection system include sophisticated algorithms that scan every uploaded video and compare it to similar uploaded content, looking for matches with music, video, or pictures. It seems music gets detected the most. Even if itâs background music, you may get sanctioned. Usually, YouTube blocks the video, and you must submit a dispute form.\n\nCopyright is not forever, but itâs forever enough for YouTube\n\nCopyright lasts for 70 years past the death of the author; after that point, the copyrighted content enters the public domain. When that happens, the content is no longer protected by intellectual property laws, and anyone can use it without permission. Of course, for many people on YouTube, that content isnât available to use without permission until we near the next century.\n\nOf course, if the creator (or the creator's heirs) files a copyright extension, they can hold on to the rights â that way, the video of your dog dressed as a spider can stay in the family for as long as possible."
