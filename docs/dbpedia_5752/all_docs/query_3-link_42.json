        "text": "Using CSV files to import and export products\n\nYou can use a CSV (comma-separated values) file to import products into your Shopify store, and to export products from your store. When you use a CSV file, you can import or export a large number of products and their details at same time. This can be helpful if you want to exchange product information between Shopify and other platforms.\n\nTo learn more about how to use CSV files, refer to open and edit a CSV file.\n\nDownload a sample CSV file\n\nYou can download and view a sample product CSV file to use as a template. If you use the sample file, then be aware of the following details:\n\nThe sample file contains an example product and a couple of variants. Your import file probably contains many more products and variants. If you use the sample file to create your own import file, then make sure that you remove all the example products.\n\nThe sample file includes the Variant Inventory Qty column, which is only used for stores that have a single location. If you use multiple locations and you want to import or export inventory quantities, then use the inventory CSV file.\n\nThe sample file includes the Price / International and Compare At Price / International columns, but both are left blank as there aren't any unique pricing requirements for these products when being sold internationally. Learn more about International CSV columns.\n\nConsiderations for the product CSV file\n\nBefore you use a product CSV file, review the following considerations.\n\nFormatting the product CSV file\n\nFor your product CSV file to function correctly, verify the that it meets the following criteria:\n\nThe first line of your product CSV file must be the column headers as specified in the product CSV description table.\n\nEach column must be separated by a comma.\n\nRequired columns in the product CSV file\n\nThese columns must be present under the following conditions:\n\nWhen you create a product CSV file to import new products, the only required column is Title. If you're adding variants for a product, then the Handle column is also required.\n\nWhen you update products using a CSV file, the only required columns are Handle and Title.\n\nData dependencies\n\nEven though the Title and Handle columns are the only required columns when you update products using a CSV file, the data in some columns depends on the data in other columns.\n\nFor example, if you update a column that is related to variants, such as Variant SKU or Variant Grams, then the data in those columns depends on the data about the corresponding variants. In this case, you must also include the Option1 Name and Option1 Value columns.\n\nBefore you remove or exclude columns from your CSV file, verify whether the data in any other columns depends on the data in the columns that you want to remove or exclude. If your data depends on a column that is missing, then you receive an error when you try to import your product CSV file.\n\nInternational CSV columns\n\nIf you have Markets set up on your store, then your CSV export reflects the unique markets that you created. By default, your CSV has the following columns:\n\nIncluded / [Primary] where [Primary] is replaced by the name of your primary market\n\nIncluded / International\n\nPrice / International\n\nCompare At Price / International\n\nIf you replace your international market with your own market, then in the header name, International changes to the name of the market.\n\nFor example, if you create a market for each individual continent, and one of your market names is South America, then the column headings are adjusted as follows in the CSV export file:\n\nIncluded / International becomes Included / South America\n\nPrice / International becomes Price / South America\n\nCompare At Price / International becomes Compare At Price / South America\n\nMetafields in CSV columns\n\nProduct metafields are supported in product bulk import/export using CSV files. After a product metafield is defined, it's included in your product CSV exports. The column header format is: <name> (product.metafields.<namespace>.<key>). You can also use product.metafields.<namespace>.<key>. For instance, the format for a Fabric metafield is as follows: Fabric (product.metafields.shopify.fabric) or, excluding the name and parenthesis, product.metafields.shopify.fabric. You can find a metafield's namespace and key in Settings > Custom data > Products > Metafield. Learn more about product metafields.\n\nOption values are also supported for product CSV import/export. Use the Option LinkedTo columns to connect an option to a metafield. Then, you can use metaobject values in the respective Option Values column.\n\nDescription of the columns in the product CSV file\n\nThe following table outlines all potential columns in the product CSV.\n\nIn addition to the Title column, some other columns must have a value. Required columns are noted in the table below. For these columns, a default value will be created if they're left blank or otherwise omitted from the CSV file.\n\nColumns in the product CSV file that must have a value and the default values that are created automatically if no value is present.ColumnDefault value created when the column is blank Handle (required)This value is created based on the value in the Title column. For example, if the value in the Title column is Black Sun Glasses, then the value in this column is black-sun-glasses. Vendor (required)The name of the store as you entered it when you created your Shopify account. For example, John's Apparel or johns-apparel. This is the same store name that you use when you log in to Shopify. Published (required)\n\nThe default value is true, which means that this product will be published and available in the online store sales channel. Published can also be set to false, which means that the uploaded product won't be published.\n\nOption1 Name (required)\n\nThe default value is Title if no value is set.\n\nIf a product has an option, then enter its name. For example, Color.\n\nIf a product has only one option, then this value should be Title.\n\nOption1 Value (required)\n\nIf a product has an option, then enter its value. For example, Black.\n\nIf a product has only one option, then this value should be Default Title.\n\nThe default value is Default Title if no value is set.\n\nIf linking to a category metafield with the linkedTo column, then the Option Value can be either a metaobject handle or GID (not display name).\n\nCaution: Changing data in this column deletes existing variant IDs values, and creates new variant IDs. Any change to variant ID values can break third-party dependencies on variant IDs. Learn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nOption1 LinkedTo\n\nIf a product option is connected to a category metafield, then this value should be product.metafields.shopify.{taxonomy_attribute}\n\nVariant Grams (required)\n\nThe default value is 0.0 if no value is set.\n\nThe weight of the product or variant in grams. Don't specify a unit of measurement or use decimals. For example, for a weight of 5.125 kg, enter 5125.\n\nShopify always imports and exports the weight in grams, even if you specify a different unit. You must use accurate weights if you intend to offer carrier-calculated shipping or use a third-party fulfillment service.\n\nVariant Inventory Qty (required)\n\nThe default value is 0 if no value is set.\n\nThe number of items you have in stock of this product or variant. This column is only used for Shopify stores that have a single location.\n\nNote: This column is only available for stores that have only one location. If your store manages inventory at multiple locations, then this column isn't included. If you want to import or export inventory quantities, then use the inventory CSV file.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nVariant Inventory Policy (required)\n\nThe default value is deny if no value is set.\n\nWhen the value is deny, it indicates that the product can't be purchased after its inventory level reaches zero.\n\nHow to handle orders when the inventory level for this product or variant has reached zero. Variants with a deny inventory policy can't be purchased after their inventory level reaches zero. Variants with a continue inventory policy can be purchased after their inventory level reaches zero, allowing for negative inventory levels.\n\nVariant Fulfillment Service (required)\n\nThe default value is manual if no value is set.\n\nThe product or variant fulfillment service used. The following are the valid values for this column:\n\nmanual\n\nshipwire\n\nwebgistix\n\namazon_marketplace_web\n\nIf you use a custom fulfillment service, then you can add the name of the service in this column. For the custom name, use only lowercase letters. Spaces aren't allowed and you must replace them with a dash (-). Periods and other special characters are removed. For example, if \"Joan's Fulfillment\" is your fulfillment service's name, then enter joans-fulfillment in the CSV file.\n\nYou must have a custom fulfillment service set up in your Shopify admin before you can add the name of the service in this column.\n\nVariant Price (required)\n\nThe default value is 0.0 if no value is set.\n\nThe price of the product or variant. Only include the price and don't include any currency symbols. For example, 9.99.\n\nVariant Requires Shipping (required)\n\nThe default value is true if no value is set.\n\nWhen the value is true, it indicates that the product is a physical product.\n\nThe option to require shipping. Valid values are true or false.\n\nVariant Taxable (required)\n\nThe default value is true if no value is set. Applies taxes to this variant.\n\nValid values are true or false.\n\nGift Card (required)\n\nThe default value is false if no value is set.\n\nWhen the value is false, it indicates that the product isn't a gift card.\n\nIndicates whether the product is a gift card. Valid values are true or false. The addition of this column also allows you to edit other gift card details, such as the Body or Tags columns, and then import these changes. A gift card can only be created and activated in the Shopify admin. You can't create a gift card through a product CSV file import.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nVariant Weight Unit (required)The default value is kg if no value is set.\n\nValid values are g, kg, lb, and oz.\n\nIncluded / [Primary] (required)\n\nThis column indicates whether or not the product is included for sale in your primary market. The default value is true.\n\nThis column heading name varies depending on the country or region determined to be your primary market in International. If you change the default primary market, then your column headers display with the new market name. Refer to the considerations section for more information.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nIncluded / International (required)\n\nIf you sell internationally, then this column indicates whether or not the product is included for sale in that market. The default value is true.\n\nThis column heading name varies depending on the International that you have set up on your store. The default market is International. If you change the default market or add any new markets, then your column headers display with those market names. Refer to the considerations section for more information.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nStatus (required)If this column is present, then it needs to have a value. If the column isn't present, then the product status is automatically uploaded as active.\n\nIndicates whether a product is available to your customers. Valid values are:\n\nactive: the product is active and ready to be sold\n\ndraft: the product is a draft and needs to be completed\n\narchived: the product is archived and no longer available to sell\n\nTitle\n\nThe title of your product.

For example, Size.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nOption2 Value\n\nIf a product has a second option, then enter its value. For example, Large.\n\nThe Option Value can be either a Metaobject handle or GID (not display name).\n\nCaution: Changing data in this column deletes existing variant IDs values, and creates new variant IDs. Any change to variant ID values can break third-party dependencies on variant IDs. Learn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nOption2 LinkedTo\n\nIf a product option is connected to a category metafield, then this value should be product.metafields.shopify.{taxonomy_attribute}\n\nOption3 Name\n\nIf a product has a third option, then enter its name.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nOption3 Value\n\nIf a product has a second option, then enter its value.

If you select this option, then when the handle in the import CSV file matches an existing handle in your products list, the values in the CSV file overwrite the values in the matching columns in the existing product list. If the overwrite option isn't selected, then the products that match an existing handle are ignored during CSV import.\n\nIf a non-required column in the import CSV file is blank, then the matching value in the product list is overwritten as blank.\n\nFor example, the Vendor value in your existing product list is John's Apparel, but the Vendor column is blank in the CSV file that you import, then the John's Apparel is overwritten as blank.\n\nIf a non-required column isn't included in the import CSV file, but is included in the existing product list, then the value in the product list remains the same.\n\nFor example, if the Variant Image column is included in the existing product list, but that column isn't included in the import CSV file, then the value in the product list remains the same.\n\nIf a non-required column is included in the import CSV file that relies on other column data not included in the file, then existing data is deleted or removed.\n\nFor example, if the Variant SKU column is included in the import CSV file, but not the Option1 Value and Option1 Name columns, then the product variant option is deleted.\n\nCollection column exception\n\nTo organize your products into collections during the CSV file upload, you can add a new column anywhere in your CSV file with the header name Collection.\n\nWhen you export a CSV file, the Collection column isn't included.\n\nDescription of the Collection column in the product CSV import file.ColumnDescriptionCollection\n\nEnter the name of the collection that you want to add this product to.\n\nIf it's an existing automatic collection, then the product needs to meet the conditions for the collection.\n\nIf the collection doesn't already exist, then a manual collection is created.\n\nYou can add a product to only one collection.\n\nThis value can be blank.\n\nLearn more about how overwriting existing products affects the data in this column.\n\nCreate your product CSV file\n\nFor each product, you need to decide if it's a simple product or one with variants:\n\nSimple product: A simple product doesn't include variants. If you upload a product that doesn't have variants, then enter all the fields for the product in the first row along with the URL for the first image. In the following rows, only enter the handle and the URL for each additional image.\n\nProduct with variants: If you upload a product that has variants, then enter all the fields for the product in the first row along with the URL for the first image. In the following rows, enter the handle. Then skip the Title, Body (HTML), Vendor, and Tags columns. Fill out the rest of the variants' details and each image URL.\n\nAfter you've added all your products and images, save your CSV file in UTF-8 format using LF-style linefeeds. If you're not familiar with encodings, then review your spreadsheet or text editor program's documentation.\n\nTo view an example CSV file, download this sample product CSV file, and then open it in Google Sheets or another spreadsheet program.\n\nPrepare your images\n\nA CSV file can only contain text, therefore, you need to make sure that all product images are on an existing website. Those image URLs are only used during the CSV file importing process. You can delete the URLs after your import is complete.\n\nDepending on the location of your image file, take one of following actions:\n\nIf the files are only on your computer, then you must upload them to your Shopify store or to another image hosting service, and then obtain their URL.\n\nIf you're switching to Shopify from another platform, then you can copy the current image URLs and use them in the CSV file.\n\nIf the product CSV file was produced by exporting your products from Shopify, then you don't need to do anything because your images are already on your website.\n\nWhen you have URLs for each product image, you can start building your CSV file.\n\nAdding multiple product images in a CSV file\n\nYou can add more product images to your CSV file by uploading more images to your Shopify admin. If you're building your Shopify store with a CSV file, then the process is a little different. Review the following considerations:\n\nYou need to be able to edit a CSV file. Shopify recommends using Google Sheets to view a formatted version of your CSV files.\n\nYou can add up to 250 images to a product.\n\nYour product images must be uploaded to a publicly accessible URL. That is, they should be behind an https:// protocol with no password protection. To do this, you can upload images to the Files page of the Shopify admin. The URLs generate automatically. After you click Upload files, you can select up to a couple hundred images to upload in bulk.\n\nAdd multiple product images to your CSV file\n\nInsert new rows. You must use only one row per image.\n\nCopy and paste the handle.\n\nCopy and paste the image URLs.\n\nInsert a new row\n\nOpen your CSV file in your spreadsheet program, such as Google Sheets.\n\nLocate the products that you want to add images to.\n\nIn the next row, click and drag the row numbers to select multiple rows. Select the same number of rows as the number of additional images you add.\n\nWith those rows highlighted, right-click anywhere in the highlighted area, and then select Insert X rows above.\n\nCopy and Paste the Handle value\n\nCopy and paste the Handle value of the required product into column A for your new rows.\n\nCopy and Paste the image URLs\n\nOn the Files page, upload your images to Shopify.\n\nClick the Copy link icon for one image URL at a time.\n\nIn the CSV file in your spreadsheet application, scroll sideways to the last columns of the CSV file.\n\nIn the Image Src column, paste the image URL into each line.\n\nRepeat steps 2 to 4 for all the images for this product\n\nOptional: To improve your SEO, enter values into all the Image Alt Text fields. Learn more about Image alt text.\n\nSave the CSV file and import it to Shopify."
