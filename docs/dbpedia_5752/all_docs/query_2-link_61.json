        "text": "Welcome to the forums, @nswnsw4.\n\nI find it very hard to offer any kind of useful feedback on an image. A website is for interacting with, and trying to guess how well it would work from an image is a bit like trying to guess what those sandwiches would taste like just by looking at them!\n\nI’m not a fan of sites which require a lot of scrolling for very little information, but I do like the green and white colour scheme, which seems to work well. However, the white text on the green background has insufficient contrast to be accessible. See https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/ and https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.\n\nYour “Subscribe to us” form is missing a “submit” button. I also dislike sites which want me to “subscribe” without making it clear what I’m signing up for. Quarterly newsletters? Monthly special offers? Daily updates? I realise this is a dummy site for an imaginary business, but it’s a point to think about.\n\nAs other said hard to tell on an image. As for me I’d say that the “About Us” section doesn’t sell so it shouldn’t appear on the homepage, what your business is selling are sandwiches so show them on the top of everything: on the a real device you wouldn’t see the complete picture you’re showing us.\n\nMy other point is that at the top of your screen should appear your location to make sure your customer is close by your business."
