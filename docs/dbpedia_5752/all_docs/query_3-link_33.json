Visit ShopCPR.Heart.org to learn more.\n\nFor blended learning courses, a student completes part of the course in a self-directed manner online, followed by a hands-on skills session in person with an AHA Instructor or using a Voice Assisted Manikin (VAM) where available. AHA eLearning courses are fully self-directed, and do not require a separate hands-on skills session.\n\nQ: What is the cost for a hands-on skills session for a blended learning course?\n\nA: The cost for hands-on sessions is determined by the AHA Training Center offering the session.

It consists of two easy steps:\n\nCall 9-1-1 (or send someone to do that).\n\nPush hard and fast in the center of the chest at a rate of 100-120 pushes per minute.\n\nThe AHA recommends that healthcare providers use conventional CPR with a combination of breaths and compressions. Conventional CPR should also be used for\n\nAll infants (up to age 1)\n\nChildren (up to puberty)\n\nAnyone found already unconscious and not breathing normally\n\nAny victims of drowning, drug overdose, collapse due to breathing problems, or prolonged cardiac arrest\n\nLearn more about Hands-Only CPR.\n\nQ: I heard that you can cough repeatedly and vigorously to perform CPR on yourself. Is this true?\n\nA: The AHA does not endorse \"cough CPR,\" a coughing procedure widely publicized on the Internet. As noted in the AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC, “cough CPR” is not useful for unresponsive victims and should not be taught to lay rescuers. For more information, see the Cough CPR information page on Heart.org.\n\nQ: Does my AHA course completion card certify me to do CPR?\n\nA: No. The AHA does not certify people in CPR, first aid, or advanced cardiovascular life support skills; the AHA verifies that, at the time a person successfully completed training, he or she was able to perform skills satisfactorily.\n\nBack to Top"
