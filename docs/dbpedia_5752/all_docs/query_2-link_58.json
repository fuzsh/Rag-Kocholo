        "text": "Combat Dummy[]\n\nCombat Dummies have a black torso and legs. These are the most basic of the dummies, with no unique behaviors, having the same 100 HP like normal players. Their \"Uncertified\" form appear in boss_uncertified.\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nBuilt Different Dummy[]\n\nHas a faded red torso and legs, as well as the bulky arms from built different. This dummy would have the status effects granted by built different, meaning it would have 50% defense which would greatly reduce its damage from damage sources.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBuilt Different Dummies were the only dummies to technically have more than 100 HP.\n\nThis was changed in V1.1.0, as Dripped Dummies were added.\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nFranklin Dummy[]\n\nHas a light blue torso and legs, as well as equipping Franklin Badge. They'll have the properties of the Franklin Badge, meaning they reflect electric-based items and death notes. They're useful for testing out how the Franklin Badge works in general.\n\nIf you use a death note on a Franklin Dummy, it will NOT give you the reflection incident badge (if you don't have it yet).\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nPresidential Dummy[]\n\nHas a bright red torso and legs, as well as having white curled hair and a monocle. They're also the only dummy to have a differently colored T-Shirt, being blue instead of yellow. Function wise, they behave the same as the regular Combat Dummies except the monocle they wear is bulletproof.\n\nChanges[]\n\nIt was added in an unknown update.\n\nShopkeeper Dummy[]\n\nHas a red torso, green legs, and having a red hoodie around their neck. They're also the only dummy to have a different face, that being the Tired Face. When hit with any attack, points will spew out, and disappear after a few seconds. The amount of points spewed out depends on how much damage they were dealt, so weaker attacks cause less points to fly out. This is purely cosmetic, though, since you won't get any points from hitting them. They act the same as regular Combat Dummies.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nShopkeeper Dummy runs the Item Asylum shop.\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nCounter Dummy[]\n\nHas a purple torso and legs. When hit with most attacks from most items, they'll disappear, and reappear behind the player who hit them, not taking any damage, making them near impossible to be killed with ordinary items, which includes the Death Note. However, there are still certain items that can damage (and kill) them.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere are certain weapons that can bypass the counter effect of Counter Dummies, such as amogus, Plan & Instant death.\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nDodge Dummy[]\n\nHas a green torso and legs. When attempting to hit them with most attacks, they'll just simply sidestep out of the way, either going left or right, along with a MISS graphic appearing above them.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere are certain weapons that can bypass the dodge effect of Dodge Dummies, like Counter Dummies they can also be hit with amogus & Plan.\n\nChanges[]\n\nThis was added in an unknown update.\n\nDripped Dummy[]\n\nHas the same appearance as the regular Combat Dummy, but with Supreme Drip clothing on, which is the same as a player with ultra instinct. Because of this, the dummy has 50 more HP that usual, but unlike Built Different Dummies, they won't take half of the damage taken. Also, hitting them with the small pebble will cause the player to explode.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Dripped Dummy's clothes can be stolen by borrow, making them lose 50 HP.\n\nChanges[]\n\nWas added in v1.1.0.\n\nUnholy Dummy[]\n\nWhile mostly identical to a typical Combat Dummy, the Unholy Dummy has red skin, alongside red demonic horns and a demonic tail. This dummy is primarily used to test certain holy items, which deal extra damage and/or have special effects against characters that are considered unholy. Do note that you can still kill the dummy regardless if the weapon you use against it is holy or not.\n\nChanges[]\n\nWas added in v1.2.0.\n\nAttacking Dummy[]\n\nHas a red torso and legs. This dummy uses the legacy crowbar item. It has an auto click mechanism. It deals 25 damage, and its item can be stolen by using borrow. When stolen, the item will appear as the crowbar item instead of the legacy crowbar.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWhen using Romania on Attacking Dummy, it doesn't work.\n\nWhen using Camera on Attacking Dummy, its crowbar will simply disappear and unable to attack permanently.\n\nChanges[]\n\nWas added in an unknown update.\n\nOneshot Dummy[]\n\nThis dummy looks similar to the Attacking Dummy, although it uses a slightly brighter tone of red and does not wield a crowbar. This dummy has only 0.0010000000474974513 health, meaning it will instantly die to any attack in the game (excluding attacks that do no damage).\n\nChanges[]\n\nWas added in v1.3.0."
