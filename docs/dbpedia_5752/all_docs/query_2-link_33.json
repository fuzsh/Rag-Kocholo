        "text": "I've thought about this a bit more and had the following supplementary thoughts:\n\nI wouldn't use either term particularly often, not being in the habit of naming the thing in shop windows on which clothes are displayed...\n\n(1) I quite recently worked in a shop which used these jobbies and am about 63½% certain we used to call them mannequins, not dummies.\n\n(2) I actually prefer the term mannequin for them, not least because it's very 'exact'. The problem with dummy is that it means so many other things in BE:\n\n(tailor's) dummy\n\n(crash test) dummy ~ similar to a mannequin ... but I wouldn't dream of calling one that\n\n(ventriloquist's) dummy (eek!; see Cuchu above)\n\n(baby's) dummy (AE pacifier)\n\ndummy (bullets)\n\nnot to mention ...\n\nWhereas mannequin only means 'thing you put clothes on in a shop window'\n\nIf it is AE, why have I never heard it?\n\nMy dictionary goes out of its way to signal that this usage belongs to ewie et alia.\n\nI'm only following what the great reference works tell me, Mr.Flete.\n\nEdging a little closer to the Great Off-Topic Wilderness, I think the ewester meant to write \"...dummy (in AE, pacifier)\". Have you really never heard of a pacifier?\n\nAlso, the Oxford-Hachette French Dictionary lists the use of \"dummy\" as a BE term for an artificial nipple, but it does not translate to mannequin.\n\nHow bizarre!! If I were to talk about an artificial nipple, I certainly wouldn't call it a dummy! I think I'd call it a \"fake nipple\" and I'm BE myself!\n\np.s. thanks for this thread, I've always wondered what a pacifier is! Now I just need to find out what a retainer is and I'm all sorted for watching American films!\n\nMannequin just sounds awfully refined to me\n\nI find it looks much less fancy if you spell it \"mannikin.\" (I would never voluntarily use this variant.)\n\n\"Mannequin\" seems like it fits equally well in both casual and formal register for AE, though.\n\nNow I just need to find out what a retainer is and I'm all sorted for watching American films!\n\nThe tooth thingies? They are not much fun.\n\nHow bizarre!! If I were to talk about an artificial nipple, I certainly wouldn't call it a dummy! I think I'd call it a \"fake nipple\" and I'm BE myself!\n\nYes, I think you would - you just would never think of calling it a 'fake nipple'. Think of a baby's dummy - it is essentially an artificial nipple, something that the baby can suck on and be comforted by. The suck reflex/reaction occurs because the thing the baby is supposed to be sucking is a nipple (which means being fed, hence soothing effect). Of course, no milk comes out of the dummy, but the powers of association and all that...\n\nIf it is AE, why have I never heard it?\n\nMy dictionary goes out of its way to signal that this usage belongs to ewie et alia.\n\nFor what it's worth, pacifier is the only word used in Ireland.\n\nI've never heard of a \"baby's dummy\", if anything, I'd expect it to be some sort of a doll that a child plays with.\n\nWhereas mannequin only means 'thing you put clothes on in a shop window'\n\nKnowing that mannequin is used in French to mean \"fashion model,\" I decided to look it up in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary; the Encarta World English Dictionary, North American ed.; and the American Heritage Dictionary.\n\nAll show it to be used with the sense of \"fashion model.\" Two show it without comment, while the Encarta identifies it as \"dated.\"\n\nI would expect the average American, however, to be unaware of this sense of the word to name a human profession. Heck, I wouldn't have known it could be used that way in English if I hadn't looked it up!"
