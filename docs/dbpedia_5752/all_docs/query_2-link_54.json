Fingers crossed they provide one in the upcoming DLC... It's bad enough the game doesn't teach you how to do light attack weaving, how to maintain uptime on DoTs, that sustain impacts your dps, etc etc, but to also not provide us the tools to teach ourselves unless we pay, that feels like pay-to-win to me.\n\nJust wanted to say thank you all for the information! Guess I'm gonna start crafting haha (:\n\nIt is unfortunate though that zos hasn't given all players access to a trial target dummy since that's the standard for parsing... Fingers crossed they provide one in the upcoming DLC... It's bad enough the game doesn't teach you how to do light attack weaving, how to maintain uptime on DoTs, that sustain impacts your dps, etc etc, but to also not provide us the tools to teach ourselves unless we pay, that feels like pay-to-win to me.\n\n^This\n\nAlso, I would like ZOS to add this trial target dummy as part of a solo instanced training room that you could go to at any time for free. This training room would have an NPC that would talk to you while you were practicing your DPS, and the dialogue would be intended to teach you all the things you said above (how to do light attack weaving, etc.).\n\nYou can buy some directly from guild traders with 3mil hp.\n\nAlso there are trial dummies you can buy from guild traders (dwarven ones).\n\nAlternatively you can farm writ voucers and craft them yourself.\n\nThey do not give buffs like trial dummy, iron astronach however which is standard for parsing.\n\nthe crafted trial dummies i dont think come with all the buffs of a true trial dummy like the ones that are paid with crowns, but ive never actually crafted one so im unsure if they updated those to come with the buffs\n\nplays PC/NA\n\nhandle @Necrotech_Master\n\nactive player since april 2014\n\nThere are ones you can obtain in game that have decent HP but do not offer any buffs. They can be crafted with plans that can be bought with writ vouchers. The Centurion models are probably best but one probably has more HP than the other. The Robust Refabricated has more HP than the Dwarf one. Both require parts obtained from doing the weekly in HoF trial.\n\nI suggest avoiding the target skeletons as they have a lot less HP but still work as test dummies.\n\nFurther, unless someone is using the iron atronach, only available for crowns, they would have to make adjustments to compensate for the lack of sustain. Adjusting the rotation when working to practice and refine it is not the best choice. Adding sustain via food/drinks helps.\n\nSo while the fancy one that provides the buffs and debuff is the best choice, free is free and always a good price.\n\nI don't think the dwemer construct dummies provide any buffs. They just have a lot of health and I think the original intent was for them to be used for a group to parse together.\n\nCorrect. They does not have the buffs.\n\nSince the OP is looking for one that is available for free in the game the constructs that I mentioned are the best choices. The smaller of the two would be better for a solo parse. The skeletons and other dummies available for free in-game do not have enough HP for them to be worthwhile.\n\nLight attack weaving was never an intended game mechanic but they've just left it alone because players made it work.\n\nThey're not going to teach you how to do something they didn't originally intend you do.\n\nGame combos were never an intended game mechanic. Street Fighter 2 had combos by accident (a bug) but players made it work, then later added it into future title.\n\nOnly difference and point on which I agree is that there isn't a tutorial, which they should add.\n\n110-114k Stage 4 Vamprie Magblade u39 Aldmeri Dominion did nothing wrong in Shadowfen."
