        "text": "So was The Dummy about the wooden puppet or the man who held it? In the more enlightened time we now live in, it’s pretty clear to me that Jerry has a problem. We can’t call him a dummy because he needs help, but that I couldn’t help but wonder if that was partly insinuated in the title, especially the way Jerry acts later in the episode. The thing is, he has either a mental disorder or he’s an alcoholic. Both need treatment, not mockery. Maybe I’m hypersensitive to that because I work for a mental health company that takes it very seriously. I also had experience with a former family member who was an alcoholic. Between those two things, I can’t help but see this episode through tinted glasses, and they probably aren’t tinted the way Rod Serling would have liked.\n\nJerry is a man with an obsession, but that obsession seems to be exacerbated by alcohol. He’s convinced that Willie, his puppet, is alive. This being The Twilight Zone, one can never be too certain, but as there’s no other evidence, the truth is that we may be watching a tragic drama more than a science fiction drama. The big twist comes at the end when the faces of the man and the puppet have been swapped. The camera mercifully stays on the puppet more than the overly made-up ventriloquist but that makes me wonder if it was just the way the man perceived himself. The fact that he had moved to another state just made it more difficult to determine since the crowd would not have recognized the change.\n\nThe thing that convinces me that Jerry is an alcoholic is that things start up after he has a drink. He doesn’t drink too much but that may be just the amount he needs to trigger his visions. In the life of my former family member, one drink could create an onslaught of problems. It had to be avoided completely or it would rage like an inferno, so Jerry’s single drink might be the catalyst of his downfall. When he goes outside and encounters Noreen, he struggles to even speak to her without stumbling over his words. He grabs her violently, refusing her requests to let go. It’s a hard scene to watch but his breakdown is happening fast.\n\nWhile my opinion of Serling has taken a hit watching this series in order, I do have to credit the cinematography. When Jerry throws the mirror at Willie, the reflection shows a crack right down the middle, splitting the image. Considering what Jerry is going through, this may be an indication of the split in Jerry’s personality, fracturing the two personas. This further makes me believe that the end scene of the reversed roles is Jerry’s view of himself after he has truly lost the ability to distinguish himself from the mannequin. So it’s hard to conceive that we are left with that image. We’re watching a train wreck and we’re expected to come away with what? Horror? Appreciation? I don’t get what the end result of this episode was meant to do or how it was meant to make us feel.\n\nConceptually, a strong episode but in execution, it’s sad. Like so many other episodes of this series, we’re seeing a man breaking down. What we should see is someone offer to help Jerry; not give him ultimatums, but actually get him help. I get it: the 25 minute format only allows for one thing and that tends to focus on the horror of the situation, not the solution. That’s a shame because there’s probably a really compelling story hidden under the horror, but we’ll never see how that plays out. Or maybe I just don’t understand it and I’m just being a big dummy… ML\n\nThe view from across the pond:\n\nBeing an anthology show, there is obviously a huge amount of variation from one episode to another of The Twilight Zone. The Dummy is surprisingly rare, because it is a psychological horror story, and that’s not something the Zone does all that often, despite the whole show probably being best remembered for doing this kind of thing. This week, nobody is interested in making you think, or teaching a moral lesson. It’s just about making you scared, and it works brilliantly.\n\nWe have explored many times in the Junkyard why this sort of thing is so effective. An inanimate object coming to life plays havoc with the uncanny valley response: it’s a human-like face, which isn’t quite human. We are not even given any room for doubt as to the dummy really being alive somehow. As soon as Jerry and Willie have returned to their dressing room after the performance, we witness the horror straight away, with Willie’s head turning around all by itself. It’s an incredibly creepy moment.\n\nThere are many similarly effective moments throughout the episode: that creepy wink, the Dutch camera angle when Jerry is trying to get away from Willie and get to Noreen, the unhinged, mad laugh, the destruction of Goofy (we somehow even feel sorry for the dummy that isn’t alive!). It’s all classic horror stuff, and it’s helped hugely by Cliff Robertson’s performance. Not only does he really sell the fear and despair of Jerry, he also voices Willie to great effect. This episode needed not just a great actor, but a great vocal actor, and Robertson brings Willie to life incredibly effectively with just his voice talents, making him sound insane but also completely in control of the situation.\n\nAnd that’s the really interesting bit here. Willie is never going to lose. If intelligence is any part of the definition of what it means to be alive, then the switcheroo at the end is justified by that metric, if we can remove morality and emotion from the equation for a moment. If sentience means having intelligence, then Willie is fiendishly clever, while Jerry is helpless and has no answer to his problems other than to turn to the bottle. So I suppose if there’s any kind of food for thought here, it’s about how humanity means more than sentience or intelligence, but has to have some intrinsic morality. Superficially, Willie has more right to the human body than Jerry: he is cleverer, funnier, more driven, more resourceful… but he also probably happens to be evil. He’s certainly merciless.\n\nThat ending is stunning, isn’t it. In the hands of a different cast and crew it could have been silly, but it just works perfectly, a few seconds of screen time that represent lots of clever choices all coming together to create the perfect horror moment. The dummy is an excellent likeness for Jerry. The actor chosen to play Willie as a human is somehow visually unsettling, helped by the overdone stage makeup, which allows a real human face to still trigger the uncanny valley response (a bit like a clown does). He’s somehow wrong… and his fixed smile seems inhuman. Then there’s the way he looks straight at the camera, almost defying the viewer to challenge him, mocking our feelings for Jerry, before looking past the camera and dismissing us as an irrelevance. He has got what he wanted, and it was never in doubt.\n\nWe don’t know much about Jerry, and we don’t know how Willie is working his magic. A longer running time might have allowed for more of Jerry’s backstory, and some explanation for Willie: is he possessed, cursed, magical, or just evil? We don’t know, and that’s probably for the best. This is just 25 minutes of pure fear, one of the reasons why those opening few notes to the TZ theme send shivers down the spine. After 60 years, The Dummy has lost none of it’s power to frighten us. That’s because it was the only thing it was trying to do. RP"
