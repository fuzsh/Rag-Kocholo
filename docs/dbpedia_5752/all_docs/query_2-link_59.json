        "text": "I would like to create an indicator/dummy variable to say whether or not the date (in this case, date of surgery) was on a US federal holiday. I have a date column and thousands of observations spanning multiple years of surgeries.\n\nI could do multiple do loops for each year and use the holiday() function within that year for each holiday (if date of surgery is equal to '4th of July' or \"thanksgiving' then holiday_dummy=1, for example) , but I'm wondering if there's a more efficient way to accomplish this?\n\nPerhaps the Holidaycount function. It returns the number of holidays defined for a given date. Restricted to a single locale\n\ndata example; do date= '01Jan2023'd to '31DEC2023'd; dummy = (holidaycount(date,'English_UnitedStates') > 0); output; end; format date date9.; run;\n\nMay need to fine tune a bit for your specific use as this does indicate \"defined' and \"observed\" for the holidays like Christmas, Veteran's Day and the 4th that move day of the week. Veteran's day may have two occurrences on the same day because there are two Federal rules for the holiday depending on whether you are US Postal office or other as the USPS usually works on Saturday and other agencies don't."
