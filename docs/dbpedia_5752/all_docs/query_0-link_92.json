        "text": "Hi Rick,\n\nApologies for the late reply, we've been dealing with some serious flooding over here in Auckland NZ.\n\nI think you're right, the amps is likely very relevant to this situation. The second dummy battery has an output of \"2~3A\". I have done some testing with the LP-E6N and LP-E6NH batteries, and found some surprising results.\n\nFirstly, some output calculations from these batteries (please correct me if I am wrong, I'm no electronics expert) - Both Canon branded batteries.\n\nLP-E6N: 7.2V, 14Wh = 2.0A\n\nLP-E6NH: 7.2V, 16Wh = 2.2A\n\nSo the LP-E6NH doesn't even reach 3.0A, and works perfectly fine.\n\nAnd whats really interesting is the LP-E6N causes the exact some issue (camera locks up when turned off from Video mode).\n\nSo if you have an LP-E6N lying around Rick, I would be very interested to see if your R5c exhibits the same behaviour.\n\nGreetings,\n\nLP-E6N... I do. Have at least 3 for my 6D2. I know they work in the R5. I thought they \"could\" work in the R5 C as well. I don't remember for sure, and have never tried. I think there is a charging limitation - cannot be charged (in the camera or grip?). I just don't remember which. At work, will try this evening.\n\n~Rick\n\nBay Area - CA\n\n~R5 C (1.0.7.1) ~RF Trinity, ~RF 100 Macro, ~RF 100~400, ~RF 100~500, +RF 1.4x TC, +Canon Control Ring, BG-R10, 430EX III-RT ~DxO PhotoLab Elite ~DaVinci Resolve ~Windows11 Pro ~ImageClass MF644Cdw/MF656Cdw ~Pixel 8\n\n~CarePaks Are Worth It"
