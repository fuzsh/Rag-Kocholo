Ryan said, \"We want that!\"\n\n\"We want them to be on this panel together. This is a good team, a great team, to go out and look for the next American Idol.\"\n\nSeacrest said, \"[There's] nothing wrong with disagreeing ... That's gonna happen, and it's okay.\"\n\nHe added, \"These are all very different individuals with different perspectives and different opinions that provide for interesting conversation and dialogue and feedback for the contestants.\""
