I'm not one to write such posts and I know this is not an airport so I won't announce my departure , I will just blatantly quit.\n\nWhenever I come back to a new expansion I see that the PvP balance is more and more in shambles , when you play against a fresh new player who barely has 2 months into this game and spams Balanced Condi Reaper which is one of the easiest classes ( keyboard faceroller ) and you struggle to main an ELE or anything else that can't compete with the condi pressure you just know this game belongs in the garbage bin.\n\nWhere is the skill in this game ? SWTOR and WoW is aeons in front of gw2 pvp balance , even dota or league owns gw2 in terms of balance , counterplay does exist and outplaying your opponent and managing your cooldowns is a thing in real games. Not here though. No sir.\n\nThere is no skill cap/gap anymore in this game you just jump into the most broken build from gw2 meta battle , you keybind and spam abilities and you win and you start thinking \" man i'm such a pro \" when in fact you are being on autopilot on set class.\n\nWvW is just as bad if not worse but this is on the topic of sPvP and this is not a vent i'm just stating facts on the current gameplay/meta which is a truly bad joke.\n\nTL:DR\n\nPvP in this game should be scrapped completely from the face of the digital earth.\n\nJust as I said in another post.\n\nThis game focused, and still focuses, way too much on balancing around 15 players or so.\n\nStill dreaming with some pseudo-esports garbage. Muh Conquest.\n\nThe reality of PVP is that things such as Condi Reaper and Willbender are just far more ridiculously unfun for 99% of players than whatever circus is going on here on the forums. Players who would otherwise stick around for more than 2 hours if it weren't for such obnoxious interactions, which take little effort to learn and can be mastered relatively quickly.\n\nThis is why you only get people coming in for their event reward or achievement, and then they are done with the mode forever.\n\nBut no, nerf revenant/vindicator and maybe renegade _ thing that the same 10k playtime hours players use, and that's it. \"This last MAT, the winner team had 2 support vindis and a renegade! The same team that at times kittened around with 3 renegades. Literally ruining pvp, please delete already.\"\n\nAnd once those specs get mangled by wrong nerfs/buffs, it is time to complain about the next spec for the same thing.\n\n\"Fun? doesn't matter. We only want equal representation for the 0.1% of the games! Anything below MAT and plat games doesn't matter.\"\n\nPlayers here, and the developers themselves, focusing exclusively on the 0.1% and completely ignoring how unfun the rest of the game is:\n\n- Condis are just flawed and incredibly unfun to interact with. It doesn't matter at all if they're not \"meta\". They are a build check.\n\n- Stealth is so backwards balanced here; for instance, you should be slower while in it, not the opposite and gain superspeed, etc. You also should not be able to port while in it (object permanence, useless). You shouldn't be allowed to pre-cast while in it.\n\n- Ranged anything shouldn't be as good as melee (attacks with a range of 130). That's why anything without permanent resistance, stab, fields of kitten, ranged burst damage, teleports is automatically garbage.\n\n(These are essentially the main culprits for the kittened up risk reward ratio)\n\n- Conquest as the only game mode.\n\nLost cause, to be honest. What a kittening waste.\n\nEdited August 2 by TruthSeeker.3697\n\nthe main problems in SPVP is that there is no focus roles, Developers will always focus on \"mixed roles\" meaning they want players to be \"flexible\".\n\n1.For example if you're a healer, you're not really a \"dedicated\" healer, you're a pseudo healer with large amounts of damage.\n\n2.Conditions is also a problem in today's Pvp, Some say it's easy to deal with condis by having tons of condi cleanses but the problem is that if you use a condi cleanse build you will have to sacrifice damage. Hence as to why condi bunkers are so popular today.\n\n3.Condition builds are generally not fun to play against than power builds, Reason being is the amount of debuff effects, such as blind, chill and cripple that also comes with damage effect conditions, so practically any new player who are quite familiar with mainly physical damage abilities like other MMOs would find it irritating.\n\n4.Movement mechanics. Movement in GW2 is VERY different from the typical MMORPG genre. It's simplistic nature is appealing compared to the mashed up hotkeys on other MMORPG. BUT it is ultimately clunky and full of flaws, Ability cancelling takes too much effort, sometimes abilities do not go where you really want it to go, enemies being able to leave necro marks behind as they run away as well as grenades from engis, making melee more frustrating.\n\n5.Professions having too much similarities with other professions, for example a ranger ability that has a very similar ability as the revenant sword 3 ability.\n\n6.The \"flexible class system mechanic\". The class system of GW2 is very versatile compared to other MMOs where a class is much more dedicated in it's role.\n\nFor example a bard, bards are typically a support role that buffs and heals team mates but as a counter measure to that class is that it does not do much damage. in GW2 a \"support class\" is not only able to give team mates buffs and heals but can also deal a large amount of debuffs and damage to enemies. As an example of druid.\n\nThis is due to developers not wanting players to be \"left out\" in a sense where you are stuck in one role.\n\n7.Newer players have difficulty in adapting. The current SPVP has become much more complicated since PoF due to overcomplicated roles and questionable builds.\n\n8.Teleportation abilities, Honestly i think the teleportation abilities are rather overused in this game, almost all classes/professions have one and i don't know why it was a good idea in the first place. It would be understandable that mesmers and elementalist would have one as it is fitting to their abilities and profession titles, but guardian(paladin), ranger, necromancer, engineers and thief should not have one as giving them these kind of abilities makes it less \"special\" since it all comes down to which professions does it better to me.\n\n9.The progression system, As most of you already know you can use tome of knowledge to level up your character to max level. However this is quite the problem as newer players can simply go to the PVP world to be able to \"test\" the advanced professions. This makes it a problem as you are forced to be teamed up with a player that does not know the basics of his/her own profession. This causes Spvp to have a sort of \"bot\" problem.\n\nI think this is the most careless dev team that I've ever seen out of all games.\n\nSitting there on a stream all smiles with the regular yes men content creators that are all sponsored.(Keep in mind the lapdog content creators are all complete bots in PVP)\n\nMeanwhile sPVP is just a nightmare to play\n\nSame old maps, no matchmaking and the balance is a complete joke.\n\nBasically the mode with the most potential is a complete MESS its so bad I wont play ranked for second season in a row.\n\nShorts left, Noody is not playing and 3-4 of the content creators that I follow are no longer interested in PVP and almost never online.\n\nBasically peak EU time feels like we are 30 palyers in total that play PVP\n\nPS I think the OG crew created a masterpiece especially the Open World and the Combat and knowing that NCSoft kinda hates GW2 I've been quite supportive when I came back after 11 year break I've spent like 200-250$ on the game more than any other game I've ever played(3k hours on dota, 1.5k on CS, 500h on wow classic) just because of the potential of the game I've gifted all expansions to 3 of my friends on steam while on sale for what? for them to que their first game and to play 3 games in a row vs 4 man stacks because there is just no matchmaking 🤡🤡🤡\n\nif you are such a great lead game designer how come you forgot to create such simple things like matchmaking, draft mode or some mechanism to prevent the games turning into the wild west??????\n\nWhat to expect from people that have left SPB to be king for almost a year now\n\nEdited August 7 by Skary.8956"
