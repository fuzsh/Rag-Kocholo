Oh, baby, since we’re talking about Saturday Night Live skits, I regret to inform you that you just wrote one for this week’s episode. I look forward to seeing you and Eric at the “Weekend Update” desk on Saturday.\n\nBut, to be fair to Dummy Junior, he’s probably pretty distracted, waiting for the FBI to bust in his door any day now. (And Momma’s champagne is chilling for that very day. Let’s hope it’s sooooooon.)\n\nHere are some very pretty character posters for American Gods and an interview with Ricky Whittle.

(Although there are other reports that Empire returned today.)\n\nUpdates on the Jussie Smollett Story: The Chicago police have released images of two persons of interest. A neighbor claims to have seen a “redneck” with a rope hanging around before the attack. Smollett and his manager claim that they were on the phone together when the attack occurred, and that the manager heard the “MAGA” comments. However, Smollett has refused to turn over his phone to the police for this to be verified. President Pppptttt was asked about the attack and said, “It was horrible. I’ve seen it, last night. I think that’s horrible. It doesn’t get worse, as far as I’m concerned,” before changing the conversation to drugs and the wall.\n\nRenewals\n\nThe Masked Singer has been renewed for a second season on Fox.\n\nFuller House was renewed for a fifth season on Netflix.\n\nShameless was renewed for season ten on Showtime.\n\nHot Date has been renewed for a second season on Pop.\n\nIn Development\n\nThe Stand has been ordered by CBS All Access.\n\nArmy of the Dead has been bought by Netflix, and Zack Snyder is set to direct.\n\nThe L Word has been greenlit at Showtime.\n\nNew York Undercover has been given a pilot order at ABC.\n\nWoman Up, a female comedy, has been given a pilot order at ABC.\n\nJeff of the Universe, a sci-fi comedy, is being developed at YouTube.\n\nKnock Down the House, a political documentary about the 2018 elections, has been bought by Netflix.\n\nAn untitled Amazing Jonathan documentary has been bought by Hulu.\n\nAmazon has bought documentary about Real Madrid and Sergio Ramos.\n\nPriyanka Chopra is making a movie based on Wild, Wild Country.\n\nA movie about the first televised exorcism is being made.\n\nDeadwater Fall, a crime drama from the creator of Broadchurch, is coming to Channel 4.\n\nCasting News\n\nVictoria Pedretti will be the co-lead in the second season of You.
