        "text": "Hey @devyani this is such a great question! I love that you folks are interested in the tricky problem of exploring and explaining gaps or differences between groups without accidentally implying that larger/better-performing/typical-default groups are inherently “better” or “normal” or “the goal”.\n\nI think that @bvancil has brought up some excellent approaches to calculating different kinds of differences and, as they noted, answering slightly different questions. I want to talk more about those too (especially the part about omitting the intercept!).\n\nI’ve got a few basic alternatives to using one category as a reference point that I find really useful depending on where you are trying to put the focus of your information.\n\nLet’s say I have this data:\n\nAverage client satisfaction by Race\n\nWhite: 86%\n\nBlack: 45%\n\nHispanic: 56%\n\nAsian: 80%\n\nIf I only care about certain categories:\n\nI can talk about those groups in relation to an average instead of a reference category, and that average can still include the other categories.\n\nIf want to talk about differences above a category:\n\nIf I want to put focus on the difference between certain categories and the lowest performing category, I can report it that way, regardless of what the lower category is (and in fact, it might change over time across reports/projects). This way you aren’t arbitrarily choosing to always set up a prevailing dichotomy (in this example Black vs White), you are comparing categories against the worst and you don’t have to name it. (This can also work in reverse where you compare specific categories against an unnamed “highest” category).\n\nIf I want to compare against a meaningful benchmark:\n\nInstead of looking at gap between categories, we can compare under/over performance to a meaningful benchmark to our organization. I really like this one for its subtle yet powerful suggestion that we are measuring ourselves not the characteristics of clients/types of people.\n\nIf I care about gaps, but don’t need to emphasize specific pair by pair groups:\n\nWe might just care about the existence and magnitude of a gap regardless of who it’s between, especially at the beginning of exploring these issues, or if the consequences of identifying and describing the gap won’t require information about which groups they are between. By burying the group names, we don’t leave any room for prejudice based on prior assumptions about people.\n\nOf course, each of these has pros and cons and ultimately, to choose we need to know what we’re trying to accomplish. When you say:\n\nI totally get what you mean, but I also think that this whole question points to what I call a “negative rationale” in that you might not have a specific group or perspective you know you want to prioritize, but you do have some stuff you don’t want to do:\n\nIt can be useful to engage with this question: “What do I want to have happen when I release this research on differences?” How do you want that information to be used and how do you want people to feel about it?\n\nThis all makes sense! Thank you @devyani for the question and @bvancil and @Heather for the replies!\n\nWhen I first saw @devyani 's question, my initial answer would have been ‘Wouldn’t it depend on the research question’?\n\nIf my RQ does have something to do with comparing responses for groups, the question would guide which is the reference group (e.g., differences in experiences; does X group report a worse experience than Y group, Y is the reference).\n\nIf I don’t have that RQ, or as you say, there’s no specific community focus for the research, and my RQ is more about ‘controlling for’ Race in the model (to the extent that it statistically can be, and understanding what Race actually means in your model), then I would de-prioritize sharing the resulting coefficients as it was not the focus of your analysis and interpretation based on the reference group could be misleading.\n\nMy next thought would be, for looking at trends in experiences, is it possible to look within groups? Rather than trying to model all racial groups at once with Race as a variable, disaggregate and look at just one group at a time? I know it decreases sample size, but a good graph is worth ten thousand words. Then, changes over time in perceptions of the support focuses on the experiences of that one group, rather than focusing on their experiences relative to another group.\n\nJust my two thoughts. Thank you all for the discussion!"
