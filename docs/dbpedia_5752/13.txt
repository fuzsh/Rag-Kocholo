I'm No Dummy 2: The Not-So-Lost Footage

I'm No Dummy 2 is a hilarious batch of outtakes, uncensored interviews and extras in this follow-up to the hit comedy doc I'm No Dummy. This perceived novelty act is an extraordinary art form. Jeff Dunham, Terry Fator, Jay Johnson, Lynn Trefzger, Tom Ladshaw & others provide a rare glimpse into the humorous delight and creative invention involved in how these unique entertainers do what they do.
