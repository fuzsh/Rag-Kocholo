        "text": "Biography\n\n1952 -\n\nActress\n\nIsabella Fiorella Elettra Giovanna Rossellini, born in Rome on June 18, 1952, is a model and an actress, daughter of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini. She is probably best known for her role as Dorothy Vallens in David Lynch's Blue Velvet. She later took a part in Wild at Heart by the same director.\n\nOther roles include Cousins a Hollywood remake of the French film Cousin, Cousine, and Nimue in the 1998 mini-series, Merlin opposite Sam Neill, Helena Bonham Carter, John Gielgud, Rutger Hauer, James Earl Jones, Martin Short and Miranda Richardson.\n\nEven though she closely resembles her mother, Rossellini has surprisingly never been cast as Ingrid Bergman in any film, although she did perform a parody of Bergman's character Ilsa Lund from Casablanca in an episode of Tales from the Crypt.\n\nShe was briefly (1979-1983) married to director Martin Scorsese and was also romantically linked to David Lynch for many years. Her autobiography, Some of Me, was published in 1997.\n\nBeginning in 2003 she had a recurring role on the television series, Alias.\n\nRossellini has a daughter, Elettra, with Jon Wiedemann and an adopted son, whom she named after her father.\n\nReferences\n\nThis article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
