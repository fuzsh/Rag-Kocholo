        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Director , Screenwriter , Producer more\n\nNationality Italian\n\nBirth May 8, 1906\n\nDeath June 4, 1977\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nRoberto Rossellini is considered one of the pioneers of neorealist cinema. He left his mark on the history of cinema with Open City Rome and Germany Year Zero .\n\nBorn on May 8, 1906 in Rome, Roberto Rossellini grew up in a bourgeois, film-loving family. His father, Angiolo Giuseppe “Beppino” Rossellini, created the first cinema in Rome. Roberto’s brother, Renzo , also evolved in the world of cinema, becoming a composer of film music (notably those of his brother).\n\nAt 31, Roberto Rossellini made his first documentary, “Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun”. He collaborated with Luciano Serra, pilot , supervised by the son of Benito Mussolini. He then made a few commissioned films, including Le Navire blanc . When the fascist regime collapsed, Rossellini worked on Open City Rome , considered upon its release in 1945 as the official birth certificate of neorealism. Co-written by Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini , the film is about the suffering of war. Made with few resources, it won the Grand Prix ex aecquo at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946. In Paisà , still on the theme of war, the filmmaker mainly casts non-professional actors. Rossellini completes his neorealist trilogy with Germany Year Zero .\n\nIf Rossellini’s name remains associated with neorealism, the main characteristic of which is to show reality as it is, the director will touch on other genres throughout his career. Thus, some of his films will be closer to commedia dell’arte ( The Machine to Kill Bad Guys ) or satirical fable ( Where is freedom? ). In the 1950s, he took a new direction. His controversial love affair with Ingrid Bergman (when their affair began, both were already married) became a source of inspiration for his feature films, such as Stromboli , Journey to Italy and Fear . Ingrid Bergman will star in six of his feature films. They separated in 1957, while the filmmaker had an affair with another woman during a trip to India for the film India (1959).\n\nIn the 1960s, he directed IL Generale Della Rovere and Vive l’Italie , then the historical chronicle Vanina Vanini , based on the work of Stendhal . black soul, whose tone is intended to be lighter and comic, is a failure. He then decided to abandon cinema in favor of television. This lesser known period of his career will nevertheless be very prolific. He strives to portray great figures and major historical events such as Socrates or The Seizure of Power by Louis XIV .\n\nIn 1975, he returned to cinema for a film, The Messiah . In 1976, he became president of the Cinémathèque française upon the death of Henri Langlois . The following year, he chaired the jury of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. He died a few days later, on June 3, 1977, of a heart attack."
