        "text": "It’s symptomatic of the world of movies that the longest piece in The New Yorker involving Roberto Rossellini (whose 1954 film “Voyage to Italy” is our DVD of the Week) actually had to do with the crush of paparazzi to get a glimpse of Ingrid Bergman and their newborn son, Roberto Ingmar, in Rome in 1950. (It’s by the great reporter Janet Flanner.) The imbalance—indeed, the injustice—is emblematic of the aspect of the movie industry that Rossellini found inimical: the part that had to do with show business. A 1949 Talk of the Town piece by Daniel Lang that coincided with his arrival in New York and his contractual agreement with Bergman for what would be their first film together, “Stromboli,” mentions the story outline for that film, which\n\nruns to about a dozen pages. A revision of this will comprise the script with which he will start shooting, and it won’t be much longer. Rossellini’s method is to begin with the rudiments of a story, develop his scenes as he goes along, and work out the dialogue on location. “Always, there is the danger that too much talk will stop the movement,” he told us, “and if the actors got the dialogue too early, they would go home and think how they would like to do it, not how I would like them to do it.” Rossellini uses very few artificial settings for his pictures. “When I am in a studio in England recently,” he said, “I see a big wood battleship in front of a painted curtain of a colored sky. ‘This,’ I say to myself, ‘is the corpse of the movie industry.’ ”\n\nIn 1974, Rossellini was in New York again, for a series of discussions at the New School, and Wallace White spoke with him for Talk of the Town:\n\n“I am out of filmmaking now,” he said. “That is in the past, and I don’t like to look back. Now I am doing mainly historical documentaries for television. In any case, we have emphasized art too much. Artists have become like demigods in our society. It is better that they return to being what they were in the past—before the beginning of the Romantic period. Artists used to be humble, and that is what they should become again.”\n\nRossellini died in 1977. In 1989, Adam Gopnik wrote a Talk piece concerning a visit by Isabella Rossellini (one of the twin daughters born to Rossellini and Bergman in 1952) to Wesleyan University, where her mother’s archives were housed. Among the documents on hand was what Adam describes as\n\na gentle, perfect letter from Jean Renoir, urging Isabella’s mother not to give up acting: “The cult of great ideas is dangerous and may destroy the real basis for great achievements, that is the daily, humble work within the framework of a profession.”\n\nBoth Renoir and Rossellini urged humility on the artist; they had a different conception of what the term implied. Speaking at the New School in 1974, as reported by White, Roberto Rossellini said, “The reason for life is reason, not beauty.” I doubt that Renoir would have concurred. In 1956, Bergman starred in Renoir’s “Elena and Her Men”; she never worked with Rossellini again. (They divorced the following year.)"
