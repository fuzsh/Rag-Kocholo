They had two sons.\n\nIn 1937 he made a documentary and in 1940 he assisted Goffredo Alessandrini on \"Luciano Serra pilota\", a very successful film. He was a close friend of Mussolini's son Vittorio and perhaps this supported his career. In 1941 he directed \"La nave bianca\" (\"The White Ship) and it was followed by \"Un pilota ritorna\" (\"A Pilot Returns\" (1942) and \"L'uomo dalla croce\" (\"The Man with a Cross\") in 1943. around this time he befriended Federico Fellini and Aldo Fabrizi.\n\nAfter the fall of the fascist regime he quickly created the anti-fascist \"Roma città aperta\" in 1945. In 1950 he separated from Marcella and started an affair with Ingrid Berman. They collaborated on \"Stromboli terra di Dio\" (1950). They married and had three children, among them Isabella Rossellini. They worked together on several films. In 1957 he visited India and he started an affair with the screenwriter Sonali Das Gupta (d.07/06/2014). She was married and the scandal caused Nehru to ask him to leave India. He separated from Bergman soon afterwards married Sonali and adopted her young son. He left Sonali in 1973 for the young Silvia D'Amico. In 1977 he died in Rome.\n\nRelated persons\n\n was adviser of Fabrizi, Aldo"
