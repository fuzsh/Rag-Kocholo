        "text": "Rossellini. Rossellini is one half of the Truffaut/Godard of Italian Neorealism movement with De Sica and I’m not sure there’s a Bicycle Thieves without Rossellini. Rossellini is the Godfather and unofficial founder of Italian neo-realism (though realism has always been a part of cinema with expressionism). Visconti has some claim to that as well with Ossessione but if I had to put one person’s face on that movement it would be Rossellini with the war trilogy: Rome, Open City, Paisan, and Germany Year Zero. These three films are amongst the greatest of the entire 1940’s.\n\nBest film: – Rome, Open City. It just smacked people across the face in 1945 and helped served as alternative to Hollywood. It may seem like just a drama by today’s standards of realism (from Kiarostami to the Dardenne brothers) but it’s a wonderful drama.\n\ntotal archiveable films: 10\n\ntop 100 films: 0\n\ntop 500 films: 4 (Rome, Open City, Germany Year Zero, Journey to Italy, Paisan)\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 6 (Rome, Open City, Paisan, Germany Year Zero, Journey to Italy, Il Generale Della Rovere, The Flowers of St. Francis)\n\nmost overrated: Journey to Italy. The TSPDT consensus has it at #73 and I’m at #299 so there is a disconnect here. I really like the film and still have work to do on it with subsequent visits but I have to call this one overrated at this point.\n\nmost underrated: Germany Year Zero. It’s devastating and the gloomiest Italian neorealist film I’ve seen. I love both films so this is no insult but if this came out before Rome, Open City think this would be regarded as the better film of the two. The TSPDT consensus has it at #226 and I’m at #199.\n\ngem I want to spotlight: Paisan. I’m not as studied on Rossellini as say like Altman or Ozu but at this point I do think more of his 1940’s war trilogy than his 1950’s Ingrid Bergman films. This could change with time but for now I’m spotlighting this film which is “Chillingly blunt, doggedly unsentimental, and emotionally overwhelming”- cinepassion.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits: Rossellini does brilliant work with natural set pieces and the rubble and ruins caused by WWII. He favored long shots, open endings (often unhappy endings), deglamorizing the myth of Hollywood. He was beloved by the Cahiers critics for telling his story through photography (Bazan)/realism and is endlessly influential to world cinema and indie cinema especially (to the tradition carried on by the Dardenne’s today).\n\ntop 10\n\nRome, Open City\n\nGermany Year Zero\n\nJourney to Italy\n\nPaisan\n\nIl Generale Della Rovere\n\nThe Flowers of St. Francis\n\nStromboli\n\nThe Rise of Louis XIV\n\nFear\n\nEscape by Night\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1945- Rome, Open City MP 1946- Paisan MS 1947- Germany Year Zero MP 1950- The Flowers of St. Francis HR 1950- Stromboli HR 1954- Journey to Italy MS 1954- Fear R 1959- Il Generale Della Rovere HR 1960- Escape By Night R 1966- The Rise of Louis XIV R\n\n*MP is Masterpiece- top 1-3 quality of the year film\n\nMS is Must-see- top 5-6 quality of the year film\n\nHR is Highly Recommend- top 10 quality of the year film\n\nR is Recommend- outside the top 10 of the year quality film but still in the archives"
