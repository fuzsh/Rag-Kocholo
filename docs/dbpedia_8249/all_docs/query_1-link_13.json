        "text": "(1906–77). Italian motion-picture director Roberto Rossellini directed the first film created in the Italian style of filmmaking called neorealism, Open City (1945). Neorealist films featured natural settings in which actors either were or looked like ordinary people involved in commonplace situations.\n\nThe son of a successful sculptor and architect, Rossellini was born on May 8, 1906, in Rome. In 1931 Italy’s Fascist government confiscated his father’s fortune. Three years later Rossellini began working at odd jobs in the film industry. He directed a full-length feature, White Ship (1941), but navy officials objected to its antiwar tone. His name was removed from the film, and it was released anonymously.\n\nDuring World War II Rossellini directed propaganda films for the Italian government but also was affiliated with the underground film movement that secretly recorded the activities of the anti-Fascist Resistance. Open City, which incorporated this documentary footage shot during the war, set the style for postwar Italian films in its realistic portrayal of life in Italy during its occupation by Nazi Germany. It was acclaimed internationally as one of the most outstanding films of the postwar period. Paisan (1946), a series of six episodes of World War II in Italy, also won worldwide notice.\n\nRossellini’s realistic technique continued in Germany, Year Zero (1947) and India (1958). The Flowers of St. Francis (1950) presented a series of anecdotes about the Italian saint. Stromboli (1949) and The Lonely Woman (1953) were outstanding in a series of films exploring the meaning of freedom. These movies starred the actress Ingrid Bergman, whose love affair with Rossellini caused an international scandal. Their marriage in 1950, after both sought divorces from their first spouses, was annulled in 1958.\n\nRossellini then directed a series of films with patriotic themes, including General Della Rovere (1959) and The Betrayer (1961). During the 1950s and 1960s Rossellini also directed a number of works for the stage, and in 1956 he directed his first film for television. From 1964 he devoted himself to television films, including the biographical Socrate (1970). Rossellini died in Rome on June 3, 1977. His realistic style strongly influenced the development of important cinema talents, such as the director Federico Fellini, who came into prominence in the 1950s."
