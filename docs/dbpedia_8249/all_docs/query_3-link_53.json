        "text": "Ilpo Hirvonen, a film enthusiast and a PhD student of theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki. This blog, however, is entirely dedicated to cinema. The writings published here represent a continuous and perpetual attempt to define and discover what it is about cinema that makes it such a unique and enigmatic art form. This I prefer to do in the form of essays on single films, but every now and then I post more general essays on cinema and filmmakers. e-mail: ilpo.hirvonen@hotmail.com Twitter: @IlpoHirvonen The tags on the posts are mainly intended to be used within this blog. Therefore, each post has at least four tags: the director (Luis Bu√±uel, Andrei Tarkovsky; that is, english transliteration, accents, and full name are required), the nationality (Japanese, French), the production decade (1960's, 2010's), and the original title (Les quatre cents coups, Ivanovo detstvo) of the film. If the original title is not in English, then the English title (The 400 Blows, Ivan's Childhood) is also tagged. In addition, genre (melodrama, musical, film-noir) or movement (French New Wave, New German Cinema, French Poetic Realism) might be tagged. \"General Posts on Film\" is my trash tag, meaning the posts that cannot be located in any of the above categories (for example, posts on a film historical movement, a director's work, or a film theoretical question)."
