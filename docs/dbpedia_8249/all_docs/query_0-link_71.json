        "text": "Isabella Rossellini is set to preside the Un Certain Regard jury at this year’s Festival de Cannes.\n\nOn Friday, the actress and director was named president of the jury for the festival’s official selection, made up of 20 films that are due to be announced April 16.\n\nThe daughter of Italian director Roberto Rossellini and Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, to whom this year’s Cannes Film Festival is to pay tribute, Rossellini began her cinematic career alongside her father as a dresser, before acting for the Taviani Brothers, family friends who gave her a role in The Meadow. Her career quickly took an international turn, with White Nights, Tough Guys Don’t Dance, Les Yeux Noirs, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart.\n\nAfter returning to arthouse with The Funeral and Two Lovers in 2008, at the request of Robert Redford, Rossellini directed a miniseries for SundanceTV looking into the reproduction, seduction techniques and maternal behavior of animals.\n\nAside from her jury president duties, Rossellini also will take part in Cannes’ tribute to her mother by attending the screening of Ingrid Bergman, in Her Own Words, a documentary by Stig Bjorkman being shown as part of the Cannes Classics.\n\nShe also will launch her own “Ingrid Bergman Tribute” to celebrate the centenary of her mother’s birth. The show, directed by Guido Torlonia and Ludovica Damiani, will be based on both her autobiography and her correspondence with Roberto Rossellini, and will play on some of the world’s major theaters.\n\nRossellini will award the Un Certain Regard prize on May 23."
