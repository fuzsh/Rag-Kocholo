        "text": "Italian neo-realism emerged in the mid to late 1940s as a reaction to the terrible conditions that the Italian post-war reconstruction era; neo-realist cinema also emerged as a response to the historical epics and the Telefoni Bianchi films which were typical of Italian cinema. Neorealism was a sign of cultural change and social progress in Italy. Its films presented contemporary stories and ideas and were often shot in streets as the Cinecittà film studios had been damaged significantly during the war.\n\nThe movement has many distinct characteristics which are similar throughout the entire movement; these characteristics include the use of non-professional actors, filming on location, the socialist ideals of the directors, and the mise-en-scene of war. However, there are also many stylistic differences between the different directors, for example, De Sica and Rossellini use their cameras very differently.\n\nThe two major directors of the neo-realist movement were Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica. De Sica claimed that “neo-realism is poetry, the poetry of life” which shows that his films are simply an artistically inclined representation of the truth, whereas Rossellini said that “everyone possesses his own realism and everyone thinks his own is the best” which shows that the different directors will produce similar films about similar topics, however, their path to finishing those films and the decisions they made whilst filming will have been differently.\n\nRoberto Rossellini was born on May 8th, 1906 in Rome, Italy. He made his first documentary in 1937 called ‘Prélude à L’après-midi d’un Faune’ or ‘Afternoon of a Faun’. He then assisted Goffredo Alessandrini in making Luciano Serra Pilota (one of the most successful Italian films of the first half of the 20th century). In 1940, Rossellini was called to assist Francesco De Robertis on ‘Uomini sul Fondo’ or ‘S.O.S. Submarine’. After the collapse of the Italian fascist regime collapsed in 1943 and two months after the liberation of Rome, Rossellini was already creating ‘Roma Città Aperta’ or ‘Rome, Open City’ which was his first neo-realist film, starting his so-called Neorealist Trilogy.\n\nVittorio De Sica was born on July 7th, 1901 in Lazio in Italy. He began his career as a theatre actor in the early 1920s and joined Tatiana Pavlova’s theatre company in 1923. In 1933, he founded his own company with his wife Giuditta Rissone and Sergio Tofano. The company performed mostly light comedies, but, they also staged plays by Beaumarchais and worked with famous directors like Luchino Visconti. His meeting with Cesare Zavattini was a very important event: together they created some of the most celebrated films of the neorealistic age, such as Bicycle Thieves.\n\nThere are many similarities between the two directors which are common in all neo-realist films but its the differences between them that make their pieces of work so vastly unique.\n\nIdeologies\n\nOne of the major similarities between Rossellini and De Sica’s works are the ideologies and values presented by the two directors. For example, both Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948) and Paisan (Rossellini, 1946) show the negative treatment of the working class and the government’s lack of support and help towards these people.\n\nThis negative treatment of the working class can be seen in Paisan in the second episode which is set in Naples. This can be seen in the extreme wide-shot above which shows Joe and Pasquale sitting on the rubble, the juxtaposition of the destroyed buildings in the foreground and the beautiful renaissance architecture in the background shows the difference between Italy’s future and Italy’s past. Pasquale is part of the working-class and he represents Italy’s future, however, he is being let down by his government as he has been displaced by the war and is forced to live in a cave.\n\nJoe is also part of the working class due to his race, however, when he goes to Pasquale’s “house” he is treated as if he is a king or a hero which would have never happened in America, in this scene Joe manages to transcend the barriers of race which could have only happened during the war. A wide-tracking-shot (shown above) shows the children running up to Joe and chasing after him with large smiles on their faces.\n\nThis scene also highlights a stylistic difference between the two directors because during two shots of the caves Rossellini ignores the need for contiguity and continuity editing to show a real and non-choreographed shot of the displaced citizens, showing that Rossellini cares more about representing the truth than creating a film which is easy to follow for the viewer.\n\n(If I were to have filmed this I would have made sure that the contiguity and continuity editing was consistent throughout and the actors didn’t stare at the camera because whilst this has the effect of showing the seriousness of the situation to the audience it does jarr them out of the film and can stop them from truly feeling the emotions of the scene.)\n\nDe Sica also shows the negative treatment of the working class in Bicycle Thieves in the pawn shop sequence.\n\nA mid-shot shows Ricci and his wife having to sell their bedding so that Ricci can buy his bike back which would allow him to work. This shot shows the long line of people behind him who are also selling their belongings to make money which highlights that this is a large problem instead of only being a problem for a select few, this shot also shows that government is not helping because the Italian people are having to sell their belongings to get jobs and make money.\n\nThis shot does, however, shot one of the major differences between De Sica’s cinematography and Rossellini’s because De Sica uses his “wandering camera” to linger on the people behind Ricci in the queue further emphasising the scale of the problem. The “wandering camera” was a common camera movement during De Sica’s films which shows his particular film style.\n\nLater in the sequence De Sica tilts the camera, something which is also typical of his films and rarely seen in Rossellini’s neo-realist films, to show the amount of bedding which has previously been exchanged at the pawn shop, this allows the audience, both modern and contemporary, to understand the scope of the situation and the hardships that most, if not all, working-class people were facing at the time.\n\nNon-Professional Answers\n\nAnother similarity of both Rossellini and De Sica’s films is their use of non-professional actors to enhance their films, however, this also highlights a difference between the two directors because the way they train and teach the actors. This can be seen in Bicycle Thieves (De Sica, 1948).\n\nDe Sica thought that the key to using non-professional actors was to train and work with them so that he achieved a uniquely realistic performance without the performance becoming Hollywood and overperformed.\n\nThis training of his actors can be seen in a low-angle wide-shot showing a large group of unemployed men standing at the bottom of the steps with an official standing above them. The careful teaching and rehearsing that De Sica did, allowed Ricci and the other working-class men to appear desperate and needy which makes the audience more sympathetic for Ricci when he later loses his bike and becomes unable to work because the spectator understands that this was Ricci’s only chance. This shot also highlights another difference between the two directors as De Sica’s careful and different framing, also not seen in Rossellini’s films, causes the crowd to become positioned at the bottom of the steps, and the screen, which makes them appear like a sea of distraught and desperate effaces, highlighting the low position of these people in society at the time, however, the official is position above them emphasising his increased power over the people. This power is also shown through his cigar and glasses which represent his wealth and position in society, the bureaucrat is representative of the Italian system and infrastructure and because he cannot give jobs to the unemployed he portrays the system as failing and ineffective.\n\nRossellini, however, said that to him using non-professional actors should seem like he has “abandoned the individual in front of the camera and letting him construct his own story.” When asked to explain why he preferred non-professional to professional actors, he said that “in order to really create the character that one has in mind, it is necessary for the director to engage in a battle with his actor which usually ends with submitting to the actor’s wish. Since I do not have the desire to waste my energy in a battle like this, I only use professional actors occasionally”.\n\nSocialism\n\nAnother similarity between the two directors is their socialist political view and how they show this in their films. Socialism is shown in both Rome, Open City (Rossellini, 1946) and Umberto D. (De Sica, 1952).\n\nSocialism is shown in the closing shot of Rome, Open City as a long shot shows the children walking away from the camera with Rome’s skyline and memorable buildings, such as St. Paul’s Basilica, in the background. The skyline is lit brightly by the sun which creates a feeling of happiness in the audience, this feeling is emphasised as the children are all walking in groups or with partners focusing the audience on their comradery and friendship. Rossellini uses the children to represent a sense of hope for Italy’s future, as they are the next generation of society which shows Rossellini’s sense of socialism and comradery.\n\nDe Sica’s social views can be seen in Umberto D. during the opening protest scene as De Sica uses a series of wide-shot to show the elderly, protesting their low pensions and their treatment.\n\nThis shot presents the elderly as a hindrance to society as vehicles have to stop to let them by and police officers were called out to help maintain the situation. The vast quantity of elderly people allows De Sica to represent them as a swarm or rests. However, the number of people also highlights the number of people that were let down by the government, which emphasises that the problem is a general issue and not specific to a few people. Although, it is the sheer number of people in this shot that highlights the socialist views which began to emerge after the war in retaliation to the fascist regime which was forced onto the Italian people during Mussolini’s rule.\n\nBlack and White\n\nA common theme between all neo-realist films and one of the only true similarities between Rossellini and De Sica’s films is their use of black and white film. Whilst Rossellini didn’t have the option to use colour film as he lost a lot of his money during World War 2 when his studio was destroyed, De Sica optionally chose to film in black and white, this was explained by Tarkovsky who said that black and white filming “allowed the viewer to focus on the films true essence.”\n\nChanges\n\nIt is hard to say what I would change about these films because the films were powerful and meaningful when they were released, all of the things that I would want to change are the things that made the films have they impact they did.\n\nThe list of things I would change about the films is simple and easily do-able:\n\ncolour film – the use of colour film could emphasise the emotions that the directors wanted the audience to feel throughout the films (bright colours = happiness and dull colours = sadness),\n\nprofessional actors – the use of professional actors would allow more powerful and stronger emotions to be portrayed to the audience,\n\nOther than those two small changes, I think the films show and portray exactly what the directors want them to, they show how Italian society felt after World War 2 and they show the struggles that they went through.\n\n(credit for the screenshots, story, characters, and everything else goes to Roberto Rossellini and De Sica and credit for the information goes to my A-Level teachers and Wikipedia)"
