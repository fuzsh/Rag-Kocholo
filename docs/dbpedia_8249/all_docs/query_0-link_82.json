        "text": "Martin Charles Scorsese was born November 17, 1942. Suffering from asthma, he spent most of his time watching movies and by the time he was eight, he was already drawing his own storyboards that were directed/produced by himself. Although he considered going into priesthood, making movies was Scorsese’s true calling and he went on to make some of Hollywood’s most memorable films. Incorporating themes from his Italian American roots into his visceral, cinematic storytelling that has influenced generations of filmmakers. He is an American director, producer, screenwriter, actor, and film historian, whose career spans more than 53 years. Scorsese 's body of work addresses such themes as Sicilian-American identity, Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, machismo, modern crime, and gang conflict. Many of his films are also notable for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity. Part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinema history. For three decades Scorsese has been at the forefront of American cinema. Its most avid champion and often its most electrifying practioner. The most cinematic of directors, he has also been among the most formally restless and exploratory, evolving an obsessive-compulsive mise-en-scene based on dynamic, agile camerawork and radical editing rhythms.\n\nItalian Fascism is an authoritarian and nationalistic system of government and social organization, it was the political result of the relationship between socialist and nationalist rhetoric. It is a form of governance which employs intolerant views and practices, advocating traditionalism, interventionism and sameness rather than individualism. In order to promote their totalitarian ideals during the 1930s to 1945 fascist politicians such as Benito Mussolini, who had previously been a socialist newspaper editor, employed propaganda that included virtually all modes of media: the press, posters and film. The widespread dissemination of totalitarian ideals infiltrated into the school system where young Italians born from 1910 to 1935 were taught to “obey and fight.” The purpose of this paper is to analyse the diffusion of the Italian Identity through fascist propaganda from 1922-1943 and the identity that was diffused as a result of the exploitation of Mussolini’s various propaganda mediums. Did fascist propaganda contribute to the diffusion of an Italian identity? If so, what identity was diffused?\n\nItalian neorealism (1945-1953), through directors like Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, made its trademark on cinematic history not only in Italy, but also throughout the world. It was films such as Rome Open City (Roma città aperta, 1945), The Bicycle Thief (Ladri di biciclette, 1948), and Umberto D., (1952) whose style of depicting the harsh economic and social realities of the poor and working class of Italy took off as a new cinematic style after World War II. Neorealism is a response to desperate economic situations and often illustrates suffering, poverty, injustice, and/or discrimination. Many argue that neorealism is a way of seeing reality without prejudice due to the documentary-like technique of the film and its ability\n\nThe origin of “Italian Neorealism” began after the fall of Mussolini’s Fascist regime in 1943 and the end of World War 2. Now being free from fascist censorship Italian directors were able to blend cinematic realism with social and political problems facing Italy which would have never been allowed earlier. The term “neorealism” was first used by film critic Antonio Pietrangeli towards Luchino Visconti’s film Ossessione. The “French New Wave” was started by five French film enthusiast: André Bazin, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, François Truffaut, Jacques Rivette who wrote and discuss cinema because they lacked the money to create films themselves. They talked about how movies have become stale due to the lack of innovation in the industry and decided to create their own original formats, such\n\nThe Italian fascist regime between the years 1922 to 1943 provoked many changes in areas such as education, religion, foreign influence and culture. In the film Un Tè Con Mussolini, Zeffirelli attempts to advocate certain implications to the viewers by purposely choosing to either conceal or reveal many of these transitions and their effects on the different sectors of Italian society. For instance, although the central character Luca is presented to have some form of schooling the film fails to address any of the educational procedures that the Prime Minister put in place in order to eliminate illiteracy and allow for all children to attain a decent education. Instead of highlighting the success in this part of the regime, Zeffirelli rather\n\nFrom 1922 until 1943, the cinema came under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, who ruled the kingdom of Italy. The cinema was set to often promote the Fascist state, pessimistically characterized, these films were many filmmakers were producing these types of uninspiring films due to the fascist regime. Films presented a different way of life about Italy, which avoided the real life struggles with reality, leaving a huge hole for directors of the neorealism era to emerge in. With the World War II commencing, damage and destruction to multiple countries, meant lack of workers, lack of equipment, and studios were not on offer to filmmakers, but this also created stories for many to hear and write about. Due to the war filmmakers were forced\n\nThe Bicycle Thief is probably the best known and most highly praised of all the Italian Neorealist films of its era. The films of the Neorealist movement were characterized by several primary ideas. Instead of featuring stories focusing on glitz and glamour, Neorealist films focused on the poor and the working class. Instead of building and fabricating complex sets to film on, they did their filming on location. And instead of trying to get the most well known, highly paid celebrity actors, they frequently used people that weren’t even professional actors and had no training for their starring roles. This all helped lend a sense of realism and weight to the stories.\n\nFuturism and Fascism were two essential movements in the history of the Italian state. Futurism was an attempt to rid Italy of its past and create a new, improved country through the destruction and aggression while fascism was a radical, political movement. The relationship between these two ideas continues to be questioned. Did Fascism cause Futurism, vice versa, or is there in fact no correlation between the two? I will discuss the interaction between Fascism and Futurism as well as several pieces of Futurist art work.\n\nDuring World War II many films in Italy the Italian community created a new type of genre for that specific decade called Italian Neorealism.The Neorealism genre was a style of film characterized by stories done by the poor and working class. These movies were typically filmed on location meaning not in a studio but rather at a real place and used nonprofessional actors. The films themselves contended with the difficulty of life post World War II. The early films were about social issues and war. Director Roberto Rossellini's created a movie during the Neorealist time called Rome Open City which was released in 1945. The movie shows a deeply moving portrait of Rome during the last couple years of the war, with Germany occupying the city and Allied forces slowly closing in. The film was made on whatever film stock Rossellini could gather up in the post war Italian economy. It was shot in the streets of Rome with a kind of documentary realism that would show an even greater impact to this story.\n\nRossellini engaged Fellini as a writer for Open City, which was an influential film in the Italian Neorealism movement, and earned him his first Oscar nomination for his contributions to the film (Encyclopaedia Britannica). Rossellini came to Fellini at his Funny Face Shop, which he had opened up with Enrico De Seta, where they were living during the postwar recession drawing caricatures of American soldiers. Rossellini came to Fellini to add gags to his script (Kezich 78). After this Fellini quickly became a prominent scriptwriter with his most known contribution to Italian cinema as a scriptwriter through Rossellini in films such as the 1946 Paisà. Fellini eventually made his director debut in collaboration with Lattuada in their 1950 film Luci del varietà, which was the first in a series of works dealing with provincial life. This film came out to very poor reviews and left Lattuada and Fellini with debts to pay for over a decade and the production company bankrupt (Kezich 114).\n\nThe rise and fall of Italian Fascism is important to the history of modern Italy because of its lasting influence. It has shaped and affected many areas of Italian society, such as its economy, politics, and social communication. Negative views toward the government and high levels of unemployment preceding this time led to the rise in right-wing politics and Fascism has made lasting impacts on the right-wing parties still in existence today. This literature review will discuss the rise and fall of fascism in Italy through Adrian Lyttelton’s The Seizure of Power; Fascism in Italy, 1919-1929, the radical right wing as a consequence of fascism through Franco Farreresi’s Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War, and the lasting impact of the fascist political era on contemporary Italian society up until the late 1960’s through Samuel Barnes’ 1972 study on \"The Legacy of Fascism:\" Generational Differences in Italian Political Attitudes and Behavior\"."
