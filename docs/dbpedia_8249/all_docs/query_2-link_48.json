Photograph of Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini walking hand in hand on Stromboli Island, Sicily, Italy on April 28, 1949, at the beginning of the production of Rossellini's \"Stromboli\" (1950), struck circa 1959. \"Artists 1959 SEP 28\" stamp and news clipping of bottom half of same image, affixed with cello tape, with \"SEP 30 1959\" stamp on cello tape, all on verso.\n\nThe caption on the news clipping on the verso of the photograph reads, \"Ingrid and Rossellini hand in hand during 1949 / More like lovers than director and his star.\" The original 1949 caption to this photograph, according to GettyImages, ended with \"Here Miss Bergman and Rossellini wander hand in hand through one of the islands ancient Medieval castles. Dr. Peter Lindstrom, Biss Bergman's husband, has just left the United States for Italy, to join his famous wife.\"\n\nThis photograph of Bergman and Rossellini, hand in hand, while Bergman was still married to her first husband Petter Lindstom, was a very early press photograph which helped foment the scandal which would break when Bergman's pregnancy with Rossellini's child became public.\n\nIn 1937, at the age of 21, Ingrid Bergman and Swedish dentist (later neurosurgeon) Petter Lindstrom married, and in 1938 had daughter Friedel Pia Lindstrom. In 1949, while working on the film \"Stromboli\" (1950), Bergman and director Rossellini began an affair, resulting in Bergman's pregnancy with their son, Renato Rossellini (born February 2, 1950). The affair led to an enormous scandal in the US media, Bergman even being denounced on the floor of the Senate. As a result, Bergman left her husband and daughter in a highly publicized divorce and custody battle and returned to Italy. In May 1950, Bergman and Rossellini married. Bergman and Rossellini had two more children, twin girls Isabella and Ingrid, in 1952. Bergman and Rossellini divorced in 1957.\n\n7.25 x 9 inches. Very Good plus, with some creasing and edgewear.\n\n[Book #150364]"
