        "text": "I think she was one of our last \"actresses\" here in the states - they still exist in England. She was comfortable on stage (I've been told her work with O'Neill's scripts was tremendous). She could also do film and TV. She can be funny, incredibly scary and Anne's adoptive mother in Green Gables. Marvelous.\n\nI saw her in \"You Can't Take it With You\" in NYC decades ago - delightful production. She was effervesant as the Russian countess, who arrives to make blintzes.\n\nr72 That was her gift, she could communicate so much with so little.\n\nher acting itself was spotty at times in performance to performance but her body language, movement was always stellar. A lot of actresses are afraid to look ugly, afraid to react, afraid to laugh, screram or cry on camera or in front of an audience. She would let loose. Or with Marilla, so tightly wound and yet also fidgety, repressed and ready to explode. . . that quiver in her voice that sounded as if she was frustrated and on the verge of tears, whenever she spoke\n\n[quote]Why aren’t her Anne of Green Gables films available on streaming in the US? They’re classics.\n\nR26, they're available to rent or buy as stand-alone films, trilogy, or bundle on Gazebo, unfortunately, there is no option to buy only the first two films as a bundle. Gazebo also has free content:\n\n[quote][bold]Free Previews of Anne of Green Gables[/bold] Enjoy the first 15 minutes of Anne of Green Gables for free.\n\nThis includes Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story, and Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning Preview\n\n[quote][bold]Unforgettable Anne Moments:[/bold] A series of fans' favorite moments from the films.\n\n[quote][bold]Green Gables: Behind The Scenes:[/bold] Exclusive never before seen archival footage. Find out everything you need to know about how the iconic Anne of Green Gables movies were created.\n\n[quote][bold]The Missing Story of Marilla Cuthbert:[/bold] In this stand alone episode from Road to Avonlea, Marilla passes away and Rachel is left with Green Gables and the two young children they have adopted. This story provides the missing link in the chronology of the Green Gables films; between Anne of Avonlea (Anne II) and Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story (Anne III).\n\nRegistration is required to watch free content, I haven't watched any of it so I can't say how it is. I own the \"Anne of Green Gables\" and \"Anne of Avonlea\" DVDs but have also considered buying digital copies.\n\nThis thread prompted me to read her autobiography, which is pretty good. She died before she finished writing it, so the editor Tom Viola interviewed her friends and family (including both sons and her last partner) and deftly interspersed their perspectives with her own. After she and George C. Scott divorced for the second time, a gay couple, antiques dealers she knew from Greenwich Village, moved in with her at \"The Farm\" in South Salem, NY, and helped raise her sons. Another gay man, whom she met when she was in Malibu and he knocked on her door randomly looking for work as a housecleaner, eventually moved to the Farm too and stayed for over a decade, trying to keep her chaotic house in order and in the process becoming a close friend. When she was President of Actors' Equity in the 1980s, she helped spur fundraising for AIDS support, and writes very movingly of the death of her friend the actor Orrin Reiley in 1984 at age 37, who was the first person she knew who had AIDS. She was a very loyal friend and by instinct a positive force in her personal and professional circles, although she memorably recounts her epic dust-ups with the directors Alan Schneider (on \"The Ballad of the Sad Cafe\") and Nikos Psacharopoulos (on \"The Cherry Orchard\"). Like Scott, she drank way too much for way too long, but sobered up in her last couple of years when she was battling cancer. Her mother had been a Christian Science \"practitioner,\" and, surprisingly, her own misplaced faith in this religion led her to reject the advice of her oncologists. She worked for money when she had to, but even then would only take parts where she believed she could somehow create a interesting character, even if the script wasn't great. She had no regrets about turning down the role of Nurse Ratched in the movie \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" telling her disappointed agent who called her when Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for her performance, \"Don't worry about it. I wouldn't have won it. You can't play someone you hate.\""
