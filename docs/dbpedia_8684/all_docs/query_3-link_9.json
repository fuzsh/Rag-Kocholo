Grant was part of the production staff in Anne of Green Gables and the executive producer for later Sullivan adaptations.\n\nColleen was ill with food poisoning when they shot the scene in Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel where Marilla and Anne discusses Diana's engagement.\n\nGallery[]\n\nAnne of Green Gables Wiki has 10 images of Colleen Dewhurst (view category).\n\n[]"
