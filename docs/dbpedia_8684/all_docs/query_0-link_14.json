        "text": "In the novel there are strong suggestions that when Burke Denning went in to Regan's bedroom it was with the intention of molesting her, which is why Pazuzu threw him out the window.\n\nI have often heard that Shirley MacLaine and her daughter Scahi were the originals for Chris MacNeil and Regan since Blatty lived next door to them, but I've never heard that Sachi was ever \"possessed.\" The story was actually based on the infamous case of a boy in St. Louis in the 1940s, \"Roland Doe,\" having exorcisms performed on him after he was supposedly possessed. Blatty had heard about the case when he was an undergraduate at Georgetown University, near where he set the novel.\n\nWhat the film is really '\"about,\" though, is the horror that middle-class Americans of the Greatest Generation had in the late 60s and early 70s of their children (the Boomers) rebelling against their values and becoming something other than what they wanted them to be. This is likely why books and films about demonic children were so popular at the time.\n\n[quote]The podcast summarizes info gathered from at least 2 different Skeptic Enquirer articles\n\nDo you mean Skeptical Inquirer? One article is written by the podcast guy himself so I will assume that's not what you meant. The “Exorcism! Driving Out the Nonsense” article by Joe Nickell is not behind a paywall. He doesn't have anything particularly insightful to say other than the usual \"couldn't a teenager have faked this?\" leading questions, but he does mention an Opsasnik who has actual evidence apparently, published many years ago in a WaPo article. I'll look for that.\n\n[quote]also discusses a book extrapolated from notes found by one of the observers of the original exorcism.\n\nA book written from notes that were found. Sure.\n\n[quote]Then there's a newspaper interview with the \"victim's\" 20's female companion after his death describing him as \"a very bad boy.\"\n\nOkay, but you said R., the kid, called himself that and that someone reported it after his death, which was already third-hand information. Now it's a former girlfriend calling him that.\n\nI'm certain the possession was fake, it's just that a bunch of unsourced information with only a link to some dork's podcast wasn't exactly the kind of evidence I was expecting, given the information you were posting as verified fact.\n\nThe part about the priest coming before his death is eerie:\n\nBut the man who inspired it had a sad end to his life: Hunkeler’s three children — two daughters and a son — had long been estranged from their father and did not attend the funeral, the companion said.\n\nSword said he reached out to author Mark Opsasnick, who was among the first to research the story in his 2016 book, “The Real Story Behind the Exorcist: A Study of the Haunted Boy and Other True-Life Horror Legends from Around the Nation’s Capital.”\n\nOpsasnick was among the first to question the supernatural occurrences around Hunkeler and concluded that he was probably just a spoiled kid vying for attention.\n\nIn 2018’s “Diabolical Possession and the Case Behind the Exorcist: An Overview of Scientific Research with Interviews with Witnesses and Experts,” writer Sergio Rueda reported how a Hunkeler family friend explained the clan’s dynamics: The father tended to spoil Hunkeler and the mother was stricter. She was also, according to an interview with Schulze, very superstitious. The minister admitted he initially wondered if Hunkeler may have manipulated her beliefs, turning to trickery to get her to take him out of school for a while.\n\nAccording to Hunkeler’s companion, the man himself never believed that he was the victim of satanic possession and he shunned religion.\n\n“He said he wasn’t possessed, it was all concocted,” said the companion. “He said, ‘I was just a bad boy.'”\n\nStill, there was one last thing she couldn’t explain. Shortly before Hunkeler died last year, a Catholic priest appeared at his home to perform last rites, she recalled, adding that she did not call the priest.\n\n“I have no idea how the Father knew to come,” she said, “but he got Ron to heaven. Ron’s in heaven and he’s with God now.”\n\n[quote]I think over analyzing films is an internet phenomenon. Back then, you watched a film and went on with your life. Now, people buy movies and watch them dozens of times and scrutinize them to death. Not every aspect of films have hidden meanings or an alternate significance.\n\nI don't think The Exorcist necessarily has a hidden meaning; not unlike the Pride & Prejudice\" thread, I think part of what makes great art - movies, books, whatever - is that they can mean different things to you at different points in your life. As an older person, I see the sense of regret that Karris, Merrin & Chris have & how the demon holds that up to them, making them question their choices & lives. In Pride & Prejudice, I have a better appreciation of how precarious life can be for a single person without a fortune (and I like MacFadyen better since he's been in Succession). I like reading different interpretations of how they view these characters & it says something for the content that people still find it relevant today even most though most DLers don't consider themselves even religious, much less catholic.\n\nI read the book (carried it around with me in catholic school….for attention) when it first came out. I remember Willie and Karl, the servant couple, had a daughter who was a drug addict and Kinderman suspected her of the church desecration and if Denning’s murder. I think I remember Kinderman asking — or insinuating — the daughter might be in a religious cult. I think Kinderman follows one of the parents who is secretly seeing the daughter and giving her food and money. Kinderman suspects the daughter and/or her friends visited Chris’ house to rob it, thinking no one was home and Dennings found them….so they killed him.\n\n(Remember, IRL the Mansons and Jeffrey McDonald cases featured drugged-out hippies with odd religious/occult views murdering people)\n\nThat’s why Kinderman is so insistent in seeing Chris’ sick daughter - to find out if she saw anybody else that evening.\n\nI also thought it might’ve been insinuated in the book that the drug addicted daughter might’ve been the one who desecrated the church with Regan’s paint — for occult reasons — and that the demon may have been brought into the house by the addict, who knows where her parents work and has visited the house to see one of her parents while Chris want there.\n\nDoes anyone remember any plot points like this in the book? I read it so long ago …..I may be misremembering\n\nThe exorcist is a conservative book. It’s all about fathers and lack of fathers. Regan’s father is out of the picture and clearly doesn’t care about her. He’s in Rome (hint, hint) with his new gf.\n\nKarl the butler is a concerned father trying to help his daughter. He also sits with Regan (in the book he sits in her room quite a lot and is unbothered by the demon). The strange thing is he tells his wife their daughter is dead “to spare her.” Then again, it was a different time. ***\n\nKinderman tells Chris “I have a daughter myself.” Unlike Regan’s father though, he talks about how much he cares for his daughter and would be concerned for her if she were ill.\n\nKaras has no father. IRL Blatty didn’t either. He and his mother lived in poverty and shame, getting evicted repeatedly. Karas chooses to becomes “father.” People call him father, he represents God the father on earth, and in the end he dies for the child Regan.\n\nMerrin is also a “father.” He explains to Karas how God is our father. Through demonic possession, the devil tries to convince us that we are ugly, filthy, full of eruptions, sores, pus, stench, vomit, diarrhea, illness, insanity and evil thoughts. The devil wants to convince us that God, our father, could not possibly love us because of our sins. But the devil is a liar. Our father loves us all, no matter what.\n\nRegan is an abused child. She has to be tied down, chained to a bed. She can’t be given food. She sits in her own excrement. She is bruised, smacked around, lacerated, molested with a crucifix, flung up and down like a rag doll. She screams in pain and hears pornography uttered by the demon. She humiliates others and is humiliated by her possession. Everything that happens to Regan is what happens to a severely abused child. Her humanity is stripped from her. The devil wants people to reject and mistreat Regan the way he mistreats her. But God says they can’t hate her. “This is my child. You must love and protect her.”\n\nMerrin also gives his life for a child, proving himself to be a father.\n\nSo…..do you think Blatty had a father fixation or what, lol? It’s funny how in this book he really shows Regan as being very negatively affected by the divorce and lack of father figure. Chris believes Regan’s acting out got very bad after her father missed her birthday. A psychiatrist in the novel tells Chris Regan may be acting this way out if guilt because she thinks the divorce is her fault. Her father left because he didn’t like her. Maybe she thinks she wasn’t a good daughter to him and she was too close to her mother.\n\nBut Blatty was married 4 times, putting his own kids through multiple divorces. Cafeteria catholic!\n\n*** OT- Years after I graduated from HS I found out a guy I went to school with was busted the night of HS graduation coming home from a party with some weed and acid in his car. He got sent upstate under Rockefeller drug laws. His Hispanic immigrant parents were ashamed their son was “a drug dealer” - he really wasn’t. No more than any other HS kid in the 70s who got high - they told their younger children their brother ran away to California and joined a hippie group. Funny thing - there had been a hippie farm near his upstate prison that turned into a Jesus freak commune and a girl from the commune started visiting him in prison, at the behest of their Jesus leader. He married her, converted to her fundy religion and stayed estranged from his family. So…immigrants. 1970s. Shame. Powerful. Everyone who comes to America wants the American success story and it’s painful and shameful when the opposite happens"
