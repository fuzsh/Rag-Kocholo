        "text": "By Liam Ronan\n\nForget ‘Paranormal Activity’, ‘REC’ or ‘Drag Me To Hell’: the last time a horror film managed to really scare me was way back in 1990.\n\nIt was a late screening of ‘The Exorcist III’ at the UCI in Swansea. The Friday night crowd were rowdy and wild. Smuggled beers were being passed around, the ushers had given up trying to keep us quiet and most of the lads, myself included, were having one last crack at impressing the available girls. But as the film began, everything slowly went quiet, and within minutes, we were given a new reason for not wanting to go home alone.\n\nAs the camera prowls down the darkened, quiet streets of Georgetown accompanied by a deeply unsettling soundtrack of guttural sub-Latin growls, a vaguely threatening voice utters one of the film’s first lines of dialogue:\n\n“I have dreams… of a rose, and then of falling down a long flight of steps.”\n\nThe quiet sanctity of an empty church is violently shattered by some unseen force. Throwing the heavy wooden doors open, it charges in, a defiant windstorm of screams. As prayer books are scattered and candle flames snuffed out, any viewers who doubt the demonic nature of the intrusion are promptly put right when a statue of Christ unexpectedly snaps its eyes open. Then we are out on the streets of Georgetown again, gliding through the dark as the opening credits unfold.\n\nAt this point, the entire audience fell completely and utterly silent, and I knew then that we were in for one hell of a show.\n\n‘The Exorcist III’ is a much-maligned flawed masterpiece that turns the rule of diminishing returns on its head. It ignores John Boorman’s ridiculous ‘Exorcist II: The Heretic’ to present itself as a direct sequel to the original film. Too bound up in provocative theology for the turbo-gore crowd, too tainted by the horror tag for serious movie fans, the film is stylistically similar to the original, but arrives as a far more entertaining package.\n\nIt was written and directed by William Peter Blatty, screenwriter for the classic ‘The Exorcist’ which was itself based on his bestselling book. The movie began life as a project designed to re-team Blatty with ‘The Exorcist’ director William Friedkin. Blatty initially resisted the idea, later revealing in the book ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’ that “Everybody wanted Exorcist III… I hadn’t written the script, but I had the story in my head.”\n\nBlatty’s initial concept was to produce a movie about demonic possession without repeating the ritual of the exorcism that formed the final act of the original film. But Friedkin disagreed with the direction Blatty wanted to move in, and the project faded into development hell.\n\nUnperturbed, Blatty developed his concept as a novel. Published in 1983 as ‘Legion’, the book was an instant bestseller, and by the end of the ‘80s he had fashioned it back into a screenplay. With studios such as Morgan Creek and Carolco now chasing the rights, Blatty chose to go with the former after executives at Carolco revealed they wanted him to change the storyline so that the daughter of the lead character becomes possessed. He refused, but Carolco still got their pound of flesh by producing the dire Leslie Nielson spoof, ‘Repossessed’, with Linda Blair in the central role.\n\nWith Morgan Creek putting up an $11m budget to realise Blatty’s vision, the writer/director sought respected actors who would be able to carry the story’s heavy themes of faith, friendship, belief and loss. The great George C. Scott agreed to star as Lieutenant Kinderman, the character played in the first film by the late Lee J. Cobb.\n\n“It’s a horror film and much more,” he told ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’. “It’s a real drama, intricately crafted, with offbeat interesting characters, and that’s what makes it genuinely frightening.”\n\nScott delivers a powerhouse performance as a man who has lost his faith in God after witnessing too much horror. When we first see him, he is standing on a riverside dock, examining the body of a young coloured boy who has been crucified on two rowing oars. The boy has been decapitated, his head swopped with one taken from a white plaster statue of Christ that has been done up in Al Johnson-style black face. As a final atrocity, ingots have been driven into the boy’s eyes.\n\n“Would a God who is ‘good’ invent something like death? I don’t buy it, Father. It’s not a winner.”\n\nJason Miller returns from starring in the original movie to play Patient X, a hospital inmate who could well be Father Karras resurrected, while Brad Dourif handles Patient X’s psychopathic alter ego, the Gemini Killer, and in doing so delivers the signature role of his long career.\n\nThe plot sees Georgetown plagued by murders identical to those carried out by James Venamun, AKA the Gemini Killer, a serial slayer who was electrocuted back in 1973. His execution took place around the same time that Father Karras was taking his final dive through Regan McNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nAs the bodies mount up, Kinderman realises that the victims are all connected to the Regan case. He discovers a nameless patient in the local hospital’s maximum security wing who looks exactly like the supposedly deceased Father Karras, but who claims to be the Gemini Killer.\n\nIt transpires that satanic intervention has caused the souls of both men to be entombed within the same body, as the Gemini Killer explains:\n\n“A certain matter of an exorcism, I think, in which your friend Father Karras expelled certain parties from the body of a child. Certain parties were not pleased, to say the least. The very least. And so, my friend, the master, he devised this petty scheme as a way of getting back, of creating a stumbling block, a scandal, a horror to the eyes of all men seeking faith, using the body of this saintly priest as an instrument of – well, you know. My work. But the main thing is the torment of your friend Father Karras as he watches while I rip and mutilate the innocent, his friends, and again, and again, on and on! He’s inside with us! He’ll never get away! His pain won’t end!… Gracious me, was I raving? Please forgive me; I’m mad.”\n\nEach death is prefigured by the presence of a blood-red rose displayed somewhere in the scene, a poetic visual touch that recalls the opening lines of dialogue. The murders themselves demonstrate a similar creative flair. A priest is attacked in his confessional box; injected with a drug that renders him passive but aware of all that is going on around him, he is messily decapitated. The killer carefully arranges the scene so that the dead priest remains sitting in the confessional, his severed head propped up in his lap for the next penitent parishioner to discover.\n\nFather Dyer, Karras’ friend from the first film and now a pal of Kinderman, is also targeted with the drug during a stay in the local hospital. Unable to resist, tubes are inserted into his heart and his entire blood supply is manually pumped out shortly after the two men watch ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ together at a cinema. The killer taunts Kinderman by leaving these very words written in blood above Father Dyer’s headless corpse.\n\nThe police are baffled when they discover that the culprit leaves a different set of fingerprints at every crime scene. Are they dealing with more than one murderer?\n\nThe film strikes an unsettling, disturbing tone that is maintained and enhanced even further by each of the murders. But the real showstopper, the one that scared the hell out of us all those years ago in that packed cinema auditorium, that one occurs at the hospital, late at night and in near total silence.\n\nBlatty’s set up is masterly: the camera remains static in a side corridor looking onto the hospital reception desk. It’s the graveyard shift, and a lone nurse chats with a bored policeman. All seems well.\n\nHearing noises from a side room, the nurse goes to check that the occupant is okay, first making sure that the policeman is still nearby. As she steps into the room, she doesn’t notice the policeman being called away by a colleague. The nurse is now alone.\n\nNothing happens for several beats. It’s a false scare; we start to relax as the nurse emerges from the room and heads back to her desk, and that’s when Blatty strikes.\n\nAs the nurse strides back to reception, the camera suddenly catapults forward, shattering the late night silence with a terrifyingly loud synthesised shriek as we see that right on the heels of the nurse is a shroud-wrapped figure brandishing a pair of surgical bone-clippers at her neck. A split-second later, it is over, and the scene quickly cuts to the discovery of the nurse’s body the next morning.\n\nThis simple set up is massively effective, and I still recall the wave of shock that washed over me when I experienced it for the first time back at the cinema. I remember the low burst of exhilarated chatter that broke out among the audience following this murder set piece, and when I looked around, I saw people digging themselves out of their seats and whispering ‘did you see that?’ to one another. The transition from static silence to synthetic scream really makes the scene work – had Blatty scored it more conventionally, the effect would have been far less impressive.\n\nThat’s the thing with ‘The Exorcist III’. It is one of the best examples I have ever found of how a director can combine fancy sound design with stark visuals to create unbearably tense horror.\n\nA case in point is the episode where Kinderman visits the local Jesuit university late at night. As he and the university president discuss the murders, a door creaks in an outer office. Kinderman turns in time to see a pile of papers lift in the breeze, as if someone has just walked past. Half-whispered Latin reaches our ears as Kinderman steps out to investigate.\n\nOn the landing outside, the lights flutter on and off. Harsh, murmured growls emanate low on the soundtrack. Kinderman looks around; in the flickering strobe, a distant statue of a Jesuit saint suddenly appears demonic and evil. Kinderman steps forward for a closer look, unsure of what he is seeing. The growls swell; someone approaches.\n\nAs the noise reaches a crescendo, Kinderman collides with the university president’s secretary. She screams, the lights return to normal, he apologises. She hurries on her way. Kinderman turns to look at the statue, which is utterly benign once more.\n\nSure, the payoff is a cheap shot equivalent of that cheesy cliché where a cat jumps out and spooks someone – but boy, does it work. Blatty pioneered the use of ‘vocal violence’ with this flick, and it’s a shame that it hasn’t been used as effectively in more genre offerings.\n\nKinderman realises that Patient X is possessing elderly residents of the catatonic ward and forcing them to commit the murders. When one victim-to-be, a priest called Father Kanavan, urges a charming little old lady to make a good confession, her response is chillingly delivered:\n\n“Seventeen of them, Father. The first was that waitress in Candlestick Park. I cut her throat and watched her bleed. She bled a great deal. It’s a problem I’m working on, Father. All this bleeding.”\n\nBlatty completed the film on time and only slightly over budget, but trouble occurred four months later when Morgan Creek suddenly realised that the director had delivered an Exorcist film without any exorcisms.\n\nThe original climax followed the ending of the book – with the Gemini Killer realising that the father he has sought to shame with his sickening acts of violence is finally dead, just as Kinderman shoots him in the head and brings the supernatural shenanigans to an end. Clips of this can still be seen in a trailer where Karras/the Gemini Killer/Patient X ‘morphs’ through a series of different faces.\n\nRather than let the studio bring somebody else in to make the required changes, Blatty opted to reshoot the ending himself. He introduced a new character at the eleventh hour – Father Morning, a priest who is briefly glimpsed in his room at the seminary as the evil entity that plagues Georgetown makes its presence felt. He then inexplicably turns up at the hospital to separate the two souls amid a fantastic battle of devilish special effects that cost an extra $4m to put on screen. It doesn’t make a great deal of sense, but fails to totally ruin the film as well. Blatty himself said of the new ending in ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’ that “It is all right, but is utterly unnecessary and changes the character of the piece.\n\n“The original story that I sold Morgan Creek, and that I shot, ended with Kinderman blowing away Patient X. There was no exorcism. But it was a Mexican stand-off between me and the studio.\n\n“I was entitled to one preview, then they could go and do what they wanted with the picture. They gave me a preview, but it was the lowest end preview audience I have ever seen in my life. They dragged in zombies from Haiti to watch this film! It was unbelievable. But I decided, better I should do it than anyone else.\n\n“I foolishly thought: I can do a good exorcism. I’ll turn this pig’s ear into a silk purse. So I did it.”\n\nThe cast sympathised with Blatty’s predicament.\n\n“We all felt really bad about it,” Brad Dourif told Blatty fan site theninthconfiguration.com. “But Blatty tried to do his best under very difficult circumstances. And I remember George C. Scott saying that the folks would only be satisfied if Madonna came out and sang a song at the end!”\n\nDourif elaborated on this to Fangoria magazine. “The original version was a hell of a lot purer,” he said. “I liked it much more.”\n\nBy the movie’s end, Father Morning is dead at the hands of the demon and Kinderman has rediscovered his faith: you cannot believe in the devil, he tells Patient X, without also believing in God:\n\n“I believe in death. I believe in disease. I believe in injustice and inhumanity, torture and anger and hate… I believe in murder. I believe in pain. I believe in cruelty and infidelity. I believe in slime and stink and every crawling, putrid thing… every possible ugliness and corruption, you son of a bitch! I believe… in you.”\n\nBlatty told Fangoria that when Patient X hisses “I must save my son, the Gemini,” at Kinderman in tones that recall the possessed voice that the late Mercedes McCambridge provided for the original film, this was intended to suggest the demonic entity, Pazuzu, is back holding the reins. This time, the demon’s voice was provided by an uncredited Colleen Dewhurst, an actress who was twice married to (and divorced from) George C. Scott in real life.\n\nPrior to the film’s opening across almost 1,300 screens in the USA, Blatty pleaded with the studio to call the film ‘Legion’ – a title which 20 years later has been used by another movie to depict a war between angels and demons.\n\n“I begged them when they were considering titles not to name it Exorcist anything, because ‘Exorcist II’ was a disaster beyond imagination,” he said. “You can’t call it ‘Exorcist III’ because people will shun the box office. But they went and named it ‘Exorcist III’, then they called me after the third week when we were beginning to fade at the box office and they said ‘We’ll tell you the reason, it’s gonna hurt, you’re not gonna like this – the reason is ‘Exorcist II’.’\n\n“I couldn’t believe it! They have total amnesia.”\n\nNevertheless, the movie made a respectable profit at the US box office – more than $26m – and has proven to be especially popular with rock and metal bands around the world.\n\nUS group Beyond sample the movie on the song ‘Limbless’ from their 1995 album ‘Reassemble’, and Canadian band Cryptopsy sample it for ‘Crown Of Horns’ off their ‘None So Vile’ album. Finnish metallers Children of Bodom top and tail the titular track from the ‘Fear The Reaper’ album, and thrash stalwarts Slayer based their song ‘Gemini’ on Brad Dourif’s character – it appears on the punk compilation, ‘Undisputed Attitude’.\n\nThe film is also apparently popular with serial killers – Jeffery Dahmer was reportedly watching it on video when police raided his charnel house of an apartment, and later claimed that it was his favourite movie.\n\nDespite the studio-imposed changes, Blatty remains proud of his achievements.\n\n“It’s still a superior film. And in my opinion, and excuse me if I utter heresy here, but for me, it’s a more frightening film than ‘The Exorcist’.”\n\nInterestingly, Blatty originally wanted to enlist John Carpenter as director, but as the man behind such classics as ‘Halloween’ and ‘The Thing’ later revealed in the book ‘John Carpenter: Prince of Darkness’, he shared the same problems with the plot that William Friedkin and the studio had expressed.\n\n“Blatty is a fabulous writer, and much of ‘The Exorcist III’ is brilliant,” Carpenter said. “But there was no exorcism in the third act.\n\n“I was ambivalent about the script, primarily because it didn’t have an exorcism… I kept suggesting a third-act exorcism and pushing the both of us to come up with some new, exciting and grotesque devil gags. Blatty was resistant, so I withdrew from ‘The Exorcist III’.”\n\nEven with the studio meddling, the finished film demonstrates that bringing in Carpenter wasn’t necessary. Blatty makes use of technology, directorial sleight-of-hand and solid old-fashioned acting to craft some truly scary chills, wrapping them in a satisfyingly intelligent and atmospheric horror movie that is crying out for a special edition DVD complete with excised (exorcised?) footage and more.\n\nThe director has tried for several years to locate the trimmed footage, which apparently includes an alternative opening where Kinderman views the dead body of Father Karras just after he has fallen from Regan MacNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nMorgan Creek claim to have lost the footage, but noted Exorcist expert Mark Kermode, who has described ‘The Exorcist III’ as “A restrained, haunting chiller which stimulates the adrenalin and intellect alike,” has insisted on his BBC blog that the search for the lost footage remains ongoing.\n\nSo here we are, two decades later. I’m still waiting for a director to step up to the plate and scare me as badly as Blatty did all those years ago. It hasn’t happened yet, and until it does, fans of ‘The Exorcist III’ will have to content themselves with dreams of a rose… and then of falling down a long flight of steps."
