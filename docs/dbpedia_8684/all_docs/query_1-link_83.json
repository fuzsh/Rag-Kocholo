        "text": "The Exorcist remains one of the scariest movies ever made. Nothing has left a greater impact on horror cinema. As a Christian, I knew I could only handle seeing The Exorcist once. It was years before I finally built up enough resistance to finally watch it. Rest assured The Bible was by my side the entire time (even now as I review the film). The Exorcist was originally a book written by William Peter Blatty. Although the book was fictional, it was inspired by an exorcism involving a 14 year old boy in the 1940’s. The Exorcist is terrifying because demonic possession is more real than people realize. I get chills just thinking about it. Blatty wrote and produced the film 2 years after his book became a bestseller.\n\nHe even managed to hire Oscar winning The French Connection director William Friedkin. The Exorcist was understandably a very difficult movie to get made. Casting big name stars was a nightmare, sets burned down, there were on set accidents, cast members died, and the movie went over budget. The Exorcist nevertheless became a huge success despite 1970’s audience members passing out, having heart attacks, or throwing up. Although Catholicism is the main focus, at least it got more people to go to church. The Exorcist was once the highest grossing R rated movie of all time and the first horror movie ever nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards…\n\nThe Exorcist is a modern horror classic, but a lot of people forget how much time is dedicated to build up and establishing characters. The opening is a very lengthy archaeological dig in Iraq that I never knew about. The sequence is meant to set up the evil demon Pazuzu as an ancient statue discovered by Catholic priest and experienced exorcist Father Lankester Merrin. Although A-list actors were difficult to secure, Max von Sydow was the most high profile star in the movie. Sydow is commanding, sincere, and brilliant at conveying the power of the exorcism, but we don’t see him again until the climax. Most of the film’s events take place in Georgetown, Washington D.C. The second and most prominent Catholic priest is Father Damien Karras. Karras is currently a Jesuit psychologist dealing with a crisis of faith. The guilt he feels over losing his mother is another big part of the movie I never knew about. Although Jason Miller was only a playwright at the time, he proved himself a worthy actor in the role.\n\nThe true focus is on fictional actress Chris MacNeil played by actress Ellen Burstyn. Chris is filming a movie called Crash Course on location with her daughter Regan MacNeil. Burstyn endured a lot while making the movie. Apart from convincingly playing a distraught mother, Burstyn suffered from a traumatic lifelong injury that was kept in the movie. Before passing away 11 months before the movie’s premiere, Jack MacGowran’s final acting role was as Chris’ alcoholic director Burke. Lee J. Cobb plays the officer investigating his mysterious murder and multiple real life priests play heads of the local church, but Regan is really the primary draw of The Exorcist. A 12 year old girl possessed by a demon was the most challenging thing to pull off. So many child actresses turned down the role thanks to a legion of understandably concerned parents. A 14 year old Linda Blair ended up being perfect for the now iconic role. Blair was surprisingly well adjusted before and after playing such a controversial character, but her disturbing mannerisms make all the difference. Regan is just a normal girl before making the mistake of messing with a Ouija board to contact “Captain Howdy.”\n\nThe possession is a slow process that gets gradually more disturbing as time goes on. Noises come from the attic, objects begin to move, and the church is vandalized. Regan’s behavior starts to change when she uses obscene language and pees in the middle of her mother’s party. Everyone from medical doctors to psychiatrists are consulted to no avail. Apparently a realistic cerebral angiography procedure disturbed some viewers more than even the movie’s supernatural occurrences. Regan’s bed violently shaking and her eyes turning white are just the beginning. The infamous crucifix scene alone should have insured an X rating. Yet the MPAA somehow allowed an R rating. Even by today’s standards a lot of the more brutal scenes are shocking. It’s at least fortunate that Eileen Dietz stood in for Blair during the more traumatizing moments. As well as physically portray Pazuzu in almost subliminal flashes of the demon’s face. Meanwhile, veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge lent her gravelly voice to the demon’s more profane and blashamous dialogue.\n\nMakeup artist Dick Smith turned an ordinary girl in a nightgown into a terrifying monster with perpetually worsening scars. A disturbingly realistic puppet was used for one of two infamous head turning scenes. The “spider-walk” was initially cut since most of the horror takes place in Regan’s bedroom. The possessed Regan calling itself the Devil makes consulting a priest the obvious answer. Karras is skeptical, but eventually initiates an exorcism with the church’s approval. The first encounter is a battle of will with the demon taunting Karras and vomiting pea soup in another memorably disturbing scene. The church calls in the professional exorcist Father Merrin who enters the house in an iconic shot where his silhouette looks up at a light from the window. The image became the movie’s poster and the piano theme from Jack Nitzsche was just as effective. The exorcism is the ultimate battle of good vs. evil. The entire sequence was filmed inside a freezer with Regan spinning her head 360º and floating in the air.\n\nMerrin and Karras proclaiming “The power of Christ compels you” is one of the greatest moments in horror movie history. SPOILER ALERT! Sadly all the stress and psychological torment gives Merrin a heart attack. So Karras makes the ultimate sacrifice by possessing himself in order to save Regan and throwing himself onto the equally iconic stone steps below. Regan thanks a priest with a kiss and all is well in the end. The Exorcist leaves a lasting impact that hasn’t been seen since its release in 1973. Parodies quickly followed along with imitators that never quite reached the quality of the original. The Exorcist won Best Motion Picture – Drama at the Golden Globes, but I think the public wasn’t ready for a horror film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Oscars including Friedkin for Best Director, Burstyn for Best Actress, Miller for Best Supporting Actor, Blair for Best Supporting Actress, Art Direction, Cinematography, and Film Editing. Only winning for Best Screenplay and Best Sound. The Exorcist is an excellent endurance of traumatizing horror.\n\nFollowed by: Exorcist II: The Heretic\n\nThe Star Wars Holiday Special is universally agreed to be the single worst thing to ever bear the Star Wars name. Happy Star Wars Day everyone! May the 4th be with you. Today I thought I’d review one of the most notorious TV specials ever made. Believed to be myth by even the most dedicated Star Wars fans, The Holiday Special was the very first follow up to A New Hope in 1978. It only aired once, but it was so unbelievably bad that George Lucas has been trying to bury it ever since. Thanks to fanmade video recordings and underground bootleg copies, The Holiday Special will never disappear. For once, Lucas wasn’t fully to blame for the specials failure. The entire original cast returned to appear in what was essentially a 2 hour variety show. One so bad, I have to talk about it separately.\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away… – The paper thin plot is strung together by Chewbacca needing to come home in time for Life Day. Life Day is the Star Wars stand-in for Christmas. I have no idea what the meaning of the holiday is supposed to be. Harrison Ford clearly doesn’t want to be here as Han Solo and is mostly seen with Chewie escaping TIE fighters in the Millennium Falcon.\n\nKashyyyk – The first baffling decision was having the opening 12 minutes be nothing but horrific Wookiee growls (with no subtitles). That decision can be blamed on George Lucas, because it was literally his only contribution. The Holiday Special features the first appearance of Chewie’s home planet Kashyyyk. Along with an entire awkwardly named family no one needed to see. There’s Chewie’s wife Malla, grandpa Itchy, and son Lumpy. It’s only between growls that unbearably long variety segments are watched by the family.\n\nCircus hologram – Lumpy first watches a truly bizarre hologram of a colorful alien circus for no apparent reason. The whole segment ties into nothing and feels more like a drug trip.\n\nMessage from Luke – That’s followed by Malla and Lumpy reaching out to Luke Skywalker accompanied by R2-D2. All he does is work on an engine in his X-Wing uniform and give Chewie’s family encouraging words. It’s especially awkward given the fact that Mark Hamill has a stiff tan and stares directly into the camera without blinking.\n\nTrading Post – The first major celebrity in the special is Art Carney of all people. He plays a Rebel trader named Saun Dann who services an Imperial guard. He’s also a friend of the Wookiees who gives presents to Chewie’s family. The only worthwhile part of this extended segment is an appearance from Darth Vader aboard a Star Destroyer. Although it’s clearly James Earl Jones overdubbing a scene from A New Hope in order to tie-in to the plot. Stormtroopers and Imperial officers are thus sent to Chewie’s home to search for them.\n\nCooking with Gormaanda – The first “comedy” segment is Harvey Korman playing one of three different characters. He plays the brown faced four armed alien Julia Child Chef Gormaanda in a segment where Malla follows her cooking video in the kitchen. It’s easily the worst part of the special, but it’s so ridiculously bad that it’s laughable. Especially for the “Stir whip stir whip whip whip stir” line.\n\nItchy’s fantasy – Itchy’s Life Day present is the point in the special when you really start to question what you’re watching. Chewie’s father literally watches a pornografic virtual reality simulator. By pornographic, I mean that he gets turned on by Diahann Carroll fulfilling his fantasy by singing in a trippy psychedelic acid trip. The first of far too many endless original songs is “This Minute Now.” It’s uncomfortable and I wanted it to stop.\n\nMessage from Leia – That’s followed by Princess Leia and C-3PO giving their own message to Malla about her missing husband. This segment is exactly the same as the Luke and R2 message. Except that Anthony Daniels is actually playing 3PO. Unlike Kenny Baker who had no involvement. You can tell Carrie Fisher was definitely out of it while filming.\n\nJefferson Starship music video – When the Empire breaks in, one of the Imperial officers smiles while watching a Jefferson Starship music video on a holographic device. The band is only in the special because they have “Starship” in their name. The song “Light the Sky on Fire” is catchy, but they play the entire 5 minute song for what feels like an eternity.\n\nThe Story of the Faithful Wookiee cartoon – Lumpy later watches a starlog that is easily the only highlight of the awful special. It’s significant for being the very first animated Star Wars project and first appearance of fan favorite bounty hunter Boba Fett. I’d go so far as to call it worthy of being cannon if the 70’s animation wasn’t so crude. The adventure picks up where A New Hope left off. Luke, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 make contact with Han and Chewie as they crash into the system Panna. They’re searching for a talisman that infects humans with a sleeping virus. Boba Fett has a great introduction atop a giant beast that he leads with a prod. Fett’s friendly partnership soon reveals him to be working with Darth Vader. His appearance was possible due to an uncolored image of the bounty hunter before The Empire Strikes Back was released. It’s all downhill when the cartoon ends.\n\nInstructional video – The most mind-numbingly boring segment features Harvey Korman playing another unfunny character. This time he’s an Amorphian android instructor with frequent malfunctions. Lumby uses his instructional video to build an entire fictional transmitter from scratch.\n\nCantina closing – Bea Arthur is about the furthest celebrity from Star Wars you can get. Yet she’s given an entire segment and song that doesn’t tie into anything. It’s just Arthur playing Cantina bartender Ackmena on Tatooine before getting shut down by the Empire. Harvey Korman once again holds us hostage by playing a flirtatious alien with a disturbing drinking hole on top of his head. The song “Good Night, But Not Goodbye” goes on forever as she slowly closes up to the tune of the Cantina song.\n\nLife Day – The special is brought to a merciful end when Chewie finally makes it to Kashyyyk in time for Life Day. Han defeats the Stormtroopers and very awkwardly interacts with the Wookiee family. Chewie’s reunion is filled with tender growls that lead up to the actual Life Day celebration. Which consists of unexplained balls of light that take the family to space wearing vaguely cultish red robes. More Wookiees are seen in red robes that were obviously used to cut down on fur bodysuits. The life tree ceremony unites Luke, Leia, Han, C-3PO, and R2-D2 for a final cheesy Christmas Life Day message. If you thought it couldn’t get any worse, they actually force Princess Leia to sing to the tune of the Star Wars theme song.\n\nIn conclusion, The Star Wars Holiday Special was absolutely painful to watch. I never knew it existed until I saw a poster in a Star Wars book of mine. I’m glad I could find the special on YouTube, because it really needs to be seen to be believed. The decisions are so wrong that it’s a miracle Star Wars continued to be the success it was. Variety shows are barely relevant today, so I was more bored than anything. I can’t say that I was angered by it since none of it is cannon. Although parts of the special have been referenced and/or repurposed throughout the years. Kashyyyk is practically identical to how it appears in Revenge of the Sith. Chewie’s family is never seen again, but I’m pretty sure Solo was hinting at their existence. Boba Fett’s inclusion was likely forgotten by the time he appeared in The Empire Strikes Back. It wasn’t until episode 1 of The Mandalorian that Life Day was overtly mentioned in cannon. More surprising is The Story of the Faithful Wookiee being added to Disney+ separate from the special they choose to ignore. The Star Wars Holiday Special is like a fever dream that messed up the franchise before it was cool. “May the force be with you.”\n\nP.S. I’ve supplied the full movie underneath for those brave enough to watch it.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is the animated precursor to the acclaimed live-action trilogy. Ralph Bakshi is a unique animator known for his crude hard R or X rated adult cartoons of the 70’s. He’s the last director you’d expect to make a faithful adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s beloved fantasy novels. Then again, Peter Jackson also got his start in lewd excessively R rated shlock. Jackson was actually introduced to The Lord of the Rings through Bakshi’s 1978 movie. They said it couldn’t be done, so Bakshi decided the dense trilogy was best told in animation. Really bizarre and trippy animation that he’s most known for. At least it was better than an adaptation starring the Beatles. The Lord of the Rings was actually the first animated movie to make extensive use of rotoscoping. Meaning live-action performers were traced over to make large scale battles like the mines of Moria or Helms Deep easier to animate. I actually do remember seeing the movie after The Fellowship of the Ring came out, but I blocked most of it from my memory. The animation inconsistencies and different approach to key moments didn’t feel right to me.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings feels long with its 2 hour & 15 minute runtime, but that’s because it adapts The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. Lack of The Return of the King finishing the story seriously enraged fans and casual moviegoers. The movie isn’t totally without merit, but it’s hard to appreciate something that was severely overshadowed by a far better work. The Lord of the Rings begins with the backstory of the One Ring told with live-action silhouettes. If you’re as extremely familiar with the story like I am, than the rest of the movie will be easy to follow. The hobbit Bilbo of the Shire leaves the Ring with Frodo who’s much more prepared to make the perilous journey. Gandalf is a dignified wizard with a long flowing beard, but Sam is a dufus. Merry and Pippin are pretty interchangeable. Aragorn has the commanding voice of John Hurt, but is vaguely Native American looking. Elves like Legolas and Elrond strangely don’t have pointy ears.\n\nMore strange is the fact that Legolas is one of the only non-C-3PO roles Anthony Daniels has ever had. Gimli is a rather large dwarf and Boromir looks like a viking. The most confusing decision was occasionally renaming Saruman, Aruman. Since some idiot thought Sauron sounded too similar to Saruman. The Fellowship plays out about the same just with much more stylized rotoscoped Ringwraiths and orcs. Along with the complete absence of Arwin and no lines for Eowyn. Galadriel is the only woman who speaks as the beautiful but mysterious elf. Despite the PG rating, the violence can get pretty bloody. The Two Towers seems far more rushed with a cartoony Treebeard having one scene, Théoden having little development apart from being fed lies by Wormtongue, and Gollum needing only a few scenes to make an impression. His look is pretty close to the Jackson version, but we never see Gollum take the hobbits to Shelob. Then post-battle ending narration makes it clear that this was only Part 1 of the epic journey. Something Bashki foolishly didn’t include in the theatrical version. The Lord of the Rings may lack the sophistication of grand live-action films, but its experimental approach is worth a curious viewing."
