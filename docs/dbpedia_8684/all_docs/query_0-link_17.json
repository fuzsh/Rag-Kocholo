        "text": "By Liam Ronan\n\nForget ‘Paranormal Activity’, ‘REC’ or ‘Drag Me To Hell’: the last time a horror film managed to really scare me was way back in 1990.\n\nIt was a late screening of ‘The Exorcist III’ at the UCI in Swansea. The Friday night crowd were rowdy and wild. Smuggled beers were being passed around, the ushers had given up trying to keep us quiet and most of the lads, myself included, were having one last crack at impressing the available girls. But as the film began, everything slowly went quiet, and within minutes, we were given a new reason for not wanting to go home alone.\n\nAs the camera prowls down the darkened, quiet streets of Georgetown accompanied by a deeply unsettling soundtrack of guttural sub-Latin growls, a vaguely threatening voice utters one of the film’s first lines of dialogue:\n\n“I have dreams… of a rose, and then of falling down a long flight of steps.”\n\nThe quiet sanctity of an empty church is violently shattered by some unseen force. Throwing the heavy wooden doors open, it charges in, a defiant windstorm of screams. As prayer books are scattered and candle flames snuffed out, any viewers who doubt the demonic nature of the intrusion are promptly put right when a statue of Christ unexpectedly snaps its eyes open. Then we are out on the streets of Georgetown again, gliding through the dark as the opening credits unfold.\n\nAt this point, the entire audience fell completely and utterly silent, and I knew then that we were in for one hell of a show.\n\n‘The Exorcist III’ is a much-maligned flawed masterpiece that turns the rule of diminishing returns on its head. It ignores John Boorman’s ridiculous ‘Exorcist II: The Heretic’ to present itself as a direct sequel to the original film. Too bound up in provocative theology for the turbo-gore crowd, too tainted by the horror tag for serious movie fans, the film is stylistically similar to the original, but arrives as a far more entertaining package.\n\nIt was written and directed by William Peter Blatty, screenwriter for the classic ‘The Exorcist’ which was itself based on his bestselling book. The movie began life as a project designed to re-team Blatty with ‘The Exorcist’ director William Friedkin. Blatty initially resisted the idea, later revealing in the book ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’ that “Everybody wanted Exorcist III… I hadn’t written the script, but I had the story in my head.”\n\nBlatty’s initial concept was to produce a movie about demonic possession without repeating the ritual of the exorcism that formed the final act of the original film. But Friedkin disagreed with the direction Blatty wanted to move in, and the project faded into development hell.\n\nUnperturbed, Blatty developed his concept as a novel. Published in 1983 as ‘Legion’, the book was an instant bestseller, and by the end of the ‘80s he had fashioned it back into a screenplay. With studios such as Morgan Creek and Carolco now chasing the rights, Blatty chose to go with the former after executives at Carolco revealed they wanted him to change the storyline so that the daughter of the lead character becomes possessed. He refused, but Carolco still got their pound of flesh by producing the dire Leslie Nielson spoof, ‘Repossessed’, with Linda Blair in the central role.\n\nWith Morgan Creek putting up an $11m budget to realise Blatty’s vision, the writer/director sought respected actors who would be able to carry the story’s heavy themes of faith, friendship, belief and loss. The great George C. Scott agreed to star as Lieutenant Kinderman, the character played in the first film by the late Lee J. Cobb.\n\n“It’s a horror film and much more,” he told ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’. “It’s a real drama, intricately crafted, with offbeat interesting characters, and that’s what makes it genuinely frightening.”\n\nScott delivers a powerhouse performance as a man who has lost his faith in God after witnessing too much horror. When we first see him, he is standing on a riverside dock, examining the body of a young coloured boy who has been crucified on two rowing oars. The boy has been decapitated, his head swopped with one taken from a white plaster statue of Christ that has been done up in Al Johnson-style black face. As a final atrocity, ingots have been driven into the boy’s eyes.\n\n“Would a God who is ‘good’ invent something like death? I don’t buy it, Father. It’s not a winner.”\n\nJason Miller returns from starring in the original movie to play Patient X, a hospital inmate who could well be Father Karras resurrected, while Brad Dourif handles Patient X’s psychopathic alter ego, the Gemini Killer, and in doing so delivers the signature role of his long career.\n\nThe plot sees Georgetown plagued by murders identical to those carried out by James Venamun, AKA the Gemini Killer, a serial slayer who was electrocuted back in 1973. His execution took place around the same time that Father Karras was taking his final dive through Regan McNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nAs the bodies mount up, Kinderman realises that the victims are all connected to the Regan case. He discovers a nameless patient in the local hospital’s maximum security wing who looks exactly like the supposedly deceased Father Karras, but who claims to be the Gemini Killer.\n\nIt transpires that satanic intervention has caused the souls of both men to be entombed within the same body, as the Gemini Killer explains:\n\n“A certain matter of an exorcism, I think, in which your friend Father Karras expelled certain parties from the body of a child. Certain parties were not pleased, to say the least. The very least. And so, my friend, the master, he devised this petty scheme as a way of getting back, of creating a stumbling block, a scandal, a horror to the eyes of all men seeking faith, using the body of this saintly priest as an instrument of – well, you know. My work. But the main thing is the torment of your friend Father Karras as he watches while I rip and mutilate the innocent, his friends, and again, and again, on and on! He’s inside with us! He’ll never get away! His pain won’t end!… Gracious me, was I raving? Please forgive me; I’m mad.”\n\nEach death is prefigured by the presence of a blood-red rose displayed somewhere in the scene, a poetic visual touch that recalls the opening lines of dialogue. The murders themselves demonstrate a similar creative flair. A priest is attacked in his confessional box; injected with a drug that renders him passive but aware of all that is going on around him, he is messily decapitated. The killer carefully arranges the scene so that the dead priest remains sitting in the confessional, his severed head propped up in his lap for the next penitent parishioner to discover.\n\nFather Dyer, Karras’ friend from the first film and now a pal of Kinderman, is also targeted with the drug during a stay in the local hospital. Unable to resist, tubes are inserted into his heart and his entire blood supply is manually pumped out shortly after the two men watch ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ together at a cinema. The killer taunts Kinderman by leaving these very words written in blood above Father Dyer’s headless corpse.\n\nThe police are baffled when they discover that the culprit leaves a different set of fingerprints at every crime scene. Are they dealing with more than one murderer?\n\nThe film strikes an unsettling, disturbing tone that is maintained and enhanced even further by each of the murders. But the real showstopper, the one that scared the hell out of us all those years ago in that packed cinema auditorium, that one occurs at the hospital, late at night and in near total silence.\n\nBlatty’s set up is masterly: the camera remains static in a side corridor looking onto the hospital reception desk. It’s the graveyard shift, and a lone nurse chats with a bored policeman. All seems well.\n\nHearing noises from a side room, the nurse goes to check that the occupant is okay, first making sure that the policeman is still nearby. As she steps into the room, she doesn’t notice the policeman being called away by a colleague. The nurse is now alone.\n\nNothing happens for several beats. It’s a false scare; we start to relax as the nurse emerges from the room and heads back to her desk, and that’s when Blatty strikes.\n\nAs the nurse strides back to reception, the camera suddenly catapults forward, shattering the late night silence with a terrifyingly loud synthesised shriek as we see that right on the heels of the nurse is a shroud-wrapped figure brandishing a pair of surgical bone-clippers at her neck. A split-second later, it is over, and the scene quickly cuts to the discovery of the nurse’s body the next morning.\n\nThis simple set up is massively effective, and I still recall the wave of shock that washed over me when I experienced it for the first time back at the cinema. I remember the low burst of exhilarated chatter that broke out among the audience following this murder set piece, and when I looked around, I saw people digging themselves out of their seats and whispering ‘did you see that?’ to one another. The transition from static silence to synthetic scream really makes the scene work – had Blatty scored it more conventionally, the effect would have been far less impressive.\n\nThat’s the thing with ‘The Exorcist III’. It is one of the best examples I have ever found of how a director can combine fancy sound design with stark visuals to create unbearably tense horror.\n\nA case in point is the episode where Kinderman visits the local Jesuit university late at night. As he and the university president discuss the murders, a door creaks in an outer office. Kinderman turns in time to see a pile of papers lift in the breeze, as if someone has just walked past. Half-whispered Latin reaches our ears as Kinderman steps out to investigate.\n\nOn the landing outside, the lights flutter on and off. Harsh, murmured growls emanate low on the soundtrack. Kinderman looks around; in the flickering strobe, a distant statue of a Jesuit saint suddenly appears demonic and evil. Kinderman steps forward for a closer look, unsure of what he is seeing. The growls swell; someone approaches.\n\nAs the noise reaches a crescendo, Kinderman collides with the university president’s secretary. She screams, the lights return to normal, he apologises. She hurries on her way. Kinderman turns to look at the statue, which is utterly benign once more.\n\nSure, the payoff is a cheap shot equivalent of that cheesy cliché where a cat jumps out and spooks someone – but boy, does it work. Blatty pioneered the use of ‘vocal violence’ with this flick, and it’s a shame that it hasn’t been used as effectively in more genre offerings.\n\nKinderman realises that Patient X is possessing elderly residents of the catatonic ward and forcing them to commit the murders. When one victim-to-be, a priest called Father Kanavan, urges a charming little old lady to make a good confession, her response is chillingly delivered:\n\n“Seventeen of them, Father. The first was that waitress in Candlestick Park. I cut her throat and watched her bleed. She bled a great deal. It’s a problem I’m working on, Father. All this bleeding.”\n\nBlatty completed the film on time and only slightly over budget, but trouble occurred four months later when Morgan Creek suddenly realised that the director had delivered an Exorcist film without any exorcisms.\n\nThe original climax followed the ending of the book – with the Gemini Killer realising that the father he has sought to shame with his sickening acts of violence is finally dead, just as Kinderman shoots him in the head and brings the supernatural shenanigans to an end. Clips of this can still be seen in a trailer where Karras/the Gemini Killer/Patient X ‘morphs’ through a series of different faces.\n\nRather than let the studio bring somebody else in to make the required changes, Blatty opted to reshoot the ending himself. He introduced a new character at the eleventh hour – Father Morning, a priest who is briefly glimpsed in his room at the seminary as the evil entity that plagues Georgetown makes its presence felt. He then inexplicably turns up at the hospital to separate the two souls amid a fantastic battle of devilish special effects that cost an extra $4m to put on screen. It doesn’t make a great deal of sense, but fails to totally ruin the film as well. Blatty himself said of the new ending in ‘The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows’ that “It is all right, but is utterly unnecessary and changes the character of the piece.\n\n“The original story that I sold Morgan Creek, and that I shot, ended with Kinderman blowing away Patient X. There was no exorcism. But it was a Mexican stand-off between me and the studio.\n\n“I was entitled to one preview, then they could go and do what they wanted with the picture. They gave me a preview, but it was the lowest end preview audience I have ever seen in my life. They dragged in zombies from Haiti to watch this film! It was unbelievable. But I decided, better I should do it than anyone else.\n\n“I foolishly thought: I can do a good exorcism. I’ll turn this pig’s ear into a silk purse. So I did it.”\n\nThe cast sympathised with Blatty’s predicament.\n\n“We all felt really bad about it,” Brad Dourif told Blatty fan site theninthconfiguration.com. “But Blatty tried to do his best under very difficult circumstances. And I remember George C. Scott saying that the folks would only be satisfied if Madonna came out and sang a song at the end!”\n\nDourif elaborated on this to Fangoria magazine. “The original version was a hell of a lot purer,” he said. “I liked it much more.”\n\nBy the movie’s end, Father Morning is dead at the hands of the demon and Kinderman has rediscovered his faith: you cannot believe in the devil, he tells Patient X, without also believing in God:\n\n“I believe in death. I believe in disease. I believe in injustice and inhumanity, torture and anger and hate… I believe in murder. I believe in pain. I believe in cruelty and infidelity. I believe in slime and stink and every crawling, putrid thing… every possible ugliness and corruption, you son of a bitch! I believe… in you.”\n\nBlatty told Fangoria that when Patient X hisses “I must save my son, the Gemini,” at Kinderman in tones that recall the possessed voice that the late Mercedes McCambridge provided for the original film, this was intended to suggest the demonic entity, Pazuzu, is back holding the reins. This time, the demon’s voice was provided by an uncredited Colleen Dewhurst, an actress who was twice married to (and divorced from) George C. Scott in real life.\n\nPrior to the film’s opening across almost 1,300 screens in the USA, Blatty pleaded with the studio to call the film ‘Legion’ – a title which 20 years later has been used by another movie to depict a war between angels and demons.\n\n“I begged them when they were considering titles not to name it Exorcist anything, because ‘Exorcist II’ was a disaster beyond imagination,” he said. “You can’t call it ‘Exorcist III’ because people will shun the box office. But they went and named it ‘Exorcist III’, then they called me after the third week when we were beginning to fade at the box office and they said ‘We’ll tell you the reason, it’s gonna hurt, you’re not gonna like this – the reason is ‘Exorcist II’.’\n\n“I couldn’t believe it! They have total amnesia.”\n\nNevertheless, the movie made a respectable profit at the US box office – more than $26m – and has proven to be especially popular with rock and metal bands around the world.\n\nUS group Beyond sample the movie on the song ‘Limbless’ from their 1995 album ‘Reassemble’, and Canadian band Cryptopsy sample it for ‘Crown Of Horns’ off their ‘None So Vile’ album. Finnish metallers Children of Bodom top and tail the titular track from the ‘Fear The Reaper’ album, and thrash stalwarts Slayer based their song ‘Gemini’ on Brad Dourif’s character – it appears on the punk compilation, ‘Undisputed Attitude’.\n\nThe film is also apparently popular with serial killers – Jeffery Dahmer was reportedly watching it on video when police raided his charnel house of an apartment, and later claimed that it was his favourite movie.\n\nDespite the studio-imposed changes, Blatty remains proud of his achievements.\n\n“It’s still a superior film. And in my opinion, and excuse me if I utter heresy here, but for me, it’s a more frightening film than ‘The Exorcist’.”\n\nInterestingly, Blatty originally wanted to enlist John Carpenter as director, but as the man behind such classics as ‘Halloween’ and ‘The Thing’ later revealed in the book ‘John Carpenter: Prince of Darkness’, he shared the same problems with the plot that William Friedkin and the studio had expressed.\n\n“Blatty is a fabulous writer, and much of ‘The Exorcist III’ is brilliant,” Carpenter said. “But there was no exorcism in the third act.\n\n“I was ambivalent about the script, primarily because it didn’t have an exorcism… I kept suggesting a third-act exorcism and pushing the both of us to come up with some new, exciting and grotesque devil gags. Blatty was resistant, so I withdrew from ‘The Exorcist III’.”\n\nEven with the studio meddling, the finished film demonstrates that bringing in Carpenter wasn’t necessary. Blatty makes use of technology, directorial sleight-of-hand and solid old-fashioned acting to craft some truly scary chills, wrapping them in a satisfyingly intelligent and atmospheric horror movie that is crying out for a special edition DVD complete with excised (exorcised?) footage and more.\n\nThe director has tried for several years to locate the trimmed footage, which apparently includes an alternative opening where Kinderman views the dead body of Father Karras just after he has fallen from Regan MacNeil’s bedroom window.\n\nMorgan Creek claim to have lost the footage, but noted Exorcist expert Mark Kermode, who has described ‘The Exorcist III’ as “A restrained, haunting chiller which stimulates the adrenalin and intellect alike,” has insisted on his BBC blog that the search for the lost footage remains ongoing.\n\nSo here we are, two decades later. I’m still waiting for a director to step up to the plate and scare me as badly as Blatty did all those years ago. It hasn’t happened yet, and until it does, fans of ‘The Exorcist III’ will have to content themselves with dreams of a rose… and then of falling down a long flight of steps.\n\nBy Liam Ronan\n\nNight falls on a sleepy rural town in the American mid-west. It’s the kind of friendly, wholesome place where everybody knows everyone else – where freshly baked apple pies are left to cool on window sills and the residents can sleep easily in their beds knowing that their doors are unlocked. The darkened streets are deserted; people are either watching television at home or drinking beer in the lone bar that serves as a community hub. Inside, the patrons laugh, swop local gossip and listen to good ol’ boy shitkicker tunes on the well-worn juke box.\n\nThe music masks the sound of the autumn wind that blows through the empty streets outside, knocking garbage bins over and driving leaves and kerbside litter along in frenzied waves. Other than the flotsam, nothing else stirs in the breeze – nothing, that is, apart from a small girl who wakes and moves to her bedroom window, beckoned by a voice on the night wind that only she can hear – a voice that calls for vengeance…\n\nSuch are the sublime chills of ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’, an eerie made-for-television classic that has attracted a true cult following since it was first broadcast in America on October 24, 1981 as a CBS network Saturday Night Movie. Its recent region-free DVD and Blu Ray release by VCI marks the first time that this spine-tingling flick has been available on anything other than a faded video print or a bootleg DVD-R.\n\nMy first exposure to it came with a rare Channel Four broadcast in the mid-eighties, one that was the talk of the school playground and which made a lasting impression on those who were lucky enough to see it. The film certainly made an impact on me; some twenty years later, I placed a classified ad in the back of UK horror magazine ‘The Dark Side’ pleading for someone to sell me a copy of the much-sought after precert release. It was at this point that I realised what a following the film had as several letters from fellow fans duly arrived, only one of which actually offered to sell me the aforementioned video.\n\nThe advent of the internet made it easier to find out more about the film and talk to others who admired its many charms. I even went as far as speaking to Mark Morris of Nucleus Films about the possibility of acquiring the title for an Anchor Bay UK release. He told me that the rights were horribly tied up in litigation – at the time that we spoke, one of the film’s distributors was allegedly in the middle of a lengthy prison sentence and pretty much out of the loop. Happily, the rights have now been untangled and after years of waiting, VCI’s beautifully remastered print has arrived to do the film the justice it so richly deserves.\n\nWritten by JD Feigelson, the origin of ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ began on the set of ‘The Windsplitter’, a counter-culture biker movie that Feigelson wrote and directed and which featured actors and crew including the likes of Tobe Hooper, Kim Henkel, Jim Siedow and other people whose names would later be forever associated with ‘The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’. Feigelson and Hooper were bemoaning the lack of box office success for ‘The Windsplitter’ and came to realise that their next projects needed to make an impressive impact if they were to have any kind of career. We all know what Hooper went off and did – his iconic masterpiece has been well documented – but Feigelson set out to create an old-fashioned ghost story, and ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ was the result.\n\nAs a fan of ‘The Wizard of Oz’, Feigelson had always been impressed by the scarecrow character. It occurred to him that by its very nature, a scarecrow was intended to instil a sense of fear, and that while vampires, werewolves, zombies and mummies had been seen a hundred times, no one had ever thought of presenting a scarecrow as the villain of a horror movie. Feigelson started tossing ideas around for how he could base a film around the concept of a killer scarecrow, and found inspiration from a famous source – venerated science fiction author Ray Bradbury, whom he had befriended and who was now offering to provide helpful notes on each draft of the script. His input was both valuable and comprehensive; many months and eight drafts later, Bradbury told Feigelson that there was nothing else they could add, and that the script was finally finished.\n\nOriginally intending to do the film as an independent feature, Feigelson experienced a lot of difficulty raising the necessary funds. The era of the splatter movie was in full flow; the gory likes of ‘Friday The 13th’, ‘The Burning’ and ‘The Prowler’ were all scoring well at the box-office, but Feigelson was determined not to resort to such crude methods for his film – his interest lay not in revolting viewers, but in providing genuine, traditional chills. That said, his script for ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ still featured several outlandish death scenes, at least one of which was as horrible as anything the slasher genre could throw up.\n\nFeigelson was still struggling to find backers when the CBS network took a look at the script. At first they turned it down without even reading it, but Feigelson persevered and sent it back to a contact that he had established at the network, asking them to take another look. This time he struck gold; the network executives loved it, and expressed interest in acquiring the project. Given his dislike of gore effects, Feigelson reasoned that if done properly, the script would be ideal for a television audience. After all, its focus was firmly set on establishing fear, suspense and dread anticipation. He agreed, and CBS moved the project into production in time for a Halloween slot.\n\nFeigelson may have gone on record with his dislike of gore scenes, but given the horrible fates that the film’s villains suffer, ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ is still a surprisingly bloodless affair, even when you take into account that it was produced for television. Many fans have wondered if Feigelson was forced to tone down his vision, or if the film had suffered from any network censorship. But Feigelson has stated that the script was filmed just as he had written it, and that the network required only minor dialogue changes – they were otherwise happy with the content.\n\nProduction took place over a fast 17 day shoot in a little town just outside Los Angeles amid a searing heatwave (one day was lost due to a fire on the set). Director Frank De Felitta was better known as the author of such books as ‘Audrey Rose’ and ‘The Entity’, and his background as a writer meant that he was in full compliance with Feigelson’s creative vision and approach to the material. Resolutely loyal to the script, he also insisted on shooting the movie as if it was a big-screen feature, with lots of wide, open shots and sweeping crane movements that made the most of the beautiful location and raised the quality of the film several notches.\n\n‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ sets out its agenda with an unsettling title sequence which makes effective use of Glenn Paxton’s creepy score to set up the rural setting. Amid the rolling hills and golden fields of an isolated farming community, eight-year-old Marylee is playing innocently with her best friend, Bubba Ritter – a 36 year old mentally challenged man with the mind of a young boy. There is no doubt that the girl is the leader in their relationship, but Bubba is more than just a friend . As we will come to see, he is Marylee’s protector, too.\n\nMarylee presents Bubba with a woven garland of wild flowers that she has made for him, but she’ll only hand it over if he consents to a peck on the cheek in keeping with the Hawaiian ritual she has just told him about. Bubba isn’t keen, but he reluctantly agrees so he can wear the pretty garland.\n\nMarylee: “Look, Bubba. Isn’t it beautiful?”\n\nBubba: “Beau-tee-fulll…”\n\nLarry Drake was an inspired choice to play Bubba. A talented actor who would later go on to play lead villains in the likes of ‘Dr Giggles’ and ‘Darkman’, his unique features gave his ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ character an edge in being just different enough to stand out and catch the attention of town bullies (these same features made him the ideal candidate for playing a psychopathic Santa Claus in the classic Tales From The Crypt episode, ‘And All Through The House’). Drake’s memorable turn as Bubba Ritter also earned him a recurring role playing Benny, another mentally challenged character, on the long-running television show, ‘LA Law’. De Felitta has said Drake’s portrayal of Bubba was so convincing, fans have consistently enquired if the actor was genuinely mentally disabled when he made the film.\n\nSimilarly, Tonya Crowe puts in a fantastic performance as young Marylee. Best known for starring in the soap opera ‘Knot’s Landing’, her role here calls for her to run through an entire range of emotions, sometimes playing it innocent, other times suggesting that she knows more about what is going on than anyone else. Her natural, understated performance is a major part of why the film succeeds.\n\n“Oh Bubba, look what you did!”\n\nUnbeknown to either Bubba or Marylee, they are being secretly watched by Otis T. Hazelrigg, the town’s postmaster. Described by Feigelson as a ‘serpent in the garden of Eden’, Otis is played by the legendary character actor, Charles Durning. A former professional boxer and decorated war veteran (he survived both D-Day and the infamous massacre of American POWs by SS troops at Malmedy in Belgium), Durning brought his trademark slow-burn intensity to the role, which he took over after Strother Martin passed away. Durning portrays Otis as a pompous, angry, chubby little man who feels robbed of his chance for glory in life, and who parades around town with an air of irreproachable superiority. Otis is a bully, a liar and a bigot. He drinks secretly in his room at the boarding house while proudly reminding the townsfolk that he is tee-total, and wears his postmaster’s outfit – which includes a silly looking pith-helmet – even when he is off duty, as if it is the uniform of some military authority rather than a frustrated civil servant eager to drain his lowly position for every drop of so-called power.\n\nAs he watches Bubba and Marylee play through his binoculars, Otis seethes inwardly, inexplicably furious even as the pair get up and head back to town with their garlands hanging from their necks, singing a childish song together.\n\n“He out there again. And he’s got the Williams girl.”\n\nOtis visits his farmer buddy, Harless, a beer-swilling redneck who is played by the late great Lane Smith, famous for his role as editor Perry White in the long-running ‘The New Adventures Of Superman’. Harless is all for administering yet another punishment beating to Bubba there and then, but Otis confuses the farmer by telling him that there is no point – the ‘idiot’ would only go and forget why they were beating him.\n\n“It was your idea he’s dangerous in the first place! You’re the one who always wants to run down there and rub his face in the dirt.”\n\nOtis and Harless’ views on Bubba are shared by corpulent local businessman Philby, who runs an animal feed plant (and is played by Claude Earl Jones, the bullying coach who lost his head to Clint Howard in ‘Evilspeak’), and garage grease monkey Skeeter (TV regular Robert Lyons), the runt of the group – a dumb, weasely little man who constantly defers to the town postmaster and calls him ‘Mr. Otis’. The four men just can’t accept that Bubba has the emotional and mental capacity of a particularly dense child – all they see is a grown man who cavorts with children in an unwholesome manner. It’s only a matter of time, they reason, before Bubba abuses his playmates. As their self-appointed leader, Otis ensures that the men share his curiously personal hatred of Bubba.\n\n“He’s a blight – like stinkweed and cutworm that you spray and spray to get rid of, but always keeps coming back. No, I haven’t changed my mind – something’s got to be done. But it has to be permanent.”\n\nHarless makes it clear that while he is happy to ‘have a little fun’, he’ll draw the line at actually murdering the man. Otis is a master manipulator, though, and coerces Harless into admitting that he would be willing to take it further in the event that Bubba Ritter actually harmed a child.\n\nLittle does he know that moment is only hours away. As Bubba and his pal wander past the rear fence of a particularly well-kept garden, Marylee spies the homeowner’s collection of comical garden gnomes, and suggests that they squeeze through the fence for a closer look. But Bubba has learned from bitter experience, and refuses.\n\n“Bubba can’t go in yards. He’ll get in trouble.”\n\nMarylee slips through to play with the gnomes while Bubba watches through a gap in the fence. Her fun is cut short when the household’s vicious dog appears. After a tense stand-off, the animal bounds forward and starts savaging the little girl. As Marylee screams for help, Bubba smashes his way through the fence and runs to her aid. Saving her from being mauled to death, he cradles his friend in his arms and rushes to her home where her mother finds him standing on the porch with Marylee’s blood-stained, unconscious body, sheer fear etched across his tear-stained face.\n\n“Bubba didn’t do it!”\n\nPanicked by the woman’s screams, a terrified Bubba runs home to the isolated farmstead where he lives with his mother. With no one to tell the town what really happened, the gossips soon get to work. As word reaches Harless, he tears over to the post office in his flat-bed truck and rushes in to tell his buddy the news.\n\nHarless: “It’s happened! Bubba Ritter – he’s done it. Just like you said.”\n\nOtis: “How bad?”\n\nHarless: “She’s dead, Otis!”\n\nThe sheriff is calling for volunteers to assemble for a co-ordinated search, but Otis announces that he, Harless, Philby and Skeeter will go after Bubba alone. Pausing only to close up the shop and retrieve their guns, the pair head over to collect their partners in mob justice, Otis standing in the back of Harless’ truck like some kind of imperious general as the farmer races across town. The look of sheer pleasure on Philby’s face as he climbs up alongside Otis lets viewers know that the men have been anticipating this moment for a long, long time, and intend to make the most of the opportunity.\n\nOnce Skeeter has loaded his hunting dogs into the truck, they set about chasing Bubba down. Hearing the dogs’ howls, the terror-stricken man scrambles through thick undergrowth and splashes across streams. Knowing that he has managed to give them the slip before by seemingly vanishing across Mrs. Ritter’s cornfields, the gang try to head him off. But Bubba manages to make it there just ahead of them. Seeing the cuts and bruises on her son’s flesh as the baying of the hounds gets closer, Mrs. Ritter tells her son that it’s time to outwit his tormentors once more.\n\n“You remember what we did the last time? We played the game – the Hiding Game, remember?”\n\nWhen the posse arrive, Mrs. Ritter is ready for them. Otis wastes no time in telling her that Bubba has ‘killed’ a girl, and punishment is due; the men are here on official business. But she just laughs and mocks the pompous little man.\n\n“Who do you think you are? The only thing official you’ve ever done is lick stamps! Now get off my property!”\n\nAngry at losing face in front of his friends and unable to force the old woman into giving up her son, Otis scans the surrounding fields, reasoning that Bubba must be hiding somewhere nearby. Noticing that the dogs are straining at their leads to get into the corn field, the posse take a closer look. But the only thing to be seen for miles around is a solitary scarecrow, loosely tied to a simple wooden cross. Approaching the bedraggled form, Otis is shocked to see wet, scared human eyes staring back at him from beneath the scarecrow’s cloth-sack mask – Bubba’s hiding place has been discovered. The Hiding Game may have worked before, but this time, Bubba has lost, and as the men level their guns and look to Otis for their lead, we can see that they are visibly shaken at having arrived at this point – Skeeter has already wondered aloud about what they will actually do once they catch Bubba. Now, that moment has arrived. As Otis takes aim, we see how badly his hand is shaking. Could he be having second thoughts?\n\n“Bubba didn’t do it…”\n\nAs Bubba pleads with his tormentors, an unseen crow calls out. Its sharp, mocking cries startle Otis into pulling the trigger of his gun, and the posse follow his lead. They pump 21 bullets into Bubba’s convulsing body; unable to fall because of the ropes suspending him from the cross, he jerks, shudders, and finally dies where he stands. As the men gather around the corpse, silently contemplating the ‘justice’ that they have delivered – Philby certainly doesn’t look like he is having a good time anymore – a call comes through on Harless’ CB radio (the voice is provided by Feigelson himself).\n\n“Haven’t you heard? Little girl’s all right. It was all a mistake. Hank Renfro’s dog jumped her… funny thing is, Ol’ Bubba saved her life. Ain’t that a laugh?”\n\nAs the realisation that they have murdered an innocent man hits them, it is telling that Otis’ first thoughts are not of the terrible mistake they have made, but of how he can get himself out of trouble and remain respectable in the eyes of the community. Taking a pitchfork from the truck, Otis props it up against Bubba’s limp form, framing him so that they can argue they were forced to fire in self-defence. No sooner has he done this than a strange wind blows up out of nowhere; the men shield their eyes as the scarecrow starts bobbing in the wind and raining bits of straw upon them while their hounds cry out in unease.\n\nIt’s the first time that the film hints at a supernatural undertone, and the execution scene and its aftermath are all the more effective for the simple, mater-of-fact way in which De Felitta handles the action. It’s also the first time that we get to see the titular scarecrow, and its all-important design is as straightforward as it is menacing – a cloth-sack head, a thick overcoat, rough shirt, heavy gloves, jeans and some carefully applied straw, plus a few ropes to suggest how the whole thing is held together. It was designed by Feigelson himself with the help of some colleagues at the commercial studio where he worked in Houston, and has proven to be a memorable image as evidenced by the succession of t-shirts, posters, screensavers and masks that have been produced in the years since the film was broadcast.\n\n“They’re vigilantes. Anyone who doesn’t understand that is either blind or incompetent.”\n\nFollowing Bubba’s execution at the hands of the mob, the subsequent court case is a farce. Without any witnesses, the judge accepts that the posse were simply defending themselves from someone who had gone to great lengths to conceal himself, and who was displaying all the characteristics of one who was guilty of a crime. Mrs. Ritter and Sam, the prosecuting attorney, are appalled. Sam has to begrudgingly accept the findings of the court, but Mrs. Ritter isn’t quite as forgiving, and publically berates the men for what they have done and the way they have covered up their crime, promising that one way or another, they will pay.\n\n“You may think that you’re getting off free, but there’s other justice in this world besides the law!”\n\nJocelyn Brando’s turn as Mrs. Ritter is a memorable highlight of ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’. Whether she is comforting her bewildered son or squaring up to an armed mob, Brando – the sister of megastar Marlon – gives it her all. The warning she delivers to the posse as she is dragged out of the courtroom has resonated with fans, and both Feigelson and De Felitta have described how they have heard it quoted back at them over the years.\n\n“If I ever find a single shred of evidence, I’ll see every one of you on death row.”\n\nAs his fellow townsfolk congratulate him outside the court, Otis is confronted by Sam, who promises that the investigation is not over. Otis displays his contempt for the attorney, Mrs. Ritter and the small matter of having killed an innocent man by wondering aloud if he still has time to get back to the boarding house for the evening meal. This segues into a scene of Harless, Philby and Skeeter celebrating their freedom in the town bar, which in turn moves into a wonderfully eerie shot of the empty streets being plagued by a powerful windstorm, another subtle suggestion that while life in the rural community has returned to its sedate, leisurely pace, something supernatural is now hanging over the town.\n\n“Where’s Bubba? What’s happened to Bubba?”\n\nSince the dog attack, Marylee has been recovering at home in bed. She doesn’t know that Bubba is dead – her parents have decided to wait until she makes a full recovery before telling her the bad news. But her love for her friend is so strong, she slips out of her bedroom window at night and limps off across the fields to the Ritter farm where the old woman finds her sitting in the cornfield at the exact spot where Bubba died, happily making floral garlands and singing the songs they used to enjoy. As Mrs. Ritter breaks the news to her that Bubba is gone, the child chastises her.\n\n“Don’t worry, Mrs Ritter. Bubba’s not gone. He’s just playing the Hiding Game.”\n\nIt’s a chilling scene, simply constructed and delivered. Marylee’s innocence shines through, and the double-edged dialogue allows you just enough room to wonder if the child really is ignorant of her friend’s death, or if there is a genuine supernatural aspect to consider – perhaps the little girl’s love for her dead friend has drawn his spirit back from the void? This allows Feigelson and De Felitta to start cranking up the chills and set up what is perhaps the film’s most talked-about sequence.\n\nIt begins in a deceptively idyllic manner as Harless’ wife makes small talk with the farmer while he cleans the teeth of his woodchipper. Looking off into the distance, she casually asks her husband if he has started planting crops so late in the season. Harless berates her for asking such a ‘lame brain’ question, but her response sends shivers down his spine.\n\n“If you’re not planting, why would you put up a scarecrow?”\n\nHarless looks up to see that his wife is right – standing in the middle of an otherwise empty field is a bedraggled-looking scarecrow. Stuffed with straw, it could almost be the same one that Bubba Ritter hid inside when he was killed. It even has the holes in the clothing where the posse pumped him full of bullets…\n\nRattled, Harless confronts Philby and Skeeter, but when they promise him that they didn’t plant it there as some kind of joke, the three men head over to the boarding house to see Otis. The postmaster’s lair is revealed to be decorated with photographs of Patton, rifles, shell casings, American flags and busts of historical military figures – a subtle touch which gives us a further insight into his character.\n\n“Somebody knows, Otis.”\n\nOtis is quick to dismiss the men’s fears, and suggests that Sam the attorney planted the scarecrow in an attempt to shake them up. He warns the men not to give anything away, berates them for embarrassing him in front of the other guests, and orders them to leave. A chastised Harless heads back home where the evening air is filled with the music of cicadas (the sound of which Feigelson travelled down to Texas to record during postproduction). As the sun disappears behind the distant hills, he decides to take another look at the scarecrow, but it is gone – all that is left is the cross on which it once hung.\n\nAs Harless wonders why anyone would remove the scarecrow but leave the poles behind, he hears the unmistakeable roar of his woodchipper starting up in the barn. Believing that Sam must be snooping around, he enters the shadowy building, flicks on the overhead lights and switches the machine off. Noticing dust and bits of straw falling from the hayloft, Harless arms himself with a sickle and climbs up to confront the intruder. Perched precariously at the edge of the loft, Harless searches its dark recesses, but it appears to be empty.\n\nSuddenly, the woodchipper below roars back into life, startling him. Losing his balance, Harless falls. Clinging desperately to a cable and screaming for help, the farmer is bathed in a shower of sparks as the light gives way, and he plunges directly into the rotating maw of the machine. The camera remains fixed on the barn light, but we hear the gears of the woodchipper strain and shriek as Harless is fed through its metal teeth. As a payoff to this spectacularly gruesome demise, De Felitta shock-cuts to a spoonful of blood-red strawberry jam hitting Otis’ breakfast plate over at the boarding house the following morning – an inspired and blackly comical touch which had the audience alternatively shrieking with terror and laughing in relief when the film was originally screened for the writer’s guild.\n\nHarless’ horrific death has Philby and Skeeter running scared. They are convinced that someone is punishing them for what they did to Bubba Ritter, and that more deaths will follow. Otis does his best to placate his troops, but even he can’t explain why, when Harless’ pulped remains were found, the woodchipper was no longer running. Philby thinks that somebody turned the machine off after it had processed the farmer’s body, then left and shut the barn door behind them. But who?\n\n“What you sow, so shall you reap.”\n\nOtis’ rounds take him out to Mrs. Ritter’s farm. Not one to waste an opportunity, he mocks the old woman, then, remembering what she said at the trial, casually threatens her with a warning to ‘let it lie’. Bad move; Mrs. Ritter isn’t scared of Otis, and she promptly tells him that she knows his big, bad secret.\n\n“You don’t fool me, Hazelrigg, not for a minute. I’ve seen how you look at that little girl… you may think you’ve got the rest of them fooled, but I know exactly what you are!”\n\nHer words hit Otis like a hammer to the head. Visibly shocked, he climbs into his van without another word and drives off as the old woman yells at him to stay away from Marylee.\n\nIt’s a brilliant development in an outstanding film, one that adds new layers and spurs fresh dynamics into life. The revelation that Otis is a paedophile offers an explanation for the rage that we saw him display while spying on Marylee and Bubba in the opening scenes. Much of Otis’ hatred for Bubba has been spurred on by his jealousy of the special, innocent relationship between the man and the little girl, and of the unrestricted access and trust that he enjoyed.\n\nOtis’ pederastic nature is also a natural development of the insights that Feigelson and De Felitta have given us into the man’s character – a repressed, secretive bachelor who lives alone in a room filled with items that represent power over other people; a middle-aged misfit who manipulates those around him, who desperately wants to be in charge of all that he surveys, and who cannot bear to be denied or questioned. No wonder such a man would lust after a child – how much easier would it be to control a minor instead of an adult who might have expectations and desires of their own?\n\n“I know what you did to Bubba.”\n\nThe exchange between Mrs. Ritter and Otis leads into another memorable scene where Philby is locking up his business as the sun sets. Surveying his little empire, he pauses with fright, then breaks into a stumbling run that takes him out into the surrounding fields, where he eventually falls to his knees before the same straw-filled scarecrow that Harless reported seeing before he died. Again, the wind picks up, and we get a very strong sense that something supernatural is behind all the mayhem.\n\nThe action switches from here to the town’s annual Halloween dance where Marylee and the other local children are playing hide and seek. Otis confronts her in a deserted corridor, making sure that the other adults at the dance cannot see. With the revelation that he has a sexual interest in the girl, we are now forced to view his leering, smug air of authority with fresh eyes. The look that he gives Marylee after finding her alone is loaded with lust, power and desire; if any further proof were needed, it lets us know for sure that the man is a monster. Otis does his best to manipulate the little girl into revealing if she knows who has been behind the trouble, but Marylee is having none of it.\n\nOtis: “Bubba didn’t tell you anything! Bubba’s dead!”\n\nMarylee: “I know.”\n\nThe girl runs away and Otis follows, only to be confronted by a suspicious police deputy who makes sure the postmaster returns to the dance. Sneaking a glass of alcoholic punch to settle his nerves, he is confronted by Philby and Skeeter, who tell him about the appearance of the scarecrow at the feed plant. Terrified that they are going to go the same way as Harless, the pair are on the verge of revealing the truth about what they did to Bubba Ritter. Philby lays it on the line for Otis, who is rapidly losing control of the situation.\n\n“Now you listen to me, Otis, and you listen good. You got me into this. Now you just think of something to get me out, quick! Or I’m going in.”\n\nFaced with such an ultimatum, a by-now desperate Otis does the only thing he can think of – he goes back to Mrs. Ritter’s place to put the frighteners on her in the hope that he can scare the old woman into stopping the vendetta, or at least make her reveal who the culprit is. But he is a little too successful, and ends up triggering a fatal heart attack when he unexpectedly rises up from behind her rocking chair to clasp his hand over her mouth – a highly effective scare that has taken more than one viewer by surprise.\n\nWith the blood of two people now on his hands, Otis has to think fast. He snuffs out the pilot light on the kitchen stove and creates a huge explosion to hide the evidence of his latest crime (the house explosion was the very last shot of the movie, filmed once the production were certain that they had got all the footage they needed). The following day, Sam the attorney is one of the first on the scene, and he pours over the wreckage in search of clues that might suggest the explosion was anything other than an accident. Could he be the one who is hounding the posse?\n\nRay: “We went over it pretty close, Sam. Looking for anything special?”\n\nSam: “Just one shred…”\n\nPhilby is working late at the feed plant when his herd of pigs suddenly start squealing in distress (the real reason was that the crew were poking them with sticks to achieve the desired effect). Rattled, he goes out to investigate and hears a strange banging noise. Steeling himself for a confrontation with his tormentor, the big man is relieved when he discovers that a chain on the grain silo has worked itself loose. Chuckling at his own nervousness, he heads back to his office – only to see a shadowy figure waiting inside as the lights die. Philby runs for his car, but the engine won’t work. As the sound of approaching footsteps cut through the dark night air, Philby panics, and heads to the only place he can think of – the grain silo. Locking himself inside, Philby waits until the footsteps have moved away, then tries to leave. He can’t – the silo door won’t open.\n\nFamiliar mechanical noises reach his ears, and Philby realises with horror that the conveyor belt which feeds the silo has been turned on. Seconds later, a column of corn starts to pour into the silo, filling it with choking dust and burying the unfortunate Philby alive. After several moments, all that can be seen of the man is his twitching arm reaching up out of the corn; it shudders once, then goes still as Philby suffocates to death.\n\nAs memorable and as fiendishly awful as Harless’ messy death in the woodchipper was, the farmer’s demise was also a convoluted affair. By comparison, Philby’s slow death in the grain silo is genuinely disturbing. Feigelson wrote it into the script after growing up with childhood stories about the various mishaps that farmers had suffered in similar silos, and De Felitta had a special set constructed so he could do the scene justice. The producers of the Harrison Ford flick, ‘Witness’, must have also been paying attention when they staged an almost identical setpiece at the climax of their award-winning film.\n\n“It’s him. It’s always been him.”\n\nOtis can no longer insist that the deaths were accidental. He tells Skeeter that since Marylee revealed Bubba had told her what the posse did, it must mean that Bubba Ritter survived the shooting, and is now taking his revenge. Otis may still believe that the man is a social menace capable of planning such a murderous campaign, but a sceptical Skeeter wants to go to the police. Instead, Otis persuades him to take a trip out to the cemetery where they dig up Bubba’s coffin (where a glimpse of his headstone reveals that his actual name is Charles). If, as Otis suspects, the box is empty, it will prove without a doubt that Bubba is alive and well, and is behind the killings. But as Skeeter points out, what if his body is actually inside the coffin?\n\n“If he’s in there, that don’t leave nobody but his spirit.”\n\nThe two men go ahead and dig up the coffin, and sure enough, Bubba’s dead body is rotting away down there (not that we see it – this is a television movie, after all). A hysterical Skeeter tries to flee as an increasingly desperate Otis announces that the culprit must be the little girl, Marylee. Even Skeeter can see that Otis is clutching at straws, and he tells the postmaster that he wants nothing to do with another murder. Otis’ sphere of influence is now so small, he can’t even bend Skeeter to his will. Finally conceding defeat, he promises to accompany Skeeter to the sheriff’s office just as soon as they have filled the grave back in.\n\nAs Skeeter waxes lyrical about fleeing to his brother’s home in the woods, Otis kills the last friend he has left by striking the mechanic over the head with a shovel. In an unusual case of a producer actually improving a film by telling the director what to do, the scene is made memorable by the fact that Skeeter’s grimy hat becomes glued to the blade of the shovel, held in place by the sticky blood that has presumably erupted from his shattered skull – a clever move that sidesteps the need to actually see any gore. Burying Skeeter’s corpse in Bubba’s grave, Otis drives off into the night, his mind working on what he should do next, and how he can deal with Marylee.\n\nSo not only is Otis a liar, he’s a multiple murderer and a paedophile who has killed an elderly woman and her son, desecrated the man’s grave and is now considering the best way to snuff out a young child… he could well be the greatest television villain of the 1980s, and as he drives away, viewers are surely thinking that it is high time he paid his dues. They needn’t worry – Otis is about to keep his appointment with the scarecrow.\n\nThe postmaster’s van is deep in the dark night of the countryside when its headlights reveal a ghostly-looking apparition. Marylee is standing in the middle of the road wearing a long, white gown. She makes no attempt to get out of the way, and appears to have been waiting for Otis to come along. When she suddenly runs off into the fields, Otis tries to follow, but loses control of the van. As he recovers from the crash, Otis looks up to see Marylee standing just a few yards away, cloaked in the clouds of steam that are escaping from the hood of the ruined vehicle. She observes him in silence, then turns and runs deeper into the fields. The girl is obviously baiting the man and leading him somewhere, but it never once occurs to the control-freak Otis that he himself could be the one that is being manipulated.\n\n“You! It was you!”\n\nAppropriately enough for a movie that was broadcast at Halloween, the climax of the film takes place in a vast field full of pumpkins (given that it was filmed in the height of summer, the production had to ship the pumpkins in especially for the scene). Otis searches for Marylee and finds her hiding in the enormous blade of a huge harvesting machine. Pouncing on the little girl, Otis loses all sense of restraint. Forcing her to the floor, he sets about brutalising the child, screaming into her face and blaming her for the deaths of his friends. But they are not alone on this dark night…\n\n“It was her, Sam! It was her all the time!”\n\nOtis’ assault is curtailed when the headlights of the harvester power up and bathe him in light. Whirling around, the postmaster can only stare in surprise as Marylee scrambles out of the way. The machine’s engine roars into life, and the rig starts rolling towards him. Unable to see into its darkened cab, Otis surmises that Sam the attorney must be driving it, and he starts to back away while offering garbled excuses, again blaming Marylee as the culprit.\n\nA short, scary setpiece begins as Otis is hounded through the furrows of the pumpkin field, chased by the snapping blades of the harvester. In case we need reminding what is at stake, we see the machine’s carving plough at work as it messily churns up the pumpkins. Durning insisted on doing all of his own stunts for these scenes, including the crashing of his post van, and the extra risk paid off wonderfully – you can see that he really is stumbling along before those wicked looking blades, and that one wrong step could result in some serious damage for the actor.\n\nJust as Bubba fled before his pursuers, so too does a terrified Otis. His flight across the pumpkin field is brought to an abrupt end when he suddenly runs slap bang into the inanimate scarecrow, now clutching a pitchfork. As Otis grunts strangely, we hear a slick, piercing sound. He staggers backward several steps, wheezing hoarsely as the harvester behind him idles and remains still. Looking down, Otis sees that the prongs of the pitchfork are dripping with blood, and that huge red stains are rapidly spreading across his shirt. He clutches both hands over the wounds and sinks to his knees as blood bubbles out of his mouth and nose.\n\nOtis stares up at the scarecrow, perhaps appreciating the irony – after all, he used the same pitchfork to frame Bubba, and has now been mortally wounded upon it. Finally realising the identity of his tormentor, Otis raises an accusing finger, and points at the scarecrow in a gesture which requires no words. With that, Otis topples forward, dead at the scarecrow’s feet. The engine of the harvester stalls and its lights flicker and die. There is only the mocking call of a crow that echoes across the field as this long, dark night draws to an end…\n\n…almost.\n\nMarylee has seen nothing of Otis’ fate. She is hiding next to a large pumpkin, waiting for the night’s events to reach their conclusion. Hearing the soft crunch of approaching footsteps, the little girl reacts with trepidation – is she still in danger? De Felitta builds towards the final reveal as Marylee looks up and smiles at the figure standing over her: it’s the straw-filled scarecrow, now home to the spirit of Bubba Ritter. No longer as innocent as he was in life, Bubba has become something more malevolent and vindictive in death, and is encased within the body of the scarecrow in which he died.\n\nTurning to look at Marylee, the scarecrow holds out its gloved hand and offers the little girl a gift – a freshly picked wild flower. The camera freezes as her tiny hand reaches out to accept it, and we hear Marylee’s parting words as spoken to her ghostly guardian – words which could very well be double-edged, and which may just offer a revealing glimpse into the role that she has played in the entire affair.\n\n“Thank you, Bubba. You know what? Tomorrow, I think I’ll teach you a new game…”\n\nEven with the supernatural revelations laid bare, Feigelson and De Felitta have been consistently asked who was driving the harvester. The pair thought that they had made it clear that ‘paranormal influence’ was controlling the machine, but for the release and restoration of the VCI disc, a brief snippet of new, additional footage was commissioned that shows the gears of the empty, driverless harvester being manipulated by invisible forces.\n\nReaction to the film was strong, and it has gone on to earn a number of high profile admirers and fans since its initial broadcast. No less a personality than Vincent Price remarked during an interview how much he loved the film – he called it “Mar-vel-ous! I was terrified!” Ray Bradbury and Stuart ‘Reanimator’ Gordon have joined him in heaping praise upon ‘Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, calling it “Terrific script… terrific film!” and ”Scary as hell!” respectively.\n\n‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ is unique in that it was the very first in a glut of scarecrow movies. ‘Scarecrow Slayer’, ‘Dark Harvest’, ‘Night of the Scarecrow’, Scarecrows Rising’, ‘Psycho Scarecrow’, ‘Hallowed Ground’, ‘Husk’… probably the next best scarecrow movie after ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ is Bill Wesley’s ‘Scarecrows’, a low-budget 1988 horror flick which plays heavily on the ambiguous nature of Feigelson and De Felitta’s work.\n\nGiven that this is the era of remakes, Feigelson has confirmed that he has received several enquiries from producers interested in acquiring the rights to the movie, but has also indicated that he would remain removed from such a project, and would only allow a remake to go ahead if he was paid ‘a lot of money’.\n\nAs a consequence of the successful DVD release of the film, VCI issued a Blu Ray special edition in time for Halloween 2011 featuring more bonus material, some of it specially sourced in direct response to requests from fans, and 2M1 Records have issued Glenn Paxton’s memorable score in a digital format with downloadable sleeve art for the first time.\n\nWith its intense scenes of suspense, undeniably clever storyline, first-rate acting, eerie atmosphere and bone-chilling premise, it’s easy to see why ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’ is so fondly remembered.\n\nIt’s the sort of film that lingers long in the memory, and keeps you awake at night thinking about its potential ramifications.\n\nWas Mrs. Ritter some kind of backwoods witch? How ‘innocent’ was Marylee? Did Sam have a hand in any of the deaths? What other crimes has Otis covered up over the years? Will the ghostly Bubba still be with Marylee even after she has grown up?\n\nAnd what kind of God would send a sweet-natured, gentle man back from the dead with the ability to commit such horrendous acts of violence?\n\nBy the end of ‘Dark Night of the Scarecrow’, there’s only one thing that we can be sure of: Bubba really did do it."
