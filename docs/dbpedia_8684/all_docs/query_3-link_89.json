        "text": "Click on the link here for Audio Player – Day At Night: Colleen Dewhurst Interview – July 7, 1974 – Gordon Skene Sound Collection\n\nIf someone were to ask me who my favorite Broadway Actor was, and who one of my favorite actors of all-time were, I would answer Colleen Dewhurst without taking a beat.\n\nAlthough she did a considerable amount of work in TV and film (she played Murphy Brown‘s mother in that series and Annie Hall‘s Mother and a lot of others), her work on the stage was incredible and transformational. Some forty years later, I still remember seeing her and Jason Robards in A Moon For The Misbegotten, and in 1976 saw her again opposite Ben Gazzarra in the Bicentennial production of Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? – it was the first time I saw that milestone Albee play interpreted with warmth and the most subtle of dark humor. It changed my way of thinking about every other production I had seen of that play. And it made me a Colleen Dewhurst fan for life.\n\nSo, to give you some idea of who the person behind the staggering interpretations was, I unearthed this 1974 interview with Colleen Dewhurst, conducted by James Day as part of the Day At Night series. It was originally broadcast on July 4, 1974.\n\nI keep looking – She hasn’t been replaced. Hers was a very high bar.\n\nRelated articles\n\nColleen Dewhurst – Style Icon"
