        "text": "Her companion for nearly twenty years was Ken Marsolais, an independent producer who mounted such shows as \"Ned and Jack\" (which Dewhurst directed both off and on Broadway). He and Dewhurst met when he was brought in as assistant stage manager on \"A Moon for the Misbegotten\" in 1973.\n\nIn 1990, as president of Equity, she became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether actor Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of \"Miss Saigon\" when the show opened on Broadway. The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award as best actor in a musical. In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, she was widely criticized for her statement and her stand.\n\nWon two Tony Awards: in 1961, as Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic) for \"All the Way Home\" and in 1974, as Best Actress (Dramatic) for \"A Moon for the Misbegotten.\" She also received six other Tony nominations: as Best Actress (Dramatic), in 1962 for \"Great Day in the Morning,\" in 1964 for \"The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,\" in 1968 for \"More Stately Mansions,\" in 1972 for \"All Over,\" and in 1973 for \"Mourning Becomes Electra,\" and as Best Actress (Play), in 1977 for \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"."
