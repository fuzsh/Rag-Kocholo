        "text": "The actor burst onto the horror scene in 1984 playing the iconic serial killer Freddy Krueger in the horror classic, A Nightmare on Elm Street. But that's not the only time Englund visited Elm Street. He reprised the role for seven more sequels, as well as a television series, Freddy's Nightmares. Aside from playing the iconic pop culture horror figure, he's starred in a number of other films, including Urban Legend, Wishmaster, and 2001 Maniacs.\n\nEven though Pazuzu only flashes on the screen for several seconds in The Exorcist, the visual leaves a terrifying and lasting impression long after the credits roll. The voice behind the petrifying Pazuzu demon belongs to actress Mercedes McCambridge, who started her career in radio in the 1940s. She later starred in the original cast of the soap, Guiding Light, and has appeared in films such as All the King's Men (1949), for which she earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nEven though it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Pennywise (save for Tim Curry's original take), the remake adaptation of Stephen King's terrifying novel almost cast a different actor for the role of the menacing clown. Originally, Will Poulter (Midsommar, We're the Millers) was signed on but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts and the role went to Skarsgard. The Swedish actor has also starred in Deadpool 2, Castle Rock, and Allegiant, to name a few.\n\nAs it turns out, actress Daveigh Chase is really good at being a creepy kid. So good, in fact, that The Ring currently stands as one of the highest-grossing horror movie remakes of all time. At the time of filming, Chase was roughly 11-years-old. Since then, she went on to voice the role of Lilo in the animated show, Lilo & Stitch: The Series, and has also appeared in Big Love, among many other projects.\n\nThe man behind the expressionless mask of Michael Myers in the reboot of Halloween is actor/stuntman, James Jude Courtney. Before landing the role of the iconic slasher, Courtney appeared in several hit TV shows, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Unsolved Mysteries. He is also set to reprise the role in the upcoming Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. However, he wasn't the only actor to portray the killer in 2018's Halloween. Nick Castle, the actor who played the character in the original 1978 Halloween, slipped on the mask for a few of the shots.\n\nThe Nun was never meant to become the face of The Conjuring franchise, but strong fanfare behind the terrifying demonic figure shook things up. The character first appeared in 2016's The Conjuring 2, after she was added in during last-minute reshoots. But once audiences caught eye of the eerie demon, the character quickly became a fan favorite. She then made a brief appearance in the follow-up Conjuring installment, Annabelle: Creation, and eventually went on to receive a spin-off, appropriately titled, The Nun. Aarons, the actress who has portrayed the character in every outing, has also appeared in Mulholland Drive and Silver Linings Playbook.\n\nOver the course of the twelve Friday the 13th films, eight actors have portrayed the Camp Crystal Lake serial killer. But the most recent performer to don the iconic hockey mask was actor/stuntman Derek Mears in 2009's Friday the 13th remake. The actor has a lengthy horror resume, having also been in Predators, Swamp Thing, and The Hills Have Eyes 2.\n\nBetween the American film series and the original Japanese version, there are 11 Grudge movies, plus a Netflix series. Takako Fuji has portrayed the character of a vengeful spirit, Kayako, in six of the films: Ju-on: The Curse, Ju-on: The Curse 2, Ju-On: The Grudge, and Ju-on: The Grudge 2, as well as their American counterparts, The Grudge and The Grudge 2. News flash: a hair comb is used to achieve the infamous crackling sound that Kayako makes throughout all the films.\n\nThe infamous chainsaw-wielding cannibal in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was portrayed by bodybuilder-turned-actor Andrew Byrniarski. The bulky performer later reprised his role as Leatherface for the 2006 prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, and has been featured in bit parts in Pearl Harbor and Batman Returns.\n\nWhen it came time for horror director James Wan to cast the actor who would play the demonic Bathsheba character who torments the Perrin family in The Conjuring, he turned to friend Joseph Bishara. The actor has a lengthy resume portraying demons in horror films. His other acting credits include Insidious, Annabelle: Creation, and Brightfall. But acting isn't Bishara's main talent. He is also a prolific film composer and has created the music for horror hits such as The Conjuring, Annabelle, Dark Skies, and many more.\n\nThe premise for both of The Strangers movies is eerie because masked home invasions could actually happen. And one of the scariest characters in The Strangers saga is the Man in the Mask. In the 2018 sequel, the character was portrayed by actor Damian Maffei. Since starring in the slasher flick, the actor has added quite a few horror credits to his name, including appearances in Haunt and the upcoming Wrong Turn reboot.\n\nRelated: 50 Movies Sequels Coming Soon"
