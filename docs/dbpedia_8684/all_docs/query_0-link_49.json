To accomplish this, one must make determinations that may not always be agreeable to a larger audience of critics but indeed will accommodate the rationale for choosing ﬁlms as they are deﬁned as prominent cultural forces in America. Because America’s population is so diverse, part of the objective is to identify ﬁlms that reach beyond the discrete interests of audiences and touch a vibrant chord in everyone’s psyche. That doesn’t necessarily presume a ﬁlm must be a blockbuster or have been awarded a gaggle of Academy Awards. It does mean that such a ﬁlm should have had some inﬂuence on the literary, cinematic, and behavioral culture of our time, reﬂecting not only our virtues but also our hypocrisy. Such a ﬁlm is expressive of deﬁning our foibles and measuring the capacities of behavior within a dynamic of a ﬁlm’s canvas that goes beyond nurturing the public’s taste. Some ﬁlms also make dramatic and prominent statements about historical events that have affected America and the world, thus becoming part of the narrative associated with a time and place ritualizing events that took place. Films do not have to be dramatically compelling to be culturally impressive; they may have a lighter side that offers humor and pathos in an endearing theme. They may also be provocative and revealing, creating a resonating disturbance of truth and fact. We speak of revolutions and identify various chronological epochs as revolutionary, such as the Industrial Revolution, or with political inference like the American or Russian Revolutions. The term has also entered the vernacular within the context of society as the Cultural Revolution. What is a cultural revolution, and can we deﬁne it when it’s happening? Or is it the case, as Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart noted about the deﬁnition of hardcore pornography, “I know it when I see it.” The world of ﬁlm, narrative, and nonﬁction has been a deﬁning force for American and global culture since the ﬁrst publicly screened short ﬁlms. In 1895, when the brothers Lumiere projected their ﬁrst ﬁlms of everyday life at a theater in Paris, one of those ﬁlms, The Arrival of the Train at the Station, shocked some of the audience as it appeared that the projected image of the train was heading straight for them. Thomas Edison, inventor of the phonograph and the peephole kinetoscope, exhibited the ﬁrst ﬁlms in the United States. Two notable ones were Fred Ott’s Sneeze (January 1894) and ix\n\nPreface\n\nThe Kiss, which was a reenactment of what was considered to be a “risqu e” scene from the Broadway show The Widow Jones. When the ﬁlm made its debut at Koster & Bial’s Music Hall, it became Edison’s hit ﬁlm of 1896. The phenomenon of theatrical feature ﬁlms has created a cultural imperative that inﬂuences every aspect of American life. Films have been catalysts in creating a consumer culture and inﬂuencing behavior, fashion, and style. Some ﬁlms have had profound political implications pertaining to issues of race and sexuality. Others have deﬁned new industry trends, reﬂecting rapidly changing technologies that stretch the canvas of traditional cinematic storytelling. Then there are those ﬁlms that provide an intimate experience for the American public, delighting or shocking them into a euphoric state. Therefore, developing criteria that identiﬁes these ﬁlms must provide a rather subjective measure based upon the impact a ﬁlm has had and how it has become contextualized within the American cultural milieu. The larger issue of this book is to articulate how a ﬁlm has changed the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. Once again, determining factors are behavioral attitudes and the assimilation of an ideology of narrative entertainment within the dynamic of American culture. There is little doubt that ﬁlm is a catalyst for change and action and has an enduring legacy in the past and present. Placing the ﬁlms into a historical perspective assists the reader in deﬁning the theme and story within the time and place of a particular decade. The documentary Nanook of the North (1922), directed by Robert Flaherty, was an inﬂuential ﬁlm that explored the lives and culture of the Inuit people of Alaska. It was the ﬁrst ﬁlm to record their lives and culture as well as their struggle to survive against the harsh conditions of the frozen north. A narrative ﬁlm like D. W. Grifﬁth’s The Birth of a Nation (1915) demonstrated how a controversial ﬁlm could move an audience to either embrace, reject, or actively protest against its theme and its portrayal of history. Each of these ﬁlms, one a documentary, the other a narrative theatrical feature ﬁlm, had a profound effect on the technical and thematic rudiments of the motion picture industry. Therefore, this book addresses the value of these ﬁlm genres and their inﬂuence on American culture. Among high school and college students, there is a profound interest in movies as entertainment and forms of personal expression. In the classroom, directors and their ﬁlms are studied for their style, structure, technical innovations, and content, and how their technique inﬂuenced later ﬁlms and directors. This book offers students of ﬁlm a resource of information about movies; narrative and documentary, foreign and American, providing worthy discussion about their cultural relevance and inﬂuence upon American society. The noted psychologist and philosopher Rudolph Arnheim wrote: The arts, as a reﬂection of human existence at its highest, have always and spontaneously lived up to this demand of plenitude. No mature style of art in any culture has ever been simple.\n\nFilm as an art form can be a reﬂection of the human existence and a mirror of the desire, hope, and will of humanity. As Arnheim notes, the art of ﬁlm is a cultural form of expression and in its mature expressive form is complex and demanding. x\n\nPreface\n\nIn addition to providing a discussion of ﬁlms and their relevance as cultural idioms, this book also provides readers with a valuable resource tool. Special features include an alphabetical ﬁlmography of cited ﬁlms, excerpts from ﬁlm reviews, production credits for each ﬁlm, and a comprehensive bibliography of print and electronic resources. One of the most distinctive features of this book is its arrangement by decade providing the reader with the historical and cultural context of the ﬁlms discussed during that period. For example, chapter 3 “Boom and Bust: The Films of Post-War America, 1946–1947,” features the ﬁlm The Best Years of Our Lives, which is about returning World War II veterans while providing the reader with historical and cultural information about America transitioning from a war footing to a peacetime economy. It provides a time line to thought and further discussion about a movie’s ability to capture the mood and sense of history.\n\nxi\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nIt was the turn of the century, and the global political realities of the day were making an impact upon a United States hoping to remain aloof to foreign involvement. But, events in Europe would forever change the balance of world power and the stature of the United States. On June 28, 1914, Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie were traveling in a motorcade visiting Bosnia to observe military maneuvers and to preside over the opening of the state museum in Sarajevo. A group of Serbian nationalists known as The Black Hand assassinated the archduke and his wife, causing Austria to seek assurances from Germany that it would support them in any means of retaliation they chose. On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, beginning World War I. Although President Woodrow Wilson attempted to shield America from being involved and declared the country’s neutrality, it was the threat to America’s commercial shipping by German submarine warfare that forced America’s entry on April 6, 1917. America had a taste of the lethal German submarine ﬂeet when a German U-boat sank the Lusitania, a British passenger ship sailing from New York to Liverpool, killing most of the passengers onboard, including 123 Americans.\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: D. W. Grifﬁth, H. E. Aitken (executive producer, uncredited) WRITER(S): Thomas F. Dixon Jr. CAST: Lillian Gish (Elsie Stoneman), Mae Marsh (Flora Cameron), Henry B. Walthall (Col. Ben Cameron), Miriam Cooper (Margaret Cameron), Mary Alden (Lydia Brown), Ralph Lewis (Austin Stoneman), George Siegmann (Silas Lynch), Walter Long (Gus), Robert Harron (Tod Stoneman), Wallace Reid (Jeff the blacksmith) CINEMATOGRAPHY: G. W. Bitzer MUSIC: Joseph Carl Breil, D. W. Grifﬁth LENGTH AND RATING: 125 min; NR\n\nAlthough the French and Italians were the ﬁrst to introduce feature-length ﬁlms, it was the controversial and visionary director D. W. Grifﬁth who brought the epic ﬁlm to the screen. Under his authorship, The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance became spectacular 1\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nWalter Long (as Gus) surrounded by Ku Klux Klan members. [Photofest]\n\nstatements of revisionist history told on a grandiose scale and richly portrayed on ﬁlm. An experienced director with about four hundred shorter ﬁlms to his credit, Grifﬁth had been employed by the Biograph Company but left shortly after completing his longest ﬁlm (it required four reels) in 1913: Judith of Bethulia. He joined the small ﬁlm company Mutual, hoping to be free to pursue his artistic vision of creating longer ﬁlm projects. While at Mutual, Grifﬁth began researching and planning Birth of a Nation based upon Thomas Dixon’s novel The Clansman (1905), which was part of his Klan Trilogy that also included The Leopard’s Spots (1902) and The Traitor (1907). Born in 1864, Dixon was a lawyer, state legislator, novelist (22 novels), preacher, screenwriter, actor, movie producer, lecturer, and real estate speculator. Although he renounced slavery when the period of Reconstruction ended, Dixon remained a conﬁrmed segregationist, warning that African Americans must be denied equality and integration because those actions would lead to miscegenation and the disintegration of American values, family, and civilized society. In 1915, when the ﬁlm opened in Los Angeles, it made its debut under the title The Clansman but opened in New York as The Birth of a Nation. The change in title was made at Dixon’s urging; he felt it more accurately reﬂected the ﬁlm’s ambitious tableau. With a running time of three hours and a budget of $110,000, The Birth of a Nation achieved what we now term “blockbuster” status while charging the unheard of admission price of $2 in some venues. The ﬁnancial, logistical, and post-production 2\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\ncommitment was staggering. After exhausting the money of his backers, Grifﬁth sought other sources, including his own. He spent three weeks in rehearsals, shot the ﬁlm from July to October, then took three months to edit the ﬁlm. Although there are no accurate ﬁgures concerning the ﬁlm’s earnings, there are estimates it could have grossed as much as $50 million. Because of the manner in which blacks were portrayed in the ﬁlm, there were riots, protests, and demonstrations across the country. Although Grifﬁth asserted that he was not racist, the ﬁlm was a condemnation of African Americans visualized in stereotypical roles during and after the Civil War and the era of Reconstruction. It articulated their inferiority and accused those of mixed blood as being the worst of the lot led by unscrupulous greedy white people. Grifﬁth was sustained by the romantic vision of the South in all its gossamer ﬁnery, where the “coloreds” were childlike and subservient. Those African Americans who were loyal to the South and its values were considered the “good” blacks. The ﬁlm also endorsed the concept of slavery and gloriﬁed the Ku Klux Klan, referred to in a March 4 New York Times review as, “…the night riding of the men of the Ku Klux Klan, who look like a company of avenging spectral crusaders sweeping along the moonlit roads” (http://www.africanamericans. com/BirthofaNation.htm). It was criticized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for its virulent depiction of blacks, causing riots to break out in major cities and distribution denials in eight states. Although critics of Grifﬁth and The Birth of a Nation may disagree with the manner in which he contextualized the content of the work within a framework of bigotry and stereotypes of blacks, they nevertheless agree that he mastered the cinematic technique with a unique sense of empowerment. His talent for presenting scenes from various perspectives in an animated fashion added tension and drama. The actors mastered their characters with a sublime sense of purpose, avoiding the exaggerated stylized pantomime that so often was a hallmark of silent ﬁlm. Instead, they relied upon the nuances of subtlety in their facial expressions and actions. Grifﬁth’s attention to the historically accurate details of the period brings the audience into the time and place of the ﬁlm. Its costumes and rich reproduction of interior sets, as well as the visual interpretation of battle, provides a texture of authenticity that sustains a vivid tableaux of the time.\n\nINTOLERANCE (1916) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: D. W. Grifﬁth WRITER(S): D. W. Grifﬁth (scenario), Anita Loos (titles) CAST: Mae Marsh (The Dear One), Robert Harron (The Boy), F. A. Turner (The Girl’s Father), Sam De Grasse (Arthur Jenkins), Vera Lewis (Mary T. Jenkins), Mary Alden (Self-Styled Uplifter), Eleanor Washington (Self-Styled Uplifter), Pearl Elmore (Self-Styled Uplifter), Lucille Browne (Self-Styled Uplifter), Mrs. Arthur Mackley (Self-Styled Uplifter) CINEMATOGRAPHY: G. W. Bitzer MUSIC: Carl Davis LENGTH AND RATING: 163 min; NR\n\nThe world was in a chaotic state when D. W. Grifﬁth released Intolerance in 1916. As implied by the title, Grifﬁth envisioned Intolerance as a response to his critics who condemned his earlier The Birth of a Nation as blatantly racist. The timing of the ﬁlm’s 3\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nrelease and its theme of paciﬁsm and tolerance was the antithesis of the American mood, which embraced the fear and anxiety of America’s entry into the war in Europe. The ﬁlm’s theme traces the tragedy of bigotry, hatred, persecution, and hypocrisy through the ages by telling four stories that highlight the dreadful and heartbreaking results. Grifﬁth began this effort as a more modest ﬁlm entitled The Mother and the Law, but soon realized that his need to preach the sermon of tolerance and respond to charges of racism required a more monumental work. The four stories not only are thematically associated but are also linked by the virtues of “The Woman Who Rocks the Cradle,” played by actress Lillian Gish, who is “the uniter of here and hereafter,” representing eternal motherhood. She is Grifﬁth’s metaphor for the human race from birth to death. In a cameo shot, Gish rocks the cradle that bridges the stories while showing the title of Walt Whitman’s controversial volume of poems, Leaves of Grass. At the time Whitman’s ﬁrst volume was published in 1855, it was considered controversial and indecent because it exulted in the body and sexual love. Perhaps in Whitman Grifﬁth shared the same feeling of being an artistic agent provocateur condemned by his critics. The amber-tinted “Modern Story” (1914) is about the beleaguered factory worker during a time of labor unrest in California heightened by strikes in a push to organize. A young Irish Catholic boy working under harsh conditions is wrongly accused of murder and sentenced to hang. His wife, whose baby was taken by “righteous” women deeming her an unﬁt mother, relentlessly pursues his innocence. He is saved at the last moment as she arrives with the governor’s pardon. In the blue-tint “Judean Story,” the shortest of the four, Grifﬁth presents a passion play about Christ and his confrontation with the Pharisees, who rejected his teachings, and his later betrayal and cruciﬁxion. “The French Story” (sepia tint) takes place during the sixteenth-century Renaissance and portrays the savage organized persecution and murder of the French Huguenots during the reign of King Charles the IX of France and his diabolical Catholic mother, Catherine de Medici. Catherine was the widow of Henry II and mother to three successive kings: Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III. The ﬁlm describes the horriﬁc events of the St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, in which thousands of Protestants in Paris and outside the city were killed, and its effect on the upcoming wedding of a young and pure Huguenot couple, Brown Eyes and Prosper Latour, also victims of the slaughter. “The Babylonian Story” (gray/green tint) takes place in 539 BC. It tells the story of the peaceful prince Belshazzar, who promotes tolerance and religious freedom, and the attack and eventual capitulation of Babylon under the siege by King Cyrus the Persian. The ﬁlm focuses on the poignant story of the Mountain Girl, who is devoted to the prince and attempts to prevent the tragedy. A rival sect plans to aid the Persians and overthrow Babylon, but the Babylonians successfully repel them. As the Babylonians celebrate, the Mountain Girl learns of another plot to invade the city. She rushes to warn the prince but it is too late; both are killed as the city is conquered. Grifﬁth’s Intolerance distinguishes itself as an epic ﬁlm that articulates an innovative narrative structure that deﬁnes a parallel nonlinear visual composition for the cinema. At a cost of $2 million, the ﬁlm was the most expensive ever produced and a monument to Grifﬁth’s vision, as revealed in the ﬁlm’s grandiose production values. The magniﬁcent sets for “The Babylonian Story” employed innovative cinematography techniques (crane and elevator tower tracking shot) while also creating extravagant 4\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\ncrowd scenes that even included live elephants; indeed, Grifﬁth spared no expense in portraying his stories on the screen. The director’s attention to detail and the miseen-sc ene is a tribute to his ability to visualize the tone, tenor, and fabric of the story. Grifﬁth captures the drama and creates a stunning portrait painted in the chiaroscuro of color tinting and light that gives texture to the ﬁlm. His use of montage and crosscutting between the four stories, although difﬁcult at times to follow, is a brilliant tool to allow the stories to unfold in a thematic manner. Described by a historian as the only ﬁlm fugue, Intolerance has a rhythm and melody that created a dissonance among viewers who found the parallel action and intercutting difﬁcult to follow. The ﬁlm, however, did not succeed with the public because of its innovative structure and the expense of providing full orchestration. Nonetheless, Grifﬁth’s technique and style were emulated by later directors, including Sergei Eisenstein, Cecil B. DeMille, Alfred Hitchcock, and Akira Kurosawa. Grifﬁth’s Intolerance had a tremendous inﬂuence on global cinema as a primer for future directors and as a means for indoctrinating movie audiences into modern visual storytelling.\n\nNANOOK OF THE NORTH (1922) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Robert J. Flaherty (producer), John Revillon (executive producer) WRITER(S): Frances H. Flaherty (idea), Robert J. Flaherty (writer) CAST: Allakariallak (Nanook), Nyla (Nanook’s wife, the smiling one), Cunayou (Nanook’s wife), Allee (Nanook’s son), Allegoo (Nanook’s son), Berry Kroeger (Narrator for 1939 re-release; uncredited) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Robert J. Flaherty MUSIC: Rudolph Schramur (1947), Stanley Silverman (1976) LENGTH AND RATING: 79 mins; NR\n\nThe world was only recently recovering from the Great War as it greeted with trepidation the news of Mussolini’s march on Rome and the formation of a Fascist government. It was a deﬁning moment in world politics that would have wide repercussions on the global community. In the United States, there was labor unrest as the United Mine Workers of America struck for six months, demanding higher wages and crippling the coal mining industry. One of the English language’s greatest writers, James Joyce, published Ulysses in 1922, although it was banned in the United States until 1933 because of its perceived use of obscenities. America was still a very puritanical society and once again faced challenges from within and without. Perhaps, then, it was time for a ﬁlm about a peaceful race of people who consistently battled only one formidable enemy while struggling to survive in the harsh climate and environment of the North. As America faced new national and international challenges, Robert J. Flaherty produced one of the most compelling ﬁlms ever made. It was a majestic effort to record the daily lives of Eskimos, and Flaherty, an explorer by profession with no ﬁlmmaking experience, was the least likely candidate to accomplish this effort. He lived in Canada among the Eskimos for many years doing trade, observing their lifestyle, and informally photographing them in their daily routine. In 1913, Flaherty set forth on an exploring ship ﬁtted with lumber and material with enough food for eight men over a span of two years. Working as a prospector for a railroad 5\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\n[Pathe/Photofest]\n\ncompany, Flaherty was embarking on his third expedition to the Hudson Bay area and his boss, Sir William Mackenzie, suggested he take a motion picture camera along to record the people and wildlife he encountered. It was also hoped that the photography might help to defray some of the costs associated with exploration. His only training was the two weeks he spent prior to the trip with a motion picture camera demonstrator. Flaherty wintered on the Belcher Islands and shot ﬁlm of Eskimos, but while completing the editing in Toronto, Canada, a ﬁre destroyed 30,000 feet of ﬁlm. Fortunately, the negative print was saved. After looking at his original material, Flaherty realized that the ﬁlm was far too episodic and lacked cohesiveness. He decided to embark on another journey north, this time with the explicit purpose of making a motion picture about Eskimos. Flaherty had a particular interest in one Inuit family and its leader, Nanook, and lived with them for some time before ﬁlming. Funding for this second, more ambitious project came from Revillon Fr eres, a French fur trading company that had outposts on the Hudson Bay. In the newer version of the ﬁlm, Flaherty was not simply an observer of the challenges Nanook and his family faced in the harsh climate of the Arctic; he also became a director of the drama, staging and manipulating the action for the camera. He forbade the Eskimos to use their riﬂes to hunt, instead preferring the tension and conﬂict that harpoon hunting provided. In addition, Flaherty staged the ending of 6\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nthe ﬁlm as Nanook and his family appeared to be near death due to their inability to ﬁnd shelter even though an igloo had been built beforehand. After completing the ﬁlm, Flaherty faced the challenge of distributing it and was rejected by most distribution companies. They told him people would not want to see a movie about Eskimos. Finally, he arranged an agreement with Path e and the ﬁlm was exhibited at Samuel “Roxy” Rothafel’s Capitol Theatre in New York. Rothafel was an impresario of the great silent movie palaces of that era, having built the Capitol, the Strand, and the Roxy movie theater in New York City. He didn’t expect much in the way of box ofﬁce revenue and was stunned when in the ﬁrst week Nanook of the North earned $43,000. It was a critical and artistic success. A review in the June 12, 1922, New York Times heralded Flaherty’s ﬁlm as a “real life-and-death struggle.” The reviewer went on to describe Nanook, the main protagonist in the ﬁlm, this way: He is emphatically a leader, a man who does things, a man who wins, but who at any moment, may lose. He is a genuine hero then, one who is watched with alert interest and suspense and far-reaching imagination.\n\nThe New York Times review also comments on Flaherty’s ability to create the mise-ensc ene of the movie: It took more than just a man with a camera to make Nanook of the North. Mr. Flaherty had to wait for his light, he had to select his shots, he had to compose his scenes, he had to direct his people, in order that Nanook’s story might develop its full force of realism and drama on the screen (New York Times, “The Screen,” June 12, 1922).\n\nNanook of the North was the ﬁrst commercially successful silent ﬁlm theatrical documentary, and this gave Flaherty a great deal of recognition. In his pursuit of making ﬁlms in collaboration with local communities, Robert J. Flaherty became known as the father of documentary ﬁlm. He used his success to create other compelling documentaries that explored the cultural and natural challenges people face. They are Moana (1926), Man of Aran (1934), Elephant Boy (1937), and Louisiana Story (1948).

Those ﬁlms are Metropolis, The General, and The Jazz Singer. Each expresses a distinctive cinematic voice that articulates sensibilities and virtues while challenging convention. 7\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nMETROPOLIS (1927) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Fritz Lang (director), Giorgio Moroder (producer for 1984 restoration), Erich Pommer (producer) WRITER(S): Thea von Harbou (screenplay and novel), Fritz Lang (screenplay; uncredited) ohlich (Freder, Joh Fredersen’s son), Rudolf CAST: Alfred Abel (Joh Fredersen), Gustav Fr€ Klein-Rogge (C.

In Great Britain, an inﬂuenza epidemic claimed the lives of one thousand people a week. There were compelling technological innovations such as the ﬁrst transmission of electronic television pictures, the ﬁrst Pan American Airways ﬂight from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba; the opening of the Holland Tunnel in New York City; and the ﬁrst transatlantic telephone call from New York City to London. It appears that Metropolis, directed by Fritz Lang, was released at a fortuitous time in the history of global technology. It tells a story set in the year 2026 about a city-state dominated by a bourgeois class: the leaders and thinkers who live in plush luxury on the surface of the Earth. They have subjugated the working class, who live underground and toil endlessly in harsh conditions to support the leaders. The ﬁlm portrays a technological culture in which Lang anticipates future inventions such as the television, automatic doors, monorails, and the “Maschinenmensch Hel,” a robot or Machine Man oriented toward a consumer culture. The set design, with its symbolism and modernistic texture, is a testimony to German Expressionism, and the special effects create an abstract impressionistic design enhanced by creative lighting. Fritz Lang was intrigued with how people behave when challenged by powerful large bureaucracies, such as corporations, businesses, and criminal gangs. To Lang, people are pawns in a game of power and can be engineered to behave a certain way. And, even when these people have truth and justice on their side, their individualism is destroyed by the dynamic of force and control. Lang was a consummate and autocratic ﬁlmmaker with a versatile ability to adapt to many different genres and themes. Even though he treated his actors poorly, major stars appeared in his ﬁlms, among them Henry Fonda, Spencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Bennett, Barbara Stanwyck, Tyrone Power, and Edward G. Robinson. Lang preferred leading ladies with strong character, and for that trait he turned to Joan Bennett, who starred in four of his ﬁlm classics: Woman in the Window (1944), Scarlet Street (1945), Secret Beyond the Door (1947), and Man Hunt (1941). As an epic science ﬁction drama, Metropolis established newly deﬁned techniques in cinematography and narrative storytelling and set the tone for many subsequent ﬁlms that dealt with similar technological themes. Lang also uses the ﬁlm to demonstrate his knowledge of art and architecture. Metropolis was produced by the giant 8\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nGerman studio, Universun – Film – Aktiengesellschaft (UFA), and featured thousands of extras and the latest cinematic technological innovations. It was a box ofﬁce disaster and was quickly withdrawn from distribution, then re-edited and re-released. Eventually it was restored and scenes that hadn’t been viewed in decades were reintegrated into the print. Metropolis sustains the legacy of Lang and the pursuit of epic ﬁlmmaking, which in turn allows directors to embrace the language and objective of the auteur.\n\nTHE GENERAL (1927) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Clyde Bruckman (director), Buster Keaton (director and producer), Joseph M. Schenck (executive producer and producer) WRITER(S): Al Boasberg (adaptation), Clyde Bruckman (writer) CAST: Marion Mack (Annabelle Lee), Glen Cavender (Union Capt. Anderson, chief spy), Jim Farley (Gen. Thatcher, US Army), Frederick Vroom (Confederate general), Charles Henry Smith (Mr. Lee, Annabelle’s father), Frank Barnes (Annabelle’s brother), Joe Keaton (Union general), Mike Donlin (Union general), Tom Nawn (Union general), Buster Keaton (Johnny Gray) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Bert Haines, Devereaux Jennings MUSIC: Carl Davis (1987), Joe Hisaishi (2004), Robert Israel (1995) LENGTH AND RATING: 75 mins; NR\n\nAs an actor, comedian, and director, Buster Keaton used the classic traits of drama and plot development to create ﬁlms that were true to the integrity and character of a ﬁlm’s period. He was a dedicated artist, and each frame in The General adheres to his meticulous sense of detail and his compelling need for historic relevance. Indeed, some critics have compared the visual traits of this ﬁlm to the black-and-white photographs taken by Matthew Brady during the Civil War. The movie is a resounding comedic tour de force with a physicality and uniqueness provided by the sophisticated technique employed by the creative use of design, form, and function. Although great comedians, both Chaplin and Keaton could light up the silent screen with humor, compassion, and pathos but it was Keaton who became a great storyteller and a masterful director. The General was one of the most expensive ﬁlms ($400,000) (http://www.imdb.com/ title/tt0017925) of that era. Based on a true story, it told of daring Union ofﬁcers who posed as confederate soldiers to capture a confederate train near Atlanta and return it to the Union. Most of those soldiers were eventually caught and hanged as spies. A book describing this event, Daring and Suffering: a History of the Great Railway Adventure, by William Pittenger, provided the story line for Keaton’s ﬁctional interpretation. Keaton portrays the lovelorn Johnny Gray, who pines for his girl, Annabelle Lee (perhaps a reference to Edgar Allan Poe’s poem “Annabelle Lee”), and the General, the locomotive that is his other true love. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Annabelle Lee anticipates that Johnny, like her brother and all the other young men, will join the army. Poor Johnny tries to enlist but the Confederacy values his experience as a locomotive engineer more than his potential as a soldier. Because his true love spurns him (after her father and brother are both wounded), Johnny is forlorn but rises to the occasion, chasing the spies who also chase him and pursuing his beloved General and his girlfriend Annabelle Lee, who has been taken prisoner on the train by the spies. 9\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nFor Buster Keaton, The General was a triumph for his vision, art, and talent. It was, of course, a silent ﬁlm made on the dawn of the “talkies.” Unfortunately, the critics were not enthusiastic. In his February 8, 1927, review in the New York Times, Mordaunt Hall notes, This is by no means so good as Mr. Keaton’s previous efforts. Here he is more the acrobat than the clown and his vehicle might be described as a mixture of cast iron and jelly (http://movies.nytimes.com/movie).\n\nOther reviewers also diminished its worth, referring to Keaton’s “woefully bad judgment and gruesomely bad taste,” and pointing out it was the “least funny thing Buster Keaton has done.” Although the ﬁlm’s critical and box ofﬁce failure ($500,000) disturbed Keaton, he did not publicly articulate his disappointment but continued to refer to The General as “my pet.” In 1928, he was forced to sell his ﬁlm unit to MGM, a decision he later regretted due to the restrictive nature of the agreement. As a result he was forced into the studio system giving up the autonomy that he had previously enjoyed. He became despondent and lapsed into an alcoholic stupor, spending most of the 1930s in obscurity. During that time he became a joke writer for a number of MGM Marx Brothers ﬁlms and some movies featuring Red Skelton. His inﬂuence on American culture as a comedian and ﬁlm director had a profound effect on comedy, ﬁlmmaking, and the art of cinema.\n\nTHE JAZZ SINGER (1927) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Alan Crosland WRITER(S): Samson Raphaelson (play), Alfred A. Cohn (adaptation) CAST: Al Jolson (Jakie Rabinowitz), May McAvoy (Mary Dale), Warner Oland (Cantor Rabinowitz), Eugenie Besserer (Sara Rabinowitz), Otto Lederer (Moisha Yudelson), Robert Gordon (Jakie Rabinowitz, age 13), Richard Tucker (Harry Lee), Cantor Joseff Rosenblatt (Himself, concert recital) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Hal Mohr (photography) MUSIC: Louis Silvers LENGTH AND RATING: 88 mins; NR\n\nThey danced the Charleston, and women deﬁed convention as “ﬂappers,” wearing short hair and short dresses with powdered knees. Prohibition was ignored, with Americans consuming more alcohol than ever before. When the term “jazz” entered the American lexicon, it took on various meanings that were contextualized by different groups. Some found it to be vulgar and lacking any aesthetic to be considered art, while others embraced the rhythm and blues and became devoted fans of Fats Waller, Bessie Smith, George Gershwin, and Paul Whiteman. As the music scene changed to the cadence and beat of the blues, ﬁlm embraced a new technology: the technique of sound recording. The ﬁrst sound on disc process was developed by Bell Telephone’s research lab, Western Electric, and was named the Vitaphone. After repeated rejections from the major studios, including Paramount, Warner Brothers, a smaller studio embarking on 10\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nAl Jolson as Jakie Rabinowitz. [Warner Bros. Pictures/Photofest]\n\nan ambitious program of expansion, bought the Vitaphone system. The larger studios were ambivalent about sound because of the expense of equipping motion picture theaters (about $20,000 per theater) and competing sound systems (optical and disc). Also, the major studios were, for the most part, lulled into a false sense of security by stability and proﬁts. On August 6, 1926, Warner Brothers presented a program of short sound ﬁlms and also screened a feature ﬁlm, Don Juan, with synchronized musical accompaniment. It should be noted that The Jazz Singer was not the ﬁrst ﬁlm to synchronize image with speech and it was not the ﬁrst sound ﬁlm. However, it was the ﬁrst full-length feature to utilize synchronized sound to tell a story. The narrative was adapted by Alfred A. Cohn from a 1921 short story by Samson Raphaelson titled The Day of Atonement. Most of the ﬁlm was shot silent using intertitles but included at least ﬁve scenes with synchronized speech. In one scene, Jakie Rabinowtiz, after forsaking his heritage as a Jewish cantor, visits his parents and performs Blue Skies for his mother, Sara. When his father arrives home he commands that the blasphemous music stop and the movie reverts to silence. This served as a visual and aural metaphor for the sound ﬁlm as being modern and the silent ﬁlm a thing of the past. Although The Jazz Singer had both sound and silent sequences, Al Jolson’s voice in dialogue and song imbued his character with a rich, colorful, and compelling presence. During the silent sequences, his large rolling banjo eyes and over-pronounced gestures 11\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nare a portrait of a ﬁlm aesthetic on the verge of extinction. However, the ﬂuid camera technique during the silent sequences is not matched during those with sound, where the camera by necessity (because of microphones) was more static. Those moments with sound created a dramatic context that could not be matched by the silent ﬁlm. Jolson then utters that famous line You ain’t heard nothin’ yet! Wait a minute. I tell ya, you ain’t heard nothin’. You want to hear “Toot Toot Tootsie”? All right, hold on…\n\nThe audience’s enthusiasm embraced the line and was overwhelmed by the moment. As a result of The Jazz Singer, which was a huge hit, the American motion picture industry was revitalized. Jolson’s second movie for Warner Brothers, The Singing Fool (1928), was an even bigger success. Better than The Jazz Singer, the ﬁlm became a huge moneymaker for the studio and held the record as the top grossing sound ﬁlm until Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1937. At the ﬁrst Academy Awards ceremony in May 1929, The Jazz Singer was excluded from the “Best Picture” category because it was thought unfair to have it compete with silent ﬁlms. However, producer Darryl F. Zanuck was presented with a special Oscar for pioneering the production of talking ﬁlms and revolutionizing the industry. Indeed, sound changed the entire dynamic of the motion picture industry, and by 1929 the silent ﬁlm was no longer a marketable form of entertainment. Although not a masterpiece, and by today’s sophisticated standards rather cumbersome, The Jazz Singer left its legacy on American culture and ﬁlm. It had an effect on every nuance of the American psyche, demonstrating the compelling sensuality of adding sound to image and creating a new aesthetic that challenged the senses. The ﬁlm was not an epic (it had no grandiose ambitions), but it was the story of a cantor’s son who rejects his heritage and becomes a music hall entertainer. What distinguishes The Jazz Singer is that it could take this theme and build a cohesive dramatic narrative that embodies the essence of character through picture and sound. It touched the depth of emotions with tools and techniques that would become part of the lingua franca of cinema.\n\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (1930) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Lewis Milestone (director), Carl Laemmle Jr. (producer) WRITER(S): Erich Maria Remarque (novel), Maxwell Anderson (adaptation) CAST: Louis Wolheim (Kat Katczinsky), Lew Ayres (Paul B€aumer), John Wray (Himmelstoss), Arnold Lucy (Professor Kantorek), Ben Alexander (Franz Kemmerich), Scott Kolk (Leer), Owen Davis Jr. (Peter), Walter Rogers (Behn), William Bakewell (Albert Kropp), Russell Gleason (Mueller) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Arthur Edeson, Karl Freund (uncredited) MUSIC: Sam Perry (silent version, uncredited), Heinz Roemheld (silent version, uncredited) LENGTH AND RATING: 138 mins (copyright length) | USA: 133 mins (restored version: Library of Congress); NR 12\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nThe “Blue Plate Special” is a square meal for two bits. It was a symbol of the 1930s and the unease that America faced during and after the Depression. The 1930s were ﬁlled with the incongruous images of Americans lining up for food, families crowding into small apartments and homes, children and adults suffering from lack of medical care and malnutrition, and people trying to survive by selling pencils and apples in the city. A popular song, “Brother Can You Spare a Dime,” lamented the decline of a fellow they once called Al, who served his country, built railroads and towers, and now was reduced to standing in line waiting for bread. Hundreds of thousands of people left their homes and traveled the country looking for food and work, as depicted in the novel and ﬁlm, The Grapes Of Wrath, and articulated in the song. By 1932 one out of every four Americans was unemployed. Between 1929 and 1932, the average American family’s income was reduced by 40 percent, from $2,300 to $1,500. In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt adopted his “New Deal”, which introduced many social and economic reforms already available to Europeans. For example, his administration created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which provided jobs for young men between the ages of 18 and 25 at thirty dollars a month. One of the most effective means of escapism during these turbulent times was radio. Radio programming provided audiences with relief from their daily challenges as they listened to comedies and dramas such as Amos ‘n’ Andy, Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, and Dick Tracy. And ﬁlms offered distraction for so many weary people. There were gangster movies like Little Caesar, Public Enemy, and Scarface, which depicted the ruthless efforts of criminals to beat the system, and there were movies like Mr. Deeds Goes To Town and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington that exempliﬁed the American hero and his ﬁght with the establishment. There were also comedies with Mae West and W. C. Fields that featured sexual innuendos and double entendres that poked fun at the rigid sexual mores of American society and managed to offend more than a few Americans. During the depths of the Depression, 60 to 80 million people bought a movie ticket each week. But, the movies were susceptible to the economic variables of the Depression, and theater attendance and revenue fell 40 percent in 1933. Theaters were closed, budgets slashed, the price of admission was cut, more double bills and premiums were offered, and Bank Nights were created, with winners receiving a cash prize. The mood of America was solemn in 1930, when perhaps one of the greatest antiwar ﬁlms ever produced, All Quiet on the Western Front, based on Erich Maria Remarque’s autobiographical novel, was released. It was a compelling indictment of the horrors and tragedy of war. The author was a young German soldier who had served in World War I and then written about his experiences. For many, memories of this Great War were still lingering as this ﬁlm was released, twelve years later. Produced under the auspices of Universal Studios head of production Carl Laemmle, Jr., at a cost of $1.25 million, the ﬁlm used two thousand extras along with sprawling California ranch land to ﬁlm the epic battle scenes. Director Lewis Milestone won the Academy Award for best director (it was his ﬁrst sound ﬁlm) and the movie also won an Academy Award for best picture. In his New York Times review of the ﬁlm dated April 30, 1930, Mordaunt Hall praises the vivid portrayal of battle and the frightening sounds of war. Often the scenes are of such excellence that if they were not audible one might believe that they were actual motion pictures of activities behind the lines, in the trenches and in No Man’s Land. It is an expansive production with views that 13\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nnever appear to be cramped. In looking at a dugout one readily imagines a long line of such earthly abodes. When shells demolish these underground quarters, the shrieks of fear, coupled with the rat-tat-tat of machine guns, the bangs of the trench mortars and the whining of shells, it tells the story of the terrors of ﬁghting better than anything so far has done in animated photography coupled with a microphone (http://movies.nytimes.com/movie).\n\nThe ﬁlm begins with a prologue which is adapted almost verbatim from Remarque’s novel. It articulates the theme of the movie, contextualizing it within the horrors of war and how even those who survive are burdened with its tragic legacy. “This story is neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.” This movie made a profound statement about the impact of war on the men who fought, died, and survived. It addressed the themes of brutality, comradeship, and the compelling sense of futility. This ﬁlm had a major inﬂuence on other war ﬁlms that told the story from a soldier’s perspective, including the more recent movies Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), and Saving Private Ryan (1998).\n\nLITTLE CAESAR (1930) AND THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) The public’s fascination with crime and the characteristics of gangsters has held a timeless infatuation with audiences. The exploits of outlaws, whether gloriﬁed in westerns like Billy the Kid, Jesse James, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid or their modern-day counter parts in theatrical ﬁlms such as The Untouchables, Bonnie and Clyde, The Godfather, and Goodfellas, or featured in the popular HBO television series The Sopranos, have become cultural icons in the fabric of American ﬁlm and television. Early sound ﬁlms set the tone of the gangster genre, characterizing it with the harsh reality of overcoming poverty and social disillusionment within the unending hardships of the Depression era. Little Caesar and The Public Enemy provided the fundamentals for later interpretations of the genre by contextualizing the character of the gangster within the social milieu of the times. The 1930s was also the time of the Production Code and the rise of the Catholic Church as a means of oversight for ﬁlm content. Censorship was nothing new to the American motion picture industry. National scandals involving Hollywood celebrities in the 1920s shocked fans and tested the faith of audiences. There was the “quicky” Nevada divorce of “America’s Sweetheart” Mary Pickford from husband Owen Moore so that she could marry Douglas Fairbanks, as well as the scandals involving Fatty Roscoe Arbuckle and his notorious parties, including one in 1917 that ended with a Massachusetts district attorney receiving a $100,000 gift, leaving people to wonder what he had kept quiet about to earn that sum. At another, held at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco in 1921, one of his guests, Virginia Rappe, was found dead in her hotel room. Although eventually acquitted after three trials, Arbuckle’s career was over. Reeling from these high-voltage indiscretions, the Hollywood studios decided it would be best if they engaged in self-censorship rather than have Congress assert their own form of it. The Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) was created and Will H. Hays, President Harding’s campaign manager, the United States 14\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nPostmaster General, a Republican and church-going Presbyterian elder, was named its ﬁrst commissioner and he served for twenty-three years. In 1945, the name of the organization was changed to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). In addition to the economic challenges facing the motion picture industry during the Depression in the 1930s, there was an aggressive initiative to “clean up” motion pictures and make them morally pure. To this end, two Catholic laymen, Martin Quigley and, later, Joseph I. Breen, helped create and enforce the Hollywood Production Code as part of the Production Code Administration (PCA). At the MPPDA, also known as the Hays Ofﬁce, Breen went to work administering the PCA, issuing a seal of approval only to the ﬁlms that met the rigid content standards of the Code. Any producer or distributor who released a ﬁlm without obtaining the seal would be ﬁned $25,000. The Code clearly articulated the do’s and don’ts of story content and expected the industry to respect the sacrament of marriage and avoid the more deviant forms of promiscuous sex, including “unwedded,” “extramarital,” and “unnatural.” There was a list of forbidden words, including “sex,” “God,” “hell,” and “damn.” Some words that appeared rather innocuous and part of America’s lingua franca, such as “guts,” “nuts,” and “louse” were also on the list. Then there was the screen innovation of the “Hollywood beds”: married couples sleeping separately in twin beds. This legacy remained with some of the early television sitcoms, including The Dick Van Dyke Show, which had the Petrys sleeping in separate beds about ﬁve feet apart. As human sexuality was being scrubbed and neutered by the Code administrators, stipulations began to control how violence was portrayed. Brutality was to be avoided by gangsters, and especially by the police. Also, any immoral or illegal lifestyle was to be depicted in a way that would be considered distasteful to audiences, echoing the theme that “crime doesn’t pay.” While the Code attempted to sanitize ﬁlm content and was an unrealistic representation of American mores and culture, the motion picture industry had little choice but to comply. Throughout the Depression, even though audiences scraped their nickels and dimes to see a movie, audience attendance had fallen. In addition, the banks that supported the motion picture industry were eager to sustain the conservative values and economic empowerment they enjoyed. The industry faced the challenges of the early 1930s by creating the double feature (two movies for the price of one) and adding trailers, cartoons, shorts, and newsreels. They also featured games like Keno, Bingo, and Screeno, giving away cash prizes and dishes.\n\nLITTLE CAESAR (1930) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Mervyn LeRoy (director), Hal B.

Indeed, after the Codes implementation, both ﬁlms were withdrawn from distribution and were not re-released until 1953. The actor Edward G. Robinson, who had portrayed “tough guys” in earlier ﬁlms, was superb in the role of Caesar “Rico” Bandello, a character modeled after the ruthless mobster Al Capone, with a tribute to the Brooklyn underworld ﬁgure Bugsy Goldstein. Facing the chaotic tensions of a country challenged by a Depression, Little Caesar, at ﬁrst a small-time hoodlum in an unnamed burg, ﬁnds opportunity on the streets of Chicago and with ruthless determination ascends to the top of the criminal heap. After tasting success and earning the fearful respect of his cohorts, he embarks on an often psychotic adventure of crime, striving for society’s acceptance and thwarting his ambition by terrorizing the innocents who repulse at his behavior. The ﬁlm begins with this prescient quote from St. Matthew: …for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. (Matthew:26-52)\n\nCaesar, ﬂush with ambition, conﬁdes in his sidekick Joe that he’s aiming for bigger and better things in life. Once in Chicago, he cajoles his way into Sam Vetorri’s gang. In scenes that established the image and dialogue that foreshadowed other gangster ﬁlms to follow, including The Godfather and Goodfellas, Sam introduces Rico to “the boys,” giving him the nom de guerre “Little Caesar.” During the introduction, the rough-hewn faces of the gang members are prominently shown and introductions (including nicknames) are made, praising their unique talents as such: Tony Passa who can drive better than anyone; Otero, he’s little but got the goods; and others like Killer Peppie and Kid Bean.\n\nRico makes a name for himself and soon wins the loyalty of Sam Vetorri’s crew, assuming the position as gang leader and telling Sam that he’s through. His ruthless, unbridled ambition portends a precipitous fall, and once Rico is betrayed by his best friend Joe and in a face off cannot shoot him, he ﬂees from the police and goes into hiding. While Rico is living on the lam, the police plant stories in the newspapers, calling him a coward and luring him to a confrontation. Allowing his ego to get the better of him, Rico confronts his law enforcement nemesis, Flaherty, who guns him down in a hail of machine gun bullets. Facing death and still in denial about his fate, Rico says: Mother of Mercy! Is this the end of Rico?\n\nBecause of the thematic elements introduced and sustained in this ﬁlm, Little Caesar is a classic that had a profound impact on its audience and the culture of the twentieth century. In his January 10, 1931, review, New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall noted there were unusual crowds gathered at the Strand Theater in New York for the opening of the ﬁlm. The character of Little Caesar no doubt appealed to Depression-era audiences because of his bravado, contempt for the rule of law, and initial success in overcoming overwhelming odds. The themes of ambition, greed, arrogance, betrayal,\n\n16\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nand retribution became the hallmark of later incarnations of the mobster ﬁlm. In his review, Hall writes about Edward G. Robinson’s portrayal of Little Caesar: Little Caesar becomes at Mr. Robinson’s hands a ﬁgure out of Greek epic tragedy, a cold, ignorant, merciless killer, driven on and on by an insatiable lust for power, the plaything of a force that is greater than himself.\n\nTHE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: William A.

Other locals who inﬂuenced the creation of the Tommy Powers character were Dion O’Banion and Hymie Weiss, both members of the Chicago North Siders gang that challenged the supremacy of Al Capone. The story was adapted from the novel Beer and Blood by John Bright and Kubec Glasmon, who also wrote the screenplay. It was directed by William Wellman and completed in less than a month at a cost of about $151,000 (http://www.ﬁlmsite.org/publ.html). In an effort to accommodate concerns about glorifying ruthless criminals, Warner Brothers displayed the text of an opening preface that read: It is the ambition of the authors of The Public Enemy to honestly depict an environment that exists today in a certain strata of American life, rather than glorify the hoodlum or the criminal. While the story of The Public Enemy is essentially a true story, all names and characters appearing herein are purely ﬁctional.\n\nInterestingly, Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of Warner Brothers production and producer of The Public Enemy, attempted to placate the members of the Production Code by stating that the means toward curbing law-breaking was through the betterment of environment and education. Another rationale that the studio hoped would satisfy potential critics of the ﬁlm was to present it as a sociological study attempting to reconcile the road to criminality with poverty, deprivation, and a lack of education. However, those arguments in favor of the ﬁlm’s merits did not deter the New York censor board from cutting six scenes before allowing its release. Although The Public Enemy was not subject to the provisions of the Production Code, it did create more oversight toward the treatment of crime and gangsters by the MPPDA.\n\n17\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nThe ﬁlm was a tremendous hit at the box ofﬁce and established James Cagney as a movie star.

At Universal, the horror ﬁlm led to a lingua franca of imagery as a descendent of classics such as The Golem and Nosferatu. One essential ingredient of the horror ﬁlm was a knowledge of the creative lighting techniques that originated in Germany; those techniques were implicit to creating a chiaroscuro effect for mood and impending terror. After performing on Broadway as the bloodthirsty Count Dracula, Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi starred in Tod Browning’s movie adaptation of the story. (“The man of a thousand faces,” Lon Chaney, Sr., was originally cast in the lead but died of throat cancer.) The ﬁrst unauthorized ﬁlm adaptation of Bram Stoker’s 1897 novel Dracula was the silent ﬁlm Nosferatu: A Symphony in Terror (1922), directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck. The 1931 ﬁlm was closer to the stage play, written by John Balderston and Hamilton Deane, than to Stoker’s novel. Although the 1931 production was described by some reviewers as “stage-like,” Lugosi’s portrayal of the count was a chilling evocation of bloodcurdling terror. His accent and lilting voice made his articulation of the lines a memorable verse of literary fright. Four lines evoked the nuances of language and made them lasting pronouncements of impending doom: I am…Drac-u-la… I bid you welcome. Listen to them. Children of the night. What m-u-u-sic they make. I never drink… wi-i-i-ne. For one who has not lived even a single life time, you are a wise man, Van Helsing.\n\nA New York Times review by Hal Erickson notes that it is a classic horror ﬁlm and Bela Lugosi “…gives the performance of a life time.” Karl Freund, a German immigrant and talented cameraman, brought his aesthetic to the brooding imagery of Dracula. Many talented German ﬁlmmakers, including Freund, pioneered the visual elements of classic horror, and Freund worked with the 18\n\nThrough a Glass. . .

Murnau (Nosferatu), and Fritz Lang (Metropolis). Freund directed his ﬁrst feature for Universal, The Mummy, in 1932. For many, this classic set the tone and tenor for later horror ﬁlms and served as a benchmark for others to follow. It became a twentieth-century icon, lingering in a 19\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\ntimeless vault of terror without the vivid portrayal of “blood and guts” but instead the subdued deadly sense of lust dominated by a powerful force rendered on the screen.\n\nFRANKENSTEIN (1931) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: James Whale (director), Carl Laemmle, Jr. (producer) WRITER(S): Mary Shelley (novel), Peggy Webling (play) CAST: Colin Clive (Dr. Henry Frankenstein), Mae Clarke (Elizabeth), John Boles (Victor Moritz), Boris Karloff (The Monster), Edward Van Sloan (Dr. Waldman), Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein), Dwight Frye (Fritz), Lionel Belmore (Herr Vogel), Marilyn Harris (Little Maria) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Arthur Edeson, Paul Ivano (uncredited) MUSIC: Bernhard Kaun (uncredited) LENGTH AND RATING: 71 mins; NR\n\nThis ﬁlm, directed by James Whale, was also a product of Carl Laemmle’s Universal Pictures and its success, along with that of Dracula, helped to make the studio ﬁnancially solvent. Nonetheless, this was not the ﬁrst ﬁlm adaptation of Mary Shelley’s classic (1818) tale of horror. The ﬁrst, entitled Frankenstein, was a sixteen-minute silent ﬁlm released by the Edison Company and directed by J. Searle Dawley; the second was the ﬁrst Frankenstein silent feature-length ﬁlm Life Without a Soul (1915), directed by Joseph W. Smiley and produced by the Ocean Film Corporation. The 1931 ﬁlm starred Boris Karloff (who was born in England to a privileged family and whose real name was William Henry Pratt) as the Frankenstein monster. The role was a turning point in the actor’s career, although he was not credited at the opening of the ﬁlm. In addition, at the beginning of the ﬁlm a man in a tuxedo, Edward van Sloan, who plays the part of Dr. Waldman, appears from behind a curtain and admonishes the audience with a “friendly warning.” He tells them that the ﬁlm deals with, “…the two great mysteries of creation—life and death.” He goes on to say, “I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even horrify you.” Indeed, Frankenstein accommodated all of those emotions and became a classic in the genre of horror ﬁlms. When we ﬁrst see the monster, he gradually appears as a scarred and grotesque hulking ﬁgure, a ﬂawed copy of a human without a soul. There are chilling low-angle shots of a cemetery and its weathered tombstones, an archetypal image that became fundamental to the horror ﬁlm genre and other directors who used it to create foreboding and fear. The monster is a tragic ﬁgure rejected by his creator, and in one of the most poignant scenes in the ﬁlm he befriends the young girl Maria and they play together by a pond, tossing daisies onto the water. A child lost in her innocence, Maria has not learned to be frightened of the unknown. The two play together, touching hands, until the monster, seeing the petals ﬂoat on the water, throws Maria in, believing she will ﬂoat, and she subsequently drowns. The monster is childlike but deadly in his actions. In the original release of the ﬁlm, the drowning scene was cut, as it was considered too gruesome and not restored until the 1980s. In his New York Times Review of December 5, 1931, Mordaunt Hall revels in how much excitement the movie created among audiences in New York’s Mayfair Theatre. He writes: It is naturally a morbid, gruesome affair, but is something to keep the spectator awake, for during its most spine-chilling periods it exacts attention. No matter 20\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nwhat one may say about the melodramatic ideas here, there is no denying that it is far and away the most effective thing of its kind.\n\nAt Universal Studios, Jack Pierce, who became a master makeup artist, was responsible for the design and look of the Frankenstein monster. Although he did not work on Bela Lugosi’s makeup for the Dracula character, his work on the other characters in the ﬁlm earned him the coveted spot as the makeup designer and artist for Frankenstein. Pierce conceived the scar and the seal, along with the now famous neck bolts (which make sense as conductors of electricity). Frankenstein also had scarred, elongated hands and heavy eyelids. Under the talented hand of Pierce, Boris Karloff endured four hours of makeup each day, including the building up of his head with cotton collodion and gum, and toxic green paint on his face and hands to make him look pale on black-and-white ﬁlm. After Frankenstein, Pierce went on to do the makeup for The Mummy (1932) and various Frankenstein sequels. This ﬁlm helped to deﬁne and nurture the horror genre in ﬁlms, as there have been many iterations of Frankenstein, some referred to by that name or other incarnations such as Jason and Freddy. Its inﬂuence on generations of audiences cannot be diminished.\n\nI AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (1932) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Mervyn LeRoy, Hal B. Wallis (producer, uncredited) WRITER(S): Robert E.

Allen) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Sol Polito MUSIC: Bernhard Kaun (uncredited) LENGTH AND RATING: 93 mins; NR\n\nPerhaps one of the most socially conscious ﬁlms ever made about the prison system and the brutality of incarceration in the United States, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni and directed by Mervyn LeRoy, is a stark story about the harsh gulag-like conditions of a southern chain gang, where human beings are treated like chattel, guards are abusive, and life has no worth. It is an important ﬁlm because of the true story it is based on and the prison reforms it helped to initiate. The ﬁlm portrays the life and misfortune of Robert Elliott Burns, a World War I veteran who avoids returning to a factory job in New Jersey, leads a transient life traveling across the country looking for work during the Depression, and unknowingly becomes involved in a grocery store robbery with two other destitute men. The robbery nets only $5.80, and Burns is sentenced to six to ten years of hard labor. The movie is based upon his book, I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang. The Georgia reference was deliberately omitted so as not to identify the location of his brutish incarceration. In the movie, Paul Muni portrays James Allen based upon the Robert Burns character. After being sent to the chain gang and suffering its violent indignations, he escapes 21\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nafter several months by having a fellow inmate strike a blow to his leg shackles with a sledgehammer the prisoners use for crushing rock. While taking a bathroom break, he slips his feet out of the shackles and runs into the brush. As the guards and dogs chase him, Allen eludes them by submerging in a stream, breathing air through a hollow reed. He relocates to Chicago, ﬁnds a job at an engineering ﬁrm, and works his way up the corporate ladder. He also marries a woman who later turns him in when he asks her for a divorce so that he can be with another woman. Although the people and law enforcement ofﬁcials of Chicago support him, Allen decides to return to the chain gang in a deal that would require him to do “easy time” as a trustee for several months, and then be released. Upon his return, Georgia ofﬁcials renege on their promise and Allen is forced to serve the remainder of his term. He escapes again and now is desperately on the lam. In one of the most famous scenes in ﬁlm history, the end of the movie shows Allen in stark shadow, surreptitiously visiting his girlfriend Helen. She is upset that he hasn’t contacted her in the year since his escape. She pleads with him, but he must go. Finally she asks, “How do you live?” He replies from the darkness of the shadows: “I steal.”\n\nAnd then vanishes. Robert Burns did escape a second time and was found in Newark, New Jersey, whose governor refused to extradite him. Eventually he was pardoned. This movie, along with the book, created a national scandal over the corrupt and abusive Georgia chain gangs, and served as a catalyst for their eventual demise. It also served as a reference for later ﬁlms with similar themes, including The Deﬁant Ones (1958), Cool Hand Luke (1967), and O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000), and for the ABC network series The Fugitive.\n\nKING KONG (1933) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Merian C.

It is a spectacular story with a literary foundation, as in Beauty and the Beast; the hulking giant ape and the beautiful actress Fay Wray, with visual predatory sexual innuendo. She at ﬁrst invades his habitat on Skull Island, and he then rescues her from sacriﬁce by an indigenous tribe; he also protects her from 22\n\nThrough a Glass. . . Darkly, 1915–1938\n\nbeing a victim of repeated assaults by other animal predators. Eventually Kong is captured and returned to New York City, where he is relegated to “freak show” status as KING KONG EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD. On his opening night, Kong, unnerved by the ﬂash photography and thinking the “explosions” are harming his beloved Ann (Fay Wray), breaks loose from his hardened chrome shackles, ﬁnds Ann, and wreaks havoc on New York City. In one of the most enduring apoplectic scenes in movie history, Kong, who has placed Ann on a ledge at the top of the Empire State Building, is attacked by airborne biplane machine gunners (played by co-producers and directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack). Acknowledging his mortal wounds, Kong lifts Ann one last time, gazes at her beauty and gently strokes her, then returns her to the building’s ledge. He collapses and falls to the street below. While gazing at the giant ape, a police ofﬁcer says, “Well, Denham, the airplanes got him.” And Denham, played by actor Bruce Cabot, replies, “Oh, no. It wasn’t the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.” The ﬁlm was an enormous success, breaking box ofﬁce records and providing greatly needed revenue to the ailing RKO Studios. It was also a technically groundbreaking ﬁlm notable for its advances in rear screen projection, miniature models, and stop-motion animation sequences, supervised by chief technician Willis O’Brien. The screenplay was written by James Ashmore Creelman and Ruth Rose based on a story by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. When the ﬁlm was ﬁrst released, some sequences had to be cut due to the 1934 Production Code. These included scaling down from ﬁve to three victims of the brontosaurus killing, a giant spider scene, a scene where Kong begins to remove Fay Wray’s clothing, and Kong chewing one victim and dropping another from the Empire State Building. In the heading of his March 3, 1933, New York Times review, Mordaunt Hall describes King Kong as, “A Fantastic Film in Which a Monstrous Ape Uses Automobiles for Missiles and Climbs a Skyscraper.” There have been many incarnations of King Kong, most recently Peter Jackson’s 2005 three-hour remake starring Jack Black, Adrian Brody, and Naomi Watts as the Fay Wray character.\n\nIT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Frank Capra (director and producer), Harry Cohn (producer) WRITER(S): Samuel Hopkins Adams (story, “Night Bus”), Robert Riskin (screenplay) CAST: Clark Gable (Peter Warne), Claudette Colbert (Ellie Andrews), Walter Connolly (Alexander Andrews), Roscoe Karns (Oscar Shapeley), Jameson Thomas (King Westley), Alan Hale (Danker), Arthur Hoyt (Zeke), Blanche Friderici (Zeke’s wife), Charles C. Wilson (Joe Gordon) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Joseph Walker MUSIC: Howard Jackson (uncredited), Louis Silvers (uncredited) LENGTH AND RATING: 105 mins; NR\n\nFrank Capra was a master at capturing the innocence, virtues, and mores of small-town America, celebrating the character of the “little guy” going up against the wealthy. His ﬁlms were didactic but spoke to the audience, declaring their worth and essence as people when compared to the arrogance of the more afﬂuent. It Happened One Night possesses all of the rudiments of classic “screwball” comedy: a brash, spoiled, rich heiress 23\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\n(Claudette Colbert); a brazen, bold, down-on-his-luck newspaperman (Clark Gable); and a sundry of interesting and peculiar characters. It is indeed a road movie; she is running away from her father to consummate her marriage to a playboy husband whom her dad detests, and he has just been ﬁred from his newspaper for drinking. They both wind up on the same Greyhound bus from Miami to New York. She takes his seat, the last one on the bus, and they are forced to share on the ride. Their chemistry is initially repellant, each with a strong personality, dogmatic and independent. There are several classic scenes in this ﬁlm that richly describe the evolving relationship between Peter (Clark Gable) and Ellie (Claudette Colbert). He has taken on the role as her protector, but solely as a mercenary gesture to sell a story about her ﬂight. After they leave the bus, Peter registers them as Mr. and Mrs. in a motel, and as night falls, he strings a clothesline between the twin beds and hangs over it with a blanket, naming the partition the “walls of Jericho,” thus protecting Ellie’s chastity. In another scene, once Peter has ﬁnished arranging Ellie’s bed of hay in a deserted barn, she realizes that she is falling in love with him and he tries to hide similar feelings for her. In a very famous hitchhiking scene, Peter eloquently provides Ellie with a treatise on hitchhiking, and when he fails to stop a car she saunters to the side of the road, raises her dress to above her knee, and the next passing car screeches to a halt. The next evening, in another motel, Ellie breaches the walls of Jericho and submissively declares her love and devotion to Peter. After some misdirection and suspenseful distraction, Peter appears on Ellie’s wedding day to collect a debt from her father for expenses incurred on their trip, eventually admitting that he loves Ellie. As Ellie’s father walks her down the aisle to enter into a loveless marriage with her playboy “husband,” he whispers that Peter loves her and has an escape plan ready. When the minister begins reciting the marriage vows she shakes her head “no” and runs away, a “run away bride.” Ellie and Peter leave for Michigan, her ﬁrst marriage is annulled, and the “walls of Jericho” come tumbling down. The ﬁlm’s romantic theme and “battle of the sexes” one-upmanship gave audiences an escape from the drudgery of life during the Depression. Capra enables his audience to identify with ordinary people as Peter and Ellie encounter characters and situations viewers could ostensibly experience themselves. For example, Peter teaches Ellie how to properly dunk a doughnut. The ﬁlm was a sleeper hit in 1934 and won Academy Awards in the ﬁve categories in which it was nominated: Best Picture, Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), Best Director (Frank Capra), and Best Adaptation (Robert Riskin). The screenplay was adapted from a Cosmopolitan magazine story entitled Night Bus, by Samuel Hopkins Adams.\n\nMODERN TIMES (1936) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Charles Chaplin WRITER(S): Charles Chaplin CAST: Charles Chaplin (A factory worker), Paulette Goddard (A gamin), Henry Bergman (Cafe proprietor), Tiny Sandford (Big Bill), Chester Conklin (Mechanic), Hank Mann (Burglar), Stanley Blystone (Gamin’s father), Al Ernest Garcia (President of the Electro Steel Corp.), Richard Alexander (Cellmate), Cecil Reynolds (Minister) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Ira H.

[United Artists/Photofest]\n\nCharlie Chaplin is a revered ﬁgure in cinematic history because of his ability to ﬁnd humor in the pathos of the difﬁcult circumstances that effect ordinary people. He became a global icon as the ﬁrst actor to attract an international audience. His attire was symbolic of the down-and-out character of “the Tramp,” his signature role model. The Tramp was immediately recognizable, with his baggy pants, cut away coat and vest, frayed derby hat, and worn-out shoes. His success as an artist and entertainer provided him with the resources needed to exact complete control over his work, allowing him to produce, direct, write, and score his own movies. In addition, he was a founding member of the United Artists studio along with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and director D. W. Grifﬁth. During an eighteen-month world tour from 1931 to 1932, chaplin became acutely aware of the poverty, inequality, and suffering in the world. He was also concerned about the advance of technology and its impact upon the working class as a means toward unemployment. He publicly expressed his concern that machinery should beneﬁt humanity and not result in massive layoffs. Another issue that touched Chaplin was the use of addictive drugs. In Modern Times, the Tramp symbolizes the working class thrown into a world gone berserk with technology and efﬁciency. We see him as a mechanic armed with a wrench in each hand, tightening the giant gears in a factory assembly line. Even when he takes a break, his body gyrates with the lasting effects of the rhythm of his job. As the president of the company monitors the workplace on a movie screen, the Tramp 25\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nattempts to try a newfangled invention that would eliminate the lunch break and feed workers on the job. Of course, the Tramp is selected as the subject, and in a hilarious sequence Chaplin becomes a victim of the machine as it force-feeds him everything but his lunch. In another sequence, he is consumed by the machine and run through its gears, only to be released when the gears are placed in reverse. Eventually, the Tramp is driven crazy by the machine and he runs around the factory trying to tighten the buttons on the rear end of a woman and on the bosom of another female factory worker. After being released from a sanitarium and declared “cured,” the Tramp inadvertently picks up a red warning ﬂag that has fallen from a construction vehicle. He is then mistakenly identiﬁed as the leader of a communist party demonstration and is hauled off to jail. In jail, an inmate, in an effort to avoid detection of his cocaine, stores the white powder in a saltshaker. Of course, the Tramp uses it liberally on his food and as a result cannot walk in step back to his cell. The ﬁlm also addresses the social issues of poverty, unemployment, and the harshness of life in post-Depression America. In a parallel story line, which eventually coincides with the Tramp, a young woman, played by Paulette Goddard, must steal bread to feed her younger sisters and unemployed father. When her father is tragically shot in a riot, the child welfare authorities take her sisters away but she manages to escape. After release from prison on a letter of recommendation from the warden, the Tramp is unsuccessful at ﬁnding work and longs to return to a life of carefree incarceration. He meets the young woman as she is pursued by police for stealing a loaf of bread and pretends that he is the thief. In the end, though, the police arrest the girl. The Tramp then goes into a restaurant and orders a ﬁne meal, but refuses to pay. He is subsequently arrested and winds up in the same paddy wagon as the young lady. The wagon swerves, they fall out, and he joins her in an escape. As the two sit on a curb in a suburban community, they see a typical family and dream about how it would be if they shared that same good fortune. Throughout Modern Times there are symbolic metaphors that speak to the misfortune of others, the turbulence of the times with its strikes and riots, and the frantic pursuit to achieve the American dream. This ﬁlm demonstrates Chaplin’s commitment to articulating his concern over the ills of society. He couches those concerns on a canvas of humor while displaying a satirical view of the circumstances. The ﬁlm remains a timely reminder in the modern age of economic turmoil, with surging energy prices, failing banks, rampant outsourcing, and drained pension funds. Modern Times offers a satirical view of society’s ills, and while we laugh at the Tramp’s misadventures, we pull aside the veil of humor to see that those substantive societal issues of 1936 are still with us today.\n\nSNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS (1937) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: David Hand (director), Walt Disney (producer, uncredited) WRITER(S): Brothers Grimm (fairy tale), Ted Sears (story adaptation), Richard Creedon (story adaptation), Otto Englander (story adaptation), Dick Rickard (story adaptation), Earl Hurd (story adaptation), Merrill De Maris (story adaptation), Dorothy Ann Blank (story adaptation), Webb Smith (story adaptation) CAST: Roy Atwell (Doc, voice, uncredited), Stuart Buchanan (Huntsman, voice, uncredited), Adriana Caselotti (Snow White, voice, uncredited), Eddie Collins (Dopey, voice, 26\n\nThrough a Glass. . .

Smith LENGTH AND RATING: 83 mins; NR\n\nTheatrical ﬁlm animation holds a unique place in cinematic history and has been sustained as part of entertainment culture in the movies, on television, and across the Internet. One of the earliest pioneers was Max Fleischer of the Fleischer Studio, who used his creativity and technical virtuosity to do hybrid animation, integrating live action with animation. One of the most enduring of Fleischer’s cartoon characters was Betty Boop. Walt Disney learned from Fleischer about the branding of a particular animated character, which Fleischer had done so successfully with Betty Boop, and he also was taught a harsh lesson about protecting his intellectual property when one of his earliest cartoon characters, Oswald the Rabbit, was stolen from him. Oswald may have been the precursor to Mickey Mouse (Mickey has round ears). The rabbit also proved to be the ﬁrst in the juggernaut of merchandised Disney characters. In an ironic twist of fate, Walt Disney reacquired the rights to Oswald in 2006. Disney, along with his brother Roy, started their studio in 1923, and in 1928, with the release of Steamboat Willie, the ﬁrst talking animated movie, the Mickey Mouse character was introduced. It was a\n\nThe Seven Dwarfs and Snow White. [Walt Disney/Photofest] 27\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\ntimely introduction, as down-on-their-luck Depression-era audiences immediately embraced the cute mouse. Because Disney spent almost four years producing Snow White, his efforts to create the ﬁrst animated color feature ﬁlm were mocked by the industry. The ﬁlm cost $1.7 million to produce and was distributed by RKO Studios. The story was an adaptation of the classic fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, and Disney took liberties to make it less frightening for children. Although there are moments in the ﬁlm when Snow White is deeply afraid of her surroundings and feels threatened by the creatures in the forest, Disney brilliantly turns that fear into sheer enjoyment. The positive pro-social message is enhanced by the deft composition of the musical score and Snow White singing, “Whistle While You Work” while the Dwarfs march to “Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it’s off to work we go.” In an innovative stylistic departure, Disney gives each of the dwarfs his own personality that is cultivated through movement, voice, and dialogue. Indeed, this animated feature integrates human characters into the substance of the story, setting the tone and the image of subsequent animated feature-length ﬁlms. Although some critics argue that because of Disney’s resounding commercial success, along with his modernist sentimentality, his ﬁlms have little cultural signiﬁcance. However, Walt Disney’s ﬁlms do promote American idealism and the ethics of discipline and resourcefulness to overcome difﬁcult odds. He created a world of fantasy, allowing animals to talk and inanimate objects to be personiﬁed with human qualities, thus creating a canvas of virtues nurtured by things, animals and people that offer pragmatic lessons for life. His ﬁlms, especially Snow White, offered Depression-era audiences a respite via themes that imbued them with hope and resilience. His art was woven into the fabric of popular culture, and audiences had ready access to it within the mainstream of entertainment. Disney was a populist artist, and his audience continues to be sustained by the virtues he espoused.\n\n28\n\n2\n\nA Rumble to War, 1939–1942\n\nBy 1939, the world had felt the iron ﬁst of Hitler, and the Jews of Germany were being persecuted and turned away from safe haven. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed by Germany and Russia, articulated how the two countries would divide Eastern Europe among themselves. September 1939 was a busy month, with the Nazis attacking Poland and subsequently France, Austria, and the United Kingdom, which declared war on Germany while the United States remained neutral. Indeed, Great Britain, under the leadership of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, attempted to appease Hitler with the Munich Agreement, which he broke by invading Czechoslovakia. But 1939 also contained a rich treasure of American ﬁlms. These include Gone with the Wind, Stagecoach, and The Wizard of Oz. While these ﬁlms were conceived and began production prior to the upheaval of World War II, they were nevertheless viewed by American audiences within the context of troubling times.\n\nGONE WITH THE WIND (1939) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: Victor Fleming (director), David O.

Growing up in Atlanta, Mitchell heard stories of wizened Confederate veterans and their exploits during the Civil War. She left college in 1920, after her mother died, to take care of her family, 29\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nand scandalized Atlanta society by dancing provocatively with a young man at her debutante ball. She was also pursued by a number of men, marrying one and later divorcing to marry another. After her book was published and became a best seller, she wrote about upheaval, speciﬁcally how some people survive while others don’t, and the qualities and characteristics of those who manage to triumph, a quality she described as “gumption.” So I wrote about the people who had gumption and the people who didn’t (www. gwtw.org/margaretmitchell.html).\n\nIn his December 20, 1939, New York Times review of Gone with the Wind the movie, Frank Nugent described the sheer spectacle of the ﬁlm as pure narrative rather than great drama. He praised the ﬁlm as an unstinting version of the 1,037-page novel; indeed, the movie matched the book almost scene by scene. Nugent noted that all of the actors appeared to be embodiments of the characters in the novel, as though Mitchell had written their parts with them in mind. As a ﬁlm, Gone with the Wind demonstrates the value of popular epic cinema based on a beloved novel. Like D. W. Grifﬁth’s Birth of a Nation, it addresses the distinctive culture of the South, with its polite customs and social milieu that resonate in the ﬁery ashes of tragic defeat and a harsh resurrection. The ﬁlm has all the qualities of a blockbuster: a great cast, beautiful costumes, realistic sets, and the majesty of a bygone era beautifully ﬁlmed in Technicolor and accompanied by a resounding Max Steiner score. In 1936, the ﬁlm’s producer, David O. Selznick, paid Mitchell ﬁfty thousand dollars for the ﬁlm rights to her book—a very generous sum for a ﬁrst time author with a single publication. The movie cost $4 million and is estimated to have earned nearly $200 million. Five directors were associated with the ﬁlm: Sam Wood, George Cukor, William Cameron Menzies, B. Reeves (Breezy) Eason, and Victor Fleming, although Fleming received the only credit (he directed forty-ﬁve percent of the ﬁlm). About ﬁve percent of the ﬁnal version was directed by Cukor, but he left because he wasn’t pleased with the screenplay by Sidney Howard. After Fleming left the set due to exhaustion, Wood assumed the role of director for a short time. Both Menzies and Wood were credited with directing ﬁfteen percent of the ﬁlm, while Eason directed about two percent. Every frame of Gone with the Wind evokes a timeless vision of the Old South, colored by its vivid depiction of ladies and gentlemen dressed in the best silk and lace while mingling in the lavish surroundings of their plantations. It’s also about a love for the land and its vast stores of nature that provide a treasure of memories for the fantasy world of Tara. The scenes of devastation, such as the burning of Atlanta, were unfortunate harbingers of the terror to come, with cities like London burned by Nazi bombs. The movie addresses the enduring themes of struggle and survival during the Civil War, which became paramount in Europe during World War II. It is also a love story between people and with a way of life that had to end, including the deep connection to the land they cherished. But even more than a testimony to overcoming the hardships of civil war and the romantic interludes of the privileged, Gone with the Wind is an American ﬁlm about America, its past, its people, its history, and its culture. It is a timeless story of jealously, love, greed, and survival that unfolds during a period of American history that was romanticized in Mitchell’s novel. The ﬁlm, as historical 30\n\nA Rumble to War, 1939–1942\n\ncostume drama, sustains a relevance to each generation, and its stars have achieved iconic status in their roles. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable will forever be Scarlett and Rhett caught up in the turbulence of the time and frustrated by unrequited love. Note: In 1991, author Alexandra Ripley’s novel Scarlett was published as a sequel to Gone with the Wind, and in 1994 an eight-hour miniseries based on the novel was broadcast on the NBC television network. Mitchell’s timeless story was told in another authorized novel, “Rhett Butler’s People” by Donald McCaig, published in November 2007.\n\nSTAGECOACH (1939) PRODUCER/DIRECTOR: John Ford (director), Walter Wanger (producer) WRITER(S): Ernest Haycox (story), Dudley Nichols (writer) CAST: Claire Trevor (Dallas), John Wayne (The Ringo Kid), Andy Devine (Buck), John Carradine (Hatﬁeld), Thomas Mitchell (Doc Boone), Louise Platt (Lucy Mallory), George Bancroft (Marshal Curly Wilcox), Donald Meek (Samuel Peacock), Berton Churchill (Henry Gatewood), Tim Holt (Lt. Blanchard) CINEMATOGRAPHY: Bert Glennon MUSIC: Gerard Carbonara LENGTH AND RATING: 96 min; NR\n\nJohn Ford’s Stagecoach laid the narrative and visual foundation for the portrayal of the American western. As a director of westerns, Ford was acutely aware of the harshness of the frontier and the dangers that lurked in both civilized society and among the indigenous people (Native Americans) who gallantly fought to preserve their way of life. Prior to this ﬁlm, most westerns were relegated as “B” movies with a formulaic “cowboys and Indians” theme and lots of “dead Apaches” littering the landscape. But with Stagecoach, Ford created a character-driven narrative, placing seven very different people within the close quarters of an overland stagecoach departing for a two-day trip from Tonto, Arizona, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Before the characters embark on their journey, the audience is introduced to each and a theme of social status is quickly deﬁned; that dynamic slowly evolves as the stagecoach rambles toward its ﬁnal destination. The characters include Dallas (Claire Trevor), a prostitute driven out of town by the righteous women of the Ladies Law and Order League, and Josiah Boone, MD, (Thomas Mitchell), a drunkard physician evicted from his lodgings and also deemed undesirable. Another passenger on the stage who will continue on the journey to Lordsburg is Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), the young pregnant wife of a cavalry lieutenant, who is on her way to join him. Seemingly interested in Lucy is rakish fellow southerner Hatﬁeld (John Carradine), a former confederate ofﬁcer and now a scheming card shark. Joining them on the stagecoach is Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek), a whiskey salesman who is eagerly befriended by Doc Boone, who then generously helps himself to the samples in Peacock’s suitcase. During the movie, Peacock is mistaken as a preacher by the other characters, who also bungle the pronunciation of his name. Other characters that will interact aboard the stagecoach are the driver Buck Rickabaugh (Andy Devine), and Sheriff Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft), who agrees to ride shotgun as a way to confront and apprehend the escaped outlaw, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne). The Ringo Kid has broken out of the penitentiary to avenge the deaths of his 31\n\nBIGGER THAN BLOCKBUSTERS\n\nfather and brother, who were murdered by the Plummer boys. He boards the stagecoach en route after his horse goes lame. Without resisting, he is taken into custody by Sheriff Wilcox, an old family friend. Another character is banker Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill); he has stolen the $50,000 Wells Fargo payroll delivered by the stagecoach and is hoping to escape, knowing the telegraph wires have been cut and therefore word of his theft will not"
