        "text": "What was it about George C Scott, who has died aged 71, that made - after the age of 40 or so - being him seem such a weighty struggle against growing disbelief and anger? Some claimed he drank; others that he drank a lot. There was a widespread feeling that he could be wilful, headstrong, difficult, violent, dangerous, unmanageable and unreliable. If he had been charged with that list of handicaps, he was the sort of man to chuckle and groan and say, \"Of course - but what do you expect in a serious actor?\" He was serious, and stern-looking, but he had a rueful comic edge, too.\n\nScott was tall, dark and handsome, with an eagle's gaze - he was physically a good deal more commanding than General George Patton, the role with which he will always be associated. He had innate authority, intelligence, a fine speaking voice and something one had to call passion. He was only three years younger than Marlon Brando, and yet he was more richly equipped than Brando to challenge the great classical roles on stage. He was impressive as Antony and Shylock, but there should have been more. He might have been a giant, and it did seem in later years that he was wounded by having let down his great gifts.\n\nLong before the end, an unruly reputation had affected the work available to him. By the late 1970s and 1980s, he had become a faded grand actor, sometimes on stage or film, but more often in TV movies and specials. Even though, 25 years earlier, after the valiant, realistic East Side/West Side (in which he played an idealistic social worker) had failed, he had vowed he would never do a TV series again.\n\nHe was a man of famous vows and compromised stances - after all, he was married five times, always to actresses, by whom he had five children. Two of these marriages were with Colleen Dewhurst who matched him in seeming larger than life. By some sweet mystery, their son, Campbell Scott, turned out an uncommonly subtle and delicate actor.\n\nScott was born in Wise, Virginia, and raised in the Detroit, Michigan, area. In the last year of the war, he went into the Marine Corps and served four years. He then went to the University of Missouri where he studied English and drama. It was only then that he saw acting as a possible career.\n\nIn 1956, he had a notable success playing Richard III for the New York Shakespeare Festival. For several years he was active in off-Broadway productions; he was in a revival of Edwin Justus Mayer's Children of Darkness (1958), with Colleen Dewhurst, and he played the Judge Advocate in The Andersonville Trial (1959).\n\nSoon enough he was recruited for television and the movies. In 1958, for CBS, he played Sydney Carton in a production of A Tale of Two Cities, and the next year he made his big screen debut as the villain in one of Gary Cooper's last Westerns, The Hanging Tree. At the same time, he was a match for James Stewart's sly country lawyer, playing the prosecutor from Lansing, in Otto Preminger's Anatomy of a Murder (1959). His whiplash quietness in that film, his icy politeness, and the lethal competitiveness made him seem like a veteran in the midst of a very assured cast.\n\nBut that was as nothing compared with his pool-hall gangster in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), a man whose loathsome exploitation of others never masks his intelligence. There is a moment in that film, during the first great contest between Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason, when Scott looks at Newman's character and calls him \"a loser\" with such decisive finality that his game begins to crumble.\n\nScott earned supporting-actor Oscar nominations for both Anatomy of a Murder and The Hustler (shamefaced history has to admit that Hugh Griffith won for Ben-Hur and George Chakiris for West Side Story in the years concerned - a time at which Scott might have accepted the statuette).\n\nHe was a star, but not always very sensible in the years of glory. On Broadway, he appeared in The Little Foxes (1967) and in the three male roles in Neil Simon's Plaza Suite (1968), the latter a smash hit. On television, he was the policeman to Olivier's priest in a version of Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory (1961). Then, after East Side/West Side, he played the lead in television versions of two Arthur Miller plays, The Crucible (1967) and The Price (1971). The latter won him an Emmy, but he declined the award.\n\nIn the movies, his roles went beyond easy explanation. He was in John Huston's lame The List of Adrian Messenger (1963); he was one of many stars in The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964); but he was brilliant and funny as General \"Buck\" Turgidson, aridly obsessed with his bodily fluids, in Stanley Kubrick's Dr Strangelove (1964). He was Abraham in Huston's The Bible (all the while romancing his Sarah, Ava Gardner). He was in a fatuous romantic comedy, Not With My Wife, You Don't! (1966), but he was very clever playing a confidence trickster in The Flim-Flam Man (1967).\n\nThen came his best work as a lead in movies: he was the divorced man in love with Petulia (1968), the movie that established his status as a figure of reason and caring beaten down by the chaos of rapid change. His earlier, abrasive edge felt older and sadder now, and his presence held Richard Lester's ambitious film together.\n\nThen, two years later, for Franklin Schaffner, he was Patton, the controversial second world war general. It was a great part, very well written by Francis Coppola and Edmund H North. But it needed Scott's profoundly romantic and Roman air, and it helped expose a lonely autocrat in the actor.\n\nWhen he was nominated as best actor, he asked the Academy to be excluded. In fact, he had made the same request at the time of The Hustler nomination. Some said he had been so disappointed at not winning for Anatomy of a Murder that he became soured by the whole business of awards. Now, he said that the Oscar race was \"offensive, barbarous and innately corrupt\". He told the Academy that he would not attend the 1970 awards, and there was controversy in advance, topped off by Goldie Hawn's \"Oh my God! The winner is George C Scott!\" when she opened the envelope. Brando sent an \"Indian maiden\" two years later, to decline on his behalf, but that was on other, political grounds. Scott was the first to make so complete a disavowal of the contest. He was honoured for that, yet no one who knew him thought the less of his competitive urge.\n\nHe played Rochester opposite Susannah York's Jane Eyre, and also in 1971, he was the eccentric who believes he is Sherlock Holmes in Anthony Harvey's They Might Be Giants (with Joanne Woodward as his Watson). That movie could easily have collapsed as pretentious whimsy. That it remains gently comic, but true to derangement, is because of the mercurial flights in Scott's performance. The movie was not a success, but he was never more electric or tragic - and the very tricky role required an actor of unquestioned refinement. The same year, he was nominated once more as best actor for The Hospital - directed by Arthur Hiller, and written by Paddy Chayefsky - where he is the last spokesman for humane order in a system that is breaking down. Seldom have noble exhaustion and demented idealism been better conveyed on film.\n\nHis third and fourth marriages (1960-65 and 1967-72), both to Colleen Dewhurst, ended. He married for a fifth time to a seemingly more pliant actress, Trish Van Devere. Yet inwardly he seemed to become wilder, or harder to contain. In 1970, he had directed The Andersonville Trial for television, and in 1972 he directed and starred in the movie Rage (about a rancher who seeks vengeance against the stupid system). Then in 1974, he directed The Savage is Loose (a melodrama involving incest). Both movies flopped, and Scott was left embittered - he had always prided himself on abilities and insights beyond those of most actors. But in the same period, he did remarkable work on stage: Astrov in Uncle Vanya (1973); Willy Loman in a revival of Death of a Salesman (1975); and another rich comic triumph as Foxwell J Sly in Larry Gelbart's reworking of Volpone, Sly Fox (1976).\n\nHis acting in movies began to decline, however. He had one great suicidal scene as a cop in The New Centurions (1972); he was amusing in Oklahoma Crude (1973), a modern Western about oil; he talked credibly to dolphins in The Day of the Dolphin (1973); and he made a respectable attempt at being Hemingway in Schaffner's movie Islands in the Stream (1977). But most of his films were inconsequential.\n\nScott's last great test was the Calvinist father who pursues his runaway daughter into the world of pornographic film-making in Paul Schrader's Hardcore (1979). His performance was erratic; he seemed bored or lost at times, but the moment when he has to watch film of his daughter was heart-rending.\n\nAfter that, his movies were beyond rhyme or reason - The Changeling (1980); The Formula (1980); another military commander in Taps (1981); Firestarter (1984); Exorcist III (1990); and a supporting role in Malice (1993). He had better opportunities on television where he played Fagin in Oliver Twist (1982); Scrooge in A Christmas Carol (1984); il Duce in Mussolini: The Untold Story (1985); and a forlorn reprise of old glory in The Last Days of Patton (1986). He was dogged by illness and even when he had a Broadway success, and a Tony nomination, in a revival of Inherit the Wind (1996), he missed many performances of his own show.\n\nA good biography of Scott might make fascinating reading. He was maybe his own worst enemy, but he was a battler and an actor of rare courage. People still talk about the disastrous Actors Studio production of The Three Sisters, in London, in which Scott played Vershinin. The critics were merciless. Next day, the director and the head of the studio, Lee Strasberg, assembled the cast to tell them the critics were correct. He began a diatribe against his own people. But Scott stood up, confronted the great tyrant of American acting, and silenced him with a colourful, violent speech about taking the director's responsibility. Then, it is said, he went off to get drunk with Ava Gardner. He was so commanding, yet he was an outcast, too."
