Prawer describes terror as the ‘principal ingredient’ of horror, while James B. Twitchell claims that the source of horror ‘is always in dreams, while the basis of terror is in actuality’.1 Twitchell’s distinction suggests that imagination is involved in horror, while terror is produced by empirical perception; but this is virtually the opposite of dictionary definitions, which tend to identify horror with an almost physical loathing and terror with the more imaginative and anticipatory sense of dread. Terror in the past was associated with the transcendent, the awesome, and the Romantic notion of the sublime, while horror was seen to involve mere loathing or repugnance.2 Certainly, Stephen King distinguishes between the two in his book Danse Macabre when he remarks that ‘I recognise terror as the finest emotion … and so I will try to terrorise the reader. But if I find I cannot terrify him/her, I will try to horrify; and if I find I cannot horrify, I’ll go for the gross out. I’m not proud.’3 Yet whether we choose to define the kinds of responses sought by horror films as horror or terror – not to mention fear, suspense, disgust, revulsion – the horror film (the genre’s very name points to its intended affect) addresses fears that are, on the one hand, both universal (torture, death) and, on the other, that respond to historically and culturally specific anxieties (for example, atomic radiation in the 1950s, environmental contamination in the 1970s and 1980s, and terrorism and digital technology in the new millennium). As King writes in Danse Macabre, horror ‘is extremely limber, extremely adaptable, extremely useful’.4 As is true of every genre, individual works of horror may endorse or undermine our conventional views – in this case, of what is monstrous, and what isn’t – whether deliberately or unintentionally. But whatever the particular fears addressed by specific horror films, overall the genre provides viewers with vicarious but controlled thrills, pitting something we regard as monstrous against our sense of normalcy,5 and in so doing offer a release, a catharsis, of our collective and individual fears. Horror texts exist across a range of media – fiction, comic books, television, video and table games, popular music, and so on. But the medium of cinema is especially conducive to horror. If it is true that the sleep of reason produces monsters, it is also true that, as many have pointed out, the experience of film viewing is very much like dreaming. In the dark, images flicker by that speak to our inner self as well as to our collective psyche. And while some regard the act of film viewing as a sort of regression to a womblike, infantile state, it is perhaps more accurate to say that we watch movies both absorbed and detached, passive and active – as if in dreams awake, to quote Thoreau.6 Thus, it is not surprising that while other film genres have cycled in and out of popularity, horror has been consistently present in one form or another throughout film history. With roots in such pre-cinematic forms as medieval woodcuts, Grand Guignol theatre, and the Gothic novel, horror transitioned to film in the one-reelers of Georges Méliès, the first pioneer of fantastic cinema. By 1903 Méliès already had made films 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 1\n\n1\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\nwith monsters, ghosts, devils, and other assorted spirits – all creatures that were to become central to the horror film as it would develop over time. Many countries have developed substantial and distinctive horror film styles. One thinks immediately of German expressionist cinema in the 1920s, Italian giallo in the postwar period, Hammer horror in the U.K. a decade later. There are also strong horror traditions in the national cinemas of Japan, Mexico, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand, among other countries. In recent years, horror films from around the world have become more familiar to international audiences due to the rise of global film distribution companies, increased multinational film financing, and streaming and other digital capabilities. Nevertheless, the United States has been extraordinarily prolific in the production of horror films, and many have been successful and influential around the world. At the same time as horror addresses universal themes, the genre is also firmly rooted in the American national character – in its history, its values, its crises. Critics have long noted that horror and violence have been integral to the American experience and the American psyche ever since the first European settlers arrived and began to wrest the land away from the indigenous peoples, cloaked in the nationalist myths of the westward course of empire and Manifest Destiny. D. H. Lawrence was indeed accurate when, in his discussion of Fenimore Cooper’s Hawkeye, the first American mythic hero, he famously speculated that ‘the essential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic, and a killer’. Beginning with the Puritan settlers, Americans created a cultural myth – so pervasive in the American psyche that it has been termed the national ‘monomyth’ – of a communal Eden that must be redeemed by what Richard Slotkin has called a ‘regeneration through violence’.8 Central to this national project has been the demonization of the Other, evident already in the Puritan captivity narratives in which the unfortunate narrators were forced to live unchristian lives while ‘possessed’ by their swarthy Native American abductors. This demonization is evident in the western’s depiction of ‘Indians’ as savages – whether lustful or noble – and surfaces with equal vehemence in the cavalry officer of The Burrowers* (2008) as it does in Ethan Edwards in The Searchers (1956). In his monumental study of American literature, Leslie Fiedler describes American fiction as ‘essentially a gothic one … a tradition of dealing with the exaggerated and the grotesque, not as they are verifiable in any external landscape or sociological observation of manners and men, but as they correspond in quality to our deepest fears and guilts as projected in our dreams.’9 Fiedler shows how American writers, beginning with Charles Brockden Brown, adapted the conventions of the gothic novel to the American context, replacing, for example, the lustful nobleman with the Indian and the castle with the forest. Already the forest issues forth the monstrous, like the return of the repressed, in a remarkable passage in J. Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur’s Letters from an American Farmer in 1782. Leisurely strolling through the woods in the South on his way to an acquaintance’s home for dinner, the author, an astute French observer of the American character, suddenly comes across a black man hanging in a cage from a tree. ‘The birds had already picked out his eyes, his cheek bones were bare’, writes Crèvecoeur, anticipating the moment when Lydia Brenner discovers the body of her neighbour Dan Fawcett after an avian attack in The Birds* (1963). Director Alfred Hitchcock’s series of jump cuts to the man’s hollowed-out eye sockets expresses a comparable shock to Crèvecoeur’s sudden ‘alarm’. But the scene also expresses the tensions of America’s slave legacy and 2\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 2\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\nthe racial fears expressed in horror films from King Kong* (1933) to Get Out* (2017). The link to Candyman* (1992) is particularly striking given that after Crèvecoeur chases the birds away, ‘swarms of insects covered the whole body of this unfortunate wretch, eager to feed on his mangled flesh and drink his blood.’10 Philip Freneau’s 1779 poem ‘The House of Night’ is remembered today as prophetic in articulating American culture’s embrace of the gothic: Let others draw from smiling skies their theme, And tell of climes that boast unfading light, I draw a darker scene, replete with gloom, I sing the horrors of the House of Night.11\n\nThis sense of lurking horror informs so much of American culture, at least since Jonathan Edwards preached that people were ‘Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God’ (1741), dangling precariously and at His whim ‘Over the pit of hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the fire.’12 It informs the fiction of Washington Irving, Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ambrose Bierce, H. P. Lovecraft, and many other writers. It is there along with the evocation of the sublime in the paintings of the Hudson River School, in the revels of the Jazz Age, in the contemporary drive to build a border wall. One sees ‘a darker scene’ in the haunted faces of the common folk photographed by Walker Evans and Weegee, or those collected by Michael Lesy in Wisconsin Death Trip (1973). For David J. Skal, Diane Arbus’s photographs of odd-looking people revealed that ‘“monsters” were everywhere, that the whole of modern life [might be] viewed as a tawdry sideshow… America, it seemed, was nothing but a monster show.’ 13 As Donald Barthelme writes in his short story ‘The Policemen’s Ball’: ‘The horrors waited outside patiently. Even policemen, the horrors thought. We get even policemen, in the end.’14 Many of the one hundred horror films discussed in this book explore those basic and universal fears alluded to above – bodily violation, loss of will, death – but most are also unmistakably American, speaking to the American experience in some way. They respond to the American landscape, both human and natural; to the nation’s triumphs and travails; its cultural trends and tests; its ideological values and the perceived threats to them. Like science fiction, horror also speaks to social and technological innovation and change, translating our concerns into concrete bugaboos. Together, the films discussed in these pages offer a dark chronicle of American history and culture, a house of night to balance the shining city on the hill. As with my previous 100 Science Fiction Films, also published by the British Film Institute, in choosing the films to include here I have sought to be broadly inclusive on several levels. Chronologically, the titles range from the silent period to the contemporary. Their varied production contexts include major studio releases, B films, international co-productions, and independent features. The various subgenres and types of horror are represented: gothic horror, found-footage horror, folk horror, eco-horror, body horror, survival horror; torture porn; haunted houses and home invasions; parody and slapstick; and so on. As well, the various types of horror monsters are accounted for, including mummies, mutants, and mad scientists; serial killers, psychos, 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 3\n\n3\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\nand Satanists; creatures and crazies; devils and demons; plants and poltergeists; ghosts and ghouls; vampires, werewolves, and zombies. I have also included significant and representative films by important directors and producers associated with the genre from Tod Browning and James Whale to Jordan Peele and Robert Eggers, films adapted from and by authors whose work has been important to horror from Bram Stoker and H.P. Lovecraft to Stephen King and Anne Rice, and iconic stars from Lon Chaney to Jamie Lee Curtis. In most cases where a horror film has been sufficiently successful to generate sequels, series, or franchise, I have focused on the first film for being foundational (and almost always more interesting). Some films – Phantom of the Paradise (1974), for example, or Fatal Attraction (1987) – have been included in part because of the ways they stretch our conception of what a horror film is. The inclusion of films such as The Frighteners (1996) and Let Me In (2010), the former made outside of America and the latter an adaptation of a Swedish horror film, show American horror as a dynamic cultural site with influence flowing in both directions. Indeed, drawing so much from such traditions as German expressionist cinema and British and European literature, American horror, like the nation itself, is a vast melting pot – one always in danger of boiling over. Some films that are widely considered as both horror and science fiction were included in 100 Science Fiction Films, so I have not included them here: Island of Lost Souls (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), Alien (1979), They Live (1988), Prince of Darkness (1987), The Cabin in the Woods (2012), both versions of The Thing (1951, 1982). Because that earlier book contains an entry on Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), I have included here Philip Kaufman’s 1978 remake; and because Frankenstein (1931) appears there, The Bride of Frankenstein (1935) does here. I regret the omission of some other important horror films, including some personal favourites, that, for one reason or another as I attempted to work out a representative balance, did not make it into the book, among them The Most Dangerous Game (1932), The Black Cat (1934), Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), Invisible Invaders (1959), Night Tide (1961), Dawn of the Dead (1978), Love at First Bite (1979), Dracula (1979), Dressed to Kill (1980), The‑Funhouse (1981), Wolfen (1981), Cujo (1983), The Stuff (1985), The People under the Stairs (1991), The Sixth Sense (1999), Hellbenders (2003), Drag Me to Hell (2009), Hereditary (2018), Mandy (2018), and Us (2019). All of the above having been said, I do recognise that no list like this will satisfy everyone – especially in the case of horror, whose aficionados are intensely committed to a degree characteristic of no other genre. What other genres can boast of such a network of magazines and journals, games, blogs, conventions and social events like zombie walks? I have no doubt that readers will find omissions that seem grievous and inexplicable, but at the same time hope they will approve of the overall selection. The majority of films discussed are acknowledged as classics or as having had significantly influenced the genre’s development (and my own thinking about the genre), although such lists are of course always in process. Each entry in this guide considers why the specific film being discussed is a horror film, mentions relevant production information, discusses the importance of its place within the history of the genre, and offers some analysis of its most salient textual features and themes. Within the short space of each entry, I have sought to provide a sense of established critical opinion and original insight in accessible, succinct, and sometimes – I hope – witty prose. Where relevant, the film is also contextualised within American culture and history, as well as the director’s, writer’s, or featured actor’s other work. I confess to auteurist and psychoanalytic inclina4\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 4\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\ntions. In some cases, plot descriptions involve spoilers, but these were unavoidable for any serious discussion about those films. References in entries to other films that are also included in the book are indicated with an asterisk (*), and each entry includes a list of up to five recommendations for further reading about that film, director, actor, subgenre, or theme.\n\nNotes 1.

A bold updating of the vampire film, The Addiction was written by Nicholas St. John, who has worked on the scripts of several other films directed by Abel Ferrara, including the rape-revenge film Ms. 45 (1981), the gangster film King of New York (1990), and the director’s two other horror films, The Driller Killer (1979) and Body Snatchers (1993), the third adaptation of Jack Finney’s 1955 novel of the same name. Although The Addiction was shot in gritty black-and white, the film blurs and problematises any clear distinction between good and evil. Kathleen Conklin (Taylor) is a graduate student studying philosophy, specifically the question of evil and human nature, at New York University. After being attacked by a woman on the street (Sciorra) and bitten on the neck, she begins to turn into a vampire, her demeanor becoming more aggressive as her worldview regarding evil also begins to evolve. One night prowling the streets for a victim, she meets Peina (Ferrara favourite Walken), who tells her that he has learned to manage his vampirism so that he is almost human in behaviour. Peina refers to the urge to drink blood as a ‘fix’ and urges her to read Naked Lunch (1959), the controversial novel about drug addiction by William Burroughs (adapted to film in 1991 by David Cronenberg), an author who also was an addict, to help her learn to exert her will against her need. Kathleen dismisses the study of philosophy as irrelevant and incapable of confronting the fundamental truth of human evil, realizing that now she cannot escape what Burroughs calls ‘the algebra of need’ – the unquenchable drive for a fix over any rational objection. Kathleen comes to view her bloodsucking as a co-dependency, a collaboration between vampire and victim, even inviting those she attacks first to insist that she leave (a twist on the traditional convention of the vampire having to be invited in). But they do not – an act she understands as her victims’ need to connect with the human capacity for evil in a world in which it has been largely repressed and people are merely amusing themselves to death. Kathleen’s irreducible vampirism even presents her with a way of understanding the previously incomprehensible evil of the Holocaust. The dialogue is laden with philosophical snippets – Santayana on history, Kierkegaard’s Sickness unto Death, Nietzsche’s ‘will to power’, Sartre’s Being and Nothingness, this last after Kathleen discovers she has no reflection in the mirror – shards of thought that float through the film like bits of cut-up text in the manner of Burroughs’s writing. The black and white cinematography evokes the corrupt milieu of film noir, with garbage and graffiti marking the city streets and indicating the fallen world Kathleen contemplates. In the climax, after she finishes and defends her dissertation, Kathleen unleashes an orgy of vampiric bloodletting at the reception in her honor with the help of all her previous victims (‘I’d like to share a little bit of what I learned through my long hard years of study’, she announces) in a vivid demonstration of her disillusionment with the abstractions of philosophy in the face of real evil ( in her words, ‘essence is revealed through praxis’).

Brett Easton Ellis’s satirical and controversial 1991 novel of the same name upon which American Psycho is based was attacked for its explicit misogynistic violence, a charge also levelled against the film adaptation. An entry in the serial killer cycle, the film, like the novel, is also a killer comedy of manners that targets the narcissism of the ‘Me Generation’ and the ‘80s culture of materialism. While Gordon Gekko may claim in Wall Street (1987) that ‘Greed is good’, in American Psycho it is, to the contrary, quite evil. The plot follows Bateman, a wealthy New York investment banker who spends his time hanging out at fashionable bars and restaurants with his colleagues, all of whom seem interchangeable with similar hairstyles and tailored suits, and the same inane banter that consistently confuses each other’s identities.

As in the novel, Bateman provides lengthy monologues (voiceovers in the film) regarding the products he uses during his morning ablutions and reviews of pop rock of the period (Robert Palmer, Genesis), the latter often accompanying scenes of physical violence. Bateman’s killings and assaults of women are grotesquely graphic exaggerations, overtly monstrous depictions, of the treatment of women and fear of them within Bateman’s overwhelmingly masculine culture. Like the money he supposedly manages at work, women are regarded merely as objects of exchange. The title of American Psycho obviously refers to Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho* (1960) – it was Hitchcock, after all, who famously said that a sure way to create suspense was to ‘torture the women!’ – and the film contains the same kind of dark humour. Bateman quotes Ed Gein, the serial killer who partially inspired Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel Psycho, on which Hitchcock’s film was based, to the effect of imagining what a woman’s head would be like on a stick, and later we glimpse several decapitated female heads in his refrigerator. It is hardly surprising that Bateman watches The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* (1974) while working out. It is only near the end of the film, when an ATM gives Bateman the message ‘feed me a stray cat’, that we realise that some or all of the violence we have witnessed may have been played out in Bateman’s imagination rather than actuality. The wild shootout with police that follows, in which he manages to spectacularly explode two patrol cars with a pistol, even to his own surprise, and his secretary’s discovery of a notebook in his office desk filled with drawings of sexual violence being done to women’s bodies (no comparable scene exists in the novel) encourages such a reading. Willem Dafoe provides a perfect balance of mundanity and menace to his perfor-\n\n10\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 10\n\nmance of detective Donald Kimball, who is investigating the death of the perceived rival Bateman murdered, that resonates with a similar ambiguity: like Bateman, we never know whether he knows more than he is saying, whether he is just odd or playing cat-and-mouse with Bateman, baiting him. Bateman is the perfect example of the waning of affect and ‘depthlessness’ that is often said to characterise postmodern consciousness. Indeed, he describes himself as empty, a pure product of popular culture. But the film also makes its political implications clear when, in the final scene, Bateman and colleagues discuss whether President Reagan is a harmless old man or a secret psychopath. With the values of Reaganomics, and the wealth and privileges it can bring, the film’s answer is clear. In a penthouse apartment, no one can hear you scream.\n\nFurther Reading: Grant, Barry Keith. ‘American Psychosis: The Pure Products of America Go Crazy’.

Released the same year as Joe Dante’s The Howling and Michael Wadleigh’s Wolfen, the film’s title alludes to the 1951 Vincente Minnelli musical An American in Paris with Gene Kelly, but also to Henry James’s 1877 novel The American. Indeed, the film invokes James’s favourite theme of contrast between the Old World and the New, here cast in the form of a werewolf movie.\n\nDIRECTOR John Landis PRODUCER George Folsey, Jr. SCREENPLAY John Landis CINEMATOGRAPHY Robert Paynter EDITOR Malcolm Campbell MUSIC Elmer Bernstein PRODUCTION COMPANY Polygram Pictures, The Guber-\n\nPeters Company MAIN CAST David Naughton,\n\nJenny Agutter, Griffin Dunne, John Woodvine\n\n100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 11\n\n11\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\n(A sequel, An American Werewolf in Paris [1997], involves another American tourist and the daughter of the couple in Landis’ movie.) The corruption of the Old World takes the form of superstition, and like James’s Christopher Newman, the American learns too late an unfortunate truth about evil. Two young American men, David Kessler (Naughton) and Jack Goodman (Dunne), are backpacking across the Yorkshire moors when we first see them getting out of a farmer’s truck filled with sheep – innocent but brash American lambs to the slaughter. They stop at a local pub, ominously named the Slaughtered Lamb, where the locals are strangely hostile, one making jokes about Americans and John Wayne in The Alamo (1960), at which everyone laughs – until Jack asks about the meaning of the pentagram on the wall. After the attack by the werewolf on the moors, when David is recovering in hospital, his nurse, Alex Price (Agutter), reads to him from Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (1889), another story about a brash American abroad. Throughout the film David’s youthful exuberance is contrasted with British reserve, as when, trying to get arrested before he kills again, he shouts insults about the Queen in Trafalgar Square while a small crowd quietly watches and a policeman asks him politely to control himself. Even as David’s werewolf kills are gory, featuring dismembered hands and decapitated heads, the film plays with the genre’s conventions, as in the requisite pub scene. Jack immediately recognises the pentagram in the pub as the same as the one in The Wolf Man* (1941), and the two discuss ‘The Hounds of the Baskervilles’ as they trek across the moors. Yet the film doesn’t hesitate to rewrite werewolf mythology, with the rotting souls of David’s victims unable to rest in peace until David dies and the werewolf’s bloodline is broken. In the climax, David terrorises Piccadilly Circus, the first monster to stalk there since Gorgo (1961). Jack’s visitations to David as a ghost (each time in a more advanced state of decomposition), are presented\n\n12\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 12\n\nin an appositely deadpan manner as he urges David to kill himself (‘I’m not having any fun here’), as are the several suggestions for the best way to do it by the undead souls of David’s victims, who gather in the porn theatre where he takes refuge. And, of course, the film knowingly ups the ante on the transformation scenes, the money shots of the werewolf film, relying on pre-digital special effects by Rick Baker, whose many professional credits, beginning with The Exorcist* (1973), include The Frighteners* [1996] and the reboot of The Wolf Man, The Wolfman [2010]). Rather than a series of superimpositions with increasingly hirsute makeup on a mostly motionless actor’s hand or face, David’s transformations feature close-ups of limbs changing shape, snout thrusting forward, and fangs descending from a feral mouth, earning Baker an Academy Award for makeup.\n\nFurther Reading de Blécourt, Willem, ed.

Griffith came to the cinema from theatre, his sensibility more attuned to the mode of melodrama than Grand Guignol (although, among the literally hundreds of short films he directed was One Exciting Night in 1922, an entry in the ‘old dark house’ formula popular at the time, and the second version of The Sorrows of Satan in 1926). After leaving Biograph in 1913, Griffith moved to Mutual, which evolved into Reliance-Majestic, bringing many of his regular actors and crew with him. The Avenging Conscience, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe’s story ‘The Tell-Tale Heart’ (1843) and the poem ‘Annabel Lee’ (1849), is one of four films he made for the studio. Years earlier Griffith had directed Edgar Allan Poe (1909) for Biograph, a one-reeler made on the occasion of the centennial of Poe’s birth that, taking historical liberties, shows the writer composing ‘The Raven’ while his young wife Virginia lay in bed nearby dying of tuberculosis. In The Avenging Conscience the director more ambitiously aspires to convey the abstract and overwhelming guilt of Poe’s protagonist in visual terms. In the plot a young man (Walthall) falls in love with a woman, ‘she whom he calls Annabelle’ (Sweet), but he is prevented from marrying her by his stern uncle (Aitken), who insists he spend his time working instead. The nephew’s imagination grows morbid from reading Poe, and soon ‘the plan of a fevered brain’ begins to take shape. At first thinking to shoot his uncle, the obstacle to his happiness, he instead strangles him, choking off his voice, and seals his body behind the fireplace. The young man begins to grow increasingly mad, the ghost of his uncle emerging from the fireplace or through the open window in double exposure and pointing at him accusingly. Griffith employs the stuff of cinema (he was only a year away from finishing The Birth of a Nation [1915]) to fine effect when the nephew descends into guilt and madness. We see the man’s tormented visions of Jesus and Moses (bearing the commandment of the film’s subtitle) and ghouls crawling in the steaming flames of hell. Griffith frames the long shots of the man in an iris in the lower right corner surrounded by black, a graphic representation of the mental darkness and isolation closing in on him. Earlier, when the man was reading, Griffith showed a close-up of the beginning of Poe’s story in which the narrator describes his extreme acuteness of the senses, and now, when the man is being questioned by the police detective and is about to crack and confess, Griffith assembles a powerful montage of close-ups of the detective, the man, his fidgeting hands, the ticking clock, a tapping pencil, all at an increased tempo – a fever pitch, as it were. The climax looks at first like one of Griffith’s distinctive last-minute rescues, with the man, now desperate and holed up in a shack with a mob in pursuit, about to hang himself while ‘Annabelle’ runs to him to announce her undying love and save him. But, atypically, she arrives too late, and in despair she hurls herself off a cliff into the ocean, dying, in a sense, in a ‘kingdom by the sea’. Griffith suggests that the man’s mur100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 13\n\nDIRECTOR D. W. Griffith PRODUCER D. W. Griffith SCREENPLAY D. W.

But Griffith’s sentimentality triumphs in the end, and we discover that it’s all been only a nightmare brought on by reading Poe. Uncle is alive and now happily blesses his nephew’s union, and the film ends with images of the couple blissfully united while Pan and his wood nymphs frolic in images that might have been filmed by Ken Russell. 14\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 14\n\nFurther Reading: Clarens, Carlos.

While the director’s other horror films, Psycho and Frenzy (1972), focus on human monsters, The Birds uses the fantastic threat posed by these common winged creatures also to explore human nature in an early example of ecological horror. Well before CGI, The Birds posed enormous technical challenges, ultimately requiring hundreds of effects shots to make it seem as if actors and animals are occupying the same space and using an electronic score rather than conventional music to create the sound of the birds’ chittering. As the film begins, Melanie Daniels (Hedren) flirtatiously pursues lawyer Mitch Brenner (Taylor) from the San Francisco pet shop where they first meet to the small town of Bodega Bay, where he lives with his daughter, Cathy (Cartwright), and possessive mother, Lydia (Tandy). The scene introduces the film’s elaborate motif of cages, traps, and entrapment, both physical and emotional. The first bird attack is a quick swoop of a small gull that pecks Melanie in the head and draws blood, bringing Mitch to her aid. As the attacks persist, Melanie and the Brenners are forced to barricade themselves in the house, now prisoners of the birds and a reversal of the situation in the pet shop. Radio reports tell of attacks spreading to nearby communities, and in the film’s final ambiguous shot, Mitch leads the women slowly to his car through a landscape filled with perched birds of different species apparently massing for the next attack, and they drive away to an uncertain future as the sun rises on a new world. As with the killer plants in M. Night Shyamalan’s later The Happening (2008), The Birds offers no explanation for the avian attacks. In the key scene in the local restaurant, an ornithologist who happens to be there explains that normally birds of different feathers do not flock together, making the situation seem even more ominous. While the conversation about the birds’ mysterious behaviour occurs, we hear a server place orders for fried chicken, hinting that the threat may be nature’s deliberate revenge on humanity. (Rachel Carson’s profoundly influential The Silent Spring was published in 1962, just a year before the film’s release.) Alternatively, we might read the monstrous birds as metaphoric of the characters’ repressed tensions: the attacks begin in Bodega Bay when Melanie comes to town (as a hysterical woman in the restaurant points out), her arrival also triggering the jealousy of Mitch’s former girlfriend, local schoolteacher Annie Hayworth (Pleshette), who is still in love with Mitch, and the possessiveness of Mitch’s mother, a widow whose wish to hold onto her son recalls the domineering Mrs. Bates of Psycho. Whatever the reason for the avian aggression, The Birds emphasises, like so many apocalyptic films to follow, how tenuous civilization is and how quickly it can collapse. When the birds attack the town, before Hitchcock cuts to the famous high-angle (‘bird’s-eye point-of-view’) shot looking down at the destruction, 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 15\n\nDIRECTOR Alfred Hitchcock PRODUCER Alfred Hitchcock SCREENPLAY Evan Hunter CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nRobert Burks EDITOR George Tomasini PRODUCTION COMPANY\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Productions, Universal MAIN CAST Rod Taylor, Tippi\n\nHedren, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette, Veronica Cartwright\n\n15\n\n09/11/2021 18:19\n\nchaos erupts in mere moments: a customer in a gas station, strafed by birds, drops the pump hose while filling his car’s gas tank; gas spills on the ground; another customer unknowingly lights a cigarette and drops a match; the place explodes in a hellish ball of flame and then people flee in all directions, helpless. Hitchcock subtly emphasises the precarious nature of our social order, beginning with Melanie out in the open bay, a city fish out of water, exposed and lacking solid grounding underfoot, her pale glove stained bright red by blood at the fingertips from the bird’s attack.

(Robert Townsend’s Meteorman [1993] worked in reverse, becoming a Marvel comic after the film.) Blade followed the infamously awful Howard the Duck (1986), which was the first Marvel property to be released as a feature in the US, and its success initiated Marvel’s long run of comic book adaptations and the development of the Marvel Comic Universe. It was followed by two sequels, Blade II (2002) and Blade: Trinity (2004), both also starring Wesley Snipes as the superhuman vampire-slayer and both written by David S.

In the world of Blade, vampires and humans have existed together from time immemorial. The vampires run a corporate empire and meet in a boardroom, capitalist bloodsuckers as well as literal ones. Blade, part-human and part-vampire – ’something else’, as his helper Whistler (Kristofferson) describes him – wages a private war against them, but the renegade vampire Deacon Frost (Dorff) is threatening to upset tradition by obtaining the big whatsit, the resurrection of the vampire god and the complete takeover of the human race (‘tonight the age of men comes to an end’). Created in 1973 by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan as one of several supporting characters in Marvel’s The Tomb of Dracula comic book, Blade is portrayed in the film as less conflicted, more of a killing machine. In his fight against the vampire horde Blade mainly relies, like a samurai, on a sword strapped on his back, but he also carries all sorts of other weapons including a handgun that looks like the oversized model wielded by Judge Dredd (first film version, 1995), and he drives a sleek black car that evokes the Batmobile, while Whistler functions as his Alfred. There is even a Joker of sorts in Frost’s henchperson, Mercury (Jover), who continually sports a psychotic smile. In addition to its comic book sensibility, Blade’s visual design in some ways anticipates that of The Matrix (1999), released the following year. Neo’s black overcoat seems to have been inspired by Blade’s costume, and when Blade fires on Frost, the latter’s heightened perception is depicted as a ‘bullet time’ dodging of the shells.\n\n18\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 18\n\nBlade tells Dr. Jenson (Wright) that the world she lives in is in reality merely ‘sugar-coated topping’, which also evokes the illusory world of the Matrix. Yet in Blade even this surface world seems bleak, filled with people on the streets who hardly seem to notice Blade striding among them with his weapons visible or while fighting Frost. In Blade’s cruel world, as he says, you have to learn to pull the trigger if you want to survive – which Dr. Jenson learns to do, beginning with Pearl, the giant Jabba-like mound of festering flesh that provides tech support for the vampires. Frost evokes the spectre of slavery and race relations when referring to Blade’s ‘Uncle Tom routine’, but the film is more interested in the action sequences than in exploring the nation’s fraught history of race relations.\n\nFurther Reading Carrington, André M.

Its success fuelled a franchise that includes novels, comic books, video games, a documentary about the making of the film (The Woods Movie [2015]), a mockumentary expanding on the supposed backstory (Curse of the Blair Witch [1999]), and two sequels: Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000), directed by Joel Berlinger (Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills [1997]), more conventional in style; and Blair Witch (2016), directed by Adam Wingard (Pop Skull [2007], You’re Next [2011]).

Evoking the earlier Cannibal Holocaust (1980), the opening titles of Blair Witch tell us, ‘In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later, their footage was found.’ The film we see is supposedly the footage shot by the three students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, chronicling their search for the legendary Blair Witch and their chaotic trip into the woods, where they become lost and terrified over several days and eventually disappear. With camcorder footage shot from two cameras, the film makes deft use of suggestion and mood in the manner of Val Lewton (Cat People* [1942], I Walked with a Zombie* [1943]) rather than relying on graphic horror, tapping into fears of the wilderness that date back to the Puritans (see also The Witch* [2015]). Offscreen space and sound frequently suggest an unseen presence, with twigs snapping around them in the woods, muffled voices, and screams in the far distance. In place of elaborate special effects and monsters, the frightened student filmmakers find bundles of sticks, some in the shape of human effigies, piles of rocks, and blood-soaked scraps of clothing – some of them sprung upon the actors, so their surprise and disorientation are to some degree unstaged. The film begins with some conventional documentary footage of interviews with local residents, but then chronicles the trio’s deteriorating mental states and mounting panic in the woods, culminating in the famous scene when\n\n20\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 20\n\nHeather talks tearfully into the camera, nostrils aquiver, before the climax in the crumbling house, where the abandonment of traditional documentary certainty parallels her fear and loss of control. According to the faux legend invented for the film, the Blair Witch is the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman who had been banished from Blair Township (now Burkittsville, Maryland) for witchcraft in 1785 and subsequently died. The canny promotional campaign for The Blair Witch Project was the first to involve the creation of a convincing website with an extremely detailed backstory offering a timeline of events relating to the Blair Witch and the founding of Burkitttsville and numerous clickable options for finding out more about her and other related faux historical figures and events. Many people were persuaded that the film was based on historical truth, and at the height of its popularity and for some time thereafter there was a spike in tourism in Burkittsville that provided a boost to the local economy.\n\nFurther Reading: Heller-Nicholas, Alexandre.

Henenlotter considers himself an exploitation filmmaker, like Herschell Gordon Lewis (Two Thousand Maniacs!* [1964]) – about whom Henenlotter made a documentary, Herschell Gordon Lewis: The Godfather of Gore (2010) – but with decidedly better production values and greater wit. Brain Damage complicates the gore of Lewis by mixing disturbing images of body horror with humour, making the resultant blend more disturbing. Aylmer is given a history more elaborate than that of the Maltese Falcon, and like that bejewelled ‘dingus’ it literally provides ‘the stuff that dreams are made of’. Lacking limbs, Aylmer forms a symbiotic relationship with his human host, attaching itself somewhere on the body so it can be carried around to hunt for brains, which it eats on a regular basis, and in return providing a beguiling blue, very addictive drug that gives an intense hallucinogenic high. Evoking such Bs as The Brain Eaters (1958) and Zontar: The Thing from Venus (1966), this pitiless puppet master attaches itself to the neck of its host by irregular rows of twitching teeth and hypodermic hooks in a mouth that looks simultaneously silly and sardonic. The plot begins when Aylmer escapes from Morris (Barnes) and Martha (Saint Peter), who have been his hosts, and enters a new victim, a young man named Brian (Hearst), who lives in a neighbouring apartment. Like Brian, we are unaware of what is going on until Aylmer reveals itself, popping up from behind Brian’s shoulder and casually saying ‘Hi!’ like an old friend. Aylmer is brilliantly voiced, appropriately, by John Zacherle, the iconic television horror host of the 1950s who was known for inserting comic cutaways into the classic horror movies he showed. (Zacherle also appears in Frankenhooker.) Certainly, Aylmer embodies Brian’s libido, with several jokes connecting the creature with the phallus, most explicitly when the woman Brian picks up at the night club begins to fellate him in the alley (‘Feels like you’ve got a real monster in there’, she observes). Isolating himself, Brian plays in the bathtub with an erect Alymer, who requires periodic immersion in water, and he moans orgasmicly whenever Aylmer injects its juice into his brain. But the film isn’t much interested in this theme, or in the potential for commenting on urban alienation and violent crime when Brian, riding in the subway with his girlfriend Barbara (Lowry), kisses her and so allows Aylmer to suck out her brains through his mouth, and no one notices (even though one passenger is reading a newspaper with the headline ‘Killers Loose in City’). Yet even more sobering is the scene in the cheap hotel room where Brian nobly but vainly tries to kick his ‘juice’ habit, shaking in agony on the floor, while Aylmer natters away at him, taunting Brian as he wades patiently in the sink.

Decades later he returned to the horror genre with Twixt (2011), an uneven work inspired in part by the writings of Edgar Allan Poe. Betwixt these films he directed Bram Stoker’s Dracula, a big-budget movie with high production values and high-concept casting that won three Oscars (for Costume Design, Sound Editing, and Makeup), the only Dracula adaptation to win Academy Awards. It remains, as the title suggests, the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker’s novel to date, although it does introduce some changes to the book’s ungainly narrative, particularly in the ending when Mina (Ryder) decapitates Dracula (Oldman) and releases him from his vampire curse.\n\nDIRECTOR Francis Ford Coppola PRODUCER Francis Ford\n\nCoppola, Fred Fuchs, Charles Mulvehill SCREENPLAY James V.

More importantly, the film is especially faithful to the spirit of repression that informs the novel and its historical Victorian context. Even the silent trick film Dracula (Oldman) and Mina (Ryder) attend is about repressed sexuality, showing a man who imagines himself with two nude women who then, to his disappointment, ‘turn’ into his wife. Like Stoker’s novel, the plot plods forward but throbs with energy during the vampire sequences, which are rife with erotic overtones. As he is being seduced by Dracula’s three wives in his Transylvanian castle, the first one appears, tellingly, to the dreamily moaning Jonathan Harker (Reeves) by rising up from between his legs in bed. It is clear why Lucy (Frost) is Dracula’s first victim in London: where Mina represses her sexual desire, Lucy is looser, flirting with the American Quincy Morris (‘It’s so big, let me touch it’, she says of his Bowie knife) even before she is bitten. Similar to John Badham’s Dracula (1979) with Frank Langella, Coppola combines the Count’s erotic appeal with a sense of sweeping romanticism. Five hundred years earlier, we learn, Vlad Dracula’s wife Elisabeta committed suicide erroneously thinking he had died in battle; his undying love survives centuries as he seeks to regain her through a contemporary woman who reincarnates her spirit, just as Kharis does in The Mummy* (1932), which itself borrowed from Tod Browning’s Dracula* (1931) with Bela Lugosi. When Dracula is about to turn Mina into a vampire and his mate forever, at the last moment his love proves so true that he nobly refuses to seal her fate. Mina mercifully ends his torment by impaling and decapitating him in a narrative change that suggests the depth of her unleashed passion and perhaps a kind of feminist empowerment (in the novel, by contrast, Dracula is dispatched by Harker and Morris). The intercutting of Harker and Mina’s marriage with the defilement and death of Lucy by Dracula recalls the famous montage in Coppola’s The Godfather (1972) as it seeks to transform Vlad from blasphemous demon to transcendent lover.\n\n24\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 24\n\nIn keeping with the period in which the film is set, Coppola chose to use traditional optical effects rather than CGI. Especially noteworthy are the beautifully eerie moments when Nosferatu-like shadows creep along the walls moving independently of Dracula himself. Gary Oldman, known as an actor capable of remarkable physical transformations, is well cast as the shape-shifting vampire who in the film looks different in almost every scene, whether aging forward or backward or in another form altogether, and manages to create a distinctive Dracula even as his performance nods to Lugosi’s. Of the other actors, Keanu Reeves does capture a sense of Harker’s bourgeois blandness although he seems to be in Jonathan Harker’s Excellent Adventure, while Anthony Hopkins’s Van Helsing interestingly conveys a hint of Hannibal Lecter, and Tom Waits tops Dwight Frye as the mad Renfield.\n\nFurther Reading: Deaville, James. ‘The Beauty of Horror: Kilar, Coppola, and Dracula’.

(Dracula’s Daughter was released the following year and then the unhallowed race was on.) After The Old Dark House (1932) and The Invisible Man (1933), Frankenstein director James Whale revisited his monster with The Bride of Frankenstein and extended his remarkably sympathetic treatment of him. The inspiration for the much less accomplished The Bride (1985) (Sting as Dr. Frankenstein and Jennifer Beales as the mate?!), the plot of Bride of Frankenstein picks up immediately where the earlier film leaves off, bracketed by a frame tale involving Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron in which Mary (Lanchester, who also plays the eponymous bride) reveals that there is more to the Frankenstein story than has thus far been told.\n\nDIRECTOR James Whale PRODUCER Carl Laemmle Jr. SCREENPLAY John Balderston,\n\nWilliam Hurlbut CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nJohn J.

The film begins with a horrifying opening scene in which the parents of the little girl drowned in Frankenstein are killed by the creature, who has survived the fire at the windmill that concluded the earlier movie, the father strangled in the pit under the burned mill and the mother unceremoniously tossed into it. Una O’Connor’s shrill screams follow, punctuating the grisly scene. After Pretorius shows Henry his collection of miniature homunculi, the former proclaims that together they will create ‘a new world of gods and monsters’ – the phrase providing the title for the 1998 film about the final period of Whale’s life. Aided in part by Karloff’s brilliant performance, Bride of Frankenstein pushes identification with the creature further than the first film. This time he saves a drowning girl rather than causing a girl to drown, but the misunderstood monster is hunted down by the angry mob of villagers, captured, and imprisoned in chains. The scene in which he is transported to the town jail, lashed to a pole, has distinct overtones of the crucifixion, while Christian imagery is also invoked, for example, in the touching scenes of the monster with his friend, the blind man (Heggie), in his cottage (he is attracted to the cottage by the blind man’s playing of ‘Ave Maria’ on the violin), which suggests the Last Supper as they share bread and wine before being interrupted by two hunters. Some have argued that Whale’s homosexuality may explain his extraordinary empathy with the creature, shunned as he is by society. Certainly, the mincing Pretorius is coded as gay, and Ernest Thesiger, the actor who portrayed him, was, like Whale, homosexual. The scene where the two hunters interrupt the creature’s idyll with the blind man (‘friend’) may be read as the imposition of normative masculinity on and disruption of a homosexual relationship.\n\n26\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 26\n\nAfter a reprise of the first film’s famous creation scene with its wild expressionism (this time, ‘She’s alive! Alive!’), production designer Kenneth Strickfaden’s laboratory equipment from Frankenstein was reused in Bride of Frankenstein (as it would be later in Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein* [1974]). When the poor creature is rejected by his new mate (Lanchester), he flies into a rampage that also conveniently provides apparent narrative closure and poetic justice: now able to speak, he tells Henry and Elizabeth to leave the lab (‘Yes! Go! You live!’) while to Pretorius and his intended bride he says, ‘You stay. We belong dead.’ Shedding a tear, he destroys the tower laboratory, killing them and himself (although, as we subsequently find out four years later in Son of Frankenstein [1939], he had only lapsed into a coma).\n\nFurther Reading: Curtis, James.

Written and directed by Don Coscarelli (writer and director of all four films in the Phantasm franchise), the plot of Bubba finds an elderly Elvis Presley (Campbell) – or a delusional Elvis impersonator named Sebastian Haff – and John Fitzgerald Kennedy (Davis) – or, again, a delusional senior who thinks he is JFK – as two residents of a Texas retirement home battling a 3,000-year old Egyptian soul-sucking mummy in cowboy boots feeding off the easy prey of old folks in the retirement home. According to Kennedy’s research in The Everyday Man and Woman’s Book of Souls, a being like Bubba that consumes souls can ingest them through any major bodily orifice, although Elvis assumes its preferred point of entry is through the rectum because the mummy apparently wrote graffiti on one of the toilet stall walls while defecating. Tana leaves also figure in somehow. The film is quite funny, with Campbell and Davis performing this ludicrous scenario with deadpan seriousness. There are memorable discussions about chocolate dingdongs and other topics of urgent significance. Even the mummy has his comic banter, hurling insults at Elvis in their climactic fight (‘Eat the dog dick of Anubis, you ass wipe’). The two men from the funeral parlor who load the corpses into their hearse in the morning are like the gravediggers in Hamlet, with comic repartee that nudges at deeper philosophical questions (‘Makes you wonder, doesn’t it?’). Once the dynamic duo discovers the existence of the malevolent mummy, Bubba and Elvis ponder what they should do, and Jack reasonably responds: ‘Changing rest homes might be a good idea.’ But the President and the King instead decide to take a stand (more accurately, a seat in a motorised wheelchair) against the supernatural soul-sucker. At the same time as Bubba Ho-Tep succeeds as an offbeat horror comedy movie, tucked within it is a poignant statement about society’s treatment of the elderly and of aging. Elvis and Jack were living a dreary existence, alone with their memories and fantasies, humoured and forgotten and condescended to by caregivers and younger folk. But battling Bubba gives them a purpose. Campbell is outstanding as an aged and dispirited Presley who regains himself when confronted with an actual spirit, pretending to be Elvis pretending to be Sebastian Haff pretending to be Elvis. His physical movements are constrained yet controlled, including the sultry sneer of the lip. On another level, the film, like Phantom of the Paradise* (1974), is about the tyranny of the culture industry and its destruction of individual authenticity. Thinking in voiceover, Elvis remarks that he wanted to escape his life as a cultural icon because ‘It wasn’t even me anymore. Just this thing they made up’ – a walking automaton going through the motions, not unlike Bubba. In the end, Elvis defeats his darker self and dies in the process, but with his soul intact – a glorious wish-fulfilling fantasy given the string of more than twenty formula musical comedies he was forced to 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 27\n\nDIRECTOR Don Coscarelli PRODUCER Don Coscarelli,\n\nJason R.

In this, their first pairing with Universal’s classic horror monsters, the comic duo play Chick Young (Abbott) and Wilbur Grey (Costello), two railway freight handlers who become involved with the terrible trio of Dracula (Lugosi), the Wolfman (Chaney), and the Frankenstein monster (Strange).

For the monsters, though, who hadn’t appeared since House of Dracula (1945), it would be their last appearance in a Universal horror film. As the series ran its course, the films declined in both humour and horror, the comic duo meeting Captain Kidd (1952) and the Keystone Kops (1955) and joining the Foreign Legion (1950) and even going to Mars (1953). The comedians met the last of the Universal Studios monsters, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, on television’s Colgate Comedy Hour in 1954. At the railway station Wilbur takes an urgent overseas telephone call from Lawrence Talbot (Chaney), who urges them not to deliver two arriving crates for McDougal’s House of Horrors, the local wax museum. The crates contain the remains of Count Dracula and the Frankenstein monster, but before he can convey his warning, the rising of the full moon transforms Talbot into a werewolf. After the hapless pair deliver and unpack the crates, Dracula emerges from his coffin and, amidst some comic business involving Wilbur, whose hysterical warnings no one will believe (‘I saw what I saw when I saw it’, he insists), animates the Frankenstein monster with a portable power charger he inexplicably has. As we find out, Dracula is in cahoots with a renegade surgeon with a Frankenstein complex, Dr. Sandra Mornay (Aubert), who promises to fulfill the vampire’s wish to have the monster fitted with a new brain, one with ‘no will of his own. No fiendish intellect to oppose his master.’ As she boasts, she has found a brain that will exceed his expectations – Wilbur’s (‘so simple, so pliable’). In the climax, the Wolfman grabs Dracula as the vampire morphs into bat form and jumps with him off a steep cliff, presumably killing them both, while the monster, after throwing Dr. Mornay through a window to her death, is then consumed by fire – all the action interspersed with farce as the boys run about attempting to escape the mayhem.\n\n30\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 30\n\nApart from Abbott and Costello, the rest of the cast plays it straight. Indeed, this was the only time on film Lugosi repeated the role he had created in Dracula* (1931), although he would portray vampires in several other movies including Mark of the Vampire (1935), Spooks Run Wild (1941) with the Bowery Boys, and The Return of the Vampire (1943). The appositely named Glenn Strange had starred in many Westerns before replacing Karloff as Frankenstein’s monster in House of Frankenstein (1944) and House of Dracula (1945); and although Lugosi’s Dracula seems oddly corporeal, Chaney brings the same gravitas to the role of tortured soul Lawrence Talbot that he did to The Wolf Man* (1941). While Dracula’s transformations into a bat are poorly animated, detracting from their frightful potential, Talbot’s transformations are excellently done. The film’s best moment, though, occurs when Dracula steers the newly awakened but groggy Frankenstein monster away from the hypnotised and immobile Wilbur, reassuringly telling the creature, ‘Don’t be afraid, he won’t hurt you.’\n\nFurther Reading: Carmichael, Deborah. ‘Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein: Laughing in the Face of an Uncertain Future.’ In The Laughing Dead: The Horror-Comedy Film from Bride of Frankenstein to Zombieland, ed.

Petty The woods may be lovely – and, indeed, the cinematography of The Burrowers presents them so, in glorious shots that would grace any classic Western – but they are also dark and deep. The fearful associations of the ‘untamed’ wilderness have carried over into the horror genre, as expressed in horror movies from Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)* to The Witch (2015)*. The Puritan mind associated Native Americans with demonic evil, a psychic projection that The Burrowers reverses. Written and directed by J. T. Petty (Hellbenders [2012], Mimic 3: Sentinel [2003]), this is no mere exercise in genre hybridity, like Curse of the Undead (1959), with its vampire gunslinger, or Billy the Kid vs. Dracula (1966). Rather, the film uses the Western, with its traditionally racist view of indigenous cultures, to offer a devastating critique of the racism upon which westward expansion and the genocide of Native Americans were founded. The film begins like John Ford’s classic Western The Searchers (1956), in which rabid Indian-hater Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) searches for years for his niece, kidnapped by renegade Comanche, not to rescue her but to kill her because she has been defiled. In The Burrowers, set in 1879 (eleven years after The Searchers\n\nDIRECTOR J. T. Petty PRODUCER William Sherak,\n\nJason Shuman SCREENPLAY J. T.

The film offers several other references to The Searchers, such as when the pursuers find a child’s doll and, most astonishingly, when one of them, Parcher (Mapother), shoots out the eyes of a dead Indian, an act of religious defilement, as Ethan explains when he does the same in The Searchers. It turns out, though, that the women have not been taken by Indians but have been snatched by creatures the Indians, who already know about them, call burrowers. The burrowers paralyze their prey with a natural toxin, bury their victims alive, and return to eat them later after rot has begin to soften them. We learn that the burrowers used to feed on buffalo, but now that the buffalo are gone the burrowers have had to find another source of food – namely, humans. It is whites who have upset the delicate balance of nature, unable to live in harmony with the land. Despite learning this, the band of pursuers persists in holding onto their racist perspective as they agree to kill the monsters while still planning to rescue the missing settlers from the Indians. In their pursuit, they meet a cavalry platoon under the command of Henry Victor (Hutchison), a vain and rabid racist clearly modelled on Gen. George Armstrong Custer (at one point he is shown trimming his handlebar moustache with scissors as the vain Custer does in another subversive Western, Little Big Man [1970]).\n\n32\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 32\n\nIn the brutally ironic ending of The Burrowers, Victor misconstrues the danger because of his own racist perspective (‘All we can do is make sure these Indians never do nothing like this again’) and so fails to learn about the native drug used to combat the creatures. Here, the cavalry does not come to the rescue; instead, we see two Ute braves, who know the secret of the drug, lynched and swinging from ropes. One cowboy advises another ‘Find your girl, kill the burrowers, build a house on the prairie, and play American.’ The country is built on bloodshed, but the subterranean nature of the burrowers suggests repression, while their abject maws are a horrific representation of the idea that the nation will never exorcise its racist demons without unearthing and confronting its violently racist past.\n\nFurther Reading Fine, Kerry, Michael K.

Candyman translates American culture’s racial fears and anxieties into the terms of horror and locates it within urban America. Director Bernard Rose (Paperhouse [1988]) took Clive Barker’s source story ‘The Forbidden’ (contained in Book 5 of Barker’s Books of Blood [1985]) and relocated it from Great Britain to the Cabrini-Green public housing development in Chicago, infamous at the time as a case study for the failures of inner city public housing, and changed the emphasis from class to race – although the two are, of course, inextricable, as Candyman shows. The film was followed by two sequels, Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh (1995) and Candyman: Day of the Dead (1999), all three featuring Tony Todd as the title monster. Helen Lyle (Madsen), a graduate student in sociology at the University of Chicago, is researching urban legends (the ones we hear of involve babysitters and evoke Halloween* [1978]), when she comes upon a local one involving the Candyman, about which she decides to write her thesis. From one of her professors we learn Candyman’s backstory: he was the son of a prosperous former slave (he became wealthy, significantly, during the Civil War, when the nation was ripped asunder, like Candyman’s victims) who sired a child by a white woman whom he loved; in retribution, her father had Candyman’s hand cut off and replaced with his killing hook, stripped naked and smeared with honey from a local apiary, and then stung to death by the bees. According to the legend, Candyman can be summoned by saying his name five times while looking in a mirror. Investigating the unsolved murder of a woman in Cabrini-Green that residents attribute to Candyman, Helen goes with her friend and fellow graduate student Bernadette (Lemmons) on a field trip to the projects to learn about how the people who live there use the ‘mythical figure’ of Candyman to cope with what she describes as ‘the unconscious fears of modern urban society’. Helen summons him according to the legend, and he explains to her that he needs the belief of people in order to survive and that because Helen’s research threatens to demythify him, innocent blood – hers – must be shed to perpetuate that belief (‘Believe in me, be my victim’). He arranges circumstances so that she seems to have killed several people actually dispatched by Candyman, placing her within the nightmare existence of the people she was at first regarding with a tourist gaze. The first trip to Cabrini-Green by the two women seems like they are entering an alien world – although it is only eight blocks away! Helen climbs through the hole behind the bathroom wall cabinet in the murdered woman’s apartment like Alice going through the rabbit hole.

In the course of fighting Candyman, Helen gets too close to her topic, like Kathleen in The Addiction* (1995), and changes from aloof academic to active participant. In the final shot, recalling the end of The Shining* (1980), the camera tracks in to a close-up of a wall mural depicting her along with Candyman, now absorbed into and part of the folklore she had been investigating.\n\n34\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 34\n\nFurther Reading: Briefel, Aviva, and Sianne Ngai. ‘Candyman: Urban Space, Fear, and Entitlement’.

Harvey shot the film on an extremely small budget in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, where the abandoned Saltair Pavilion, once an important national vacation venue, was located. Much of the crew were Centron employees, as was the screenwriter, John Clifford, who was given carte blanche with the only stipulation from Harvey being that the final scene had to feature a crowd of ghouls in the dilapidated ballroom of Saltair. Amusement parks have featured in numerous horror films, and Carnival of Souls, now a cult favourite widely seen over the years on late-night television, inspired a direct-to-video remake (1998) and a loose remake, Yella (2008), directed by Christian Petzold, as well as the look of George Romero’s zombies in Night of the Living Dead* (1968). In Kansas, Mary is a passenger in a car with two other young women when they become involved in a drag race with some young men and end up plunging into a river as both vehicles are jockeying for position on a narrow wooden bridge. While the police try unsuccessfully to locate the car in the river, Mary somehow surfaces, the only survivor, although she is unable to remember what happened. Moving to Salt Lake City to take up a job as a church organist, she is definitely not in Kansas anymore as periodically she sees a stranger, ‘The Man’ (Harvey), lurking near, and she finds herself drawn to the abandoned pavilion, which seems to beckon like Hill House or the Overlook Hotel. The film suggests that Mary’s soul is in turmoil and that she needs to come to terms with her own death. The minister in Kansas tells her that she should put more ‘soul’ into her playing, and the one in Salt Lake City says he feels sorry for her ‘lack of soul’. For Mary, the church is merely a business transaction, as she tells John (Berger), the other roomer in the house, who replies, correctly, that her spiritually deficient attitude likely induces nightmares. Mary seems antisocial, although from a psychoanalytic perspective the film suggests she may have a fear of intimacy with men. On one level, The Man is a projection of her fear of all men, whether the smug Dr. Samuels (Levitt) or the sleazy John. But it is also the men, the doctor and ministers, who seek to prevent Mary from achieving spiritual peace by exploring the pavilion. When she finally does so, she sees The Man (Death?) at the undead ball dancing with herself, after which the undead pursue and overtake her. This death dance is the one social event no one, not even Mary, can avoid. The plot, including the twist ending where the car is finally dredged up from the river back in Kansas with the bodies of three women in it, recalls the famous ending of the Twilight Zone episode ‘The Hitch-Hiker’ with Inger Stevens, and the scene in the department store when Mary becomes briefly disconnected from the world is reminiscent of another episode of the show, ‘The After-Hours’, with Anne Francis, 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 35\n\nDIRECTOR Herk Harvey PRODUCER Herk Harvey SCREENPLAY John Clifford,\n\nHerk Harvey CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nMaurice Prather EDITOR Bill de Jamett,\n\nDan Palmquist MUSIC Gene Moore PRODUCTION COMPANY\n\nHerts-Lion International Corp.

It garnered two Oscar nominations – Sissy Spacek for Best Actress as the telekinetic teenager of the title and Piper Laurie for Best Supporting Actress for her maniacal mother, Margaret White – and was the first significant box-office success for director Brian De Palma (Sisters* [1972], Phantom of the Paradise* [1974]). Its popularity generated a sequel, The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999), with Amy Irving reprising her role as classmate Sue Snell; a 2002 made-for-television film; a 2013 remake; and an unsuccessful 1988 Broadway musical. The film’s depiction of high school life and teenage female empowerment – ’It has nothing to do with Satan, it’s me’, as Carrie tells her mother – has guaranteed its iconic status in horror as well as popular culture more generally. Introverted teenager Carrie White has her first period in the high school gym shower at the same time as she becomes aware of her dawning power of telekinesis. (De Palma’s 1978 The Fury also features a similar premise involving telekinesis, but with a teenage boy.) Kept ignorant of menstruation by her fanatically religious mother, Carrie experiences a new sensual awareness of her own body – enticingly filmed by De Palma in slow motion and soft focus – but it quickly turns frightening for her with the sight of blood, associating feminine agency with horror. Perceiving Carrie’s turn to womanhood and driven mad by her own lustful indulgence in the past, her mother attempts to repress the girl’s growth by locking her in a closet to pray, as she has done so many times before. But this time Carrie is determined to come out of the closet, which she does by asserting her own wishes over her mother’s and defiantly going to the prom with school heartthrob Tommy Ross (Katt). The film builds inevitably toward the extraordinary prom scene, the extended set piece that provides the powerful climax and a cathartic explosion of violence in which no one is spared. (Of course, the fact that the school is named Bates High School already promises that the event will not go well.) After the bucket of pig’s blood is dumped on her by cruel classmate Chris Hargensen (Allen) while being crowned prom queen, Carrie’s unleashed rage is indiscriminate as she imagines that everyone has been in on the prank and laughing at her, just as her mother predicted. She is all the more enraged for having had a moment of happiness, as she seemed finally to have been accepted by her peers, even Tommy, who seemed truly to like her. The two of them dance, spinning in a pas de deux with the rotating camera in one lengthy shot, the speed gradually increasing once they kiss, an expression of her giddy joy. But then, drenched in blood, her blue eyes glaring through the red, she takes her vengeance as the film abruptly shifts to a red tint and a split screen, a technique De Palma has often employed, the change in visual register a sudden shock that mirrors the shock of the event itself. 100 AMERICAN HORROR FILMS\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 37\n\nDIRECTOR Brian De Palma PRODUCER Paul Monash SCREENPLAY Lawrence D.

Just as in Sabotage Hitchcock builds suspense by cutting between the boy with the deadly package and clocks ticking away the time until noon, when the bomb is set to detonate, so in the prom scene in Carrie De Palma cuts multiple times from the dance floor to the bucket of pig’s blood, rubbing our noses in it, as it were. More than once the camera tracks along the path of the rope, taking us to its inevitable end, the bucket. Even though Carrie kills them all, reserving particularly awful deaths for her sarcastic English teacher (Lassick) and kindly gym teacher Miss Collins (Buckley), surely the apocalyptic mayhem that turns the prom scene into a blazing inferno 38\n\n100_American_Horror_print-ready_pages.indd 38\n\ntaps into the secret fantasies of every adolescent who has ever been bullied at school.\n\nFurther Reading Bliss, Michael.
