        "text": "Colleen Rose Dewhurst (June 3, 1924 — August 22, 1991) was a Canadian-American actress known for a while as \"the Queen of Off-Broadway.\" In her autobiography, Dewhurst wrote: \"I had moved so quickly from one Off-Broadway production to the next that I was known, at one point, as the 'Queen of Off-Broadway'. This title was not due to my brilliance but rather because most of the plays I was in closed after a run of anywhere from one night to two weeks. I would then move immediately into another.\"[1] She was a renowned interpreter of the works of Eugene O’Neill on the stage, and her career also encompassed film, early dramas on live television, and Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n3 Personal life\n\n3.1 Death\n\n3.2 Awards\n\n3.3 Filmography\n\n3.3.1 Films and television movies\n\n3.3.2 Television work (excluding television films)\n\n3.4 Theatre\n\n3.5 Bibliography\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nEarly life\n\nDewhurst was born in Montreal, Quebec, the only child of Ferdinand Augustus \"Fred\" and Frances Marie (née Woods) Dewhurst, a businessman and homemaker, respectively. Her father had been a \"well-known athlete in Canada, where he had played football with the Ottawa Roughriders\".[2] Her mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, which her daughter would also adopt.[3] Her family moved to Massachusetts in 1928 or 1929, staying in Boston, Dorchester, Auburndale, and West Newton. Later they moved to New York City. After her parents separated, she and her mother relocated to Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, where she graduated from Riverside High School in 1942. She went on to attend Milwaukee-Downer College.[4]\n\nCareer\n\nHer most significant achievement was the 1974 Broadway revival of O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten as the farm girl Josie Hogan opposite Jason Robards's Jamie. Dewhurst won a Tony Award for her work. Dewhurst played Katharina in a 1956 production of Taming of the Shrew for Papp. She (as recounted in her posthumous obituary in collaboration with Tom Viola) wrote: \"With Brooks Atkinson's blessing, our world changed overnight. Suddenly in our audience of neighbors in T-shirts and jeans appeared men in white shirts,jackets and ties, and ladies in summer dresses. We were in a hit that would have a positive effect on my career, as well as Joe's, but I missed the shouting.\"[1] Dewhurst played Shakespeare's Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth for Papp and, years later, Gertrude in a production of Hamlet at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park.\n\nDewhurst and Scott met while working together in 1958, in Children of Darkness, while they were both married to other people. Dewhurst and Scott married and divorced twice. They had two sons, Alexander Scott and actor Campbell Scott. Colleen Dewhurst won two Tony Awards and four Emmy Awards.\n\nShe appeared with Ingrid Bergman in a production of O'Neill's More Stately Mansions on Broadway in 1967. Quintero also directed her in O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Mourning Becomes Electra. She appeared in Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers' Ballad of the Sad Cafe, and she played Albee's Martha in a Broadway revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf which Albee directed himself. She won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in 1961 for All The Way Home.\n\nShe appeared in 1962 as Joanne Novak in the episode \"I Don't Belong in a White-Painted House\" in NBC's medical drama, The Eleventh Hour, starring Wendell Corey and Jack Ging.[5] Dewhurst appeared opposite her then-husband, Scott, in a 1971 television adaptation of Arthur Miller's The Price, on Hallmark Hall of Fame, an anthology series, and there is another television recording of them together when she played Elizabeth Proctor to his unfaithful John in Miller's The Crucible (with Tuesday Weld. In 1977, Woody Allen cast her in his film Annie Hall as Annie's mother.\n\nIn 1972 she played a madam, Mrs. Kate Collingwood, in The Cowboys (1972), which starred John Wayne. In 1985, she played the role of Marilla Cuthbert in Kevin Sullivan's adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables, and reprised the role in 1987's Anne of Avonlea (also known as Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel), and in several episodes of Kevin Sullivan's Road to Avonlea. Dewhurst died before the character of Marilla could be written out and her final scenes were picked up off the editing-room floor and pieced together for her death scene.[citation needed].\n\nDuring 1989 and 1990, she appeared in a supporting role on the television series Murphy Brown playing the feisty mother of Candice Bergen's title character; this role earned her two Emmy Awards.\n\nDewhurst was president of the Actors' Equity Association from 1985 until her death from cervical cancer in 1991. Dewhurst's Christian Science beliefs[citation needed] led to her refusal to countenance any kind of surgical treatment. Maureen Stapleton wrote about Dewhurst: \"Colleen looked like a warrior, so people assumed she was the earth mother. But in real life Colleen was not to be let out without a keeper. She couldn't stop herself from taking care of people, which she then did with more care than she took care of herself. Her generosity of spirit was overwhelming and her smile so dazzling that you couldn't pull the fucking reins in on her even if you desperately wanted to and knew damn well that somebody should.\"[1]\n\nPersonal life\n\nDewhurst was married to James Vickery from 1947 to 1960. Later she was twice married and divorced from stage, film and television actor George C. Scott for a total of approximately 10 years. The couple had two sons, Alexander and Campbell, an actor. She co-starred with Campbell in Dying Young (1991), one of her last performances.\n\nDuring the last years of her life, she lived on a farm in South Salem, New York, with her partner, Ken Marsolais. They also had a summer home on Prince Edward Island, Canada.\n\nDeath\n\nDewhurst died, age 67, at her South Salem home. She was cremated and her ashes were given to family and friends; no public service was planned. In addition to her sons, she was survived by two grandchildren.\n\nAwards\n\nOver the course of her 45-year career, Dewhurst won the 1974 Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre, two Tony Awards, two Obie Awards and two Gemini Awards. In 1989, she won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for her role in Hitting Home. Of her 12 Emmy Award nominations, she won four. She was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.[6]\n\n1986: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie — Between Two Women\n\n1989: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Comedy Series — Murphy Brown\n\n1989: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie — Those She Left Behind\n\n1991: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Comedy Series — Murphy Brown\n\n1961: Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play — All the Way Home\n\n1974: Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play — A Moon for the Misbegotten\n\nNominations\n\nThis television-related list is incomplete; you can help by .\n\n1990: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress – Drama Series — Road to Avonlea\n\n1990: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie — Lantern Hill\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms and television movies\n\nYear Film Role Notes 1959 The Nun's Story Archangel Gabriel (Sanatorium) 1960 Man on a String Helen Benson 1961 The Foxes television film 1962 Focus television film 1966 A Fine Madness Dr. Vera Kropotkin 1967 The Crucible Elizabeth Proctor television film (adaptation of the play The Crucible) 1971 The Last Run Monique 1972 The Cowboys Kate 1973 Legend in Granite Marie Lombardi television film 1974 Parker Addison, Philosopher Hostess television film The Music School Hostess television film McQ Myra The Story of Jacob and Joseph Rebekah television film 1975 A Moon for the Misbegotten Josie Hogan television film (adaptation of the play A Moon for the Misbegotten) 1977 Annie Hall Mrs. Hall 1978 The Third Walker Kate Maclean Ice Castles Beulah Smith 1979 Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story Mrs. O'Neil television film When a Stranger Calls Tracy And Baby Makes Six Anna Kramer television film Mary and Joseph: A Story of Faith Elizabeth television film 1980 Death Penalty Elaine Lipton television film Escape Lily Levinson television film Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones Mrs. Myrtle Kennedy television miniseries The Women's Room Val television film (based on the book The Women's Room) A Perfect Match Meg Larson television film Baby Comes Home Anna Kramer television film Final Assignment Dr. Valentine Ulanova Tribute Gladys Petrelli 1981 A Few Days in Weasel Creek Aunt Cora television film 1982 Split Cherry Tree Mother Between Two Brothers television film 1983 Sometimes I Wonder Grandma television film The Dead Zone Henrietta Dodd 1984 You Can't Take It with You Grand Duchess Olga Katrina television film (adaptation of the play You Can't Take It with You) The Glitter Dome Lorna Dillman television film 1985 Anne of Green Gables Marilla Cuthbert television film 1986 Between Two Women Barbara Petherton television film Johnny Bull Marie Kovacs television film As Is Hospice Worker television film The Boy Who Could Fly Mrs. Sherman Sword of Gideon Golda Meir television film 1987 Hitting Home Judge television film Bigfoot Gladys Samco television film Anne of Avonlea (also known as Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) Marilla Cuthbert television film 1989 Those She Left Behind Margaret Page television film Termini Station Molly Dushane 1990 The Exorcist III Pazuzu (voice) uncredited Woman in the Wind Kaleidoscope Margaret television film Lantern Hill Elizabeth television film 1991 Dying Young Estelle Whittier Bed & Breakfast Ruth\n\nTelevision work (excluding television films)\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1957 Studio One teleplay: First Prize for Murder 1958 Kraft Television Theatre teleplay: Presumption of Innocence Decoy Taffy one episode: \"Deadly Corridor\" The DuPont Show of the Month teleplay The Count of Monte Cristo 1959 Aldonza/Dulcinea teleplay: I, Don Quixote Play of the Week Mordeen Saul / Woman teleplays: Burning Bright; Medea The United States Steel Hour Vera Brandon teleplay: The Hours Before Dawn 1961 Play of the Week teleplays\" No Exit; The Indifferent Lover Ben Casey Phyllis Anders one episode: \"I Remember a Lemon Tree\" 1962 The Eleventh Hour Joanne Novak one episode: \"I Don't Belong in a White-Painted House\" The Virginian Celia Ames one episode: \"The Executioners\" The Nurses Grace Milo one episode: \"Fly, Shadow\" 1963 The United States Steel Hour Francie Broderick teleplay: Night Run to the West The DuPont Show of the Month Karen Holt teleplay: Something to Hide 1964 East Side/West Side Shirley one episode: \"Nothing but the Half Truth\" 1965 Dr. Kildare Eleanor Markham one episode: \"All Brides Should Be Beautiful\" The Alfred Hitchcock Hour Nurse Ellen Hatch one episode: \"Night Fever\" 1966 The F.B.I.
