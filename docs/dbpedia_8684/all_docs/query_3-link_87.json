        "text": "Born Stanley Oliver Tucci, Jr. on November 11, 1960, in Peekskill, New York. Tucci grew up in Katonah, New York, as the eldest of three siblings. Tucci came from an Italian-American, middle class family: His father, Stanley Tucci, Sr., was an art teacher, and his mother, Joan Tucci, worked as a secretary. Tucci showed an interest in theater at an early age, studying drama at John Jay High School. Tucci's high school friend Campbell Scott, the son of actress Colleen Dewhurst, helped Tucci land his professional acting debut as an extra in a Broadway production starring Dewhurst. After graduation in 1978, Tucci enrolled in SUNY Purchase, where he studied drama.\n\nTucci earned his bachelor's degree from SUNY Purchase in 1982, and moved almost immediately afterward to New York City. Working part-time as a server in order to make ends meet, Tucci spent his evenings performing in Broadway and off-Broadway productions. After several years of hard work, Tucci made his film debut in 1985's Prizzi's Honor, which starred Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner. The dark comedy landed critical recognition, including an Academy Award for Turner and an Oscar nod for Nicholson. Tucci's role in the movie helped him land more work, including his first memorable television role as the recurring character Frank Mosca on Miami Vice, beginning in 1986. Tucci would reprise the role two more times in 1987 and 1988. He also portrayed a tough guy in five episodes of Wiseguy from 1988 to 1989.\n\nReturning to the big screen in 1992, Tucci was cast in the independent comedy In the Soup, then portrayed the famous gangster Lucky Luciano in Billy Bathgate in 1993. Also in 1993, Tucci played a Middle Eastern assassin in the critically acclaimed The Pelican Brief. After years of playing the tough guy in a variety of television and movie roles, Stanley Tucci was cast in the title role in Winchell, the HBO biopic about the tabloid reporter Henry Winchell's life, in 1998. Tucci's performance earned him his first Emmy and Golden Globe award wins.\n\nTucci began working behind the camera in the early 90s, after growing frustrated with what he felt were stereotypical Italian roles in Hollywood. Tucci began shopping a script he wrote, Big Night, around to various studios in the early 90s. He eventually landed a deal to make the film, which told the story of two Italian immigrant brothers and heir failing restaurant. Due to budget constraints, Tucci co-directed the film with the help of his old friend, Campbell Scott. The movie was highly regarded at the Sundance Film Festival, earning a Grand Jury Prize nomination and winning a Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the gathering. He followed up this project with a starring role in The Impostors (1998), a period comedy which he also wrote and directed. Tucci also stepped into the director role for the 2000 indie drama,\n\nTucci returned to big screen blockbusters in 1999's film remake of the Shakespeare classic, A Midsummer Night's Dream which featured Michelle Pfeiffer; followed by the comedy Sidewalks of New York (2001); and the romantic America's Sweethearts, a Julia Roberts vehicle. He then reprised his role as a gangster in 2002's critically acclaimed The Road to Perdition, which also starred actor Tom Hanks.\n\nIn 2001, Tucci returned to TV, earning another Emmy nomination and his second Golden Globe win for his portrayal of Adolph Eichmann in the HBO film, Conspiracy. He earned a third Emmy nod, this time for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, when he guest-starred on former cast mate Tony Shalhoub's cable hit, Monk. His next performance, a recurring role on the long running hit ER in 2007 and 2008, landed Tucci his fourth Emmy nomination.\n\nIn 2009, Tucci came back to the attention of film audiences and critics as the co-star in Nora Ephron's critically acclaimed dramatic comedy Julie & Julia. Tucci played opposite Meryl Streep, playing the husband of Julia Child. The film received a host of awards and nominations for Streep, and was a fan favorite. Tucci earned his own nominations for Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards for his turn as the creepy neighbor, George Harvey, in Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones. Tucci's next project, the comedy Easy A, is slated to hit theaters in 2010.\n\nTucci married his wife Kate on April 18, 1995. The couple had three daughters together, daughter Camilla and twins Isabel and Nicolo. Tucci separated from his wife in 2003, amid gossip that he was seeing actress Edie Falco, whom he met that year while performing in a Broadway production of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune. The couple reunited in 2005. Kate Tucci died from breast cancer in May 2009. Tucci and his family continue to live in South Salem, New York.\n\n© 2012 A+E Networks.

There should be a law against that. \"\n\n\"Even The Impostors, as silly as it is, is a very intimate film, in a way.\"\n\n\"I like to see how I can do it for less money.\"\n\n\"I'm actually one who will encourage directors to cut my lines.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you had to change diapers so often. I couldn't believe it - we must change them 10 times a day - each. So that's 20 diapers a piece a day.\"\n\n\"As a director, I also get to sit and watch actors and learn from them in a way that I don't get to do when I'm just acting.\"\n\n\"But usually I'll wake up and start writing about nine o'clock. I'll probably write for about three hours, and I'll do that over the next month and a half.\"\n\n\"I have consciously not taken the role of a gangster, which has been offered to me far too many times. \"\n\n\"I wanted to be an actor when I was a kid.\"\n\n\"I was always attracted to the past as a kid.\"\n\n\"I was dissatisfied just being an actor. \"\n\n\"Sometimes it's difficult directing yourself on film because you can't quite separate yourself from the subject \"\n\n​\n\nsee : Celebrity quotes"
