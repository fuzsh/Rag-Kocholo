It stars George C. Scott, Nicol Williamson, Ed Flanders, Brad Dourif and Grand L. Bush.\n\nThe movie is a sequel to \"The Exorcist\" and skips past many of the events of \"\". It takes place in Georgetown fifteen years after the events of the first film, in which a young girl named Regan was possessed by a demon.\n\nynopsis\n\nSet 15 years after the events of The Exorcist, Lieutenant Kinderman (Scott) is a philosophical police detective who was briefly involved in the case of Regan's possession. He has to investigate a string of grisly murders that appear to have a satanic motive behind them, and furthermore have all the hallmarks of a serial-murderer known as the Gemini Killer. The most baffling thing is that the Gemini Killer was executed years ago.\n\nThe evidence eventually leads Kinderman to the psychiatric ward of a mental asylum where an already disturbing case takes a shocking twist.\n\nAlthough it did not match the success of the original, it is nonetheless held in slightly higher regard than \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\". The slow pace and emphasis on dialogue in \"The Exorcist III\" is cited as a reason for both liking and loathing it by horror fans.\n\nBasketball player Patrick Ewing and model Fabio have cameo appearances in a dream sequence, while John Thompson appears in a long shot. Ex-surgeon general C. Everett Koop and television host Larry King appear as themselves in a local Georgetown restaurant when Kinderman has lunch with Father Dyer. The film also includes early appearances by Tyra Farrell as a nurse and Samuel L. Jackson as a blind man. Actor Grand L. Bush was hand-picked by Blatty to perform opposite Scott.\n\nProduction Notes\n\n* Originally, Blatty wanted this film to follow events from the first \"Exorcist\" film, but not be a direct sequel. He wanted the film to have the same title as the book (Legion). During production, the film was referred to as Exorcist: Legion (without the numerals). Morgan Creek changed the name to \"Exorcist III: Legion\" and also wrote and shot a new scene where an exorcism takes place in the mental ward. The original trailers refer to the film as The Exorcist 1990 (with the logo being the word \"The\" with \"Exorcist\" beneath it in a wider font and \"1990\" beneath it in the same narrow font as \"The\" making the image of a crucifix. Eventually the subtitle \"Legion\" dropped completely and the film was released as The Exorcist III.\n\n* Blatty attempted to contact friend William O'Malley to reprise his role as Father Dyer from the first film; however, O'Malley was busy and could not take up the part. Blatty then hired Ed Flanders, who was originally supposed to appear as the warden, Dr. Temple.\n\n* Some of the scenes refer to Blatty's original novel \"The Exorcist\", such as Father Dyer's complaint about becoming addicted to lemon drops, because the students who go to confessional have it on their breath to hide the odor of marijuana.\n\n* The film picks up 15 years from where the original 1973 Exorcist film left off, not referencing the events of the first 1977 sequel \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\".\n\n* The poem uttered by Patient X is [http://www.bartleby.com/105/72.html Sonnet 72] by John Donne (\"Death be not proud, though some have called thee\".)\n\nAdditional Cast\n\n* Zohra Lampert, who played Kinderman's wife, is best known for her lead role in another well-remembered horror film, 1971's \"Let's Scare Jessica to Death\".\n\n* Viveca Lindfors plays the mental patient who disguises herself as a nurse and attempts to decapitate Julie, and is better remembered as Aunt Bedelia in the Father's Day segment of Creepshow.\n\n* The elderly woman wearing a veil, and shown being escorted to the Holy Trinity church is (uncredited) actress Teresa Wright.\n\nReshoots\n\nThe film had two major changes after production at the request of the studio:\n\n*Jason Miller was hired because the studio wanted someone from the original movie to be included. Miller was the logical choice since the other two character alumni from the original film, Kinderman and Father Dyer, were played respectively by Lee J. Cobb (who had since died) and William O'Malley (who only took the role in the original film as a favor to Blatty, and who was not available to reprise the role). Unfortunately, actor Brad Dourif had already been hired to play Patient X, so some reshooting and editing was needed. Miller played the Patient X / Karras identity and Dourif played the James \"The Gemini Killer\" Venamun character. All of Dourif's lines as Karras were reshot with Miller.\n\n*The Father Morning scenes were spliced into the film because the studio wanted an exorcism in the film to make the title relevant. This was less cleverly included, and there is quite a bit of discontinuity, especially during the final scene in which Morning's body vanishes and reappears.\n\n*There is some confusion among fans as to what exactly happens in the reshot \"exorcism\" climax. According to \"Cinefantastique\" magazine (February 1991), \"20th Century Fox ponied up an additional $4-million in post-production - to film an effects-laden exorcisim sequence featuring Nicol Williamson as Father Morning, a character added just for the new climax.\"\n\n*While doing online publicity for the re-release of \"The Exorcist\" in 2000, William Peter Blatty explained that the new climax, which differs from that of \"Legion\" was mandated by the studio in order to add more action and overt horror to the picture, and that he had to make the best of it in the narrative while racing to complete the film. He confirmed that when the possessed Karras speaks in an asexual voice, saying, \"I must save my son, the Gemini,\" that this in fact is either a returned Pazuzu or, as Blatty put it, \"old Scratch himself\" taking control. This ties in to the revelation earlier in the film that the Gemini was sent into Karras' body as revenge for the Regan MacNeil exorcism. The altered voice in the climax is deliberately similar to that of Mercedes McCambridge, who provided the voice of the original demon in \"The Exorcist\", and the role is essayed in \"The Exorcist III\" by Colleen Dewhurst, who was uncredited. In real life, actress Dewhurst was twice married to-, and twice divorced from- actor George C. Scott.\n\n*The originally-shot climax of the film, which hewed much closer to the ending of \"Legion\", can be glimpsed in the theatrical trailer, in which Karras/the Gemini is shown \"morphing\" through a variety of faces.\n\n*Interestingly enough, actor Nicol Williamson was already known to Blatty prior to directing this film; in passing, actor Williamson is mentioned in Blatty's novel \"Legion\". Incidentally, Williamson appears in Excalibur (film) as Merlin.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"
