        "text": "Hi everybody\n\nI have few questions about the term \" stratum\" in NTP.\n\nPlease consider the excerpt from the link given below:\n\nhttp://www.endruntechnologies.com/stratum1.htm\n\nAs you progress through different strata there are network delays involved that reduce the accuracy of the NTP server in relation to UTC. Timestamps generated by an EndRun Stratum 1 Time Server will typically have 10 microseconds accuracy to UTC. A stratum-2 server will have anywhere from 1/2 to 100 ms accuracy to UTC and each subsequent stratum layer (stratum-3, etc.) will add an additional 1/2-100 ms of inaccuracy.\n\nBased on the above, A stratum -1 server is more acurate than stratum-2 server, Similarly a stratum-2 server is more acurate than stratum-3 ser\n\nver.\n\nIt makes sense because lower stratum servers are closer to reference clock i.e stratum -0 device and thus more acurate.\n\nBut when I read following link, it gives me conflicting information:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol\n\nNTP uses a hierarchical, semi-layered system of levels of clock sources. Each level of this hierarchy is termed a\n\nstratumand is assigned a layer number starting with 0 (zero) at the top. The stratum level defines its distance from the reference clock and exists to prevent cyclical dependencies in the hierarchy. It is important to note that the stratum is not an indication of quality or reliability, it is common to find stratum 3 time sources that are higher quality than other stratum 2time sources. This definition of stratumis also different from the notion of clock strata used in telecommunication systems.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nThanks a lot have a great day.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the reader's understanding that there's no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose.

Since the quality of the links between hops, and the NTP stratum servers, can impact NTP accuracy, lower stratum doesn't always guarantee better time. I.e. a stratum 4 server might have more accurate time than a stratum 2 server; similar to a network path with 4 hops might offer better throughput and/or latency than a network path with only 2 hops.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the reader's understanding that there's no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose.
