        "text": "Dear Experts,\n\nWe are facing a NTP syncing issue at one CUCM subscriber at one of our customer.\n\nCUCM version is 8.6.2 and Cisco switch is working as external ntp server cucm cluster.\n\nCUCM Publisher showing synchronized with external ntp server (utils ntp status) with stratum value 6, but this (cucm pub) showing \"test- ntp_stratum failed\" when we do 'utils diagnose test' on it.\n\nAt 1 subscriber 'utils ntp status' showing synchronized with local ip address of it but not with publisher ip address and there is 5 minutes time difference due to this all Cisco IP Phones which are registered to this particular subscriber showing this 5 min time difference. But other 2 CUCM subscriber in this cluster have not any such issue.\n\nTroubleshooting done..\n\n1. Restarted ntp service at pub and problematic sub (utils ntp restart).\n\n2. Re added ntp ip from CUCM pub and made the entry again.\n\n3. Rebooted the problematic subscriber.\n\nplease suggest what else can be done to resolve this issue.\n\nSuresh\n\nHi Suresh,\n\nPub stratum value should always be less than or equal to 3. You might want to change it.\n\nIs the NTP server defined in OS admin, accessible? Please go to OS admin and check. If it is not, please correct that.\n\nPlease share the complete output of \"utils ntp status\" from all the nodes in the cluster.\n\nAlso share the name of the servers in the above IP address.\n\nAre you getting any ntp related alerts on RTMT? If yes, please mention those.\n\nWhat is the stratum value of external NTP server?\n\nRegards,\n\nRonak Agarwal\n\nHi Ronak,\n\nThanks for sparing time for this (+5)\n\nstartum value is seems to be good, actually 'stratum value 3 or less than it' means numerically it should be a greater value between (3 to 9).\n\nNTP server is showing accessible from OS admin page of pub.\n\nunder 'utils ntp status' all nodes showing publisher IP and local IP both, but problematic subscriber'ntp pointing to its local IP.\n\nOn RTMT I have not seen any alert regarding to it.\n\nSuresh"
