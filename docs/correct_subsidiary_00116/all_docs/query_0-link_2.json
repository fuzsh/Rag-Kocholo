        "text": "Node Timing Parameters\n\nSONET timing parameters must be set for each Cisco ONS 15454 Cisco NCS shelf. Each ONS 15454 independently accepts its timing reference from one of three sources: The NCS independently accepts its timing reference from the internal ST3 clock of the control card.\n\nThe building integrated timing supply (BITS) pins on the ONS 15454 backplane (ANSI) or MIC-C/T/P coaxial connectors (ETSI).\n\nAn OC-N/STM-N card installed in the ONS 15454. The card is connected to a node that receives timing through a BITS source.\n\nThe internal ST3 clock on the control card.\n\nYou can set ONS 15454 timing to one of three modes: external, line, or mixed. If timing is received from a BITS source, set ONS 15454 timing to external. If timing is received from an OC-N/STM-N card, set the timing to line. The BITS connection on Cisco ONS 15454 M6 Cisco NCS 2006 shelf is through the external connection unit (ECU) and is through the power module on Cisco ONS 15454 M2 Cisco NCS 2002 shelf.\n\nIn typical ONS 15454 NCS networks:\n\nOne node is set to external. The external node derives its timing from a BITS source wired to the BITS backplane pins. The BITS source, in turn, derives its timing from a primary reference source (PRS) such as a Stratum 1 clock or global positioning satellite (GPS) signal.\n\nThe other nodes are set to line. The line nodes derive timing from the externally timed node through the OC-N/STM-N trunk (span) cards. The DWDM node normally derives timing from the line using the OSCM or OSC-CSM card that are inside an OC-3/STM-1 channel.\n\nYou can set three timing references for each ONS 15454 NCS. The first two references are typically two BITS-level sources, or two line-level sources optically connected to a node with a BITS source. The third reference is usually assigned to the internal clock provided on every ONS 15454 NCS control cards. However, if you assign all three references to other timing sources, the internal clock is always available as a backup timing reference. The internal clock is a Stratum 3 (ST3), so if an ONS 15454 NCS node becomes isolated, timing is maintained at the ST3 level.\n\nThe CTC Maintenance > Timing > Report tab show current timing information for an ONS 15454 NCS, including the timing mode, clock state and status, switch type, and reference data.\n\nCaution\n\nMixed timing allows you to select both external and line timing sources. However, Cisco does not recommend its use because it can create timing loops. Use this mode with caution.\n\nThe OC3 port of the TNC/TNCE/TSC/TSCE/TNCS/TNCS-O card can be set as the timing reference. In the NCS 2002 shelf, BITS-2 is not supported.\n\nThe TNCS-O card does not support OC3 timing as the OSC and OTDR ports on the TNCS-O card support the FE payload only.\n\nWhen you provision timing reference on a control card and it is locked, but the reference is lost in less than 140 seconds due to any reason, the system Phase Lock Loop (PLL) state changes. The system PLL state changes to FREE-RUN state when provisioning the TNC card or it changes to HOLDOVER state when provisioning the TNCS-2, TNCS-2O, and TNCP card.\n\nProcedures for Cisco ONS 15454 and Cisco NCS Timing\n\nThis section contains the procedure related to Cisco ONS 15454 and Cisco NCS timing.\n\nNTP-G53 Set Up Timing\n\nSUMMARY STEPS\n\nComplete the DLP-G95 Set Up External or Line Timing task if an external building integrated timing supply (BITS) source is available.
