Packet switches can operate at a number of different levels in a protocol suite; although the exact technical details differ, fundamentally they all perform the same function: they store and forward packets.Physical layerlowest layer of the seven layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model of computer networking.PKIpublic key infrastructurePortA virtual data connection between computer programs connected through a computer networkRDPremote desktop protocolRouterA router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks (as opposed to a network switch, which connects data lines from one single network). When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the addres information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.RSVPresource reservation protocolSDNsoftware defined networkingSDN ArchitectureThe SDN architecure is:\n\nDirectly programmable: Network control is directly programmable because it is decoupled from forwarding functions.\n\nAgile: Abstracting control from forwarding lets administrators dynamically adjust network-wide traffic flow to meet changing needs.\n\nCentrally managed: Network intelligence is (logically) centralized in software-based SDN controllers that maintain a global view of the network, which appears to applications and policy engines as a single, logical switch.\n\nProgrammatically configured: SDN lets network managers configure, manage, secure, and optimize network resources very quickly via dynamic, automated SDN programs, which they can write themselves because the programs do not depend on proprietary software.\n\nOpen standards-based and vendor-neutral: When implemented through open standards, SDN simplifies network design and operation because instructions are provided by SDN controllers instead of multiple, vendor-specific devices and protocols.\n\nSDN ControllerA software entity that has exclusive control over an abstract set of data plane resources. An SDN controller may also offer an abstracted information model instance to at least one client.SLAservice level agreementSNMPsimple network management protocolSwitchA network switch (also called switching hub, bridging hub, officially MAC bridge) is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. A network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports.TCPtransmission control protocolTLStransport-layer securityUDPuser datagram protocolVirtualizationan abstraction whose selection criterion is dedication of resources to a particular client of application. When the context is general, for example when speaking of virtual network elements (VNEs), the term virtual may be used even when abstract might suffice. Virtual is also sometimes used colloquially to mean non-physical.VMvirtual machineWANwide area networkWLANwireless local area network"
