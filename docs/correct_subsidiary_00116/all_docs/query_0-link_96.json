        "text": "2. • Industry- Computer Networking • Headquarter- San Jose, California • Founded in 1984 by a small group of computer scientists from Stanford University • Leaders in the development of Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking technologies. • Company's core development area- routing and switching, home networking, IP telephony, optical networking, security, storage area networking, and wireless technology. • Also provides a broad range of service offerings, including technical support and advanced services.\n\n3. YEAR EVENT 1995 Cisco introduced applications for selling products and services in the website. 1996 Cisco introduced “Networked Strategy” to foster its relationship with the supplier,customer,manufacturer,distributor etc. It started product configuration and order placement online. 2000 More than 70% of Cisco orders were online 2001 Market demand decreased due to downturn resulting in huge loss Recent Steps implemented to recover the loss and make the Cisco supply chain more flexible to market demand\n\n4. Enable Cisco’s success by delivering ADAPTABLE, INNOVATIVE, and SCALABLE SUPPLY CHAIN SERVICES that OPTIMIZE CUSTOMER OUTCOMES\n\n5. CISCO DOMINATE NETWORK MARKET (2000-01)\n\n6. • Cisco supply chain is highly diverse, extensive & global with more than 300 product families. • Most of the products uses a configure-to-order (CTO) production model. • A large percentage of Cisco growth comes through acquisitions. • A notable exception was the Cisco acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in 2005. • Scientific Atlanta set top boxes and modems are fixed- configuration products have cost structure and sourcing strategy different from Cisco core products. • They use a build-to-stock (BTS) production model.\n\n7. In addition to more than 1000 suppliers, along with manufacturing partners and logistics providers, the Cisco supply chain encompasses: ● 16 CTO manufacturing sites ● 4 BTS sites ● 8 strategic logistics centers ● 25,000-plus orderable product IDs (about 25 percent assemble-to-order, 75 percent spares) ● Millions of shipments annually (for example, approximately 9 million cartons shipped in the six months ending March 2014).\n\n8. In May 2001 Cisco Systems had to write off $2.2 billion in inventory. • Cisco relies on contract manufacturers for final assembly (that is, tier-1 suppliers). • Contract manufacturers are supplied by component producers (that is, tier-2 suppliers) • who in turn are supplied by commodity suppliers (that is, tier-3 suppliers). The Largest Inventory Write-down\n\n9. • Only tied in the contract manufacturers. • Overlapping of the orders • Artificially inflated demand for the components. • Cisco ordered large amounts of the scare components; demand increases thus the price increases.\n\n10. An imbalance between supply and demand caused router customers to over-order, which created a greater sense of scarce supply and further over-ordering at higher tiers in the supply chain.\n\n13. INNOVATE PLAN\n\n14. SOURCE MAKE\n\n15. QUALITY DELIVER"
