        "text": "What Is an NTP Server?\n\nAn NTP (Network Time Protocol) server is a dedicated server that synchronizes the time across network devices by sending the current time over the Internet.\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for retrieving and correcting time data between servers on a network and providing accurate current time to client PCs. It ensures network devices such as PCs and routers are synchronized in time, preventing problems caused by time discrepancies.\n\nCurrently, NTP servers provide extremely accurate time measurements based on atomic clocks, crucial for maintaining network synchronization.\n\nUses of NTP Servers\n\nNTP servers are utilized by a wide range of devices, from home and office PCs to network equipment. Various organizations also rely on NTP servers, including:\n\nNational and private universities\n\nMajor telecommunications providers\n\nMajor corporations\n\nAstronomical observation sites, such as the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan\n\nIndependent administrative agencies in the information field\n\nPrinciple of NTP Servers\n\nThe second is defined based on the radiation period of a cesium-133 atom, a method providing the highest precision for time measurement. This definition is the standard unit in the International System of Units (SI). In Japan, the standard time is maintained by the NICT (National Institute of Information and Communications Technology).\n\nHierarchical Structure of NTP\n\nNTP uses a hierarchical structure, known as Stratum, for load balancing. Stratum 0 refers to the atomic clock, while Stratum 1 consists of servers like NICT's NTP servers, which receive time from Stratum 0 and distribute it. To avoid overloading Stratum 1 servers, additional layers like Stratum 2 are used, though they may have slightly less accuracy.\n\nOther Information on NTP Servers\n\n1. NTP Servers and Quartz Crystals\n\nQuartz crystals are traditional timekeeping devices, vibrating with a fixed period when voltage is applied. This method, used in PC hardware, deviates by approximately one second per million seconds, leading to synchronization issues in networked computers. NTP servers, obtaining time from atomic clocks, provide a more accurate time to network devices.\n\n2. Major Public NTP Servers\n\nPublic NTP servers are available for general use. Notable examples include NICT's servers (ntp.nict.jp) and Cloudflare's service. Google also offers public NTP servers based on their atomic clocks, ensuring high accuracy.\n\n3. How to Set Up NTP Servers\n\nSetting up an NTP server varies by OS. For Windows:"
