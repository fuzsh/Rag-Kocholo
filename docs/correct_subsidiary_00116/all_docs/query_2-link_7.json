In this case I would set all switches to use three separate sources from the ntp.org pool (so 15 in total) and get the switches to peer with each other. This way you get a large number of sources and your switches will arbitrate between themselves. If you lose your Internet connection, the switches will be stable as a group and if one has a bad internal clock it will be held in place by the others. Additionally, if a switch reboots, its clock will be declared insane until it is synced to the arbitrated time.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nDave\n\nThanks for your replay but i suppose that the network not connected to internet and the time is configured manually in the two cores\n\n- Already the distribution switch is sync with Cores\n\n-And also Access switches is Sync with Distribution switches"
