        "text": "Achieving your Cisco Certified Networking Associate, or CCNA, certification requires more than just studying. Instead, it takes a true in-depth understanding of network fundamentals and network security technologies covered in the CCNA material as outlined by Cisco. Our updated CCNA practice test has been redesigned to reflect the Cisco CCNA Routing and Switching 200-125 requirements found in the ICND1 and 2 version 3.0 curriculum.\n\nWith the 200-125 CCNA Routing and Switching exam that launched in mid-2016, Cisco made some much-needed changes to steer the certification away from topics covered in previous exams, such as frame relay, and focus more on modern routing and switching technologies.\n\nA few of the major changes included an added emphasis on cloud computing and supplementary network services, such as DNS, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Network Time Protocol (NTP). Additionally, Cisco added more Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) topics to the exam material. Lastly, you'll likely notice an increased focus on modern WAN technologies, including dynamic multipoint VPN and site-to-site VPN connectivity options.\n\nIn 2019, Cisco announced a new CCNA Routing and Switching exam. Beginning Feb. 24, 2020, the new 200-301 exam will replace the existing 200-125 exam. If you've been studying for your CCNA using the version 3.0 study materials, it is highly advisable you take the older 200-125 exam while you still can.\n\nThis CCNA practice test covers the appropriate range of topics you can expect when taking the CCNA Routing and Switching exam. The practice questions are in no particular order and provide a realistic example of what you should expect."
