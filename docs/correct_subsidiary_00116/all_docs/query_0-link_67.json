        "text": "[This post was originally teased on Medium – check it out and follow me there too.]\n\n[Update: As of April 2023 I’m an employee of Cisco again, with access to the employee discounts, and I’ve started rolling back to a Meraki plant. I’ll write a post by the end of the year detailing the reasons and choices, once I’m done.]\n\nI’m a big fan of Meraki, but now that I haven’t been an employee of Cisco for over two years*, I no longer have the free license renewals or the employee purchase discounts on new products and licenses. So October 28, 2022, was the end of my Meraki era. (Technically a month later, but I needed a plan by October 28 just in case.)\n\nI needed a replacement solution that wouldn’t set me back over a thousand dollars a year, and my original plan was to use a Sophos SG310 either with the Sophos home firewall version or PFsense or the like. I even got the dual 10gig module for it, so that I could support larger internal networks and work with higher speed connectivity when the WAN links go above 1Gbps. I racked it up with a gigabit PoE switch with 10gig links, and now a patch panel and power switching module.\n\nBut I didn’t make the time to figure it out and build an equivalent solution in time.\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Omada?\n\nSometime in early to mid 2022 I discovered that TP-Link had a cloud-manageable solution called Omada.\n\nIt’s similar in nature to Meraki’s cloud management, but far less polished. But on the flip side, licensing 12 Omada devices would cost less than $120/year, vs about $1500/year (or $3k for 3 years) with Meraki. So I figured I’d give it a try.\n\nThe core element of the Omada ecosystem is the router. Currently they have two models, the ER605 at about $60-70, and the ER7206 at about $150. I went with the ER605, one version 1 without USB failover (for home, where I have two wireline ISPs), and one version 2 model with USB failover (for my shop where I have one wireline ISP and plan to set up cellular failover).\n\nYou’ll note I said cloud-manageable above. That’s a distinction for Omada compared to Meraki, in that you can manage the Omada devices individually per unit (router, switch, access point), or through a controller model.\n\nThe controller has three deployment models:\n\nOn-site hardware (OC200 at $100, for up to 100 devices, or OC300 at $160, for up to 500 devices)\n\nOn-site or virtualized software controller, free, self-managed\n\nCloud-based controller, $9.95 per device per year (30 day free trial for up to 10 devices I believe)\n\nI installed the software controller on a VM on my Synology array, but decided to go web-based so I could manage it from anywhere without managing access into my home network.\n\nWorking out the VPN kinks\n\nThe complication to my network is that I have VPN connectivity between home and the shop across town. I also had a VPN into a lab network in the garage. Meraki did this seamlessly with what you could call a cloud witness or gateway – didn’t have to open any holes or even put my CPE into bridge mode. With Omada, I did have to tweak things, and it didn’t go well at first.\n\nI was in bridge mode on Comcast CPE on both ends of the VPN, and did the “manual” setup of the VPN, but never established a connection. I tried a lot of things myself, even asked on the Omada subreddit (to no direct avail).\n\nI came up with Plan B including the purchase of a Meraki MX65. I was ready drop $300-500 to license the MX65 at home, MX64 at the shop, and the MR56 access point at home to keep things going, with other brands of switches to replace the 4-5 Meraki switches I had in use.\n\nAs a hail-mary effort, I posted on one of the Omada subreddits. The indirect help I got from Reddit had me re-read other documentation on TP-Link’s site, wherein I found the trick to the VPN connectivity – IKEv1, not v2. Once I made that change, the link came up, and the “VPN Status” in Insights gave me the connectivity.\n\nThe last trick, which Meraki handled transparently when you specified exported subnets, was routing between the two. I had to go to Settings -> Transmission -> Routing and add a static route with next hop to the other side of the tunnel. Suddenly it worked, and I was able to connect back and forth.\n\nLooking at the old infrastructure\n\nMy old Meraki network had 12 devices, including three security appliances, four switches, a cellular gateway, and four access points. The home network used the MX84 as the core, with a MS42p as core switch, a MS220-24 as the “workbench” switch on the other side of the room, and a MS220-8P downstairs feeding the television, TiVo, printers, MR42 access point, and my honey’s workstation, connected via wireless link with a DLink media access point in client mode. I also had a MS510TXPP from Netgear, primarily to provide 2.5GbE PoE for the Meraki MR56 access point.\n\nThere was a SG550XG-8F8T in my core “rack” (a 4U wall-mountable rack sitting on top of the MS42p switch) but it was not in use at the time – I didn’t have any 10GBase-T gear, and the MS42p had four 10GbE SFP+ slots for my needs.\n\nThe garage lab had a SG500XG-8F8T behind the Z1 teleworker appliance. TP-Link powerline feeds that network from the home office.\n\nThe remote shop had a MX64, MS220-8P, and MR18, as well as the MG21E with a Google Fi sim card.\n\nSo there was a lot to replace, and complicate in the process.\n\nLooking at the new infrastructure\n\nThe new core router is the TP-Link ER605, feeding the MS510TXPP switch for mgig and 10gig distribution (including WiFi), with another downlink to a TL-SG2008P switch ($90 at time of purchase) which offers 4 PoE+ ports and integrated monitoring with Omada.\n\nThe ER605 has front-facing ports, so I have those cables going into the patch panel to connect Internet uplinks and the PoE switch. On the SG2008P, ports are on the back and LEDs are on the front, so I have all 8 ports going to the patch panel and they feed things from there.\n\nThe MS510TXPP has downlinks to the powerline network, a SG500-48X switch across the room connected by 10 Gigabit DAC, and a few other things in the office.\n\nI have the wireless needs fulfilled by a Netgear Nighthawk router in AP mode, and a TP-Link Omada EAP650 access point that needs some tuning. I expect to replace the Nighthawk with the EAP650 at some point, and I have a Motorola Q11 mesh network kit coming soon which could replace much of the wifi in the house.\n\nThe downstairs network is still fed by the DLink wireless bridge (as a client of the Nighthawk), but now it has a random Linksys 8 port switch serving the first floor needs.\n\nThe garage lab still has the SG500XG, bridged via powerline, and very limited hardware running due to California electric prices.\n\nIn the shop, I have the ER605v2, feeding a random 8-port TP-Link unmanaged switch for now. I’m thinking about getting an Omada switch there, and I recently installed a UeeVii WiFi6 access point (acquired through Amazon Vine, review and photos here) which is more than enough to cover the 500 square feet I need there.\n\nWhy’d it take so long to post?\n\nI had found an Etsy seller who made 3d printed rackmount accessories, and I ordered a cablemodem mount, router mount, and a 5-port keystone patch panel. I ordered December 15, shipping label was issued December 21, and I expected it right after Christmas. Alas, after a month and two shipping labels being generated, I had no gear and no useful response from the seller, so I got a refund and went with rack plan B.\n\nI took a 14″ 1U rack shelf like this one (but fewer slots and about half the price) and used zip ties to attach the router and 8-port switch to it. Not a great fit, but inside the CRS08 carpeted rack it’s not so visible.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nRight now the networks are stable, except for no wifi in the garage and occasional wifi flakiness in the house. So my next steps will be fixing the home wifi, and probably moving another AP to the garage (possibly even setting up a wireless bridge to replace the powerline connection).\n\nI am looking at some more switching, possibly upgrading the Omada switch to replace the Netgear at home, and then take the existing 8 port Omada to the shop to provide more manageability (and PoE+) over there.\n\nThe front runners for the new switch right now are the SX3008F (8 port SFP+ at $230; 16 port SX3016F is $500), SG3428X (24 port gigabit, 4 port SFP+), and the SG3210XHP-M2 (8 port 2.5GbE copper PoE + 2 SFP+ slots at $400, pretty much the same as the Netgear except with no 5GbE ports).\n\nThere are a couple of other options, like the $500 SSG3452X which is equivalent to the MS42p, but I’ll have to consider power budget and hardware budget, and what I can get sold from the retired stash this month to further fund the expansion.\n\nI also need to work out client VPN to connect in to both sites. I had client VPN on my travel laptop to the shop for a couple of years, but haven’t tried it with the new platform yet.\n\nTP-LInk supposedly has a combination router/controller/limited switch coming out this year, the ER7212 which also offers 110W PoE across eight gigabit ports. It’s apparently available in Europe for 279 Euros. Hopefully it (and other new products) will be released in the US at CES Las Vegas this week."
