        "text": "Part of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series, the Cisco ASR 9901 router is a compact high-capacity Provider Edge (PE) router that delivers 456 Gbps of nonblocking, full-duplex fabric capacity in a Two-Rack-Unit (2RU) form factor. Based on the same Cisco IOS XR software image as the other routers in the Cisco ASR 9000 Series, the Cisco ASR 9901 Router delivers the features and services found on the ASR 9000 Series platforms, allowing customers to standardize on the same Cisco IOS XR operating system. The Cisco ASR 9901 Router has an Integrated Route Switch Processor (RSP) and has 42 integrated ports that supports a combination of 1/10/100GE speeds, a GPS input for stratum-1 clocking, Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) ports, and management ports.\n\nCisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services routers deliver exceptional scale, service flexibility, and high availability to Carrier Ethernet transport networks. The router is powered by widely deployed Cisco IOS XR 64 bit operating system, an innovative self-healing, distributed operating system designed for always-on operation. The ASR 9901 sets a new standard for Layer 2 and Layer 3 10GE/1GE service density and scale to support large-scale aggregation, Data Center Interconnect (DCI), and Satellite Network Virtualization (nV) System mode on the ASR 9000 Series Router. The ASR 9901 also supports industry leading MAC-SEC encryption on all its port speeds. These versatile capabilities help operators qualify and stock one type of chassis that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2, Layer 3, DCI, or aggregation applications, thereby reducing Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and Operating Expenses (OpEx), as well as reducing the time required to develop and deploy new services."
