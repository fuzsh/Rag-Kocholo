Following establishment of the radio connection, the access point 104 may transmit a security mode command (SMC) message to the terminal 102, where it may be received by the communication interface 124.\n\nSMC security mode command\n\nthe SMC message may include integrity protection information for use by the terminal 102 to verify activation of access stratum security by the access point 104.\n\nthe integrity protection information may, for example, comprise a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or other integrity protection information for use by the security policy unit 128 to verify the integrity protection of the SMC message and to verify activation of access stratum security measures by the access point 104.\n\nthe access stratum security measures may include, for example, integrity protection and ciphering for use in communications between the terminal 102 and access point 104.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to extract the integrity protection information from an SMC message received by the terminal 102 and attempt to verify the integrity protection information so as to verify activation of access stratum security by the access point 104.\n\nsecurity policy unit 128 When security activation fails (for example, when the security policy unit 128 cannot verify the integrity protection information), the security policy unit 128 may be configured to cause the communication interface 124 to transmit a security mode failure message to the access point 104.\n\nsecurity mode failure message is used by way of example and not by way of limitation with respect to any one networking standard and thus where security mode failure messages are referred to herein, similar messages transmitted in accordance with other networking standards are within the scope of security mode failure message as used herein.\n\nvarious networking standards such as LTE standards, the access point\n\na rogue access point 104 may be specified to release the radio connection with the terminal 102 following receipt of the security mode failure message. However, a rogue access point 104 configured for launching a denial of service attack on a terminal 102 may not release the radio connection. Additionally or alternatively, a rogue access point 104 may transmit an SMC message including invalid integrity protection information to the terminal 102 each time a terminal 102 establishes a radio connection with the access point 104. Accordingly, embodiments of the invention provide solutions to mitigate such denial of service attacks by a rogue access point 104.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 When the security policy unit 128 fails to verify activation of access stratum security by the access point 104, the security policy unit 128 is configured in some embodiments of the invention to detect an occurrence of a security activation deadlock so as to mitigate the effects of a potential denial of service attack.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to detect a security activation deadlock occurrence when waiting for the access point 104 to release the radio connection following transmission of a security mode failure message to the access point 104.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 In order to detect the security activation deadlock, the security policy unit 128 may be configured to set a deadlock timer in response to transmission of the security mode failure message to the access point 104.\n\nSetting the deadlock timer in response to the transmission may comprise setting the deadlock timer concurrent with transmission of the security mode failure message, following transmission of the security mode failure message, upon receipt of an acknowledgement transmitted by the access point 104 acknowledging receipt of the security mode failure message, and/or the like.\n\nthe deadlock timer may be set to run for a predefined period of time (for example, a deadlock period), after which the deadlock timer will expire.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to detect that a security activation deadlock has occurred when the access point 104 has not released the radio connection with the terminal 102 upon expiration of the deadlock timer.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to adjust a counter value associated with the identity of the access point 104 that indicates the number of security activation deadlocks with the access point that have occurred.\n\nthe counter value may store the number of security activation deadlocks that have occurred with the access point and the security policy unit 128 may be configured to increment the counter value in response to detecting an occurrence of a security activation deadlock with the access point.\n\nthe'counter value may store a value equal to the difference between a predefined number and the number of security activation deadlocks with the access point that have occurred and the security policy unit 128 may be configured to decrement the counter value in response to detecting an occurrence of a security activation deadlock with the access point. It will be appreciated that these examples are provided merely for purposes of example and not by way of limitation and the security policy unit 128 may be configured to adjust the counter value in other ways and the counter value may indicate the number of security activation deadlocks that have occurred with the access point in other ways.\n\nthe counter value may be stored in the memory 122.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to generate a new counter value and set the value appropriately (for example, set the value to 1 to denote the occurrence of one security activation deadlock with the access point 104).\n\nthe counter value(s) stored in memory 122 may be purged and/or reset in accordance with a policy that the security policy unit 128 is configured to impose to ensure freshness of the counter value(s).\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to reset the counter value(s) periodically, upon repowering of the terminal 102, a predefined amount of time following the last security activation deadlock recorded for the counter value(s), and/or other policy.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 is further configured in some embodiments of the invention to determine that a predefined number of security activation deadlocks with the access point 104 have occurred.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to determine whether the counter value for the access point 104 has a predetermined relationship to a predefined number to determine whether a predefined number of security activation deadlocks with the access point 104 have occurred. For example, if the counter value stores a number of security activation deadlocks that have occurred and is incremented by the security policy unit 128 upon an occurrence of a security activation deadlock, the security policy unit 128 may be configured to determine whether the counter value equals the predefined number.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to determine whether the counter value equals zero. It will be appreciated, however, that these examples are provided merely as examples and not by way of limitation and the security policy unit 128 may be configured to set the counter value to other initial values, adjust the counter value in other ways upon an occurrence of a security activation deadlock, and determine whether the counter value has other predetermined relationships to the predefined number.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to identify the access point as a rogue access point based at least in part upon the determination.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to cause the communication interface 124 to autonomously release the radio connection with a rogue access point and to prevent future establishment of a radio connection with an access point 104 identified as a rogue access point.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 is configured to maintain a blacklist of access points 104 identified as rogue access points.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to store the blacklist in the memory 122.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to not select an access point(s) 104 on the blacklist when selecting an access point 104 to connect to.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to purge the blacklist and/or remove an access point 104 from the blacklist in accordance with a policy that the security policy unit 128 is configured to impose.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to purge the blacklist upon repowering of the terminal 102.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to remove an access point 104 from the blacklist after a predefined amount of time has elapsed since the access point 104 was added to the blacklist.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be further configured to disregard any list of neighboring access points 104 provided to the terminal 102 by the rogue access point 104 when selecting a new access point 104 to establish a connection with. In this regard, the security policy unit 128 may mitigate any attempt by a rogue access point 104 to deny service to the terminal 102 by encouraging the terminal 102 to select another rogue access point to connect to. In some embodiments, the security policy unit 128 is further configured to maintain a whitelist, such as may be stored in memory 122, of trusted access points 104.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may add an access point 104 to the whitelist when the security policy unit 128 has successfully verified activation of access stratum security by the access point 104 (for example, the integrity protection information included in the received SMC message is verified to be valid).\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to purge the whitelist and/or remove an access point 104 from the whitelist in accordance with a policy that the security policy unit 128 is configured to impose.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to purge the whitelist upon repowering of the terminal 102.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to remove an access point 104 from the whitelist after a predefined amount of time has elapsed since the access point 104 was added to the whitelist.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to remove an access point 104 from the whitelist if the security policy unit 128 later identifies the access point 104 as a rogue access point.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to not add an access point 104 to the blacklist even if a predefined number of security activation deadlocks have occurred with the access point 104 if the access point 104 is on the whitelist.\n\nFIG. 3 illustrates a signaling diagram of signals that may be exchanged between a terminal 102 and access point 104 according to an exemplary method for avoiding denial of service attacks by rogue access points according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.\n\nthe communication interface 124 may receive an SMC message transmitted by the access point 104.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may then attempt to verify activation of access stratum security by the access point 104 based at least in part upon integrity protection information included in the SMC message.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to transmit a security mode failure message to the access point 104, at operation 310.\n\nOperation 320 may comprise the security policy unit 128 starting a deadlock timer.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may then determine that a security activation deadlock has occurred at operation 330 upon expiration of the deadlock timer.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates a flowchart according to an exemplary method for avoiding denial of service attacks by rogue access points according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 4 illustrates operations that may be performed by the security policy unit 128.\n\nthe method may include the security policy unit 128 attempting to verify activation of access stratum security by an access point 104 with which a radio connection has been established, at operation 400.\n\nOperation 410 may comprise the security policy unit 128 detecting an occurrence of a security activation deadlock.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may then determine that a predefined number of security activation deadlocks with the access point 104 have occurred, at operation 420.\n\nOperation 430 may comprise the security policy unit 128 identifying the access point 104 as a rogue access point.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may then cause the communication interface 124 to autonomously release the radio connection with the access point 104 and may then cause the selection of another access point 104 and establishment of a connection with the selected access point 104, at operation 440.\n\nthe security policy unit 128 may be configured to cause the release of the radio connection with the access point 104 at any point after the detection of an occurrence of a security activation deadlock (for example, before operation 420 and/or before operation 430).\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates a flowchart according to an exemplary method for avoiding denial of service attacks by rogue access points according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.\n\nFIG. 5 illustrates operations that may be performed by the security policy unit 128.\n\nOperation 500 may comprise the security policy unit 128 attempting to verify activation of access stratum security by an access point 104 with which a radio connection has been established.
