I read your question wrong. Dyslexic today. :-)\n\nEdison is right, of course.\n\nInternal timing means that the CSU/DSU will use an internal circuit known as an oscillator to generate the timing source. That is considered to be a stratum-4 clock, the lowest in terms of accuracy.\n\nThe CSU/DSU which will time off of it will be set for \"line,\" of course, meaning that it is taking its timing from the signal received from the line (the SP). The receiving CSU will extract the clock from the received data and use it as its transmit clock.\n\nIf you want to know more about clocking and its relationship to ones density, B8ZS coding, etc, let me know.\n\nThanks\n\nVictor\n\nSarah:\n\nThe master/slave relationship is applicable in both models that we have discussed. Either one CSU/DSU is the master and the other at the distant end is the slave. Or both are slaves to the TELCO master.\n\nIn either case, the paradigm survives.\n\nIn the case of the TELCO providing the clock, you can look at it as though there are two separate components to the circuit with regard to timing. CSU/DSU 1 to TELCO and CSU/DSU 2 to TELCO.\n\nWhy use the TELCO? Because the TELCOs use a Stratum 4 standard, which boasts a very high rate of accuracy and extremely low frequency drift. To maintain that stability, some TELCOs use the so-called BITS system, the Building Integrated Timing Supply.\n\nMaintaining synchronized timing is of the essence in a synchronous circuit, of course. Timing drifts can cause errors on the T1 facility known as \"slips.\"\n\nSince the data clock is a derivative of the received data signal, and uses the voltage shifts from low to high of the data stream to maintain synchronization, it is important that a minimum number of \"ones\" (high voltage) bits exist in the data stream. This is called ones-density.\n\nIf more than 15 consecutive zeroes are received, a loss of synchronization can occur and you will have a timing slip.\n\nTo maintain ones density on AMI circuits, the 7th bit of every 8-bit BYTE is forced to be a one (high). This is called bit-7 stuffing. That means only 7 bits out of 8 actually represent data. At a sampling rate of 8,000 frames per second, this leaves a modified DS0 data rate of only 56kbps of data, and the other 8,000 are just timing bits.\n\nTo overcome the loss of 8,000 bits, a B8ZS circuit will replace a data pattern of 8 consecutive zeroes with a code that purposefully includes bi-polar violations (BPVs). When the receiving end receives this altered data signal with the BPVs, it will know that it was inserted at the transmitting end and that the code should be replaced with the original 8 zeroes.\n\nIn this way, all 64,000 bits per second are used for data transfer and none are wasted on timing. This is called a clear channel.\n\n2.) Im still trying to understand this question. Can you elaborate further?\n\nHTH\n\nVictor\n\nSarah:\n\nWhat that clip from the book is trying to say is that Frame Relay service providers allow clients to burst to port speed/access speed if network congestion levels permit. That is what you should be walking away with.\n\nIf the access speed is a T-1, then the carrier can allow you to burst past the CIR and up to port speed if possible. That also is limited by contractual obligations.\n\nTHE FECN and BECN bits are used to report congestion to the end nodes so that they can throttle back their send rates.\n\nThere's volumes that can be written on this, but as I suggest, the thing to walk away with is the fact that you can burst to T1 access speed if the carrier allows, and the T1, of course, uses a data clock that is derived from the T1 signal. I think that's what the book was trying to say when they mention the clock -- just another way of emphasizing that the access speed is a T1.\n\nHTH\n\nVictor\n\nThere are 3-1 DACS systems, 3-1-0 DACS systems, M13 multiplexers, statistical multiplexers, channel banks,\n\nLowest speed SONET mux Oc-3 can only provide T1, to provide subrate T1 Telco use DACS,Statistical mux etc.\n\nCan a Telco provide a WAN circuit using only DACS etc if customer office are hundreds of miles away ?\n\nIf not then these DACS are riding on SONET boxes. So now the question is, SONET is deriving clock from DACS or DACS is deriving clock from SONET.\n\nAs far as i know DACS will take clock from SONET box which in turn deriving clock from better source or BOTH DAcs & SONET derving clock from better source. If i am wrong i have no problem in learning new stufff.\n\nI posted my stuff as one of your post mentions \"Stratum 4 standard, which boasts a very high rate of accuracy and extremely low frequency drift\" whereas for SONET it is the lowest standard clock.\n\nIf you already know this then maybe for guys who dont know.

This is called a clear channel.\n\n2.) Im still trying to understand this question. Can you elaborate further?\n\nHTH\n\nVictor\n\nThanks Victor!\n\nLet me give you little context about my 2nd question.\n\nThe author explains the purpose of FECN and BECN bits in frame relay header.\n\n\" The frame relay header includes three single-bit flags that frame relay can use to help control what occurs inside the frame relay cloud. these bits can be particularly useful when one or more sites use an access rate--the clock rate of the access link--- that far exceeds the CIR of a VC. For example, if a router has a T1 frame relay access link,but only a 128-kbps CIR on a VC goes over thst link,the router can send a lot more data into frame relay network than bussiness contract with the frame relay provider allows.These bits FECN,BECN, help mitigate such situations.\"\n\nBased on the above, there is direct link between data rate ( from the router on access link) and clock rate on access link.\n\nI was just wondering what is the relation between the two? is there any mathmatical expression showing the relation between data rate and clock rate on access link?\n\nIn our case, the root cause of heavy traffic is clock rate on access link which causes the router to send more data into frame relay cloud than CIR on that VC.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nHi Victor,\n\n\"Because the TELCOs use a Stratum 4 standard, which boasts a very high rate of accuracy and extremely low frequency drift. \"\n\nAgree with most of the things mentioned in your post but Internal Clock of Telco SONET/SDH equipments is Stratum 3 clock and Telco equipments are NOT working on their internal clock. They use their internal clock if they lost the line timing from better source.\n\nTelco equipments derive their clock from a PRS (Primary Reference Source) Stratum Level 1 (Highest Level) if not than Startum 2.\n\nThe quality of clock deteriorate as it passes through several Telco equipments and qulaity of CSU/DSU clcok are considred as Startum 4 clock.\n\n\"To maintain that stability, some TELCOs use the so-called BITS system, the Building Integrated Timing Supply\"\n\nAll SONET/SDH boxex have BITS (Building Intergrated Timing Supply ), so its not that some Telco are using.\n\n\"but Internal Clock of Telco SONET/SDH equipments is Stratum 3 clock\"\n\nSONET uses stratum 3 clocks, yes. SONET is not the only method and system used in a T-carrier system. There are 3-1 DACS systems, 3-1-0 DACS systems, M13 multiplexers, statistical multiplexers, channel banks, etc. The timing standard used by a particular T-carrier sub-system depends on where the NE (network element) sits in the TELCOs network architecture with reference to the source clock.\n\n\"Telco equipments are NOT working on their internal clock.\"\n\nI never said they were. I didn't mention at all where the TELCO gets its source clock from. But since you are mentioning it, yes, the TELCOs get their clocks from a stratum-1 timing source.\n\nHTH\n\nVictor\n\nThere are 3-1 DACS systems, 3-1-0 DACS systems, M13 multiplexers, statistical multiplexers, channel banks,\n\nLowest speed SONET mux Oc-3 can only provide T1, to provide subrate T1 Telco use DACS,Statistical mux etc.\n\nCan a Telco provide a WAN circuit using only DACS etc if customer office are hundreds of miles away ?\n\nIf not then these DACS are riding on SONET boxes.
