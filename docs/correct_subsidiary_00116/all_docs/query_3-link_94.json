        "text": "Today's routers usually incorporate L2 switches, and many modern switches include Layer 3 routing capability. Routers offered by Cisco, the producer of the vast majority of the industry's routers, have improved significantly in function and performance and Cisco now makes a comprehensive portfolio that features routers engineered to meet the needs of users from individual telecommuters to nationwide ISPs.\n\nThe most recent Integrated Services Routers released by Cisco have the performance and built-in functionality to manage data voice and video as well as virtualization while at the same time offering high availability, web-based management, easy extensibility, and advanced security and compliance. Cisco's ISR routers allow you to build a solid foundation for an IT environment that can grow seamlessly as you hire more employees, open extra sites, activate additional services, extend your network to customers and partners, and build an expanding mobile user base. Progent's Cisco CCIE network engineers can provide fast and economical online support to assist your company to select, configure, administer, update, and support Cisco's latest router technology and can help you to maintain your legacy routers or migrate non-disruptively to Cisco's current router products.\n\nCisco Routers for Home and Small Offices and Branch Offices\n\nCisco's routers for smaller businesses and branch offices provide low-cost and dependable entry-level solutions that allow small groups of users to share safe access to the Internet. All these single-configuration desktop routers feature at least four 10/100 Ethernet ports with Wi-Fi options plus integrated firewall for enhanced security. Built for easy setup, administration, and troubleshooting, Cisco's entry-level routers reduce total cost of ownership by cutting equipment and operational expenses. Progent's remote troubleshooting specialists have in-depth experience providing fast and affordable technical help for small companies to set up and maintain these devices, and Progent's Cisco-certified CCIE network consultants can assist you to determine how Cisco's small office routers can add to the strategic value of your information system.\n\nCisco ISR 900 Series Integrated Services Routers\n\nCisco's ISR 900 Series desktop routers are small-footprint, quiet, set-configuration devices designed for small to medium-sized businesses, branch offices, and home offices. These entry-level routers have four managed GE LAN ports and offer Metro Ethernet, LTE, and DSL WAN connectivity. The ISR 900 router family delivers three times the IPsec throughput of Cisco's ISR 800 Series family of routers. All ISR 900 Series routers feature Group Encrypted TransportVPN (GETVPN), DMVPN, FlexVPN, and firewall. VPN performance is as high as 250 Mbps. All models allow up to 50 virtual LANs. Supported dynamic failover technology for business continuity include Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol, Hot Standby Router Protocol, and Multigroup HSRP. Provisioning and management can be done with Cisco CP Express, Cisco DNA Center, and Cisco IOS Software.

ISR G2 routers introduce a design that protects past investments in modules for older ISR routers and reduces future costs by allowing field installation of additional modules when they become available. Compared to previous ISR routers, Cisco's ISR G2 routers offer 2-7 times more throughput, substantially more, and easier support. All Cisco Integrated Services G2 routers offer gigabit switching and include multi-core CPUs and ultra-fast fabric for faster performance. ISR Generation 2 routers also offer smart power control for improved energy conservation.\n\nA major advance with Integrated Services Generation 2 routers is the IOS Software Universal image which includes all of the Cisco IOS feature sets so that you can rapidly authorize and deploy extra services when required without having to acquire and copy a new IOS image over to yourCisco router. Progent's group of Cisco-certified CCIE network consultants can provide world-class skills to assist your business to design, configure, and maintain multi-site installations of Cisco ISR G2 routers that improve branch office efficiency and cut the price of expansion and maintenance.\n\nCisco's ISR 800 Series Routers\n\nThe 800 Series of ISR routers has been functionally replaced by the higher performance Cisco ISR 900 family but is still widely used. Cisco's comprehensive line of 800 Series ISR routers is made up of desktop, fanless appliances intended for small businesses, branch offices, retail shops, telecommuters, and clients of broadband service providers. A wealth of models in the 800 Series product line have been released with various options over the course of many years. The 881 line of ISR routers suggests the wide selection of options offered within the Cisco 800 product family. Models in Cisco's 881 router portfolio can support converged media networks by delivering voice and video, wireless and data in a single integrated router and switch. Advanced data protection can include encryption, VPN tunneling, firewall, and URL filtering. For survivability, available options for Cisco 881 ISR routers include redundant wide area network connections or support for landline broadband WAN connections like DSL as well as multiple cellular 3G and 4G wireless connections all on a single desktop appliance.\n\nCisco's 881 of ISR routers allow a broad range of deployment scenarios\n\nThe basic Cisco 881 router features a 4-port 10/100-Mbps managed switch with up to 15 Mbps throughput, the ability to handle up to 20 users, 2-port integrated Power over Ethernet, and IPv6 compatibility. The Cisco 881W ISR router supports 802.11g/n Wi-Fi. The 881 SRST router includes 4 FXS ports and 1 FXO port for public-switched-telephone-network (PSTN) failover with Cisco SRST. With a Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) feature license, Cisco's 881 ISR router supports SIP trunk connectivity as a replacement for outdated Primary Rate Interface (PRI) lines or foreign exchange-office (FXO) voice connectivity to a PSTN service provider. CUBE-based SIP trunks also support offsite call agents in Cisco Call Center deployments.\n\n4000 Series ISR Routers\n\nCisco's 4000 Line of ISR Routers are compact modular and scalable routers intended for businesses with multiple branch offices and remote users requiring direct communication with private data centers and public clouds via VPNs and the Internet. The 4000 series provides the throughput needed for hybrid WAN environments to accommodate mobile users, cloud services, and HD multimedia applications by utilizing WAN optimization, deep packet inspection, and traffic-management techniques. Models in Cisco's 4000 Series run Cisco's powerful IOS XE software, come in a 1-rack-unit (RU) or 2RU package, can handle as much as 2 Gbps of traffic, and can include up to 3 interface slots, 2 service module slots, 4 integrated 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, and 8 CPU core integrated server modules. Cisco ISR 4000 models support integrated Gigabit Ethernet, T1/E1, T3/E3, PR1, xDSL and other interfaces. To manage unified communications, the 400o ISR provides comprehensive edge support for policy-enhanced SBC, telephony fault tolerance, and Time Division Multiplexing gateways.\n\nThe primary difference between Cisco's 4400 ISR and 4300 Series is dual power supply capability in the 4400 Series, providing a greater degree of availability. The 4321 ISR Router has a 1 RU desktop package with two network interface modules (NIMs), delivers as much as 100 Mbps performance, and can handle 240 Digital Voice and Video Channels.
