        "text": "All network devices in computer networks connect and communicate with one another. But the topic of how one device would uniquely identify the other devices in the network is something that always crosses our minds. Only with the aid of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP addresses is this feasible. There is uncertainty between these two once more. So let's use an example to explain it to them before we define it.\n\nSuppose someone has to deliver a package to someone else. To effectively send the courier, the sender must provide two details about the recipient. The two items are the receiver's name and address, which may include a house number, street, city, state, and pin code (to identify the right person to deliver the courier specifically). If we apply this example to networking, the MAC address will be the address of the particular node where we want to send the data, and the IP address will be the address of the network connection where several devices may be present.\n\nA MAC address and an IP address both help identify a device specifically on the internet. The IP address is generated by the ISP (Internet Service Provider), whereas the MAC address is provided by the Network Interface Controller (NIC)manufacturer. There are significant differences between a MAC address and an IP address. The IP address of a device is crucial for determining a network's connection (using which the device is connecting to the network). On the other hand, the MAC address guarantees the computer device's precise location. It enables us to uniquely identify a certain device on the access network.\n\nLet's learn a little bit more about them before we get into more detail about the distinction between MAC address and IP address.\n\nOur MAC Address Lookup utility provides a comprehensive overview of the MAC Addresses of networking cards that have been installed on your computer or other devices.\n\nWith a single click, you will obtain all information associated with a device's media access control address, including the name of the manufacturing company and the country of origin.\n\nYou can find your MAC address vendor by using the following MAC Address tool:\n\nA MAC address, which is also known as a hardware or physical address, is an unique alphanumeric identifier consisting of 12 characters. MAC address is allocated to a network interface controller (NIC) and functions as a network address when communications occur within a network segment. Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are just a few of the IEEE 802 networking technologies that frequently employ this application.\n\nSince device manufacturers are the primary assignors of MAC addresses, they are frequently denoted as burned-in addresses, Ethernet hardware addresses, physical addresses, or hardware addresses. A firmware mechanism or hardware component, such as the card's read-only memory, may be utilized to store each address.\n\nMAC addresses are used in the data link layer, sometimes referred to as Layer 2. MAC addresses are used to address and identify data packets at the data link layer, providing a distinct identity to devices inside a local area network (LAN). Every device connected to a network has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it, much like every house has a unique postal address.\n\nA MAC address is a 48-bit identifier, often expressed as a sequence of 12 hexadecimal digits (0 to 9, a to f, or A to F). These numbers are commonly arranged in pairs and separated by colons or dashes. Six groups of two hexadecimal numerals, separated by hyphens, colons, or not at all, constitute MAC addresses. The MAC address 00-B0-D0-64-C1-36 is an example.\n\nHexadecimal 12-digit digits make up MAC addresses (48 bits in length). MAC addresses are often written using one of the following formats, according to convention:\n\nMM:MM:MM:SS:SS:SS\n\nMMMM-MMSS-SSSS\n\nMMM.MMM.SSS.SSS\n\nThe ID number of the adapter manufacturer is found in the first 24 bits of a MAC address. An organization that sets Internet standards oversees these IDs. Every vendor must register and acquire MAC prefixes that are given by the IEEE. Vendors often have many prefix numbers linked to their goods. For the following MAC address, 00:A0:C9:15:C8:29, the initial 00A0C9 identifies Intel Corporation as the maker.\n\nExamples of OUI for well-known vendors are as follows:\n\nCC:46 :D6 : Cisco\n\n3C:5A :B4 : Google, Inc.\n\n3C:D9:2B : Hewlett Packard\n\n00:9A :CD : HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO.,LTD\n\nThe least significant digits of a MAC address serve as a unique identifier for the particular device (S). Each device produced by the same manufacturer is assigned a distinct 24-bit number within the range of devices with the same vendor prefix. Hardware from many suppliers may have overlapping device address segments.\n\nFigure 1. MAC Address Structure\n\nThere are three types of MAC address:\n\nUnicast: Unicast MAC address represents a specific NIC or onboard NIC ports in the network. The frame is intended to be received by only one NIC if the LSB (least significant bit) of the first octet of an address is set to zero. The originating machine's MAC address is always unicast.\n\nMulticast: A group of devices (or NICs in Layer 2) is represented by a multicast MAC address. The OUI 01-00-5E (first 3-bytes or 24 bits) has been designated by the IEEE for multicast MAC addresses. The network application or device that wishes to transmit data within the group is responsible for determining the remaining 24 bits. The prefix 01-00-5E is always the beginning of a multicast MAC address.\n\nBroadcast: All devices in the network are represented by the broadcast MAC address. The broadcast MAC address has been reserve by the IEEE. It is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF. This address can be utilized as the destination MAC address by any device that wishes to transmit data to all devices on the network.\n\nThe MAC addresses of every device on a subnet of a network are unique. A MAC address serves as a unique identifier for various devices connected to a local network, such as computers, cellphones, game consoles, and other similar devices. When accessing the internet, networking protocols use this address at the data connection layer to guarantee that data packets are sent to the correct destination. By including the MAC address into the packet header, routers and switches can accurately direct the data without requiring any action on your part.\n\nMAC addresses are highly helpful when identifying network difficulties like IP address issues.\n\nMAC addresses are advantageous for network diagnostics since they are static, unlike dynamic IP addresses, which can fluctuate. Because of this, a MAC address provides a more trustworthy means for a network administrator to identify data senders and receivers on the network.\n\nSome of the beneficial use cases of MAC addresses are as follows:\n\nOnly the ports that need to see the packet are forwarded by network switches, which keep a list of all the MAC addresses observed at each port.\n\nMAC addresses are frequently used by wireless access points to control access. They only permit access for known devices with the right passwords (MAC addresses are unique and identify devices).\n\nThe MAC address is used by DHCP servers to recognize devices and assign some of them fixed IP addresses.\n\nEvery internet-connected device is given a distinctive ID called a MAC (Media Access Control) address that identifies it when it is linked to a particular network.\n\nTo locate your Windows computer's MAC address follow the steps given below:\n\nIn the bottom-left corner of your computer, click the Start button.\n\nOpen the command prompt either by choosing \"Run\" or by typing \"cmd\" into the search box at the bottom of the Start menu.\n\nType ipconfig /all.\n\nThe 12 digits that make up the MAC address are given as the Physical Address (00:1A:C2:7B:00:48, for example). Every network device, including wireless and Ethernet ones, has a unique MAC address.\n\nTo locate your Apple computer's MAC address, you may follow the next steps:\n\nOpen System Preferences in the Apple menu.\n\nChoose Network.\n\nClick Advanced after selecting Airport for the wireless adapter MAC (the MAC address is listed as Airport ID).\n\nFor the network cable adapter MAC, select Built-in Ethernet, Advanced, and Ethernet (listed as Ethernet ID).\n\nTo locate your Linux computer's MAC address you may follow the next instructions:\n\nStart typing \"network\" in the Activities overview window.\n\nFor the panel to open, click Network.\n\nFrom the left pane, select the Wi-Fi or wired option for the device.\n\nThe Hardware Address on the right will show the connected device's MAC address.\n\nThe hardware address for the wireless device will be displayed as the MAC address when you click the button in the Details panel.\n\nIt is commonly known that a VPN can conceal an IP address, but what about a MAC address? Can websites monitor it or is it visible on your router even while using a VPN?\n\nWhether you use a VPN or not, websites cannot see your device's MAC address, since it is stripped from your internet traffic as soon as it leaves your router. The website cannot even determine your router's MAC address because it typically requires numerous hops through multiple devices to reach it.\n\nEven if the MAC address is not immediately visible to websites, there are a few indirect techniques to obtain it, including IPv6 extraction and device script execution.\n\nA router is part of a local network, and your device's MAC address is used to communicate with it. Using a VPN to conceal your IP address on the public internet would not conceal your MAC address from a router. You would be unable to access the internet if your MAC address were hidden from a router.\n\nThe term \"Internet Protocol\", for which the abbreviation IP stands, is a set of guidelines that control the format of data exchanged via a local or public network.\n\nAn IP address is an identification tool for network connections. A link in a network receives what is known as a \"logical address\" from the network. IP addresses define how internet routers behave and allow you to regulate how devices communicate over the Internet.\n\nAn internet protocol address (IP address) is a numerical representation of a network interface that serves as its sole means of identification such as 123.89.46.72.\n\nThere are four components to an IP address:\n\nfirst octet - the IP's first digit (123)\n\nsecond octet - the IP's second number (89)\n\nthird octet, or the third IP digit (46)\n\nThe fourth and last number of the IP is the fourth octet (72)\n\nThe Internet Protocol version 4 sample above (123.89.46.72) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IPv4).\n\nThere is still another Internet protocol variant as well. The most recent Internet Protocol version is IPv6, which was released in 2007.\n\nThe two IP versions that are now in use are IPv4 and IPv6. The original IPv4 protocol is still in use today on the internet and in many corporate networks. On the other hand, the IPv4 protocol was limited to 2^32 addresses. Due to the way addresses were assigned, there would be a situation where there wouldn't be enough unique addresses for all internet-connected devices.\n\nThe most recent version is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). To accommodate the demand for more Internet addresses, this new IP address version is being used. It was developed to overcome IPv4 issues. With a 128-bit address space, it supports 340 billion distinct address spaces. IPng (Internet Protocol next generation) is another name for IPv6.\n\nAn IP address is used to manage the connection between gadgets that send and receive data over a network. Without an IP address, it is impossible to communicate with any device connected to the internet. IP addresses allow computing devices (such PCs and tablets) to communicate with websites and streaming services, as well as information websites of the identity of the connecting user.\n\nIP addresses are just as significant as a person's identification number or card. It guarantees protection for your advantages and fosters your innovation in the subject or fields that interest you as a user. An independent IP address is crucial for any website, whether it be a company website, a blog, or even a website that aims to educate college students by offering relevant content. One can only envision the emergence of additional channels of an ever-growing network, and to administer these networks to every last user, we all need IP addresses, as technology is altering quicker than human DNA itself.\n\nTherefore, IP addresses are just as crucial as your house keys, without which it would be very impossible to access your network, or, to put it another way, just as crucial as a dot on a Google map that represents your property. However, keep in mind that employing it wisely will bring you great fortune and status, depending on your efforts and originality.\n\nIt's possible that you're behind a NAT firewall if you utilize a wireless router to connect to the internet. A NAT firewall enables several devices on the same network to share the same public IP address while maintaining separate private IP addresses. NAT transfers requests and data from the private IP addresses of individual devices to their online destination using the router's public IP address. These conserve address space (the number of accessible IP addresses) and eliminate unwanted contact with possibly harmful computers on the internet.\n\nYour public IP address is not concealed by a NAT firewall, but your private IP address is. All devices connected to a router with NAT enabled will share the same public IP address. The NAT firewall will block all internet communications that are not in response to a request issued from a private IP address. Because they lack a private IP address to which they can be sent, all other requests and data packets are deleted.\n\nThe function that MAC addresses and IP addresses both perform is to designate a specific device within a network. The MAC address designates the physical location of a device within a local network, whereas the IP address signifies the device's global or internet-accessible identity. The manufacturer of the NIC card provides the MAC Address, whereas the Internet Service Provider supplies the IP Address.\n\nThe primary distinction between MAC and IP addresses is that MAC addresses are used to verify the computer's physical address. It uniquely identifies the network's devices. While IP addresses are used to uniquely identify a device's network connection, they do not indicate whether a device is connected to a network.\n\nLet's examine the distinction between MAC and IP addresses:\n\nMAC addresses are used to identify a node's unique address, whereas IP addresses are primarily used to identify a node's connectivity to a network.\n\nThe MAC address is a hardware-based, burnt-in, or physical address, whereas the IP address is a software-based or logical address.\n\nThe network administrator, DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), or the ISP supplies the IP address (Internet Service Provider). The MAC address, on the other hand, is given by the device's manufacturer and is integrated into the NIC (Network Interface Card).\n\nIPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, and IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long. The MAC address, on the other hand, is a 48-bit address. Additionally, the MAC address is expressed in the hexadecimal format with dots(.) or hyphens(-) or colons(:) in between, whereas the IP address is represented in the binary format with only dots(.) in between.\n\nWhen addressing a connection, IP addresses use a variety of network classes, including A, B, C, D, and E. On the other hand, no such network classes are employed when addressing a particular device's MAC address.\n\nThe technique of subnetting involves splitting a large network into two or smaller networks. The MAC address does not use subnetting, but the IP address does.\n\nAn IP address changes anytime a device connects to a different network, making it a flexible address. The MAC addresses, on the other hand, are rigid and never change for a device.\n\nThe MAC address can be used for broadcasting, but the IP address can be used for multicasting or broadcasting.\n\nThe network layer of the OSI or TCP/IP paradigm is where the IP address or logical addressing is implemented. On the other hand, the OSI or TCP/IP reference model's Data-Link layer is where the MAC address, also known as physical addressing, is implemented.\n\nThe differences between MAC Address and IP Address are summarized in the following table:\n\nMAC AddressIP AddressMedia Access Control Address is abbreviated as MAC AddressThe abbreviation IP refers to the Internet Protocol AddressMAC Address is a hexadecimal address consisting of six bytesThe IP address consists of sixteen bytes (IPv6) or four bytes (IPv4)A device with a MAC address is capable of retrieval via the ARP protocolThe RARP protocol enables a device with an IP address to retrieve informationA MAC address is oriented toward hardwareIP address is oriented toward softwareThe MAC Address verifies the computer's physical addressThe IP address of a computer represents its logical locationThe Manufacturer of the NIC Card supplies the MAC AddressA provider of Internet service supplies the IP addressThe MAC address facilitates device identificationThe IP address serves to identify the device's network connectionMAC Address functions at the stratum of the data transmissionThe IP address is a network layer protocolThe spreading of MAC addresses is prohibitedAn IP address may be shared by multiple client devicesBroadcasting can be accomplished using MAC addressesThe IP address is capable of supporting both multicasting and broadcastingMAC addresses assist in resolving IP address concernsMAC address problems can never be resolved with IP addressesA computer's MAC address is immutable with respect to time and environmentThe IP address is subject to change based on the time and environmentThe address is composed of six groups of two hexadecimal numerals, each of which is separated by a colon or hyphen (-). It is a 48-bit value. As an example: The sequence 00:FF:FF:AB:BB :AA or 00-FF-FF-AB-BB-AAIPv6 employs 128-bit addresses denoted in hexadecimal notation, while IPv4 employs 32-bit addresses encoded in dotted notation.As an example: IPv4: 192.168.1.1 IPv6: FFFF:F200:3204:0B00The utilization of classes is absent in MAC addressingIP addressing in IPv4 is based on the classes A, B, C, D, and EMAC addresses are not readily discoverable by unauthorized partiesIP addresses are susceptible to discovery by a third partyFor data forwarding during communication, the switch requires the MAC addressFor data forwarding during communication, a router requires an IP address"
