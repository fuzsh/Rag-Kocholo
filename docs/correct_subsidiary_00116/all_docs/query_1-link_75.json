What is the one major difference between local AAA authentication and using the login local command when configuring device access authentication?\n\nThe login local command requires the administrator to manually configure the usernames and passwords, but local AAA authentication does not.\n\nLocal AAA authentication allows more than one user account to be configured, but login local does not.\n\nLocal AAA authentication provides a way to configure backup methods of authentication, but login local does not.\n\nThe login local command uses local usernames and passwords stored on the router, but local AAA authentication does not.\n\n11.
