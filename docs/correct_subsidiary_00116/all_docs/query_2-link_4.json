You do need to be careful with this as if your set a higher stratum number (e.g. ntp master 2) and your configured NTP server is a lower stratum your routers internal clock will take precedence and can cause significant drift.\n\nI normally would configure mutiple upstream ntp servers on the ISR and not use the ntp master command in a single site/type of scenario.\n\nIn a larger scenario, I have used multiple ISRs as ntp peers with each other and GPS (Stratum 0) as the reference source for them. In the event of a GPS failure, the peering kept the time for drifting as much until our GPS came back.\n\nTo service clients the ISRs had a loopback interface with a dedicated /32 which we anycasted throughout our network, so in the event of a device or link failure, clients would be automatically rerouted to the next closest ISR acting as an NTP server. This may be appropriate for your scenario, particularly if you have multiple DCs which need to be in sync.\n\nI've never really seen any stats on amount of clients supported on current hardware, but like any feature you turn on, it is best to monitor the impact on resources for your environment (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/availability/high-availability/19643-ntpm.html), but in practice I found it can scale to 5K+ clients without seeing any significant CPU load on our routers, time drift or synchronization issues on the client side."
