CTC allows you to provision and manage the ONS 15454 using Netscape Navigator or Microsoft® Internet Explorer. You can also use TL1 commands to communicate with the ONS 15454 through VT100 terminals, VT100 emulation software, or you can Telnet to the node using TL1 port 2361.\n\nTo use CTC, your computer needs a web browser and appropriate versions of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java plug-ins. Netscape Communicator and required Java files are provided on the Cisco ONS 15454 software CD. You can install Netscape and the Java files using procedures in the following sections.\n\nEach time you connect to an ONS 15454, a CTC launcher is downloaded from the ONS 15454 TCC card to your computer. The launcher verifies that the computer has a CTC version that matches the version on the TCC. If the computer does not have CTC, or if the version on the TCC is a later release, the launcher downloads the CTC application to the temporary directory designated by your computer's operating system. (For a detailed description of the TCC card, see the \"Timing Communication and Control (TCC/TCC+) Card\" section on page 2-7.)\n\n3.2 Preparing PCs to Run CTC\n\nThe following minimum requirements are needed to run CTC from personal computers:\n\n• 486 processor\n\n• 128 megabytes of RAM\n\n• LAN connection (to access the ONS 15454 through a LAN)\n\n• Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT (Windows NT is recommended)\n\n• Any one of the following:\n\n• Netscape Navigator 4.08 or higher\n\n• Netscape Communicator 4.61 or higher, or\n\n• Internet Explorer 4.0 (service pack 2) or higher\n\nNetscape Communicator is included on the Cisco ONS 15454 software CD. Internet Explorer 5.0 is included with Windows 98 second edition.\n\n• Java Runtime Environment 1.2.2 with Java 1.2 plug-in (included on CTC software CD)\n\n• User-supplied category 5 cable with RJ-45 connectors on each end\n\nNote Your mouse pointer scheme should be set to Windows Standard (Windows 95/98) or None (Windows NT). To check the settings, choose Settings>Control Panel from the Windows Start menu. Double-click the Mouse option. From the Pointers tab of the Mouse Properties dialog, select the Windows Standard (or \"none\" for NT) mouse scheme. Click OK.\n\nProcedure: Install Netscape Communicator (Windows)\n\nIf a web browser is not installed, install Netscape Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer using procedures provided by those vendors. Netscape Communicator is provided on the Cisco ONS 15454 software CD. To install it:\n\nStep 1 Insert the Cisco ONS 15454 software CD into your PC's CD drive.\n\nStep 2 In the Windows/Netscape directory, double click n32e461.exe and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nProcedure: Install the Java Files (Windows)\n\nStep 1 Insert the ONS 15454 software CD into your PC's CD drive.\n\nStep 2 In the Windows/Jre1.2.2 folder, double click jre1_2_2-win.exe and follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nStep 3 In the Windows folder, double click JavaPolicyInstall.bat.\n\nA message displays on the DOS screen stating the installation was successful.\n\nStep 4 Enable the JRE 1.2 plug-in:\n\n(a) From the Windows Start menu, select Programs>Java Plug-in Control Panel.\n\n(b) On the Java Plug-in Properties dialog, click the Advanced tab.\n\n(c) Under Java Run Time Environment, choose JRE 1.2.\n\n(d) Click Apply. Close the Java Plug-in Properties dialog.\n\n3.3 Preparing Solaris Workstations to Run CTC\n\nTo install CTC Release 2.2.0 software on Solaris workstations, the workstation must have Solaris 2.6 or 2.7 installed, with a minimum 128 megabytes of RAM. Use the following procedures to install Netscape and the appropriate Java files on the Solaris workstation.\n\nNote Solaris installation instructions use \"CD/\" instead of an actual CD-ROM path. Remember to substitute the path to your CD-ROM drive.\n\nProcedure: Install qzip\n\nTo install Netscape, you need qzip. If q zip is not installed:\n\nStep 1 Insert the Cisco Transport Controller Release 2.2.0 CD into your CD-ROM drive. If the directory of the CD does not open automatically, open it.\n\nStep 2 Extract the files from the CD/Solaris/files.tar archive to a temporary directory on your hard drive by typing:\n\ncd /var/tmp\n\ntar xvf /CD/solaris/files.tar\n\nStep 3 Copy qzip from the /var/tmp/Solaris/Netscape to /usr/local/bin (you may need to create /usr/local/bin and add it to your path). Type:\n\nmkdir -p /usr/local/bin\n\ncp /var/tmp/Solaris/Netscape/qzip /usr/local/bin\n\nStep 4 Add /usr/local/bin and /opt/NSCPcom to your search path by typing:\n\ncsh: % set path = ( /usr/local/bin /opt/NSCPcom $path )\n\nsh or ksh: # PATH=/usr/local/bin:/opt/NSCPcom:$PATH\n\n# export PATH\n\nStep 5 Set the environment variable in the startup files in each user's home directory: .cshrc for csh and .profile for sh or ksh.\n\nProcedure: Install Netscape Navigator (Solaris)\n\nIf Netscape Navigator 4.08 or Netscape Communicator 4.61 or later is not installed on the workstation, install it from the CTC Release 2.2.0 CD:\n\nStep 1 Insert the Cisco Transport Controller Release 2.2.0 CD into your CD-ROM drive. If the directory of the CD does not open automatically, open it.\n\nStep 2 Extract the files from the CD/Solaris/files.tar archive (if not extracted in a previous procedure) to a temporary directory on your hard drive by typing:\n\ncd /var/tmp\n\ntar xvf /CD/solaris/files.tar\n\nStep 3 Go to /var/tmp/Solaris/Netscape and type:\n\ntar xvf navigator-v408-export.sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1.tar\n\nStep 4 Follow the instructions in: /var/tmp/Solaris/Netscape/navigator-v408.sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1/README.install.\n\nWhen prompted for the Netscape Communicator software location, type:\n\n/opt/NSCPcom\n\nNetscape Communicator is installed in [/opt/netscape]: /opt/NSCPcom.\n\nProcedure: Install the Java Files (Solaris)\n\nIf JRE 1.2.2.2_05 with Java 1.2 plug-in is not installed on the workstation, complete Steps 1-8 to install it from the CTC Release 2.2.0 CD. If JRE 1.2.2.2_05 with 1.2 plug-in is installed, skip to\n\nStep 9.\n\nStep 1 Insert the Cisco Transport Controller Release 2.2.0 CD into your CD-ROM drive. If the directory of the CD does not open automatically, open it.\n\nStep 2 Extract the files from the CD/Solaris/files.tar archive (if not extracted in a previous procedure) to a temporary directory on your hard drive by typing:\n\ncd /var/tmp\n\ntar xvf /CD/solaris/files.tar\n\nStep 3 Go to the /var/tmp/Solaris/Jre1.2.1_05/ directory and unpack the appropriate tar archive:\n\n• For Solaris 2.6, unpack the *.6.tar archive\n\n• For Solaris 2.7, unpack the *.7.tar archive\n\nStep 4 Un-compress each patch file by typing:\n\ncd /var/tmp/Solaris/Jre1.2.1_05\n\ntar -xvf 1.2.1_03_patches_sparc_5.6.tar # or ...5.7.tar\n\ncd 5.6 or 5.7\n\nuncompress *\n\nStep 5 For each un-compressed tar file, unpack the archive, enter the directory, and follow the instructions, for example:\n\ntar xvf 105181-11.tar\n\nStep 6 Remove the intermediate tar files, for example:\n\nrm *.tar\n\nStep 7 Add each patch using /usr/sbin/patchadd, for example:\n\n/usr/sbin/patchadd 105181-11\n\nNote Refer to http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2.1/install-solaris-patches.html for more information on installing Solaris patches.\n\nStep 8 Install the Java 1.2 plug-in using /usr/sbin/pkgadd, for example,\n\ncd /var/tmp/Solaris/Jre1.2.1_03\n\ntar xvf plugin-12-sparc.tar\n\npkgadd -d . SUNWj2pi\n\nThis installs javaplugin.so into /opt/NSCPcom/plugins. If Netscape was installed under /opt/NSCPcom, the plug-in is installed in the Netscape directory. If so, copy javaplugin.so to <Netscape-directory>/plugins. For more information about installing the JRE, see:\n\nhttp://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/runtime_solaris.html\n\nStep 9 Modify java.policy to allow the CTC launcher to write to the workstation's hard drive:\n\n(a) Exit Netscape if a Netscape session is running.\n\n(b) Modify java.policy:\n\n– To enable the applet for all users, copy the lines from: /CD/Cerent/LAUNCHER.policy to /opt/NSCPcom/j2pi/lib/security/java.policy.\n\nOtherwise:\n\n– If your home directory has a .java.policy file, copy the lines from /CD/Cerent/LAUNCHER.policy to that file.\n\n– If your home directory does not have a .java.policy file, copy the /CD/Cerent/LAUNCHER.policy file to your home directory and rename it .java.policy.\n\nNote The per-user .java.policy has a leading period (.) while the system-wide file does not.\n\nStep 10 Use Netscape to launch and run CTC. (Before launching Netscape, make sure to put /opt/NSCPcom/j2pi/bin in your path.)\n\nStep 11 Clean up the temporary files by typing:\n\ncd /var/tmp\n\nrm -fr Solaris\n\nStep 12 Type eject cdrom to remove the CTC CD from your CD-ROM drive.\n\n3.4 Connecting PCs to the ONS 15454\n\nYou can connect a PC to the ONS 15454 using the RJ-45 LAN port on the TCC or the LAN 1 pins on the ONS 15454 backplane. For initial setup, use the front panel RJ-45 port. For long-term connections, Cisco recommends using the LAN pins to keep the front panel area uncluttered. For a list of LAN pin assignments, see Table 1-2 on page 1-31.\n\nEach ONS 15454 must have a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address that you use to access the ONS 15454. The address is displayed on the front panel's liquid crystal display (LCD) at turn-up. The initial IP address, 192.1.0.2, is a generic default address for ONS 15454 access and configuration.\n\nEach computer used to communicate with the ONS 15454 should have only one IP address.\n\nNote Do not use dual Network Interface Cards or an enabled NIC card and dial-up adapter at the same time; this hampers communication between the CTC and ONS 15454s.\n\n3.4.1 Direct Connections\n\nUse the following procedures to connect a PC running Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT directly to an ONS 15454.\n\nProcedure: Setup a PC for Direct Connection\n\nStep 1 From the Windows Start menu, choose Settings>Control Panel.\n\nStep 2 On the Control Panel dialog, click the Network icon.\n\nStep 3 On the Network dialog, shown in Figure 3-1, select the following:\n\n• Windows 95/98: select TCP/IP for your PC Ethernet card, then click Properties.\n\n• Windows NT: choose the Protocols tab, select TCP/IP Protocol, and click Properties.\n\nFigure 3-1 Network Dialog\n\nStep 4 (Windows 95/98 only) On the TCP/IP Properties dialog:\n\n(a) Click the DNS Configuration tab and select Disable DNS.\n\n(b) Click the WINS Configuration tab and select Disable WINS Resolution.\n\nStep 5 Click the IP Address tab to open the IP Address window ( Figure 3-2).\n\nFigure 3-2 IP Address Window\n\nStep 6 Click Specify an IP address.\n\nStep 7 In the IP Address field, enter an IP address identical to the ONS 15454 (the ONS 15454 IP address is shown on the front LCD panel) except for the last three digits. The last three digits must be between 1 and 254. This places the PC on the same subnet as the ONS 15454.\n\nStep 8 Type 255.255.255.0 in Subnet Mask.\n\nStep 9 Click OK.\n\nStep 10 (Windows 95/98) Click the Gateway tab ( ).\n\nFigure 3-3 TCP/IP Properties - Gateway Tab (Windows 95/98)\n\nStep 11 This step defines the ONS 15454 as the default gateway for the PC. In New Gateway (Windows 95/98) or Default Gateway (Windows NT), type the ONS 15454 IP address. For initial setup, this is the default address that ships with the ONS 15454 (192.1.0.2).\n\nStep 12 Click Apply (Windows NT) or Add (Windows 95/98). For Windows 95/98, verify that the IP address displays in the Installed Gateways field.\n\nStep 13 If your PC runs on Windows 95/98, you will be prompted to restart your PC. Click Yes. If your PC runs on Windows NT, you do not need to restart your computer.\n\nStep 14 Test the connection:\n\n(a) Start Netscape Navigator or Windows Explorer.\n\n(b) Enter the ONS 15454 IP address in the Web address (URL) field. Within 30 seconds, the CTC login screen displays. If it does not appear, continue with Steps c and d.\n\n(c) From the Windows Start menu, choose MS-DOS prompt.\n\n(d) At the DOS prompt, type ping [ONS 15454 IP address], for example, ping 192.1.0.2. If your computer is connected to the ONS 15454, a reply from [IP address] message displays.\n\nIf your PC is not connected, a Request timed out message displays. If this occurs, check that the cables connecting the PC to the ONS 15454 are securely attached. Check the Link Status LED on the PC NIC card. Repeat Steps 1-14, verifying IP and submask information.\n\n3.4.2 Local Area Network Connections\n\nTo access the ONS 15454 from a local area network (LAN):\n\n• The ONS 15454 IP address must be changed to a LAN-compatible IP address.\n\n• The ONS 15454 must be physically connected to the LAN (typically using cross-over cable to a router, hub, or switch).\n\n• If the PC Network settings were changed for direct access to the ONS 15454, change the settings back to LAN access. Usually this means setting the IP Address on the TCP/IP dialog back to \"Obtain an IP address automatically.\" If your LAN requires that DNS or WINS is enabled, change the setting on the DNS Configuration or WINS Configuration tab of the TCP/IP dialog.\n\n• If your computer is connected to a proxy server, disable proxy service or add the ONS 15454 nodes as exceptions.\n\nIf these conditions have been met, to access the ONS 15454, start your web browser and type the ONS 15454 IP address in the URL field.\n\nProcedure: Disable Proxy Service: Windows with Internet Explorer\n\nStep 1 From the Start menu, select Settings>Control Panel.\n\nStep 2 In the Control Panel window, select Internet Options.\n\nStep 3 From the Internet Properties dialog, select the Connections tab and click LAN Settings.\n\nStep 4 On the Local Area Network (LAN) Settings dialog do one of the following:\n\n• Deselect \"Use a proxy server\" to disable the service, or\n\n• Leave \"User a proxy server\" selected and click Advanced. On the Proxy Setting dialog under Exceptions, enter the IP addresses of ONS 15454 nodes that you will access. Separate each address with a semi colon. You can insert an asterisk for the host number to include all the ONS 15454s on your network. Click OK to close each open dialog.\n\nProcedure: Disable Proxy Service: Windows with Netscape\n\nStep 1 Open Netscape.\n\nStep 2 From the Edit menu, select Preferences.\n\nStep 3 In the Preferences dialog under Category, select Advanced>Proxies.\n\nStep 4 On the right side of the Preferences dialog under Proxies, do one of the following:\n\n• Select \"Direct connection to the Internet,\" to bypass the proxy server, or\n\n• Select \"Manual proxy configuration\" to add exceptions to the proxy server, then click View. On the Manual Proxy Configuration dialog under Exceptions, enter the IP addresses of ONS 15454 nodes that you will access. Separate each address with a comma. Click OK to close each open dialog.\n\n3.4.3 Remote Access to the ONS 15454\n\nYou can remotely access an ONS 15454 node using a LAN modem. The LAN modem must be connected to the RJ-45 port on a TCC card or to the LAN pins on the ONS 15454 backplane. The LAN modem must be properly configured for use with the ONS 15454. When the modem is installed, dial-up access to the ONS 15454 is available using a personal computer modem.\n\n3.4.4 Connecting to the ONS 15454 with TL1 Terminals\n\nAlthough the ONS 15454 is designed to be used with CTC, you can communicate with the ONS 15454 using TL1 commands or Telnet to port 2361. To connect a TL1 terminal (or a PC running terminal emulation software) to the ONS 15454, use the DB-9 plug on the front panel of the TCC or the CRAFT pins on the backplane. For a list of CRAFT pin assignments, see Table 1-3 on page 1-31. For information about TL1 commands that can be used with the ONS 15454, see Chapter 11, \"TL1 Reference.\"\n\n3.5 Logging into the ONS 15454\n\nAfter you set up the physical connections between the PC and ONS 15454 and change your PC network settings, you can log into the CTC and begin setting up the ONS 15454 node.\n\nProcedure: Log into the ONS 15454\n\nStep 1 From the PC connected to the ONS 15454, start Netscape or Windows Explorer.\n\nStep 2 In the Netscape or Internet Explorer Web address (URL) field, type the ONS 15454 IP address. For initial setup, this is the default address, 192.1.0.2.\n\nWhen the PC connects to the ONS 15454, the login window displays ( Figure 3-4).\n\nFigure 3-4 Login Screen\n\nStep 3 Type a valid user name and password. For initial setup, type the user name \"CISCO15\" and click Login (no password is required).\n\nNote CISCO15 is the default user name provided with every ONS 15454. This user name has Superuser rights and privileges so you can set up other ONS 15454 users. The CISCO15 user is delivered without a password. To assign a password, click the Provisioning>Security tabs and change the Superuser password. In addition to CISCO15 user, a \"cerent454\" user is provided for compatibility with previous CTC releases. For more information about ONS 15454 security, see the \"Setting Up ONS 15454 Security\" section.\n\nAfter logging in, the CTC node view ( Figure 3-5) appears. From here, you can navigate to other CTC views to perform the ONS 15454 operations, administration, maintenance, and provisioning tasks described in the following sections.\n\nNote The term \"node\" refers to a single ONS 15454. See the glossary for a detailed\n\ndefinition.\n\n3.6 CTC Views\n\nThe CTC window includes a menu bar and a top and bottom pane. CTC provides three ONS 15454 views:\n\n• Network view—displays information about the ONS 15454 network. You perform ONS 15454 network management tasks in this view.\n\n• Node view—displays information about one ONS 15454 node. You perform node management tasks in this view.\n\n• Card view—displays information about individual ONS 15454 cards. You perform card management tasks in this view.\n\nA graphic of the current view appears in the upper right portion of the CTC window. The node view displays the ONS 15454 shelf. The network view displays a background map with ONS 15454 nodes represented by colored squares. The card view displays a graphic of the selected card.\n\nA thumbnail of the parent view is displayed in the upper left corner of the CTC window. Parent view is the level above the current view. For example, network view is the parent of node view, and node view is the parent of card view. Below the thumbnail, status information for the current view is shown. In node view, the Node name; IP address; session boot date and time; a summary of critical (CR), major (MJ), and minor (MN) alarms; the name of the user who is logged in; and the user's security level are shown. In network view, the status of the selected node or span is shown.\n\nThe middle of the CTC window provides tabs to access CTC functions. Some CTC tabs have subtabs, which are used to access subfunctions. The tabs that are displayed depend on the view. In node view, six tabs are displayed: Alarms, History, Circuits, Provisioning, Inventory, and Maintenance. In network view, only the Alarms, History, and Circuits tabs are displayed. CTC window elements are shown in .\n\nFigure 3-5 CTC Window Elements\n\n3.6.1 Node View\n\nThe CTC node view ( ) is displayed each time you log into CTC. Node view shows a real-time depiction of the ONS 15454 shelf. The colors of the cards, shown in , indicate the status of the physical card and slot.\n\nNode view provides six tabs to access node information and perform node maintenance and provisioning tasks. Some tabs have subtabs. shows the CTC Node view with the Provisioning subtabs displayed. Node view tabs and subtabs are shown in .\n\n3.6.2 Network View\n\nNetwork view ( Figure 3-6) displays information about the ONS 15454 network. You perform network provisioning and management tasks in this view. A United States map is displayed and the ONS 15454 nodes are represented by colored squares. The color of the square indicates the status of the node. shows the colors and their corresponding status.\n\nFigure 3-6 Network View\n\nThe network view tabs display network alarms and alarm history and allow you to set up and edit network circuits. In addition, you can click spans (the lines connecting the nodes) and node icons on the network map to quickly view circuit properties, provision circuits, and perform protection switches. shows the actions that you can perform in network view.\n\n3.6.3 Card View\n\nCard view displays information about individual ONS 15454 cards. ( shows an OC3 IR 4 1310 in card view.) You perform card-specific maintenance and provisioning tasks in card view. The information that is displayed and the tasks you can perform depend on the card. CTC displays a card view for all ONS 15454 cards except the TCC, XC, and XCVT cards.\n\nCard view provides access to six tabs: Alarms, History, Circuits, Provisioning, Maintenance, and Performance. (The Performance tab is not displayed for the AIC card.) However, the subtabs, fields, and information displayed under each tab depend on the card type selected.\n\nFigure 3-7 Card View\n\n3.7 CTC Navigation\n\nYou can use different methods to navigate to views within the CTC window. You can select views from the Go To menu. You can also double click or right click objects in the window. Moving the mouse over nodes, cards, and card ports displays popup information about the node, card, or port. shows an example.\n\nFigure 3-8 CTC Popup Information\n\nDifferent methods for navigating within the CTC window are shown in .\n\n3.8 Viewing CTC Table Data\n\nMuch of the ONS 15454 data that CTC displays, such as alarms, alarm history, circuits, and node inventory, is displayed in tables. You can change the way the CTC tables are displayed. For example, you can:\n\n• Rearrange or hide table columns.\n\n• Sort tables by primary and secondary keys in descending or ascending order. (Sorting and hiding is available for all read-only tables except Inventory.)\n\n• Export CTC table data to spreadsheets and database management programs to perform additional data manipulation. For exporting procedures, see the \"Printing and Exporting CTC Data\" section.\n\nTo change CTC table display, left-click or right-click a table column header. Right clicking a column header displays a shortcut menu, shown in , with table column display options.\n\nFigure 3-9 Table Column Shortcut Menu\n\nlists the options that you can use to customize information display in CTC tables.\n\n3.9 Viewing ONS 15454 Alarms\n\nSelect the Alarms tab ( ) to display current and cleared alarms generated on the node. shows the information that is displayed for each ONS 15454 alarm.\n\nFigure 3-10 Alarms Tab\n\nAlarms are displayed in one of five background colors, listed in , to quickly communicate the alarm severity. For information about troubleshooting alarms, see Chapter 9, \"CTC Alarms.\"\n\n3.9.1 Controlling Alarm Display\n\nYou can control the display of alarms on the Alarms tab. shows the actions you can perform from the Alarms tab.\n\n3.9.2 Viewing Alarm History\n\nThe History tab displays historical alarm data. The History tab also shows the events (that is, non-reported activities) that occur in addition to the alarms. For example, protection switching events or performance monitoring threshold crossings appear here. The History tab presents two alarm history views:\n\n• The Session subtab ( Figure 3-11) presents alarms and events for the current CTC session. (Events are non-reported activities, such as timing changes and threshold crossings.) When you log off, the alarms disappear.\n\n• The Node subtab ( ) shows the alarms and events that occurred at the node since the CTC software installation. The ONS 15454 can store up to 256 critical alarms, 256 major alarms, 256 minor alarms, and 256 events. When the limit is reached, the ONS 15454 discards the oldest alarms and events.\n\nTip Double click an alarm in the alarm table to display the corresponding view. For example, double-clicking a card alarm takes you to card view. In network view, double-clicking a node alarm takes you to node view.\n\nFigure 3-11 History>Session Subtab\n\nFigure 3-12 History>Node Subtab\n\n3.9.3 Setting Up General Node Information\n\nThe first ONS 15454 provisioning task you will perform is setting up basic node information. If the node is to be connected to a LAN or other ONS 15454s, the information that you enter for the node, such as node name and IP address, must be coordinated with your network administrator.\n\nProcedure: Set Up General Node Information\n\nStep 1 Log into the ONS 15454 node.\n\nStep 2 From node view, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 3 In the General subtab, type the following:\n\n• Node Name—type a name for the node.\n\n• Contact—type the contact person's name for the node contact and the phone number (optional).\n\n• Location—type the node's location (optional).\n\n• Latitude—type the node's latitude in the format Nddmmssfff, where d=degrees, m=minutes, s=seconds, and f=fractional seconds.\n\n• Longitude—type the node's longitude in the format Wdddmmssfff, where d=degrees, m=minutes, s=seconds, and f=fractional seconds.\n\nCTC uses the latitude and longitude to place node icons on the network view map. To convert longitudes and latitudes given in degrees to degrees, minutes, and seconds, see the \"Convert Coordinates to Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds\" section.\n\n• Use SNTP Server—when checked, CTC uses a Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) server to set the date and time of the node. Using an SNTP server ensures that all ONS 15454 network nodes use the same date and time reference. The server synchronizes the node's time during power outages or software upgrades. If you check Use SNTP Server, type the server's IP address in the next field. If you do not use an SNTP server, complete the Date, Time and Time Zone fields. The ONS 15454 will use these fields for alarm dates and times.\n\n• Date—type the current date.\n\n• Time—type the current time.\n\n• Time Zone—type the time zone.\n\nStep 4 Click Apply.\n\nCTC uses the longitude and latitude you enter on the General subtab to place node icons on the network view map. You can obtain the longitude and latitude for cities and Zip Codes from the US Census Bureau U.S. Gazetteer website (www.census.gov/cgi-bin/gazetteer). Coordinates are generally provided in degrees. CTC requires that you enter coordinates in degrees, minutes, and seconds. Use the following procedure to convert coordinates.\n\nProcedure: Convert Coordinates to Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds\n\nStep 1 Find the location's longitude and latitude. For example, Petaluma, California is 38.250739 N, 122.615536 W.\n\nStep 2 Use the appropriate directional letter plus the first two digits of latitude and first three digits of longitude with no conversion. For Petaluma, this is N38 (latitude) and W122 (longitude).\n\nStep 3 Using the unconverted longitude and latitude, multiply the number after the decimal by 60 to convert it to minutes. For example, .250739 x 60 is 15.0443, and .615536 x 60 is 36.93216. Use the whole numbers for the minutes (in the example, 15 and 36).\n\nStep 4 Multiply the number after the decimal from Step 3 by 60 to convert it to seconds. In the example, .0443 x 60 is 2.6580, and .93216 x 60 is 55.9296. Use the whole numbers of the total (in the example, 02 and 55) for the seconds. If the whole number for either minutes or seconds is less than ten, add a zero to the left of the number, for example 2 is entered as 02.\n\nStep 5 Use zeros for fractional seconds, because the values are not significant for node positioning on the CTC network view map.\n\nStep 6 Convert the latitude, originally given in degrees, to the format Nddmmssfff, where d=degrees, m=minutes, s=seconds, and f=fractional seconds. In this example, 38.257039 N = N381502000.\n\nStep 7 Convert the longitude, originally given in degrees, to the format Wdddmmssfff. In the example, 122.615536 = W1223655000. Enter zeros if degrees are less than 100, for example, 98 degrees is entered 098.\n\n3.9.4 Setting Up ONS 15454 Network Information\n\nBefore you connect an ONS 15454 to other ONS 15454s or to a LAN, you must change the default IP address that is shipped with the ONS 15454 (192.1.0.2). IP addresses are unique identifiers for nodes or hosts connected to a network using TCP/IP. Each address consists of a network number and a host number. The network numbers are used for routing, while the host number is used to address an individual host within the network or subnetwork. A subnet mask is used to extract network and host information from the IP address.\n\nIP addresses are 32-bit binary numbers. However, to make IP addresses easier to work with, they are represented as four decimal values, each representing eight bits in the range 0 to 255 (known as octets) separated by decimal points. For example, the following IP address is in binary format:\n\n10001100.10110011.11011100.11001000\n\nThe same address, represented as four decimal values, is:\n\n140.179.220.200\n\nBecause the IP addresses that you work with represent binary addresses, changing an address is not always straightforward. Therefore, before you change the ONS 15454 IP addresses, consult your LAN administrator or someone knowledgeable in TCP/IP to ensure addresses are suitable to your network. Additional information about ONS 15454 network management and Ethernet applications is provided in Chapters 7 and 8.\n\nUse the following procedure to set up networking information for the ONS 15454. If the ONS 15454 or the computer used to access the ONS 15454 is linked to a network router, you should create a static route, which can be provisioned using the Static Route fields.\n\nProcedure: Set Up Network Information\n\nStep 1 From the CTC node view, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Network subtab ( ) and complete the following:\n\n• IP Address—type the node IP address.\n\n• Prevent LCD IP Config—if checked, prevents the ONS 15454 IP address from being changed using the LCD. See the \"IP Address Entry Using Front Panel LCD\" section on page 8-10.\n\n• Default Router—if the ONS 15454 must communicate with a device that has an IP address that the ONS 15454 is not routed to, it forwards the packets to the default router. Type the address of the router in this field. If the ONS 15454 is not connected to a LAN, leave this field blank.\n\n• Subnet Mask Length—type the subnet mask length (decimal number representing the subnet mask length in bits), or click the arrows, to adjust the subnet mask length.\n\n• MAC Address (read only)—displays the ONS 15454 address as it is identified on the Media Access Control layer.\n\n• Static Routes—static routes permit multiple CTC sessions with different destination IP addresses on the same subnet. For static route provisioning procedures, see the \"Static Route Provisioning\" section on page 8-30.\n\nFigure 3-13 Provisioning>Network Subtab\n\nStep 3 Click Apply.\n\nStep 4 Click Yes on the confirmation dialog.\n\nThe TCCs will reboot, one at a time.\n\n3.9.5 Setting Up ONS 15454 Security\n\nThe ONS 15454 has four security levels that limit the functions users can perform: Retrieve, Maintenance, Provisioning, and Superuser. A Retrieve user can retrieve and view CTC information but cannot set or modify parameters. A Maintenance user can access only Maintenance options. A Provisioning user can access only Provisioning and Maintenance options. A Superuser, usually the network element administrator, can perform all of the functions of the other security levels as well as set names, passwords, and security levels for other users. A list of CTC actions that can be performed at each security level is shown in .\n\nNote In order for users to access multiple nodes, the same user name and password must exist on each node.\n\nSecurity levels also limit the amount of time a user can leave the system idle before the CTC window is locked to prevent unauthorized users from making changes. Higher security levels have shorter idle times. shows CTC security levels and their idle times.\n\nProcedure: Create New Users\n\nStep 1 From the CTC window, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Security subtab.\n\nStep 3 On the Security pane, click Create.\n\nStep 4 In the Create User dialog ( ), enter the following:\n\n• Name— type the user name.\n\n• Password—type the user password. The password must contain at least six characters and can be any letter or number (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).\n\n• Confirm Password—type the password again to confirm it.\n\n• Security Level—select the user's security level.\n\nFigure 3-14 Create User Dialog\n\nStep 5 Click OK.\n\nNote CTC users must be added to each node where they need access. Users are not automatically added to other network nodes.\n\nProcedure: Edit User Security\n\nStep 1 From the CTC window, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Security subtab.\n\nStep 3 On the Security pane, click the user you want to edit.\n\nStep 4 On the right portion of the Security pane, enter new security information for the user: name, password, password confirmation, and/or security level. (A Superuser does not need to enter an old password. Other users must enter their old password when changing their own password.)\n\nStep 5 Click Apply.\n\nNote Changing user permissions and access levels does not take effect while the user is logged into CTC. The changes take effect the next time the user logs into CTC. If the user has access to more than one node, you must change the user settings at each node.\n\n3.9.6 Creating Protection Groups\n\nThe ONS 15454 provides several card protection methods. When you set up protection for ONS 15454 cards, you must choose between maximum protection and maximum card slot availability. The highest protection reduces the number of available card slots; the highest card slot availability reduces the protection. shows the protection types that can be set up for ONS 15454 cards.\n\nProcedure: Create Protection Groups\n\nStep 1 From the CTC window, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Protection subtab.\n\nStep 3 Under Protection Groups, click Create.\n\nStep 4 In the Create Protection Group dialog ( ), enter the following:\n\n• Name—type a name for the protection group, up to 32 alpha-numeric characters.\n\n• Type—choose the protection type: 1:1, 1:N, or 1+1. The protection selected determines the cards that are available to serve as protect and working cards. For example, if you choose 1:N protection, only DS-1N and DS-3N cards are displayed.\n\n• Protect Card or Port—choose the protect card (if using 1:1 or 1:N) or protect port (if using 1+1) from the list.\n\nBased on these selections, a list of available working cards or ports is displayed under Available Cards or Available Ports.\n\nFigure 3-15 Create Protection Group Dialog (1+1)\n\nStep 5 From the Available Cards or Available Ports list, choose the card or port that you want to be the working card or port (the card(s) or port(s) that will be protected by the card or port selected in Protect Cards or Protect Ports). Select the top arrow button to move them to the Working Cards or Working Ports list.\n\nStep 6 Complete the remaining fields:\n\n• Bidirectional switching—(optical cards only) click if you want both transmit and receive channels to switch if a failure occurs to one.\n\n• Revertive—if checked, the ONS 15454 reverts back to the working card or port after failure conditions are corrected.\n\n• Reversion time—if Revertive is checked, enter the amount of time following failure condition correction that the ONS 15454 should switch back to the working card or port.\n\nStep 7 Click OK.\n\nProcedure: Edit Protection Groups\n\nStep 1 From the CTC window, click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Protection subtab ( ).\n\nFigure 3-16 Provisioning>Protection Subtab\n\nStep 3 Under Protection Groups, choose a protection group.\n\nStep 4 Under Selected Group, edit the fields as appropriate. (For field descriptions, see the \"Create Protection Groups\" section.)\n\nStep 5 Click Apply.\n\nProcedure: Delete Protection Groups\n\nStep 1 Log in to CTC.\n\nStep 2 Verify that working traffic is not running on the protect card:\n\n(a) Click the Maintenance>Protection tabs.\n\n(b) Under Protection Groups, choose the group you want to delete.\n\n(c) Under Selected Group, verify that the protect card is in standby mode. If it is in standby mode, continue with Step 3. If it is active, manually switch traffic back to the working card. Verify that the protect card is in standby mode, then continue with Step 3. If the protect card is still active, do not continue. Begin troubleshooting procedures or call technical support.\n\nStep 3 From the CTC window, click the Provisioning>Protection tabs.\n\nStep 4 Under Protection Groups, click a protection group.\n\nStep 5 Click Delete.\n\n3.9.7 Setting Up ONS 15454 Timing\n\nYou must set the SONET timing parameters for each ONS 15454. ONS 15454 timing is set to one of two modes: external or line. In typical ONS 15454 networks, at least one node is set to external and the other nodes are set to line. The external node derives its timing from a Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS) source wired to the BITS backplane pins. ( Figure 1-20 shows a diagram of the BITS pin location.) The BITS source, in turn, derives its timing from a Primary Reference Source (PRS) such as a Stratum 1 clock or GPS signal. The line nodes derive timing from Optical Carrier cards.\n\nFor protection, up to three timing references can be identified. These are typically two BITS-level or line-level sources and an internal reference. The internal reference is the Stratum 3 (ST3) clock provided on every ONS 15454 TCC card.\n\nshows an ONS 15454 network timing setup example. Node 1 is set to external timing. Two references are set to BITS. These are Stratum 1 timing sources wired to the node's BITS input pins on the ONS 15454 backplane. Its third reference is set to internal. The BITS output pins on the backplane of Node 3 are used to provide timing to outside equipment, such as a Digital Access Line Access Multiplexer.\n\nFigure 3-17 ONS 15454 Timing Example\n\nSynchronization Status Messaging (SSM) is a SONET protocol that communicates information about the quality of the timing source. SSM messages are carried on the S1 byte of the SONET Line layer. They enable SONET devices to automatically select the highest quality timing reference and to avoid timing loops.\n\nSSM messages are either Generation 1 or Generation 2. Generation 1 is the first and most widely deployed SSM message set. Generation 2 is a newer version. If you enable SSM for the ONS 15454, consult your timing reference documentation to determine which message set to use. and show the Generation 1 and Generation 2 message sets.\n\nProcedure: Setup ONS 15454 Timing\n\nStep 1 Log into the node and click the Provisioning tab.\n\nStep 2 Click the Timing subtab ( ) and complete the following:\n\n• Timing Mode—set to External if timing is derived from an external BITS source wired to the backplane pins; set to Line if timing is derived from an Optical Carrier card.\n\n• SSM Message Set—choose the message set level supported by your network. If a Generation 1 node receives a Generation 2 message, the message will be mapped down to the next available Generation 1. For example, a ST3E message becomes a ST3.\n\n• Quality of RES—if your timing source supports the reserve S1 byte, you set the timing quality here. (Most timing sources do not use RES.) Qualities are displayed in descending quality order as ranges. For example, ST3<RES<ST2 means the timing reference is higher than a Stratum 3 and lower than a Stratum 2. See and for more information.\n\n• Revertive—if checked, the ONS 15454 reverts back to a primary reference source after the conditions that caused it to switch to a secondary timing reference are corrected.\n\n• Revertive Time—If Revertive is checked, indicate the amount of time the ONS 15454 will wait before reverting back to its primary timing source.\n\nThe BITS Facilities section sets the parameters used by your BITS1 and BITS2 timing references. Many of these settings are determined by the timing source manufacturer.\n\n• State—set the BITS reference to IS (In Service) or OOS (Out of Service). For nodes set to Line timing, set State to OOS; for nodes using external timing, or nodes using the external BITS out, set State to IS.\n\n• Coding—set to the coding used by your BITS reference, either B8ZS or AMI.\n\n• Framing—set to the framing used by your BITS reference, either ESF (Extended Super Frame, or SF (D4)(Super Frame). Synchronization Status Messaging is not available with Super Frame.\n\n• Sync Messaging—check to enable Synchronization Status Messaging.\n\n• AIS Threshold—sets the quality level where a node sends an AIS from the BITS 1 Out and BITS 2 Out backplane pins. When a node times at or below the AIS Threshold quality, AIS is sent (used when SSM is disabled or frame is SF).\n\nReference fields define up to three timing references for the node and up to six BITS Out references. BITS Out references define the timing references used by equipment that can be attached to the node's BITS Out pins on the backplane. If you attach equipment to BITS Out, you normally attach it to a Line mode node because equipment near the External timing reference can be directly wired to the reference.\n\n• NE Reference—defines up to three network element (the current node) references (Ref 1, Ref 2, Ref3). The options displayed depend on the node's timing mode. If the timing mode is External, the options are BITS1, BITS2, and Internal. If the timing mode is Line, the node's working optical cards are displayed. In this case, select optical ports on cards that are directly or indirectly connected to a BITS timed source, that is, the node's trunk cards.\n\n• BITS 1 Out/BITS 2 Out—define the timing references for equipment wired to the BITS Out backplane pins. Normally, BITS Out is used with Line nodes, so the options displayed are the working optical cards.\n\nFigure 3-18 Provisioning>Timing Subtab\n\nStep 3 Click Apply.\n\n3.10 Viewing ONS 15454 Inventory\n\nThe Inventory tab ( ) displays information about cards installed in the ONS 15454 node including part numbers, serial numbers, hardware revisions, and equipment types. The tab provides a central location to obtain information and to determine applicability of ONS 15454 Product Change Notices (PCNs) and Field Service Bulletins (FSBs). Using the ONS 15454 export feature, you can export inventory data from ONS 15454 nodes into spreadsheet and database programs, where information can be consolidated for network inventory management and reporting.\n\nFigure 3-19 Inventory Tab\n\nThe Inventory tab displays the following information about the cards installed in the ONS 15454:\n\n• Slot #—the slot where the card is installed.\n\n• Eqpt Type—equipment type the slot is provisioned for, for example, OC-12 or DS-1.\n\n• Actual Eqpt Type—the actual card that is installed in the slot, for example, OC12 IR 4 1310 or DS1N-14.\n\nNote While an ONS 15454 slot is provisioned by the card that is installed in the slot, you can pre-provision a slot before the card is installed by right-clicking the slot in node view and selecting a card type.\n\n• HW Part #—card part number; this number is printed on the top of the card\n\n• HW Rev—card revision number\n\n• Serial #—card serial number; this number is unique to each card\n\n• CLEI Code—Common Language Equipment Identifier code\n\n• Firmware Rev—revision number of the software used by the ASIC chip installed on the card\n\n3.11 Printing and Exporting CTC Data\n\nYou can print CTC windows and you can print CTC data that is displayed in columns, such as alarms and inventory. You can also export CTC table data in formats that can be used use by other applications such as spreadsheets, word processors, and database management applications. shows CTC data that can be exported.\n\nProcedure: Print CTC Data\n\nUse the following procedure to print CTC screens and data. Before you start, make sure your PC is connected to a printer.\n\nStep 1 From the CTC File menu, click Print.\n\nStep 2 In the Print dialog ( ) choose an option:\n\n• Entire Frame—prints the entire CTC window\n\n• Tabbed View—prints the lower half of the CTC window\n\n• Table Contents—prints CTC data in table format; this option is only available for CTC table data (see )\n\nFigure 3-20 CTC Print Dialog\n\nStep 3 Click OK.\n\nStep 4 In the Windows Print dialog, choose a printer and click Print.\n\nProcedure: Export CTC Data\n\nStep 1 From the CTC File menu, click Export.\n\nStep 2 In the Export dialog ( ) choose an option:\n\n• As HTML—saves the data as an HTML file. The file can be viewed with a web browser without running CTC.\n\n• As CSV—saves the CTC table values as text, separated by commas. You can import CSV data into spreadsheets and database management programs.\n\n• As TSV—saves the CTC table values as text, separated by tabs. You can import TSV data into spreadsheets and database management programs.\n\nFigure 3-21 CTC Export Dialog\n\nStep 3 Click OK.\n\nStep 4 In the Save dialog, enter a file name in one of the following formats:\n\n• [filename].htm for HTML files.\n\n• [filename].csv for CSV files.\n\n• [filename].tsv for TSV files.\n\nStep 5 Navigate to a directory where you want to store the file.\n\nStep 6 Click OK.\n\n3.12 Displaying CTC Data in Other Applications\n\nYou can display CTC data exported in HTML with any web browser application, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. To display the data, use the web browser's File/Open command to open the CTC data file.\n\nYou can display CTC data exported as comma separated values (CSV) or tab separated values (TSV) in text editors, word processors, spreadsheets, and database management applications. Although procedures depend on the application, you typically can use File/Open to display the CTC data. Text editors and word processors display the data exactly as it is exported. Spreadsheet and database management applications display the data in cells. You can then format and manage the data using the spreadsheet or database management application tools."
