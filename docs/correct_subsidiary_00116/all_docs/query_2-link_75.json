Cisco's extensive portfolio of 800 Series ISR routers is made up of desktop, fanless devices designed and priced for small businesses, branch locations, retail shops, telecommuters, and customers of ISPs. Many devices in Cisco's 800 family of routers have been released with many options over the course of many years. The 881 Series of ISR routers exemplifies the vast selection of options available within Cisco's 800 product family. Various models in Cisco's 881 router portfolio can enable unified media environments by providing IP voice and video, wireless and data in one integrated appliance. Built-in security can include encryption, VPN tunneling, firewall, and URL filtering. For survivability, available features for Cisco 881 ISR routers include duplicate wide area network links or support for wired broadband WAN connections such as DSL as well as multiple cellular 3G and 4G wireless connections all built into a single appliance.\n\nCisco's 880 Series of ISR routers allow a wide range of deployment scenarios\n\nThe basic Cisco 881 has a 4-port fast Ethernet managed switch that delivers 15 Mbps performance, support for 20 users, 2-port integrated Power over Ethernet, and IPv6 compatibility. Cisco's 881W router includes 802.11g/n Wi-Fi. The 881 SRST router features four FXS ports and 1 FXO port for PSTN fallback with Cisco Survivable Remote Site Telephony. With a Cisco CUBE license, Cisco's 881 ISR router allows SIP trunking to replace outdated PRI lines or foreign exchange-office (FXO) voice connectivity to a PSTN carrier. SIP trunks also connect offsite agents in Cisco Call Center deployments.\n\n4000 Series ISR Routers\n\nCisco's 4000 Line of ISR Routers are compact modular and expandable platforms intended for organizations with multiple branch offices and offsite users requiring direct communication with in-house data centers as well as public clouds via VPN tunnels and the Internet. Cisco's 4000 series provides the bandwidth needed for hybrid WAN environments to accommodate mobile workers, cloud services, and HD multimedia applications by using WAN optimization, deep packet inspection, and traffic-management technology. Models in Cisco's ISR 4000 family are powered by Cisco's IOS XE software, come in a 1RU or 2RU package, can handle as much as 2 Gbps of throughput, and can have up to 3 network interface module slots, 2 service module slots, 4 integrated 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, and 8 CPU core integrated server modules. Cisco ISR 4000 models support integrated Gigabit Ethernet, T1/E1, T3/E3, PRI and xDSL. To handle unified communications, the 400o ISR provides comprehensive edge support for policy-enhanced session border control, telephony survivability, and Time Division Multiplexing gateways.\n\nThe primary difference between the Cisco 4400 ISR and 4300 Series is dual power supply capability in the 4400 ISR Series, providing a higher level of fault tolerance. The 4321 Integrated Services Router has a 1 RU desktop form factor with two network interface modules, delivers as much as 100 Mbps performance, and can handle 240 Digital Voice and Video Channels.

Cisco's WAN aggregation and service provider router product line includes the Cisco ASR 1000 routers and the 9000 ASR routers.\n\nProgent's national team of CCIE certified network consultants have in-depth experience working with enterprise businesses and service providers to design optimal installations and smooth upgrades of Cisco's midrange and carrier-class routers. Progent's GIAC-certified information assurance consultants can provide unbiased, independent security vulnerability assessments, penetration testing services and advanced Security information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to help companies that use Cisco's WAN aggregation routers to meet industry standards and statutory regulations for IT information security and reporting. Progent also offers help with Horizon3.ai's NodeZero platform for pentesting. NodeZero depends on AI technology to simplify the threat evaluation cycle of discovering cybersecurity gaps in network perimeters and inside the internal network, recommending remediation, fixing problems, and verifying successful repairs.\n\nCisco ASR 1000 WAN Edge Routers\n\nCisco's ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services line of routers is positioned in the center of Cisco's midrange devices that focus on acting as headends at the wide area network edge. ASR 1000 routers provide a small footprint, multi-function solution for large businesses looking for satellite office aggregation at multigigabit Ethernet speeds. ASR 1000 Aggregation Services routers introduce an innovative architecture that mixes hardware acceleration with programmable versatility to deliver a multitude of concurrent services without sacrificing dependable responsiveness.\n\nASR 1000 WAN Edge routers feature Cisco's proprietary QuantumFlow Processor composed of 40 custom Packet Processing Engines (PPEs) that in combination can support as many as 160 concurrent processor threads. This multi-processing structure, in conjunction with hardware acceleration for every service, enables the top-of-the-line ASR 1006 router to expand up to 000 queues, 32K subscribers, 4,000 IPsec VPN tunnels at 10,000 sessions/second, and 2M Netflow records. This processing power permits ASR 1000 Series routers to support a broad range of sophisticated services concurrently in massive volume without suffering performance decay that could violate compliance with SLAs.
