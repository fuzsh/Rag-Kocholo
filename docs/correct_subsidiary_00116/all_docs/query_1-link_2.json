I have checked two brands whom provide NTP service\n\nplease can anyone recommend which one is the best\n\nSecureSync / Orolia or Sonoma D12 / EndRun\n\nA lot of people are successfully using a Raspberry Pi as a Stratum 1 NTP server. Granted, this solution isn't enterprise grade, and can't handle a huge load (it can probably handle a couple of hundred clients), but for about $50-60 US dollars, its hard to beat.\n\nMicrosemi and Meinberg also make enterprise-grade stratum-1 NTP servers. But, those run $2-3000 all the way up to about $20K."
