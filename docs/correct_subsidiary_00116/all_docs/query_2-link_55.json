TA2 at the same time, and then only covers TA2.\n\nthe satellite may broadcast two TACs (including TAC1 and TAC2) at the same time, so the UE will receive two TACs at the same time, which results in

include the following operation.\n\nthe first network device In response to determining that the first TA is an area allowing the terminal device to initiate a service and the first TA being not in an RA configured by a core network for the terminal device, the first network device transmits a configuration update instruction to the terminal device.\n\nthe configuration update instruction carries the indication that the terminal device is in the first TA.\n\nthe first network device transmits a rejection message to the terminal device.\n\nthe rejection message carries the indication that the terminal device is in the first TA.\n\nthe network device indicates the TA where the UE is located to the UE, so that the terminal device may know the TA where the terminal device is located, so as to perform a normal communication process and reduce improper operations on the communication process.\n\nthe first network device may be a core network device, such as an AMF, and the second network device may be a base station.\n\nthe interaction process between the AMF and the base station may include the following operations.\n\nthe first network device being an AMF and the second network device being a base station as an example, the above method is described in detail with following specific embodiments.\n\na secure connection is established after the UE is registered, and the base station may know the accurate location of the UE through information such as UE location measurement or Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and may obtain the TA where the UE initiates the NAS

That is, there are the following two cases.\n\nthe TAs corresponding to all TAIs received by the AMF are the areas allowing the UE to initiate the service.\n\nany TA the UE currently located is an area allowing the UE to initiate the service, so that the AMF accepts the NAS request and continues to perform the NAS process.\n\na part of the TAs corresponding to the TAIs received by the AMF is the area allowing the UE to initiate the service, and another part is the restricted area.\n\nthe TA where the UE is currently located may be the area allowing the UE to initiate the service, or may be the restricted area.\n\nthe TA where the UE is currently located may be the area allowing the UE to initiate the service, or may be the restricted area, in both cases, the AMF first considers that the TA where the UE is currently located is the area allowing the UE to initiate the service, accepts the NAS request, and continues to perform the NAS process.

Further, the AMF may determine the first TA where the UE is located, and the configuration update instruction transmitted by the AMF to the UE carries an indication that the UE is in the first TA.\n\nthe AMF may determine the first TA where the UE is located. Then, in response to determining that the first TA is an area allowing the terminal device to initiate a service and the first TA is not in the RA configured by the core network for the terminal device, the configuration update is performed on the terminal device. In response to determining that the first TA is a restricted area, the AMF releases the corresponding connection.\n\nthe method may further include the following operation.\n\nthe first network device transmits a configuration update instruction to the terminal device in response to the above at least two TAs corresponding to the at least two TAIs being areas allowing the terminal device to initiate the service.\n\nthe method may further include the following operations.\n\nthe first network device determines the first TA where the terminal device is located from the at least two TAs corresponding to the at least two TAIs.\n\nthe first network device transmits a configuration update instruction to the terminal device.\n\nthe configuration update instruction carries an indication that the terminal device is in the first TA.\n\nThis method is applicable to the case that the at least two TAs corresponding to the at least two TAIs received by the AMF are areas allowing the terminal device to initiate the service, and is also applicable to the case that not all of the at least two TAs corresponding to the at least two TAIs are areas allowing the terminal device to initiate the service.\n\nthe method may further include the following operations.\n\nthe first network device determines the first TA where the terminal device is located from the at least two TAs corresponding to the at least two TAIs.\n\nthe first network device transmits an N2 resource release request to the second network device or transmits a connection release request to the terminal device.\n\nthe N2 resource release request carries an indication that the terminal device is in the first TA\n\nthe connection release request carries the indication that the terminal device is in the first TA.\n\nthe AMF transmits the N2 resource release request to the base station, and the AMF transmits the connection release request to the UE.\n\nthe above restricted area includes a non-allowed area or a forbidden area.\n\nthe operation of the first network device determining the first TA where the terminal device is located includes the following operations.\n\nthe first network device performs a location service (LCS) process to determine a location of the terminal device.\n\nLCS location service\n\nthe first network determines the first TA where the terminal device is located according to the location.\n\nthe UE receives a broadcast message containing two TACs which includes the TA1 and the TA2.\n\nUE in a connected state initiates an NAS request, such as a PDU session establishment request.\n\nthe base station has no capability of determining an accurate location of the UE. Therefore, the base station transmits both two TAIs (e.g. TA1, TA2) in ULI in an N2 message to an AMF.\n\nboth TAs corresponding to the two TAIs are areas allowing the UE to initiate a service. For example, when the terminal device moves from the TA1 to the TA2, the first TA where the UE is currently located is the TA2.\n\nFIG. 8 is an implementation flowchart of the third embodiment of the present disclosure. The implementation includes the following operations.\n\nFIG. 9 is an implementation flowchart of the fourth embodiment of the present disclosure.

Therefore, the base station transmits both two TAIs in ULI in an N2 message to the AMF.\n\nthe TA1 is an area allowing the UE to initiate a service\n\nthe TA2 is a restricted area. For example, when the terminal device moves from the TA1 to the TA2, the first TA where the UE is currently located is the TA2.\n\nFIG. 12 is an implementation flowchart of the seventh embodiment of the present disclosure. The implementation includes the following operations.\n\nthe UE in an idle state initiates an NAS request, such as a service request.\n\nthe base station has no capability of determining an accurate location of the UE.

Then the AMF initiates the LCS process to determine the TA where the UE is located. If the TA where the UE is located is a restricted area, the AMF releases the corresponding connection, and the release request carries the indication that the UE is in the first TA.\n\nthe above embodiments only take the NAS request such as a service request and PDU session establishment request as example, but the method proposed in the present disclosure is not limited to these two processes.\n\nthe present disclosure takes the broadcast message received by the UE containing TA1 and TA2 as an example, which indicates a case that the UE receives TAs.\n\nthe present application does not limit the number of TAs received by the UE.
