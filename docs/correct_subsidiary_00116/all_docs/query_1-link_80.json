        "text": "The one gotcha that you'll want to be aware of is the stratum of the NTP clock you are synchronizing to: it must be in stratum two or better to be TAC-supported. CUCM will still synchronize to lower-stratum clock sources; however, TAC may stop troubleshooting an issue they believe to be time-related (e.g. database replication). I learned this lesson with a CUP subcluster that kept failing over for no apparent reason. Turns out that the heartbeats weren't being trusted since the stratum was too low. This matters because the CUP nodes get time from the CUCM publisher, changing stratums twice along the way.\n\nYou can test this with the following CLI command:\n\nadmin:utils diagnose module ntp_stratum\n\nLog file: platform/log/diag3.log\n\nStarting diagnostic test(s)\n\n===========================\n\ntest - ntp_stratum : Failed\n\nThe reference NTP server is a stratum 7 clock.\n\nNTP servers with stratum 5 or worse clocks are deemed unreliable.\n\nPlease consider using an NTP server with better stratum level.\n\nPlease use OS Admin GUI to add/delete NTP servers.\n\nPlease remember to rate helpful responses and identify helpful or correct answers.\n\nTAC wasn't able to cough up documentation to defend their position at the time other than that command output shown above; however, even after an escalation over the matter they wouldn't back down. They cut the customer off until they got the CUCM publisher to stratum three. I just went back and re-checked a CUCM 8.6.2.22900-9 subscriber and confirmed this failure condition still exists; however, a CUP 8.6.4.10000-28 just passed the test even though it was at stratum seven. Even with the too low of a stratum causing a diagnose test failure, CUCM shows that it is properly synchronized to the stratum seven clock. The difference between CUCM and CUP in these newer releases may imply that they are lifting this restriction and it hasn't made it into the CUCM code yet but lacking documentation on this I can't be sure.\n\nIf we draw this out it, the lowest you can go is this:\n\nGPS/Atomic Clock\n\nStratum One Clock (1)\n\nStratum Two Clock (2)\n\nCUCM Publisher (3)\n\nCUCM Subscriber (4)\n\nCUP Publisher/Subscribers (4)\n\nIt's a bit murky but since I got burnt over it I have been following the apparent rule until the 'utils diagnose module ntp_stratum' stops failing when at lower stratums. Trying to stave off the 'Another day, another TAC case' life motto I seem to operate under.\n\nPlease remember to rate helpful responses and identify helpful or correct answers.\n\nI concur with Jonathan here (+5). I had an absolute nightmare recently trying to get a new CUCM Sub to join a Pub. In the end it came down to the Pub receiving time from a stratum 5 NTP server. It added one to the received stratum level making it 6 and the Sub refused to join. This was at version 8.6. I synched the Pub to an stratum 1 clock and the Sub then burst into life.\n\nI haven't had the time to test 9.x yet to see if it has changed. I hope so as IMVHO it is a bit of a daft restriction.\n\nBarry\n\nBarry Hesk\n\nIntrinsic Network Solutions\n\nHi\n\nJonathan - I see your methodology and yes, it seems like a pragmatic way of working.\n\nHowever, stuff like this is really annoying. The whole point of NTP is that it is hierarchical, and although a stratum 9 might be 9 steps from an atomic clock, it's difficult to see it causing a problem.\n\nIt's also especially annoying when TAC come out with that sort of hard line with no documentation to back it up - i.e. the docs for CUCM clearly state stratum 9 as the minimum (\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/install/8_6_1/install/cmins861.html#wp804989) and when I recently looked this up for a question on this very forum I found that the other products had similar documented requirements - e.g. CUPS\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cups/8_6/english/install_upgrade/installation/guide/CUPInstallGuide_May18.pdf.\n\nAaron\n\nAaron Please remember to rate helpful posts to identify useful responses, and mark 'Answered' if appropriate!\n\nHi folks,\n\nGreat thread here! Very interesting to say the least (+5 to all of you )\n\nI guess the guides must be hierarchical as well\n\nSo first we have the install guides;\n\nNote\n\nCisco recommends that you use an external NTP server to ensure accurate system time on the first node. Ensure the external NTP server is stratum 9 or higher (meaning stratums 1-9). Subsequent nodes in the cluster will get their time from the first node.When you are installing Cisco Unity Connection on a virtual machine, you must specify an external NTP server.\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/install/8_6_1/install/cmins861.html#wp804989\n\nThen the SRND;\n\nUnified CM automatically synchronizes the NTP time of all subscribers in the cluster to the publisher. During installation, each subscriber is automatically configured to point to an NTP server running on the publisher. The publisher considers itself to be a master server and provides time for the cluster based on its internal hardware clock unless it is configured to synchronize from an external server. Cisco highly recommends configuring the publisher to point to a Stratum-1, Stratum-2, or Stratum-3 NTP server to ensure that the cluster time is synchronized with an external time source.\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/8x/netstruc.html#wpxref14097\n\nAnd finally the NTP Whitepaper;\n\nFor Cisco Unified CallManager Versions 5.0 and later:\n\n– Manual configuration of the ntpd.conf file is not allowed.\n\n– Cisco Unified CallManager prompts the administrator to specify the external NTP server at publisher installation and automatically populates the ntpd.conf file on the publisher server.\n\n– The ntpd.conf files of all other cluster servers are automatically configured to point to the publisher as the NTP source.\n\n• Configure the publisher to point to a traceable stratum 1 clock source.\n\n• Configure network latency between the publisher and the dedicated clock source so that it is within 40 milliseconds round-trip time (RTT).\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6788/vcallcon/ps556/prod_white_paper0900aecd8037fdb5.html\n\nI'm going to open a thread in the 'Documentation\" section of the forums and see what we can find\n\nout.\n\nCheers!\n\nRob\n\nEDIT: here's the thread that has been opened;\n\nhttps://supportforums.cisco.com/thread/2195177\n\n\"Spend your life waiting,\n\nfor a moment that just don't come,\n\nWell, don't waste your time waiting\"\n\n-Springsteen"
