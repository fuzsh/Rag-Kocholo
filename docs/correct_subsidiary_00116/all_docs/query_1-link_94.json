There is a CLI command: utils diagnose module ntp_stratum which is referenced in the TechNote that Leo linked to above. It should pass on all nodes including subscribers! If this fails TAC will tell you to fix it before supporting the system. I learned this the hard way when I had a CUPS (now IM&P) cluster randomly performing HA failovers even though the NTP time was definitely synced and stable across all nodes.\n\nAs I understand it, some components of the products will discard the NTP-synced time as unreliable based solely on the stratum number even if nothing is wrong. They claimed that if was working as designed and that I needed to get a more reliable I me source.\n\nI suggest having the router sync to a stratum one or two time source or having CUCM and related apps sync farther up the tree in your environment. Faking the stratum isn't really a solution IMO.\n\nHey Johnathan,\n\nThanks for the reply. The router sync'd with a stratum 2 source as shown in my previous post. Which made the stratum on the router 3 and the stratum on cucm pub 4.\n\nadmin:utils diagnose module ntp_stratum\n\nLog file: platform/log/diag1.log\n\nStarting diagnostic test(s)\n\n===========================\n\ntest - ntp_stratum : Passed\n\nDiagnostics Completed\n\nThe final output will be in Log file: platform/log/diag1.log\n\nPlease use 'file view activelog platform/log/diag1.log' command to see the output\n\nadmin:\n\nI googled the command you listed:\n\n(utils diagnose module ntp_stratum) and came across a post that you were involved in 3 yrs ago and the hierarchy that you mentioned matches with the documentation I read:\n\nIf we draw this out it, the lowest you can go is this:\n\nGPS/Atomic Clock\n\nStratum One Clock (1)\n\nStratum Two Clock (2)\n\nCUCM Publisher (3)\n\nCUCM Subscriber (4)\n\nCUP Publisher/Subscribers (4)\n\nThe router if I set it as NTP master sets a stratum of 7 or so. I'm syncing up with an external source us.ntp.pool which is coming in as a stratum 2 to the router.\n\nStratum Two Clock (2)\n\nCisco router (3)\n\nCUCM Pub(4)\n\nAre you pointing your pub directly to an external NTP source to get a lower stratum number? How secure is that?\n\nIn most environments I am in we choose two routers in the data center to act as time servers for the enterprise and give them DNS aliases (e.g. ntp1.cisco.com). Those two routers sync to an external stratum one server(s) and then peer with one another. To that I sync everything within the data center.
