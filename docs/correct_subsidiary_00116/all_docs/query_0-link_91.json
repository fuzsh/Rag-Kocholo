        "text": "Dr. Garcia Luna Aceves\n\nDr. Garcia Luna Aceves is one of the original Co-Founders of ADARA. He is one of the world’s preeminent authorities on networking, including wired and wireless routing and multimedia communications. He is the visionary behind the Company’s technology portfolio. Dr. Garcia Luna Aceves is currently a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), Chair of the Computer Science and Engineering Department, and CITRIS Campus director. UCSC is home to numerous leading research projects in wireless and mobile networking, sponsored over the years by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Office of naval Research (ONR), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and private industry.\n\nHe was Center Director at SRI International (formerly Stanford Research Institute). He has also been a Principal Scientist at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), a Visiting Professor at Sun Microsystems, and a Principal for Protocol Design at Nokia. He created and developed the Diffusing Update Algorithm, the basis for Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), the core long-time proprietary networking protocol, never duplicated, which is in Cisco Systems routers, the majority of globally deployed networking infrastructure. He helped found Rooftop Communications, a wireless networking company, which was acquired by Nokia.\n\nDr. Bradley R. Smith\n\nDr. Smith, is one of the Co-Founders ADARA. He holds a Ph.D. focused in network routing protocol security. His current work is in the areas of policy-based routing, formalizing trust in the context of a routing computation, object routing, and the application of these technologies to the improvement of the security and robustness of Internet-based systems.\n\nHis work in this field spans over a decade of extensive research and contributes greatly to the portfolio of core technology assembled under ADARA Networks. Currently, Dr. Smith is an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nRaghu Gangi\n\nMr. Gangi is the Chief Networking Engineer for ADARA and the visionary behind the creation of the ADARA cloud and switching platform. Mr. Gangi was the visionary behind the ADARA implementation of the Open Flow Data Plane Abstraction which enabled ADARA as the launch partner for the Broadcom Strata XGS (Trident and Tomahawk) System On a Chip; the highest performing Merchant Silicon Switch in the World. Mr. Gangi created the Industry’s Highest Performing Virtual SD WAN platform, which established a new record for Performance in SD WAN. Mr. Gangi conceived, designed and managed the implementation of the ADARA Virtual Cloud Platform that led to ADARA being named one of the Worlds 50 Leading Cloud Companies in a survey of the World’s leading Venture Capital and Institutional Investors. Mr. Gangi also represents ADARA in collaborations with Open Standards Communities including ON.Lab (ONOS), ONF, which are the standards organizations for Software Defined Networking and the World’s Leading Service Providers. At ADARA, he is responsibilities include complete ownership of production code from the development team.\n\nPrior, Mr. Gangi was Senior Software Engineer and Senior Technology Lead at IPInfusion Inc; where he participated in the creation of the IP stacks for nearly every major company, every major IP product implementation. He has been a Senior Engineer and Agile Team Lead at Nokia India Pvt Ltd., and Senior Software Engineer in Products Group of Aricent Inc. Mr. Gangi and a Bachelor’s Degree and Master’s Degree in Computer Science, dissertation work included design and development at the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, the leading Indian Institution in research in networking, computing, and QoS. His own work included a focus on QoS provisioning system for IP telephony.\n\nDr. Marcelo Spohn\n\nDr. Spohn is one of the world’s leading authorities on routing, scalable routing and multiple path routing, especially links of unequal costs. Dr. Spohn is the Co-Creator of the Nokia Wireless IP Router based upon the following patents (assigned to Nokia). Dr. Spohn along with Dr. Garcia Luna Aceves, Co-invented the Raytheon Packet Radio for the US Department of Defense which was based upon the WINGS (Wireless Internet Gateways) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/DARPA Contract. Dr. Spohn was a PhD student under Dr. Garcia Luna Aceves, the inventor of DUAL, the Diffusing Update Algorithm Finite State Machine and Cisco’s Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, and EIGRP, the world’s most commercially successful / widely deployed routing protocol (Cisco).\n\nDr. Spohn with Dr. Garcia Luna Aceves invented the successor to EIGRP, ADARA’s Dynamic Link State Protocol (DLSP), which has been validated in the DOE-ESNET (United States Department of Energy - Energy Sciences Network) where DLSP was tested against the best-performing published results for the most efficient routing approaches known to date. ADARA DLSP was shown to be superior in every scenario without modifications. Dr. Spohn created ADARA’s Multipath Networking Engine for Layer 2 (ADARA’s L2/3 Packet Switch). Dr. Spohn and Dr. Xie were Co-creators of ADARA’s WAN Optimization Engine and ADARA’s Control Plane; a novel Layer 2-7 Control Plane.\n\nDr. Qiaobing Xie\n\nDr. Xie is one of the world’s leading authorities on core internet protocols, networking, active queue management (QoS) and transmission control. He is a key participant in the Internet Engineering Task Force RFC2960 - Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), and other RFCs, he hold multiple patents and co-authored a book on SCTP. He was Chief Engineer at The Resource Group. He served as a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at Motorola. He served as a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff at NYNEX, now Verizon. Dr. Xie is Inventor of Rserpool; Resource pooling in an internet protocol-based communication system, plus numerous other protocols.\n\nDr. Qiaobing Xie, along with ADARA Distinguished Engineer Randall R. Stewart (Distinguished Engineer at Cisco, Distinguished Engineer at Huawei) is designer of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol, which serves in a similar role to the core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite; Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and popular protocol User Datagram Protocol (UDP), with SCTP being superior over these core protocols in many respects. SCTP provides some of the same service features of both: it is message-oriented like UDP and ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP. Dr. Xie and Mr. Stewart collaborated to submit and make SCTP an accepted IETF standard; they also collaborated upon the implementation of SCTP at Cisco as a Cisco standard. Dr. Xie and Mr. Stewart originally invented the SCTP protocol while at Motorola."
