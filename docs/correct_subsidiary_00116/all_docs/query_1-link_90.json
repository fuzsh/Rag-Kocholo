I figure it has the least amount of downtime of any server I would run NTP services on, doesn't get patched frequently like a traditional file server(so less downtime), and I don't plan on replacing it in the forseeable future.\n\nI've put in a basic config, but it doesn't seem to be working(or at least my linux servers don't see it as an NTP server).\n\nHere are the pertinant bits from the config:\n\ninterface Loopback99\n\ndescription ntp server address\n\nip address 192.168.199.99 255.255.255.255\n\n.....\n\nntp source Loopback99\n\nntp server 128.118.46.3\n\nThe NTP server command points to a stratum one server at Penn State University. I have the following config in my ASA to allow the loopback to poll the remote NTP server:\n\naccess-list Inside_access_in extended permit udp host 192.168.199.99 any eq ntp\n\nnat (Inside) 1 192.168.199.99 255.255.255.255\n\nAny thoughts on what I'm missing or have configured incorrectly?"
