        "text": "Time synchronization serves a fundamental role in any network, but it's too often added as an afterthought. However, it can mean the difference between correctly troubleshooting a conflict in minutes and having no idea why the server is figuratively on fire. For financial and scientific institutions, time synchronization must be accurate to a billionth—or in some specific cases, even a trillionth—of a second, but even commercial and industrial organizations are starting to push for synchronization accuracy in the sub-millisecond range.\n\nWhy can't we just update our computers to the public NTP servers at NIST, which runs one of the world's most accurate clocks, and call it a day? Unfortunately, latency exists everywhere, and it makes perfect synchronization impossible. The speed of light is fast—in a vacuum, a photon could circle our world more than seven times per second—and even though it travels approximately 31 percent slower through a typical optical fiber network, you could easily transmit a single bit of data halfway around the world in less than a tenth of a second.\n\nHowever, we all know that that ideal world doesn't exist. Add in switches, routers, and other network infrastructure, and that tenth of a second multiplies several times over. Without specialized equipment, your network is suddenly off by the better part of a second from NIST in the US or NPL in the UK."
