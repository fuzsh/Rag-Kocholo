Before you connect to the command line interface (CLI) and begin system configuration, you must understand how the system supports these services.\n\nPage 28: Logical Interfaces\n\n• Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) services • Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) Services • Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) services ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 29: Aaa Servers\n\n• Local Subscribers: These are subscribers, primarily used for testing purposes, that are configured and authenticated within a specific context. Unlike RADIUS-based subscribers, the local subscriber's user profile (containing attributes like those used by RADIUS-based subscribers) is configured within the context where they are created. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 30: Trusted Builds\n\nThis section describes the process that determines which context to use for context-level administrative users or subscriber sessions. Understanding this process allows you to better plan your configuration in terms of how many contexts and interfaces you need to configure. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 31: Context Selection For Context-Level Administrative User Sessions\n\nIf you have configured the user profile on an AAA server, the system must determine how to contact the AAA server to perform authentication. It does this by determining the AAA context for the session. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 32: Asr 5500 System Administration Guide, Staros Release 21.5\n\nThe following table and flowchart describe the process that the system uses to select an AAA context for a context-level administrative user. Items in the table correspond to the circled numbers in the flowchart. Figure 1: Context-level Administrative User AAA Context ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 33: Asr 5500 System Administration Guide, Staros Release 21.5\n\n• Users configured in any non-local context are required to specify which context they are trying to log in to. For example: ssh username@ctx_name@ctx_ip_addrs ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 34: Context Selection For Subscriber Sessions\n\n• In addition to being applied during the boot process, you can also apply configuration files manually at any time by executing the appropriate commands at the CLI prompt. Refer to the instructions in Software Management Operations. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 35: Ip Address Notation\n\nAn IPv6 address is represented by eight groups of 16-bit hexadecimal values separated by colons (:). A typical example of a full IPv6 address is 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 The hexadecimal digits are case-insensitive. The 128-bit IPv6 address can be abbreviated with the following rules: ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 36: Cidr Notation\n\nSome CLI commands require the entry of an alphanumeric string to define a value. The string is a contiguous collection of alphanumeric characters with a defined minimum and maximum length (number of characters). ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 37: Character Set\n\nThe following characters may appear in strings entered in ruledefs, APNs, license keys and other configuration/display parameters: • < > (arrow brackets) [less than or greater than] • * (asterisk) [wildcard] • : (colon) • $ (dollar sign) [wildcard] • . (dot) ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 38: Quoted Strings\n\nQuoted Strings If descriptive text requires the use of spaces between words, the string must be entered within double quotation marks (\" \"). For example: interface \"Rack 3 Chassis 1 port 5/2\" ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 39: Getting Started\n\nOperation. For additional information on configuring the maximum number of sessions for Local-User users and AAA context users, see Configuring Context-level Administrative Users. Each authentication method must be configured separately because each of the three authentication methods can use the same user name. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 40: Automatic Logout Of Cli Sessions\n\nVersion 1 of the SSH protocol is now obsolete due to security vulnerabilities. The v1-rsa keyword has been removed for the Context Configuration mode ssh command. Running a script or configuration that uses the ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 41: Ssh Host Keys\n\nThe ssh key-gen wait-time command specifies this wait time in seconds. The default interval is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

For releases prior to 20.0, StarOS supports a maximum of 64 configurable authorized SSH keys. For Important release 20.0 and higher, StarOS supports a maximum of 200 configurable authorized SSH keys. ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 44: Authorized Ssh User Access\n\nIf pattern is in the format 'USER@IP_ADDRESS' then USER and IP address are separately checked, restricting logins to those users from the specified IP address. The default is to allow unrestricted access by any user.

Two SSH Configuration mode CLI commands allow you to disable or modify this default sshd disconnect behavior. For higher security, Cisco recommends at least a client-alive-countmax of 2 and client-alive-interval of Important 5.\n\nPage 47: Changing Default Sshd Secure Session Logout Parameters\n\n• algorithms is a string of 1 through 511 alphanumeric characters that specifies the algorithm(s) to be used as a single string of comma-separated variables (no spaces) in priority order (left to right) from those shown below: ASR 5500 System Administration Guide, StarOS Release 21.5...\n\nPage 48: Setting Preferred Authentication Methods\n\n• publickey – authentication via SSH v2-RSA protocol. • keyboard-interactive – request for an arbitrary number of pieces of information.

In addition to configuring the timing source, you must configure the system's time zone.

With three or more servers, outlyers and broken or misconfigured servers can be detected and excluded. Generally, the more servers the better (within reason).
