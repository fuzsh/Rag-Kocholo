I'm looking to change this to 3 and would appreciate any advice on things to look out for or potential areas of concern.\n\nNTP server is a router on their network, which is used by other servers.\n\nMany thanks, in anticipation of your response.\n\nCheers Rajan/Mohammad, for the feedback. I didn't think it was possible to change the stratum number on CUCM, I'm aware this needs to be implemented on the NTP server.\n\nMy concern is mainly how this change will affect other servers on their network, that reference the same NTP server? Also if there are things I need to be aware of before embarking on such change.\n\nmany thanks,\n\nIs this the only NTP server in the network? If so then this should be smooth change.\n\nOne thing to do after changing the NTP server startum is to make sure that subscribers synced the new startum from publisher. I have seen a bug in version 9 where subs won't get the updated ntp settings automatically and needs to restart the NTP service.\n\nAs Rajan mentioned, you need to make sure that NTP server is having startum of 3. You can't do this on CUCM. CUCM will read startum from ntp server.\n\nCisco SRND high recommends the use of ntp server with startum 1, 2 or 3 at max."
