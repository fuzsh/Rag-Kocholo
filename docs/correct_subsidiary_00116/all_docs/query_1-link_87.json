Besides that the NTP protocol must support 16-stratum levels. If the CUCM servers don't want that then they are at fault and the problem should be resolved at their site of the fence....\n\nM.\n\n-- Each morning when I wake up and look into the mirror I always say ' Why am I so brilliant ? '\n\nWhen the mirror will then always repond to me with ' The only thing that exceeds your brilliance is your beauty! '\n\nHi,\n\nYou need to configure your core switch or WAN firewall to sync with an NTP server with better stratum.\n\nWhat is the firewall syncing to? If the firewall is syncing to the Internet, you should be able to find stratum 1 servers.\n\nIdeally, you should be able to buy your own stratum 1 appliance for you network\n\nThanks\n\nJohn\n\n**Please rate posts you find helpful**\n\n>I thought there is way to force my core switch to act as lower Stratum level.\n\n- Because of the solidness of the NTP standard that is both not allowed and not possible.\n\nM.\n\n-- Each morning when I wake up and look into the mirror I always say ' Why am I so brilliant ?
