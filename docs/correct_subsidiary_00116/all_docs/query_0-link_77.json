        "text": "As computer technology progresses, the distinction between routers and switches is blurring. Basically, routers are Layer 3 devices that connect networks. A common example is connecting an office network to the Internet. Switches are Layer 2 devices that interconnect client devices within a network. Generally, routers depend heavily on computer processing and field-modifiable software to move data intelligently, offering great versatility at the expense of performance. Switches, in contrast, typically depend upon fixed hardware designs to steer data at the highest possible rate, trading off intelligence in favor of speed. Today's routers usually include Layer 2 switches, and many modern switches include some Layer 3 routing capability. Routers from Cisco, the world's leading supplier, continually improve in functionality and performance and Cisco now offers a comprehensive product line that includes routers engineered to meet the functional and budgetary requirements of customers ranging from households to the world's largest service providers.\n\nThe latest Integrated Services Routers (ISR) from Cisco offer the performance and features to support IP voice and video as well as virtualization while at the same time offering fault tolerance, remote management, easy expandability, plus advanced security.
