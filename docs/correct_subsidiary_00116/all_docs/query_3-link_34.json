        "text": "I have no clue about the internal clock stability, but it doesn't matter much since you absolutely want those devices to be be synchronized, i.e. be NTP clients of a trusted source.\n\nThis is the only way to ensure that logs (or snmp traps or whatever monitoring you use) are consistent among the devices, to allow a good interpretation.\n\nOf course there should be no significant deviation between two NTP update. I have no real data about this but I never saw this problem arise with properly configured devices.\n\nClocks of network devices usually DO NOT have high-quality oscillators. Because those oscillators are expensive hardware.\n\nIf all you need is to distribute wall clock time through NTP (with millisecond precision) , they might suffice.\n\nIf you need high accuracy for services like TDM over packet, you will likely need either SyncE or PTP (precision time protocol), for sub-microsecond precision, and clock sources with high-accuracy oscillator (as you said, specific hardware).\n\nThe answer to your question depends on the level of accuracy which you need. For network logs and PCs/servers running normal applications, it is more than accurate enough. Very precise applications may require a dedicated GPS clock in the device.\n\nThe show ntp status command on Cisco devices gives you a lot of information.\n\nClock is synchronized, stratum 3, reference is 149.125.221.49 nominal freq is 250.0000 Hz, actual freq is 249.9981 Hz, precision is 2**21 ntp uptime is 6979200 (1/100 of seconds), resolution is 4016 reference time is DA773F8B.E3CD5B84 (14:28:59.889 CST Tue Feb 23 2016) clock offset is -0.3724 msec, root delay is 18.04 msec root dispersion is 7.97 msec, peer dispersion is 0.14 msec loopfilter state is 'CTRL' (Normal Controlled Loop), drift is 0.000007535 s/s system poll interval is 1024, last update was 248 sec ago."
