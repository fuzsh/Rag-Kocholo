        "text": "The primary source for time data on your system is the software clock. This clock runs from the moment the system starts up and keeps track of the current date and time. The software clock can be set from a number of sources and in turn can be used to distribute the current time through various mechanisms to other systems. When a router with a hardware clock is initialized or rebooted, the software clock is initially set based on the time in the hardware clock. The software clock can then be updated from the following sources:\n\nManual configuration (using the hardware clock)\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP)\n\nSimple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)\n\nVINES Time Service\n\nBecause the software clock can be dynamically updated, it has the potential to be more accurate than the hardware clock.\n\nThe software clock can provide time to the following services:\n\nAccess lists\n\nLogging and debugging messages\n\nNTP\n\nThe hardware clock\n\nUser show commands\n\nVINES Time Service\n\nNote\n\nThe software clock cannot provide time to the NTP or VINES Time Service if it was set using SNTP.\n\nThe software clock keeps track of time internally based on the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). You can configure information about the local time zone and summer time (daylight saving time) so that time is displayed correctly relative to the local time zone.\n\nThe software clock keeps track of whether the time is authoritative (that is, whether it has been set by a time source considered to be authoritative). If it is not authoritative, the time will be available only for display purposes and will not be redistributed.\n\nNTP is a protocol designed to time-synchronize a network of machines. NTP runs on UDP, which in turn runs on IP. NTP Version 3 is documented in RFC 1305.\n\nAn NTP network usually gets its time from an authoritative time source such as a radio clock or an atomic clock attached to a time server. NTP then distributes this time across the network. NTP is extremely efficient; no more than one packet per minute is necessary to synchronize two machines to the accuracy of within a millisecond of one another.\n\nNTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server typically has an authoritative time source (such as a radio or atomic clock, or a Global Positioning System (GPS) time source) directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time via NTP from a stratum 1 time server, and so on.\n\nNTP has two ways to avoid synchronizing to a machine whose time may not be accurate. NTP will never synchronize to a machine that is not in turn synchronized. NTP will compare the time reported by several machines, and will not synchronize to a machine whose time is significantly different from others, even if its stratum is lower. This strategy effectively builds a self-organizing tree of NTP servers.\n\nThe Cisco implementation of NTP does not support stratum 1 service; in other words, you cannot connect to a radio or atomic clock (for some specific platforms, however, you can connect to a GPS time-source device). Cisco recommends that the time service for your network be derived from the public NTP servers available in the IP Internet.\n\nIf the network is isolated from the Internet, the Cisco implementation of NTP allows a machine to be configured so that it acts as though it is synchronized via NTP, when in fact it has determined the time using other means. Other machines can then synchronize to that machine via NTP.\n\nA number of manufacturers include NTP software for their host systems, and a publicly available version for systems running UNIX. This software also allows UNIX-derivative servers to acquire the time directly from an atomic clock, which would subsequently propagate time information along to Cisco routers.\n\nThe communications between machines running NTP (known as associations) are usually statically configured; each machine is given the IP address of all machines with which it should form associations. Accurate timekeeping is made possible by exchanging NTP messages between each pair of machines with an association.\n\nHowever, in a LAN environment, NTP can be configured to use IP broadcast messages instead. This alternative reduces configuration complexity because each machine can be configured to send or receive broadcast messages. However, the accuracy of timekeeping is marginally reduced because the information flow is one-way only.\n\nThe time kept on a machine is a critical resource, so Cisco strongly recommends that you use the security features of NTP to avoid the accidental or malicious setting of incorrect time. Two mechanisms are available: an access list-based restriction scheme and an encrypted authentication mechanism.\n\nWhen multiple sources of time (VINES, hardware clock, manual configuration) are available, NTP is always considered to be more authoritative. NTP time overrides the time set by any other method.\n\nNTP services are disabled on all interfaces by default.\n\nFor more information about NTP, see the following sections:\n\nSNTP is a simplified, client-only version of NTP for use on Cisco 1003, Cisco 1004, Cisco 1005, Cisco 1600, Cisco 1720, and Cisco 1750 routers. SNTP can receive only the time from NTP servers; it cannot be used to provide time services to other systems.\n\nSNTP typically provides time within 100 milliseconds of the accurate time, but it does not provide the complex filtering and statistical mechanisms of NTP. In addition, SNTP does not authenticate traffic, although you can configure extended access lists to provide some protection. An SNTP client is more vulnerable to misbehaving servers than an NTP client and should be used only in situations where strong authentication is not required.\n\nYou can configure SNTP to request and accept packets from configured servers or to accept NTP broadcast packets from any source. When multiple sources are sending NTP packets, the server with the best stratum is selected. (See the “Network Time Protocol” section for a description of strata.) If multiple servers are at the same stratum, a configured server is preferred over a broadcast server. If multiple servers pass both tests, the first one to send a time packet is selected. SNTP will choose a new server only if it stops receiving packets from the currently selected server, or if a better server (according to the criteria described) is discovered.\n\nSome routers contain a battery-powered hardware clock that tracks the date and time across system restarts and power outages. The hardware clock is always used to initialize the software clock when the system is restarted.\n\nNote\n\nWithin the CLI command syntax, the hardware clock is referred to as the system calendar.\n\nIf no other source is available, the hardware clock can be considered to be an authoritative source of time and be redistributed via NTP or VINES Time Service. If NTP is running, the hardware clock can be updated periodically from NTP, compensating for the inherent drift in the hardware clock.\n\nYou can configure a hardware clock (system calendar) on any device to be periodically updated from the software clock. This is advisable for any device using NTP, because the time and date on the software clock (set using NTP) will be more accurate than the hardware clock, because the time setting on the hardware clock has the potential to drift slightly over time.\n\nUse the ntp update-calendar command in global configuration mode if a routing device is synchronized to an outside time source via NTP and you want the hardware clock to be synchronized to NTP time."
