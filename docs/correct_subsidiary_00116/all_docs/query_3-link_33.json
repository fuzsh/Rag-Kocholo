        "text": "Prerequisite – Protocols in Application Layer\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol that helps the computers clock times to be synchronized in a network. This protocol is an application protocol that is responsible for the synchronization of hosts on a TCP/IP network. NTP was developed by David Mills in 1981 at the University of Delaware. This is required in a communication mechanism so that a seamless connection is present between the computers.\n\nFeatures of NTP :\n\nSome features of NTP are –\n\nNTP servers have access to highly precise atomic clocks and GPU clocks\n\nIt uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to synchronize CPU clock time.\n\nAvoids even having a fraction of vulnerabilities in information exchange communication.\n\nProvides consistent timekeeping for file servers\n\nWorking of NTP :\n\nNTP is a protocol that works over the application layer, it uses a hierarchical system of time resources and provides synchronization within the stratum servers. First, at the topmost level, there is highly accurate time resources’ ex. atomic or GPS clocks. These clock resources are called stratum 0 servers, and they are linked to the below NTP server called Stratum 1,2 or 3 and so on. These servers then provide the accurate date and time so that communicating hosts are synced to each other.\n\nArchitecture of Network Time Protocol :\n\nApplications of NTP :\n\nUsed in a production system where the live sound is recorded.\n\nUsed in the development of Broadcasting infrastructures.\n\nUsed where file system updates needed to be carried out across multiple computers depending on synchronized clock times.\n\nUsed to implement security mechanism which depend on consistent time keeping over the network.\n\nUsed in network acceleration systems which rely on timestamp accuracy to calculate performance.\n\nAdvantages of NTP :\n\nIt provides internet synchronization between the devices.\n\nIt provides enhanced security within the premises.\n\nIt is used in the authentication systems like Kerberos.\n\nIt provides network acceleration which helps in troubleshooting problems.\n\nUsed in file systems that are difficult in network synchronization.\n\nDisadvantages of NTP :\n\nWhen the servers are down the sync time is affected across a running communication.\n\nServers are prone to error due to various time zones and conflict may occur.\n\nMinimal reduction of time accuracy.\n\nWhen NTP packets are increased synchronization is conflicted.\n\nManipulation can be done in synchronization."
