You can implement of course addtional policeis to get from port 2/3/4 to the port 1 by ntp but it would not work. The reason is behind the config which means a ntp request on a FortiGate would be ONLY ANSWERED coming from the segment going to the interface of the segment and if there a ntp server (configured as ntp listener) is listening it will be answered. This means if you like to have for each segement on a FGT port1/2/3/4 a ntp server you have to configure for the ntp server a listener for each segment like:\n\nconfig system ntp set ntpsync enable set type custom set syncinterval 360 set server-mode enable set interface \"port1 port2 port3 port4\" config ntpserver edit 1 set server \"ch.pool.ntp.org\" next end end\n\nI tried also from a FMG perspective to configure based on a global policy to reach from port4 --> port1 but as you mentioned the ntp request is reaching the port1 but never got back something.\n\nthis is my view how it works\n\nkind regards\n\nAndrea"
