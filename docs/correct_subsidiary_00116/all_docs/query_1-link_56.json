        "text": "The primary source for time data on your system is the software clock. This clock runs from the moment the system starts up and keeps track of the current date and time. The software clock can be set from a number of sources and in turn can be used to distribute the current time through various mechanisms to other systems. When a device with a hardware clock is initialized or rebooted, the software clock is initially set based on the time in the hardware clock. The software clock can then be updated from the following sources:\n\nManual configuration (using the hardware clock)\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP)\n\nSimple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)\n\nVirtual Integrated Network Service (VINES) Time Service\n\nBecause the software clock can be dynamically updated, it has the potential to be more accurate than the hardware clock.\n\nThe software clock can provide time to the following services:\n\nAccess lists\n\nLogging and debugging messages\n\nNTP\n\nThe hardware clock\n\nUser show commands\n\nVINES Time Service\n\nNote\n\nThe software clock cannot provide time to the NTP or VINES Time Service if the clock was set using SNTP.\n\nThe software clock keeps track of time internally based on the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). You can configure information about the local time zone and summer time (daylight saving time) so that time is displayed correctly relative to the local time zone.\n\nThe software clock keeps track of whether the time is authoritative (that is, whether it has been set by a time source considered to be authoritative). If it is not authoritative, the time will be available only for display purposes and will not be redistributed.\n\nNetwork Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol designed to time-synchronize a network of machines. NTP runs on UDP, which in turn runs on IP. NTP Version 3 (NTPv3) is documented in RFC 1305.\n\nAn NTP network usually gets its time from an authoritative time source such as a radio clock or an atomic clock attached to a time server. NTP then distributes this time across the network. NTP is extremely efficient; no more than one packet per minute is necessary to synchronize two machines to the accuracy of within a millisecond of one another.\n\nNTP uses the concept of a stratum to describe how many NTP hops away a machine is from an authoritative time source. A stratum 1 time server typically has an authoritative time source (such as a radio or atomic clock or a Global Positioning System [GPS] time source) directly attached, a stratum 2 time server receives its time via NTP from a stratum 1 time server, and so on.\n\nNTP has two ways to avoid synchronizing to a machine whose time may not be accurate. NTP does not synchronize to a machine that is not in turn synchronized with the NTP. NTP compares the time reported by several machines and does not synchronize to a machine whose time is significantly different from others, even if its stratum is lower. This strategy effectively builds a self-organizing tree of NTP servers.\n\nOur implementation of NTP does not support stratum 1 service; that is, you cannot connect to a radio or atomic clock (for some specific platforms, however, you can connect to a GPS time-source device). We recommend that the time service you derive for your network from the public NTP servers that are available in the IP Internet.\n\nIf the network is isolated from the Internet, our implementation of NTP allows a machine to be configured so that it acts as though it is synchronized via NTP, when in fact the network has determined the time by using other means. Other machines can then synchronize to that machine via NTP.\n\nA number of manufacturers include NTP software for their host systems and a publicly available version for systems running UNIX. This software also allows UNIX-derivative servers to acquire the time directly from an atomic clock, which would subsequently propagate time information along to Cisco devices.\n\nThe communication between machines running NTP (known as associations) are usually statically configured; each machine is given the IP address of all machines with which it should form associations. Accurate timekeeping is made possible through exchange of NTP messages between each pair of machines with an association.\n\nHowever, in a LAN environment, NTP can be configured to use IP broadcast messages instead. This alternative reduces configuration complexity because each machine can be configured to send or receive broadcast messages. However, the accuracy of timekeeping is marginally reduced because the information flow is only one way.\n\nThe time kept on a machine is a critical resource, so we strongly recommend that you use the security features of NTP to avoid the accidental or malicious setting of incorrect time. Two security mechanisms are available: an access-list-based restriction scheme and an encrypted authentication mechanism.\n\nWhen multiple sources of time (VINES, hardware clock, manual configuration) are available, NTP is always considered to be more authoritative. NTP time overrides the time set by any other method.\n\nNTP services are disabled on all interfaces by default.\n\nFor more information about NTP, see the following sections:\n\nPoll-Based NTP Associations\n\nNetworking devices running NTP can be configured to operate in variety of association modes when synchronizing time with reference time sources. A networking device can obtain time information on a network in two ways--by polling host servers and by listening to NTP broadcasts. This section focuses on the poll-based association modes. Broadcast-based NTP associations are discussed in the Broadcast-Based NTP Associations section.\n\nThe following are the two most commonly used poll-based association modes:\n\nClient mode\n\nSymmetric active mode\n\nThe client and the symmetric active modes should be used when NTP is required to provide a high level of time accuracy and reliability.\n\nWhen a networking device is operating in the client mode, it polls its assigned time-serving hosts for the current time. The networking device will then pick a host from among all the polled time servers to synchronize with. Because the relationship that is established in this case is a client-host relationship, the host will not capture or use any time information sent by the local client device. This mode is most suited for file-server and workstation clients that are not required to provide any form of time synchronization to other local clients. Use the ntp server command to individually specify the time server that you want your networking device to consider synchronizing with and to set your networking device to operate in the client mode.\n\nWhen a networking device is operating in the symmetric active mode, it polls its assigned time-serving hosts for the current time and it responds to polls by its hosts. Because this is a peer-to-peer relationship, the host will also retain time-related information of the local networking device that it is communicating with. This mode should be used when a number of mutually redundant servers are interconnected via diverse network paths. Most stratum 1 and stratum 2 servers on the Internet adopt this form of network setup. Use the ntp peer command to individually specify the time serving hosts that you want your networking device to consider synchronizing with and to set your networking device to operate in the symmetric active mode.\n\nThe specific mode that you should set for each of your networking devices depends primarily on the role that you want them to assume as a timekeeping device (server or client) and the device's proximity to a stratum 1 timekeeping server.\n\nA networking device engages in polling when it is operating as a client or a host in the client mode or when it is acting as a peer in the symmetric active mode. Although polling does not usually place a burden on memory and CPU resources such as bandwidth, an exceedingly large number of ongoing and simultaneous polls on a system can seriously impact the performance of a system or slow the performance of a given network. To avoid having an excessive number of ongoing polls on a network, you should limit the number of direct, peer-to-peer or client-to-server associations. Instead, you should consider using NTP broadcasts to propagate time information within a localized network.\n\nSimple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) is a simplified, client-only version of NTP. SNTP can receive only the time from NTP servers; it cannot be used to provide time services to other systems.\n\nSNTP typically provides time within 100 milliseconds of the accurate time, but it does not provide the complex filtering and statistical mechanisms of NTP. In addition, SNTP does not authenticate traffic, although you can configure extended access lists to provide some protection. An SNTP client is more vulnerable to servers that have unexpected behavior than an NTP client, and should be used only in situations where strong authentication is not required.\n\nYou can configure SNTP to request and accept packets from configured servers or to accept NTP broadcast packets from any source. When multiple sources are sending NTP packets, the server with the best stratum is selected. (See the Network Time Protocol section on page 3 for a description of strata.) If multiple servers are at the same stratum, a configured server is preferred over a broadcast server. If multiple servers pass both tests, the first one to send a time packet is selected. SNTP will choose a new server only if it stops receiving packets from the currently selected server, or if a better server (according to the criteria described) is discovered.\n\nSome devices contain a battery-powered hardware clock that tracks the date and time across system restarts and power outages. The hardware clock is always used to initialize the software clock when the system is restarted.\n\nNote\n\nWithin the CLI command syntax, the hardware clock is referred to as the system calendar.\n\nIf no other source is available, the hardware clock can be considered as an authoritative source of time and be redistributed via NTP. If NTP is running, the hardware clock can be updated periodically from NTP, compensating for the inherent drift, which is the consistent gain or loss of time at a certain rate if the hardware clock is left to run.\n\nYou can configure a hardware clock (system calendar) on any device to be periodically updated from the software clock. We recommend that you use this configuration for any device using NTP, because the time and date on the software clock (set using NTP) will be more accurate than the hardware clock, because the time setting on the hardware clock has the potential to drift slightly over time.\n\nUse the ntp update-calendar command in global configuration mode if a routing device is synchronized to an outside time source via NTP and you want the hardware clock to be synchronized to NTP time."
