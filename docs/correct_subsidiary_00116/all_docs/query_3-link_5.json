        "text": "Hi,\n\nThe network device will choose the NTP server that provides the best time even if the server has higher stratum than the other servers. This will also apply if the servers are the same stratum, the network device chooses the one that provides the best time. You could have a scenario where a stratum 2 source provides better time than a stratum 1 sources. Assuming your lan has a stratum 1 appliance and a stratum 2 server and you configure your client to use the stratum 2 server and a stratum 1 server out on the Internet, in this case, the client might choose the stratum 2 server over the stratum 1 server out on the Internet. The stratum 2 server on your network provides less latency and jitter than the startum 1 server out on the Internet. NTP considers a range of factors and not just stratum when selecting a source.\n\nThanks\n\nJohn\n\n**Please rate posts you find helpful**\n\nExcellent, thanks.\n\nI just wanted to make sure that a network device wouldn't view the list as rigidly hierarchical, moving to the next entry on the list, no matter if any of the sources in the list were providing more trustworthy time.\n\nWhen viewing the output of \"show ntp association\" or \"show ntp status\", can you point out which criteria the device is using to decide which source is more trustworthy?\n\nI would post my output for you to examine, but it's a closed system and I'm not allowed to share.\n\nThe Cisco network device does not treat the list strictly hierarchically. If a device has several sources configured from which it can learn ntp time then the device evaluates the multiple sources. If several sources are in close agreement about the time and another device is reporting a different ntp time then that device is considered not trustworthy and would not be used. If there are several sources in close agreement about the time then the network device considers several factors as it chooses which source it will use to establish ntp sync. These factors include what stratum, how much latency in involved in reaching the source, and the variability of the time reported by the source.\n\nI understand that your organizational policy does not allow you to share your output. I hope that we have been able to answer your questions without considering that output.\n\nHTH\n\nRick\n\nHTH\n\nRick\n\nHi,\n\nThe \"show ntp association detail\" command should give you an idea on why a particular server has been selected.\n\nHave a look at the following values: the peer being used and the stratum of that peer, ref ID, poll interval(most stable NTP environment will have poll interval 1024), delay, dispersion, reach (most stable ntp environments will have 377 reach), precision.\n\nBelow is an example from cisco documentation.
