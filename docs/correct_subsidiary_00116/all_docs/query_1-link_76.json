        "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nWe've got some IR829 devices, when I run show ntp assoc I get the following output\n\naddress ref clock st when poll reach delay offset disp\n\n*~10.X .CDMA. 1 252 1024 377 175.11 17.798 0.093\n\n~10.X .STEP. 16 - 1024 0 0.000 0.000 15937.\n\nI've not used NTP on cisco devices before, so excuse my ignorance. What I don't know is what ref clock means. .CDMA I assume means it's getting it's time from a CDMA device? If that's the case, with the impending EOL of CDMA, the time will likely start to drift after EOL. Since we don't want that, I should be able to just point it to a new NTP device? with a command like\n\nntp server 10.X.Y.Z\n\nThen remove the old NTP server with\n\nno ntp server 10.X\n\nIs it really as simple as that? This is a mission critical production system with no test environment (Yes I know) so I'm not excited at the prospect of just jumping the gun and possibly causing issues.\n\nOne thing I think is interesting here is you active ntp is stratum 1. Everytime you add a clock source with higher stratum value the time difference increases for e.g Timestamps generated by an Stratum 1 Time Server will typically have 10 microseconds accuracy to UTC. A stratum-2 server will have anywhere from 1/2 to 100 ms accuracy to UTC and each subsequent stratum layer (stratum-3, etc.) will add an additional 1/2-100 ms of inaccuracy.\n\nso whatever server you add .. try to keep is same stratum level as the current one. I donâ€™t know how sensitivity your application is to microsecond time difference.\n\nAlso end of life just means that Cisco will not sell that product any more, you can not buy a new end of life products, but after end of life date you have 5 years until end of support.\n\nas mentioned earlier the commands are correct.\n\n-hope this helps-"
