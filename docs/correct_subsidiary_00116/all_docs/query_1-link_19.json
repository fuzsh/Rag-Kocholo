But I am not optimistic that this will solve your issue. It looks to me like there is something that is interferring with the operation of ntp and that we need to figure out what that is to solve your issue.\n\nThe part of the config that you posted is quite simple and looks like it should work. The clock timezone and clock summer-time do not have anything to do with the operation of ntp and only affect how time is shown on the local device. So my first question is to verify that there are no other commands in the config that have to do with ntp?\n\nAssuming that there is only the single command of ntp server then we need to figure out why your switch is not learning time from the server. I will accept your statement that the server is running correctly and is generating the correct time. I would ask if there is anything configured in the server that would impact its communication with the switches? This could be things like configuring authentication on the server, or any restrictive list of clients, or perhaps issues of ntp version between the server and the switches?\n\nMy next question is whether there is any device between your switch and the server (perhaps a firewall or something doing address translation, or doing some kind of packet filtering) that could impact the communication from switch to server?\n\nMy next question is whether there is any access list on the switch filtering traffic that could impact the ntp communication?\n\nPerhaps it would be useful if you would post the output of show ntp association detail from the first switch.\n\nHTH\n\nRick\n\nHTH\n\nRick\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the reader's understanding that there's no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose.

You might want to verify your Windows server is truly operating as a full NTP server.\n\nAlan\n\nYes I believe that this does help. It does show clearly that your switch is receiving an ntp packet from the server. So this eliminates issues of IP connectivity or of packet filtering as sources of the problem.\n\nIt is pretty clear that your switch is receiving ntp packet from the server but for some reason your switch does not accept the ntp from the server - the message NTP: no select intersection seems to be an indication that the switch is not accepting the ntp from the server. But it does not give us a clear indication of what the problem is. The messages seem to indicate that both are running ntp version 3, that the switch is operating in client mode, and the server is operating in server mode, which is expected.\n\nI wonder if one of the other ntp debugs (perhaps debut ntp event or as a last resort debug ntp all) might show the problem.\n\nHTH\n\nRick\n\nHTH\n\nRick"
