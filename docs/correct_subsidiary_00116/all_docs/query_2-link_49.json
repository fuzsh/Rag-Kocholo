        "text": "4.1. Provenance and Documents\n\nWith an active portfolio of nearly 1,300 standards and projects under development, IEEE is a leading developer of industry standards in a broad range of technologies that drive the functionality, capabilities, and interoperability of products and services, transforming how people live, work, and communicate.¶\n\nThe IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (SC) develops and maintains networking standards and recommended practices for local, metropolitan, and other area networks, using an open and accredited process, and advocates them on a global basis. The most widely used standards are for Ethernet, Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs Wireless LAN, Wireless PAN, Wireless MAN, Wireless Coexistence, Media Independent Handover Services, and Wireless RAN. An individual Working Group provides the focus for each area. Standards produced by the IEEE 802 SC are freely available from the IEEE GET Program after they have been published in PDF for six months.¶\n\nThe IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) standards define the underlying MAC and PHY layers for the Wi-Fi technology. Wi-Fi/802.11 is one of the most successful wireless technologies, supporting many application domains. While previous 802.11 generations, such as 802.11n and 802.11ac, have focused mainly on improving peak throughput, more recent generations are also considering other performance vectors, such as efficiency enhancements for dense environments in 802.11ax, throughput, latency, and reliability enhancements in P802.11be.¶\n\nIEEE Std 802.11-2012 introduced support for TSN time synchronization based on IEEE 802.1AS over 802.11 Timing Measurement protocol. IEEE Std 802.11-2016 extended the 802.1AS operation over 802.11 Fine Timing Measurement (FTM), as well as the Stream Reservation Protocol (IEEE 802.1Qat). 802.11 WLANs can also be part of a 802.1Q bridged networks with enhancements enabled by the 802.11ak amendment now retrofitted in IEEE Std 802.11-2020. Traffic classification based on 802.1Q VLAN tags is also supported in 802.11. Other 802.1 TSN capabilities such as 802.1Qbv and 802.1CB, which are media agnostic, can already operate over 802.11. The IEEE Std 802.11ax-2021 adds new scheduling capabilities that can enhance the timeliness performance in the 802.11 MAC and achieve lower bounded latency. The IEEE 802.11be is undergoing efforts to enhance the support for 802.1 TSN capabilities especially related to worst-case latency, reliability and availability.¶\n\nThe IEEE 802.11 working group has been working in collaboration with the IEEE 802.1 working group for several years extending some 802.1 features over 802.11. As with any wireless media, 802.11 imposes new constraints and restrictions to TSN-grade QoS, and tradeoffs between latency and reliability guarantees must be considered as well as managed deployment requirements. An overview of 802.1 TSN capabilities and challenges for their extensions to 802.11 are discussed in [Cavalcanti_2019].¶\n\nWi-Fi Alliance (WFA) is the worldwide network of companies that drives global Wi-Fi adoption and evolution through thought leadership, spectrum advocacy, and industry-wide collaboration. The WFA work helps ensure that Wi-Fi devices and networks provide users the interoperability, security, and reliability they have come to expect.¶\n\nAvnu Alliance is also a global industry forum developing interoperability testing for TSN capable devices across multiple media including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and 5G.¶\n\nThe following [IEEE Std 802.11] specifications/certifications are relevant in the context of reliable and available wireless services and support for time-sensitive networking capabilities:¶\n\nTime Synchronization:\n\nIEEE802.11-2016 with IEEE802.1AS; WFA TimeSync Certification.¶\n\nCongestion Control:\n\nIEEE Std 802.11-2016 Admission Control; WFA Admission Control.¶\n\nSecurity:\n\nWFA Wi-Fi Protected Access, WPA2 and WPA3.¶\n\nInteroperating with IEEE802.1Q bridges:\n\nIEEE Std 802.11-2020 incorporating 802.11ak.¶\n\nStream Reservation Protocol (part of [IEEE Std 802.1Qat]):\n\nAIEEE802.11-2016¶\n\nScheduled channel access:\n\nIEEE802.11ad Enhancements for very high throughput in the 60 GHz band [IEEE Std 802.11ad].¶\n\n802.11 Real-Time Applications:\n\nTopic Interest Group (TIG) ReportDoc [IEEE_doc_11-18-2009-06].¶\n\nIn addition, major amendments being developed by the IEEE802.11 Working Group include capabilities that can be used as the basis for providing more reliable and predictable wireless connectivity and support time-sensitive applications:¶\n\nIEEE 802.11ax D4.0: Enhancements for High Efficiency (HE).\n\n[IEEE Std 802.11ax]¶\n\nIEEE 802.11be Extreme High Throughput (EHT).\n\n[IEEE 802.11be WIP]¶\n\nIEE 802.11ay Enhanced throughput for operation in license-exempt bands above 45 GHz.\n\n[IEEE Std 802.11ay]¶\n\nThe main 802.11ax, 802.11be, 802.11ad, and 802.11ay capabilities and their relevance to RAW are discussed in the remainder of this section.¶\n\n5.1. Provenance and Documents\n\nThe IEEE802.15.4 Task Group has been driving the development of low-power low-cost radio technology. The IEEE802.15.4 physical layer has been designed to support demanding low-power scenarios targeting the use of unlicensed bands, both the 2.4 GHz and sub GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands. This has imposed requirements in terms of frame size, data rate and bandwidth to achieve reduced collision probability, reduced packet error rate, and acceptable range with limited transmission power. The PHY layer supports frames of up to 127 bytes. The Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer overhead is in the order of 10-20 bytes, leaving about 100 bytes to the upper layers. IEEE802.15.4 uses spread spectrum modulation such as the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS).¶\n\nThe Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode was added to the 2015 revision of the IEEE802.15.4 standard [IEEE Std 802.15.4]. TSCH is targeted at the embedded and industrial world, where reliability, energy consumption and cost drive the application space.¶\n\nTime sensitive networking on low power constrained wireless networks, building on IEEE802.15.4, have been partially addressed by ISA100.11a [ISA100.11a] and WirelessHART [WirelessHART]. Both technologies involve a central controller that computes redundant paths for industrial process control traffic over a TSCH mesh. Moreover, ISA100.11a introduces IPv6 capabilities with a Link-Local Address for the join process and a global unicast addres for later exchanges, but the IPv6 traffic typically ends at a local application gateway and the full power of IPv6 for end-to-end communication is not enabled.¶\n\nAt the IETF, the 6TiSCH Working Group (WG) [TiSCH] deals with best effort operation of IPv6 [RFC8200] over TSCH. 6TiSCH has enabled distributed scheduling to exploit the deterministic access capabilities provided by TSCH. The group designed the essential mechanisms to enable the management plane operation while ensuring IPv6 is supported.¶\n\n6TiSCH defines the 6top layer, composed of one or more Scheduling Functions (SFs) and the 6top Protocol (6P Protocol) defined in RFC8480 [RFC8480]. The 6P Protocol provides a pairwise negotiation mechanism to the control plane operation. The protocol supports agreement on a schedule between neighbors, enabling distributed scheduling. 6P goes hand-in-hand with a Scheduling Function (SF), the policy that decides how to maintain cells and trigger 6P transactions. The Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF) [RFC9033] is the default SF defined by the 6TiSCH WG. With these mechanisms 6TiSCH can establish layer 2 links between neighbouring nodes and support best effort traffic. RPL [RFC8480] provides the routing structure, enabling the 6TiSCH devices to establish the links with well connected neighbours and thus forming the acyclic network graphs.¶\n\nA Track at 6TiSCH is the application to wireless of the concept of a path in the \"Detnet architecture\" [RFC8655]. A Track can follow a simple sequence of relay nodes or can be structured as a more complex Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) to a unicast destination. Along a Track, 6TiSCH nodes reserve the resources to enable the efficient transmission of packets while aiming to optimize certain properties such as reliability and ensure small jitter or bounded latency. The Track structure enables Layer-2 forwarding schemes, reducing the overhead of taking routing decisions at the Layer-3.¶\n\nThe 6TiSCH architecture [RFC9030] identifies different models to schedule resources along so-called Tracks (see Section 5.2.1.1) exploiting the TSCH schedule structure however the focus at 6TiSCH is on best effort traffic and the group was never chartered to produce standard work related to Tracks.¶\n\nThere are several works that can be used to complement the overview provided in this document. For example [vilajosana21] provides a detailed description of the 6TiSCH protocols, how they are linked together and how they are integrated to other standards like RPL and 6Lo. [morell13] introduces how label switching can be implemented in a TSCH network. It proposes a policy to distribute labels in multihop network so as to enable differential services through the network paths. [dearmas16] presents an approach to improve network reliability at layer 3, considering and IEEE802.15.4 TSCH network and exploiting packet replication and path diversity for that aim.¶\n\n6.2. General Characteristics\n\nThe 5G Radio Access Network (5G RAN) with its NR interface includes several features to achieve Quality of Service (QoS), such as a guaranteeably low latency or tolerable packet error rates for selected data flows. Determinism is achieved by centralized admission control and scheduling of the wireless frequency resources, which are typically licensed frequency bands assigned to a network operator.¶\n\nNR enables short transmission slots in a radio subframe, which benefits low-latency applications. NR also introduces mini-slots, where prioritized transmissions can be started without waiting for slot boundaries, further reducing latency. As part of giving priority and faster radio access to URLLC traffic, NR introduces preemption where URLLC data transmission can preempt ongoing non-URLLC transmissions. Additionally, NR applies very fast processing, enabling retransmissions even within short latency bounds.¶\n\nNR defines extra-robust transmission modes for increased reliability both for data and control radio channels. Reliability is further improved by various techniques, such as multi-antenna transmission, the use of multiple frequency carriers in parallel and packet duplication over independent radio links. NR also provides full mobility support, which is an important reliability aspect not only for devices that are moving, but also for devices located in a changing environment.¶\n\nNetwork slicing is seen as one of the key features for 5G, allowing vertical industries to take advantage of 5G networks and services. Network slicing is about transforming a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) from a single network to a network where logical partitions are created, with appropriate network isolation, resources, optimized topology and specific configuration to serve various service requirements. An operator can configure and manage the mobile network to support various types of services enabled by 5G, for example eMBB and URLLC, depending on the different customers’ needs.¶\n\nExposure of capabilities of 5G Systems to the network or applications outside the 3GPP domain have been added to Release 16 [TS23501]. Via exposure interfaces, applications can access 5G capabilities, e.g., communication service monitoring and network maintenance.¶\n\nFor several generations of mobile networks, 3GPP has considered how the communication system should work on a global scale with billions of users, taking into account resilience aspects, privacy regulation, protection of data, encryption, access and core network security, as well as interconnect. Security requirements evolve as demands on trustworthiness increase. For example, this has led to the introduction of enhanced privacy protection features in 5G. 5G also employs strong security algorithms, encryption of traffic, protection of signaling and protection of interfaces.¶\n\nOne particular strength of mobile networks is the authentication, based on well-proven algorithms and tightly coupled with a global identity management infrastructure. Since 3G, there is also mutual authentication, allowing the network to authenticate the device and the device to authenticate the network. Another strength is secure solutions for storage and distribution of keys fulfilling regulatory requirements and allowing international roaming. When connecting to 5G, the user meets the entire communication system, where security is the result of standardization, product security, deployment, operations and management as well as incident handling capabilities. The mobile networks approach the entirety in a rather coordinated fashion which is beneficial for security.¶\n\n6.3. Deployment and Spectrum\n\nThe 5G system allows deployment in a vast spectrum range, addressing use-cases in both wide-area as well as local networks. Furthermore, 5G can be configured for public and non-public access.¶\n\nWhen it comes to spectrum, NR allows combining the merits of many frequency bands, such as the high bandwidths in millimeter Waves (mmW) for extreme capacity locally, as well as the broad coverage when using mid- and low frequency bands to address wide-area scenarios. URLLC is achievable in all these bands. Spectrum can be either licensed, which means that the license holder is the only authorized user of that spectrum range, or unlicensed, which means that anyone who wants to use the spectrum can do so.¶\n\nA prerequisite for critical communication is performance predictability, which can be achieved by the full control of the access to the spectrum, which 5G provides. Licensed spectrum guarantees control over spectrum usage by the system, making it a preferable option for critical communication. However, unlicensed spectrum can provide an additional resource for scaling non-critical communications. While NR is initially developed for usage of licensed spectrum, the functionality to access also unlicensed spectrum was introduced in 3GPP Release 16. Moreover, URLLC features are enhanced in Release 17 [RP210854] to be better applicable to unlicensed spectrum.¶\n\nLicensed spectrum dedicated to mobile communications has been allocated to mobile service providers, i.e. issued as longer-term licenses by national administrations around the world. These licenses have often been associated with coverage requirements and issued across whole countries, or in large regions. Besides this, configured as a non-public network (NPN) deployment, 5G can provide network services also to a non-operator defined organization and its premises such as a factory deployment. By this isolation, quality of service requirements, as well as security requirements can be achieved. An integration with a public network, if required, is also possible. The non-public (local) network can thus be interconnected with a public network, allowing devices to roam between the networks.¶\n\nIn an alternative model, some countries are now in the process of allocating parts of the 5G spectrum for local use to industries. These non-service providers then have a choice of applying for a local license themselves and operating their own network or cooperating with a public network operator or service provider.¶\n\n6.4. Applicability to Deterministic Flows\n\n6.4.1. System Architecture\n\nThe 5G system [TS23501] consists of the User Equipment (UE) at the terminal side, and the Radio Access Network (RAN) with the gNB as radio base station node, as well as the Core Network (CN), which is connected to the external Data Network (DN). The core network is based on a service-based architecture with the central functions: Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF) and User Plane Function (UPF) as illustrated in Figure 6. \"(Note that this document only explains key functions, however, Figure 6 provides a more detailed view.)\"¶\n\nThe gNB’s main responsibility is the radio resource management, including admission control and scheduling, mobility control and radio measurement handling. The AMF handles the UE’s connection status and security, while the SMF controls the UE’s data sessions. The UPF handles the user plane traffic.¶\n\nThe SMF can instantiate various Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions for the UE, each associated with a set of QoS flows, i.e., with different QoS profiles. Segregation of those sessions is also possible, e.g., resource isolation in the RAN and in the CN can be defined (slicing).¶\n\nTo allow UE mobility across cells/gNBs, handover mechanisms are supported in NR. For an established connection, i.e., connected mode mobility, a gNB can configure a UE to report measurements of received signal strength and quality of its own and neighbouring cells, periodically or event-based. Based on these measurement reports, the gNB decides to handover a UE to another target cell/gNB. Before triggering the handover, it is hand-shaked with the target gNB based on network signalling. A handover command is then sent to the UE and the UE switches its connection to the target cell/gNB. The Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) of the UE can be configured to avoid data loss in this procedure, i.e., handle retransmissions if needed. Data forwarding is possible between source and target gNB as well. To improve the mobility performance further, i.e., to avoid connection failures, e.g., due to too-late handovers, the mechanism of conditional handover is introduced in Release 16 specifications. Therein a conditional handover command, defining a triggering point, can be sent to the UE before UE enters a handover situation. A further improvement that has been introduced in Release 16 is the Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS), where the UE maintains the connection to the source cell while connecting to the target cell. This way, potential interruptions in packet delivery can be avoided entirely.¶\n\n6.4.2. Overview of The Radio Protocol Stack\n\nThe protocol architecture for NR consists of the L1 Physical layer (PHY) and as part of the L2, the sublayers of Medium Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP), as well as the Service Data Adaption Protocol (SDAP).¶\n\nThe PHY layer handles signal processing related actions, such as encoding/decoding of data and control bits, modulation, antenna precoding and mapping.¶\n\nThe MAC sub-layer handles multiplexing and priority handling of logical channels (associated with QoS flows) to transport blocks for PHY transmission, as well as scheduling information reporting and error correction through Hybrid Automated Repeat Request (HARQ).¶\n\nThe RLC sublayer handles sequence numbering of higher layer packets, retransmissions through Automated Repeat Request (ARQ), if configured, as well as segmentation and reassembly and duplicate detection.¶\n\nThe PDCP sublayer consists of functionalities for ciphering/deciphering, integrity protection/verification, re-ordering and in-order delivery, duplication and duplicate handling for higher layer packets, and acts as the anchor protocol to support handovers.¶\n\nThe SDAP sublayer provides services to map QoS flows, as established by the 5G core network, to data radio bearers (associated with logical channels), as used in the 5G RAN.¶\n\nAdditionally, in RAN, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol, handles the access control and configuration signalling for the aforementioned protocol layers. RRC messages are considered L3 and thus transmitted also via those radio protocol layers.¶\n\nTo provide low latency and high reliability for one transmission link, i.e., to transport data (or control signaling) of one radio bearer via one carrier, several features have been introduced on the user plane protocols for PHY and L2, as explained in the following.¶\n\n6.4.3. Radio (PHY)\n\nNR is designed with native support of antenna arrays utilizing benefits from beamforming, transmissions over multiple MIMO layers and advanced receiver algorithms allowing effective interference cancellation. Those antenna techniques are the basis for high signal quality and effectiveness of spectral usage. Spatial diversity with up to 4 MIMO layers in UL and up to 8 MIMO layers in DL is supported. Together with spatial-domain multiplexing, antenna arrays can focus power in desired direction to form beams. NR supports beam management mechanisms to find the best suitable beam for UE initially and when it is moving. In addition, gNBs can coordinate their respective DL and UL transmissions over the backhaul network keeping interference reasonably low, and even make transmissions or receptions from multiple points (multi-TRP). Multi-TRP can be used for repetition of data packet in time, in frequency or over multiple MIMO layers which can improve reliability even further.¶\n\nAny downlink transmission to a UE starts from resource allocation signaling over the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). If it is successfully received, the UE will know about the scheduled transmission and may receive data over the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). If retransmission is required according to the HARQ scheme, a signaling of negative acknowledgement (NACK) on the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is involved and PDCCH together with PDSCH transmissions (possibly with additional redundancy bits) are transmitted and soft-combined with previously received bits. Otherwise, if no valid control signaling for scheduling data is received, nothing is transmitted on PUCCH (discontinuous transmission - DTX),and the base station upon detecting DTX will retransmit the initial data.¶\n\nAn uplink transmission normally starts from a Scheduling Request (SR) – a signaling message from the UE to the base station sent via PUCCH. Once the scheduler is informed about buffer data in UE, e.g., by SR, the UE transmits a data packet on the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH). Pre-scheduling not relying on SR is also possible (see following section).¶\n\nSince transmission of data packets require usage of control and data channels, there are several methods to maintain the needed reliability. NR uses Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes for data channels, Polar codes for PDCCH, as well as orthogonal sequences and Polar codes for PUCCH. For ultra-reliability of data channels, very robust (low spectral efficiency) Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) tables are introduced containing very low (down to 1/20) LDPC code rates using BPSK or QPSK. Also, PDCCH and PUCCH channels support multiple code rates including very low ones for the channel robustness.¶\n\nA connected UE reports downlink (DL) quality to gNB by sending Channel State Information (CSI) reports via PUCCH while uplink (UL) quality is measured directly at gNB. For both uplink and downlink, gNB selects the desired MCS number and signals it to the UE by Downlink Control Information (DCI) via PDCCH channel. For URLLC services, the UE can assist the gNB by advising that MCS targeting 10^-5 Block Error Rate (BLER) are used. Robust link adaptation algorithms can maintain the needed level of reliability considering a given latency bound.¶\n\nLow latency on the physical layer is provided by short transmission duration which is possible by using high Subcarrier Spacing (SCS) and the allocation of only one or a few Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols. For example, the shortest latency for the worst case in DL can be 0.23ms and in UL can be 0.24ms according to (section 5.7.1 in [TR37910]). Moreover, if the initial transmission has failed, HARQ feedback can quickly be provided and an HARQ retransmission is scheduled.¶\n\nDynamic multiplexing of data associated with different services is highly desirable for efficient use of system resources and to maximize system capacity. Assignment of resources for eMBB is usually done with regular (longer) transmission slots, which can lead to blocking of low latency services. To overcome the blocking, eMBB resources can be pre-empted and re-assigned to URLLC services. In this way, spectrally efficient assignments for eMBB can be ensured while providing flexibility required to ensure a bounded latency for URLLC services. In downlink, the gNB can notify the eMBB UE about pre-emption after it has happened, while in uplink there are two pre-emption mechanisms: special signaling to cancel eMBB transmission and URLLC dynamic power boost to suppress eMBB transmission.¶\n\n6.4.4. Scheduling and QoS (MAC)\n\nOne integral part of the 5G system is the Quality of Service (QoS) framework [TS23501]. QoS flows are setup by the 5G system for certain IP or Ethernet packet flows, so that packets of each flow receive the same forwarding treatment, i.e., in scheduling and admission control. QoS flows can for example be associated with different priority level, packet delay budgets and tolerable packet error rates. Since radio resources are centrally scheduled in NR, the admission control function can ensure that only those QoS flows are admitted for which QoS targets can be reached.¶\n\nNR transmissions in both UL and DL are scheduled by the gNB [TS38300]. This ensures radio resource efficiency, fairness in resource usage of the users and enables differentiated treatment of the data flows of the users according to the QoS targets of the flows. Those QoS flows are handled as data radio bearers or logical channels in NR RAN scheduling.¶\n\nThe gNB can dynamically assign DL and UL radio resources to users, indicating the resources as DL assignments or UL grants via control channel to the UE. Radio resources are defined as blocks of OFDM symbols in spectral domain and time domain. Different lengths are supported in time domain, i.e., (multiple) slot or mini-slot lengths. Resources of multiple frequency carriers can be aggregated and jointly scheduled to the UE.¶\n\nScheduling decisions are based, e.g., on channel quality measured on reference signals and reported by the UE (cf. periodical CSI reports for DL channel quality). The transmission reliability can be chosen in the scheduling algorithm, i.e., by link adaptation where an appropriate transmission format (e.g., robustness of modulation and coding scheme, controlled UL power) is selected for the radio channel condition of the UE. Retransmissions, based on HARQ feedback, are also controlled by the scheduler. The feedback transmission in HARQ loop introduces delays, but there are methods to minimize it by using short transmission formats, sub-slot feedback reporting and PUCCH carrier switching. If needed to avoid HARQ round-trip time delays, repeated transmissions can be also scheduled beforehand, to the cost of reduced spectral efficiency.¶\n\nIn dynamic DL scheduling, transmission can be initiated immediately when DL data becomes available in the gNB. However, for dynamic UL scheduling, when data becomes available but no UL resources are available yet, the UE indicates the need for UL resources to the gNB via a (single bit) scheduling request message in the UL control channel. When thereupon UL resources are scheduled to the UE, the UE can transmit its data and may include a buffer status report, indicating the exact amount of data per logical channel still left to be sent. More UL resources may be scheduled accordingly. To avoid the latency introduced in the scheduling request loop, UL radio resources can also be pre-scheduled.¶\n\nIn particular for periodical traffic patterns, the pre-scheduling can rely on the scheduling features DL Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) and UL Configured Grant (CG). With these features, periodically recurring resources can be assigned in DL and UL. Multiple parallels of those configurations are supported, in order to serve multiple parallel traffic flows of the same UE.¶\n\nTo support QoS enforcement in the case of mixed traffic with different QoS requirements, several features have recently been introduced. This way, e.g., different periodical critical QoS flows can be served together with best effort transmissions, by the same UE. Among others, these features (partly Release 16) are: 1) UL logical channel transmission restrictions allowing to map logical channels of certain QoS only to intended UL resources of a certain frequency carrier, slot-length, or CG configuration, and 2) intra-UE pre-emption and multiplexing, allowing critical UL transmissions to either pre-empt non-critical transmissions or being multiplexed with non-critical transmissions keeping different reliability targets.¶\n\nWhen multiple frequency carriers are aggregated, duplicate parallel transmissions can be employed (beside repeated transmissions on one carrier). This is possible in the Carrier Aggregation (CA) architecture where those carriers originate from the same gNB, or in the Dual Connectivity (DC) architecture where the carriers originate from different gNBs, i.e., the UE is connected to two gNBs in this case. In both cases, transmission reliability is improved by this means of providing frequency diversity.¶\n\nIn addition to licensed spectrum, a 5G system can also utilize unlicensed spectrum to offload non-critical traffic. This version of NR is called NR-U, part of 3GPP Release 16. The central scheduling approach applies also for unlicensed radio resources, but in addition also the mandatory channel access mechanisms for unlicensed spectrum, e.g., Listen Before Talk (LBT) are supported in NR-U. This way, by using NR, operators have and can control access to both licensed and unlicensed frequency resources.¶\n\n6.4.5. Time-Sensitive Communications (TSC)\n\nRecent 3GPP releases have introduced various features to support multiple aspects of Time-Sensitive Communication (TSC), which includes Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and beyond as described in this section.¶\n\nThe main objective of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is to provide guaranteed data delivery within a guaranteed time window, i.e., bounded low latency. IEEE 802.1 TSN [IEEE802.1TSN] is a set of open standards that provide features to enable deterministic communication on standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet [IEEE802.3]. TSN standards can be seen as a toolbox for traffic shaping, resource management, time synchronization, and reliability.¶\n\nA TSN stream is a data flow between one end station (Talker) to another end station (Listener). In the centralized configuration model, TSN bridges are configured by the Central Network Controller (CNC) [IEEE802.1Qcc] to provide deterministic connectivity for the TSN stream through the network. Time-based traffic shaping provided by Scheduled Traffic [IEEE802.1Qbv] may be used to achieve bounded low latency. The TSN tool for time synchronization is the generalized Precision Time Protocol (gPTP) [IEEE802.1AS]), which provides reliable time synchronization that can be used by end stations and by other TSN tools, e.g., Scheduled Traffic [IEEE802.1Qbv]. High availability, as a result of ultra-reliability, is provided for data flows by the Frame Replication and Elimination for Reliability (FRER) [IEEE802.1CB] mechanism.¶\n\n3GPP Release 16 includes integration of 5G with TSN, i.e., specifies functions for the 5G System (5GS) to deliver TSN streams such that the meet their QoS requirements. A key aspect of the integration is the 5GS appears from the rest of the network as a set of TSN bridges, in particular, one virtual bridge per User Plane Function (UPF) on the user plane. The 5GS includes TSN Translator (TT) functionality for the adaptation of the 5GS to the TSN bridged network and for hiding the 5GS internal procedures. The 5GS provides the following components:¶\n\n1.\n\ninterface to TSN controller, as per [IEEE802.1Qcc] for the fully centralized configuration model¶\n\n2.\n\ntime synchronization via reception and transmission of gPTP PDUs [IEEE802.1AS]¶\n\n3.\n\nlow latency, hence, can be integrated with Scheduled Traffic [IEEE802.1Qbv]¶\n\n4.\n\nreliability, hence, can be integrated with FRER [IEEE802.1CB]¶\n\n3GPP Release 17 [TS23501] introduced enhancements to generalize support for Time-Sensitive Communications (TSC) beyond TSN. This includes IP communications to provide time-sensitive service to, e.g., Video, Imaging and Audio for Professional Applications (VIAPA). The system model of 5G acting as a “TSN bridge” in Release 16 has been reused to enable the 5GS acting as a “TSC node” in a more generic sense (which includes TSN bridge and IP node). In the case of TSC that does not involve TSN, requirements are given via exposure interface and the control plane provides the service based on QoS and time synchronization requests from an Application Function (AF).¶\n\nFigure 7 shows an illustration of 5G-TSN integration where an industrial controller (Ind Ctrlr) is connected to industrial Input/Output devices (I/O dev) via 5G. The 5GS can directly transport Ethernet frames since Release 15, thus, end-to-end Ethernet connectivity is provided. The 5GS implements the required interfaces towards the TSN controller functions such as the CNC, thus adapts to the settings of the TSN network. A 5G user plane virtual bridge interconnects TSN bridges or connects end stations, e.g., I/O devices to the TSN network. TSN Translators (TTs), i.e., the Device-Side TSN Translator (DS-TT) at the UE and the Network-Side TSN Translator (NW-TT) at the UPF have a key role in the interconnection. Note that the introduction of 5G brings flexibility in various aspects, e.g., more flexible network topology because a wireless hop can replace several wireline hops thus significantly reduce the number of hops end-to-end. [TSN5G] dives more into the integration of 5G with TSN.¶\n\nNR supports accurate reference time synchronization in 1us accuracy level. Since NR is a scheduled system, an NR UE and a gNB are tightly synchronized to their OFDM symbol structures. A 5G internal reference time can be provided to the UE via broadcast or unicast signaling, associating a known OFDM symbol to this reference clock. The 5G internal reference time can be shared within the 5G network, i.e., radio and core network components. Release 16 has introduced interworking with gPTP for multiple time domains, where the 5GS acts as a virtual gPTP time-aware system and supports the forwarding of gPTP time synchronization information between end stations and bridges through the 5G user plane TTs. These account for the residence time of the 5GS in the time synchronization procedure. One special option is when the 5GS internal reference time is not only used within the 5GS, but also to the rest of the devices in the deployment, including connected TSN bridges and end stations. Release 17 includes further improvements, i.e., methods for propagation delay compensation in RAN, further improving the accuracy for time synchronization over-the-air, as well as the possibility for the TSN grandmaster clock to reside on the UE side. More extensions and flexibility were added to the time synchronization service making it general for TSC with additional support of other types of clocks and time distribution such as boundary clock, transparent clock peer-to-peer, transparent clock end-to-end, aside from the time-aware system used for TSN. Additionally, it is possible to use internal access stratum signaling to distribute timing (and not the usual (g)PTP messages), for which the required accuracy can be provided by the AF [TS23501]. The same time synchronization service is expected to be further extended and enhanced in Release 18 to support Timing Resiliency (according to study item [SP211634]), where the 5G system can provide a back-up or alternative timing source for the failure of the local GNSS source (or other primary timing source) used by the vertical.¶\n\nIETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is the technology to support time-sensitive communications at the IP layer. 3GPP Release 18 includes a study [TR2370046] on interworking between 5G and DetNet. Along the TSC framework introduced for Release 17, the 5GS acts as a DetNet node for the support of DetNet, see Figure 7.1-1 in [TR2370046]. The study provides details on how the 5GS is exposed by the Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) to the DetNet controller as a router on a per UPF granularity (similarly to the per UPF Virtual TSN Bridge granularity shown in Figure 11). In particular, it is listed what parameters are provided by the TSCTSF to the DetNet controller. The study also includes how the TSCTSF maps DetNet flow parameters to 5G QoS parameters. Note that TSN is the primary subnetwork technology for DetNet. Thus, the DetNet over TSN work, e.g., [RFC9023], can be leveraged via the TSN support built in 5G.¶\n\nRedundancy architectures were specified in order to provide reliability against any kind of failure on the radio link or nodes in the RAN and the core network. Redundant user plane paths can be provided based on the dual connectivity architecture, where the UE sets up two PDU sessions towards the same data network, and the 5G system makes the paths of the two PDU sessions independent as illustrated in Figure 9. There are two PDU sessions involved in the solution: the first spans from the UE via gNB1 to UPF1, acting as the first PDU session anchor, while the second spans from the UE via gNB2 to UPF2, acting as second the PDU session anchor. The independent paths may continue beyond the 3GPP network. Redundancy Handling Functions (RHFs) are deployed outside of the 5GS, i.e., in Host A (the device) and in Host B (the network). RHF can implement replication and elimination functions as per [IEEE802.1CB] or the Packet Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions (PREOF) of IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [RFC8655].¶\n\nAn alternative solution is that multiple UEs per device are used for user plane redundancy as illustrated in Figure 9. Each UE sets up a PDU session. The 5GS ensures that those PDU sessions of the different UEs are handled independently internal to the 5GS. There is no single point of failure in this solution, which also includes RHF outside of the 5G system, e.g., as per FRER or as PREOF specifications.¶\n\nNote that the abstraction provided by the RHF and the location of the RHF being outside of the 5G system make 5G equally supporting integration for reliability both with FRER of TSN and PREOF of DetNet as they both rely on the same concept.¶\n\n7.4. Applicability to Deterministic Flows\n\nAs LDACS is a ground-based digital communications system for flight guidance and communications related to safety and regularity of flight, time-bounded deterministic arrival times for safety critical messages are a key feature for its successful deployment and roll-out.¶\n\n7.4.1. System Architecture\n\nUp to 512 Aircraft Station (AS) communicate to an LDACS Ground Station (GS) in the Reverse Link (RL). GS communicate to AS in the Forward Link (FL). Via an Access-Router (AC-R) GSs connect the LDACS sub-network to the global Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) to which the corresponding Air Traffic Services (ATS) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) end systems are attached.¶\n\n7.4.2. Overview of The Radio Protocol Stack\n\nThe protocol stack of LDACS is implemented in the AS and GS: It consists of the Physical Layer (PHY) with five major functional blocks above it. Four are placed in the Data Link Layer (DLL) of the AS and GS: (1) Medium Access Layer (MAC), (2) Voice Interface (VI), (3) Data Link Service (DLS), and (4) LDACS Management Entity (LME). The last entity resides within the Sub-Network Layer: Sub-Network Protocol (SNP). The LDACS network is externally connected to voice units, radio control units, and the ATN Network Layer.¶\n\nCommunications between MAC and LME layer is split into four distinct control channels: The Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) where LDACS ground stations announce their specific LDACS cell, including physical parameters and cell identification; the Random Access Channel (RACH) where LDACS airborne radios can request access to an LDACS cell; the Common Control Channel (CCCH) where LDACS ground stations allocate resources to aircraft radios, enabling the airborne side to transmit user payload; the Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH) where LDACS airborne radios can request user data resources from the LDACS ground station so the airborne side can transmit user payload. Communications between MAC and DLS layer is handled by the Data Channel (DCH) where user payload is handled.¶\n\nFigure 10 shows the protocol stack of LDACS as implemented in the AS and GS.¶\n\n7.4.3. Radio (PHY)\n\nThe physical layer provides the means to transfer data over the radio channel. The LDACS ground-station supports bi-directional links to multiple aircraft under its control. The forward link direction (FL; ground-to-air) and the reverse link direction (RL; air-to-ground) are separated by frequency division duplex. Forward link and reverse link use a 500 kHz channel each. The ground-station transmits a continuous stream of OFDM symbols on the forward link. In the reverse link different aircraft are separated in time and frequency using a combination of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple-Access (OFDMA) and Time-Division Multiple-Access (TDMA). Aircraft thus transmit discontinuously on the reverse link with radio bursts sent in precisely defined transmission opportunities allocated by the ground-station. The most important service on the PHY layer of LDACS is the PHY time framing service, which indicates that the PHY layer is ready to transmit in a given slot and to indicate PHY layer framing and timing to the MAC time framing service. LDACS does not support beam-forming or Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO).¶\n\n7.4.4. Scheduling, Frame Structure and QoS (MAC)\n\nThe data-link layer provides the necessary protocols to facilitate concurrent and reliable data transfer for multiple users. The LDACS data link layer is organized in two sub-layers: The medium access sub-layer and the logical link control sub-layer. The medium access sub-layer manages the organization of transmission opportunities in slots of time and frequency. The logical link control sub-layer provides acknowledged point-to-point logical channels between the aircraft and the ground-station using an automatic repeat request protocol. LDACS supports also unacknowledged point-to-point channels and ground-to-air broadcast. Before going more into depth about the LDACS medium access, the frame structure of LDACS is introduced:¶\n\nThe LDACS framing structure for FL and RL is based on Super-Frames (SF) of 240 ms duration. Each SF corresponds to 2000 OFDM symbols. The FL and RL SF boundaries are aligned in time (from the view of the GS).¶\n\nIn the FL, an SF contains a Broadcast Frame of duration 6.72 ms (56 OFDM symbols) for the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), and four Multi-Frames (MF), each of duration 58.32 ms (486 OFDM symbols).¶\n\nIn the RL, each SF starts with a Random Access (RA) slot of length 6.72 ms with two opportunities for sending RL random access frames for the Random Access Channel (RACH), followed by four MFs. These MFs have the same fixed duration of 58.32 ms as in the FL, but a different internal structure¶\n\nFigure 11 and Figure 12 illustrate the LDACS frame structure.¶\n\nThis fixed frame structure allows for a reliable and dependable transmission of data. Next, the LDACS medium access layer is introduced:¶\n\nLDACS medium access is always under the control of the ground-station of a radio cell. Any medium access for the transmission of user data has to be requested with a resource request message stating the requested amount of resources and class of service. The ground- station performs resource scheduling on the basis of these requests and grants resources with resource allocation messages. Resource request and allocation messages are exchanged over dedicated contention-free control channels.¶\n\nLDACS has two mechanisms to request resources from the scheduler in the ground-station. Resources can either be requested \"on demand\", or permanently allocated by a LDACS ground station, with a given class of service. On the forward link, this is done locally in the ground-station, on the reverse link a dedicated contention-free control channel is used (Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH); roughly 83 bit every 60 ms). A resource allocation is always announced in the control channel of the forward link (Common Control Channel (CCCH); variable sized). Due to the spacing of the reverse link control channels of every 60 ms, a medium access delay in the same order of magnitude is to be expected.¶\n\nResources can also be requested \"permanently\". The permanent resource request mechanism supports requesting recurring resources in given time intervals. A permanent resource request has to be canceled by the user (or by the ground-station, which is always in control). User data transmissions over LDACS are therefore always scheduled by the ground-station, while control data uses statically (i.e. at net entry) allocated recurring resources (DCCH and CCCH). The current specification documents specify no scheduling algorithm. However performance evaluations so far have used strict priority scheduling and round robin for equal priorities for simplicity. In the current prototype implementations LDACS classes of service are thus realized as priorities of medium access and not as flows. Note that this can starve out low priority flows. However, this is not seen as a big problem since safety related message always go first in any case. Scheduling of reverse link resources is done in physical Protocol Data Units (PDU) of 112 bit (or larger if more aggressive coding and modulation is used). Scheduling on the forward link is done Byte-wise since the forward link is transmitted continuously by the ground-station.¶\n\nIn order to support diversity, LDACS supports handovers to other ground-stations on different channels. Handovers may be initiated by the aircraft (break-before-make) or by the ground-station (make- before-break). Beyond this, FCI diversity shall be implemented by the multi-link concept.¶"
