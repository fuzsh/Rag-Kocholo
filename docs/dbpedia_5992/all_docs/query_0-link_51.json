The findings <strong>of</strong> that report have been endorsed by the Institute. At a meeting <strong>of</strong> the <strong>Qld</strong> heritage sub-committee <strong>of</strong> 17 September 2007 (following a request from the National Heritage Committee) a number <strong>of</strong> <strong>places</strong> from the list contained in appendix 1 to the 2005 report were identified as being <strong>of</strong> <strong>national</strong> significance. The following <strong>places</strong> (also considered <strong>of</strong> <strong>national</strong> significance) were also added to the list at that meeting: RS Dods & JL Pearson - St John’s Cathedral Precinct (QHR; IS); Hall & Dods - Myendetta, Charleville (NS) and Wyambyn, Tabragalba ; Karl Langer - West’s Furniture Store, Fortitude Valley (1954) and Sugar Research Station, Mackay; JS Murdoch (Q Dept Public Works) - Mackay Customs House (1902) (QHR); RC Nowland (Q Dept Public Works) - University <strong>of</strong> <strong>Qld</strong> Medical School, Herston (1939) (QHR); Eddie Oribin - Japanese house, Cairns; Lange Powell - house for EK Brodribb, Gladstone Rd, Dutton Park (1915) and house for Geo Stronach, Eldernell Av, Hamilton (1931); <strong>Qld</strong> Dept Public Works - Anzac Square (QHR); Harry Seidler – Kooralbyn; AB Wilson - Lamb house, Kangaroo Pt (1901) (QHR). In 2010 the AIA Heritage Taskforce considered nominations from each state for residential <strong>places</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>national</strong> significance. Queensland submitted citations (in an agreed format) for 20 <strong>places</strong>: AB Wilson - Home (Lamb house), Kangaroo Pt; Hall & Dods - Myendetta, Charleville; EP Trewern - Santa Barbara, New Farm; Donoghue & Fulton - fmr Masel house, Stanthorpe; Karl Langer - fmr Langer residence, St Lucia; Hayes & Scott – Graham house, Indooroopilly; Job & Froud - Torbrek, Highgate Hill; John Dalton - Dalton house, Figtree Pocket; John Railton - Wilson house, Dickie Beach; James Birrell – Union College, University <strong>of</strong> <strong>Qld</strong>; Rex Addison - Addison house no1, Taringa; Chris Clarke - Clarke house, Ascot; Russel Hall - Carpenter Hall house, Wilston; Lindsay & Kerry Clare - Clare house, Buderim; Gabriel Poole - Poole house, Lake Weyba; Gerry Murtagh – Grant house, Sunshine Beach house; Don Watson - Campbell house, Graceville; Andresen O’Gorman - Mooloomba house, Pt Lookout; Donovan Hill - ‘C’ house, Coorparoo; Elizabeth Watson Brown & Peter Skinner - house, St Lucia. Ultimately the category was defined to not include institutional residential buildings so Union College was excluded. At this point in time, 2 <strong>Qld</strong> residential <strong>places</strong> have been included on the AIA list <strong>of</strong> <strong>national</strong>ly significant buildings – the homestead Myendetta at Charleville and the ‘C’ house.
