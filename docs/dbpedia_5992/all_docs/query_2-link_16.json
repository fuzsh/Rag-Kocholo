        "meta_description": "The present brick Uniting church at Kennedy Terrace, Paddington, was opened as a Methodist church in 1920 at a cost of £2283. It was designed by Brisbane architect, Lange Powell, son of the Reverend William Powell, who founded the Primitive Methodist Church at New Farm in the 1870s. Lange Powell was responsible for the design of several prominent Brisbane buildings including the Masonic Temple and St Martin's Hospital in Ann Street and Perry House in Elizabeth Street.\n\t\n\tBy the 1920s Paddington was densely settled and boasted two other Methodist churches on Given and Latrobe Terraces. The suburb began to experience close residential settlement when overcrowding forced residents away from what is now known as the city centre and Spring Hill in the 1880s. The first Kennedy Terrace Methodist Church was among the new churches to appear in the 1880s. Its formation followed the establishment of a Sunday School conducted by Mr William Gricks and Miss Jane Buchanan at a private home in Latrobe Terrace in 1883. As enrolments at the school grew, new accommodation was found and eventually church services were also held at the new premises. It soon became apparent that a permanent place of worship was required. With this in mind, part of the present church site at Kennedy Terrace was purchased and a small building opened in March 1884.\n\t\n\tThe extension of the electric tramlines along Enoggera Terrace to the corner of Kennedy Terrace in 1902 and further extensions later that decade served to intensify development in Paddington. By 1903, when Ithaca Shire was raised to the status of a town, its population had reached around 3000. The population consolidated further, growing to 17,500 in 1910 and exceeding 22,000 by 1923. With population growth came a need for a larger, more substantial place of worship for the expanding Kennedy Terrace congregation. To this end, plans were made for the construction of this new brick church. The foundation stone was laid by F.T. Brentnall, MLC on 6 December 1919 and the church was opened for service the following year.\n\t\n\tAs Brisbane continued to grow, adjustments were made to the boundaries of the Methodist church circuit. The Kennedy Terrace Church was part of the Albert Street Circuit until 1890 when the circuit was divided into three - Albert Street, Toowong and Enoggera - Kennedy Terrace was included in the Enoggera Circuit. In 1905 Kennedy Terrace and Paddington were joined to form the Ithaca Circuit and in 1907 were joined by the Leichhardt Street, Paddington, Latrobe Terrace, Torwood and The Gap churches. In 1908 Kennedy Terrace was separated from Paddington and grouped with Grove Estate, The Gap and Samford. The last alteration of boundaries occurred in 1924 when Kennedy Terrace became a single church circuit.\n\t\n\tOn Saturday 5 August 1933, the gates in the \"Jubilee Wall\" were opened by former Brisbane Lord Mayor, William Jolly. The wall had been erected on two sides of the church property and formed an integral part of the plans for commemorating the jubilee of the church's foundation. Tablets placed on the wall at the time honoured Mrs F.G. Harris and Mr W. Gricks, founders of the Sunday School in 1863 and two other members who had served the church for many years, Mr W.J. Abraham, who conducted the church choir for 53 years and Mr J.B Lugg. Also honoured on the wall are the Minister W. Shenton and P.W. Fulcher, organist 1906-1961.\n\t\n\tFollowing the amalgamation of Congregational, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches to form the Uniting Church in 1977, the building has continued to function as the centre of worship for the Fernberg parish.\n\t\n\tSource: Brisbane City Council Heritage Register.",
