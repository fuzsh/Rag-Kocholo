B. Wilson (1857-1938), shortly after Wilson had set up his own architectural practice in Brisbane.2 The first organist of the church, Mr W.D. Steele is said to have 'presided at an organ purchased from Albert Street Church.'3 This was obviously a reed organ. It was replaced successively by three pipe organs,4 in 1901, 1909 and 1924 respectively.\n\nFirst Organ.\n\nThe first pipe organ, built by the Positive Organ Company Ltd, London, had come from Holy Trinity Church, Mackay. It was installed at West End in 1901,5 and subsequently found its way to St Philip's Anglican Church, Annerley, where it was destroyed by fire in 1954.\n\nSecond Organ.\n\nThe second organ was a mechanical-action instrument built in 1909 by B.B.Whitehouse & Co. of Brisbane. It was opened at West End on Wednesday 31 March 1909,6 and later sold to Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Fortitude Valley, where it was installed in 1924.7 It has subsequently been rebuilt and enlarged.\n\nPresent Organ.\n\nThe present organ at this church was built by Whitehouse Bros of Brisbane,8 and was opened on Sunday 25 May 1924. It was the gift of Mr Robert J. Archibald, organist and choirmaster of the church for many years. Mr Archibald had previously been organist at the Neil-street Methodist Church, Toowoomba, around 1898. His memorial plaque at West End records that he died on 1 August 1939.\n\nAn announcement of the opening reveals that the installation of the organ involved alterations to the interior of the church to the design of the noted architect, Lange Powell:\n\nA GIFT ORGAN.\n\nA magnificent organ built by Mr Whitehouse, has been given to the West End Methodist Church by Mr R. J. Archibald, the church organist and choirmaster, and on Sunday the instrument will be opened with special services, morning and evening, by the Rev. B. Frederick and the Rev. H. H. Trigge, M.A. The whole of the choir gallery and pulpit has been built under the supervision of Mr. Lange Powell, architect, by Mr. Stainfeld, contractor. The organ and gallery are in silky oak, and an electric motor supplies the air. A special choral service will be held at 3 p.m. on Sunday, when Mr. Archibald will contribute organ solos, the choir will sing anthems, and Misses Lena Hammond, R. Barrett, D. Wilde, E. Taylor, and Rev. A. Lewis, Messrs R. L. Wishart, S. Tamblyn, and V. Cooling will contribute solos. On Thursday night Dr. Jarman will give an organ recital, and Mrs. Jarman will be soloist for the evening.9\n\nThe collaboration between Whitehouse Bros and the architect, Lange Powell, appears here to have been similar to that which occurred later in 1924 at St Andrew's Presbyterian (now Uniting) Church, Warwick, where both the pulpit and the organ case were designed by Powell. The case at West End, insofar as it remains visible, shows similarities to that at Warwick, neither being typical of the general Whitehouse style. A plaque on the organ case still records Archibald's gift:\n\nPresented to the Trustees and Congregation\n\nof the West End Methodist Church\n\nby R. J. Archibald Esq 25.5.24.10\n\nOrgan casework, pulpit and other furnishings, designed by Lange Powell\n\n[Photograph by John Maidment (September 2007)]\n\nThe opening of the organ was reported in The Brisbane Courier on the Monday following.11 The specification given on this occasion differs only slightly in nomenclature from what now appears at the console, and it lacks any reference to the 16ft stop on the Great. This omission may result simply from the fact that it is borrowed from a Pedal stop (see below).\n\nFollowing the dedication and opening, an organ recital was presented on the Thursday night by Dr C.A. Jarman, who was at that time organist of St Mark's Anglican Church, Warwick. Jarman provided a glowing testimonial, comparing the West End instrument favourably with the slightly smaller Whitehouse organ installed around a year earlier at St Mark's:\n\nBrisbane\n\nThursday Night 11 P M\n\n29/5/24\n\nDear Mr Whitehouse,\n\nI feel that I want to write and congratulate you on the excellent Organ that you have supplied to the West End Methodist Church, upon which I gave the recital to-night. The quality of tone is really delightful, and as regards the action, well I can only repeat of it what I have found with the Organ at St Mark's Warwick. It is as near perfection as can be obtained.\n\nIt has been more than a pleasure to give the recital tonight and after a good deal of experience of work of almost all the Organ Builders in Australia, I am only firmer in my sincere conviction \"Whitehouse\" first.\n\nWith kindest regards.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nChas A. Jarman.\n\nMusD. L.Mus Lond.\n\n(Late Organist of Bathurst, N.S.W. Cathedral).12\n\nThis instrument was one of the larger tubular-pneumatic organs built by the Whitehouse firm in Queensland. The specification, of 19 stops, is around the same size as St Mary's, Ipswich (1915, with addition c.1917), and two stops larger than St Brigid's, Red Hill (1914). The differences in tonal design from the earlier instruments, however, are interesting: As at St Mark's Warwick a year earlier, there is now a general shift towards more foundation tone, with three Pedal stops and nothing above 4ft stops on the Great. The 16ft manual flue stop now appears on the Great rather than on the Swell. These trends were evident later also in the large Whitehouse pneumatic instruments at The Southport School (1925) and at the Masonic Temple, Brisbane (1930).\n\n[Photograph by Trevor Bunning (September 2007)]\n\nAt some time after 1972, when the specification was first recorded as below, the console at West End was moved by Walter Emerson of Toowoomba to its present detached position.13 It was presumably also at this time that the original trigger swell was replaced by a balanced one, and that the middle flat of pipes in Powell's case was covered by a screen.\n\nThe organ was restored in 1991-92 by W. J. Simon Pierce, retaining cone tuning.14\n\nConsole of the Whitehouse organ\n\n[Photograph by Trevor Bunning (September 2007)]\n\nGREAT\n\nBourdon\n\nOpen Diapason\n\nDulciana\n\nClarabella\n\nPrincipal\n\nFlute\n\nSWELL\n\nOpen Diapason\n\nSalicional\n\nVoix Celeste\n\nGedact\n\nGemshorn\n\nFlute\n\nPiccolo\n\nCornopean\n\nOboe\n\nVox Humana\n\nPEDAL\n\nBourdon\n\nEcho Bourdon\n\nBass Flute\n\nCOUPLERS\n\nSwell to Pedal\n\nGreat to Pedal\n\nSwell to Great\n\nSwell Super\n\nSwell Sub\n\n16\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\n16\n\n16\n\n8\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\nB\n\n[acting through to Great]\n\n[acting through to Great]\n\nDetached draw-stop console\n\n3 combination pistons (& cancel) to Great Organ\n\n3 combination pistons (& cancel) to Swell Organ\n\nRadiating concave pedalboard\n\nHitchdown lever swell [replaced by balanced swell pedal after 1972]\n\nTremulant\n\nCompass: 61/30\n\nTubular-pneumatic action.15\n\nThe stop jambs suggest that two further stops may have been envisaged on the Great organ.\n\nThe stop jambs of the Whitehouse organ\n\n[Photographs by Trevor Bunning (September 2007)]\n\nPipework of the Great Organ\n\n[Photograph by John Maidment (September 2007)]\n\nPedal Bourdon and action\n\n[Photograph by John Maidment (September 2007)]\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n1 The Telegraph (12 January 1885), p. 5; \"Diary of Events\" for 15 November 1885 in Pugh's Queensland Almanac . . . for 1886.\n\n2 Donald Watson & Judith McKay, Queensland Architects of the 19th Century: A Biographical Dictionary (Brisbane: Queensland Museum, 1994), pp. 208-09.\n\n3 Diamond Jubilee . . .
