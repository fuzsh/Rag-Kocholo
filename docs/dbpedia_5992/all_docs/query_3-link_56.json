        "text": "Did you know that a development proposal has been submitted, seeking the refurbishment of the historic Masonic Hall in Wynnum? The proposal also includes the construction of two new dwelling houses onsite.\n\nRead: Wynnum Wading Pool Reopens After Jellyfish Scare\n\nAt present, the Brisbane City Council is reviewing the proposal, which, if approved, will entail the renovation of the historic Masonic Hall. The project will also involve the removal of the non-original 1964 extension on the Walnut St side and the creation of new openings to enhance the hallâ€™s functionality.\n\nThe Wynnum Lodge, established in 1894, decided to build their own meeting hall in 1919. Veritable Worship Brother F.J. Wilkes designed and constructed the Masonic Hall in 1920, which has since become a local landmark in the Wynnum area.\n\nLodge members have been utilizing the Georgian Revival-style hall for over a hundred years for various activities including meetings, organizing charitable events, and social gatherings. The Masonic Hall served as a meeting place, allowing it to function as a Masonic Lodge with five craft lodges until it was sold in 2022.\n\nAs part of the proposal, two new two-story houses are planned to be built on two of the four blocks at the site. One of the houses will have a garage with two car parking spaces that can be accessed via Walnut Street, whilst the other house will have a garage with two internal car parking spaces that can be accessed via Penfold Parade.\n\nThe proposal was lodged in December 2022, and amended plans have since been submitted to address concerns raised by the council. The updated plans include changes to the proposed loft within the ceiling space of the former Masonic Temple, and minor adjustments to the layout, including the addition of an electric fireplace on the ground level of the former Masonic Hall, an altered laundry layout, and modifications to the size and layout of the subfloor.\n\nRead: Pre-1911 House In Wynnum May Be Saved From Demolition\n\nAlso, the proposed new dwelling houses on either side of the former Masonic Hall have also been amended to be sited closer to the natural ground level, reducing the height of both dwellings and ultimately reducing their visual impact on the former Masonic Hall.\n\nPublished 13-April-2023"
