        "text": "History\n\nQueensland St John Preceptory & Priory No.77 on the roll of The Great Priory of Scotland was consecrated Saturday, 14th September, 1946 in the Masonic Temple Ann St. Brisbane. Regular Musters were authorised for alternate months and the location was the Masonic Temple Taringa. This happened until 1966 when a Notice of Motion was presented to move. On 21st September, 1966 the Preceptory started meeting at the Masonic Temple Sherwood.\n\nThis continued for some time, during which Qld St John worked many Aspirants and built up to a membership of considerable size which allowed it to assist in the formation of new Preceptories such as- Iona in 1986; Beenleigh in 1989 and previously Qld St Pieter in 1961.\n\nThis Preceptory has been fortunate enough to provide six District Grand Priors to date -\n\nRt.Emt.Fr.A.G.Donaldson GCT 1980\n\nRt.Emt.Fr.F.S.Krieger\n\nGCT 1985\n\nRt.Emt.Fr.R.J.E.Jones\n\nKCT 1994 Rt.Emt.Fr.J.S.Ross KCT 2010 Rt.Emt.Fr.T.Tyler PDGP\n\n2015\n\nRt.Emt.Fr.D.McGregor DGP 2021\n\nOn Wednesday, 20th November, 1996 the 50th Annual Muster was celebrated with a reconsecration ceremony performed by the then District Grand Prior, Rt.Emt.Fr.R.J.E.Jones KCT and assisted by District Grand Priory Officers, followed by the Installation of the Venerable Preceptor and Obligation of Officers. In 1998 again we moved, this time to the James & Janie Sinnamon Memorial Temple, which had been built by Lodge Taringa in a newer suburb of Brisbane's west, Sinnamon Park. This move gave the Preceptory a resurgance of membership and financial strength which has to be considered these days. It is hoped Queensland St John will be there for the next milestone- 100yrs."
