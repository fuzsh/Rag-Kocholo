        "text": "Brisbane is populated with iconic buildings that have been constructed over the years and helped give the city its sense of character and history. These buildings, many of which are heritage, are important monuments to the evolution of Brisbane and showcase both the beautiful and and more troubling moments from its past.\n\n1. Moorlands, Auchenflower\n\nMoorlands, located in Auchenflower, became heritage listed on 21 August, 1992. As a home (or, more accurately, a villa), Moorlands has a history steeped in infamy. Constructed in 1982, it was built for the Mayne family, who had long been ostracised for the alleged sins of their father, Patrick Mayne. On his deathbed, Patrick Mayne reportedly confessed to the murder of Robert Cox in 1848.\n\nPatrick's widow, Mary Mayne, occupied the house with her five children. After her passing, four of the children lived in the home during different periods of their life. Of particular signficance was Dr James Mayne, who donated a large chunk of land for where the University of Queensland now stands.\n\nImage source: \"Moorlands Facade\" by Ismuca1 - Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons.\n\nWhile Moorlands has become tied to the the infamy of the Mayne family (the book The Mayne Inheritance only served to worsen this infamy), it also stands as a monument to the good that many members of the Mayne family actually brought to Brisbane, patricularly James.\n\n2. Boggo Road gaol\n\nBoggo Road gaol stands are one of Brisbane's most notorious, with the site achieving heritage listing in 1993. What made the gaol notorious was its inarguably archaic living conditions and treatment of prisoners. Anger over the conditions led to a series of protests during the 1980s, with prisoners going on hunger strikes, rioting, holding rooftop protests and even swallowing wire. These protests became national news and led to a Queensland government inquest that found the facilities to be inadequate and outdated.\n\nImage source\n\nBetween 1989 and 2000 different parts of the gaol were shut down and some even demolished. Nowadays, tours are held in Boggo Road gaol, both in the form of history and ghost tours. From time to time, people are also allowed to film there but need specific permission from the government.\n\n3. General Post Office, Brisbane\n\nStill in use today, the General Post Office (GPO) in Brisbane's CBD originally opened in 1872 along Queen Street and was then extended through to Elizabeth Street in 1908. During its earlier years, electrical engineers Barton and White lived along Edison Lane, which ran along the back of the post office (it was called Post Office Lane back then).\n\nAs they were the pioneers of electricity in Brisbane, their premises, Brisbane's first power station (c1887), meant that the GPO was actually one of very first buildings in Brisbane's history to get electricity. The lane behind the post office was renamed Edison Lane after Thomas Edison. The GPO is now listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register.\n\nImage source\n\n4. Masonic Temple\n\nHeritage-listed on 21 October, 1992, the Masonic Temple in Brisbane is a site that's truly a sight to behold.The Temple itself is both a World War I memorial to lost Freemasons and a monument to Freemasonary. It was designed by Lange Powell and built between the years of 1928 and 1930. It is the only Temple to have a dedicated Grand Hall for freemasons in the country.\n\nImage source: \"Masonic Memorial Temple, Brisbane 06.2013 127\" by Kgbo - Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Commons.\n\nThe foyer is a World War I memorial and the Grand Hall is situated on the upper level. The entire Temple is a beautiful structure that was built in the Classic Revival style. If you want to check it out for yourself, the Temple is open to the public Monday to Friday between the hours of 11am and 2pm.\n\n5. Cloudland Memorial\n\nWhen we mention Cloudland, we do not mean the nightclub in Fortitude Valley. A few decades ago, a grand ballroom known as Cloudland resided in Bowen Hills and featured lit-up arch which was visible from afar at night. Cloudland was a beloved staple for many Brisbanites. Sadly, at 3am on 7 November 1982, hench men of a shady developer destroyed the building. Understandably, there was a massive public outcry.\n\nImage source\n\nThe Cloudland Memorial, by artist Jamie MacLeand, is designed after Cloudland's iconic arch. The sculpture also features panels of Cloudland images and a ceramic paved 'dance floor'. This dance floor contains stories from the generations of people who had the pleasure of spending time in the Cloudland Ballroom prior to its destruction."
