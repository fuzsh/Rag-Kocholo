        "text": "Welcome to the Kangaroo Point and Districts History Group. Our goal is to collect and preserve the history of the early Brisbane suburb of Kangaroo Point and adjoining suburbs of East Brisbane, Woolloongabba and South Brisbane.\n\nThese suburbs have a fascinating and diverse history which must be recorded and preserved for both current and future generations. In these times of change and fast-paced development, it is vital that the heritage and memories of the past are not lost.\n\nOur history is like a giant jigsaw puzzle with many interlocking pieces reflecting the various aspects of each area – with each piece an important link to a better understanding of the past. It is the people and their stories which help to put the pieces together and preserve the jigsaw for future generations.\n\nBrisbane’s iconic Story Bridge is our starting point, reaching out from Kangaroo Point into East Brisbane, Woolloongabba and South Brisbane, Australia.\n\nPlease join us on our journey of discovery back to the early days in order to better understand how these suburbs have evolved to become the vibrant and diverse communities they are today.\n\nSouth Brisbane Federal Band 1938\n\nThe South Brisbane Federal Band marching through the streets in Maryborough during the Easter band competition in April 1938.

There was ‘Old St Mary’s, the home of Dr. Lilian Cooper and Mary Josephine Bedford (see posts of 26 June and 1 July 2018). Next to it was “Hilderstone” set in picturesque gardens sloping down to the river.\n\n“Hilderstone” was built in 1866 by the renowned Brisbane architect and politician, James Cowlishaw for Mr. Ernest Goertz and his wife. Mr. Goertz was a wine and spirit merchant in Eagle Street. The single-storey building soon became too small for the large family of seven sons and two daughters, so an upper storey was added in 1887. The new elegant home had large rooms, high ceilings, cedar fittings and seven marble mantlepieces and was then named “Hilderstone” after Hilderstone Hall in England. Mr. Goertz was originally from Windsor, England and Mrs. Goertz was Australian-born.\n\nRead more about Hilderstone and other houses in Kangaroo Point https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/historic-homes/kangaroo-point-houses/\n\nEast Brisbane State School is 125 years old\n\n8 July 2024 marked the 125th anniversary of East Brisbane State School which was officially opened on Saturday afternoon of 8 July 1899.\n\n10 July 2024 marked the 125th anniversary of the first students starting at the school on Monday 10 July 1899.\n\nThe 125th anniversary will be celebrated with a special Fun Fair featuring something for everyone.\n\nfor the history and interesting articles about the school go to https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/photo-gallery/schools/east-brisbane-state-school/\n\nBefore and after the Grey Street Bridge\n\nPhoto 1: ca. 1897 – looking west from the city across to South Brisbane where the Grey Street Bridge would be built from 1928 to 1932.\n\nPhoto 2: looking west from the Brisbane City Hall clock tower towards the William Jolly Bridge, Taylor Range and Mount Coot-tha, March 1932\n\nThe Grey Street (renamed William Jolly Bridge in 1955) was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925, and was one of the first major capital works of the new city Council and bears the name of its first Mayor.\n\nAt the time of construction, the only traffic bridge linking North and South Brisbane was the second Victoria Bridge, built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893.\n\nThe William Jolly Bridge crosses the Brisbane River at the tip of the South Brisbane peninsula between Grey Street, South Brisbane, and the intersection of Skew and Saul Streets on the northern bank.

In late 1953 she met Neil Loggie at a dance at Cloudland Ballroom and after a whirlwind romance they married in February the following year. Their son Doug was born in December 1955.\n\nContinue reading https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/stories/people/joy-loggie/\n\nShops Stanley Street, Woolloongabba 1920s\n\nThe Mater hospital is in the background.\n\nSee more Woolloongabba streetscapes at https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/historic-homes/streetscapes/woolloongabba-streetscapes/\n\nOn this day in 1939: Gap closed on Story Bridge spans\n\nThe suspended spans at the Kangaroo Point end on the left and the Fortitude Valley end on the right were joined with a central panel on the morning of 28 October 1939.\n\nCustoms House and Story Bridge ca. 1958\n\nThis postcard was published by Sydney G Hughes Pty Ltd.\n\nCity Reach seen from Kangaroo Point ca. 1913\n\nThe postcard has an interesting note: ‘outer edges of postcard drawn to look like a wooden frame and it is coloured green, image is actually b&w’.

This meant that Queensland was missing out on the rapidly growing lucrative trade and exhibition market and its financial and tourism benefits. While at the time many hotels were catering for conventions they would not be able to cope with the expected larger scale international conventions, trade exhibitions, sporting and cultural events.

She was dressed in her simple white and blue habit and sari – one of only two that she owned – and stayed at Bardon with the Sisters of Mercy.”\n\nMother Teresa (1910-1997) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 “for her work for bringing help to suffering humanity”. She dedicated her life to serving and helping others, especially the very poor in India and lived a very simple life. In 1950 she founded the Missionaries of Charity and her organisation built homes for orphans, nursing homes for lepers and hospices for the terminally ill in Calcutta. The mission soon spread worldwide. Mother Teresa was loved and respected for her humbleness and genuine desire and passion to help those nobody else wanted to help. She was canonised by Pope Francis in 2016 and is now known as Saint Teresa.\n\nRead more https://www.mater.org.au/history?fbclid=IwAR0J_B9GmLFIRL0BFbiLgrr3DPgnzvma8Tyz8cRcNCiQiuj7CHKEbsVSuAE\n\nReminiscing at Yungaba\n\nRecently we had the pleasure of showing beautiful Yungaba, the former Immigration Depot, to Paula Sutherland, a visitor who had stayed there with her family after arriving from England in 1974 when she was just seven years old.\n\nThen: Paula with her sister at Yungaba in February 1974.

As we saw in earlier posts, two of our most eminent pioneering women, Dr Lilian Cooper and her partner Mary Josephine Bedford made a great contribution to the war effort with their service in Serbia in challenging times.\n\nWhen World War I broke out Lilian and Josephine were keen to help and offered their services to the Australian Army. However, they were turned down as only female nurses, not doctors or assistants, were accepted at that time! In fact Lilian was told “The army do not want women doctors. Dr Cooper would do much better to stay home and knit for the war effort.” The British Army also turned them down! Undeterred, they joined the Scottish Women’s Hospitals for Foreign Service (SWH) which had been founded in 1914 by Dr Elsie Inglis, a surgeon and leader in the Women’s Suffrage Movement in Scotland. She and her committee set up 14 field hospitals to treat the wounded in France, Serbia and Russia. They were funded by the National Union of Women’s Suffrage and staffed mainly by female nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers, cooks and orderlies.\n\nIn September 1916 Lilian and Josephine joined the SWH unit in Ostrovo, located near Lake Ostrovo, in Serbian Macedonia, not far from the front line. It was known as the American Unit (as most funds for its operation and equipment were raised in America) and consisted of a field hospital and ambulance unit run by Dr Agnes Bennett of Sydney housed in about 200 tents. Conditions in the mountainous war zone were tough, especially during the winter, yet the women worked on tirelessly doing the best they could in the trying circumstances. Lilian worked as a surgeon at the hospital site while Josephine took charge of the Ambulance Division with all female drivers getting the patients to safety. As the battles intensified many wounded were dying on the way to the hospital so an advanced dressing station was set up closer to the front line to tend to the wounded more quickly. It was opened just before Christmas 1916 and Dr Lilian Cooper was put in charge.

The baths were built without a roof and were the first of their kind in Brisbane, more suitable to the climate and less expensive than fully enclosed baths. The pool was 100ft long and 30ft wide and cost about £860 including sheds.\n\nThe baths featured as an important rest stop during the march of the Dungarees on 30 November 1915 when the Railway Band led the marchers down Stanley Street reaching the baths at about 11:20 am. They were met by the Governor, Sir Hamilton Gould Adams who congratulated them for their support of the cause which Great Britain was fighting for. After the men had a refreshing swim, soft drinks, cakes and cigarettes, the Governor and members of the South Brisbane Town Council joined them in their march to the Victoria Bridge.

It was located at 373 Ann Street in the grounds of St John’s Cathedral, the first stage of which had been dedicated on 28 October 1910.\n\nThe hospital was named St Martin’s War Memorial Hospital because the Armistice had been signed on St Martin’s day, 11 November, now Armistice/Remembrance Day. It was designed by L.L. Powell and opened and dedicated on 28 November 1922. There were seven main wards , several single rooms and two operating theatres. The main kitchen was on the top floor with smaller kitchens on each floor for food distribution. Construction costs were raised by public subscription and many community fundraising events such as those held at Scotby.\n\nRead more https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/historic-homes/houses-in-east-brisbane/\n\nScotby – 59 Mowbray Terrace, East Brisbane\n\nThis imposing two-story timber residence on the highest part of Mowbray Terrace previously known as Sinclair’s Hill was built ca. 1910 for Josiah Henry Hancock, and his wife Mary Isabella (nee Peel).\n\nJosiah was the grandson of Thomas Hancock, founder of the timber firm Hancock and Gore.

Josephine was the niece of Admiral Sir Frederick George Denham Bedford who was Governor of Western Australia from 1903 to 1909. Ever since they first met in 1888 when they were students, Lilian studying medicine and Josephine art they became inseparable and became lifelong partners. That was the beginning of a life of dedication to community welfare for two exceptional women.\n\nAfter Lilian’s graduation as a doctor in October 1890, she and Josephine emigrated to Brisbane in response to an advertisement for a female doctor placed by Dr James Booth of South Brisbane. They arrived on 29 May 1891 and in June Lilian was registered as a doctor, becoming the first female registered doctor in Queensland. They lived with Dr Booth and his wife Amy in their home named Niniu in Cordelia Street, South Brisbane while Lilian assisted Dr Booth in his practice.\n\nSix months later they moved to the Mansions in George Street where Lilian, with the support of Josephine, set up her own practice with Josephine often taking Lilian to house calls in their sulky. Their joint determination and strength helped them deal with the prejudices of the day and see Lilian build up a successful practice and finally be accepted by the community and respected by her male colleagues.\n\nRead more about Josephine Bedford https://kangaroopointhistory.com.au/stories/people/mary-josephine-bedford/\n\nHorse bolts from Southside to the City at 3 pm on 15 January 1935.\n\nNot quite the Melbourne Cup, but an exciting race with a good outcome!\n\nCan you imagine a horse pulling an empty cart bolting from Russell Street in South Brisbane all the way down Melbourne Street, cross the Grey Street Bridge and finally collide with a moving tram in George Street ?

In 1905 she became associated with the Mater Misericordiae Hospital and stayed with it for the rest of her life.\n\nIn June 1911 Dr. Cooper returned to England via the United States where she visited the Mayo Clinic and the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland. She went on to win a doctorate of medicine from the University of Durham in 1912.

The next owner was the Rev J R Moffatt, the first rector of St Mary’s Anglican Church (1860-1870) which was then a small timber building in John Street (now Rotherham Street) before the stone church was built in 1873. After his appointment to St Mary’s he commissioned architect Benjamin Backhouse to design a ‘wood cottage with stone foundations’. Tenders were called on 12 June 1862 and the house was built shortly after. Moffatt named the house ‘St Mary’s’ and lived there until he sold it in 1865.

Williams to move the first resolution:\n\n“That this meeting of ratepayers of the city of Brisbane is of the opinion that the interests of the inhabitants of this city are so clearly identified with those of Woolloongabba, Coorparoo, and the districts beyond as to require more direct means of intercommunication between these parts of the city, and that the necessity for more central bridge accommodation is urgent and pressing.\n\nThe bridge at South Brisbane was congested and unable to carry the traffic, as was patent to everybody, but by building a bridge across to Kangaroo Point they would be benefiting the whole district in that direction.”\n\nSketches of the Naval Stores at Kangaroo Point\n\nThese two pencil drawings were done by Australian artist Lloyd Rees (1895-1988) He was born in Brisbane and moved to Sydney in 1917 where he spent most of his life.

The sketches are part of his “Brisbane Landscapes” collection which is now housed at the Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA).\n\nThe sketches show the Naval Stores at the bottom of the cliffs at Kangaroo Point, with one detailing the steps leading up to the Rectory and Parish Hall of St Mary’s Anglican Church, at the top of the cliffs.

A new track was built and additional seating added for the very successful Commonwealth Games in 1982 which were opened by Prince Phillip and closed by the Queen.\n\nSince then the venue has been renamed several times and has a proven track record for hosting large crowds for both sporting and entertainment events such as the Super League Grand Final in 1997 between the Broncos and the Sharks which thrilled over 58, 000 football fans; the Goodwill Games in 2001; and concerts by AC/DC, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Bon Jovi and the Rolling Stones to name a few. It is currently the home of the Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre (QSAC) with grandstand seating for 48,500.\n\nUpgrading the stadium and making it the Queen Elizabeth II Olympic Stadium and incorporating its original name would surely be a fitting tribute to the much-loved former Queen of Australia.\n\nThe required changes to the public transport system and facilities upgrade will permanently benefit Brisbane residents and visitors alike and be far less costly and disruptive than the current plans to demolish and re-build the Gabba.\n\nLet’s seize this opportunity to create something historically significant and keep the heritage of the Gabba Stadium, East Brisbane State School and Raymond Park intact.

Australians turned out in their millions to catch a glimpse of the young Queen. She visited Australia for two months, keeping up a gruelling schedule and it is estimated that almost three-quarters of the Australlan population saw the Queen at least once during the visit.

Organiser Michael Nayler gave a summary of the journey, participants read an Irish poem of remembrance and the names and ages of the passengers who died and then threw flowers into the river to symbolise the lives lost.\n\nERIN-GO-BRAGH – ‘IRELAND FOREVER’\n\nThe Erin-Go-Bragh was the first Irish immigrant ship to land in Queensland. It arrived in Moreton Bay 160 years ago on 2 August 1862 and passengers disembarked near the Holman Street Ferry Wharf at the edge of what is now Captain Burke Park.\n\nSignificantly, a crew member on the ship was none other than John Burke, an adventurous able-bodied seaman who jumped ship right there and a year later married a fellow passenger, Alicia Swords. Both were about 21 at the time. Apparently he had just six pence in his pocket when he deserted the ship. He started working on the river on various steamers and gradually built up the successful Burke Shipping Empire and became a prominent and respected captain and businessman. He and Alicia lived in a house (now gone) named Kinsale named after the place of his birth in Ireland. Captain Burke Park , the very popular park under the Story Bridge is named after him.\n\nCelebrating 160 years since arrival of the Erin-go-Bragh\n\nAugust 2 2020 marks the 160th anniversary since the immigrant ship Erin-go-Bragh arrived in Brisbane. Passengers disembarked at Petrie’s store near the ferry wharf at what is now the Holman Street Ferry terminal.\n\nIt was a perilous journey which lasted six months and on the way about 57 people died, mainly from typhoid.\n\nDescendants of passengers of the Erin-go-Bragh and members of the Kangaroo Point and Districts Historical Society will gather near the Holman Street ferry terminal on Sunday 31 July 2022 to mark the anniversary and throw flowers in the river as a tribute to those who lost their lives on the journey. Afterwards they will move to SeaLegs brewery to toast the pioneers with a drink and to exchange stories. All welcome.\n\nMembers of the Russian Ballet visit St Nicholas Church in 1937\n\nMembers of Wassilie de Basil’s Monte Carlo Russian Ballet visiting St Nicholas Church, Woolloongabba, 1937. Members of the company enjoyed a cup of tea in the church hall after attending a Sunday Service.\n\nThe Russian ballet company, Ballet Russes, was formed in Paris in 1909 by Serge Diaghilev, a prominent impresario and promoter of the arts who revitalised balled by integrating other art forms of music, painting and drama with those of dance.\n\nIn 193, two years after Diaghilev’s death, two impresarios Colonel W. de Basil and René Blum formed the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. They continued the Diaghilev tradition using some of his dancers and performing large parts of his repertoire.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s several Ballet Russes companies toured Europe, the Americas and Australasia. Three companies were formed specifically to tour Australia and New Zealand between 1936 and 1940.\n\nAll were run by J.C. Williamson Theatres Ltd. Before then Australian audiences had seen some of Diaghilev’s ballets which focused on particular ballerinas, notably Anna Pavlova.

D.H. Dalrymple, Minister for Education, a large and enthusiastic crowd including new students attended the official opening of the school.\n\nOfficial guests included Mr T. Dibley M.L.A. (chairman of the late school committee), Mr D. Sinclair, chairman of the building committee, the mayor of South Brisbane, Alderman Nott and the Hon D.H. Dalrymple, Secretary for Public Lands and late Secretary for Public Instruction.\n\nMr Dibley advised that the school was starting free of debt, but noted that this would not last long as, due to a larger than expected number of enrolments, new buildings no doubt have to be added fairly quickly, incurring additional costs.\n\nHe thanked Mr Sinclair for the magnificent support and effort he and his committee had put into getting this far and presented his wife, Mrs Sinclair, with a silver key with which to perform the opening ceremony. The key was inscribed “Presented to Mrs Sinclair on the occasion of the opening of the East Brisbane State School.”\n\nMr Sinclair thanked the building committee and noted that while 350 students had been expected, 550 students had already been enrolled.\n\nMr T Halstead, of Coorparoo State School, had been appointed as headmaster.\n\nMrs Sinclair performed the official opening with her silver key and everyone filed in to inspect the premises. Refreshments were then served in the room below the school and more speeches given.\n\nEveryone was happy with the school and the students went home looking forward to starting school on Monday 10 July.\n\nInvitation to attend the official opening ceremony of the East Brisbane State School in 1899.\n\nThe Story Bridge is 82 years old today!
