        "text": "Cloaked in intrigue, Freemasonry is best known perhaps for its secret handshakes and initiation rituals. The fraternal organisation traces its origins to medieval stonemason guilds, so it's no surprise then that architecture has always played an important role in Freemasonry – and their buildings are packed with meaning.\n\nClick or scroll through to decode the mysteries of the movement's secretive structures, tour the world's most impressive Masonic lodges and decipher the symbols that have fuelled conspiracy theorists for centuries.\n\nThe world's largest secret society, Freemasonry is a global organisation made up of an estimated six million members. It's a (mostly) men's social club movement whose members look out for one another, do charitable work and take part in an array of rituals that may seem bizarre to outsiders.\n\nIn Regular Freemasonry, members have to be male, of good moral character and believe in a Supreme Being, also known as “the Grand Architect of the Universe”. Meanwhile, an alternative branch known as Continental Freemasonry is more liberal and allows the admittance of women.\n\nFreemasonry evolved in the Middle Ages from stonemasons' guilds, trade associations set up to offer mutual aid and protect the professional interests of their members. As the age of great cathedral- and castle-building waned, some groups began to admit honorary or 'speculative' members from other professions in a bid to boost their numbers.\n\nThe first non-mason member was admitted in Edinburgh in 1634. This heralded the development of ‘Regular’ – also known as ‘Speculative’ – Freemasonry, which adopted symbolism and rituals inspired by chivalry and ancient religious orders.\n\nThe stonemasons who originated the movement built the mesmerising Gothic cathedrals and castles of the Middle Ages, but as Freemasonry developed, neoclassicism became the group's go-to architectural style.\n\nIn 1723, Scottish Freemason James Anderson published the movement's Constitutions. The book underlines the importance of architecture to the organisation and extols the virtues of geometry, symmetry and the five classical orders of architecture: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan and Composite.\n\nAnderson was particularly taken with Roman architecture. He saved much of his praise for “our great Master-Mason” Inigo Jones, who introduced the neoclassical style of Italian architect Andrea Palladio – known as Palladianism – to England, with buildings like the Queen's House in Greenwich, London (pictured).\n\nPillars – especially the three most important of the five orders of architecture: Doric, Ionian and Corinthian – feature prominently in Freemasonry and its buildings, as do other characteristics of classical architecture, such as ornate pediments and mathematically perfect proportions.\n\nNonetheless, the movement has embraced other styles – including Art Deco – and brought the world one of the first skyscrapers, Chicago's long-demolished Masonic Temple (pictured), which was built in 1892.\n\nFreemasonry is structured around local lodges overseen by a regional or national Grand Lodge, which is headed by the Grand Master, but the movement has no international governing body. These local lodges (also known as temples or halls) range from relatively modest affairs to sprawling monumental constructions like the Detroit Masonic Temple, which is the biggest on the planet.\n\nMany of the world's most illustrious architects were signed-up members of the movement. The long list of luminaries includes John Vanbrugh, John Soane, Christopher Wren, Irish-born White House designer James Hoban and the UK's Nicholas Hawksmoor, who was nicknamed the 'Devil's Architect' by detractors.\n\nBenjamin LaTrobe, the neoclassical architect behind the US Capitol, was also a Freemason, as was Washington, DC master planner Pierre Charles L’Enfant. The capital of America is home to many Masonic-related buildings, and it's even been said the map of DC encodes secret Freemasonry symbols.\n\nOn top of that, America's first president George Washington was a Freemason and a major memorial in DC honours him for his membership. We'll explore the monument later on.\n\nIn fact, a bewildering number of iconic structures around the world were designed by Freemasons or their precursors, and many of these incorporate aspects of Masonic design. They include Notre-Dame de Paris, London's St Paul's Cathedral, Bavaria's fairytale Neuschwanstein Castle and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nPlenty of other buildings are alleged to have Freemason connections. Take the 15th-century Rosslyn Chapel in Midlothian, Scotland. Legend has it that the many curious carvings adorning the church represent Masonic symbols and rituals – most notably, the angels that are depicted in poses used in Masonic ceremonies.\n\nYet the general consensus is the carvings are mere workers' marks and the similarities in the angels' poses are pure coincidence.\n\nOver the past few decades, the chapel has also sparked fevered speculation among conspiracy theorists for its supposed links to the Knights Templar, the Lost Ark of the Covenant, the Holy Grail and more, particularly after it was featured in Dan Brown's 2003 bestseller The Da Vinci Code.\n\nOver the course of its history, the movement has attracted the great and the good, including 14 US presidents, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, automotive tycoon Henry Ford, jazz icon Duke Ellington and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.\n\nBut it has also roused suspicion and hate. Conspiracy theorists misunderstand the symbolism and ceremonies, associating Freemasonry with the occult and the shady Illuminati, who some believe want to introduce a dystopic New World Order.\n\nThe Catholic Church bans its adherents from joining the organisation and Freemasonry has been criticised for its lack of transparency, its reluctance to admit women and for allegedly operating as an old boys' network whose members exploit their connections for personal gain.\n\nAnimosity towards Freemasonry took its darkest turn in Nazi Germany. Members of the movement were persecuted by the regime, which espoused a ludicrous conspiracy theory whereby Freemasons were colluding with the Jewish community to take over the world. Thousands of Freemasons ended up in concentration camps and many of them didn't survive the Second World War.\n\nFreemasonry was also harshly repressed by Italy's Mussolini regime, Spain's Franco dictatorship and the Soviet Union. In fact, members have long faced hostility in many places around the globe throughout history.\n\nAs confirmed by Guinness World Records, the oldest surviving Masonic lodge on the planet is the Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No 1. It was founded in 1599, only a few months after the formation of the first-ever verified Masonic lodge – Aitchison's Haven in Musselburgh, to the east of the Scottish capital – which no longer exists.\n\nThe Lodge of Edinburgh (Mary's Chapel) No 1 originally convened within the old chapel of St Mary’s on Niddrie’s Wynd, which was demolished to accommodate the building of Edinburgh’s South Bridge late in the 18th century. The current building dates from the 1820s and was bought by the lodge in 1893.\n\nThe first purpose-built Masonic hall was completed in Marseille, France in 1765 but has long since vanished. Phoenix Lodge No 94 in Sunderland in the UK is considered to be the oldest purpose-built Masonic meeting hall that has been in continuous use since its founding.\n\nThe lodge was founded in 1755. The current building dates from 1785 and replaced the original structure, which burnt down in 1783. Though it's been added to over the years, the building is a simple rectangular Georgian structure with small rooms on either side under sloping roofs.\n\nMeanwhile, St John's Lodge, the oldest Masonic lodge in America, was formed in 1733 in Boston's Bunch of Grapes public tavern by a group of respected and affluent locals.\n\nThe lodge has a fascinating history and was frequented by famous Freemasons such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. That said, its current building in downtown Boston is comparatively recent.\n\nThe oldest surviving purpose-built Masonic hall in the US is this pared-back neoclassical construction. It was constructed in Richmond, Virginia in the late 1780s to serve as the meeting place for Richmond Randolph Lodge No 19.\n\nOther standout Masonic buildings in America include Alabama's Greek Revival temples, which date from the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1900s, Freemasonry grew in popularity, and this translated to a boom in temple-building.\n\nThough halls in smaller towns tended to be simple, temples in the big cities became ever grander. Some of the most impressive American Masonic buildings – with the Detroit Masonic Temple the leading example (pictured) – date from Freemasonry's heyday of the 1920s and 1930s. According to some sources, over 12% of the adult male population in the US belonged to the organisation during this period.\n\nThough the design of a Masonic temple isn't standardised as such, the typical example will almost certainly feature a number of design elements held sacred by the organisation.\n\nThe archetypal shape of a Masonic temple is a long, perfect rectangle. The building is oriented east to west, following the path of the sun, like the temples of classical times. The point of entry is always in the west facing east.\n\nIn terms of layout and details, each Masonic hall contains details of King Solomon's Temple as described in the Bible, a structure that has held special significance for Freemasons for more than 200 years. According to tradition, the temple is believed to have been built around the 10th century BC to house the Ark of the Covenant, a chest thought to contain the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments.\n\nAs per tradition, a lodge interior contains certain ornaments, furniture and jewels. The ornaments comprise the chequered Mosaic Pavement, together with the Indented Tessel and Blazing Star.\n\nWhile the Bible describes the floor of King Solomon's Temple as “fir” or “pine”, some Freemasons believe the chequered design is a nod to the paving stones in the fabled monarch's place of worship, while the indented skirting that surrounds it harks back to the design that is said to have bordered the floor in the temple.\n\nThe chequered pattern can also be seen to represent the tracing board used by Ancient Greek architects.\n\nBeyond the legends of its origins, the Mosaic Pavement is most widely believed to symbolise the duality of human existence, which is chequered with good and evil.\n\nAs Masonic expert John K Johnston explained, the Freemason must walk upon this chequerboard of good and evil in his life to become \"master of his fate and captain of his soul\".\n\nThe Blazing Star has myriad meanings and is purported to represent the sun, the Star of Bethlehem, Divine Providence and more. It's often depicted at the centre of the floor or on the ceiling.\n\nFreemasonry has three membership levels or ‘degrees’: Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and master mason. Entry to each level involves ceremonies conducted on the chequered floor during which the candidate is entrusted with secret tokens, signs and passwords.\n\nEach local lodge is headed by a Worshipful Master, who is assisted by Junior and Senior Wardens, and other staff members such as a Treasurer and Secretary. During meetings, the Worshipful Master is seated on the east side facing the Senior Warden on the west. The Junior Warden sits on the south side, while members are positioned on the hall's south and north sides.\n\nThe proscribed pieces of furniture in a Masonic hall include the altar. It represents the Altar of Incense that is said to have stood within the inner sanctum of King Solomon's Temple.\n\nThe altar displays the Volume of Sacred Law, which is often the Bible but can be multiple books to represent the various faiths of members. This tome is one of the Three Great Lights, the other two being the Square and Compasses, which are also placed on the altar.\n\nThey are illuminated by three tall candles or electric lights, called the Three Lesser Lights. According to some Freemasons, these symbolise the sun, the moon and the Grand or Worshipful Master.\n\nAs explained by renowned Masonic historian James Stevens Curl, the Square – along with the rule and level – is a tool the craftsman uses to check if work has been done correctly. Together, they symbolise morality and good behaviour.\n\nThe Compasses, on the other hand, are a Master Mason's tool and are widely considered to represent boundaries, self-restraint and sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nIn America, but not so much in other countries, the combined Square and Compasses symbol often has a letter “G” in the centre. Its meaning is more ambiguous. Some say the G denotes geometry, while others think it stands for God, or signifies both. The G often appears on its own in many Masonic halls.\n\nFor Freemasons, pillars symbolise wisdom and stability. It's standard for each lodge to feature two pillars placed either south or in front of the Worshipful Master's throne, or in the northwest corner of the hall. The twin pillars represent Boaz and Jachin, the columns that, as the Bible story has it, graced the entrance of King Solomon's Temple.\n\nSimilarly, the Three Grand Pillars – Ionic, Doric and Corinthian – often found elsewhere in the lodge, denote wisdom, strength and beauty, while the Broken Column symbol memorialises fallen Freemasons and is emblematic of the transience of life.\n\nA common feature in more traditional lodges is the Chamber of Reflection. A small room adjacent to the main hall, or perhaps located in a cellar beneath the hall, the chamber is where candidates retire before initiations to reflect seriously on life and death. Among the symbols present in the room are a skull, hourglass and scythe, which represent mortality, and engravings of the letters VITRIOL or VITRIOLUM. This is a Latin acronym. Spelled out in full, it roughly translates to “look within to find the truth”.\n\nThe room, with its sombre decoration and symbols intended to trigger deep, soul-searching reflection, disappeared from many American lodges for a time but it has recently made something of a comeback.\n\nAs we've mentioned, each lodge contains certain ornaments, furniture and jewels. There are six standard jewels in total, three moveable and three immoveable pieces.\n\nThe moveable jewels are the Rough Ashler, an unworked stone that represents human flaws, the Perfect Ashler, a finely crafted stone that shows how Freemasons can transcend their weaknesses, and the Trestle Board, which represents the divine plan. The three immoveable jewels – the Square, Level and Plumb – symbolise morality, equality and uprightness of conduct.\n\nThe symbolism doesn't stop there. The Seal of Solomon, which is commonly seen on the exterior and inside Masonic lodges, is one of the key emblems of the fraternal organisation.\n\nAccording to legend, the seal was emblazoned on a signet ring belonging to King Solomon and gave him magical powers. The precursor to the Star of David, it's made up of a six-pointed star formed by two superimposed triangles and represents, among other things, perfect wisdom and rule by divine grace.\n\nWhile the Square and Compasses are the craftsman and master mason's tools, the gavel, the chisel and the gauge are “the working tools of the apprentice... connected with carving and measuring,” writes Masonic historian James Stevens Curl in Handbook of Freemasonry. “But they also suggest passion, energy, education and intellectual capacity.”\n\nTogether, these tools, which are displayed around the hall, signify the three levels or degrees of Freemasonry.\n\nThe Eye of Providence or All-Seeing Eye, which is often depicted within a triangle surrounded by a halo, is another classic Freemasonry symbol. Its purpose is to remind members that God, aka the Great Architect of the Universe, is observing their every deed.\n\nThe Eye of Providence also appears on the reverse of the Great Seal of the US, which features on the $1 bill. Conspiracy theories based on the symbol abound, from tall tales suggesting it represents the malevolent Illuminati, to the belief the Freemasons orchestrated its inclusion on America's Great Seal. In reality, the symbol was in widespread use at the time of the seal's creation in the late 18th century; in any case, it wasn't widely adopted by the Freemasons until later.\n\nThe Key is the official jewel of the lodge's Treasurer. As well as alluding to power, the symbol can imply secrecy, esoteric knowledge and more.\n\nOther important Masonic symbols include the Anchor and the Ark, denoting hope, the Acacia tree, which symbolises the immortality of the soul, the Beehive, representing industriousness and teamwork, and the Sheaf of Corn, often signifying the rewards of hard work and charitable giving.\n\nNow, let's check out the most impressive lodge buildings from around the world.\n\nFreemasons' Hall was established in London's Covent Garden in 1775. The HQ of the United Grand Lodge of England, the world's first Grand Lodge, and the meeting place for over 1,000 Masonic lodges, it's the centre of English Freemasonry.\n\nThe current building, the third on the site, is an immense Art Deco masterpiece in Portland stone that was built between 1927 and 1933, originally as a memorial to Freemasons who had perished in the First World War. It cost £1.3 million to build, the equivalent of £67 million ($85m) today.\n\nCovering over two acres, the vast complex houses the Grand Temple, which can accommodate 1,700 people, in addition to 26 other Masonic temples, all richly decorated with Art Deco panache.\n\nThere's a beguiling shrine loaded with arcane symbols, along with a Freemasonry museum, café, shop and other amenities. A not-so-secret building, Freemasons' Hall, is open to the public and regularly hosts events that have nothing to do with Freemasonry, such as fashion shows and awards ceremonies.\n\nThe Detroit Masonic Temple stands 210 feet tall and has an incredible 1,037 rooms. It became the biggest Masonic building in the world in 1939, following the demolition of the humongous Chicago Masonic Temple skyscraper.\n\nCompleted in 1926, the edifice is neo-Gothic in design, with the architect eschewing the usual neoclassicism and Art Deco styles of the day to pay homage to the origins of Freemasonry and the Knights Templar.\n\nReported to be haunted, the building is mind-bogglingly colossal, with a theatre that can accommodate 5,000 people, a 17,500-square-foot drill hall, two enormous ballrooms, a cathedral and a whole lot more besides.\n\nCostly to build and expensive to run, the top three floors of the mammoth building were left unfinished, and as Freemasonry membership numbers have fallen, its owners have struggled to cover maintenance costs and bills.\n\nIn 2013, the building's outstanding tax debts were paid off by Jack White of rock duo The White Stripes, who performed the longest concert of his career there the following year. A popular venue for concerts, theatre productions, weddings and more, the temple doesn't look like it will be going under anytime soon.\n\nQuite possibly the most luxurious Freemason building in the world, the Grand Lodge of New York, or Masonic Hall NYC as the structure has been dubbed today, operates out of this 18-storey Beaux-Arts tower in the Flatiron neighbourhood of Manhattan. The landmark was built in 1907.\n\nNo expense was spared on the structure, but a bigger emphasis was put on the interiors, which have been shielded from prying eyes since the get-go thanks to the building's fake windows. Incidentally, windows are often minimal and can be completely absent in Freemason meeting halls to guarantee the privacy of the lodge's members.\n\nThe Grand Lodge Room is unsurprisingly the grandest room. The designer of its stained glass roof, Harry P Knowles, himself a master mason, went on to work on the RMS Titanic, replicating the feature on the ship.\n\nOther highlights of the showy lodge include the Hollender Room, which honours George Washington, and the enchanting Renaissance Room.\n\nAustralia has more than its fair share of showstopping Masonic buildings. An archetype of neoclassical Masonic design, Brisbane's Masonic Memorial Centre is probably the most aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe temple's foundation stone was laid on 25 April 1928, known as Anzac Day, a national day of remembrance across Australia and New Zealand that honours the armed forces and victims of war.\n\nFlanked by six fluted Corinthian columns, the heritage-listed building is crafted from opulent materials including marble, brass and granite.\n\nUpon completion, the centre was dedicated to those lives lost in the First World War, yet it also provides a showstopping venue for Freemasons to carry out their ceremonies.\n\nThe Grand Hall is the structure's most magnificent space, with its intricate, barrel-vaulted ceiling. Alongside the gold-leaf detailing and Mosaic Pavement, the regal room also features an array of ornate wood furniture, which was carved on-site from local Queensland timbers.\n\nThe Freemasons of America really pushed the boat out when they chose to memorialise one of their most distinguished past members, George Washington. The group created one of the world's most expensive and monumental private memorials to the first president.\n\nFunded by donations from the nation's lodges, the building is thought to have cost some $6 million to construct, an estimated $110 million (£87m) in today's money, and work on it went on for decades. Construction began in earnest in 1922, but the memorial wasn't fully completed until 1970.\n\nModelled on the ancient lighthouse of Ostia in Ancient Rome, the neoclassical gem has a three-tiered tower. There are Doric columns on the first level, Ionic on the second and Corinthian on the third, representing the three classical orders denoting wisdom, strength and beauty.\n\nThe breathtaking Grand Masonic Hall, which dazzles with massive granite Tuscan columns and a supersized statue of Washington, is the most spectacular interior space. Among the other draws are a replica of the Founding Father's lodge room, a Templar chapel, a theatre and a museum dedicated to the first POTUS.\n\nLoved this?
