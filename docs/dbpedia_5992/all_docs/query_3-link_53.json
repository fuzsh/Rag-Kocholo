        "text": "Music venues in Brisbane are some of the best in the world but Candlelight meticulously selects those that are truly special to host magical events. These unparalleled performances from gifted musicians are imbued with an extra helping of something special as candles flicker in gorgeous surroundings.\n\nPrepare to be enchanted at an array of stunning music venues throughout the city, including the gorgeous Grand On Ann, St. John’s Cathedral, and Brisbane City Hall. These incredible venues boast a timeless allure, with an architectural grandeur that creates a breathtaking backdrop for Candlelight concerts.\n\nExplore your favourite artists’ best work with these classical renditions in Brisbane’s most iconic venues.\n\nSaint John’s Anglican Cathedral: a prime example of Gothic Revival architecture\n\nLocated on Ann Street, Saint John’s Anglican Cathedral is the metropolitan cathedral of the ecclesiastical province of Queensland, Australia. The third bishop of Brisbane commissioned the British Gothic Revival architect, John Loughborough Pearson to design the cathedral. However, due to lack of funds and financial issues, the structure was eventually built in three stages.\n\nThe first stage of construction began in 1906 and 41 years later the second stage resumed after the Second World War. A few decades later, the third and last stage of construction began in 1989 and was finally completed in 2009. At last, the cathedral boasted a southwest porch, the final bay of the nave, the west front, central, and the north and south towers.\n\nGrand on Ann: a modern classic\n\nThe Masonic Memorial Centre, also known as Grand on Ann, is a heritage-listed Masonic temple designed by Lange Leopold Powell. Its incredible space provides the setting for Freemasons’ ceremonies. With gold-lead embellishments, furniture made from Queensland timbers, and the fifth-largest organ in Queensland, The Masonic Temple provides a magnificent setting for the Candlelight series.\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Stephen: one of Australia’s oldest Cathedrals\n\nThe Cathedral of St. Stephen is a gorgeous Gothic revival cathedral. Dating back to 1863 when the first stone was laid, this spot is a sight to behold, with soaring spires, and tall stained windows, and all in the centre of Brisbane on Elizabeth Street! It’s going to look ever more incredible lit by hundreds of candles as the sound of musical tributes fills that colossal space.\n\nCandlelight has captivated over 100 cities worldwide. Whether you appreciate classical music, pop, rocks or film scores, you’ll hear it all by the cosy glow of thousands of candles. These concerts promise to uplift your spirit, having enthralled audiences with a diverse array of music. These events offer an evening of mesmerizing music by skilled musicians in some of the city’s most picturesque settings. There are plenty of reasons to explore this incredible concert series!\n\nNote: For the safety of our audience, all of the candlelight will be provided through flameless candles."
