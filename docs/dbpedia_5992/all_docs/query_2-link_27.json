        "text": "Today I will share with you my second day at Brisbane Open House 2015. I wrote about the event in my previous post here. On Saturday I was volunteering at the Museum of Brisbane and didn’t have much time to explore heritage treasures, so my Sunday list was quite busy.\n\nI started my day at the oldest occupied building in Brisbane – the Commissariat Store at William Street. Currently it is a home of Royal Historical Society of Queensland since 1981 and they also run a museum that showcases Queensland history. It is fantastic that such old buildings like that are still in Brisbane, they are linking us with the very beginnings of the city.\n\nNext I walked to Queensland’s first purpose-built parliamentary building – The Parliament House on George Street. There are guided tours every week but during the work week it’s hard to find time so this was a great opportunity for me to visit this place. It was crowded, one of the most popular buildings I think, I went for a self-guided tour and explored rooms where Queensland’s law is created.\n\nThe foundation stone of the Parliament House was laid on 14 July 1865 by Governor George Ferguson Bowen. And this fact connects us with the Old Government House which is just few steps away. In 1859 Sir George Ferguson Bowen was appointed the first Governor of Queensland, a colony that had just been separated from New South Wales. It was a residence of Governors of Queensland until 1910 when they moved to Fernberg at Paddington which was supposed to be a temporary residence, yet they stay there since then.\n\nThe building is located at the Gardens Point overlooking Brisbane Botanic Gardens that I walked through along the river. The Botanic Gardens have been flooded many times and the Brisbane City Council established new botanic gardens at Mount Coot-tha in 1970s. Did you know that The Gardens were also the home for ‘Harriet’, a tortoise collected by Charles Darwin during his visit to the Galápagos Islands in 1835. Harriet was donated to the Gardens in 1860 and lived there for almost 100 years? She had an estimated age of 175 years at the time of her death in Australia Zoo in 2006.\n\nFollowing the river I passed Customs House (completed and opened 1889) that I visited in last year and got to Howard Smith Wharves under the Story Bridge. We had a walk arranged by the architecture company that presented plans for the area. Plans look impressive and if everything goes as planned it will be another great place for social meetings with heritage buildings incorporated in site. Besides the wharves, there are also air raid shelters constructed by Brisbane City Council during World War 2.\n\nOn my way back to the City I visited the former Castelmine Perkins building at 418 Adelaide St that used to be a head office of Castelmine Brewery before they moved to Milton. The building was originally a 2 storey and extended to 3 storey in 1918 when the brewery took ownership. The date from the plaque on the façade is misleading – 1871 refers to the history of Castelmine Brewery who had majority ownership throughout the 20th Century.\n\nI started day at the second oldest building in Brisbane and finished at the oldest one – the Old Windmill built in 1828 by convicts. During the years it changed its purpose, started as a windmill, then converted to telegraph signal station. Tower was also used by fire brigade for observation, radio research station by Queensland Institute of Radio Engineers and it was a place of Queensland’s first television broadcast."
