Attorney-General. Member of Constitutional Committee 1897 and sat in First Parliament of Australia following Federation. MLA MLC\n\nSir John Downer was twice Premier of South Australia and was a significant Federationalist. He is not listed anywhere I can find as a Freemason, however significantly 1885 'GRAND LODGE OF FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS OF VICTORIA.', The Age (Melbourne, Vic. : 1854 - 1954), 13 July, p. 6.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191195513 carried the line “Bro. Downer, the present Premier of South Australia, had an interview with the Grand Secretary...” (of Grand Lodge Victoria, the forerunner to United Grand Lodge Victoria). UGLV was founded in 1889 and GLV in 1883, but did not achieved regularity and mainly consisted of Irish Lodges. The date of the article fits with Downer’s Premiership, however I (and GLSA&NT) cannot currently find any collaborating evidence. His association with the unrecognised GLV might have tainted him in some way, and he is listed as “Brother” indicating he had not advanced far in Freemasonry of which there is no mention of in his funeral notices..\n\nInquires with the Grand Lodge of South Australia have not been able to find anything. They advise;\n\nA careful search of available library records has revealed no direct Masonic connection for Sir John Downer. The “S.A. Freemason” publication covering that period particularly would probably have had some mention of Sir John because of his great prominence in this State and Federally if he had been a Freemason. I am sure that the Grand Master Brother concerned was Most Worshipful Brother Henry Edward Downer, the brother of Sir John. Charles R A Glover’s “First Fifty Years of Freemasonry in South Australia’ contains references to H E Downer as District Grand Master in 1869 and as Provincial Grand Master in 1870. This would I feel sure be under the jurisdiction of United Grand Lodge of England. Other references include him as Master Elect in The United Tradesmens Lodge, and as Junior Grand Deacon in 1860. “The Supreme Federalist” – “The Political Life of Sir John Downer” by the Hon. Dr. John Bannon who was Premier of South Australia 1982-1992, also has no mention of a Masonic connection. A photograph of Sir John and a photograph of his grave monument in that book show no Masonic emblems. It has been most interesting to follow up your enquiry and to make contact with you Brother Damian as Editor of Devotion News, Lodge Devotion 723 UGLV and you Brother Ange at the UGLV Library and Museum. With kindest fraternal greetings for the festive season and best wishes for the new year, yours, John Rand. PGPsvt. Library Assistant\n\nOn many occasions I have been able to “prove” Masonic Membership of famous men through several primary and secondary sources. I would like any assistance readers can give in substantiating yet another South Australian Premier as a Freemason.\n\nProving a Premier – George Leake, Western Australia\n\nSir Luke Samuel Leake (1828-1886) merchant and Speaker of the House MLC was a Freemason. He is the Brother of George Leake who was the Third Premier of Western Australia. While researching, I noted that the Grand Master attended George’s funeral. This might be because George was a notable public figure, but there might be more to it, especially as there are further suggestions of George’s association with Freemasonry, but given the Craft’s standing at the time, and a possible connection via family, attendance and references to Freemasonry might be because of this. For instance, my own father, not a Freemason, has sat with the Grand Master in a lodge, when the public were admitted. It is a mistake to take such references as definite proof of Masonic Membership, but in George’s case, there is a “vibe” to the references which suggests he may have been a Freemason, but these suggestions do not meet the burden of proof for inclusion as a Freemason in this list. Can anyone assist ?\n\n· George Leake CMG KC (1856 –1902) was the third Premier of Western Australia, serving from May to November 1901 and then again from December 1901 to his death. Possible -\n\nReturn to Top\n\n· The Royal Woman’s Hospital (Melbourne Lying-in Hospital and Infirmary for Diseases of Women and Children) has two Freemasons as the Founders - this might be a good area of research\n\n· The Australian Medical Journals co-founding editors were Freemasons and a subsequent purchaser was a Freemason – this might be worth looking into.\n\n· Several of Australia’s first members of parliament were Freemasons – that would be worth looking into.\n\n· Two out of three early owners of “The Australian” newspaper were Freemasons\n\nhttp://adb.anu.edu.au/biographies/search/?query=rele:%22286%22&re=true&rpp=200\n\n· Royal Australian Air Force Air Marshals: Frederick Scherger (confirmed as a Freemason), Richard Williams, George Jones, William Bostock, Adrian Cole\n\nSources for inclusion of names are recorded in the endnotes. These are only included in PDF versions of the list.\n\nSource websites and books below are recorded either for the strong start they gave me in the early days of research or because they yielded several names I may not have otherwise discovered.\n\nFor several years now, my methodology has been to think of a famous or notable Australian, then use Google to Boolean search for a reliable source confirming membership. Both as a Freemason and with an interest in History, I often stumble across new names. Increasingly names with are being supplied to me by the public – thank you !\n\nSources - Web Sites of Note\n\nWeb sites used are retained in this list even if they go off line.

I think I am doing a reasonably good job, but it must be said that due to the methodology, being to research these names via the internet, it is possible the list has developed a bias towards those already noted on the web as Freemasons. That said, often the source used is newspaper articles on Trove. Several important men listed who have been discovered via the research of books, periodicals and lodge records. The best example of which is Air Chief Marshall Frederick Rudolph William Scherger, who was reported to me as a Freemason, was not listed on the web as one, but research showed him to be a member.\n\nA Note on Punctuation and Masonic Titles.\n\nFirstly, apologies for removing as many full stops from the list as possible, hence C.B.E becomes CBE. This was done to make the list more readable.\n\nAlso, “Masonic ranks” have generally not been added with the exception of Grand Masters, and even then, appellations have been omitted, again to make the list more readable.\n\nA Note on Versions of this Document\n\nThis section was added in Version 11 released on Tuesday, January 3, 2017.\n\nVersion 11\n\nA major change in this version was to change the type of bullet points used to mark name to make the list more web friendly. Bullets were changed from an arrow head to a round bullet which will clearly identify earlier versions of the list. We have also confirmed several very notable Australians as Freemasons such as Tommy Woodcock and Reg Ansett and others.\n\nVersion 12\n\n“Compendium “added to the title of the list and 35 names added from “300 Famous Australian Freemasons” by Kent Henderson with additional names added in the list requiring further research.\n\nBooks for the author to research\n\n· Representative British Freemasons By Kessinger Publishing Company ISBN: 0766135896\n\n· Representative British Freemasons\", Dodd’s Peerage Limited, London, 1915.\n\n· Australia's First Rotary Club A History of the Rotary Club of Melbourne ByOwen Parnaby\n\n· The Architect of Victory: The Military Career of Lieutenant General Sir Frank Horton Berryman by Peter Dean\n\n· A MAN OF ACHIEVEMENT.
