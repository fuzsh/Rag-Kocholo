        "text": "The new Masonic Memorial\n\nTemple In Ann-street, one of the\n\nmost Inspiring and majestic build-\n\nings In the city, will be dedicated\n\nand formally opened next week,\n\nwhen prominent Freemasons from\n\nall parts of the Commonwealth will\n\nbe present at the ceremonies.\n\nThe outside of a building does not\n\nnecessarily give an Indication of ita\n\ninterior; but in the case of the new\n\nTemple the noble exterior gives the\n\nkey-note to the magnificence of the\n\ninternal arrangements and handsome\n\nappointments. The finishing touches\n\nare now being put to the inside\n\ndecorations, and an official inspection\n\nwas made yesterday.\n\nThe facade of the building is im-\n\nmensely imposing, with its six fluted,\n\nmassive Corinthian columns, 5ft. In\n\ndiameter, rising base to summit of the\n\nthree-story structure, and the first\n\nglimpse obtained of the vestibule\n\nthrough the main entrance Is indeed\n\na striking one and a fitting introduc-\n\ntion to the splendour of the Grand\n\nLodge Room on the top floor. The\n\nmain entrance gives on to a circular\n\nvestibule, in the very centre of which\n\nis an immense urn of pinkish marble,\n\nmounted on a massive square pedestal\n\nof black marble. Inside the urn, in-\n\nvisible from the exterior, is a powerful\n\nelectric light, which throws its rays\n\nupwards, flooding the white canopy of\n\nceiling in a bath of soft white light.\n\nThe effect is inspiring to a degree. On\n\nthe black base are inscribed lines from\n\na verse by E. W. H. Fowles:\n\nBrethren beloved! your hearts or gold\n\nFrom us no time can sever;\n\nDauntless, you leapt to heights untold;\n\nDying, you live for ever.\n\nOpening out from the vestibule and\n\nfrom a corridor extending to the rear\n\nof the building are the executive\n\noffices, the board room, the Grand\n\nMaster's reception room, secretary's\n\noffice, and committee rooms. The\n\nboard room is a spacious chamber,\n\nwith a large table in the shape of a\n\nkeystone. The furnishings and ap-\n\npointments are of silky oak. The\n\nGrand Master's reception room Is\n\nhandsomely furnished in Queensland\n\nmaple, mahogany-stained, whilst the\n\nfloors of all the rooms are of par-\n\nquetry. The vestibule and corridors\n\nare paved with marble mosaic in the\n\nOld Roman style, which is decidedly\n\nartistic and most effective.\n\nUSEFUL LODGE ROOMS.\n\nThe first floor is devoted solely to\n\nlodge rooms, of which there are four.\n\nTwo of them are large rooms, capable\n\nof accommodating about 250 brethren,\n\nwhilst the smaller rooms have seating\n\ncapacity for about 80 each. Each\n\nlodge room has convenient dressing\n\nrooms attached. All the lodge rooms,\n\nas well as passages and dressing\n\nrooms, are furnished throughout in\n\nsilky oak, and the flooring is of par-\n\nquetry.\n\nThe second floor is entirely taken"
