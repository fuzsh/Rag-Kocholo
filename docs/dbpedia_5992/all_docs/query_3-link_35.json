        "text": "The arrival of Europeans in Cairns from the 1860s onwards inevitably led to Freemasonry’s introduction to the region, as Masonic activity was already ubiquitous in Queensland settler society.\n\nIn April 1886 the first Masonic Lodge was constituted in Cairns. After their regular meeting place was destroyed by a cyclone in 1927, Queensland architects Richard Hill and Arthur Taylor – both of whom are thought to be Freemasons – were contracted to create the Cairns Masonic Temple that was completed in 1935.\n\nThe temple was described as a “magnificent structure, combining the latest in architecture suitable to a tropical climate” by the Morning Bulletin. This impression was echoed by the Northern Herald on 5 October 1935:\n\n“A most imposing façade facing Minnie-street is flanked with two great Corinthian pillars carried out in terracotta and surmounted by two large electric lights. Huge bronze doors lead into the vestibule on the ground floor.\n\n“In view of the heat of the northern climate, special attention was given in the design to ventilation. Ducts from the external walls have been brought through under a raised platform around the lodge room and the air will be exhausted by using two big fans ensuring a continuous flow of fresh, cool air on even the most humid evenings.\n\n“Undoubtedly, the new temple is an acquisition to the architecture of Cairns and the fraternity of the district has every reason to feel proud of its new temple, which has been described as one of the most up-to-date and beautiful outside the metropolis.”\n\nThe former Cairns Masonic Temple is a two-storey, T-shaped building with concrete rendering and a low-pitched gabled roof.\n\nThe imposing façade is symmetrical and retains its original detailing, with the central stairs and recessed doorway flanked by two large Corinthian pillars. The entrance steps are made from terrazzo and covered by a cantilevered awning with a pressed metal ceiling.\n\nThe Main Hall is largely intact in its original condition, with three original entrance doorways including fanlights and hardware. The high waisted, four-panel double doors are finished in natural timber.\n\nThe Lodge Room on the upper floor was the meeting hall for each of the lodges associated with the Grand District of Carpentaria. The space is in similar proportions to the Main Hall below, although the detailing is much more elaborate and it retains significant furnishings.\n\nThis room features elevated, tiered seating, with the elevated Grand Master’s section to the rear. Original seating with blue cushions exists across the tiers, although the Grand Master’s chair has been removed. A checkered tile pattern is displayed on the floor in the middle of the Lodge Room.\n\nThe AHS team’s comparative analysis of other relevant sites confirmed that Cairns Masonic Temple follows a pattern of key design characteristics associated with Masonic lodges, to accommodate the rituals and traditional practices of Freemasonry.\n\nOur review of the current Queensland Heritage Register found that its significance was captured adequately and required no update apart from recognition that the ownership of the site has changed.\n\nNow that the site is no longer used by the Freemasons, there is an opportunity to have an interpretive display on site which could offer a brief history of Freemasonry in Cairns and showcase the significance of the building.\n\nContact us\n\nTo discover how we may be able to assist on your next project, contact us today here or phone (07) 3221 0000.
