        "text": "On the morning of 30 June 1860, a servant discovered the body of a little boy in the outside privy at Road Hill House in Wiltshire (now in Somerset), his throat cut.\n\nFrancis Savill Kent was 3 years old. He was the son of Samuel Savill Kent, a factory inspector, and his second wife, Mary Drewe Pratt. Mary had been governess to Samuel’s older children, and the couple had begun an adulterous relationship during the first Mrs Kent’s lifetime. When she died, they married, and Francis was their second child.\n\nThe mysterious murder set Victorian society aflutter. Some murders attract more attention than others, and the murder of little Francis hit all the right buttons: the death of an innocent child; a deeply dysfunctional middle class family; an increasingly literate general public with a thirst for gossipy scandal; and a new detective unit at Scotland Yard, that was called in by the local magistrates after the Wiltshire police got nowhere with the investigation.\n\nThe detective sent from London, Jonathan Whicher, had his suspicions, as did the magistrates, but they were unable to crack the wall of silence within Road Hill House, apparently instigated by Samuel Savill Kent.\n\nThen, 5 years later, Francis’s half-sister Constance confessed, claiming that at the age of 16, she and she alone had killed her little brother.

Maybe there’s a point to American, or British, or French, or Russian, or Iranian, or Israeli breast-beating over what is going on. I’m not so sure. I was in Belgrade a few weeks ago and saw the site of the NATO bombing in 1993. Did it really change anything on the ground?\n\nHere in Australia, though, there’s no point. We have no strategic interest in Syria, and even if we did, for good or bad we can have no impact on what is going on. Australia is a modest country, with much to be modest about – and thank goodness for that. I doubt if there are many Australians who want to join the Great Powers, especially on yet another expedition of gunboat diplomacy to the Middle East.\n\nUnfortunately, one of them is Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In the middle of an election campaign he is highly likely to lose, the ex-diplomat, ex-foreign minister, takes time out from cooking or campaigning to speak in sober, measured and above all pompous terms about his consultations with Barack Obama and David Cameron and – who knows? Ban Ki-moon?\n\nThe excuse for this self-importance is that Australia is currently one of the non-permanent members of the Security Council and this weekend takes over the rotating presidency. The real reason is that Rudd loves this sort of stuff.\n\nIt all feels to me a bit like ‘We warn the Tsar!’ Continue reading →\n\nMany countries have laws to protect any heritage objects in private hands from being sold out of the country. Recently the issue arose in Britain regarding a ring once owned by Jane Austen. Last year it was bought at a London auction by the American pop singer Kelly Clarkson, who naturally planned to take it home with her to America. The private owners have a right to sell their own property, but the British government stepped in to put a temporary export ban on the ring so that the British public would have time to raise the same amount of money (£152,450) to buy it for the Jane Austen Museum.\n\nNow Austen is British to her bootstraps. So British, in fact, that she has just become the new female face on the £10 note.\n\nBut what about a kangaroo?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn June 2009 I visited Salem, Massachusetts, for the World History Association conference. Salem was wonderful, and the conference so engrossing that we were perhaps the last people on earth to notice that Michael Jackson had just died.\n\nSalem was full of summer visitors, most of them there to see witches, and there were witches everywhere: rag dolls made into toothless crones, witches on broomsticks, witches with pointy hats, and memorably, witches made of black licorice. None bore much relationship to the characters in The Crucible, but nearly all the visitors were drawn to Salem by the play. Imagination, and enthusiastic marketing, did the rest.\n\nYet there’s so much more to Salem than the the 1692 witch trial. One of the privileges of history conferences is that there is often a guided tour given by someone who knows the history of the region, and we were taken on a walking tour by a PhD student who really knew her stuff. Nathaniel Hawthorne lived here while writing A Scarlet Letter, and the customs house where he worked still exists. Salem was an important port before the shipping trade moved to Boston in the 1820s and 1830s, and tea merchants coming back from China and the Pacific started the exotic collection of items that became the Peabody Essex Museum, the oldest in America.\n\nI’ve just been travelling in Romania. Last week I visited Bran Castle in Transylvania, universally but in accurately known as ‘Dracula’s Castle’. Bram Stoker modeled Dracula on Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia. Dracul, the family name, comes from ‘dragon’, though it also has an overtone of ‘devil’. Vlad ‘the Impaler’ was gruesome enough – he is said to have impaled a whole Turkish army on a forest of spikes. He may just possibly have spent a few months in his childhood at Bram Castle, but he bears very little resemblance to the toothy gentleman in an opera cloak of Hollywood films, just as the toothless crones of Salem bear little relationship to the real victims of the witch trial.\n\nCultural heritage and tourism can make for an uneasy mix. As a historian, I would like to think that visitors to a historical site go away knowing more about their history. The truth though is that many people prefer their history in bite-sized gobbets of stereotype, preferably with added blood and gore.\n\nIn Australia, many tourists are perfectly content to see a convict site like Port Arthur in terms of blood-soaked triangles and a cat-o’-nine-tails, rather than learn how the penitentiary system worked.\n\nAs a historian, I find this trivialization of important historical sites depressing, but I can see the appeal from the perspective of tour guides. Maybe in the end, as Jimmy Stewart says at the end of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, ‘When truth becomes legend, print the legend.’\n\nThe Queensland Art Gallery has a new exhibition, Quilts 1700-1945, which runs from 15 June to 22 September 2013. Most of the quilts come from the Victoria and Albert Museum, with a few from the Imperial War Museum, and the exhibition is billed as ‘200 years of British quiltmaking’, but there is also one important Australian quilt, the Rajah Quilt from the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nThe quilts show a mixture of decorative patchwork, embroidery, and collage. The earliest quilt dates from the 1690s; the last from the Second World War. I’d recommend the exhibition to anyone interested in textile history or women’s work or domestic decoration – though I confess that I’m always at a bit of a loss when it comes to deciding just where to draw the boundary between Art and Craft. For me, these pieces, lovely as they are, definitely fall on the ‘Craft’ side of that line.\n\nMy overwhelming feeling, coming out after a couple of hours, was sheer relief that I have never had to spend my time doing all that work! By hand! By candlelight! Yet I know people who love quilting, will happily spend time hand sewing patches, and take delight in the finished product. I’m afraid I’m just not one of those people.\n\nFor me, the pleasure of the show lay rather in the stories that lie behind many of these quilts. Continue reading →\n\nIt was about 30 years ago. I had been staying with friends in Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane. It was an overcast day in early winter, with only a few desultory surfers in the water, when 5 or 6 people arrived on the beach with a long net. Two of them waded out into the surf holding the net and dropped it into the water, enclosing about 10-15 metres between them.\n\nThen the whole group joined in to drag the net back to shore. It was hard work, for the net was brimming with frantic fish, swarming and jumping in the surf. They had caught hundreds, perhaps thousands, of sea mullet.\n\nLocals in the know turned up with buckets. They sold a lot on the beach and packed the rest in polystyrene boxes to sell later. They backed a 4WD on to the beach, packed away the catch, and were off before the Fish Marketing Board could know or intervene. From start to finish, the whole affair took less than an hour.
