        "text": "The public will soon have the chance to trek through Brisbane’s underground reservoirs, open up the secrets to the mysterious Masonic memorial centre, or go behind the scenes at Brisbane historic aerodrome.\n\nThe keys to all these mysterious buildings and more have been handed over to the public for the eighth annual Brisbane Open House weekend.\n\nMore than 90 venues are listed on the program, with about a third of them new in 2017, including the contentious government building at 1 William Street.\n\nQueensland government architect and event chairman Malcolm Middleton said the event would give people an opportunity to visit places they had always intended on seeing.\n\n“Open House gives you an excuse to allocate some time and go and visit some of the places you might normally be able to go to but never get around to it,” he said.\n\n“We find particularly for things like the Macarthur Museum, which is open in the city several days a week, the biggest day of the year is always Open House because people just decide to go.”\n\nBut he said the biggest drawcard to the event was the inquisitiveness of Brisbane residents.\n\n“People are always curious, you learn about your city, you understand your city better,” he said.\n\nHe said although the event had attracted more than 68,000 visits in the past year, there had never been any damage or vandalism from members of the public.\n\n“Worldwide we find people really do respect the ability to go into something they normally can’t go into or perhaps part of a building they can’t normally go into,” he said.\n\n“We’ve had absolutely no history of there being trouble at all, even in private homes.”\n\nBrisbane Open House '17 event manager Angie Scott said the event started as a part of a worldwide initiative.\n\n“The whole ethos behind Brisbane Open House started with Open House worldwide, which began in London quite a few years ago,” she said.\n\n“That was to have 50 cities across the world have open houses.\n\n“They’re all run independently but we’re all part of the same family.”\n\nMs Scott said the Masonic Memorial Centre was one of the most popular places.\n\n“This year I would recommend to go and see that because they’re going to be closing for refurbishment for the next three years,” she said.\n\n“So it’s your last opportunity to see that for quite a long time.\n\n“It’s a really beautiful temple and they’re just a really interesting organisation that I think traditionally has always been shrouded in mystery.\n\n“But actually they’re open-hearted people who open their doors every year and get thousands of people through, not just to see their building but to find out who they are and what they do.”\n\nArchitect Shaun Lockyer, who helped contemporise Ascot period home Monaise, said visitors should take the opportunity visit the houses on the list.\n\n“The houses are always very topical,” he said."
