It was designed by Eaton & Bates and built in 1903 by Newman Brothers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.\n\t\n\tThe Mount Morgan Masonic Temple was constructed in about 1903 to the design of Rockhampton architects, Eaton and Bates. The building was constructed by Newman Brothers for a cost of about £1500. The building supervisor was Scottish-born Thomas Glen Cornes (1842-1903), an 1888 foundation member of the Mount Morgan Masonic Lodge No. 763 S.C., its first elected Master in 1889 and superintendent of sawmills and carpenters at the famous Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited.\n\t\n\tThe township of Mount Morgan grew with the establishment of what was to become the richest gold mine in the world. Although small mining claims were made before 1882, the three Morgan Brothers pegged claims which encompassed most of the mountain top in that year. In July they formed a partnership with three Rockhampton businessmen before selling out to them 1886 when the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited was formed. The township quickly developed, establishing infrastructure for the rapidly increasing population. The company continued until 1929, when a new company and continued to produce gold and copper until it closed in 1990.\n\t\n\tDiscussions about forming a Masonic Lodge in Mount Morgan were held soon after the town was established in 1882, although it was not until 29 May 1888 that an official meeting with the purpose of forming a lodge was held. On June 17, 1888 a second meeting was held and a resolution was passed \"that a Masonic Lodge be formed in Mount Morgan under the Scottish Constitution\". On 4 August 1888 a Lodge was officially formed and the first meeting held in the local Oddfellows' Hall. The Lodge met in many different places and in 1896 passed a resolution \"that the lodge take into consideration the advisability of purchasing a piece of ground for the purpose of building a Masonic Hall\".\n\t\n\tAfter land in Gordon Street was secured in 1901, a competition was held for the design of the Masonic Temple. A newspaper article in the Queensland Times of Ipswich mentions that a Brisbane architect had been chosen, although Mr Haenke as runner up was to \"hold himself in readiness\" should the unnamed Brisbane architect be unable to reduce the scope of his design to the budget of about £1000. However, on 10 August 1901 the Lodge met again and reconsidered the tenders, deciding that the design of Messrs Eaton and Bates of Rockhampton was the most appropriate. An article in the Rockhampton Times of 1903 states:\n\t\n\tThe building is a handsome structure of brick, two stories high and with a composite front. The lower portion of the hall may be used as a dining room and made available for dancing and other functions. The cost was £1500, and was erected by Newman Bros of Rockhampton under supervision of TG Cornes, from the plan of Messrs Eaton and Bates, who were the successful architects when competitive designs were called.\n\t\n\tEaton and Bates were a partnership of George Thomas Eaton and Albert Edmund Bates who opened an office in Rockhampton in 1894 and following success, opened branch offices throughout Central Queensland. The partnership were responsible for many buildings throughout Queensland including a large number of hotels and other commercial buildings.\n\t\n\tA small kitchen extension has been added towards the rear, and there is a two-storey concrete block addition to the side. These do not impinge on the original section of the building, which is very intact.",
