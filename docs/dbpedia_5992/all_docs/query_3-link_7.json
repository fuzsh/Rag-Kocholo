        "text": "The building is dedicated to Freemasons who gave their lives in World War 1 and the urn is a war\n\nmemorial used on ANZAC Day.\n\nAn incredible space used by Freemasons for their ceremonies. It features furniture created on site made of Queensland timbers, symbolic decor and gold-leaf embellishments. The hall underwent a renovation in the late 1900s.\n\nThe magnificent organ is the fifth largest in Queensland and the choir loft caters for 32 choristers\n\nMade in the 1890s, the clock was originally used in the Alice Street Temple, which was the\n\nMasonic meeting place until 1930. The wooden housing was carved from a single tree trunk of\n\nnorthern silky oak."
