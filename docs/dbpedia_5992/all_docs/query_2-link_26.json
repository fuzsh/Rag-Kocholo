        "text": "Home-like maternity bereavement suite supports grieving families\n\nThe trauma of losing a baby at birth is heightened when families have to stay in a hospital’s maternity ward surrounded by other families with healthy babies.\n\nNow grieving families in the Moreton Bay region can stay in Redcliffe Hospital’s Jacaranda suite, a dedicated home-like maternity bereavement suite – giving them the space to grieve and receive specialised care in private, away from the maternity ward.\n\nThe local Tynwald Freemasons Lodge and Hand Heart Pocket contributed $13,228 towards the initiative alongside other community groups and local businesses, helping with the fit-out of the two-bed space.\n\nTynwald Freemasons Lodge representative Ross Angel and his wife welcomed their first child in 2021, a healthy baby girl, now 18 months old. Grateful for the care they received, Mr Angel rallied his Lodge to fundraise for this cause.\n\n“As a Lodge we felt it was important to support local families in this way,” Mr Angel said.\n\n“We recently met with Hospital staff and saw the new Jacaranda suite for the first time. When you’ve contributed to something so tangible it really does move you.\n\n“The families that will use this new space will be experiencing immense sadness and we hope this space will be of some comfort to them, giving them privacy as they receive the care they need.\n\n“Not all hospitals have a maternity bereavement suite. If this is something your local area needs, Tynwald Lodge encourages Lodges to think about working with other local community groups to fund a similar initiative in your area,” Mr Angel said.\n\n“I would also like to thank Hand Heart Pocket for supporting us with this initiative.”\n\nHand Heart Pocket Chief Executive Officer Sara Parrott said over the last year, the Freemasons of Queensland have continued to make a positive impact in communities across the state.\n\n“In 2021-22, with the support of Hand Heart Pocket our Members gave over $460,000 to the causes that matter to them in their community,” Ms Parrott said.\n\n“By matching the Lodge’s giving, we were able to help bring this important local initiative to fruition. Showing compassion towards local families who have suffered a heartbreaking loss, with a dedicated space within the hospital while they receive medical care is incredibly important and we thank Tynwald Freemasons Lodge for bringing this to our attention,” she said.\n\nQueensland’s housing crisis is very real. Just ask Waveny Holland, the wife of the Immediate Past Grand Master, Paul Holland.\n\nRecently both Paul and Waveny visited Sheltered by Grace, a homeless shelter in Logan City to handover a cheque for $2,910 to support the running of the service.\n\n“Being face-to-face with people facing this reality, as well as those that are doing their best to help, really puts into perspective what we’ve all been hearing on the news lately about Queensland’s housing crisis,” Waveny said.\n\nIntake has increased by 75% at the shelter compared to last year.\n\n“The people we met were so resilient in the face of such adversity. But the need is very real. I’m pleased we were able to make a difference, even in a small way.”\n\nWaveny isn’t new to supporting the homeless. In 2019, when her husband Paul was installed as Grand Master – the highest ranking Freemason in the State – Waveny thought long and hard about the causes she wanted to get behind during his term. She kept coming back to the homeless and did her research to find a small organisation where her fundraising would have a bigger impact.\n\nPrior to the pandemic Waveny raised much needed funds which were matched by Hand Heart Pocket to a total of $5,160 and donated it to Sheltered by Grace, her charity of choice. This enabled the charity to purchase a stove and oven for the communal kitchen. It meant they could cook for all the residents at once, which they couldn’t do with the small stove they had previously.\n\nThis latest donation was kindly donated by Grand Lodge instead of a present for the retiring Grand Master. From time to time she has also provided around $2,000 worth of new men’s and women’s underwear, socks, leggings, slippers, thongs, toiletries and personal grooming products for the residents, donated by her friends and contacts.\n\n“Both Paul and I are appreciative of everyone that has supported me in my community work, the Freemasons and the public have been incredibly generous,” she said. Hand Heart Pocket Chief Executive Officer Sara Parrott commended Waveny on her commitment to community.\n\n“Waveny has set a wonderful example for us all. While homelessness continues to be a statewide issue, we can all do something to help at a local level,” Sara said.\n\n“We empower the Freemasons of Queensland to get behind the causes that matter to them in their community by matching their giving and volunteering. If you’ve identified a community service in your area that directly helps the homeless and you want to help, then contact us to match your efforts,” she said.\n\nOver the last year, the Freemasons of Queensland have continued to make a positive impact in communities across the state. In 2021-22, with the support of Hand Heart Pocket our Members gave over $460,000 to the causes that matter to them in their community.\n\nFind out more about Hand Heart Pocket’s Matched Giving Program\n\nToowoomba members of the world’s oldest fraternal society will throw open its doors in a bid to shed their mysterious image and attract a new generation of community-minded men.\n\nFourteen Masonic Lodges, home to the region’s Freemasons, will hold a joint open day on Saturday December 14 for curious residents from across the Downs including Toowoomba, Forest Hill, Gatton, Crows Nest, Pittsworth, Oakey, Jondaryan, Millmerran, Clifton and Dalby.\n\nThe Freemasons are a global fraternity that dates to the 1500s medieval stonemasons who built castles and cathedrals. The first Queensland Lodge opened in 1859 and membership is currently 5,000 across 250 Lodges throughout Queensland. “Today, we are active in most towns and regions, in the city and bush, mentoring men and working to lead and support community initiatives that change lives for the better,” Grand Master Paul Holland said. “Despite many misapprehensions, we are not a religion, a cult or a conspiracy. Nor do we have any sinister motives or practices,” Mr Holland said. “Our values are non-denominational, ethical and based on deep respect for every human being.” “Much of the secrecy of former times has gone and you’ll find Freemasons are just ordinary men willing to speak about their values and ready to lend a helping hand,” he said.\n\nMembers range in age from 18 to mid 90s and all share a commitment to personal development and community service. “When you become a Freemason, you join a long tradition of world leaders and great men in many fields who found inspiration and support in this organisation,” Mr Holland said. “You are embraced into a fellowship that genuinely cares for each of its embers and wants to see them excel and meet life’s challenges with strength and integrity,” he said. Charity is at the heart of Freemasonry, and the Toowoomba Freemasons work with their charity Hand Heart Pocket the Charity of Freemasons Queensland to make a bigger difference in their local community.\n\nOver the past five years, Hand Heart Pocket has provided over $11 million in grants and in-kind support to other non-profit organisations including grants to YellowBridge QLD, Vanguard Laundry Services and the Toowoomba Hospice to name a few. The charity work of Freemasons across Queensland was recognised earlier this year with Hand Heart Pocket receiving the inaugural Queensland Community Foundation's Board of Governors' Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Philanthropy of the Year Awards.\n\nThe Masonic Information Afternoon will be held on Saturday 14 December from 3.30pm at the Toowoomba Masonic Centre at 58 Neil Street. Guests are encouraged to RSVP for catering purposes by 11 December to smlodge393@gmail.com or 0427 697 365. All men over 18 years from across the Downs are warmly invited to come along, meet current Freemasons and learn more about the organisation.\n\nMEDIA ENQUIRIES: Heather Smith, 0403 462 686, heather@wishbone.com.au\n\nThe process for becoming a Freemason in Queensland is for a man to approach a Freemason and request a set of application papers. Several interviews are conducted, and perhaps the applicant will be invited to several festive boards (Dinners) In order to meet the potential candidate and gain an insight into his character. Once the Lodge is satisfied that he is a person of good character, the application process is carried and is balloted for – i.e., voted on – and if successful, he is declared a candidate for initiation. As a candidate he must complete three degrees; the First Second and Third, also known as Initiation, Passing and Raising respectively. He then becomes a Master Mason and is entitled to take on work within the lodge and be elected to an office. He is then known as a Brother\n\nThe Lodge is composed of Officers and members of the Lodge. As an Officer, he usually begins as a Steward and progresses through the offices to become the Master of the Lodge. The Master equates to being the President in other organisations. His Masonic title then changes to Worshipful Brother (Wor. Bro)– a title he retains until he obtains a position in the United Grand Lodge of Queensland, or the District Grand Lodges in Queensland where his title may change to VW Brother. Once he has served his term or terms as Master of a Lodge, he becomes a Past Master and he and the other Past Masters may take office in the Lodge or act as advisors to the Master.\n\nA man may also choose to take Office in the United Grand Lodge of Queensland and work his way through the offices to become The Grand Master. There is only one Grand Master at a time; he is assisted by a Deputy Grand Master, and an Assistant Grand Master to undertake the work required. It is the Grand Master’s job to oversee the administration of all Lodges in Queensland. Thus, a Freemason may have the honour of being the Master of his Lodge, but as there were at one time over 500 Lodges in Queensland, the number of Grand Masters is relatively small.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries many men chose to remain a Master Mason, a member of the Lodge and did not take an office in the Lodge. This was particularly the case when the Lodges had large numbers of members and it took a great many years for a position to become available. Additionally, many men chose for family and work reasons not to take office but enjoyed the companionship and personal development being a member of a Lodge provides. This is still the case today. It was and is very common for men not to be life-long members of Freemasonry and for their membership to lapse due to a number of reasons. This could include other family and work matters taking priority, a change of residence or financial issues. A member may resign from Freemasonry at any time. In the case of financial issues if a man does not or cannot pay his lodge dues, he is struck off the roll of members, but can re-join at any time if he makes restitution.\n\nMasonic rank is the representation of the individual’s status in the Lodge or in Grand Lodge. In the District Grand Lodges of North Queensland and Carpentaria and United Grand Lodge the members have what are called District Grand Rank or Grand Rank. Rank may be of two sorts; active Grand Rank and conferred Grand Rank. Active Grand Rank is that held by members who actually hold an Office in District Grand Lodge or Grand Lodge. Conferred Grand Rank is given to members who have not held Grand Office or (mostly due to distance) have not been able to hold a Grand Office but have made a significant contribution to Freemasonry in general. Such rank takes the form of a title as such as Past Grand “Office-bearer” and the rank may rise from Past Grand Pursuivant to Past Deputy Grand Master. So, a member with the title of Past Assistant Grand Master may have actually served the office of Assistant Grand Master or he may have been conferred the rank of Past Assistant Grand Master.\n\nThe Rank of Past Grand Master was conferred during the early history of the United Grand Lodge of Queensland; however, this was discontinued by resolution of the Grand Masters of Australasia, some years ago. Thus, these days, only members who have served the Office of Grand Master may have the rank of Past Grand Master.\n\nThe Library and Museum at Freemasons Queensland is currently closed for family history research while we prepare for renovations. During this time, we are also working on our indexes and archival finding aids so that we can provide accurate information to researchers. Here are some hints to help you find information about your Masonic connection while we are closed. When we reopen, having background information will also help us find more information if you require it.\n\nTo begin - we only hold records of membership relating to Freemasons in Queensland and Papua New Guinea. We do not hold information about partners of our members or their children. Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation. There is no overarching Australian organisation - Freemasonry in Australia is composed of state-based organisations. There is no world body for Freemasonry, it is organised on a national or state or provincial base depending on the country. We use the term Freemasons Queensland to describe our operations, but our formal title is The United Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Queensland - shorted to UGLQ or Grand Lodge.\n\nBefore the United Grand Lodge of Freemasons of Queensland was formed in 1921 Freemasonry in Queensland was governed by what are known as District Grand Lodges administered by the countries from which the particular form of Freemasonry originated. In Queensland, these were the United Grand Lodges of England, Grand Lodge of Ireland and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which are separate organisations - we refer to these as jurisdictions. From 1904 to 1921 two Queensland Grand Lodges also administered Freemasonry in this State. These Queensland Lodges were the Grand Lodge of Queensland and Queensland Grand Lodge. Even though they were administered from overseas, records relating to the administration and membership are held from 1859. This means you do not necessarily have to look overseas for your connection’s details.\n\nLike all family and genealogical research, it is important to know the dates of birth and death of your connection so that you can research them using the sources available outside Freemasons Queensland.\n\nSo where can you look for information?\n\nAncestry.com has digitised and indexed the membership rolls of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Ireland until up until 1921. These can be searched only through a UK Heritage or World Heritage subscription to Ancestry.com. If you do not have a subscription these records are available through the Library edition of Ancestry which may be available at your State or local library. To search for your connection, use your person's name and the keyword Lodge and you may find an entry. You can also use the Card Catalogue search - Type in Lodge in the Keyword box - select England or Ireland and then search by name and location. This may tell you when they first joined Freemasonry and under which jurisdiction.\n\nUse Trove to link your person's name with search terms such as Freemason, Masonic, Lodge and a locality for example Davis Yungaburra and Lodge will find the obituary of Charles Davis a founding member of Barrine Lodge at Yungaburra in Far North Queensland. Up until the 1960s there were frequent mentions of Freemasonry in the press so don't presume that there will be nothing. A very useful source can be Funeral Notices which may have a separate notice inserted by the local Lodge and this will provide more information on where your connection might have attended Lodge.\n\nCheck your family papers and photographs - is there a Certificate that gives the name of the Lodge, are there any clues in the family papers as to what organisations your person may have belonged to. If your person had an apron or what we call Masonic jewels (but look like medals), there may be information on the back of the jewel which will help you.\n\nOnce you have found the locality of the Lodge your connection may have belonged to, check the relevant local history collection which may have a copy of the Lodge anniversary publication. Individual lodges often published Lodge histories at significant anniversaries of their founding such as 50th, 75th, 100th and following anniversaries.\n\nUnited Grand Lodge of Queensland produces a magazine. This is variously called “The Ashlar” or “The Queensland Freemason” and copies are held at the State Library of Queensland although the holdings are not complete. The issues of the magazine may contain items about individuals or Lodges which will help give context to your connection’s involvement in Freemasonry.\n\nSome points to be aware of -\n\nThere were many organisations besides Freemasonry which used the term Lodge and Brother these include International Order of Oddfellows (IOOF), Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffalos known as RAOB or the Buffs, Good Templars or the Ancient Order of Foresters. Even though you might find sources which mention the word Brother or Lodge it does not mean your person was a Freemason. If there are family photos of people with people with aprons, sashes or other regalia they could be members of other Fraternal or Friendly societies so you may have to do some research using photos from large collections such as the State Library of Queensland.\n\nYour person may have belonged to Freemasonry in another state or country so you may have to contact other jurisdictions. They will advise you how to go about searching in their records.\n\nFor further information on Freemasonry in Queensland we have listed the following sources which may be available at your local library or at the State Library of Queensland, State Libraries in your state and the National Library.\n\nIntroductory Materials\n\nLauder Dave Freemasonry and Freemasons in Queensland Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland Vol IV No 1 February 1990 pp 33- 41\n\nIt's no Secret: Real Men wear Aprons The story of Freemasonry in Australia, Masonic Care Sydney, 2010\n\nFreemasons Queensland website\n\nFreemasonry in Queensland\n\nThe history of Freemasonry in Queensland until 1959 The Centennial Story : The history of Freemasonry in Queensland Australia over the first One Hundred Years 1859 - 1959.

The charity work of Freemasons across Queensland was recognised earlier this year with Hand Heart Pocket receiving the inaugural Queensland Community Foundation's Board of Governors' Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Philanthropy of the Year Awards.\n\nThe Masonic Information Afternoon will be held on Saturday 14 December from 3.30pm at the Toowoomba Masonic Centre at 58 Neil Street. Guests are encouraged to RSVP for catering purposes by 11 December to smlodge393@gmail.com or 0427 697 365. All men over 18 years from across the Downs are warmly invited to come along, meet current Freemasons and learn more about the organisation.\n\nMEDIA ENQUIRIES: Heather Smith, 0403 462 686, heather@wishbone.com.au\n\nThe process for becoming a Freemason in Queensland is for a man to approach a Freemason and request a set of application papers. Several interviews are conducted, and perhaps the applicant will be invited to several festive boards (Dinners) In order to meet the potential candidate and gain an insight into his character. Once the Lodge is satisfied that he is a person of good character, the application process is carried and is balloted for – i.e., voted on – and if successful, he is declared a candidate for initiation. As a candidate he must complete three degrees; the First Second and Third, also known as Initiation, Passing and Raising respectively. He then becomes a Master Mason and is entitled to take on work within the lodge and be elected to an office. He is then known as a Brother\n\nThe Lodge is composed of Officers and members of the Lodge. As an Officer, he usually begins as a Steward and progresses through the offices to become the Master of the Lodge. The Master equates to being the President in other organisations. His Masonic title then changes to Worshipful Brother (Wor. Bro)– a title he retains until he obtains a position in the United Grand Lodge of Queensland, or the District Grand Lodges in Queensland where his title may change to VW Brother. Once he has served his term or terms as Master of a Lodge, he becomes a Past Master and he and the other Past Masters may take office in the Lodge or act as advisors to the Master.\n\nA man may also choose to take Office in the United Grand Lodge of Queensland and work his way through the offices to become The Grand Master. There is only one Grand Master at a time; he is assisted by a Deputy Grand Master, and an Assistant Grand Master to undertake the work required. It is the Grand Master’s job to oversee the administration of all Lodges in Queensland. Thus, a Freemason may have the honour of being the Master of his Lodge, but as there were at one time over 500 Lodges in Queensland, the number of Grand Masters is relatively small.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries many men chose to remain a Master Mason, a member of the Lodge and did not take an office in the Lodge. This was particularly the case when the Lodges had large numbers of members and it took a great many years for a position to become available. Additionally, many men chose for family and work reasons not to take office but enjoyed the companionship and personal development being a member of a Lodge provides. This is still the case today. It was and is very common for men not to be life-long members of Freemasonry and for their membership to lapse due to a number of reasons. This could include other family and work matters taking priority, a change of residence or financial issues. A member may resign from Freemasonry at any time. In the case of financial issues if a man does not or cannot pay his lodge dues, he is struck off the roll of members, but can re-join at any time if he makes restitution.\n\nMasonic rank is the representation of the individual’s status in the Lodge or in Grand Lodge. In the District Grand Lodges of North Queensland and Carpentaria and United Grand Lodge the members have what are called District Grand Rank or Grand Rank. Rank may be of two sorts; active Grand Rank and conferred Grand Rank. Active Grand Rank is that held by members who actually hold an Office in District Grand Lodge or Grand Lodge. Conferred Grand Rank is given to members who have not held Grand Office or (mostly due to distance) have not been able to hold a Grand Office but have made a significant contribution to Freemasonry in general. Such rank takes the form of a title as such as Past Grand “Office-bearer” and the rank may rise from Past Grand Pursuivant to Past Deputy Grand Master. So, a member with the title of Past Assistant Grand Master may have actually served the office of Assistant Grand Master or he may have been conferred the rank of Past Assistant Grand Master.\n\nThe Rank of Past Grand Master was conferred during the early history of the United Grand Lodge of Queensland; however, this was discontinued by resolution of the Grand Masters of Australasia, some years ago. Thus, these days, only members who have served the Office of Grand Master may have the rank of Past Grand Master.\n\nThe Library and Museum at Freemasons Queensland is currently closed for family history research while we prepare for renovations. During this time, we are also working on our indexes and archival finding aids so that we can provide accurate information to researchers. Here are some hints to help you find information about your Masonic connection while we are closed. When we reopen, having background information will also help us find more information if you require it.\n\nTo begin - we only hold records of membership relating to Freemasons in Queensland and Papua New Guinea. We do not hold information about partners of our members or their children. Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation. There is no overarching Australian organisation - Freemasonry in Australia is composed of state-based organisations. There is no world body for Freemasonry, it is organised on a national or state or provincial base depending on the country. We use the term Freemasons Queensland to describe our operations, but our formal title is The United Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Queensland - shorted to UGLQ or Grand Lodge.\n\nBefore the United Grand Lodge of Freemasons of Queensland was formed in 1921 Freemasonry in Queensland was governed by what are known as District Grand Lodges administered by the countries from which the particular form of Freemasonry originated. In Queensland, these were the United Grand Lodges of England, Grand Lodge of Ireland and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, which are separate organisations - we refer to these as jurisdictions. From 1904 to 1921 two Queensland Grand Lodges also administered Freemasonry in this State. These Queensland Lodges were the Grand Lodge of Queensland and Queensland Grand Lodge. Even though they were administered from overseas, records relating to the administration and membership are held from 1859. This means you do not necessarily have to look overseas for your connection’s details.\n\nLike all family and genealogical research, it is important to know the dates of birth and death of your connection so that you can research them using the sources available outside Freemasons Queensland.\n\nSo where can you look for information?\n\nAncestry.com has digitised and indexed the membership rolls of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Ireland until up until 1921. These can be searched only through a UK Heritage or World Heritage subscription to Ancestry.com. If you do not have a subscription these records are available through the Library edition of Ancestry which may be available at your State or local library. To search for your connection, use your person's name and the keyword Lodge and you may find an entry. You can also use the Card Catalogue search - Type in Lodge in the Keyword box - select England or Ireland and then search by name and location. This may tell you when they first joined Freemasonry and under which jurisdiction.\n\nUse Trove to link your person's name with search terms such as Freemason, Masonic, Lodge and a locality for example Davis Yungaburra and Lodge will find the obituary of Charles Davis a founding member of Barrine Lodge at Yungaburra in Far North Queensland. Up until the 1960s there were frequent mentions of Freemasonry in the press so don't presume that there will be nothing. A very useful source can be Funeral Notices which may have a separate notice inserted by the local Lodge and this will provide more information on where your connection might have attended Lodge.\n\nCheck your family papers and photographs - is there a Certificate that gives the name of the Lodge, are there any clues in the family papers as to what organisations your person may have belonged to. If your person had an apron or what we call Masonic jewels (but look like medals), there may be information on the back of the jewel which will help you.\n\nOnce you have found the locality of the Lodge your connection may have belonged to, check the relevant local history collection which may have a copy of the Lodge anniversary publication. Individual lodges often published Lodge histories at significant anniversaries of their founding such as 50th, 75th, 100th and following anniversaries.\n\nUnited Grand Lodge of Queensland produces a magazine. This is variously called “The Ashlar” or “The Queensland Freemason” and copies are held at the State Library of Queensland although the holdings are not complete. The issues of the magazine may contain items about individuals or Lodges which will help give context to your connection’s involvement in Freemasonry.\n\nSome points to be aware of -\n\nThere were many organisations besides Freemasonry which used the term Lodge and Brother these include International Order of Oddfellows (IOOF), Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffalos known as RAOB or the Buffs, Good Templars or the Ancient Order of Foresters. Even though you might find sources which mention the word Brother or Lodge it does not mean your person was a Freemason. If there are family photos of people with people with aprons, sashes or other regalia they could be members of other Fraternal or Friendly societies so you may have to do some research using photos from large collections such as the State Library of Queensland.\n\nYour person may have belonged to Freemasonry in another state or country so you may have to contact other jurisdictions. They will advise you how to go about searching in their records.\n\nFor further information on Freemasonry in Queensland we have listed the following sources which may be available at your local library or at the State Library of Queensland, State Libraries in your state and the National Library.\n\nIntroductory Materials\n\nLauder Dave Freemasonry and Freemasons in Queensland Journal of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland Vol IV No 1 February 1990 pp 33- 41\n\nIt's no Secret: Real Men wear Aprons The story of Freemasonry in Australia, Masonic Care Sydney, 2010\n\nFreemasons Queensland website\n\nFreemasonry in Queensland\n\nThe history of Freemasonry in Queensland until 1959 The Centennial Story : The history of Freemasonry in Queensland Australia over the first One Hundred Years 1859 - 1959.
