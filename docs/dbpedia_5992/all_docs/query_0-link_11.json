        "meta_description": "This two storey timber and stucco building was constructed as the Masonic Temple at Norman Park in 1927. It was built on land acquired by Trustees of the Norman Park Lodge in 1925 and was officially dedicated and consecrated on 28 July 1927. The hall served the local masonic community for over fifty years before being sold to the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, in 1978. The Order added a block work extension to the building in 1989.",

        "text": "Although the first residential subdivisions took place in Norman Park during the 1880s and the tramline arrived in 1904, the area remained mostly farmland until after World War I. Early surviving houses at Norman Park include ‘Rose Hill’ (circa 1896), ‘Lozelles’ (circa 1888) and ‘Eulalia’ (1889) which was part of the Early Street Historical Village from 1965 to the late 1990s. Residential development increased during the interwar years, encouraged by the opening of the Norman Park railway station in 1911. As the population grew, community buildings such as the Methodist Church (1917) and the Anglican Church of the Transfiguration (1925) were built.\n\nFreemasonry had its beginnings in medieval England with the formation of lodges of skilled stonemasons. By the early eighteenth century, men who were not stonemasons were admitted and the first Grand Lodge was established. Freemasonry was established in Queensland in 1859, although the Queensland lodges operated under the ultimate authority of the Grand Master of New South Wales until well into the twentieth century.\n\nThe first Masonic Lodge in Brisbane was built on the corner of Albert and Ann Streets in 1866 and served as the centre for Queensland freemasonry until a larger temple was constructed in Alice Street in 1886. (Both have since been demolished). Many of Brisbane’s most influential men, including John Petrie, the first Mayor of Brisbane, and Sir Charles Lilley, Premier of Queensland and champion of free education, were active masons. Lodges were established under the English, Irish and Scottish constitutions and it was not until 1921 that the United Grand Lodge was formed in Brisbane uniting 281 lodges. The imposing Masonic Temple in Ann Street, designed by Lange Powell, was opened in 1930, replacing the Alice Street Temple.\n\nThe Norman Park Lodge was established in 1923. Members used the local Presbyterian Church for meetings while plans were made to construct their own temple. In 1925, the Lodge acquired three 16 perch allotments (1214m²) in Norman Avenue. Members of the Lodge provided an interest free loan to cover the expense of building the temple which was expected to cost £1,500 to £1,800.\n\nAccording to the Brisbane Courier, the stump capping ceremony held on 19 February 1927 was attended by “a large gathering of Masons, including many interstate visitors”. Each of the fifty stumps received a specially constructed metal cap and donations totalling £40 were placed under the caps by various donors. The first stump was ceremoniously capped by the Grand Master Brother C. Stumm. The remaining stumps were capped by members of the Norman Park Lodge, visiting masons and Mrs J. Bothwell and Mrs A. T. Atherton. The new temple was to be built and furnished by a father and three sons, all of whom were members of the Norman Park Lodge. On 28 July 1927, the Grand Master returned to officiate at a dedication and consecration ceremony for the new temple.\n\nIn addition to providing a venue for masonic meetings and rituals, the Norman Park Masonic Temple was used to hold social events. For example, on 8 March 1930, a dance and musical evening was held at the hall to raise extra building funds. In 1961, the Brisbane City Council approved an addition to the site which is likely to be the timber section at the rear of the building on the southern side.\n\nThe masonic temple was damaged in the severe flooding of 1974, prompting the Norman Park Masonic Lodge to sell the site to the Rosicrucian Order AMORC (Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis), a non-profit, educational and spiritual organisation. Although the titles were transferred in 1978 to the Rosicrucian Order, financial settlement did not occur until 1981.\n\nThe Order carried out extensive repairs to the flood damaged building that included reinforcing the first floor with steel girders. The members of the Order continued to use the upper floor as a temple, modifying the interior to fit their requirements and adding various paintings and symbols. There is no visible evidence in the temple of any original Masonic insignia. In 1989, the Rosacrucians built a two storey block work addition on the western side of the building.\n\nThe former masonic temple at Norman Park is one of several surviving pre-World War II Masonic halls entered on the Brisbane City Planning Heritage Register. Others include those at Sandgate (1889), Taringa (1902) and Wynnum (1920).\n\nThe Norman Park Masonic Temple provides evidence of the expansion of the Masonic movement in Brisbane during the Interwar period. Under the ownership of the Rosacrucian Order, it continues to operate as a place of ritual. It is one of several surviving pre-World War II Masonic temples entered on the Brisbane City Heritage Register."
