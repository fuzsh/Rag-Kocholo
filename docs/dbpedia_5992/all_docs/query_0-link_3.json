        "text": "In his Modern Architecture since 1900 (1982 ff.) William J.R. Curtis attempts to present a \"balanced, readable overall view of the development of modern architecture from its beginning until the recent past\" and to include the architecture of the non-western world, a subject overlooked by previous histories of modern architecture. Curtis places authenticityat the core of his research and uses it as the criterion to assess the historicity of modern architecture. While the second edition (1987) of Curtis's book appeared with just an addendum, for the third edition (1996) he undertook a full revision, expansion and reorganisation of the content. The new edition, it will be posited, does present a more 'authentic' account of the development of modern architecture in other parts of the world, presenting a comprehensive view of Australian architecture. Compared to the additions and modifications of other post-colonial examples, there is scant difference in Curtis' account of Australian modern architecture between the first (1982) and the third (1996) editions. Even in the third edition (1996) the main reference to Australian modern architecture is confined to the Sydney Opera House as well as a brief commentary of the work of Harry Seidler, Peter Muller, Peter Johnson, Rick Leplastrier and Glenn Murcutt. In the years separating the two editions, regionalism in architecture was debated and framed in different ways by Paul Rudolph, Kenneth Frampton and Curtis, among others. In analysing the absence of Australian architecture as a 'golden' example of regionalism, this paper presents a critical overview of Curtis' understanding of the notion of an ‘authentic’ regionalism.\n\nIn response to changes in both the practice of architecture and changes in terms of architecture's field of operation: the global economic, political and cultural context of its production, the following paper proposes to re-examine the inherited unit system of the graduate educational M.Arch design studio. Contrary to 'alternate modes of practice' that propose in critiquing the profession, an abandonment of the discipline of architecture, this paper instead calls for a clarified return in the educational context to architecture's core material an spatial skill set redirected relative to the animating diagrammatic condition that since the 19th century has relied on architecture's capacities in material and organisational experimentation to build cities.\n\nThe distinctive timber and iron house of Queensland, has evolved over time reflecting the culture of the local people and the climate of the region. These houses are currently facing major pressures due to gentrification and development in the older inner city suburbs of Brisbane. The key objective of the paper is to examine the major planning issues and opportunities for the continuation of vernacular traditions. This paper first discusses the historical development of &#39;Queenslander&#39; house focussing on some of its key architectural features and their suitability for the local climate. It then reviews policy documents of the Brisbane City Council (BCC) to identify the key planning issues relating to vernacular architecture. Lastly, it identifies the key opportunities to enhance the vernacular architecture in Brisbane. While there is generally a good community and council support for protection of vernacular architecture, there are issues relating to perceiving them as a hind..."
