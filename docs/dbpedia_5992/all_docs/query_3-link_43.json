They first meet at Sandgate Baptist Church and was well accompanied by the congregation, which is revealing in that fundamentalist versions of the Baptist Church from the early twentieth century saw freemasonry as a chief element in a grand satanic conspiracy. By 1920 the Lodge was able to own its Masonic Hall by the purchase of the former Webster Bakery building.\n\nCitations\n\nKowald, Margaret. with Val Donovan, Ruth Kerr, Kay Cohen, Lyndsay Smith, and Jean Stewart.
