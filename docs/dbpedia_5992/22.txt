This stately brick home was built in 1923 for prominent Brisbane architect, Lange Powell. The home was designed by Powell who adopted the Georgian Revival style. Powell is best known for his work in designing some of Brisbane’s grandest buildings including the Masonic Temple and St. Martins Hospital in Ann Street and Perry House in Elizabeth Street. The home not only reflects Powell’s skill in architectural design, it also makes a strong contribution to the Eldernell Terrace streetscape.
