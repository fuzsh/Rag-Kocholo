Urapopstar Wiki

Urapopstar Wiki is a resource centre for the online game Urapopstar (also known as URAPS). Urapopstar is a multiplayer browser-based role-playing game that emulates the popular music industry with virtual popstars, record labels and a record chart. It was created by British teenager Robert Black in around February 2001. Members usually pick a "model" for their acts – most commonly a famous singer, musical group or actor – then assign them a name. Generally, the "PR" will create their own artwork (such as promotional banners, album covers, and other forms or marketing) and write their own song lyrics. They will then use the Urapopstar forum to promote their act by posting their lyrics, news stories, music videos, and so on. Urapopstar is currently run by Azriel, although it has seen a number of administrators over the years.
