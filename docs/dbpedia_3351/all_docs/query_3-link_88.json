        "text": "Congressman Henry Cuellar (TX-28) announced $4,493,538 in federal funds for Atascosa Health Center, Inc. on Thursday in Pleasanton.\n\nThe funds are from the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Health Center Cluster Grant Program. These funds will ensure that the seven Atascosa Health Center clinics can continue to deliver their vital services to our communities.\n\n“Congressman Cuellar is a leader, he is there for us, he fights for us and he makes sure we have all the resources needed,” said Atascosa Health Center CEO Monty Small. “Without him, we would not be where we are today.”\n\nAHC serves patients in Atascosa, McMullen, Live Oak, Wilson and Karnes Counties. Last year, AHC provided over 53,000 visits from 18,000 patients.\n\n“Everybody knows that this clinic is so important,” said Congressman Cuellar. “This is one area that we find bipartisan support. These funds are important for AHC to render operations. To all the healthcare providers, I thank each of you.”\n\nAHC offers family medicine, pediatric care, senior care, dental care and behavioral care. About 435 veterans are also provided healthcare.\n\n“This generous donation is not just a financial contribution, it is a testament to the corroborative spirit that inclines our community,” said Pleasanton Mayor JR Gallegos. “We understand the critical role Atascosa Health Center plays in our community. Congressman, your dedication to the well-being of our constituents does not go unnoticed. Your efforts have a profound impact on the lives of many.”"
