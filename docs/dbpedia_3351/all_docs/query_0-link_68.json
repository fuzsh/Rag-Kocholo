        "text": "Longtime Democratic Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar was indicted by the Department of Justice on charges of conspiracy and bribery in connection with an investigation between U.S. businesses and Azerbaijan.\n\nProsecutors Cuellar and his wife,Imelda Cuellar, accepted nearly $600,000 in bribes from an energy company controlled by Azerbaijan and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cueller agreed to advance their interests in the U.S., according to investigators. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation that was favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\nFederal investigators raided Cuellar's home in Laredo and his campaign office in 2022.\n\nHis legal counsel previously said Cuellar was not the target of the investigation.\n\nCuellar released a statement to NBC News claiming he and his wife are innocent.\n\n\"I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,\" Cuellar's statement read in part.\n\nThat search was part of a broader investigation related to Azerbaijan that saw FBI agents serve a raft of subpoenas and conduct interviews in Washington, D.C., and Texas, a person with direct knowledge of the probe previously told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt's unknown, at this time, if the indictment was related to the 2022 raid.\n\n“Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas,” Cuellar said. \"Before I took action, I proactively sought legal advice from the House Ethics Committee, who gave me more than one written opinion, along with an additional opinion from a national law firm.\n\n“Furthermore, we requested a meeting with the Washington D.C. prosecutors to explain the facts and they refused to discuss the case with us or hear our side.”\n\nThe congressman said he will continue to seek reelection to the House in November.\n\nIf convicted, Cuellar and Imelda Cuellar, could serve 5 to 20 years in prison."
