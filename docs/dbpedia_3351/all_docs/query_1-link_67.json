        "text": "RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas – Congressman Henry Cuellar and DHR Health recently held a press conference at Starr County Memorial Hospital to announce a $749,356 Rural Residency Planning and Development Grant.\n\nThe grant, which came from the Health Resources and Services Administration, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will be used to help develop a rural residency training program in Starr County.\n\nThe funds will be utilized by DHR Health over a three-year period. Through the award, DHR Health will develop and establish a family medicine – obstetrics rural residency training program with Starr County Memorial Hospital to train residents in rural Starr County.\n\nResidents will spend a majority of their time at SCMH and local physician’s offices, then the remainder of their training time at DHR Health in Edinburg, Texas. The program will train two residents per year for a total complement of six residents.\n\nImmediately following the news conference, the Rio Grande Guardian secured brief video interviews with Congressman Cuellar, Starr County Judge Eloy Vera, and DHR Health’s Chairman of the Board, Dr. Carlos Cardenas. Here are the interviews:\n\nCongressman Henry Cuellar\n\nStarr County Judge Eloy Vera"
