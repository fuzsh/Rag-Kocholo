        "text": "WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar (R) is denies all wrongdoing after he and his wife were indicted on conspiracy and bribery charges on Friday.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges the couple accepted nearly $600,000 from a Mexican bank and Azerbaijan energy company between 2014-2021.\n\nIn return, the Texas Democrat allegedly agreed to deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the house floor and influence legislation in favor of the central-Asian country, once part of the Soviet Bloc.\n\nUntil proven innocent, Cuellar will take leave as ranking member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nIn 2022, the FBI raided the congressmanâ€™s Laredo home in connection to this investigation."
