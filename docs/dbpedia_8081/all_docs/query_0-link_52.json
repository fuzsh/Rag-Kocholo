        "text": "Who could forget the cool Modernist house on top of Mount Rushmore in the classic Hitchcock thriller North by Northwest?\n\nI get a lot of questions about the Vandamm House from readers, so let’s take a closer look at it and the movie’s other famous sets!\n\nThe Sets from “North by Northwest”\n\nOld Westbury Gardens\n\nCary Grant is a successful Madison Avenue ad man named Roger Thornhill, whose life gets turned upside down when he gets mistaken for an undercover CIA agent. He’s first taken to this large estate on Long Island.\n\nThe estate where they filmed the exteriors for those scenes is Old Westbury Gardens, which is on the North Shore of Long Island in New York.\n\nThe interiors shown in the movie were sets built on a separate soundstage.\n\nWhen Thornhill gets locked in the library, he quips:\n\n“Don’t worry about me. I’ll catch up on my reading.”\n\nScreenwriter Ernest Lehman says Grant was a perfectionist who often complained about various parts of the script or the way things were being filmed and lobbied to get them changed.\n\nNorth by Northwest turned out to be Grant’s biggest box-office success.\n\nScenes at the U.N.\n\nHitchcock wasn’t allowed to film outside the U.N. so they “stole” a shot of Cary Grant walking in.\n\nThe people walking around in the shot didn’t know they were being filmed.\n\nThe interior of the U.N. was just a matte painting:\n\nThe backdrop was on display in Grand Central Terminal a few years ago, as part of a Turner Classic Movies exhibit on movies set in NYC.\n\nA reader sent me this photo of the matte painting:\n\nMount Rushmore\n\nThe screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman.\n\nHitchcock told him, “I always wanted to do a chase scene across the faces of Mt. Rushmore,” and that was the starting point for the movie.\n\nLehman recalled, “I wanted to write the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures. I wanted something that had wit, sophistication, glamour, action, and lots of changes of locale.”\n\nAfter word got out that there would be a fight scene and a couple of deaths on the monument, government officials barred them from filming there.\n\nThe crew flew back to Hollywood, where Mount Rushmore had to be recreated at MGM.\n\nIn the scene where Eve shoots Roger (below), can you spot the goof in the background?\n\nIn the screenshot above, you can see the boy at the table behind Eva Marie Saint plugged his ears, knowing the gun was about to go off. 🙂\n\nThe Vandamm House on Mount Rushmore\n\nThey needed to come up with a reason why all of the characters would be congregating at Mount Rushmore, so Lehman decided that the bad guys would have their headquarters nearby.\n\nIt’s known as “The Vandamm House” after James Mason’s character, Phillip Vandamm.\n\nA lot of people have asked me whether it’s a real house, and if it’s really on top of Mount Rushmore.\n\nI hate to disappoint you, but the exterior was a matte painting (a pre-digital effect when a real set or location was combined with a painting), and the interior rooms were built on a soundstage.\n\nNothing could be built on top of the monument, even temporarily.\n\nThe MGM researchers had to get special permits and Park Service escorts just to visit the area in order to photograph and measure it.\n\nHitchcock knew he wanted it to be a Modernist house.\n\nIn the late ’50s, Frank Lloyd Wright was the most famous Modernist architect in the world.\n\nAny house he designed for the film would have been instantly recognizable to audiences.\n\nThe problem: they couldn’t afford Wright’s fee.\n\nSo Hitchcock decided they’d just build a house that looked like one Wright would have designed.\n\nAccording to Sandy McLendon:\n\nThe house would be created entirely in Culver City, where MGM was located.\n\nIt would consist of a few sections built at full-scale, as movie sets.\n\nThe exterior shots would depend on special effects. Certain shots would blend the sets together with the special effects, to create the illusion that the house was real.\n\nThe final design was of a hilltop house of limestone dressed and laid in the manner made famous by Wright, along with a concrete cantilever under the living room area.\n\nThe set designers for the film were Robert Boyle, William A. Horning, Merrill Pye, Henry Grace, and Frank McKelvey.\n\nMcLendon explains how the set was designed:\n\nCertain areas like the outside of the bedroom wing had their exteriors finished, so that they could be shot from inside looking out, or outside looking in.\n\nThe interiors were masterpieces of deception: nearly nothing was what it appeared.\n\nThe limestone walls were mostly plaster, real limestone was used in a few places where the camera would be very close.\n\nThe expanses of window were mostly without glass; glass reflects camera crews and lights.\n\nAll of the scenes of the house were shot at night so that the effects would look more realistic.\n\nFun Facts About “North by Northwest:”\n\nNorth by Northwest was the working title, but they never came up with anything they liked better. One they considered: The Man in Lincoln’s Nose. (Seriously.)\n\nJimmy Stewart was originally considered for the role of Thornhill, but Hitchcock decided he looked “too old.” Cary Grant was 55 when he filmed it (4 years older than Stewart).\n\nJessie Royce Landis, who played Grant’s mother, was only 8 years older than he was.\n\nMGM designed an entire wardrobe for Saint’s character, but Hitchcock threw out almost everything. She says he took her to Bergdorf-Goodman and selected clothes for her “right off the models.”\n\nHitchcock gave Saint three basic directions: 1) Lower your voice. 2) Don’t use your hands. 3) Always look directly into Cary Grant’s eyes.\n\nNorth by Northwest was nominated for 5 Oscars but lost in every category."
