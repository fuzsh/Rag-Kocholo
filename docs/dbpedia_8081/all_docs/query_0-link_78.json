        "text": "Political thrillers often encourage the feeling that a mere individual has the power to make a difference on a large scale. Caught up in a chain of events they wished they had never uncovered, a protagonist can occupy a position in which their actions have far-reaching consequences, with the rookie CIA analyst accidentally bringing down a whole corrupt political system being only one example. Much of the critical attention these films have garnered falls under the rubric of detective work in that the protagonist is seen as exposing a web of corruption which would otherwise have gone on unnoticed. However, this paper is focused on how the scale of the individual comes into contact with other, larger scales of events. Points of contact between scales are important because they are where change can take place, thus allowing an individual to influence the supra-individual.\n\nThe year 2014 marked the twentieth anniversary of the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional / Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The impact of this event on perceptions of the PRI and the Mexican political system has prevailed within the public imaginary, and continues to fuel conspiracy theories in relation to the possible motives for the candidate’s assassination. This article examines a filmic exploration of this traumatic moment in recent Mexican history, an event that changed the way the nation viewed its then President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari’s, and subsequent PRI governments. At this moment the public mood was transformed, from a prevailing sense of false security, driven by the dictums of neoliberal policies under the banner of Salinismo, to a state of shock and fear of a society spiralling into increasing violence and an economic downturn, with repercussions for years to follow. Framing Colosio: el asesinato / Colosio: the Assassination within discourses of the thriller genre, and borrowing from theoretical notions of “conspiracism”, I explore the significance of Carlos Bolado’s film in light of the timing of its release (prior to the 2012 presidential elections), and the contents of its narrative. Moreover, the article explores the role of history and fiction in this detective story, alongside the way in which film as a medium processes traumatic events. Ultimately, I examine how the film’s metanarrative forma tprovides the exploratory premise from which to access otherwise un-visualized and complex theories surrounding the case.\n\nAssassin Nation: Theorizing the Conspiracy Film in the Early Twenty-First Century argues that the conspiracy films of the 1970s - which depicted or alluded to the highly politicized events of Watergate, the world oil crisis, and the devaluing of the U.S. currency - can be used as a template for understanding and addressing the political events and films of the last twenty years. I argue that similar narrative, iconographic and syntactical tropes may be found in two subsequent cycles of films in the 1990s and in the post-9/11 period\n\nThis is a position paper presented at the Carolina Graduate Literature Society's annual conference, 2016. In this short position paper I explore the complicated, reciprocal entanglements between notions of criminality, race, and genre through the vehicle of film history. I will present an analysis of certain social types generated by two genres: horror and vigilante films. In particular, I will argue that these genres portray criminal deviance and vigilante justice in ways heavily inflected by historically grounded archives heavily indebted to both psychoanalysis and white supremacy. The two genres on which I will focus had their heyday in the 1970’s, a historical moment very much defined by mainstream fears regarding social disorder, urban crisis, and crime. However, the two genres draw from different cultural archives, and indicate different yet intersecting ways in which Americans have imagined crime and justice in relation to race. In earlier horror films such as Psycho, criminal deviants are often portrayed as maladjusted Freudian subjects. In later cycles, they become sociopathic geniuses or supernatural slashers in films such as Silence of the Lambs or Nightmare on Elm Street. These films make emotional appeals to the nightmarish dangers lurking in the dark unconscious of mainstream suburban settings and white bourgeois life in particular. The vigilante film, on the other hand, implicitly locates texts such as Birth of a Nation in its archive, and caters to white fears of urban crime inflected by racialized undertones. Films such as Death Wish function to assuage an offended sense of white masculinity, patriarchal dominance, and middle class (in)security by letting loose upon a fundamentally immoral and depraved urban underworld. Ultimately, these generic formations cross-pollinate to generate innovations not only in American cinema, but throughout American culture. I will wrap up by pointing to the ways in which these generic figures exert enough power over the American imagination to generate excessive, unjust, and even deadly consequences in the context of American society and, in particular, the criminal justice system.\n\nThis article explores three recent Spanish films -Grupo 7 (Group 7, 2012), La isla mínima (Marshland, 2014) and El hombre de las mil caras (Smoke and Mirrors, 2016) that can be classified as \"quality thriller\" as they share a \"filmmaker-auteur\" nature, good production values, and an effort to obey the rules of the genre. Their production is an illustrative example of commercial productions which are giving a special visibility to a new version of the cinematographic authorship, a phenomenon which is described here as \"the auteurism of commerce\". Besides, as the analysis of their narratives and forms shows, the way in which these films participate in the cultural upheaval which spread through Spain since 2011 is also especially remarkable as they take a stance embracing a revisionist approach to the history of Spanish democracy,. All this considered, they represent a poignant case to explore the way in which mainstream fiction films dialogue with the challenges with which democracy is confronted in 21st century Europe."
