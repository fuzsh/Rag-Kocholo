        "text": "Do you want to write in the action genre but need help conjuring compelling and action-packed stories and concepts? Sometimes reading simple action writing prompts is the easiest way to get those creative juices flowing.\n\nCommon Elements in the Action Genre\n\nThe action genre is very broad with many sub-genres. Most action movies call for big action sequences, explosions, chases, gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, etc.\n\nGenerally speaking, the central plot of the script is less important compared to the high-octane action and thrills that such action stories have to offer. In action stories, it's the concept and premise that truly shines. But that doesn't mean they're easy to write. You need to be ready to conjure engaging action set pieces and raise the stakes as high as you possibly can to keep readers and audiences on the edge of their seats as the character(s) struggle to survive whatever you throw at them.\n\nWhy Use Action Writing Prompts\n\nAction writing prompts can be anything from a simple writing exercise to an ideation tool that helps inspire you for your next big, high-octane project. Think of them as a seed for your story ideas. An effective action writing prompt introduces a simple writing topic and allows you to play around with it. A good one, for instance, isn’t going to be an overly detailed setup — it’ll be basic and bare-boned.\n\nAction Writing Prompts in, Well, Action\n\nNeed a few examples? We’ve got them!\n\nAction Writing Prompt: An experimental medical procedure helps a cop catch a bad guy.\n\nMovie: Face/Off\n\nAction Writing Prompt: A group of soldiers go behind enemy lines to retrieve a paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action.\n\nMovie: Saving Private Ryan\n\nAction Writing Prompt: A cop comes to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and her office building is taken over by terrorists.\n\nMovie: Die Hard\n\nAction Writing Prompt: A skilled warrior protects her tribe from a highly evolved alien predator.\n\nMovie: Prey\n\nAction Writing Prompt: A Cuban refugee becomes an immensely wealthy, powerful and ruthless drug lord in 1980s Miami..\n\nMovie: Scarface\n\nAction Writing Prompt: Near-future Manhattan is turned into a maximum security prison…and the president is stuck there and needs to be rescued.\n\nMovie: Escape from New York\n\nWith action writing prompts, the stakes are high and clearly defined.\n\nAction Writing Prompts Are Everywhere\n\nWe get our ideas from many sources — news headlines, novels, television shows, movies, our lives, our fears, our phobias, etc. They can come from a scene or moment in a film that wasn’t fully explored. They can come from a single visual that entices the creative mind — a seed that continues to grow and grow until the writer is forced to finally put it to paper or screen.\n\nIn the spirit of helping writers find those seeds, here we offer 101 originally conceived action story prompts that you can use as inspiration for your next action story.\n\nThey may inspire screenplays, novels, short stories, or even smaller moments that you can include in what stories you are already writing.\n\nNote: Because we’re all connected to the same pop culture, news headlines, and inspirations, any similarity to any past, present, or future screenplays, novels, short stories, television pilots, television series, plays, or any other creative works is purely coincidence. These action writing prompts were conceived on the fly without any research or Google search for inspiration.\n\nAction Writing Prompts Focusing on Police/Military/Government/Political Operations\n\nA
