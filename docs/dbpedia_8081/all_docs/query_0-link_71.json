        "text": "In BBC's list, crime is strong, comedies are holding their own, but musicals are way over yonder in the minor key.\n\nOK, another post about BBC's list of the 100 greatest American films, as chosen by 62 international critics.\n\nFirst thing I noticed? Not a lot of musicals. Also not many animated movies: one, to be precise. A superhero movie made the list, which is new, plus two documentaries. And an experimental short from the 1940s? OK. I guess. But one wonders how.\n\nWhich genres did well? That most American of genres, the western, did OK. So did crime drama and film noir, both of which are wholly American, despite the latter's French nomenclature and the European pedigree of many of its most famous practitiioners.\n\n(Side thought: How many of the directors on this auteur-heavy list of great American movies are foreign-born?)\n\nComedy did OK, with some interesting choices (ex: “Groundhog Day”), while horror got the usual nods (Hitchcock, Kubrick) plus one unusual one (“Night of the Living Dead”). The critics weren't loving the war movies. In fact, there's more of what I call “mystery thriller w/perverse sexuality” than there is of war.\n\nThis last comment indicates a problem with even attempting what I'm attempting. What genre is “The Tree of Life,” for example? Or “Casablanca”? Or “Crimes and Misdemeanors”? Is this last a crime drama? A crime drama with comedy? A comedy with crime and drama? What's the difference between a crime drama and a film noir? Entire books have been written on that subject. I can't help recalling James Baldwin's great line about how our passion for categorization, our attempt to order the world neatly, has “boomeranged us into chaos; in which limbo we whirl, clutching the straws of our definitions.” That's me, here. But I keep doing it. Or attempting it.\n\nProviso stated, here are the genre numbers. (I've added the “mystery thriller w/sex” subgenre into the “thriller” category):\n\nDrama: 31\n\nComedy: 16\n\nWestern: 10\n\nFilm noir: 9\n\nThriller: 7\n\nMusical: 5\n\nSci-fi: 5\n\nAction: 3\n\nHorror: 3\n\nRomance: 3\n\nWar: 3\n\nDocumentary: 2\n\nAnimated: 1\n\nSuperhero: 1\n\nShort: 1\n\nEssentially it's a dark brooding list with a few oddities, like “Forrest Gump” at No. 74. (I put that one in its own category: “drama, comedy.” It seems a drama to me first. You could go: “drama, fantasy” or “drama, history,” too.)\n\nFor a list that ends with “Citizen Kane” at No. 1 and “The Godfather” at No. 2, it's also a fairly hip list, which makes “Gump” an even odder inclusion. Maybe it's getting its hipster fans now, who are reacting to my generation's overall shrug on the subject.\n\nIn the meantime, for masochists, the list as sorted by genre (or its best approximation):\n\nFilm Genre 84.
