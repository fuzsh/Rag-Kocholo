        "text": "GQ Names the Most Stylish Films\n\nCary Grant was workin' it, fo' sho. A list published in the November issue of GQ names Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest as the most stylish film of all time, meaning the looks it brought to the silver screen went on to have the biggest influence on the sartorial scene. Also making the top 10: Breathless (1959), Ocean's 11 (1960), Purple Noon, 8 1/2, A Hard Day's Night, How to Steal a Million, Blowup, Bullitt and Get Carter (1970). Conspicuously, no Clan of the Cave Bear."
