        "text": "Violence & Scariness\n\na little\n\nRoger Thornhill is kidnapped at gunpoint, then force-fed a bottle of bourbon (not shown) and put behind the wheel of the car, which he almost crashes numerous times on a windy road. A character gets knifed in the back. A crop duster fires shots and chases Thornhill, later exploding when it hits a truck. A death is faked by shooting and more shots are fired at the main characters as they dangle from a great height.\n\nDid you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Violence & Scariness in your kid's entertainment guide.\n\nGet started\n\nPositive Role Models\n\na little\n\nThornhill is a twice-divorced ad exec who spouts his philosophy at the beginning of the movie as \"In the world of advertising there's no such thing as a lie, there's only expedient exaggeration.\" When he's set up we see a big shift in his character -- he risks his own life for the truth and then for love. The CIA is shown as unscrupulous, willing to let Thornhill die to cover their tracks. Eve is played as mysterious and cunning and joked about as promiscuous -- but she's a damsel in distress ready to be saved by Thornhill in the end.\n\nParents need to know that North by Northwest is a Hitchcock classic that includes suspenseful scenes such as a forced drunken car chase on windy roads and a crop duster chase with shooting and an explosion. Typical of the era, there's drinking of hard liquor and smoking, with a seductive lighting-up featured in one scene. More seductive elements include forward sexual banter and some kissing -- the clothes stay on but there's a mention that the main characters slept together in their train car. It's also worth noting that the main character undergoes a big transformation, from fast-talking and unscrupulous ad exec to a man who risks his own life to find out the truth that will exonerate him.
