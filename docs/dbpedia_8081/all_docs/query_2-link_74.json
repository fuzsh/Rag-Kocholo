        "text": "Join us at the Rio Theatre on Tuesday, August 13 as we tip our hat and raise a glass to cinematic icon Alfred Hitchcock – on his birthday! – with the new, 65th Anniversary restoration of one of his all-time greatest thrillers, NORTH BY NORTHWEST.\n\nAt one point (jokingly) titled “The Man in Lincoln’s Nose”, the film represents something of a late-period departure for a filmmaker known primarily for horror; it’s a tightly-wound, intensely thrilling, and often witty take on the cinematic trope of mistaken identity that is widely regarded as one of his best films.\n\nCary Grant stars as Madison Avenue advertising man Roger Thornhill, who finds himself thrust into the world of spies when he is mistaken for a man by the name of George Kaplan. When foreign spy Philip Vandamm and his henchman Leonard try to eliminate him, Thornhill tries to make sense of the case, and is framed for murder instead. On the run from the police, he manages to board a train bound for Chicago, where he meets a beautiful blond (a memorable Eva Marie Saint) who helps him evade the authorities. His world is turned upside down yet again when he learns that even she isn’t the innocent bystander he thought she was. Not all is as it seems however, leading to a dramatic climax at the top of Mt. Rushmore.\n\nBeyond what one would expect from the man famously dubbed, “The Master of Suspense,” NORTH BY NORTHWEST is notable for being one of the director’s only action films, and features several visually iconic sequences that have since become woven into the fabric of the genre. Also starring James Mason, Martin Landau.\n\n“Certifiable ‘classic’ territory, Hitchcock’s glossiest entertainment is the closest the trickster ever came to an action movie.” (Empire Magazine)\n\nTuesday, August 13\n\nDoors 5:45 pm | Movie 6:15 pm *Start time subject to change. Please arrive on time.\n\nAdvance tickets HERE\n\nSaturday, August 17\n\nDoors 3:15 pm | Movie 3:45 pm *Start time subject to change. Please arrive on time.\n\nAdvance tickets HERE\n\nNORTH BY NORTHWEST (Alfred Hitchcock, 1959 / 136 mins / PG) A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.\n\n*Minors OK. Must be 19+ w/ID for bar service.\n\n*Rio Theatre Groupons and passes OK for any single film only.
