        "text": "A newly restored 70mm print of Hitchcock’s stylish espionage thriller comes to Pictureville for its UK premiere.\n\nGripping, suspenseful, and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow, as a case of mistaken identity leads to a cross-country chase involving murder, espionage, and romance. Starring Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive falsely identified as a government agent, he is pursued by ruthless spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), the harried Thornhill meets the beautiful and enigmatic Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) along the way.\n\nThe film excels in its direction, acting and particularly in its innovative cinematography, magnificent on the wide screen. The film’s visual storytelling, from the crop-duster chase to the Mount Rushmore sequence, showcases Hitchcock’s mastery in creating tension and visual spectacle, amounting to some of the most memorable sequences in cinema history.\n\nNorth by Northwest was filmed in VistaVision and originally released in 1.85. Motion Picture Imaging scanned the original 8-perf 35mm VistaVision camera negative in 13k with all restoration work completed in 6.5k. The 70mm film print was created by filming out a new 65mm negative. The Film Foundation has given approval of the restoration.\n\nOpening night—We would like to welcome all pass holders and ticket holders to our opening night reception, held in Pictureville bar before the film from 19.30."
