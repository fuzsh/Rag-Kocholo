        "text": "BK BOWZER\n\nBowzer, formerly of the group Sha Na Na, trying to break a glass with his low voice, which he finally did, in Jackson in this 1995 photo.\n\n(File)\n\nFLINT, MI -- A Michigan candidate for the United States Senate is looking for a boost among senior voters from an unlikely place.\n\nSpecifically, a 33-year-old music act and its television show.\n\nJon Bauman, known for his role as Bowzer in \"Sha Na Na\" was scheduled to visit Flint and Lansing Wednesday, Sept. 17, to talk to seniors about the race.\n\nThere was a time when the show was on the air that it's largest market share came from the Flint area.\n\n\"I love the music of the '50s and the early '60s, but that does not mean I want to return to a time before Medicare when 35 percent of seniors lived below the poverty line,\" Bauman said in a statement.\n\n\"And I certainly don't want to return to a time before Social Security when more than 50 percent of seniors lived below the poverty line. The choice is clear: Gary Peters has a strong record supporting Michigan seniors but Terri Lynn Land would take us back to a time when a secure retirement wasn't an option for millions of seniors.\"\n\n\"Sha Na Na,\" was a show hosted by the band of the same name and was on the air from 1977 to 1981. The show featured the group singing 50s and 60s rock and roll songs and performing comedy skits.\n\nBauman sang bass in the group and wore his trademark outfit on every episode: black converse sneakers, jeans and a black muscle shirt with slicked-back hair. The group ended each show with the Bowzer character saying \"\"Good night, and grease for peace,\" and then the group sang \"Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight.\""
