Are you looking for some other poems and observations, humorous and otherwise, to prove these cool cats mettle? How about you tune into American Film Institute cataloged film, Grease, and tell me you toe isn't a tappin'! (specifically during the Hand Jive). These guys have basically been trainers to the stars of rock, and have been seeking the stars of recognition!"
