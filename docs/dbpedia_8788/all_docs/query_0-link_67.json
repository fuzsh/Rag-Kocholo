        "text": "Bass Alan Cooper, majoring in religion, born in New York City, and raised in the suburbs, is typical of the group in his penchant for a seriousness parodied by self-irony. The same intelligence that leads to mastering the rules that lead to Columbia can only progress to an understanding of their very fatuousness. In high school, says Alan, “I was debating and oratory champion. Now,” he says, “I am rather conceited and sometimes even mean … but I’m basically OK, although not so hot-looking.”\n\nBaritone Richard Joffee enumerates the situation of the student in the Ivy League college surrounded by slums: “Parents: Russian Immigrants. Father Chemist. Mother Designer. Two brothers, Harvard graduates. Born: Greenwich Village. Now lives: Jersey. Hero: Mickey Mantle. Plays: guitar, trombone, dead. President high school religious youth group. Editor jr. high paper. V.P. Political-Gov. club in high school. Also Assembly M.C. Participant student Gov. Thrown out of elections for school president. Travel: U.S., Europe, U.S.S.R. Jobs: Library Page, Camp Counselor, Bell Hop. Major: English/Government. Likes: Thighs. Speaks: English. Listens: All languages. At Columbia: Member of Kingsmen. Tutor in Spanish Harlem. Hates: L.B.J., Vietnam War, Greasers, Ignorance, Evil, Apple Pie. Also somewhat ambivalent about his mother. Favorite Music: Anything but nursery rhymes and acid rock. Oldies are almost as bad but not quite. Believes: There is no purpose in living. Has often considered suicide and does not now rule it out completely.”\n\nOnly second tenor Denny Green, Harlem-born and bred, the only black in the group, seems unaware of any lunacy in the life programmed for him at Columbia. A scholarship student at Hotchkiss prep school, at the end of his first year at Columbia he had his own weekly radio show, was co-director of a film-making program, a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and in pursuit of the American dream.\n\nThe group’s over-all sense of irony extends to the long-standing interest they have all shared in popular music while following the straight go-to-college-get-a-degree-and-don’t-make-waves dictum slapped on them by the culture of parents and guidance counselors.\n\nDrummer and baritone John Marcellino, from a Boston suburb, worked with various local rock groups for six years. Joe Witkin, started piano lessons at six, and joined his first rock group, the Phenomenon, in high school. “I played rhythm guitar on my paisley Hofner … played the worst sweet sixteens, but it was incredible fun.” He went on to other groups, some with Henry Gross, playing lead and bass guitar. Bass guitar and second tenor Bruce Clarke, from Washington, D.C., cut his “guitar teeth in a group known as the Fuzz – ‘the band with the arresting sound’.” When that broke up, he organized the “Fantastic Plastic.”\n\nDonald York, from Idaho, remembers “singing more than I would have liked to for church and ladies’ clubs meetings at a very tender age, and my rendition of ‘The Ballad of Davy Crockett’ won me a first prize award when I was four.” But it was his two sisters, ten and twelve years older, who turned him on to his musical reality. “When they were teenagers and I was just a little boy-kid, they provided me with my first exposure to a liberal dose of the kind of music Sha-Na-Na performs today.”\n\nAs with rhythm guitar and second tenor Elliot Cahn, from Brookline, Massachusetts: “I was introduced to rock at an early age by my older brother, who is currently a PhD candidate at MIT. I was a regular customer at the local soda shop-teenage hangout, where I would listen to the jukebox and watch with wide eyes the local hoods as they guzzled birch beer and carved their initials in the booths. Late at night I would lie in bed as all the great hits flowed in my mind, and resolved that someday I, too, would be a big rock and roll star, and go out with girls and everything.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nFor all the members of Sha-Na-Na, the rock explosion was something to grow up into, like D.A. haircuts, pegged trousers, rubbers, beer drinking, wearing your shirt collar up, being a stud.\n\nIn that era of Debbie & Eddie, Janet & Tony, and Rock & Tab, when Archie Andrews was grabbing a shiv and rumbling through West Side Story, if you were a hip New York kid you had to make the pilgrimage to the Dick Clark Show in Philly. If you couldn’t make that, you watched Juke Box Jury or its local equivalent. “It has a good beat,” would declare the bright-eyed panelist, “and I’d like to dance to it. But I didn’t understand the words so I’ll give it an 82.”\n\nAfter which, you made out. Cool. Or zorch. Depending.\n\nThe members of Sha-Na-Na were in grade school."
