        "text": "Sha Na Na will perform at Newton Theatre on Friday, October 19.\n\nThe group, featuring original members John “Jocko” Marcellino and Donny York, specializes in faithful recreations of the rock ‘n’ roll hits of the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nSha Na Na formed at Columbia University from an offshoot of the school’s glee club. It gained exposure through such appearances as its performances at the Woodstock festival in 1969 and in the 1978 movie “Grease.”\n\nIt all started with the Kingsmen.\n\nNo, not THAT Kingsmen, the Pacific Northwest rock band that hit the charts with an indecipherable version of “Louie Louie.” This Kingsmen was an offshoot of the glee club at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nIn 1969, the Kingsmen started to expand their repertoire from the usual a capella standards by incorporating the doo-wop songs that were mainstays of late 1950s radio, like “In the Still of the Night” and “Two Silhouettes on the Shade.”\n\nBefore long, the doo-wop numbers began to dominate the set list. Then the singers started dressing up like greasers, with leather jackets and slicked-back hair. They finally adopted a name using nonsense syllables from the song “Get a Job”: Sha Na Na.\n\n“We played our first show at Columbia,” recalled John “Jocko” Marcellino, the group’s drummer. “We played the 12 songs we knew, and then we played them again.”\n\nHalf a century later, a few of the hairs are gray beneath the grease, and a number of the faces have changed. But Sha Na Na remains committed to the music of the first decade of rock ’n’ roll – as Marcellino called it, the “pre-Beatles era.”\n\nSha Na Na (which also includes original member Donny York and long-time musician Screamin’ Scott Simon) will play the Newton Theatre on Friday, October 19.\n\nWith its outfits and audience participation routines (including dancing), a Sha Na Na is a little more than a concert. “We’re an entertainment act, but we’re true to the music,” said Marcellino. “We play music people love in an accurate and fun way.”\n\nSee also: Bob Lanza Blues Band brings his music locally\n\nSee also: Morristown gets the blues again – and all that jazz\n\nSee also: Delbert not giving up on music\n\nThat music always came first for Marcellino, who grew up in Boston listening to such radio stations as WMEX and WILD. He fondly remembers deejay Arnie “Woo Woo” Ginsburg, who began his program with James Brown’s cover of “Night Train.”.\n\n“Those were great records and great songs,” said Marcellino. “They were the standards of rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\nMarcellino and the other original members of Sha Na Na all shared the affection for that era, even the late 1960s was the height of psychedelia and hard rock. But simply the fact that Sha Na Na was bucking the trend brought them attention.\n\nThe band was playing a small club in Hell’s Kitchen that attracted such clientele as members of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones when they were in New York. Perhaps most significantly, the group attracted the attention of Jimi Hendrix.\n\nOne night, Hendrix introduced Sha Na Na to two men who were producing a weekend music festival that August. “They asked if we wanted to play it,” Marcellino said. “I’d been hearing about it on FM radio, and I knew it would be something big.”\n\nThat gig turned out to be the fabled Woodstock festival. Sha Na Na enjoyed a prime slot on the line-up, playing immediately before Hendrix’s closing set.\n\nMarcellino noted that Hendrix – who had a commitment to be the last act – refused to play until Sha Na Na and a few other groups were given the chance to perform. “Jimi was the sweetest guy,” said Marcellino.\n\nIn terms of direct financial renumeration, Woodstock was a bust for the band. Marcellino said that the 12-member band was paid with a check for only $350. “And the check bounced,” he added with a laugh.\n\nBut a brief clip of Sha Na Na playing “At the Hop” in the Oscar-winning documentary about Woodstock led to more and more exposure. The band had its own TV variety show for years and also appeared in the high-profile movie “Grease.”\n\nAs a result, Sha Na Na continues to attract audiences, according to Marcellino. He pointed out that several generations have rediscovered the band over the years, and the typical audience for their concerts includes both teens and 60-somethings.\n\n“We rotate songs in and out of our sets,” he said. “We have a seven-man ensemble, and six of them are lead vocalists. I take the R&B stuff, like Little Richard’s ‘Lucille.’ The music is great, and I just love doing those songs.”\n\nIF YOU GO: SHA NA NA\n\nWHAT: The band, featuring original members John “Jocko” Marcellino and Donny York, specializes in faithful recreations of the rock ‘n’ roll hits of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Next year the group will celebrate the 50th anniversary since its founding at Columbia University.\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Friday, October 19.\n\nWHERE: Newton Theatre, 234 Spring. St., Newton\n\nTICKETS: $37 to $42"
