This is a two album set with the following songs: Lovers' Questions; Latest Flame; Pretty Little Angel Eyes; Chantilly Lace; Why Do Fools Fall In Love; Little Darlin'; Heartbreak Hotel; Wild Weekend; Get A Job; Rock Around The Clock; Tears On My Pillow; Tell Laura I Love Her; Yakety Yak; Jailhouse Rock; Blue Moon; Teenager IN Love; I Wonder Why; Runaround Sue; 16 Candles; Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On; Shake, Rattle 'N' Roll; Rama Lama Ding Dong; Sea Cruise; Walk Don't Run; At The Hop; Rock 'N' Roll Is Here To Stay; Hound Dog; Great Balls Of Fire and Lovers Never Say Goodbye.\n\nThis album number KSBS 2073-2 Stereo is a promotional copy and it is in very good condition although the poster that did accompany this album is no longer with it, my belief is that is still hangs in a radio station control room somewhere in the United States.\n\nSha Na Na is an American a rock and roll do wop group. The groups song and dance show was based on 1950's hit songs. Sha Na Na while performing the the music of the 1950's parodying the music of that era, just after their formation in 1969 and their performance at Woodstock made possible by their friend Jimi Hendrix began appealing to a wide audience. In their show they wore Gold Lame or Leather Jackets and sported pompadour or ducktail hairdos.\n\nOver the years the group has seen a lot of personnel changes but when they perform the crowds go wild."
