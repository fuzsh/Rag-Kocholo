        "text": "Even if you’ve never been to a sock hop, Quincy native Jocko Marcellino promises \"You can rock it, you can roll it, you can slop it, you can stroll it'' when Sha Na Na cuts loose at Hanover Theatre in Worcester on Saturday.\n\n\"We’re gonna kick butt,'' predicted the Bay State-born drummer for the group that brought back ’50s rock ’n’ roll and pompadours to the Age of Aquarius. \"We’re gonna put on a real good show that we like to think of as organized frenzy.''\n\nFrom Woodstock to a television variety show, Sha Na Na has inspired everything from musicals like \"Grease'' and sitcoms like \"Happy Days.''\n\nThe current band features: Marcellino, one of group’s three original members, on drums, vocals and general rabble rousing; vocalist Donny York; and pianist and vocalist \"Screamin’'' Scott Simon from the TV show, \"Sha Na Na,'' which ran 1977 to 1981.\n\n\"We’ll be wearing the pomps, leather and those good ‘50s bowling shirts,'' said Marcellino.\n\n\"It’s a great interactive show. We’ll get the audience dancing along, doing the twist and limbo.''\n\nMarcellino said Saturday’s 8 p.m. concert in Worcester is part of a series of more than 40 events celebrating the 40th anniversary of the group’s appearance at Woodstock, where Sha Na Na burst into the national spotlight.\n\nThough musical tastes have changed, Marcellino said the songs Sha Na Na performs \"have become America’s folk music.''\n\n\"What I really like about what we’re doing is it’s the audience’s show. It’s all about them,'' Marcellino said from his home in California. \"Sha Na Na has a legendary name and we all try to live up to it.''\n\nThe playlist will likely include \"At the Hop,'' popularized by Danny and the Juniors; \"Whole Lot of Shaking,'' originally done by Jerry Lee Lewis and the Comets; the Big Bopper’s \"Chantilly Lace''; and Richie Valens’ \"La Bamba.''\n\nIn addition to his drumming, Marcellino expects to sing Elvis Presley’s hit \"Hound Dog'' and Little Richard’s \"Lucille.''\n\nAnd he expects the whole group to sing an a capella version of the Five Satins’ 1956 doo-wop hit \"In The Still of The Night.''\n\nFor Marcellino, it’s been a long, strange trip from the South Shore to Max Yasgur’s farm and improbable fame as a sort of rock ’n’ roll legend.\n\nHe was born John Marcellino in Quincy and didn’t pick up his nickname until he went to Columbia University to study English and play football. After his kindergarten teacher said he had \"musical talent,'' he started banging on his older brother’s drums and has never stopped.\n\nAfter his family moved to Milton, he split his time as an All-State football guard at Archbishop Williams High School and started bands with names like the Mill-Tones and The Pilgrims, which played at the popular Surf Nantasket.\n\nIn 1968, Marcellino enrolled at Columbia, and a year later he was on stage at Woodstock.\n\nAt Columbia, Marcellino said he was \"the only drummer on campus who had drums with him'' and he played with a university harmony group called the Kingsmen, who wore blue blazers and white turtlenecks.\n\nAs a freshman, he also picked up the nickname \"Jocko'' for his twisted imitation of TV impresario Ed Sullivan interviewing singer Jack Jones.\n\nDeciding to funkify their image in 1969, the group borrowed retro outfits from a nearby production of \"Bye Bye Birdie'' and went on stage with slicked hair as The Greasers and played hits from the ’50s.\n\n\"I guess the audience was taking a break from the revolution,'' said Marcellino. \"They loved us.''\n\nBecause a West Coast group also called The Kingsmen, famous for their raunchy hit \"Louie, Louie,'' had a prior claim to that name, the group renamed themselves Sha Na Na after the refrain in a song by the Silhouettes.\n\nConsisting of Columbia students, they soon played at the famed Filmore East, opening for the Grateful Dead.\n\nIn just their eighth gig, Marcellino and Sha Na Na were blind-sided by national fame.\n\nOn Aug., 18, 1969, they took the Woodstock stage at 7:30 a.m., the next-to-last act before Jimi Hendrix closed the concert. Sha Na Na performed nine songs, including the \"Na Na Theme'' twice, \"Yakety Yak,'' \"Duke of Earl'' and \"Teen Angel.''\n\n\"The stars were aligned for us. We were very visual and played a sort of theatrical rock,'' Marcellino said. \"At that time we had no record deal. We were just thrilled to go on. We were euphoric realizing what a historic thing it was.''\n\nWhen the movie \"Woodstock'' was released, Sha Na Na’s performance had been distilled into 90 seconds, but it earned them national fame and $1 to be shared by the 12 members.\n\n\"The was the best 8 cents I ever earned,'' said Marcellino.\n\nFor Sha Na Na, the roller-coaster ride had begun. It headlined concerts, got a five-year-run on TV and an appearance in the movie \"Grease'' as \"Johnny Casino and the Gamblers.''\n\nOver the ensuing decade, Sha Na Na became a top concert act with Bruce Springsteen, the Eagles, Steely Dan and Jay Leno opening for them.\n\nLooking back, Marcellino called it an \"unbelievable era.''\n\n\"We went from the ‘Summer of Love’ to the war in Vietnam,'' he said. \"It was an intense decade and Woodstock was the exclamation point.''\n\nIF YOU GO . .\n\nWHAT: Sha Na Na concert\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Saturday\n\nWHERE: Hanover Theatre, 2 Southbridge St., Worcester"
