        "text": "“Rock ‘n’ roll is here to stay.”\n\nThat’s what Danny and the Juniors sang nearly 50 years ago, and Lennie Baker, who backed the Philadelphia vocal group when they performed in New England, and who later gained celebrity as a saxman and singer with rock ‘n’ roll revivalists Sha Na Na, is living proof that it’s true.\n\nAt age 61 Baker continues to play the music that he connected with as a kid. On Saturday, Sept. 29, Baker, backed by The Spellbinders, will be polishing up those golden oldies when he performs at the Sons of Italy Hall in Cotuit. Proceeds from the show benefit the Barnstable Yarmouth Lions Club.\n\nFor Baker, it all began 53 years ago in Whitman.\n\n“I started playing clarinet when I was 8 years old,” Baker says. “They’d come around to the schools and demonstrate all the instruments and then you could pick the one you like. Why I picked the clarinet I have no idea.”\n\nBy the early ’60s Baker was blowing sax for Paul Wayne and the Wantells, a local garage band, playing high school hops and dance parties.\n\n“We used to do Kenny Carter’s Pepsi Dance Party in Revere (broadcast on WCOP) and places like B.C. High, and Whitman Town Hall and Holbrook Town Hall,” Baker says.\n\nThe band also backed nationally known rock ‘n’ roll acts such as Danny and the Juniors, whose recording “At the Hop” became a ’50s anthem, and later on, a staple for Sha Na Na, who performed it at Woodstock. Baker, who joined Sha Na Na a few years after Woodstock, made his imprint on the group turning the doo-wop version of “Blue Moon” into his signature song.\n\nJoining Sha Na Na was a step up for Baker. “We were sort of the bigtime then,” he says. But going from backing seminal rock ‘n’ rollers to working with the campy retro rockers wasn’t that great a change, Baker adds.\n\n“It was the same audience. We worked a lot of colleges, all over the United States. They were all college kids; the group started at Columbia University.”\n\nAs for Sha Na Na’s over-the-top performances, Baker says, “They took the music and turned it into choreography. They made it very literal.”\n\nBack when Baker was linking up with Sha Na Na, Albie and The Spellbinders, which began as British Invasion cover band in the mid-’60s, was also remaking itself into a ’50s revival act, adding keyboardist, sax player and singer Bruce “Rooster” Perry to the band.\n\nPerry is still with the group as is drummer Baby Ray Jordan, whose been keeping The Spellbinders beat since they began; Pete “Neiman” Ewas, bass, keyboard and vocals, who came on board in 1974; and guitarist/vocalist Mike Murphy who joined in 2001. The Spellbinders have opened for acts such as Mitch Ryder, Chubby Checker, The Shirelles, The Drifters, The Happenings, The Angels, and The Ink Spots.\n\nPerry, who hails from North Brighton, is a friend of Baker from way back.\n\n“I’ve known Lennie since 1971. He was just starting with Sha Na Na and I met him at a club in Stoughton. He came on stage and sat in with us, and whenever he wasn’t on the road he’d come down in sit in with us,” Perry says.\n\nBaker stopped performing in 2000 because of health reasons.\n\n“I always performed off and on but I didn’t play for like two years. Then I got a new kidney and I started to play again,” says Baker, who now keeps his performing dates within range of his Halifax home.\n\n“If Sha Na Na comes in and they call me, then I’ll go play with them,” Baker says. As for working with The Spellbinders, Baker says he’s always open.\n\n“If I got a gig, I play with them. If they got a gig and they can afford me, then they call me,” Baker says.\n\nSpeaking of the upcoming show, Baker says he’ll be singing as well as playing sax. “My voice is actually still getting better. I don’t know how, but it does,” says Baker who adds that he’ll be doing “everything from ‘Tears on My Pillow’ to ‘Wise Men Say.’ And I’ll do a slow version of ‘Pretty Little Angel Eyes.’”\n\nExpect to hear “Blue Moon” as well.\n\n“I’ve done ‘Blue Moon’ all over the world,” Baker says.\n\nPerry says that backing Baker seems like old times.\n\n“It’s kind of a continuance of that, even though it’s 35 years later,” he says. “It’s a hoot. It’s just fun. Playing with Lennie keeps us vital. You never grow old with rock ‘n’ roll.\"\n\nIf you go:\n\nWhat: Lennie Baker and The Spellbinders\n\nWhere: Sons of Italy Hall, 4966 Route 28, Cotuit.\n\nWhen: 7-11 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 29.\n\nTickets: $20, available at Puritan stores in Mashpee and Hyannis."
