        "text": "Sha Na Na is an American rock band that was formed in 1969 by a group of undergraduate students at Columbia University. They began as a glee club but transitioned to a rock band after their a cappella performances of 50s rock music became popular. Most notably, they performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival, performed in 97 episodes of the Sha Na Na variety show, and appeared in the 1979 musical film \"Grease\" as Johnny Casino as the Gamblers. They have released eighteen studio albums and continue to tour and perform live shows today. This button, along with other items, was released by Buddha Records in 1969 as part of the Rock n' Roll Revival press kit after signing Sha Na Na."
