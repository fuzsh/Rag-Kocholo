        "text": "The power didn't cut out when Sha Na Na performed immediately before Jimi Hendrix at the conclusion of the famously rain-soaked Woodstock festival in August 1969 in Bethel, N.Y.\n\nBut the Wurlitzer electric piano that this proudly retro-rocking band used at Woodstock half a century ago didn't fare so well on a recent Saturday afternoon when the current edition of the group performed three numbers in The Museum at Bethel Woods.\n\nThe keyboard is now in its 11th year on permanent display at the 10,000 square foot museum, which opened in 2008 and is part of the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. The center and museum are directly adjacent to the site of the 1969 Woodstock festival.\n\n\"After 50 years, the piano had just one more song in it!\" said Sha Na Na leader and co-founder John \"Jocko\" Marcellino, a longtime La Jolla resident.\n\nThat song was \"At The Hop,\" a 1958 chestnut first recorded by Danny & The Juniors. Sha Na Na's Saturday mini-concert at the museum concluded with the suddenly keyboard-less group's impromptu a cappella versions of \"Come Go With Me\" and \"Sixteen Candles.\"\n\nThe band, which also features San Diego bassist and guitarist Tim Butler, performed a full concert June 1 at an indoor concert venue housed with the Bethel Woods complex.\n\nBy coincidence, \"At The Hop\" is the only one of the 10 songs Sha Na Na performed at the legendary Woodstock festival that also made the final cut for the Oscar-winning 1970 \"Woodstock\" film documentary — and the triple-album soundtrack that accompanied the movie's release.\n\nA new documentary, \"Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation,\" opens a one-week run in San Diego today at Landmark's Ken Cinema. On Aug. 2, Rhino Records will release \"Woodstock — Back to the Garden — The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive.\" Limited to 1,969 individually numbered copies and priced at $799.98, it will contain 38 CDs with 432 musical performances, including Sha Na Na's complete Woodstock set. A 10-CD version will also be released.\n\nA 50th anniversary edition of the festival was announced in December and scheduled for mid-August at Watkins Glen in upstate New York. Yet, while an all-star lineup has been booked, tickets have yet to go sale and the event's fate remains unclear. Not so the new Sha Na Na album, \"50th Anniversary,\" which will be released June 21 and includes a 16-page booklet, titled \"“The Band That Was Born at Woodstock — How Ivy League Greasers Made It to the Most Infamous Hippie Festival in History.”\n\nRemarkably, Woodstock was only the seventh or eighth performance anywhere by Sha Na Na, which was co-founded by Marcellino, 10 of his fellow Columbia University students and a guitarist from nearby Brooklyn College. Their goal was to pay spirited tribute to the vintage rock and doo-wop music of the 1950s.\n\nThe then-fledgling Sha Na Na got the Woodstock gig after Hendrix heard them play at a New York club. He enthusiastically encouraged the producers to hear and book the band. They did.\n\n“I saw Sha Na Na at Steve Paul’s Scene and they knocked me out, so I invited them to play the festival,” Michael Lang, one of the four co-producers of Woodstock, said in a 2009 Union-Tribune interview.\n\nSha Na Na was scheduled to perform on the second night of the three-day Woodstock festival, which drew an estimated 400,000 music fans and was billed as \"three days of love and music.\" Despite a dramatic lack of infrastructure and organization, the festival quickly became a landmark event of the fast-budding counterculture movement.\n\nThat lack of organization — and a monsoon-like storm that turned the festival site into a massive mud bath — saw Sha Na Na's scheduled Saturday night Woodstock performance get pushed back until after sunrise on Monday morning. The festival's producers wanted to yank Sha Na Na out of the lineup; Hendrix insisted they be allowed to take the stage and the promoters acquiesced.\n\n\"We got $350 to play at the festival and the check bounced!\" Marcellino, who was 19 at the time, recalled with a hearty laugh.\n\n\"And we got paid $1 for agreeing to be in the movie, although I don't know if we ever actually got that dollar. But it was great — Woodstock changed our lives.\"\n\nMarcellino laughed again as he described the impact of playing at the festival, which paved the way for Coachella, Lollapalooza, KAABOO, England's Glastonbury, Brazil's Rock in Rio and a host of other outdoor music festivals around the world. Playing at Woodstock led to Sha Na Na being signed by Kama Sutra Records, extensive concert tours — \"Bruce Springsteen and Hall & Oates opened for us!\" Marcellino recalled — being featured in the hit 1978 movie \"Grease\" and the syndicated \"Sha Na Na\" TV series, which aired from 1977 to 1981.\n\n\"After Woodstock, I had to go back to Columbia University and tell my football coach — who had recruited me — that I had to quit the team,\" recalled Marcellino, whose Columbia roommate — Sha Na Na keyboardist Joseph Witkin — left the band in 1970 and became a doctor in San Diego.\n\n\"I said: 'Coach, we played at Woodstock this summer and I got a two-album record deal',\" Marcellino continued. \"He said: 'Well, there are windows in life, that — if they open — you have to go through.' So he gave me his blessing.\""
