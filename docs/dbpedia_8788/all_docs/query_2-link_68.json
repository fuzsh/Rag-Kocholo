        "text": "Bear with me. You might think this has nothing to do with Sha Na Na, but it does. In addition to the show itself, I’m also interested in other appearances the TV-Ten were making during this period.\n\nA few weeks ago, I wrote about Pierre Cossette’s involvement with sports entertainment shows. Along with musical variety shows, these shows also seemed to be a staple of the ’70s. I’m not just talking about the random potpourri of athletes, musicians, singers, comedians, actors and the occasional brother of the President of the United States appearing together at the Super Dome, I’m talking about actual Olympic-style events carried out by celebrity non-athletes. Today, of course, we have something along those lines with competition shows like Dancing with the Stars and Splash, but they’re really not the same. I know they have their fans, but half of the celebrities that appear on these shows are more of the reality-show or famous-for-being-famous type, and as a result, leave me to not care much about them.\n\nThat said, if you were around in the mid-70s, you most likely remember Battle of the Network Stars. Like me, you may have also cared about it. To us kids, it was must-see TV and we’d gather in one of the neighborhood living rooms to cheer on our favorite TV stars and/or major television network. It didn’t really matter if you were a sports fan or not, because the games themselves were pretty entertaining. Who wouldn’t want to watch teams compete in a water-relay with inflatable kayaks which seemed to move backwards and sideways more than forward, or a large-scale game of Simon Says called by a Catskills comedian? The show actually ran from 1976 until 1988, but the first few years were the best, and it will always symbolize the 70s for me. You can still catch reruns on ESPN Classic.\n\nAnyway, Battle of the Network Stars was so popular in those first years that the idea spun off into other formats featuring such ideas as TV stars performing circus acts (Circus of the Stars) and Olympic sports with cartoons characters (Scooby-Doo’s Laff-a-Lympics). That brings me to the Rock ‘n’ Roll Sports Classic. Being a fan of Battle of the Network Stars, I remember seeing this in its original run and being really excited about it. The cast of participants was amazing, and yes, Sha Na Na was there. Additionally, there were some really major musical acts appearing. Basically, like “Battle” the participants were divided up into teams, in this case, East versus West.\n\nOn the East team you had:\n\nSha Na Na\n\nThe Jacksons (and not just the Jackson 5, but LaToya and Janet are there too)\n\nBoston\n\nELO\n\nMarilyn McCoo & Billy Davis\n\nGladys Knight & The Pips\n\nAnne Murray\n\nAlessi Brothers\n\nHelen Schneider\n\ncaptain Phyllis Diller\n\nco-captain Susan Anton\n\nOn the West:\n\nRod Stewart\n\nThe Commodores\n\nEarth, Wind and Fire\n\nKenny Loggins\n\nThe Runaways\n\nFreddie Fender\n\nTanya Tucker\n\nLeif Garrett\n\nSeals & Croft\n\ncaptain Sandy Duncan\n\nco-captain Barbie Benton\n\nNot too shabby. On top of that you had the following:\n\nhost Alex Karras\n\nco-host Ed McMahon\n\ncorrespondent Michelle Phillips\n\ncorrespondent Kristy McNichol\n\nannouncer Fred Travelina\n\nThe Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders\n\nThe teams gathered at the University of California Irvine for 20 mostly track and field and swimming events to compete for trophies by Cartier and whatever proceeds made going to college scholarships.\n\nA lot of the musicians actually turn out to be pretty good athletes. Marlon Jackson, Kenny Loggins and the Runaways–particularly Joan Jett and Sandy West–are very impressive. The problem is, no one seems to be having a lot of fun. At least not in the beginning. Yeah, there are some smiles, mostly from the winners, but the overcast skies aren’t the only thing putting a damper on the festivities. Maybe I’m not being fair, but you get the sense that most of them didn’t want to be there, and too often these events seem like a job that needs to be done. In fact, with how little you see Rod Stewart, you get the feeling he just popped by late in the afternoon to kick a ball around and go for a quick run before calling it a day.\n\nLuckily, Sha Na Na turns out to be the show’s saving grace–in my opinion, at least. Not only did they perform admirably (Santini, Screamin’ and Chico are greased lightning on the track), but they brought the fun, and it was infectious. No matter the competition, they’re clearly not taking it all too seriously and have no problem parodying themselves to lighten the mood. According to Santini, as the day went by, the show’s directors were coming to the band to get more schtick on film. On top of that, you can see a team camaraderie between Sha Na Na and the Jacksons on the East that bring some more glimpses of fun when the team members are together. Eventually, the other musicians appear to lighten up as well. Props to Phyllis Diller for also bringing the comedy, but you have to feel for her because her one liners to Alex Karras and the other correspondents seem to go over their heads.\n\nWith that lengthy introduction, below are some stills highlighing Sha Na Na’s involvement in the one and only “Rock-n-Roll Sports Classic”. One and only, because I don’t think anyone wanted to go through this again.\n\nSha Na Na shows the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders a thing or two with their own cheers.\n\nThe boys line up for the team hurdle relay.\n\nChico is off to a great start.\n\nLine up for the somethingsomething dash.\n\nOh, there was a basketball game with Santini, Johnny, Denny and the Jacksons. No idea who won but the rest of the guys cheered them on.\n\nSantini shines in the men’s relay, winning it for Team East.\n\nBowzer demonstrates one of his own sports for greasers, which includes muscle-flexing and endurance mouth-opening.\n\nLennie explains how he came in last in the marathon walk against Freddy Fender.\n\nBut everyone loves Lennie, and they cheer him up with a song.\n\nDonny prepares for the team long jump, shades and all.\n\nBI-cycle, BI-cycle…race.\n\nJohnny fights for first place.\n\nThe gang get into the men & women’s relay.\n\nThere was fun and games off the field as well (although, I really wished Denny had whacked Leif with that towel).\n\nFinally, the East won with best out of three in the tug-of-war.\n\nAll in all, the Rock ‘n’ Roll Sports Classic could never compete with Battle of the Network Stars, but it’s one of those things that could only happen in the 70s. Which, as you can probably tell, was probably for the best."
