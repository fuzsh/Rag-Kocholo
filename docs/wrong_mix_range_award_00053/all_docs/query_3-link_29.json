        "text": "George Bernard Shaw\n\nPlaywright\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), the acclaimed dramatist, critic and social reformer, was born in Dublin where he grew up in an atmosphere of genteel poverty. He attended four schools and was tutored by a clerical uncle, but left his formal schooling behind him at the age of 15. Shaw declared himself a socialist in 1882 and joined the Fabian Society in 1884; soon he distinguished himself as a fluent and effective public speaker and an incisive and irreverent critic of music, art and drama. Shaw’s first play, Widowers’ Houses, was produced privately in 1892 and was followed by The Philanderer and Mrs. Warren’s Profession. More palatable, though still rich with challenges to conventional middle-class values, were his Plays Pleasant (1898) which included Arms and The Man, Candida, The Man of Destiny and You Never Can Tell. In 1897 Shaw attained his first commercial success with the American premiere of The Devil’s Disciple, which enabled him to quit his job as a drama critic and to make his living solely as a playwright. Among his plays presented at the Royal Court Theatre were the premieres of John Bull’s Other Island (1904), Man and Superman (1905), Major Barbara (1905) and The Doctor’s Dilemma (1906). Pygmalion, by far his most popular work, was first performed in 1913. During World War I, Shaw’s anti-war pamphlets and speeches made him very unpopular as a public figure. In Heartbreak House (1920) he exposed the spiritual bankruptcy of the generation responsible for the carnage. Next came Back to Methuselah (1922) and Saint Joan (1923), acclaim for which led to his receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1926. Shaw continued to write plays and essays until his death in 1950 at the age of 94.\n\nCourtesy of the Shaw Festival.\n\nBy Zachary Moull, courtesy of American Conservatory Theater guide.\n\nAerial Battlship Weaponized airships were a futuristic idea in 1906, when Major Barbara is set. The first real-world use of bomber planes was in 1911; they weren’t in heavy use until the latter half of World War I. Likewise, bullet-proof cars, like the one Undershaft drives, were not in widespread circulation until World War II.\n\nBursting Strain The outward force caused by the explosion that launches a projectile from heavy artillery.\n\nCantin’ Speaking sanctimoniously and hypocritically.\n\nCommercial Travelers Traveling salesmen.\n\nCorker Something shocking that leaves someone speechless, sealed up like a wine bottle with a cork in it.\n\nDiapason A rich burst of sound.\n\nDone in the Eye To have been taken advantage of.\n\nFitter A factory worker who puts metal parts together to make mechanical devices.\n\nGabble Speech that is incoherent or unintelligible.\n\nGolden Syrup The West Ham Salvation Army shelter serves treacle, a sweet condiment similar to molasses that is a by-product of the process that refines sugar cane into sugar crystals.\n\nGrand Duke Hand Grenade In 1905, Russian Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich was assassinated in Moscow by a member of a militant socialist faction, who threw a handheld nitroglycerin grenade into the duke’s carriage. Grenades were a favorite tool of revolutionaries and political assassins at the time of the play—and the years that followed.\n\nGun Cotton Highly flammable, gun cotton (nitrocellulose) is made by treating cotton wool with sulphuric acid and nitric acid and was used as an explosive in large cannons, such as those found on battleships.\n\nJawrin’ Slang for talking at length.\n\n“Jumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turnedout” Jumped-up means arrogant or selfimportant. Jerked-off means thrown out or discarded.\n\nOrspittle-turned-out means turned away from hospitals.\n\nKites Related to hawks and eagles, kites are scavengers that feed on carrion; a battlefield would be a feast for them.\n\n“And sent to the knackers like an old horse.” A knacker is a type of butcher that specializes in animals not fit for human consumption.\n\nList Slippers Footwear that is worn around loose gunpowder, because the hard strike of a normal shoe’s heel could ignite the powder.\n\nLyddite An explosive substance developed near the British town of Lydd in 1888 that was used in British armorpiercing artillery shells during the Boer War (1899–1902) and World War I.\n\nPotwalloper A person who was entitled to vote because he had a fireplace large enough to boil a pot of water, as was the rule in certain British boroughs under archaic election laws. The laws were reformed in 1832, but the word stayed in use as an insult for a foolish or uncouth person.\n\nPrimrose League The Primrose League, founded in 1883, was an organization dedicated to spreading the Conservative Party’s principles throughout Britain by hosting dinners and other social gatherings.\n\n“A sally from heaven” A sally was a sudden attack in which soldiers rush towards the enemy; also, The Salvation Army is sometimes referred to as Sally or Sally Ann.\n\n“Scrape and catlap” Scrape refers to margarine spread on bread.\n\nCatlap is slang for watered-down milk.\n\n“The money is settled.” A common practice among the wealthy at the time of the play, Undershaft would have settled or fixed a large sum of money on Lady Britomart when they married. Her household has since been supported by the interest that money earned.\n\nSkyblue Watered-down milk, which has a bluish tinge.\n\n“Thirteen four” The fighter Todger Fairmile weighs 13 stone and 4 pounds. As one stone unit is equal to 14 pounds, Fairmile weighs 186 pounds, making him a heavyweight by early-twentieth-century standards.\n\nTied House A bar that is owned by a brewer or distiller and only sells that manufacturer’s product.\n\nWoolwich Infant A type of cannon built at London’s Woolwich Arsenal in the late 1800s, the ironically named Woolwich Infant weighed upwards of 35 tons and fired a 700-pound cannonball, making it one of the largest cannons of its time."
