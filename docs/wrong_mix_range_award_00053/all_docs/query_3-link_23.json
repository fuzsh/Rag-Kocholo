        "text": "May 12, 2021\n\nPERCIVAL. [to Hypatia] Does that satisfy you, Miss Tarleton?\n\nHYPATIA. Yes: that will teach him to tell lies next time.\n\nBENTLEY. [rising to make place for Gunner and handing him the pen]\n\nYou mean it will teach him to tell the truth next time.\n\nFebruary 17, 2021\n\nThere once was a fine group of people in a fine country house with a fine glass pavilion -- a crystal palace of sorts -- and this fine group of people was made up of fine folks from the upper class: lords who were diplomats to Genghis Khan (not the murderous thug but a region); fine folks from the middle class: a merchant, his wife and their children (albehim a merchant of underwear, making them sort of fruit of the loon-type folk); and these fine folk had gathered together to debate some fine issues and ideas, and to discuss some fine ideas and issues, and to use these fine ideas and issues to flirt and to fight. But wait! that's not all because a Goggled Man (a pilot of the flimsiest sort of biplane) and his passenger, a Polish, acrobatic dominatrix, crash in the garden outside that fine sort of crystal palace just before a lower middle class (white collared clerk, don't you know) anarchist comes in guns at the ready to fight for the honour of his dead mother (who doesn't need his anarchism or her honour). And along with this fine group of people were those fine issues and ideas that they would discuss and debate, and fight and flirt over: everything from that \"vulgar\" socialism to the independence of women, from anarchy to the dependence of moneyed boys, from class struggle to the ridiculousness of the wedding state -- and all would be well versed and poorly versed and opinionated and clever and foolish and playful and funny and somehow lovable. And all would be the people of Bernard Shaw's glorious imagination. And all would make my son's and my COVID isolation that much less painful. Bravo, Bernard!\n\nJanuary 4, 2018\n\nRead this before seeing The Orange Tree Theatre’s production. If I had read it afterward, it might have got a fourth star! The cast and direction were superb and really brought Shaw’s lopsided and over-wordy contraption to life. Good things here: he plays quite radically with gender roles and assumptions; the play’s major theme is feminist (there’s a brilliant and fiery last speech by Lina the Polish aviator, Mrs Pankhurst could hardly have done better) - and socialism vegetarianism and teetotalism get a look in too (paring back on the ideas and debate might have helped the drama). But in a good performance, this was charming and funny, and felt relevant.\n\nJune 6, 2018\n\nA little dated, enjoyable, fine acting\n\nDecember 19, 2022\n\nThis was the first play I have read from George Bernard Shaw, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Most of the humor still lands! In spite of the play being set in contemporary times 113 years ago, unfortunately most of the problems of the characters have yet to be solved.\n\nThe world is still full of old men who think the best of themselves and very little of anyone else, young men who think only about money, idealistic mentally ill activists, and manipulative jerks. The women of the story are less the subject of the playwright's derision, though one in particular is very intent on being wicked, and they still get a lot of the funniest lines.\n\nMy one caveat is that the play contains quite a lot of ideas and language that are offensive to a modern reader: sexism, classism, endorsements of violence, and racism, including using the N word twice. Here's the bit of dialogue where the N word is used with the slur removed. I think the author was clearly expressing disapproval for these ideas but you may judge for yourself:\n\nTARLETON. Good thing the empire. Educates us. Opens our minds. Knocks the Bible out of us. And civilizes the other chaps.\n\nLORD SUMMERHAYS. Yes: it civilizes them. And it uncivilizes us. Their gain. Our loss, Tarleton, believe me, our loss.\n\nTARLETON. Well, why not? Averages out the human race. Makes the ██████ half an Englishman. Makes the Englishman half a ██████.\n\nLORD SUMMERHAYS. Speaking as the unfortunate Englishman in question, I don't like the process. If I had my life to live over again, I'd stay at home and supercivilize myself.\n\nTARLETON. Nonsense! Don't be selfish. Think how you've improved the other chaps. Look at the Spanish empire! Bad job for Spain, but splendid for South America. Look at what the Romans did for Britain! They burst up and had to clear out; but think of all they taught us! They were the making of us: I believe there was a Roman camp on Hindhead: I'll shew it to you tomorrow. Thats the good side of Imperialism: it's unselfish. I despise the Little Englanders: they're always thinking about England. Smallminded. I'm for the Parliament of man, the federation of the world. Read Tennyson.\n\nJuly 10, 2020\n\n3.5*\n\nI listened to this full cast audiobook edition (courtesy of the LATW website) and read along in my Kindle omnibus \"The Plays of Shaw\". If I hadn't been reading along, I wouldn't have realized that this audiobook edition is slightly abridged. In the end, the difficulty of matching the two editions was too much trouble so I listened to the audio then went back and read the text.\n\nI did like the cast of the audiobook and understand why most of the cuts were made but I found the original play funnier (plus, I like Shaw's stage directions & commentary). I would put the written text at 4* while this audiobook edition was only 3.5*.\n\nFebruary 8, 2020\n\nThis was my first acquaintance with George Bernard Shaw. And WTF?!\n\nOver the years I have read so many interesting quotes by this author. Now after finishing this revelry of a drama, I really want to read more.\n\nFebruary 24, 2017\n\nCertainly an experiment for Shaw, at least in the character Lina Szczepanowska, who goes further to defy gender norms. This play was from 1908, but feels so contemporary! Thanks again to L.A. Theatre Works, whose 2004 version I listened to. Superbly acted, it's a real joy for my morning commutes.\n\nDecember 19, 2020\n\nI originally tried to read this play earlier this year and bailed. I am an avid reader and theater goer but, for some reason, I struggle to read plays. There is just a disconnect between the text and my brain. However, I listened to the audio with the full cast and the story became immediately better. I enjoy British humor. The play was overall pretty decent and it made me really miss being able to go to the theater!\n\nMay 19, 2018\n\nIt's enjoyable to listen to the conversation mixing cynicism with idealism, men's desire with women's wishes. Shaw's comments on marriage are always funny. Somehow I don't imagine Shaw was having a bad marriage, but rather he thinks the concept is a little dull. It's paradoxical that what he deems dull is the source of the numerous funny lines in his play.\n\nApril 9, 2020\n\nProbably works better in live, face-to-face/video performance than on the page or strictly audio. In contrast to, say, \"Arms and the Man,\" this felt like a light comedy of manners disguised as a free-for-all argument about gender politics and class divisions/exploitation.\n\nNovember 30, 2017\n\nLove all the feminism in this book, and it was funny and charming. Mostly it was little pointless and pretty harsh on marriage. It's easy to dismiss marriage if you've never had a good one.\n\nOctober 21, 2021\n\nMisalliance is probably my least favourite Shaw play. It's still a very enjoyable read if you're a fan of the playwright. However, if you've never read Shaw, I wouldn't start here.\n\nOctober 21, 2022\n\na nice little play of ancient usages and customs.\n\nJanuary 4, 2019\n\nLike his previous play, \"Getting Married,\" George Bernard Shaw's \"Misalliance\" is written in one continuous act. Lots of characters come and go. The basic theme seems to be that the men and women are paired incorrectly (misallied). One of the best characters was an aviatrix who literally falls from the sky and disrupts things. Her last name, of Polish background, starts Szcz... and is bungled in various ways by many of the other characters.\n\nI enjoyed the play all right, but while working through it I debated whether to pause my project of reading Shaw in roughly chronological order. By this stage in his career, the plays are long and the introductions are longer. It's getting tiring! But I think I will persevere. Pretty soon I will be running up against the end of public domain status, which will hamper my preferred way to read these plays (free eBooks on my phone).\n\nTo sum up, \"Misalliance\" is middling Shaw. Not the best and not the worst, but you should probably start elsewhere.\n\nJuly 30, 2015\n\nThere are very few areas of literature about which I'm not utterly ashamed to be almost-entirely ignorant, but perhaps none is quite so egregious as the amount of Irish classics I've largely foregone. And so to my first Shaw (not only have I never read any; I once lost out on winning a film quiz by not knowing he remains the only person to win both Nobel Prize and Oscar), which had me cackling to the point where co-workers started to look concerned (I work a dull desk job where I've recently realised I can just plug in audiobooks and tune out of everything; Librivox's free performance of this highly recommended). Not so much casually radical as casually caustic in showing contemporary society quite how far behind it was where simple matters or equality seemed to be radical. Gosh, it's a lark.\n\nJuly 25, 2020\n\nOne of my favorite Shaw plays so far. Social critique is nicely blended with an engaging story and delightful characters. Nicely over the top while still remaining grounded. Though some of the concerns are certainly dated, it works as long as you keep it in the timeperiod in which it was written (though its current relevance is obviously limited).\n\nSeptember 22, 2014\n\nLong and the ending is a little dissatisfying (except for the fact that you've reached the end). However, there are some great thoughts in there and some hilarious moments. Overall I enjoyed it and would love to see this done locally.\n\nJune 21, 2011\n\nI once did one of Bently's monologues for an audition, so this play will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nMarch 17, 2014\n\nThis is an enjoyable work from Bernard Shaw. An uproarious comedy about the family of John Tarleton, a millionaire owner of Tarleton’s Underwear. Very funny indeed!\n\nApril 5, 2015\n\nAnother great Shavian play. I am going to be sad when I finish all of them.\n\nOctober 25, 2015\n\nI found myself laughing constantly. I also found myself wanting to find someone like Lina."
