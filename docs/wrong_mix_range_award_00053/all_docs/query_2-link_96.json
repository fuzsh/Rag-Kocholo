George Bernard Shaw was a famous Irish playwright who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925. He wrote many plays between 1893 and 1929 that were popular on Broadway. His most famous work is Pygmalion, written in 1912, which tells the story of a professor who bets he can pass off a poor flower girl as a duchess by teaching her to speak with an upper class accent. Shaw used the play to discuss issues of class, society, gender, and language barriers in England at the time. Pygmalion remains extremely popular today, best known from the musical adaptation My Fair Lady.",
