        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature 1925 was awarded to George Bernard Shaw \"for his work which is marked by both idealism and humanity, its stimulating satire often being infused with a singular poetic beauty\"\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1926. During the selection process in 1925, the Nobel Committee for Literature decided that none of the year's nominations met the criteria as outlined in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to the Nobel Foundation's statutes, the Nobel Prize can in such a case be reserved until the following year, and this statute was then applied. George Bernard Shaw therefore received his Nobel Prize for 1925 one year later, in 1926.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1925. NobelPrize.org.
