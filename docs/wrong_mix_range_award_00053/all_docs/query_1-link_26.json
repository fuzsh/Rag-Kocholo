        "text": "ashutosh K.\n\nashutosh K.\n\nbanker\n\nPublished Oct 12, 2022\n\nTHE NOBEL PRIZE IS NOT SO NOBEL\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAlfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers. He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer.\n\nWhat is special about Cordite?\n\nNobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. Cordite was a name-brand smokeless powder originally developed by Sir James Dewar and Sir Fredrick Able (United Kingdom) in 1889. It was produced to replace military gunpowder (now known as black powder). It was produced in rather long features similar to spaghetti called “cord powder”. A major drawback to the original form was that this cord powder, was so large it had to be put into cylinder cartridge brass before it was formed (creating the bottleneck). It was reformulated into several other propellants. Cordite MD was a modified mixture of Cordite Mk1 to burn cooler and save on barrel wear; 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. Cordite RDB was developed with collodion (nitrocellulose in soluble form) 52% nitrocellulose, 42% nitroglycerine, and 6% petroleum jelly. Cordite SC was a process of producing cordite without solvents (solvents are what make nitrocellulose into collodion). Cordite N was produced by adding nitroguanidine to the nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine mixture making this cordite a triple-base powder and specifically designed for naval guns. It was used initially used in the .303 British, Mark I and II, standard rifle cartridge between 1891 and 1915. However, shortages of cordite in World War I led to smokeless powders being imported into the UK from the United States. It was also used for large weapons, such as tank guns, artillery, and naval guns. It has been used mainly for this purpose since the beginning of World War I by the UK and British Commonwealth countries. Its use was further developed in the early years of World War II, for launching 2-inch and 3-inch diameter non-rotated, anti-aircraft projectiles. Small cordite rocket charges were also developed for ejector seats made by the Martin-Baker Company. It is now obsolete and it is no longer produced. It has been replaced by other propellants, such as the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of extruded powder or the WC844 ball propellant currently in use in the5.56 *45 mm NATO. Production ceased in the United Kingdom, around the middle of the 20th century, with the closure of the last of the World War II cordite factory at ROF Bishopton. However, cordite propellant may still be encountered in the form of legacy ammunition dating from World War II onwards. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.\n\nIn 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary. titled \"The merchant of death is dead\", in a French newspaper. It was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died; the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo Italy, from a cerebral hemorrhage. He was 63 years old. Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime. He composed the last over a year before he died, signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895. Alfred Nobel’s will stated that 94% of his total assets should be used to establish the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize was funded by Alfred Nobel's personal fortune. According to official sources, Alfred Nobel bequeathed most of his fortune to the Nobel Foundation which now forms the economic base of the Nobel Prize. To widespread astonishment, Nobel's last will specify that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in physics, chemistry, Physiology medicine, and peace\n\nConstitution of the Nobel Foundation\n\nBecause of its incredulity close to the will, it was not approved by the Storting Storting represents the ultimate expression of the sovereignty of the Norwegian people. Through Storting, it is the people who govern the country, introduce legislation, authorize public spending, impose taxes and control the work of the Government. There are 169 elected Members of the Storting. Parliamentrting in Norway until 26 April 1897. The executors of the will, Ragnar Sohlman, and Rudolf Lilljequist formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of the fortune and to organize the awarding of prizes. According to his will and testament read in Stockholm on 30 December 1896, a foundation established by Alfred Nobel would reward those who serve humanity. He also bequeathed all of his \"remaining realizable assets\" to be used to establish five prizes which became known as \"Nobel Prizes.\" Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million SEK (c. US$186 million, €150 million in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes.\n\nThe Nobel Foundation was founded as a private organization on 29 June 1900. Its function is to manage the finances and administration of the Nobel Prizes. In accordance with Nobel's will, the primary task of the foundation is to manage the fortune Nobel left. Robert and Ludvig Nobel were involved in the oil business in Azerbaijan, and according to Swedish historian E. Bargengren, who accessed the Nobel family archive, it was this \"decision to allow withdrawal of Alfred's money from Baku that became the decisive factor that enabled the Nobel Prizes to be established”. Another important task of the Nobel Foundation is to market the prizes internationally and to oversee informal administration related to the prizes. The foundation is not involved in the process of selecting the Nobel laureates. In many ways, the Nobel Foundation is similar to an investment company, in that it invests Nobel's money to create a solid funding base for the prizes and administrative activities. The Nobel Foundation is exempt from all taxes in Sweden since 1946 and from investment taxes in the United States since 1953.\n\nFoundation capital and cost\n\nThe capital of the Nobel Foundation today is invested 50% in shares, 20% in bonds, and 30% in other investments (e.g., hedge funds or real estate). The distribution can vary by 10 percent. At the beginning of 2008, 64% of the funds were invested mainly in American and European stocks, 20% in bonds, and 12% in real estate and hedge funds. In 2011, the total annual cost was approximately 120 million kronor, with 50 million kronor as the prize money. Further costs to pay institutions and persons engaged in giving the prizes were 27.4 million kronor. The events during the Nobel week in Stockholm and Oslo cost 20.2 million kronor. The administration, Nobel symposium, and similar items had costs of 22.4 million kronor. The cost of the Economic Sciences prize of 16.5 million kronor is paid by the Sveriges Riksbank.\n\nAccording to the statutes, the foundation consists of a board of five Swedish or Norwegian citizens, with its seat in Stockholm. The Chairman of the Board is appointed by the Swedish king in Council, with the other four members appointed by the trustees of the prize-awarding institutions. An Executive Director is chosen from among the board members, a deputy director is appointed by the King in Council, and two deputies are appointed by the trustees. However, since 1995, all the members of the board have been chosen by the trustees, and the executive director and the deputy director appointed by the board itself. As well as the board, the Nobel Foundation is made up of the prize-awarding institutions (the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the trustees of these institutions, and auditors.\n\nNobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901. Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace (Nobel characterized the Peace Prize as \"to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses\")\n\nFORMATION OF THE NORWEGIAN NOBEL COMMITTEE\n\nNobel's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize, the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize-awarding organizations were designated. These were the Karolinska Institute on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June. The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II. In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved. In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) funded the establishment of the Prize in Economic Science, in Memory of Alfred Nobel, to also be administered by the Nobel Foundation.\n\nThe prize ceremonies take place annually. Each recipient (known as a \" laureate\") receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a monetary award. In 2021, the Nobel Prize monetary award is 10,000,000 SEK. A prize may not be shared among more than three individuals, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organizations of more than three people. Although Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize is presented. The Nobel Prize, beginning in 1901, and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, beginning in 1969, has been awarded 609 times to 975 people and 25 organizations. Five individuals and two organizations have received more than one Nobel Prize.\n\nSTART OF IMPLEMENTATION OF 1ST NOBLE PRIZE IN 1901\n\nOnce the Nobel Foundation and its guidelines were in place, the Nobel Committee began collecting nominations for the inaugural prizes. Subsequently, they sent a list of preliminary candidates to the prize-awarding institutions.\n\nNominations\n\nNomination forms are sent by the Nobel Committee to about 3,000 individuals, usually in September the year before the prize is awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award. The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names. The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.\n\nSelection\n\nThe Nobel Committee then prepares a report reflecting the advice of experts in the relevant fields. This, along with the list of preliminary candidates, is submitted to the prize-awarding institutions. There are four awarding institutions for the six prizes awarded: the Royal Swedish Nobel Academy of Sciences, the Nobel Assemble at the Karolinska Institute, the Swedish Academy, and the Norwegian Noble Committee. The institutions meet to choose the laureate or laureates in each field by a majority vote. Their decision, which cannot be appealed, is announced immediately after the vote. A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected per award. Except for the Peace Prize, which can be awarded to institutions, the awards can only be given to individuals.\n\nAward process\n\nOn February 1 the six Nobel Committees—one for each prize category—start their work on the nominations received. Outside experts are frequently consulted during the process in order to help the committees determine the originality and significance of each nominee’s contribution. During September and early October, the Nobel Committees accomplished their work and submit their recommendations to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and other prize-awarding institutions. A committee’s recommendation is usually but not invariably followed. The deliberations and the voting within these institutions are secret at all stages. The final decision by the awardees must be made by November 15. Prizes may be given only to individuals, except the Peace Prize, which may also be conferred upon an institution. An individual may not be nominated posthumously, but a winner who dies before receiving the prize may be awarded it posthumously, as with Dag Hammarskjold, (for peace; 1961), Erik Axel Karlfeldt (for literature; 1931), and Ralph M Stenman (for physiology or medicine; 2011). (Steinman was named a winner several days after his death, which was unbeknownst to the Nobel Assembly. It was decided that he would remain a Nobel laureate since the purpose of the posthumous rule was to prevent, prizes from being deliberately awarded to deceased individuals.) The awards may not be appealed. Official support, whether diplomatic or political, for a certain candidate, has no bearing on the award process because the prize awarders, as such, are independent of the state.\n\nThe award process is similar for all of the Nobel Prizes, the main difference being who can make nominations for each of them. A Gunnar Oquist of the laureates in Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 by Gunnar Oquist, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature announcement by Peter in Swedish, English, and German.\n\nPosthumous nominations\n\nAlthough posthumous nominations are not presently permitted, individuals who died in the months between their nomination and the decision of the prize committee were originally eligible to receive the prize. This has occurred twice: the 1931 Literature Prize was awarded to Erik Axel Karlfeldt, and the 1961 Peace Prize was awarded to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold. Since 1974, laureates must be thought alive at the time of the October announcement. There has been one laureate, William Vickery, who in 1996 died after the prize (in Economics) was announced but before it could be presented. On 3 October 2011, the laureates for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine were announced; however, the committee was not aware that one of the laureates, Ralph M Steinman, had died three days earlier. The committee was debating Steinman's prize since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously. The committee later decided that as the decision to award Steinman the prize \"was made in good faith\", it would remain unchanged.\n\nRecognition is given after a certain time lag and somebody got it through false discovery\n\nNobel will provide prizes to be awarded in recognition of discoveries made \"during the preceding year\". Early on, the awards usually recognized recent discoveries. However, some of those early discoveries were later discredited. For example, Johannes Fibiger was awarded the 1926 Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his purported discovery of a parasite that caused cancer. To avoid repeating this embarrassment, the awards increasingly recognized scientific discoveries that had withstood the test of time. According to Ralf Pettersson, former chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Physiology or Medicine, \"the criterion, 'the previous year' is interpreted by the Nobel Assembly as the year when the full impact of the discovery has become evident.\" The interval between the award and the accomplishment it recognizes varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognize a cumulative lifetime body of work rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, in 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for his work to resolve international conflicts. However, they can also be awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords. The most recent controversy was caused by awarding of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in his first year as US President.\n\nAwards for physics, chemistry, and medicine are typically awarded once the achievement has been widely accepted. Sometimes, this takes decades – for example, Subrahmanyam Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Physics Prize for his 1930s work on stellar structure and evolution. Not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some discoveries can never be considered for a prize if their impact is realized after the discoverers have died. Except for the Peace Prize, the Nobel Prizes are presented in Stockholm, Sweden, at the annual Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The recipients' lectures are normally held in the days prior to the award ceremony. The Peace Prize and its recipients' lectures are presented at the annual Prize Award Ceremony in Oslo, Norway, usually on 10 December. The award ceremonies and the associated banquets are typically major international events. The Prizes awarded in Sweden's ceremonies are held at the Stockholm Concert Hall, with the Nobel banquet following immediately at Stockholm City Hall. The Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been held at the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905–1946), at the auditorium of the University of Oslo (1947–1989), and at Oslo City Hall (1990–present).\n\n1st Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nThe Nobel Committee's Physics Prize shortlist cited Wilhelm Rontgen’s discovery of X-rays and Philipp Lenard's work on cathode rays. Wilhelm Rontgen received the first Physics Prize for his discovery of X- rays. The Academy of Sciences selected Röntgen for the prize. In the last decades of the 19th century, many chemists made significant contributions. Thus, with the Chemistry Prize, the academy \"was chiefly faced with merely deciding the order in which these scientists should be awarded the prize\". The academy received 20 nominations, eleven of them for Jacobus van t Holf. Van 't Hoff was awarded the prize for his contributions to chemical thermodynamics.\n\n1st Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nThe Swedish Academy chose the poet Sully Prudhomme for the first Nobel Prize in Literature. A group including 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticized this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation is that most of the academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet.\n\n1st Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nThe first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.\n\n1st Nobel Prize in Peace\n\nThe first Nobel Peace Prize went to the Swiss Jean Henri Dunant for his role in founding the International Red Cross Movement. and initiating the Geneva Convention, and jointly given to French pacifist Frederic Passy, founder of the Peace League and active with Dunant in the Alliance for Order and Civilization.\n\nThe king of Sweden first refused to give to foreigners but later succumbed to a chance of publicity.\n\nThe highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of the King of Sweden. In Oslo, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway and the Norwegian Royal family. At first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that he changed his mind once his attention had been drawn to the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden.\n\n1st Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nIn 1968, Sweden's central bank Sveriges Riksbank celebrated its 300th anniversary by donating a large sum of money to the Nobel Foundation to be used to set up a prize in honor of Alfred Nobel. The following year, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was awarded for the first time. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences became responsible for selecting laureates. The first laureates for the Economics Prize were Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch \"for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes\". The board of the Nobel Foundation decided that after this addition, it would allow no further new prizes.\n\nCelebration after the prize:\n\nAfter the award ceremony in Sweden, a banquet is held in the Blue Hall at the Stockholm City Hall, which is presented by the Swedish Royal Family and around 1,300 guests. The Nobel Peace Prize banquet is held in Norway at the Oslo Grand Hotel, after the award ceremony. Apart from the laureate, guests include the president of the Storting, on occasion the Swedish prime minister, and, since 2006, the King and Queen of Norway. In total, about 250 guests attend.\n\nNobel lecture\n\nLaw of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate is obligated to give a public lecture about a story about success in getting the Prize in the subject of their works. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize, but some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organized by the same association which selected the laureates.\n\nPrizes: Medals, Diploma, and Cash prize\n\nThe Nobel Foundation announced on 30 May 2012 that it had awarded the contract for the production of the five (Swedish) Nobel Prize medals to Svenska Medalj AB. Between 1902 and 2010, the Nobel Prize medals were minted by Myntveket (the Swedish Mint), Sweden's oldest company, which ceased operations in 2011 after 107 years. In 2011, the Mint of Norway, located in Kongsberg, made the medals. The Nobel Prize medals are registered trademarks of the Nobel Foundation. Each medal features an image of Alfred Nobel in the left profile on the observation. The medals for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death. Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Peace Prize medal and the medal for the Economics Prize, but with a little diverse design. For instance, the laureate's name is engraved on the rim of the Economics medal. The image on the reverse of a medal varies according to the institution awarding the prize. The reverse sides of the medals for chemistry and physics share the same design.\n\nLaureates receive a heavily decorated diploma together with a gold medal and prize money. All medals made before 1980 were struck in 23-carat gold. Since then, they have been struck in 18 carats of green gold plated with 24-carat gold. The weight of each medal varies with the value of gold but averages about 175 grams (0.386 lb.) for each medal. The diameter is 66 MMS (2.6 in) and the thickness varies between 5.2 MMS (0.20 in) and 2.4 MMS (0.094 in). Because gold use of the high value of their gold content and the tendency to be on public display, Nobel medals are subject to medal theft. During World War II, the medals of German scientists Max von Laue and James Franck were sent to Copenhagen for safekeeping. When Germany invaded Denmark, Hungarian chemist (and Nobel laureate himself) George de Hevesy dissolved them in aqua regia. (nitro-hydrochloric acid), to prevent confiscation by Nazi Germany and to prevent legal problems for the holders. After the war, the gold was recovered from the solution, and the medals re-cast.\n\nDiplomas\n\nNobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden, or in the case of the peace prize, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them. The diploma contains a picture and text in Swedish which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize. None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has ever had a citation on their diplomas.\n\nAward money\n\nThe laureates are given a sum of money when they receive their prizes, in the form of a document confirming the amount awarded. The amount of prize money depends upon how much money the Nobel Foundation can award each year. The purse has increased since the 1980s, when the prize money was 880,000 SEK per prize (c. 2.6 million SEK altogether, US$350,000 today). In 2009, the monetary award was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million). In June 2012, it was lowered to 8 million SEK. If two laureates share the prize in a category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients. If there are three, the awarding committee has the option of dividing the grant equally or awarding one-half to one recipient and one-quarter to each of the others. It is common for recipients to donate the prize money to benefit scientific, cultural, or humanitarian causes.\n\nWhy does Nobel Prize treat as Nobel: Controversies and criticisms\n\nThe controversial recipient'sPeace prize\n\nWhen it was announced that Henry Kissinger was to be awarded the Peace Prize, two of the Norwegian Nobel Committee members resigned in protest. Among other criticisms, the Nobel Committees have been accused of having a political agenda, and of omitting more deserving candidates. They have also been accused of Eurocentrism, especially for the Literature Prize. Among the most criticized Nobel Peace Prizes was the one awarded to Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. Kissinger was awarded the prize for negotiating a ceasefire between North Vietnam and the United States in January 1973. However, when the award was announced, both sides were still engaging in hostilities. Critics sympathetic to the North announced that Kissinger was not a peace-maker but the opposite, responsible for widening the war. Those hostile to the North and what they considered its deceptive practices during negotiations were deprived of a chance to criticize Lê Đức Thọ, as he declined the award. The satirist and musician Tom Lehrer has remarked that \"political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\" Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, and Yitzhak Rabin received the Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts in making peace between Israel and Palestine. Immediately after the award was announced, one of the five Norwegian Nobel Committee members denounced Arafat as a terrorist and resigned. Additional misgivings about Arafat were widely expressed in various newspapers.\n\nAnother controversial Peace Prize was that awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations had closed only eleven days after Obama took office as the President of the USA, but the actual evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated that he did not feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company in which it would place him. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, so prompted accusations of a liberal bias.\n\nCriticism in awarding some of the Literature Prize\n\nThe award of the 2004 Literature Prize to Elfriede Jelinek drew a protest from a member of the Swedish Academy, Knut. Ahnlund resigned, alleging that the selection of Jelinek had caused \"irreparable damage to all progressive forces, it has also confused the general view of literature as an art\". He alleged that Jelinek's works were \"a mass of text to be shoveled together without artistic structure\". The 2009 Literature Prize to Herta Muller also generated criticism. Lots of literary critics and professors were ignorant of her work. This made those critics feel the prizes were too Eurocentric. The 2019 Literature Prize to Peter Handke received heavy criticism from various authors, such as Salman Rushdie and Hari Kunzru, and was condemned by the governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Turkey due to his history of Bosnian genocide denialism and his support for Slobodan Milosevic.\n\nOverlooked achievements without any logic and reason\n\nMahatma Gandhi was nominated five times, but not awarded a Nobel Peace Prize. Although Gandhi, an icon of nonviolence in the 20th century, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times, in 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1947, and a few days before he was assassinated on 30 January 1948, he was never awarded the prize. In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Norwegian Nobel Committee decided to make no award that year on the grounds that \"there was no suitable living candidate\". In 1989, this omission was publicly regretted, when the 14th Dalai Lamba. was awarded the Peace Prize, the chairman of the committee said that it was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\".\n\nGeir Lundestad, 2006 Secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said,\n\nThe greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubted that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace Prize. Whether the Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question.\n\nOther high-profile individuals with widely recognized contributions to peace have been overlooked. In 2009, an article in Foreign Policy magazine identified seven people who \"never won the prize, but should have\". The list consisted of Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Vaclav Eleanor Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Sari Nusseibeh, Corazon Aquino, and Liu Xiaobo. Liu Xiaobo would go on to win the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize while imprisoned. In 1965, UN Secretary-General U Thant was informed by the Norwegian Permanent Representative to the UN that he would be awarded that year's prize and asked whether or not he would accept. He consulted staff and later replied that he would. At the same time, Chairman Gunnar Jahn of the Nobel Peace prize committee lobbied heavily against giving U Thant the prize and the prize was at the last minute awarded to UNICEF. The rest of the committee all wanted the prize to go to U Thant, for his work in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis, ending the war in the Congo, and his ongoing work to mediate an end to the Vietnam War. The disagreement lasted three years and in 1966 and 1967 no prize was given, with Gunnar Jahn effectively vetoing an award to U Thant. Jayme’s Joyce is one of the controversial omissions of the Literature. Adam Kirsch Prize. The Literature Prize also has controversial omissions. He even suggested that many notable writers have missed out on the award for political or extra-literary reasons. The heavy focus on European and Swedish authors has been a subject of criticism. The Eurocentric nature of the award was acknowledged by Peter Englund, the 2009 Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, as a problem with the award and was attributed to the tendency for the academy to relate more to European authors. This tendency towards European authors still leaves many European writers on a list of notable writers that have been overlooked for the Literature Prize, including Africa’s Chinua Achebe. Candidates can receive multiple nominations in the same year. Gaston Ramon received a total of 155 nominations in physiology or medicine from 1930 to 1953, the last year with public nomination data for that award as of 2016. He died in 1963 without being awarded. Pierre Paul Emile Roux received 115. nominations in physiology or medicine, and Arnold Sommerfeld received 84 in physics. These are the three most nominated scientists without awards in the data published as of 2016. Otto Stern received 79 nominations in physics from 1925–1943 before being awarded in 1943.\n\nThe strict rule against awarding a prize to more than three people is also controversial. When a prize is awarded to recognize achievement by a team of more than three collaborators, one or more will miss out. As per one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three-person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013. All five physicists arrived at the same conclusion, albeit from different angles. Hagen contends that an equitable solution is to either abandon the three-limit restriction or expand the time period of recognition for a given achievement to two years. The Economics Prize was not awarded to Fisher Black, who died in 1995 when his co-author Myron Scholes received the honor in 1997 for their landmark work on option pricing along with Robert C. Merton, another pioneer in the development of valuation of stock options. In the announcement of the award that year, the Nobel committee prominently mentioned Black's key role. Political subterfuge may also deny proper recognition. Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassman, who co-discovered nuclear fission along with Otto Hahn, may have been denied a share of Hahn's 1944 Nobel Chemistry Award due to having fled Germany when the Nazis came to power. The Meitner and Strassman roles in the research were not fully recognized until years later when they joined Hahn in receiving 1966. Enrico Fermi Award.\n\nEmphasis on discoveries over inventions\n\nAlfred Nobel left his fortune to finance annual prizes to be awarded \"to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\". He stated that the Nobel Prize in Physics should be given \"to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics\". Nobel did not emphasize discoveries, but they have historically been held in higher respect by the Nobel Prize Committee than inventions: 77% of the Physics Prizes have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23% to inventions. Christoph Bartneck and Matthias Rauterberg, in papers published in Nature and Technogenic Arts, have argued this emphasis on discoveries has moved the Nobel Prize away from its original intention of rewarding the greatest contribution to society.\n\nGender disparity\n\nThere has been a total of 57 women Nobel laureates compared to 873 male laureates. Most female laureates received them in the peace and literature categories. Marie Curie was the first female to receive the Nobel Prize in 1903 and the only woman to receive it twice. In terms of the most prestigious awards in STEM fields, only a small proportion have been awarded to women. Out of 210 laureates in Physics, 181 in Chemistry, and 216 in Medicine between 1901 and 2018, there were only three female laureates in physics, five in chemistry, and 12 in medicine. Factors to the incongruity between this and about equal human sex ratio include biased nominations, fewer women than men being active in the relevant fields, Nobel Prizes typically being awarded decades after the research was done, a greater delay in awarding Nobel Prizes for women's achievements making longevity a more important factor for women (no nomination to the Nobel Prize posthumously), and an inclination to ignore women from jointly awarded Nobel Prizes Despite these factors, Marie Curie is to date the only person awarded Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics) in 1903, (Chemistry in 1911); she is one of only three people who have received two Nobel Prizes in sciences Malala Yousafzai is the youngest person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. When she received it in 2014, she was only 17 years old.\n\nStatus of the Economic Sciences Prize\n\nPeter Nobel describes the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel as a \"false Nobel prize\" that dishonors his relative Alfred Nobel, after whom the prize is named, and considers economics to be a pseudoscience.\n\nStatistics about various features and uniqueness\n\n1. Youngest person awarded a Nobel Prize: Malala Yousufzai at the age of 17, received Peace Prize in 2014.\n\n2. Oldest person to get a Nobel Prize: For Chemistry John B Goodenough at 97 in 2019.\n\n3. Women Marie Curie won twice Noble Prizes in Physics in 1903 and in Chemistry in 1911.\n\n4. IC of the Red Cross thrice Nobel peace prize in 1917, 1944, and 1963.\n\nFamily laureates: An example\n\nThe Curie family has received the most prizes, with four prizes awarded to five individual laureates. Marie Curie received prizes in Physics (in 1903) and Chemistry (in 1911). Her husband, Pierre Curie, shared the 1903 Physics prize with her. Their daughter, Irene Joliot Curie, received the Chemistry Prize in 1935 together with her husband Frederic Joliot -Curie. In addition, the husband of Marie Curie's second daughter, Henry Labouisse, was the director of UNICEF when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on that organization’s behalf.\n\nRefusals and constraints.\n\nRichard Kuhn was forced to decline his Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Two laureates have voluntarily declined the Nobel Prize. In 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre was awarded the Literature Prize but refused, stating, \"A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.\" Le Duc Tho, chosen for the 1973 Peace Prize for his role in the Paris Peace Accords, declined, stating that there was no actual peace in Vietnam. George Bernard Shaw attempted to decline the prize money while accepting the 1925 Literature Prize; eventually, it was agreed to use it to found the Anglo -Swedish Literary Foundation.\n\nIn 1958, Boris Pasternak declined his prize for literature due to fear of what the Soviet Union government might do if he traveled to Stockholm to accept his prize. In return, the Swedish Academy refused his refusal, saying \"this refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award.\" The academy announced with regret that the presentation of the Literature Prize could not take place that year, holding it back until 1989 when Pasternak's son accepted the prize on his behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, but her children accepted the prize because she had been placed under house arrest in Burma. Suu Kyi delivered her speech two decades later, in 2012. Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 while he and his wife were under house arrest in China as political prisoners, and he was unable to accept the prize in his lifetime.\n\nm the considerable research that goes into the selection of the prizewinners. Although the winners are announced in October and November, the selection process begins in the early autumn of the preceding year, when the prize-awarding institutions invite more than 6,000 individuals to propose, or nominate, candidates for the prizes. Some 1,000 people submit nominations for each prize, and the number of nominees usually ranges from 100 to about 250. Among those nominating are Nobel laureates, members of the prize-awarding institutions themselves; scholars active in the fields of physics, chemistry, economics, and physiology or medicine; and officials and members of diverse universities and learned academies. The respondents must supply a written proposal that details their candidates’ worthiness. Self-nomination automatically disqualifies the nominee. Prize proposals must be submitted to the Nobel Committees on or before January 31 of the award year.\n\nThe general principles governing awards were laid down by Alfred Nobel in his will. In 1900 supplementary rules of interpretation and administration were agreed upon between the executors, representatives of the prize-awarding institutions, and the Nobel family and were confirmed by the king in the council. These statutory rules have on the whole remained unchanged but have been somewhat modified in the application. For example, Nobel’s stipulation that the prizes be awarded for achievements made during “the preceding year” was obviously unworkable in regard to scientists and even writers, the true significance of whose discoveries, research, or writings might not be generally apparent for several years. Nobel’s ambiguous stipulation that the literature prize is awarded to the authors of works of an “idealistic tendency” was interpreted strictly in the beginning but has gradually been interpreted more flexibly. The basis for the economics award was scientific i.e., mathematical or statistical, rather than political or social. The Nobel Prizes for physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine have generally been the least controversial, while those for literature and peace have been, by their very nature, the most expose Peace Prize has been the prize most frequently reserved or withheld.\n\nAsle Toje, Deputy Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, answers some of the most common questions about the nomination and selection process.\n\nNobel Prize Conversations: The making of a Nobel Prizes laureate\n\nIn this special bonus episode of Nobel Prize Conversations, we explore the origin stories of these remarkable individuals. team of female Yazidi deminers in Iraq attempting to clear their land of mines left behind by ISIS. A team of scientists on an extraordinary mission in Mozambique to help better our understanding of climate change. A man building prosthetic legs to help victims of war walk again in South Sudan … All are inspired by Nobel Peace Prize laureates.\n\nDEFEAT LED TO SUCCESS\n\nEvery laureate face failure and set-back on their path to the Nobel Prize. It is a topic they are frequently asked about at events. A painting by Swedish artist Emil Österman depicting the founder of the Nobel Prize, Alfred Nobel. He was an inventor, entrepreneur, scientist, and businessman who also wrote poetry and drama. His varied interests are reflected in the prize he established and which he lay the foundation for in 1895 when he wrote his last will, leaving much of his wealth to the establishment of the prize. Since 1901, the Nobel Prize has been honored. Alfred Nobel's work Inventing dynamite. Based on Alfred’s work During his lifetime he acquired 355 patents worldwide. Bottom of Form\n\nBetween 1901 and 2022, the Nobel Prizes and the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel were awarded 615 times to 989 people and organizations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 954 individuals and 27 organizations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is clearly evident that there are so many differences/hot discussions that took place which is summarized as under\n\n1. Many times, selection committee members even left it.\n\n2. Since the 1st Nobel Prize differences of opinion observed.\n\n3. Literature stress was given to fiction.\n\n4. So many differences in Nobel Peace Prize appeared from 1901 till date.\n\n5. There is a bias towards Europeans.\n\n6. There is bias against sex.\n\n7. Nominal African people got this Prize.\n\nSo, Nobel Prize is not so noble."
