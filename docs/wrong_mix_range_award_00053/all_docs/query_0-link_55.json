In 1837, his father went alone to St. Petersburg, Russia for business. His whole family moved to St. Petersburg in 1842 after his success. Later, Alfred Nobel enrolled in an elite school, achieving fluency of English, French, German, and Russian. At the age of 18, he went to the United States to study chemistry for four years, laying the foundation for him to become an outstanding chemist, engineer, inventor and military equipment manufacturer.\n\nIn addition, the invention of explosives gave Alfred Nobel the name of \"the father of explosives.\" However, Alfred Nobel was a pacifist. He felt heart-broken when he saw explosives with his name being used in wars and killings. In 1895, Alfred Nobel made a will, hoping to use his life's wealth to create a fund to reward people who would make significant contributions to mankind. Since then, the \"Nobel Prize\" was born. Starting from 1901, \"the persons who have made significant contributions to mankind in the previous year\" are selected every year for the five categories of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. Since 1969, economic awards have been added. The various awards are selected by different agencies: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is responsible for the Physics Prize, Chemistry Prize and Economics Prize; the Karolinska Institutet is responsible for the Physiology and Medicine Prize; the Peace Prize is the responsibility of the Norwegian Nobel Committee; the Literary Prize is decided by the selection of the Swedish Academy. The Nobel Prize has a history of 120 years. More than 960 winners and organizations have received awards, making it the most prestigious award in the field.\n\nView List of Books Exhibited\n\nFurther Reading"
