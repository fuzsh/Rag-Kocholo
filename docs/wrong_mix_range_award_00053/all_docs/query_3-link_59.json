        "text": "hard times novel by charles dicken by quratulain akhter\n\nhard times novel by charles dicken by quratulain akhter Quratulainakhter\n\nHard Times (1854), dickens has constructed an almost entirely mechanized world of people, ideas and environments. This suggests that the natural and corresponding counterpart always needs to fight for its self-preservation among characters‚Äô perceptions and within settings. The philosophy mirrors the mechanical characteristics of industrialisation and hence expresses the great importance of mechanical perceptions such as objective utilitarianism and factual statistics. Importance i. Hard Times has also been described as a novel which asks most clearly to be read not as a mere fictional world but as a commentary on 4 a contemporary crisis ii. The novel is therefore not only supposed to be a pleasant and entertaining read. iii. It is a work of fiction which contains a serious depth and has an underlying gravity which is important to be aware of. iv. It is both criticism of industrialism and an attempt to raise awareness among people about how they think. v. Hard Times has the effect of tempting the reader to reflect upon his or her situation and how they believe they live their lives, as well as how they imagine their relationships with others are.\n\nCodeavour 5.0 International Impact Report - The Biggest International AI, Cod...\n\nCodeavour 5.0 International Impact Report - The Biggest International AI, Cod...Codeavour International\n\nUnlocking potential across borders! üåç‚ú® Discover the transformative journey of Codeavour 5.0 International, where young innovators from over 60 countries converged to pioneer solutions in AI, Coding, Robotics, and AR-VR.
