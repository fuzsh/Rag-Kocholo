        "text": "Is there any connection between the Oscars and the Nobel Prize, except that those who won either of them are the epitome of their respective fields. It's a rare occurance when a person has the distinction of winning both a Nobel Prize and an Oscar Trophy, except on two occasions. This rarest of rare feat was accomplished by Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw and American musician-songwriter Bob Dylan.\n\nShaw bagged both awards before Second World War. The Irish genius shot into global attention in 1925 when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his play, Saint Joan. Shaw had also written the famous plays Man and Superman (1902) and Pygmalion (1913). Thirteen years after he won the Nobel, Shaw's Pygmalion became the basis for the Hollywood movie of the same name. He won the Oscar for Pygmalion in 1938 to become the first person to achieve the feat.\n\nAlso Read: Oscars Nominations 2023: See Full List of Indian movies Nominees\n\nThe 81-year-old singer-songwriter Dylan is a music prodigy, whose songs have been influencing American society for sixty years, right from civil rights to anti-war campaigns. His Oscar-winning moment came in 2001, when he won the award for his song 'Things Have Changed', written for the film Wonder Boys. Given his reputation as an ace songwriter, it was much-awaited but not unexpected. But back then, not even his staunchest supporters, by any stretch of the imagination, would have thought that he would win the Nobel one day.\n\nFifteen years later, he would shock the global audience the same way Shaw would have by winning an Oscar. Dylan won the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".\n\nAlso Read: 2023 Oscar Academy Awards: Complete list of artists and songs to perform in 95th edition\n\nIn more than 120 years of Nobel history and 95 years of Oscar legacy, Shaw and Dylan are the only glittering stars in the elite club."
