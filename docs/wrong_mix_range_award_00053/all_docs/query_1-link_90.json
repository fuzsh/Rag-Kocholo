William Morris, H.G. Wells, and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHale, Piers J\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDuring the British socialist revival of the 1880s competing theories of evolution were central to disagreements about strategy for social change. In News from Nowhere (1891), William Morris had portrayed socialism as the result of Lamarckian processes, and imagined a non-Malthusian future. H.G. Wells, an enthusiastic admirer of Morris in the early days of the movement, became disillusioned as a result of the Malthusianism he learnt from Huxley and his subsequent rejection of Lamarckism in light of Weismann's experiments on mice. This brought him into conflict with his fellow Fabian, George Bernard Shaw, who rejected neo-Darwinism in favour of a Lamarckian conception of change he called \"creative evolution.\"\n\nFROM MRS WARRENâS PROFESSION TO PRESS CUTTINGS: THE WOMAN QUESTION IN GEORGE BERNARD SHAWâS PLAYS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBanu ÃÄÃNÃ\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available George Bernard Shaw, who introduced social realism to the British stage, is considered to be the most significant playwright of the Victorian era. In his plays, he challenged the typical Victorian representation of female characters and introduced a new woman type who stands as a powerful and independent figure. Shawâs female characters can be analysed in line with the suffragette movement, the fight given by British women to gain their right to vote. In this regard, Shawâs play Mrs Warrenâs Profession exemplifies a female character who can be considered as an advocate for female liberation and power. On the other hand, his play Press Cuttings, which was specifically written to support the suffragette movement, neither exemplifies the new woman image presented by Shaw in his plays nor contributes to the suffragette movement. Hence, this study aims to discuss the theme of the rights of women and to focus on George Bernard Shawâs Mrs Warrenâs Profession and Press Cuttings by means of Shawâs involvement in and support for the suffragette movement from the Victorian to the Edwardian era.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's \"Androcles and the Lion\": A Postmodernist Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHooti, Noorbakhsh; Jeihouni, Mojtaba\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study makes an attempt to analyze the manifold aspects of Shaw's \"Androcles and the Lion\" on a postmodernist standpoint, meanwhile, demonstrates the dominion of modernism, which is portrayed through the vehicle of comedy with a bitter ironic language through the play.

This priest became Cardinal and carried out his apostolate at Bordeaux for 47 years. 40 years after their meeting at Villefranche, Cardinal Donnet and Claude Bernard found again each other as \"SÃ©nateurs d'Empire\" in Paris. In his writings, Claude Bernard never mentioned Religion: he rather gave impression, in many ways, of being anticlerical! Paul Bert and his colleagues looked upon Claude Bernard as a great priest of atheism. Shortly after his death, Cardinal Donnet wrote a letter where he entirely proved that Claude Bernard has been, on the contrary, a fervent catholic.\n\nNÃ¤gemuslik Bernard Kangro / Livia Viitol\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nViitol, Livia, 1953-\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUrmas Bereczki kolmeosalise kunstieksperimendi tulemusena valmisid Bernard Kangro luuletustega CD, film \"Kesksuvetants\" ja raamat \"See sinine sirjendav kaugus.

Two of his sons entered the legal profession and two other sons became distinguished anatomists and surgeons--John Bell, said for 20 years to have been the leading operating surgeon in Britain and throughout the world--and Sir Charles Bell, possibly the most distinguished anatomist and physiologist of his day. Information is not known about the fifth son or their sister. Charles Shaw, a lawyer of Ayr, had four sons and two daughters who survived infancy. Two of his sons, John and Alexander, became anatomists and later surgeons at the Middlesex Hospital, and both worked closely with Charles Bell at the Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy. His third son entered the law and his fourth son became a distinguished soldier. The two daughters of Charles Shaw married into the Bell family: Barbara married George Joseph Bell and Marion married Mr (later Sir) Charles Bell.\n\nBernard of Clairvaux and the Cistercian Mystical Tradition\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMcGuire, Brian Patrick\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBernard of Clairvaux and the Cistercian mystical tradition; Bernard's hagiography, the Vita prima; Bernard, sharing with audience, perceptions of God's advent as the divine Word; Brothers of the New Monastery in 1098, less interest in the mystical; Medieval mystics and mystical traditions; Sensuous...\n\nPlutonium-induced osteosarcomas in the St. Bernard\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTaylor, G.N.; Thurman, G.B.; Mays, C.W.; Shabestari, L.; Angus, W.; Eaton, J.; Hitchman, J.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nThirteen osteosarcomas have been observed among the 7 St. Bernards that have died following the injection of 239 Pu.

In particular, it analyzes the Cahier Rouge (1850-1860), Bernard's acclaimed laboratory notebook. In this notebook, Bernard articulates the range of his experience as an experimental physiologist, juxtaposing without differentiation details of laboratory procedure and more personal queries, doubts, and reflections on experimentation, life, and art. Bernard's insights, it is argued, offer an aesthetic and phenomenological template for considering experimentation. His physiological point of view ranges from his own bodily aesthesis or sensory perception, through personal reflections on scientific discovery as an artistic process, to a broader metaphysical conception of life as an artistic creation. Such an aesthetic approach to physiology enables Bernard to reconcile his empirical methodology and his romantic idealism; it offers the history of laboratory science a framework for considering the individual, bodily, and emotional labor inherent in physiological experimentation.\n\nShaw Air Force Base Capital Improvement Program Environmental Assessment\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-05-01\n\nA FB Capital Im provem ent Program Environm ental A ssessm ent 3-21 Figure 3.6-1.

AprÃ¨s avoir Ã©tÃ© ravagÃ©e par le cyclone Katrina en 2005, St. Bernard peine Ã se redresser et montre le plus faible niveau de reprise de toute la rÃ©gion du Golfe du Mexique frappÃ©e par Katrina. De plus, la reconstruction est freinÃ©e par des polÃ©miques virulentes qui nous rappellent les pires annÃ©es des tensions raciales des annÃ©es 1960. Cet article sâintÃ©resse aux relations supposÃ©es entre les fragmentations urbaines et la facultÃ© dâadaptation aux risques naturels. LâÃ©tude du cas de St. Bernard illustre la force dâinertie des territoires et comment de vieilles querelles ville-banlieue affaiblissent la rÃ©silience urbaine.Located east of New Orleans, St. Bernard Parish is one of the most vulnerable parts of the greater New Orleans metropolitan area to storm surges. After having been devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, St. Bernard still struggles to recover from the storm, and displays the lowest recovery level of the entire Katrina-hit Gulf Coast area so far. Moreover, reconstruction is hampered by loud polemics that remind us of the worst years of racial polarization during the 1960âs. This paper explores the possible linkage between urban fragmentations and adaptive capacity to natural hazard. The St. Bernard case-study illustrates the strength of path dependency, and how long-entrenched suburb-central city mistrust hampers urban resilience.\n\nThe mathematical works of Bernard Bolzano\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nRuss, Steve\n\n2004-01-01\n\nBernard Bolzano (1781-1848, Prague) was a remarkable thinker and reformer far ahead of his time in many areas, including philosophy, theology, ethics, politics, logic, and mathematics.

SHAWS will measure and predict the stability/instability of a building, determine whether it is safe for emergency responders to enter during an emergency, and provide individual warnings on the condition of the structure. SHAWS incorporates remote sensing nodes (RSNs) installed on the exterior frame of a building. Each RSN includes a temperature sensor, a three-axis accelerometer making static-acceleration measurements, and a ZigBee wireless system (IEEE 802.15.4). The RSNs will be deployed remotely using an air cannon delivery system, with each RSN having an innovative adhesive structure for fast (<10 min) and strong installation under emergency conditions. Once the building has moved past a threshold (~0.25 in./building story), a warning will be issued to emergency responders. In addition to the RSNs, SHAWS will include a base station located on an emergency responder's primary vehicle, a PDA for mobile data display to guide responders, and individual warning modules that can be worn by each responder. The individual warning modules will include visual and audio indicators with a ZigBee receiver to provide the proper degree of warning to each responder.\n\nBernard Hyams (1925 - 2015)\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBernard Hyams, a distinguished scientist who worked at CERN for 32 years, died on 15 May 2015 at the age of 90. Â Â He started his career in Manchester, at Blackettâs laboratory, working on a magnetic spectrograph to measure the momentum of single cosmic ray particles (1950). Then, leading a group from Manchester University, he set up a cosmic ray experiment at the Pic du Midi Observatory in France.Â Having joined CERN in 1958, he performed one of the first experiments at the PS by demonstrating that in pion decay the muon spin behaves as expected. After studying vector meson decays into muon pairs, he spent several years working on precision pion measurements. When the ISR started operation in early 1971, it was realised that there was no experiment in place capable of looking for quarks, which was quite sobering, considering the ISR was constructed as a âdiscovery machineâ.

Over the past few decades we have seen major shifts in opinion as to what makes a business successful. The 1950's and 1960's saw a production focus whilst the 1970's and 1980's saw progressive change towards quality and 'customer is king' as key business drivers. A popular view now suggests that the next step change will be towards internal marketing, based on the concept that, in the future, winning employee support will be seen as the single biggest contributor to driving business performances.

It is suggested that the existence of these solutions might explain some of the complex behavior observed in recent experiments on rising bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. Solutions for a finite number of bubbles in a channel are also obtained. In this case, it is shown that solutions with an arbitrary bubble velocity U>V, where V is the fluid velocity at infinity, can in general be obtained from a simple transformation of the solutions for U=2V\n\nPerformance Evaluation and Opportunity Assessment for St. Bernard Project\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDickson, B.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThis report describes efforts by IBACOS, a Department of Energy Building America research team, in the St. Bernard Project, a nonprofit, community-based organization whose mission is to assist Hurricane Katrina survivors return to their homes in the New Orleans area.

M.; Dias, Eduardo O.; Miranda, JosÃ© A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nDespite the large number of existing studies of viscous flows in rotating Hele-Shaw cells, most investigations analyze rotational motion with a constant angular velocity, under vanishing Reynolds number conditions in which inertial effects can be neglected. In this work, we examine the linear and weakly nonlinear dynamics of the interface between two immiscible fluids in a rotating Hele-Shaw cell, considering the action of a time-dependent angular velocity, and taking into account the contribution of inertia. By using a generalized Darcy's law, we derive a second-order mode-coupling equation which describes the time evolution of the interfacial perturbation amplitudes. For arbitrary values of viscosity and density ratios, and for a range of values of a rotational Reynolds number, we investigate how the time-dependent angular velocity and inertia affect the important finger competition events that traditionally arise in rotating Hele-Shaw flows.\n\n[Technical information: The 'so called' Camille Bernard lower lip reconstruction: An eponymous confusion clarified].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMarck, K W; Martin, D\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe use of eponyms honours those who have contributed to the development of medicine and facilitates communication between colleagues.

Curare studies were, for example, of longstanding interest. His profound mental creativity and hand skillfulness, besides methodology quality, directed his experiments and findings, mainly at the CollÃ¨ge de France. His broader and epistemological concerns were carried out at the Sorbonne and later at the MusÃ©um national d'Histoire naturelle. His insight gave clues to define the â milieu intÃ©rieurâ, later known as âhomeostasisâ, and grasp the brain complexity. Bernard followed and surpassed his master FranÃ§ois Magendie who also fought against dogmas and laid the foundations of experimental medicine, and its main heinous tool â vivisection. Bernard created the methodological bases of experimental medicine, and collected honors as a renowned researcher.\n\nThe two Bernard Berenson cousins: The interplay among immigration, culture, and narcissism.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGoldberg, Susan G\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe lives of two 19th century cousins, both of whom changed their names to Bernard Berenson, are considered from historical and psychodynamic perspectives, using a psychobiographical method. The Jewish cousins immigrated separately to Boston from Lithuania in 1875 and 1882. One cousin, later calling himself simply B.B., became a world-renowned art historian. The other Bernard became a misanthrope after feeling deeply humiliated by his cousin's family in Boston. Many biographies were written about the famous B.B. The only histories of his cousin Bernard were family stories, as he was the author's great-grandfather. The intersecting lives of these cousins are discussed. Both men faced the challenges of immigration as well as intense anti-Semitism and prejudice in each country in which they lived. These cultural and historical conditions interacted with the cousins' narcissistic vulnerabilities. Their lives demonstrate different manifestations of narcissistic suffering, with B.B's being more consistent with the construct of a \"grandiose narcissist\" and Bernard's being more consistent with that of a \"closet narcissist.\" The life stories of these two cousins with the same name offers an intriguing instance of a complicated relationship among immigration, prejudice, and narcissism and case examples of the manifestation of how narcissistic suffering can influence lives.

One of these patterns is observed by the formation of multiple mirror images inside liquid bridges in a layer of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. We are presenting the existence of these patterns in foams and their relation with hyperbolic geometry and Sierpinski gaskets using the Poincare disk model. The images obtained from the experiment in foams are compared to the case of hyperbolic optical elements. -- Highlights: â The chaotic scattering of light in foams generating deltoid patterns is based on hyperbolic geometry. â The deltoid patterns are obtained through the Plateau borders in a Hele-Shaw cell. â The Plateau borders act like hyperbolic prism. â Some effects of the refraction and reflection of the light rays were studied using a hyperbolic prism.\n\nAn annotated translation of NoÃ«l Bernard's 1899 article 'On the germination of Neottia nidus-avis'.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSelosse, Marc-AndrÃ©; Minasiewicz, Julita; Boullard, Bernard\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe translate NoÃ«l Bernard's discovery of orchid symbiotic germination discovered on Neottia nidus-avis, as published in the May 1899 issue of the Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des sÃ©ances de l'AcadÃ©mie des sciences. In his note, Bernard (1874-1911) establishes the need for a fungus, which is also forming mycorrhizae in adults, for seeds germination. We provide illustrations reproduced from his later works, and summaries of the French text he cited. In our annotations, we show how early this discovery was done in Bernard's career, and insist on the scientific framework at the end of the nineteenth century, where orchid germination was mysterious and the need for vicinity of parents was not fully understood. We comment the text of Bernard on the basis of the most recent knowledge on Neottia nidus-avis and on orchid mycorrhizal fungi. Introducing his following papers, we finally discuss the emergence of the concept of peloton digestion, and how Bernard's work quickly paved the way to a general understanding of mycoheterotrophic germination in orchids and beyond.\n\nThe concept of the spiritual path in the views of Augustine and Bernard of Clairvaux: comparative analysis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. V. Timofeev\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article examines the transformation of St. Augustineâs anthropological views in virtually unexplored in Ukraine philosophical and theological teachings of the medieval mystic Bernard of Clairvaux. Research field focused on the issues of negative and positive theological approaches, metaphysical and existential position of philosophical view of the problem of man. Based on the study of foreign scientists, outlines the key aspects of Augustinian doctrine of the human desire for God, the theoretical basis for philosophical and theological views of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. The conclusions substantiated regarding the impact of anthropological views of St. Augustine on the formation of existential components in the concept of the spiritual path of Bernard of Clairvaux. Transforming an ontological approach to the problem of man in practical sense of being in God as a form of spiritual path, St. Bernard complements the existential aspect of Christian anthropology. By means of a comparative analysis revealed the originality of the authorâs approach St. Bernard to the problem of manâs spiritual development, which finds expression in the symbolic images of the spiritual marriage Â­ an allegorical interpretation of the relationship between God and the soul at the highest levels of mystical contemplation. Dominant moral and practical sense in the teaching of St. Bernard is presented as a justification for the tendency to anthropological turning in medieval philosophy.\n\nSeven decades of history of science: I.

Shaw arrived in Dallas to practice Thoracic Surgery in 1937, as John Alexander's 7th Thoracic Surgical Resident from Michigan University Medical Center. Dr Shaw's modus operandi was, \"You can accomplish almost anything, if you don't care who gets the credit.\" He was a remarkable individual who cared the most about the patient and very little about getting credit for himself. From 1937 to 1970, Dr Shaw established one of the largest lung cancer surgical centers in the world in Dallas, Texas. It was larger than M.D. Anderson and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospitals put together regarding the surgical treatment of lung cancer patients. To accomplish this, he had the help of Dr Donald L. Paulson, who trained at the Mayo Clinic and served as Chief of Thoracic Surgery at Brook Army Hospital during the Second World War. Following the War, because of his love for Texas, he ended up as a partner of Dr Shaw in Dallas. Together, they pursued the development of this very large surgical lung cancer center. Dr Shaw and his wife Ruth went to Afghanistan with Medico multiple times to teach men modern cardiac and thoracic surgery. They also served as consultants on Medico's Ship of Hope in Africa. Dr Shaw initiated multiple new operations including: 1) resection of Pancoast's cancer of the lung after preoperative irradiation; 2) upper lobe of the lung bronchoplasty, reattaching (and saving) the lower lobe to prevent the \"disabling\" pneumonectomy; and 3) resections of pulmonary mucoid impaction of the lung in asthmatics. Because of his humility and giving \"the credit to others,\" Dr Shaw was never President of a major medical or surgical association. Copyright Â© 2012 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

He actively took part to it from its very beginning by presenting various communications and several important memoirs. Epistemological thoughts found in these memoirs lead to the methodological chapters introducing the volumes of his edited lessons given at the CollÃ¨ge de France. In 1865, these texts formed the basis to his Introduction Ã l'Ã©tude de la MÃ©decine expÃ©rimentale, in which Bernard claims the experimental method should rely on the principle of determinism of the phenomena of Life. He was a dutiful President of the SociÃ©tÃ© from 1867 until his death. He nevertheless was not often involved in debates, but agreed on the defense of the scientific principles he had claimed. He remained influential until his death, as noted in 1899 by the report EngÃ¨ne Gley wrote on the SociÃ©tÃ© de Biologie during its fifty first years. Gley points regularly to Bernard's axioms which remained the true scientific credo of French biologists.\n\nVaremed ja aiad : barokk-kirjanduse esteetika Bernard Kangro Tartu-romaanides / Maarja Hollo\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nHollo, Maarja\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTuuakse vÃ¤lja barokk-kirjanduse ja Bernard Kangro romaanide olulisemad Ã¼hisjooned ning peatutakse Walter Benjamini allegooriakÃ¤sitlustel, mille valguses analÃ¼Ã¼sitakse Tartu-romaanides esinevaid allegoorilisi stseene\n\nLife support and euthanasia, a perspective on Shaw's new perspective.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBusch, Jacob; Rodogno, Raffaele\n\n2011-02-01\n\nIt has recently been suggested by Shaw (2007) that the distinction between voluntary active euthanasia, such as giving a patient a lethal overdose with the intention of ending that patient's life, and voluntary passive euthanasia, such as removing a patient from a ventilator, is much less obvious than is commonly acknowledged in the literature. This is argued by suggesting a new perspective that more accurately reflects the moral features of end-of-life situations. The argument is simply that if we consider the body of a mentally competent patient who wants to die, a kind of 'unwarranted' life support, then the distinction collapses. We argue that all Shaw has provided is a perspective that makes the conclusion that there is little distinction between voluntary active euthanasia and voluntary passive euthanasia only seemingly more palatable. In doing so he has yet to convince us that this perspective is superior to other perspectives and thus more accurately reflects the moral features of the situations pertaining to this issue.\n\nThe magic of knowledge exchange\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN Bulletin\n\n2010-01-01\n\nâIf you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple.

This procedure causes the formation of intricate interfacial patterns. Most theoretical studies determine the total number of emerging fingers by maximizing the linear growth rate, but this generates discrepancies between theory and experiments. In this work, we tackle the number of fingers selection problem in the lifting Hele-Shaw cell by employing the recently proposed maximum-amplitude criterion. Our linear stability analysis accounts for the action of capillary, viscous normal stresses, and wetting effects, as well as the cell confinement. The comparison of our results with very precise laboratory measurements for the total number of fingers shows a significantly improved agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data.

My main claim is that their arguments fail and are in need of substantial revision. To prove this I first introduce the topic, and then reconstruct Shaw et al.'s position and arguments. Next, I show that Shaw et al.: (1) failed to properly apply the subsidiarity and proportionality principles; (2) neglected species overlapping cases in their ethical assessment; (3) ignored the ethics literature on borderline persons; and (4) misunderstood McMahan's two-tiered moral theory. These mistakes render an important part of their conclusions either false or problematic to the point that they would no longer endorse them. Finally I will briefly mention a possible multipolar solution to the human organ shortage problem that would reduce the need for chimeras' organs.\n\nData mining of text as a tool in authorship attribution\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVisa, Ari J. E.; Toivonen, Jarmo; Autio, Sami; Maekinen, Jarno; Back, Barbro; Vanharanta, Hannu\n\n2001-03-01\n\nIt is common that text documents are characterized and classified by keywords that the authors use to give them. Visa et al. have developed a new methodology based on prototype matching. The prototype is an interesting document or a part of an extracted, interesting text. This prototype is matched with the document database of the monitored document flow. The new methodology is capable of extracting the meaning of the document in a certain degree. Our claim is that the new methodology is also capable of authenticating the authorship. To verify this claim two tests were designed. The test hypothesis was that the words and the word order in the sentences could authenticate the author. In the first test three authors were selected. The selected authors were William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, and George Bernard Shaw. Three texts from each author were examined. Every text was one by one used as a prototype. The two nearest matches with the prototype were noted. The second test uses the Reuters-21578 financial news database. A group of 25 short financial news reports from five different authors are examined. Our new methodology and the interesting results from the two tests are reported in this paper. In the first test, for Shakespeare and for Poe all cases were successful. For Shaw one text was confused with Poe. In the second test the Reuters-21578 financial news were identified by the author relatively well. The resolution is that our text mining methodology seems to be capable of authorship attribution.\n\nComputer simulation of viscous fingering in a lifting Hele-Shaw cell\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nWe simulate viscous fingering generated by separating two plates with a constant force, in a lifting Hele-Shaw cell.

Eccles-Certain implications of exile for the development of twentieth-century neurophysiology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nStahnisch, Frank W\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis article explores the work by Bernard Katz (1911-2003), Stephen W. Kuffler (1913-1980), and John C. Eccles (1903-1997) on the nerve-muscle junction as a milestone in twentieth-century neurophysiology with wider scientific implications. The historical question is approached from two perspectives: (a) an investigation of twentieth-century solutions to a longer physiological dispute and (b) an examination of a new kind of laboratory and academic cooperation. From this vantage point, the work pursued in Sydney by Sir John Carew Eccles' team on the neuromuscular junction is particularly valuable, since it contributed a central functional element to modern physiological understanding regarding the function and structure of the human and animal nervous system. The reflex model of neuromuscular action had already been advanced by neuroanatomists such as Georg Prochaska (1749-1820) in Bohemia since the eighteenth century. It became a major component of neurophysiological theories during the nineteenth century, based on the law associated with the names of FranÃ§ois Magendie (1783-1855) in France and Charles Bell (1774-1842) in Britain regarding the functional differences of the sensory and motor spinal nerves. Yet, it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that both the histological and the neurophysiological understanding of the nerve-muscle connection became entirely understood and the chemical versus electrical transmission further elicited as the mechanisms of inhibition. John C. Eccles, Bernard Katz, and Stephen W. Kuffler helped to provide some of the missing links for modern neurophysiology. The current article explores several of their scientific contributions and investigates how the context of forced migration contributed to these interactions in contingently new ways.\n\nReliability of Multiple Component Systems\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1975-07-15\n\nGeorge Washington University Bethesda, Maryland .20014 Dr. Larry Cornwell Western Illinois University Macomb, Illinois 61455 Dr. Lester A...Jersey 07801 Robert M.

Its conflict to principle of control make challenges to moral moral assessment, moral judgment and moral responsibility. Bernard Williams is the first philosopher who uses the expression \"moral luck\" and tries to show that the contradiction between âmoralâ and âluckâ is not so serious. Against Kantianâs idea and also our intuitions Williams doesnât believe that morality is immune of luck and that unlike other values, is accessible to all people. If moral value is accessible to all, according to his idea, it should be not only immune of luck but also supreme. Giving some examples, Williams by concepts like justification, regret and retrospective, shows that morality hasnât these characteristics. Dividing moral luck into four types: resultant, circumstantial, constitutive and causal, Thomas Nagel puts Williams' moral luck under the first type and criticizes it. This study seeks to explain Bernard Williamsâ viewpoint on moral luck. At first it clears types of moral luck, principle of control and its contradiction with moral luck, then after explaining Williamsâ account of moral luck criticizes it. Nagelâs criticisms and others show that although they accept the existence of moral luck and also their account is compatible to williamsâ but they deny williamsâ success in defending of this phenomenon. Finally, despite of all critiques, it seems that Williamsâ failure in defense of moral luck didnât decrease the importance of this matter, but made some stronger ideas were appeared by Thomas Nagel in this regard.\n\nRebeccah A.

Juxtaposing a freehand sketch with the digital image of the same project, Tschumi moves to address the paradox concerning the position of the body and drawing. This drawing also speaks for the reversal in the position of the body brought about by digital reproductivity.The reversal alludes to Tschumiâs theorization of architecture in terms of space and event. These, I will argue, are anticipated in The Manhattan Transcripts (1981 where a set of freehand drawings is used to evoke a filmic mood wherein the image is projected parallel to the spectatorâs seated position. The essay goes further, suggesting that the theatricality permeating the present architecture is part of the shift from horizontality to the painterly, and yet the phenomenon is not merely a technical issue. Rather, it alludes to architectureâs dialogical rapport with painting at work since the Renaissance.\n\nSloshing in a Hele-Shaw cell: experiments and theory\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nViola , Francesco; Gallaire , Francois; Dollet , Benjamin\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInternational audience; The response of the free liquid surface in a Hele-Shaw cell subjected to a horizontal oscillation is investigated. We study the low-oscillation-amplitude regime and we show, by varying the fluid viscosity, Î½, and the forcing frequency, Ï, that the ratio between the Stokes viscous length, 2Î½/Ï, and the cell thickness greatly affects the amplitude and phase lag of the gravity waves. In particular, the sloshing system undergoes an under-damped/overdamped transition for su...\n\nNew archeointensity results from the reconstructed ancient kiln by the Tsunakawa-Shaw method\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYamamoto, Y.; Hatakeyama, T.; Kitahara, Y.; Saito, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nYamamoto et al. (2015) reported that baked clay samples from the floor of a reconstructed ancient kiln provided a reliable Tsunakawa-Shaw (LTD-DHT Shaw) archeointensity (AI) estimate of 47.3 +/- 2.2 microT which is fairly consistent with the in situ geomagnetic field of 46.4 microT at the time of the reconstruction. The reconstruction was conducted to reproduce an excavated kiln of the seventh century in Japan and Sue-type potteries of contemporary style were also fired (Nakajima et al., 1974). Two of the potteries with reddish color were recently subjected to the Tsunakawa-Shaw archeointensity determinations, resulting in reliable AI estimates of 45.4 +/- 2.3 (N=6) and 48.2 +/- 2.7 microT (N=15) when specimens were heated in air in laboratory (Yamamoto et al., 2017 JpGU-AGU Joint Meeting). We have had another opportunity to take samples from a new reconstructed ancient kiln in Japan which was fired in autumn 2016. The samples were two Sue-type potteries with grayish color (bowl-type and plate-type) and some blocks collected from inner wall of the kiln body. They were cut into mini specimens and then subjected to the Tsunakawa-Shaw experiment. Heating in laboratory was done either in air or vacuum.For the bowl-type pottery, AIs of 46.9 +/- 2.8 (N=6, air) and 45.3 +/- 2.3 microT (N=6, vacuum) are obtained. They are indistinguishable each other and consistent with the IGRF field of 47.4 microT at the reconstructed location in 2016. For the plate-type pottery, AIs result in 41.8 +/- 1.3 (N=4, air) and 43.9 +/- 3.9 microT (N=4, vacuum). They are also indistinguishable each other but the former AI is slightly lower than the IGRF field.For the inner wall, AIs of 45.0 (N=1, air) and 46.8 microT (N=1, vacuum) are obtained from a right-side wall, and those of 45.5 +/- 2.5 (N=2, air) and 47.7 +/- 3.0 microT (N=2, vacuum) are observed from a left-side wall. They are all indistinguishable and consistent with the IGRF field.\n\nThe legacy of Douglas Guthrie (1885-1975), surgeon and medical historian.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMacintyre, Iain\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAfter graduating in medicine Douglas Guthrie embarked on a career as an ENT surgeon. When his Edinburgh hospital appointment ended in 1936 he began to write History of Medicine, which, thanks to a favourable review by George Bernard Shaw, became a worldwide best seller when first published in 1945. This marked the start of Guthrie's second career as a lecturer in history of medicine at the University of Edinburgh where his prime responsibility was delivering systematic lectures on medical history to medical undergraduates. At a time when history of medicine was virtually the exclusive preserve of medical doctors, Guthrie promoted to them the historiography techniques of the academic historian. His vision that social historians should become involved in the field and that history of medicine should be taught in arts and humanities faculties began to be adopted in British universities a decade or so after Guthrie made the recommendation. His legacy includes the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine and the British Society for the History of Medicine, both of which he helped to found. His name is commemorated in various charitable trusts which he established to promote the study of history of medicine.\n\nFaraday waves in a Hele-Shaw cell\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Jing; Li, Xiaochen; Chen, Kaijie; Xie, Bin; Liao, Shijun\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe investigate Faraday waves in a Hele-Shaw cell via experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies. Inspired by the Kelvin-Helmholtz-Darcy theory, we develop the gap-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and end up with the stable standing waves with half frequency of the external forced vibration. To overcome the dependency of a numerical model on the experimental parameter of wave length, we take two-phase flow into consideration and a novel dispersion relation is derived. The numerical results compare well with our experimental data, which effectively validates our proposed mathematical model. Therefore, this model can produce robust solutions of Faraday wave patterns and resolve related physical phenomena, which demonstrates the practical importance of the present study.\n\nGeorge Hampton (1920-2004)\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2004-01-01\n\nGeorge Hampton, who died recently, was CERN's Director of Administration in the 1960s and an important member of the team who managed the growth of CERN as it left the construction period and became a world-class physics laboratory. George came to CERN in the 1963, when the laboratory was just starting its main research activities after the intense period of construction for the Proton Synchrotron (PS). At that time the laboratory was passing through a major budget crisis, and the new Director-general, Viki Weisskopf, was faced with a completely new structure set up by his predecessor John Adams, with 12 divisions for running the laboratory reporting directly to him, and with four Directors. With the renewal of the position of Director of Administration in 1963, Weisskopf selected George Hampton from candidates from the Member States. He came from the UK Atomic Energy Authority, but had worked earlier as a delegate to the international Civil Aviation Organization.

R. Soc. Lon. A, 1958). For two non-reacting fluids in a radial Hele-Shaw cell the ability of the gas phase to penetrate the liquid phase is largely dependent on the gap height, liquid viscosity and gas pressure. In contrast combining two reactive fluids such as aqueous calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, which form a precipitate, presents a more complex but technically relevant system. As the two species react calcium carbonate precipitates and increases the aqueous phase visocosity. This change in viscosity may have a significant impact on how the gas phase penetrates the liquid phase. Experimental are performed in a radial Hele-Shaw cell with gap heights O(10-100) microns by loading a single drop of aqueous calcium hydroxide and injecting carbon dioxide into the drop. The calcium hydroxide concentration, carbon dioxide pressure and gap height are varied and images of the gas penetration are analyzed to determine residual film thickness and bursting times.\n\nKÂ pramenÅ¯m HusovÃ½ch Punkt: Jan Hus a Bernard Gui\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nSoukup, Pavel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 62, Ä. 1 (2015), s. 235-247 ISSN 1803-7429 R&D Projects: GA ÄR(CZ) GBP405/12/G148 Institutional support: RVO:67985955 Keywords : Medieval sermons * Hussitism * preaching aids * John Hus * Bernard Gui Subject RIV: AB - History http://hdl.handle.net/11222.digilib/134673\n\nThe Significance of the Sola Fide and the Sola Gratia in the Theology of Bernard of Clairvaux and Martin Luther\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPedersen, Else Marie Wiberg\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBy way of a forward reading of Bernard's and Luther's texts, this article demonstrates great similarities between Bernard and Luther, as well as between the Italian reform Catholics and Luther, in their understanding of faith and grace.

The most part of the liquid and granular material stays at the bottom of the cell, with only a small quantity of the mixture resting on the froth. The fractal dimensions of the final states of the foams are close to the values obtained from the Random Apollonian Packing model. The disperse structure of the granular material affects the probability distribution of number of sides of the foam bubbles. The nearest neighbor distances between the peaks of the sand piles at the bottom of the cell are close to a lognormal distribution.\n\nIn memoriam: Arthur Bernard Singer, 1917-1990\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRobbins, Chandler S.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nArthur Bernard Singer was born 4 December 1917, and died 6 April 1990. Although brought up in New York City, Arthur developed an early fascination with birds. His favorite haunts were the Bronx Zoo and the American Museum of Natural History, where Robert Cushman Murphy encouraged his efforts and where Arthur acquired a worldwide perspective. After graduating from Cooper Union Art School in New York City in 1939, he began his career as an art teacher, art director, and designer, His real interest, however, was in depicting the postures and plumages of birds and mammals. As early as 1941 his wildlife art was exhibited at the Bronx Zoo. While he was in the army, his wife Edith (âJudyâ) helped mount this first exhibit; Arthur never saw the show.\n\nA tribute to George Plafker\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFuis, Gary S.; Haeussler, Peter J.; Atwater, Brian F.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn a long and distinguished career, George Plafker made fundamental advances in understanding of megathrust tectonics, tsunami generation, paleoseismology, crustal neotectonics, and Alaskan geology, chiefly by means of geological field observations. George discovered that giant earthquakes result from tens of meters of seismic slip on subductionÂ megathrusts, and he did this before the theory of plate tectonics had become a paradigm. The discovery was founded on George's comprehensive mapping of land-level changes in the aftermath of the 1964 earthquake in Alaska, and on his follow-up mapping, in 1968, in the region of the 1960 earthquakes in Chile. The mapping showed paired, parallel belts of coseismic uplift largely offshore and coseismic subsidence mostly onshore â a pattern now familiar as the initial condition assumed in simulations of subduction-zone tsunamis. George recognized, moreover, that splay faulting can play a major role in tsunami generation, and he also distinguished carefully between tectonic and landslide sources for the multiple tsunamis that accounted for nearly all the fatalities associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake. George's classic monographs on the 1964 earthquake include findings on subduction-zone paleoseismology that he soon extended to include stratigraphic evidence for cyclic vertical deformation at the Copper River Delta, as well as recurrent uplift evidenced by flights of marine terraces at Middleton Island. As a geologist of earthquakes, George also clarified the tectonics and hazards of crustal faulting in Alaska, California, and other areas worldwide. All the while, George was mapping bedrock geology in Alaska, where he contributed importantly to today's understanding of how terranes were accreted and modified. Especially important was his documentation of the origin, movement, subduction, and collision of the Yakutat terrane in southern Alaska.\n\nGeorge Chester Stone (1924-2013).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAdler, Nancy\n\n2014-01-01\n\nGeorge Chester Stone was born February 21, 1924, and died on July 13, 2013.

A small perturbation of the radially symmetric problem is first considered, focussing on the behaviour just before the bubble vanishes, it being found that for shear-thinning fluids the radially symmetric solution is stable, while for shear-thickening fluids the aspect ratio of the bubble boundary increases. The borderline (Newtonian) case considered previously is neutrally stable, the bubble boundary becoming elliptic in shape with the eccentricity of the ellipse depending on the initial data. Further light is shed on the bubble contraction problem by considering a long thin Hele-Shaw cell: for early times the leading-order behaviour is one-dimensional in this limit; however, as the bubble contracts its evolution is ultimately determined by the solution of a WienerâHopf problem, the transition between the long thin limit and the extinction limit in which the bubble vanishes being described by what is in effect a similarity solution of the second kind. This same solution describes the generic (slit-like) extinction behaviour for shear-thickening fluids, the interface profiles that generalize the ellipses that characterize the Newtonian case being constructed by the WienerâHopf calculation\n\nGeorge's cosmic treasure hunt\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nHawking, Lucy; Parsons, Gary\n\n2009-01-01\n\nGeorge and Annie explore the galaxy in this cosmic adventure from Stephen Hawking and Lucy Hawking, complete with essays from Professor Hawking about the latest in space travel.

Defective function of the GP Ib-IX complex is the hallmark of a rare congenital bleeding disorder of still undefined pathogenesis, the Bernard-Soulier syndrome. The authors have analyzed the molecular basis of the disease in one patient in whom immunoblotting of solubilized platelets demonstrated absence of normal GP IbÎ± but presence of a smaller immunoreactive species. The truncated polypeptide was also present, along with normal protein, in platelets from the patient's mother and two of his four children. Genetic characterization identified a nucleotide transition changing the Trp-343 codon (TGG) to a nonsense codon (TGA). Such a mutation explains the origin of the smaller GP IbÎ±, which by lacking half of the sequence on the carboxyl-terminal side, including the transmembrane domain, cannot be properly inserted in the platelet membrane. Both normal and mutant codons were found in the patient, suggesting that he is a compound heterozygote with a still unidentified defect in the other GP IbÎ± allele. Nonsense mutation and truncated GP IbÎ± polypeptide were found to cosegregate in four individuals through three generations and were associated with either Bernard-Soulier syndrome or carrier state phenotype. The molecular abnormality demonstrated in this family provides evidence that defective synthesis of GP IbÎ± alters the membrane expression of the GP Ib-IX complex and may be responsible for Bernard-Soulier syndrome\n\nA Special Class of Univalent Functions in Hele-Shaw Flow Problems\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaula Curt\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We study the time evolution of the free boundary of a viscous fluid for planar flows in Hele-Shaw cells under injection.

The continuous phase was more viscous and wetted the bounding walls of the Hele-Shaw cell. The gap between the Hele-Shaw plates was set equal to 0.0226 cm. Four different flow regimes were observed: (a) small-droplet flow, (b) elongated-droplet flow, (c) churn flow and (d) channel flow. At low capillary number, that is, when capillary forces are larger than viscous forces, the droplet shape was irregular and changed with time and distance, and it moved with lower velocity than that of the conveying phase. At higher capillary number, several different shapes of stabilized elongated and flattened drops were observed.

D.; Maini, B. B.\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThe motion and shape of a liquid drop flowing within a continuous, conveying liquid phase in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell were investigated experimentally. The continuous phase was more viscous and wetted the bounding walls of the Hele-Shaw cell. The gap between the Hele-Shaw plates was set equal to 0.0226 cm. Four different flow regimes were observed: (a) small-droplet flow, (b) elongated-droplet flow, (c) churn flow and (d) channel flow. At low capillary number, that is, when capillary forces are larger than viscous forces, the droplet shape was irregular and changed with time and distance, and it moved with lower velocity than that of the conveying phase. At higher capillary number, several different shapes of stabilized elongated and flattened drops were observed. In contrast to gas-liquid systems, the velocities of droplets are higher than that of conveying liquid. New correlations derived from dimensionless analysis and fitted to the experimental data were generated to predict the elongated-drop velocity and aspect ratio.\n\nPremixed combustion of coconut oil in a hele-shaw cell\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHadi Saroso\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Coconut oil combustion characteristic is observed experimentally by evaporating oil in the boiler then mix it with air before being burned at various equivalence ratios in the Hele-shaw cell. The result shows that, coconut oil tends to break into glycerol and fatty acid due to hydrolysis reaction producing the flame propagation, where the fatty acid flame propagates first then glycerol flame. Micro-explosion occurs when moisture from fatty acid combustion is absorbed by glycerol and higher heating due to higher flame speed produces more micro-explosion.\n\nNon-Newtonian Hele-Shaw Flow and the Saffman-Taylor Instability\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKondic, L.; Shelley, M.J.; Palffy-Muhoray, P.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nWe explore the Saffman-Taylor instability of a gas bubble expanding into a shear thinning liquid in a radial Hele-Shaw cell. Using Darcy close-quote s law generalized for non-Newtonian fluids, we perform simulations of the full dynamical problem. The simulations show that shear thinning significantly influences the developing interfacial patterns. Shear thinning can suppress tip splitting, and produce fingers which oscillate during growth and shed side branches. Emergent length scales show reasonable agreement with a general linear stability analysis. copyright 1998 The American Physical Society\n\nThe anti-romantic reaction in modern(ist literary criticism\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAbdulla Al-Dabbagh\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available While the antagonism of modernism to realism has often been commented upon, its equally vehement rejection of romanticism has not been as widely discussed. Yet, if modernism compromised at times with realism or, at least, with a \"naturalistic\" version of realism, its total antipathy to the fundamentals of romanticism has been absolute. This was a modernist trend that covered both literature and criticism and a modernist characteristic that extended from German philosophers, French poets to British and American professors of literature. Names as diverse as Paul Valery, Charles Maurras and F.R. Leavis shared a common anti-romantic outlook. Many of the important modernist literary trends like the Anglo-American imagism, French surrealism, German expressionism and Italian futurism have been antagonistic not only to ordinary realism as a relic of the 19th century, but also, and fundamentally, to that century's romanticism. In nihilistically breaking with everything from the past, or at least the immediate past, they were by definition anti-romantics. Even writers like Bernard Shaw or Bertolt Brecht and critics like Raymond Williams or George Lukacs, who would generally be regarded as in the pro-realist camp, have, at times, exhibited, to the extent that they were afflicted with the modernist ethos, strong anti-romantic tendencies.\n\nAnalisis Isi Lambung Ikan Senangin (Eleutheronema tetradactylum Shaw di Perairan Dumai\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTitrawani Titrawani\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The research about stomach content analysis of thraedfin fish (Eleutheronema tetradactylum Shaw âsenangin fishâ in Dumai aquatic was taken out on July until Maret 2011.

(2002) proposed to use pyroclastic flows co-bearing with wide spread tephras. The pyroclastic flows prepare volcanic rocks with TRM, which let us determine absolute paleointensity, and the tephras prepare the correlation with sediment stratigraphy. While 4 out of 6 pyroclastic flows are consistent with Sint-800 paleointensity variation curve, two flows, Aso-2 and Aso-4, show weaker and stronger than Sint-800 beyond the error, respectively. We revisited the paleointensity study of Aso pyroclastic flows, adding LTD- DHT Shaw method, the pTRM-tail check in Thellier experiment, and LTD-DHT Shaw method by using volcanic glasses. We prepared 11 specimens from 3 sites of Aso-1 welded tuff for LTD-DHT Shaw method experiments, and obtained 6 paleointensities satisfied a set of strict criteria. They yield an average paleointensity of 21.3Â±5.8uT, which is smaller than 31.0Â±3.4uT provided by Takai et al. (2002). For Aso-2 welded tuff, 11 samples from 3 sites were submitted to Thellier experiments, and 6 passed a set of pretty stringent criteria including pTRM-tail check, which is not performed by Takai et al. (2002). They give an average paleointensity of 20.2Â±1.5uT, which is virtually identical to 20.2Â±1.0uT (27 samples) given by Takai et al. (2002). Although the success rate was not good in LTD-DHT Shaw method, 2 out of 12 specimens passed the criteria, and gave 25.8Â±3.4uT, which is consistent with Takai et al. (2002). In addition, we obtained a reliable paleointensity from a volcanic glass in LTD-DHT Shaw method, it gives a paleointensity of 23.6 uT. It is also consitent with Takai et al. (2002). For Aso-3 welded tuff, we performed only LTD-DHT Shaw method for one specimen from one site yet. It gives a paleointensity of 43.0uT, which is higher than 31.8Â±3.6uT given by Takai et al. (2002). Eight sites were set for Aso-4 welded tuff\n\nIn honour of Georges Charpak\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMore than 40 years ago, Georges Charpak invented the multi-wire proportional chamber, which revolutionized the detection of particles and which found applications in medicine.
