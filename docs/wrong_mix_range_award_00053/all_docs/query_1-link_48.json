        "text": "Chair of Chemistry (1919-48); Dean of Graduate school (1947-52); Dean of the University (1952-58); VP Educational Division (1949-60)\n\nLong-serving chair of chemistry, Gross performed pioneering research on airborne particulates and the production of radioisotopes for research and medical treatments. Co-creator of the Research Training Program which put Duke medical students into research for 9 months of their training. Gross developed a 'frangible bullet' for training aerial gunners in WWII and held two cigarette-related patents. National Science Foundation board member; President of American Association for the Advancement of Science 1962. Gross Hall is named for him.\n\nGrantor of the Indenture that established Duke University and Duke School of Medicine\n\nIndustrialist and philanthropist who established the Duke Endowment, by which Trinity College was renamed Duke University. A codicil in his will, dated Oct. 10, 1925 -- just ten days before death -- gave $10 million to the Duke Endowment for a medical school, teaching hospital and nurses' dormitory on the Durham campus.\n\nFounding Dean of the Medical School\n\nPediatrician and founding dean of the Duke Medical School, which opened in 1930. Chair of Pediatrics until 1954. He led the formation of the 65th General Hospital, a Duke hospital army unit that treated more than 17,000 casualties in England during WWII. His tropical disease research during WWII took him to Panama and Haiti. He visited Japan in 1951 as part of research with the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. Davison was an advocate for the creation of the National Library of Medicine and pre-paid medical care, which led to the establishment of North Carolina's Blue Cross plans, among the first in the nation. The Medical School's Davison Hall is named for him.\n\nFounding dean, school of forestry; founding director, Duke Forest\n\nWorking with visionary Duke president William Preston Few, Korstian helped acquire and organize the 4,700 acres of land that became the nucleus of the Duke Forest to support the new School of Forestry of which he was Dean. \"I thought the Forest should serve the School of Forestry the way the hospital served the Medical School.\" The forest''s Korstian Division between Mt. Sinai Road and Whitfield Road in Orange County is named for him.\n\nJames B. Duke Professor of Surgery\n\nHired for cancer and virus research in 1937, with funding from Lederle Laboratories. Beard and his wife and research partner Dorothy developed a killed-virus vaccine for horse encephalitis, AKA \"blind staggers,\" using ultracentrifuges and chick embroyos. The vaccine saved hundreds of thousands of horses and protected humans, which also helping establish the notion that killed virus is effective and safe as a vaccine. Beard went on to make Duke a leader in virology research, including influenza, using an early electron microscope and the new Bell Building dedicated to research. He also identified links between viruses and human cancers and tested early versions of the flu vaccine using hog pens on a farm near Hillsborough.\n\nJames B. Duke professor of Biochemistry, Chairman of Biochemistry\n\nHired for protein research in 1938, he subsequently made the fundamental discovery that biochemical pathways are different for every part of metabolism. The Handler-Preiss cycle is named for him. Handler led Duke's post-war research into nuclear physics, including radioisotopes, tracers and genetic effects of radiation. He co-founded Duke's physician-scientist training program called the Research Training Program. Awarded the U.S. Medal of Science (1981). Left Duke to be President of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"It is imperative in the University to create interdisciplinary operations, crossing the life sciences with philosophy, religion, government, and sociology, because these greater questions will have to be resolved.\" (1968).\n\nJames B. Duke Professor of Surgery\n\nBrown was a blood banking and transfusion expert, an early open-heart surgeon, and inventor of the heat and blood exchanger, a forerunner of the heart-lung machine that controlled a surgical patient's temperature. He was also the unofficial historian of the 65th General Hospital, a WWII field unit comprised of Duke medicine staff, where Brown helped establish the only blood bank in the European theater. He also designed and built Duke's hyperbaric chamber for studying blood gases and was the first surgeon to implant a cardiac pacemaker at Duke. More on Dr. Brown in the Medical Archives\n\nChairman of Medicine (had been dean at Emory)\n\nA pioneer of venous catheterization, Stead was the founder of nation's first physician assistant program at Duke in 1964. He also founded the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Diseases, a pioneering effort to use computers to study vast collections of medical data and forerunner of Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI).\n\nResearch Professor of Biology, Co-Founder Duke Primate Center (now Lemur Center)\n\nA zoologist who studied maternal bonds and primate hibernation, Klopfer helped establish the link between oxytocin and bonding. He was a co-founder of the Duke Lemur Center (then Duke Primate Center). Duke women's track coach. Jailed for refusing the military draft in the Korean War, he later became the plaintiff in a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court case concerning his right to a speedy trial for protesting Jim Crow segregation in a Chapel Hill restaurant.\n\nChief of Neurology, Director of Center for Human Genomics, Founding Director Bryan Alzheimer's Research Center\n\nChief of neurology for 27 years, he was a co-discoverer of the Apo-E gene's role in Alzheimer's Disease and the TOMM40 gene as a target for Alzheimer's therapies. He left Duke to lead worldwide genetics research at Glaxo Wellcome for ten years, but returned to Duke.\n\nJ. B. Duke Professor, Chair of Physics, Associate Dean for Natural Sciences\n\nMueller was among the first theorists to explore the transition from hadrons to a plasma of free quarks and gluons at temperatures exceeding 2 trillion degrees Kelvin. He is well-known for the prediction that strange quarks would be abundantly produced when such a quark-gluon plasma is formed.\n\nChancellor of Health Affairs, President and CEO of Duke Medicine\n\nChairman of Medicine at Harvard and Stanford before joining Duke, Dzau is a cardiologist who's work on angiotensin-converting-enzyme led to the development of ACE inhibitor therapy for hypertension. He guided the formation of the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, and helped open the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis and the Duke-led longitudinal MURDOCK study there. Left Duke in 2015 to become president of the National Academy of Medicine."
