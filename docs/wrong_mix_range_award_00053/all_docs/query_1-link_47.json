        "text": "The first of the assaults in what came to be called “The Whitechapel Murders” took place on April 3rd, 1888. Emma Elizabeth Smith was attacked by a number of men and was stabbed in her vagina which resulted in her death the next day. It is uncertain if this attack was in any way linked to the supposed serial killing of prostitutes over the ensuing two years. It is quite likely that she was attacked by pimps in a warning to other prostitutes, but it is considered the first in the string of murders linked to Jack the Ripper.\n\nWhat makes the case most interesting is that the supposed murderer was never found. Nature abhors a vacuum and consequently over the years this vacuum has been filled by one theory after another. Explanations have involved a demonic ritual over a two year period to give immortality and that he lives among us still. Very boring detectives point out that many of the modus operandi were different and the killings are unrelated. The Victorian Press had a field day by connecting them and escalating the terror threat in the seedy East End of London.\n\nLetters posted to news agencies and signed “Jack the Ripper” gave credibility to the serial killer theory. The letters may be real, or may be the work of an attention seeking prankster, or of an unscrupulous journalist.\n\nOne theory on the identity of the Ripper is that he was the poet Francis Thompson. A man trained in anatomy though he did not follow his father into medical practice and opted for literature instead. At the time of the murders it was said he was living with a prostitute in London’s East End and he was an opium addict. When his lady friend abandoned him he would roam the streets searching for her, carrying a razor blade for self defense.\n\nThe Whitechapel murders had two enduring consequences. Firstly it exposed multiple flaws in the investigation of crimes and led to the development of what we now call crime scene preservation. The Victorians were concerned with the eternal souls of the victims and the horror of the public. The practice of the day was to remove the body as quickly as possible, contaminating the murder site and destroying potential evidence. The investigations of the murders over a two year period advanced the appreciation of the importance of noting and investigating minor details that were glossed over in early investigations.\n\nThe other consequence was an impetus to clean up the slums of London’s East End. George Bernard Shaw, who campaigned for many years for reform commented sardonically that a madman with a knife was more influential than all the great minds of the day in changing public opinion to the plight of the poor. His letter “Blood money to Whitechapel” is a scathing attack on the right wing press and is as relevant today as it was then. Just glance at how the Telegraph and the Daily Mail treat the plight of refugees in the UK today and you can draw parallels to how they treated the destitute in Victorian London.\n\nAn Arab Love Song: by Francis Thompson\n\nThe hunchèd camels of the night\n\ntrouble the bright\n\nand silver waters of the moon.\n\nThe Maiden of the Morn will soon\n\nthrough Heaven stray and sing,\n\nstar gathering.\n\nNow while the dark about our loves is strewn,\n\nlight of my dark, blood of my heart, O come!\n\nAnd night will catch her breath up, and be dumb.\n\nLeave thy father, leave thy mother\n\nand thy brother;\n\nleave the black tents of thy tribe apart!\n\nAm I not thy father and thy brother,\n\nand thy mother?\n\nAnd thou-what needest with thy tribe’s black tents\n\nwho hast the red pavilion of my heart?\n\n-=o0o=-\n\nThis site is available for free and I make no money from any ads you see here.

The word Holodomor translates as “kill by starving” or “hunger plague”. From 1929 Stalin began a program of collectivizing Ukrainian farms which many believed was a campaign to eradicate Ukrainian nationalism. In Summer 1930 this was followed by a policy of food requisitioning which was imposed at the point of the bayonet. Ostensibly the aim was to achieve a fairer distribution of food across the Soviet Union. Good farmers who resisted the regime were deported to Gulags in Siberia and their expertise was lost.\n\nPoor weather in 1931 led to a poor harvest and this was followed by poor harvests in 1932 and 1933. Some of this was down to the weather. Some was demotivation caused by the collectivization process which removed incentives for hard work. The loss of expertise to the Gulags. Exhaustion of people and animals through rationing played a part. In addition collectivization saw the adoption of poor farming practices, ploughing marginal land and overworking resources in a failed attempt to expand production.\n\nWhen the famine hit hard the Russians continued to remove the requisitioned grain. According to folk memory they did even worse, stripping farms of any portable food, including the food cooking on the stove. As a consequence it is estimated that 5 million Ukrainians died directly from starvation. Displacement, malnutrition and disease accounted for many more.\n\nWhen news leaked out to the West Stalin tried to cover up the reports as fake news by giving prominent celebrities tours of “Potemkin Villages”. George Bernard Shaw was one such visitor who was hoodwinked by his tour. Internally in the USSR discussion of the famine was banned.\n\nToday the world is split on the issue of Holodomor being an overt act of genocide or a catastrophic failure of government. In this regard it is very similar in nature to the the Great Hunger; the Irish Potato Famine. In Ukraine there is no doubt; it was racial genocide. The resilience of Ukrainian forces today despite overwhelming Russian advantages in the air, on the ground and at sea, comes down to a bullheaded national refusal to accept a repeat Holodomor.\n\nMCMXIV ; by Philip Larkin\n\nThose long uneven lines\n\nstanding as patiently\n\nas if they were stretched outside\n\nthe Oval or Villa Park,\n\nthe crowns of hats, the sun\n\non moustached archaic faces\n\ngrinning as if it were all\n\nan August Bank Holiday lark;\n\nand the shut shops, the bleached\n\nestablished names on the sunblinds,\n\nthe farthings and sovereigns,\n\nand dark-clothed children at play\n\ncalled after kings and queens,\n\nthe tin advertisements\n\nfor cocoa and twist, and the pubs\n\nwide open all day;\n\nand the countryside not caring:\n\nthe place-names all hazed over\n\nwith flowering grasses, and fields\n\nshadowing Domesday lines\n\nunder wheat’s restless silence;\n\nthe differently-dressed servants\n\nwith tiny rooms in huge houses,\n\nthe dust behind limousines;\n\nnever such innocence,\n\nnever before or since,\n\nas changed itself to past\n\nwithout a word – the men\n\nleaving the gardens tidy,\n\nthe thousands of marriages,\n\nlasting a little while longer:\n\nnever such innocence again.\n\n-=o0o=-\n\nThis site is available for free and I make no money from any ads you see here.

They break down by category as follows:\n\nLiterature: 4, Peace: 2, Physics: 1, Physiology or Medicine: 1\n\nIt is hardly a surprise that Ireland excels in literature. Irish mythology divides the society of the Tuatha Dé Danann into three tribes, the Tuatha (nobility) the Dé (priests) and the Danann (bards). In medieval Ireland the communal body of lore was protected by the Filí (court poet historians) and the Bards (itinerant poets, story tellers and minstrels). These individuals were highly respected and honoured. There are dreadful cautionary tales told of the fate of lords who failed to honour a bard properly. No sword cuts as deeply as a well crafted satire.\n\nThe claim to fame of my own clan, the MacFhlannchaidh (Clancy) is that we were filí to the Dalcassian Sept. We were the brehons (lawyers), historians, poets, diplomats, ambassadors and scribes. Basically the civil service of the time. The Dalcassians were one of the most powerful tribal groups in Ireland. they successfully rebuffed attempts by the Normans to invade their lands. Two American presidents, J.F.K. and Ronald Reagan trace their heritage back to the Dál gCais.\n\nThe Irish literature winners are W.B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney.\n\nThe last two were born on the same day, April 13th. Happy birthday to half of all Irish Nobel Prize winning literature laureates.\n\nAscension; by Samuel Beckett\n\nthrough the slim partition\n\nthis day when a child\n\nprodigal in his own way\n\nreturned into the family\n\nI hear a voice\n\nit is excited it comments\n\non the football world cup\n\nforever too young\n\nmeanwhile through the open window\n\nover the air in a word\n\nheavily\n\na sea swell of the faithful\n\nher blood spurted in abundance\n\non the sheets on the sweet peas on her bloke\n\nhe closed the eyelids with filthy fingers\n\non the green eyes big with surprise\n\nshe lightly roams\n\nover my tomb of air\n\nRite of Spring; by Seamus Heaney\n\nSo winter closed its fist\n\nand got it stuck in the pump.\n\nThe plunger froze up a lump\n\nin its throat, ice founding itself\n\nupon iron.

I know of only one poem that he wrote and that is satirical. in 1924 and 1925 a writer by the name of Herbert Langford Reed published two anthologies of Limericks.\n\nLangford took a poetic form that was widely employed to tell rude jokes with sexual innuendo and cleaned it up for publication. The result is a lot of sanitized and frankly unremarkable pieces of doggerel. Shaw’s limerick is the perfect critique of the work of Langford Reed.\n\nShaw himself is rightly seen as a giant of the literature world. How many writers get their own adjective? When you describe something in the manner of Bernard Shaw you call it “Shavian”. It may also be employed as a noun to identify a fan of Shaw.\n\nA prolific writer of brilliant, intelligent and witty drama, rightly a Nobel Laureate. Shaw was less successful with his pursuit of the 20th Century novel and turned down opportunities to pen librettos for opera with Elgar. He was a friend of the Irish Literary Revival, a member of the Protestant ascendancy, albeit at the poorer end, he connected with William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Russell, James Joyce and was friend and inspiration to Sean O’Casey who became a playwright after seeing “John Bull’s Other Island” the play that made Edward VII laugh so hard he broke his chair.\n\nWhen John Millington Synge passed away Yeats and Lady Gregory offered the post as director of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin to Shaw, but he declined.\n\nAlthough he never returned to live here he maintained his links with Ireland throughout his life and in his will he bequeathed the rights of several of his plays to the National Art Gallery in Dublin. One of the plays, Pygmalion, was given a musical overhaul by Lerner and Loewe in 1956 and became the smash hit musical “My Fair Lady” making the art gallery wealthy in the process.\n\nContemporary with Oscar Wilde and both leading lights on the London theatre scene at the very height of its prominence. Shaw was the later arrival, Wilde already a celebrated star before Shaw emerged on the scene. It is said that Shaw admired all Wilde’s work until “The Importance of Being Ernest” which he detested.\n\nShaw was a mixed bag. For all you find to love in him you will find plenty to dislike. He was a eugenicist, an anti-vaxxer, he admired aspects of fascism and Hitler, met Stalin and described him as a Georgian Gentleman, was opposed to anti-semetism and his views on religion and spirituality are confusing, conflicting and contradictory. His sexuality is a matter for debate, he was painfully shy and celibate until age 29 and did not marry until age 42 to a woman of his own age.\n\nLangford Reed saved the limerick verse: by George Bernard Shaw\n\nLangford Reed saved the limerick verse,\n\nFrom being taken away in a hearse.\n\nHe made it so clean\n\nNow it’s fit for a queen,\n\nRe-established for better or worse.\n\n-=o0o=-\n\nThis site is available for free and I make no money from any ads you see here.
