Franck, of Gottingen, and Professor G. Hertz, of Halle.\n\nThe Academy has awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for 1926 to Professor Jean Perrin of the Sorbonne.\n\nThe Prize for Chemistry for 1925 has been awarded to Herr Richard Zsigmondy, the Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Gottingen, and the Prize for Chemistry for 1926 has been awarded to Professor Svedberg, of the University of Upsala.\n\nEach Nobel Prize for 1925 amounts to 118,000 Swedish kroner (about Âœ6,500).\n\nMr Shaw 'mystified'\n\nWhen a Press representative called at 10, Adelphi Terrace, London, yesterday afternoon he learned that Mr. Bernard Shaw had received no official intimation of the fact (as reported above by Reuter), that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1925.\n\n\"It is a great mystery to me,\" said Mr. Shaw. \"I suppose,\" he added, with a smile, \"it is given to me because I wrote nothing at all that year!\""
