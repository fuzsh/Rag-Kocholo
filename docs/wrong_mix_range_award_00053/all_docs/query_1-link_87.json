For example, the moon has a rocky surface, not unlike some parts of earth, and is not made of some exotic ethereal substance, as had been generally believed before Galileo. This discovery led to the realization that the motions of the moon and planets obeyed the same physical laws as ordinary things moving on earth. Newton put this all together to give the first unified picture of the universe.... The second revolution was Einstein's realization that this was not the whole truth -- space and time are not as straightforward as they first appear, but are related to each other in a simple but unexpected way. Among other results, this leads to the surprising consequence that mass and energy are different aspects of the same thing!\"\n\nInside Einstein's Universe: Journey to the Edge of Space and Time (from Harvard University).

However, most American physicists doubted that atomic energy or atomic bombs were realistic possibilities. No official U.S. atomic energy project existed. Leo Szilard (here and here) was profoundly disturbed by the lack of American action. If atomic bombs were possible, as he believed they were, Nazi Germany might gain an unbeatable lead in developing them. It was especially troubling that Germany had stopped the sale of uranium ore from occupied Czechoslovakia. Unable to find official support, and unable to convince Enrico Fermi (here, here, and here) of the need to continue experiments, Szilard turned to his old friend Albert Einstein...\" Note: After it was shown to President Roosevelt, this letter led to the creation of the Manhattan Project. Note: In later years, Einstein regretted writing this letter because of the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in August, 1945. However, at the time he and Szilard wrote it, he and others knew there was a good probability that Germany would develop the bomb and use it against the Allies and attempt to become the \"master race.\" Note: Here is a 1946 New York Times photo of Einstein and Szilard in a recreation of writing the letter.\n\nEinstein's Letter to Nikola Tesla Congratulating Him on His 75th Birthday (from the Tesla Memorial Society of New York).

So free are the gyroscopes from disturbance that they will provide an almost perfect space-time reference system. They will measure how space and time are warped by the presence of the Earth, and, more profoundly, how the Earth's rotation drags space-time around with it. These effects, though small for the Earth, have far-reaching implications for the nature of matter and the structure of the Universe. Gravity Probe B is among the most thoroughly researched programs ever undertaken by NASA.
