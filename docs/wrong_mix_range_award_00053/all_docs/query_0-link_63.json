        "text": "Nobel Prize Winning Authors\n\nWhen Dagobert D. Runes founded Philosophical Library seventy-five years ago, his intention was to bring lasting works of thought to a broader readership than they might otherwise receive. Many of his choices were not available in English, so he had them translated; other were also either difficult to find or unavailable to the general public. Going well beyond this original mandate, since its founding, Philosophical Library has proudly published the work of more than twenty recipients of Nobel prizes, primarily those for Literature and Physics, but also including laureates in Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Nearly three dozen of these titles remain in print, including books by Jean-Paul Sartre, who in fact declined the award for literature; Boris Pasternak, another Literature laureate published by Philosophical Library, had initially intended to accept his award, but was later “encouraged” by the Soviets to decline it. The citation for André Gide’s 1947 Nobel, which he did not decline, could not have explicitly mentioned what we now know was a salient aspect of his life and work. But perhaps the reference to his “fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight” alluded to Gide’s own frankness about his homosexuality.\n\nAlbert Einstein’s 1921 award for his work in Theoretical Physics was not for his theory of relativity (it was still too controversial and unproven at the time) but for building on the foundation of Max Planck’s quantum theory, for which Planck received the 1918 award. Of course we know that Einstein’s work continues to inspire physicists today. In fact, the actual proofs of his theories are only now coming to light. And half-a-dozen of Einstein’s books, having to do with his scientific and humanitarian concerns, are stalwarts of Philosophical Library’s list. Max Planck’s Scientific Autobiography and Other Essays was a bestseller when it was first published and continues to be noteworthy, for among other things, the great scientist’s engagement with the the ongoing conversation between science and religion.\n\nInterestingly, both Planck and Einstein received their awards a year later than the official date cited. This most likely had nothing to do with the relativity of time.\n\nNot all of the Nobel committee’s past choices are household names, certainly not on the level of Bob Dylan, the most recent literature laureate/ And not all of their works continue to enthrall the public. But Philosophical Library, always a small, independent, idiosyncratic publishing house, has proven that its choices have more often than not, passed the test of time.\n\nBelow is a list of Nobel laureates published by Philosophical Library.
