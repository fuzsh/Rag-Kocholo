        "text": "ACT I\n\nThe hilly country in the middle of the north edge of Sussex, looking very pleasant on a fine evening at the end of September, is seen through the windows of a room which has been built so as to resemble the after part of an old-fashioned high-pooped ship, with a stern gallery; for the windows are ship built with heavy timbering, and run right across the room as continuously as the stability of the wall allows. A row of lockers under the windows provides an unupholstered windowseat interrupted by twin glass doors, respectively halfway between the stern post and the sides. Another door strains the illusion a little by being apparently in the ship's port side, and yet leading, not to the open sea, but to the entrance hall of the house. Between this door and the stern gallery are bookshelves. There are electric light switches beside the door leading to the hall and the glass doors in the stern gallery. Against the starboard wall is a carpenter's bench. The vice has a board in its jaws; and the floor is littered with shavings, overflowing from a waste-paper basket. A couple of planes and a centrebit are on the bench. In the same wall, between the bench and the windows, is a narrow doorway with a half door, above which a glimpse of the room beyond shows that it is a shelved pantry with bottles and kitchen crockery.\n\nOn the starboard side, but close to the middle, is a plain oak drawing-table with drawing-board, T-square, straightedges, set squares, mathematical instruments, saucers of water color, a tumbler of discolored water, Indian ink, pencils, and brushes on it. The drawing-board is set so that the draughtsman's chair has the window on its left hand. On the floor at the end of the table, on its right, is a ship's fire bucket. On the port side of the room, near the bookshelves, is a sofa with its back to the windows. It is a sturdy mahogany article, oddly upholstered in sailcloth, including the bolster, with a couple of blankets hanging over the back. Between the sofa and the drawing-table is a big wicker chair, with broad arms and a low sloping back, with its back to the light. A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase. It is the only article in the room that suggests (not at all convincingly) a woman's hand in the furnishing. The uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck.\n\nThe garden to which the glass doors lead dips to the south before the landscape rises again to the hills. Emerging from the hollow is the cupola of an observatory. Between the observatory and the house is a flagstaff on a little esplanade, with a hammock on the east side and a long garden seat on the west.\n\nA young lady, gloved and hatted, with a dust coat on, is sitting in the window-seat with her body twisted to enable her to look out at the view. One hand props her chin: the other hangs down with a volume of the Temple Shakespeare in it, and her finger stuck in the page she has been reading.\n\nA clock strikes six.\n\nThe young lady turns and looks at her watch. She rises with an air of one who waits, and is almost at the end of her patience. She is a pretty girl, slender, fair, and intelligent looking, nicely but not expensively dressed, evidently not a smart idler.\n\nWith a sigh of weary resignation she comes to the draughtsman's chair; sits down; and begins to read Shakespeare. Presently the book sinks to her lap; her eyes close; and she dozes into a slumber.\n\nAn elderly womanservant comes in from the hall with three unopened bottles of rum on a tray. She passes through and disappears in the pantry without noticing the young lady. She places the bottles on the shelf and fills her tray with empty bottles. As she returns with these, the young lady lets her book drop, awakening herself, and startling the womanservant so that she all but lets the tray fall.\n\nTHE WOMANSERVANT. God bless us! [The young lady picks up the book and places it on the table]. Sorry to wake you, miss, I'm sure; but you are a stranger to me. What might you be waiting here for now?\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. Waiting for somebody to show some signs of knowing that I have been invited here.\n\nTHE WOMANSERVANT. Oh, you're invited, are you? And has nobody come? Dear! dear!\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. A wild-looking old gentleman came and looked in at the window; and I heard him calling out, \"Nurse, there is a young and attractive female waiting in the poop. Go and see what she wants.\" Are you the nurse?\n\nTHE WOMANSERVANT. Yes, miss: I'm Nurse Guinness. That was old Captain Shotover, Mrs Hushabye's father. I heard him roaring; but I thought it was for something else. I suppose it was Mrs Hushabye that invited you, ducky?\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. I understood her to do so. But really I think I'd better go.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Oh, don't think of such a thing, miss. If Mrs Hushabye has forgotten all about it, it will be a pleasant surprise for her to see you, won't it?\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. It has been a very unpleasant surprise to me to find that nobody expects me.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. You'll get used to it, miss: this house is full of surprises for them that don't know our ways.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [looking in from the hall suddenly: an ancient but still hardy man with an immense white beard, in a reefer jacket with a whistle hanging from his neck]. Nurse, there is a hold-all and a handbag on the front steps for everybody to fall over. Also a tennis racquet. Who the devil left them there?\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. They are mine, I'm afraid.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [advancing to the drawing-table]. Nurse, who is this misguided and unfortunate young lady?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. She says Miss Hessy invited her, sir.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. And had she no friend, no parents, to warn her against my daughter's invitations? This is a pretty sort of house, by heavens! A young and attractive lady is invited here. Her luggage is left on the steps for hours; and she herself is deposited in the poop and abandoned, tired and starving. This is our hospitality. These are our manners. No room ready. No hot water. No welcoming hostess. Our visitor is to sleep in the toolshed, and to wash in the duckpond.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Now it's all right, Captain: I'll get the lady some tea; and her room shall be ready before she has finished it. [To the young lady]. Take off your hat, ducky; and make yourself at home [she goes to the door leading to the hall].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [as she passes him]. Ducky! Do you suppose, woman, that because this young lady has been insulted and neglected, you have the right to address her as you address my wretched children, whom you have brought up in ignorance of the commonest decencies of social intercourse?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Never mind him, doty. [Quite unconcerned, she goes out into the hall on her way to the kitchen].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Madam, will you favor me with your name? [He sits down in the big wicker chair].\n\nTHE YOUNG LADY. My name is Ellie Dunn.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Dunn! I had a boatswain whose name was Dunn. He was originally a pirate in China. He set up as a ship's chandler with stores which I have every reason to believe he stole from me. No doubt he became rich. Are you his daughter?\n\nELLIE [indignant]. No, certainly not. I am proud to be able to say that though my father has not been a successful man, nobody has ever had one word to say against him. I think my father is the best man I have ever known.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. He must be greatly changed. Has he attained the seventh degree of concentration?\n\nELLIE. I don't understand.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. But how could he, with a daughter? I, madam, have two daughters. One of them is Hesione Hushabye, who invited you here. I keep this house: she upsets it. I desire to attain the seventh degree of concentration: she invites visitors and leaves me to entertain them. [Nurse Guinness returns with the tea-tray, which she places on the teak table]. I have a second daughter who is, thank God, in a remote part of the Empire with her numskull of a husband. As a child she thought the figure-head of my ship, the Dauntless, the most beautiful thing on earth. He resembled it. He had the same expression: wooden yet enterprising. She married him, and will never set foot in this house again.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS [carrying the table, with the tea-things on it, to Ellie's side]. Indeed you never were more mistaken. She is in England this very moment. You have been told three times this week that she is coming home for a year for her health. And very glad you should be to see your own daughter again after all these years.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. I am not glad. The natural term of the affection of the human animal for its offspring is six years. My daughter Ariadne was born when I was forty-six. I am now eighty-eight. If she comes, I am not at home. If she wants anything, let her take it. If she asks for me, let her be informed that I am extremely old, and have totally forgotten her.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. That's no talk to offer to a young lady. Here, ducky, have some tea; and don't listen to him [she pours out a cup of tea].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [rising wrathfully]. Now before high heaven they have given this innocent child Indian tea: the stuff they tan their own leather insides with. [He seizes the cup and the tea-pot and empties both into the leathern bucket].\n\nELLIE [almost in tears]. Oh, please! I am so tired. I should have been glad of anything.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Oh, what a thing to do! The poor lamb is ready to drop.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. You shall have some of my tea. Do not touch that fly-blown cake: nobody eats it here except the dogs. [He disappears into the pantry].\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. There's a man for you! They say he sold himself to the devil in Zanzibar before he was a captain; and the older he grows the more I believe them.\n\nA WOMAN'S VOICE [in the hall]. Is anyone at home? Hesione! Nurse! Papa! Do come, somebody; and take in my luggage.\n\nThumping heard, as of an umbrella, on the wainscot.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. My gracious! It's Miss Addy, Lady Utterword, Mrs Hushabye's sister: the one I told the captain about. [Calling]. Coming, Miss, coming.\n\nShe carries the table back to its place by the door and is harrying out when she is intercepted by Lady Utterword, who bursts in much flustered. Lady Utterword, a blonde, is very handsome, very well dressed, and so precipitate in speech and action that the first impression (erroneous) is one of comic silliness.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Oh, is that you, Nurse? How are you? You don't look a day older. Is nobody at home? Where is Hesione? Doesn't she expect me? Where are the servants? Whose luggage is that on the steps? Where's papa? Is everybody asleep? [Seeing Ellie]. Oh! I beg your pardon. I suppose you are one of my nieces. [Approaching her with outstretched arms]. Come and kiss your aunt, darling.\n\nELLIE. I'm only a visitor. It is my luggage on the steps.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. I'll go get you some fresh tea, ducky. [She takes up the tray].\n\nELLIE. But the old gentleman said he would make some himself.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Bless you! he's forgotten what he went for already. His mind wanders from one thing to another.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Papa, I suppose?\n\nNURSE GUINNESS. Yes, Miss.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [vehemently]. Don't be silly, Nurse. Don't call me Miss.\n\nNURSE GUINNESS [placidly]. No, lovey [she goes out with the tea-tray].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [sitting down with a flounce on the sofa]. I know what you must feel. Oh, this house, this house! I come back to it after twenty-three years; and it is just the same: the luggage lying on the steps, the servants spoilt and impossible, nobody at home to receive anybody, no regular meals, nobody ever hungry because they are always gnawing bread and butter or munching apples, and, what is worse, the same disorder in ideas, in talk, in feeling. When I was a child I was used to it: I had never known anything better, though I was unhappy, and longed all the time—oh, how I longed!—to be respectable, to be a lady, to live as others did, not to have to think of everything for myself. I married at nineteen to escape from it. My husband is Sir Hastings Utterword, who has been governor of all the crown colonies in succession. I have always been the mistress of Government House. I have been so happy: I had forgotten that people could live like this. I wanted to see my father, my sister, my nephews and nieces (one ought to, you know), and I was looking forward to it. And now the state of the house! the way I'm received! the casual impudence of that woman Guinness, our old nurse! really Hesione might at least have been here: some preparation might have been made for me. You must excuse my going on in this way; but I am really very much hurt and annoyed and disillusioned: and if I had realized it was to be like this, I wouldn't have come. I have a great mind to go away without another word [she is on the point of weeping].\n\nELLIE [also very miserable]. Nobody has been here to receive me either. I thought I ought to go away too. But how can I, Lady Utterword? My luggage is on the steps; and the station fly has gone.\n\nThe captain emerges from the pantry with a tray of Chinese lacquer and a very fine tea-set on it. He rests it provisionally on the end of the table; snatches away the drawing-board, which he stands on the floor against table legs; and puts the tray in the space thus cleared. Ellie pours out a cup greedily.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Your tea, young lady. What! another lady! I must fetch another cup [he makes for the pantry].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [rising from the sofa, suffused with emotion]. Papa! Don't you know me? I'm your daughter.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Nonsense! my daughter's upstairs asleep. [He vanishes through the half door].\n\nLady Utterword retires to the window to conceal her tears.\n\nELLIE [going to her with the cup]. Don't be so distressed. Have this cup of tea. He is very old and very strange: he has been just like that to me. I know how dreadful it must be: my own father is all the world to me. Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean it.\n\nThe captain returns with another cup.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Now we are complete. [He places it on the tray].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [hysterically]. Papa, you can't have forgotten me. I am Ariadne. I'm little Paddy Patkins. Won't you kiss me? [She goes to him and throws her arms round his neck].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [woodenly enduring her embrace]. How can you be Ariadne? You are a middle-aged woman: well preserved, madam, but no longer young.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. But think of all the years and years I have been away, Papa. I have had to grow old, like other people.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [disengaging himself]. You should grow out of kissing strange men: they may be striving to attain the seventh degree of concentration.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. But I'm your daughter. You haven't seen me for years.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. So much the worse! When our relatives are at home, we have to think of all their good points or it would be impossible to endure them. But when they are away, we console ourselves for their absence by dwelling on their vices. That is how I have come to think my absent daughter Ariadne a perfect fiend; so do not try to ingratiate yourself here by impersonating her [he walks firmly away to the other side of the room].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Ingratiating myself indeed! [With dignity]. Very well, papa. [She sits down at the drawing-table and pours out tea for herself].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. I am neglecting my social duties. You remember Dunn? Billy Dunn?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. DO you mean that villainous sailor who robbed you?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [introducing Ellie]. His daughter. [He sits down on the sofa].\n\nELLIE [protesting]. No—\n\nNurse Guinness returns with fresh tea.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. Take that hogwash away. Do you hear?\n\nNURSE. You've actually remembered about the tea! [To Ellie]. Oh, miss, he didn't forget you after all! You HAVE made an impression.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [gloomily]. Youth! beauty! novelty! They are badly wanted in this house. I am excessively old. Hesione is only moderately young. Her children are not youthful.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. How can children be expected to be youthful in this house? Almost before we could speak we were filled with notions that might have been all very well for pagan philosophers of fifty, but were certainly quite unfit for respectable people of any age.\n\nNURSE. You were always for respectability, Miss Addy.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Nurse, will you please remember that I am Lady Utterword, and not Miss Addy, nor lovey, nor darling, nor doty? Do you hear?\n\nNURSE. Yes, ducky: all right. I'll tell them all they must call you My Lady. [She takes her tray out with undisturbed placidity].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. What comfort? what sense is there in having servants with no manners?\n\nELLIE [rising and coming to the table to put down her empty cup]. Lady Utterword, do you think Mrs Hushabye really expects me?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Oh, don't ask me. You can see for yourself that I've just arrived; her only sister, after twenty-three years' absence! and it seems that I am not expected.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. What does it matter whether the young lady is expected or not? She is welcome. There are beds: there is food. I'll find a room for her myself [he makes for the door].\n\nELLIE [following him to stop him]. Oh, please—[He goes out]. Lady Utterword, I don't know what to do. Your father persists in believing that my father is some sailor who robbed him.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. You had better pretend not to notice it. My father is a very clever man; but he always forgot things; and now that he is old, of course he is worse. And I must warn you that it is sometimes very hard to feel quite sure that he really forgets.\n\nMrs Hushabye bursts into the room tempestuously and embraces Ellie. She is a couple of years older than Lady Utterword, and even better looking. She has magnificent black hair, eyes like the fishpools of Heshbon, and a nobly modelled neck, short at the back and low between her shoulders in front. Unlike her sister she is uncorseted and dressed anyhow in a rich robe of black pile that shows off her white skin and statuesque contour.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Ellie, my darling, my pettikins [kissing her], how long have you been here? I've been at home all the time: I was putting flowers and things in your room; and when I just sat down for a moment to try how comfortable the armchair was I went off to sleep. Papa woke me and told me you were here. Fancy your finding no one, and being neglected and abandoned. [Kissing her again]. My poor love! [She deposits Ellie on the sofa. Meanwhile Ariadne has left the table and come over to claim her share of attention]. Oh! you've brought someone with you. Introduce me.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Hesione, is it possible that you don't know me?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [conventionally]. Of course I remember your face quite well. Where have we met?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Didn't Papa tell you I was here? Oh! this is really too much. [She throws herself sulkily into the big chair].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Papa!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Yes, Papa. Our papa, you unfeeling wretch! [Rising angrily]. I'll go straight to a hotel.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [seizing her by the shoulders]. My goodness gracious goodness, you don't mean to say that you're Addy!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. I certainly am Addy; and I don't think I can be so changed that you would not have recognized me if you had any real affection for me. And Papa didn't think me even worth mentioning!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What a lark! Sit down [she pushes her back into the chair instead of kissing her, and posts herself behind it]. You DO look a swell. You're much handsomer than you used to be. You've made the acquaintance of Ellie, of course. She is going to marry a perfect hog of a millionaire for the sake of her father, who is as poor as a church mouse; and you must help me to stop her.\n\nELLIE. Oh, please, Hesione!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. My pettikins, the man's coming here today with your father to begin persecuting you; and everybody will see the state of the case in ten minutes; so what's the use of making a secret of it?\n\nELLIE. He is not a hog, Hesione. You don't know how wonderfully good he was to my father, and how deeply grateful I am to him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [to Lady Utterword]. Her father is a very remarkable man, Addy. His name is Mazzini Dunn. Mazzini was a celebrity of some kind who knew Ellie's grandparents. They were both poets, like the Brownings; and when her father came into the world Mazzini said, \"Another soldier born for freedom!\" So they christened him Mazzini; and he has been fighting for freedom in his quiet way ever since. That's why he is so poor.\n\nELLIE. I am proud of his poverty.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Of course you are, pettikins. Why not leave him in it, and marry someone you love?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [rising suddenly and explosively]. Hesione, are you going to kiss me or are you not?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What do you want to be kissed for?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. I DON'T want to be kissed; but I do want you to behave properly and decently. We are sisters. We have been separated for twenty-three years. You OUGHT to kiss me.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. To-morrow morning, dear, before you make up. I hate the smell of powder.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Oh! you unfeeling—[she is interrupted by the return of the captain].\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [to Ellie]. Your room is ready. [Ellie rises]. The sheets were damp; but I have changed them [he makes for the garden door on the port side].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Oh! What about my sheets?\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [halting at the door]. Take my advice: air them: or take them off and sleep in blankets. You shall sleep in Ariadne's old room.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Indeed I shall do nothing of the sort. That little hole! I am entitled to the best spare room.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN [continuing unmoved]. She married a numskull. She told me she would marry anyone to get away from home.\n\nLADT UTTERWORD. You are pretending not to know me on purpose. I will leave the house.\n\nMazzini Dunn enters from the hall. He is a little elderly man with bulging credulous eyes and earnest manners. He is dressed in a blue serge jacket suit with an unbuttoned mackintosh over it, and carries a soft black hat of clerical cut.\n\nELLIE. At last! Captain Shotover, here is my father.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN. This! Nonsense! not a bit like him [he goes away through the garden, shutting the door sharply behind him].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. I will not be ignored and pretended to be somebody else. I will have it out with Papa now, this instant. [To Mazzini]. Excuse me. [She follows the captain out, making a hasty bow to Mazzini, who returns it].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [hospitably shaking hands]. How good of you to come, Mr Dunn! You don't mind Papa, do you? He is as mad as a hatter, you know, but quite harmless and extremely clever. You will have some delightful talks with him.\n\nMAZZINI. I hope so. [To Ellie]. So here you are, Ellie, dear. [He draws her arm affectionately through his]. I must thank you, Mrs Hushabye, for your kindness to my daughter. I'm afraid she would have had no holiday if you had not invited her.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Not at all. Very nice of her to come and attract young people to the house for us.\n\nMAZZINI [smiling]. I'm afraid Ellie is not interested in young men, Mrs Hushabye. Her taste is on the graver, solider side.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [with a sudden rather hard brightness in her manner]. Won't you take off your overcoat, Mr Dunn? You will find a cupboard for coats and hats and things in the corner of the hall.\n\nMAZZINI [hastily releasing Ellie]. Yes—thank you—I had better— [he goes out].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [emphatically]. The old brute!\n\nELLIE. Who?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Who! Him. He. It [pointing after Mazzini]. \"Graver, solider tastes,\" indeed!\n\nELLIE [aghast]. You don't mean that you were speaking like that of my father!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I was. You know I was.\n\nELLIE [with dignity]. I will leave your house at once. [She turns to the door].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. If you attempt it, I'll tell your father why.\n\nELLIE [turning again]. Oh! How can you treat a visitor like this, Mrs Hushabye?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I thought you were going to call me Hesione.\n\nELLIE. Certainly not now?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Very well: I'll tell your father.\n\nELLIE [distressed]. Oh!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. If you turn a hair—if you take his part against me and against your own heart for a moment, I'll give that born soldier of freedom a piece of my mind that will stand him on his selfish old head for a week.\n\nELLIE. Hesione! My father selfish! How little you know—\n\nShe is interrupted by Mazzini, who returns, excited and perspiring.\n\nMAZZINI. Ellie, Mangan has come: I thought you'd like to know. Excuse me, Mrs Hushabye, the strange old gentleman—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Papa. Quite so.\n\nMAZZINI. Oh, I beg your pardon, of course: I was a little confused by his manner. He is making Mangan help him with something in the garden; and he wants me too—\n\nA powerful whistle is heard.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN'S VOICE. Bosun ahoy! [the whistle is repeated].\n\nMAZZINI [flustered]. Oh dear! I believe he is whistling for me. [He hurries out].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Now MY father is a wonderful man if you like.\n\nELLIE. Hesione, listen to me. You don't understand. My father and Mr Mangan were boys together. Mr Ma—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I don't care what they were: we must sit down if you are going to begin as far back as that. [She snatches at Ellie's waist, and makes her sit down on the sofa beside her]. Now, pettikins, tell me all about Mr Mangan. They call him Boss Mangan, don't they? He is a Napoleon of industry and disgustingly rich, isn't he? Why isn't your father rich?\n\nELLIE. My poor father should never have been in business. His parents were poets; and they gave him the noblest ideas; but they could not afford to give him a profession.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Fancy your grandparents, with their eyes in fine frenzy rolling! And so your poor father had to go into business. Hasn't he succeeded in it?\n\nELLIE. He always used to say he could succeed if he only had some capital. He fought his way along, to keep a roof over our heads and bring us up well; but it was always a struggle: always the same difficulty of not having capital enough. I don't know how to describe it to you.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Poor Ellie! I know. Pulling the devil by the tail.\n\nELLIE [hurt]. Oh, no. Not like that. It was at least dignified.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. That made it all the harder, didn't it? I shouldn't have pulled the devil by the tail with dignity. I should have pulled hard—[between her teeth] hard. Well? Go on.\n\nELLIE. At last it seemed that all our troubles were at an end. Mr Mangan did an extraordinarily noble thing out of pure friendship for my father and respect for his character. He asked him how much capital he wanted, and gave it to him. I don't mean that he lent it to him, or that he invested it in his business. He just simply made him a present of it. Wasn't that splendid of him?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. On condition that you married him?\n\nELLIE. Oh, no, no, no! This was when I was a child. He had never even seen me: he never came to our house. It was absolutely disinterested. Pure generosity.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Oh! I beg the gentleman's pardon. Well, what became of the money?\n\nELLIE. We all got new clothes and moved into another house. And I went to another school for two years.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Only two years?\n\nELLIE. That was all: for at the end of two years my father was utterly ruined.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. How?\n\nELLIE. I don't know. I never could understand. But it was dreadful. When we were poor my father had never been in debt. But when he launched out into business on a large scale, he had to incur liabilities. When the business went into liquidation he owed more money than Mr Mangan had given him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Bit off more than he could chew, I suppose.\n\nELLIE. I think you are a little unfeeling about it.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. My pettikins, you mustn't mind my way of talking. I was quite as sensitive and particular as you once; but I have picked up so much slang from the children that I am really hardly presentable. I suppose your father had no head for business, and made a mess of it.\n\nELLIE. Oh, that just shows how entirely you are mistaken about him. The business turned out a great success. It now pays forty-four per cent after deducting the excess profits tax.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Then why aren't you rolling in money?\n\nELLIE. I don't know. It seems very unfair to me. You see, my father was made bankrupt. It nearly broke his heart, because he had persuaded several of his friends to put money into the business. He was sure it would succeed; and events proved that he was quite right. But they all lost their money. It was dreadful. I don't know what we should have done but for Mr Mangan.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What! Did the Boss come to the rescue again, after all his money being thrown away?\n\nELLIE. He did indeed, and never uttered a reproach to my father. He bought what was left of the business—the buildings and the machinery and things—from the official trustee for enough money to enable my father to pay six-and-eight-pence in the pound and get his discharge. Everyone pitied Papa so much, and saw so plainly that he was an honorable man, that they let him off at six-and-eight-pence instead of ten shillings. Then Mr. Mangan started a company to take up the business, and made my father a manager in it to save us from starvation; for I wasn't earning anything then.\n\nMRS. HUSHABYE. Quite a romance. And when did the Boss develop the tender passion?\n\nELLIE. Oh, that was years after, quite lately. He took the chair one night at a sort of people's concert. I was singing there. As an amateur, you know: half a guinea for expenses and three songs with three encores. He was so pleased with my singing that he asked might he walk home with me. I never saw anyone so taken aback as he was when I took him home and introduced him to my father, his own manager. It was then that my father told me how nobly he had behaved. Of course it was considered a great chance for me, as he is so rich. And—and—we drifted into a sort of understanding—I suppose I should call it an engagement—[she is distressed and cannot go on].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [rising and marching about]. You may have drifted into it; but you will bounce out of it, my pettikins, if I am to have anything to do with it.\n\nELLIE [hopelessly]. No: it's no use. I am bound in honor and gratitude. I will go through with it.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [behind the sofa, scolding down at her]. You know, of course, that it's not honorable or grateful to marry a man you don't love. Do you love this Mangan man?\n\nELLIE. Yes. At least—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I don't want to know about \"at least\": I want to know the worst. Girls of your age fall in love with all sorts of impossible people, especially old people.\n\nELLIE. I like Mr Mangan very much; and I shall always be—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [impatiently completing the sentence and prancing away intolerantly to starboard]. —grateful to him for his kindness to dear father. I know. Anybody else?\n\nELLIE. What do you mean?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Anybody else? Are you in love with anybody else?\n\nELLIE. Of course not.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Humph! [The book on the drawing-table catches her eye. She picks it up, and evidently finds the title very unexpected. She looks at Ellie, and asks, quaintly] Quite sure you're not in love with an actor?\n\nELLIE. No, no. Why? What put such a thing into your head?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. This is yours, isn't it? Why else should you be reading Othello?\n\nELLIE. My father taught me to love Shakespeare.\n\nMRS HUSHAYE [flinging the book down on the table]. Really! your father does seem to be about the limit.\n\nELLIE [naively]. Do you never read Shakespeare, Hesione? That seems to me so extraordinary. I like Othello.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Do you, indeed? He was jealous, wasn't he?\n\nELLIE. Oh, not that. I think all the part about jealousy is horrible. But don't you think it must have been a wonderful experience for Desdemona, brought up so quietly at home, to meet a man who had been out in the world doing all sorts of brave things and having terrible adventures, and yet finding something in her that made him love to sit and talk with her and tell her about them?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. That's your idea of romance, is it?\n\nELLIE. Not romance, exactly. It might really happen.\n\nEllie's eyes show that she is not arguing, but in a daydream. Mrs Hushabye, watching her inquisitively, goes deliberately back to the sofa and resumes her seat beside her.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Ellie darling, have you noticed that some of those stories that Othello told Desdemona couldn't have happened—?\n\nELLIE. Oh, no. Shakespeare thought they could have happened.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Hm! Desdemona thought they could have happened. But they didn't.\n\nELLIE. Why do you look so enigmatic about it? You are such a sphinx: I never know what you mean.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Desdemona would have found him out if she had lived, you know. I wonder was that why he strangled her!\n\nELLIE. Othello was not telling lies.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. How do you know?\n\nELLIE. Shakespeare would have said if he was. Hesione, there are men who have done wonderful things: men like Othello, only, of course, white, and very handsome, and—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Ah! Now we're coming to it. Tell me all about him. I knew there must be somebody, or you'd never have been so miserable about Mangan: you'd have thought it quite a lark to marry him.\n\nELLIE [blushing vividly]. Hesione, you are dreadful. But I don't want to make a secret of it, though of course I don't tell everybody. Besides, I don't know him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Don't know him! What does that mean?\n\nELLIE. Well, of course I know him to speak to.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. But you want to know him ever so much more intimately, eh?\n\nELLIE. No, no: I know him quite—almost intimately.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You don't know him; and you know him almost intimately. How lucid!\n\nELLIE. I mean that he does not call on us. I—I got into conversation with him by chance at a concert.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You seem to have rather a gay time at your concerts, Ellie.\n\nELLIE. Not at all: we talk to everyone in the greenroom waiting for our turns. I thought he was one of the artists: he looked so splendid. But he was only one of the committee. I happened to tell him that I was copying a picture at the National Gallery. I make a little money that way. I can't paint much; but as it's always the same picture I can do it pretty quickly and get two or three pounds for it. It happened that he came to the National Gallery one day.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. One students' day. Paid sixpence to stumble about through a crowd of easels, when he might have come in next day for nothing and found the floor clear! Quite by accident?\n\nELLIE [triumphantly]. No. On purpose. He liked talking to me. He knows lots of the most splendid people. Fashionable women who are all in love with him. But he ran away from them to see me at the National Gallery and persuade me to come with him for a drive round Richmond Park in a taxi.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. My pettikins, you have been going it. It's wonderful what you good girls can do without anyone saying a word.\n\nELLIE. I am not in society, Hesione. If I didn't make acquaintances in that way I shouldn't have any at all.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Well, no harm if you know how to take care of yourself. May I ask his name?\n\nELLIE [slowly and musically]. Marcus Darnley.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [echoing the music]. Marcus Darnley! What a splendid name!\n\nELLIE. Oh, I'm so glad you think so. I think so too; but I was afraid it was only a silly fancy of my own.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Hm! Is he one of the Aberdeen Darnleys?\n\nELLIE. Nobody knows. Just fancy! He was found in an antique chest—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. A what?\n\nELLIE. An antique chest, one summer morning in a rose garden, after a night of the most terrible thunderstorm.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What on earth was he doing in the chest? Did he get into it because he was afraid of the lightning?\n\nELLIE. Oh, no, no: he was a baby. The name Marcus Darnley was embroidered on his baby clothes. And five hundred pounds in gold.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [Looking hard at her]. Ellie!\n\nELLIE. The garden of the Viscount—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. —de Rougemont?\n\nELLIE [innocently]. No: de Larochejaquelin. A French family. A vicomte. His life has been one long romance. A tiger—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Slain by his own hand?\n\nELLIE. Oh, no: nothing vulgar like that. He saved the life of the tiger from a hunting party: one of King Edward's hunting parties in India. The King was furious: that was why he never had his military services properly recognized. But he doesn't care. He is a Socialist and despises rank, and has been in three revolutions fighting on the barricades.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. How can you sit there telling me such lies? You, Ellie, of all people! And I thought you were a perfectly simple, straightforward, good girl.\n\nELLIE [rising, dignified but very angry]. Do you mean you don't believe me?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Of course I don't believe you. You're inventing every word of it. Do you take me for a fool?\n\nEllie stares at her. Her candor is so obvious that Mrs Hushabye is puzzled.\n\nELLIE. Goodbye, Hesione. I'm very sorry. I see now that it sounds very improbable as I tell it. But I can't stay if you think that way about me.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [catching her dress]. You shan't go. I couldn't be so mistaken: I know too well what liars are like. Somebody has really told you all this.\n\nELLIE [flushing]. Hesione, don't say that you don't believe him. I couldn't bear that.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [soothing her]. Of course I believe him, dearest. But you should have broken it to me by degrees. [Drawing her back to her seat]. Now tell me all about him. Are you in love with him?\n\nELLIE. Oh, no. I'm not so foolish. I don't fall in love with people. I'm not so silly as you think.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I see. Only something to think about—to give some interest and pleasure to life.\n\nELLIE. Just so. That's all, really.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. It makes the hours go fast, doesn't it? No tedious waiting to go to sleep at nights and wondering whether you will have a bad night. How delightful it makes waking up in the morning! How much better than the happiest dream! All life transfigured! No more wishing one had an interesting book to read, because life is so much happier than any book! No desire but to be alone and not to have to talk to anyone: to be alone and just think about it.\n\nELLIE [embracing her]. Hesione, you are a witch. How do you know? Oh, you are the most sympathetic woman in the world!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [caressing her]. Pettikins, my pettikins, how I envy you! and how I pity you!\n\nELLIE. Pity me! Oh, why?\n\nA very handsome man of fifty, with mousquetaire moustaches, wearing a rather dandified curly brimmed hat, and carrying an elaborate walking-stick, comes into the room from the hall, and stops short at sight of the women on the sofa.\n\nELLIE [seeing him and rising in glad surprise]. Oh! Hesione: this is Mr Marcus Darnley.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [rising]. What a lark! He is my husband.\n\nELLIE. But now—[she stops suddenly: then turns pale and sways].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [catching her and sitting down with her on the sofa]. Steady, my pettikins.\n\nTHE MAN [with a mixture of confusion and effrontery, depositing his hat and stick on the teak table]. My real name, Miss Dunn, is Hector Hushabye. I leave you to judge whether that is a name any sensitive man would care to confess to. I never use it when I can possibly help it. I have been away for nearly a month; and I had no idea you knew my wife, or that you were coming here. I am none the less delighted to find you in our little house.\n\nELLIE [in great distress]. I don't know what to do. Please, may I speak to papa? Do leave me. I can't bear it.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Be off, Hector.\n\nHECTOR. I—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Quick, quick. Get out.\n\nHECTOR. If you think it better—[he goes out, taking his hat with him but leaving the stick on the table].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [laying Ellie down at the end of the sofa]. Now, pettikins, he is gone. There's nobody but me. You can let yourself go. Don't try to control yourself. Have a good cry.\n\nELLIE [raising her head]. Damn!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Splendid! Oh, what a relief! I thought you were going to be broken-hearted. Never mind me. Damn him again.\n\nELLIE. I am not damning him. I am damning myself for being such a fool. [Rising]. How could I let myself be taken in so? [She begins prowling to and fro, her bloom gone, looking curiously older and harder].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [cheerfully]. Why not, pettikins? Very few young women can resist Hector. I couldn't when I was your age. He is really rather splendid, you know.\n\nELLIE [turning on her]. Splendid! Yes, splendid looking, of course. But how can you love a liar?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I don't know. But you can, fortunately. Otherwise there wouldn't be much love in the world.\n\nELLIE. But to lie like that! To be a boaster! a coward!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [rising in alarm]. Pettikins, none of that, if you please. If you hint the slightest doubt of Hector's courage, he will go straight off and do the most horribly dangerous things to convince himself that he isn't a coward. He has a dreadful trick of getting out of one third-floor window and coming in at another, just to test his nerve. He has a whole drawerful of Albert Medals for saving people's lives.\n\nELLIE. He never told me that.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. He never boasts of anything he really did: he can't bear it; and it makes him shy if anyone else does. All his stories are made-up stories.\n\nELLIE [coming to her]. Do you mean that he is really brave, and really has adventures, and yet tells lies about things that he never did and that never happened?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Yes, pettikins, I do. People don't have their virtues and vices in sets: they have them anyhow: all mixed.\n\nELLIE [staring at her thoughtfully]. There's something odd about this house, Hesione, and even about you. I don't know why I'm talking to you so calmly. I have a horrible fear that my heart is broken, but that heartbreak is not like what I thought it must be.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [fondling her]. It's only life educating you, pettikins. How do you feel about Boss Mangan now?\n\nELLIE [disengaging herself with an expression of distaste]. Oh, how can you remind me of him, Hesione?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Sorry, dear. I think I hear Hector coming back. You don't mind now, do you, dear?\n\nELLIE. Not in the least. I am quite cured.\n\nMazzini Dunn and Hector come in from the hall.\n\nHECTOR [as he opens the door and allows Mazzini to pass in]. One second more, and she would have been a dead woman!\n\nMAZZINI. Dear! dear! what an escape! Ellie, my love, Mr Hushabye has just been telling me the most extraordinary—\n\nELLIE. Yes, I've heard it [she crosses to the other side of the room].\n\nHECTOR [following her]. Not this one: I'll tell it to you after dinner. I think you'll like it. The truth is I made it up for you, and was looking forward to the pleasure of telling it to you. But in a moment of impatience at being turned out of the room, I threw it away on your father.\n\nELLIE [turning at bay with her back to the carpenter's bench, scornfully self-possessed]. It was not thrown away. He believes it. I should not have believed it.\n\nMAZZINI [benevolently]. Ellie is very naughty, Mr Hushabye. Of course she does not really think that. [He goes to the bookshelves, and inspects the titles of the volumes].\n\nBoss Mangan comes in from the hall, followed by the captain. Mangan, carefully frock-coated as for church or for a diHECTORs' meeting, is about fifty-five, with a careworn, mistrustful expression, standing a little on an entirely imaginary dignity, with a dull complexion, straight, lustreless hair, and features so entirely commonplace that it is impossible to describe them.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [to Mrs Hushabye, introducing the newcomer]. Says his name is Mangan. Not able-bodied.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [graciously]. How do you do, Mr Mangan?\n\nMANGAN [shaking hands]. Very pleased.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Dunn's lost his muscle, but recovered his nerve. Men seldom do after three attacks of delirium tremens [he goes into the pantry].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I congratulate you, Mr Dunn.\n\nMAZZINI [dazed]. I am a lifelong teetotaler.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You will find it far less trouble to let papa have his own way than try to explain.\n\nMAZZINI. But three attacks of delirium tremens, really!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [to Mangan]. Do you know my husband, Mr Mangan [she indicates Hector].\n\nMANGAN [going to Hector, who meets him with outstretched hand]. Very pleased. [Turning to Ellie]. I hope, Miss Ellie, you have not found the journey down too fatiguing. [They shake hands].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Hector, show Mr Dunn his room.\n\nHECTOR. Certainly. Come along, Mr Dunn. [He takes Mazzini out].\n\nELLIE. You haven't shown me my room yet, Hesione.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. How stupid of me! Come along. Make yourself quite at home, Mr Mangan. Papa will entertain you. [She calls to the captain in the pantry]. Papa, come and explain the house to Mr Mangan.\n\nShe goes out with Ellie. The captain comes from the pantry.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You're going to marry Dunn's daughter. Don't. You're too old.\n\nMANGAN [staggered]. Well! That's fairly blunt, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. It's true.\n\nMANGAN. She doesn't think so.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. She does.\n\nMANGAN. Older men than I have—\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [finishing the sentence for him].—made fools of themselves. That, also, is true.\n\nMANGAN [asserting himself]. I don't see that this is any business of yours.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. It is everybody's business. The stars in their courses are shaken when such things happen.\n\nMANGAN. I'm going to marry her all the same.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. How do you know?\n\nMANGAN [playing the strong man]. I intend to. I mean to. See? I never made up my mind to do a thing yet that I didn't bring it off. That's the sort of man I am; and there will be a better understanding between us when you make up your mind to that, Captain.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You frequent picture palaces.\n\nMANGAN. Perhaps I do. Who told you?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Talk like a man, not like a movie. You mean that you make a hundred thousand a year.\n\nMANGAN. I don't boast. But when I meet a man that makes a hundred thousand a year, I take off my hat to that man, and stretch out my hand to him and call him brother.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Then you also make a hundred thousand a year, hey?\n\nMANGAN. No. I can't say that. Fifty thousand, perhaps.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. His half brother only [he turns away from Mangan with his usual abruptness, and collects the empty tea-cups on the Chinese tray].\n\nMANGAN [irritated]. See here, Captain Shotover. I don't quite understand my position here. I came here on your daughter's invitation. Am I in her house or in yours?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You are beneath the dome of heaven, in the house of God. What is true within these walls is true outside them. Go out on the seas; climb the mountains; wander through the valleys. She is still too young.\n\nMANGAN [weakening]. But I'm very little over fifty.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You are still less under sixty. Boss Mangan, you will not marry the pirate's child [he carries the tray away into the pantry].\n\nMANGAN [following him to the half door]. What pirate's child? What are you talking about?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [in the pantry]. Ellie Dunn. You will not marry her.\n\nMANGAN. Who will stop me?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [emerging]. My daughter [he makes for the door leading to the hall].\n\nMANGAN [following him]. Mrs Hushabye! Do you mean to say she brought me down here to break it off?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [stopping and turning on him]. I know nothing more than I have seen in her eye. She will break it off. Take my advice: marry a West Indian negress: they make excellent wives. I was married to one myself for two years.\n\nMANGAN. Well, I am damned!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. I thought so. I was, too, for many years. The negress redeemed me.\n\nMANGAN [feebly]. This is queer. I ought to walk out of this house.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Why?\n\nMANGAN. Well, many men would be offended by your style of talking.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Nonsense! It's the other sort of talking that makes quarrels. Nobody ever quarrels with me.\n\nA gentleman, whose first-rate tailoring and frictionless manners proclaim the wellbred West Ender, comes in from the hall. He has an engaging air of being young and unmarried, but on close inspection is found to be at least over forty.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Excuse my intruding in this fashion, but there is no knocker on the door and the bell does not seem to ring.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Why should there be a knocker? Why should the bell ring? The door is open.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Precisely. So I ventured to come in.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Quite right. I will see about a room for you [he makes for the door].\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN [stopping him]. But I'm afraid you don't know who I am.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. DO you suppose that at my age I make distinctions between one fellow creature and another? [He goes out. Mangan and the newcomer stare at one another].\n\nMANGAN. Strange character, Captain Shotover, sir.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Very.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [shouting outside]. Hesione, another person has arrived and wants a room. Man about town, well dressed, fifty.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Fancy Hesione's feelings! May I ask are you a member of the family?\n\nMANGAN. No.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I am. At least a connection.\n\nMrs Hushabye comes back.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. How do you do? How good of you to come!\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I am very glad indeed to make your acquaintance, Hesione. [Instead of taking her hand he kisses her. At the same moment the captain appears in the doorway]. You will excuse my kissing your daughter, Captain, when I tell you that—\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Stuff! Everyone kisses my daughter. Kiss her as much as you like [he makes for the pantry].\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. Thank you. One moment, Captain. [The captain halts and turns. The gentleman goes to him affably]. Do you happen to remember but probably you don't, as it occurred many years ago— that your younger daughter married a numskull?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Yes. She said she'd marry anybody to get away from this house. I should not have recognized you: your head is no longer like a walnut. Your aspect is softened. You have been boiled in bread and milk for years and years, like other married men. Poor devil! [He disappears into the pantry].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [going past Mangan to the gentleman and scrutinizing him]. I don't believe you are Hastings Utterword.\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I am not.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Then what business had you to kiss me?\n\nTHE GENTLEMAN. I thought I would like to. The fact is, I am Randall Utterword, the unworthy younger brother of Hastings. I was abroad diplomatizing when he was married.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [dashing in]. Hesione, where is the key of the wardrobe in my room? My diamonds are in my dressing-bag: I must lock it up—[recognizing the stranger with a shock] Randall, how dare you? [She marches at him past Mrs Hushabye, who retreats and joins Mangan near the sofa].\n\nRANDALL. How dare I what? I am not doing anything.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Who told you I was here?\n\nRANDALL. Hastings. You had just left when I called on you at Claridge's; so I followed you down here. You are looking extremely well.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Don't presume to tell me so.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What is wrong with Mr Randall, Addy?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [recollecting herself]. Oh, nothing. But he has no right to come bothering you and papa without being invited [she goes to the window-seat and sits down, turning away from them ill-humoredly and looking into the garden, where Hector and Ellie are now seen strolling together].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I think you have not met Mr Mangan, Addy.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [turning her head and nodding coldly to Mangan]. I beg your pardon. Randall, you have flustered me so: I make a perfect fool of myself.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Lady Utterword. My sister. My younger sister.\n\nMANGAN [bowing]. Pleased to meet you, Lady Utterword.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [with marked interest]. Who is that gentleman walking in the garden with Miss Dunn?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I don't know. She quarrelled mortally with my husband only ten minutes ago; and I didn't know anyone else had come. It must be a visitor. [She goes to the window to look]. Oh, it is Hector. They've made it up.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Your husband! That handsome man?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Well, why shouldn't my husband be a handsome man?\n\nRANDALL [joining them at the window]. One's husband never is, Ariadne [he sits by Lady Utterword, on her right].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. One's sister's husband always is, Mr Randall.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Don't be vulgar, Randall. And you, Hesione, are just as bad.\n\nEllie and Hector come in from the garden by the starboard door. Randall rises. Ellie retires into the corner near the pantry. Hector comes forward; and Lady Utterword rises looking her very best.\n\nMRS. HUSHABYE. Hector, this is Addy.\n\nHECTOR [apparently surprised]. Not this lady.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [smiling]. Why not?\n\nHECTOR [looking at her with a piercing glance of deep but respectful admiration, his moustache bristling]. I thought— [pulling himself together]. I beg your pardon, Lady Utterword. I am extremely glad to welcome you at last under our roof [he offers his hand with grave courtesy].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. She wants to be kissed, Hector.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Hesione! [But she still smiles].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Call her Addy; and kiss her like a good brother-in-law; and have done with it. [She leaves them to themselves].\n\nHECTOR. Behave yourself, Hesione. Lady Utterword is entitled not only to hospitality but to civilization.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [gratefully]. Thank you, Hector. [They shake hands cordially].\n\nMazzini Dunn is seen crossing the garden from starboard to port.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [coming from the pantry and addressing Ellie]. Your father has washed himself.\n\nELLIE [quite self-possessed]. He often does, Captain Shotover.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. A strange conversion! I saw him through the pantry window.\n\nMazzini Dunn enters through the port window door, newly washed and brushed, and stops, smiling benevolently, between Mangan and Mrs Hushabye.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [introducing]. Mr Mazzini Dunn, Lady Ut—oh, I forgot: you've met. [Indicating Ellie] Miss Dunn.\n\nMAZZINI [walking across the room to take Ellie's hand, and beaming at his own naughty irony]. I have met Miss Dunn also. She is my daughter. [He draws her arm through his caressingly].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Of course: how stupid! Mr Utterword, my sister's—er—\n\nRANDALL [shaking hands agreeably]. Her brother-in-law, Mr Dunn. How do you do?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. This is my husband.\n\nHECTOR. We have met, dear. Don't introduce us any more. [He moves away to the big chair, and adds] Won't you sit down, Lady Utterword? [She does so very graciously].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Sorry. I hate it: it's like making people show their tickets.\n\nMAZZINI [sententiously]. How little it tells us, after all! The great question is, not who we are, but what we are.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Ha! What are you?\n\nMAZZINI [taken aback]. What am I?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. A thief, a pirate, and a murderer.\n\nMAZZINI. I assure you you are mistaken.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. An adventurous life; but what does it end in? Respectability. A ladylike daughter. The language and appearance of a city missionary. Let it be a warning to all of you [he goes out through the garden].\n\nDUNN. I hope nobody here believes that I am a thief, a pirate, or a murderer. Mrs Hushabye, will you excuse me a moment? I must really go and explain. [He follows the captain].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [as he goes]. It's no use. You'd really better— [but Dunn has vanished]. We had better all go out and look for some tea. We never have regular tea; but you can always get some when you want: the servants keep it stewing all day. The kitchen veranda is the best place to ask. May I show you? [She goes to the starboard door].\n\nRANDALL [going with her]. Thank you, I don't think I'll take any tea this afternoon. But if you will show me the garden—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. There's nothing to see in the garden except papa's observatory, and a gravel pit with a cave where he keeps dynamite and things of that sort. However, it's pleasanter out of doors; so come along.\n\nRANDALL. Dynamite! Isn't that rather risky?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Well, we don't sit in the gravel pit when there's a thunderstorm.\n\nLADY UTTERORRD. That's something new. What is the dynamite for?\n\nHECTOR. To blow up the human race if it goes too far. He is trying to discover a psychic ray that will explode all the explosive at the well of a Mahatma.\n\nELLIE. The captain's tea is delicious, Mr Utterword.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [stopping in the doorway]. Do you mean to say that you've had some of my father's tea? that you got round him before you were ten minutes in the house?\n\nELLIE. I did.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You little devil! [She goes out with Randall].\n\nMANGAN. Won't you come, Miss Ellie?\n\nELLIE. I'm too tired. I'll take a book up to my room and rest a little. [She goes to the bookshelf].\n\nMANGAN. Right. You can't do better. But I'm disappointed. [He follows Randall and Mrs Hushabye].\n\nEllie, Hector, and Lady Utterword are left. Hector is close to Lady Utterword. They look at Ellie, waiting for her to go.\n\nELLIE [looking at the title of a book]. Do you like stories of adventure, Lady Utterword?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [patronizingly]. Of course, dear.\n\nELLIE. Then I'll leave you to Mr Hushabye. [She goes out through the hall].\n\nHECTOR. That girl is mad about tales of adventure. The lies I have to tell her!\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [not interested in Ellie]. When you saw me what did you mean by saying that you thought, and then stopping short? What did you think?\n\nHECTOR [folding his arms and looking down at her magnetically]. May I tell you?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Of course.\n\nHECTOR. It will not sound very civil. I was on the point of saying, \"I thought you were a plain woman.\"\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Oh, for shame, Hector! What right had you to notice whether I am plain or not?\n\nHECTOR. Listen to me, Ariadne. Until today I have seen only photographs of you; and no photograph can give the strange fascination of the daughters of that supernatural old man. There is some damnable quality in them that destroys men's moral sense, and carries them beyond honor and dishonor. You know that, don't you?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Perhaps I do, Hector. But let me warn you once for all that I am a rigidly conventional woman. You may think because I'm a Shotover that I'm a Bohemian, because we are all so horribly Bohemian. But I'm not. I hate and loathe Bohemianism. No child brought up in a strict Puritan household ever suffered from Puritanism as I suffered from our Bohemianism.\n\nHECTOR. Our children are like that. They spend their holidays in the houses of their respectable schoolfellows.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. I shall invite them for Christmas.\n\nHECTOR. Their absence leaves us both without our natural chaperones.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Children are certainly very inconvenient sometimes. But intelligent people can always manage, unless they are Bohemians.\n\nHECTOR. You are no Bohemian; but you are no Puritan either: your attraction is alive and powerful. What sort of woman do you count yourself?\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. I am a woman of the world, Hector; and I can assure you that if you will only take the trouble always to do the perfectly correct thing, and to say the perfectly correct thing, you can do just what you like. An ill-conducted, careless woman gets simply no chance. An ill-conducted, careless man is never allowed within arm's length of any woman worth knowing.\n\nHECTOR. I see. You are neither a Bohemian woman nor a Puritan woman. You are a dangerous woman.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. On the contrary, I am a safe woman.\n\nHECTOR. You are a most accursedly attractive woman. Mind, I am not making love to you. I do not like being attracted. But you had better know how I feel if you are going to stay here.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. You are an exceedingly clever lady-killer, Hector. And terribly handsome. I am quite a good player, myself, at that game. Is it quite understood that we are only playing?\n\nHECTOR. Quite. I am deliberately playing the fool, out of sheer worthlessness.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [rising brightly]. Well, you are my brother-in-law, Hesione asked you to kiss me. [He seizes her in his arms and kisses her strenuously]. Oh! that was a little more than play, brother-in-law. [She pushes him suddenly away]. You shall not do that again.\n\nHECTOR. In effect, you got your claws deeper into me than I intended.\n\nMRS HUBHABYE [coming in from the garden]. Don't let me disturb you; I only want a cap to put on daddiest. The sun is setting; and he'll catch cold [she makes for the door leading to the hall].\n\nLADY UTTERWORD. Your husband is quite charming, darling. He has actually condescended to kiss me at last. I shall go into the garden: it's cooler now [she goes out by the port door].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Take care, dear child. I don't believe any man can kiss Addy without falling in love with her. [She goes into the hall].\n\nHECTOR [striking himself on the chest]. Fool! Goat!\n\nMrs Hushabye comes back with the captain's cap.\n\nHECTOR. Your sister is an extremely enterprising old girl. Where's Miss Dunn!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Mangan says she has gone up to her room for a nap. Addy won't let you talk to Ellie: she has marked you for her own.\n\nHECTOR. She has the diabolical family fascination. I began making love to her automatically. What am I to do? I can't fall in love; and I can't hurt a woman's feelings by telling her so when she falls in love with me. And as women are always falling in love with my moustache I get landed in all sorts of tedious and terrifying flirtations in which I'm not a bit in earnest.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Oh, neither is Addy. She has never been in love in her life, though she has always been trying to fall in head over ears. She is worse than you, because you had one real go at least, with me.\n\nHECTOR. That was a confounded madness. I can't believe that such an amazing experience is common. It has left its mark on me. I believe that is why I have never been able to repeat it.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [laughing and caressing his arm]. We were frightfully in love with one another, Hector. It was such an enchanting dream that I have never been able to grudge it to you or anyone else since. I have invited all sorts of pretty women to the house on the chance of giving you another turn. But it has never come off.\n\nHECTOR. I don't know that I want it to come off. It was damned dangerous. You fascinated me; but I loved you; so it was heaven. This sister of yours fascinates me; but I hate her; so it is hell. I shall kill her if she persists.\n\nMRS. HUSHABYE. Nothing will kill Addy; she is as strong as a horse. [Releasing him]. Now I am going off to fascinate somebody.\n\nHECTOR. The Foreign Office toff? Randall?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Goodness gracious, no! Why should I fascinate him?\n\nHECTOR. I presume you don't mean the bloated capitalist, Mangan?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Hm! I think he had better be fascinated by me than by Ellie. [She is going into the garden when the captain comes in from it with some sticks in his hand]. What have you got there, daddiest?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Dynamite.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You've been to the gravel pit. Don't drop it about the house, there's a dear. [She goes into the garden, where the evening light is now very red].\n\nHECTOR. Listen, O sage. How long dare you concentrate on a feeling without risking having it fixed in your consciousness all the rest of your life?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Ninety minutes. An hour and a half. [He goes into the pantry].\n\nHector, left alone, contracts his brows, and falls into a day-dream. He does not move for some time. Then he folds his arms. Then, throwing his hands behind him, and gripping one with the other, he strides tragically once to and fro. Suddenly he snatches his walking stick from the teak table, and draws it; for it is a swordstick. He fights a desperate duel with an imaginary antagonist, and after many vicissitudes runs him through the body up to the hilt. He sheathes his sword and throws it on the sofa, falling into another reverie as he does so. He looks straight into the eyes of an imaginary woman; seizes her by the arms; and says in a deep and thrilling tone, \"Do you love me!\" The captain comes out of the pantry at this moment; and Hector, caught with his arms stretched out and his fists clenched, has to account for his attitude by going through a series of gymnastic exercises.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. That sort of strength is no good. You will never be as strong as a gorilla.\n\nHECTOR. What is the dynamite for?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. To kill fellows like Mangan.\n\nHECTOR. No use. They will always be able to buy more dynamite than you.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. I will make a dynamite that he cannot explode.\n\nHECTOR. And that you can, eh?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Yes: when I have attained the seventh degree of concentration.\n\nHECTOR. What's the use of that? You never do attain it.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. What then is to be done? Are we to be kept forever in the mud by these hogs to whom the universe is nothing but a machine for greasing their bristles and filling their snouts?\n\nHECTOR. Are Mangan's bristles worse than Randall's lovelocks?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER,. We must win powers of life and death over them both. I refuse to die until I have invented the means.\n\nHECTOR. Who are we that we should judge them?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. What are they that they should judge us? Yet they do, unhesitatingly. There is enmity between our seed and their seed. They know it and act on it, strangling our souls. They believe in themselves. When we believe in ourselves, we shall kill them.\n\nHECTOR. It is the same seed. You forget that your pirate has a very nice daughter. Mangan's son may be a Plato: Randall's a Shelley. What was my father?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. The damnedst scoundrel I ever met. [He replaces the drawing-board; sits down at the table; and begins to mix a wash of color].\n\nHECTOR. Precisely. Well, dare you kill his innocent grandchildren?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. They are mine also.\n\nHECTOR. Just so—we are members one of another. [He throws himself carelessly on the sofa]. I tell you I have often thought of this killing of human vermin. Many men have thought of it. Decent men are like Daniel in the lion's den: their survival is a miracle; and they do not always survive. We live among the Mangans and Randalls and Billie Dunns as they, poor devils, live among the disease germs and the doctors and the lawyers and the parsons and the restaurant chefs and the tradesmen and the servants and all the rest of the parasites and blackmailers. What are our terrors to theirs? Give me the power to kill them; and I'll spare them in sheer—\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [cutting in sharply]. Fellow feeling?\n\nHECTOR. No. I should kill myself if I believed that. I must believe that my spark, small as it is, is divine, and that the red light over their door is hell fire. I should spare them in simple magnanimous pity.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. You can't spare them until you have the power to kill them. At present they have the power to kill you. There are millions of blacks over the water for them to train and let loose on us. They're going to do it. They're doing it already.\n\nHECTOR. They are too stupid to use their power.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [throwing down his brush and coming to the end of the sofa]. Do not deceive yourself: they do use it. We kill the better half of ourselves every day to propitiate them. The knowledge that these people are there to render all our aspirations barren prevents us having the aspirations. And when we are tempted to seek their destruction they bring forth demons to delude us, disguised as pretty daughters, and singers and poets and the like, for whose sake we spare them.\n\nHECTOR [sitting up and leaning towards him]. May not Hesione be such a demon, brought forth by you lest I should slay you?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. That is possible. She has used you up, and left you nothing but dreams, as some women do.\n\nHECTOR. Vampire women, demon women.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Men think the world well lost for them, and lose it accordingly. Who are the men that do things? The husbands of the shrew and of the drunkard, the men with the thorn in the flesh. [Walking distractedly away towards the pantry]. I must think these things out. [Turning suddenly]. But I go on with the dynamite none the less. I will discover a ray mightier than any X-ray: a mind ray that will explode the ammunition in the belt of my adversary before he can point his gun at me. And I must hurry. I am old: I have no time to waste in talk [he is about to go into the pantry, and Hector is making for the hall, when Hesione comes back].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Daddiest, you and Hector must come and help me to entertain all these people. What on earth were you shouting about?\n\nHECTOR [stopping in the act of turning the door handle]. He is madder than usual.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. We all are.\n\nHECTOR. I must change [he resumes his door opening].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Stop, stop. Come back, both of you. Come back. [They return, reluctantly]. Money is running short.\n\nHECTOR. Money! Where are my April dividends?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Where is the snow that fell last year?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Where is all the money you had for that patent lifeboat I invented?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Five hundred pounds; and I have made it last since Easter!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Since Easter! Barely four months! Monstrous extravagance! I could live for seven years on 500 pounds.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Not keeping open house as we do here, daddiest.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Only 500 pounds for that lifeboat! I got twelve thousand for the invention before that.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Yes, dear; but that was for the ship with the magnetic keel that sucked up submarines. Living at the rate we do, you cannot afford life-saving inventions. Can't you think of something that will murder half Europe at one bang?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. No. I am ageing fast. My mind does not dwell on slaughter as it did when I was a boy. Why doesn't your husband invent something? He does nothing but tell lies to women.\n\nHECTOR. Well, that is a form of invention, is it not? However, you are right: I ought to support my wife.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Indeed you shall do nothing of the sort: I should never see you from breakfast to dinner. I want my husband.\n\nHECTOR [bitterly]. I might as well be your lapdog.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Do you want to be my breadwinner, like the other poor husbands?\n\nHECTOR. No, by thunder! What a damned creature a husband is anyhow!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [to the captain]. What about that harpoon cannon?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. No use. It kills whales, not men.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Why not? You fire the harpoon out of a cannon. It sticks in the enemy's general; you wind him in; and there you are.\n\nHECTOR. You are your father's daughter, Hesione.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. There is something in it. Not to wind in generals: they are not dangerous. But one could fire a grapnel and wind in a machine gun or even a tank. I will think it out.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [squeezing the captain's arm affectionately]. Saved! You are a darling, daddiest. Now we must go back to these dreadful people and entertain them.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. They have had no dinner. Don't forget that.\n\nHECTOR. Neither have I. And it is dark: it must be all hours.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Oh, Guinness will produce some sort of dinner for them. The servants always take jolly good care that there is food in the house.\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [raising a strange wail in the darkness]. What a house! What a daughter!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [raving]. What a father!\n\nHECTOR [following suit]. What a husband!\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. Is there no thunder in heaven?\n\nHECTOR. Is there no beauty, no bravery, on earth?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What do men want? They have their food, their firesides, their clothes mended, and our love at the end of the day. Why are they not satisfied? Why do they envy us the pain with which we bring them into the world, and make strange dangers and torments for themselves to be even with us?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER [weirdly chanting].\n\nI builded a house for my daughters, and opened the doors thereof, That men might come for their choosing, and their betters spring from their love; But one of them married a numskull;\n\nHECTOR [taking up the rhythm].\n\nThe other a liar wed;\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [completing the stanza].\n\nAnd now must she lie beside him, even as she made her bed.\n\nLADY UTTERWORD [calling from the garden]. Hesione! Hesione! Where are you?\n\nHECTOR. The cat is on the tiles.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Coming, darling, coming [she goes quickly into the garden].\n\nThe captain goes back to his place at the table.\n\nHECTOR [going out into the hall]. Shall I turn up the lights for you?\n\nCAPTAIN SHOTOVER. No. Give me deeper darkness. Money is not made in the light.\n\nACT II\n\nThe same room, with the lights turned up and the curtains drawn. Ellie comes in, followed by Mangan. Both are dressed for dinner. She strolls to the drawing-table. He comes between the table and the wicker chair.\n\nMANGAN. What a dinner! I don't call it a dinner: I call it a meal.\n\nELLIE. I am accustomed to meals, Mr Mangan, and very lucky to get them. Besides, the captain cooked some maccaroni for me.\n\nMANGAN [shuddering liverishly]. Too rich: I can't eat such things. I suppose it's because I have to work so much with my brain. That's the worst of being a man of business: you are always thinking, thinking, thinking. By the way, now that we are alone, may I take the opportunity to come to a little understanding with you?\n\nELLIE [settling into the draughtsman's seat]. Certainly. I should like to.\n\nMANGAN [taken aback]. Should you? That surprises me; for I thought I noticed this afternoon that you avoided me all you could. Not for the first time either.\n\nELLIE. I was very tired and upset. I wasn't used to the ways of this extraordinary house. Please forgive me.\n\nMANGAN. Oh, that's all right: I don't mind. But Captain Shotover has been talking to me about you. You and me, you know.\n\nELLIE [interested]. The captain! What did he say?\n\nMANGAN. Well, he noticed the difference between our ages.\n\nELLIE. He notices everything.\n\nMANGAN. You don't mind, then?\n\nELLIE. Of course I know quite well that our engagement—\n\nMANGAN. Oh! you call it an engagement.\n\nELLIE. Well, isn't it?\n\nMANGAN. Oh, yes, yes: no doubt it is if you hold to it. This is the first time you've used the word; and I didn't quite know where we stood: that's all. [He sits down in the wicker chair; and resigns himself to allow her to lead the conversation]. You were saying—?\n\nELLIE. Was I? I forget. Tell me. Do you like this part of the country? I heard you ask Mr Hushabye at dinner whether there are any nice houses to let down here.\n\nMANGAN. I like the place. The air suits me. I shouldn't be surprised if I settled down here.\n\nELLIE. Nothing would please me better. The air suits me too. And I want to be near Hesione.\n\nMANGAN [with growing uneasiness]. The air may suit us; but the question is, should we suit one another? Have you thought about that?\n\nELLIE. Mr Mangan, we must be sensible, mustn't we? It's no use pretending that we are Romeo and Juliet. But we can get on very well together if we choose to make the best of it. Your kindness of heart will make it easy for me.\n\nMANGAN [leaning forward, with the beginning of something like deliberate unpleasantness in his voice]. Kindness of heart, eh? I ruined your father, didn't I?\n\nELLIE. Oh, not intentionally.\n\nMANGAN. Yes I did. Ruined him on purpose.\n\nELLIE. On purpose!\n\nMANGAN. Not out of ill-nature, you know. And you'll admit that I kept a job for him when I had finished with him. But business is business; and I ruined him as a matter of business.\n\nELLIE. I don't understand how that can be. Are you trying to make me feel that I need not be grateful to you, so that I may choose freely?\n\nMANGAN [rising aggressively]. No. I mean what I say.\n\nELLIE. But how could it possibly do you any good to ruin my father? The money he lost was yours.\n\nMANGAN [with a sour laugh]. Was mine! It is mine, Miss Ellie, and all the money the other fellows lost too. [He shoves his hands into his pockets and shows his teeth]. I just smoked them out like a hive of bees. What do you say to that? A bit of shock, eh?\n\nELLIE. It would have been, this morning. Now! you can't think how little it matters. But it's quite interesting. Only, you must explain it to me. I don't understand it. [Propping her elbows on the drawingboard and her chin on her hands, she composes herself to listen with a combination of conscious curiosity with unconscious contempt which provokes him to more and more unpleasantness, and an attempt at patronage of her ignorance].\n\nMANGAN. Of course you don't understand: what do you know about business? You just listen and learn. Your father's business was a new business; and I don't start new businesses: I let other fellows start them. They put all their money and their friends' money into starting them. They wear out their souls and bodies trying to make a success of them. They're what you call enthusiasts. But the first dead lift of the thing is too much for them; and they haven't enough financial experience. In a year or so they have either to let the whole show go bust, or sell out to a new lot of fellows for a few deferred ordinary shares: that is, if they're lucky enough to get anything at all. As likely as not the very same thing happens to the new lot. They put in more money and a couple of years' more work; and then perhaps they have to sell out to a third lot. If it's really a big thing the third lot will have to sell out too, and leave their work and their money behind them. And that's where the real business man comes in: where I come in. But I'm cleverer than some: I don't mind dropping a little money to start the process. I took your father's measure. I saw that he had a sound idea, and that he would work himself silly for it if he got the chance. I saw that he was a child in business, and was dead certain to outrun his expenses and be in too great a hurry to wait for his market. I knew that the surest way to ruin a man who doesn't know how to handle money is to give him some. I explained my idea to some friends in the city, and they found the money; for I take no risks in ideas, even when they're my own. Your father and the friends that ventured their money with him were no more to me than a heap of squeezed lemons. You've been wasting your gratitude: my kind heart is all rot. I'm sick of it. When I see your father beaming at me with his moist, grateful eyes, regularly wallowing in gratitude, I sometimes feel I must tell him the truth or burst. What stops me is that I know he wouldn't believe me. He'd think it was my modesty, as you did just now. He'd think anything rather than the truth, which is that he's a blamed fool, and I am a man that knows how to take care of himself. [He throws himself back into the big chair with large self approval]. Now what do you think of me, Miss Ellie?\n\nELLIE [dropping her hands]. How strange! that my mother, who knew nothing at all about business, should have been quite right about you! She always said not before papa, of course, but to us children—that you were just that sort of man.\n\nMANGAN [sitting up, much hurt]. Oh! did she? And yet she'd have let you marry me.\n\nELLIE. Well, you see, Mr Mangan, my mother married a very good man—for whatever you may think of my father as a man of business, he is the soul of goodness—and she is not at all keen on my doing the same.\n\nMANGAN. Anyhow, you don't want to marry me now, do you?\n\nELLIE. [very calmly]. Oh, I think so. Why not?\n\nMANGAN. [rising aghast]. Why not!\n\nELLIE. I don't see why we shouldn't get on very well together.\n\nMANGAN. Well, but look here, you know—[he stops, quite at a loss].\n\nELLIE. [patiently]. Well?\n\nMANGAN. Well, I thought you were rather particular about people's characters.\n\nELLIE. If we women were particular about men's characters, we should never get married at all, Mr Mangan.\n\nMANGAN. A child like you talking of \"we women\"! What next! You're not in earnest?\n\nELLIE. Yes, I am. Aren't you?\n\nMANGAN. You mean to hold me to it?\n\nELLIE. Do you wish to back out of it?\n\nMANGAN. Oh, no. Not exactly back out of it.\n\nELLIE. Well?\n\nHe has nothing to say. With a long whispered whistle, he drops into the wicker chair and stares before him like a beggared gambler. But a cunning look soon comes into his face. He leans over towards her on his right elbow, and speaks in a low steady voice.\n\nMANGAN. Suppose I told you I was in love with another woman!\n\nELLIE [echoing him]. Suppose I told you I was in love with another man!\n\nMANGAN [bouncing angrily out of his chair]. I'm not joking.\n\nELLIE. Who told you I was?\n\nMANGAN. I tell you I'm serious. You're too young to be serious; but you'll have to believe me. I want to be near your friend Mrs Hushabye. I'm in love with her. Now the murder's out.\n\nELLIE. I want to be near your friend Mr Hushabye. I'm in love with him. [She rises and adds with a frank air] Now we are in one another's confidence, we shall be real friends. Thank you for telling me.\n\nMANGAN [almost beside himself]. Do you think I'll be made a convenience of like this?\n\nELLIE. Come, Mr Mangan! you made a business convenience of my father. Well, a woman's business is marriage. Why shouldn't I make a domestic convenience of you?\n\nMANGAN. Because I don't choose, see? Because I'm not a silly gull like your father. That's why.\n\nELLIE [with serene contempt]. You are not good enough to clean my father's boots, Mr Mangan; and I am paying you a great compliment in condescending to make a convenience of you, as you call it. Of course you are free to throw over our engagement if you like; but, if you do, you'll never enter Hesione's house again: I will take care of that.\n\nMANGAN [gasping]. You little devil, you've done me. [On the point of collapsing into the big chair again he recovers himself]. Wait a bit, though: you're not so cute as you think. You can't beat Boss Mangan as easy as that. Suppose I go straight to Mrs Hushabye and tell her that you're in love with her husband.\n\nELLIE. She knows it.\n\nMANGAN. You told her!!!\n\nELLIE. She told me.\n\nMANGAN [clutching at his bursting temples]. Oh, this is a crazy house. Or else I'm going clean off my chump. Is she making a swop with you—she to have your husband and you to have hers?\n\nELLIE. Well, you don't want us both, do you?\n\nMANGAN [throwing himself into the chair distractedly]. My brain won't stand it. My head's going to split. Help! Help me to hold it. Quick: hold it: squeeze it. Save me. [Ellie comes behind his chair; clasps his head hard for a moment; then begins to draw her hands from his forehead back to his ears]. Thank you. [Drowsily]. That's very refreshing. [Waking a little]. Don't you hypnotize me, though. I've seen men made fools of by hypnotism.\n\nELLIE [steadily]. Be quiet. I've seen men made fools of without hypnotism.\n\nMANGAN [humbly]. You don't dislike touching me, I hope. You never touched me before, I noticed.\n\nELLIE. Not since you fell in love naturally with a grown-up nice woman, who will never expect you to make love to her. And I will never expect him to make love to me.\n\nMANGAN. He may, though.\n\nELLIE [making her passes rhythmically]. Hush. Go to sleep. Do you hear? You are to go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep; be quiet, deeply deeply quiet; sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.\n\nHe falls asleep. Ellie steals away; turns the light out; and goes into the garden.\n\nNurse Guinness opens the door and is seen in the light which comes in from the hall.\n\nGUINNESS [speaking to someone outside]. Mr Mangan's not here, duckie: there's no one here. It's all dark.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [without]. Try the garden. Mr Dunn and I will be in my boudoir. Show him the way.\n\nGUINNESS. Yes, ducky. [She makes for the garden door in the dark; stumbles over the sleeping Mangan and screams]. Ahoo! O Lord, Sir! I beg your pardon, I'm sure: I didn't see you in the dark. Who is it? [She goes back to the door and turns on the light]. Oh, Mr Mangan, sir, I hope I haven't hurt you plumping into your lap like that. [Coming to him]. I was looking for you, sir. Mrs Hushabye says will you please [noticing that he remains quite insensible]. Oh, my good Lord, I hope I haven't killed him. Sir! Mr Mangan! Sir! [She shakes him; and he is rolling inertly off the chair on the floor when she holds him up and props him against the cushion]. Miss Hessy! Miss Hessy! quick, doty darling. Miss Hessy! [Mrs Hushabye comes in from the hall, followed by Mazzini Dunn]. Oh, Miss Hessy, I've been and killed him.\n\nMazzini runs round the back of the chair to Mangan's right hand, and sees that the nurse's words are apparently only too true.\n\nMAZZINI. What tempted you to commit such a crime, woman?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [trying not to laugh]. Do you mean, you did it on purpose?\n\nGUINNESS. Now is it likely I'd kill any man on purpose? I fell over him in the dark; and I'm a pretty tidy weight. He never spoke nor moved until I shook him; and then he would have dropped dead on the floor. Isn't it tiresome?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [going past the nurse to Mangan's side, and inspecting him less credulously than Mazzini]. Nonsense! he is not dead: he is only asleep. I can see him breathing.\n\nGUINNESS. But why won't he wake?\n\nMAZZINI [speaking very politely into Mangan's ear]. Mangan! My dear Mangan! [he blows into Mangan's ear].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. That's no good [she shakes him vigorously]. Mr Mangan, wake up. Do you hear? [He begins to roll over]. Oh! Nurse, nurse: he's falling: help me.\n\nNurse Guinness rushes to the rescue. With Mazzini's assistance, Mangan is propped safely up again.\n\nGUINNESS [behind the chair; bending over to test the case with her nose]. Would he be drunk, do you think, pet?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Had he any of papa's rum?\n\nMAZZINI. It can't be that: he is most abstemious. I am afraid he drank too much formerly, and has to drink too little now. You know, Mrs Hushabye, I really think he has been hypnotized.\n\nGUINNESS. Hip no what, sir?\n\nMAZZINI. One evening at home, after we had seen a hypnotizing performance, the children began playing at it; and Ellie stroked my head. I assure you I went off dead asleep; and they had to send for a professional to wake me up after I had slept eighteen hours. They had to carry me upstairs; and as the poor children were not very strong, they let me slip; and I rolled right down the whole flight and never woke up. [Mrs Hushabye splutters]. Oh, you may laugh, Mrs Hushabye; but I might have been killed.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I couldn't have helped laughing even if you had been, Mr Dunn. So Ellie has hypnotized him. What fun!\n\nMAZZINI. Oh no, no, no. It was such a terrible lesson to her: nothing would induce her to try such a thing again.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Then who did it? I didn't.\n\nMAZZINI. I thought perhaps the captain might have done it unintentionally. He is so fearfully magnetic: I feel vibrations whenever he comes close to me.\n\nGUINNESS. The captain will get him out of it anyhow, sir: I'll back him for that. I'll go fetch him [she makes for the pantry].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Wait a bit. [To Mazzini]. You say he is all right for eighteen hours?\n\nMAZZINI. Well, I was asleep for eighteen hours.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Were you any the worse for it?\n\nMAZZINI. I don't quite remember. They had poured brandy down my throat, you see; and—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Quite. Anyhow, you survived. Nurse, darling: go and ask Miss Dunn to come to us here. Say I want to speak to her particularly. You will find her with Mr Hushabye probably.\n\nGUINNESS. I think not, ducky: Miss Addy is with him. But I'll find her and send her to you. [She goes out into the garden].\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [calling Mazzini's attention to the figure on the chair]. Now, Mr Dunn, look. Just look. Look hard. Do you still intend to sacrifice your daughter to that thing?\n\nMAZZINI [troubled]. You have completely upset me, Mrs Hushabye, by all you have said to me. That anyone could imagine that I—I, a consecrated soldier of freedom, if I may say so—could sacrifice Ellie to anybody or anyone, or that I should ever have dreamed of forcing her inclinations in any way, is a most painful blow to my—well, I suppose you would say to my good opinion of myself.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [rather stolidly]. Sorry.\n\nMAZZINI [looking forlornly at the body]. What is your objection to poor Mangan, Mrs Hushabye? He looks all right to me. But then I am so accustomed to him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Have you no heart? Have you no sense? Look at the brute! Think of poor weak innocent Ellie in the clutches of this slavedriver, who spends his life making thousands of rough violent workmen bend to his will and sweat for him: a man accustomed to have great masses of iron beaten into shape for him by steam-hammers! to fight with women and girls over a halfpenny an hour ruthlessly! a captain of industry, I think you call him, don't you? Are you going to fling your delicate, sweet, helpless child into such a beast's claws just because he will keep her in an expensive house and make her wear diamonds to show how rich he is?\n\nMAZZINI [staring at her in wide-eyed amazement]. Bless you, dear Mrs Hushabye, what romantic ideas of business you have! Poor dear Mangan isn't a bit like that.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [scornfully]. Poor dear Mangan indeed!\n\nMAZZINI. But he doesn't know anything about machinery. He never goes near the men: he couldn't manage them: he is afraid of them. I never can get him to take the least interest in the works: he hardly knows more about them than you do. People are cruelly unjust to Mangan: they think he is all rugged strength just because his manners are bad.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Do you mean to tell me he isn't strong enough to crush poor little Ellie?\n\nMAZZINI. Of course it's very hard to say how any marriage will turn out; but speaking for myself, I should say that he won't have a dog's chance against Ellie. You know, Ellie has remarkable strength of character. I think it is because I taught her to like Shakespeare when she was very young.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [contemptuously]. Shakespeare! The next thing you will tell me is that you could have made a great deal more money than Mangan. [She retires to the sofa, and sits down at the port end of it in the worst of humors].\n\nMAZZINI [following her and taking the other end]. No: I'm no good at making money. I don't care enough for it, somehow. I'm not ambitious! that must be it. Mangan is wonderful about money: he thinks of nothing else. He is so dreadfully afraid of being poor. I am always thinking of other things: even at the works I think of the things we are doing and not of what they cost. And the worst of it is, poor Mangan doesn't know what to do with his money when he gets it. He is such a baby that he doesn't know even what to eat and drink: he has ruined his liver eating and drinking the wrong things; and now he can hardly eat at all. Ellie will diet him splendidly. You will be surprised when you come to know him better: he is really the most helpless of mortals. You get quite a protective feeling towards him.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Then who manages his business, pray?\n\nMAZZINI. I do. And of course other people like me.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Footling people, you mean.\n\nMAZZINI. I suppose you'd think us so.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. And pray why don't you do without him if you're all so much cleverer?\n\nMAZZINI. Oh, we couldn't: we should ruin the business in a year. I've tried; and I know. We should spend too much on everything. We should improve the quality of the goods and make them too dear. We should be sentimental about the hard cases among the work people. But Mangan keeps us in order. He is down on us about every extra halfpenny. We could never do without him. You see, he will sit up all night thinking of how to save sixpence. Won't Ellie make him jump, though, when she takes his house in hand!\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Then the creature is a fraud even as a captain of industry!\n\nMAZZINI. I am afraid all the captains of industry are what you call frauds, Mrs Hushabye. Of course there are some manufacturers who really do understand their own works; but they don't make as high a rate of profit as Mangan does. I assure you Mangan is quite a good fellow in his way. He means well.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. He doesn't look well. He is not in his first youth, is he?\n\nMAZZINI. After all, no husband is in his first youth for very long, Mrs Hushabye. And men can't afford to marry in their first youth nowadays.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Now if I said that, it would sound witty. Why can't you say it wittily? What on earth is the matter with you? Why don't you inspire everybody with confidence? with respect?\n\nMAZZINI [humbly]. I think that what is the matter with me is that I am poor. You don't know what that means at home. Mind: I don't say they have ever complained. They've all been wonderful: they've been proud of my poverty. They've even joked about it quite often. But my wife has had a very poor time of it. She has been quite resigned—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [shuddering involuntarily!]\n\nMAZZINI. There! You see, Mrs Hushabye. I don't want Ellie to live on resignation.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Do you want her to have to resign herself to living with a man she doesn't love?\n\nMAZZINI [wistfully]. Are you sure that would be worse than living with a man she did love, if he was a footling person?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [relaxing her contemptuous attitude, quite interested in Mazzini now]. You know, I really think you must love Ellie very much; for you become quite clever when you talk about her.\n\nMAZZINI. I didn't know I was so very stupid on other subjects.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You are, sometimes.\n\nMAZZINI [turning his head away; for his eyes are wet]. I have learnt a good deal about myself from you, Mrs Hushabye; and I'm afraid I shall not be the happier for your plain speaking. But if you thought I needed it to make me think of Ellie's happiness you were very much mistaken.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [leaning towards him kindly]. Have I been a beast?\n\nMAZZINI [pulling himself together]. It doesn't matter about me, Mrs Hushabye. I think you like Ellie; and that is enough for me.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I'm beginning to like you a little. I perfectly loathed you at first. I thought you the most odious, self-satisfied, boresome elderly prig I ever met.\n\nMAZZINI [resigned, and now quite cheerful]. I daresay I am all that. I never have been a favorite with gorgeous women like you. They always frighten me.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [pleased]. Am I a gorgeous woman, Mazzini? I shall fall in love with you presently.\n\nMAZZINI [with placid gallantry]. No, you won't, Hesione. But you would be quite safe. Would you believe it that quite a lot of women have flirted with me because I am quite safe? But they get tired of me for the same reason.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [mischievously]. Take care. You may not be so safe as you think.\n\nMAZZINI. Oh yes, quite safe. You see, I have been in love really: the sort of love that only happens once. [Softly]. That's why Ellie is such a lovely girl.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Well, really, you are coming out. Are you quite sure you won't let me tempt you into a second grand passion?\n\nMAZZINI. Quite. It wouldn't be natural. The fact is, you don't strike on my box, Mrs Hushabye; and I certainly don't strike on yours.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. I see. Your marriage was a safety match.\n\nMAZZINI. What a very witty application of the expression I used! I should never have thought of it.\n\nEllie comes in from the garden, looking anything but happy.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [rising]. Oh! here is Ellie at last. [She goes behind the sofa].\n\nELLIE [on the threshold of the starboard door]. Guinness said you wanted me: you and papa.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You have kept us waiting so long that it almost came to—well, never mind. Your father is a very wonderful man [she ruffles his hair affectionately]: the only one I ever met who could resist me when I made myself really agreeable. [She comes to the big chair, on Mangan's left]. Come here. I have something to show you. [Ellie strolls listlessly to the other side of the chair]. Look.\n\nELLIE [contemplating Mangan without interest]. I know. He is only asleep. We had a talk after dinner; and he fell asleep in the middle of it.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. You did it, Ellie. You put him asleep.\n\nMAZZINI [rising quickly and coming to the back of the chair]. Oh, I hope not. Did you, Ellie?\n\nELLIE [wearily]. He asked me to.\n\nMAZZINI. But it's dangerous. You know what happened to me.\n\nELLIE [utterly indifferent]. Oh, I daresay I can wake him. If not, somebody else can.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. It doesn't matter, anyhow, because I have at last persuaded your father that you don't want to marry him.\n\nELLIE [suddenly coming out of her listlessness, much vexed]. But why did you do that, Hesione? I do want to marry him. I fully intend to marry him.\n\nMAZZINI. Are you quite sure, Ellie? Mrs Hushabye has made me feel that I may have been thoughtless and selfish about it.\n\nELLIE [very clearly and steadily]. Papa. When Mrs. Hushabye takes it on herself to explain to you what I think or don't think, shut your ears tight; and shut your eyes too. Hesione knows nothing about me: she hasn't the least notion of the sort of person I am, and never will. I promise you I won't do anything I don't want to do and mean to do for my own sake.\n\nMAZZINI. You are quite, quite sure?\n\nELLIE. Quite, quite sure. Now you must go away and leave me to talk to Mrs Hushabye.\n\nMAZZINI. But I should like to hear. Shall I be in the way?\n\nELLIE [inexorable]. I had rather talk to her alone.\n\nMAZZINI [affectionately]. Oh, well, I know what a nuisance parents are, dear. I will be good and go. [He goes to the garden door]. By the way, do you remember the address of that professional who woke me up? Don't you think I had better telegraph to him?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [moving towards the sofa]. It's too late to telegraph tonight.\n\nMAZZINI. I suppose so. I do hope he'll wake up in the course of the night. [He goes out into the garden].\n\nELLIE [turning vigorously on Hesione the moment her father is out of the room]. Hesione, what the devil do you mean by making mischief with my father about Mangan?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [promptly losing her temper]. Don't you dare speak to me like that, you little minx. Remember that you are in my house.\n\nELLIE. Stuff! Why don't you mind your own business? What is it to you whether I choose to marry Mangan or not?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Do you suppose you can bully me, you miserable little matrimonial adventurer?\n\nELLIE. Every woman who hasn't any money is a matrimonial adventurer. It's easy for you to talk: you have never known what it is to want money; and you can pick up men as if they were daisies. I am poor and respectable—\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [interrupting]. Ho! respectable! How did you pick up Mangan? How did you pick up my husband? You have the audacity to tell me that I am a—a—a—\n\nELLIE. A siren. So you are. You were born to lead men by the nose: if you weren't, Marcus would have waited for me, perhaps.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [suddenly melting and half laughing]. Oh, my poor Ellie, my pettikins, my unhappy darling! I am so sorry about Hector. But what can I do? It's not my fault: I'd give him to you if I could.\n\nELLIE. I don't blame you for that.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. What a brute I was to quarrel with you and call you names! Do kiss me and say you're not angry with me.\n\nELLIE [fiercely]. Oh, don't slop and gush and be sentimental. Don't you see that unless I can be hard—as hard as nails—I shall go mad? I don't care a damn about your calling me names: do you think a woman in my situation can feel a few hard words?\n\nMRS HUSHABYE. Poor little woman! Poor little situation!\n\nELLIE. I suppose you think you're being sympathetic. You are just foolish and stupid and selfish. You see me getting a smasher right in the face that kills a whole part of my life: the best part that can never come again; and you think you can help me over it by a little coaxing and kissing. When I want all the strength I can get to lean on: something iron, something stony, I don't care how cruel it is, you go all mushy and want to slobber over me. I'm not angry; I'm not unfriendly; but for God's sake do pull yourself together; and don't think that because you're on velvet and always have been, women who are in hell can take it as easily as you.\n\nMRS HUSHABYE [shrugging her shoulders]."
