Life

George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, the son of a civil servant. After working as a real estate agent, he moved to London at the age of 20. Before he became established as a leading music and literary critic, five of his novels had been rejected. He belonged to the Fabian Society, a socialist thinktank whose members included the author Virginia Woolf. At the same time, he advocated racial biology and made positive statements about Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini.

Work

George Bernard Shaw, the commentator and theatre critic, became an author to illustrate his criticisms of contemporary British theater. He made his debut with Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant (1898) and asserted that art should be didactic and discuss social issues. Shaw’s plays are characterized by satire, provocation and allegories. He wrote more than 60 plays, of which Pygmalion (1912) is best remembered today. Shaw propounded the idea of “creative evolution,” a kind of racial biology that did not recognize the equal worth of individuals.
