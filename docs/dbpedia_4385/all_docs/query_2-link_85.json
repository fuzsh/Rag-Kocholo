        "text": "While the world associates Hollywood with the movie industry, few know that New Jersey is where it all began.\n\nIt may come as a surprise, but Universal, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), and 20th Century Fox all had their roots in Fort Lee. Some of the biggest names of the silent movie era — Dorothy and Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Rudolph Valentino, Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers and others — starred in films produced in Fort Lee.\n\n“We were the film capital of the world back in the early silent era,” said Steven Gorelick, president of the New Jersey Film Commission.\n\nIt is only logical that filmmaking would begin in the Garden State. After all, Thomas Edison invented the world’s first movie camera – the kinetoscope – on the grounds of his West Orange laboratory. In 1893, he built the world’s first purpose-built movie studio, a one-room photographic shack covered in dark tar paper that was dubbed the “Black Maria.”\n\nIn fact, the first Western, “The Great Train Robbery,” a 1903 silent short film written, produced and directed by a former Edison Studios cameraman Edwin S. Porter, was filmed in Milltown. Considered a milestone in filmmaking, it is preserved in the National Film Registry as being “culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.”\n\nFort Lee became the ideal filmmaking spot because of its diverse landscapes of waterfalls, hills, forests and farms, and the short ride from New York City made it a convenient location, Gorelick said. It was there in 1907 that Edison’s film company, Edison Studios, shot “Rescued from an Eagle’s Nest,” which featured D.W. Griffith — regarded as one of the most important filmmakers of his generation — in his first starring role as an actor.\n\nBut filmmakers’ love affair with the town was short-lived, Gorelick said. A mass exodus to California started around 1918, as abundant, cheap land and year-round sunshine and warmth lured filmmakers, he said.\n\nStill, it wasn’t all about the weather. There was a practical reason the West was calling: It was a way to escape Edison Studios’ patent and licensed equipment.\n\n“They decided to move to the West Coast, to the wilds of California, where nobody could reach them and they couldn’t be prosecuted for patent violations,” Gorelick said.\n\nFilming in New Jersey did not return for many years, with the shiny exception of the 1950s filming of “On the Waterfront” starring Marlon Brando, Gorelick said. The film, which won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Brando, focused on union violence and corruption among longshoremen on the waterfronts of Hoboken.\n\nBut, in the 1970s, the tide started to turn, and New Jersey once again began to appeal to filmmakers. The reasons were manifold. First, feature films became more cutting edge, and filmmakers wanted to film on location — not just on studio sets — which contained a certain level of artifice that differentiated them from the real world, Gorelick said.\n\nIn that vein, film directors such as Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and Paul Mazursky wanted to film in the real world to add a harder edge and a sense of authenticity and reality to their works, Gorelick added.\n\nAt the same time, then Gov. Brendan Byrne was looking to boost the economy during a time of recession and brought the film industry back to its birthplace, Gorelick said.\n\n“It was created with enthusiasm and cynicism in other quarters. It’s seemed very poetic, and pie in the sky. Nonetheless, the poets won,” he said.\n\nPlaywright Sidney Kingsley became the founding chairman of New Jersey’s Motion Picture and Television Development Commission in 1977, with the idea of luring filmmakers to the state.\n\nIt worked.\n\nFilming started to return to the state, with such notable films as the 1979 “The Amityville Horror” (Toms River) and “Voices” (Hoboken) as well as the 1982 musical comedy-drama “Annie” (Wilson Hall at Monmouth University was used as the exteriors of Oliver Warbucks’ mansion).\n\n“We went from zero to 60 practically overnight,” Gorelick said.\n\nFilming moved at a steady pace throughout the ‘80s and into the ‘90s, and at one point New Jersey was ranked No. 5 in the nation for feature film production by Variety Magazine, said Gorelick.\n\nBut at the beginning of the 21st century, a decline in filming began. This time it wasn’t the West that was calling, but Canada, which began offering lucrative incentives to filmmakers.\n\n“Canada was hijacking all of our business,” Gorelick said. “Studios and networks were going there regardless of whether locations were aesthetically correct.”\n\nThis time, the Garden State was fighting back. In 2006, the state began offering a 20% tax credit on production expenses incurred in the state, which was capped at $10 million annually. But the incentive program ran out of money and then Gov. Chris Christie did not renew the program, he said.\n\n“We basically had no incentives to offer,” Gorelick said.\n\nNow, the incentive is back. In 2018, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority approved a program that provides credits up to $75 million per fiscal year to film and television projects. There is a $10 million yearly cap per project/series. On Jan. 21, 2020, the incentive was extended until 2028.\n\nKnown as the Garden State Film and Digital Media Jobs Act, the program is designed to bring filming back to New Jersey in a big way and create jobs and economic stimuli, Gorelick said.\n\nThe incentive is a powerful tool to entice the film, TV and digital media outlets to film here, said Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.\n\n“The governor is really aggressively marketing it, meeting with studios in California and talking about why New Jersey is such a great place to film,” he said. “We have an extensive diversity of farms and horses, great urban settings, and no better view of the New York City skyline than New Jersey.”\n\nGorelick said that since the incentive was enacted last July, it has worked brilliantly.\n\n“We’ve been flooded,” he said.\n\nSince then, the state has shot “The Sopranos” prequel, “The Many Saints of Newark,” which filmed in Paterson. “The Enemy Within” TV series was shot at Bergen Community College and in the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford. The TV series, “Mercy” was filmed in Cranford, Jersey City, Newark, West Orange and other towns.\n\nA nod to New Jersey’s history as the film mecca is coming back to Fort Lee in October 2022 with the Barrymore Film Center, a 21,500-square-foot, 260-seat cinema, museum and movie archives building designed by architect Hugh Hardy.\n\nAnd in Jersey City, there are plans to convert a 135,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial area of the city into the largest film studio in the state.\n\nTom Hall, executive director of the Montclair Film Festival, said having films shot in your own background benefits film festivals.\n\n“When films are produced locally, they want to be screened locally,” he said. “That makes a big difference.”\n\nIt also creates a ripple effect in the economy.\n\nWhen big Hollywood studios with a tremendous budget decide to film, they hire locals, caterers, rent hotel rooms, rent equipment, go out for meals, rent props and much more, said Montclair location scout and manager Glenn Schuster.\n\n“It’s a real example of how that tax credit has paid off,” Schuster said.\n\nHe credits the tax break for luring Steven Spielberg to the state to film the “West Side Story” remake.\n\n“I have a feeling the state may not have gotten that film,” he said.\n\nRegardless, the state’s diverse landscapes – all within an hour’s drive – is hard to compete with.\n\n“There’s an amazing wealth of locations in New Jersey, many of them close to New York City, something a lot of filmmakers look for,” Schuster said. “I’ve been scouting for many years, and there’s a tremendous wealth of locations. You don’t have to drive more than an hour to see the mountains, beaches, lakes, mansions, run down shacks, inner city neighborhoods, country farms. Almost anything you can imagine can be found in the state.”"
