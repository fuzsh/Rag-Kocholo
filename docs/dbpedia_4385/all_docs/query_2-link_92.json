        "text": "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh's incoming interim leader Muhammad Yunus appealed for calm Wednesday and urged all parties to help the country rebuild after weeks of violence that killed hundreds and prompted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India.\n\nYunus, a Nobel peace laureate, was in Paris for the Olympics when he was named interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against a prime minister seen as increasingly autocratic. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home.\n\nHe congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made \"our second Victory Day possible,\" and appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning any violence since Hasina's resignation Monday.\n\n\"Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country,\" Yunus said.\n\nBangladesh's military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman said in a televised address that Yunus would be sworn in Thursday night and that he expected him to usher in a \"beautiful democratic\" process. The military leader said that those responsible for violence since Hasina's resignation would be brought to justice.\n\nYunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: \"I'm looking forward to going back home and seeing what's happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in.\"\n\nAsked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. \"I'll go and talk to them. I'm just fresh in this whole area.\"\n\nA tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case, involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case.\n\nAiling opposition leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia also urged calm on Wednesday, a day after the country's figurehead president ordered her release from house arrest.\n\nZia urged her supporters not to follow a path of destruction, in an address at a rally via video link from her hospital bed. It was her first public speech since 2018, when she was convicted of corruption charges and jailed.\n\n\"No destruction, no anger, and no revenge, we need love and peace to rebuild our country,\" she told members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\n\nZia's son and the acting head of the party, Tarique Rahman also addressed the crowd online from London, where he has been living in exile since 2008. Rahman faces several criminal cases and was convicted of corruption and a grenade attack, charges dismissed by supporters as politically motivated.\n\nOn Wednesday, the capital Dhaka was calm two days after violence gripped the country amid Hasina's sudden departure. Students activists cleaned streets and managed traffic in parts of Dhaka, after police went on strike earlier in the week following violent attacks on police stations.\n\nThe country's newly appointed police chief, Mainul Islam, ordered officers to return to work by Thursday evening.\n\nViolence in the days surrounding Hasina's resignation killed at least 109 people -- including 14 police officers, and left hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed. Reports said more attacks took place across the country also on Tuesday. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Andrea Rosa and Ahmed Hatem of The Associated Press."
