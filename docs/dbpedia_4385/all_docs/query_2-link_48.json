For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Movie Production Companies in the World.\n\nThe motion picture, movie, or film industry is one of the most lucrative sectors in the world as the star studded and glitzy sector is responsible for proving entertainment through a variety of mediums. Growth in technology and innovative delivery channels have also enabled production houses to have a global reach, as movies from one country are shown in picture houses all over the world.\n\nThis industry is also one of the largest of its kind and it is worth billions of dollars. Big budget films often require countless hours spent over their funding, but if the output is perfect, then they end up bringing back billions in grossing ticket sales. For example, the most successful film of all time, Avatar, has brought in a whopping $2.9 billion since 2009. The second biggest highest grossing movie, Avengers: Endgame, has raked in $2.8 billion in just three years.\n\nOverall, the movie production industry is also set to impressively grow over the next decade. A research report from The Business Research Company estimates that the global film and video industry grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4% between 2021 and 2022 to stand at $272 billion. From 2022 to 2026, it will grow at a 6.4% CAGR and sit at $355 billion by the end of the forecast period. Driving this growth will be the Internet and the growth in smartphone usage, as more users come online and access content platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney+ on their gadgets from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Film production is also helped by drones, and the fastest growing film market in the near term future will be Africa according to the research firm.\n\nAnother report, this time from Research and Markets, lumps the film and music industries together. It also estimates that the growth rate for this sector was 11.4% between 2021 and 2022, with the value being $352 billion as of July 2022. From the end of this year to 2026, the industry will grow at a somewhat similar CAGR of 10.2% and be worth $478 billion as 2026 ends. The industry growth is attributed to the proliferation of direct to home and internet protocol television services, alongside online platforms such as YouTube further providing viewers with more channels to access content and producers with a larger variety of distribution outlets.\n\nIn today's piece, we will narrow down the largest movie production companies in the world.
