        "text": "Atlanta Marriott Marquis\n\nThe John Portman-designed Atlanta Marriott Marquis is an icon in the Atlanta skyline. At the time of its building in 1985, it was the largest atrium in the world. It’s connected to Peachtree Center, offering MARTA access and is only a short walk from the city’s most famous attractions. In \"Mockingjay,\" the hotel’s interior and futuristic elevators serve as the tribute’s quarters.\n\nAtlanta University Center\n\nAtlanta's historic West End is home to the campuses of Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Spelman College and Morris Brown College, known collectively as the Atlanta University Center. \"Drumline,\" \"Stomp the Yard,\" \"We Are Marshall\" and \"Spike Lee's School Daze\" all feature these campuses prominently.\n\nCastleberry Hill\n\nThis City of Atlanta Landmark District is home to the area's oldest and most authentic warehouses and lofts. It was featured in the Emilio Estevez/Mick Jagger film \"Freejack,\" and was the location of Cuba Gooding's loft in \"The Fighting Temptations.\" Dan Aykroyd's office for \"Driving Miss Daisy\" was located in the Fulton Supply Warehouse. Some of the warehouse scenes in the Brad Pitt/Juliette Lewis thriller \"Kalifornia\" were also shot in the neighborhood. Scenes from 2007's \"The Signal\" also used Castleberry Hill as a backdrop.\n\nDruid Hills Neighborhood\n\n822 Lullwater Road in the historic Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta was Jessica Tandy's home in the film \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" The home is privately owned, but a drive down Lullwater, Springdale and Oakdale roads in Druid Hills will look very familiar to fans of the film.\n\nFado Irish Pub\n\nThis Buckhead pub is as close to Ireland as you can get without your passport. Fado has been a longtime neighborhood favorite, but their current location has a bar handcrafted in the motherland and shipped to Atlanta. Here you’ll find authentic pints of Guinness and dishes like fish and chips and shepherd’s pie. The bar was featured as a filming location in \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\nFox Theatre\n\nOne of the most beloved landmarks in the city, Atlanta's iconic Fox Theatre hosts more than 300 performances per year, from Broadway productions to movies to comedy to concerts. Over the decades, the spectacular 4,678-seat venue has hosted bands from Lynyrd Skynyrd to Leonard Cohen. No matter the event, the history and beauty of the \"Fabulous Fox\" Theatre make any visit a memorable one for all ages. It was ideal as a period theater in HBO's movie \"Bessie,\" starring Queen Latifah as Bessie Smith.\n\nGeorgia Aquarium\n\nThe world’s largest aquarium by water volume is located in none other than downtown Atlanta. Among the creatures that call it home are beluga whales, whale sharks, manta rays, penguins and sea otters. The Georgia Aquarium has been a location for a number of film and television projects, including \"The Last Song.\" In the scene, Will takes Ronnie to the aquarium, where she can see her favorite animals up close.\n\nGeorgia State Stadium\n\nCentered around a fictional scout for the Atlanta Braves, the Robert Lorenz-directed baseball film \"Trouble with the Curve\" has several key scenes at Georgia State Stadium, formerly Turner Field, home of the Braves. In 2017, the Braves played their first season in their new home, SunTrust Park.\n\nHome Grown Restaurant\n\nAlthough a relative newcomer to the Atlanta area, Home Grown kicks it old-school, retaining the '50s stools and counter and knotty pine walls original to its building. This classic diner look worked perfectly for \"Trouble with the Curve,\" in which Clint Eastwood plays a lifelong baseball man with little patience for fads, trends or excess.\n\nNorthside Tavern\n\nAtlanta's home of the blues, the legendary Northside Tavern, has been serving up hot blues and cold beer seven nights a week since 1972. It was voted #7 among the Top Ten Dive Bars in America. The website says the bar \"is a cross between Harpo's Juke Joint in 'The Color Purple' and the Mos Eisley Cantina in 'Star Wars.'\" The Wall of Fame, an idea started by blues musician and Northside regular Danny \"Mudcat\" Dudeck, features portraits of Southern blues pioneers painted by Drew Galloway, including Mr. Frank Edwards, Eddie Tigner and Barbecue Bob.\n\nPorsche Experience Center\n\nStart your engines! Porsche’s North American headquarters are in Atlanta, so they set up a visitor’s center that includes driving courses and exhibits on the company’s past, present and future. Porsche Experience Center visitors can test their skills on a track module and learn about the engineering behind the cars from Porsche drive coaches. It was even used as a filming location for \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\nSilver Skillet\n\nOpen since 1956, the diner-style restaurant has been serving breakfast and lunch to national celebrities, politicians, and, of course, local Georgia Tech students. The family-operated greasy spoon has been voted the best breakfast in Atlanta with dishes like skillet country ham and corned beef hash. The Silver Skillet has been featured in several film productions, including TLC’s music video for “Destiny,” \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,\" \"Anchorman 2\" and \"Remember the Titans.\" Notable names on the restaurant's wall of fame are Dennis Quaid, Clint Eastwood and Diane Sawyer.\n\nSwan House at The Atlanta History Center\n\nOnce home to the Inman family, the 1928 Swan House was designed by architect Philip Trammell Shutze. The home is on the campus of the Atlanta History Center, which also has an extensive museum on the city’s history, historic gardens and a farm. The Swan Coach House, formerly the garage and servant quarters, is now a beloved restaurant. The 19th season of \"The Amazing Race\" even finished here. \"Catching Fire\" and \"Mockingjay: Part 1\" both used the home’s interiors and exteriors as President Snow’s mansion.\n\nTabernacle\n\nThe personality-filled Tabernacle, located in the heart of downtown Atlanta near Centennial Olympic Park, the CNN Center and the Georgia Aquarium, originally opened in 1910 as the Broughton Tabernacle. After decades as a church, the building lay vacant until it was converted into a House of Blues during the 1996 Olympics. The building has served as a live music concert hall ever since with Live Nation, the world's largest live music company, currently operating it. It served as a film location in HBO's \"Bessie,\" starring Queen Latifah as Bessie Smith.\n\nThe Colonnade\n\nFew restaurants in Atlanta have been around as long as The Colonnade, which has fed locals and travelers Southern fare since 1927. The family-owned eatery serves dishes like fried chicken, local vegetables and desserts in a motor lodge-like setting. It’s been used for a handful of Hollywood productions, but in \"Identity Thief,\" it was used for the scene with the $8 a day per-diem.\n\nThe Georgian Terrace Hotel\n\nBuilt in 1911, The Georgian Terrace Hotel is the crown jewel of hotels in Atlanta, included in both the Historic Hotels of America and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Set on bustling Peachtree Street, the hotel features modern furnishings and amenities as well as Livingston Restaurant & Bar and Edgar’s Proof and Provision. But the hotel is best known for being home to the 1939 gala that followed the premiere of \"Gone With the Wind\" at the now demolished Loew’s Grand Theatre. It is the luxury hotel where Sandy and Diana stay in \"Identity Thief.\"\n\nThe Temple\n\nSite of the infamous 1958 Temple Bombing, this historic Atlanta synagogue is shown as Jessica Tandy's place of worship in \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" though in the film the bombing takes place in the late 1960s. In reality, the bombing was in retaliation for the outspoken civil rights activism of The Temple's senior rabbi, Jacob Rothschild.\n\nThe Varsity\n\nThe Varsity sits on the edge of the Georgia Tech campus and has been serving \"stadium food\" since 1928. It is the world's largest drive-in restaurant (not drive-through), and diners are still greeted at the counter with \"What'll ya have?\" Always ready for her close-up, The Varsity is easily recognizable circa 1971 in \"Remember the Titans.\"\n\nThe Westminster Schools\n\nThis Atlanta private school campus, particularly its football stadium, was used as a primary location for 2009's \"The Blind Side.\"\n\nDecatur\n\nAgnes Scott College\n\nThe picturesque campus of Agnes Scott College, a women's liberal arts college in Decatur, has played numerous roles in film and TV productions, including Alan Alda's \"The Four Seasons,\" \"Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius\" and as the main location for Wes Craven's \"Scream 2.\" Tyler Perry's \"Single Moms Club\" used the campus for a fictitious prep school. HBO's \"Confirmation\" used the campus for that of the University of Oklahoma, as well as various Senate hallways and chambers.\n\nDecatur Cemetery\n\nDecatur’s largest green space is a 58-acre cemetery containing headstones dating back to the early 1800s. Among the famous names buried here are politicians, authors, musicians and other notable residents from Decatur, DeKalb County and Georgia history. Visitors can explore on their own with a self-guided walking tour brochure as well as guided tours available seasonally. The city’s oldest cemetery was the setting for the opening and closing scenes of \"Remember the Titans.\"\n\nDunwoody\n\nPerimeter Mall\n\nAtlanta is a shopaholic's dream, with both independent boutiques and big-box brands. Perimeter Mall, located in Dunwoody, is the second largest mall in the Southeast. It boasts more than 200 specialty and department stores selling everything from designer fashion to tech gear to home decor and more. There are also countless dining options, including full-service restaurants and quick service chains. The hair salon in \"Identity Thief\" is in the mall.\n\nHampton\n\nAtlanta Motor Speedway\n\nNASCAR fans will know Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton as the site of huge races, including the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500, which is one of the state’s largest sporting events. The 1.54-mile track is one of the top facilities in the country. Tours operate daily, and track rides can also be booked. Many of the rural driving scenes in \"Identity Thief\" were filmed along Highway 20 near the track.\n\nJohns Creek\n\nOcee Park\n\nAs a newly unemployed baseball announcer in \"Parental Guidance,\" Billy Crystal takes great interest in his grandson's little league team, shown playing on fields at Ocee Park in Johns Creek.\n\nJonesboro\n\nThe Beach at International Park\n\nHome of the 1996 Olympic volleyball games, this Clayton County park is open year-round, but the beach is a summer hangout. It has a lake, children's pool, slides and beach volleyball courts. Also onsite are tennis courts, playgrounds, walking trails and picnic facilities. In \"Catching Fire,\" the Quarter Quell arena was filmed on the beach, complete with the cornucopia in the center.\n\nDowntown Jonesboro\n\nThe historic town of Jonesboro, located just south of the Atlanta metro area in Clayton County, doubled as Texarkana in the 1977 Burt Reynolds blockbuster \"Smokey and the Bandit.\" To see the town as it looked during filming, visit this site.\n\nKennesaw\n\nElectric Cowboy\n\nFormerly known as Cowboys, Electric Cowboy is where Ren, Ariel and the gang head to town for a little boot scootin' in director Craig Brewer's 2011 version of \"Footloose.\"\n\nLithia Springs\n\nSweetwater Creek State Park\n\nThe peaceful Sweetwater Creek State Park, only 15 miles from downtown Atlanta, boasts more than 2,549 acres. Set in Douglas County, it has hiking trails, a reservoir, yurts, picnic areas and the remains of the New Manchester Textile Mill, which was burned by Union troops in the Civil War. It has been in the backdrop of countless productions, including \"Mockingjay: Part 1.\" In the film, the characters Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) share a moment at the river here.\n\nSenoia\n\nDowntown Senoia\n\nThe small town of Senoia was incorporated in 1860, but it was the film industry that put it on the map. The main street is lined with shops and restaurants as well as historic homes and inns. Senoia has also been home to two of Southern Living’s Idea Houses. The street has stars to indicate various film and television productions that used the town as a backdrop or were filmed at nearby Raleigh Studios. Hang out long enough and you might just see filming of \"The Walking Dead,\" whose Alexandria set is a real neighborhood in town.\n\nStone Mountain\n\nStone Mountain Park\n\nStone Mountain is the world's largest piece of exposed granite, and it is the centerpiece of the 3,200-acre Stone Mountain Park. In the 2007 film \"Stomp the Yard,\" the crew runs up the mountain while training for the big dance competition. In the 1996 film \"Fled,\" Stephen Baldwin and Lawrence Fishburne fight in the skyride buckets while riding to the top of the mountain. The TV pilot for JJ Abrams' \"Revolution\" also filmed in the park, as has \"The Vampire Diaries\" and feature film \"The Killing Season.\"\n\nAthens\n\nDowntown Athens\n\nJust an hour from Atlanta, Athens is home to the University of Georgia. Brimming with great restaurants, great music and a vibe all its own, this city of roughly 100,000 was the setting for the Shawn Cassidy bicycling TV series \"Breaking Away,\" which had a seven-episode run in 1980-81. Among other projects, the UGA campus appears in the original \"Road Trip,\" \"Cobb\" and \"Trouble with the Curve.\" Most recently, the city provided the setting for acclaimed independent film \"The Spectacular Now.\"\n\nConyers\n\nDowntown Conyers\n\nThe historic town of Conyers is more than just quaint shops and local eateries, but it's the Main Street community that has become a popular backdrop for television and film. You can go on a self-guided tour of the filming locations of such hits as the original series \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" films like \"American Reunion\" and \"Identity Thief,\" as well as binge-worthy series like \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Stranger Things.\"\n\nGeorgia International Horse Park\n\nCreated for the equestrian events from the 1996 Centennial Olympics, the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers is a 1,400-acre multi-purpose sporting venue. A number of television and film projects have used the space, including \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Identity Thief.\"\n\nCovington\n\nDowntown Covington\n\nThe small town vibes of Covington have been used as a backdrop in countless television and film projects over the last few decades, including \"In the Heat of the Night,\" \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"My Cousin Vinny.\" But, of course, it’s \"The Vampire Diaries\" that the town is now most well-known for as it has been home to the production since 2009. Stop into the Mystic Grill for a bite to eat and a great view of the historic square while you're in town.\n\nWorthington Manor\n\nWorthington Manor (known as Lockwood Manor on \"The Vampire Diaries\") is a private residence, meaning it's okay to photograph from the street, but please don't trespass. Though \"The Vampire Diaries\" crew built most of \"Lockwood Manor\" on a soundstage, they still shoot at the actual home with some frequency. There are a couple of Vampire Diaries tour companies that specialize in many of the show's locations around Covington.\n\nCrawfordville\n\nDowntown Crawfordville\n\nLocated 90 miles east of Atlanta, Crawfordville retains the look of an early 1900s Southern town. More than 13 films have used Crawfordville as a location, including 2009's \"Get Low\" and 1994's \"The Neon Bible.\" Not only did \"Sweet Home Alabama\" feature main street in its street festival scene, local eatery Heavy's Bar-B-Que served as the country bar in the film.\n\nJackson\n\nHigh Falls State Park\n\nIn 1982's \"Six Pack,\" Kenny Rogers played Brewster Baker, a down-on-his-luck stock car racer who takes on six mechanically gifted orphans and finds his fortunes changing. The film shot in many Georgia locations, including High Falls State Park, Acworth, Atlanta, Buford, Hampton, Kennesaw, Stone Mountain and Sugar Hill.\n\nJuliette\n\nWhistle Stop Cafe\n\nJuliette, 10 miles off I-75 at Forsyth, is home to the original Whistle Stop Cafe and other locations featured in the classic Southern film \"Fried Green Tomatoes.\" The café is open daily from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nLincolnton\n\nClarks Hill Lake\n\nSet on the Georgia-South Carolina state line, 71,000-acre Clarks Hill Lake is a part of Elijah Clark State Park. Named for a state war hero, the park is popular with anglers and boaters. It has rental cottages and campgrounds to host visitors as well as a replica of the cabin where namesake Elijah Clark lived. The J. Strom Thurmond Dam on the lake has a recreation area that was used in \"The Hunger Games\" in a digitized shot of the train rides on the way to the Capitol.\n\nMacon\n\nLuther Williams Field\n\nBuilt in 1929, Luther Williams Field is the second oldest minor league baseball stadium in the country. It was recently featured in the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42,\" starring Harrison Ford and Chadwick Boseman.\n\nMadison\n\nDowntown Madison\n\nUnique in the state for its large number of restored antebellum homes, Madison retains the charm of the old South. It was the hometown of television's Bedford Family in the early 1990s series \"I'll Fly Away.\" Scenes from \"My Cousin Vinny\" and \"Road Trip\" were also filmed in Madison. The historic mansion Bonar Hall was FDR's hospital in HBO's \"Warm Springs.\" \"Goosebumps\" filmed several key scenes on the town's main streets.\n\nMonticello\n\nJasper County Courthouse\n\nYes, this is where the famous \"two yutes\" line was shot in Monticello as Joe Pesci defends his nephew in 1991's \"My Cousin Vinny.\"\n\nOxford\n\nOxford College of Emory University\n\nOxford College is a two-year residential college located on the original campus of Emory College (now Emory University) and part of the Emory system. Perhaps more importantly, however, it was the site of the General Lee's famous jump, seen weekly in the opening credits of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" from 1979 to 1985. For the release of the 2006 movie version, MTV came to Oxford to jump the original car from the series.\n\nPerry\n\nDowntown Perry\n\nUnlike the fictional Iowa town depicted in \"The Crazies\" that has a water system full of toxins, Perry, Georgia, where the film was largely shot, has a renovated downtown, great shops and restaurants, and all the clean water you can swallow.\n\nJekyll Island\n\nJekyll Island Club Resort\n\nA National Trust Historic Hotel of America, the Jekyll Island Club Resort dates to the late 19th century. After the 2000 film \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" was released, so many patrons stopped by to have a drink at the \"lobby bar,\" built and removed by the film company, that the hotel re-created it for patrons to enjoy.\n\nLumber City\n\nThe Ocmulgee River Bridge\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, steamboats had to pass under the Ocmulgee River Bridge on their way down the river. The through-truss bridge rotated at its center, allowing ships to pass thanks to an operator placed on the bridge. The bridge in Lumber City has been featured in the background of countless films, including \"Identity Thief,\" thanks to a partnership between Telfair, Wheeler and Jeff Davis counties.\n\nSavannah\n\nBonaventure Cemetery\n\nAcademy Award-winning lyricist Johnny Mercer; his uncle, Hugh W. Mercer, a Civil War Army officer and Confederate general; and novelist and poet Conrad Aiken are among the noteworthy individuals interred in Bonaventure Cemetery, made famous in the movie \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\" Located on a scenic bluff east of the Wilmington River, the cemetery was orignally established on Bonaventure Plantation in the late 1700s. The Visitors Center is open daily from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m., with walking tours offered every second Sunday.\n\nChippewa Square\n\nThe original bench Tom Hanks (as \"Forrest Gump\") rests on with his box of chocolates at the edge of Chippewa Square in Savannah now resides in the Savannah History Museum. But the square remains a popular destination for visitors, both film and history buffs. There is seating, and plenty of good shopping close by, so it's definitely worth a stop!\n\nLove's Seafood and Steaks\n\nSet on the Ogeechee River outside of downtown Savannah, Love's Seafood & Steaks offers a rustic atmosphere and the best and freshest seafood around. Local beer, steaks and desserts are also on the menu at this eatery that has been a coastal Georgia favorite for more than 60 years. The restaurant was used as the setting for the scene with Jenny’s performance at the truck stop in \"Forrest Gump.\"\n\nMercer Williams House Museum\n\nBased on the best-selling book, the 1996 Clint Eastwood-directed film \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" tells the story of the shooting of Danny Hansford by prominent Savannah resident John Williams in his home, Mercer House. Williams would go on to become the only person in the history of Georgia to be tried four times for the same crime. He was ultimately acquitted and died unexpectedly six months later. His sister acquired the house and has opened it to the public.\n\nSavannah History Museum\n\nThe original bench Tom Hanks (as \"Forrest Gump\") rests on with his box of chocolates at the edge of Chippewa Square in Savannah now resides in the Savannah History Museum. It is located within the Visitor Information Center inside the old Central of Georgia Railway passenger shed, a National Historic Landmark built in the mid-1800s.\n\nWormsloe State Historic Site\n\nThe majestic oak alley of Wormsloe State Historic Site is one of Savannah's most photographed locations, and upon visiting, you'll see why. Built by English settler Noble Jones, the tabby structure is the oldest standing structure in Savannah. While Jones was little more than a farmer, he went on to become a doctor, constable and defender of the Georgia coast from the Spanish. The property passed on to his descendants until the state took over ownership in 1973. Today, the state historic site has exhibits on colonial life and walking trails. It was featured in \"The Last Song\" as the character Will’s family home.\n\nTybee Island\n\nNorth Beach Grill\n\nSet between Tybee Island’s lighthouse and beach, this dockside eatery serves lunch and dinner featuring fresh local seafood. The North Beach Bar & Grill menu includes Caribbean influences in dishes like fish tacos, sandwiches, salads and burgers that are a hit with the whole family. It's also a popular spot for live music on weekends. In \"The Last Song,\" the two young loves run into each other while dining at this restaurant.\n\nTybee Island Pier\n\nThe pier at Tybee Island Beach is an icon in the community. Locals go fishing off the pier, and visitors enjoy the snack bar and people watching. The original pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1967, but the second Tybrisa pavilion has welcomed beachgoers since 1996 when it was rebuilt for the Olympics. In \"The Last Song,\" the pier can be seen in the background during the carnival and volleyball tournament scenes.\n\nValdosta\n\nWild Adventures Theme Park\n\nFor the film's penultimate scene, \"Zombieland\" featured Valdosta's Wild Adventures Theme Park as the location where the undead corner our heroes. The 170-acre theme park, water park and animal park all in one is full of family fun even if you're not into hunting zombies."
