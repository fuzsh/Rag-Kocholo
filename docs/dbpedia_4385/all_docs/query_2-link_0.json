        "text": "Background\n\nCapitol Films was a British film production and distribution company, founded in 1989. Since 2006, it was owned by David Bergstein, and the same year they bought TH!NKFilm. In early 2010, Bergstein was rejected and later, in October, the United States branch went bankrupt. The same year, creditors filed a bankruptcy proposal to take over and liquidate five companies formerly controlled by David Bergstein, including Capitol Films.\n\n1st Logo (July 24, 1992-February 24, 2006)\n\nVisuals: In a live-action environment, the screen pans down on a waving blue flag with a stylized lemon yellow temple on it (or, in some cases, purple and copper). The columns inside are replaced with \"CAPITOL\", and \"FILMS\" is stretched on the lower bar.\n\nTechnique: Live-action.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: Seen on Blink of an Eye, Radio Inside, Nirvana, Death and the Maiden, The Winter Guest, Beowulf (1999), A Kind of Hush, Ghost World, Me Without You, Sylvia, The Company and Elvis Has Left the Building. Also seen on international prints of Gosford Park and Jeepers Creepers (2001) (right before the Cinerenta and American Zoetrope logos). Albeit the logo was changed in 2004, it re-appared for a final time on Lucky Number Slevin.\n\n2nd Logo (October 15, 2004-June 20, 2008)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background, the logo starts with several vertical lines, colored yellow, pink and orange, moving around. Then they form the hot pink word \"CAPITOL\", zooming out. The word is set in perspective, standing right with a thick shadow behind.\n\nVariants:\n\nThere was a closing variant, which had the text \"International Sales by Capitol Films\".\n\nDepending on the film, the text may be magenta or purple.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A lush string piece with chimes and pianos. Sometimes, it's silent."
