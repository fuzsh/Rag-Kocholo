But when it all goes fatally wrong, greed and revenge leave no-one unscathed. Other key cast members include Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei. Lumet’s US film is being produced by Michael Cerenzie, Brian Linse and William S. Gilmore.\n\nIn A Dream of Red Mansions, set to start shooting this autumn in Taiwan and in the UK, Australian-born Beresford will bring to the big screen an epic story of love and courage set against the background of the Chinese cultural revolution. The film is being produced in the UK by Julia Palau (Tusk Productions), with US producer Michele Berk (Lotus Pictures) and Anna Chi.\n\nCapitol Films will have a promo reel ready in Toronto for Dahl’s new film You Kill Me, starring Ben Kingsley, Tea Leoni, Luke Wilson and Bill Pullman. The US filmmaker, who is keeping the film noir genre alive, is back with the story of an alcoholic hit man trying to turn his life around. He gets a job in a mortuary and meets a woman who is a relative of one his hits. The US/Canadian film is currently in post-production."
