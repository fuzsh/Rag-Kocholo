        "text": "LOS ANGELES, March 7 — The journey of Henry Winterstern is a classic Hollywood tale: of this town’s irresistible lure, the particular hunger it breeds and the hubris that so often leads to a sudden demise. But this rapid rise and fall came with some trendy hedge-fund trimmings.\n\nA gravel-voiced, Canadian-born investor with a flair for turning around ailing companies, Mr. Winterstern arrived two years ago, aiming to remake a tiny distributor, First Look Pictures, into a full-service independent studio that would rival the likes of Lionsgate. Backed by millions from a New York hedge fund and a blue-chip Wall Street investment bank, much like a new crop of other Hollywood ventures, he wasted little time building his mini-empire. He hired some well-known executives, and put into production or bought about a dozen films, including “The Dead Girl” with Toni Collette and Giovanni Ribisi, and this year moved his bulked-up staff of 140 to baronial new offices in Century City.\n\nBy last Friday he was gone, done in by a disastrous 2006 at the box office and a taste for spending, with little cash flow to show for it.\n\nWhile neither First Look Studios nor Prentice Capital Management, the hedge fund that backed him, gave a reason for Mr. Winterstern’s resignation, the studio’s board issued a statement this week thanking him for his efforts. “First Look Studios is poised to become a major independent in the marketplace,” read the statement. “Henry provided this company with a foundation on which to do that.”\n\nMr. Winterstern said on Wednesday that the decision to resign was his own after the board rejected his bid to buy a production company, Nu Image/Millennium Films. “There was a divergence of opinion,” he said. “I wanted to build the company and make it larger, and the board wasn’t interested in going that way.”\n\nThe 49-year-old Mr. Winterstern, who has the craggy looks and hunched-over affect of a street fighter, never claimed to have much movie experience. But convinced that distribution was the place to make money, he planned to build a studio using his talents at raising money and strategic thinking that were successful in his turnaround of the Wet Seal, a maker of clothing for teenagers, in collaboration with Prentice Capital earlier this decade.\n\nPrentice Capital invested $70 million with Mr. Winterstern to build the studio, in tandem with a credit line of $80 million from Merrill Lynch. Mr. Winterstern merged First Look Pictures, an indie distributor, with his own Capital Entertainment Group in 2005. (He remains its largest individual shareholder.) He gave the rechristened First Look Studios a rousing mission statement, saying in part: “First Look is a maverick. We are primarily accountable to ourselves. We want an audience looking at films from First Look to know — as Howard Hawks once said — just who made the picture.”\n\nMr. Winterstern hired industry veterans like Ruth Vitale, the former Fine Line and Paramount Classics executive, as president of First Look Pictures, and Stuart Ford, a former Miramax executive, to run the international distribution arm. And he quickly began to spend. In addition to expanding the company to several divisions — television, international, home entertainment — Mr. Winterstern acquired the video production and distribution arm of Blockbuster, DEJ Productions, for $25 million, and the video distributor Ventura Distribution for about $20 million, along with television syndication packages from Pinnacle Entertainment. He then started making movies in order to fill the distribution pipeline.\n\nAt Sundance this year and last Mr. Winterstern was a presence, leaping into the bidding wars. “He was there when we were negotiating all night,” said Celine Rattray, a producer of “Dedication,” a romantic comedy starring Billy Crudup and Mandy Moore, which sold in January for $3.5 million to First Look and the Weinstein Company.\n\nBut Mr. Winterstern’s first movie choices didn’t register with the public. Despite some good reviews, “The Dead Girl,” about a mysterious corpse, took in a paltry $19,000. “Wassup Rockers,” about a group of skater boys, written and directed by Larry Clark (“Kids”), took in just $620,000. The box office returns didn’t deter First Look from moving into the gleaming new building that was erected as headquarters for the Creative Artists Agency. Furnished at a cost of $4 million, the headquarters are “excellent, really fantastic, but you kind of go, ‘Wait, this isn’t Paramount, where you’re expecting to do a $70 million movie,’ ” said Gavin Polone, a producer who had meetings there recently and admired the cavernous entryway and zebra-stripe woodwork.\n\n“They’re an independent, and they’ll come back and say, ‘Make it for less.’ And we’ll say, ‘The amount less you want us to spend to make the movie is what you spent on the receptionist station,’ ” he added.\n\nSenior executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, said the company had $50 million in losses last year. Mr. Winterstern said the loss was not nearly that high but declined to be more specific.\n\nThe final straw, according to two senior executives, came in recent weeks, when, after persuading Prentice to give First Look an $8 million short-term loan in January, it became clear that First Look would be unable to repay it in April, as expected. (Mr. Winterstern said the company would have had the cash to repay the loan, but wanted to buy Nu Image/Millennium. “I had a growth-platform vision, and that required more capital,” he said.) Last Thursday he faced the board in New York. He resigned the following day.\n\nThe sudden change at First Look has created anxiety among producers of the seven films the studio plans to release this year, including “King of California,” starring Michael Douglas as a manic-depressive who believes there’s buried treasure in the San Fernando Valley. “Obviously we’re concerned about that,” said Michael London, one of the film’s producers, who added that he had received reassuring calls from Ms. Vitale. Michael Zimmerman, the chief executive of Prentice Capital, has told the First Look staff that the company will not fold. But it remains unclear who will lead it.\n\nUp next is an animated adult comedy, “Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters,” based on the cult television series. Others include “An American Crime,” starring Catherine Keener as a mother of seven who imprisons a teenager in her basement; and “Smiley Face,” a comedy by the director Gregg Araki (“Mysterious Skin”), about the misadventures of a pot-smoking actress.\n\nMr. Winterstern is not the only comer who has found Hollywood an easy place to enter but a hard place to survive. Philippe Martinez came to Hollywood two years ago backed by capital from London, and has had disastrous results with films like “National Lampoon’s Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj,” and has sparred with producers over money. Mr. Martinez recently downsized radically, and left his Century City offices to work out of a small space in Beverly Hills.\n\nBut Mr. Winterstern’s Hollywood adventure was shorter than most. “It was so quick,” said Ms. Rattray, the producer. “He burst onto the scene — he was so aggressive, and then gone so quickly.” And First Look may not have heard the last of Mr. Winterstern. Asked about a rumor that he might attempt to reacquire the studio, the deposed mogul laughed and said, “Absolutely not.” Then he called back to say, “It’s possible.”"
