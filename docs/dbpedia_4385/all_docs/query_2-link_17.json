        "text": "The FMC/NACG is the first artist-run organization devoted to the dissemination of moving image art. Artists and estates maintain creative control of their works as we are a non-contractual, non-exclusive, membership based, non-profit group.\n\nThe FMC/NACG is a research center for film scholars and media makers and a digitzation and preservation center for all formats of moving image art. Our collection is accessible via our screening room and digital streaming. We also foster the production of new art work via sponsorships and residencies.\n\nThe FMC/NACG's extensive archive is readily accessible to international art and cultural institutions who value the collection as a vital resource. Intrinsic to our policy of non-exclusivity is our mission to provide visibility for works of art from all cultural, gender, and ethnic backgrounds.\n\nThe FMC/NACG distributes, archives, and promotes non-commercial artists' cinema and maintains a film and paper archive accessible to researchers to promote the collection through a searchable web catalogue and screenings.\n\nWe have published Sarah Markgraf’s book I Was a Flawed Modernist on filmmaker Paul Sharits. With MIAP, we received a NFPF grant to preserve Stan Vanderbeek’s early pioneering computer graphics.\n\nThe FMC/NACG uses the digital streaming service FANDOR for online distribution of select works in our collection. We participate in panel discussions at media festivals and universities in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe FMC/NACG also conducts an annual public screening of new works in our collection called “New Year, New Work”. We have developed various programs with exhibition venues, such as The Victoria and Albert Museum, Fondazione Prada, Centre Pompidou, Anthology Film Archives, Howl!, MoMA, and MoMI. Furthermore, we offer affordable media workshops.\n\nThe FMC/NACG is partially funded through support from the New York Council of the Arts.\n\n1961\n\nThe New American Cinema Group, Inc. (NACG) was founded on July 14, 1961, as a membership cooperation by a group of 22 New York artists, including Jonas Mekas, Shirley Clarke, Ken and Flo Jacobs, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith. The Film-Makers’ Cooperative is a division of the NACG and continues to be its operational name.\n\nFor the first two decades, the NACG operated as a for-profit membership distribution center.\n\n1981\n\nIn 1981, under the leadership of Marjorie Keller, the NACG expanded its mission to include educational, artistic, and literary activities (e.g. film screenings, workshops, seminars, book publications). In addition to analog film, the NACG now also distributed video and digital media.\n\n1991\n\nThe FMC/NACG's Board of Directors, including Larry Gottheim, Vincent Grenier, Dave Gearey, Paul Arthur, and MM Serra, hosted a Benefit Art Auction at The Gallery THREE ZERO with over 102 art works. This benefit began yearly art auctions to fund preservation projects and other expenses.\n\n1993\n\nExecutive Director MM Serra was finally granted non-profit status for the NACG. With this new standing, the NACG began archiving and preserving older film and video work for the benefit of future prosperity.\n\n2000s\n\nIn the 2000s, Board members began an effort to expand our digital collection. Former Board c/o President Gregg Biermann introduced the NACG’s ongoing effort to digitize the vast collection, consisting of more than 5,000 films by over 1,000 media makers.\n\nAmong the artists in the collection are Maya Deren, Marie Menken, Jonas Mekas, Michael Snow, Carolee Schneemann, Peggy Ahwesh, Stan Brakhage, and Ken and Flo Jacobs.\n\nRead the original history written by one of our founders, Jonas Mekas.\n\n2023\n\nOn January 31st, 2023, the Film-Makers’ Cooperative/New American Cinema Group announced that MM Serra would be transitioning from her role as Executive Director after over thirty years of dedicated service to the organization. For thirty years, MM Serra brought life to the Film-Makers’ Cooperative. She oversaw the Cooperative’s certification as a nonprofit organization in 1993 and brought it into the digital age, working tirelessly to highlight the legacies of historically overlooked filmmakers.\n\nSerra was instrumental in the restoration of countless films, including the works of Edward Owens, Maya Deren, Storm De Hirsch, Cathy Cook, and multiple collaborations with the Stan VanDerBeek Estate. She successfully guided the Cooperative through four relocations and countless changes over the years. Without MM Serra, the Film-Makers’ Cooperative would not exist as it does today.\n\n***\n\nOn May 26th, 2023, the Film-Makers’ Cooperative announced the organization’s new Executive Director, Dr. Tom Day.\n\nTom joins The Coop from the academic sector, having spent the last six years teaching and researching in the fields of art history and film studies at The University of Edinburgh and The Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London. While at The Courtauld, Tom helped to run The Centre for American Art, a field-leading scholarly center, where he programmed lectures, symposia, workshops, screenings, and artists’ events.\n\nAs part of Tom’s strategic plan for The Coop, he will aim revive the scholar-in-residence program to encourage and support academic research into the collection. Tom will also seek to implement focused education and programming initiatives with the ultimate aim of funding a teaching fellowship and a set of curatorial fellowships at The Coop that will support pedagogical programmes and a roster of screenings and publications. An expansion of community-oriented workshops for artists and filmmakers will also be a key priority. One of the central ambitions of Tom’s tenure will be to further assist The Coop in the preservation, digitization, and storage of its world-leading collection of experimental film and video artworks through a rigorous grant-getting program, as well as through collaborations with institutional partners within and beyond New York City.\n\nis Assistant Professor of English in Film and Media Studies at Amherst College. His research focuses on histories and theories of experimental cinema, with an emphasis on the postwar American avant-garde. Essays of his have appeared in such publications as Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in Los Angeles, 1945-1980 (John Libbey, 2015); The Global Sixties in Sound and Vision: Media, Counterculture, Revolt (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014); and the online journals Flow and World Records (forthcoming 2020). Since 2009, he has pursued curating as a manifestation of research, as well as a mode of cultural production. Film and video programs that he has curated or compiled have screened at venues such as Anthology Film Archives, Microscope Gallery, Balagan, University of Toronto, Magic Lantern Cinema, Le Petit Versailles, A.P.E. Gallery, and Pacific Film Archive. In 2019, he co-curated, with Toby Lee, an event series on world-making and documentary media produced in conjunction with World Records journal, with events occurring at UnionDocs: Center for Documentary Art and the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. He also makes films, working on 16mm. His short film, Rock Roll (2015), screened at such venues as Ann Arbor Film Festival, Light Field, Onion City Film and Video Festival, and A Good Night's Sleep. His dual-projection film, Circumambulations (2018), co-created with Andrew Ranville, has screened at Microscope Gallery, Lausanne Underground Film and Music Festival, Revolutions Per Minute Festival, and the Film-Makers' Cooperative. He serves as an editor of Millennium Film Journal and a member of the International Advisory Committee for Archive/Counter-Archive.\n\nLynne Sachs makes films, installations, performances, and web projects that explore the intricate relationship between personal observations and broader historical experiences by weaving together poetry, collage, painting, politics, and layered sound design. Strongly committed to a dialogue between cinematic theory and practice, she searches for a rigorous play between image and sound, pushing the visual and aural textures in her work with every new project. Between 1994 and 2006, she produced five essay films that took her to Vietnam, Bosnia, Israel, Italy, and Germany — sites affected by international war – where she looked at the space between a community’s collective memory and her own subjective perceptions.\n\nRecently, after 25 years of making experimental documentaries, Sachs learned something that turned her filmmaking upside down. While working on Your Day is My Night (2013) in NYC’s Chinatown, she realized that her subjects were performing for the camera rather than revealing something completely candid about their lives. The process of recording guaranteed that some aspect of the project would be artificial. This moved Sachs toward a new type of filmmaking — she invited her subjects to become her collaborators — to work with her to make the film about their lives. This new way of “working with reality” has inspired Sachs to present Your Day is My Night (2013) as well as Every Fold Matters (2016) as live film performances in alternative venues around New York City, including homeless shelters, labor union headquarters, and laundromats, as well as small, non-commercial theaters. In 2017, she completed her newest experimental documentary, Tip of My Tongue, which was supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Creative Arts and premiered as the closing night film in the Museum of Modern Art’s Documentary Fortnight.\n\nSachs has made over 25 films. Her work has screened at the New York Film Festival, the Sundance Film Festival, and Toronto’s Images Festival, amongst others. They have also been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, Walker Art Center, Wexner Center for the Arts, and other venues nationally and internationally. The Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, Festival International Nuevo Cine in Havana and the China Women’s Film Festival have all presented retrospectives of Sachs’ films.\n\nSince 2006, Sachs has collaborated with her partner, filmmaker Mark Street, in a series of playful, mixed-media performances called “The XY Chromosome Project”. Lynne holds an MFA in Film from the San Francisco Art Institute, an MA in Cinema from San Francisco State University, and a BA in History from Brown University. She has taught at New York University, Princeton, Hunter College, The New School, and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nwww.lynnesachs.com\n\nTOM DAY\n\nExecutive Director\n\nEmail: tom@film-makerscoop.com.\n\nTom joins The Coop from the academic sector, having spent the last six years teaching and researching in the fields of art history and film studies at The University of Edinburgh and The Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London.
