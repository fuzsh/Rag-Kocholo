        "text": "\"Football is to Texas what religion is to a priest\".\n\nSo spoke Tom Landry - one of the winningest coaches in NFL history who led the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl wins and 6 additional appearances - summing up Texas' relationship to football as succinctly as any could ever hope.\n\nIf you've ever spent any significant time in Texas, the sentiment almost goes without saying. As Texans, our relationship to the sport is on display in every corner of the state: you can see it in the towering arenas that would make the Romans weep, erected in every metroplex to set the stage for young men with huge dreams; you can see it in nearly any small town on a Friday night, plastered on every storefront in big, bold letters that read \"GONE TO THE GAME\"; and you can certainly see it on the screen, where generations of filmmakers have immortalized the Texan fascination with the sport, wringing the whole spectrum of emotion from the experiences of those men and women who choose to make it a part of their lives.\n\nSo join us, as we catch up with some of Texas' most enduring players, teams, fields and more!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nIt should come as no surprise that music - on-screen and off - is a fundamental component of Texas culture. What more could you expect from a state that claims the \"Live Music Capital of the World\" as it's state capital?\n\nWith that in mind, we've compiled a list of some of the most notable examples of music on the screen to come out of Texas from the past fifty-four years. From outlaw country to underground hip hop, new wave punk to R&B, Tejano jams to heartbreaking blues licks - we've got it all!\n\nSo, follow along as we guide you through the steps of our very own 'Texas Two-step'. It may feel a little different from the dance you know, but we promise once you get into the rhythm, you'll love every second of it!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nTexas' greatest resource for film and television productions has long been the breadth and diversity of our natural resources and that means that over the past century a lot of different kinds of stories have been told here. That includes an abundance of horror and thriller movies, ranging from edge-of-your-seat stress tests, to controversial, genre-defining nightmares, to some of the most confounding and bizarre stories you'll ever see.\n\nHere, we’ve pulled together a collection of spooks, scares, frights, and excites that span the whole of the state, from the West Texas outpost of El Paso all the way to far side of the Pine Curtain in Texarkana. Some changed the way we view horror and thrillers altogether; others are cult classics, indelible pieces of Texas film history. Still, others fall somewhere in between, defying easy categorization. One thing is for sure though, and that’s that each and every one of these films would fit nicely into any discerning fan’s Halloween marathon.\n\nSo take a chance and dive into our Thrills and Chills Film Trail – we promise you won’t get too spooked!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nFrom the Rio Grande Valley, all the way up to the Panhandle and everywhere in between, Drive-In Theaters are a foundational element of the Texas film landscape and have been for some time – dating all the way back to 1934, when the third drive-in theater in America (and the first in Texas) opened in Galveston. At the height of their popularity, Texas laid claim to more drive-ins than any other state in the country.\n\nToday, the cinematic experience no longer resembles that of 1934. Multiplex theaters and streaming services have changed the way we watch movies, but the drive-in theaters that remain have stood the test of time and come out better than ever. So hop in the car and join us as we take a journey to some of Texas' premier drive-in theaters, from established classics to brand new innovators!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nTexas communities far and wide have been the setting for the Western film genre as far back as The Sundowners to present-day TV series like AMC's The Son. The history of Texas Westerns shows how the genre itself has evolved, as well as the communities that have hosted these iconic productions. Whether its popular attractions like the Texas State Railroad or modern communities like Gonzales, there is no denying the Texas landscape as the perfect backdrop for any western. Take your cowboy hat and become an outlaw on the Texas Westerns Film Trail: a journey through the Wild West of Texas productions!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nAMC's TV series Fear the Walking Dead, a spin-off of The Walking Dead, follows a family of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. Season 4 brings the survivors to Texas, where they must continue to survive the Infected \"walkers,\" plus a new group of strangers they meet along the way.\n\nProduction relocated to the Lone Star State for Season 4, utilizing a number of existing locations that were transformed into abandoned spaces for the post-apocalyptic setting. From a state-of-the-art baseball stadium in Round Rock to a popular water park just outside of the Austin metroplex, there is no shortage of exciting locations that fans have seen on their TV screens. So take the journey across Central Texas, but use caution - you never know when a zombie is just around the corner!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nFrom the Southfork Ranch of the TV series Dallas to the vast countryside of Marfa in Giant, the Lone Star State has been memorialized in distinguished film projects for decades. The history of these productions displays the wide range and diversity of locations within the state, as well as the dedication of Texas talent and crew to projects that are remembered well after their release.\n\nSo take a trip down memory lane with the Texas Classics Film Trail, highlighting 25 filming destinations from some of our most iconic projects. Enjoy and experience the Texas film history from across the Lone Star State - you just might find something that's been in front of you the whole time!\n\nEmbark on the trail now!\n\nRichard Linklater has showcased his home state of Texas as the rich backdrop and source of inspiration for the films he has written, directed, and produced. His storytelling takes audiences all across Texas, from incredible vistas of the Greater Big Bend region, to the celebrated landmarks and cultural institutions of Central Texas, all the way to the charming small towns of the East Texas Piney Woods. In recognition of Linklater's immense talent and commitment to the state, we inaugurate the Texas Film Trails program with the Richard Linklater Texas Film Trail, highlighting 15 filming destinations from some of his most iconic features. We hope you enjoy your experience in the great state of Texas through the lens of the acclaimed filmmaker, Richard Linklater!"
