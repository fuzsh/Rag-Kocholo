Capitol Films will finance and handle worldwide sales on “The Best Time of Our Lives,” starring Keira Knightley and Lindsay Lohan.

Shooting’s set to start in the spring in Wales. Capitol’s introducing the project to distributors at the American Film Market.

“Lives” will be helmed by John Maybury and produced by Rebekah Gilbertson and Sarah Radclyffe.

Script by Sharman Macdonald, Knightley’s mother, is based on the relationships among Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, his wife Caitlin (Lohan), his childhood friend Vera Phillips (Knightley) and her eventual husband, William Killick (Daily Variety, Oct. 31). Casting’s under way for the role of Dylan Thomas.

Capitol announced last month that it was financing and selling worldwide “Blackout,” a serial-killer thriller from Mexican director Rigoberto Castenada; Amber Tamblyn and Aidan Gillen star. Valerio Morabito and Simon O’Leary are producing from a screenplay by Ed Dougherty, based on the Italian novel “Blackout” by Gianluca Morozzi.

U.K.-based Capitol was acquired earlier this year by David Bergstein’s media holding company Capco. During the past week, Capco has purchased indie distributor ThinkFilm and announced a three-year production-financing joint venture with Vincent Newman Entertainment with a $270 million revolving production fund.
