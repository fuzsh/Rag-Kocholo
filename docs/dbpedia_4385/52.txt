London-based Capitol Films announced yesterday that they will be handling international sales on Bruce Beresford’s new film A Dream of Red Mansions, starring Kate Hudson (Skeleton Key) and Ken Watanabe (Memoirs of a Geisha).

Inspired by a true story, the film, scripted by Donald Martin, is an epic story of love and courage set during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. When American photojournalist Diana Mellors travels to war-torn China in 1949, she is catapulted into a new, Communist world just as Mao Tse Tung takes control of the nation and declares the People's Republic of China. Diana meets the idealistic Li Yung and they are swept up in a passionate love affair.

The film, which will start shooting in Taiwan and the UK next October, is being produced by Michele Berk of Lotus Pictures (Bandits), Julia Palau of Tusk Productions (Keeping Mum ) and Anna Chi. Industry legend Alan Ladd Jr. (Braveheart) will executive produce with Matthew Payne.

Commenting on the film, Jane Barclay, co-managing director of Capitol Films said: “This is a magnificent story set during a fascinating period of recent history, in the capable hands of director Bruce Beresford and cast Kate Hudson and Ken Watanabe. We at Capitol believe that this will be first rate entertainment of the highest calibre.” Toshiba Entertainment has already pre-bought the film for Japan.

Other titles offered by Capitol Films at Cannes include the Irish horror film Shrooms by Paddy Breathnach and UK drama The Restraints of Beasts by Pawel Pawlikowski, both in pre-production.
