        "text": "The Perth Wildcats are one win away from securing a record seventh NBL Championship after beating the New Zealand Breakers 82-76 in game one of the grand final series at Perth Arena on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Wildcats led by 13 points early in the second quarter, but the Breakers launched a comeback to hit the front late in the third.\n\nThe critical play of the match came with just 90 seconds remaining, when Wildcats captain Damian Martin forced a time violation against New Zealand by pinning Cedric Jackson in his own defensive half.\n\nMartin unleashed a deft hook shot from the next play to extend the margin to a match-winning five points, with the Wildcats holding on for victory.\n\nThe only concern for Perth was a late leg injury to Casey Prather, who continued on but looked hampered.\n\nPrather scored just 11 points in a subdued display, while fellow import Jermaine Beal (seven points) also struggled.\n\nWildcats centre Nate Jawai was a force in the first half on the way to a 15-point haul, while Matt Knight (14) was also crucial.\n\nCorey Webster scored a team-high 19 points for the Breakers and Cedric Jackson chipped in with 14.\n\nNo second chance for New Zealand\n\nThe Breakers have won four of the past five NBL titles.\n\nBut they will need to win game two in Auckland on Friday night to keep this series alive.\n\nBreakers coach Dean Vickerman was forced to bench Alex Pledger for most of the opening term after the centre picked up two fouls within the first 90 seconds.\n\nPledger's absence allowed Wildcats big men Matt Knight and Jawai to dominate.\n\nKnight had eight points to his name within five minutes, while Jawai also produced some crucial plays to give the Wildcats a 24-14 lead by quarter time.\n\nJawai's dominance grew in the second term, with the Wildcats big man near unstoppable in the paint.\n\nThe fringe Boomer nailed nine points for the term, but the Breakers clawed their way back into the contest after Webster finally found his range.\n\nNew Zealand's grand final maestro Jackson also struggled to exert his usual influence, with a scoreless second term seeing him go to the long break with just seven points.\n\nThe third quarter was dominated by the whistle, and some of the calls were controversial.\n\nWildcats coach Trevor Gleeson was left fuming when Prather picked up his third and fourth fouls via charge calls.\n\nAnd Breakers players felt aggrieved at a series of calls that went against them.\n\nNew Zealand briefly hit the lead late in the third term, but the Wildcats kept their cool in a frenetic final quarter."
