        "text": "The Sydney Kings have been forced to abdicate the throne after the two-time defending NBL champions were stunningly bundled out of the post-season by the Breakers who avenged last year’s finals defeat with a shock 83-76 win on the road.\n\nThe visitors were brilliantly led by pocket rocket Parker Jackson-Cartwright who showed why he finished third in MVP voting as he dropped a game-high 34 points to go with six assists as the visitors dominated the fourth quarter at Qudos Bank Arena.\n\nMATCH CENTRE: Sydney Kings vs New Zealand Breakers stats and more\n\nNBA legends Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant were in the house to watch what many thought was going to be a comfortable win for the Kings, but any hopes of a three-peat evaporated in the fourth quarter as the Breakers exploded with three triples to break the 60-all deadlock.\n\nWednesday night’s result will heap more pressure on rookie Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah who still has one more year to run on his deal but will face heavy scrutiny after the champs were eliminated in the play-in qualifier.\n\nWatch every game of the NBL Finals LIVE with ESPN on Kayo Sports.

Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nIt ends a rough season for the Kings who only snuck into the post-season courtesy of a thumping win over the undermanned Phoenix, with the squad failing to live up to the lofty standards they set in previous years.\n\nFormer MVP Jaylen Adams got off to a hot start with nine points in the first quarter, but he was well contained after that as the hosts blew a double-digit lead on the back of an unacceptable 19 turnovers and a stack of empty possessions.\n\nHEARTBREAKERS\n\nJackson-Cartwright may have been the smallest player on the court but he had the biggest impact on the game as he put the Breakers on his back with a string of clutch shots.\n\nThe American import had 17 points in the first half and saved his best until the end with a dagger three to put his side up by seven in the final minute.\n\nThe result sets up a showdown with the Hawks on Monday night, with the Breakers sweating on the fitness of a couple of key men with Zylan Cheatham (18 points) coming off just before half-time with a lower-leg injury but able to return, while Will McDowell-White bravely played through a badly damaged shoulder.\n\nHOT AND SPICY\n\nIt’s been a brutal summer in Sydney, and the heat snuck onto the court with plenty of niggle between last year’s finalists which threatened to spill over a few times.\n\nJordan Hunter was involved in most of the scraps, with the Kings big man bundled over by young gun Mantas Rubstavicius who fouled out just four minutes into the second half when he picked up two whistles in the space of eight seconds.\n\nPLAY-IN PREVIEW: Key finals storylines and what you need to know\n\nEarlier a dominant display from Will Magnay and Jack McVeigh guided the Tasmania JackJumpers into the semi-finals for a third straight year as they overcame the Illawarra Hawks 92-76 in the Seeding Qualifier at MyState Bank Arena in Hobart.\n\nThe JackJumpers now face the Perth Wildcats in a best-of-three semi-final series after their aggressive performance against the Hawks continued their streak of making the final four each year since they entered the NBL.\n\nBig men Magnay and McVeigh monstered the Hawks in the paint with a physical start inspiring the JackJumpers to an 18 to 2 run in the first quarter which set up the victory.\n\nMagnay came off the bench with a career-high 25 points along with 10 rebounds and four blocks after starting centre Marcus Lee injured his left shoulder going for the opening rebound of the game.\n\nMATCH CENTRE: Tasmania JackJumpers vs Illawarra Hawks stats and more\n\nThe former New Orleans Pelican played 30 minutes in a match for the first time this season and his intimidating presence drew high praise from JackJumpers coach Scott Roth.\n\n“He’s a big old beast,” Roth said.\n\n“Him and McVeigh were spectacular. On point, doing the right things.\n\n“It’s a great credit to him and our staff to come back from the injuries he’s had. His game is quite simple: protect the rim, roll to the rim and be physical. His presence under the rim is undeniable.”\n\nThe commentators called for Magnay to be included in future Boomers squads and suggested an NBA return may be on the horizon, but the 25-year-old insisted that he is “not back yet” as he continues to put in the work to be able to play more minutes.\n\nPower forward McVeigh led the way with 26 points and his physicality was also a feature of the contest as he reeled in 11 rebounds of his own.\n\nThe All-NBL second team member did not always get it right however as he gave away an unsportsmanlike foul in the third term for deliberately falling on Hawks rookie centre Lachlan Olbrich after receiving a stray elbow to the face while fighting for a rebound.\n\nThe JackJumpers fans were deafening when Olbrich missed all four resulting free throws as the home crowd injected themselves into the game on a night where the NBL registered its one millionth fan through the gates for the season.\n\nTasmania’s imports Jordan Crawford and Milton Doyle were also instrumental as Crawford contributed 20 points, while Doyle dished out ten assists.\n\nFor the Hawks, import Gary Clark produced a strong showing with 21 points and 10 rebounds."
