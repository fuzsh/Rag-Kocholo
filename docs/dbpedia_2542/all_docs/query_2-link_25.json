        "text": "Oakland Arena is a historic multi-purpose indoor venue built in 1966 and is a Northern California leader in live entertainment, playing host to many events per year, from concerts to family shows to sporting events. The Arena hosted the NBA’s Golden State Warriors from 1971 to 2019, as well as other pro teams, including the NHL’s California Golden Seals from 1967 to 1976.\n\nOakland Arena has been updated through multiple renovations, including a $100 million project in 1996. To support demand, capacity increased to 19,200, while 72 luxury suites and three exclusive clubs were added to enhance guest experience\n\nThe Challenge\n\nOakland Arena required an IPTV and digital signage system for use at its events, primarily on concourses, as menu boards, and to display live feeds of sponsor and event messaging in its suites. The venue had previously used a legacy digital signage system installed in the early 2000s. However, the legacy system is no longer directly supported by the manufacturer, so the Arena team began to seek a replacement in 2022.\n\n“It was an old, unreliable system,” says Colby Tucker, Sr. Director of Operations at Oakland Arena. “We would regularly have approximately a 10% downtime on our 600 or so screens, and we would have to troubleshoot issues with the screens for every event. Making any changes to the content would also be a major undertaking, requiring downtime on the screens to make a small change. It’s not a good experience for all the screens to go black for any amount of time during an event.”\n\nThe team began searching for a more reliable and adaptable solution befitting a modern venue. “I had heard good things about the VITEC system,” adds Tucker. “We learned about the competition in the market, and we leaned towards VITEC because it was trusted in our region, and I trusted its technology – it sounded very solid. The biggest thing that it could provide was a stable environment that was going to run when it needed to.”\n\nThe Result\n\nWith reliability a key requirement, the team has been delighted with the outcome. “It has saved me several hours per week because I’m not troubleshooting errors,” adds Tucker. “From our previous downtime of approximately 10%, we are running 100% of the time now. I know that things are going to start up and run.”\n\nThe additional flexibility of the system has also allowed the Arena to update content quickly as required. “The ability to change things ‘on the fly’ or create new assets very quickly has allowed us to offer more things to the tours that we host. Making adjustments immediately is a perk I did not have on the old system, but with VITEC, we can adjust content dynamically. Previously, we would have to bring down screens, make the change, and then bring them all back up to be able to change content. Now, I can change it for one screen, send those changes, and trust that it went live with almost no delay in the execution.”"
