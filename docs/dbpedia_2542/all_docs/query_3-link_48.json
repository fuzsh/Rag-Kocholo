        "text": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand — The New Zealand Breakers are the most unconventional team in Australia’s National Basketball League. For starters, they are the only team in the league that is not from Australia. It is also worth noting that they practice in a converted power tools warehouse, where they have two full-length courts, a film room, offices for staff and several well-appointed vending machines.\n\nThe owners are not particularly interested in making money off the team, and its chief executive officer — who was promoted after a successful stint as general manager — says that he knows almost nothing about basketball. But the Breakers, with their homegrown roster and homespun charm, know how to win.\n\n“Try to be disruptive,” Dean Vickerman, the team’s second-year coach, told his players at a recent practice, ahead of a road game against the Townsville Crocodiles. “They’re trying to drive the lane, and you’re trying to put doubt in their minds and buy some time for the next guy to get back.”\n\nVickerman, 43, a convivial Australian whom everyone calls Deano, was harping on one of his favorite subjects — teamwork — and paused just long enough to blow his whistle. “Go!”"
