        "text": "The next step in Princepal Singh's journey to making the NBA takes him Down Under to the NBL.\n\nThe news became official as the New Zealand Breakers capped off their roster for the 2021-22 season by adding Singh.\n\nThis comes after his one-year stint with the Ignite in the NBA G League, where he made an appearance in four games and totalled nine points and four rebounds along with one steal in 25 minutes of court time.\n\nWho are the New Zealand Breakers, Singh's new team? Let's get to know them with some fast facts.\n\nFast facts on New Zealand Breakers\n\nThe New Zealand Breakers, also known as the Sky Sport Breakers as they are sponsored by Sky Sport, are one of the 10 franchises in the NBL and the only one from the current set of teams to be based outside of Australia.\n\nFounded in 2003 by three Waikato businessmen in Dallas Fisher, Michael Redman and Keith Ward, the franchise is based out of the country's capital in Auckland and has played its home games at Spark Arena since 2012.\n\nNBA League Pass: Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the team to play the majority of the 2020-21 season as the home team from Tasmania. For the upcoming 2021-22 season, the team has committed to playing the first half based in Australia.\n\nHistory of the New Zealand Breakers\n\nDespite joining the NBL over two decades after the league was formed, the Breakers are tied for the third-most successful franchise. They are tied with the Adelaide 36ers for four championships all time.\n\nThey won their four titles in the span of five years from 2010 to 2015, including a three-peat from 2011-2013, which made them the second NBL franchise ever to three-peat.\n\nPrior to the 2021-22 season, the franchise has an overall record of 271-263 (.507), posting a record of .500 or better in 11 of their 18 seasons. They posted their best single-season record of 24-4 in the 2012-13 season, the final year of their three-peat.\n\nThat season they won a franchise-record 15 straight games and swept the postseason 4-0, winning both the best-of-three Semifinals and Grand Finals with 2-0 sweeps.\n\nThey posted a 12-24 record (their worst since 2006-07, which was just their fourth season in the league) in the 2020-21 season during which they missed major players for large portions of the season either due to injuries or personal reasons.\n\nPlayer/Coach Accomplishments\n\nRecognitions Player NBL MVP Kirk Penney (2009), Cedric Jackson (2013) NBL MVP for Grand Finals series Thomas Abercrombie (2011), C. J. Bruton (2012), Cedric Jackson (2013, 2015) All-NBL First Team Carlos Powell (2007), Kirk Penney (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011), C. J. Bruton (2009), Gary Wilkinson (2011), Cedric Jackson (2012, 2013, 2015), Thomas Abercrombie (2012) Leading NBL Scorer Carlos Powell (2007), Kirk Penney (2009) NBL Best Sixth Man Phill Jones (2009), Kevin Braswell (2011) NBL Most Improved Player Shea Ili (2018) NBL Defensive Player of the Year Dillon Boucher (2010) NBL Coach of the Year Andrej Lemanis (2012, 2013) Retired Numbers #23 C. J. Bruton, #24 Dillon Boucher, #32 Paul Henare\n\nOwnership\n\nThe ownership of the Breakers franchise has changed hands three times. The businessman trio that helped establish the franchise sold the team to Liz and Paul Blackwell in 2005.\n\nThe couple governed the franchise during its most successful stint before selling it in February 2018 to a consortium, headed by former NBA player Matt Walsh, that became the major shareholders via a newly formed company called Breakers Basketball Ltd.\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily represent the views of the NBA or its clubs."
