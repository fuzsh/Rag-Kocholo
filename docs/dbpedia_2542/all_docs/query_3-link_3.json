        "text": "Spark Arena is a modern, multi-purpose, technically sophisticated indoor arena located in Auckland that opened in 2006. The venue caters for a range of events including basketball and netball for which it can seat a maximum of 9,740 fans. The New Zealand Breakers play their home NBL matches at the venue while it also hosts New Zealand international netball tests and other major sports events. For concerts, up to 12,000 can be accommodated utilising the floor.\n\nThe venue is a significant icon for Auckland with the capacity, facilities and operational flexibility to support large community events as well as international sports and entertainment events. The site is at Quay Park, alongside the old Auckland Railway Station on the edge of the CBD. The location was chosen because it's easy to get to by road and public transport and is within minutes' walking distance of the CBD's hotels, restaurants and parking buildings as well as ferry, bus and train services."
