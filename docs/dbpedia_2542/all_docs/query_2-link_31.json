        "text": "Biography\n\nI began my legal career as a legal assistant at an estate planning and probate-focused law firm in Longwood. Upon passing the Florida Bar, I was hired on as an associate attorney. After a couple years the economy changed and I was faced with the decision of hanging my own shingle or continuing to work at the Longwood firm. Having always wanted to be my own boss, I decided to start my own law firm, focused on estate planning and probate. During this time I discovered my interest in real estate matters and have gradually increased my percentage of cases in real estate-related matters. After a few yearsit was best for my family and me to leverage my knowledge with a larger firm, so I began working at a firm in Mount Dora. It was while there that I became more acquainted with real estate. We had some complicated probate and estate planning cases as well. From there I briefly worked at a firm in Clermont, and from that firm to BMM.\n\nThe attention I pay to detail is my greatest strength as an attorney. The word used to describe me I have most heard from clients is “thorough.” I pride myself on my work product, and believe that taking the time to word things right, especially in the wills and trusts arena, pays dividends down the line.\n\nIf I had to put my finger on it, I’d say I became a lawyer because of the fact that the law touches every aspect of society, which is to say whatever field I am or become interested in, there is going to be a need for lawyers. That fact, coupled with my strength being in reading and writing as opposed to math, is what helped me make the decision to become a lawyer.\n\nHelping a client out of a negative situation in his/her life is the best part of my job. The relief you see in your client when the tenant is evicted their landlord/tenant matter is resolved successfully, or when the probate is over, or when the estate plan is signed, is what brings me back to work every day. I also enjoy being a “go to” person for my clients; even if I’m not the right lawyer for their situation, I want my clients to feel they can discuss any situation with me and know that if I am not the right lawyer for them that I will at the very least point them in the right direction.\n\nIf I didn’t practice law, I would you have pursued a career as a Geologist. The intersection of science and being outdoors is what led me to pursue a career in geology. However, during my undergraduate studies I “ran into” calculus II and discovered that being a geologist often involved complex math equations, especially when dealing with contaminant hydrogeology (a course I took in undergrad), and I found I was not up to the task. It is then that I realized my interests had to lay elsewhere."
