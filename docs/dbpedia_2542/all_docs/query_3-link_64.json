        "text": "The schedule did not, however, confirm the NBA preseason crossover games which remain a work in progress. They are likely to be between rounds two and five, where the Breakers are not scheduled for a game. The Herald understands they will play two games on their US trip, against teams from the NBA’s Western Conference.\n\nIt’s one of several works in progress for the Breakers, who remain on the hunt for a new head coach following Mody Maor’s departure and still have half a roster to put together ahead of the season.\n\nAmerican NBA journalist Marc Stein reported the club formally reached out to the Boston Celtics about the possibility of interviewing Jeff van Gundy for the role, but were told van Gundy already had an NBA coaching gig lined up.\n\nThe Herald understands the Breakers also had conversations with Australian Trevor Gleeson, who is currently an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks, but those conversations did not progress very far. The team is close to filling that vacancy, however, and expect to be in a position to announce their new coach soon.\n\nThe Breakers are also in the running to sign Canadian five-star recruit Will Riley, who is expected to make a decision about where he will sign early next week. Riley is reportedly choosing between the Breakers and the elite collegiate programmes at Illinois, Kentucky, Alabama and Arizona.\n\nShould Riley sign with the Breakers, he will be signed to the Next Star spot on their roster.\n\nAs it stands, the Breakers have put together a strong group led by import guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright, who in a rare move will come back for a second year at the club after an impressive campaign last season.\n\nHe will be joined by former NBA player Jonah Bolden, 2023 NBA draftee Mojave King, Australian stalwarts Mitch McCarron and Dane Pineau, as well as Kiwi big man Sam Mennenga.\n\nOf last year’s roster, only Pineau and Jackson-Cartwright have been confirmed to return, with Finn Delany leaving the club to take up an offer overseas."
