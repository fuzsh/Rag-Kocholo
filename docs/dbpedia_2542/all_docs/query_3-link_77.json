        "text": "Star forward Mitch Creek was dominant as South East Melbourne Phoenix fended off the New Zealand Breakers for the second time inside a week, and they now turn their attention to Sunday’s local derby.\n\nThe Phoenix opened their NBL season in style against an undermanned Breakers last Saturday and backed up on Friday night with a 95-88 win at John Cain Arena.\n\nPaced by Creek’s career-high 36 points, including 6-7 from three-point land, the Phoenix – having led by only three points at half-time – were made to battle but Creek delivered key baskets late in the final quarter.\n\n“Honestly, I was just locked in tonight – I had to come out and put my stamp on the game early,” Creek said.\n\nTheir focus now shifts to Sunday’s Throwdown XIII against Melbourne United at John Cain Arena.\n\nPoint guard Xavier Munford supplied 17 points and six assists, Kyle Adnam came off the bench to provide 16 points, while Chinese star Zhou Qi, who starred on debut last week, was in foul trouble early but finished with eight points.\n\nThe Breakers, already without the injured Tom Abercrombie and Jeremiah Martin, lost point guard Peyton Siva (hamstring) early, and they missed his playmaking skills. Hugo Besson (26 points) led the Breakers.\n\nUnited sharpshooter Chris Goulding will need to prove his fitness at training on Saturday if he is to return from a hamstring strain against the Phoenix. Goulding missed United’s season-opening loss against the Sydney Kings on Sunday and had limited involvement at training on Friday.\n\nCoach Dean Vickerman said Goulding had work to do if he was to return.\n\n“Chris got into some competitive work today which is a great step forward. He will probably need some more work, he will get some of that [on Sunday], then we will make our assessment from there,” Vickerman said.\n\nMeet the NBL’s ‘youngest old man’\n\nHis coach likes to joke that Reuben Te Rangi is the youngest old man in the NBL and even the South East Melbourne Phoenix player admits there is something to that tag.\n\nTe Rangi has been in the NBL since his teenage years, signing as a development player with the New Zealand Breakers where he was schooled on professional basketball by the likes of NBL greats Mika Vukona and CJ Bruton as the Breakers went from a laughing stock to winning four championships.\n\nNow 27, Te Rangi was to play his 250th NBL game on Friday night when the Phoenix took on the Breakers at John Cain Arena.\n\n“My first year in the league I was around guys like Mika Vukona and Dillon Boucher and guys like that so I got to learn from the best when it comes to defence,” Te Rangi said on Thursday.\n\n“I was around a lot of leaders like CJ Bruton, Tom Abercrombie – I got to learn from the best and those lessons have stuck with me throughout my career.\n\n“It was an eye-opener – I got to see what winning was like first hand and what losing was like first hand – I don’t ever want to be in that losing situation again.”\n\nPhoenix coach Simon Mitchell was serious in his praise for Te Rangi. “He’s the youngest old man floating around this league,” Mitchell said.\n\n“He is a ripper. A real leader for our ball club, he’s not the most boisterous but he has a quiet, calm, strong demeanour and our NZ guys rally around him but our Australian blokes look up to him too.″⁣\n\nMitchell still bristles about those who called out Te Rangi’s three-point shooting without looking at the rest of his game.\n\n“I think maybe too much focus was put on shooting from last year – they’re good shots that he takes and sometimes they go in, sometimes they don’t,” Mitchell said.\n\n“But his versatility at the defensive end, his ability off the dribble and his improved finishing ability – just his IQ on spacing the floor – he’s got that in spades and defensively he’s always in the right spot.\n\n“If ever there’s a breakdown and there’s two guys kind of looking at each other and one of them is Reuben – I just yell at the other bloke, as he’s probably done the right thing.”\n\nMitchell also said import Devin Thomas was listed to leave quarantine on Friday morning and rejoin training but he wouldn’t be considered for games until at least next weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the WNBL has cancelled the game between Sydney University Flames and Canberra Capitals, scheduled for Canberra this Sunday due to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\nA member of the Capitals attended a training session with the full team on Tuesday morning so under ACT Health rules all players and coaches involved in the session have been listed as close contacts and told to isolate for seven days and have a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe WNBL said in a statement that the Flames players would be tested as a precaution because the two sides played each other last Sunday to open their respective seasons.\n\nNBL clubs Sydney Kings and Melbourne United played after the Flames and Capitals at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney last Sunday but the two NBL sides aren’t expected to get any tests as authorities believe the person was infected after Sunday’s game.\n\nBasketball Australia executive general manager of competitions Paul Maley said the league would do all it could to reschedule the game later this season.\n\n“The WNBL has a COVID safety plan for all players, officials and fans that ensures we adhere to all government requirements and move swiftly to prevent any spread of the virus,” Maley said.\n\n“We will continue to monitor this situation closely working collaboratively with the clubs.”\n\nNBL Round 2\n\nThursday\n\nAdelaide 36ers 83 d Tasmania JackJumpers 80, MySTATE Bank Arena\n\nThe Sixers scored coach CJ Bruton his first win, holding on in the final term despite a late comeback from the JackJumpers. Import guard Dusty Hannahs led Adelaide with 15 points, including a vital late three.\n\nFriday\n\nSouth East Melbourne Phoenix 95 d New Zealand Breakers 88, John Cain Arena\n\nThe Phoenix made it 2-0 to start the season, but they had to work for the win as French guard Hugo Besson (26 points) almost dragged his side to a memorable win. But Mitch Creek’s career-best 36 points made sure the home side won.\n\nSaturday\n\nIllawarra Hawks 92 d Sydney Kings 84, Qudos Bank Arena\n\nHawks centre Duop Reath continued his outstanding start to the new season with 27 points as Illawarra beat their in-state rivals, who lost import guards Jaylen Adams and RJ Hunter before the game to nagging injuries.\n\nCairns Taipans 69 d Tasmania JackJumpers 62, Cairns Convention Centre\n\nAdelaide 36ers v New Zealand Breakers, Adelaide Entertainment Centre, 3pm AEDT\n\nThe Sixers are undermanned, so are the Breakers but both will be desperate to take this win and keep within touch of the leaders.\n\nPerth Wildcats v Brisbane Bullets, RAC Arena, 5.30pm AEDT\n\nThe Wildcats scorched through their two games last round and this could be another win unless the Bullets can find a way to negate the scoring of both Bryce Cotton and Vic Law."
