Stay LinkedIn with the BNZ Breakers | The NZ Breakers roared into life on 1 October 2003, defeating the Adelaide 36ers by a single point in front of a sold out North Shore Events Centre. Professional basketball hit New Zealand, with entertainment, action and the excitement of the ANBL becoming a weekly experience over the summer months in Auckland. Fast forward 15 years and that excitement and entertainment is still being delivered, now on a larger scale at Auckland’s Spark Arena, as well as regionally around the country.",

Professional basketball hit New Zealand, with entertainment, action and the excitement of the ANBL becoming a weekly experience over the summer months in Auckland. Fast forward 15 years and that excitement and entertainment is still being delivered, now on a larger scale at Auckland’s Spark Arena, as well as regionally around the country. Over the club's short history the Breakers have established themselves as a club who do things differently. In recent years the Club has not only grown awareness here in New Zealand, but on the global stage with NBA pre-season games now a regular feature of the season calendar. Top level talent is coming to New Zealand to play, and our own players are being seen by global basketball scouts. Whilst the success of four Championships has been a standout achievement, it is also the off-court success and work in the community that shapes the club. It is through the financial commitment and support of our sponsors and partners that the club can stay active in this space, and this will continue to be a focus moving forward. We look forward to welcoming you into the BNZ Breakers family, if there is anything you need, please feel free to chat with our team today - 09 970 5260 or gobreakers@nzbreakers.co.nz.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttps://www.nzbreakers.basketball/\n\nExternal link for BNZ Breakers\n\nIndustry\n\nSpectator Sports\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nAuckland\n\nType\n\nPrivately Held\n\nFounded\n\n2003\n\nSpecialties\n\nEvent Delivery, Corporate Hospitality, Basketball Development, Fan Engagement, Membership Management, Sponsor Leveraging, and Group Ticketing"
