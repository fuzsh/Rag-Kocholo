        "text": "PER $1.55\n\nNZB $2.45\n\nMargin -3.5\n\nOver/Under: 164.5\n\nNZ a tad underrated there IMO - they're a different team since Webster has slotted back in, but this should be a good even contest.\n\nWebster & Jackson had their way with us last time, so Damo being back will be particularly handy for this one.\n\nI share your concern about him, Matthew. I want to see him in a NASA-certified space helmet tonight.\n\nPerth need to make someone other than Webster and Abercrombie beat them, especially without Wesley in the low block. Melbourne shut those two down in the second quarter last week and NZ struggled to score, but it's easier said than done for four quarters.\n\nThis is worth watching. Two top 4 teams going at it.\n\nCan Charles Jackson stay out of foul trouble? I think he's a bit nimble and athletic for Jawai at NZ's offensive end, so if he can stay out of foul trouble he could be the one to do some damage other than the usual suspects.\n\n15 & 10 in a very efficient 24 minutes against us, last game by Jackson.\n\nI'd like to think we'll be more conscious of him as a result of that game. Sit him on his arse if he tries any of that sneaky crap (scoring and rebounding) against us tonight.\n\nTai Wesley has an infected liver from his appendix surgery I believe.\n\nHe's probably out for a another couple of rounds which is a pity as his inside game would have come in handy tonight.\n\nNZ will need to win the rebound count to have a chance and will need Pledger and Abercrombie to be aggressive offensively and Ced Jackson to not settle for jump shots.\n\nPerth will need to shut down Webster, Abercrombie and Bartlett from the perimeter and box out for 40mins.\n\nSo let me get this straight....\n\nPrather WITHOUT THE BALL, was running towards the rim and the Perth player went to pass it to him....The Breakers player fouled him when Prather didnt have the ball...\n\nHe gets 2 FTs...\n\nLOL then Webster shooting a 3 after he lets go of the ball and is on the back end of his shot gets fouled and ball on the side.\n\nI swear this league has the most incompetent officials\n\nPet hate is how Perth's bench jump up and come running out on the court every time someone does something semi-good. Yes I know they're hyped but its so annoying! Haha.\n\nAs an aside, its pretty much impossible to defend the post. Can't breathe on someone without being whistled. Pledge did it well earlier but surprised they didnt call something.\n\nThe league is becoming way too soft on interior defence. Its borderline crisis.\n\nNo wonder this league is the laughing stock of world basketball...\n\nThe ONLY reason why ANY import would come here is because they have been rejected from any other league OR to come here for the Australian life style over summer.\n\nThey wouldnt come here rejecting other offers.\n\nCedric Jackson might not be much of a jump-shooter but you can't underrate the role he is playing in Webster's current MVP form. Webster is able to thrive on the offensive end in part because of Jackson's ability to beat his man off the dribble and cause defensive rotations.\n\nAlso as an aside that Perth Arena courtside announcer certainly likes to talk ...\n\nI still cant get over how Prather got awarded 2 free throws when he didnt have the ball and he was getting a pass. They werent in the penalty either.\n\nThen Webster was fouled shooting a 3 pointer and the Breakers got the ball from the side\n\nThat sequence sums up with this league is...\n\nIncompetence.\n\nGee whiz pledger was ordinary tonight. Missed so many bunnies near the ring. And to those who said Abercrombie was a better player than prather that couldn't look further from the truth. Not to mention prather did a good defensive job on Webster and impresses me with his passing too. The drop off pass to nate for the jam showed good composure and awareness. And he seems to get to the hole with ease on offense. Great pickup\n\nI think the game was won in the 2nd when the Cats decided to use that huge frontline. Jawai and Knight just went to work from then on. This sets up a great game on Wednesday simply because Perth wins they get a 3 game buffer on the Breaker and take the series which could be huge at season end or if the Breakers win ties the series and pull within a game of Perth.\n\nEitherway it will be a great game.\n\nFree throws.\n\nFree throws.\n\nGosh. NZ were atrocious from the line. These guys play bball every day, and still barely crack 50%. Twice in that crucial last 5 or so minutes they missed both, and it was a huge blow to their momentum.\n\nStill, good effort from Perth. Two quality sides.\n\nAnother dog act by the wildcats and Greg Hire, game was won and he shoots a half court shot on the buzzer I mean why do that, that's why Ervin and the sixers got angry about 2 years ago, and their fans wonder why their team has little respect from other fans.\n\nRefs... both ways made atrocious calls. It was miss or butcher the obvious decision a couple times. Then reflect and two plays later make another shocker to make up for the one you now are pretty sure was wrong... I really want to say they are bias against my team, but they are really just abysmal. Also did anyone else notice the missed cross court at the opening tip? How do you miss that?\n\n@sixers147- this has been covered to death on this forum but I'll bite. How is it considered a dog act and are you trying to tell me your team does not do this ? It's s close league , every single point counts. If A team can play defense till the last second why can't the other team jack up a shot. There's just no logic there at all.\n\nWas wondering how much ref bashing would be waiting in this thread when I got home. Yep, a fairly appropriate amount. Didn't think they did a great job tonight.\n\nDidn't think the Breakers did a great job down the stretch either. They could have stolen that one had they hit their free throws & layups.\n\nVery pleased that Damo got through unscathed.\n\nHope Webster is ok.\n\nPerth won, obviously it must be the refs' fault. ROFL\n\nCats were just too consistently better for most of the game. Had it almost in the bag by the end of the 3rd quarter.\n\nDid their best to piss away the lead in the last few minutes, but for once things rolled their way.\n\nAs for the idiot anonytrolls above; as you said Webster was fouled well after he made his shot, ie clearly not in the act of shooting, so why on earth would he get FT's?\n\nNot sure about Damo? Played a couple of minutes then stayed on the bench. Makes me wonder if he came back too soon and copped a jolt?\n\nI think the league has descended back into 2012/13 in the past two weeks. I love this league but every game this round has been so scrappy it's difficult to watch. Refs make a rod for their backs by letting so much go and then plucking out a foul here or there. The poor players must have no idea what is and isn't legal at the moment.\n\nThe guy closest to the camera has a clear look at it. Don't know what the responsibilities of each ref are, though.\n\nAnd yeah, I actually had to check with the person sitting next to me whether it'd actually happened, because I just couldn't believe something that blatant was missed by the refs and the crowd didn't seem to bothered either. I've only watched enough of the game on TV to capture that, but neither commentator seems to have noticed."
