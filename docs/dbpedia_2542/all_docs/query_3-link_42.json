They’ve played a lot in Tassie (through COVID), so it’s like another home court for them, and now they’ve got their roster fit and firing, it’ll certainly be a challenge once again. Cheatham and Lamb are just the tip of the iceberg for them, their talent depth is really strong and with a clean bill of heath from what I understand, they will be dangerous\".\n\nIns & outs\n\nTasmania JackJumpers: Majok Deng will be sidelined for ~4 weeks with an ankle strain.\n\nNew Zealand Breakers: TBC"
