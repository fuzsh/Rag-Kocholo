        "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Another road block has popped up again to bring the Arizona Coyotes back to the Valley of the Sun.\n\nOn Friday, the Arizona State Land Department (ASLD) postponed the June 27 auction for land near the Loop 101 and Scottsdale Road that the Coyotes were hoping to bid on to build a multi-million dollar entertainment district and arena.\n\nThe ASLD says the proposed arena will require a special use permit, which they are requesting Coyotes officials file before the auction.\n\n“This affords the applicant and ASLD certainty that the applicant can build what it intends to build for its anchor tenant. It is not uncommon for ASLD to require applicants to secure zoning/use permits prior to auction,” a portion of the release states. “We understand the delay in an auction is a disappointment for our applicant and members of the public, but the change in timing is the prudent decision for the Trust.”\n\nRead the full notice below:\n\nHowever, it isn’t the complete end for the Coyotes. The ASLD says they will remain open to holding the auction in the future once the permit is filed.\n\nThe Arizona Coyotes released the following statement regarding the ASLD postponing the land auction:\n\nEarlier this year, the NHL Board of Governors voted unanimously to move the Yotes to Salt Lake City, a $1.2 billion sale from Coyotes Chairman and Governor Alex Meruelo to Utah Jazz owners Ryan and Ashley Smith.\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Meruelo said at the time they would be committed to bringing hockey back to Arizona. Officials were wary of the Yotes playing at ASU’s Mullett Arena for a third season, which led to the ultimate sale.\n\nMeruelo will retain the Coyotes’ name, logo and trademark, so Smith’s group will have to rename the team.\n\nMeruelo previously told Arizona’s Family he intended to build the arena without using taxpayer money. Meruelo said he had “full commitment to win the land auction.”\n\nThe team released renderings of its planned state-of-the-art arena, but have faced pushback from Scottsdale Mayor David Ortega. The mayor claims the project would have “negative repercussions” for the city, and it needs to move west away from Scottsdale. According to Mayor Ortega, the Coyotes’ plan has several key issues, including the lack of infrastructure in the area.\n\nIn 2003, the Yotes moved to Glendale’s Gila River Arena, now Desert Diamond Arena. Their relationship with the city soured, and they left for Tempe in 2022. Coyotes hoped to have their arena and entertainment complex near Tempe Town Lake, but voters overwhelmingly rejected that idea last May. The team has been exploring their options ever since.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
