In the first few months the British suffered many reverses.\n\nPatriotism ran high in these days of Empire, and Queen Victoria sent consignments of chocolate to the troops wishing them a Happy New Year for January 1st, 1900. This token of goodwill is well known from the First World War, but it was also a feature of the South African War.\n\nThe Suffolks' first battle was to assault Red Hill near Colesburg in January 1900 with heavy losses. The Boers gave the area the name of Suffolk Hill in recognition of their courage.\n\nBack in Bury, January saw a rush to raise a Volunteer Company to go to the Cape. Thirty men from the 2nd Volunteer Battalion joined others from East Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Cambridge University to train at Bury. They left for South Africa on February 11th. At 5.30 am, in a blinding snowstorm, they were cheered off at Bury train station by hundreds of local people. On May 12th they joined the 1st Battalion The Suffolk Regiment, at the Vet River.\n\nMeanwhile on 23rd March, the 2nd Volunteer Company left Bury for Capetown, where they arrived on April 14th. They joined the Suffolk Regiment at Middleburg.\n\nIn 1900, Suffolk was still a deeply rural county. Most people lived in the 500 villages and towns of under 5000 people. Haverhill, like Thetford, had around 4,000 people. Only 5 towns exceeded 5000. Rural life was however, in decline as foreign food imports undermined agricultural prices and thus wages.\n\nAlso in decline was the use of water for transport as well as power. By September 1900 it was clear that the Receiver who was managing the Eastern Counties Navigation and Transport Company Limited, had decided to throw in the towel. He had been unable to raise more capital, and began to sell off the assets. Water mills along the river were finding it hard to compete with newer steam driven roller mills.\n\nBury Market on Wednesday and Saturday were important days for country folk to come to town to sell or buy produce. The White Lion was still an important Carriers' House in 1900, despite the decline of the Wagonners and Carters over the past 50 years since railways. Its yard in Brentgovel Street still saw up to 16 wagons pull in from the villages on market day mornings. The White Lion on the corner of Short Brackland was removed to make way for the Cornhill Walk shopping development.\n\nNot far from the White Lion stood the Griffin. This very long established inn stood on the Cornhill at the top of St Johns Street. Like the White Lion nearby it was not a coaching inn, but was a major Carrier's House because it was next to the Great Market. In 1900 some 10 carrier's wagons used it as the base to and from the villages on market days.\n\nThe Castle was an inn next to Moyse's Hall, with a sizeable yard in Brentgovel Street. Not surprisingly, it was also used by carriers coming to and from the market.\n\nThe Relief of Mafeking\n\nblank Things had not being going well in South Africa since Mafeking had been under siege since 13th October 1899, the day after the independent Boer Republic declared war. Colonel Baden-Powell had led a masterly defence, until a relief column finally arrived on 17th May, 1900, after a 217 day siege. When news reached home the streets were full of celebrating crowds in towns and cities all over the country. In Bury St Edmunds it was decided to celebrate the occasion along with the Queen's birthday on 24th May, and the Mayor had to quickly get arrangements made for a School holiday and a half day shop and business closure.\n\nAlbany Villas\n\nblank Bury was home to about 16,000 people, and building continued to be needed to house them. Most house building was by small local builders. A good builder might make Â£10 profit on a house sold for Â£100. A bad builder could lose Â£10 a house. Houses were largely built in pairs, or small terraces, like the pair of grandly named \"villas\" illustrated here in Hospital Road. The extra ornamental detailing probably indicated a higher priced dwelling than normal.\n\nSir Walter Greene\n\nblank Bury still voted Conservative, this time electing the very well known brewer, now Sir E Walter Greene, Bt, who lived his life as a wealthy sporting country gentleman. Walter Greene, the Chairman of Greene King, was one of the country's super rich at this time. He received around Â£18,000 a year from dividends from the Brewery, and had just been made a baronet in 1900. At Nether Hall in Thurston he kept a grand house, stables, a pack of deer hounds, and a herd of deer. He is pictured here in 1916, but looking every inch the Edwardian sporting gentleman.\n\nWalter Greene had been defeated when he tried to become MP for North West Suffolk in 1891, but this time he was unopposed. This was fortunate for him, as he was not to prove much of a politician. By 1905, he had decided not to stand again.\n\nSite of electricity works\n\nblank At Bury the locals were proud to say that the streets and public buildings would soon be lit by electricity as the works, which belonged to the corporation, were completed in 1900. Under the Electric Lighting Act of 1882, local authorities were empowered to set up electricity undertakings. The generating station, and two cottages to house its key operatives, were located on the Playfields, off Prospect Row. Two Lancashire Boilers were installed driving two 60 kilowatt dynamoes. These produced Direct Current (DC) electricity of three wire 400/200 volts, as opposed to the modern alternating current of 230 volts. By 1903 a further 10 kilowatts capacity would be added, and further extensions would be carried out in 1908 and 1910.\n\nThe site of the electricity undertaking is nowadays a car park, and Prospect Row is the road off King's Road which in the year 2002 was the major access road to the whole Cattle Market car park site. It then became a service road for the Arc shopping development.\n\nLancashire boilers at Power Station\n\nBury St Edmunds\n\nblank The Lancashire boiler was developed in 1844 by William Fairbairn. Although he was Scottish by birth, Fairbairn moved to Manchester after serving an apprenticeship in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He became one of the leading mechanical engineers of his day. His Lancashire boiler had twin furnace tubes side-by-side, which gave it a much larger heating surface than that of the older Cornish boiler. To produce steam, coal was shovelled through the firedoors at the end to maintain a fire in each of the furnace tubes. A typical Lancashire boiler would consume around six tons of coal per day. Lancashire boilers were surrounded by brickwork flues. This meant that the hot flue gases produced by burning coal could circulate under and along the sides of the boiler before reaching the chimney. Thus, instead of escaping straight up the chimney and being wasted, the flue gases helped to heat the water in the boiler.\n\nThe Lancashire boilers at the Bury St Edmunds generating station were made by Crothers Limited of Sheffield, one of which is shown here in a photograph by G S Cousins, dated to 1910 or 1916: (the dating is unclear).\n\nDuring 1900 the first street lighting by electricity was also being installed. At first, there were just eight lighting columns which would receive a ceremonial switch-on early in 1901.\n\nThe Bury St Edmunds Gas Company had been providing public street lighting by gas since 1834. These needed to be lit each evening by a team of lamp lighters, which was an expensive and sometimes ineffective method. In February 1901 the changoeover from gas to electricity for street lighting would begin. In 1900 the Gas Company tried to raise its public profile by opening a Gas Showroom on the Cornhill. It hoped to promote the use of gas cookers, which it had introduced to Bury in 1897. These premises were rented and would close in 1907, to be replaced by a showroom at the gas works in Tayfen Road.\n\nWater raising by windpower\n\nblank Next door to the Electricity Generating station in the Corporation Yard was the Water Bore Hole for the town. The pumping station had got the use of steam power, but this was supplemented by this wind pump, built in 1900. This was called the Simplex Pump, built by J W Titt, and had vanes of 60 feet across. It was the most modern wind engine of its day. Recently wind pumps had been added to the West Stow sewage works, and must have proved successful enough to be copied in town.\n\nAt the same time a water storage reservoir and associated water tower was being built at West Road, one of the highest points in town. By pumping water from the borehole up to the West Road tower, it would ensure that sufficient water pressure could be supplied by gravity through mains pipes to any location within the borough.\n\nRobert Boby, ironfounders of St Andrews Works in Bury St Edmunds was completing its new Northgate Foundry by the railway line. It seems that, in order to provide a convenient location for the new foundry workers, relocated from the town centre, a row of 16 cottages were built by Boby's on the hillside overlooking the foundry. These were romantically named the \"Klondyke Cottages\", a reference to the gold rush in the Yukon, and a name that implied hope and prosperity, a new beginning, or a new frontier.\n\nGradually the area became referred to as the Klondyke, and the name was later applied to the access lane to the cottages off the Beetons footpath, now called Beetons Way.\n\nRailway Mission Hall\n\nblank The Railway Mission was a charity founded in 1881 to bring the Gospel to people working on the railways. The railways employed thousands of men who often had to work during normal church hours. In 1895, local railwaymen approached Mrs Arthur Ridley, about starting a railway mission in Bury St Edmunds. Mrs Ridley was a widow, and a Congregationalist from the Northgate Street Chapel, and she began by leading services at the station. Since 1895 a room in the Station Master's house by the Northgate railway station in Bury St Edmunds had been used as the mission to railwaymen who worked on the Bury line. By 1900 the pressure of numbers was such that a larger venue was required.\n\nSoon they had raised enough money amongst themselves, and the mission hall was ordered.\n\nSo on 30th May, 1900 the Railway Mission was opened in Bury St Edmunds, at Fornham Road, just past the railway bridge. It was pre-fabricated building, of the type which became called the \"tin tabernacle.\" There were companies all over the country who could provide similar buildings in kit form including Boulton and Paul in Norwich. The tabernacle at Bury was put up by W Hartrow, a contractor from London, and along with its furniture and fittings it cost Â£317 7s 7d. This was much cheaper than building a brick church.\n\nThis view shows the original mission hall which you can verify by counting the five windows along its railway side. Click on the thumbnail for a larger view. After 1903 the extension would give a total of eight windows.\n\nSoon there were Sunday services, a Sunday School, Mothers' Meetings, Young Persons Groups and a host of activities at the Mission Hall. In 1903 the hall would be extended by 10 feet, and a 30 foot extension was added for the Sunday School.\n\nMrs Ridley, whose first name was Caroline, was the first Superintendent, a post she held for 21 years, until old age led her to retire in 1916.\n\nThis view of the Mission Hall also shows Gough's maltings in the background. The significance of this picture is that it shows goods waggons outside the maltings on the railway spur specifically built to serve the maltings.\n\nEarly years Whitmore's Timber\n\nblank Across the road from the new chapel was Whitmore's blacksmith shop. In 1900 Austin Whitmore, son of T.G.Whitmore, started milling home grown round logs, and from here grew the massive business which would be bought up as part of the by-pass in 1972. Part of Whitmore's Yard is covered by Tesco's Supermarket today.\n\nVale and Richardson's shop received the large decorative clock which still hangs over the Thurlow Champness' shop at 14 Abbeygate Street in Bury St Edmunds today.\n\nIn Haverhill, the Recreation Ground was opened, a gift from W. B. Gurteen to commemorate Queen Victoria's diamond Jubilee.\n\nThe Haverhill silk weaving firm of Kipling and Co was taken over by Walters. Their silk factory at Hamlet Green was later closed.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century Haverhill had almost come to resemble a red-brick midlands mill town, dominated by the Gurteen's Factory. Most of the people in Haverhill worked in some way for the Gurteen family.\n\nPeashill Slade\n\nblank Houses were tightly crowded together as this view from St Mary's church tower in 1900 shows. There was much company housing, several non-conformist churches, a fine Town Hall (given to the community by the Gurteen family), a local newspaper and two railway stations, Haverhill South on the Colne Valley line, and Haverhill North on the Stour Valley line. Domestic architecture included a block of twelve houses known as Weaver's Row each of which had three storeys, the middle one containing the loom.\n\nAround the town were no fewer than three windmills, including the unique ring-shaped Ruffles Mill on Chalkstone Hill, which was pulled down during the Second World War.\n\nThe population of the town in 1901 was around 4,000, and Haverhill remained a small but active agricultural and industrial township.\n\nTye Green at Glemsford is said to be named because the Tythings were once held there. A very different public meeting was held there on a warm Saturday in August 1900 when a deputation from Ipswich and District Trades and Labour Council addressed the assembled factory workers. Here the gathering of Mat Weavers was told that it was surprising the low wage paid to their craftsmen, and a wonder how they existed on it. The female workers of the silk industry were urged to combine and try and improve the conditions under which they worked. It is not recorded how the Glemsford workforce responded to these union recruiters.\n\nSome things did change, however. Hengrave Hall had passed out of the old aristocratic Gage family and into the hands of a rich ironmaster. In 1900 Sir John Wood converted the church on the estate from Catholic to Protestant worship. He also restored the greatly decayed house, and built a new annexe. Although some older features of the Tudor building were lost, without his work it may well have decayed away completely.\n\nManor House, Mildenhall\n\nblank At Great Barton the estate had been owned by the Bunbury family since 1746, and the seat of the lordship of Mildenhall and Great Barton had been at Barton Hall since then. In 1900 Sir Henry Bunbury decided to leave Great Barton to live on his smaller estate at Mildenhall. He now intended to lease the Barton Estate to a suitable tenant. Nearby, at Saxham Hall, Frank Riley Smith had been living in the Hall and running the small sporting estate since 1897. Frank Riley Smith was part owner of John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, Yorkshire, but left the running of the business to his brother. Frank had been born Frank Riley, and this was his name until he and his elder brother inherited the John Smith Brewery from their maternal uncle William. A condition was that the two nephews should take the name Smith in addition to Riley.\n\nRiley Smith had devoted himself to hunting, and had formed a pack of beagles at Saxham. He was so successful that Sir Walter Greene, newly elected MP, asked him to take over Greene's own pack of Staghounds, which he had kept at Thurston since 1864. When Riley Smith heard that Barton Estate was available he took the lease with effect from January 1901, and immediately spent a year on improving and modernising Barton Hall.\n\nVolunteers ready for War\n\n1901 During 1900 and 1901, volunteers continued to join up for the South Africa War, which dragged on into 1902. The picture shows a detachment of the Second Volunteer Battalion parading on Cornhill. Note the large open space as the Boer War Memorial does not yet exist.\n\nFuneral of Queen Victoria\n\nblank Queen Victoria died in January, the last monarch of the House of Hanover. The new king, Edward VII, was a Saxe-Coburg. Her funeral was on Saturday, February 2nd, 1901, and at Bury St Edmunds traders and public houses were invited to suspend business for the day.\n\nMany agricultural fields in our area contain old pits, often said to be for the extraction of marl to spread on the land. Another use for chalk extraction was apparently to mend the roads as this report in the Bury Post for January 22nd 1901 describes:\n\n\"RISBY\n\nSerious accident in a Chalk pit - A very serious accident occurred on Wednesday morning in the neighbourhood of Risby. Three men were employed in getting chalk to repair the roads, when the side of the chalk pit under which they were working suddenly fell in, completely burying two of the men, who would inevitably have perished, had it not been for the prompt action of their fellow workman, who, with the greatest difficulty succeeded, after half an hourâs careful digging in rescuing them.\"\n\nIn February the electric street lighting in Bury had its ceremonial switching on. There was at first only eight lighting columns. To assist the change from gas to electric lighting, all 323 gas powered street lamp columns and lanterns were sold to Bury St Edmunds Borough Council by the Gas Company. The Gas Company now relied solely upon supplying gas to households and businesses, and to those public buildings which needed it until they converted to electricity. Gradually people would adopt electricity for lighting, but many preferred to cook by gas right up to the present day. Gas cookers were introduced to Bury St Edmunds in 1897.\n\nWest Suffolk Hospital\n\nblank Electricity was also supplied to the Hospital in Hospital Road. A new operating theatre was built as well. The picture here is from a contemporary postcard. It shows West Suffolk Hospital before its distinctive balconies were added in 1908.\n\nGreene King also connected to the electricity supply at this time. Edward Lake had wanted to install their own electricity in 1890, but he had been over-ruled by the Board.\n\nThe census for 1901 tells us that Bury had a population of 16,255 at this time. Clare was 1,582, Haverhill was 4,862 and Sudbury was 7,109. Stanton was 778, Ixworth was 856, and Horringer 525. Lavenham had 2,018 and Long Melford had 3,080 people.\n\nThurlow Champness\n\nblank There had been a clock and watch business at 14 Abbeygate Street since 1745, when it was started by George Lumley. In 1901 Edward Thurlow Champness, the son of the Headmaster of Northgate School, Ipswich, bought the jewellers and watch business at 14 Abbeygate Street from Mr Richardson, and the Champness family lived over the shop until 1947. The large trademark clock sign was apparently made in 1900. The business is still in that family today.\n\nOn May 3rd in the evening, the 1st Volunteer company returned home from the Boer War to a heroes welcome. Two officers and 98 men marched from the train station to Angel Hill, accompanied by large crowds, for a welcome home by the Mayor. They then returned to barracks and were demobbed the next day.\n\nThe 2nd Volunteer Company arrived back to another warm welcome in early June.\n\nBury Fire Brigade\n\nblank The Fire Station in the Shambles had been opened in 1899. A number of pictures were taken of the brigade on 4th May, 1901, and this may be one of that series. Whit Monday 1901 was on May 27th and the Brigade was expected to put on a display for the crowds. The fireman on the right of the picture is thought to be Engineer Vincent Baldwin who went on to have a long career in the service. In the background may be seen the International Stores at 23 Cornhill, opened in 1896, with a banner advertising tickets on sale for the Hardwick Fete on Whit Monday.\n\nIn February 1901 the Receiver of the Eastern Counties Navigation & Transport Company Limited had been discharged, and in September of 1901, an Extraordinary General Meeting of the company was called to wind itself up. Barge traffic on the River Lark above Mildenhall was now minimal, and deeply unprofitable.\n\nMost of the physical assets of the company had already been disposed of, but it still owned the Lark Navigation rights, and they still had a value.\n\nAfter September 1901 the Lark upstream of Mildenhall was abandoned for barge traffic. The prospective purchasers of the Lark were Parker Brothers of Mildenhall, and they only wanted it to service their own mills at Barton Mills and Icklingham.\n\nIn November, the expanding firm of Parker Brothers reopened the Mildenhall Mill. They converted the mill to a roller mill, using steam power instead of water power.\n\nIn November Colonel Sam Cody demonstrated his man-lifting kites to a crowd behind the Gibraltar Barracks at Bury St Edmunds. The contraption was called the \"Viva\", and consisted of four large box kites which lifted the Colonel several hundred feet into the air to great applause. By 1908 the same gentleman was able to make a first powered flight in British Army Aeroplane Number 1 at Farnborough, which was a prelude to the use of aircraft during World War I.\n\nThe story of St Edmund continued to intrigue people, and some relics were taken from St Sernin in Toulouse, to Arundel, as it was said that they were the remains of St Edmund. It was intended to lay these relics in the Westminster Cathedral, which was in the final stages of construction. However, respected men such as M R James, Dr Charles Bigg and Sir Ernest Clarke, all refuted the idea that these could be the bones of St Edmund. Cardinal Vaughan at Westminster accepted these assertions and the bones were never removed from Arundel.\n\nThe Icklingham Papers\n\nblank The Icklingham Papers were published in 1901 by Henry Prigg's daughter, Mrs Beatrice Andrews, who had accompanied him on some of his antiquarian excursions. The book was introduced by Vincent Redstone, and contained copies of manorial documents and wills from the village, together with an account of the archaeological investigations of some of the antiquities of Icklingham. Prigg showed that a Roman villa and cemetery had existed on the site and he also excavated the tumuli and found pottery kilns at nearby West Stow Heath. Prigg had worked at the National Provincial Bank in Bury, until he retired four years before his death in 1892. He lived at Babwell Friary, and having died in his early 50's he did not have time to put his work in order for publication, but his daughter decided the work needed to be properly published.\n\nHenry Prigg's daughter, Beatrice, was married to Charles Andrews, a partner in the ironmongers Andrews in Guildhall Street, which later became Andrews and Plumptons of Bury. She was also the mother of three year old Sybil Andrews who would later become an internationally known artist. In about 1901 they moved out of the rooms above the shop into Greyfriars in Whiting Street.\n\nMany of the antiquities unearthed by Prigg over a lifetime of excavation were exhibited at first in the Athenaeum, and then were to form the core of the Moyse's Hall Museum collection when it was set up in 1899. The fifth child of Beatrice and Charles Andrews was called Henry (1904-1961), and he would become Curator of Moyse's Hall Museum himself in 1933.\n\nWilliam Silas Spanton\n\nblank W S Spanton, a local photographer at 16 Abbeygate Street, Bury St Edmunds, retired and sold the business and its negatives to Harry Isaac Jarman. William Silas Spanton, 1845-1930, was the son of the William Spanton who had started this business in 1863/4. William junior was also an accomplished artist, as this self portrait, dated to about 1890, shows. Spanton had also painted at least one Mayoral portrait, notably for Alderman George Thompson, in 1883.\n\nHarry Jarman continued the photographic business at 16 Abbeygate Street for many years until it was taken over by his son, Oswald Jarman. Many early Spanton negatives survive in the Spanton-Jarman collection in the Suffolk Record Office, thanks to O G Jarman.\n\nSaracens Head\n\nblank At 63 to 65 Guildhall Street, the Saracens Head inn closed down, owing to the bankruptcy of Bishop's Brewery. The Great Head, as it was often known, dated back well into the 18th century and had included the Brewery for 'Bishop's noted Bury Ales'. When put up for sale, there was no bid for the Brewery, or the Saracens Head and its first tied house, the nearby Golden Lion. The other tied house was the Coach and Horses in Honey Hill, and this was withdrawn from sale at a bid of Â£1,800. Later the empty Saracen's Head became home to the British Legion Club.\n\nWhen this inn and brewery shut down in 1901, other independent inns like the Coach and Horses in Honey Hill had to get their beer elsewhere. The Coach and Horses now bought beer from Hudson's Brewery in Cambridge. The Coach was ideally located to serve the courts, and both witnesses and barristers were often to be found there.\n\nHudson's brewery already had a presence in Bury. It owned the Red Lion in Ipswich Street, for example, first set up in the 1860's. It would let it to Clarke's Risbygate Street Brewery in 1905.\n\nBarton Hall\n\nblank On 2nd December 1901 Frank Riley Smith and his wife moved house from Saxham Hall to Barton Hall in Great Barton Park. Smith had taken a lease from Sir Henry Bunbury in January, and had spent a year before moving in, extending and improving the house and the stables. Electricity was installed for lighting, and a Deer Paddock was built, along with kennels to house his hounds. The Riley Smiths would occupy Great Barton until 1912, when Frank died.\n\nThe County School\n\n1902 The Education Act of 1902 gave County Councils the status of local education authorities for the first time, greatly expanding their powers and their expenditure. The School Boards were abolished, and their schools given to the Counties. County Councils also now had to pay the salaries, and provide new equipment for, the Voluntary Schools.\n\nIn 1902, the West Suffolk County School was opened in Northgate Street in Bury. A large red brick house had been purchased for the purpose, and altered and improved. At this time it was for girls and boys, with separate playgrounds.\n\nUnder the same Act, urban areas of a certain size were empowered to become separate Elementary Education Authorities. In Suffolk, both Bury St Edmunds and Lowestoft opted for this route. Thus the 12 elementary schools in Bury became governed by the Borough Education Committee, while the town's secondary education was provided by the County ratepayers.\n\nWithin a few years it was normal for half a county's budget to be devoted to education. The next major Education Act would come in 1944.\n\nErnie and his new cycle\n\nblank In 1902 the Post Office introduced new regulations covering Picture Postcards. Since pictures were first allowed in 1894, one whole side of the postcard had had to be reserved for the name and address. In 1902 the modern format was introduced where one whole side could be used for the picture. Message and address now shared the other side. In addition the standard size of a card was increased to what it is today. On the face of it, this change seems to be of little consequence to us today, but in fact this change led to a vast production of picture postcards covering a wide range of views. Individuals could commission a few pictures of themselves with family, or as this illustration shows, a new object of pride to the owner. Many of these everyday scenes had little apparent merit at the time, perhaps, but are packed with information for modern eyes to consider. Many of the illustrations used in this Chronicle and other historical books come from photographs produced for postcards.\n\nExcavating the Abbey\n\nblank In the Autumn excavations were started on the ruins of the abbey of St Edmund. Dr M R James had discovered a 15th century register from the abbey in the public library of the French town of Douai. It listed the burial places of 18 of the abbots, and this gave rise to the dig. On New Year's Day, 1903, the five stone coffins were found, described by an excited Horace Barker as \"the great discovery\". The coffins were, at the time, located in the garden of a Mr Henry Donne. On 27th January, 1903, the remains were reinterred under new lids paid for by Donne. The work was carried out by Hanchets the stone masons.\n\nCoffins of Five Abbots\n\nblank Horace Barker, who was the curator at Moyse's Hall museum, could write to the Bury Free Press in 1912 that, \"It will be within the memory of most inhabitants of Bury that in 1902-3 all that is left of the Chapter-house was exposed, and the skeletons of five Abbots, including the great Abbot Sampson (1182-1211), each in its own stone coffin, were discovered. Many pieces of carved, coloured and gilded stone with fragments of marble tiles and glass are preserved in Moyse's Hall Museum\".\n\nM R James in 1900\n\nblank M R James was a fellow of King's College Cambridge, and had come to Great Livermere as a boy in 1865, when his father was appointed Rector of Great and Little Livermere. After a brilliant academic career, he became a world authority on religious writings, seeking out and cataloguing over 6,000 manuscripts. It was during his investigation of manuscripts in France that he came across the references to the burials of the abbots of St Edmundsbury. He had another claim to fame as a writer of ghost stories.\n\nMayor's Coronation Medal\n\nblank Despite the date on the attached medal, King Edward VII was not crowned until August 1902.\n\nThe coronation was scheduled for 26th June, 1902, and all the commemorative items were given this date. At Bury St Edmunds the Mayor, Thomas Shillitoe, decided to issue all the schoolchildren with a commemorative medal, and the June date was placed on it. Unfortunately the King was taken ill in June, and was operated on for appendicitis only a few days before the ceremony was due to take place. The coronation could not take place until August 9th 1902. His wife, Alexandra of Denmark, became Queen. Despite having received the disapproval of his mother, Queen Victoria, for his past hedonistic lifestyle, he was to be a very popular king.\n\nPawsey's shop Coronation, 1902\n\nblank This picture shows the shopfront of Pawsey's printers premises in Hatter Street decorated for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on August 9th, 1902. Similar celebratory decorations were seen across the town, and, indeed, across the country.\n\nA well remembered enamel sign advertising Stevens Ink, based upon a giant thermometer, can be seen to the left of the shop window. It survived in good condition until about 1979, when it was stolen.\n\nSimilar reorganised celebrations were held in many villages in the county. At Great Barton a committee had been formed, chaired by Frank Riley Smith of Barton Hall, to raise money and organise the celebrations. Some 500 people were entertained at the fete and refreshed in a marquee on the lawn of Barton Hall. Presents and mementos were given out and the evening ended with fireworks. This level of entertainment was continued by the Riley Smiths for village children at every Christmas and special occasion through until 1912.\n\nFrom 1902, the Feoffment Trust had to sell off much of its property, starting with the outlying farms.\n\nH Rider Haggard published his book \"Rural England\", giving an account of much local agriculture. At Culford Estates he found that about half the total area was set aside for shooting, or about 5,000 acres. Labourers were paid 12 to 14 shillings a week and cottages were let at 1s/1d a week. Southdowns and Suffolk sheep were the most profitable agriculture possible on the sandy soils. Both these and the Jersey cows were prizewinners. The estate also had a forestry enterprise.\n\nNewmarket New Station\n\nblank In 1902 Newmarket had its own thriving rural industry, namely horse training and racing, as it still does today. This now required a third railway station to be built to serve that town. The first station, which was a grand building in a Baroque style, was a terminus station built in 1848 at the point where the current line enters the Warren Hill tunnel at the Cambridge end. It was subsequently extended when the through line and the tunnel to Bury St Edmunds were built. In 1885 a second station was built at the northern end of the Warren Hill tunnel. By 1902 the vast amount of horse and horse-racing traffic on the railway meant that the original 1848 station was unable to cope and the Great Eastern Railway built a third grand station, as shown in this postcard. The sender's note on the front shows his admiration for it. Naturally, it was called New Station at the time. The 1848 station would be closed for goods traffic in 1967 and the one at the north end of Warren Hill also closed too. At some point in the recent past this \"new\" station closed to passengers too, and the current and fourth station is a small affair reached by a side alley off Green Road. The old station buildings had been converted to offices by 2008.\n\nThe West Suffolk Hospital received a new operating theatre and other improvements out of a bequest of Â£7,600. By now the hospital had four wards and room for 84 in-patients.\n\nFor the men of the Suffolk Regiment, the ending of the three years of the Boer war at the end of May, 1902, led to the Battle honour of \"South Africa 1899 - 1902\". The South African War, as it was known at the time, would be commemorated by the fine monument erected in 1904, on the Cornhill. There were to be 194 names of the fallen, representing the whole of Suffolk, east and west.\n\nAdolphe Goldschmidt bought Cavenham Hall, newly built only four years earlier. His son Frank later became MP for Stowmarket and district in 1910. His grandson James Goldsmith founded Cavenham Foods and later the Referendum Party. The family sold Cavenham estate in 1921.\n\nThe executors of Thomas Lucia had been running the Bury Free Press since the death of Lucia, 16 years earlier. In 1902 the newspaper was sold to Richard Winfrey, a noted newspaper owner in the eastern region. He formed the Bury St Edmunds Printing and Publishing Company to hold and manage the paper as part of his publishing empire. This empire would evolve into Emap, the East Midlands Allied Publishing group.\n\nFrom 1902 to 1934 there was a Methodist Congregation at the Congregational Chapel which stands on the corner of Looms Lane and Northgate Street. The main Methodist Church was well established not far away in Brentgovel Street, but the Primitive Methodists would not join the Wesleyan Methodists until 1934.\n\nIn 1902 Greene King owned and leased 70 pubs and off licenses in Bury, and 180 in the Country trade roundabouts, all supplied from Bury. The company also owned 128 houses further afield which were supplied from local depots fed by railway from Bury. They had centres at Ely, Fakenham, Colchester, Haverhill and Stowmarket. The company continued to expand by acquiring new pubs, aiming at Suffolk Essex and Cambridgeshire.\n\nFrank Riley Smith, MFH\n\n1903 In February the Suffolk Hunt held its Annual General Meeting in Bury, as usual. The hunting had been poor for a couple of seasons, and this was put down to the rise in the shooting fraternity, and the subsequent shooting and trapping of foxes. In 1902 the Master, Eugene Wells of Buxhall Vale, and the Secretary, Lt Col Josselyn of Fornham Priory, had even felt obliged to resign over the issue, but had been persuaded to continue by Sir Walter Greene.\n\nIn the absence of Sir Walter, Alderman Lake took the chair and invited Frank Riley Smith of Great Barton Hall to become the new Master of Foxhounds.\n\nToday, hunting with dogs is illegal, but a century ago it was not only normal, but was a big industry, generating trade and employment on a large scale. Frank Riley Smith was typical of the industrialists who were taking over the country estates. Like Sir Walter Greene his fortune derived from brewing, not from the ownership and renting out of land, like the old aristocratic families had enjoyed. The Bunbury's had retrenched to a smaller estate at Mildenhall, leaving Smith to invest large sums in Barton Hall and estate which he leased from them.\n\nSuffolk Foxhounds at Barton Hall\n\nblank Riley Smith enjoyed shooting and riding to hounds. He hunted the fox with the Suffolk Hunt, the otter with the Essex Otter Hounds, often in the vicinity, and the deer with his pack of Staghounds. Although otters and foxes were killed in the hunt, the deer never were. They were kept in paddocks on some large estates, and then transported to wherever the hunt was to take place. Once cornered they were carefully trapped and returned home. Curiously these deer were given individual names and were hunted for as long as ten years, being prized for their speed and cunning.\n\nAn example of the Essex Subscription Otterhounds hunting in the area took place in 1903 when they met at Tollgate Bridge on the River Lark, just outside Bury. Mr and Mrs Riley Smith attended this hunt. The area was suitable otter habitat at the time, and the hunt began by drawing towards the town. They then turned downstream and caught a large dog otter at Lackford Bridge weighing 24 pounds.\n\nBecause of his new commitment to the Suffolk Hunt, Riley Smith's staghounds were now passed on to Eugene Wells at Buxhall Vale. The deer in paddocks at Sir Walter Greene's place at Pakenham and at Great Barton were retained, but Wells could use them as he wished.\n\nIn June, following three days of extremely heavy rain, the river at Haverhill overflowed and large parts of the town suffered serious flooding, particularly Queen Street and Withersfield Road. At the Hamlet end the water reached the entrance to Atterton's foundry.\n\nThe rain had begun on mid day Saturday June 13th, continued all through Sunday and on into Monday the 15th. By leaving off time at the factory at 6pm on Monday 15th June, workers could not get home to Withersfield Road. The waters were at their peak at 9.30 pm, and had completely receded by 2 am next morning.\n\nIn the 27th June issue of the South West Suffolk Echo there was an advert which said, \"The Great Flood at Haverhill. June 15th , 1903. Such a flood may not occur again in your lifetime. You should therefore, secure for yourself and your friends a souvenir of the event by purchasing some of the pictorial postcards shewing Queen Street and the Meadows under water. Price-One Penny each.\"\n\nOne result of the neglect of the Lark Navigation was a return of the flooding along that river that had been alleviated by the works after 1890. The river was becoming clogged up again. On December 12th 1903 the meadows were seriously flooded in Bury St Edmunds, causing a debate at the Bury Borough Council. Alderman Hooper described the canoe journey necessary to cross these meadows near the railway bridge.\n\nProtestant Martyrs Memorial\n\nblank The Martyrs' Memorial was unveiled by the Dean of Canterbury in the Churchyard at Bury on 23rd December, 1903. It was made to commemorate the 17 Protestant Martyrs who died in the town under the rule of Queen Mary, 1555 to 1558. It was erected by public subscription, and was designed and executed by A H Hanchet, Monumental Mason of Cemetery Road in Bury St Edmunds.\n\nIn Churchgate Street fire destroyed Hervey's the Grocers. It was replaced by a three storey mock Tudor building, which Marlow's would occupy in 1925.\n\nDuring 1903 the Library of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology was removed from the Athenaeum into Moyse's Hall Museum. It would rest there for 30 years, and then return to the Athenaeum. In 1946 it was moved into the School of Art building in the Traverse, in the next room to the Cullum Collection of Books.\n\nBuffalo Bill's Wild West Show came to Bury.\n\nJarman's at 16 Abbeygate Street\n\nblank The photographer John Palmer Clarke moved to Cambridge from Bury, and sold his collection of local negatives to Harry Jarman, who had a photography business at 16 Abbeygate Street.\n\nMeanwhile the firm of Frederick Pawsey, at the time called Langhorne, Pawsey and Co., also began publishing postcards in 1903. Pawsey was born in Bury in 1870, and took over his printer's and stationer's business at the early age of 15 years old. He would die in 1953, but the Pawsey business lasted in Hatter Street until 1991. Pawsey would really make his mark in 1907, when he would publish a major photographic work on West Suffolk.\n\nMontgomery Sidecar November 1903\n\nblank In November, 1903, this advertisement appeared in the magazine, \"The Motor\". It demonstrates that William Montgomery, trading as Montgomery and Co, at 6 Brentgovel Street, Bury St Edmunds had effectively invented the motor cycle sidecar. At the time he called it a patent side carriage attachment.\n\nHitherto, Montgomery had run his business as a bicycle shop, which included the supply and maintenance of that popular form of transport, having set up shop in 1892. However by the early 1900s he concentrated more and more upon the possibilities afforded by the motor cycle. Montgomery's entry in Wikipedia begins: \"Montgomery Motorcycles was a pioneering British motorcycle manufacturer. Originally based in Bury St Edmunds the founder William Montgomery was an innovator and is credited with the invention of the sidecar.\"\n\nThe Three Tuns stood opposite St Mary's Church in Crown Street, on the site of Lansbury House. In 1899 Greene King offered to give up the license, partly under pressure to reduce the numbers of licensed premises in the town, and partly from religious objections to its proximity to the church. However, this inn did not close until 1903. After it was demolished, the opportunity was taken to retain part of the yard as Tuns Lane, a narrow alleyway giving easy access to Church from Bridewell Lane.\n\nAnother license was given up by Greene King in the Traverse. This was the Exchange pub, known up to 1870 as the Three Bulls. This inn was mentioned in the Bury Post of 1791, and was probably old then. It had once dominated the Traverse, but competition, particularly from the Cupola House after 1850, led to a lingering death.\n\nThe Railway Mission\n\nblank In 1903 the Railway Mission was extended after only being in existence since 1900. There was a rapid growth with Sunday services, a Sunday School, Mothers' Meetings, Young Persons Groups and a host of activities at the Mission Hall. In 1903 the hall had to be extended by 10 feet, and a 30 foot extension was added for the Sunday School.\n\nYou can date this picture to after 1903 because the Mission now has eight windows along its south side. The original building of 1900 only had five windows on this side.\n\nMelford Church today\n\nblank Holy Trinity Church at Long Melford had suffered a lightning strike to its medieval tower around 1710, and the tower was subsequently demolished. A new tower had been rebuilt by 1725 in classical style in red brick. The red bricks had been covered in cement at some time, which in many places had broken away by the 1890s to give a scarred and ugly appearance. By the late 19th century it was considered that this tower was not appropriate for such a grand medieval wool church, and that it was sadly out of proportion to the rest of the building. In 1897, as part of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the villagers set up a committee to raise funds and appoint an architect.\n\nIt was decided to build upon the old tower, and so it was decided to chip away the cement cladding and replace it with decorative flint work with stone stringing and detailing. Also to add corner buttresses with stone facing, and the first stone was laid in 1898. The result was a neo-gothic design which matched the old style of the main church, but further appeals for funds were needed in 1900 to raise the height of the tower. On 14th October, 1903 the \"new\" tower of 118 feet was dedicated by the Bishop of Ely.\n\nThe pinnacles of the old tower were removed, (and now reside at Melford Hall), while the new, grander pinnacles were named Victoria, Edward, Alexandra and Martyn, in honour of the late Queen and the new royal family.\n\nUnveiling the Soldiers Memorial\n\n1904 The Boer War monument was erected on the Cornhill and unveiled on November 11th by General Lord Methuen. At the time, it was referred to as the Soldier's Memorial. This was a great military occasion, and the Suffolk Regiment fired three volleys. The Volunteers, the Loyal Suffolk Hussars, and the Grammar School Cadet Corps \"kept the Square\" with the Suffolks, and the rest of the Cornhill was packed with local people.\n\nThis postcard was published by Langhorne, Pawsey and Company.\n\nRegimental Retirement Homes\n\nblank This event followed the opening of two Regimental Memorial Homes in April opposite the barracks in Out Risbygate.\n\nThe following month King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra visited Bury. They had planned to stay at Earl Cadogan's Culford Hall for five days in December, visiting the great local families and shooting over the estates at Ickworth, Elveden and Hardwick.\n\nThey were accompanied by Arthur Balfour, the Prime Minister. During one shooting party Balfour decided to have a day's golf at Flempton. His host was Frank Riley Smith of Barton Hall, who had just been elected Club Captain for 1904. He remained Captain of Flempton Golf Club until 1911. Riley Smith also favoured the Royal Worlington Golf club, becoming Captain there in 1909.\n\nRoyal Visit\n\nblank When the Mayor of Bury St Edmunds heard of the Royal Visit to the area, he immediately invited the King to also visit the town. So Bury was visited on their last day, Saturday 17th December, and the King and Queen received an official address from the Mayor, Alderman E W Lake, outside the Abbey Gate. They arrived with a mounted military escort in Earl Cadogan's four horse barouche, an open carriage. The Angel Hill was fitted out with grandstands for 1,000 people, soldiers from the barracks lined the route, and Harry Jarman, well known local photographer, recorded the scene. The party drove through the churchyard to St Mary's church to see the tomb of Mary Tudor. On leaving the church the royal procession drove along Crown Street, up Abbeygate Street into the Buttermarket and Cornhill, and down St Johns Street and Long Brackland to the Railway Station. From here they took a special train back to London. This was the first visit of a reigning monarch since the visit by Charles II in 1668. The Bury and Norwich Post produced a souvenir edition on 20th December.\n\nThe West Suffolk County Council purchased the Shire Hall from the Guildhall Feoffees. The Assizes were held here three time every two years. There were two courts, the Crown Court and the Nisi Prius Court. It would soon become called the Old Shirehall, as work began on a new premises in 1906.\n\nMontgomery Silencer May 1904\n\nblank In May of 1904, William Montgomery was advertising a new motor cycle silencer design which he had patented. Montgomery and Co had their shop and workshops at 6 Brentgovel Street, Bury St Edmunds. The advertisement in \"The Motor\" also featured his patented design for the motor cycle sidecar, which he had already been actively marketing. His shop had opened in 1892 to sell and service bicycles, but within a decade Montgomery had turned his attention to motor cycles.\n\nCentral Bury 1904\n\nblank In 1904 a new 1:2500 scale base map was published for Bury. By the time of the 1904 OS map, there was an avenue shown across Shirehouse Heath labelled Northgate Avenue, and the road we now call by that name was labelled Norfolk Road. Similarly Avenue Approach was shown as extending across to the Klondyke, in front of Northgate Farm.\n\nIn 1904 and 1905 the West Stow sewage Farm underwent extensive additional improvements. This works served the town of Bury St Edmunds. Only the pump house still survives in the corner of West Stow Country Park in 2005.\n\nAt the Congregational Church in Whiting Street a memorial was unveiled to Elias Thacker and John Copping, who were hanged in 1583 for their religious beliefs, \"for disseminating the principles of independency\".\n\nSuffolk Show, Bury 1904\n\nblank In 1904 the Suffolk Show was held at Bury St Edmunds. This advertisement by Smyth's of Peasenhall, was for their world famous range of seed drills, developed early in the 19th century, and still doing well in 1904. The firm lasted until 1967.\n\nIn 1904 M R James published the \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquarian\". He grew up in Livermere and regarded it as his home, although he lived in as a Fellow at King's College Cambridge. Livermere Hall and its mere were the settings for some of his ghostly tales.\n\nStaghounds at Beyton Grange\n\nblank This postcard was sent by Reginald Walpole to Frank Riley Smith on April 10th, 1904. It depicts Mr F Riley-Smith's stag hounds at Beyton Grange farm in March, 1904. The message reads, \" Snapshot taken the last time you rode out at Beyton. I thought you might like to have one - Hounds just laid on. Reginald Walpole.\"\n\nAs Master of Foxhounds for the Suffolk Hunt, Frank Riley Smith also had new kennels, staff housing and stables built for the Hunt at Barton Road in Bury St Edmunds. The site later became taken over by the Electricity Board.\n\nIn October of 1904, following a fundraising year, the Great Barton Institute was opened by the Reverend Hodges, Archdeacon of Sudbury diocese. The Fundraising Committee was chaired by Frank Riley Smith of Barton Hall, with a Â£200 target. The site was given by Sir Henry Bunbury, and the foundation stone laid by Lady Bunbury.\n\nAllan Minns Mayor of Thetford 1904-05-06\n\nblank Until quite recently John Archer, elected Mayor of Battersea in 1913, was thought to be the first black man to hold the position of Mayor in England. However, the American Negro Year Book 1914 recorded that, âIn 1904 Mr Allen Glaisyer Minns, a colâd man from West Indies, was elected Mayor of borough of Thetford, Norfolkâ.\n\nNorwich and Norfolk Racial Equality Council (NNREC) and Norfolk Record Office have been researching the life of Dr. Minns (1858-1930), following initial research undertaken by Sean Creighton, a historian based in South London. The following is an extract from the \"Norfolk & Suffolk In East Anglia, Contemporary Biographies\", W.T Pike (1911), held in the Suffolk Record Office at Bury St Edmunds:\n\n\"Minns â Allan Glaisyer Minns, Alexandra House, Thetford; youngest son of the late John Minns; born at Inagua Bahamas, October 19th 1858. Educated at Nassau Grammar School and Guyâs Hospital London. MRCS Eng; Lond. Medical Officer Thetford Workhouse & Thetford District of Thetford Union, Hon. Medical Officer Thetford Cottage Hospital. Member of the British MA & Norwich Medico-Chirurgical Society; President of Horticultural Society; Mayor of Thetford 1904-05-06.\"\n\nThere were many inns and beerhouses operating across the country. Under the Licensing Act of 1904 regulations had been brought in to restrict new premises, and the Compensation Act of 1904 now allowed councils to close \"undesirable\" premises and those sites which were required for redevelopment. The council had to compensate the owners or tenants for depriving them of a living, from a fund raised by a levy on brewers. Over the next two years the local licensing committee would hold a survey of the town's licensed premises with a view to considering some for closure.\n\nCompanies like Greene King now considered disposing of less profitable premises in order to keep the better ones. Between 1905 and 1914, Greene King gave up around 36 licenses across East Anglia.\n\nOn the other hand, Greene King had found the sales of their bottled beers, begun in 1897, to have been very successful. So in 1904 they built a new Bottling Store.\n\nSangers Circus October 1904\n\nblank This postcard was by an amateur photographer known to us only as C.G.K.. He writes,\n\n\"7.x.'04 Sanger's Circus was here on Monday. I managed to get this photo of the lion, entering its cage, after going round the town on the top of the car.\"\n\nThere appear to be no safety worries or comments on the welfare of the lion.\n\nHorsetrough seen in 1916\n\nblank In 1904 Lady Malcolm presented Haverhill with one of its features which had been thought lost for ever. This was the water trough which stood for years on the Cangle Junction, until it was removed for road junction improvements in the 1960's. In 1998 it was returned to Haverhill.\n\nA large part of Atterton's works at Hamlet Green in Haverhill were destroyed by fire during 1904.\n\nThe bells of St Mary's church at Haverhill were recast or restored, and a new bell added to bring it up to a minor ring of six. One of the re-cast bells had pre-dated the Great Haverhill fire of 1667.\n\nMill at Bradfield St George 1906\n\n1905 Like the horse, even wind power had been slowly replaced since the late 19th century. Milling on a much larger scale was made easier by the introduction of steam power, and by internal combustion engines. The Great War would finish off many of these notable landmarks, but their demise was already in sight. This view of the Mill at Bradfield St George is by H C Cobbold, and can now be seen in the Museum of East Anglian Life.\n\nIn February 1905 Frank Riley Smith of Barton Hall, and MFH of the Suffolk Hunt, hosted a function at the Athenaeum for the landowners, tenant farmers and gamekeepers of the farms over which the Hunt ran. Riley Smith aimed to enlist these people in supporting the Hunt, and to reduce persecution of the fox by the shooting interests. The Hunt even kept a Poultry Fund which was used to compensate farmers for losses of poultry caused by foxes being nurtured for hunting. His leadership and generosity kept harmony amongst these conflicting interests until his early death in 1912.\n\nTypical of the Riley Smith generosity was the donations he made to the YMCA in Bury St Edmunds, which allowed them to acquire premises in Churchgate Street in 1905.\n\nWomen often led the way on issues in factories like Gurteens at Haverhill. A number of women workers walked out for a week at the end of February to get an extra 6d per dozen garments. This was on a government contract just won for making khaki uniforms.\n\nAn extraordinary incident happened on the Bury St Edmunds Borough Council during 1904 and 1905. Edward Lake had been elected Mayor in November 1902, and very unusually, was re-elected in 1903 and 1904. He had a long experience on the Council as well as being the Managing Director of Greene King's Brewery in the town. He had already made his mark by bringing forward many modern reforms to the council, both in works, like the Sewage Farm at West Stow, and the Electricity undertaking in Kings Road, and in financial and management procedures.\n\nIn 1904 the Council wished to appoint a full time Town Clerk in the Town Hall to manage the Council. The existing Town Clerk, Charles Salmon, worked part time from a local solicitor's office, and was also Clerk to the Urban District Council, and held other posts, as well. He refused to relinquish his office voluntarily, and announced that he would stand as a Councillor for the Abbeygate Ward. From his post he could attack any new Town Clerk's authority.\n\nEdward Lake retaliated by resigning his post as Alderman, and his Mayoral position, and contested the Abbeygate Ward election against Salmon. Lake was returned with a large majority.\n\nThe Education Authority arranged for the Feoffment's Commercial School to be closed, and its premises were amalgamated with the adjacent Poor Boys School.\n\nIn about 1905 the Andrews family suffered a further setback. Charles Andrews had been a junior partner in the Andrews ironmongers store, since 1901 called Andrews and Plumpton. Charles's continuing illness now caused the family to move from Greyfriars on Whiting Street, to a smaller home at 117 Northgate Street. By now there were five children and although they still lived a comfortable middle class life with servants, it meant that Sybil Andrews, the third child, grew up to be more self reliant and independent than might otherwise have been the case.\n\nMontgomery advertisement 1906\n\nblank Having previously been makers of sidecars, the Montgomery company of 6 Brentgovel Street in Bury St Edmunds produced their own motorcycle and sidecar combination in 1905. It had a 5hp V-twin engine and a wicker-work sidecar body that could be detached in two minutes according to their advertising. Connection to the machine was flexible on some models, thus allowing them to bank for corners. One advertisement showed a sidecar fitted to each side of a motorcycle. The advertisement shown here was included within the Borough Guide Book for 1906.\n\nFor the next few years they concentrated on their sidecars and sold motor cycles to suit them. In these early days of the motor bike it was normal for local builders to buy in engines and other parts and perhaps build upon their own frames and forks. Machines could in this way be built to a customer's own requirements.\n\nBy 1911 Montgomery would find that he was running out of workshop space in the cramped location in Brentgovel Street, and would be forced to consider a move.\n\nGlemsford's Water Tower\n\nblank The village of Glemsford had been given an Urban District Council under the Act of 1894, and with a population of 2,016 in the 1901 census, was one of the smallest UDCs in the country. Nevertheless it had the power to provide water and sewerage in its area, and in 1905 it set up a waterworks and a water tower to supply water to its inhabitants. Glemsford water tower was 45 feet high and the tank added another 15 feet. This tower was a prominent local landmark until it was demolished in 1962. While the 30,000 gallon capacity tower was at Tower Meadow, on Hunt's Hill, at a high point of the village, water was pumped up from a borehole situated 130 feet below, in the valley at the foot of Skates Hill. This borehole was itself reported in the press in October, 1905, to be 520 feet deep, so a powerful pump was needed to raise the water to the tower. The pump and its engine were described as \"an 11 hp oil engine and a 6\" x3\" three throw ram pump by Campbell Gas Engine Co of Halifax\".\n\nAlthough this installation was a significant feat for such a small council, it had its problems. There were 24 fire hydrants placed at various parts of the village. If the village suffered a fire the Surveyor had to be informed so that the pump could be started up to ensure an adequate supply of water for the firefighters. In addition the flavour of the water was disliked, and some people preferred to still take water from the brook. This flavour was variously attributed to the use of aluminium paint to prevent rusting of the water tank, or to the use of iron pipes. Glemsford would lose its UDC status in 1935 when it would be absorbed into Melford RDC.\n\nPart of the decline of Glemsford began when the old established horsehair and cocoanut matting firm of H Kolle and Sons went bankrupt and the firm closed its doors during 1905. First established at Glemsford in 1844, as recently as 1885 it had been employing 700 men and women.\n\nCaptain Hervey, RN MP\n\n1906 In the General Election of 1906, the Conservative Captain Frederick Hervey of Ickworth Lodge was returned for Bury St Edmunds as expected. He was the nephew of the 3rd Marquess of Bristol, serving for a year before becoming the 4th Marquess. However the election result was unusually close for Bury, with his majority of 434 votes. Hervey got 1,481 votes, and his Liberal opponent, Mr B Yates, got 1,047 votes. By modern standards, this is a low number of votes, but only men could vote at this time. Nationally there was a Liberal landslide and the rural areas south of Bury elected a Liberal.\n\nCharter celebration Medal\n\nblank In Bury, there were big celebrations from April 3rd to the 6th, to mark the 300th anniversary of the town's charter. A special medal was struck which had the town arms on one side and the relevant dates on the other.\n\nThe Charter Celebrations\n\nblank The charter of 1606 was read out on the steps of the Angel Hotel, and a large crowd gathered for the celebrations.\n\nIn 1906 the Labour party was formed in Britain, to represent the working man. But there was by now a movement to extend the vote to women as well.\n\nDuring the laying of the concrete pavement in Fornham Road, one of the two slanting buttresses of St Saviour's Hospital was destroyed. Nearby are the Mermaid's Pits, described in 1907 as having springs of clear water.\n\nGuide 1906\n\nblank During 1906 Edward J Burrow of Cheltenham was producing Number 37 of his series of Borough Guides, called \"A Guide to Bury St Edmunds\". It contained a potted history of the borough, together with a description of its churches, public buildings and local seats of the gentry. To the local historian its major importance is the attention paid to the advertisers within it. Burrow offered them as many pages they cared to take, and if they wanted photographs included, then Burrow would have them taken if none already existed. Thus there are many shops and businesses with a photographic record which might otherwise have passed unnoticed. Boby's engineering works had eight pages devoted to it, with the title, \"A Notable Bury St Edmunds Manufactory\". The article included one illustration and three full page photographs especially taken by the firm of Burrow. The Angel Hotel featured in four pages, as did Thurlow Champness. In fact the most notable feature of this guide is the profusion of photographs which were included.\n\nYou can examine this guidebook by clicking here: The 1906 Borough Guide\n\nA later edition of this guide, or a reprint, has the name of the booksellers F T Groom and Son of 17 Abbeygate Street, in Bury St Edmunds, on the front cover.\n\nIn Northgate Avenue the East Anglian School was given a completely new wing.\n\nOld Shire Hall\n\nblank Work began on alterations and additions to the Shirehall in Bury. The old Shire Hall had been built with a churchyard frontage in the form of a Greek Temple in 1841 and 1842. However, the site had been used for the administration of justice since 1579, when Thomas Badby donated the old monastic grammar school site to the Guildhall Feoffees for a Shire House. There had been many improvements and additions to the court premises over the years.\n\nThe Theatre in Westgate Street was re-opened following extensive renovations. It was described as handsome and luxurious and the wooden forms were replaced by crimson plush covered chairs \"in line with modern requirements\".\n\nIt was recorded in Burrow's Guide to Bury St Edmunds that the engineering works of Robert Boby in St Andrews Street was employing 300 men at this time.\n\nThe distinctive Virginia Creeper on the front of the Angel Hotel is said to date from a planting in 1906.\n\nAt Stanton on March 5th, the tower of All Saints Church collapsed. One church bell was kept in action by hanging it in a tree. A new belfry was built in 1956.\n\nThe Ship had been a beerhouse in Eastgate Street, Bury St Edmunds, since opening in 1855. It closed in 1906, and today it is Unwin's Wine store. According to Gerry Nixon's, \"Old inns and beerhouses of BSE\", in 1866 one Robert Miller was the tenant and his license was not renewed because of his intemperate habits. The owners were given 14 days to replace him. Mr Miller still has descendants living in the area today.\n\nLifeboat in procession\n\nblank On 16th July, 1906, the lifeboat came to town and joined the procession through the streets. Here we see it outside the Suffolk Hotel, but the parade also went round the town and down to the Angel Hill. To prove its worth the lifeboat was launched on the River Lark in the Abbey Gardens, and along the way collecting tins were passed round to the large crowds of onlookers.\n\nStone plaques of notable persons exist on several of our town centre buildings. They were first considered in 1906, as shown by this newspaper item:\n\nOn November 20th, 1906, The Bury & Norwich Post reported as follows:\n\n\"Arthur P Wheeler Town Clerk:- At the suggestion of The London Society of East Anglians, notable people such as Thomas Clarkson, Defoe, Ouida and Crabbe Robinson should be recognised........ To enable the matter to be more fully considered and an estimate made as to the cost of fixing the necessary tablets, I shall be pleased to receive any information as to any house in the Borough which has been so occupied, together with such particulars to give in relation there to.\"\n\nIn December 1906 the newspapers featured a coconut mat carpet made to cover the great arena at Olympia in London, It was many thousand square feet in area and was claimed to be the largest ever made in the world. It was sent to London by rail, and it is reported that it filled 37 of Harrod's pantechnicons and the procession of vans through the London streets was more than a mile in length. It was manufactured in Glemsford in Suffolk, and the London \"Express\" called it a triumph of British manufacture. Because of foreign competition coconut matting production would decline in Suffolk in the 1920s.\n\nPageant Souvenir\n\n1907 For two years, Archdeacon Hodges, the Vicar of St James's, had been planning a great pageant to celebrate the historical past of Bury St Edmunds. An American called Louis Napoleon Parker was hired to be the Master of the Pageant, a job he had experience of elsewhere in the country already. The aim was to explore seven historical incidents from Roman times down to the visit of Queen Elizabeth in 1578.\n\nArchdeacon Hodges et al\n\nblank This annotated postcard from 1907 shows the Mayor, Archdeacon Hodges, and others associated with the Pageant arrangements outside the temporary Pageant HQ on Angel Hill.\n\nThus in July 1907 the town held its Grand Pageant of St Edmund to commemorate the historical past of Bury St Edmunds. It was performed in the Abbey Gardens, and involved two thousand local people as actors, organisers, costume makers or stage hands. St Edmund was played by Dr Stork, and in a family like the Andrews of Andrews and Plumptons, the whole household were involved, including all the servants, and even 9 year old Sybil Andrews took part.\n\nNor were the surrounding villages and estates excluded from the undertaking. The Suffolk Hunt supplied many of the horses needed, as well as knights in armour to ride them. Frank Riley Smith of Barton Hall took the role of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, and his wife was involved in designing and producing many of the costumes.\n\nClick to view all twelve Mead postcards\n\nblank By now Rose Mead was well established as the best artist in Bury, having exhibited several times at the Royal Academy. As the whole town was involved in the Pageant it was no surprise that Rose became the Chief Costume Designer.\n\nA set of twelve watercolours were especially painted by Rose Mead for sale as postcards and a commemorative souvenir programme was specially designed for the occasion and published by the Connoisseur Magazine. Not only did F G Pawsey and Co publish Rose Mead's twelve colour postcards, but they also printed an astonishing set of 50 postcards from photographs taken of the Pageant by George Cousins. George Sebastian Cousins was the official photographer of the Pageant, with premises at 30 Buttermarket, Bury St Edmunds. Cousins actually published at least 28 individual pageant pictures in the style of postcards, but with plain backs, presumably to avoid problems with F G Pawsey. These can often be found postally used.\n\nTwo other Bury publishers of postcards, Fred Watson and J. H. Gill, produced cards depicting individuals and groups posing in their costumes.\n\nPageant Medallion\n\nblank A commemorative medallion was thought to be a desirable addition to the festivities for the occasion. These medallions were sold by the Bury jeweller Thurlow Champness (who, appropriately, played the Goldsmith in the pageant) and advertised in the local papers. The advertisements show that the medallions were made in two different sizes in gold, silver, silver gilt and bronze.\n\nThe central design on both sides is copied from a St Edmund memorial penny now in Moyse's Hall, which was given to the Borough of Bury St Edmunds by Mr John Hargreaves of Liverpool at the time of the pageant. The large A in the centre of the obverse probably stands for 'Anglia'. Otbert, named on the reverse, was the moneyer responsible for striking the coins. The location of the mint is not known.\n\nThe Suffolk Regiment provided the band, and a covered grandstand held 4,000 paying customers. There were six 3 hour performances covering July 8th, 9th and 10th.\n\nA film was made of the 1907 pageant and it was first shown in the Lecture Hall at the Athenaeum. The cinema was now coming to Bury.\n\nA more scholarly tribute to Bury's past occurred in 1907 when Lord Francis Hervey published his \"Corolla Sancti Eadmundi The Garland of Saint Edmund King and Martyr.\" This book, which Hervey edited and introduced with a long Preface, aimed to publish all the documents concerning the life and martyrdom of St Edmund which he could locate. This was an extremely comprehensive gathering of texts, which included the following:\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\n\nAsser's Life of King Alfred\n\nAbbo of Fleury - The Passion of St Edmund\n\nTranslation of Abbo into OE by Aelfric\n\nArchdeacon Herman's Book of the Miracles of St Edmund\n\nWilliam of Malmesbury's Acts of Kings\n\nGeoffrey of Wells\n\nRoger of Wendover\n\nJohn Lydgate\n\nAnd many lesser known authors\n\nHe included a number of Charters relevant to the saint, church dedications, coinage details, and a glossary. This collection brought together all the relevant documents needed by the historian or churchman wanting details about the saint.\n\nW E Guinness MP\n\nblank During 1907 it became necessary to hold a by-election, when the Bury MP, Frederick W F Hervey, became the Marquis of Bristol. The new Conservative candidate was W E Guinness, of the brewing family. As the Liberal government had refused to make any concessions to the Women's Suffrage Movement, the Suffragettes retaliated by opposing all Liberal candidates en bloc. Thus did Sylvia Pankhurst come to Bury to support Guinness, although she herself professed to support the Labour Party. The Conservative majority was doubled, and Guinness got his seat in Parliament.\n\nWalter Guinness had Suffolk connections which became closer when he acquired the Manor House on Honey Hill in Bury St Edmunds, together with other local property, after his election. Walter Guinness was born in Dublin, Ireland, the third son of the 1st Earl of Iveagh. His family homes were at Farmleigh near Dublin, and at Elveden in Suffolk. He would remain Bury's MP until 1931, and earned the DSO in 1917. He was created Baron Moyne of Bury St Edmunds in January 1932.\n\nNorman Tower 1907\n\nblank Pawsey's had been publishing postcards in Bury since 1903. In November 1907, F G Pawsey and Company, Limited, of 25 and 26 Hatter Street, Bury St Edmund's, printed and published their large book entitled \"West Suffolk Illustrated\". It came out as a fortnightly part work in 14 instalments, sold for sevenpence a part. When you had collected all the parts, you could take it back to Mr Pawsey to be bound into a large book. It consisted of a text entry for every town and village in West Suffolk, together with at least one photograph of each place. Many of these 500 photographs by George Cousins were also used for postcards of the area. Each part was compiled by Horace Barker, the curator of Moyse's Hall Museum, and its emphasis was on the history of the place, rather than its present condition.\n\nBarker reported in this book that the Pageant had proved a tremendous success, both artistically and financially. After payment of all expenses a profit of about Â£1,000 remained.\n\nCommemorating Charles Blomfield\n\nblank Another result of this local pride was a movement to have commemorative plaques put on buildings associated with famous people, formally launched by the Town Clerk in 1906. These included Daniel Defoe, said to have retired to Bury in 1704, Sir Thomas Hanmer, Sir G Pretyman Tomline, (Bishop of Winchester), Thomas Clarkson, and Charles Blomfield. Eventually there were eleven of these oval plaques installed. A twelfth plaque was rectangular, and was fixed to the ruins of St Saviours Hospital to commemorate Duke Humphrey. This particular plaque was commissioned and financed by Gery Milner - Gibson - Cullum, of Hardwick House.\n\nYou can view these plaques and their locations by clicking here:Plaques of Notable People\n\nMunicipal electricity\n\nblank Barker also reported in this book that the streets and public buildings of Bury were now lighted by electricity from the council's own electricity works. He reported that the water was excellent, the water works having recently been much enlarged with an additional storage reservoir of 50,000 gallons built at land near the West Road. In addition there was a high level tank of 70,000 gallons capacity. A wind motor had been erected for pumping.\n\nHowever, he wrote that the the depression in agriculture had impaired the town's former prosperity. But it still had considerable corn and cattle markets. There were several large maltings, including Gough's, Girardot's, and Boby's as well as Greene King's own for its brewery.\n\nThe St Andrews Ironworks turned out numbers of well-known machines, including Robert Boby's haymakers and his patent self-cleaning corn screening and dressing machines.\n\nAnother iron foundry was that of Cornish and LLoyd, located in Risbygate Street.\n\nThe Bury Free Press newspaper appeared every Friday, as it still does today. The Bury and Norwich Post was every Tuesday, but changed to Friday's later in the year.\n\nNew Shire Hall\n\nblank In the great churchyard at the foot of Honey Hill, the New Shire Hall was completed. The Shire Hall was built in an Edwardian classical style designed by A A Hunt of Bury.\n\nWilliam Spanton's comment on this new building was as follows:\n\n\"The old front of the Shire Hall, where William Corder was tried for the Red Barn Murder, was a brick and stucco copy of a Greek temple, and though absurd enough, had a kind of dignity which made it impressive. The present building is a piece of commercialism entirely out of keeping with its surroundings.\"\n\nCounty School extension\n\nblank The County School in Northgate Street received an extension. The West Suffolk County School and Pupil Teacher's Centre, as it was called, seems to have received its fine new frontage and hall at this time. The original school buildings adjacent had been converted from a large private house. Because of the special fired bricks used, the frontage and its name are still as sharply defined in 2006 as they were when installed a century earlier. Today these buildings are used as offices.\n\nLooms lane junction c1920\n\nblank Sybil Andrews recalled in her later years that at this time Looms Lane was narrow, with high walls on either side. On market days it was not unusual to meet a herd of cows being driven from market along Looms Lane, leaving pedestrians little room to avoid them. She would paint Looms Lane in 1921. The photograph here shows how narrow Looms Lane was at its junction with Northgate Street. The houses visible here in Northgate Street, flanking either side of Looms lane, have since been demolished in the 1960's for road widening purposes.\n\nHenshalls, the ironmongers, took over Jaggard's shop on the Cornhill, and were well known until closure in 1959.\n\nPeople still lived in fear of the workhouse as they entered old age. In practice the Thingoe Union Workhouse in Mill Road had been accepting paupers from the Borough of Bury St Edmunds Guardians since around 1880. But not until 11th November 1907, did Bury St Edmunds formally join the Thingoe Union. The new union was itself now renamed the Bury St Edmunds Union. The Mill Road workhouse was known to the poor as \"The Spike.\"\n\nThe Borough Licensing Committee had commissioned a survey of all licensed premises in the town in order to assess their suitability to continue. It was felt that there were too many poorly run licensed premises, and that removing the worst of them would be a good thing. Nine inns would be listed for possible closure, and this would make it very difficult for these businesses to be sold or continue in the long run. However, many others escaped being on the list, like the Three Crowns in Southgate Street. Despite being in a state of disrepair, and without accomodation for lodgers or stabling for horses, the Three Crowns would last another 25 years.\n\nThe survey had already caused the closure of the Fountain Inn in Whiting Street, which stood nearly opposite the Masons Arms at number 88 Whiting street. This inn was started in 1863 as the Heart in Hand, and got its license partly because it could stable 25 horses. In the 1890's it became the Fountain, and it was closed in 1906 on the grounds that the street was already well served for drinking.\n\nThe Golden Lion was one of the many inns which closed down in the early years of this century. It stood at 57 Guildhall Street, between today's British Legion club and Westgate Street. Like the Saracens Head it had also housed a sizeable brewery, reaching back to St Andrews Street. Some of these brewery buildings were only redeveloped into housing as late as 2004/05, but had enjoyed many other uses in between. In the late 19th century, J A Simmonds had proudly advertised his Golden Lion brewery in the 1889 Wilkin's Almanac as to the \"gratifying reports from ...the public analyst at Ipswich\", and that he was \"Contractor to the Suffolk General Hospital.\"\n\nDr William Sturge\n\nblank In 1907, a Dr William Allen Sturge came to live at Icklingham. In 1850, William Sturge was born of Quaker parents in Bristol, where his father, William Sturge, was a wealthy surveyor. He received his medical degree from University College, London, in 1873, but studies were interrupted by diptheria, followed by rheumatic fever. In 1876 he went to Paris to study with Jean Martin Charcot. It was in Paris that he met his wife, Emily Bovell, who was also a physician. Emily Bovell was one of the original half dozen women who gained admission to the Medical School of Edinburgh University, only to be physically ejected by the male students and faculty. Sturge was strongly liberal and was one of the keenest supporters of womenâs medical education. They married in September 1877 and returned to London to set up a practice together in Wimpole Street. He was appointed physician and pathologist to the Royal Free Hospital, and a lecturer to the Women's Medical School. In 1880 his wife became ill and Sturge decided to move to Nice, where he lived for the next 27 years during the autumn, winter and spring. He gradually became very well known and socially prominent as a physician on the Riviera and looked after Queen Victoria and her family during her four visits to Cimez. Emily Bovell died in her early 40's in 1885. The following year William married Julia Sherriff, who was his nurse in Nice. Julia was the daughter of a wealthy iron master in the North of England. Because of the summer heat in Nice, the couple used to take their holidays at this time of the year. Sturge was very fond of travelling. It was during his travels that he became greatly interested in archaeology and began to collect Greek vases and Palaeolithic and Neolithic flint implements.\n\nIcklingham Hall\n\nblank He had rheumatic fever in 1894 which recurred in 1899 and in 1907 he decided to give up practice and return to England. During his holidays he studied early Greek art and was a collector of Etruscan vases, devoting most of his leisure time to the study of archaeology. He settled at Icklingham Hall in Suffolk, almost opposite St James' Church, at the Mildenhall end of the village. He collected many of his flint objects from the fields around Icklingham, but also collected abroad, and bought other private collections. Over the next dozen years he would establish at Icklingham one of the finest private museums of flint implements in the world, all carefully classified and catalogued.\n\nHis collection eventually grew to include more than 100,000 pieces. Sturge was one of the founders and first president of the Society of Prehistoric Archaeology of East Anglia, inaugurated in 1908, with Norfolk-born journalist and keen prehistorian W. Grahame Clarke as Secretary. This society soon attracted a national membership, but it was not until 1935 that the local name was dropped to become the Prehistoric Society which still thrives in 2011.\n\nIn the winter of 1918 Sturge would fall ill of influenza followed by nephritis and subsequently die during March 1919.\n\nIn 1907 the village of Glemsford was relieved to hear that the firm of Arnold and Gould had opened its doors in the town to prepare horse hair for further processing elsewhere. Glemsford had a large labour force skilled in working with horse hair, and hundreds had been thrown out of work in 1905 when H Kolle and Sons had gone bankrupt and closed down. However, Arnold and Gould set up employing only 100 people. One or two other short lived horse hair companies would attempt to set up at Glemsford, but all would have faded away by 1937, when only Arnold and Gould would survive. They were still operating in 1996. Their work included washing, disinfecting, heckling and drying the horsehair, processing up to 100 tons a year.\n\nCurrent diocese areas\n\nblank At this time Suffolk was divided into the two counties of East Suffolk and West Suffolk, and was also divided between the Diocese of Norwich, covering East Suffolk and the Diocese of Ely which included West Suffolk. The growth of population had made the existing diocesan situation untenable for administrative purposes. In 1889 a conference of all the local dioceses concluded that Suffolk should have its own diocese, as should Essex. Nothing much happened until the Bishop of Ely announced his retirement in 1904.\n\nBy 1907 plans and proposals were drawn up to redraw Diocesan boundaries to change the three dioceses of Norwich, Ely and St Albans, into five new units of Norwich, Ely, St Albans, Suffolk and Essex. It was also proposed that Bury St Edmunds should be the seat of the proposed new Bishop for Suffolk. However, rather than calling it the Diocese of Suffolk it was decided that it would be called St Edmundsbury and Ipswich.\n\nIt would take until 1913 for all these ideas to be debated, argued over, and slightly modified so that the new arrangements could come into operation in 1914.\n\nWalton and Frank Burrell on ice\n\n1908 This picture was taken on January 13th, 1908, and shows Walton R Burrell on the right and his younger brother, Frank Burrell, skating on the frozen floods at Fornham St Martin. The man in the middle was the new carpenter at Hall Farm, who was in the Seaforth Highlanders, and is displaying his five medals. Hall Farm was the Burrell family farm, and although the field was frozen, it was not available for use by the villagers unless specifically invited by a member of the family.\n\nFirst pension day at Wickhambrook\n\nblank The Liberal Party had won a landslide victory in the 1906 general election, and embarked on a series of welfare reforms. In 1908 the Liberal government under Prime Minister Asquith introduced the Old Age Pension for those aged over 70. Old folk were paid 5s a week (the average wage of a labourer being around 30s. a week) to single men and women, and 7s 6d to married couples, on a sliding scale. The single persons rate applied to those over 70 earning under Â£21 a year; this sum could be collected at the local post office. The pensions were means-tested and delivered at a reducing rate until they were not payable at all if income exceeded Â£31 10 shillings. Amounts were intentionally low to encourage workers to make their own provisions for the future. The means test and a test of good character was to be administered by local committees.\n\nNevertheless there were many who had never claimed poor relief who were in fact eligible. Most were now willing to claim the pension which avoided the stigma of being seen as \"on the parish\".\n\nTown Guide 1908\n\nblank In 1897 the Homeland Association for the encouragement of touring in Great Britain, began a series of handbooks or guides to various towns and localities in Great Britain. Bury St Edmunds was number 56 in the series, and the first edition came out in 1907 to support the pageant. A second edition was required by 1908. It was written by a Mr Dutt of Lowestoft, but was adopted as the official guidebook by the Town Council.\n\nThe guide begins with the usual historical background to the town and its Abbey. The 1908 guide announced that the Theatre Royal is now open, having been reconstructed, reseated and redecorated by Mr Eade Montefiore, to make \"the prettiest theatre in East Anglia\". Montefiore also ran a Stage School on the Angel Hill, and owned a collection of 600 theatrical engravings.\n\nBury around 1908\n\nblank The new town guide also contained a street map of Bury, showing the main features of the town. There have been changes of street names over the years, one being St Botolph's Lane, which is here shown as Madam White's Lane. Kings road is still called Cemetery Road at this time, and the Council Water works and Electricity Generating Station are marked on its northern side. Barn Lane, off Eastgate Street is the site of a large Tannery, and nearby is the Eastgate Railway Station. The Gas works has had to expand to include a Third Gas Holder in Tayfen Road, but across Ipswich Street from the original site. There is large maltings in Etna Road, and the Station Hill is a large coal depot, fed by branch railway lines. The northern end of Cotton Lane is called Taylor's lane. There is a swimming bath behind the Theatre royal. The Plague Stone is marked accurately at the foot of Chalk Lane as \"Remains of Cross.\" Several farms still operate within the borough boundary and are clearly marked.\n\nSnow on April 24th\n\nblank There was a heavy fall of snow on Easter Monday, April 20th, and the weather remained unseasonably cold. Snow in April is not unusual, but in late April it is most uncommon. This postcard shows the unusual feature of snow and slush on April 24th 1908. The picture was taken at Fornham St Martin, and printed as a postcard. There is no publisher's name on the postcard, and it may well have been an amateur production by Walton Burrell, who lived at Hall Farm in Fornham. Next day, on April 25th, a blizzard raged across southern England. Oxford recorded 18 inches, its heaviest snowfall for the whole of the 20th century. Across the south greenhouses collapsed under the weight of snow and telegraph poles keeled over.\n\nIn 1908 the Territorial Force was formed under Lord Haldane's Territorial scheme. It was the forerunner of today's Territorial Army. It was set up on County lines and the 4th Battalion The Suffolk Regiment (T.F.) was established in East Suffolk at Ipswich and 5th Battalion The Suffolk Regiment (T.F.) in West Suffolk at Bury. The 5th Battalion was formed from the old 2nd Volunteer Battalion of local men. These Battalions were part of the Norfolk and Suffolk Infantry Brigade, itself part of the East Anglian Division.\n\nThe Suffolk Yeomanry, a volunteer cavalry force, was also merged into the Territorial Army.\n\nTown Hall fire damage 1908\n\nblank Bury's Town Hall, today called the Market Cross once again, was gutted by fire. It was soon rebuilt.\n\nCollege Square\n\nblank The Guildhall Feoffment Trust began to build College Square as Almshouses for rent to elderly people. They were opened in 1909 to replace several other old premises. These included four almshouses endowed by John Frenze in 1494 which stood in Out Risbygate and several endowed by Bartholomew Brooksby in 1564, which once stood adjacent to St Mary's church. In 1813 Brooksby's almshouses had already been demolished and replaced in Westgate Street. Eight others in Southgate Street endowed in 1624 by John Ashwell were also replaced by the College Square development.\n\nHospital Balconies 1908\n\nblank Mr Charters of Horringer Manor volunteered to provide the balconies at the Hospital in Bury which gave it its distinctive look for many years. These were needed so that patients with Tuberculosis, or TB as it was called, could get constant fresh air. Before penicillin was invented, fresh air was thought to be the only available \"cure\" for TB. St Peter's Church can be seen in Hospital Road in the background, and is the main part of this picture which survives into 2006.\n\nArchdeacon Hodges\n\nblank A portrait of Archdeacon Hodges, one of the prime movers of the 1907 pageant, was commissioned from Rose Mead. By the 1960s Archdeacon Hodges was largely forgotten, and the painting was found in the roofspace of the Borough Offices, somewhat the worse for wear. Luckily the painting was recognised as Rose Mead's reputation grew, and it was rescued and restored. For some years it hung in pride of place at Angel Corner. In 2002 it was moved into the Council Chamber at the Borough Offices, but in 2009 these premises were sold, and the Archdeacon went into storage once again. These days the artist is better known than the sitter, and Rose Mead's paintings are collected irrespective of their subject matter. She painted the archdeacon life size and the frame needed was ten feet tall. It was her most ambitious picture to date.\n\nOuida Memorial\n\nblank Marie Louise de la RamÃ©e died. She was better known as Ouida, the romantic novelist, and was born in 1839 in Union Terrace, Hospital Road. Although Bury born she quickly moved away, and had little affection for the town, but was a great dog lover. After her death in 1908 readers of the Daily Mirror subscribed for a memorial drinking fountain which was installed in Out Westgate, at the foot of Vinery Road. Originally it was in the road, but has now been moved out of the traffic, under trees at the roadside. A memorial plaque was also placed on the house in Hospital Road where she was born.\n\nThe Manor House in Honey Hill was bought by Walter Guinness, later the 1st Baron Moyne. He owned the house until 1933, and was later to be murdered in Cairo in 1944, where he was a British Government representative.\n\nRailway bus link\n\nblank In June 1908, the Great Eastern Railway Company tried to start a motor bus service to Stanton, and to Horringer, to help people in the outer villages to use the railway station, and to visit town. The service only lasted for 9 months. This picture is from the official opening on June 30th, 1908, outside the Angel Hotel in Bury. Various pictures of these buses exist from stops along the route, as they were a novelty at the time. This bold attempt at \"integrated transport\", as we might call it today, failed to pay its way.\n\nThe Colne Valley locomotive repair sheds were moved from Haverhill South Station yard to Halstead, taking the jobs with them.\n\nIn Southgate Street the Southgate Brewery closed. This was, in fact, a beerhouse which prior to 1886 had called itself the Jolly Toper. As Braddock's Southgate Brewery had closed down in 1868, perhaps this brand name was seen as available. In any case the Jolly Toper had possessed its own brewery since at least 1833, and may still have been brewing in 1908. This pub is now a home, number 13 Southgate Street, and Toper Lane survived for many years as a path from the yard to Raingate Street.\n\nOutside the Admirals Head 1903\n\nblank During the 19th century Long Brackland usually had three or four beerhouses open at any one time. These also changed their names as new landlords arrived. The Admiral's Head was a public house that stood in Long Brackland at the corner of St Martins Street. It was closed down in 1908, and demolished in later years. This photograph comes from Mrs Turner who is the small girl on her father's cart.\n\nOutside Wells, Short brackland 1908\n\nblank On October 20th, 1908. H W Wells sent this postcard to a friend, showing him outside his premises alongside the carts of two carriers. Wells apparently lived here as well, in Short Brackland, a location very handy for the town centre, for deliveries to and from his stocks of seeds, animal feeds and similar products.\n\nGreene King now began to use motor transport to deliver their bottled beers. In November it hired two Foden steam lorries, and it became possible to make two deliveries a day around Bury. Foden continued to make steam lorries up to the Second World War. Edward Lake now dispensed with two horses and a man at Bury, and a horse at Colchester. Deliveries could now be made to places like Haverhill much easier, as there was no direct rail link there. This was the start of long slow replacement of horse drawn transport, which still remained the main delivery mechanism.\n\nWest & East Suffolk particulars\n\nblank The Bury printer F G Pawsey had done so well with his book on West Suffolk, that in 1908 he published \"East Suffolk Illustrated\" along the same lines. The first part came out in August, 1908 and cost sevenpence, as did the remaining 19 parts issued fortnightly. The issue finished in September, 1909, and, as before, the photographs were taken by George Cousins of Bury St Edmunds. Pawseys issued a prospectus of particulars to promote further sales of the finished works. The summary page is shown here.\n\nSince about 1890 there had been two main football clubs in Bury St Edmunds. These were the Bury St Edmunds FC founded in 1874, and the Bury Alexandra FC founded around 1890. On 12th August , 1908 the two clubs agreed to amalgamate and would now be called the Bury United FC. The local MP, Walter Guinness, presented the new club with a set of shirts made up with black and white halves. The name Bury United would be retained until June, 1923 when the name would be changed once again to Bury Town FC.\n\nThe manufacture of horsehair products had been flourishing in Lavenham and Glemsford since the 1860s. In 1908 the Sheffield firm of Oddy's Ltd built their three storey horsehair weaving factory on the Brent Eleigh Road at Lavenham. Today this factory can still be seen but has been converted into flats. Oddy's gave work to 40 women under a foreman, who would weave horsehair on looms especially made for the purpose. They were paid upon completion of a 52 yard of woven seating, and every inch required 120 hairs to be woven together.\n\nEastgate Station closes 1909\n\n1909 In Bury St Edmunds, the Eastgate Street Station was closed down in 1909. It had only ever served passengers for Sudbury and Long Melford since its opening in 1865, giving Bury two railway stations and two stationmasters. Its closure was a cost saving measure. Passengers for this line would now use the Northgate Station instead.\n\nIn Spring 1909 Major St John St George Orde sold Fornham House, and left the small estate at Fornham St Martin, which had been the family home since the 18th century. Fornham St Martin Village Hall had been built in 1887 in memory of Sir Harry Orde, and in 1858 the only son of Captain Orde had been lost in the Southwold Lifeboat disaster. The family name remains on Orde Lodge at Fornham St Martin, dated 1870.\n\nIn 1906 Frank Riley Smith had stepped down as Master of the Suffolk Hunt, to be replaced by Guy Everard. After a two year break he returned as joint MFH with Wilfred Bevan of Plashwood in 1908. In 1909 at the Hunt Dinner, Riley Smith reported that the Hunt gave a great boost to local trade, having spent Â£4,000 in the last season, on items like hay, straw and saddlery. With the decline of the horse and carriage and the rise of the motor car, Riley Smith suggested that the Hunt would become more essential as a consumer of local hay and oats. In addition, large numbers were employed directly and indirectly in hunting. They had found 105 foxes, killed 50, and run 19 to ground. This was considered an exceptionally good number.\n\nLocal riders now decided to start a Polo Club in West suffolk. Frank Riley Smith was elected Club President, and a ground was laid out at Beyton Grange alongside the Stowmarket Road. In the first season there were 23 playing members and 40 social members.\n\nTwo picture houses opened in Bury St Edmunds to show the new silent films of the period. Charles Thurston opened Thurston's Grand Picture Palace in St Johns Street. Also in the same street, Ronald Bates opened the Electric Theatre. Both seem to have changed their names within a couple of years. The Electric Theatre became the Gem Electric Theatre, and Thurstons would become called the Rink Picture Palace.\n\nWest Stow hall had been near to collapse when its owner, Lord Cadogan of Culford Hall, commissioned William Weir to restore it. The work was complete by 1910.\n\nEarly in 1909, Edward Lake was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds. This honour was not for being Managing Director of Greene King's Brewery, which he was, but for an outstanding career in local government in Bury. He had been Mayor for six years, the Council's Chairman of Finance Committee and its Education Committee. He had led the modernisation of Council procedures, council accounting, sewage disposal and electricity undertakings, and was involved with the Hospital and with local Charities.\n\nThe Bury Free Press of 15th January 1909, said of him, \"Our present municipal position is largely what he has made it.\" Although he was respected for his drive and efficiency, he was not a well liked man.\n\nSpittle Houses and plague stone\n\nblank At this time the plague stone was in Risbygate Street, but was in front of a row of 4 almshouses at the foot of Chalk Road, as shown on this Pawsey's postcard of 1907. Cornishâs brass foundry had been set up on land behind these almshouses and in 1909 the company, by now called Cornish and Lloyds, bought the 4 Spital Almshouses in order to demolish them and expand their premises.\n\nThe plaque on the wall behind the plague stone reads as follows: \"ENDOWED BY / THE REVD JOHN FRENZE/ MCCCCXCIV, (1494)\". The date 1606 is seen to the left bottom and something over 1672 at the bottom right.\n\nWarrenâs map of 1776 Refers to this row as âJohn Franzes Spittle Housesâ, and Chalk Road was not called Chalk Road on the 1776 map, but was labelled âSpittle House Laneâ.\n\nPlaque at College Square\n\nblank The proceeds from the sale of the John Frenze almshouses went to the Guildhall Feoffment Trust, and the money was used to help build twenty new almshouses in College Lane, now known as College Square. Perhaps because of the diverse sources of funds for this new venture, the square was treated as three separate blocks with separate oversight. In the Council Yearbook for 1930-31, these were described as:\n\nSix Almshouses College Lane, (West Block) Inspection Committee Messrs H W Lake and A R Christopherson;\n\nSix Almshouses College Lane, (East Block) Inspection Committee Messrs J S Gough a"
