The Breakers, who last participated in the NBA preseason in 2019, will play their fourth and fifth NBA preseason games when they visit the Trail Blazers on Oct. 10 at Moda Center and the Jazz on Monday, Oct. 16 at Vivint Arena. All four games are scheduled to be broadcast live for free on Kayo Freebies.\n\nThe Trail Blazers feature Australia Men’s National Team member Matisse Thybulle and former Breakers player Rayan Rupert, the 43rd overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, who helped the Breakers reach the 2023 NBL Finals. Rupert is also the fifth NBL Next Star – the NBL’s player development program for top prospects – to be drafted directly from the NBL into the NBA, following LaMelo Ball (Charlotte Hornets), R.J. Hampton (most recently with the Detroit Pistons) and the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Josh Giddey and Ousmane Dieng. Former NBL player Xavier Cooks, a two-time NBL champion and the 2023 NBL MVP, will face the Taipans as a member of the Wizards.\n\nA record 10 Australian players were among the 120 international players on opening-night NBA rosters last season, and 14 players with NBL experience played in the NBA last season.
