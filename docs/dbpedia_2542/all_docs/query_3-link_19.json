        "text": "With campaigns at stake, the fact the Breakers and Bullets had split their two previous meetings this season, and that this would be longtime Breaker Tom Abercrombie’s last regular season game at home, it was as high-tension a clash as a fan could hope for at this point of the season.\n\nThe shots were falling, but it was the Breakers’ effort that was making the difference. Playing every possession like it could be the one that gets them over the line, they outhustled the Bullets and frustrated them.\n\nBut they also got contributions across the rotation, with eight of the nine players to take the floor getting on the score sheet - five scoring in double figures. Though – as is a constant of the team’s season – foul trouble was an issue as they also had four players finish one foul away from being ejected.\n\nIt got off to a great start for the Breakers, too. Point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright was proving to be something of an enigma for the Bullets. Using his speed to weave through the defence, the reliable import put 10 points on up in the first quarter but also picked out teammates for easy buckets.\n\nDefensively, the hosts made a strong start as they didn’t allow Brisbane to get anything easy. Drawing two early offensive fouls on Brisbane big man Tyrell Harrison certainly didn’t hurt the Breakers’ cause in the opening stanza as they closed out the quarter with a five-point lead; a buzzer-beating three from Chris Smith edging the Bullets closer.\n\nAs the Bullets worked it back to a one-possession game with just under six minutes left in the half, the tension on the court began to boil over. Breakers defensive ace Izayah Le’afa and Bullets guard Nathan Sobey had to be separated by the referee before Finn Delany appeared to get under the skin of 2014 NBA champion Aron Baynes moments later.\n\nAs Delany was running back on defence, he made a point of bodying up on Baynes, who was momentarily alone at the other end of the court. That led to the two exchanging words as Delany moved out to mark the ball-handler.\n\nIt didn’t end there. Baynes set a hard screen as Delany tracked the ball, sending the Breakers guard to the floor. It was called for an offensive foul, and Baynes left the court having picked up his second foul as Delany applauded from the hardwood.\n\nIt was one of several impactful moments Delany had in the quarter as the Breakers rebuilt their lead to a comfortable 15 points by halftime; with the exclamation point put on the quarter through a buzzer-beating three from Abercrombie.\n\nThe second half followed a similar pattern. Brisbane made solid starts to the third and fourth quarters to eat into the Breakers’ lead, but the hosts went on with the job and closed out a comfortable, and crucial, win.\n\nNZ Breakers 103 (Parker Jackson-Cartwright 27 points, Zylan Cheatham 19)\n\nBrisbane Bullets 87 (Josh Bannan 29 points, Nathan Sobey 16)\n\n1Q: 26-21. HT: 55-40. 3Q: 75-63."
