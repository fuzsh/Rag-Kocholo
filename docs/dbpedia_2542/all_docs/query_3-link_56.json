        "text": "Game Details\n\nPerth Wildcats vs NZ Breakers\n\n4.30pm WST Monday 14 March @ Nissan Arena\n\nWatch LIVE on ESPN – available via Kayo or Foxtel\n\nContext\n\nThis will be the third game of the Perth Wildcats triple-header round. It also represents their final road game of the season – their 14th consecutive away from Perth. However, it won’t be played on their opponent’s home court either, with the Breakers calling Tasmania home for the time being due to COVID. The Wildcats are 8-5 on the road and 12-6 for the season – which sees them in second position on the ladder. The NZ Breakers have had a tough run and sit on four wins from 17 games. This will be the first matchup between the Wildcats and Breakers this season.\n\nPre-game words\n\nScott Morrison on his team’s road record.\n\n“Our goal is to be 9-5 on the road. It’s not going to be easy, I told the guys in the locker room and different people have heard me say this through the season, New Zealand are one of the teams I’ve been the most scared of all season. I think they’re really talented, they have a good back court, a good front court. They’ve had tough luck, which hasn’t made things easy for them but I believe they’re back at full strength today, so we’re going to get their best effort and we better be ready to play or they’ll jump all over us.”\n\nRoster Availability\n\nNo change expected from the team that defeated Brisbane on Sunday. Kevin White, Matt Hodgson and Corey Shervill remain unavailable.\n\nOpponents to watch out for\n\nThe Breakers welcomed back stars Will McDowell-White, Yanni Wetzel and Hugo Besson this weekend. Wetzell leads the Breakers in both points and rebounds with 16.9 and 7.0 per game. Besson is being touted as a potential NBA player next year, averaging 14.4 points per game.\n\nLast time they met\n\nIt was last season, in May 2021. The Wildcats won 98-84 on the back of a Bryce Cotton 32-point 10-assist double-double. It was one of his five career double-doubles."
