        "text": "The NZ Breakers roared into life on October 1 2003, defeating the Adelaide 36ers by a single point in front of a sold out North Shore Events Centre. Professional basketball had hit New Zealand, with entertainment, action and excitement of the ANBL now a weekly experience in Auckland.\n\nOver the short 7 years of the club's history the Breakers have established themselves as a club who do things differently. The club values of One Team + Courage + Integrity = Champions are emblazoned on the wall of the Breakers' training facility and is the glue that binds the club together. \"Team is Everything\" is the slogan that the club lives by, and the unselfish, do it for the team attitude has become the club's playing style and image.\n\nThere is nothing like the atmosphere of a basketball game, especially when it's on our home turf at Vector Arena. This summer there are plenty of opportunities to get swept up into this fast-paced and exciting sport and back the boys in black as they speed up and down the court. This is an easy game to get into in a big way whether you're a seasoned fan or completely new to the team. Plus with high-flying basketball demonstrations and family-friendly entertainment every second between plays there really is something for everyone at a Breakers game."
