While conducting process reviews across the spectrum of the housing services function, his aim is always to improve the tenant’s experience of housing services by taking an ‘outside in’ view of the process.\n\nBill says that, throughout his career, he has been driven by the belief that everyone has the right to live in a safe and secure home where they can fulfil the long-term potential for themselves and their family while contributing fully to their community.\n\nOutside of work, Bill likes to explore the wonderful countryside around his Somerset home. He follows Liverpool FC and enjoys reading and cycling.\n\nJoan Swift\n\nI have been a tenant of PA Housing (previously Paragon) for 13 years and an involved resident for 10 years.

I have also recently joined the Housing Ombudsman’ Resident Panel.\n\nI am part of the PA Housing Scrutiny team and various other projects, including procurement projects. I have also spoken at national events.\n\nSince the merger with asra it has been vital to work with Residents from a wide geographical spread to ensure that we work together.\n\nFor most of my working life I was an administrator in various positions.\n\nI have three grown up children, grandchildren and a great granddaughter and love to spend time with them. My hobby is doing quite elaborated ‘doodles’ which I find is a wonderful way to relax.\n\nSimon Randall CBE\n\nSimon Randall has been closely involved with many aspects of housing as a solicitor specialising in housing, charities and local government. He was an elected member of a London Borough Council where he served as the Housing Committee Chairman and worked in a similar capacity on behalf of the former London Boroughs Association.

She was brought up by her father and aunt (her mother’s sister). Her aunt had the opportunity to come to the UK in 1954 as part of the Windrush generation and she took Monica with her. They settled into her new life in Brixton, South London.\n\nMonica went on to have three children of her own and, with housing being a major issue at the time, she was inspired to get involved. She wanted to have a positive impact and influence on social housing in the best way she could. This eventually led Monica to volunteer and become an involved resident with her housing provider, now known as Southern Housing.\n\nDuring her involvement which stretches over many years, Monica has held many different positions within the housing sector, including Chair of her landlord’s Resident Strategy Group. Monica was recognised for her achievements by being awarded an MBE in 2021 for helping to shape one of the most successful tenant involvement approaches in the social housing sector.\n\nMonica remains committed and dedicated to helping residents and improving resident services.\n\nMonica is delighted to be extending her knowledge of involvement in the housing sector by joining the TAROE Trust Board of Trustees.\n\nSteve Bladen\n\nHello! I’m Steven, a full-time carer and an actively engaged resident.\n\nAs a social housing tenant, I am excited to embark on my new journey as a trustee at TAROE Trust.\n\nDrawing from my first-hand experiences as a full-time carer and my active resident involvement in the community, I aim to provide valuable perspectives and insights as a “critical friend.”\n\nBy offering constructive feedback, thoughtful analysis, and meaningful suggestions, I aspire to contribute to the ongoing development and success of TAROE Trust."
