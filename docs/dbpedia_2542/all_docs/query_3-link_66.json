        "text": "New Zealand Breakers Basketball Tickets\n\nExperience the high energy of a basketball game with your New Zealand Breakers tickets from TicketSmarter. Basketball dates back to the late 19th Century when a gym teacher in Springfield, Massachusetts, came up with a game that would shape generations to come. We’ve since seen the emergence of different levels of the sport ranging from high school/ NCAA basketball to NBA basketball to international basketball. We’ve also seen the rise of leagues like the WNBA, D-League and Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nMost world leagues have formed from the foundation laid by the NBA (National Basketball Association). Players like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West set the tone for modern-day basketball. We’ve seen legends emerge like Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and Lebron James. The NBA has blessed fans with rivalries like the Los Angeles Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs, Detroit Pistons vs. Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nOn an international level, there is world competition in Olympic Basketball and FIBA (International Basketball Federation). Many modern-day athletes have come from other countries to dominate in the NBA like Giannis Antetikounmpo, Luca Doncic and Joel Embid. Countries like Spain, Australia and Argentina are amongst the elite in the world. Experience live basketball with your very own New Zealand Breakers tickets.\n\nHow much are New Zealand Breakers tickets?\n\nNew Zealand Breakers ticket prices can start around $15 depending on the game, seats you select and home venue.
