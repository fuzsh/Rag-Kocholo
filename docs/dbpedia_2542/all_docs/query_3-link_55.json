        "text": "Numbers plus entertainment suggest retaining Parker Jackson Cartwright is a must for the BNZ Breakers.\n\nRenowned basketball scribe Marc Hinton ranks Parker Jackson-Cartwright as the second best import that the Breakers have ever had behind multiple championship winner Cedric Jackson.\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/350198433/parker-jackson-cartwright-goes-so-too-do-nz-breakers-nbl-playoffs\n\nIt’s hard to pick between the singular Jackson and the hyphenated version as the numbers below tend to show but what is certain is that they are the two best import point guards to play for the Breakers. Ced J was arguably the better defender and Parker J-C the more talented at the offensive end of the floor.\n\nHere is a snapshot of some key numbers:\n\nAfter scoring 19 points in the season ending encounter with the Hawks Jackson-Cartwright became only the second Breakers player to score in double figure in every game of the season (30 games). The only other occasion was in 2006-07 when Carlos Powell scored in double digits in all 33 games.\n\nHe also becomes just the third Breaker to score over 600 points in a season (616 at 20.5ppg), following Carlos Powell who tallied 932 points in the 06-07 season and Kirk Penney who passed the mark twice. KP scored 749 points in 2007-08 and 747 points the following season.\n\nPJC has also averaged 5.8 assists per game, a number only bettered at the Breakers by Will McDowell-White last season (5.9apg) and Cedric Jackson who exceeded 6 assists per game in all four seasons he played for the Breakers.\n\nIn addition the 2024 All-NBL First Team pick led the league in steals pinching on average 1.9 extra possessions a game. Cedric Jackson also excelled in this area posting figures of 2.2, 2.8, 2.2 and 1.2 during his four prolific years with the club.\n\n2023-24 has been a stellar season for PJC and perhaps from a pure entertainment perspective it could be argued he is the Breakers greatest ever import. Let’s hope we see the LA native back with the club next season to embellish his numbers and once again thrill basketball fans on both sides of the Tasman.\n\nFrom schoolboy star to star Breaker and Tall Black below is a condensed look at the achievements of one of New Zealand’s finest basketball players. Diving into his formative years it’s easy to forget how much Abercrombie has achieved and how good a junior athlete he was.\n\n7 major Australasian championships, numerous Breakers all-time records, 100+ Tall Blacks appearances including 3 World Cup trips plus many other accolades and records broken in the past 20 years.\n\n2002 (Year 10) Westlake Boys Runners-up at Secondary Schools Nationals. North Harbour Runners-up at U18 Nationals – named to Tournament team.\n\n2003 (Year 11) Played for New Zealand Secondary Schools Team v Australia. North Harbour Runners-up at U18 Nationals.\n\nMember of Westlake Boys National Championship winning volleyball team.\n\n2004 (Year 12) Played for New Zealand Secondary Schools Team v Australia and NZ U18 team. North Harbour Runners-up at U18 Nationals – named to Tournament team.\n\n2005 (Year 13) Captained Westlake to Secondary Schools National title. Played for Junior Tall Blacks at the Youth Olympics in Sydney.\n\n2006/7 Redshirt Freshman at Washington State University – NCAA Tournament 2nd Round\n\n2007/8 Sophomore at Washington State University – NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen\n\n2008/9 Breakers debut.\n\n2009 Waikato Pistons NBL Champions – Named to All Star 5 and Most Outstanding Forward.Debuted for the Tall Blacks v Estonia.\n\n2010 Waikato Pistons NBL Runners-up – Named to All Star 5 and Most Outstanding Forward. Played for Tall Blacks at FIBA World Cup in Turkey.\n\n2010-11 Breakers ANBL Champions – Grand Final MVP..\n\n2011-12 Breakers ANBL Champions – scored a career high 33 points v Melbourne Tigers. Named to All-NBL First Team.\n\n2012-13 Breakers ANBL Champions.\n\n2014 Played for Tall Blacks at FIBA World Cup in Spain.\n\n2014-15 Breakers ANBL Champions – pulled down a career high 15 rebounds v Sydney Kings.\n\n2015-16 Breakers ANBL Runners-up.\n\n2017-18 Breakers ANBL semi-finalists. Had a career high 7 blocks v Brisbane Bullets.\n\n2018 A member of the Tall Blacks bronze medal winning team at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.\n\n2018-19 Moved past Kirk Penney (3,226pts) as Breakers all-time leading scorer.\n\n2019 Wellington Saints NBL Champions – Grand Final MVP. Played his 100th game for the Tall Blacks ahead of the FIBA World Cup in China.\n\n2020-21 Most games played for the Breakers passing Mika Vukona (354 games).\n\n2022-23 Breakers ANBL Runners-up.\n\n2023-24 Played 400th game for the Breakers in the opening game of his final season.\n\nIn his senior year at Westlake Boys High School (2005) he captained Westlake (35-0) to the NZ Secondary Schools National title. Played for the Junior Tall Blacks at the Youth Olympics in Sydney and at an Invitational Tournament in San Diego. He was also selected for the NZ Volleyball team at the Youth Olympics but had to withdraw due to the clash with basketball. He was a member of Westlake’s Swimming team and was the school’s High Jump, Long Jump and Triple Jump champion.\n\nFollowing the Game 5 Grand Final defeat in Sydney the curtain has come down on a hugely entertaining and successful Sky Sport Breakers season. Whilst the ultimate prize eventually eluded them the club can take immense pride in turning the disaster that was the 2021-22 wooden spoon into an almost successful march to the championship in 2022-23.\n\nThere were many memorable games during the season but for those present Grand Final Game 4 played in front of 9,742 fans at Spark Arena took the biscuit. Not only was it a record crowd for a basketball game in New Zealand but the atmosphere and passion of the supporters was spine tingling – it will live long in the memory.\n\nHere are the key numbers from the season:\n\nJarrell Brantley and Derek Pardon were the only two players to play all 36 games, rookie coach Mody Maor guiding the club to an overall record of 22-14.\n\nBrantley, the Breakers Most Valuable Player of the Year Award winner, led the scoring amassing 581 points with Barry Brown Jnr not far behind with 544 points.\n\nThe other main scoring contributors were Derek Pardon (424 points), Will McDowell-White (366) and Izayah Le’afa (359).\n\nTom Abercrombie’s defensive masterclass in Grand Final Game 4 in which he garnered 6 steals set a new career mark for the Breakers skipper. It also equaled the record held by another Breaker’s great Mika Vukona for the most steals by a Breaker in a play-off game.\n\nAbbo has extended his Breakers all-time appearance record to 399 games. He has also further extended the club’s all-time records in the following categories:\n\nPoints to 4,319\n\nBlocks to 215\n\nWins to 226\n\nIn addition he is second all time in rebounding behind Mika Vukona and steals behind Dillon Boucher.\n\nSurely Tom will be back in 2023-24 to play his 400th game and take those records to greater heights!\n\nWill McDowell-White’s emergence as an elite point guard was a joy to behold. In addition to his 366 points he dished 200 assists and pulled down 175 rebounds.\n\nHe now has 390 career assists in 78 games at exactly 5 per game. That moves the Aussie into heady company as only Cedric Jackson, with 6.4 dimes per game, has a better Breakers career average.\n\nThose 390 assists already place him 8th on the Breakers all-time list which is led by Paul Henare (901).\n\nDerek Pardon led the team in blocked shots (38) and rebounds (290). His 38 blocks in a single season have only been bettered by Ben Pepper, Ekene Ibekwe and Shawn Long.\n\nRob Loe has moved up the Breakers all-time list on a number of statistical categories during the season:\n\n66 blocks – 7th all-time\n\n145 appearances – 10th all-time\n\n68 wins – 11th all-time\n\n542 rebounds – 12th all-time\n\nRoll on the 2023-24 season only seven months to wait!\n\nMarch 10\n\nThere is all to play for this weekend as the Sky Sport Breakers take on the Sydney Kings in Games 3 and 4 of the NBL Grand Final with the five games series locked at 1-1.\n\nThe Breakers coaching staff and hierarchy have said nothing publicly but behind closed doors there must be some furrowed brows when they look at the box scores from the five NBL play-off games played to date involving the New Zealand team.\n\nAfter all there are a couple of statistical categories in which the Breakers trail alarmingly. Over the three semi-final games against Tasmania Jack Jumpers and Games I and 2 against the Kings they trail the foul count 119-94. By that I mean the Breakers have been called for 25 more fouls than their opponents – an average of 5 per game.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly the trips to the foul line see the Breakers beaten up badly – 137 free throws taken by their opponents to 107 by the Breakers. A differential of 30 opportunities or 6 per game or almost a third more for the opposition.\n\nIt was equally lop sided overall in the regular season against the Kings. In game 1 back in November the count was almost even with Sydney called for one more foul (23 to 22) and the Breakers visiting the charity stripe on one more occasion (30-29).\n\nGames two and three were a different matter entirely with the Breakers called for a total of 46 fouls compared with the Sydney-siders 27. As a result trips to the foul line were massively in favour of the Kings (55-32).\n\nMichaela Aylen and Vaughan Mayberry are the best two NBL referees, of that there is no doubt, and one or both have officiated the Breakers play-off games thus far. But even they might be surprised by the discrepancies that have occurred on their watch!\n\nLet’s hope the scales are more evenly balanced in the remaining games of this captivating Grand Final series.\n\nIt would be nice to put to one side the impression the NBL (and referees) favour the big market clubs in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nGo Breakers!\n\nWho could have predicted that in Round 16 of the NBL the Sky Sport Breakers would lose at home to the bottom placed team on the ladder and win on the road against the team at the top of the table?\n\nIn front of a crowd of over 14,000 the Sky Sport Breakers pulled off one of their more impressive wins of the season defeating the table topping Kings in Sydney 93-88 on Sunday.\n\nJarrell Brantley was immense piling on 30 points to accompany 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 3 blocks and a steal – his banked three with 15 seconds to play the game clincher.\n\nWill McDowell-White was equally impressive reeling off a double-double of 20 points and 10 assists, a performance even more meritorious given he had to carry added back court responsibilities given the absence of the injured Izayah Le’afa and Barry Brown Jr.\n\nEarlier in Round 16 the Breakers had gone down 78-76 to cellar dwellers Illawarra Hawks 78-76, the Breakers undone by a dramatic Tyler Harvey long range three as time expired.\n\nWith one home game to come, against Melbourne United on Thursday at Spark Arena, the Breakers record is 6-7 in New Zealand and 8-3 on the road. This means the Breakers, for the first time in the club’s history, will have a superior regular season away record than home record.\n\nPerhaps those 57 games played in Australia in the previous two years have provided the foundation for the successes on the road!!\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\nThursday v Illawarra Hawks at Spark Arena:\n\nDerek Pardon made his 8th double-double of the season producing a season high 17 rebounds (10 of those offensive) to accompany 19 points.\n\n2 points from French Next Star Rayon Rupert took him to 100 points for the season.\n\nSunday in Sydney against the Kings:\n\nDerek Pardon, with 11 points in the contest, became the third Breaker (all the three imports) to score 300 points this season.\n\nBrantley’s 30 points was a season best for the power forward and within a point of the individual high for the club in 2022-23 – Barry Brown Jr scored 31 against South East Melbourne back in December in Christchurch.\n\nMcDowell-White’s double-double was his fourth of the season.\n\nRob Loe and Cam Gliddon both passed the 100 points mark for the season, Loe also now with 901 points for the club – the 20th Breaker to reach the milestone.\n\nThe Sky Sport Breakers maintained second spot on the ladder with a pair of hard earned victories in Round 14 of the NBL.\n\nA 97-94 victory in New Plymouth on Wednesday night over the Perth Wildcats was followed by an equally tight 85-83 win in Adelaide – their third win of the season against the 36ers bolstering their overall record to 13-6.\n\nThe Breakers took the lead in the first quarter in Adelaide and led for the majority of the game thereafter but did have to withstand a late charge from the 36ers, who scored the last seven points of the contest.\n\nAfter missing the last two games with a broken finger the Breakers welcomed back Will McDowell-White to the line-up and he was his typical influential self with 10 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.\n\nAlso in double figures were Barry Brown Jr (16 points), Jarrell Brantley (15 points), Izayah Le’afa (13 points) and Derek Pardon (10 points).\n\nMcD-W’s return meant the Breakers had all 12 full roster players available for the first time this season at the 19thattempt.\n\nThe win against Perth broke a sequence of five straight losses to the old enemy from out west. Once again the Breakers had to withstand another strong performance from former clubman Corey Webster who scored 19 points – he, Bryce Cotton and Brady Manek combined for 71 points.\n\nTai Webster, signed by the Wildcats a couple of day prior to the game, was suited up on the Wildcats bench but didn’t take the court. Unofficial reports indicating his release from the Breakers, who held his NBL playing rights, precluded him from playing against his former club.\n\nThe Breakers were once again paced by Brown Jr who scored 23 points.\n\nNext Star Rayon Rupert made an eye catching return after missing the previous eight games with a wrist injury. The young Frenchman came off the bench to score 14 points in just 18 minutes of action.\n\nOther notable performances came from Pardon (13 points), Brantley (11 points and 7 rebounds) and Le’afa 18 points (7/11FG).\n\nBut it was Brown that was the star turn for the hosts adding 6 rebounds and 6 assists to the 23 points that came on 10 from 18 shooting.\n\nBrown Jr brought up his 300th point in 15 appearances. He’s the 49th Breaker to score 300 points for the club with only Carlos Powell (11 games), Kirk Penney and Mike Chappell (both 14 games) passing the mark quicker.\n\nOther Numbers:\n\nV Perth Wildcats\n\nTom Abercrombie’s blocked shot in the game against Perth was the 254th of his career drawing him level with Alex Pledger as the Breakers all-time leading “Blockers”.\n\nThere’s a slight difference in number of games played though – Pledge 238, Tom 381 !\n\nV Adelaide 36ers\n\nWill McDowell-White’s 7 assists sees him reach the 100 assists mark for the season at 5.9 per game. He now has 291 dimes for the Breakers in total – shortly to become just the 9th Breaker to dish 300 assists.\n\nThe victory in Adelaide was Rob Loe’s 59th in Breakers colours drawing him level with Gary Wilkinson as the 14thwinningest Breaker of all-time.\n\nUpcoming\n\nThe Breakers have a short turn around as they are in action again on Tuesday night, this time in Perth against the Wildcats.\n\nDecember 27\n\nHaving won the first three encounters with the Tasmanian Jack Jumpers the Sky Sport Breakers went down 93-82 in Hobart on Boxing Day to slip to an 11-6 record – still good enough for second place on the NBL ladder.\n\nAfter a Covid induced 18 day lay-off the Breakers looked a little out of sync. They gave up 18 turnovers and were out rebounded 45-29, with the differential on the offensive boards 16-6.\n\nThose two factors combined handed extra possessions to the Jack Jumpers who put up 69 field goal attempts to 55 from the Breakers.\n\nIzayah Le’afa led the way for the Breakers with 21 points (4/7 3PG), the second occasion this season he has scored 21 and the 12th time in 16 games he has made double figures.\n\nOther notable contributors were Barry Brown Jr and Jarrell Brantley with 16 points apiece although the latter was guilty of committing 7 turnovers.\n\nTom Abercrombie scored 11 points (3/4 3PG) while Derek Pardon coupled 8 rebounds with 10 points.\n\nIn addition Cam Gliddon played his 300th NBL game against Tasmania, the well-travelled veteran making all three of his shots for 8 points.\n\nOther Numbers:\n\nWith a pair of steals Tom Abercrombie took his career total to 254 moving ahead of Mika Vukona (252) into third spot on the Breakers all-time list in that statistical category. Ahead of him are Cedric Jackson (278) and Dillon Boucher (288).\n\nIzayah Le’afa became the fifth Breaker to pass the 200 points mark this season after McDowell-White, Pardon, Brantley and Brown Jr.\n\nJayden Bezzant, an injury replacement for Will McDowell-White, became the 142nd player to suit up for the Breakers – the ninth debutant this season!\n\nThe playmakers absence broke a sequence of 27 consecutive games by McD-W stretching back to the middle of last season.\n\n18 turnovers equaled the most the Breakers have given up this season and the 6 offensive rebounds the equal fewest they have garnered this campaign. Additionally Tasmania’s 16 O boards was the most the Breakers have given up since allowing the Jack Jumpers to pull down 21 in the second game of the season.\n\nUpcoming:\n\nBrown Jr, the Breakers leading scorer this season is only 12 points shy of 300 points.\n\nThe Breakers are next in action against Perth Wildcats in New Plymouth on January 4, the first of nine games in January.\n\nThe Sky Sport Breakers split their two-game Round 9 fixtures comprehensively beating South East Melbourne Phoenix 110-84 at Christchurch Arena on Thursday but coming unstuck at Spark Arena on Saturday evening going down 92-84 to Perth Wildcats.\n\nThe story of the Perth encounter was the display of a former Breaker. Corey Webster demonstrated that on his day he is one of the premier shot makers in the NBL. The three-time championship winner scored a team high 26 points on 10 from 17(59%) shooting.\n\nWebster poured in 16 third quarter points to put his team in the ascendancy then scored Perth’s last 4 points to seal the win. The fist pump at the final buzzer indicated the satisfaction the performance, and result, gave the shooting guard who played 236 games in a 10-year career for the Breakers.\n\nThe Breakers leading scorer this season, Barry Brown Jr, went one better than Webster tallying 27 points – his ninth 20+ score in 12 innings – but it was a night when Perth and C-Web took the honours.\n\nOn their way to two consecutive tons the Sky Sport Breakers posted 37 first quarter points against South East Melbourne Phoenix in Christchurch – the highest opening ten minute points haul the club have mounted in the 40 minute era which dates back to 2009.\n\nIt was also the first time consecutive 100+ scores have been posted since January 2019 when the Queensland clubs Cairns and Brisbane were walloped.\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\nBeat South East Melbourne Phenix 110-84 at Christchurch Arena on Thursday\n\nDan Fotu scored his first Breakers points. He scored 5 points in his sixth game of the season and seventh overall – he played once as a Development Player back in the 2017-18 season before he embarked on his 4-year collegiate career at St Mary’s College, California.\n\nBarry Brown Jnr, the team’s leading scorer made a season best 31 points, making 4 from 6 from beyond the arc.\n\nWill McDowell-White with 11 assists became the 11th Breaker to dish 250 assists.\n\nCam Gliddon scored 5 points to pass 3,000 career points. He sits 12th on the scoring list of active players which is headed by Adelaide 36ers forward Daniel Johnson with 5,971 points.\n\nTom Abercrombie (4,212 points) is third on the NBL’s active players scoring list.\n\nAbercrombie snared 2 steals to become just the 4th Breaker to pinch 250 steals.\n\nThe Breakers top five “Stealers”:\n\n288 Boucher\n\n278 Jackson\n\n252 Vukona\n\n251 Abercrombie\n\n209 Henare\n\nLost 92-84 to Perth Wildcats at Spark Arena on Saturday\n\nRob Loe played his 125th game for the Breakers drawing level with Oscar Forman in 12th spot on the club’s all-time games played list.\n\nDerek Pardon produced his 6th double-double of the season adding 14 rebounds to 13 points.\n\nUpcoming\n\nCam Gliddon will play his 299th NBL game against the Sydney Kings.\n\nIzayah Le’afa needs 3 points for 600 NBL career points.\n\nWill McDowell-White needs to pinch 1 more possession for 50 steals in Breakers colours.\n\nThe Breakers (11-4) are next in action on Thursday when they entertain Sydney Kings (9-3) in a clash between the top two teams on the NBL ladder – tip-off 7.30pm at Spark Arena.\n\n21 November\n\nThe 2022 edition of the Sky Sport Breakers seem to thrive on adversity.\n\nNot for the first time this season the team and staff faced minimal recovery time, due to flight cancellations and delays, before taking the court against well rested opponents.\n\nOn this occasion, having beaten the Tasmania Jack Jumpers on Friday night in Launceston, the Breakers had to overcome a chaotic return journey before eventually arriving in Auckland just over 12 hours ahead of the Sunday afternoon fixture against the Adelaide 36ers at Trusts Arena.\n\nIt was a game in which the Breakers trailed 80-78 with under three minutes to play, a situation where you would have thought the travel weary Breakers might fold. Instead it was the Auckland based club that found another gear outscoring the 36ers 11-3 in the closing minutes to close out an impressive weekend’s work and improve to 8-3 on the season – clear second behind the Sydney Kings (8-2) on the NBL ladder.\n\nBarry Brown Jr scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter but it was Breakers big man Derek Pardon that was the major influence on proceedings.\n\nFast becoming a fan favourite Pardon recorded a 19 points/10 rebounds double-double for the second consecutive game while also snaring 3 steals and swatting 3 blocked shots in a 35 minutes high energy performance.\n\nThere were other notable contributors to Sunday’s win with Jarrell Brantley posting his first double-double of the season – 17 points and 10 rebounds while Will McDowell-White was also influential with 13 points, 7 assists and 4 rebounds.\n\nIt wasn’t the happiest return to Auckland for former Breakers great CJ Bruton who was back in New Zealand for the first time since taking on the head coach role with the 36ers.\n\nIt was also a return of sorts for kiwi Hyrum Harris (6 points and 3 rebounds) and Mitch McCarron (8 points, 9 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals). The 36ers duo played plenty of games at Trusts Arena during their time in the NZNBL with the James Blond Super City Rangers a few years ago.\n\nWon 89-83 v Adelaide 36’ers at Trusts Arena on Sunday\n\nMcDowell-White became the fifth Breaker to score 100 points this season as he notched 13 points.\n\nThe Breakers centurion points scorers are:\n\nBrown 162\n\nBrantley 149\n\nPardon 137\n\nLe’afa 131\n\nMcDowell-White 105\n\nWon 84-76 v Tasmania Jack Jumpers (away) on Friday\n\nDerek Pardon posted 19 points and 10 rebounds, the exact numbers he posted on Sunday.\n\nIzayah Le’afa dropped 4 from 7 threes on his way to a season high 17 points, he now has 550 NBL career points.\n\nTom Vodanovich scored his 100th point for the Breakers.\n\nUpcoming\n\nCam Gliddon needs just 3 rebounds to bring up 1,000 career rebounds and 11 points for 3,000 career points.\n\nIzayah Le’afa requires just 1 assist for 150 career dimes.\n\nWill McDowell-White is 3 assists shy of becoming the 11th Breaker to dish 250 assists.\n\nTom Abercrombie, with I more steal will become the 4th Breaker to pinch 250 steals.\n\nThe Breakers top five “Stealers”:\n\n288 Boucher\n\n278 Jackson\n\n252 Vukona\n\n249 Abercrombie\n\n209 Henare\n\nThe Breakers are in Cairns on Friday to face the Taipans before facing yet another quick turnaround to take on Brisbane Bullets at Vector Arena at 4pm on Sunday.\n\nThe Sydney Kings continued their remarkable sequence of results on the road as they inflicted an 81-77 loss on the Sky Sport Breakers at Spark Arena on Sunday.\n\nThe Kings have now won 17 straight away games, the victory taking them to 7-2 and outright first in the ladder. It’s not all doom and gloom for the Sky Sport Breakers as they sit a lofty second on the NBL table with a 6-3 record entering into the two-week international break.\n\nThe Breakers looked dead and buried at half-time trailing 45-27 and with the margin still 18 points at the three-quarter mark a tame finish looked likely. However the Breakers poured in 31 fourth quarter points as Izayah Le’afa and Tom Abercrombie inspired a spirited comeback.\n\nThe Breakers reduced the deficit to two points in the dying seconds but with the clock their enemy the home team couldn’t get any closer.\n\nIt had been 33 months and 72 games since skipper Tom Abercrombie felt the warmth of home crowd support and the Breakers veteran received a terrific ovation as he entered the arena for his 372nd appearance for the club. He demonstrated that he had lost none of his defensive ability or his hops – a trademark fourth quarter dunk complimenting two earlier triples.\n\nHere are the latest club records and milestones:\n\nLost 81-77 v Sydney Kings at Spark Arena on Sunday\n\nWill McDowell-White nabbed his second double-double of the season in accumulating 10 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nHis 10 points moved him past 400 points for the Breakers – the 35th player to reach this milestone. Phill Jones was the first to reach the mark late in the inaugural 2003-04 season while Tai Webster, who was still at Forrest Hill Primary School when Jones made his 400th point, was the most recent in the 2020-21 season.\n\nTom Vodanovich played his 100th NBL game rather fittingly against the team he won a championship with last season and suited up for on 67 occasions. He first played for the Breakers between 2018 and 2020 before shifting to Sydney for a productive two seasons.\n\nBarry Brown Jr is proving to be a model of consistency. With 22 points against the Kings the Breakers leading scorer this season has now scored between 22 and 24 points in five of the six games he has played.\n\nIzayah Le’afa moved past the century mark in points this season with his 15 points on 7 from 12 shooting.\n\nUpcoming\n\nThe Breakers have another home game to look forward to on Sunday November 20 when they take on the Adelaide 36ers at Trusts Arena, 48 hours after a match up in Tasmania against the Jack Jumpers.\n\nThose two games follow the FIBA window when both the Tall Blacks and Australian Boomers will play two World Cup Qualifying games.\n\nDan Fotu and Alex McNaught headed off with the Tall Blacks on Monday morning to contest the Tall Blacks away games against Jordan on November 13 and Lebanon three days earlier."
