On April 27th, 34 year old Dan Duggins suffered a catastrophic brainstem stroke. As a long term member of the Richmond music community Dan’s former bands include Hot Rod Circuit and Lazy Cain. At the time of his stroke Dan was living in New York and was the drummer for The Queen Killing Kings and Zagmat. Although his condition has improved over this past month Dan and his family have a long road of rehabilitation and medical bills ahead of them.

Please join Dan’s friends July 23rd and 24th at Plaza Bowl in Richmond VA for a benefit in his honor. The Friday night line-up will include Lights East, 12 Step Revenge, Meat Cleaver, El Presidente, and The Tori ($10 admission, doors at 6pm). Saturday night features Strike the Chord & Burn, Dave Watkins, Last Century, Lewd Baron, I Am The Emperor, Throttlerod, Hex Machine, & Suzukiton ($10 admission, doors at 3pm).

All proceeds will be donated to Dan and his family.

For any of you knowing Dan, you also know how stubborn he was and so he wanted to wait to be put on my health insurance. We are facing a tidal wave of medical bills and I’ve appreciated all the efforts to help us out. If you would like to make a donation please do so by paypal ( dandugginstrust@gmail.com ) or you can send directly to me:

Jo Ann Duggins

PO Box 14747

Richmond, VA 23221

or his brother:

Ste Duggins

1611 olde coalmine rd

midlothian va 23113.

I cannot thank you all enough for all the support and kind words and I look forward to seeing Dan’s face when he gets to read all of it.

All my love,

Lady D
