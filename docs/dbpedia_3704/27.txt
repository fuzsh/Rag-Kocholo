my friend's boyfriend had a stroke recently. he's 20.

this is insane, and I hope he gets well soon.

Oh jesus. Fucking love Hot Rod Circuit. Hope he gets better!

i agree, jesse.

Oh no D: Hope he's going to be okay.

Hot Rod Circuit was an awesome band.

Hot Rod Circuit was one of the first bands I ever saw live.

I hope he will be okay :(

daaamn 34?

Shit that's sad.

oh maaaan, no way. :( hope he gets better soon.

but the HRC with the RGE ;_;

"'[Duggins] is currently in a 'locked in' state in intensive care, which means that he can not move and cannot communicate, except with eye movement'"

jesus, that is fucking terrifying

this shit terrifies me so bad. especially being so paranoid about my health lately.

:( fuck.

â™¥

oh my goodness! this makes me upset...hrc is my all time fave...

Holy fucking shit. 34???? And the "locked in" part...as if I don't have enough panic attacks about my health. That is truly insanely scary. I hope he recovers asap.

This is sad, especially for being so young. I met him a few years back before HRC broke up and he was a really cool guy.
