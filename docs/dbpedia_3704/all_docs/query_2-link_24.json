Nantucket Residents Against Turbines v. U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Mgmt., 100 F.4th 1 (1st Cir. 2024). The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) approved the construction of Vineyard Wind, a wind power project off the coast of Massachusetts after consulting with the National Marine Fisheries Service (“NMFS”). A group of Nantucket residents, organized as \"Nantucket Residents Against Turbines\" (“Residents”), allege that the federal agencies violated the Endangered Species Act by concluding that the project's construction likely would not jeopardize the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted summary judgment for BOEM and NMFS. On appeal of summary judgment, the Residents further allege that BOEM violated the National Environmental Policy Act by relying on NMFS's flawed analysis. The court rejected the Residents' argument, finding that NMFS's biological opinion properly analyzed the current status and environmental baseline of the right whale. Further, the biological opinion properly analyzed the effects of the project (e.g., noise) on the right whale, along with mitigation measures, and did not ignore the project's additive effects on the right whale's long-term recovery prospects. Finally, BOEM's reliance on the biological opinion did not violate NEPA. The judgment of the district court was affirmed.\n\nSingle kick to dog sufficient basis for \"cruelly beat\" component of felony cruelty conviction in North Carolina. State v. Doherty, --- S.E.2d ---- 2024 WL 2002922 (N.C. Ct. App. May 7, 2024). In this North Carolina case, the defendant appeals from his conviction of felony cruelty to animals and suspended sentence of imprisonment. The conviction stems from Defendant's kicking of his neighbor's dog. In November of 2019, the dog's owner was walking her fourteen-year-old dachshund-beagle mix, Davis, in front of Defendant's house when she stepped out of the roadway onto Defendant's lawn to avoid a passing car. The occupants of the car then stopped to talk with the dog's owner briefly, whereupon Defendant emerged from his home and proceeded to kick Davis in the stomach. Defendant was ultimately charged, indicted, and convicted of felonious cruelty to animals. On appeal, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the charge of felonious cruelty to animals because a single kick was insufficient to show that Defendant \"cruelly beat\" the dog. This court first addressed whether a single kick to a dog was sufficient to meet the definition of \"cruelly beat.\" Looking first at the standard dictionary definition of \"beat,\" the court found that the words, “cruelly beat” can apply to any act that causes the unjustifiable pain, suffering, or death to an animal, even if it is just one single act. In fact, the court stated, \"[t]o hold otherwise would allow a person to kick a dog so hard they suffer life-threatening injuries—such as the case here—but not be subject to felonious cruelty to animals because it was 'just' one kick.\" Thus, the trial court did not err in denying Defendant's motion to dismiss. No reversible error occurred and Defendant's conviction was affirmed.\n\nPennsylvania dogs chasing deer that were enclosed in fence does not allow deer owners to raise defense of legal right to kill dogs pursuing certain domestic animals. Commonwealth v. Stefanowicz, --- A.3d ---- 2024 WL 1918371, 2024 PA Super 90 (May 2, 2024). Appellant Stefanowicz appeals from the judgment entered in the Tioga County Court of Common Pleas in Pennsylvania. Appellant and his wife co-owned a deer farm (\"Awesome Whitetails\") where they are legally licensed to operate and sell trophy bucks which are kept in a fenced-in enclosure on their property. Appellant's neighbor, Ms. Smith, owned two German Shepherd dogs, which Appellant testified frequently entered his property and had previously harassed the animals he raises there. Appellant and his wife submitted a complaint to the state dog warden who then warned Smith of the statewide requirements on confining dogs. The warden also advised Appellant of the legal right to kill a dog that is “in the act of pursuing or wounding or killing” Appellant's animals. In fall of 2020, Smith's dogs entered Appellant's property and were chasing the deer from outside the fence. This deer began to panic, causing one to get stuck in the fence where one of the dogs then stared biting it. Appellant tried to yell at the dogs to no avail, so he then shot and killed the dogs. Appellant testified that one deer had a bloody gash, two more had bloody faces, and one deer died of a broken neck. Ultimately, Smith was sent a citation for failing to confine the dogs and Appellant was charged with two counts of Aggravated Cruelty to Animals and convicted of one of those counts. On appeal, Appellant raises several issues. The first two issues challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for the Aggravated Cruelty conviction. The court found sufficient evidence for the conviction as Appellant acted in an intentional manner to kill the dogs. Next, Appellant asserts that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because of his legal defense. In Pennsylvania, it is legal to kill certain dogs in the act of pursuing or wounding \"domestic animals\" (which includes farm-raised deer). The trial judge here gave an instruction on the defense, but added that \"under the laws of this Commonwealth, harassing an animal through a fence without any contact does not constitute pursuing, wounding, or killing an animal.\" Here, the jury heard that instruction and found the defense inapplicable for one dog. There was testimony from Appellant that he saw one of the two dogs biting a deer caught in the fence, not both dogs. Since the jury was free to evaluate the testimony and infer guilt, the reviewing court will not disturb the lower court's determination. After disposing of the remaining issues related to jury selection and ineffective assistance of counsel, the court affirmed Appellant's sentence.\n\nApril/May 2024\n\nCourt orders specific performance as remedy in custody dispute over dog. Lyman v. Lanser, --- N.E.3d ----, 2024 WL 970217 (Mass. App. Ct. Mar. 7, 2024). The parties purchased a dog together while they were still a couple, and agreed to share the dog if they broke up. After the relationship eventually ended, the couple shared the dog on a two week alternating basis. Eventually, one party maintained custody of the dog and denied the other party access to the dog, so plaintiff filed this action for conversion and breach of contract, seeking specific performance of the custody agreement for the dog. The court here found that the dog is jointly owned property, the lack of a written contract does not bar the plaintiff from specific performance, and that the judge's order of specific performance was a suitable remedy since monetary damages would not allow plaintiff access to his shared property. Therefore, the court reversed the order vacating the preliminary injunction and denied the defendant's petition for relief from the preliminary injunction.\n\nAppeals court reverses finding of \"constructive delay\" in case involving keeping of chickens as assistance animals. Lab. Comm'n, Antidiscrimination & Lab. Div. v. FCS Cmty. Mgmt., --- P.3d ----, 2024 WL 1203693, 2024 UT App 39. This is an appeal of a complaint filed by the Utah Anti-discrimination and Labor Division (ULAD) seeking review of the determination that an HOA violated members' request for reasonable accommodation by denying homeowner's the ability to keep chickens on their property. The chickens were intended to be assistance animals for the homeowner's daughter, who has anxiety and PTSD. The district court found that the HOA constructively denied the homeowner's request for reasonable accommodation by delaying their response to the request for three months. This court reversed the decision of the lower court, finding that there was no constructive denial of the request since the HOA allowed the homeowners to keep the chickens during the interim period, did not punish them for keeping the chickens, and ultimately granted the request to keep the chickens.\n\nPlant-based meat alternative producer's motion for summary judgment denied after court finds state law involves no suppression of commercial speech and no discriminatory effect under Dormant Commerce Clause. Turtle Island Foods, SPC v. Thompson, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2024 WL 1342597 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 26, 2024). Plaintiffs, a nonprofit advocacy organization and a plant-based meat alternative producer, filed this case to challenge the constitutionality of a statute that criminalizes the misrepresentation of a product as meat that is not derived from livestock or poultry. Plaintiffs bring four constitutional claims against the statute. For the First Amendment violation, plaintiffs specifically argue that the statute is an unlawful restriction on truthful commercial speech. However, the court finds that the statute does not restrict truthful commercial speech, since plaintiffs are still able to accurately indicate what sort of products they are selling to consumers. For the Dormant Commerce Clause argument, the court finds that the statute does not discriminate in purpose or effect, and that the statute passes the Pike balancing test. For the Due Process claim, the court finds that the statute provides sufficiently specific guidance to both the public and prosecutors as to what actions are prohibited, so it does not violate Due Process. Accordingly, the court denied plaintiff's claims and motion for summary judgment.\n\nMarch 2024\n\nCourt rules Massachusetts' Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act has discriminatory effect on out-of-state pork processor. Triumph Foods, LLC v. Campbell, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2024 WL 421994 (D. Mass. Feb. 5, 2024). This case was brought by a group of pork producers and farmers to challenge the Massachusetts' Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act on the grounds that it violates the dormant Commerce Clause by improperly regulating interstate commerce. The Act would require pork producers to phase out certain means of pig confinement in order to sell pork products in Massachusetts. In response, the state filed a motion to dismiss arguing that there is no causally connected harm to the pork producers, which the court denied. The court first evaluated the slaughterhouse exemption, which exempts sales from the requirement that they must take place within Massachusetts if the buyer takes physical possession of the pork while on the premises of an establishment inspected under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Plaintiff argued that as an out-of-state pork processor, it could not take advantage of this exemption, even though it operates entirely federally inspected facilities, because it ships its product into Massachusetts from out-of-state and, its buyers do not take physical possession of its product while at its facilities. The court found that this exemption has a discriminatory effect, and vacated the order in part to allow the court to consider whether the Act with the slaughterhouse exemption severed is preempted by the Federal Meat Inspection Act.\n\nWhile 3-month delay was not unreasonable to properly consider accommodation request to keep chickens as ESAs, members were not damaged by delay. Lab. Comm'n v. FCS Cmty. Mgmt., 2024 UT App 14, --- P.3d ----, 2024 WL 370160. This case concerns the Utah Anti-discrimination and Labor Division's (UALD) determination that a homeowner's association's three-month delay in responding to a member's request for reasonable accommodation to keep chickens on their property as assistance animals for a child with anxiety and PTSD violated the Utah Fair Housing Act. The trial court found that this three month delay was a constructive denial of the request, because under the Utah Fair Housing Act a housing provider must participate in an interactive process to evaluate and discuss the request for accommodation, and no such interactive dialogue or interactive process took place. On appeal, the court found that the three month delay in responding to the request was not unreasonably long, especially considering that the HOA had to review the status of chickens as support animals, chicken waste runoff, and possibility of rodent complaints during this time. The court of appeals also found that members were not harmed by the HOA's alleged delay, since they were still allowed to keep the chickens at this time. The court of appeals then reversed the trial court's holding granting the members damages, fees, and other relief.\n\nAnimal abuse conviction affirmed where sufficient evidence included neighbor's testimony of observing defendant swinging small dog by leash and slamming dog's head against ground. State v. McIntosh, No. SD 37827, --- S.W.3d ----, 2024 WL 302430 (Mo. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 2024). This case is an appeal following the defendant's conviction of animal abuse and assault in the fourth degree. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in convicting him of animal abuse due to insufficient evidence showing that he purposely caused suffering to the dog he allegedly abused. The event that led to defendant's conviction was witnessed by a neighbor, who saw the defendant in his backyard swinging a small dog through the air by its leash and collar. The neighbor also saw defendant climb on top of the dog to choke it and slam its head into the ground. The neighbor testified at trial about these events, and the trial court found defendant guilty of animal abuse and assault in the fourth degree. The court of appeals held that there was sufficient evidence, consisting of the neighbor's testimony, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.\n\nJanuary/February 2024\n\nCourt finds that delegation of swine \"sorting process\" to slaughterhouse employees did not violate Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA). Farm Sanctuary v. United States Dep't of Agric., --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 8602134 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 12, 2023). This case was brought by plaintiffs, several nonprofit animal rights organizations, to challenge a Final Rule implementing a new swine inspection system at pig farms and slaughterhouses across the United States against defendants, the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food Safety Inspection Service. The new system requires that employees of the slaughterhouses perform ante-mortem and post-mortem sorting activities before the federal inspection is to take place, which plaintiffs challenge under the argument that this shifting of the sorting activities to slaughterhouse employees is in violation of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA). Plaintiffs argue that this delegation is improper, would negatively impact the safety of pork being produced by slaughterhouses, and would lead to inhumane slaughter of pigs. Plaintiffs and defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that plaintiffs failed to meet the burden of proof to show that the delegation of the sorting process was improper.\n\nEuthanasia of dog by wife without husband's authorization did not violate automatic Family Court order because the animal was not a financial asset for purposes of the order. C.M. v. E.M., --- N.Y.S.3d ----, 2023 WL 8360025 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Nov. 28, 2023). This is a family law case concerning, among other issues, the euthanasia of a family companion animal. Defendant argues that Plaintiff violated an order in place by putting the family dog down without reason, necessity, and justification, and that the dog was an emotional support animal whose custody had not been determined. Defendant also argues that plaintiff did not allow defendant the opportunity to spend time with the dog before it was put down, and that he suffered emotional distress due to the dog's death. The court found that the euthanasia of the family dog did not violate the order in place, because the companion animal was not classified as \"property\" or an \"asset\" under the order in place, and that animals are afforded additional protection under the Family Court Act. Whether the animal was put down unnecessarily could be considered animal cruelty, but that inquiry would need to be determined in a criminal proceeding, and criminal charges were not filed. Accordingly, the court held that plaintiff did not violate the order by euthanizing the family dog.\n\nCourt denied zoo's motion for preliminary injunction after seizure of 95 sick animals because zoo could not prove irreparable harm from seizure. Mogensen v. Welch, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 8756708 (W.D. Va. Dec. 19, 2023). Plaintiffs owned and operated a zoo containing about 95 animals. Following complaints about suspected abuse and neglect of these animals, defendant executed a search warrant of the zoo. The search led to the seizure of many of these animals, including a tiger in such poor health that it needed to be euthanized. Following the seizure of these animals, plaintiffs filed a motion to argue that their due process rights were violated because a civil forfeiture hearing must be held no more than ten business days after the state seized the animals, and plaintiffs argue that ten days is too little time to prepare for the hearing. To succeed on the claim, plaintiffs must show that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, which they were unable to do because plaintiffs still have the right to appeal if the hearing does not go in their favor. Therefore, the court denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n2023\n\nDecember 2023\n\nCourt strikes down Wisconsin's hunter harassment statute as unconstitutional viewpoint-based regulation of speech. Brown v. Kemp, 86 F.4th 745 (7th Cir. 2023). This is a case brought by a group of hunting opponents against Wisconsin state employees to challenge Wisconsin’s hunter harassment statute. The challenged statute criminalizes those who photograph or videotape hunting activities with intent to interfere with the hunting. The challengers, who intended to use the footage to spur public debate about hunting and ensure hunters are following state taking limits, allege that the law violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted summary judgment to the state employees after finding that the statute did not violate the First Amendment, and the hunting opponents appealed. On appeal, the court found that the statutory provisions on visual/physical proximity and approaching/confronting hunters were unconstitutionally vague, the photographing/recording provision was unconstitutionally overbroad, and the entire statute was an unconstitutional viewpoint-based regulation of speech.\n\nAggravated cruelty conviction affirmed where court found defendant was aware of his dog's aggressive behavior and refused to intervene to stop attacks on other animals. People v. Restifo, --- N.Y.S.3d ----220 A.D.3d 1113, 2023 WL 7028284, 2023 N.Y. Slip Op. 05425 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023). This is an appeal of a verdict to convict defendant of aggravated cruelty to animals. Defendant was walking his two pit bull dogs and allowed the dogs enough leash space to reach a pet cat resting on the steps of its owner’s porch. The cat’s owners, who were witnesses to this event, watched as the pit bulls mauled their pet cat. When the witnesses asked defendant to stop his dogs, defendant attempted to flee with his dogs still carrying the cat’s body in its mouth. The witnesses pursued and eventually, the dog dropped the deceased cat’s body. Defendant was charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and overdriving, torturing and injuring animals, and failure to provide proper sustenance. Defendant was convicted, and appealed the aggravated animal cruelty charge. Defendant argues that the verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence. The court here found that defendant was well aware that the dogs were aggressive, even keeping them separate from his young son because of their propensity to attack smaller animals. There was also testimony from another neighbor of defendant allowing his dogs to chase feral cats off her porch without stopping them, and testimony regarding defendant’s dog previously mauling a smaller dog without defendant intervening to stop them. Defendant was warned by animal control to muzzle them, but refused to do so. Defendant also bragged to co-workers about how he let his pit bulls go after other dogs and attack wild and old animals. Accordingly, the court found that defendant was aware of the dogs’ aggressive behavior and affirmed the holding of the lower court.\n\nCourt grants preliminary injunction to stop use of foothold traps that incidentally ensnare grizzly bears. Flathead-Lolo-Bitterroot Citizen Task Force v. Montana, ---- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 8064884, No. CV 23-101-M-DWM, 2023 WL 8064884 (D. Mont. Nov. 21, 2023). This case was brought by several environmental organizations against the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission to challenge the approval or regulations that authorize the trapping and snaring of wolves within grizzly bear habitat in Montana. The grizzly bear is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Montana trapping regulations allow wolf hunters to use foothold traps large enough to capture grizzly bears. Grizzly bears rely heavily on their front and back paws to hunt for food, so crippling their limbs with these traps will lead to the incidental killing of grizzly bears from starvation. Plaintiffs also showed that there was a likelihood of harm to grizzly bears, with evidence that these traps will lead to the death of grizzly bears. The court granted plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction in part and denied in part, and enjoined the Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission from authorizing wolf trapping and snaring.\n\n\"Dog-friendly\" restaurant did not have knowledge of visiting dog's vicious propensities to impugn liability. Cantore v. Costantine, --- N.Y.S.3d ----, 2023 WL 7560690 (N.Y. App. Div. Nov. 15, 2023). This is an appeal of a personal injury case brought by plaintiff, the mother of the injured child, against the owners of a dog that caused the injury and the owners of the restaurant where the injury occurred. The injury took place at a dog-friendly restaurant both parties were dining at, where the dog owned by defendants bit a three-year-old infant. Plaintiff alleges that the restaurant owners knew of the dog’s vicious propensities but allowed it on the premises, and are liable along with the owners of the dog for the injuries sustained by her child. Defendant restaurant owners contend that they did not know of the dog’s vicious propensities, and that their restaurant requires that dogs be leashed, and the dog was leashed at the time of the bite. The lower court denied defendants motion for summary judgment because there were unresolved issues of fact as to the restaurant defendants’ duty to their patrons and the foreseeability of the injury. This appeal followed. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the lower court because defendants established that they did not have any knowledge of the vicious propensities of the dog and that they exercised reasonable care through their signage and policies to protect restaurant patrons from the risk of harm that allowing animals on the premises poses. Defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them is granted.\n\nOctober/November 2023\n\nColorado Supreme Court finds legislature intended prior animal cruelty convictions as sentence enhancer rather than element of felony cruelty charge. Caswell v. People, 536 P.3d 323 (Colo., 2023). This case concerns several charges of animal cruelty against petitioner Caswell. A welfare check was conducted in response to a report, resulting in the seizure of petitioner's sixty animals. These animals lacked sufficient food or water, were kept in enclosed spaces filled with feces and urine, and many of the animals were underweight or had untreated medical problems. Respondent charged Caswell with 43 class six counts of cruelty to animals, which were charged as felonies because Caswell had prior convictions of misdemeanor animal cruelty. The jury found Caswell guilty of all 43 counts and sentenced her to eight years of probation, 43 days in jail, and 47 days of in-home detention. After being affirmed on appeal, Petitioner filed for certiorari and the Supreme Court of Colorado granted. Here, petitioner argues that the use of her prior convictions for animal cruelty to enhance her charges to felonies violates the Sixth Amendment and the Colorado Constitution. After reviewing the factors, the court concluded that the legislature intended to designate the fact of prior convictions as a sentence enhancer rather than an element of the current crime. The court also concluded that the sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment or article II of the Colorado Constitution, and affirmed the holding of the lower court.\n\nKeeping terminally ill dog in state of suffering does not constitute \"subjecting\" a dog to harm under Massachusetts's anti-cruelty law, court finds. Commonwealth v. Russo, -- N.E.3d ----, 2023 WL 5962931 (Mass. App. Ct. Sept. 14, 2023). The owner of fourteen-year-old dog brought the dog to an animal hospital where veterinarians found a large mass that necessitated surgery. Defendant declined surgery and took the dog home. Three weeks later, defendant brought the dog back, where the staff noticed that his condition had worsened significantly, and the veterinarian recommended humane euthanasia to end the dog’s suffering. The owner then asked for surgery, but the vet indicated that the dog would not survive, so the owner again took the dog home. The veterinarian reported defendant to the Animal Rescue League of Boston, who conducted a welfare check on the dog and found it in very poor health. When the Animal Rescue League asked defendant to euthanize the dog or get him medical attention, defendant declined and insisted the dog would die at home. Defendant was charged with violating the animal cruelty statute, defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint was granted, and this appeal followed. The question on appeal is whether defendant’s conduct in refusing to euthanize the dog constitutes animal cruelty under the statute. After examining case law, the court could not find a case in which a person's failure to euthanize an animal was interpreted as “subjecting” an animal to harm, and did not want to extend the statute that far. The court affirmed the holding of the lower court.\n\nCounty had a mandatory duty to release dogs scheduled for euthanasia to qualified nonprofit animal rescue or adoption organizations. Santa Paula Animal Rescue Ctr., Inc. v. Cnty. of Los Angeles, 313 Cal. Rptr. 3d 566 (Cal. Ct. App. Sept. 18, 2023), reh'g denied (Oct. 16, 2023). Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate against defendant county seeking to compel the release of impounded dogs scheduled for euthanasia to plaintiffs. The court sustained defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend, and this appeal followed. Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the Hayden Act imposes a duty on defendant to release the dogs scheduled for euthanasia to plaintiffs. The court examined the relevant code, which stated that “any stray dog that is impounded pursuant to this division shall, before the euthanasia of that animal, be released to a nonprofit” and agreed with plaintiffs’ argument that the use of the word \"shall\" indicates that the legislature intended to impose a duty on defendant to release these dogs upon request to qualified nonprofit animal rescue or adoption agencies. The court also concluded that the demurrer was improperly granted as defendant lacked discretion to withhold and euthanize a dog based upon its determination that the animal has a behavioral problem or is not adoptable or treatable. The court agreed, however, that defendant had discretion to determine whether and how a non-profit organization qualifies as an animal adoption or rescue organization. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, vacated the trial court’s order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend, and remanded to the trial court.\n\nCourt finds LSU labs must produce veterinary records related to research animals, but other records like private communications between employees and trapping records were unduly burdensome. People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Bd. of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ., --- So.3d ----, 2023 WL 6119352, 2022-0976 (La. App. 1 Cir. 9/19/23). Plaintiff-appellee PETA began this case by issuing eight public records requests to defendant-appellant Louisiana State University (LSU). PETA made these records seeking veterinary care and disposition records for birds used in LSU’s laboratories. For the first seven of these requests, LSU did not produce the records, so PETA filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief pursuant to the Public Records Law. LSU denied PETA’s allegations and did not produce the records, so PETA made an eighth records request, which LSU responded to with an assertion that the requested records were exempt from disclosure. After a hearing, the trial court issued an oral ruling in favor of PETA and granted some of the records that PETA requested. LSU appealed. On appeal, the court considered whether the records sought by PETA were covered under the Public Records Law. The court first found that LSU qualifies as a research facility under the Animal Welfare Act, and needs to comply with federal law and maintain and produce records relating to research animals, so long as the records being sought would not be unduly burdensome to produce. The court held that the portions of the judgment ordering LSU to produce veterinary daily observation reports, veterinary daily health check records, and other veterinary records were affirmed. However, some of the information sought, including private communications between LSU employees, trapping records, and some videographic records, were considered unduly burdensome to compel LSU to produce.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nCourt upholds conviction for animal cruelty based on failure to groom dog. Commonwealth v. Deible, --- A.3d ----, 2023 WL 4715187 (July 25, 2023). Appellant has owned the 17-year-old terrier dog since the dog was a puppy. At one point, the dog escaped from appellant’s home and was found by a bystander. This bystander testified that the dog’s fur was heavily matted, with objects stuck in its fur. Appellant testified that the dog was aggressive when she attempted to groom him, and that their veterinarian was supposed to groom the dog, but the dog’s veterinary records did not support this. The lower court found that there was sufficient evidence to charge appellant with animal cruelty, and ordered her to pay fines totaling $946.58 and forfeit ownership of the dog. Appellant filed this appeal to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence used to support her conviction of animal cruelty. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the cruelty charge, as the statute prohibits “ill-treatment” and the evidence of the condition of the dog supports that it was treated improperly. Appellant also argues that the court’s order for her to forfeit her dog was improper, but the court of appeals disagreed due to the pattern of neglect established by appellant’s history with the dog. Accordingly, the court of appeals affirmed the holding of the lower court.\n\nIn challenge to disciplinary action, while Texas veterinarian's use of \"telemedicine\" was protected speech, the regulation of this speech by Board was content neutral. Hines v. Pardue, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 5254673 (S.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2023). Plaintiff veterinarian brings this action to challenge a Texas law that mandates a veterinarian conduct a physical examination of an animal before practicing veterinary medicine on the grounds that the law violates his First Amendment right to free speech. Plaintiff, who was unable to maintain a veterinary practice in person due to medical issues, began providing veterinary advice to animal owners via a website without first examining their animals. Plaintiff was disciplined by the Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners for doing this, and was fined $500 and sentenced to a year of probation. Plaintiff then sued the members of the Board on two separate occasions, with the second appeal being remanded by the Fifth Circuit with instructions to determine whether the requirement for a physical examination before issuing veterinary advice regulates speech incidentally to the regulation of non-expressive professional conduct, or is a regulation of non-expressive conduct. Plaintiff argues that his email exchanges with animal owners constitutes speech, and the court agrees that this is speech and that the Examination Requirement regulates this speech. However, the court finds that this regulation of plaintiff’s speech is content neutral because the requirement for a physical examination of the animals before issuing advice applies neutrally to all forms of veterinary care and veterinary speech regardless of content. Therefore, the court held that defendants may enforce the Examination Requirement without violating plaintiff’s free speech rights.\n\nWashington court denies plaintiff's application of public nuisance by zoo for alleged violations of wildlife and anti-cruelty laws. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Olympic Game Farm, Inc., --- P.3d ----, 2023 WL 5281830 (Wash. Aug. 17, 2023). This case is brought by the Animal Legal Defense Fund (Plaintiff) against a private zoo based in Washington state, known as Olympic Game Farm, Inc (Defendant). Plaintiff argues that defendant has violated Washington’s wildlife laws, animal cruelty laws, and the Washington and federal Endangered Species Acts. Plaintiff also argues that defendant has created a public nuisance, which is a nuisance that “affects equally the rights of an entire community or neighborhood, although the extent of that damage may be unequal.” Plaintiff argued that they have demonstrated that defendant is in violation of animal cruelty and wildlife laws, and asked the court to name the violation of these laws as a public nuisance per se. The court found that previous cases regarding public nuisance claims limit those claims to instances of property infringement or threats to public health and safety. Accordingly, the court held that defendant’s alleged violation of the wildlife, animal cruelty, and endangered species laws, did not constitute a public nuisance.\n\nJuly/August 2023\n\nWyoming declines to extend emotional distress damages for injury to dogs as animate property. Cardenas v. Swanson, --- P.3d ----, 2023 WL 4344196 (Wyo. July 5, 2023). The Cardenas family (Appellants) owned three St. Bernard dogs. Appellants lived on a home adjacent to large tracts of state land. One afternoon, the dogs were let outside to run, and appellants found one dog caught in a snare, where it died from a broken neck. Appellants attempted to free the dog from the snare, which injured the Cardenas children in the process. Additionally, the other two dogs were also caught in snares and died from their injuries. Appellants filed suit against the trapper who set the snares (Appellee), asserting claims of negligence, willful and wanton misconduct, violation of statutes, infliction of emotional distress, and civil rights violations. The trial court granted and denied in part the motion for summary judgment, finding that appellee’s conduct was not willful and wanton and that appellants could not recover emotional damages for the loss of the dogs. On appeal, the court held that emotional injuries for the loss of property are not recoverable since, under this court’s precedent, emotional damages are only recoverable for certain limited situations. Dogs are considered personal property under state law, and damage to personal property is not one of the situations in which emotional damages are recoverable. The court would not create a precedent to allow people to recover emotional distress damages when animate personal property is harmed, as that change would be best suited for the legislature to make. Affirmed.\n\nChild's emotional support animal fits within definition of \"counseling\" to support transfer of dog from father/owner to child. Matter of S. A. B., --- P.3d ----, 326 Or. App. 192 (2023). In this Ohio juvenile dependency case, a father appeals a juvenile court judgment ordering him to transfer the dog to his child, claiming that the court lacked the authority. He also claims the dog is his personal property and not the child's. The child's therapist testified that the child's mental health symptoms are exacerbated by \"missing and worrying about the dog.\" The therapist testified that, because of the bond that child shares with the dog, the child's emotional support dog should be this particular dog. In contrast, the father claims the dog is legally his and provides a household benefit for him by keeping raccoons away from his chickens and deterring thieves from entering the property. On appeal, the father argues that an emotional support animal does not fall within the statutory definition for \"counseling\" and, thus, the court's order was tantamount to giving away his property. The court found that the dictionary definition of the term, read with the policy goals of the chapter, allowed the court to conclude that the term \"counseling\" includes the use of emotional support animals. In fact, \". . . this particular dog is not just a pet, but rather is an emotional support animal for child, as evidenced by child's strong emotional bond with this particular dog and various testimony demonstrating that this particular dog will contribute to child's well-being by providing child with emotional stability and security.\" As to the property issue, the court observed that courts routinely order parents to provide support for their children and this transfer of property did not abuse the court's discretion. Affirmed.\n\nDespite settlement and embargo against Mexico to curb gillnet fishing of commercially valuable totoaba fish, it is unclear whether enough progress has been made to save critically endangered vaquita. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, --- F.Supp.3d ----, No. 22-00339, 2023 WL 3994447 (Ct. Int'l Trade June 14, 2023). A small porpoise called the vaquita is on the verge of extinction, largely due to gillnet fishing of the totoaba fish that commonly traps and kills vaquitas as well. This fishing takes place in waters in Mexico’s territory, where the last few vaquitas live. In 2020, under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the United States banned the importation from Mexico of seafood products caught with gillnets inside the vaquita’s range. Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit in 2022 against the U.S. Department of the Interior arguing that defendants caused an unlawful delay responding to a 2014 letter requesting that Secretary of the Interior certify the embargo against Mexico in order to curb the fishing of the totoaba, as doing otherwise diminished CITES by furthering the extinction of the vaquita. Plaintiffs also requested an order enjoining defendants from further delay in responding to the petition to certify Mexico, and costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the lawsuit. After settlement negotiations took place, parties reached a conditional settlement. It remains unclear whether Mexico has made progress in implementing the plan to save the vaquita, whether CITES is being implemented effectively by Mexico, and whether the President will act on the Secretary’s certification. To read more about the challenges facing the vaquita population, see the Overview.\n\nJune 2023\n\nU.S. Supreme Court holds California Prop 12 on cruel confinement of pigs does not violate dormant Commerce Clause. Nat'l Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. ------- S.Ct. ----, No. 21-468, 2023 WL 3356528 (U.S. May 11, 2023). Following the adoption of California’s Proposition 12, two organizations – the National Pork Producers Council and the American Farm Bureau Federation (Petitioners) – filed this lawsuit on behalf of the members of these organizations that are in the business of raising and processing pigs for the sale of pork meat. Petitioners allege that Proposition 12, which forbids the sale of whole pork meat in California that is made from breeding pigs (or their immediate offspring) that are confined in a cruel manner, violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by placing an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Under Proposition 12, confinement of pigs is cruel if it prevents a pig from lying down, standing up, fully extending its limbs, or turning around freely. Petitioners allege that the cost of compliance with Proposition 12 will increase production costs, but concede that those costs will fall on both California and out-of-state pork producers. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, rejecting petitioners’ arguments that Proposition 12 violates the dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Court found no violation of the dormant Commerce Clause because: (1) petitioners concede that Proposition 12 did not implicate the antidiscrimination principle, because it imposes the same burdens on in-state pork producers that it imposes on out-of-state pork producers, and (2) petitioners’ reliance on the Pike line of cases to prevent a state from regulating the sale of a consumer good within its borders on nondiscriminatory terms was rejected, as that line of cases had never yielded such a result.\n\nNew York defendant's 10-year ban on possessing animals left in place on appeal. People v. Minutolo, 215 A.D.3d 1260 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023). Defendant appealed from a judgment convicting him of animal cruelty in violation of New York Agriculture and Markets Law § 353. The conviction stemmed from defendant repeatedly striking one of his dogs out of \"frustration\" after the dog failed to come when called. On appeal, defendant called into question the authentication of surveillance video from a nearby gas station showing him striking the dog. The Supreme Court, Appellate Division found the portion of surveillance video showing defendant repeatedly striking one of his dogs was sufficiently authenticated. Further, other evidence established that he \"cruelly beat\" the dog by punching the dog with a closed fist three to five times. Finally, defendant's challenge to the penalty imposed under Agriculture and Markets Law § 374 (8)(c) that prohibits defendant from owning or otherwise having custody of any other animals for 10 years was rejected by the court. The judgment was unanimously affirmed.\n\nDog owner not liable for fall-related injuries suffered by pedestrian after dog chased ball into street. Murga v. Yarusso, 215 A.D.3d 979 (N.Y. App. Div. 2023). This New York case involved action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained after defendant's dog allegedly ran into street and pushed the plaintiff pedestrian to the ground. The plaintiff described the dog as acting like a \"big puppy\" and the dog did not bite the plaintiff. In contrast, the defendant testified that the dog was chasing a ball in the defendant's front yard and did not actually go in the street. Rather, defendant asserts that plaintiff tripped upon seeing the dog in the yard. The complaint alleged that the defendant was negligent in failing to keep the dog under control and to take protective measures knowing of the aggressive propensity of the dog. The Supreme Court, Suffolk County granted the defendant-owner's motion for summary judgment. On appeal by the plaintiff, the plaintiff also suggested that defendant might be liable for throwing the ball which caused the dog to run in the street and knock the plaintiff down. The Supreme Court, Appellate Division, held that the plaintiff cannot recover under such a theory, as New York does not recognize a common-law negligence cause of action to recover damages for an owner's alleged negligence in the handling of a dog. The summary judgment was affirmed as the court found the owner was not liable to pedestrian for injuries sustained.\n\nApril/May 2023\n\nClaims of fraud, conversion/trespass to chattels, and intentional infliction of emotional distress based on inhumane euthanasia of cat by veterinarian allowed to go to trial. Berry v. Frazier, --- Cal.Rptr.3d ----, 2023 WL 3141235 (Cal. Ct. App. Apr. 28, 2023). Ryan Berry sued veterinarian Jeffery R. Frazier over the euthanasia of her cat. Berry claimed that Frazier performed the procedure (an intracardiac injection) without her informed consent, using an inhumane and unnecessary method that caused pain to the cat and emotional distress to her. The court found that Berry's allegations of fraud were sufficient to support a claim, as Frazier intentionally misled her about the procedure. The court also ruled that the conversion/trespass to chattels claim and intentional infliction of emotional distress claim were valid, as Frazier's actions violated Berry's property rights and caused severe emotional distress. However, the court agreed with the trial court that there was no separate cause of action for a violation of Civil Code section 3340, but Berry could seek exemplary damages under this section in connection with other causes of action (the court also rejected Frazier's argument that Section 3340 does not apply to veterinarians). The court remanded the case to allow Berry to file a second amended complaint to include the request for exemplary damages. The appeals from the previous orders were dismissed, the judgment of dismissal was reversed, and the case was sent back to the trial court for further proceedings, with instructions to modify the demurrer order and allow the filing of a second amended complaint.\n\nDistrict Court finds insufficient standing for animal advocates who sought petition of rulemaking to regulate the handling and slaughter of \"downed\" pigs by the FSIS. Farm Sanctuary v. United States Dep't of Agric., --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 2673141 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2023). Several non-profit organizations, including Farm Sanctuary and Animal Legal Defense Fund, filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) related to the slaughtering of pigs. The plaintiffs alleged three causes of action related to the humane treatment, handling, and disposition of downed pigs, violation of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act, and arbitrary and capricious denial of a Petition for Rulemaking. The court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue both causes of action and failed to establish that the defendants violated the HMSA and the APA. The court ruled that the plaintiffs did not establish an injury in fact for standing purposes. The defendants argued that they complied with Congress's mandates and that some obligations are not judicially reviewable, to which the court agreed. The court also concluded that the statute grants discretion to the Secretary to determine whether to promulgate regulations for the humane treatment of non-ambulatory livestock and that agency decisions not to take enforcement action are unreviewable. As a result, the defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the first and second causes of action.\n\nOhio court finds dog participating in dog program at prison was not \"vicious\" under Ohio's statutory definition to impute liability to department of corrections. Dillon v. Ohio Dep't of Rehab. & Correction, --- N.E.3d ----, 2023-Ohio-942. Anna Dillon, a certified \"senior dog handler,\" was attacked by a dog named \"Roosevelt,\" owned by an Ohio Reformatory for Woman (ORW) corrections officer. Despite previous interactions without incident, Roosevelt attacked Dillon in March 2018, causing multiple bite wounds. After the incident, Roosevelt was removed from the program. Dillon filed a civil action against the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC) in 2020, alleging negligence and spoliation of evidence. The trial court ruled in favor of ODRC in September 2021. Dillon appealed, arguing that the trial court's findings were incorrect. The court evaluated whether Roosevelt was a vicious dog prior to the incident, using Ohio's statutory definition. The court found that Roosevelt's previous behaviors did not meet the definition of serious injury required to classify him as vicious. The court also dismissed Dillon's claim of negligent keeping of Roosevelt since the first issue was resolved. Regarding spoliation of evidence, Dillon claimed that ODRC willfully destroyed the handler folder for Roosevelt. However, the court found no evidence of willful destruction or disruption of Dillon's case. The judgment in favor of ODRC was affirmed.\n\nMarch 2023\n\nConnecticut court shuts down dog owner's claim for emotional distress under \"bystander\" theory after witnessing dog run over by delivery driver. Brisson v. These Guys New York Deli Corp., Not Reported in Atl. Rptr., 2023 WL 370990 (Conn. Super. Ct. Jan. 20, 2023). The Superior Court of Connecticut considers defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' claims for emotional distress arising from the death of their pet dog. Plaintiffs argue that previous Connecticut case law (Myers v. Hartford, 84 Conn. App. 395) left open the question of whether courts could consider a claim for emotional distress damages due to the loss of a pet. The incident giving rise to the litigation occurred in 2021, where a driver for the defendants' company ran over plaintiffs' pet dog while making a delivery. Myers left often the issue of recovery of damages when a \"bystander\" owner witnesses a \"fatal injury.\" The court then examined the factors articulated by the Connecticut Supreme Court for recovery of emotional damages by a bystander. In doing so, the court here determined that the relationship between a pet and its owner does not meet the \"closely related\" element articulated by the Supreme Court. The court stated: \"Absent appellate clarification that this factor includes other relationships, including the one at issue here between a pet owner and pet, this court cannot conclude that such a relationship is sufficiently like the close human relationships required under Clohessy.\" The court noted that it agreed with defendants that allowing plaintiffs' claim would amount to creating a new cause of action without legislative or appellate authority. Defendants' motion to strike was granted.\n\nSummary judgment not appropriate where city presented no evidence to support claim of substantial burden where resident keeps chickens as emotional support animals in violation of ordinance. Whiteaker v. City of Southgate, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2023 WL 317457 (E.D. Mich. Jan. 19, 2023). The plaintiff (“Whiteaker”) contends that the City violated the FHA by denying Whiteaker's request for an exemption from City Ordinance 610.13, which prohibits City residents from maintaining chickens (or other typical farm animals) on their property. Whiteaker was issued a citation by the City for a violation of Ordinance 610.13 and appeared in district court to defend himself, claiming he had a right to keep the chickens under Michigan's Right to Farm Act, and subsequently, under the Fair Housing Act (FHA). In the instant motion for summary judgment by the City, the court examined the \"reasonableness\" of Whiteaker's request for a reasonable accommodation under the FHA. The court found that the balancing test required under the FHA, to wit, weighing Whiteaker's disability-related need to keep the chickens as a source of comfort and support against the City's claims that the chickens pose a threat to public health, is a triable issue of fact. Indeed, the court observed that the City's citation of documentation from the CDC only lists the \"potential dangers\" chickens can pose to public health without sufficient evidence to supports its claim that the chickens will burden the City financially and administratively. In contrast, Whiteaker claims a disability and has provided evidence of his disability. The court cited Whiteaker's evidentiary support for his claim of disability and need for the chickens to alleviate those symptoms against the fact the City has not presented any testimony, affidavits, or \"evidence of any kind\" to support its claim. Thus, the court denied the motion for summary judgment.\n\nIntervening act of Congress corrects FOIA issues for plaintiff seeking animal welfare records from federal agency. Am. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Animal & Plant Health Inspection Serv., 60 F.4th 16, 2023 WL 2026831(2d Cir. 2023). In 2019, Plaintiff-Appellant the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (“ASPCA”) sued Defendants-Appellees the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) alleging that APHIS followed a \"policy or practice\" of violating FOIA for failing to comply with requests for records related to the agency response to maintenance of animal welfare standards and licensing of animal dealers/exhibitors. This suit was prompted by APHIS' 2017 decommissioning of two public databases that allow users (including the ASPCA) to access records on commercial breeding facilities including inspection reports and photographs. APHIS contends that there was not a policy or practice that violated FOIA because it was corrected as the result of an intervening act of Congress, specifically, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. The district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the pleadings, finding that while the decommissioning of the databases did indeed impair the ability of the ASPCA to receive prompt FOIA requests, ASPCA did not establish that the court must intervene to correct such a policy or practice and Congress already acted to correct the breakdown through the appropriations bill. On ASPCA's timely appeal here, the Second Circuit agreed with the district court that the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 reversed the records access problems.\n\nJanuary/February 2023\n\nLivestock not excluded from neglect portion of WV anti-cruelty law. Beasley v. Sorsaia, 880 S.E.2d 875 (W. Va. 2022). Petitioner was charged with animal cruelty in West Virginia. The incident stemmed from 2020 where humane officers in Putnam County seized several horses and a donkey that were denied “basic animal husbandry and adequate nutrition[.]” After the seizure, petitioner claimed the magistrate lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the case because farm animals are excluded under the Code. That motion was granted by the magistrate and the animals were returned to the petitioner. After a short period of time, petitioner was charged with six counts of criminal animal cruelty and again the magistrate dismissed the complaint. However, the magistrate stayed the dismissal on the State's motion so that the circuit court could determine whether § 61-8-19(f) excludes livestock. The circuit court agreed that the section encompasses livestock from inhumane treatment and the magistrate was prohibited from dismissing the complaint. Petitioner now appeals that decision here. This court first examined the anti-cruelty statute finding that the structure of the exception under subsection (f) refers back to the conditional phrase that ends in \"standards\" for keeping the listed categories of animals. The court disagreed with the petitioner's claim of a \"blanket exclusion\" for livestock since the Commissioner of Agriculture has promulgated rules that govern the care of livestock animals that includes equines. The court held that § 61-8-19(f) establishes an exclusion for farm livestock only when they are “kept and maintained according to usual and accepted standards of livestock ... production and management.\" The circuit court's writ of prohibition was affirmed and the matter was remanded.\n\nCHIMP Act requires NIH to transfer all chimps to Chimp Haven. Humane Soc'y of the United States v. Nat'l Institutes of Health, Slip Copy, No. 21-CV-00121-LKG, 2022 WL 17619232 (D. Md. Dec. 13, 2022). Plaintiff animal welfare advocates sued the National Institute of Health (NIH) for failing to transfer all chimpanzees housed at the Alamogordo Primate Facility to a retirement sanctuary known as “Chimp Haven.\" In 2015, NIH officially announced that it would cease biomedical research on chimpanzees and establish a working group to transfer all 288 surplus chimpanzees owned by NIH to Chimp Haven. In 2019, the NIH announced that not all chimpanzees would be transferred to Chimp Haven because 44 of those individuals were too frail for transfer due to medical conditions. After cross-motions for summary judgment, this court considers whether transfer is legally required. On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the plain language of the CHIMP Act requires the transfer of all chimps and the court owes no deference to agency interpretation. In contrast, the Government argues that the decision is consistent with the CHIMP Act because the plain language of the act only requires that surplus chimpanzees offered by NIH be \"accepted\" into CHIMP Haven. The court found that the plain and unambiguous language, and use of the word \"shall,\" in the CHIMP Act requires the NIH to transfer ALL chimpanzees to the federal sanctuary system. In addition, the legislative history of the CHIMP Act reinforces that reading of the statute. While the court recognized NIH's concern toward the frailest chimpanzees, the proper avenue is within the legislative branch. Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment was granted and the Government's cross motion was denied as was the motion to dismiss. The court directed the parties to file a joint status report with views on the relief Plaintiff seeks and how the matter should proceed in light of the instant opinion.\n\nBoard minutes and testimony from village board members in motion to dismiss concerning ordinance violation for keeping excess pets was impermissible. Vill. of Orion v. Hardi, --- N.E.3d ----, 2022 WL 17256761 (Ill. App. Ct. 2022). The plaintiff, the Village of Orion (Village), sued defendants to enjoin them from keeping more than three cats in violation of a Village ordinance. After a dismissal and amended complaint by the Village, the trial court granted defendants' amended motion to dismiss, finding that the Village had previously voted to allow defendants to keep more than three cats. Here, the Village appeals this decision. By way of background, the defendants lived together in the Village since 1998, and one defendant served as the animal control officer for about 15 years. In 2013, the Village enacted an ordinance making it unlawful to keep more than three dogs or cats over the age of six months (except for licensed kennels or veterinarian clinics). The trial court's order found that the Board's language at the 2014 meeting revealed \"unambiguous\" language that defendants could keep the cats in their possession. After remand, the Village filed its second amended complaint in 2022 and defendants against filed a motion to dismiss. After a hearing with testimony from Board members and others, the trial court found there was a motion to allow the keeping of the excess cats and this negated the ability of the Village to proceed with an ordinance violation. On appeal here, this court finds the 2014 board minutes are insufficient to support a motion to dismiss. The submission of the board minutes together with and a defense witness, followed by the Village's presentation of another board member's testimony to refute that, amounted to the court \"improperly allow[ing] the parties to conduct a mini-trial on the veracity of the essential allegations of the complaint.\" Thus, the trial court's order granting the dismissal was reversed and the matter was remanded.\n\n2022\n\nNovember/December 2022\n\nDog left in parked car on \"very hot\" day created a substantial and unjustifiable risk sufficient to establish criminal negligence. State v. Butler, --- A.3d ----, 2022 WL 4488304 (N.H. Sept. 28, 2022). Defendant Kevin Butler was convicted of criminal negligence after he left his dog inside a parked vehicle for 45 minutes when the temperature was over 90 degrees outside. The charge came after a neighbor noticed a dog in the vehicle that was \"scratching at the windows and the door\" and appeared to be in distress. After calling the police, an animal control officer removed the animal from the unlocked car and transported the distressed dog to a local veterinary clinic. At trial, the defendant testified that he was out running errands on a \"very hot\" day, and asked his son to get the dog out of the car as Defendant's hands were full. On appeal here, Defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish the mens rea of criminal negligence for both charges. The State must prove that a defendant “fail[ed] to become aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct\" and that this risk constitutes a gross deviation from conduct performed by a reasonable person. Here, the court found that the record supports the trial court's conclusion that the defendant failed to become aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the dog would overheat in the car and that his failure to perceive this risk constituted a gross deviation from reasonable care. The temperature was high that day, the car was parked in direct sunlight with all the windows up, and the dog was left for around an hour. The fact that Defendant relied upon his 8-year-old son to remove the dog under these circumstances constituted a gross deviation from reasonable care. This was not \"mere inattention\" as Defendant claimed. The conviction was affirmed.\n\nSummary judgment not appropriate in Indiana where evidence presented that Great Dane dogs have a \"natural propensity\" to be territorial. Daniels v. Drake, 195 N.E.3d 866 (Ind. Ct. App. 2022). Plaintiff Damon Daniels appeals from the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the Drakes. The incident stems from an unprovoked dog bite at defendants' home. The Drakes live on a large, rural property in Indiana with no neighbors. The Drakes' dog \"Max,\" a large Great Dane, would roam the property unrestrained. In September of 2020, Daniels, a FedEx driver, entered the property to deliver a package. After walking toward Lisa with the package, Max barked once and then bit Daniels in the abdomen. Daniels sustained puncture wounds, a one-centimeter laceration, swelling and a hematoma from the bite. After Daniels filed the instant complaint seeking damages related to the dog bite, the Drakes filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that they did not have actual knowledge of Max's vicious propensities prior to the bite. In response, Daniels contended that Great Danes have a \"natural propensity\" to be territorial, which is exacerbated by isolation. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal here, the court explained that Indiana law states that knowledge of a dog's dangerous or vicious tendencies may not be inferred from a first-time, unprovoked bite, but that knowledge may be inferred where evidence shows that the particular breed to which the owner's dog belongs is known to exhibit such tendencies.\" While the court observed that the Drakes presented evidence of a lack of actual knowledge of Max's vicious propensities, the expert who testified on Great Dane behavior presented evidence that Great Danes might behave with \"territorial aggressive tendencies\" in a given situation. The Drakes argued on appeal (for the first time) that this evidence by a canine behavioral expert was \"immaterial\" and cannot be used to show what lay people would know about Great Danes. The court was unpersuaded by the Drakes' novel argument, and this created a genuine issue of material fact. Thus, this court reversed the order granting summary judgment for the Drakes and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\nVirginia animal cruelty statute does not require that malicious maiming of livestock animals must be against the will of the owner. Haefele v. Commonwealth, 878 S.E.2d 422 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 18, 2022). Defendant Haefele was convicted of two counts of maliciously maiming the livestock of another, in violation of Code § 18.2-144, and two counts of conspiring to maliciously maim the livestock of another. Defendant's neighbor possessed two goats on her property in Spotsylvania County and received several complaints. Ultimately, the code enforcement officer instructed the neighbor to remove the goats and even offered assistance in relocating them. However, about a month after this order, Defendant and two other men entered the neighbor's goat pen with the neighbor's permission and killed the goats with “what looked like a two-by-four with spikes wrapped around it.\" After investigation and review of video footage taken of the attack, Defendant and the two others were charged and convicted by bench trial in 2021. Testimony by an expert in veterinary pathology revealed that the animals suffered before they died. On appeal here, Defendant contends that he could not be convicted “because the defendant [Haefele] was acting with the permission of, and in concert with, the owner of the animals in question.” The court disagreed, finding no language in the statute that limits the statute only to acts that were against the will of the owner. Defendant also claims he did not act with requisite malice because the “the owner of the goats had given him permission to act against the goats.\" Again, the court recounted the brutal and repeated acts against the goats that occurred over a ten-minute span. Thus, the evidence showed that Defendant acted with sufficiently demonstrated malice. While livestock owners can ask others to euthanize or properly slaughter their livestock, the manner in which Defendant caused the goats' deaths clearly demonstrated malicious intent. Affirmed and remanded.\n\nFelonious cruelty to animals conviction in North Carolina affirmed where jury concluded that a defendant maliciously set fire that proximately caused the puppy's death. State v. Charles, 878 S.E.2d 166 (N.C. Ct. App., 2022). Defendant Cheito Charles appealed from judgments entered upon a jury verdict finding him guilty of second-degree arson and felonious cruelty to animals. The incident stemmed from a house fire in the summer of 2020 where the defendant set fire to his sister's boyfriend's house while the boyfriend's puppy was still inside. At trial, the defendant contended that there was no evidence that he knew the existence of the puppy. However, the trial court instructed the jury that, in order to convict Defendant of felonious cruelty to animals, the jury need only conclude that Defendant maliciously and “intentionally start[ed] a house fire which proximately result[ed] in the injury or death to the animal.” There was no need to prove that Defendant was aware of the puppy in the home. Ultimately, Defendant was convicted of second-degree arson and felonious cruelty to animals. On appeal here, Defendant argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury on the doctrine of transferred intent regarding the animal cruelty charge. This court rebuffed this argument, finding that there was no error with instruction since the jury only needed to conclude that Defendant maliciously set the fire that proximately caused the puppy's death. This same reasoning also supported the sufficiency of the evidence claim. The court dispensed with Defendant's final argument as to the sufficiency of the indictment. As a result, the appellate court found no error with Defendant's trial.\n\nSeptember/October 2022\n\nOregon court says animals lack capacity to sue on own behalf because of their \"distinctive incapacity.\" Justice by and through Mosiman v. Vercher, --- P.3d ----, 321 Or.App. 439 (2022). The Oregon Court of Appeals, as a matter of first impression, considers whether a horse has the legal capacity to sue in an Oregon court. The Executive Director of Sound Equine Options (SEO), Kim Mosiman, filed a complaint naming a horse (“Justice”)as plaintiff with the Mosiman acting as his guardian, and claiming negligence against his former owner. In the instant appeal, Mosiman challenges the trial court's grant of defendant's motion to dismiss. In 2018, Mosiman filed a complaint on Justice's behalf for a single claim of negligence per se, alleging that defendant violated the Oregon anti-cruelty statute ORS 167.330(1) by failing to provide minimum care. Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that a horse lacks the legal capacity to sue and the court granted dismissal. Here, the appellate court first found no statutory authority for a court to appoint a guardian for an animal because \"a horse inherently lacks self-determination and the ability to express its wishes in a manner the legal system would recognize.\" The animal has a \"distinctive incapacity\" that sets it apart from humans with legal disabilities that require appointment of a legal guardian. The court reaffirmed the law's treatment of animals as personal property and found no support in the precedent for permitting an animal to vindicate its own legal rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.\n\nHearing on forfeiture of animals does not require a jury trial in Oregon. State v. Hershey, 370 Or. 200, 515 P.3d 899 (2022). Defendant's animals (22 dogs, 3 horses, and 7 chickens) were impounded in 2017 after he was charged with second-degree animal neglect. The district attorney asked the court for immediate forfeiture of the animals or for defendant to post a bond for care within 72 hours of a hearing on the matter. In response, defendant filed a motion for jury trial. The lower court denied defendant's motion and the court of appeals affirmed the ruling. Here, the Oregon Supreme court considers whether a special statutory proceeding brought under ORS 167.347 provides a right to a jury trial in accordance with Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution. The Court first looked at the nature of the relief in the statute insofar as whether such relief is equitable or legal. The Court found the purpose of the statute is mainly to provide unjust enrichment of the owner when the owner does not pay for the costs of their animals' care. As such, the court found the relief was equitable in nature. The decision of the Court of Appeals and the order of the circuit court were affirmed.\n\nWild horses are not estrays for purposes of New Mexico's law regardless of whether they are found on private land. Wild Horse Observers Association, Inc. v. New Mexico Livestock Board, --- P.3d ----, 2022 WL 2901248 (N.M. Ct. App. July 22, 2022). This appeal examines the protection afforded to New Mexico's free-roaming horses under NMSA 1978, Section 77-18-5 (2007). The New Mexico Livestock Board (the Board) appeals from a district court order granting declaratory and injunctive relief sought by Wild Horse Observers Association, Inc. (WHOA). WHOA brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Board and others regarding the status of horses corralled by a private citizen on private property. The citizen had initially complained to the Board about the free-roaming horses on her property and was told that the Board only takes possession of horses corralled by citizens. The citizen did so, and the Board took possession of the herd, where it then posted on its website that the horses would be sold at auction. WHOA filed the instant emergency action, stating that the Board exceeded its authority and unlawfully treated the subject horses as estray livestock. The group sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing the Board from impounding or selling the subject horses. The district court granted WHOA's request for a TRO, thereby prohibiting the Board from taking any action with the horses. After a bench trial on the merits, the district court determined that the Board's actions to take possession and sell the subject horses were contrary to the Board's statutory authority, enjoined the Board from “further unlawful possession and selling” of the subject horses, and awarded WHOA costs and attorney fees. This court found no error with the lower court concluding that the horses should be protected as “wild horses” because the definition of that term does not depend on whether, at the moment of their capture, the horses were on land that is private, but instead depends on whether the horses generally roam public land. Therefore, the horses were not estrays. Ultimately, this court affirmed the district court's order to the extent that it correctly determined that the subject horses are wild horse rather than estray, but reversed the district court's determination that the Board should have acted according to its statutory duties under Section 77-18-5. The case was remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion and further consideration of attorney fees.\n\nJuly/August 2022\n\nIncident involving dog and another resident and whether this was a \"direct threat\" raised genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in FHA housing discrimination case. Andrade v. Westlo Mgmt. LLC, --- A.3d ----, 2022 WL 2183604 (R.I. June 17, 2022). The defendants, Westlo Management LLC (Westlo) seek review of a Superior Court order granting partial summary judgment on several counts in favor of the plaintiffs, Curtis W. Andrade and The Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (the commission). The defendants assert that the existence of genuine issues of material fact precluded partial summary judgment and that the commission did not have standing to intervene in this matter. The matter stems from a denial of plaintiff's request for a reasonable accommodation at Westlo's property. Prior to moving in to Westlo's low-income property, plaintiff was told by a leasing agent that he was not permitted to have his dog, Enzo, because the dog (a pit bull) was on the complex' restricted breed list. After cross-motions for summary judgment by both parties, the hearing justice granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding that Westlo had discriminated against Andrade. However, she found there to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the dog had requisite training. The justice also acknowledged that she had misstated that the request for the reasonable accommodation had occurred before an aggressive incident with the other resident. As a result, she declined to make a finding of fact on that issue. On defendants' appeal of summary judgment, defendants argue that the issue of whether an accommodation is reasonable under the FHA is a factual one and thus it was error for the hearing justice to make those determinations. The Supreme Court looked at the similar language of both the federal FHA and the state FHPA. While the court found that plaintiff met the definition for disability under the laws and that defendant was made aware of plaintiff's need for reasonable accommodation, it was troubled by the \"direct threat\" posed by the dog. Specifically, the court found issue with the date mix-up in the initial hearing for the incident with the dog and another resident. Therefore, due to the highly fact-specific nature of the assessment of an assistance animal as well as the conflicting evidence presented, this court disagreed with the hearing justice and concluded summary judgment was not appropriate. The record was remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion..\n\nNew York holds that animals cannot be the subject of habeas corpus relief. Nonhuman Rts. Project, Inc. v. Breheny, --- N.E.3d ----, 2022 WL 2122141 (N.Y. June 14, 2022). This New York case centers on a petition of habeas corpus for an elephant named \"Happy\" who is housed at the Bronx Zoo. Petitioner Nonhuman Rights Project is a not-for-profit corporation with a mission of seeking to establish that “at least some nonhuman animals” are “legal persons” entitled to fundamental rights, including “bodily integrity and bodily liberty.” In 2018, petitioner commenced this habeas proceeding in Supreme Court against respondents. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus “on behalf of Happy,” an Asian elephant that petitioner claimed was unlawfully confined at the Zoo in violation of her right to bodily liberty. Happy has resided at the Bronx Zoo for the last 45 years and has been held in captivity since she was approximately one year old. Petitioners request that she be transferred to an “appropriate sanctuary\" where she could potentially be integrated with other elephants. Specifically, respondents argued that there was no legal basis for habeas relief and that Happy's living conditions comply with all relevant laws and accepted standards of care. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on the ground “that animals are not ‘persons’ entitled to rights and protections afforded by the writ of habeas corpus” and that habeas relief is not available for an animal. On petitioner's appeal, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, reasoning that “the writ of habeas corpus is limited to human beings.” While the court acknowledged that the law recognizes that animals are not mere \"things,\" and existing animal protection laws underscore this conclusion, the scope of habeas corpus does not include animals. As such, the order of the Appellate Division was affirmed.\n\nMay/June 2022\n\nPlaintiffs fail to establish standing to force SeaWorld to release records related to marine mammal deaths at facilities. Marino v. Nat'l Oceanic & Atmospheric Admin., --- F.4th ----, 2022 WL 1548489 (D.C. Cir. May 17, 2022). Plaintiff animal welfare organizations sued the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeking to enforce conditions in permits held by SeaWorld. In 1994, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was amended such that it shifted authority to oversee conditions of marine mammals at exhibitors from NMFS to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). After three pre-1994 orcas died at SeaWorld, plaintiffs tried to convince NMFS that it still had the authority to enforce the pre-1994 rules related to release of records, but NMFS contended that its authority was extinguished in 1994. Plaintiffs brought suit, arguing that the NMFS's policy rests upon an arbitrary and capricious interpretation of the MMPA, and that its refusal to enforce the permit conditions was also arbitrary and capricious. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ suit for lack of standing. On appeal here, the court examined plaintiffs' standing under the three-part Lujan test. The court found a lack of redressability for the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts from which the court could infer the relief they seek would likely cause the NMFS to redress their alleged harms. In fact, because the MMPA language on permits is permissive, NMFS has discretion whether to enforce them. This is coupled with the fact that there is no evidence that third-party SeaWorld will turn over the reports even if NMFS were to direct them. Therefore, this court held that the district court did not err in determining that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue this case. Affirmed.\n\nCourt upholds California ban on sale of poultry that has been force-fed to produce foie gras. Ass'n des Éleveurs de Canards et d'Oies du Quebec v. Bonta, --- F.4th ----, 2022 WL 1436840 (9th Cir. May 6, 2022). California prohibits the in-state sale of products that are “the result of force feeding a bird for the purpose of enlarging the bird's liver beyond normal size.” Cal. Health & Safety Code § 25982. The law had a 7.5-year grace period before it went into effect. After nine years of litigation and in their third set of appeals before this Court, the parties ask the court here to decide whether California's sales ban is preempted by the Poultry Products Inspection Act (“PPIA”) or violates the dormant Commerce Clause. As to the first issue of preemption, the plaintiff sellers contend that at least one USDA Policy Book defines foie gras as liver from poultry that has been \"specially fed and fattened\" and other USDA documents suggest this is done via forced-feeding. Thus, contend the sellers, it is impossible to produce and properly label foie gras, as is required by the PPIA, and then also comply with the California law. The court disagreed with the assertion, finding that the sellers can still force feed birds to make their products, but not sell those in California. Further, the sellers raise a new suggestion that the ban constitutes express preemption because force feeding operates as an \"ingredient requirement.\" Essentially, they contend you cannot have foie gras without force-feeding birds. This was also rejected, as the court found nothing new that would reverse the precedent established in the prior decision by the court. The sellers' argument that the ban is \"unduly burdensome\" also failed since there is not requirement that a state impose the \"least burdensome\" method for in-state commerce. The court held that the sales ban is neither preempted nor unconstitutional and that the specified transactions are out-of-state sales permitted by California law.\n\nApril 2022\n\nWashington Supreme Court holds animal cruelty is a crime of domestic violence. State v. Abdi-Issa, 504 P.3d 223 (Wash. 2022). The incident stems from an evening after defendant insisted on taking his girlfriend's dog, a small Chihuahua and Dachshund mix, for a walk. The girlfriend testified that defendant had a history of disliking the dog and had previously threatened to kill both her and her dog. On that evening, two witnesses heard \"a sound of great distress\" and saw defendant making \"brutal stabbing\" motions toward the dog and then saw him kick the dog so hard that she flew into the air. Police officers responded and then transported the dog to a veterinary clinic where the dog subsequently died. One of the two witnesses had a panic attack at the scene and testified later that she continued to have panic attacks thereafter with flashbacks of the experience. Defendant was charged and found guilty of first-degree animal cruelty with a domestic violence designation and also two sentencing aggravators. On appeal, the Court of Appeals vacated the domestic violence designation and the impact on others sentence aggravator. On appeal here, the Supreme Court found that animal cruelty could be designated a crime of domestic violence. The statute defining domestic violence has a non-exhaustive list of what crimes can constitute domestic violence. While animal cruelty is not listed, the court found that testimony of defendant's prior controlling behavior coupled with research showing how abusers use violence toward their victims' pets to manipulate and terrorize victims was sufficient. As to the sentencing aggravator, the court found that defendant's actions had a destructive and foreseeable impact on the witnesses who saw the animal cruelty. Thus, under these facts, the Court ruled that animal cruelty can be designated a crime of domestic violence and that the jury was properly instructed that it could find the impact on others sentencing aggravator. The judgment of Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.\n\nAfter private complaint filed by organization, Pennsylvania court reverses district attorney decision not to charge local farm for animal cruelty based on undercover investigation. In re Priv. Crim. Complaint Filed by Animal Outlook, 2022 WL 588181, 2022 PA Super 37 (Feb. 28, 2022). The requested charges stem from information obtained from an undercover agent who was employed at Martin Farms, where she captured video of cruel mistreatment of animals on the farm that AO contends constituted criminal animal cruelty. Ultimately, the PSP issued a press release in March 2020 that indicated that the District Attorney had declined prosecution. After this, AO drafted private criminal complaints that were submitted to the Magisterial District Judge who concluded that the DA correctly determined that there was not enough evidence for prosecution. AO then filed a petition of review of the disapproval of its private complaints pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 506(B)(1) before the trial court, which again dismissed AO petition for review. AO filed this appeal to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. In reviewing the trial court's decision, the Superior Court found that the trial court committed multiple errors of law. This court found that AO provided sufficient evidence to show prima facie cases of neglect, cruelty, and aggravated cruelty with respect to the incidents. The court then analyzed whether the record supported a defense of \"normal agricultural operations\" defense that would counter the charges. This court found that incidents like the dehorning of cattle that already had horns fused to the skull and extreme tail twisting and shocking were sufficient to overcome the affirmative defense. The trial court's dismissal of AO's petition for review was reversed and the trial court was ordered to direct the DA to accept and transmit charges for prosecution.\n\nIowa's new \"ag-gag\" law ruled unconstitutional due to viewpoint discrimination of protected speech. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Reynolds, --- F.Supp.3d ----, 2022 WL 777231 (S.D. Iowa Mar. 14, 2022). Plaintiffs contend that Iowa's new \"ag-gag\" law criminalizes their actions in gathering information through undercover investigations at animal production facilities. Both parties have filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiffs contend that the new law violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because it discriminates based on content and viewpoint and cannot survive strict scrutiny. The court first noted that the issue with § 717A.3B, and other laws aimed at prohibiting trespassers at agricultural facilities, is the law seeks to single out specific individuals for punishment based on their viewpoint regarding such facilities. This law operates in a viewpoint discriminatory fashion because it prohibits the deceptive trespasser who gains access or obtain employment at an agricultural facility with the intent to cause “economic harm ... to the agricultural production facility's ... business interest\" as opposed to trespassers with an intent to benefit the facility. Thus, Section 717A.3B does not focus solely on the right to exclude, the legally cognizable harm of trespass, but only on the right to exclude those with particular viewpoints. While the court noted that a state legislature may determine whether specific facilities—such as agricultural facilities, nuclear power plants, military bases, or other sensitive buildings—are entitled to special legal protections, the First Amendment does not allow those protections to be based on a violator's viewpoint. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment was granted and Defendant's was denied.\n\nJanuary/March 2022\n\nIn a matter of first impression, court finds dog suffered \"substantial pain\" under anti-cruelty law by relying on human cases. State v. Hackett, --- P.3d ----, 315 Or.App. 360, 2021 WL 4987629 (2021). Defendant was convicted of second-degree animal abuse, among other crimes. On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) and imposed fines (in addition to incarceration) without first determining his ability to pay. A witness was visiting her mother and heard a dog \"yike\" in pain outside while she was at her mother's house. The dog was whimpering and laying in submission as the defendant hit the dog. Then, after going inside briefly to call police, the witness returned outside to see defendant was \"just going to town and beating the dog\" and throwing rocks at the dog to the point where the witness was concerned for the dog's life. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred on the second-degree animal abuse charge because the evidence did not permit a rational inference that Bosco experienced \"substantial pain\" as required by the statute. The court, in a matter of first impression, examined whether the dog experienced substantial pain. Defendant suggests that his dog did not experience a significant duration of pain to permit a finding of substantial pain. The court disagreed, analogizing with cases where a human victim could not testify concerning the pain. Thus, the court concluded that the evidence supported a reasonable inference that Bosco's pain was not \"fleeting\" or \"momentary.\" Not only did the witnesses see the defendant kick and pelt the dog with rocks, but one witness left to phone police and returned to find the defendant still abusing the dog. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's MJOA, but the matter was remanded for entry of judgment that omitted the \"due in 30 days\" for the fines.\n\nCourt not required to return dogs to defendant whose criminal charges related to dogs were dismissed or compensate for seized dogs. Siegel v. State, 2021 Ark. 228, 635 S.W.3d 313 (Ark., 2021), reh'g denied (Jan. 13, 2022). Defendant Karen Siegel was convicted of 31 misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty based on 31 breeding dogs that were seized from her home. At issue here on appeal by defendant is whether the underlying statutes that allows seizure of the animals, Arkansas Code Annotated sections 5-62-106 and 5-62-111, are constitutional. In addition, defendant argues that by not ordering return of the seized dogs to defendant and compensating defendant for her loss of property was error. The first circuit court criminal case was dismissed on speedy-trial grounds and that ruling was upheld in later appeal. The issues on the instant appeal relate to the status of the seized dogs. Siegel argues that the circuit court erred by not ordering the return of her seized property and also not assigning a value for the property that was destroyed or damaged. The court here looked at the language of the seizure statute and found that Siegel failed to post a bond to care for the dog as is contemplated by the statute. The statute provides no award of damages to a defendant and the county that seized the dog is not a party in the criminal action brought by the state. Thus, the lower court was correct in stating that Siegel's remedy was a separate civil action. As to Siegel's challenges to the constitutionality of those statutes, this court found the argument moot since review of the issue would have no practical legal effect upon a then-existing controversy. The case was affirmed in part and dismissed as moot in part.\n\nEvidence of dogfighting including training equipment, weights, scales, and a \"pit\" were sufficient to sustain conviction. State v. Crew, --- S.E.2d ----, 2022 WL 151341 (N.C.App.,2022). Defendant Daniel Crew appealed his convictions for dogfighting, felony cruelty to animals, misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and restraining dogs in a cruel manner. Crew also challenges the trial court's restitution orders totaling $70,000, which the trial court immediately converted to civil judgments. The arrest and conviction of defendant stemmed from an investigation at defendant's residence, where 30 pit bulls were recovered with injuries \"similar to injuries a dog would sustain through dogfighting.\" In addition, publications and notes on preparing for a fight were found, as well as dogfighting training equipment such as a \"jenny,\" staging area for fights, and weight scales for weighing dogs. The State charged Crew with fifteen counts of engaging in dogfighting, one count of allowing property to be used for dogfighting, five counts of felony cruelty to animals, twenty-five counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and sixteen counts of restraining dogs in a cruel manner. Ultimately, Crew was convicted by the jury of eleven counts of dogfighting, three counts of felony cruelty to animals, fourteen counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals, and two counts of restraining dogs in a cruel manner. Defendant appealed his criminal judgment and petitioned for a writ of certiorari for the award of restitution entered as civil judgments. On appeal, this court rejected defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence of dogfighting. The police found training equipment, medication commonly used in dogfighting operations, and a dogfighting \"pit\" or training area as well as the notes preparing dogs to fight. A reasonable juror could have concluded that Crew intended to engage in dogfighting. The court found no error concerning the criminal convictions, but vacated the conversion of the restitution to civil judgments against defendant.\n\n2021\n\nDecember 2021\n\nCourt was within discretion to award dog to husband where wife claimed dog was an ESA but did not present evidence of disability. Harby v. Harby, --- So.3d ----, 2021 WL 5344799 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2021). This Florida case involves an appeal of a final judgment of dissolution of marriage. With respect to animal law, the wife appealed the trial court's distribution of family dogs, Liberty and Nico, to the former husband. According to testimony, the dogs were bonded to each other. The former wife testified that the family adopted Liberty \"to be an emotional support dog\" and was her constant companion. Since separation, the dogs have been in the husband's possession and care. The trial court determined that the dogs were marital property and that the wife appeared to be in good health with no physical or mental disabilities. Further, both parties agreed the dogs should not be separated from each other and the court found the dogs had been in the husband's possession since the parties separated. On appeal, the wife argues that the trial court's distribution of the family dogs to Former Husband was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record. In particular, the wife contends that one of the dogs is her emotional support animal and former husband expressed no desire or claim for the dogs in testimony. The court first observed that Florida is not one of the handful of states with statutes that give pets a special property status in distribution of marital assets. Instead, animals are considered personal property. Here, the court found both parties have cared for the dogs at times and the husband cared for them after the parties separated in 2017. And, while the court found that Liberty was \"emotionally comforting,\" there was no evidence that the former wife had a disability and that Liberty provided emotional support to alleviate an effect of such disability. Thus, the role Liberty played was to provide comfort and companionship like most household pets. The appellate court concluded that the trial court acted within its discretion by awarding the family dogs to the former husband.\n\nCourt erred in granting visitation for dogs after marriage dissolution. Matter of Marriage of Niemi, 496 P.3d 305 (Wash. Ct. App. 2021). Douglas Niemi appealed the trial court's order granting Mariah Niemi visits with their two dogs, which were awarded to Douglas as his separate property in a dissolution proceeding. Douglas and Mariah were married for 27 years and had two large dogs who were each about two years old. During the petition for legal separation, Mariah asked for 10 hours a week of visitation with the dogs because they were \"family members.\" Following the trial, Mariah continued to emphasize her desire to have access to the dogs and the court ultimately awarded the dogs to Douglas as separate property, but allowed Mariah visits with the dogs three times a week. Douglas appealed that award, contending that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding visitation of his separate property. Mariah countered with the fact a court has discretion to grant her access to this \"special classification\" of property. Here, the Court of Appeals agreed with Douglas, finding that the lower court had no authority under Washington law to compel a party to produce separate property after a marital dissolution. The court also held that is not the province of the court to recognize a special category of personal property when the statute has not done so. Finally, the court observed that such agreements about visitation with animals would lead to continuing supervision and enforcement problems in the court system. Because the trial court exceeded its authority in awarding visitation rights, this court reversed and remanded the issue for the trial court to strike the provision related to visitation and maintenance costs for the dogs..\n\nDog fighting expert witness was qualified due to extensive experience and training in investigating dog fighting operations, regardless of college degree. Queen v. State, --- So.3d ----, 2021 WL 4471099 (Miss. Sept. 30, 2021). Defendant Tommie Queen was convicted of three counts of dog fighting contrary to Mississippi law. The resulting conviction began with in 2017 after a sheriff's officer received a call about dogs barking and possibly fighting. After being dispatched to defendant's property, the officer encountered multiple dogs on chains and dogs that were actively fighting each other. The officer obtained a search warrant and seized numerous items including heavy logging chains, bite sticks, intravenous (IV) bags containing saline, medicine bottles, vials of vitamins, muscle milk and other muscle-building items, several scales, and a treadmill. Approximately five or six badly injured dogs were taken to a veterinarian and humanely euthanized. Defendant was convicted on three of the nine indicted counts of animal fighting and sentenced to three years on each count to run consecutively. On appeal here, defendant raised three issues: (1) whether the trial court erred by tendering Kyle Held as an expert in the field of animal cruelty and dog fighting; (2) whether the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Queen of dog fighting; and (3) whether the trial court erred by denying Queen's motion to recuse. As to the first issue on qualification of the expert witness, the proffered expert, Kyle Held, had been employed by the ASPCA for approximately ten years as the director of investigations. Not only was Held certified by the National Animal Control Association, but he had investigated dog fighting operations \"probably a few hundred\" times according to his testimony. This included the largest organized dog fighting seizure in history. Moreover, Held indicated he testified in approximately 100 animal cruelty or animal fighting cases and has been qualified as an expert six times in previous dog fighting cases. While defendant argued that Held should not be qualified as an expert because he did not hold any college degrees, this court found that argument without merit. After dispatching the other two claims, Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed.\n\nExcess transfer of dogs under PA Dog Law was single violation rather than continuing violation.
