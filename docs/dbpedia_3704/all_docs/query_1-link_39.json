        "text": "Featuring a cast that included Jools Holland on keyboards, Lee Brilleaux on harp, and Linda McCartney on backing vocals, Thriller — the group's third album and its last on Island Records — wasn't issued until March 1979, a full 16 months after Life on the Line. Presumably, part of the delay was because its predecessor was still selling well.\n\n\"Life on the Line sold really well,\" Barrie emphasizes. \"So, Island said take a bit of time with the next one. We'd recorded the first one at Jackson's really cheaply; the second one was recorded in a bleeding church. We said, 'Let's find a proper studio, and we want a proper producer.' So, they got us Peter Ker. He wore tweed jackets and things like that. Gawd!\" (Best known for his work with Arthur Brown and Love Sculpture in the 1960s, Ker had recently produced Approved by the Motors).\n\nBarrie continues, \"We recorded it at Abbey Road... I know the Beatles used it, but it was built for orchestras. It was all wrong. And the daft thing is, when we did the rough mixes, it sounded like the fucking dog's bollocks! Really good! Even if I say so meself. That album, between mixes, is a real good album. An album I'd be proud to say, 'I did that.' But the finished product is well lame. I'm ashamed of it. I really am.\"\n\nThere's precious little documented information to be found about the Hot Rods' second US tour (even the band are unsure about the actual dates), but it ties in timewise here. \"I have a feeling that it would have been the fall of '78, after the recording of Thriller,\" guesses Graeme in one of our email exchanges. \"We played a few shows with the Police and Tom Petty but didn't get back out to the West Coast because we'd run out of money.\"\n\nBarrie describes the second US tour as \"Hard. Bloody. Work.\"\n\nOn his website, Graeme mentions that the Hot Rods were already beginning to splinter: \"The band had not been playing together for some time, what with external commitments by Paul and Steve with various Yankee musos, and the edge was gone. What used to be tight was sloppy, although there were still the occasional nights where we performed well.\"\n\nHe's also aware that by then, they'd missed their opportunity. \"The audiences were not there. Apart from good attendances when supporting Tom Petty and the Police, we were not earning enough to pay for the tour. We were driving 4-500 miles a day between gigs with no hope in hell of sticking to the 55 m.p.h. speed limit, and no money to pay the inevitable speeding fines. The only way to get paid was to get to the gig, and the only way to get to the gig was to charge the fines to my Visa card. We had to abandon the tour and fly back home.\"\n\nGraeme models the latest in CBS SUCKS attire.\n\nPhoto from Graeme's website. Photographer is unknown (although it\n\nmight have been taken at the same photo session as the one in\n\nTommy Dean's office above).\n\nIn March 1979, the group toured the UK in support of Thriller. Opening for the Hot Rods were the Members, who had stormed to #12 in the UK singles charts with \"The Sound of the Suburbs\" a month earlier and were scoring again with \"Offshore Banking Business.\"\n\nOn the punk77 website, Paul Gray states: \"[The Members] were actually getting more airplay than us... Where we were starting to sound tired and, dare I say it, jaded, they were fresh and enthusiastic. Looking back on it now we were knackered, we'd been worked to the bone, and there was no fooling the punters. We were drinking loads — a bottle of Jim Beam for me, Southern Comfort for Bazza, Vodka for Dave — it would all be gone before we left the dressing room... What had once been a great adventure had ceased to be fun and, although we wouldn't have admitted it, we were going thru the motions.\"\n\nThe grind of incessant gigging and financial strain had taken its toll. They needed a break, but Barrie grumbles: \"No one thought of saying, 'Let's send them to the Canaries for a couple of weeks and let 'em sit on the beach. Let 'em change color from white to bronze. Give 'em some food instead of cocaine.' That never happened. I mean, we had Graeme Douglas — he did tours of hospitals. Literally, out of one hospital, do the gig, then back into the hospital. Move into another hospital, do the gig, into another hospital. Paul Gray spit up blood every day for about a month. Steve was constantly shaking. He couldn't stop shaking for weeks. It was stupid.\"\n\nEddie and the Hot Rods in the centerfold of Look In magazine.\n\nThe magazine is dated 1978, however, this photo was most likely taken\n\non the roof of the K West Radio building in LA during the 1977 US tour.\n\nIn May, the Hot Rods were fighting rumors of a split. The Punk Diary entry for the 29th has all the details: \"Talk of a breakup was fuelled by the band being dropped by Island. Their manager, Roger Harding explained that the band is maintaining a low profile while they work up new songs and new stage routines. Paul Gray is currently touring with the Members while Barrie and Steve are playing in a side group called Plus Support. It's uncertain if the Rods are really through or just in a holding pattern. What is clear is that in five short years, the world surrounding them has changed dramatically and they might not be able to compete as Eddie and the Hot Rods.\"\n\nIn August, the Hot Rods were still together (after a fashion) and signed to EMI — although Barrie asserts Island didn't drop the band. Instead, he indicates their manager instigated the move to a new label: \"That's when Ed Hollis wasn't getting his own way at Island. Chris Blackwell [Island's founder] said to me, 'If you're gonna go, you have my blessing. I really hope you do well. But remember, you've always got a home here.'\"\n\nEddie and the Hot Rods on the cover of Sounds\n\nPoll Winners issue - February 19, 1977\n\nIn 1980, EMI half-heartedly issued the Al Kooper-produced Fish 'n' Chips. It was the Hot Rods' fourth (and final) major label LP, but Barrie calls it \"a waste of time.\"\n\n\"EMI spent all this time and money recording it,\" he argues, \"and then said they weren't gonna release it.\" When the album did \"slip out\" there was no publicity behind it, and it disappeared without a trace.\n\nBarrie also concedes that they hadn't written enough material to fill the record. \"There weren't enough songs. That's why there's some odd bits. That's the only thing I don't like. There's some funny old things!\"\n\nWas there any unreleased EMI material?\n\n\"There must have been because we were planning another album. It never got recorded, just demoed. I don't know how much there was now or what it was.\"\n\nHarry Maloney had replaced Ed Hollis, and both Paul and Graeme had left before recording even started on Fish 'n' Chips.\n\nIn early 1980, Paul jumped ship and replaced Algy Ward in the Damned. Graeme exited a little earlier due to his deteriorating health. \"My diabetic control was slipping,\" he writes on his website, \"and I was experiencing more and more episodes of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). This made my judgement quite arbitrary and my behaviour quite weird.\"\n\nGraeme made his departure during a gig at the London Lyceum when, halfway through the show, he handed his guitar to a photographer and crawled about the stage trying to bite the drummer's ankles. \"The memory of Steve valiantly trying to keep time whilst simultaneously bashing Graeme on the head with his sticks is one that will live with me forever,\" muses Paul on the punk77 website.\n\nEddie and the Hot Rods — New Flag Poster\n\nOfficial website: www.eddieandthehotrods.com\n\nBarrie allows that \"we did a few bits and pieces on our own for different firms\" during the early '80s (such as his own long-term stint with the Inmates, and Steve Nicol spending time with One the Juggler), but he insists that the Hot Rods never really split up.\n\nAnd really, the band is still going today — albeit with Barrie now the only original member. (Please see the update from Dipster Dean below.)\n\nThere's just time to ask a question about one of my favorite Hot Rods' tunes before Barrie has to go. Was the phone number in \"Telephone Girl\" (838-5924) anyone's actual number?\n\n\"Ha! When we wrote it, the number I chose happened to be someone's number in England. So we thought, we'll just find a number that ain't used. Well... that number ain't used in England. We didn't think about any other countries, did we? Oh my god, did we get into trouble! On the first American tour, every time I did an interview... 'We've got a few people who aren't very happy that you used their phone number.' I just kept saying, 'I'm sorry.' We didn't think the record was even gonna come out over there.\"\n\n(Update: Dipster Dean has noted in the comments section that Barrie and drummer Simon Bowley restarted the Hot Rods in early 2000. The lineup which included Richard Holgarth and Chris Taylor on guitars, Simon Bowley on drums, and Dipster on bass continued to tour and record until Barrie’s death in October 2019.)\n\n* * *"
