        "text": "by Gervase Markham and Lewis Machin\n\nEdited by Kris Towse (2009)\n\nThe Dumb Knight.\n\nA historical comedy, acted sundry times by the Children of his Majesties Revels.\n\nLondon.\n\nPrinted by Nicholas Okes, for John Bache, and are to be sold at his shop in Popes-head Palace, near to the Royal Exchange. 1608.\n\nIntroduction to the play\n\nThe Dumb Knight, first published in 1608 (and it is from this quarto the play is edited), is a troubled but entertaining play. The play has two authors, Gervase Markham and Lewis Machin, although evidence the two collaborated is minimal, leading to an incoherent play that nevertheless is highly entertaining.\n\nThe Authors:\n\nGervase Markham (1568? -1637) is by far the more famous of the two authors, if only by virtue of the:\n\nAstonishing variety of literary publicationspoetry, drama, and prose combined with an equally astonishing variety of non-literary works on topics such as horsemanship, veterinary medicine, husbandry, domestic economy, and even military training\n\nHowever, as F.N.L Poynter rather cruelly points out, Markham's brief interest in theatre during his previously successful literary career \"is no substitute for dramatic talent\" . An attack that is somewhat justified by reading any plot summary of The Dumb Knight, as this reveals Markham's unfortunate affliction of \"not knowing when to stop\" as the play easily covers \"enough material for two plays\" . Outside of theatre however Markham is an accomplished poet, and as Joseph Quincy Adams Jr. states, Markham is an \"excellent classical scholar\" .\n\nLewis Machin, by contrast, is at best a \"shadowy figure\" and knowledge of his career is almost entirely based on the plays we are relatively certain he was at least partly responsible for writing: The Insatiable Countess and Every woman in her Humour. These, alongside The Dumb Knight were performed by an acting company associated with Machin known as the 'Children of the King's Revels', a \"controversial theatrical company\" with a penchant for performing a \"generally bawdy repertoire\" of plays at the Whitefriars theatre, which \"had a rather shadowy existence before 1613\" .\n\nThe Main and Sub-plots\n\nGiven their history of literary productions, the task of distinguishing the work of the two authors becomes quite simple: \"The serious main plot, written in smooth blank verse that is sometimes illuminated with beautiful passages\" is almost certainly the work of Gervase Markham, whilst: \"the comic sub-plot, written for the most part in prose, full of coarse humour and abounding in the most indelicate allusions\" is probably the work of Lewis Machin.\n\nThe main plot is concerned not with wit and base comedy, but with exploring issues of \"Love and honour, of the limits of oaths, and of the relationship between gender and power, wrapped up in a pleasingly violent storyline\" . This contrasts starkly with the sub-plot, and lends support to the almost certainly correct theory that the main plot was a play in its own right, before Machin was allowed to modify it for the early modern stage.\n\nThe many classical allusions from the characters of the main plot solidify Markham's individual claim to it, as \"Gervase's elder brother Francis was educated at Winchester and Cambridge, and it is probable that something similar was true of Gervase\" . Indeed Poynter goes on to doubt \"whether it was a play [intended] to appeal to a Jacobean audience\" at all, a theory the above certainly supports.\n\nHowever dating when exactly the main plot was written has proven difficult: Lines such as \"Heaven, in thy palm, this day the balance hinges!\" can do little more than date it as pre-1606, the date when the 'Act to restrain the Abuses of Players' came into force. That said:\n\nWe are on firmer ground in saying that The Dumb Knight was being performed, at some point after 1601, in Nuremberg by a group of touring English actors, the Englische Kömedianten. There, Jakob Ayrer, a notary and amateur playwright, adapted it into a German version, which survives. Ayrer died in 1605, so the adaptation was completed before then.\n\nBoth these deductions, it is worth pointing out, lend a little credence to the theory that \"Heywood took the idea from Markham\" for the extremely similar card-scene in A Woman Killed with Kindness and not \"Markham from Heywood\" . Although this is far from conclusive evidence as neither of these factors do not manage to date the main plots creation precisely.\n\nWhilst the main plot is influenced by the classics, and notably the \"Bandello novels, which provided plots for so many English writers of the time\" , the sub-plot, as Adams Jr. elaborates in his essay \"Every Woman in her Humor\" and \"The Dumb Knight\" clearly borrows heavily from Every Woman in her Humour: The two characters, \"Lollia and Coloquintida, are identical with the Hostess and Citty Wife\" from Every Woman in her Humour. The first comic sub-plot scene beginning with Lollia's speech \"Now fie upon't, who would be an orators wife and not a gentlewoman\" for example, is copied almost verbatim from Every woman in her Humour, and as The Dumb Knight is very likely the later of the two plays to reach Machin, it becomes highly improbable that Machin is copying these from another playwright. Indeed, Machin's signed address to the reader is evidence against this theory, even though Every Woman in her Humour is technically an anonymous play; the sheer improbability that Machin would write and sign a preface to a play where he had \"been guilty of an extensive and impudent plagiarism of another playwright\" and then send it that play to print makes it near certain the plays share an author in Machin.\n\nIssues and inconstancies of the play\n\nHere I shall be brief, as the play has a veritable myriad of inconsistencies: Initially, the play is described as a \"historical comedy\" on the title-page, however:\n\nEvidently, Markham\n\nwas not pleased by the printing of The Dumb Knight without his name on, since a new title-page attributing the play solely to \"Gervase Markham\" was hastily printed and inserted into the unsold copies.\n\nAnd on this new title-page a new description is inserted, describing the play as a \"pleasant comedy\". In this disparity of description we have in microcosm the central problem that haunts The Dumb Knight : Markham's hand in this correction from \"historical\" (it's only claim for being historical is it's occasional borrowing from one of Shakespeare's history plays) to \"pleasant\" is by no means certain, however it still show's Markham clearly was not in collaboration with Machin at all during the plays revisions, as describing the base-comedy and frequently obscene puns of the sub-plot \"pleasant\" is possibly the cleanest source of humour to be found in the play.\n\nThe failure of both descriptions to accurately summarise the play's content highlights both the scope of the play, and the lack of understanding between the authors (mainly, it has to be said, on the part of Machin). The inconsistency therefore provides an explanation for the play's lack of coherent message: The main plot's \"pleasant\" moral message of chastity and honesty rewarded is subverted by a separate author adding a subplot that celebrates flamboyant dress, and rejoices in the cuckoldry and deception of the unpopular. The most noticeable issue however, as Poynter explains, is the \"fact that the main plot occupies a time span of several weeks, while the sub-plot cannot last more than thirty-six hours\" . The two plots are at best described as \"inartistically joined\" and at worst as blindly forced upon each other by Machin.\n\nThe play's contemporary reception and popularity\n\nThere are two main sources available to give insight into the plays reception: The first being Machin's signed address to the reader, which refers to \"sharp critical censures\", which if nothing else \"implies that its production was sufficiently successful to raise some publicity and some controversy.\"\n\nThe other clue as to the play's popularity is the 1633 folio, which would imply at least a resurgence of interest in the play, if not a continued popularity (although probably not with the same company, as the \"Children of the Kings Revels\" ran into financial difficulties and had to close in 1609), despite the plays length and jarring inconsistency's.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nThe play's frighteningly obvious lack of collaborations between the authors and the play's length may make it difficult for a modern reader to view The Dumb Knight as anything other than two plays who just so happen to share a title and a few characters. However it cannot be ignored, that despite this, the two plays combined \"clearly touched a raw nerve in early modern culture\" and \"enjoyed success over thirty years or more, and in a range of forms and venues\" .\n\nThe solution as to why this is the case, one suspects, comes from viewing the play the perspective of what it would deliver to a contemporary audience: Everything they could want in a comedy, bar complexity.\n\nWhere Shakespeare is brilliant in creating complex characters and plots to hook an audience, The Dumb Knight goes for the far simpler approach of simply providing everything it's audience could want, and unsubtly cramming it into a single play. The Dumb Knight possesses larger than life characters, fanfare (each act is started with \"music\"), intrigue, poetic verse and suspense in the main plot and simple comic relief in the sub-plot. The key to the plays success appears to be that each scene does it's \"job\" well: The play is constantly providing entertainment and spectacle either via humour, drama, suspense or a fight whilst adhering to a single, simple (if not entirely coherent) plot.\n\nEven if the jigsaw does not fit together to form a complete enough picture for the critic's purposes, the pieces of the puzzle are entertaining and well executed enough to maintain even the modern reader's interest.\n\nTo the understanding reader,\n\nRumour, that hydra-headed monster, with more tongues than eyes, by help of his intelligencer Envy, hath made strange misconstructions on this dumb knight, which then could not answer for himself: But now this publication doth untie his tongue, to answer the objections of all sharp critical censures which heretofore have undeservedly past upon him. And for my part, I protest the wrongs I have received by some, whose worths I will not traduce. With a mild neglect I have laughed at their follies; for I think my self happy, because I have been envied, since the best now in grace have been subject to some slanderous tongues that want worth themselves, and think it great praise to them to detract praise from others that deserve it; yet having a partner in the wrong, whose worth hath been often approved, I count the wrong but half a wrong, because he knows best how to answer for himself: But I now in his absence, make this apology, both for him and me. Thus leaving you and the book together, I ever rest yours,\n\nLewis Machin.\n\nDramatis Personae\n\n·King of Cyprus.\n\n·Philocles, The Dumb Knight, and second in command to the King.\n\n·Alphonso, A wealthy and extravagantly dressed lord.\n\n·Duke of Epire, Brother to Mariana.\n\n·Lord Alphonso, A lord of the Queens.\n\n·Florio, A servant under Epire.\n\n·Caelio, High marshal for the Queen.\n\n·Prate, An orator.\n\n·Precedent, Prates Clerk.\n\n·Mechant\n\n·VeloursClients of Prate the orator.\n\n·Drap\n\n·Queen of Sicily.\n\n·Mariana, Friend of the Queen, and sister to Epire.\n\n·Lollia, Prates wife.\n\n·Coloquintida, Lollias friend.\n\nAttendants, Chip, Doctors, Executioner, Gentleman-Usher, Heralds, Shaving, Watchmen and Jailor.\n\nScene: Sicily.\n\nAct One.\n\nScene One.

Your citys walls,\n\nChidden with my cannons, have set open a path\n\nAnd boldly bids me enter. All your men of war,\n\nFeebled with famine and a weary siege,\n\nTake danger from mine actions.

Trust me, King of Cyprus,\n\nThose coals the Roman Porcia did devour\n\nAre not burnt out, nor have th' Egyptian worms\n\nYet lost their stings ; steel holds his temper still:\n\nAnd these are ransoms from captivity.\n\nBut art thou noble?

The place? The time? The sword?\n\nEpire.\n\nThey are your rights; we claim as challengers.\n\nCyprus.\n\nAnd we would lose that vantage , but since fame\n\nMakes virtue dulat , we embrace our rights :\n\nThe place before these walls, the hour next sun,\n\nThe poleaxe and the hand axe for the fight.\n\nQueen.\n\nIt is enough.\n\nMy hostage is my person and my love.\n\nCyprus.\n\nAnd mine my hope, my faith and royalty.\n\nEpire.\n\nThey are of poise sufficient, and one light\n\nShall at one instant, give us day and night.\n\nExeunt Queen, Mariana, Alphonso [and Epire.]\n\nCyprus.\n\nShe's gone, my Philocles: And as she goes, even so\n\nThe sun forsakes the heavens to kiss the sea;\n\nDay in her beauty leaves us, and methinks,\n\nHer absence doth exile all happiness\n\nTell me my Philocles; nay pray thee tell me true,\n\nEven from that love,\n\nWhich to us both should bend one sympathy,\n\nDischarge an open breast: Dost thou not think,\n\nShe is the mirror of her beauteous sex?\n\nUnparalleled, and uncompanioned?\n\nPhilocles.\n\nEnvy will say she's rare; then truth must vow\n\nShe is beyond compare, sith in her looks,\n\nEach motion hath a speaking majesty,\n\nShe is herself, compared with herself:\n\nFor but herself, she hath no companion.\n\nBut when I think of beauty, wit and grace,\n\nThe elements of active delicacy:\n\nThose all eye pleasing harmonies of sight\n\nWhich do enchant mens fancies, and stir up\n\nThe life blood of dull earth; O then methinks\n\nFair Mariana hath an equal place,\n\nAnd if not outshine, it shows more beautiful.\n\nCyprus.\n\nMore than my queen?\n\nPhilocles.\n\nMore in the gloss of beauty, less in worth\n\nOf wisdom and great thoughts. The one I find\n\nAs made for wonder, th' other for admire.\n\nCyprus.\n\nThine equal praises makes my fancies rich,\n\nAnd I am pleasd with thy comparisons.\n\nThings of like nature live in best consent:\n\nBeauty with subjects, majesty with kings.\n\nThen let those two ideas lively move,\n\nSpirit beyond all spirit, in our breasts;\n\nThat in the end of our great victory,\n\nWe may attain both love and majesty.\n\nPhilocles.\n\nAlthough my first creation and my birth,\n\nMy thoughts, and other tempers of my souls,\n\nTook all their noble beings from the sword,\n\nAnd made me only for the use of wars:\n\nYet in this combat, something methinks appears\n\nGreater than greatest glory; and doth raise\n\nMy mind beyond herself.\n\nSfoot! Methinks Caesars Pharsalia ,\n\nNor Scipios Carthage, nor Emilias acts,\n\nWere worthy chairs of triumph: They oer mens\n\nPoor mangled bodies, and fire wasted climes\n\nMade their triumphant passage, but we two\n\nMust conquer thoughts and love; more than the gods can do!\n\n[Enter Florio]\n\nCyprus.\n\nTrue, and therein\n\nConsists the glorious garland of our praise:\n\nBut we neglect th' affairs of preparation. Florio, be it your charge\n\nTo see th' erection of the squared lists ,\n\nFit ground for either army, and what else\n\nBelongs unto such royal eminence.\n\nFlorio.\n\nHow near will your majestys hand the lists extend\n\nUnto the citys walls?\n\nCyprus.\n\nSo as the dullest eye,\n\nMay see the most heedful passage in the fight.\n\nFlorio.\n\nWhat square or circuit?\n\nCyprus.\n\nThreescore pace each way.\n\nFlorio.\n\nYour majesty shall have your will performed.\n\nPhilocles.\n\nDo, and you do us grace. And now, thou sun!\n\nThat art the eye of heaven, whose pure sight\n\nShall be our guide, and Joves great chronicler;\n\nLook from thy sphere.\n\nNo guilt of pride, of malice, or of blood\n\nPuts on our armour; only pure naked love\n\nTutors our hopes, and doth our actions move!\n\nCyprus.\n\nEnough my Philocles, thine orisons are heard.\n\nCome lets away.\n\nExeunt.\n\n[Scene Two]\n\nEnter Lollia , the wife of Prate the orator.\n\nLollia.\n\nNow fie upon't, who would be an orators wife and not a gentlewoman if she could choose? A Lady is the most sweet lascivious life, conveys and kisses, the tire, O the tire, made castle upon castle, jewel upon jewel, knot upon knot, crowns, garlands, gardens, and what not? The hood, the rebato , the French fall, the loose bodied gown, the pin in the hair; now clawing the pate, then picking the teeth, and every day change; when we poor souls must come and go for every mans pleasure, and what's a lady more than another body? We have legs and hands, and rolling eyes, hanging lips, sleek brows, cherry cheeks and other things as ladies have; but the fashion carries it away.\n\nEnter Mistress Coloquintida .\n\nColoquintida.\n\nWhy how now mistress Prate? I'the old disease still, will it never be better, cannot a woman find one kind man amongst twenty? O, the days that I have seen! When the law of a womans wit could have put her husbands purse to execution.\n\nLollia.\n\nO mistress Coloquintida, mine is even the most unnatural man to his wife.\n\nColoquintida.\n\nFaith, for the most part, all scholars are so, for they take so upon them to know all things, that indeed they know nothing. And besides they are with study and ease grown so unwieldy, that a woman shall neer want a sore stomach that's troubled with them.\n\nLollia.\n\nAnd yet they must have the government of all!\n\nColoquintida.\n\nTrue, and great reason they have for it, but a wise man will put it in a womans hand. What! Shell save what he spends.\n\nLollia.\n\nYou have a pretty ruff, how deep is it?\n\nColoquintida.\n\nNay this is but shallow! Marry I have a ruff is a quarter deep, measured by the yard .\n\nLollia.\n\nIndeed, by the yard?\n\nColoquintida.\n\nBy the standard I assure you! You have a pretty set too, how big is the steele you set with?\n\nLollia.\n\nAs big as a reasonable sufficient. Pity of my life! I have forgot myself! If my husband should rise from his study and miss me, we should have such a coil !\n\nColoquintida.\n\nA coil? Why, what coil? If he were my husband and did but thwart me, I would ring him so many alarms, sound him so many brass trumpets, beat him so many drums to his confusion, and thunder him such a peal of great shot, that I would turn his brain in the pan, and make him mad with an eternal silence.\n\nLollia.\n\nO mistress Coloquintida, but my husbands anger is the worst favourdest without all conscience of any mans in all Sicily. He is even as peevish as a sick monkey, and as waspish as an ill pleased bride the second morning!\n\nColoquintida.\n\nLet your wrath be reciprocal, and pay him at his own weapon. But to the purpose for which I came: The party you wrote of commends him to you in this diamond, he that met the party you know, and said the partys party was a party of a partly pretty understanding.\n\nLollia.\n\nO, the Lord Alphonso?\n\nColoquintida.\n\nThe very same, believe it! He loves you, and swears he so loves you, that if you do not credit him you are worse then an infidel.\n\nLollia.\n\nIndeed mistress Coloquintida, he hath the right garb for apparel, the true touch with the tongue in the kiss, and he dances well but falls heavily: But my husband, woman, my husband! If we could put out his cats eyes, there were something to be said, but they are ever peeping and prying, that they are able to pierce through a millstone. Besides, I may say to you, he is a little jealous too and see where he comes? We shall have a coil now.\n\nEnter Prate the orator.\n\nColoquintida.\n\nBegin you to pout first, for thats a womans prevention.\n\nPrate.\n\nWhat, Lollia I say, where are you? My house looks you, my men lack you, I seek you, and a whole quest of inquiry cannot find you! Fie, fie, fie, fie, idleness is the whip of thrift! A good housewife should ever be occupied.\n\nLollia.\n\nIndeed I have much joy to be occupied in anybodys company.\n\nPrate.\n\nWhy, whats the matter?\n\nLollia.\n\nWhy, orators wives shortly will be known like images on water stairs; ever in one weather-beaten suit, as if none wore hoods but monks and ladies; nor feathers but fore-horses and waiting gentlewomen; nor chains but prisoners and lords officers; nor periwigs but players and hot brains: But the weakest must to the walls still .\n\nPrate.\n\nGo to, you shall have what you will.\n\nLollia.\n\nNay, nay, 'twas my hard fortune to be your wife Time was I might have done otherwise, but it matters not; you esteem me as you do yourself and think all things costly enough that covers shame, and that a pair of silken fore-sleeves to a satin breastplate, is a garment good enough for a capitol: But is master Wrangle, master Tangle, or master Trolbeare of that opinion? In faith sir, no.\n\nTheres never a gallant in our state,\n\nThat goes more rich in gaudy bravery:\n\nAnd yet I hope for quality of speech,\n\nAudacious words or quirks or quiddities ,\n\nYou are not held their much inferior.\n\nFie, fie, I am ashamed to see your baseness.\n\nColoquintida.\n\nIndeed master Prate, she tells you truly; I wonder that you, being a proper man and an orator, will not go brave according to the custom of the country!\n\nPrate.\n\nGo to, neighbour: He that will rise to the top of a high ladder must go up, not leap up. But be patient wench, and thou shalt shortly see me gallant it with the best, and for thyself, my Lollia,\n\nNot Lollia Paulina, nor those blazing stars,\n\nWhich makes the world the apes of Italy:\n\nShall match thyself in sun-bright splendour!\n\nLollia.\n\nNay, verily for myself I care not, tis you that are my pride, if you would go like yourself I were appeased.\n\nPrate.\n\nBelieve it, wench, so I will, but to the purpose for which I came, the end of this great war is now brought to a combat, two to two, the duke of Epire and Alphonso for our Queen, against the King and Prince Philocles: Now wench if thou wilt go see the fight, I will send and provide thee of a good standing.\n\nLollia.\n\nIndeed, for you have never a good one of your own.\n\nPrate.\n\nWhat, Precedent I say?\n\nPrecedent. [From within]\n\nAnon, anon sir.\n\nPrate.\n\nWhy, when I say! The villains belly is like a bottomless pit, ever filling and yet empty! At your leisure, sir!\n\nEnter Precedent , Prates man eating.\n\nPrecedent.\n\nI can make no more haste than my teeth will give me leave.\n\nPrate.\n\nWell sir, get you without the town to the place for the combat, and provide me for my wife some good standing to see the conflict.\n\nPrecedent.\n\nHow master? How must I provide a good standing for you for my mistress? Truly master I think a marrow-bone pie, candi'd erringoes, preserv'd dates, or marmalade of cantharides were much better harbingers; cock sparrows stew'd, doves brains or swans pizzles are very provocative; roasted potatoes or boiled skirrets are your only lofty dishes, methinks these should fit you better than I can do.\n\nPrate.\n\nWhats this? Whats this I say? Provide me a standing for my wife upon a scaffold!\n\nPrecedent.\n\nAnd truly master, I think a private chamber were better!\n\nPrate.\n\nI grant you, if there were a chamber convenient.\n\nPrecedent.\n\nWilling minds will make shift in a simple hole: Close windows, strong locks, hard bed and sure posts are your only ornaments.\n\nPrate.\n\nI think the knave be mad, sirrah!

[Aside]\n\nShe will command you sir to play with her!\n\nEnter Epire.\n\nEpire.\n\nMadam, his majesty is returned to court.\n\nQueen.\n\nNay then, away with revels and with sports,\n\nLie hushd, and still this vainer idleness;\n\nIt now hath lost his spleen. Come lords, away!\n\nMy sun is risen, brings a brighter day.\n\nExeunt all but Cyprus and Epire.\n\nCyprus.\n\nDarkness is thy delight, lascivious Queen,\n\nAnd thou wouldst have thy sun pent up in clouds,\n\nIf I be he. O falseness! Did I for this,\n\nIn single opposition hand to hand,\n\nHazard my royal blood for thee to be\n\nMy greatest shame? The scandal of my blood,\n\nWhilst rumour crowns me king of infamy?\n\nBut I will be reveng'd! Watch gentle lord,\n\nWhen next I see them, they shall taste of death!\n\nSuch power hath baseness over great defame,\n\nThat monarchs cannot cover their own shame.\n\nExit Cyprus.\n\nEpire.\n\nMy plot yet holds a true proportion,\n\nAnd I do see an even way to rule.\n\nA crown, like a bold champion bids me on,\n\nAnd fame shall chronicle mine enterprise:\n\nThe Queen being dead, I must oppose myself\n\nAgainst her tyrant husband, thats my claim!\n\nAnd with strong courage, stand the shock of war.\n\nIf of myself I can withstand the King,\n\nThen all the land will flock unto mine aid. If not,\n\nThe King is Gods anointed, my head fits the block,\n\nAnd thats the worst. Yet, future times will tell:\n\nI sunk not slightly, for a crown I fell!\n\nExit Epire.\n\n[Scene Two]\n\nEnter Mechant, and a guard of watchmen.\n\nMechant.\n\nCome on my masters, you know the tenor of the Kings command,\n\nAnd what in this great business you must do,\n\nWhich is to keep him safe, and not vouchsafe\n\nThat any creature speak or visit him,\n\nTill he be brought to the presence of the King.\n\nYou must not start for bounty, nor for threats.\n\nNo, though he say he is a nobleman,\n\nAs it may be, he may prove mighty born.\n\nYet what for that? You must perform your office\n\nOr else expect to taste sharp punishment.\n\nFirst Watch.\n\nTut, fear not my lord, we that have had Cerberus office so many years under a gate, are not to learn now to play either devils or tyrants. Let us but see him, and then take no care for his safety.\n\nSecond Watch.\n\nNay, he shall be put into safe keeping, for my wife shall take charge of him.\n\nEnter Alphonso in the orators clothes.\n\nMechant.\n\nTis well devisd, see where he comes?\n\nHe may not see my presence. Think upon't,\n\nYour charge is trusty, and of mighty weight!\n\nFarewell.\n\nExit Mechant.\n\nFirst Watch.\n\nFear not! Come my hearts, compass him about, and seize on him all at once, like so many ravens on a dead horse.\n\nAlphonso.\n\nNow an eternal sleep, an apoplex , a swound,\n\nSeize on their senses, who in this disguise\n\nShall view or note my vile deformity.\n\nI was bewitchd with spells to my misfortune,\n\nOr else star-crossd with some hags hellishness\n\nSure, I said my prayers, ris'd on my right side,\n\nWash'd hands and eyes, put on my girdle last\n\nSure, I met no splay-footed baker,\n\nNo hare did cross me, nor no bearded witch,\n\nNor other ominous sign. O then why\n\nShould I be thus damn'd in the devils nets?\n\nIst possible this habit which I wear\n\nShould become any man? Now of my soul,\n\nI loathe to see myself, and willingly\n\nI would even vomit at my countenance.\n\nFirst Watch.\n\nStand sir, we arrest you.\n\nAlphonso.\n\nArrest me? Why I injure no man but myself!\n\nSecond Watch.\n\nYou are the more unkind! He that wrongs himself, will not stick to wrong the whole world also.\n\nFirst W"
