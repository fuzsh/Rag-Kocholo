        "text": "Leading in serious crime including murder, serious violence, drug trafficking, terrorism, fraud, appellate work, human rights, public protest and media. Regulatory work including professional and sports regulation. Public Inquiries and Inquest work including Judicial Review. Also Pre-Charge and Crisis Management.\n\nFerocious cross-examiner. Legal 500\n\nProfessor John Cooper KC is recognised as one of the most effective cross-examiners at the Bar and has been instructed in some of the most high-profile court cases in recent years, including cases requiring searching examinations, of members of the Security Service, Armed Forces and the police service. Professor Cooper is well-known for his ability to effectively and rigorously represent his clients and stand up to the most probing scrutiny at tribunals - his reputation for being fearless is well merited.\n\nA former lawyer at the Magic Circle firm, Clifford Chance, John also is one of the most effective and popular KCs practising at the Old Bailey and has achieved many notable acquittals both there and up and down the country, successfully representing clients in cases ranging from the most serious of allegations to those which are potentially, individually and personally devastating to the accused and their families.\n\nJohn represented the majority of bereaved families at the Manchester Arena inquiry, gaining an intimate and detailed understanding of terrorist-related issues.\n\nAs a former prosecutor (highest category) and senior Attorney General Prosecutor (top A list category), he has gained vital experience enabling him to take every advantage for the benefit of his clients, exploiting that insight to great effect in his exclusive defence practice. He uses this valuable experience to advise and undertake private prosecution work.\n\nInternationally, John Cooper KC was the Chair of the International Steering Committee and Prosecutor at the Iran Tribunal in The Hague. The full judgment can be downloaded here. He also represented the captain of the seized Grace I in Gibraltar as a result of disputes between the British and Iranian Governments. He was called to the NSW Bar, in Australia, in 1989.\n\nHe has been named by The Times as a star of the Criminal Bar and one of the Top 10 influential lawyers in the UK. He is also a visiting Professor of Law at Newcastle University, and a Master of the Bench at Middle Temple.\n\nHe is available to be instructed by Direct Access.\n\nHe has represented clients in many significant Public Inquires and Inquests. As well as the Manchester Arena Inquiry, John’s work includes, the Deepcut Barracks inquests and High Court hearings and the Hercules inquest in relation to the multiple loss of life following enemy action. He acted for bereaved families in the Puma Helicopter inquest and in the Nimrod mid-air explosion cases for nine deceased service people. He represented the Labour Group in submissions to the Grenfell Tower Inquiry. He represented the family of JS in her inquest, following the Australian D.J Royal Family hoax.\n\nThe preferred KC for cases which challenge the Establishment, John represented the occupiers outside St Paul’s Cathedral throughout their High Court hearings and argued successfully on behalf of the Euston Square Tunneler’s in their public protest actions against HS2. He represented the Sheffield Tree Campaigns, in the High Court, whose arguments have been recently vindicated. He also led the judicial review of the Government’s deal with the DUP and represented 43 Labour MPs in written argument during the prorogation of Parliament Supreme Court case.\n\nJohn has been instructed by Gina Millar to advise on the Public Protest Bill.\n\nHe was instructed to judicially review the inquest into the death of Dr David Kelly, the government weapons inspector in Iraq, and advised the Mayor of London in the John Warboys Parole judicial review.\n\nMedia Management\n\nMr Cooper uniquely utilises in-depth knowledge of the media, press and broadcasting to advise clients upon reputation and crisis management, as well as neutralising in advance any legal action and adverse publicity. He has done this to great effect for high-ranking politicians, corporate leaders, A-list celebrities and sports people.\n\nHe has represented and advised high-net-worth clients including the Tetra Pac owner and a leading Bitcoin developer.\n\nMr Cooper was Vice Chair of the Bar Council Public Affairs Committee, a former director of media communications for the Halsbury Law Exchange, Lexis Nexis for a number of years and writes regularly for a series of newspapers including The Times, Observer and the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe is regularly instructed in the most sensitive of cases, often pre-charge proceedings and astutely advises clients as to the most effective strategies to neutralise harmful outcomes.\n\nHe has been described as “One of the most politically astute KC's in the country”.\n\nHe is a former lawyer at Clifford Chance in their Media and Communications department. John wrote a regular column for The Times for ten years and edited the Criminal Bar quarterly for over 17 years. He was Vice Chair of the Bar Conference organising board, completing his wide appreciation of the political, media, broadcasting, and sporting world.\n\nArticles & Publications\n\nBooks\n\nCruelty – An Analysis of Article 3 (Sweet & Maxwell) with a foreword by Lord Hope\n\nJudicial Review (Sweet & Maxwell)\n\nPolice Interviews (Sweet & Maxwell)\n\nEncyclopaedia of Data Protection and Privacy (contributor; Sweet and Maxwell)\n\nThe Link between Animal Abuse and Human Violence (Sussex Academic Press 2009)\n\nInquests (Hart Publishing, 2011) with a foreword from the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge\n\nCases that Changed our Lives (Butterworth’s) 2011\n\nSentencing (Oxford University Press) 2019\n\nPapers and Articles\n\nOver 500 papers and articles appearing in most legal publications, including;\n\nColumnist for the Times and regular writer for the main paper since 1999.\n\nEditor for Criminal Bar Quarterly 2000-2018\n\nConsultant editor for Criminal Law and Justice weekly 2009-2019\n\nRegular columnist for New Law Journal 2017 to date.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nJohn Cooper KC has appeared in many television and radio broadcasts, both as a presenter and contributor.
