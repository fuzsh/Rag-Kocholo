        "text": "1. Why use this guide?\n\nUse this guide for advice on how to find records of criminal trials held at the assize courts in England, from 1559 to 1971, and Wales, from 1831 to 1971. For information on Welsh trials from 1543–1830, consult the National Library of Wales website. Their Crime and Punishment database contains records of criminal trials as well as other information relating to criminals, punishment and crime in Wales.\n\nAssize courts tended to deal with the more serious criminal offences, although this was not always the case. Cases heard by assize courts typically included homicide, theft, rape and assault among other crimes.\n\nUp to 1733 most assize court records are in Latin.\n\n2. What were assize courts?\n\nAssize courts were the foundation, along with the courts of quarter sessions, of the criminal court system in England and Wales up until 1971. Based in the main county towns in England and Wales, cases were only heard at the courts twice yearly, when judges from the higher courts in London visited and presided over cases.\n\nOften known simply as ‘the assizes’, the courts originally dealt predominantly with property disputes, but their remit soon widened to include criminal cases as well as cases passed on from the central Westminster courts. By about the mid-13th century the courts were dealing with cases of:\n\nhomicide\n\ntheft (stolen goods were often under-valued as worth less than 12d to avoid making it a capital offence)\n\nhighway robbery\n\nrape\n\nassault\n\ncoining\n\nforgery\n\nwitchcraft\n\ntrespass\n\nvagrancy\n\nrecusancy\n\ninfanticide\n\nAssize courts also heard civil cases, the records of which are covered in our civil assizes guide.\n\n2.1 The timetable\n\nFor much of their history the assize courts sat twice yearly, for Lent and Summer assizes. Typically, Lent assizes, also referred to as Spring assizes, were heard in March/April and Summer assizes in July/August, although there could be variations. By the 19th century and into the 20th century the courts sat more regularly, with Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter assizes.\n\n2.2 Judges’ circuits\n\nEngland and Wales were divided into judicial circuits, each circuit making up the areas covered by the visiting judges. Up until 1876 there were six circuits. They were:\n\nHome, Norfolk and South-Eastern circuits\n\nMidland circuit\n\nNorthern and North-Eastern circuits\n\nOxford circuit\n\nWelsh circuits including Chester\n\nWestern circuit\n\n3. Record types and the information they contain\n\nNot all assize records have survived as the assize clerks sometimes destroyed them when they ran out of space. Earlier records are less likely to have been kept than later ones.\n\nIn terms of information about people, assize records, most commonly, give details of the accused. Typically this includes the name, occupation and place of abode of the accused, but some or all of this information can be unreliable as aliases were often used and other false details were given. The place of abode mentioned is often where the crime took place rather than where the accused lived.\n\n3.1 Crown and gaol books (aka minute books or agenda books)\n\nThe best place to begin a search in the assize records is in the Crown and gaol books, also known as minute books or agenda books. These usually list:\n\nnames of the accused\n\ncharges against the accused\n\nplea\n\nverdict\n\nsentence\n\nThere may be a separate series of minute books for offences such as the failure of local communities to keep local roads and bridges in a good state of repair. These kinds of ‘public office’ offences were considered criminal offences.\n\n3.2 Indictments\n\nThese are the formal statements of the charge against the accused, usually annotated with plea, verdict and sentence.\n\nIndictments were filed in large unwieldy bundles together with other related records, depending on the period and the circuit. Bundled in with indictment records you may also find details of jury panels, coroners’ inquisitions, examinations and depositions, gaol calendars, trial minutes, commissions, presentments of non-criminal offences and recognizances (which give names, parishes of residence and occupation and are usually far more accurate than those given on the indictments themselves).\n\nEach indictment usually gives:\n\nname of the defendant together with any aliases\n\nhis or her occupation\n\na parish of residence\n\nthe date of the alleged offence (by regnal year)\n\ndetails of the alleged offence, together with the name of the victim\n\na list of prosecution witnesses\n\nThe details of the defendant should be treated with caution, especially before the late 19th century. The defendant’s occupation was normally given as ‘labourer’ and the parish of residence is invariably the parish in which the alleged offence took place. The alleged offence is defined by lengthy and formal phrases and some, especially in cases of serious misdemeanour, such as perjury or libel, are several membranes long.\n\nUntil 1916, assize indictments were either handwritten or partly printed and partly written on parchment. After 1916 all indictments were prepared using standard, usually pre-printed, forms. These give the jurisdiction and venue, the name of the defendant, the plea, a summary statement of the charge or charges and particulars of the charges.\n\n3.3 Depositions and examinations\n\nDepositions, sometimes known as sessions papers, consist of pre-trial witness statements. However, the survival rate for these records is relatively poor and those that do survive have been heavily weeded. Only depositions in capital cases, usually murder and riot, tend to survive.\n\nDeposition files, especially those from the mid-20th century or later, may also contain items used as trial exhibits, including:\n\nphotographs\n\nmaps\n\nappeal papers\n\n3.4 Transcripts\n\nTranscripts of what was actually said in court do not normally survive with the records held at The National Archives. A collection of contemporary pamphlet accounts of what was said in court during mostly celebrated trials for the period 1660-1908 is available on microfiche in the reading rooms at The National Archives.\n\nThe Old Bailey Online website provides detailed proceedings (although not complete transcripts of what was said) for trials at the London central criminal court.\n\n3.5 Other records\n\nOther assize records can include:\n\npleadings\n\nstatements of claim, defence and counterclaim\n\ndraft minutes of trials\n\ncorrespondence of the assize clerks, mostly administrative\n\ncoroners’ inquisitions\n\njury lists\n\nfinancial business including fees and costs\n\nestreats (records of fines and forfeits)\n\n4. How to search for records\n\nAs most assize court records remain available only in their original paper or parchment form (copies are not available online), to search for them and see them you will need to visit us at our building in Kew. Alternatively, if you can establish the record series and document references within the series, you can use our record copying service to have copies sent to you for a charge. Either way, you will need to follow these steps to locate records:\n\nStep 1: Establish where and when the trial took place\n\nIf you do not know the date or at least the year of a trial and the county in which the trial took place, you may find your search hits a dead end very quickly. Consult our criminal court cases overview guide for advice on using newspapers, criminal registers and calendars to try to establish these facts.\n\nStep 2: Decide which type of record to look for\n\nUsually, the best place to begin a search in the assize records is the crown and gaol books. To decide which kind of record will be most useful for your research see the information on record types in section 3.\n\nStep 3: Identify the record series\n\nAll assize court records at The National Archives are identified by the department code ASSI. You will also need a series number (each circuit has its own set of series) to narrow your search. To find the right record series refer to the keys in the appendices of this guide. For English counties use Appendix 1; for Welsh counties use Appendix 2.\n\nBy searching or browsing the right series you will hopefully find a piece number that covers the records of the trial in question. Once you have the piece number you can view the original records in person at The National Archives in Kew or pay for copies to be sent to you.\n\nAppendix 1: Key to records of criminal cases in the English assizes 1559-1971\n\nClick on the links in the table to search or browse through the respective series in our catalogue. See section 4 for detailed advice on how to search. For advice on whether to browse or search, see our Discovery help pages.\n\nOf the pre-19th century depositions that have survived, most are from northern counties. Of the pre-19th century Midland circuit records, most that survive are from after 1818.\n\nBristol assize records prior to 1832 are held by Bristol Record Office.\n\nIn 1830 the palatinate of Chester (Cheshire) joined the assizes court system. Durham and Lancaster (Lancashire) merged into the assizes system in 1876. Prior to these years you will need to consult the Palatinate of Chester court records, the Palatinate of Durham court records or the Palatinate of Lancaster court records.\n\nCounty Crown & Gaol Books
