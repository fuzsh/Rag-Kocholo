        "text": "1.5.1 Beowulf\n\nPart I:\n\nLo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements\n\nThe folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,\n\nHow princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.\n\nOft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers\n\nFrom many a people their mead-benches tore.\n\nSince first he found him friendless and wretched,\n\nThe earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,\n\nWaxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,\n\nTill all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to\n\nBow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:\n\nAn excellent atheling! After was borne him\n\nA son and heir, young in his dwelling,\n\nWhom God-Father sent to solace the people.\n\nHe had marked the misery malice had caused them,\n\nThat reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile\n\nLong been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,\n\nWielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.\n\nFamed was Beowulf, far spread the glory\n\nOf Scyld’s great son in the lands of the Danemen.\n\nSo the carle that is young, by kindnesses rendered\n\nThe friends of his father, with fees in abundance\n\nMust be able to earn that when age approacheth\n\nEager companions aid him requitingly,\n\nWhen war assaults him serve him as liegemen:\n\nBy praise-worthy actions must honor be got\n\n’Mong all of the races. At the hour that was fated\n\nScyld then departed to the All-Father’s keeping\n\nWarlike to wend him; away then they bare him\n\nTo the flood of the current, his fond-loving comrades,\n\nAs himself he had bidden, while the friend of the Scyldings\n\nWord-sway wielded, and the well-lovèd land-prince\n\nLong did rule them. The ring-stemmèd vessel,\n\nBark of the atheling, lay there at anchor,\n\nIcy in glimmer and eager for sailing;\n\nThe belovèd leader laid they down there,\n\nGiver of rings, on the breast of the vessel,\n\nThe famed by the mainmast. A many of jewels,\n\nOf fretted embossings, from far-lands brought over,\n\nWas placed near at hand then; and heard I not ever\n\nThat a folk ever furnished a float more superbly\n\nWith weapons of warfare, weeds for the battle,\n\nBills and burnies; on his bosom sparkled\n\nMany a jewel that with him must travel\n\nOn the flush of the flood afar on the current.\n\nAnd favors no fewer they furnished him soothly,\n\nExcellent folk-gems, than others had given him\n\nWho when first he was born outward did send him\n\nLone on the main, the merest of infants:\n\nAnd a gold-fashioned standard they stretched under heaven\n\nHigh o’er his head, let the holm-currents bear him,\n\nSeaward consigned him: sad was their spirit,\n\nTheir mood very mournful. Men are not able\n\nSoothly to tell us, they in halls who reside,\n\nHeroes under heaven, to what haven he hied.\n\nPart II\n\nIn the boroughs then Beowulf, bairn of the Scyldings,\n\nBelovèd land-prince, for long-lasting season\n\nWas famed mid the folk (his father departed,\n\nThe prince from his dwelling), till afterward sprang\n\nGreat-minded Healfdene; the Danes in his lifetime\n\nHe graciously governed, grim-mooded, agèd.\n\nFour bairns of his body born in succession\n\nWoke in the world, war-troopers’ leader\n\nHeorogar, Hrothgar, and Halga the good;\n\nHeard I that Elan was Ongentheow’s consort,\n\nThe well-beloved bedmate of the War-Scylfing leader.\n\nThen glory in battle to Hrothgar was given,\n\nWaxing of war-fame, that willingly kinsmen\n\nObeyed his bidding, till the boys grew to manhood,\n\nA numerous band. It burned in his spirit\n\nTo urge his folk to found a great building,\n\nA mead-hall grander than men of the era\n\nEver had heard of, and in it to share\n\nWith young and old all of the blessings\n\nThe Lord had allowed him, save life and retainers.\n\nThen the work I find afar was assigned\n\nTo many races in middle-earth’s regions,\n\nTo adorn the great folk-hall. In due time it happened\n\nEarly ’mong men, that ’twas finished entirely,\n\nThe greatest of hall-buildings; Heorot he named it\n\nWho wide-reaching word-sway wielded ’mong earlmen.\n\nHis promise he brake not, rings he lavished,\n\nTreasure at banquet. Towered the hall up\n\nHigh and horn-crested, huge between antlers:\n\nIt battle-waves bided, the blasting fire-demon;\n\nEre long then from hottest hatred must sword-wrath\n\nArise for a woman’s husband and father.\n\nThen the mighty war-spirit endured for a season,\n\nBore it bitterly, he who bided in darkness,\n\nThat light-hearted laughter loud in the building\n\nGreeted him daily; there was dulcet harp-music,\n\nClear song of the singer. He said that was able\n\nTo tell from of old earthmen’s beginnings,\n\nThat Father Almighty earth had created,\n\nThe winsome wold that the water encircleth,\n\nSet exultingly the sun’s and the moon’s beams\n\nTo lavish their lustre on land-folk and races,\n\nAnd earth He embellished in all her regions\n\nWith limbs and leaves; life He bestowed too\n\nOn all the kindreds that live under heaven.\n\nSo blessed with abundance, brimming with joyance,\n\nThe warriors abided, till a certain one gan to\n\nDog them with deeds of direfullest malice,\n\nA foe in the hall-building: this horrible stranger\n\nWas Grendel entitled, the march-stepper famous\n\nWho dwelt in the moor-fens, the marsh and the fastness; T\n\nhe wan-mooded being abode for a season\n\nIn the land of the giants, when the Lord and Creator\n\nHad banned him and branded. For that bitter murder,\n\nThe killing of Abel, all-ruling Father\n\nThe kindred of Cain crushed with His vengeance;\n\nIn the feud He rejoiced not, but far away drove him\n\nFrom kindred and kind, that crime to atone for,\n\nMeter of Justice. Thence ill-favored creatures,\n\nElves and giants, monsters of ocean,\n\nCame into being, and the giants that longtime\n\nGrappled with God; He gave them requital.\n\nPart III\n\nWhen the sun was sunken, he set out to visit\n\nThe lofty hall-building, how the Ring-Danes had used it\n\nFor beds and benches when the banquet was over.\n\nThen he found there reposing many a noble\n\nAsleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,\n\nMisery knew not. The monster of evil\n\nGreedy and cruel tarried but little,\n\nFell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers\n\nThirty of thanemen; thence he departed\n\nLeaping and laughing, his lair to return to,\n\nWith surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.\n\nIn the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,\n\nWas Grendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors:\n\nThen, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,\n\nMorning-cry mighty. The man-ruler famous,\n\nThe long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,\n\nSuffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,\n\nWhen they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer,\n\nThe spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow,\n\nToo loathsome and lasting. Not longer he tarried,\n\nBut one night after continued his slaughter\n\nShameless and shocking, shrinking but little\n\nFrom malice and murder; they mastered him fully.\n\nHe was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for\n\nA pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,\n\nA bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice\n\nTold him truly by token apparent\n\nThe hall-thane’s hatred: he held himself after\n\nFurther and faster who the foeman did baffle.\n\nSo ruled he and strongly strove against justice\n\nLone against all men, till empty uptowered\n\nThe choicest of houses. Long was the season:\n\nTwelve-winters’ time torture suffered\n\nThe friend of the Scyldings, every affliction,\n\nEndless agony; hence it after became\n\nCertainly known to the children of men\n\nSadly in measures, that long against Hrothgar\n\nGrendel struggled:—his grudges he cherished,\n\nMurderous malice, many a winter,\n\nStrife unremitting, and peacefully wished he\n\nLife-woe to lift from no liegeman at all of\n\nThe men of the Dane-folk, for money to settle,\n\nNo counsellor needed count for a moment\n\nOn handsome amends at the hands of the murderer;\n\nThe monster of evil fiercely did harass,\n\nThe ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,\n\nTrapping and tricking them. He trod every night then\n\nThe mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where\n\nWitches and wizards wander and ramble.\n\nSo the foe of mankind many of evils\n\nGrievous injuries, often accomplished,\n\nHorrible hermit; Heort he frequented,\n\nGem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen\n\n(Since God did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,\n\nThe light-flashing jewel, love of Him knew not).\n\n’Twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the Scyldings\n\nSoul-crushing sorrow. Not seldom in private\n\nSat the king in his council; conference held they\n\nWhat the braves should determine ’gainst terrors unlooked for.\n\nAt the shrines of their idols often they promised\n\nGifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they\n\nThe devil from hell would help them to lighten\n\nTheir people’s oppression. Such practice they used then,\n\nHope of the heathen; hell they remembered\n\nIn innermost spirit, God they knew not,\n\nThe true God they do not know.\n\nJudge of their actions, All-wielding Ruler,\n\nNo praise could they give th Greedy and cruel tarried but little,\n\nFell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers Thirty\n\nof thanemen; thence he departed Leaping and\n\nlaughing, his lair to return to, With surfeit of\n\nslaughter sallying homeward.\n\nIn the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking, Was\n\nGrendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors:\n\nPart IV\n\nSo Healfdene’s kinsman constantly mused on\n\nHis long-lasting sorrow; the battle-thane clever\n\nWas not anywise able evils to ’scape from:\n\nToo crushing the sorrow that came to the people,\n\nLoathsome and lasting the life-grinding torture,\n\nGreatest of night-woes. So Higelac’s liegeman,\n\nGood amid Geatmen, of Grendel’s achievements\n\nHeard in his home: of heroes then living\n\nHe was stoutest and strongest, sturdy and noble.\n\nHe bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty;\n\nHe said he the war-king would seek o’er the ocean,\n\nThe folk-leader noble, since he needed retainers.\n\nFor the perilous project prudent companions\n\nChided him little, though loving him dearly;\n\nThey egged the brave atheling, augured him glory.\n\nThe excellent knight from the folk of the Geatmen\n\nHad liegemen selected, likest to prove them\n\nTrustworthy warriors; with fourteen companions\n\nThe vessel he looked for; a liegeman then showed them,\n\nA sea-crafty man, the bounds of the country.\n\nFast the days fleeted; the float was a-water,\n\nThe craft by the cliff. Clomb to the prow then\n\nWell-equipped warriors: the wave-currents twisted\n\nThe sea on the sand; soldiers then carried\n\nOn the breast of the vessel bright-shining jewels,\n\nHandsome war-armor; heroes outshoved then,\n\nWarmen the wood-ship, on its wished-for adventure.\n\nThe foamy-necked floater fanned by the breeze,\n\nLikest a bird, glided the waters,\n\nTill twenty and four hours thereafter\n\nThe twist-stemmed vessel had traveled such distance\n\nThat the sailing-men saw the sloping embankments,\n\nThe sea cliffs gleaming, precipitous mountains,\n\nNesses enormous: they were nearing the limits\n\nAt the end of the ocean. Up thence quickly\n\nThe men of the Weders clomb to the mainland,\n\nFastened their vessel (battle weeds rattled,\n\nWar burnies clattered), the Wielder they thanked\n\nThat the ways o’er the waters had waxen so gentle.\n\nThen well from the cliff edge the guard of the Scyldings\n\nWho the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o’er the gangway\n\nBrave ones bearing beauteous targets,\n\nArmor all ready, anxiously thought he,\n\nMusing and wondering what men were approaching.\n\nHigh on his horse then Hrothgar’s retainer\n\nTurned him to coastward, mightily brandished\n\nHis lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.\n\n“Who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors\n\nClad in your corslets, come thus a-driving\n\nA high riding ship o’er the shoals of the waters,\n\nAnd hither ’neath helmets have hied o’er the ocean?\n\nI have been strand-guard, standing as warden,\n\nLest enemies ever anywise ravage\n\nDanish dominions with army of war-ships.\n\nMore boldly never have warriors ventured\n\nHither to come; of kinsmen’s approval,\n\nWord-leave of warriors, I ween that ye surely\n\nNothing have known. Never a greater one\n\nOf earls o’er the earth have I had a sight of\n\nThan is one of your number, a hero in armor;\n\nNo low-ranking fellow adorned with his weapons,\n\nBut launching them little, unless looks are deceiving,\n\nAnd striking appearance. Ere ye pass on your journey\n\nAs treacherous spies to the land of the Scyldings\n\nAnd farther fare, I fully must know now\n\nWhat race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,\n\nSea-faring sailors, my simple opinion\n\nHear ye and hearken: haste is most fitting\n\nPlainly to tell me what place ye are come from.”\n\nPart V\n\nThe chief of the strangers rendered him answer,\n\nWar-troopers’ leader, and word-treasure opened:\n\n“We are sprung from the lineage of the people of Geatland,\n\nAnd Higelac’s hearth-friends. To heroes unnumbered\n\nMy father was known, a noble head-warrior\n\nEcgtheow titled; many a winter\n\nHe lived with the people, ere he passed on his journey,\n\nOld from his dwelling; each of the counsellors\n\nWidely mid world-folk well remembers him.\n\nWe, kindly of spirit, the lord of thy people,\n\nThe son of King Healfdene, have come here to visit,\n\nFolk-troop’s defender: be free in thy counsels!\n\nTo the noble one bear we a weighty commission,\n\nThe helm of the Danemen; we shall hide, I ween,\n\nNaught of our message. Thou know’st if it happen,\n\nAs we soothly heard say, that some savage despoiler,\n\nSome hidden pursuer, on nights that are murky\n\nBy deeds very direful ’mid the Danemen exhibits\n\nHatred unheard of, horrid destruction\n\nAnd the falling of dead. From feelings least selfish\n\nI am able to render counsel to Hrothgar,\n\nHow he, wise and worthy, may worst the destroyer,\n\nIf the anguish of sorrow should ever be lessened,\n\nComfort come to him, and care-waves grow cooler,\n\nOr ever hereafter he agony suffer\n\nAnd troublous distress, while towereth upward\n\nThe handsomest of houses high on the summit.”\n\nBestriding his stallion, the strand-watchman answered,\n\nThe doughty retainer: “The difference surely\n\n’Twixt words and works, the warlike shield-bearer\n\nWho judgeth wisely well shall determine.\n\nThis band, I hear, beareth no malice\n\nTo the prince of the Scyldings. Pass ye then onward\n\nWith weapons and armor. I shall lead you in person;\n\nTo my war-trusty vassals command I shall issue\n\nTo keep from all injury your excellent vessel,\n\nYour fresh-tarred craft, ’gainst every opposer\n\nClose by the sea-shore, till the curved-neckèd bark shall\n\nWaft back again the well-beloved hero\n\nO’er the way of the water to Weder dominions.\n\nTo warrior so great ’twill be granted sure\n\nIn the storm of strife to stand secure.”\n\nOnward they fared then (the vessel lay quiet,\n\nThe broad-bosomed bark was bound by its cable,\n\nFirmly at anchor); the boar-signs glistened\n\nBright on the visors vivid with gilding,\n\nBlaze-hardened, brilliant; the boar acted warden.\n\nThe heroes hastened, hurried the liegemen,\n\nDescended together, till they saw the great palace,\n\nThe well-fashioned wassail-hall wondrous and gleaming:\n\n’Mid world-folk and kindreds that was widest reputed\n\nOf halls under heaven which the hero abode in;\n\nIts lustre enlightened lands without number.\n\nThen the battle-brave hero showed them the glittering\n\nCourt of the bold ones, that they easily thither\n\nMight fare on their journey; the aforementioned warrior\n\nTurning his courser, quoth as he left them:\n\n“’Tis time I were faring; Father Almighty\n\nGrant you His grace, and give you to journey\n\nSafe on your mission! To the sea I will get me\n\n’Gainst hostile warriors as warden to stand.”\n\nPart VI\n\nThe highway glistened with many-hued pebble,\n\nA by-path led the liegemen together.\n\nFirm and hand-locked the war-burnie glistened,\n\nThe ring-sword radiant rang ’mid the armor\n\nAs the party was approaching the palace together\n\nIn warlike equipments. ’Gainst the wall of the building\n\nTheir wide-fashioned war-shields they weary did set then,\n\nBattle-shields sturdy; benchward they turned then;\n\nTheir battle-sarks rattled, the gear of the heroes;\n\nThe lances stood up then, all in a cluster,\n\nThe arms of the seamen, ashen-shafts mounted\n\nWith edges of iron: the armor-clad troopers\n\nWere decked with weapons. Then a proud-mooded hero\n\nAsked of the champions questions of lineage:\n\n“From what borders bear ye your battle-shields plated,\n\nGilded and gleaming, your gray-colored burnies,\n\nHelmets with visors and heap of war-lances?—\n\nTo Hrothgar the king I am servant and liegeman.\n\n’Mong folk from far-lands found I have never\n\nMen so many of mien more courageous.\n\nI ween that from valor, nowise as outlaws,\n\nBut from greatness of soul ye sought for King Hrothgar.”\n\nThen the strength-famous earlman answer rendered,\n\nThe proud-mooded Wederchief replied to his question,\n\nHardy ’neath helmet: “Higelac’s mates are we;\n\nBeowulf hight I. To the bairn of Healfdene,\n\nThe famous folk-leader, I freely will tell\n\nTo thy prince my commission, if pleasantly hearing\n\nHe’ll grant we may greet him so gracious to all men.”\n\nWulfgar replied then (he was prince of the Wendels,\n\nHis boldness of spirit was known unto many,\n\nHis prowess and prudence): “The prince of the Scyldings,\n\nThe friend-lord of Danemen, I will ask of thy journey,\n\nThe giver of rings, as thou urgest me do it,\n\nThe folk-chief famous, and inform thee early\n\nWhat answer the good one mindeth to render me.”\n\nHe turned then hurriedly where Hrothgar was sitting,\n\nOld and hoary, his earlmen attending him;\n\nThe strength-famous went till he stood at the shoulder\n\nOf the lord of the Danemen, of courteous thanemen\n\nThe custom he minded. Wulfgar addressed then\n\nHis friendly liegelord: “Folk of the Geatmen\n\nO’er the way of the waters are wafted hither,\n\nFaring from far-lands: the foremost in rank\n\nThe battle-champions Beowulf title.\n\nThey make this petition: with thee, O my chieftain,\n\nTo be granted a conference; O gracious King Hrothgar,\n\nFriendly answer refuse not to give them!\n\nIn war-trappings weeded worthy they seem\n\nOf earls to be honored; sure the atheling is doughty\n\nWho headed the heroes hitherward coming.”\n\nPart VII\n\nHrothgar answered, helm of the Scyldings:\n\n“I remember this man as the merest of striplings.\n\nHis father long dead now was Ecgtheow titled,\n\nHim Hrethel the Geatman granted at home his\n\nOne only daughter; his battle-brave son\n\nIs come but now, sought a trustworthy friend.\n\nSeafaring sailors asserted it then,\n\nWho valuable gift-gems of the Geatmen carried\n\nAs peace-offering thither, that he thirty men’s grapple\n\nHas in his hand, the hero-in-battle.\n\nThe holy Creator usward sent him,\n\nTo West-Dane warriors, I ween, for to render\n\n’Gainst Grendel’s grimness gracious assistance:\n\nI shall give to the good one gift-gems for courage.\n\nHasten to bid them hither to speed them,\n\nTo see assembled this circle of kinsmen;\n\nTell them expressly they’re welcome in sooth to\n\nThe men of the Danes.” To the door of the building\n\nWulfgar went then, this word-message shouted:\n\n“My victorious liegelord bade me to tell you,\n\nThe East-Danes’ atheling, that your origin knows he,\n\nAnd o’er wave-billows wafted ye welcome are hither,\n\nValiant of spirit. Ye straightway may enter\n\nClad in corslets, cased in your helmets,\n\nTo see King Hrothgar. Here let your battle-boards,\n\nWood-spears and war-shafts, await your conferring.”\n\nThe mighty one rose then, with many a liegeman,\n\nAn excellent thane-group; some there did await them,\n\nAnd as bid of the brave one the battle-gear guarded.\n\nTogether they hied them, while the hero did guide them,\n\n’Neath Heorot’s roof; the high-minded went then\n\nSturdy ’neath helmet till he stood in the building.\n\nBeowulf spake (his burnie did glisten,\n\nHis armor seamed over by the art of the craftsman):\n\n“Hail thou, Hrothgar! I am Higelac’s kinsman\n\nAnd vassal forsooth; many a wonder\n\nI dared as a stripling. The doings of Grendel,\n\nIn far-off fatherland I fully did know of:\n\nSea-farers tell us, this hall-building standeth,\n\nExcellent edifice, empty and useless\n\nTo all the earlmen after evenlight’s glimmer\n\n’Neath heaven’s bright hues hath hidden its glory.\n\nThis my earls then urged me, the most excellent of them,\n\nCarles very clever, to come and assist thee,\n\nFolk-leader Hrothgar; fully they knew of\n\nThe strength of my body. Themselves they beheld me\n\nWhen I came from the contest, when covered with gore\n\nFoes I escaped from, where five I had bound,\n\nThe giant-race wasted, in the waters destroying\n\nThe nickers by night, bore numberless sorrows,\n\nThe Weders avenged (woes had they suffered)\n\nEnemies ravaged; alone now with Grendel\n\nI shall manage the matter, with the monster of evil,\n\nThe giant, decide it. Thee I would therefore\n\nBeg of thy bounty, Bright-Danish chieftain,\n\nLord of the Scyldings, this single petition:\n\nNot to refuse me, defender of warriors,\n\nFriend-lord of folks, so far have I sought thee,\n\nThat I may unaided, my earlmen assisting me,\n\nThis brave-mooded war-band, purify Heorot.\n\nI have heard on inquiry, the horrible creature\n\nFrom veriest rashness recks not for weapons;\n\nI this do scorn then, so be Higelac gracious,\n\nMy liegelord belovèd, lenient of spirit,\n\nTo bear a blade or a broad-fashioned target,\n\nA shield to the onset; only with hand-grip\n\nThe foe I must grapple, fight for my life then,\n\nFoeman with foeman; he fain must rely on\n\nThe doom of the Lord whom death layeth hold of.\n\nI ween he will wish, if he win in the struggle,\n\nTo eat in the war-hall earls of the Geat-folk,\n\nBoldly to swallow them, as of yore he did often\n\nThe best of the Hrethmen! Thou needest not trouble\n\nA head-watch to give me; he will have me dripping\n\nAnd dreary with gore, if death overtake me,\n\nWill bear me off bleeding, biting and mouthing me,\n\nThe hermit will eat me, heedless of pity,\n\nMarking the moor-fens; no more wilt thou need then\n\nShould I fall, send my armor to my lord, King Higelac.\n\nFind me my food. If I fall in the battle,\n\nSend to Higelac the armor that serveth\n\nTo shield my bosom, the best of equipments,\n\nRichest of ring-mails; ’tis the relic of Hrethla,\n\nThe work of Wayland. Goes Weird as she must go!”\n\nPart VIII\n\nHrothgar discoursed, helm of the Scyldings:\n\n“To defend our folk and to furnish assistance,\n\nThou soughtest us hither, good friend Beowulf.\n\nThe fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in,\n\nHeatholaf killed he in hand-to-hand conflict\n\n’Mid Wilfingish warriors; then the Wederish people\n\nFor fear of a feud were forced to disown him.\n\nThence flying he fled to the folk of the South-Danes,\n\nThe race of the Scyldings, o’er the roll of the waters;\n\nI had lately begun then to govern the Danemen,\n\nThe hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,\n\nRich in its jewels: dead was Heregar,\n\nMy kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken,\n\nHealfdene his bairn. He was better than I am!\n\nThat feud thereafter for a fee I compounded;\n\nO’er the weltering waters to the Wilfings I sent\n\nOrnaments old; oaths did he swear me.\n\nIt pains me in spirit to any to tell it,\n\nWhat grief in Heorot Grendel hath caused me,\n\nWhat horror unlooked-for, by hatred unceasing.\n\nWaned is my war-band, wasted my hall-troop;\n\nWeird hath offcast them to the clutches of Grendel.\n\nGod can easily hinder the scather\n\nFrom deeds so direful. Oft drunken with beer\n\nO’er the ale-vessel promised warriors in armor\n\nThey would willingly wait on the wassailing-benches\n\nA grapple with Grendel, with grimmest of edges.\n\nThen this mead-hall at morning with murder was reeking,\n\nThe building was bloody at breaking of daylight,\n\nThe bench-deals all flooded, dripping and bloodied,\n\nThe folk-hall was gory: I had fewer retainers,\n\nDear-beloved warriors, whom death had laid hold of.\n\nSit at the feast now, thy intents unto heroes,\n\nThy victor-fame show, as thy spirit doth urge thee!”\n\nFor the men of the Geats then together assembled,\n\nIn the beer-hall blithesome a bench was made ready;\n\nThere warlike in spirit they went to be seated,\n\nProud and exultant. A liegeman did service,\n\nWho a beaker embellished bore with decorum,\n\nAnd gleaming-drink poured. The gleeman sang whilom\n\nHearty in Heorot; there was heroes’ rejoicing,\n\nA numerous war-band of Weders and Danemen.\n\nPart IX\n\nUnferth spoke up, Ecglaf his son,\n\nWho sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,\n\nOpened the jousting (the journey of Beowulf,\n\nSea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth\n\nAnd greatest chagrin, too, for granted he never\n\nThat any man else on earth should attain to,\n\nGain under heaven, more glory than he):\n\n“Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,\n\nOn the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,\n\nWhere to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,\n\nFrom vainest vaunting adventured your bodies\n\nIn care of the waters? And no one was able\n\nNor lief nor loth one, in the least to dissuade you\n\nYour difficult voyage; then ye ventured a-swimming,\n\nWhere your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover,\n\nThe mere-ways measured, mixing and stirring them,\n\nGlided the ocean; angry the waves were,\n\nWith the weltering of winter. In the water’s possession,\n\nYe toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,\n\nIn strength excelled thee. Then early at morning\n\nOn the Heathoremes’ shore the holm-currents tossed him,\n\nSought he thenceward the home of his fathers,\n\nBeloved of his liegemen, the land of the Brondings,\n\nThe peace-castle pleasant, where a people he wielded,\n\nHad borough and jewels. The pledge that he made thee\n\nThe son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.\n\nThen I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,\n\nThough ever triumphant in onset of battle,\n\nA grim grappling, if Grendel thou darest\n\nFor the space of a night near-by to wait for!”\n\nBeowulf answered, offspring of Ecgtheow:\n\n“My good friend Unferth, sure freely and wildly,\n\nThou fuddled with beer of Breca hast spoken,\n\nHast told of his journey! A fact I allege it,\n\nThat greater strength in the waters I had then,\n\nIlls in the ocean, than any man else had.\n\nWe made agreement as the merest of striplings\n\nPromised each other (both of us then were\n\nYounkers in years) that we yet would adventure\n\nOut on the ocean; it all we accomplished.\n\nWhile swimming the sea-floods, sword-blade unscabbarded\n\nBoldly we brandished, our bodies expected\n\nTo shield from the sharks. He sure was unable\n\nTo swim on the waters further than I could,\n\nMore swift on the waves, nor would I from him go.\n\nThen we two companions stayed in the ocean\n\nFive nights together, till the currents did part us,\n\nThe weltering waters, weathers the bleakest,\n\nAnd nethermost night, and the north-wind whistled\n\nFierce in our faces; fell were the billows.\n\nThe mere fishes’ mood was mightily ruffled:\n\nAnd there against foemen my firm-knotted corslet,\n\nHand-jointed, hardy, help did afford me;\n\nMy battle-sark braided, brilliantly gilded,\n\nLay on my bosom. To the bottom then dragged me,\n\nA hateful fiend-scather, seized me and held me,\n\nGrim in his grapple: ’twas granted me, nathless,\n\nTo pierce the monster with the point of my weapon,\n\nMy obedient blade; battle offcarried\n\nThe mighty mere-creature by means of my hand-blow.\n\nPart X\n\n“So ill-meaning enemies often did cause me\n\nSorrow the sorest. I served them, in quittance,\n\nWith my dear-lovèd sword, as in sooth it was fitting;\n\nThey missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly,\n\nIll-doers evil, of eating my body,\n\nOf surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean;\n\nBut wounded with edges early at morning\n\nThey were stretched a-high on the strand of the ocean,\n\nPut to sleep with the sword, that sea-going travelers\n\nNo longer thereafter were hindered from sailing\n\nThe foam-dashing currents. Came a light from the east,\n\nGod’s beautiful beacon; the billows subsided,\n\nThat well I could see the nesses projecting,\n\nThe blustering crags. Weird often saveth\n\nThe undoomed hero if doughty his valor!\n\nBut me did it fortune to fell with my weapon\n\nNine of the nickers. Of night-struggle harder\n\n’Neath dome of the heaven heard I but rarely,\n\nNor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean;\n\nYet I ’scaped with my life the grip of the monsters,\n\nWeary from travel. Then the waters bare me\n\nTo the land of the Finns, the flood with the current,\n\nThe weltering waves. Not a word hath been told me\n\nOf deeds so daring done by thee, Unferth,\n\nAnd of sword-terror none; never hath Breca\n\nAt the play of the battle, nor either of you two,\n\nFeat so fearless performèd with weapons\n\nGlinting and gleaming . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . I utter no boasting;\n\nThough with cold-blooded cruelty thou killedst thy brothers,\n\nThy nearest of kin; thou needs must in hell get\n\nDireful damnation, though doughty thy wisdom.\n\nI tell thee in earnest, offspring of Ecglaf,\n\nNever had Grendel such numberless horrors,\n\nThe direful demon, done to thy liegelord,\n\nHarrying in Heorot, if thy heart were as sturdy,\n\nThy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them.\n\nHe hath found out fully that the fierce-burning hatred,\n\nThe edge-battle eager, of all of your kindred,\n\nOf the Victory-Scyldings, need little dismay him:\n\nOaths he exacteth, not any he spares\n\nOf the folk of the Danemen, but fighteth with pleasure,\n\nKilleth and feasteth, no contest expecteth\n\nFrom Spear-Danish people. But the prowess and valor\n\nOf the earls of the Geatmen early shall venture\n\nTo give him a grapple. He shall go who is able\n\nBravely to banquet, when the bright-light of morning\n\nWhich the second day bringeth, the sun in its ether-robes,\n\nO’er children of men shines from the southward!”\n\nThen the gray-haired, war-famed giver of treasure\n\nWas blithesome and joyous, the Bright-Danish ruler\n\nExpected assistance; the people’s protector\n\nHeard from Beowulf his bold resolution.\n\nThere was laughter of heroes; loud was the clatter,\n\nThe words were winsome. Wealhtheow advanced then,\n\nConsort of Hrothgar, of courtesy mindful,\n\nGold-decked saluted the men in the building,\n\nAnd the freeborn woman the beaker presented\n\nTo the lord of the kingdom, first of the East-Danes,\n\nBade him be blithesome when beer was a-flowing,\n\nLief to his liegemen; he lustily tasted\n\nOf banquet and beaker, battle-famed ruler.\n\nThe Helmingish lady then graciously circled\n\n’Mid all the liegemen lesser and greater:\n\nTreasure-cups tendered, till time was afforded\n\nThat the decorous-mooded, diademed folk-queen\n\nMight bear to Beowulf the bumper o’errunning;\n\nShe greeted the Geat-prince, God she did thank,\n\nMost wise in her words, that her wish was accomplished\n\nThat in any of earlmen she ever should look for\n\nSolace in sorrow. He accepted the beaker,\n\nBattle-bold warrior, at Wealhtheow’s giving,\n\nThen equipped for combat quoth he in measures,\n\nBeowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:\n\n“I purposed in spirit when I mounted the ocean,\n\nWhen I boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen,\n\nI would work to the fullest the will of your people\n\nOr in foe’s-clutches fastened fall in the battle.\n\nDeeds I shall do of daring and prowess,\n\nOr the last of my life-days live in this mead-hall.”\n\nThese words to the lady were welcome and pleasing,\n\nThe boast of the Geatman; with gold trappings broidered\n\nWent the freeborn folk-queen her fond-lord to sit by.\n\nThen again as of yore was heard in the building\n\nCourtly discussion, conquerors’ shouting,\n\nHeroes were happy, till Healfdene’s son would\n\nGo to his slumber to seek for refreshing;\n\nFor the horrid hell-monster in the hall-building knew he\n\nA fight was determined, since the light of the sun they\n\nNo longer could see, and lowering darkness\n\nO’er all had descended, and dark under heaven\n\nShadowy shapes came shying around them.\n\nThe liegemen all rose then. One saluted the other,\n\nHrothgar Beowulf, in rhythmical measures,\n\nWishing him well, and, the wassail-hall giving\n\nTo his care and keeping, quoth he departing:\n\n“Not to any one else have I ever entrusted,\n\nBut thee and thee only, the hall of the Danemen,\n\nSince high I could heave my hand and my buckler.\n\nTake thou in charge now the noblest of houses;\n\nBe mindful of honor, exhibiting prowess,\n\nWatch ’gainst the foeman! Thou shalt want no enjoyments,\n\nSurvive thou safely adventure so glorious!”\n\nPart XI\n\nThen Hrothgar departed, his earl-throng attending him,\n\nFolk-lord of Scyldings, forth from the building;\n\nThe war-chieftain wished then Wealhtheow to look for,\n\nThe queen for a bedmate. To keep away Grendel\n\nThe Glory of Kings had given a hall-watch,\n\nAs men heard recounted: for the king of the Danemen\n\nHe did special service, gave the giant a watcher:\n\nAnd the prince of the Geatmen implicitly trusted\n\nHis warlike strength and the Wielder’s protection.\n\nHis armor of iron off him he did then,\n\nHis helmet from his head, to his henchman committed\n\nHis chased-handled chain-sword, choicest of weapons,\n\nAnd bade him bide with his battle-equipments.\n\nThe good one then uttered words of defiance,\n\nBeowulf Geatman, ere his bed he upmounted:\n\n“I hold me no meaner in matters of prowess,\n\nIn warlike achievements, than Grendel does himself;\n\nHence I seek not with sword-edge to sooth him to slumber,\n\nOf life to bereave him, though well I am able.\n\nNo battle-skill has he, that blows he should strike me,\n\nTo shatter my shield, though sure he is mighty\n\nIn strife and destruction; but struggling by night we\n\nShall do without edges, dare he to look for\n\nWeaponless warfare, and wise-mooded Father\n\nThe glory apportion, God ever-holy,\n\nOn which hand soever to him seemeth proper.”\n\nThen the brave-mooded hero bent to his slumber,\n\nThe pillow received the cheek of the noble;\n\nAnd many a martial mere-thane attending\n\nSank to his slumber. Seemed it unlikely\n\nThat ever thereafter any should hope to\n\nBe happy at home, hero-friends visit\n\nOr the lordly troop-castle where he lived from his childhood;\n\nThey had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine-hall\n\nHad recently ravished, of the race of the Scyldings\n\nToo many by far. But the Lord to them granted\n\nThe weaving of war-speed, to Wederish heroes\n\nAid and comfort, that every opponent\n\nBy one man’s war-might they worsted and vanquished,\n\nBy the might of himself; the truth is established\n\nThat God Almighty hath governed for ages\n\nKindreds and nations. A night very lurid\n\nThe trav’ler-at-twilight came tramping and striding.\n\nThe warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned-building,\n\nOne only excepted. ’Mid earthmen ’twas ’stablished,\n\nTh’ implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them\n\nTo the land of shadows, if the Lord were unwilling;\n\nBut serving as warder, in terror to foemen,\n\nHe angrily bided the issue of battle.\n\nPart XII\n\n’Neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then\n\nGrendel going, God’s anger bare he.\n\nThe monster intended some one of earthmen\n\nIn the hall-building grand to entrap and make way with:\n\nHe went under welkin where well he knew of\n\nThe wine-joyous building, brilliant with plating,\n\nGold-hall of earthmen. Not the earliest occasion\n\nHe the home and manor of Hrothgar had sought:\n\nNe’er found he in life-days later nor earlier\n\nHardier hero, hall-thanes more sturdy!\n\nThen came to the building the warrior marching,\n\nBereft of his joyance. The door quickly opened\n\nOn fire-hinges fastened, when his fingers had touched it;\n\nThe fell one had flung then—his fury so bitter—\n\nOpen the entrance. Early thereafter\n\nThe foeman trod the shining hall-pavement,\n\nStrode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered\n\nA lustre unlovely likest to fire.\n\nHe beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,\n\nA circle of kinsmen sleeping together,\n\nA throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant, He minded to sunder from each of the thanemen\n\nThe life from his body, horrible demon,\n\nEre morning came, since fate had allowed him\n\nThe prospect of plenty. Providence willed not\n\nTo permit him any more of men under heaven\n\nTo eat in the night-time. Higelac’s kinsman\n\nGreat sorrow endured how the dire-mooded creature\n\nIn unlooked-for assaults were likely to bear him.\n\nNo thought had the monster of deferring the matter,\n\nBut on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of\n\nA soldier asleep, suddenly tore him,\n\nBit his bone-prison, the blood drank in currents,\n\nSwallowed in mouthfuls: he soon had the dead man’s\n\nFeet and hands, too, eaten entirely.\n\nNearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warrior\n\nSnatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,\n\nForward the foeman foined with his hand;\n\nCaught he quickly the cunning deviser,\n\nOn his elbow he rested. This early discovered\n\nThe master of malice, that in middle-earth’s regions,\n\n’Neath the whole of the heavens, no hand-grapple greater\n\nIn any man else had he ever encountered:\n\nFearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,\n\nNot off could betake him; death he was pondering,\n\nWould fly to his covert, seek the devils’ assembly:\n\nHis calling no more was the same he had followed\n\nLong in his lifetime. The liege-kinsman worthy\n\nOf Higelac minded his speech of the evening,\n\nStood he up straight and stoutly did seize him.\n\nHis fingers crackled; the giant was outward,\n\nThe earl stepped farther. The famous one minded\n\nTo flee away farther, if he found an occasion,\n\nAnd off and away, avoiding delay,\n\nTo fly to the fen-moors; he fully was ware of\n\nThe strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman.\n\n’Twas an ill-taken journey that the injury-bringing,\n\nHarrying harmer to Heorot wandered:\n\nThe palace re-echoed; to all of the Danemen,\n\nDwellers in castles, to each of the bold ones,\n\nEarlmen, was terror. Angry they both were,\n\nArchwarders raging. Rattled the building;\n\n’Twas a marvellous wonder that the wine-hall withstood then\n\nThe bold-in-battle, bent not to earthward,\n\nExcellent earth-hall; but within and without it\n\nWas fastened so firmly in fetters of iron,\n\nBy the art of the armorer. Off from the sill there\n\nBent mead-benches many, as men have informed me,\n\nAdorned with gold-work, where the grim ones did struggle.\n\nThe Scylding wise men weened ne’er before\n\nThat by might and main-strength a man under heaven\n\nMight break it in pieces, bone-decked, resplendent,\n\nCrush it by cunning, unless clutch of the fire\n\nIn smoke should consume it. The sound mounted upward\n\nNovel enough; on the North Danes fastened\n\nA terror of anguish, on all of the men there\n\nWho heard from the wall the weeping and plaining,\n\nThe song of defeat from the foeman of heaven,\n\nHeard him hymns of horror howl, and his sorrow\n\nHell-bound bewailing. He held him too firmly\n\nWho was strongest of main-strength of men of that era.\n\nPart XIII\n\nFor no cause whatever would the earlmen’s defender\n\nLeave in life-joys the loathsome newcomer,\n\nHe deemed his existence utterly useless\n\nTo men under heaven. Many a noble\n\nOf Beowulf brandished his battle-sword old,\n\nWould guard the life of his lord and protector,\n\nThe far-famous chieftain, if able to do so;\n\nWhile waging the warfare, this wist they but little,\n\nBrave battle-thanes, while his body intending\n\nTo slit into slivers, and seeking his spirit:\n\nThat the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons\n\nOf all on the earth, nor any of war-bills\n\nWas willing to injure; but weapons of victory\n\nSwords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with.\n\nHis death at that time must prove to be wretched,\n\nAnd the far-away spirit widely should journey\n\nInto enemies’ power. This plainly he saw then\n\nWho with mirth of mood malice no little\n\nHad wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen\n\n(To God he was hostile), that his body would fail him,\n\nBut Higelac’s hardy henchman and kinsman\n\nHeld him by the hand; hateful to other\n\nWas each one if living. A body-wound suffered\n\nThe direful demon, damage incurable\n\nWas seen on his shoulder, his sinews were shivered,\n\nHis body did burst. To Beowulf was given\n\nGlory in battle; Grendel from thenceward\n\nMust flee and hide him in the fen-cliffs and marshes,\n\nSick unto death, his dwelling must look for\n\nUnwinsome and woful; he wist the more fully\n\nThe monster flees away to hide in the moors.\n\nThe end of his earthly existence was nearing,\n\nHis life-days’ limits. At last for the Danemen,\n\nWhen the slaughter was over, their wish was accomplished.\n\nThe comer-from-far-land had cleansed then of evil,\n\nWise and valiant, the war-hall of Hrothgar,\n\nSaved it from violence. He joyed in the night-work,\n\nIn repute for prowess; the prince of the Geatmen\n\nFor the East-Danish people his boast had accomplished,\n\nBettered their burdensome bale-sorrows fully,\n\nThe craft-begot evil they erstwhile had suffered\n\nAnd were forced to endure from crushing oppression,\n\nTheir manifold misery. ’Twas a manifest token,\n\nWhen the hero-in-battle the hand suspended,\n\nThe arm and the shoulder (there was all of the claw\n\nOf Grendel together) ’neath great-stretching hall-roof.\n\nPart XIV\n\nIn the mist of the morning many a warrior\n\nStood round the gift-hall, as the story is told me:\n\nFolk-princes fared then from far and from near\n\nThrough long-stretching journeys to look at the wonder,\n\nThe footprints of the foeman. Few of the warriors\n\nWho gazed on the foot-tracks of the inglorious creature\n\nHis parting from life pained very deeply,\n\nHow, weary in spirit, off from those regions\n\nIn combats conquered he carried his traces,\n\nFated and flying, to the flood of the nickers.\n\nThere in bloody billows bubbled the currents,\n\nThe angry eddy was everywhere mingled\n\nAnd seething with gore, welling with sword-blood;\n\nHe death-doomed had hid him, when reaved of his joyance\n\nHe laid down his life in the lair he had fled to,\n\nHis heathenish spirit, where hell did receive him.\n\nThence the friends from of old backward turned them,\n\nAnd many a younker from merry adventure,\n\nStriding their stallions, stout from the seaward,\n\nHeroes on horses. There were heard very often\n\nBeowulf’s praises; many often asserted\n\nThat neither south nor north, in the circuit of waters,\n\nO’er outstretching earth-plain, none other was better\n\n’Mid bearers of war-shields, more worthy to govern,\n\n’Neath the arch of the ether. Not any, however,\n\n’Gainst the friend-lord muttered, mocking-words uttered\n\nOf Hrothgar the gracious (a good king he).\n\nOft the famed ones permitted their fallow-skinned horses\n\nTo run in rivalry, racing and chasing,\n\nWhere the fieldways appeared to them fair and inviting,\n\nKnown for their excellence; oft a thane of the folk-lord,\n\nA man of celebrity, mindful of rhythms,\n\nWho ancient traditions treasured in memory,\n\nNew word-groups found properly bound:\n\nThe bard after ’gan then Beowulf’s venture\n\nWisely to tell of, and words that were clever\n\nTo utter skilfully, earnestly speaking,\n\nEverything told he that he heard as to Sigmund’s\n\nMighty achievements, many things hidden,\n\nThe strife of the Wælsing, the wide-going ventures\n\nThe children of men knew of but little,\n\nThe feud and the fury, but Fitela with him,\n\nWhen suchlike matters he minded to speak of,\n\nUncle to nephew, as in every contention\n\nEach to other was ever devoted:\n\nA numerous host of the race of the scathers\n\nThey had slain with the sword-edge. To Sigmund accrued then\n\nNo little of glory, when his life-days were over,\n\nSince he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon,\n\nThe hoard-treasure’s keeper; ’neath the hoar-grayish stone he,\n\nThe son of the atheling, unaided adventured\n\nThe perilous project; not present was Fitela,\n\nYet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon\n\nThrough the marvellous dragon, that it stood in the wall,\n\nWell-honored weapon; the worm was slaughtered.\n\nThe great one had gained then by his glorious achievement\n\nTo reap from the ring-hoard richest enjoyment,\n\nAs best it did please him: his vessel he loaded,\n\nShining ornaments on the ship’s bosom carried,\n\nKinsman of Wæls: the drake in heat melted.\n\nHe was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims,\n\nMid wide-scattered world-folk, for works of great prowess,\n\nWar-troopers’ shelter: hence waxed he in honor.4\n\nAfterward Heremod’s hero-strength failed him,\n\nHis vigor and valor. ’Mid venomous haters\n\nTo the hands of foemen he was foully delivered,\n\nOffdriven early. Agony-billows\n\nOppressed him too long, to his people he became then,\n\nTo all the athelings, an ever-great burden;\n\nAnd the daring one’s journey in days of yore\n\nMany wise men were wont to deplore,\n\nSuch as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow,\n\nThat the son of their ruler should rise into power,\n\nHolding the headship held by his fathers,\n\nShould govern the people, the gold-hoard and borough,\n\nThe kingdom of heroes, the realm of the Scyldings.\n\nHe to all men became then far more beloved,\n\nHigelac’s kinsman, to kindreds and races,\n\nTo his friends much dearer; him malice assaulted.—\n\nOft running and racing on roadsters they measured\n\nThe dun-colored highways. Then the light of the morning\n\nWas hurried and hastened. Went henchmen in numbers\n\nTo the beautiful building, bold ones in spirit,\n\nTo look at the wonder; the liegelord himself then\n\nFrom his wife-bower wending, warden of treasures,\n\nGlorious trod with troopers unnumbered,\n\nFamed for his virtues, and with him the queen-wife\n\nMeasured the mead-ways, with maidens attending.\n\nPart XV\n\nHrothgar discoursed (to the hall-building went he,\n\nHe stood by the pillar, saw the steep-rising hall-roof\n\nGleaming with gold-gems, and Grendel his hand there):\n\n“For the sight we behold now, thanks to the Wielder\n\nEarly be offered! Much evil I bided,\n\nSnaring from Grendel: God can e’er ’complish\n\nWonder on wonder, Wielder of Glory!\n\nBut lately I reckoned ne’er under heaven\n\nComfort to gain me for any of sorrows,\n\nWhile the handsomest of houses horrid with bloodstain\n\nGory uptowered; grief had offfrightened\n\nEach of the wise ones who weened not that ever\n\nThe folk-troop’s defences ’gainst foes they should strengthen,\n\n’Gainst sprites and monsters. Through the might of the Wielder\n\nA doughty retainer hath a deed now accomplished\n\nWhich erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom\n\nFailed to perform. May affirm very truly\n\nWhat woman soever in all of the nations\n\nGave birth to the child, if yet she surviveth,\n\nThat the long-ruling Lord was lavish to herward\n\nIn the birth of the bairn. Now, Beowulf dear,\n\nMost excellent hero, I’ll love thee in spirit\n\nAs bairn of my body; bear well henceforward\n\nThe relationship new. No lack shall befall thee\n\nOf earth-joys any I ever can give thee.\n\nFull often for lesser service I’ve given\n\nHero less hardy hoard-treasure precious,\n\nTo a weaker in war-strife. By works of distinction\n\nThou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish\n\nForever and ever. The All-Ruler quite thee\n\nWith good from His hand as He hitherto did thee!”\n\nBeowulf answered, Ecgtheow’s offspring:\n\n“That labor of glory most gladly achieved we,\n\nThe combat accomplished, unquailing we ventured\n\nThe enemy’s grapple; I would grant it much rather\n\nThou wert able to look at the creature in person,\n\nFaint unto falling, the foe in his trappings!\n\nOn murder-bed quickly I minded to bind him,\n\nWith firm-holding fetters, that forced by my grapple\n\nLow he should lie in life-and-death struggle\n\n’Less his body escape; I was wholly unable,\n\nSince God did not will it, to keep him from going,\n\nNot held him that firmly, hated opposer;\n\nToo swift was the foeman. Yet safety regarding\n\nHe suffered his hand behind him to linger,\n\nHis arm and shoulder, to act as watcher;\n\nNo shadow of solace the woe-begone creature\n\nFound him there nathless: the hated destroyer\n\nLiveth no longer, lashed for his evils,\n\nBut sorrow hath seized him, in snare-meshes hath him\n\nClose in its clutches, keepeth him writhing\n\nIn baleful bonds: there banished for evil\n\nThe man shall wait for the mighty tribunal,\n\nHow the God of glory shall give him his earnings.”\n\nThen the soldier kept silent, son of old Ecglaf,\n\nFrom boasting and bragging of battle-achievements,\n\nSince the princes beheld there the hand that depended\n\n’Neath the lofty hall-timbers by the might of the nobleman, Each one before him, the enemy’s fingers;\n\nEach finger-nail strong steel most resembled,\n\nThe heathen one’s hand-spur, the hero-in-battle’s\n\nClaw most uncanny; quoth they agreeing,\n\nThat not any excellent edges of brave ones\n\nWas willing to touch him, the terrible creature’s\n\nBattle-hand bloody to bear away from him.\n\nPart XVI\n\nThen straight was ordered that Heorot inside\n\nWith hands be embellished: a host of them gathered,\n\nOf men and women, who the wassailing-building\n\nThe guest-hall begeared. Gold-flashing sparkled\n\nWebs on the walls then, of wonders a many\n\nTo each of the heroes that look on such objects.\n\nThe beautiful building was broken to pieces\n\nWhich all within with irons was fastened,\n\nIts hinges torn off: only the roof was\n\nWhole and uninjured when the horrible creature\n\nOutlawed for evil off had betaken him,\n\nHopeless of living. ’Tis hard to avoid it\n\n(Whoever will do it!); but he doubtless must come to The place awaiting, as Wyrd hath appointed,\n\nSoul-bearers, earth-dwellers, earls under heaven,\n\nWhere bound on its bed his body shall slumber\n\nWhen feasting is finished. Full was the time then\n\nThat the son of Healfdene went to the building;\n\nThe excellent atheling would eat of the banquet.\n\nNe’er heard I that people with hero-band larger\n\nBare them better tow’rds their bracelet-bestower.\n\nThe laden-with-glory stooped to the bench then\n\n(Their kinsmen-companions in plenty were joyful,\n\nMany a cupful quaffing complaisantly),\n\nDoughty of spirit in the high-tow’ring palace,\n\nHrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot then inside\n\nWas filled with friendly ones; falsehood and treachery\n\nThe Folk-Scyldings now nowise did practise.\n\nThen the offspring of Healfdene offered to Beowulf\n\nA golden standard, as reward for the victory,\n\nA banner embossed, burnie and helmet;\n\nMany men saw then a song-famous weapon\n\nBorne ’fore the hero. Beowulf drank of\n\nThe cup in the building; that treasure-bestowing\n\nHe needed not blush for in battle-men’s presence.\n\nNe’er heard I that many men on the ale-bench\n\nIn friendlier fashion to their fellows presented\n\nFour bright jewels with gold-work embellished.\n\n’Round the roof of the helmet a head-guarder outside\n\nBraided with wires, with bosses was furnished,\n\nThat swords-for-the-battle fight-hardened might fail\n\nBoldly to harm him, when the hero proceeded\n\nForth against foemen. The defender of earls then\n\nCommanded that eight steeds with bridles\n\nGold-plated, gleaming, be guided to hallward,\n\nInside the building; on one of them stood then\n\nAn art-broidered saddle embellished with jewels;\n\n’Twas the sovereign’s seat, when the son of King Healfdene\n\nWas pleased to take part in the play of the edges;\n\nThe famous one’s valor ne’er failed at the front when\n\nSlain ones were bowing. And to Beowulf granted\n\nThe prince of the Ingwins, power over both,\n\nO’er war-steeds and weapons; bade him well to enjoy them.\n\nIn so manly a manner the mighty-famed chieftain,\n\nHoard-ward of heroes, with horses and jewels\n\nWar-storms requited, that none e’er condemneth\n\nWho willeth to tell truth with full justice.\n\nPart XVII\n\nAnd the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes\n\nWho the ways of the waters went with Beowulf,\n\nA costly gift-token gave on the mead-bench,\n\nOffered an heirloom, and ordered that that man\n\nThe warrior killed by Grendel is to be paid for in gold.\n\nWith gold should be paid for, whom Grendel had erstwhile\n\nWickedly slaughtered, as he more of them had done\n\nHad far-seeing God and the mood of the hero\n\nThe fate not averted: the Father then governed\n\nAll of the earth-dwellers, as He ever is doing;\n\nHence insight for all men is everywhere fittest,\n\nForethought of spirit! much he shall suffer\n\nOf lief and of loathsome who long in this present\n\nUseth the world in this woful existence.\n\nThere was music and merriment mingling together\n\nTouching Healfdene’s leader; the joy-wood was fingered,\n\nMeasures recited, when the singer of Hrothgar\n\nOn mead-bench should mention the merry hall-joyance\n\nOf the kinsmen of Finn, when onset surprised them:\n\n“The Half-Danish hero, Hnæf of the Scyldings,\n\nOn the field of the Frisians was fated to perish.\n\nSure Hildeburg needed not mention approving\n\nThe faith of the Jutemen: though blameless entirely,\n\nWhen shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings,\n\nOf bairns and brothers: they bent to their fate\n\nWith war-spear wounded; woe was that woman.\n\nNot causeless lamented the daughter of Hoce\n\nThe decree of the Wielder when morning-light came and\n\nShe was able ’neath heaven to behold the destruction\n\nOf brothers and bairns, where the brightest of earth-joys\n\nShe had hitherto had: all the henchmen of Finn\n\nWar had offtaken, save a handful remaining,\n\nThat he nowise was able to offer resistance\n\nTo the onset of Hengest in the parley of battle,\n\nNor the wretched remnant to rescue in war from\n\nThe earl of the atheling; but they offered conditions,\n\nCompact between the Frisians and the Danes.\n\nAnother great building to fully make ready,\n\nA hall and a high-seat, that half they might rule with\n\nThe sons of the Jutemen, and that Folcwalda’s son would\n\nDay after day the Danemen honor\n\nWhen gifts were giving, and grant of his ring-store\n\nTo Hengest’s earl-troop ever so freely,\n\nOf his gold-plated jewels, as he encouraged the Frisians\n\nOn the bench of the beer-hall. On both sides they swore then\n\nA fast-binding compact; Finn unto Hengest\n\nWith no thought of revoking vowed then most solemnly\n\nThe woe-begone remnant well to take charge of,\n\nHis Witan advising; the agreement should no one\n\nBy words or works weaken and shatter,\n\nBy artifice ever injure its value,\n\nThough reaved of their ruler their ring-giver’s slayer\n\nThey followed as vassals, Fate so requiring:\n\nThen if one of the Frisians the quarrel should speak of\n\nIn tones that were taunting, terrible edges\n\nShould cut in requital. Accomplished the oath was,\n\nAnd treasure of gold from the hoard was uplifted.\n\nThe best of the Scylding braves was then fully\n\nPrepared for the pile; at the pyre was seen clearly\n\nThe blood-gory burnie, the boar with his gilding,\n\nThe iron-hard swine, athelings many\n\nFatally wounded; no few had been slaughtered.\n\nHildeburg bade then, at the burning of Hnæf,\n\nThe bairn of her bosom to bear to the fire,\n\nThat his body be burned and borne to the pyre.\n\nThe woe-stricken woman wept on his shoulder,\n\nIn measures lamented; upmounted the hero.\n\nThe greatest of dead-fires curled to the welkin,\n\nOn the hill’s-front crackled; heads were a-melting,\n\nWound-doors bursting, while the blood was a-coursing\n\nFrom body-bite fierce. The fire devoured them,\n\nGreediest of spirits, whom war had offcarried\n\nFrom both of the peoples; their bravest were fallen.\n\nPart XVIII\n\n“Then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings,\n\nReaved of their friends, Friesland to visit,\n\nTheir homes and high-city. Hengest continued\n\nBiding with Finn the blood-tainted winter,\n\nWholly unsundered; of fatherland thought he\n\nThough unable to drive the ring-stemmèd vessel\n\nO’er the ways of the waters; the wave-deeps were tossing,\n\nFought with the wind; winter in ice-bonds\n\nClosed up the currents, till there came to the dwelling\n\nA year in its course, as yet it revolveth,\n\nIf season propitious one alway regardeth,\n\nWorld-cheering weathers. Then winter was gone,\n\nEarth’s bosom was lovely; the exile would get him,\n\nThe guest from the palace; on grewsomest vengeance\n\nHe brooded more eager than on oversea journeys,\n\nWhe’r onset-of-anger he were able to ’complish,\n\nThe bairns of the Jutemen therein to remember.\n\nNowise refused he the duties of liegeman\n\nWhen Hun of the Frisians the battle-sword Láfing,\n\nFairest of falchions, friendly did give him:\n\nIts edges were famous in folk-talk of Jutland.\n\nAnd savage sword-fury seized in its clutches\n\nBold-mooded Finn where he bode in his palace,\n\nWhen the grewsome grapple Guthlaf and Oslaf\n\nHad mournfully mentioned, the mere-journey over,\n\nFor sorrows half-blamed him; the flickering spirit\n\nCould not bide in his bosom. Then the building was covered\n\nWith corpses of foemen, and Finn too was slaughtered,\n\nThe king with his comrades, and the queen made a prisoner.\n\nThe troops of the Scyldings bore to their vessels\n\nAll that the land-king had in his palace,\n\nSuch trinkets and treasures they took as, on searching,\n\nAt Finn’s they could find. They ferried to Daneland\n\nThe excellent woman on oversea journey,\n\nLed her to their land-folk.” The lay was concluded,\n\nThe gleeman’s recital. Shouts again rose then,\n\nBench-glee resounded, bearers then offered\n\nWine from wonder-vats. Wealhtheo advanced then\n\nGoing ’neath gold-crown, where the good ones were seated\n\nUncle and nephew; their peace was yet mutual,\n\nTrue each to the other. And Unferth the spokesman\n\nSat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings:\n\nEach trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous,\n\nThough at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen.\n\nSaid the queen of the Scyldings: “My lord and protector,\n\nTreasure-bestower, take thou this beaker;\n\nJoyance attend thee, gold-friend of heroes,\n\nAnd greet thou the Geatmen with gracious responses!\n\nSo ought one to do. Be kind to the Geatmen,\n\nIn gifts not niggardly; anear and afar now\n\nPeace thou enjoyest. Report hath informed me\n\nThou’lt have for a bairn the battle-brave hero.\n\nNow is Heorot cleansèd, ring-palace gleaming;\n\nGive while thou mayest many rewards,\n\nAnd bequeath to thy kinsmen kingdom and people,\n\nOn wending thy way to the Wielder’s splendor.\n\nI know good Hrothulf, that the noble young troopers\n\nHe’ll care for and honor, lord of the Scyldings,\n\nIf earth-joys thou endest earlier than he doth;\n\nI reckon that recompense he’ll render with kindness\n\nOur offspring and issue, if that all he remember,\n\nWhat favors of yore, when he yet was an infant,\n\nWe awarded to him for his worship and pleasure.”\n\nThen she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing,\n\nHrethric and Hrothmund, and the heroes’ offspring,\n\nThe war-youth together; there the good one was sitting\n\n’Twixt the brothers twain, Beowulf Geatman.\n\nPart XIX\n\nA beaker was borne him, and bidding to quaff it\n\nGraciously given, and gold that was twisted\n\nPleasantly proffered, a pair of arm-jewels,\n\nRings and corslet, of collars the greatest\n\nI’ve heard of ’neath heaven. Of heroes not any\n\nMore splendid from jewels have I heard ’neath the welkin,\n\nSince Hama off bore the Brosingmen’s necklace,\n\nThe bracteates and jewels, from the bright-shining city,\n\nEormenric’s cunning craftiness fled from,\n\nChose gain everlasting. Geatish Higelac,\n\nGrandson of Swerting, last had this jewel\n\nWhen tramping ’neath banner the treasure he guarded,\n\nThe field-spoil defended; Fate offcarried him\n\nWhen for deeds of daring he endured tribulation,\n\nHate from the Frisians; the ornaments bare he\n\nO’er the cup of the currents, costly gem-treasures,\n\nMighty folk-leader, he fell ’neath his target;\n\nThe corpse of the king then came into charge of\n\nThe race of the Frankmen, the mail-shirt and collar:\n\nWarmen less noble plundered the fallen,\n\nWhen the fight was finished; the folk of the Geatmen\n\nPart XIX\n\nA beaker was borne him, and bidding to quaff it\n\nGraciously given, and gold that was twisted\n\nPleasantly proffered, a pair of arm-jewels,\n\nRings and corslet, of collars the greatest\n\nI’ve heard of ’neath heaven.

I’ll mind thy requital.\n\nThou hast brought it to pass that far and near\n\nForever and ever earthmen shall honor thee,\n\nEven so widely as ocean surroundeth\n\nThe blustering bluffs. Be, while thou livest,\n\nA wealth-blessèd atheling. I wish thee most truly\n\nJewels and treasure. Be kind to my son, thou\n\nLiving in joyance! Here each of the nobles\n\nIs true unto other, gentle in spirit,\n\nLoyal to leader. The liegemen are peaceful,\n\nThe war-troops ready: well-drunken heroes,\n\nDo as I bid ye.” Then she went to the settle.\n\nThere was choicest of banquets, wine drank the heroes:\n\nWeird they knew not, destiny cruel,\n\nAs to many an earlman early it happened,\n\nWhen evening had come and Hrothgar had parted\n\nOff to his manor, the mighty to slumber.\n\nWarriors unnumbered warded the building\n\nAs erst they did often: the ale-settle bared they,\n\n’Twas covered all over with beds and pillows.\n\nDoomed unto death, down to his slumber\n\nBowed then a beer-thane. Their battle-shields placed they,\n\nBright-shining targets, up by their heads then;\n\nO’er the atheling on ale-bench ’twas easy to see there\n\nBattle-high helmet, burnie of ring-mail,\n\nAnd mighty war-spear. ’Twas the wont of that people\n\nTo constantly keep them equipped for the battle,\n\nAt home or marching—in either condition—\n\nAt seasons just such as necessity ordered\n\nAs best for their ruler; that people was worthy.\n\nPart XX\n\nThey sank then to slumber. With sorrow one paid for\n\nHis evening repose, as often betid them\n\nWhile Grendel was holding the gold-bedecked palace,\n\nIll-deeds performing, till his end overtook him,\n\nDeath for his sins. ’Twas seen very clearly,\n\nKnown unto earth-folk, that still an avenger\n\nOutlived the loathed one, long since the sorrow\n\nCaused by the struggle; the mother of Grendel,\n\nDevil-shaped woman, her woe ever minded,\n\nWho was held to inhabit the horrible waters,\n\nThe cold-flowing currents, after Cain had become a\n\nSlayer-with-edges to his one only brother,\n\nThe son of his sire; he set out then banished,\n\nMarked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,\n\nLived in the desert. Thence demons unnumbered\n\nFate-sent awoke; one of them Grendel,\n\nSword-cursèd, hateful, who at Heorot met with\n\nA man that was watching, waiting the struggle,\n\nWhere a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;\n\nNathless he minded the might of his body,\n\nThe glorious gift God had allowed him,\n\nAnd folk-ruling Father’s favor relied on,\n\nHis help and His comfort: so he conquered the foeman,\n\nThe hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,\n\nReaved of his joyance, journeying to death-haunts,\n\nFoeman of man. His mother moreover\n\nEager and gloomy was anxious to go on\n\nHer mournful mission, mindful of vengeance\n\nFor the death of her son. She came then to Heorot\n\nWhere the Armor-Dane earlmen all through the building\n\nWere lying in slumber. Soon there became then\n\nReturn to the nobles, when the mother of Grendel\n\nEntered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous\n\nBy even so much as the vigor of maidens,\n\nWar-strength of women, by warrior is reckoned,\n\nWhen well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,\n\nBlade very bloody, brave with its edges,\n\nStrikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.\n\nThen the hard-edgèd weapon was heaved in the building,\n\nThe brand o’er the benches, broad-lindens many\n\nHand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,\n\nFor armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.\n\nShe went then hastily, outward would get her\n\nHer life for to save, when some one did spy her;\n\nSoon she had grappled one of the athelings\n\nFast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;\n\nThat one to Hrothgar was liefest of heroes\n\nIn rank of retainer where waters encircle,\n\nA mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,\n\nA broadly-famed battle-knight. Beowulf was absent,\n\nBut another apartment was erstwhile devoted\n\nTo the glory-decked Geatman when gold was distributed.\n\nThere was hubbub in Heorot. The hand that was famous\n\nShe grasped in its gore; grief was renewed then\n\nIn homes and houses: ’twas no happy arrangement\n\nIn both of the quarters to barter and purchase\n\nWith lives of their friends. Then the well-agèd ruler,\n\nThe gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,\n\nWhen his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,\n\nHis dearest one gone. Quick from a room was\n\nBeowulf brought, brave and triumphant.\n\nAs day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,\n\nWent then that earlman, champion noble,\n\nCame with comrades, where the clever one bided\n\nWhether God all gracious would grant him a respite\n\nAfter the woe he had suffered. The war-worthy hero\n\nWith a troop of retainers trod then the pavement\n\n(The hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,\n\nThe earl of the Ingwins; asked if the night had\n\nFully refreshed him, as fain he would have it.\n\nPart XXI\n\nHrothgar rejoined, helm of the Scyldings:\n\n“Ask not of joyance! Grief is renewed to\n\nThe folk of the Danemen. Dead is Æschere,\n\nYrmenlaf’s brother, older than he,\n\nMy true-hearted counsellor, trusty adviser,\n\nShoulder-companion, when fighting in battle\n\nOur heads we protected, when troopers were clashing,\n\nAnd heroes were dashing; such an earl should be ever,\n\nAn erst-worthy atheling, as Æschere proved him.\n\nThe flickering death-spirit became in Heorot\n\nHis hand-to-hand murderer; I can not tell whither\n\nThe cruel one turned in the carcass exulting,\n\nBy cramming discovered. The quarrel she wreaked then,\n\nThat last night igone Grendel thou killedst\n\nIn grewsomest manner, with grim-holding clutches,\n\nSince too long he had lessened my liege-troop and wasted\n\nMy folk-men so foully. He fell in the battle\n\nWith forfeit of life, and another has followed,\n\nA mighty crime-worker, her kinsman avenging,\n\nAnd henceforth hath ‘stablished her hatred unyielding,\n\nAs it well may appear to many a liegeman,\n\nWho mourneth in spirit the treasure-bestower,\n\nHer heavy heart-sorrow; the hand is now lifeless\n\nWhich availed you in every wish that you cherished.\n\nLand-people heard I, liegemen, this saying,\n\nDwellers in halls, they had seen very often\n\nA pair of such mighty march-striding creatures,\n\nFar-dwelling spirits, holding the moorlands:\n\nOne of them wore, as well they might notice,\n\nThe image of woman, the other one wretched\n\nIn guise of a man wandered in exile,\n\nExcept he was huger than any of earthmen;\n\nEarth-dwelling people entitled him Grendel\n\nIn days of yore: they know not their father,\n\nWhe’r ill-going spirits any were borne him Ever before.\n\nThey guard the wolf-coverts, Lands inaccessible, wind-beaten nesses,\n\nFearfullest fen-deeps, where a flood from the mountains\n\n’Neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles,\n\nThe stream under earth: not far is it henceward\n\nMeasured by mile-lengths that the mere-water standeth,\n\nWhich forests hang over, with frost-whiting covered,\n\nA firm-rooted forest, the floods overshadow.\n\nThere ever at night one an ill-meaning portent\n\nA fire-flood may see; ’mong children of men\n\nNone liveth so wise that wot of the bottom;\n\nThough harassed by hounds the heath-stepper seek for,\n\nFly to the forest, firm-antlered he-deer,\n\nSpurred from afar, his spirit he yieldeth,\n\nHis life on the shore, ere in he will venture\n\nTo cover his head. Uncanny the place is:\n\nThence upward ascendeth the surging of waters,\n\nWan to the welkin, when the wind is stirring\n\nThe weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy,\n\nAnd the heavens lower. Now is help to be gotten\n\nFrom thee and thee only! The abode thou know’st not,\n\nThe dangerous place where thou’rt able to meet with\n\nThe sin-laden hero: seek if thou darest!\n\nFor the feud I will fully fee thee with money,\n\nWith old-time treasure, as erstwhile I did thee,\n\nWith well-twisted jewels, if away thou shalt get thee.”\n\nPart XXII\n\nBeowulf answered, Ecgtheow’s son:\n\n“Grieve not, O wise one! for each it is better,\n\nHis friend to avenge than with vehemence wail him;\n\nEach of us must the end-day abide of\n\nHis earthly existence; who is able accomplish\n\nGlory ere death! To battle-thane noble\n\nLifeless lying, ’tis at last most fitting.\n\nArise, O king, quick let us hasten\n\nTo look at the footprint of the kinsman of Grendel!\n\nI promise thee this now: to his place he’ll escape not,\n\nTo embrace of the earth, nor to mountainous forest,\n\nNor to depths of the ocean, wherever he wanders.\n\nPractice thou now patient endurance\n\nOf each of thy sorrows, as I hope for thee soothly!”\n\nThen up sprang the old one, the All-Wielder thanked he,\n\nRuler Almighty, that the man had outspoken.\n\nThen for Hrothgar a war-horse was decked with a bridle,\n\nCurly-maned courser. The clever folk-leader\n\nStately proceeded: stepped then an earl-troop\n\nOf linden-wood bearers. Her footprints were seen then\n\nWidely in wood-paths, her way o’er the bottoms,\n\nWhere she faraway fared o’er fen-country murky,\n\nBore away breathless the best of retainers\n\nWho pondered with Hrothgar the welfare of country.\n\nThe son of the athelings then went o’er the stony,\n\nDeclivitous cliffs, the close-covered passes,\n\nNarrow passages, paths unfrequented,\n\nNesses abrupt, nicker-haunts many;\n\nOne of a few of wise-mooded heroes,\n\nHe onward advanced to view the surroundings,\n\nTill he found unawares woods of the mountain\n\nO’er hoar-stones hanging, holt-wood unjoyful;\n\nThe water stood under, welling and gory.\n\n’Twas irksome in spirit to all of the Danemen,\n\nFriends of the Scyldings, to many a liegeman\n\nSad to be suffered, a sorrow unlittle\n\nTo each of the earlmen, when to Æschere’s head they\n\nCame on the cliff. The current was seething\n\nWith blood and with gore (the troopers gazed on it).\n\nThe horn anon sang the battle-song ready.\n\nThe troop were all seated; they saw ’long the water then\n\nMany a serpent, mere-dragons wondrous\n\nTrying the waters, nickers a-lying\n\nOn the cliffs of the nesses, which at noonday full often\n\nGo on the sea-deeps their sorrowful journey,\n\nWild-beasts and wormkind; away then they hastened\n\not-mooded, hateful, they heard the great clamor,\n\nThe war-trumpet winding. One did the Geat-prince\n\nSunder from earth-joys, with arrow from bowstring,\n\nFrom his sea-struggle tore him, that the trusty war-missile\n\nPierced to his vitals; he proved in the currents\n\nLess doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried.\n\nSoon in the waters the wonderful swimmer\n\nWas straitened most sorely with sword-pointed boar-spears,\n\nPressed in the battle and pulled to the cliff-edge;\n\nThe liegemen then looked on the loath-fashioned stranger.\n\nBeowulf donned then his battle-equipments,\n\nCared little for life; inlaid and most ample,\n\nThe hand-woven corslet which could cover his body,\n\nMust the wave-deeps explore, that war might be powerless\n\nTo harm the great hero, and the hating one’s grasp might\n\nNot peril his safety; his head was protected\n\nBy the light-flashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms,\n\nTrying the eddies, treasure-emblazoned,\n\nEncircled with jewels, as in seasons long past\n\nThe weapon-smith worked it, wondrously made it,\n\nWith swine-bodies fashioned it, that thenceforward no longer\n\nBrand might bite it, and battle-sword hurt it.\n\nAnd that was not least of helpers in prowess\n\nThat Hrothgar’s spokesman had lent him when straitened;\n\nAnd the hilted hand-sword was Hrunting entitled,\n\nOld and most excellent ’mong all of the treasures;\n\nIts blade was of iron, blotted with poison,\n\nHardened with gore; it failed not in battle\n\nAny hero under heaven in hand who it brandished,\n\nWho ventured to take the terrible journeys,\n\nThe battle-field sought; not the earliest occasion\n\nThat deeds of daring ’twas destined to ’complish.\n\nEcglaf’s kinsman minded not soothly,\n\nExulting in strength, what erst he had spoken\n\nDrunken with wine, when the weapon he lent to\n\nA sword-hero bolder; himself did not venture\n\n’Neath the strife of the currents his life to endanger,\n\nTo fame-deeds perform; there he forfeited glory,\n\nRepute for his strength. Not so with the other\n\nWhen he clad in his corslet had equipped him for battle.\n\nPart XXIII\n\nBeowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s son:\n\n“Recall now, oh, famous kinsman of Healfdene,\n\nPrince very prudent, now to part I am ready,\n\nGold-friend of earlmen, what erst we agreed on,\n\nShould I lay down my life in lending thee assistance,\n\nWhen my earth-joys were over, thou wouldst evermore serve me\n\nIn stead of a father; my faithful thanemen,\n\nMy trusty retainers, protect thou and care for,\n\nFall I in battle: and, Hrothgar belovèd,\n\nSend unto Higelac the high-valued jewels\n\nThou to me hast allotted. The lord of the Geatmen\n\nMay perceive from the gold, the Hrethling may see it\n\nWhen he looks on the jewels, that a gem-giver found I\n\nGood over-measure, enjoyed him while able.\n\nAnd the ancient heirloom Unferth permit thou,\n\nThe famed one to have, the heavy-sword splendid\n\nThe hard-edgèd weapon; with Hrunting to aid me,\n\nI shall gain me glory, or grim-death shall take me.”\n\nThe atheling of Geatmen uttered these words and\n\nHeroic did hasten, not any rejoinder\n\nWas willing to wait for; the wave-current swallowed\n\nThe doughty-in-battle. Then a day’s-length elapsed ere\n\nHe was able to see the sea at its bottom.\n\nEarly she found then who fifty of winters\n\nThe course of the currents kept in her fury,\n\nGrisly and greedy, that the grim one’s dominion\n\nSome one of men from above was exploring.\n\nForth did she grab them, grappled the warrior\n\nWith horrible clutches; yet no sooner she injured\n\nHis body unscathèd: the burnie out-guarded,\n\nThat she proved but powerless to pierce through the armor,\n\nThe limb-mail locked, with loath-grabbing fingers.\n\nThe sea-wolf bare then, when bottomward came she,\n\nThe ring-prince homeward, that he after was powerless\n\n(He had daring to do it) to deal with his weapons,\n\nBut many a mere-beast tormented him swimming,\n\nFlood-beasts no few with fierce-biting tusks did\n\nBreak through his burnie, the brave one pursued they.\n\nThe earl then discovered he was down in some cavern\n\nWhere no water whatever anywise harmed him,\n\nAnd the clutch of the current could come not anear him,\n\nSince the roofed-hall prevented; brightness a-gleaming\n\nFire-light he saw, flashing resplendent.\n\nThe good one saw then the sea-bottom’s monster,\n\nThe mighty mere-woman; he made a great onset\n\nWith weapon-of-battle, his hand not desisted\n\nFrom striking, that war-blade struck on her head then\n\nA battle-song greedy. The stranger perceived then\n\nThe sword would not bite, her life would not injure,\n\nBut the falchion failed the folk-prince when straitened:\n\nErst had it often onsets encountered,\n\nOft cloven the helmet, the fated one’s armor:\n\n’Twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel\n\nHad failed of its fame. Firm-mooded after,\n\nNot heedless of valor, but mindful of glory,\n\nWas Higelac’s kinsman; the hero-chief angry\n\nCast then his carved-sword covered with jewels\n\nThat it lay on the earth, hard and steel-pointed;\n\nHe hoped in his strength, his hand-grapple sturdy.\n\nSo any must act whenever he thinketh\n\nTo gain him in battle glory unending,\n\nAnd is reckless of living. The lord of the War-Geats\n\n(He shrank not from battle) seized by the shoulder\n\nThe mother of Grendel; then mighty in struggle\n\nSwung he his enemy, since his anger was kindled,\n\nThat she fell to the floor. With furious grapple\n\nShe gave him requital early thereafter,\n\nAnd stretched out to grab him; the strongest of warriors\n\nFaint-mooded stumbled, till he fell in his traces,\n\nFoot-going champion. Then she sat on the hall-guest\n\nAnd wielded her war-knife wide-bladed, flashing,\n\nFor her son would take vengeance, her one only bairn.\n\nHis breast-armor woven bode on his shoulder;\n\nIt guarded his life, the entrance defended\n\n’Gainst sword-point and edges. Ecgtheow’s son there\n\nHad fatally journeyed, champion of Geatmen,\n\nIn the arms of the ocean, had the armor not given,\n\nClose-woven corslet, comfort and succor,\n\nAnd had God most holy not awarded the victory,\n\nAll-knowing Lord; easily did heaven’s\n\nRuler most righteous arrange it with justice;\n\nUprose he erect ready for battle.\n\nPart XXIV\n\nThen he saw mid the war-gems a weapon of victory,\n\nAn ancient giant-sword, of edges a-doughty,\n\nGlory of warriors: of weapons ’twas choicest,\n\nOnly ’twas larger than any man else was\n\nAble to bear to the battle-encounter,\n\nThe good and splendid work of the giants.\n\nHe grasped then the sword-hilt, knight of the Scyldings,\n\nBold and battle-grim, brandished his ring-sword,\n\nHopeless of living, hotly he smote her,\n\nThat the fiend-woman’s neck firmly it grappled,\n\nBroke through her bone-joints, the bill fully pierced her\n\nFate-cursèd body, she fell to the ground then:\n\nThe hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted.\n\nThe brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,\n\nJust as from heaven gemlike shineth\n\nThe torch of the firmament. He glanced ’long the building,\n\nAnd turned by the wall then, Higelac’s vassal\n\nRaging and wrathful raised his battle-sword\n\nStrong by the handle. The edge was not useless\n\nTo the hero-in-battle, but he speedily wished to\n\nGive Grendel requital for the many assaults he\n\nHad worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,\n\nWhen he slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar,\n\nSwallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers\n\nOf the folk of the Danemen, and fully as many\n\nCarried away, a horrible prey.\n\nHe gave him requital, grim-raging champion,\n\nWhen he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict\n\nGrendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd,\n\nAs the battle at Heorot erstwhile had scathed him;\n\nHis body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,\n\nDeath having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,\n\nAnd he cut off his head then. Early this noticed\n\nThe clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar\n\nGazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents\n\nWere mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory:\n\nOf the good one the gray-haired together held converse,\n\nThe hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again\n\nThe atheling ever, that exulting in victory\n\nHe’d return there to visit the distinguished folk-ruler:\n\nThen many concluded the mere-wolf had killed him.\n\nThe ninth hour came then. From the ness-edge departed\n\nThe bold-mooded Scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes\n\nHomeward betook him. The strangers sat down then\n\nSoul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding:\n\nThey wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lord\n\nTo see any more. The sword-blade began then,\n\nThe blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling\n\nWith battle-icicles; ’twas a wonderful marvel\n\nThat it melted entirely, likest to ice when\n\nThe Father unbindeth the bond of the frost and\n\nUnwindeth the wave-bands, He who wieldeth dominion\n\nOf times and of tides: a truth-firm Creator.\n\nNor took he of jewels more in the dwelling,\n\nLord of the Weders, though they lay all around him,\n\nThan the head and the handle handsome with jewels;\n\nThe brand early melted, burnt was the weapon:\n\nSo hot was the blood, the strange-spirit poisonous\n\nThat in it did perish. He early swam off then\n\nWho had bided in combat the carnage of haters,\n\nWent up through the ocean; the eddies were cleansèd,\n\nThe spacious expanses, when the spirit from farland\n\nHis life put aside and this short-lived existence.\n\nThe seamen’s defender came swimming to land then\n\nDoughty of spirit, rejoiced in his sea-gift,\n\nThe bulky burden which he bore in his keeping.\n\nThe excellent vassals advanced then to meet him,\n\nTo God they were grateful, were glad in their chieftain,\n\nThat to see him safe and sound was granted them.\n\nFrom the high-minded hero, then, helmet and burnie\n\nWere speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid,\n\nThe water ’neath welkin weltered with gore.\n\nForth did they fare, then, their footsteps retracing,\n\nMerry and mirthful, measured the earth-way,\n\nThe highway familiar: men very daring\n\nBare then the head from the sea-cliff, burdening\n\nEach of the earlmen, excellent-valiant.\n\nFour of them had to carry with labor\n\nThe head of Grendel to the high towering gold-hall\n\nUpstuck on the spear, till fourteen most-valiant\n\nAnd battle-brave Geatmen came there going\n\nStraight to the palace: the prince of the people\n\nMeasured the mead-ways, their mood-brave companion.\n\nThe atheling of earlmen entered the building,\n\nDeed-valiant man, adorned with distinction,\n\nDoughty shield-warrior, to address King Hrothgar:\n\nThen hung by the hair, the head of Grendel\n\nWas borne to the building, where beer-thanes were drinking,\n\nLoth before earlmen and eke ’fore the lady:\n\nThe warriors beheld then a wonderful sight.\n\nPart XXV\n\nBeowulf spake, offspring of Ecgtheow:\n\n“Lo! we blithely have brought thee, bairn of Healfdene,\n\nPrince of the Scyldings, these presents from ocean\n\nWhich thine eye looketh on, for an emblem of glory.\n\nI came off alive from this, narrowly ’scaping:\n\nIn war ’neath the water the work with great pains I\n\nPerformed, and the fight had been finished quite nearly,\n\nHad God not defended me. I failed in the battle\n\nAught to accomplish, aided by Hrunting,\n\nThough that weapon was worthy, but the Wielder of earth-folk\n\nGave me willingly to see on the wall a\n\nHeavy old hand-sword hanging in splendor\n\n(He guided most often the lorn and the friendless),\n\nThat I swung as a weapon. The wards of the house then\n\nI killed in the conflict (when occasion was given me).\n\nThen the battle-sword burned, the brand that was lifted,\n\nAs the blood-current sprang, hottest of war-sweats;\n\nSeizing the hilt, from my foes I offbore it;\n\nI avenged as I ought to their acts of malignity,\n\nThe murder of Danemen. I then make thee this promise,\n\nThou’lt be able in Heorot careless to slumber\n\nWith thy throng of heroes and the thanes of thy people\n\nEvery and each, of greater and lesser,\n\nAnd thou needest not fear for them from the selfsame direction\n\nAs thou formerly fearedst, oh, folk-lord of Scyldings,\n\nEnd-day for earlmen.” To the age-hoary man then,\n\nThe gray-haired chieftain, the gold-fashioned sword-hilt,\n\nOld-work of giants, was thereupon given;\n\nSince the fall of the fiends, it fell to the keeping\n\nOf the wielder of Danemen, the wonder-smith’s labor,\n\nAnd the bad-mooded being abandoned this world then,\n\nOpponent of God, victim of murder,\n\nAnd also his mother; it went to the keeping\n\nOf the best of the world-kings, where waters encircle,\n\nWho the scot divided in Scylding dominion.\n\nHrothgar discoursed, the hilt he regarded,\n\nThe ancient heirloom where an old-time contention’s\n\nBeginning was graven: the gurgling currents,\n\nThe flood slew thereafter the race of the giants,\n\nThey had proved themselves daring: that people was loth to\n\nThe Lord everlasting, through lash of the billows\n\nThe Father gave them final requital.\n\nSo in letters of rune on the clasp of the handle\n\nGleaming and golden, ’twas graven exactly,\n\nSet forth and said, whom that sword had been made for,\n\nFinest of irons, who first it was wrought for,\n\nWreathed at its handle and gleaming with serpents.\n\nThe wise one then said (silent they all were)\n\nSon of old Healfdene: “He may say unrefuted\n\nWho performs ’mid the folk-men fairness and truth\n\n(The hoary old ruler remembers the past),\n\nThat better by birth is this bairn of the nobles!\n\nThy fame is extended through far-away countries,\n\nGood friend Beowulf, o’er all of the races,\n\nThou holdest all firmly, hero-like strength with\n\nPrudence of spirit. I’ll prove myself grateful\n\nAs before we agreed on; thou granted for long shalt\n\nBecome a great comfort to kinsmen and comrades,\n\nA help unto heroes. Heremod became not\n\nSuch to the Scyldings, successors of Ecgwela;\n\nHe grew not to please them, but grievous destruction,\n\nAnd diresome death-woes to Danemen attracted;\n\nHe slew in anger his table-companions,\n\nTrustworthy counsellors, till he turned off lonely\n\nFrom world-joys away, wide-famous ruler:\n\nThough high-ruling heaven in hero-strength raised him,\n\nIn might exalted him, o’er men of all nations\n\nMade him supreme, yet a murderous spirit\n\nGrew in his bosom: he gave then no ring-gems\n\nTo the Danes after custom; endured he unjoyful\n\nStanding the straits from strife that was raging,\n\nLongsome folk-sorrow. Learn then from this,\n\nLay hold of virtue! Though laden with winters,\n\nI have sung thee these measures. ’Tis a marvel to tell it,\n\nHow all-ruling God from greatness of spirit\n\nGiveth wisdom to children of men,\n\nManor and earlship: all things He ruleth.\n\nHe often permitteth the mood-thought of man of\n\nThe illustrious lineage to lean to possessions,\n\nAllows him earthly delights at his manor,\n\nA high-burg of heroes to hold in his keeping,\n\nMaketh portions of earth-folk hear him,\n\nAnd a wide-reaching kingdom so that, wisdom failing him,\n\nHe himself is unable to reckon its boundaries;\n\nHe liveth in luxury, little debars him,\n\nNor sickness nor age, no treachery-sorrow\n\nBecloudeth his spirit, conflict nowhere,\n\nNo sword-hate, appeareth, but all of the world doth\n\nWend as he wisheth; the worse he knoweth not,\n\nTill arrant arrogance inward pervading,\n\nWaxeth and springeth, when the warder is sleeping,\n\nThe guard of the soul: with sorrows encompassed,\n\nToo sound is his slumber, the slayer is near him,\n\nWho with bow and arrow aimeth in malice.\n\nPart XXVI\n\n“Then bruised in his bosom he with bitter-toothed missile\n\nIs hurt ’neath his helmet: from harmful pollution\n\nHe is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates\n\nOf the loath-cursèd spirit; what too long he hath holden\n\nHim seemeth too small, savage he hoardeth,\n\nNor boastfully giveth gold-plated rings,\n\nThe fate of the future flouts and forgetteth\n\nSince God had erst given him greatness no little,\n\nWielder of Glory. His end-day anear,\n\nIt afterward happens that the bodily-dwelling\n\nFleetingly fadeth, falls into ruins;\n\nAnother lays hold who doleth the ornaments,\n\nThe nobleman’s jewels, nothing lamenting,\n\nHeedeth no terror. Oh, Beowulf dear,\n\nBest of the heroes, from bale-strife defend thee,\n\nAnd choose thee the better, counsels eternal;\n\nBeware of arrogance, world-famous champion!\n\nBut a little-while lasts thy life-vigor’s fulness;\n\n’Twill after hap early, that illness or sword-edge\n\nShall part thee from strength, or the grasp of the fire,\n\nOr the wave of the current, or clutch of the edges,\n\nOr flight of the war-spear, or age with its horrors,\n\nOr thine eyes’ bright flashing shall fade into darkness:\n\n’Twill happen full early, excellent hero,\n\nThat death shall subdue thee. So the Danes a half-century\n\nI held under heaven, helped them in struggles\n\n’Gainst many a race in middle-earth’s regions,\n\nWith ash-wood and edges, that enemies none\n\nOn earth molested me. Lo! offsetting change, now,\n\nCame to my manor, grief after joyance,\n\nWhen Grendel became my constant visitor,\n\nInveterate hater: I from that malice\n\nContinually travailed with trouble no little.\n\nThanks be to God that I gained in my lifetime,\n\nTo the Lord everlasting, to look on the gory\n\nHead with mine eyes, after long-lasting sorrow!\n\nGo to the bench now, battle-adornèd\n\nJoy in the feasting: of jewels in common\n\nWe’ll meet with many when morning appeareth.”\n\nThe Geatman was gladsome, ganged he immediately\n\nTo go to the bench, as the clever one bade him.\n\nThen again as before were the famous-for-prowess,\n\nHall-inhabiters, handsomely banqueted,\n\nFeasted anew. The night-veil fell then\n\nDark o’er the warriors. The courtiers rose then;\n\nThe gray-haired was anxious to go to his slumbers,\n\nThe hoary old Scylding. Hankered the Geatman,\n\nThe champion doughty, greatly, to rest him:\n\nAn earlman early outward did lead him,\n\nFagged from his faring, from far-country springing,\n\nWho for etiquette’s sake all of a liegeman’s\n\nNeeds regarded, such as seamen at that time\n\nWere bounden to feel. The big-hearted rested;\n\nThe building uptowered, spacious and gilded,\n\nThe guest within slumbered, till the sable-clad raven\n\nBlithely foreboded the beacon of heaven.\n\nThen the bright-shining sun o’er the bottoms came going;\n\nThe warriors hastened, the heads of the peoples\n\nWere ready to go again to their peoples,\n\nThe high-mooded farer would faraway thenceward\n\nLook for his vessel. The valiant one bade then,\n\nOffspring of Ecglaf, off to bear Hrunting,\n\nTo take his weapon, his well-beloved iron;\n\nHe him thanked for the gift, saying good he accounted\n\nThe war-friend and mighty, nor chid he with words then\n\nThe blade of the brand: ’twas a brave-mooded hero.\n\nWhen the warriors were ready, arrayed in their trappings,\n\nThe atheling dear to the Danemen advanced then\n\nOn to the dais, where the other was sitting,\n\nGrim-mooded hero, greeted King Hrothgar.\n\nPart XXVII\n\nBeowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s offspring:\n\n“We men of the water wish to declare now\n\nFared from far-lands, we’re firmly determined\n\nTo seek King Higelac. Here have we fitly\n\nBeen welcomed and feasted, as heart would desire it;\n\nGood was the greeting. If greater affection\n\nI am anywise able ever on earth to\n\nGain at thy hands, ruler of heroes,\n\nThan yet I have done, I shall quickly be ready\n\nFor combat and conflict. O’er the course of the waters\n\nLearn I that neighbors alarm thee with terror,\n\nAs haters did whilom, I hither will bring thee\n\nFor help unto heroes henchmen by thousands.\n\nI know as to Higelac, the lord of the Geatmen,\n\nThough young in years, he yet will permit me,\n\nBy words and by works, ward of the people,\n\nFully to furnish thee forces and bear thee\n\nMy lance to relieve thee, if liegemen shall fail thee,\n\nAnd help of my hand-strength; if Hrethric be treating,\n\nBairn of the king, at the court of the Geatmen,\n\nHe thereat may find him friends in abundance:\n\nFaraway countries he were better to seek for\n\nWho trusts in himself.” Hrothgar discoursed then,\n\nMaking rejoinder: “These words thou hast uttered\n\nAll-knowing God hath given thy spirit!\n\nNe’er heard I an earlman thus early in life\n\nMore clever in speaking: thou’rt cautious of spirit,\n\nMighty of muscle, in mouth-answers prudent.\n\nI count on the hope that, happen it ever\n\nThat missile shall rob thee of Hrethel’s descendant,\n\nEdge-horrid battle, and illness or weapon\n\nDeprive thee of prince, of people’s protector,\n\nAnd life thou yet holdest, the Sea-Geats will never\n\nFind a more fitting folk-lord to choose them,\n\nGem-ward of heroes, than thou mightest prove thee,\n\nIf the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern.\n\nThy mood-spirit likes me the longer the better,\n\nBeowulf dear: thou hast brought it to pass that\n\nTo both these peoples peace shall be common,\n\nTo Geat-folk and Danemen, the strife be suspended,\n\nThe secret assailings they suffered in yore-days;\n\nAnd also that jewels be shared while I govern\n\nThe wide-stretching kingdom, and that many shall visit\n\nOthers o’er the ocean with excellent gift-gems:\n\nThe ring-adorned bark shall bring o’er the currents\n\nPresents and love-gifts. This people I know\n\nTow’rd foeman and friend firmly established,\n\nAfter ancient etiquette everywise blameless.”\n\nThen the warden of earlmen gave him still farther,\n\nKinsman of Healfdene, a dozen of jewels,\n\nBade him safely seek with the presents\n\nHis well-beloved people, early returning.\n\nThen the noble-born king kissed the distinguished,\n\nDear-lovèd liegeman, the Dane-prince saluted him,\n\nAnd claspèd his neck; tears from him fell,\n\nFrom the gray-headed man: he two things expected,\n\nAgèd and reverend, but rather the second,\n\nThat bold in council they’d meet thereafter.\n\nThe man was so dear that he failed to suppress the\n\nEmotions that moved him, but in mood-fetters fastened\n\nThe long-famous hero longeth in secret\n\nDeep in his spirit for the dear-beloved man\n\nThough not a blood-kinsman. Beowulf thenceward,\n\nGold-splendid warrior, walked o’er the meadows\n\nExulting in treasure: the sea-going vessel\n\nRiding at anchor awaited its owner.\n\nAs they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar\n\nWas frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that\n\nEveryway blameless, till age did debar him\n\nThe joys of his might, which hath many oft injured.\n\nPart XXVIII\n\nThen the band of very valiant retainers\n\nCame to the current; they were clad all in armor,\n\nIn link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed\n\nThe return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;\n\nNowise with insult he greeted the strangers\n\nFrom the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;\n\nSaid the bright-armored visitors vesselward traveled\n\nWelcome to Weders. The wide-bosomed craft then\n\nLay on the sand, laden with armor,\n\nWith horses and jewels, the ring-stemmèd sailer:\n\nThe mast uptowered o’er the treasure of Hrothgar.\n\nTo the boat-ward a gold-bound brand he presented,\n\nThat he was afterwards honored on the ale-bench more highly\n\nAs the heirloom’s owner. Set he out on his vessel,\n\nTo drive on the deep, Dane-country left he.\n\nAlong by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,\n\nA rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,\n\nThe wind o’er the waters the wave-floater nowise\n\nKept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,\n\nThe foamy-necked floated forth o’er the currents,\n\nThe well-fashioned vessel o’er the ways of the ocean,\n\nTill they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,\n\nThe well-known headlands. The wave-goer hastened\n\nDriven by breezes, stood on the shore.\n\nPrompt at the ocean, the port-ward was ready,\n\nWho long in the past outlooked in the distance,\n\nAt water’s-edge waiting well-lovèd heroes;\n\nHe bound to the bank then the broad-bosomed vessel\n\nFast in its fetters, lest the force of the waters\n\nShould be able to injure the ocean-wood winsome.\n\nBade he up then take the treasure of princes,\n\nPlate-gold and fretwork; not far was it thence\n\nTo go off in search of the giver of jewels:\n\nHrethel’s son Higelac at home there remaineth,\n\nHimself with his comrades close to the sea-coast.\n\nThe building was splendid, the king heroic,\n\nGreat in his hall, Hygd very young was,\n\nFine-mooded, clever, though few were the winters\n\nThat the daughter of Hæreth had dwelt in the borough;\n\nBut she nowise was cringing nor niggard of presents,\n\nOf ornaments rare, to the race of the Geatmen.\n\nThrytho nursed anger, excellent folk-queen,\n\nHot-burning hatred: no hero whatever\n\n’Mong household companions, her husband excepted\n\nDared to adventure to look at the woman\n\nWith eyes in the daytime; but he knew that death-chains\n\nHand-wreathed were wrought him: early thereafter,\n\nWhen the hand-strife was over, edges were ready,\n\nThat fierce-raging sword-point had to force a decision,\n\nMurder-bale show. Such no womanly custom\n\nFor a lady to practise, though lovely her person,\n\nThat a weaver-of-peace, on pretence of anger\n\nA belovèd liegeman of life should deprive.\n\nSoothly this hindered Heming’s kinsman;\n\nOther ale-drinking earlmen asserted\n\nThat fearful folk-sorrows fewer she wrought them,\n\nTreacherous doings, since first she was given\n\nAdorned with gold to the war-hero youthful,\n\nFor her origin honored, when Offa’s great palace\n\nO’er the fallow flood by her father’s instructions\n\nShe sought on her journey, where she afterwards fully,\n\nFamed for her virtue, her fate on the king’s-seat\n\nEnjoyed in her lifetime, love did she hold with\n\nThe ruler of heroes, the best, it is told me,\n\nOf all of the earthmen that oceans encompass,\n\nOf earl-kindreds endless; hence Offa was famous\n\nFar and widely, by gifts and by battles,\n\nSpear-valiant hero; the home of his fathers\n\nHe governed with wisdom, whence Eomær did issue\n\nFor help unto heroes, Heming’s kinsman,\n\nGrandson of Garmund, great in encounters.\n\nPart XXIX\n\nThen the brave one departed, his band along with him,\n\nSeeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,\n\nThe wide-stretching shores. The world-candle glimmered,\n\nThe sun from the southward; they proceeded then onward,\n\nEarly arriving where they heard that the troop-lord,\n\nOngentheow’s slayer, excellent, youthful\n\nFolk-prince and warrior was distributing jewels,\n\nClose in his castle. The coming of Beowulf\n\nWas announced in a message quickly to Higelac,\n\nThat the folk-troop’s defender forth to the palace\n\nThe linden-companion alive was advancing,\n\nSecure from the combat courtward a-going.\n\nThe building was early inward made ready\n\nFor the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.\n\nHe sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle,\n\nKinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people\n\nHad in lordly language saluted the dear one,\n\nIn words that were formal. The daughter of Hæreth\n\nCoursed through the building, carrying mead-cups:\n\nShe loved the retainers, tendered the beakers\n\nTo the high-minded Geatmen. Higelac ’gan then\n\nPleasantly plying his companion with questions\n\nIn the high-towering palace. A curious interest\n\nTormented his spirit, what meaning to see in\n\nThe Sea-Geats’ adventures: “Beowulf worthy,\n\nHow throve your journeying, when thou thoughtest suddenly\n\nFar o’er the salt-streams to seek an encounter,\n\nA battle at Heorot? Hast bettered for Hrothgar,\n\nThe famous folk-leader, his far-published sorrows\n\nAny at all? In agony-billows\n\nI mused upon torture, distrusted the journey\n\nOf the belovèd liegeman; I long time did pray thee\n\nBy no means to seek out the murderous spirit,\n\nTo suffer the South-Danes themselves to decide on\n\nGrappling with Grendel. To God I am thankful\n\nTo be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey.”\n\nBeowulf answered, bairn of old Ecgtheow:\n\n“’Tis hidden by no means, Higelac chieftain,\n\nFrom many of men, the meeting so famous,\n\nWhat mournful moments of me and of Grendel\n\nWere passed in the place where he pressing affliction\n\nOn the Victory-Scyldings scathefully brought,\n\nAnguish forever; that all I avengèd,\n\nSo that any under heaven of the kinsmen of Grendel\n\nNeedeth not boast of that cry-in-the-morning,\n\nWho longest liveth of the loth-going kindred,\n\nEncompassed by moorland. I came in my journey\n\nTo the royal ring-hall, Hrothgar to greet there:\n\nSoon did the famous scion of Healfdene,\n\nWhen he understood fully the spirit that led me,\n\nAssign me a seat with the son of his bosom.\n\nThe troop was in joyance; mead-glee greater\n\n’Neath arch of the ether not ever beheld I\n\n’Mid hall-building holders. The highly-famed queen,\n\nPeace-tie of peoples, oft passed through the building,\n\nCheered the young troopers; she oft tendered a hero\n\nA beautiful ring-band, ere she went to her sitting.\n\nOft the daughter of Hrothgar in view of the courtiers\n\nTo the earls at the end the ale-vessel carried,\n\nWhom Freaware I heard then hall-sitters title,\n\nWhen nail-adorned jewels she gave to the heroes:\n\nGold-bedecked, youthful, to the glad son of Froda\n\nHer faith has been plighted; the friend of the Scyldings,\n\nThe guard of the kingdom, hath given his sanction,\n\nAnd counts it a vantage, for a part of the quarrels,\n\nA portion of hatred, to pay with the woman.\n\nSomewhere not rarely, when the ruler has fallen,\n\nThe life-taking lance relaxeth its fury\n\nFor a brief breathing-spell, though the bride be charming!\n\nPart XXX\n\n“It well may discomfit the prince of the Heathobards\n\nAnd each of the thanemen of earls that attend him,\n\nWhen he goes to the building escorting the woman,\n\nThat a noble-born Daneman the knights should be feasting:\n\nThere gleam on his person the leavings of elders\n\nHard and ring-bright, Heathobards’ treasure,\n\nWhile they wielded their arms, till they misled to the battle\n\nTheir own dear lives and belovèd companions.\n\nHe saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth,\n\nAn ancient ash-warrior who earlmen’s destruction\n\nClearly recalleth (cruel his spirit),\n\nSadly beginneth sounding the youthful\n\nThane-champion’s spirit through the thoughts of his bosom,\n\nWar-grief to waken, and this word-answer speaketh:\n\n‘Art thou able, my friend, to know when thou seest it\n\nThe brand which thy father bare to the conflict\n\nIn his latest adventure, ’neath visor of helmet,\n\nThe dearly-loved iron, where Danemen did slay him,\n\nAnd brave-mooded Scyldings, on the fall of the heroes,\n\n(When vengeance was sleeping) the slaughter-place wielded?\n\nE’en now some man of the murderer’s progeny\n\nExulting in ornaments enters the building,\n\nBoasts of his blood-shedding, offbeareth the jewel\n\nWhich thou shouldst wholly hold in possession!’\n\nSo he urgeth and mindeth on every occasion\n\nWith woe-bringing words, till waxeth the season\n\nWhen the woman’s thane for the works of his father,\n\nThe bill having bitten, blood-gory sleepeth,\n\nFated to perish; the other one thenceward\n\n’Scapeth alive, the land knoweth thoroughly.\n\nThen the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken,\n\nWhen rancors unresting are raging in Ingeld\n\nAnd his wife-love waxeth less warm after sorrow.\n\nSo the Heathobards’ favor not faithful I reckon,\n\nTheir part in the treaty not true to the Danemen,\n\nTheir friendship not fast. I further shall tell thee\n\nMore about Grendel, that thou fully mayst hear,\n\nOrnament-giver, what afterward came from\n\nThe hand-rush of heroes.
