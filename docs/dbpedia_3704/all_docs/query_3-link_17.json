        "text": "There are 3 viable options:\n\nDisqualify him from inheritance/holding titles, by making him a monk.\n\nChange your succession laws, so the oldest child can't inherit (Elective, Elective Gavelkind, Ultimogeniture, Seniority.\n\nKill (Imprison/Execute) him or blind/castrate him (If Greek)\n\nYou could also give titles to your prefered son, so you won't trigger an immediate game-over if the non-dynastic son inherits your main title, and then, after you die, (the new) you can just press his claim.\n\nMaking your son a Commander and sending him into losing battles may also work out nicely. You could also use the Intrigue Focus to spy on him, and imprison/have him killed without plotting. Same for Martial Focus and Dueling if you're capable.\n\nThere are a couple of ways not yet mentioned in Oak's answer (pre question edit though):\n\n1) Excommunication.\n\nIf your child is not in good standings with the Pope or you have some variety of PocketPope, you can ask for him to be excommunicated. At that point you can freely imprison them and either execute (no penalty), or order to take the vows (disqualifying from succession). If they are not in your court anymore, you can still start an excommunication war.\n\n2) Entrapment.\n\nGive your child some land and make him rebel against you. This is easiest done by waiting 5-10 years until title grant opinion bonus has disappeared and then doing something nasty to them - like revoking a title, giving the jester title, or simply uncovering a plot on them with your spymaster (if you were the same sex or you were homosexual you could also try to seduce their spouse). You could do this immediately as well, but in that case you will almost certainly anger your other vassals as well, because of the sheer amount of opinion bonus you need to burn. Once they rebel, they are fair game to imprison and then, well... bad things can happen in dark dungeons. Not all of them allow you to take up the throne afterwards."
