        "text": "83 Jonathan Swift: Gulliver’s Travels\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Jena Jordan, Aalmin Kadiwal and Elisa Escalera\n\nGulliver’s Travels, written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift, is a satire that explores the theme of human nature framed by a fictional traveler’s account (this being very popular genre at the time). It follows a protagonist, Lemuel Gulliver, who is the narrator; he explains a bit about his life as a preamble and informs readers that he is a married surgeon from Nottinghamshire, England who loves traveling. As it turns out, “He works as a surgeon on ships and ends up becoming a ship captain…Through many unfortunate events during his voyage at sea, Gulliver becomes stranded in foreign lands and absurd situations, whether it’s getting captured by the miniature Lilliputians or becoming friends with talking horses, the Houyhnhnms” (Naik). This work remains popular with adults and children alike who are drawn to the multiple ways it can be read: as an allegorical tale of fantastic creatures or as a deeper political commentary on the darker side of human nature.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nJonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland on November 30, 1667. His father passed away shortly after he was conceived and, upon his birth, his mother struggled to provide for him financially. For this reason, he was sent to live with an uncle who enrolled him at what was considered the best grammar school in Ireland at the time, the Kilkenny school. At the age of fourteen, in 1682, Swift entered Trinity College in Dublin. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to pursue a master ‘s degree as well.\n\nPolitical upheaval, however, interrupted his graduate education in the form of the Glorious Revolution and the overthrowing of the king. These events led Swift to travel to England where he found an assistant’s position working for Sir William Temple. He worked as his assistant for ten years until Temple died in 1699. During his time with Temple, Swift traveled to Dublin where he was ordained, reluctantly accepting an official position in the church. In the meantime, he also began to follow his true passion: writing. In 1710, he was asked to write for the official paper for the Tories the Examiner, and became consumed by the politics of his era (“Jonathan Swift Biography”). In Gulliver’s Travels, Swift writes about a rivalry between political groups of Lilliputians who argue over the importance of a low or high heeled shoe. Many believe these petty squabbles exemplify the rivalry between the Whigs and Tories (Bauer and Reid). After the Tories lost power, Swift became Dean of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin in 1713 (Bauer and Reid). Though a man of the church, Swift had previously written critically of the institution, which speaks to his ability to see perspectives beyond personal bias (William and O’Connor). As a man with English parents, born and raised in Ireland, employed in England, Swift was able to experience the life of both an “insider” and “outsider’ throughout his career, which may be mirrored in the fictious adventures of Gulliver himself. He went on to write many works under various pseudonyms until he suffered a stroke in 1742. Three years later, in 1745, he passed away and was buried at St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Dublin.\n\nSummary\n\nPart I\n\nGulliver’s Travels, or Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships begins by depicting Lemuel Gulliver’s poor upbringing. Gulliver takes an apprenticeship with a surgeon due to his family’s inability to pay for his education. The surgeon shares his knowledge with Gulliver giving him the information he would need to begin his journey and solidify his career. Gulliver marries a woman named Mary and begins a practice in London. His practice, however, dwindles with the death of his master, Mr. Bates. Gulliver then sets out to sea aboard the Antelope. The Antelope is felled by the sea and Gulliver swims to the nearest shore where he falls asleep in the grass. He awakens to discover he is completely bound, held captive by a group of tiny people called the Lilliputians. They take care of his needs but refuse to grant him freedom. A fire catches in the bedroom of the emperor’s wife causing Gulliver to douse the fire with the only liquid available: his urine. This results in Gulliver being accused of treason which carries a severe punishment. He requests aid from the people of Blefuscu, a neighboring empire currently warring with the little Lilliputians over the proper method for cracking an egg. He seeks their help in hopes of returning home to England. They help him acquire and repair a boat he found while wandering on the coast of their shores. He is able to return home.\n\nPart II\n\nDespite the harrowing journey he just returned from, Gulliver’s stay in London is brief and he sets out again aboard a vessel named Adventure. The ship is thrown off course after an encounter with a monsoon. He lands on an island and is abandoned by his shipmates. He then spots the brutish Brobdingnagians and they, soon after, discover him as well. He is treated as a novelty by the Brobdingnagians whose giant size makes him powerless to their whims. He is taken care of by the nine-year-old daughter of the farmer who discovered him. After becoming ill one day, he is left alone in his box. An eagle picks up his box, with him inside, and flies away with it. The eagle drops the box and Gulliver into the ocean where he is discovered by a ship of people his own size. When Gulliver attempts to explain his circumstances to the ship captain the captain believes him to be in great distress. Fortunately, Gulliver is able to provide support for his explanation by way of items he’s stored in his box. He eventually returns to London where he parts with the captain. On his journey home, he is disoriented by the change in perspective from his time with the Brobdingnagians and overestimates his own size in comparison to the minuscule world around him. His perspective is so altered but what became his norm that he fails to see his daughter when greeted by her. His perspective slowly returns as time passes. His wife is insistent that he should not leave again but the Gulliver leaves no doubt that his journeys are concluded only for the time being.\n\nPart III\n\nIn part three, Gulliver sets sail again and is rescued by a floating Island named “Laputa” after his ship was attacked by pirates and he was left stranded. This island is devoted to the arts and sciences including mathematics, astronomy and music though, he quickly learns that they are only theoretical in their pastimes and are unable to realize practical gains from their endeavors. For example, Laputian society despises practical geometry, and wants no right angles in their architecture even as they are obsessed with mathematics; as a result, their homes are poorly built. He then learns that Laputa hovers above a second island called Balnibarbi and, already bored with the Laputians, Gulliver journeys there and then onto its capital, Lagado, to visit the “Grand Academy.” The Grand Academy of Lagado is filled with scientists making projects which are completely useless and serve no purpose to society, such as attempts to extract sunlight from cucumbers or gunpowder from ice. This “Academy” is a not-so-veiled reference to the Age Enlightenment and the Royal Society formed by philosophical leaders and inventors that was quite influential in Swift’s time. He further visits a part of the Academy devoted to “political projectors” in which he finds professors debating the merits of uncovering anti-government conspiracy by “examin[ing] into the diet” through the analysis of excrement for color, odor and taste. Tired of these “wholly out of their senses” professors, Gulliver continues on with a quick stop to Glubbdubdrib, or the island of “sorcerers or magicians”; there he spends a great deal of time talking to the ghosts of Caesar, Descartes, Homer and Aristotle. Determined to visit Japan, Gulliver disguises himself as a Dutchman (the Dutch being the only European nation admitted to Japan), and is caught in the act en route and imprisoned. While in Luggnagg, he learns about the Struldbrug children who are immortal; he imagines that this would be a great thing but, in reality, they have eternal youth but suffer the ailments of the old and so are depressed about their state. He is eventually given passage to Japan where the Empower insists he trample on a crucifix; he manages to sidestep this challenge and returns to England via Amsterdam.\n\nPart IV\n\nIn Part four, the narrator has stayed at home for five months but is itching to sail the seas again; he does this, leaving his pregnant wife behind and commanding his own ship. It isn’t long before his men conduct a mutiny and threaten to murder him; these would-be pirates end up dropping him off on an unknown island and continuing on their way . He travels circumspectly through the countryside and comes upon a gathering of creatures that fill him with “contempt and aversion” –these, we come to find out are “Yahoos” and they are human creatures who behave more like cattle. One of the Yahoos confronts Gulliver who bats him back which arouses the rest of the clan to surround him; he is suddenly rescued by a pack of horses who seem to be speaking their own language. These horses, who he learns are called Houyhnhnms, are “so orderly and rational, so acute and judicious.” One of the horses leads Gulliver back to his home; it quickly becomes obvious that the horse has no master and is, in fact, master of his own house. After deliberating with his wife, the horse stands Gulliver next to another Yahoo and finds them the same but for the fact that Gulliver is clothed. Rather than becoming eager to leave this island, Gulliver finds himself happy to stay, and he quickly adapts to the Houyhnhnms’ lifestyle, language, and knowledge. Through this, Gulliver informs the horses about life in England: how horses are controlled by “Yahoos,” how lying works and the systems of government, as well as the ways Yahoos go to war against each other. All of these explanations seem to baffle the Houynhnhnms. Since Gulliver spent a good time with the Houyhnhnms, he realizes that the real humans, the Yahoos, are what he despises. He longs to stay but the Houyhnhnms fear he may lead a Yahoo insurrection so he is compelled to set sail again. Gulliver is resentful of going back, and when he does, he realizes he does not want to be around his own wife and child because they remind him of the Yahoos. Gulliver buys some horses who he talks to in the stables for several hours each day. In this part, Swift mocks human nature and human civilization. His analysis of the “Yahoos” and their selfish, immortal nature is plain to see in contrast to the Houyhnhnms who are far more noble, logical and kind.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBauer, Patricia and Reid, Cregan Vybarr. “Gulliver’s Travels.” Encyclopedia Britannica. 15 Nov. 2018.

The emperor’s person and habit described. Learned men appointed to teach the author their language. He gains favour by his mild disposition. His pockets are searched, and his sword and pistols taken from him.\n\nWhen I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I never beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country around appeared like a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers. These fields were intermingled with woods of half a stang, and the tallest trees, as I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I viewed the town on my left hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\n\nI had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last disburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame. The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my house, which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went as far as the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my body of that uneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business in open air, at the full extent of my chain; and due care was taken every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be carried off in wheel-barrows, by two servants appointed for that purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance that, perhaps, at first sight, may appear not very momentous, if I had not thought it necessary to justify my character, in point of cleanliness, to the world; which, I am told, some of my maligners have been pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question. When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house, having occasion for fresh air.\n\nThe emperor was already descended from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up on its hinder feet: but that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran in, and held the bridle, while his majesty had time to dismount.\n\nWhen he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration; but kept beyond the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels, till I could reach them. I took these vehicles and soon emptied them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful, and his deportment majestic. He was then past his prime, being twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he had reigned about seven in great felicity, and generally victorious. For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the description.\n\nHis dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate; and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up.\n\nThe ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread upon the ground, embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His imperial majesty spoke often to me, and I returned answers: but neither of us could understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers present (as I conjectured by their habits), who were commanded to address themselves to me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca, but all to no purpose.\n\nAfter about two hours the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach. I took them all in my right hand, put five of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court.\n\nTowards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth stone. By the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to hardships.\n\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me should return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house, without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state got considerable fees.\n\nIn the meantime the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the whole kingdom.\n\nIn the midst of these consultations, several officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and two of them being admitted, gave an account of my behaviour to the six criminals above-mentioned; which made so favourable an impression in the breast of his majesty and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial commission was issued out, obliging all the villages, nine hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of which, his majesty gave assignments upon his treasury:—for this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes; seldom, except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own expense. An establishment was also made of six hundred persons to be my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door.\n\nIt was likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language; and lastly, that the emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to me.\n\nAll these orders were duly put in execution; and in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language; during which time the emperor frequently honoured me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and the first words I learnt, were to express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which I every day repeated on my knees. His answer, as I could comprehend it, was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that first I must lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with all kindness. And he advised me to “acquire, by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and his subjects.”\n\nHe desired “I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the bulk of so prodigious a person.” I said, “His majesty should be satisfied; for I was ready to strip myself, and turn up my pockets before him.” This I delivered part in words, and part in signs.\n\nHe replied, “that, by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me, should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them.” I took up the two officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a purse.\n\nThese gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper, about them, made an exact inventory of every thing they saw; and when they had done, desired I would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor. This inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is, word for word, as follows:\n\n“Imprimis: In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain” (for so I interpret the words quinbus flestrin,) “after the strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse-cloth, large enough to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we, the searchers, were not able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces set us both a sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the pallisados before your majesty’s court: wherewith we conjecture the man-mountain combs his head; for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket, on the right side of his middle cover” (so I translate the word ranfulo, by which they meant my breeches,) “we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine of the same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the other there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was at the end of that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal; for, on the transparent side, we saw certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them, till we found our fingers stopped by the lucid substance. He put this engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that of a water-mill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did any thing without consulting it. He called it his oracle, and said, it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value.\n\n“Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands, diligently searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your majesty’s subjects. In one of these cells were several globes, or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\n\n“This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to your majesty’s commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s auspicious reign.\n\nClefrin Frelock, Marsi Frelock.”\n\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me, although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.\n\nHe first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In the mean time he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then attended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was, in most parts, exceeding bright. I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect: he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end of my chain.\n\nThe next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to escape wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to provide,) I first cautioned the emperor not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air.\n\nThe astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself for some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him that the former might be kept from fire, for it would kindle with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air.\n\nI likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very curious to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more acute than ours: he asked the opinions of his learned men about it, which were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not very perfectly understand them.\n\nI then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse, with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and journal-book. My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in carriages to his majesty’s stores; but the rest of my goods were returned me.\n\nI had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for the weakness of my eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession."
