        "text": "Jan 29th 2024 - Vinny vs Mary turns into CG vs the Guild/Mosley’s\n\nMary Mushkin and the Guild hired Hydra, to kidnap Joseph Arrowhead and bring him to her. They cut off his pinky after killing him. After a few weeks, Vinny got a few calls from Yaeger, threatening him, upon which Vinny goaded him. After Mr. K woke up, Vinny called to speak with him as soon as possible. At the meeting, Vinny explained the situation, where Mary and the Guild were targeting Popular and Arrowhead regularly to cause problems for their shop. Mr. K agreed to help Vinny for a hefty payment of $20,000 to teach Mary a lesson, so they got started, Mr. K and Ramee hid outside Mosleys repair shop to surveil it. They eventually resorted to burning down Mary's home. They sent the picture to Irwin Dundee, who posted it to Twatter, telling all of them, \"Dundee did this.\" While watching the house, Mr. K and Ramee spotted Yaeger and tried to hold him up. When Mr. K did so, he was ambushed by five others in Yaeger’s group and downed. They planted the gun on him. When the cops arrived on scene, they checked him for gunshot residue, and came back negative. They then proceeded to frisk him, and found the gun. He was then taken to MRPD, and while they turned him loose for some time, Captains Leonardo Slacks and Brooke Ruth, and Mr. Karen and Ramee met outside and had a few arguments over conduct. After leaving MRPD, Mr. K got the gang together, and told them that he was out for blood for The Guild and Mary Mushkin, and they should target them whenever they saw them.\n\nHe was later arrested and put to a bench trial. He was sentenced to some months in prison at Bolingbroke Penitentiary, but was able to bargain for an enclave from the city, which he dubbed ‘K-town’. He set up a Prison Bus Blockade to prevent all entry from PD. He eventually opened it up to host Maximilian Thoroughbred and Siobhan Fitzpatrick’s wedding on January 30, 2024, presided over by Alan Crane. After the wedding, he was chased while driving a bus by Leo Slacks, and was eventually caught after getting blocked by other buses driven by PD, hence ending the first ever vehicle PD chase inside the prison.\n\nFebuary 1st 2024 - K's Vengeance continues\n\nMr K woke up, and was immediately on the warpath again; After doing his daily chores of collecting rent; K eventually got a call from Vinny, that he was talking to a cop about a report against people attacking Popular; Vinny told K that Slacks was at popular (no one else heard), to which K hung up, and immediately headed to the repair shop fully disguised. After smashing Slacks' car when he arrived, he walked up to the Popular office and intimidated everyone there; no one recognized him (Vinny did not acknowledge that he knew who it was), he then \"left\"\n\nInstead of leaving, K jumped into Slacks' trunk secretly, he stayed hidden for a number of minutes until Slacks was alone and parked; He jumped out and shot him in the head 4 times, then ran away. Slacks was taken to teh hospital, where he was repaired; he had a face full of bandages, and was walking with a Cane. The police found Dundee's blood on scene (likely from a prior event); but have no evidence of Mr Ks involvement.\n\nAfter meeting up with Ramee; they proceed to mess around with Den and Cornwood, who are the only 2 patrolling officers; after some chases, they attempt to set them up at the Wind Turbine field, Den and Cornwood did not take the bait; and instead stayed in the city. Eventually, Cornwood got annoyed that they were the only patrolling officers; he went off-duty, and proceeded to run into Juno outside of MRPD. Cornwood spoke his thoughts about how PD is failing, who should be the COP (turner), there should be 1 captain (slacks), and Ruth should be immediately fired; he particularly mentioned that PD is in shambles, and is on the verge of total collapse; Juno was less than pleased, and was slamming her steering wheel.\n\nMr K and Ramee end up meeting up with X and Benji, and they proceed to form a plan to have 2 cops come up north, and shoot and rob them. They eventually succeeded; having 2 cops come up North, one being Frost (who is on Mr Ks list). Benji was being bait at the scene, after a few moments, X runs up to try and stab the cops; after failing, K stands up and shoots both cops down instantly; X and Benji rob them and they successfully escape. The police found Benji's DNA on scene, as well as the bullet casings, but no other DNA linking others to the crime.\n\nAt one point, Ramee and K find themselves outside City Hall speaking to Juno; After again reiterating a lot of what Cornwood spoke to her about earlier, Juno was extremely mad, she was going to immediately go talk to the Mayor (max); as well as Nekoda and other council members about finding a way to hold PD accountable and attempt to fix the problem occuring.\n\nRamee, and K, meet up with X again, as well as Cornwood; they have a full blown ERP session to lighten the mood and enjoy the rest of the evening before bed.\n\nDuring the week, Richard stalked Yeager and was downed multiple times, Ramee and Yeagar shanked each other at the hospital, Ramee knocked out Yeager at Legion square park, and multiple Mosley employees were killed.\n\nFebuary 5th 2024 - The War comes to and End\n\nAfter a week of hiding and back and forth, Yeager got tired of it and offered Mr.K anything to end it. Mr.K asked for 50k towards a Buffalo STX, to which Yeager was hesitant and made a counter offer of 30k. Mr.K remained firm on 50k however, and Yaeger relented by using all his 30k and getting the rest from Mary. Right after this deal was agreed to, Ramee ran over Yeager one last time as he was unaware of the situation, and Mr.K rolled up to take him to the hospital.\n\nMar 7th 2024 - CG rob 10F Terry\n\nRamee, JP and Taco pulled up to the hospital and spotted Terry Linkston in his 10F. Seeing Terry, Ramee started joking around with Terry, who he calls 10F Terry, and in doing so took 1500 jewellry parts out of his car before putting them back. However, when Ramee went into the hospital, he radioed Jean Paul and Taco telling them that Terry had jewellry in his car and to take it if they wanted to. Not really knowing who Terry was, Taco stole the jewels in front of Terry and put them into his own car before eventually driving away with JP. Terry thinking it was originally a joke asked for them back but once Taco and JP refused he realised he had been robbed. Terry then proceeded to follow the car to the Pawnshop where Taco and JP again refused to give the jewels back. Eventually Terry followed them to a gas station and again asked for the jewels back. Annoyed by Terry's persistence, Taco held Terry up with a gun and stole his car. Taco later returned the car to Grove Street undamaged.\n\nAs Terry realized he was not getting his jewels back, he started to call some other members of CG in hopes of sorting out the issue. He first called Ramee, who pretended that he had no involvement in the incident and asserted repeatedly that it was nothing to do with him, and that Terry should sort it out with JP and Taco. Terry then decided to call Mr. K, who was at this point running K-Town in Prison. On the phone, Mr K. came across disinterested in finding a resolution but said he would call Terry back once he had looked into it. Mr. K never ended up reaching out and at this point, Terry and the Manor came to the conclusion that CG did not respect them at all and and that they could not keep ignoring the robberies and disrespect they were showing them. After hearing about the incident, Sparky Kane decided that the Manor would go after Taco. The original plan was to catch Taco on his own, not harm him, but rob him for whatever he had on him, hopefully a gun.\n\nOn March 10th, after seeing that Taco had been selling lockpicks the past couple days, Matt, Ste, James, Terry, Kenny and Ricky devised a plan in which Matt would meet Taco to buy a lockpick, and then they would all swoop in and rob him. Unfortunately, due to miscommunication, the initial attempt to rob Taco failed as Matt's deal for the lockpick was completed before the others had time to set up. However, during the deal, Matt had heard that Taco and the group he was with were headed to the meat processing facility as they had just been hunting. The Manor therefore decided to lay an ambush for the group as they came out the facility. Ste and James were positioned on the highway above with the guns, and the rest swarmed in to hold CG up as they left the facility. Unfortunately, as Terry tried to hold up Taco, Vinny pulled out his gun. Ste and James seeing this shot Vinny down and as a result all hell broke loose. In the chaos, Ste shot Peanut and Terry hit Taco with a wrench. As Terry was moving Taco to rob him, Hazel then came up behind them and knocked him and Kenny out, after which Ste and James shot her down. Zolo, who hid as soon as the ambush started, then came back and hit Ricky, before again being shot down by STE. After escaping from the cops, with the majority of the bodies the Manor robbed 3 guns from Peanut, Taco and Vinny.\n\nAfter everyone had received treatment at the Hospital, Vinny, Taco, Zaceed and Peanut had a meeting with Terry, Ste, James and Matt to talk about the situation and how to resolve it. In the meeting, Taco said that during the initial robbery he had no idea who Terry was, but revealed that it was Ramee that had told him to rob him, so he did. After some back and forth, Vinny and Taco offered to end it there and then by returning Terry's jewels in trade for getting the guns back. Unsure about what to do and another retaliation, the Manor refused the terms and said they would not return anything until Mr. K and Sparky had met the next day to talk about it.\n\nK got told about the CG and Manor conflict and he ran into Matt at the Fleeca bank and held him up. SK arrived at the bank and asked to have a talk later but K wanted it then and there. Vinny walked into the bank, which gave SK the chance to hold him up and gain leverage. K agreed to let Matt go and have a talk later, if Vinny is let go, so both sides walked away.\n\nA group meeting between Chang Gang and the Manor was held in the centre of Grove Street. After a lengthy back and forth between Mr K. and Sparky, Sparky made it clear that he would not be returning the guns as he was unable to trust the word of CG following the spate of robberies and other incidents. Angered by this, Mr K stabbed Sparky and the other 10 Chang Gang members present managed to take down the 6 Manor members (Sparky Kane, Terry Linkston, Matthew Antov, James Malding, Gigi Costello, and Ricky Lafleur). On the orders of Mr K., the downed Manor members were loaded into the back of their vehicles and taken to the Oil Fields. Mr K. then informed Sparky and the others that they were in possession of 4 PD Glocks and were intending to plant them on their bodies if they did not now come to a compromise. Having spoken to Solomon Walker earlier on in the day, Sparky knew the legislation was worded in a way that would almost certainly lead to successful charges of upwards of 100k and a raid of their main property, which was in Sparky's name. After consulting with the others, he realised that this plant would also result in them losing the 3 guns they stole anyway, as they were carelessly stashed in some of their apartments. Strong-armed by Mr K., Sparky eventually agreed to return the 3 firearms in trade for the original jewels stolen from Terry as well as assurances from Mr. K himself that none of CG would rob members of the Manor or continue the conflict, and that they would look to strengthen their relationships. Mr K. also offered reduced rates on Magazines, Ammo and Lockpicks, whether for the intents of purchase or re-sale.\n\nMar 18th 2024 - Tensions with Lang Buddha\n\nOn the 9th of March, Lang protects Santana while Chris King is at the yard. Lang makes fun of his blue hair, calls him Ninja. Chris calls Lang Mr. Miyagi, and drives off. Lang wants to rob Chris, but Santana tells him that Luci and others have robbed him before.\n\nMarch 18th-\n\nLang and Luci spot Larry outside Aunties house, they pulled up. Larry, Jamal, Chris King and a few other people were at the house, Lang talked shit to Chris, Chris talked shit back, Lang said he's gonna shoot him, left to get a gun, came back and shot him.\n\nRamee arrived before Lang and pressed Lang for shooting Chris, not understanding that there was context missing. Lang survived a swing, but Luci went down in the scuffle. Lang left in Kaz's car, but bled out by the MP house, where Harry eventually arrived and picked them up. Harry waits with Lang and Luci to call doctors they know, but nobody seems to be awake. Lang doesn't want to rush to the hospital incase CG or the cops are there, especially since he's GSR positive.\n\nThey finally go to the hospital, get patched up, and head back to the MP house. Lang says he would never let a person like Chris King talk shit to him without him doing something about it.\n\nK calls and asks for Lang's story, Lang gives the minor details and repeats the fact that he didn't know Chris King was with CG, but he wouldn't back down from a 'no-balls'. Lang tells the boys again, before heading to bed.\n\nThe next day, K calls Lang to meet, Lang calls up Harry, Luci, and Arush for the meeting. Lang and Harry head over to the meeting with K at the Cypress spot.\n\nK asks Lang about what happened, saying that Chris wouldn't have been shot if CG was there - the same goes for his group. Lang argues that CG shoots everyone in Lang's crew, K pops the trunk and threatens a kidnapped sanitation worker (Ash), and threatens that Harry might lose a knee cap. Lang says that he'll shoot Chris again, he has no issue with it. K turns the conversation towards material prices, asking Lang if he would consider lowering the price. Lang doesn't think anyone will work sanitation anymore if they lower the buying price, K takes the sock out of Ash's mouth and she confirms what Lang is saying.\n\nK gets a full break down of sanitation, K asks Lang to team up so they can lower the price. Lang says that his workers aren't around as much after being robbed everyday, and the other jobs in the city pay more now. K asks Harry what he wanted to talk about the other day, but Harry says it's unrelated so he wants to do it another time. K asks Lang if they're moving guns and extendos, but Lang tells him Tony lost one they got from Polish gang. K circles the meeting back around to respect and materials, and offers enforcement on the price if they drop it.\n\nLang and K shake hands, K hands off Ash, and everyone leaves.\n\nLater in the day, K calls back with a complete plan to hit other jobs to drive people back to sanitation, which should help lower the price back down. Lang says he'll talk to his people.\n\nMarch 27th-\n\nCG kidnap Luci, Vito, Tommy, and Alfredo while they are doing sanitation and take them to the airport docks.\n\nMarch 28th-\n\nLang and Mr.K go at it on twatter, after Taco tweeted buying 6 for and Lang bumped it with 7 per.\n\nMarch 29th-\n\nMr.K and Lang go at it again on twatter, with K trolling Lang saying he got a sanitation business approvedd, lang saying imitation is a form of flattery, and K responding with \"I am the blueprint\".\n\nApril 1st-\n\nRamee and Mr.K run into Lang and Luciano in their black van infront of Legion Square Bank. They proceed to taunt him by clutching their ballsack and making slapping sounds.\n\nApril 10th-\n\nMr.K threatens Lang after he threatens Kermy for selling materials for $4 per.\n\nApril 24th-\n\nMartin radios in that he was robbed by Peanut at the Mirror Park gas station, Martin follows them and gives comms that Peanut's car got stuck heading into the canals. Lang and Tony head over, but Lang waits for more back up. Martin aggresses with his vehicle, but they shoot at his car. Lang hops out of his car and tries to find an angle, but stumbles after getting shot and goes down. Tony hides with Lang behind the car for cover, and shoots at someone, losing the fight and going down. Peanut and CG rob Lang and Tony of their guns and money, Luciano arrives and takes out two people, but goes down in the car. Martin intervenes and bumps the CG vehicles. Cops chase CG as Vito arrives and confirms that Lang and Tony are down. The cops GSR test Lang, Tony and Martin who are downed, as well as the other CG members that are there. They deal with local scuff, so they move to a triage in the casino parking lot. The cops finally take everyone to the hospital to recover. Officer Shiesty takes Lang's statement: He was shot and robbed by Peanut and his hench-people, they stole his legal gun, 11k in cash, and magazines. Lang wants to press charges on every single person involved. Martin arrives and adds to the statement providing Peanut's legal name and stating that he was 'mistaken for the mayor'. The officers let them leave, Martin confirms that he lost the original 21k for the money run. Mary shows up after the police leave and find Luci in the car, Clark circles back and they hand Luci off for Clarke to take him to the hospital. Lang heads over to talk to the cops about his gun, but a suspect in one of the cars interrupts them and shit talks Lang. Luci and Clark arrive, but they enter the hospital. Lang waits for them outside, Yuno drives by, K and Ramee hold up Lang and tell him to get in Zaceed's car. Saleem is with CG, but Luciano shoots Ramee. Luci and Clark shoot at CG, Lang runs back to the police screaming for help. Flash gets killed and Zaceed kills Luciano. Arush arrives and Lang tells him to take out CG. Zaceed chases and shoots down Luci, Clark gets shot down by the police. Peanut walks out of the hospital, Lang notices and points out that he's not cuffed, Lang thanks Saleem for helping him. Lang asks Slacks to handle the Peanut situation, and Slacks gets distracted by CG kidnapping Martin. Slacks doesn't stop them from driving off.\n\nLang leaves after being disappointed in the police, but calls Luci and Arush to check in. Arush picked Luci up after he got shot down, and is going to drop him off somewhere safe before coming back to get Lang. Lang runs into Larry who is coming out of the hospital, Larry threatens Saleem as he's being held up. Saleem stabs Larry outside the hospital.Ramee then kidnaps Marty, and K questions him about hacking CG before Maze Bank and twatting \"sit\". Marty denies the twat and says that he won't hack CG anymore. Ramee takes Marty's phone and sends some texts to other OB members.\n\nMay 15th -\n\nArush calls to let Lang know that he's going to hit the pushers on La Puerta (CG's turf) because he believes Peanut robbed the pushers. They pop by the prison to pick up Apple. Luci confirms that Tommy heard Peanut, they're not sure why CG is involved, but it seems like two different fights. They stop by the house to get Apple a gun, Gigi calls to inform Lang that Arush was getting picked up by CG from being down in Cypress. Bubbles tells Clark over the phone that Loco is at the hospital, not Arush. They think Gigi may have been confused. The boys pull up to Cypress and attempt to bait plan CG, Lang and others find overlooking positions, Apple stays on the road below. They wait for a very long time, but Lang sees a convoy of cops roll by, so he brings Luci over to 'have a meeting' so they don't look sus.\n\nCG pulls up and the shooting begins, but Lang was talking to the voices and missed it. Lang, Luci, Vito, and Zeek regroup in the construction site, Lang tries to tell them to scatter. Lang sees someone on a roof and shoots them down, he heads to the corner of the site and calls Gigi for a pick up. She pulls up, Lang jumps down and into her car and they drive off. The cops watch Lang get into Gigi's car and chase after them, but Lang pulls over to get keys and swap seats. Conan recognizes 'Frank' from the shop earlier, but Lang flees.\n\nMay 16th -\n\nLang arrives at Frank's to take over a shift, Clark tries to leave. Lang is upset with Marlo and tries to fire him, but CG pulls up and takes Lang hostage. Ramee forces Lang into the trunk, they drive to the airport as Lang pings Luci and calls the cops from his phone. They use Lang as a hostage as they get to the airport roof, the cops begin shooting as Ramee goes down. Lang wants to know who the masked and voice changed person is (Suarez). Lang and Ramee chat basketball while they're waiting. Lang presses the masked person to see who he is, but 'The Terminator' shoots him.\n\nLang is on the ground for a long time while they chat about basketball, Lang makes fun of Vinny and tries to get the other members of CG to reveal the hidden person's identity. CG shoots down a few cops, but eventually the cops push and take everyone out. Lang and all the other downed people get escorted to the triage outside the airport building, some of the cops welcome Lang back (because he's been down so many times today).\n\nApr 6th 2024 - CG hit Maze Bank\n\nChang Gang's First Attempt at a Maze Bank Robbery\n\nSquad:K, Ramee, Taco, Chris, Peanut, Zolo, and Jean Paul (X)\n\nCG attempted to hit the Maze Bank today, after exploring the area around the bank they found a door with a keypad on it, generators in the canal entrance and the well known opening vent. They decided to send the RC car down the vent in reverse in the hopes of finding a code for the door, as no one has been able to figure out how to drive the RC car forward. The RC car got stuck in the vents and was unable to move. The boys decided to go explore the generators in the canal entrance which they were able to disable with a rather simple chopping hack. This unlocked a door that allowed to hit a electrical box which had a new hack that K got closest to solving with a 18/24. After failing this hack 3 times an alarm was triggered and the police were notified.\n\nAttempt #3 of Maze Bank\n\nAbout and hour prior to the Maze bank contract being purchasable CG started getting ready setting up boats and getting a car. They arrived at the bank with the getaway plan in place and got to work. When they arrived, X found out that with an electric car, you were able to drive the RC car forward, after voicing that it worked for him they checked the roof, but the vent would not open.\n\nThey started at the back door, they scanned the G6 PNY card and got a lock to open the back door, after 1 fail, K opened the door; inside the garage they found an inner door that also required a PNY card, but they did not have a 3rd, or could they find a 3rd by calling people. After searching around, they found the vault area, they are unable to open any of the gated doors, but they know where it is located. After being unable to find a card, and them hearing an alarm, they decide to rush to the sewer entrance to see if they can enter from there.\n\nRamee and X one shot both the generators at the door and they went inside, there they found that they were unable to hit the thermite hack. The 1 hour limit was over, after going up the ladder, they see a server hack which they assume is the next step, after searching around they find the other PNY door that they found in the other entrance. After learning that the heist is done they start to come up with ideas, Ramee thinking that if they have enough PNY cards, they will be able to sneak through the locked doors through those hacks and not have to go through the generator room in the sewers.\n\nAttempt #4 of Maze Bank\n\nMr K woke up and saw that the Maze Bank heist was available, but they did not have enough BTC to hit it; after a few calls, and The Manor coming in clutch, they got enough btc and purchased the heist. After setting up for about 1 hour they started. They started with hitting the doors with the G6 PNY cards, after unfortunately failing once they got the first door, they then barely failed the inside garage door. They then learned that cops have arrived on scene and they need a hostage.\n\nMr K successfully completes the Thermite and both Ramee and Mr K get into the server room, they try to hit the server but they need a code. When searching for codes, Vinny went to the roof to see if the vent was open, to which it was not; perhaps they need to hit thermite and it opens for 10 seconds? They tried the multiple codes that they had available, but none of them work... the working theory is that they need to get into the security room which will have the code they need.\n\nMr K then went down the ladder, but set off the laser and the alarm went off. Peanut leaves before hitting the thermite to get a hostage and returns with 2 hostages for the bank, after some pressing from the cops they bring the hostages inside the bank doors. Ramee and Mr K escape through the boat in the canals, being chased by the cops, after beaching the boat, Ramee gets chased on foot to get picked up by Vinny on a bike. Mr K was not chased and was able to evade the cops. Vinny escaped rather easily, and after exchange of hostages Taco and Peanut were able to escape pursuit.\n\nAttempt #5 of Maze Bank\n\nDuring the day, Ramee and other CG members came in clutch and got 4+ PNY cards. After successfully hacking the 2 PNY doors, the boys arrive at the security room; here you are able to look at all the cameras in the Maze Bank (to see the door codes to open them via PC hack at the server); after learning they can see the codes, Mr K and Ramee head to the sewers to get to the Laptop hack, Mr K after failing the Thermite twice, clutched up the 3rd attempt, Ramee went up to the server room. Mr K went back toward the vault area, after telling Ramee the first code, he begins his first hack (seen below). A number of shapes pop up, they need to remember the shapes in each sequence and colors then input them in order, 4 successful inputs opens the door (only the door with the code). After successfully opening the first door, Mr K after some discussion with Taco and Tuggz, finds a thermite hack to take down lazers in the vault room. After getting into the 2 side rooms (without lazers blocking), they get around 60k.\n\nWith 30 minutes left to finish the heist, they open the last door, Mr K starts to hack the lazers inside the vault room, he needs to correctly match 28 instead of 24 earlier. This proves to be very difficult, and failed 5 times. With 20 minutes to go in the heist, they are in a rush to get to thermite; Peanut comes in clutch and gets 4 thermite from Future. Peanut rushes back to the bank, Mr K clutches the Thermite hack in 1 try, but they notice that there is an even bigger vault door in the back, there are 3 big bars above the door, 1 is green, 2 are red. Ramee thinks that you will be able to fingerprint the scanners by the door, as well as scramble stuff in the security room.\n\nMr K does the thermite again, after one fail he successfully does it, they use the fingerprint scanners on the 2 fingerprint readers; They need 4 codes per fingerprint scanner. You get the code from the security room, you are able to descramble a system to receive codes (tuggz, taco and ramee think this) When ramee goes back upstairs the server has locked down and they are unable to continue the heist. After discussing, They have 2 options moving forward; The security room cameras are able to give Ramee (laptop hack) a code for the last door; when the security people look at the camera, they see a scrambled code, once ramee completes the laptop hack the code descrambles. They need to enter 2, 4 digit codes into the fingerprint scanners to successfully enter the hack. They need to do this in coordination because there are lazers that turn back on at the fingerprint scanners. (Laptop Hack x2; and Vault, Money trays and Gold bars inside the last vault) The boys then escape with all the marked cash they could get; around 100k in Marked Bills.\n\nAttempt #6 of Maze Bank\n\nThey get prepared outside the bank and get hostages, once everyone arrives, K calls Taco to start the heist; Mr K quickly hacks the tech spot to get the codes for the PNY cards; Ramee after failing twice to get warmed up ace's the 2 PNY card doors. Ramee and K head down to the sewers. Mr K starts the thermite, after failing once to get warmed up, he just gets the 2nd thermite, Ramee heads up to the server room, Mr K turns around and heads back to the main bank to go downstairs In the meantime, Peanut is with the 2 hostages, Vinny and Tuggz go to the security room, as they dont want to screenshot, they pre-write the codes to each door on a notepad in game. Once Ramee is at the server and ready he starts opening the doors, Ramee is on fire today, he has 1 shotted every hack since the 2 PNY card fails. While Ramee is hacking the doors, Mr K tries to do one of the 2 thermite hacks that are necessary, he just barely fails at 27/28. They open the doors and begin to get the loot from the side rooms. Vinny starts ferrying the loot upstairs while Tuggz and Ramee open doors, and Taco and K start to think about the plan of attack.... 16 minutes in, 44 minutes to go.\n\nTuggz had to go to sleep and wake back up due to scuff. During this, they were planning, K is gonna hit the thermite, Vinny and Tuggz will both watch the door; once he completes after 2 fails, they see the SAME code on the door; they tell this to Ramee. Ramee tries the laptop hack, it is a harder version of the original door hack (3 symbols instead of 2 per line) (See picture below). After Ramee fails the first try, Mr K wants to test the theory if there are different door codes, he tries the thermite again, after failing 3 times, he hits the thermite and Ramee gets the door code to hack; he barely failed the hack, they have to try again... After a few try's on the Thermite, the bank alarm goes off. Ramee escapes to the boat and finds 4 cops sitting there; Meta wise, the cops started going into the tunnels and set of the lazers and caused the boys to fail after 44 minutes. They escape with all the loot, similar numbers to the last time.\n\nAttempt #9 and #10 of Maze Bank\n\nAfter a quick fail for attempt #9 on the PNY card doors; they begin attempt 10. Crew: Mr K, Ramee, Peanut, Zaceed, Zolo, Arya Downstairs: K, Zaceed, Arya, Laptop: Ramee Sewer door: Peanut (believed to be the 3rd hack they are missing Camera's: Zolo Arya wakes up and they get ready to hit the heist... Mr K wants Arya to do the RC car, so they make sure she is able to use it... after some complication she is easily able to control it. Mr K goes to Tech Support to unlock the vent, and Arya begins her hacks... she gets both the easy pincracker hacks for the door codes... Ramee quickly aces the first PNY door, he fails the first hack on the 2nd door, but Aces the 2nd hack. Mr K, Peanut, and Ramee all head to the generator area,\n\nwhile Zolo and Arya bring the van inside and get to the cameras. Ramee and Peanut both quickly do the generator hack, Mr K goes inside and gets ready for thermite... HE IS ON FIRE! he ACES that 24 thermite and Ramee goes upstairs; Zolo calls him to start giving codes and unlock the doors while Mr K heads back to the main bank and heads downstairs to begin the lower part of the heist... while Ramee is quickly hacking through the doors, Arya, Zaceed and K begin to collect the money in the side vaults. Approx: 15 minutes in; 45 minutes to go.... Now they test there theory of the door Peanut is at, opens when K hits thermite.\n\nMr K after a few fails, successfully hits the thermite, Arya and Zaceed go to hit the pincracker; BOTH succeed on their first try; Ramee unfortunately fails the laptop hack.... The important part, the door in the sewers DID NOT open for Peanut, he came back inside the bank and headed for Ramee for a second theory; they are going to look for a vent like the roof that opens once the Thermite is hit; They see 2 vents on either side of the vault room, they think that those will be one of the hacks; but they need to find the entrance.\n\n2nd attempt, after 1 fail, K successfully hits the hack; The next idea for the 3rd hack area did not open, they look upstairs near the teller desk... K starts his 3rd try, while Peanut is waiting in the lobby area to see if the door opens, the door does not open, but Ramee thinks he spotted something at the desk near the G6 turn in NPC; Peanut heads back downstairs for Ks 4th time doing the thermite... They find that the Computer at the G6 worker when Mr K hits the thermite, you can bypass the vault security via that computer. Everyone gets geared up, they know all the hacks and how to get into the vault; they continue to try.... 38 minutes down.... 22 minutes left...\n\nWhen they try the next hack, the bank alarm starts going off; They are unsure about how the lasers went off; Mr K went outside and saw a cop running around, he thinks it was the cops; Ramee didnt see a PD boat directly outside of the sewer entrance, after searching around, Ramee steals the PD boat; everyone escapes in cars/vans and they deposit the money in the house.... They are extremely disappointed that the alarm went off, but have no idea why... They have the entire heist figured out.\n\nAttempt #14 of Maze Bank\n\nMr K, Ramee, Zolo, Zaceed, Arya, Tuggz.\n\nAfter the usual hacking into the bank, they quickly get to the basement and open all the doors; After thermiting the downstairs 28 thermite, Arya, Zaceed, Ramee all 1 shot there hacks, Tuggz hits the computer and the vault opens. In a rush for time, as they think that the gold bar doors are timed before they cannot be opened.... Tuggz finds a hack for the Teller door in the main lobby of Maze Bank.... After Zaceed opens the door, they find 3 computers they have to hack (must hack all 3 of them); Ramee quickly does 2, Zaceed tries to do the last one and ACES the hack. THE CODES HAVE STOPPED!\n\nZolo tells Ramee the code to the gold bar door.... after a successful hack the doors open! Mr K quickly gets the gold bars, and a 9090 GPU blueprint. While everyone is looting, Mr K and Ramee have the idea of leaving the bank early with the BP and the Gold Bars. They are going to stash the loot and return to help the other 4 to escape cops. Cops arrive shortly after Mr K and Ramee leave; The cops say they will not pursue, they do not believe them, so are being safe.... Zaceed calls Mr K and says that he also escaped with gold bars.\n\nThe CG group collected 15+ gold bars of different weights, plus all the cash in the bank (approx 150k), as well as the 9090 GPU BP.\n\nMr.K called Bruce to let him know the news, and Bruce gave him a Speech of congratulations in return.\n\nMay 15th 2024 - CG war with Cypress/Lang Gang/Oldbois\n\nMay 14th -\n\nArush calls to let Lang know that he's going to hit the pushers on La Puerta (CG's turf) because he believes Peanut robbed the pushers. They pop by the prison to pick up Apple. Luci confirms that Tommy heard Peanut, they're not sure why CG is involved, but it seems like two different fights. They stop by the house to get Apple a gun, Gigi calls to inform Lang that Arush was getting picked up by CG from being down in Cypress. Bubbles tells Clark over the phone that Loco is at the hospital, not Arush. They think Gigi may have been confused.

They wait for a very long time, but Lang sees a convoy of cops roll by, so he brings Luci over to 'have a meeting' so they don't look suspicous.\n\nCG pulls up and the shooting begins, but Lang was talking to the voices and missed it, he almost kills Mr.K. Lang, Luci, Vito, and Zeek regroup in the construction site, Lang tries to tell them to scatter.

Lang gets a radio and bitches out Arush for rushing. Lang regroups with everyone and circles around Cypress for a bit, Arush goes down and claims he was shot by a Tesla and confused it for Clark and Apple. Ilya doesn't have a gun, so he hops off radio, Martin joins. Lang gets Arush to the hospital to get patched up, he buys bandages and communicates with the boys while they wait. They get Sakura off the radio and call in Loco as a 6th. Martin picks up Loco, they need fuel and battery recharge, so they go to Vinewood.\n\nLoco waves around his gun in the car, the cops pull up and press Clark and Apple for the local calling in the gun. Lang tells them to Karen they're way out of it. The cops turn to Martin and Loco who are nearby, but they eventually get into a chase. Lang and Arush go to pick up a lockpick and Lang grabs a boat. Lang picks up Loco and Martin and escapes the cops, heading over to Clark and Apple at Chumash, but decides to double back and meet Arush at the docks for the car. Martin heads to Mosley's to get his car, they convoy with him to help. Martin's car is at the old redline garage, so they pick it up.

They think there will either be something with the wire connections, one of the doors on the side, or starting in the sewer. After Vinny takes Ramee to the hospital to get him up, K calls Bobby to start the heist... Immediately they notice that there is a noise level meter, they need to talk quietly, and walk slowly to make sure they dont set off any alarms. After searching inside and around the building, they find a door with a keypad to hack. K talks to the boys, and calls Ramee to the door to try and open it... He tries the hack, it is the PNY card hack from Maze Bank, after failing, the Alarm level goes up slighty, looking like a natural fail mechanic for the entire heist... After 2 tries, Ramee aces the hack, they enter a small room with printers and computer, and 2 doors with keypad hacks, after chatting with Ramee for a bit, Ramee does the hack where they find another hallway with a few numberpads doors... Ramee aces another Memory keypad, and they enter a security rooms with Camera's etc. There are 13 total camera's they can look at, all over the Gallery, they learn they can open the garage, there are lower rooms, vaults, auction house, elevators, stairs etc. After searching through the camera's, they are able to hack the noise sensors within the rooms, K tries to hack one, where its a variation to the Roof Running hack, you need to make all the colors the same color instead of maek them disappear... It seems that the Alert level slowly goes down. After playing with the Camera's and K trying to disable some noise sensors, they start searching elsewhere. Ramee and K head to the sewers to check if there are other things they can access... Zaceed is there and they try to take out the generator, it is the same hack as the sewers/wifi. Zaceed/Ramee, after getting tazed a few times, disable the generator. They find a grate at the bottom, that is openable, but they need to figure out how to open it.... after searching around, they try a few ideas to no luck... eventually the Alert level spikes once, then a second time to set off the alarm. They continue to search around a few times, Ramee finds a door and they start escaping. Cops are pretty quick on scene... Ramee goees and talks to them and starts to delay for everyone to escape.

The valves that they saw yesterday, appeared once again, and he calls the boys (Common Vinny W ). Ramee heads over and finds out they need to hack Thermite, calling Mr K. After finding out they dont have to be careful about noise level when outside of the bank, K heads over and tries the Thermite... it is much more difficult, needing 30 points, with a timer of around 25 seconds. This is extremely difficult, after a few tries, K does the hack, but the water level goes down.
