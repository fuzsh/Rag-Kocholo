        "text": "The first several months of World War II -- nicknamed the \"Phony War\" -- began and ended with the German invasion of neighboring states -- Poland first, in September 1939, and then Denmark and Norway in April 1940. Here, the similarity ended. Nazi Germany invaded Scandinavia in 1940 due to Germany's naval war against the British and their American suppliers, and to protect the winter route for iron from Sweden. And unlike the invasion of Poland, the attacks on Denmark and Norway launched a permanent state of fighting in Europe that lasted right down to German defeat in May 1945.\n\nWorld War II Image Gallery\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brief northern campaign was one of the most successful of Hitler's gambles. On April 9, German forces entered Denmark and occupied the peninsula without serious resistance. A seaborne and airborne force, covered by a German air screen, then invaded Norway. Despite stubborn Norwegian resistance, and the landing of British and French troops in support in northern Norway, the Norwegian government agreed to an armistice on June 9. However, many German warships were sunk or damaged in this operation.\n\nOn May 10, Adolf Hitler had his forces in the West -- after months of patient preparation -- launch the attack on France through the Low Countries and the Ardennes Forest farther to the south, which the Allies had thought impassable by a modern army. A few hours after German troops crossed the Dutch border, an act of long-term significance took place in London when Winston Churchill succeeded Neville Chamberlain as British prime minister. At that moment, Churchill later wrote, \"I felt as if I was walking with destiny.\"\n\nThe first weeks of Churchill's premiership proved disastrous for the Allies. German plans to push heavily armored divisions along forested terrain, supported by waves of aircraft, succeeded well beyond the expectations of many German generals. The French defensive line was pierced, and within days a gap burst open in the Allied front that could not be closed. The British Expeditionary Force was pushed back toward the sea around the port of Dunkirk, France, and faced annihilation -- until General Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt and Adolf Hitler ordered German forces to stop on May 24 to refit and prepare to break the new French defense line further south. By the time the attacks began again on May 26, the British had planned a hasty marine retreat. By June 4, 338,000 troops, one-third of them French, had been evacuated.\n\nThough the \"miracle of Dunkirk\" has long been celebrated in Britain, it represented an ignominious defeat. The surviving French resistance slowly crumbled. On June 14, German forces entered Paris; on June 22, the French sued for an armistice, and German victory was complete. While a similar campaign during World War I had lasted four years and cost the lives of 1.5 million Germans, this campaign was over in six weeks. This time, Nazi Germany lost 30,000 men. The reasons for the rapid German victory have been debated often. The Allies, including Dutch and Belgian forces, had a clear advantage in number of army divisions, tanks, and armored vehicles. Airpower favored the Germans, but only because German air forces were concentrated in an aerial spearhead that pushed forward in coordination with the armored divisions on the ground. Military competence and strategic daring counted for something on the German side. The central problem for the Allies was the dispersal of their troops. Because French commander Maurice Gamelin had sent his reserve army northward, it could not plug the Ardennes gap. Aircraft were stationed all over France and Britain, but were not concentrated at the front; and the system of communications on the western side worked poorly. The argument that French soldiers lacked stomach for the fight because French society was in some sense \"decadent\" is difficult to prove. Their morale was poor because they sensed that they were poorly led. German victory in June 1940 had profound consequences. For the British and French, it was the worst possible outcome. France was defeated, its northern half as well as its Atlantic coast occupied by German forces. Britain was isolated from Continental Europe and had no prospect of reentering it to dislodge Adolf Hitler without the help of powerful allies (i.e., the United States and Soviet Union). France was now ruled by the authoritarian Marshal Philippe Pétain, who set up a new government center at Vichy, where his regime pursued policies that mimicked those of other Fascist states.\n\nOn June 10, 1940, Benito Mussolini's Italy declared war on Britain and France. Thus, a powerful enemy lay across Britain's main route in the Mediterranean to its eastern empire. Hitler was faced with the pleasing but unexpected prospect of German domination of Europe. On July 19, he announced before the Reichstag proposals for a European peace if Britain would accept the reality of German dominance and end hostilities. Churchill's government rejected it. British society braced itself for a possible invasion.\n\nHitler faced a critical dilemma in the summer of 1940. Successful beyond his expectations, he wanted to subordinate Britain in order to prepare for conflicts with the Soviet Union and the United States. When Britain refused to accept a German peace, Hitler ordered his forces to prepare to invade. The Luftwaffe (air force) was given the task of softening British resistance.\n\nOn July 31, a few days before the air attacks on Britain began in earnest, Adolf Hitler called his commanders together and told them that he had abandoned his and their hopes of invading the Soviet Union in the fall of 1940, and instead would begin that operation in the spring of 1941. German troops were sent into Romania and military arrangements were made with Finland since these two countries were to join Nazi Germany in invading the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile the invasion of Britain (Operation Sealion) was being prepared, the Luftwaffe began its assault. This was the start of what would become known as the Battle of Britain. Waves of bombers, strongly supported by fighter aircraft, first attacked British air fields and sources of air supply. In September, they attacked the whole military and urban infrastructure within range of German fighters. The Germans' goal was to create conditions for landing an invasion force on the coast of southern England. The air battle was regarded as decisive only because the failure to eliminate Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) would force the postponement of what the Germans considered a risky operation.\n\nThe defending British fighter force had difficulty preventing German bombing, but it was able to inflict high levels of attrition on the attacking force thanks to the first successful use of radar detection. From July to the end of October 1940, the RAF lost 915 aircraft while the Germans lost 1,733. The number of fighter pilots and fighter aircraft on the British side remained at roughly the same level as at the start of the battle, but German numbers declined. By mid-September, it was evident that the Luftwaffe was making little headway, and the first phase of the Battle of Britain was over.\n\nThe second phase was more deadly and more prolonged. On September 17, Adolph Hitler postponed Sealion, and the Luftwaffe was given the task of knocking Britain out of the war by bombing alone. Heavy raids were directed at military and economic targets as well as urban areas, and civilian casualties were heavy. More than 40,000 British citizens were killed during the course of the \"Blitz,\" which came to be directed at all major ports and industrial and commercial centers.\n\nBy December 1940, the German leadership expected Britain to surrender. \"When will Churchill capitulate?\" Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary. Bombing did produce widespread disruption and local panic, but at no point did the British government consider surrender. Gold and foreign exchange reserves were moved to Canada, and preparations were made for guerrilla activities in any portion of the country occupied by the Germans. The public was heartened by news of British victories in East Africa and Libya against Italian-led forces, and the knowledge that British bombers were regularly attacking German cities in return.\n\nSee the next section for a detailed timeline on the important World War II events that occurred during early April 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Legacy of Nazi Germany\n\nWhat drove Germany to become so powerful?

In 1939-1940, France hurried to improve the secret fortifications. Underground bunkers that could house thousands of men included such amenities as a wine cellar, morgue, chapel, hospital, and dental clinic. Illustrators often depicted the constructions as compact, but they were actually spread out and connected with tunnels through which trolleys carried troops and weapons. These preparations gave the French military a false sense of security. Invading German forces simply maneuvered around the Maginot Line.\n\nNorway forced into war through Nazi German invasion: Norwegian houses burn in Narvik during the spring 1940 German invasion. After the British rescue of Altmark prisoners and other actions in Norwegian waters, Hitler feared losing the neutral country's ports of Narvik, which were essential for shipping Scandinavian iron ore to Germany. Adolf Hitler attacked Norway by land, air, and sea, overrunning resistance. In mid-April, British, Polish, and French forces landed to aid the Norwegians and took Narvik. The British sank 10 German destroyers -- half of the entire fleet. However, with France near collapse, the Allies withdrew on June 8, leaving Narvik to German occupation. The Norwegian conflict included the first paratrooper attack (by Germany) in history, and Britain's first major amphibious landing of the war (at Narvik).\n\nNorwegians refuse to surrender to Nazi Germany: When the Germans occupied Norway in April 1940, they showed off these three experimental tanks (never put into production) in the streets of Oslo. Germany had trouble taking Norway due to bad weather, strong fortifications, and tenacious Norwegian resistance. The royal family and members of Parliament had time to escape to the north. Although the Germans set up a puppet government under Nazi supporter Vidkun Quisling, Norway's King Haakon never surrendered. When the Allies evacuated Norway, the Norwegian government moved to Britain and operated in exile. It controlled its own merchant navy and built a new military to support the Allies.\n\nBritish plane spotters recognize and report enemy aircrafts: A Royal Observer Corps (ROC) plane spotter watches for enemy aircraft. Back in 1925, the ROC was formed to provide a system for detecting, tracking, and reporting aircraft over Britain. Plane spotters learned to recognize aircraft by their silhouette, and often by the sound of their engines. In the U.S., Civil Defense workers and WAACS (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) maintained spotting stations, and in Germany the Reichsluftschutzbund (National Air Defense League) had a similar mission.\n\nFollow more World War II events of April and May 1940, including Nazi Germany's invasion of the Low Countries, on the following page.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLate April and early May of 1940 found Adolf Hitler declaring war against Norway and invading the Low Countries.

With the assistance of material provided by Polish intelligence, his team eventually broke the German operational and strategic Enigma encoding system. These code-breakers worked exceptionally long hours in cheerless office accommodations and excessively hot and noisy computer rooms. They included scientists, mathematicians, linguists, crossword experts, and others with diverse analytical skills.\n\nGerman Ju-88 bomber important to Luftwaffe: The Ju-88 twin-engine medium bomber boasted a maximum speed of 269 mph, a ceiling of almost 30,000 feet, and a range of 1,112 miles. Carrying capacity was about 6,000 pounds of bombs. This fast, maneuverable, and versatile aircraft provided sterling service to the Luftwaffe throughout the war in bombing, occasional dive-bombing, close support, maritime torpedo, interceptor, and night-fighter roles. Some 14,676 Ju-88s were built, with about 9,000 used primarily as bombers.\n\nLearn more about Nazi Germany's campaign in the Low Countries on the World War II timeline next.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNazi Germany continued its march through Europe in May 1940, invading and crushing the Netherlands.

On April 10, 1940, Blackburn Skua dive-bombers located the Königsberg -- already damaged by Norwegian shore artillery -- in Bergen Harbor, Norway. The Skuas dove out of the rising sun and dropped their 500-pound bombs from heights ranging from 3,000 feet to as low as 200 feet, proving the effectiveness of dive-bombing to a skeptical RAF establishment. The Königsberg lost electrical power and, unable to control the fires, sank within three hours.\n\nGermans storm France, Low Countries: On May 10, 1940, German tanks, troops, and bombers smashed into France and the Low Countries in a Blitzkrieg -- a swift attack with combined air and mobile land forces -- that was totally unexpected by the Allies. Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands fell quickly. Hitler's tanks charged through the Ardennes forests, bypassed the static French defenses, and drove westward across northern France to the English Channel. By May 21, the Germans had split the Allied forces in two. Here, a French tank crewman surrenders to German forces.\n\nIn June 1940 Nazi Germany marched into France.

Dutch strategic planning had been shaped by an underestimation of Germany, strong pacifist influences, appeasement policies, refusal to coordinate with Britain and France, and a dependence upon defensive strong-points (such as this steel-gated bridge over the Maas River) and obstacles -- including flooding large areas of Holland. Consequently, the Germans quickly overwhelmed the sizable but outdated, ill-equipped, and largely immobile Dutch army. While some Dutch citizens formed an effective resistance movement beginning in 1942, anti-Semitism and pro-German collaboration were also in evidence.\n\nThe \"Schmeisser\" principal weapon of Wehrmacht: The MP40 Maschinenpistole was known universally but inaccurately as the \"Schmeisser\" after weapons designer Hugo Schmeisser, who did not design this submachine gun. However, this was one of the iconic weapons of the war, with both Allied and German troops recognizing it as the best weapon of its class. Conceived originally as a weapon for paratroops, it quickly became the Wehrmacht's principal submachine gun. It had a caliber of 9mm, a magazine that held 32 rounds, and a rate of fire of 500 rounds per minute. It was accurate up to 200 meters. Moreover, its all-metal stamped construction made it both cheap and easy to mass-produce.\n\nThe MG 34, a highly effective German machine gun: A German infantryman takes aim at the enemy with an MG 34 7.92mm light machine gun. While this version utilized a 50-round metal-link belt, the MG 34 could also be equipped with 50- and 75-round drum ammunition feeds. Although the MG 34 was expensive to produce, it was a highly effective weapon. It delivered a maximum rate of fire of 900 rpm to 600-800 yards (light role), and 300 rpm to 2,000-2,500 yards when mounted on a tripod in the heavy role. MG 34s also were fitted extensively to armored vehicles and trucks, and for anti-aircraft defense.\n\nThe following page contains a detailed timeline of World War II events from June of 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 1940 Benito Mussolini and Italy joined Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany as an Axis power in World War II.

The reprieve lasted 48 hours and gave the British time to set up defenses and begin evacuation of 338,000 Allied troops. Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring promised that the Luftwaffe could destroy the Allied troops, but Dunkirk, France, was too close to British air bases. The British evacuees included many highly experienced soldiers who were eager to return to the fight, but they had lost all of their equipment.\n\n\"Little Ships\" save troops, symbolize spirit of Dunkirk: British soldiers wait for rescue on Dunkirk Beach. When the planned evacuation was announced to the British public on May 27, 1940, a fleet of fishing boats, pleasure craft, merchant marine vessels, and other small boats rushed across the English Channel to help. They retrieved the British, French, and Belgian troops from the bombed-out harbor, which the larger ships could not enter, and ferried those troops to the big ships. These \"Little Ships\" quickly gained legendary status, and the \"Spirit of Dunkirk\" became a British rallying cry.\n\nLuftwaffe rains terror on France: Firemen turn their hoses on a Parisian building that has been reduced to a smoldering ruin by Nazi bombardment. Even as the Allies evacuated at Dunkirk, Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring directed his Luftwaffe bombers inland. On June 3, 1940, 200 planes struck airfields, industrial sites, and buildings in Paris. This successful German effort to damage France's economy, reduce its military, and create terror in its population had a devastating psychological effect. To keep government officials at their posts, the French minister of interior had to threaten dire penalties against anyone who fled.\n\nThe French capitulated in mid-June of 1940.

The German bombardment of Paris inflicted some 900 casualties, including 254 dead. Most of the victims were civilians and many were schoolchildren. Designed to produce terror, the air attack had the desired effect. Fleeing civilians clogged all roads around Paris, where some were strafed by German planes.\n\nLuftwaffe attacks leave Dunkirk in flames: French civilians flee danger and destruction during the aerial bombardment of Dunkirk, France. Heavy Luftwaffe attacks left the dead and wounded scattered among the burning wreckage of homes, vehicles, and military equipment. British Expeditionary Forces Captain Richard Austin wrote: \"The whole front was one long continuous line of blazing buildings, a high wall of fire, roaring and darting in tongues of flame, with the smoke pouring upwards and disappearing in the blackness of the sky above the rooftops.\" Dunkirk was reduced to rubble.\n\nAllies evacuate 220,000 from Cherbourg, France: British and French soldiers leave Cherbourg, France, on British ships bound for Southampton, England. After the successful evacuation at Dunkirk, the British rescued an additional 220,000 Allied troops that had been stranded in France. On June 10, Operation Cycle picked up evacuees at Le Havre. Beginning on June 15 at Cherbourg, in Operation Ariel, Allies spirited soldiers away from Saint-Malo, Brest, Saint-Nazaire, and other ports all the way down the French coast to the border with Spain. When the evacuations were complete on June 25, a total of 558,000 Allied troops had escaped the German invasion.\n\nVichy's minister of defense balances opposing interests: French General Maxime Weygand served as Vichy defense minister from June to September 1940. In that burdensome role, he juggled Japanese demands for freedom of movement in northern Indochina against strong U.S. opposition to the idea. Then as Vichy delegate to the French North African colonies, Weygand alternately protested and collaborated with Nazi policies. Heeding U.S. warnings, Weygand opposed German bases in Africa, though he had equipment delivered to Rommel's Afrika Korps. Weygand's semi-collaboration was insufficient for Hitler. Under Nazi pressure, Weygand was recalled in November 1941, arrested in 1942, and held by Germany for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of France: On May 10, 1940, German General Fedor von Bock's Army Group B struck into Belgium and the Low Countries. This was only a diversionary attack, as the main assault by General Karl Rudolf Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group A was launched from the Ardennes forests, while General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb's Army Group C secured the southern flank and pinned down some 30 French divisions. By June 25, France had fallen.\n\nKeep reading for a World War II timeline detailing events of late June and early July 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Luftwaffe\n\nThrough the early years of World War II, Nazi Germany's enemies feared the Luftwaffe, the most advanced and powerful air force in the world. This mighty force began (with Soviet assistance) as a clandestine program in the 1920s. After 1933 the Luftwaffe expanded to include 20,000 personnel and 1,888 aircraft. In 1936 the second generation of aircraft -- including the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, the Junkers 87 (Stuka) dive-bomber, and the Heinkel 111 bomber -- were released. Most were trialed in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe Luftwaffe was integral to the Blitzkrieg that swept away nearly all before it from 1939 to 1941. Crucial was its tactical ground support, through dive-bombing, strafing, level bombing, and parachute operations. Its aircraft also sank 750,000 tons of Allied shipping in 1939 and more than four million tons in 1940. During the Battle of Britain, the Germans attempted to use the Luftwaffe to win a campaign on its own, as a strategic force. In failing, many of its best pilots were killed.\n\nThe Luftwaffe contributed substantially to victories in the Mediterranean and the USSR in 1941, but an agonizing decline followed. While the Luftwaffe responded effectively initially to the Anglo-American Combined Bomber Offensive of 1943, Adolf Hitler's preoccupation with retaliatory bombing hampered Germany's defense. Moreover, from late 1943, the Allies concentrated on destroying the Luftwaffe, targeting German fighters over the Reich, aircraft factories, and oil plants. The Luftwaffe was finished as an effective force by D-Day late in 1944, when only 170 aircraft faced 12,000 Allied planes in northern France.\n\nFrom then until war's end, Luftwaffe fighters offered negligible aerial resistance. While Soviet armies were most responsible for the German army's defeat, Western air forces played a major role in crushing its aerial counterpart. The innovative last generation of German aircraft included jet and rocket fighters, but the quantity, fuel, and trained pilots needed to alter the war's course were simply not available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late June 1940 France officially surrendered to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and in early July Hitler made plans to invade Britain.

On June 17, 1940, the loaded ship was struck by German Junker 88 airplanes near the port of St. Nazaire. The bombs -- one of which is said to have gone down the ship's funnel -- were fatal. The Lancastria rolled over and sank in minutes. Many who went into the water choked on spilled fuel oil or died when the oil slick caught fire. Of the estimated 4,000 to 9,000 on board, fewer than 2,500 survived.\n\nBritish remove signs as part of anti-invasion measures: In mid-1940, many in Britain believed that a German invasion was all but inevitable. Throughout the country, and especially in southern England, numerous anti-invasion measures were implemented. Road signs were removed so that parachutists would be disoriented; hundreds of concrete pillboxes were constructed in a series of east-west defensive lines; tall wooden posts were erected in open areas to disrupt parachute or glider-borne landings; hundreds of miles of barbed wire and thousands of mines were laid along the coastline; and detailed plans were made to defend every town and village. Meanwhile, the population everywhere was on the alert for spies, subversive agents, and enemy paratroopers.\n\nLord Beaverbrook head of British aircraft production: Lord Beaverbrook (William Maxwell Aitken) was Britain's minister of aircraft production and a member of the War Cabinet from May 1940. His sometimes ruthless but invariably focused approach, coupled with his inspired leadership, produced remarkable results during 1940. More than 7,300 aircraft were built between January and August -- just in time for the strategically vital Battle of Britain. He became minister of supply in 1941 and minister of production in 1942, while also dealing with the provision of Anglo-U.S. military aid to Russia. Soon thereafter, ill health forced the resignation of the man who Winston Churchill said was \"at his best when things were at their worst.\"\n\nThe next page contains a detailed timeline summarizing important World War II events from July 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 1940 Romania announced its alliance with Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler ordered the destruction of the British Royal Air Force (RAF).

Made premier in March 1940, Reynaud appointed Charles de Gaulle undersecretary of war. That June, Time magazine ran a cover story on Reynaud, quoting him: \"Nothing has lowered our will to struggle for our land and liberty... France cannot die.\" That same month, Reynaud refused to surrender to the Nazis, and resigned. He was arrested by the Vichy government and imprisoned for the duration of the war.\n\nVichy's Philippe Pétain weak in face of Nazis: Marshal Philippe Pétain became a French national hero in World War I, primarily because of his defense of Verdun. Between the wars, his posts included inspector general of the army, war minister, and ambassador to Spain. In May 1940, French Premier Paul Reynaud invited Pétain to become vice premier. After Paris fell, Pétain became head of state on June 16. French hopes for a repeat of Verdun proved misplaced. Now 84, Pétain cut a pathetic figure, apparently unable to raise enthusiasm for anything but minimizing French bloodshed. On June 22, 1940, he concluded an armistice with Germany.\n\nBritish attack French ships in Algerian port: The French battleship Bretagne burns in an Algerian port after being hit by British fire on July 3, 1940. Following the defeat of France, Britain moved to prevent French warships from falling into Nazi hands. A British ultimatum to the French commander in Algeria (where the substantial French fleet was of particular concern) demanded that the French ships either join with the British, sail under control to a British port, sail to a French port in the West Indies and be demilitarized, or be entrusted to the U.S. When no response came in six hours, Winston Churchill gave the order to attack. In the ensuing Battle of Oran, the British damaged and destroyed several French warships, killing more than 1,200 French sailors.\n\nIn August 1940 Adolf Hitler began preparing for Operation Sealion, the invasion of Britain Keep reading for a World War II timeline discussing this and other important World War II events of August 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nU.S. Strategy in China\n\nSupport for the Chinese war effort began even before the bombing of Pearl Harbor. President Franklin Roosevelt approved $25 million in military aid in late 1940, followed by another $145 million in Lend-Lease funds in May 1941. Approval was also granted for an American volunteer group of U.S. civilian pilots -- the so-called \"Flying Tigers\" -- to fight alongside the Chinese.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt appointed Lieutenant General Joseph Stilwell to command U.S. forces in the China-Burma-Indian theater and work with Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek to train and equip Chinese troop formations. Due to political and material complications, results were mixed.\n\nDelivery of materiel also posed problems. Japanese forces controlled the coast, and in May 1942 they cut the tenuous Burma Road supply line. This forced supplies to travel by air over the Himalayas, known to U.S. flyers as \"The Hump,\" which reduced the flow to Chinese units. Finally, Chinese needs ranked well down on the American priority list, after Europe and the Pacific.\n\nBut by mid-1944, Allied subs and air attacks destroyed Japan's ability to move troops by sea. At war's end, more than 600,000 Japanese -- men who had been prevented from facing U.S. forces in the Pacific -- surrendered in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLate July and early August of 1940 found Adolf Hitler preparing to invade Britain and Benito Mussolini sending Italian forces into north Africa.

Intending to knock out Britain's Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe actually loses more than twice as many aircraft -- 75 compared to Britain's 32.\n\nAugust 17: Germany blockades Britain, heavily mining its waters and vowing to attack all approaching ships, whether belligerent or neutral.\n\nWorld War II Headlines\n\nBelow are more images and headlines detailing important events of World War II and the German and Italian invasions of 1940.\n\nGermans train for Operation Sealion: In this faked photo, a German armored vehicle is supposedly on the beach of Dover, England. In 1940 Operation Sealion was a high-risk undertaking; no invasion of Britain had succeeded since 1066. Nevertheless, German plans advanced throughout that summer. Thousands of troops of the Ninth and 16th Armies assembled and trained in the coastal region, horses were conditioned to travel on barges, and hundreds of troop-carrying vessels were collected in French and Belgian ports. However, all ultimately depended upon the Luftwaffe achieving overall air supremacy beforehand, and so the victory won by the RAF during September's Battle of Britain effectively made Sealion no longer viable.\n\nBritish submarines successful in Mediterranean: The HMS Taku was one of the oceangoing T-class boats that formed the mainstay of the British submarine fleet. Royal Navy submarines operated in shallow waters that were heavily mined and well defended by antisubmarine forces. Of more than 50 deployed, nearly one out of three was destroyed, usually going down with all hands. Nevertheless, Royal Navy subs took a heavy toll on German ships in Norwegian waters. In the dangerously shallow and clear Mediterranean, British subs successfully interrupted German and Italian supply routes to Africa. British submarines also landed and picked up clandestine agents in various areas, and supported Allied efforts in the Malacca Straits and seas near Indonesia.\n\nThe Blitz continued throughout September 1940. On the following page is a World War II timeline detailing this and other events.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Blitz\n\n\"The bomber,\" British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin had told a somber Parliament in 1932, \"will always get through.\" The examples of Guernica in Spain, as well as Japanese attacks in China, suggested that Baldwin had been correct. After Britain's declaration of war in September 1939, its citizens prepared for the anticipated German bombing Blitz (a contraction of Blitzkrieg). The British launched barrage balloons to force bombers to high altitudes, while antiaircraft batteries ringed industrial targets.\n\nSince only a few bombs fell until mid-1940, Britain did have ample time to prepare. The government raised a dramatically resourceful civilian Auxiliary Fire Service. Moreover, it organized medical services and evacuated some three million women and children to the country. (Middle-class families hosting them learned appalling truths about the lives of the urban working class.) An efficient and dedicated Air Raid Precautions organization enforced civil defense measures, including a strict blackout, while many families built air raid shelters. In London especially, thousands sought protection in public shelters and famously in Underground stations, a sign of official unpreparedness as much as popular stoicism.\n\nWhen the air strikes came in August 1940, German bombers attacked London by day and night. What happened in London was the defining experience of the Blitz, but most large English cities were attacked as well. The notorious raid on Coventry, for instance, destroyed the city's center and killed more than 500 people.\n\nThe psychological basis of the attacks, that bombing would destroy a population's resolve, proved spectacularly wrong. \"Britain Can Take It\" became a popular motto, and though some cities approached panic at times, most people grew defiant rather than demoralized.\n\nBy mid-1941, when Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe joined the war against Russia, the sustained attacks against Britain largely ended. However, just days after the D-Day landing in June 1944, the first V-1 pilotless planes fell on London. In the fall of that year, V-2 ballistic missiles followed. Civilians wearied by five years of war were forced to endure a particularly terrifying weapon.\n\nSome 70,000 British civilians died during the attacks of 1940-41 and 1944. But to this day, citizens still celebrate and romanticize the \"spirit of the Blitz.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 1940, Britain retaliated for an attack on London by bombing Berlin for the first of what would be many air attacks in World War II.

Meanwhile, Luftwaffe fighter bombers and single bombers on precision bombing missions also attacked the capital by day. Regular air raids then con­tinued until May. Destruction was widespread and severe. This massive crater was possibly caused by one of the Luftwaffe's huge 2,500-kilogram \"Max\" Sprengbombe Cylindrisch bombs. Countrywide, from September 1940 to May 1941, the Blitz caused 43,000 civilian deaths and 139,000 serious injuries, as well as laying waste to many residential areas and industrial, dockland, and infrastructure facilities.\n\nHurricanes, Spitfires defend Britain: In 1937 the RAF's first monoplane fighter -- the Hurricane Hurricane Mark I -- entered squadron service. It boasted a top speed of more than 300 mph, eight machine guns (replaced with cannons in late 1940), and an operating radius of up to 600 miles. This formidable aircraft, together with the Spitfire (introduced in 1938), proved to be the mainstay of RAF Fighter Command during the crucial Battle of Britain. Using radar to track the approaching German bombers, RAF headquarters sent these Hurricanes and Spitfires to intercept. They inflicted crippling losses upon the Luftwaffe, which helped prevent a German invasion.\n\nKeep reading for a World War II timeline summarizing more important events from September 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nWinston Churchill Vows Revenge\n\n\"Winston stood alone in front, his dark blue boiler suit undone at the neck, a tin hat on his head, his hands folded on his stout stick in front of him, his chin thrust out, the long cigar in his mouth, and just across the other side of St. James's Park, Carlton House Terrace was ablaze: the boom of bombs exploding to the south, the crack and rattle of the AA guns and exploding shells, the red-white glow of the fire silhouetting the tall black trunks of the great trees in the park. It was a moment in history to remember, and above the noise came the angry voice of Winston Churchill: \"By God, we will get the B's for this.\"\n\n-- Royal Air Force intelligence officer F. W.

The full-time firefighters worked shifts of 48 hours on duty followed by 24 hours off, and they were joined during the particularly busy night hours by the part-time auxiliaries. Here, firefighters battle a blaze in London. Initially, the firefighting response to major fires that involved operations across local authority boundaries was hampered by the fire service's localized and excessively parochial system of command and control. However, after the Blitz ended in May 1941, all of these semiautonomous forces were brought together to form the National Fire Service.\n\nBritain's Auxiliary Fire Service unsung heroes: Members of the Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) add pins, probably representing the locations of pumps or fires, to a map of London on the wall of Fire Brigade Headquarters during the Blitz. The Auxiliary Fire Service had existed since 1937, and by September 1939 it had tens of thousands of male and female members. They were amateur firefighters recruited to work alongside regular fire brigades fighting fires started by enemy bombing. Incompatibility of the brigades' equipment hampered effectiveness, and in 1941 the AFS and regular brigades were merged into the National Fire Service. Winston Churchill called the London firefighters \"heroes with grimy faces.\" More than 900 firemen and women lost their lives during the war.\n\nBritish Army's Corps of Royal Engineers defuse \"dud\" bombs: The skillful but immensely hazardous task of disposing of unexploded bombs (UXB) or \"duds\" fell primarily to the British Army's Corps of Royal Engineers. Some 10 percent of the high-explosive bombs that were dropped failed to explode or had delayed-action fuses, and by the end of 1940 there were some 3,000 UXBs waiting to be defused. Whether still lying buried or clearly visible, these marked and cordoned (but still potentially deadly) devices would disrupt all movement and activity in the surrounding area. Here, Royal Engineers remove a deeply buried one-ton UXB near St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The huge bomb was safely exploded 30 minutes later.\n\nOctober 1940 saw Britain imploring the United States for military assistance in both the Atlantic and Pacific.

After the 1939 Nazi German takeover of Poland, Gestapo chief Reinhard Heydrich ordered Jews into segregated living areas. In the fall of 1940, Heydrich used the pretext of a typhus outbreak in Jewish neighborhoods to force the city's Jews into a 3.5-square-mile section of town. Non-Jewish Poles were moved out of the area. That November, the ghetto wall's 22 gates were closed, sealing off 360,000 Jews (one-third of Warsaw's entire population) from the rest of the Polish capital.\n\nThe World War II timeline on the following page lists important events from November 1940.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nThe Importance of Radar\n\nDuring the war, combatants used radar to detect ships and planes far beyond the range of the human eye. In simple terms, radar (radio detecting and ranging) utilizes transmitters to bounce radio waves off distant objects, revealing the objects' location, speed, and distance.\n\nThe use of radio waves to detect distant or unseen metallic objects was first demonstrated by German scientist Christian Hulsmeyer in 1904. However, it was the British who first used radar for a military advantage, as they built a series of radar stations along the English coast in 1938 to detect approaching aircraft. Known as the Chain Home, this system subsequently played a crucial role in the victory over the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain.\n\nThe Axis powers had also dabbled with radar technology in the 1930s, but they were slow to recognize its military potential, and never caught up with the Anglo-American technological edge.\n\nNovember of 1940 saw a mass execution of Polish intellectuals at Dachau, the first of many such executions by Nazi Germany.

Roosevelt struggles with war decision: While Franklin Roosevelt guided America through the Great Depression of the 1930s, Adolf Hitler and his fellow Axis leaders constructed military juggernauts with the mission to crush the democratic nations of the world. When war broke out in September 1939, Roosevelt's attempts to aid America's allies in Europe were blocked both by Congress and a majority of American citizens committed to the policy of neutrality and isolationism. America's experience in World War I had soured many on the idea of any more \"European entanglements,\" if only because of the great monetary cost. But FDR believed that if the Axis powers were successful in their conquests, the United States would eventually become the only surviving democracy in the world, standing alone and outnumbered against well-armed enemies.\n\nGo to the next page for a World War II timeline detailing important events from November and December 1940, including the completion of plans for Operation Barbarossa, Adolf Hitler's scheme to invade the Soviet Union.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nQuestions from the Deep\n\nWhat does a [merchant] steamer look like after sinking six or eight thousand feet? What happens to boats like ours [submarines] when they can no longer be kept from drowning? Are the wrecks crushed into huge compact lumps? Or do the compartments and the ruptured pressure hull flood so quickly with water that the pressure outside and in is soon equalized? Do they therefore retain their shape as they sink onto the seabed? And what happens to the men sunk along with their ships? Do corpses gradually rot in the lower depths?

After giving the wreck's coordinates, Schultze added, \"Save the crew, if you please.\" Fast, agile, and far-ranging, the U-48 was commissioned on April 22, 1939, and proved herself the most successful German U-boat of the war, sinking more than 50 ships and damaging others during its 12 patrols. By June 1941, the U-48, already becoming obsolete, was relegated to training exercises.\n\nGreece defends its soil from Italian invasion: Greek and Italian troops are portrayed in battle during the Greco-Italian War (1940-41). Embarrassed that his Italian forces had not achieved conquests comparable to Nazi Germany's, Benito Mussolini decided that Greece would be an easy target for invasion. Boasting that Adolf Hitler \"will find out from the papers that I have occupied Greece,\" Mussolini launched his attack from Italian-occupied Albania on October 28, 1940. The outnumbered and outgunned Greeks won an unexpected victory in the Pindus Mountains, then drove the Italians back into Albania. By mid-December, the Greeks had seized a third of Albania, including the strategic Ionian port of Sarandë. After the Italian defeat, a dismayed Adolf Hitler was forced to invade Greece.\n\nIn December 1940 the Luftwaffe began firebombing London.

Although limited by a slow speed of 138 mph and armed with just two machine guns, the carrier-launched biplane had much to offer. It was highly maneuverable, had a range of more than 500 miles, and could carry either a 1,620-pound torpedo or the equivalent weight of bombs, mines, or depth charges. It flew with a two- or three-man crew. On November 11, 1940, 21 of these aircraft neutralized the Italian fleet at Taranto, Italy, knocking three battleships out of commission and inflicting serious destruction in general. Later, on May 26-27, 1941, the Swordfish also played a crucial part in the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck.\n\nTo follow more major events of World War II, see:\n\nCONTRIBUTING WRITERS:John S.

Hallas, Mark Johnston Ph.D., Christy Nadalin M.A., Pat Perrin, Peter Stanley Ph.D.\n\nBattle of the Atlantic\n\nFrom the war's first hours (when the German sub U-30 sank the liner Athenia) to its final days, Germany tried to cut Britain's vital seaborne supplies. Much of Britain's food and munitions and most of its fuel had to pass across the Atlantic, running the risk of attack by the Kriegsmarine's U-boat (submarine) fleet. As in World War I, when analysis showed that ships sailing in convoy had much better chances of reaching safety, the Admiralty introduced a complex convoy system.\n\nThe \"battle\" to get materials and troops from Britain's empire and dominions, as well as products of America's industrial might, to Britain was really a continuous series of related campaigns, beginning in earnest in mid-1940 when Germany's European victories gave it strategically important Atlantic bases. While surface warships and armed merchant cruisers played a part in the war at sea, by 1942 the battle was between U-boats and escorting warships and aircraft. In the winter of 1940-41, the U-boats enjoyed their first so-called \"happy time.\"\n\nBritish, Canadian, and (beginning in September 1941) United States escorts, at first pitifully few, faced aggressive and persistent U-boat activity. America's entry into the war increased the number and spread of targets, leading to a second \"happy time.\" U-boats torpedoed ships off the American East Coast before the U.S. finally introduced a convoy system and ordered a coastal blackout.\n\nChurchill confessed his fear that the U-boats might win. Only in the fall of 1943 did Allied shipbuilding exceed monthly losses. However, though they sank hundreds of ships, the submarines were too few in number to achieve real victory. Those hundreds of lost ships represented only a fraction of the Allied shipping available. But for tanker crews in midocean, the threat of a torpedo strike made the a terrifying ordeal.\n\nTechnological developments gave each side crucial and sometimes short-lived advantages, making scientists and technicians as vital as submarine and escort crews. German grand admiral Karl Dönitz directed the U-boats via high-frequency radio, transmitting orders using the Enigma code. Gradually, Allied \"boffins\" (scientific geniuses) gave the escorts a crucial technological edge in the battle against the U-boats. Asdic (a sonar system for submarines), High-frequency Direction Finding, airborne radar, and, above all, the breaking of the Enigma code gradually gave the Allies a decisive edge.\n\nThe , the war's most unremitting and crucial battle, formed the basis of the Allied victory in the European war. Control of the Atlantic enabled the Allies to hold Britain as a base for the liberation of Europe. Both sides paid a high price. Fifty thousand Allied merchant sailors died in battle, nearly matching the number of British aircrew who died bombing Germany. Successful U-boat commanders were exalted as \"aces,\" though eventually they were likely to die. Eighty percent of Germany's 1,000 operational submarines were sunk, and two-thirds of their crews perished.\n\nThe battle inspired several powerful works of art, notably Nicholas Monsarrat's novel The Cruel Sea and Wolfgang Petersen's film Das Boot."
