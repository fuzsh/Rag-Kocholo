Caban, the Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”), announced the unsealing today of an Indictment charging EDWIN CARRASQUILLO, a/k/a “Malo,” HECTOR HERNANDEZ, a/k/a “Hec,” JOSE HERNANDEZ, a/k/a “Nene,” a/k/a “Little,” NATHANIEL MANNING, a/k/a “Tio,” DAMEL MARCUS, a/k/a “Shank,” EDWARDO MORENO, a/k/a “AR,” JASON RIVERA, a/k/a “Colombo,” JOSUE VARGAS, a/k/a “Leo,” JUAN KUANG, a/k/a “Jo Jo,” a/k/a “Jay,” a/k/a “Blanco,” STEVEN SANTIAGO, a/k/a “Swizz,” VICTOR MENDENG, a/k/a “Cali,” DELILAH CARRIEL, ROSEMARIE SANCHEZ, a/k/a “Rosie,” JUAN CALDERON, a/k/a “Jazzo,” a/k/a “Juanito,” CHRISTOPHER MEADOWS, and ANGEL VILLAFANE with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, distributing narcotics, and carrying and using firearms in connection with an armed drug trafficking operation based on Valentine Avenue in the Bronx, New York, for well over a decade from 2012 to the present.\n\nCARRASQUILLO, H. HERNANDEZ, J. HERNANDEZ, MANNING, MARCUS, MORENO, VARGAS, KUANG, SANTIAGO, CARRIEL, SANCHEZ, CALDERON, and MEADOWS were arrested earlier today in an operation conducted by the FBI and NYPD, and they are expected to be presented before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave or U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo later this afternoon. MENDENG, who is detained in the custody of the New York City Department of Correction on separate charges, will be writted into federal custody at a later date. RIVERA and VILLAFANE were previously arrested and charged in prior indictments. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Today, I am announcing that we have filed charges against 16 members of a violent drug trafficking crew that for over 10 years has held a Bronx neighborhood hostage. As alleged, day in and day out, this crew distributed fentanyl, heroin, and crack along several blocks on Valentine Avenue, effectively creating an open drug market. To protect their territory, they allegedly carried guns, extorted addicts through threats of violence and, far too often, used violence against rivals and anyone else attempting to weaken their control on their block, committing multiple shootings as they fought for control over the streets. I promise that we are not going to abandon any of our communities. Our commitment to public safety will never waver — not anywhere, and not for one moment. The people of this great city deserve nothing less.”\n\nFBI Assistant Director in Charge James Smith said: “For over 12 years, as alleged, the defendants strategically organized themselves into the 'Valentine Avenue Crew' to freely distribute fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine within the Bronx. The Valentine Avenue Crew allegedly carried firearms and often used violence, including two non-fatal shootings, to maintain dominance in the narcotics trafficking industry. The FBI maintains its unwavering stance against all forms of violence and drug trafficking, and will continue to apprehend those who threaten our community’s safety.”\n\nNYPD Commissioner Edward A. Caban said: “Today’s charges demonstrate the thorough and diligent efforts of NYPD investigators and our law enforcement partners in dismantling an allegedly violent drug trafficking organization operating in New York City. We will continue to identify and hold accountable anyone who peddles dangerous substances or possesses illegal weapons in our communities. And I am grateful to our colleagues at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for their commitment to this critical public safety mission.”\n\nAs alleged in the Indictment:[1]\n\nThe defendants are charged for their involvement in an armed drug trafficking organization (the “Valentine Avenue Crew”) that took over the block of Valentine Avenue between East 194th Street and East 196th Street in the Bronx, New York (the “Block”), and its surrounding neighborhood.\n\nWorking in shifts throughout the day and night, and organized in a clear hierarchal structure, the Valentine Avenue Crew and its members, including the defendants — many of whom were typically armed with firearms and other weapons — distributed fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and cocaine base, in a form commonly known as “crack.” These narcotics were often manufactured and packaged elsewhere and then delivered to the Block, where members and associates of the Valentine Avenue Crew sold them to a large base of end-user customers. Controlling the sidewalks and street of the Block, as well as the public spaces of multiple buildings along the Block, the Valentine Avenue Crew and its members, including the defendants, operated freely, creating an open market for drugs, in which they extorted payments from customers through violence. For well over a decade, members of the Valentine Avenue Crew also used violence — including multiple shootings — to compete with rival drug traffickers, and at times within the Valentine Avenue Crew itself, to maintain dominance over the drug trade on the Block.\n\nIn addition, ANGEL VILLAFANE is charged for his commission of two non-fatal shootings in Manhattan in July 2020 and January 2021. Specifically, in or about July 2020, VILLAFANE paid a co-conspirator (“CC-1”) to lure a victim to a location in Manhattan where VILLAFANE attempted to murder the victim over a drug debt, resulting in personal injury to the victim. Additionally, on or about January 8, 2021, VILLAFANE committed another non-fatal shooting in Manhattan.\n\n* * *\n\nA chart containing the names, charges, and minimum and maximum penalties for the defendants is set forth below. The minimum and maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.\n\nMr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and NYPD and thanked the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Pennsylvania State Police for their assistance in this case.\n\nThis case is being handled by the Office’s Violent and Organized Crime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael R. Herman and Thomas John Wright are in charge of the prosecution.\n\nThe charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty."
