In every Chancellery in Europe, as well as in our own Cabinet, this part of the widespread Seven Years' War was always spoken of as the Maritime War; and it would seem that no useful apprehension of the way in which it was conducted can be attained unless it be approached from the naval side rather than from the military, as is more commonly done. The Continental theatre of the war proved so rich in brilliant actions—at sea they were so few—that this aspect of the struggle, so fertile in instruction for ourselves, has come to be somewhat unduly obscured. It is true that as an example of the trite doctrine of the influence of sea power we know it well enough. But it is not there that its living value ends. For the actual strategical use of the fleet, and for the principles and even the practice of amphibious warfare, it is as luminously informing as, in their own special sphere, are the subordinate campaigns of Frederick the Great. By this of course it is not meant that the share which the army so abundantly contributed to the result should be neglected or minimised, but only that for a right consideration of the war the army must be regarded primarily as forming an integral part of the maritime force with which it was carried on.\n\nIn endeavouring to recover the principles of the art which were so real and familiar to its old masters in those days, it has been found unavoidable to introduce a certain amount of strategical exposition. For this some apology is due to civilian readers. A less technical and more epic treatment of the great contest for maritime empire would doubtless have received a kindlier welcome. Yet in mitigation of the literary transgression it may be urged, even for those who read history for its romance, for its drama and its poetry, that surely the deepest notes of what they seek can only be heard when we watch great men of action struggling, as in some old Greek tragedy, with the inexorable laws of strategy, or riding on them in mastery to the inevitable catastrophe. That success in so presenting the story has been attained it would be mere presumption to expect. All that can be hoped is that those who have ears for the real music of a great historical theme will not resent the sober cadences, without which it cannot be developed.\n\nTo officers in the sister services I trust no apology is needed, except to express a most genuine sense of temerity in treading upon ground so full of pitfalls for a civilian. My only excuse is the ungrudging help, criticism, and encouragement which I have received from them in the course of lecturing on the subject-matter of the book at the Naval War College and elsewhere. Surely never did man learn more folly the truth of the old adage, Homines dum docent discunt. I would only beg that if any technical merits be found they may be set down to them. The errors are assuredly my own.\n\nTo Captain E. J. Warre Slade, R.N., lately Captain of the War College, and now Director of Naval Intelligence, I owe in this sense more than I can well express With his ever-ready assistance every point in the story has been thrashed out, and it is not too much to say that without the support of his broad knowledge of the art of war, and his sure judgment, the task would have been beyond my powers.\n\nIt is impossible, moreover, to let this attempt—such as it is — go from my hands without acknowledging the deep debt I owe to M. Richard Waddington and his entirely admirable work on La Guerre de Sept Ans. Unfortunately it is not yet finished, and probably none can appreciate its extraordinary value quite in the same way as one who lost its sure guidance in the midst of a diplomatic wilderness.\n\nSecond only to this obligation is my debt to Mr. Doughty and his almost exhaustive monograph on the Siege of Quebec. To this would be added Miss Kemball’s Correspondence of William Pitt with Colonial Governors, &c. in America, but for the fact that it was not accessible until this part of my work was completed. For this reason it will seldom be found quoted in the notes, though almost all the documents cited for the American theatre are to be found in its pages.\n\nFor new material my gratitude is above all due to the Marquis of Lansdowne, who most generously and with every facility permitted me to consult the invaluable Viri-Solar correspondence in his possession. Without access to this series of documents it would have been practically impossible to give anything like an adequate view of the final negotiations for peace.\n\nWith regard to other manuscript sources it may be said, for those who are unfamiliar with our records, that the Newcastle and Hardwicke Papers, and all others cited from the Additional MSS. are in the British Museum. Documents cited as Chatham Papers are from the manuscript collection of Pitt's correspondence, &c, deposited in the hands of the Historical MSS. Commissioners at the Record Office, and they are to be distinguished from the selection of them in the Chatham Correspondence, edited by Taylor and Pringle in 1840. Similarly, the Mitchell Papers in the British Museum are to be distinguished from the selection printed in the Mitchell Memoirs by Bissett in 1850. The references to Bedford, Grenville, and Rockingham papers are all to the printed editions. The diplomatic, colonial, naval, and military despatches and official papers are in the Record Office, classed respectively as State Papers Foreign, State Papers Colonial, Admiralty Secretary In and Out-Letters, War Office In and Out-Letters. In the same place will be found the ships' Logs and officers' Journals (Admiral’s and Captains'), Intercepted Correspondence, Secret Orders, &c. Scholars will note with reprehension that some of these papers are quoted not from the originals, but from official copies in the Newcastle or other correspondence. For this I can plead no defence, except the amenities and prompt service of the Manuscript Room of the British Museum as compared with the lingering discomforts (to say no more) of the sepulchre provided for students at the Record Office, aggravated by the prohibition of ink.\n\nIn preparing the index, for which I have to thank Mr. Herbert E. Corbett, a special aim has been to render it of service for biographical reference, and it will sometimes be found of assistance where the rank or position of an officer or statesman mentioned in the text is not sufficiently explained for those unfamiliar with the period.\n\nMAPS AND PLANS\n\nPART OF NORTH AMERICA—Showing British, French, and Spanish possessions at the opening of the War.\n\nMINORCA\n\nROCHEFORT AND THE BASQUE ROADS\n\nST MALO AND ENVIRONS\n\nLOUISBOURG AND NEIGHBOURHOOD\n\nINDIA— Showing principal British, French, and Dutch Factories in 1756\n\nWEST INDIES IN 1756 —Showing British, French, Spanish, and Dutch possessions.\n\nTHE FRENCH ANTILLES\n\nPART OF THE ST.

Opinions, it is true, will always differ as to how far history can be of practical value for such a purpose at all It can be argued, with at least some show of reason, that the revolution which has taken place in naval material during recent years has put the old wars out of court. Yet, no matter to what greater or less extent that view may be tenable, there must still remain one part of the subject that such changes can never affect; and it is here the Seven Years' War stands in our history without a rival.\n\nReaching higher and wider than what is usually understood by naval strategy, it is a branch of the art as vital for statesmen as it is for sailors, for diplomatists as it is for soldiers, and by history alone can it be mastered. We may term it the function of the fleet in war. Marshalled in its place in the art of war, it will be seen to form, together with the functions of the army and diplomacy, a part of what is called the higher or major strategy, and to bear much the same relation to naval strategy as minor strategy does to tactics. For naval strategy, which is commonly and conveniently confined to the movements of the fleet in a theatre of war, is really a form of minor strategy; and while tactics are concerned with the arena of a battle, and minor strategy with the arena of a campaign, so the study of the functions of the fleet is concerned with the whole arena of an international struggle.\n\nHow widely it differs from simple naval strategy a practical illustration will show. Naval strategy is studied on a chart. To solve its problems we note the conformation of coast-lines, we note the lie of strategical positions, of naval bases, of the courses and converging points of trade routes; we measure sea distances and add up naval units, and eliminating moral frictions the factors of our problems are complete. But in the study of the functions of a fleet a chart is useless. It cuts off our vision just where the most obscure and difficult part of the study begins. For it is behind the coast-line that are at work the dominant factors by which the functions of a fleet are determined. The whole study of them is based on the relations of the coast-lines to the lines of land communication, to the diplomatic tensions and the political centres of the struggle, to the lines and theatres of military operations ashore. For the study, therefore, of the functions of a fleet, charts will not suffice. It is a map we want, upon which both land and sea are shown, a map in which the political features are at least as prominently marked as the physical.\n\nThe difference and relation between the two studies may be stated in yet another way. Naval strategy studied on a chart is comparable to pure mathematics. It seta itself as it were upon a clean slate to solve certain problems of naval warfare, without regard to the deflecting influences of military or diplomatic considerations. The usual definitions display it as concerned with obtaining command of the sea, with combinations for overpowering the enemy's main fleet and the like. All this is right enough on occasions, but only on occasions, and the occasions are rare. It is very seldom we have had a clean slate to work on—never indeed for long except in purely maritime wars, waged for a purely maritime object, such as were our wars in the seventeenth century with the Dutch. As an episode the clean slate may also occur in mixed wars, but only as a passing episode: that is, there may be moments in the most complex war when the destruction of the enemy's main fleet and the securing of the command of a certain sea may be of an importance so great and pressing that naval action may rightly be left free to concern itself with nothing else, and every consideration of diplomatic and military operations must rest subservient to naval strategy. When such rare moments occur, they are invariably so dazzling in their dramatic intensity as to dull our vision of what they really mean and how they were brought about. The imagination comes naturally to concentrate itself upon such supreme catastrophes and to forget that war is not made up of them. Historians, greedy of dramatic effect, encourage such concentrations of attention, and the result is that the current conception of the functions of a fleet is dangerously narrowed, and our best minds cramp their strategical view by assuming unconsciously that the sole function of a fleet is to win battles at sea. That this is the supreme function of a fleet is certain, and it must never be lost sight of; but on the other hand it must not be forgotten that convenient opportunities of winning a battle do not always occur when they are wanted. The great dramatic moments of naval strategy have to be worked for, and the first preoccupation of the fleet will almost always be to bring them about by interference with the enemy's military and diplomatic arrangements.\n\nAn illustration will serve best to exhibit the matter more clearly. The War of the Spanish Succession, as it was regarded at the time, was a war to decide whether or not the Mediterranean was to be a Bourbon lake under the control of France. At first sight it would appear that such a war was peculiarly the province of naval strategy—in other words, that it was a question of securing the command of the sea by the destruction of the enemy's fleets. But William the Third, with his remarkable grasp of the higher strategy, saw further. He saw that the permanent control of that sea was a question of naval and military positions, and that the first and most pressing function of the fleet was, not to defeat the enemy's fleet, but to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Both objects would, of course, have been obtained by a decisive naval victory. But France, being inferior in naval force, was careful to give no opportunity for such a victory. She assumed a strict defensive which placed her fleets beyond our reach, and we were forced to secure the vital positions in the face of her undefeated navy. No sooner was this done than France found herself forced to break her defensive, and the battle of Malaga was the result. Tactically it was indecisive, but it was enough to show France that she was powerless to recover the ground she had lost, and it caused her to abandon all serious naval effort. Here, then, was a case where all the advantages of the command of the sea were gained by a bold move in the face of a fleet in being, and retained without ever defeating that fleet. The defeat of the enemy's fleet was clearly not the first object of our naval activity. The function which the fleet was sent out to discharge was primarily diplomatic, and the enemy's fleet was to be ignored so long as it did not interfere.\n\nFrom such instances as these, and they are many, it is evident that we require for the guidance of our naval policy and naval action something of wider vision than the current conception of naval strategy, something that will keep before our eyes not merely the enemy's fleets or the great routes of commerce, or the command of the sea, but also the relations of naval policy and action to the whole area of diplomatic and military effort. Of late years the world has become so deeply impressed with the efficacy of sea power that we are inclined to forget how impotent it is of itself to decide a war against great Continental states, how tedious is the pressure of naval action unless it be nicely co-ordinated with military and diplomatic pressure. It was fifteen years after the defeat of the Armada before we could obtain peace with Spain, even on the status quo ante helium. It was ten years after Trafalgar before revolutionary France accepted defeat. We English, wrote Nelson in the Gulf of Genoa, where he was first brought face to face with the ultimate problems of his art, we English have to regret that we cannot always decide the fate of Empires on the sea.{1}\n\nCertainly it is still a fact to be regretted, and for that reason also a fact never to be forgotten in naval policy. Nor need we ever lose hold of so vital a truth if, instead of endeavouring to find our formula for naval strategy deductively, we turn to history, that is, to past experience of great wars, and find out what actually happened. Instead of cramping our outlook by well-turned definitions, let us inquire of history what in past wars the functions of the fleet have actually been, what the actual objects for which it has been employed. For all that long series of wars which gave Great Britain first her position in Europe, and then in the world, the answer is simple and constant. The function of the fleet, the object for which it was always employed, has been threefold: firstly, to support or obstruct diplomatic effort; secondly, to protect or destroy commerce; and thirdly, to further or hinder military operations ashore. Here, then, we get a formula widely different from the current definitions of naval strategy. The distorting influence of the enemy's main fleet is reduced as it becomes obvious that we have to think of many things beyond securing the command of the sea. We begin to distinguish more clearly between the means and the end of naval policy. In most cases it is true that to secure the command of the sea by destroying the enemy's fleets is the best way of ensuring that your own fleet will be in a position to discharge its threefold functions. But the historical method reveals at once that the command of the sea is only a means to an end. It never has been, and never can be, the end itself. Yet obvious as this is, it is constantly lost sight of in naval policy. We forget what really happened in the old wars; we blind ourselves by looking only on the dramatic moments of naval history; we come unconsciously to assume that the defeat of the enemy's fleets solves all problems, and that we are always free and able to apply this apparently simple solution. Thus, until quite recent years, naval thought had tended to confine itself to the perfection of the weapon and to neglect the art of using it. Or, in other words, it had come to feel its sole concern was fighting, and had forgotten the art of making war.\n\nNow, as Nelson lamented, where great empires are concerned, wars cannot be concluded upon the sea. Such wars cannot be made by fleets alone. But just as land operations demand the co-operation and just co-ordination of horse, foot, and artillery, and as sea operations demand the co-operation and just co-ordination of battleships, cruisers, and flotillas, so are great wars conducted by the ordered combination of naval, military, and diplomatic force. Thus naval strategy, so long as it merely contemplates bringing the enemy's fleet to successful action and securing the command of the sea, may often miss its most potent line of energy, and operating as it were single-handed, it may fail to achieve a point in the war which combined or co-ordinated action would have given it. An admiral with no wider outlook than to regard the enemy's fleet as his primary objective will miss his true relation to the other forces which are working for a successful issue of the war; he will be unable to see all the conditions of the problem before him in their true proportions; and will be unable to construe his orders or to decide in an unforeseen situation with a thorough grasp of the common object Hence the importance of approaching the study of maritime warfare not from the point of view of what is usually understood by naval strategy, but from the wider standpoint of the functions of the fleet.\n\nIt is for this purpose that the Seven Years' War has so high a value. During the world-wide struggle in which the main lines of the British Empire were finally laid down, we were from first to last in marked superiority at sea to our enemy. From first to last we were more or less free to use the fleet directly upon the ulterior objects of the war, and throughout the struggle what are called the primary functions—that is, the domination of the enemy's main fleet—scarcely ever rose above the level of containing operations. Thus, at least from the time when Pitt obtained control of the war, its conduct exhibits the diverse functions of the fleet in full or co-ordinated activity. He was a true War Minister with almost undisturbed control of army, navy, and diplomacy, and in his hands we see the fleet slipping neatly into its place, shoulder to shoulder with its comrades. It is never used without some close relation to a military or diplomatic end, and conversely the army and diplomacy are always being worked to secure some point which will either strengthen the naval position or relieve the fleet of some irksome preoccupation. Here lay the pith of what Pitt called his system. Assured of his practical superiority at sea, he permitted no pedantic insistence on the primary naval objective. There was no waiting till the enemy's mobile sea forces were absolutely disposed of before the army was put in action. For Pitt army and navy were the blade and hilt of one weapon, and from the moment the weapon was in his grip he began to demonstrate the force and reach of his method. Not only was he able without destroying the enemy's naval force to strike beyond the ocean at the ulterior object, but at home he was able to break down the time-honoured strategy of France, and force her, by goading her into a desperate attempt at invasion, to deliver her main fleets into his hands.\n\nIt is all a most brilliant lesson of the way in which the weak army of a strong naval power can be used, of how great Continental armies may be made to feel the shock of fleets, and of how mere superiority at sea may be made to thwart Continental cabinets, to tangle their strategy and upset their moral balance. It was a lesson all too soon forgotten. In the last great struggle with revolutionary France and Napoleon, nothing is more exasperating than the way in which Ministers let slip and misused opportunities such as were the very breath of Pitt's system. Yet that oblivion is scarcely surprising when we think with what violence Pitt had to force his views on his colleagues and his King. Indeed it would seem that it was only the instinct of the people for amphibious warfare that enabled him to carry his point. That instinct was behind him, and possibly it was that which at first set in motion his opposition to what was called the Continental school rather than any well-reasoned strategical convictions. But it is abundantly clear from the despatches of the time that he very soon came to see clearly how true the instinct was, and upon what sound strategical reasons it was based. And so it came about that of all our wars there is none beside Pitt's war which is so radiant with the genius of a maritime state, and none which was so uniformly successful.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nNATURE AND OBJECT OF THE WAR\n\nA MOST ill-judged advertisement from the War Office has set all the ministers on fire and made them believe we are going to war, which is, I hope, the furthest from our thoughts. So on October 10, 1754, the Duke of Newcastle, First Lord of the Treasury to King George the Second, wrote to the Earl of Albemarle, his ambassador in Paris. The latest news from America had been so serious that the Government had resolved secretly to reinforce the Colonial garrisons, and the War Office had let the secret out. So Albemarle was urged to represent the measures that were being taken as purely defensive, and to do all he could to preserve the peace, consistently with the necessary measures for securing our position in North America. Excuse this free letter, Newcastle concluded in apology for disturbing the suavity of diplomatic intercourse with so much earnestness, but we are on a precipice. I am sure you will keep us out if you can, and I think you may.\n\nHow far Newcastle saw into the precipice that yawned at his feet, it is difficult to say, but in its depths lay that mighty drama, which George Washington had already opened in the obscurity of the Ohio solitudes, and which he was to end in triumph before all the world with his Declaration of Independence. What Newcastle saw was much less. For him the last news meant that the violence of the English and French Colonial authorities had given an ugly turn to certain negotiations which had been leisurely progressing ever since the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had brought the War of the Austrian Succession to an end in 1748. That peace, which purported to settle so much, and which practically settled nothing even in Europe, had left everything that mattered undecided in America. The Plenipotentiaries had washed their hands of the dull and obscure questions at issue between France and England in the Far West by leaving the frontier between Nova Scotia and Canada to be defined subsequently, and by constituting as a neutral buffer between Canada and New England an ill-defined tract of Indian territory which stretched down indeterminately into the hinterland of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Such an arrangement was, of course, no better than leaving the colonists to fight it out amongst themselves, and this they incontinently set to work to do, while a Delimitation Commission pretended to be doing the work more decently at home.\n\nWith the rights and wrongs of the two cases, founded as they were on Indian treaties, prior discovery, trading rights, and all the paraphernalia of what we now call peaceful penetration, we have nothing to do. Out of the mountains of papers in which the question was reduced to impenetrable obscurity, one fact emerges which alone is material. From causes which are above all war and diplomacy and peaceful penetration, the position for which France was striving was absolutely impossible. On the one hand were the dreaming settlements of the French thinly spread along the banks of the St. Lawrence, and occupied by a poor and sparse population, content in idyllic submission to priests and officials. On the other the restless, almost rebellious British Colonies along the Atlantic seaboard, by comparison with Canada thriving, populous, and enterprising, each playing strenuously for its own hand, seething with the movement of well-established adolescence, and pressing by sheer force of a natural expansion farther and farther into the interior. Yet this force, which we can now see to have been as irresistible as the tide, it was the dream of France to stem by fine-drawn arguments that had no real foundation, and trivial military movements which she had no means of supporting. The grandiose scheme which Galissonière, her sailor governor, had conceived, was based on her claim to the whole basin of the Mississippi—a claim which she founded on having been the first to navigate its waters, and which she asserted by the sickly little settlement of New Orléans at its mouth. Could New Orléans be connected with Montreal by a chain of posts, the whole of this vast territory which formed the hinterland of the English Colonies would be occupied effectively, according to French ideas, and Virginia and the rest would be cut off from all further growth.\n\nHow often since the period of Imperial expansion began has France found herself too late, and how often has she sought to recover her ground by such imaginative schemes. When she had roused herself to take her place in the great game that was beginning, she had found England in possession of all that was worth having along the North American coast. Unobtrusive forces had been at work of which she had taken no note till too late, and it was just these forces which Galissonière’s great dream ignored. Yet there is something in the spirit that can conceive, and not only conceive but steadfastly work for such lofty purposes, that compels admiration. Again and again it has been the lot of England to bring such schemes to ruin, and yet, brutal as has been the process of destruction compared with what it destroyed, we still and always have a bow for the men of ideas and their wide-flung strategic conceptions.\n\nThe weak point of the French design was, as we have said, that it took no count of the unruly forces that had forestalled their own endeavours. Indeed it was characteristic of the logical French mind to ignore what had not been reduced to logical form, and the forces that lay squandering in disorder amongst the English Colonies were as formless as the wind. Yet they were there vigorous, if blind as ever, and it was inevitable that sooner or later the acute insinuation of the French would reach a point where it would be felt like the stab of a goad, and those forces would begin to take order and direction.\n\nThe last news from America was that such a point had been reached. It was just the point where a more practical strategy, taking higher account of men than maps, would have seen Galissonière's scheme must break down. The weak link in the French chain was in that wedge of country which lies between the converging lines of Lake Erie and the Alleghany Mountains, and through which flow the Bull River, the Alleghany, and the Monongahela, till they meet in the head waters of Ohio, at the point where Pittsburg now stands. From New Orléans north-eastward to this point by way of the Mississippi and its great tributary all was plain sailing, and so it was from Montreal south-westward by the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario to Lake Erie. But between the southern shore of Lake Erie and the head waters of the Ohio lay a danger zone that had to be made good, and it was just at this point that the English Colonies of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania pressed most closely into the French design.\n\nIn the (spring of 1753 the Marquis Duquesne had come out as governor, in succession to Galissonière, with instructions to do all he could to clear the English out of the disputed region, and had sent an expedition to secure the head waters of the Ohio.{2} It did not reach its objective, but succeeded in establishing a fort at Presquisle, on the shores of Lake Erie, close to where the Bull River begins its course to the Ohio. Advancing down the Bull River they established two more posts, expelling or taking prisoner the English traders whom they found in their way. Now it so happened that these same traders were mostly agents of the English Ohio Company, which was engaged in opening up a trade route to the great lakes, and its principal shareholders were the magnates of Virginia and Maryland, who had a concession of the Indian trade from the Crown. Here then was the inevitable jar. Duquesne's scientific penetration had come in conflict with the stubborn commercial spirit of his rivals, and the plot thickened fast. While the French, elated by their success, advanced to the Alleghany River and established a post there, George Washington was sent to protest, and Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, prepared to despatch a military force into the Ohio basin to prevent any fresh posts being established by the French. Washington's mission was of course a failure, and as a counter-move the colony of Virginia voted £10,000 for a force to establish a fort at the head of the Ohio. By April 1754 the force had reached its destination, and was hard at work upon the fort from which Pittsburg was to spring, when they were surprised by the French advancing in superior force down the Alleghany and were compelled to retire. On the half-finished works of the British the French founded their famous Fort Duquesne, and the last link of their chain was forged. Obviously it must be broken at once, and without more ado Washington, at the head of the Virginian forces, attacked the French commander. His strength was as inadequate, his equipment as imperfect as was to be expected. He was forced to retreat and finally to surrender at Fort Necessity, on the western slopes of the Alleghanies. This was the news which had forced from the Duke of Newcastle his free letter to Lord Albemarle, and it was no wonder. For, though no one yet grasped it, the Seven Tears' War had begun.\n\nIt is an easy exercise, and one in which historians and others have freely indulged themselves, to contrast the triumphant manner in which Pitt waged the war at its zenith with the lame opening of Newcastle. No reflections, while being broadly justified, could be more misleading. Because Pitt's methods were heroic in their direct and ruthless energy beside the well-bred decorum of Newcastle's, we are apt to assume that as a War Minister Newcastle was wholly ridiculous. In his methods perhaps he was, but not in the broad lines of his strategy. In them, so far at least as his opening moves were concerned, there is little to condemn; and as for the energy of his measures, the wonder is that, seeing how lowering was the horizon against which he saw the Ohio affair projected, he went to work as strenuously as he did.\n\nTo judge Newcastle aright, and derive from his conduct the full instruction that it contains, we must rigidly forget everything that happened afterwards, and try to see the situation exactly as it presented itself to a statesman of average ability in the autumn of 1754. Turn back to his letter to Albemarle; we get the pith of the difficulty at once. To English eyes, whatever else was in dispute, it was absolutely beyond question that we had the right to trade in the buffer Indian territory. The behaviour of Duquesne's expedition in the Ohio valley was therefore unpardonable, and in face of such an outrage Newcastle could not but believe, as he told. Albemarle, that it must have arisen from the enterprising genius of the French governors, and possibly not from orders from home. This was the first point to decide. It was hoped that the measures already determined on would clear the situation. General Braddock was under orders to proceed to America as Commander-in-chief, with two regiments of the line, to stiffen the Colonial defence. At the same time the local forces were to be increased, and Albemarle was to watch the effect of the step on the French Government. It is clear that Newcastle hoped the firmness that was being shown would bring a disavowal from the Court of Versailles. If it failed to do so, the next step was one of extreme difficulty; for, as Newcastle anxiously explained to Albemarle, if the French endorsed Duquesne's action, it would be a highly delicate matter to expel his men by force. If that were done, as the troubled Minister wrote, We then begin the war.\n\nIt is these words that contain the crux of the whole situation, the explanation of the halting way in which we seem to have entered the war, and beneath them lies one of its most valuable lessons, how military and naval strategy are confused and deflected by political considerations. Till their meaning is fully grasped, it is impossible to do justice to Newcastle and the strategy of his expert advisers, who were amongst the wisest and most experienced we ever had—Granville and Hardwicke, Anson and Boscawen, Cumberland and Ligonier. They also bring home to us, when rightly understood, the living interest of the war, and show it to us in an essentially modern aspect To-day we have grown accustomed to the abiding fear lest some far-off Colonial rivalry between two nations may serve to throw the delicately balanced machinery of international relations out of gear and drag the whole world into war. So great and well-known is the danger now that the highest diplomacy of our own day is perhaps the art of isolating such disputes. It was scarcely less so then; and when Newcastle wrote that anxious phrase, We then begin the war his eyes were fixed on the lowering cloud that hung over Europe, knowing well how easily the most distant disturbance might cause it to burst into uncontrollable storm.\n\nIt was but six years since the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had brought the last general war to its restless conclusion, and it was fresh in the minds of European statesmen that that tangled struggle had begun in a Colonial quarrel between England and Spain. It was generally felt that the peace was no better than an armed truce that contented nobody—nobody, indeed, except perhaps Frederick the Great, to whom at Austria's expense was confirmed his ill-gotten conquest of Silesia. But that scarcely made matters better, for it was round Silesia that the most dangerous storm-centre lay. The contentment of Frederick was really the most disturbing fact of the situation, and was only another word for the aggrandisement of Prussia, and Austria's thirst for revenge. Indeed the rise of the new military monarchy to the rank of a first-rate power, with no preoccupation in its foreign policy but an almost savage instinct of self-preservation, was the fresh and most incalculable factor in the situation.\n\nAs for France, she had reasons for resenting the peace only less galling than those of Austria. During the war she had succeeded in gaining the object of her traditional policy by making a thorough conquest of the Netherlands. But far away beyond the Atlantic, English colonists had torn from her grasp Cape Breton Island and Louisbourg. Now Louisbourg was to France and her Canadian possessions what Port Arthur recently was for Russia in the Far East. It was absolutely necessary for her Colonial future to regain it, and the price she had to pay for re-entry was the retrocession of the Netherlands. Hard as the bargain seemed to France, it was scarcely less welcome to England, while by the New Englanders, who, with the aid of the Royal Navy, had made the invaluable conquest, it was deeply resented. They knew well enough that, so long as the Mother Country was dominant at sea, the possession of Louisbourg placed the whole of the French possessions on the St. Lawrence at their mercy, and they could not see what they gained by sacrificing it in order that Austria might regain the Netherlands. It was difficult to see that it was all a question of naval policy, that it was surrendering a naval position of comparatively small value, except offensively, for others that were indispensable for defence. It may almost be said that the dominant note of English foreign policy from time immemorial had been to prevent either France or Spain securing naval stations beyond the Straits of Dover. It is upon what may be called the virginity of the Dover defile that the strength of England's maritime position depends, and no other conceivable naval position could be too valuable to sacrifice so that this one might be preserved intact. Thus, though it seemed that Austria gained by recovering her Netherlands and the Flemish ports, it was really England who gained, and the Colonies, whose security depended on the integrity of the Mother Country's naval position in the Narrow Seas.\n\nIn surveying the situation in Europe, if we would understand the feelings of Newcastle and the British Government as they stood on the brink of the precipice, no point is more important than this. Unless it is kept firmly in mind, it is impossible to trace the subtle thread of English naval policy through the Continental phases of the struggle. The instinct for keeping France from any naval outlet in the North Sea was, as we have noted, the main tradition of English foreign policy. It was at the root of the old Burgundian alliance, and it was at the root of that triple alliance with Holland and Austria with which William the Third and his pupil Marlborough had worked the levers of Europe. It was at the root of that strangely unstable arrangement known as the Barrier Fortresses, and it was at the root of that galling condition of peace which we had twice wrung from France that she should destroy the port and defences of Dunkirk. Both these arrangements were the source of perpetual irritation, and it is the strongest evidence of the importance which England attached to their object that she should have insisted on forcing such humiliating terms upon two of the first powers in Europe."
