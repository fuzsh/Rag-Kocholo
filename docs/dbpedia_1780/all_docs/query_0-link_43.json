        "text": "This is dataset features information on the battles in the Seven Years' War as displayed on Wikipedia. Each battle has various attributes, including combatants, location, time, and theater of war. Dataset is inspired by Tomek's Battles of Hundred Year's War.\n\nList of Attributes:\n\nName: Categorical\n\nTheater: Categorical\n\nDate: Ordinal\n\nYear: Ordinal\n\nCombatant: Categorical\n\nComebatant2: Categorical\n\nState/Location of Action\n\nOutcome: Categorical\n\nQuestions/Task:\n\nIs there a way to show the worldwide scale of the war?\n\nHow did all of the different battle theaters play their part in this conflict?\n\nWhich location saw the most of the conflict?\n\n(With some extra data)\n\nWhich battles were most fundamental to the war effort?\n\nIs it possible to see the development and progress of the war visual? (visually see France's defeat)\n\nThis dataset definitely needs some cleaning and improvement; however, I think it could lead to an interesting visualization."
