Twenty-four B-24s from 93rd Group and 66 B-17s from the 97th, 301st and 306th Groups were dispatched to attack the U-boat base at Lorient. Of the 90 bombers dispatched, 15 B-17s from the 97th Group reached the target area dropping 60,000 lbs. H.E. bombs over or in the vicinity of the target area, and the balance were abortive. Five B-17s were damaged by enemy aircraft or flak, and 3 were lost (97th) Thirty crew members are either missing or prisoners of war, one was seriously wounded and four were slightly wounded. The 97th Group claimed ten enemy aircraft destroyed, four probably destroyed and three damaged. 2. Seventeen B-17s from 92nd Group were dispatched to conduct a diversionary raid on the Cherbourg-Maupertus Airdrome. Eight of the B-17s dropped 16,000 lbs. H.E. Bombs on or in the vicinity of the target area. None of the B-17s were lost or damaged and none of our personnel was lost or wounded. There were no encounters with enemy aircraft. * All figures in this report as to bombs dropped \"Over or In the Vicinity of the Target Area\" are based on claims of crews as to the disposition made of the bombs carried, and do not purport to represent in any sense a measure of the bombing accuracy or of the damage inflicted.\n\n- 1 -\n\nDETAILS OF OPERATIONS AGAINST LORIENT SUBMARINE BASE\n\n1. Target Objective: (a) Primary Target: The primary target was the Submarine Pens at Lorient/Keroman. The pens have been constructed in three blocks, the Northern of 7 pens 400' x 50' each, and the Southern of 7 pens 541' x 475' (overall dimension) on the land west of the Long Basin. The blocks are made of reinforced concrete with roofs approximately 11 1/2 ft. thick, and outside walls of about 8 ft. 3 ins. thickness. The pens will accommodate about 23 U-boats. (b) Secondary Target: The secondary target, which was not attacked, was the submarine base at Brest. (c) Last Resort Target: The last resort target, which also was not attacked, was vessels in several areas in the port of St. Malo. 2. Combat Order. Combat order No, 36, dated October 20, 1942, from the Commanding General VIII Bomber Command to the Commanding Officers of the first Bomb Wing, 11th Combat Crew Replacement Center, VIII Fighter Command and 10 (Fighter) Group RAF, was divided into two parts. The first part related to the diversionary operation and the second to the raid on Lorient. The second part specified the targets heretofore mentioned and ordered a raid on October 21, 1942, by (1) 24 B-24s from 93rd Group (2) 24 B-17s from 97th Group (3) 24 B-17s from 301st Group and (4) 18 B-17s from 306th Group. The bombing times were (1) 93rd Group - 1254; (2) 301st Group - 1317; (3) 306th Group - 1327. No time was mentioned for the 97th Group; from Start Point to Isle de Groix and thence to target. Specified Route to and from Target: All Groups from their home bases remaining below 10,000 ft. to 10 miles south of Bath, continuing on course to Start Point at the following times and altitudes (1) 93rd Group 17,000 ft. 1200 hours (2) 301st Group 18,000 ft. 1205 hours (3) 306th Group 19,000 ft. 1210 hours, from that Point to Isle de Groix and thence to target. After bombing turn left proceeding to home base via 5 miles west of Lannien, maintaining bombing altitudes until half way across the Channel.\n\n- 2 -\n\nSpecified Fighter Escort: Three squadrons of Spitfire IX to join the 93rd Group over Isle de Batz at 1231 and to furnish close escort to and from the target. Two squadrons of P-38s to rendezvous over Start Point at 23,000 ft. with the 306th Group at 1235 and to furnish close escort to and from the target. Three squadrons of Spitfire IX to furnish rear support, and to meet the 301st Group five miles west of Lannion on the return route. Three squadrons of Spitfires to attempt to assist any unit in difficulty and to escort the last Group to the Start Point. 3. Route Followed. The bombers took off between 1015 and 1102 proceeding to ten miles south of Bath towards Isle de Batz. All aircraft - bombers and fighters - except for the 97th Group turned back about forty-five miles from the English coast and before reaching Ile de Batz. The 97th Group continued from Isle de Batz to Nevez and thence to the target making their bombing runs from 1000 - 1120 M at 17,500 ft. at approximately 1305 hours. The bombers returned via a point five miles west of Lannion to home base, arriving at 1511 hrs. 4. Weather. The weather forecast was: \"Bases: 6/10 cumulus with bases at 2 to 3 thousand feet. High cloud becoming evident. Visibility 12 miles or better. Target: 4 to 6/10 cloud with bases at 4,000 feet. Visibility 4 to 6 miles\". Intelligence Narrative No. 14 - Day Operations 21 October, 1942, reports weather conditions encountered as follows: \"At time of take-off heavy overcast at 27,500; lowering rapidly to 19,000 over the French coast and target area. Weather over target was 3/10 - 4/10 clouds, 7,000 to 8,000 feet with top layer 18,000 to 20,000 feet\".\n\n- 3 -\n\n5. Fighter Support. At the time the fighter squadrons that were to form the close escort arrived at the place of rendezvous, they saw the bombers about 10 miles ahead but soon lost sight of them in the clouds and contact was never made. The three Spitfire squadrons that were to furnish cover support flew to Isle de Batz at 17,000 ft., swept the Merlaix Lannions area but saw no bombers and no enemy aircraft. The Spitfire squadrons that were to furnish the rear support proceeded to rendezvous but did not see any of the bombers. They also returned without encountering any enemy aircraft. 6. Aircraft Participating and Bomb Load. (a) Aircraft Participating: Sixty-six B-17s (21 from 97th Group, 25 from 301st Group and 20 from 306th Group) and 24 B-24s (93rd Group) participated in this operation. Fifteen B-17s (97th Group) dropped their bombs on or in the vicinity of the target area. All other aircraft failed to reach the target objectives. (b) Abortives: As to 75 aircraft (24 from 93rd Group, 6 from 97th, 25 from 301st, and 20 from 306th) the mission was abortive. Six of these aircraft (3 from 93rd Group, 1 from 97th Group and 2 from 301st Group) had mechanical failures, 64 (21 from 93rd Group, 23 from 301st Group and 20 from 306th Group) turned back due to bad weather, 2 (97th Group) were recalled and 3 (97th Group) failed to reach the target due to enemy action. (c) Bomb Load Expenditures: A total of 462,600 lbs. H.E. Bombs were carried as follows: 93rd Group - 153,600 (96 X 1600 0.08 sec. tail fuse) 97th Group - 84,000 (42 x 2000 0.1 sec. fuse) 301st Group - 125,000 (125 x 1000 0.1 sec. fuse) 306th Group - 100,000 (200 x 500 0.1 sec. fuse)\n\n- 4 -\n\nThere were dropped over or in the vicinity of the target area: 97th Group - 60,000 lbs. HE (30 x 2000) There were jettisoned: 93rd Group - 153,600 lbs. HE (96 X 1600) 97th Group - 12,000 lbs. HE (6 x 2000) 301st Group - 125,000 lbs. HE (125 x 1000) 306th Group - 100,000 lbs. HE (200 x 500) There were unaccounted for: 97th Group - 12,000 lbs. HE (6 x 2000) 7. Results Achieved. (a) As to Target Objectives: From C.I.U. Reports (Interpretation Report No. SA.154 dated 23.10.42, Immediate Interpretation Report No. K.1421 dated 26.10.42) and photographs taken during and after the raid, it appears that the roof of the central block of the pens was pitted in several places but not pierced; small sheds immediately to the south and west of the central block of the pens were destroyed; the railway line on the east side of the workshops was damaged; and two small floating docks were probably damaged. Approximately twenty-seven bomb bursts have been identified. Of these, eight were within a radius of 500 ft. from the aiming point (a point between the northern and central block of pens), thirteen were between 500 and 1,000 ft., one between 1,000 ft. and 3,000 ft. and five between 3,000 and 4,000 ft. from the aiming point. Of the thirty bombs dropped over or in the vicinity of the target area, three bombs or their craters cannot be located. (b) As to Enemy Aircraft: As a result of encounters with enemy aircraft (all by 97th) it is claimed that 10 enemy aircraft, probably FW 190s, were destroyed and an additional 4 probably destroyed, and 3 damaged. Approximately 36 FW 190s are said to have participated in the encounters.\n\n- 5 -\n\n8.Flak Defenses. Some 8 to 10 anti-aircraft batteries were observed three miles north of the target and on the west bank of the river. Their fire was inaccurate, being several thousand feet short as to range. Two or three other batteries were observed in the target area but could not be definitely located. From St.Nichel-Greve - Perros to Guired numerous heavy flak bursts were observed which, though generally accurate as to height, caused little or no damage. 9.Cost to Our Aircraft and Personnel. (a) Aircraft: Three B-17s (97th) suffered Class A damage, one as a result of enemy aircraft, the remaining two by either enemy aircraft or flak. Two B-17s (97th) suffered C Class damage from enemy aircraft.* Three B-17s are missing as a result of encounters with enemy aircraft. (b) Personnel: The crews from three B-17s are either missing or prisoners of war (20 missing and 10 prisoners of war). In addition, one waist-gunner was seriously wounded and two waist-gunners, one tail-gunner and one radio operator were slightly wounded. All casualties were from the 97th Group.\n\n- II -\n\nDETAILS OF THE OPERATIONS AGAINST CHERBOURG-MAUPERTUS AIRDROME\n\n1. Target Objectives. (a) Primary Target: The primary target was the Cherbourg-Maupertus airdrome located 6-3/4 miles East of Cherbourg and 3/4 mile S.E. of Maupertus. There are two dispersal areas one East with twenty-three shelters and the other West with twenty-six shelters. There are two small repair hangars, one at each dispersal area. The airdrome has been constantly used by fighter aircraft and can be used in an emergency by bomber type planes. * The information as to cause of damage in instances where definitely stated is taken from \"Mission 21 October - A-4 Report on Battle Damage\".\n\n- 6 -"
