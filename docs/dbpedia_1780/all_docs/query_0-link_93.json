        "text": "Battle of Sandwich, battle that took place in the Strait of Dover on August 24, 1217, that saved England from French occupation, but it has also gone down in history as the first battle fought by sailing ships in the open sea. It is also known as the Battle of Dover.\n\nKing John of England had clashed regularly with his leading barons and, in June 1215, was forced to sign the Magna Carta (Great Charter), an agreement guaranteeing baronial, church, and other rights in relation to the crown. The decree by Pope Innocent III two months later, which declared that John need not adhere to the charter, caused the barons to rise in revolt, initiating the First Barons’ War. They sought French help against John, promising the throne to Prince Louis of France. Against the wishes of both his father, King Philip II, and Pope Innocent III, who subsequently excommunicated him for his disobedience, Louis landed in Kent while the rebellious barons seized the Tower of London.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA History of War\n\nAfter John’s death in 1216, the rebel army was defeated at Lincoln by William Marshal—regent for the new young king, Henry III—and forced onto the defensive. In the south, the French were more successful and managed to besiege Marshal and his supporters in Dover. Louis called for reinforcements from France. In response, a French invasion fleet of 70 supply ships and 10 escorting warships crossed the English Channel but was met by a 40-strong English fleet, with 16 warships, led by Hubert de Burgh, that had sailed out of Dover. The English fleet first sailed past the French before turning to attack them in the rear, grappling the enemy ships before boarding them.\n\nThe surprise attack, during which the English threw pots of powdered quicklime into the downwind air to blind their opponents, quickly overwhelmed the French fleet. A barrage by English archers followed, inflicting heavy casualties. The French commander, Eustace the Monk, was found hiding in the bilges, or bottom of the ship’s hull, and was immediately beheaded as the English towed 65 French ships into Dover; some French sources say that the English mounted Eustace’s head on a pole and kept it on display for several days. Thirty-six French knights were taken prisoner, and an estimated 4,000 French sailors died in the battle; so vast was the booty that even after it was all shared out the English were able to fund the construction of a hospital and new port facilities. With his fleet captured and his land forces surrounded, Louis was forced to abandon his invasion of England and, after being forced to supplicate in public, made peace later in the year with the Treaty of Lambeth.\n\nLosses: English, none of 40 ships; French, 65 of 80 ships captured."
