        "text": "A JERSEY tourist, who was part of a group of 50 Islanders holidaying in Paris during the attacks, has said they are thankful they escaped the French capital alive.\n\nSue Deans, who arrived safely back in Jersey last night, said they were in the district of Montparnasse on Friday night just six miles south of the Bataclan theatre which saw the bloodiest attack.\n\nThe night before the group had been at an André Rieu concert at the Zénith de Paris theatre.\n\nWhen the attacks happened some of the group were eating dinner in Montparnasse while others had gone to see the Moulin Rouge at another venue in the city and were locked inside the theatre until they were safe.\n\nSpeaking to the JEP minutes after arriving back at the harbour last night, Mrs Deans said: ‘On the night we were at a lovely restaurant and the only thing we heard was quite a lot of sirens. It was not until we got home that we realised what had happened.\n\n‘There were some others from the group who had gone to the Moulin Rouge. They were allowed in and kept in until it was safe.’\n\nMrs Deans, a former Overseas Aid project leader from St Lawrence, said everyone was safe, although some were shaken by the incidents.\n\nDespite the advice the group went on a boat trip on the river Seine on Saturday.\n\n‘We were staying in Montparnasse, a few miles south of where it all happened. They attacked a rock concert with 1,000 people inside they could have easily chosen the André Rieu concert which had 6,000. We are thankful for small mercies,’ she said.\n\nThe group, who were travelling with Go Tours, had been due to travel from Paris to St Malo on the train but took a coach instead amid the security concerns.\n\nElsewhere Jerseyborn journalism student Joe Mayes (23), who lives in Paris, said that he had been in London during the attacks but his girlfriend Catherine Wyatt was locked in her apartment on the 18th arrondiasement about a mile from where the restaurant shootings occurred.\n\n‘It’s just really scary. I was at Place de République only two weeks ago doing some filming for my journalism class, and then there are shootings right next to the square. It could have been any of us.’\n\nMr Mayes was due to travel back to France today and expected security to be increased around his university which was due to open as normal.\n\n9.20 pm – The first suicide bomb is detonated outside the Stade de France as France play Germany. A second went off ten minutes later and a third at 9.53 pm.\n\n9.25 pm – Shootings at Le Carillon and Le Petit Cambodge, Rue Alibert. Around 14 deaths.\n\n9.29 pm – Gunfire and more deaths in the area of the Avenue de la Republique. Five deaths reported at the Casa Nostra pizzeria.\n\n9.38 pm – Shootings at La Belle Equipe bar, Rue du Charonne. 19 deaths.\n\n9.43 pm – Explosion at Comptoir Voltaire, Boulevard Voltaire. One death.\n\n9.49 pm – Four gunmen storm the Bataclan theatre and start killing hostages. Police raid the building at around midnight. At least 89 deaths reported.\n\n10 pm – Shootings at Boulevard Beaumarchais. Four deaths.\n\nA JERSEY charity set up to support refugees fleeing countries oppressed by extremists are urging Islanders not to project the ‘fear and anger’ created by the Paris attacks onto the innocent.\n\nThe Jersey Calais Refuge Aid Group, which raises money and awareness for the plight of refugees and migrants who have escaped countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, says they have been left shocked by terror attacks in Paris and Lebanon where 44 died in Beirut on Thursday. The so-called Islamic State have claimed responsibility for both attacks.\n\nIn a statement JCRAG said they hoped ‘the anger and fear created by these attacks will not backfire on refugees who have fled this type of violence’.\n\nThey added: ‘We express our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims.\n\n‘Terrorism is an expression of a world in turmoil. Desperation and fear are no answers to this. That is precisely the response terrorists are hoping to provoke.\n\n‘We’ll continue to address the refugee crisis with increased vigour and determination. Hopefully you’ll join us in this. We need your support more than ever now.’\n\nSPECIAL Branch officers were today due to continue extra patrols at the Island’s ports.\n\nThe States police and Customs have been carrying out precautionary checks at the Airport and harbours following Friday’s terror attacks.\n\nThis morning police confirmed that those checks were due to continue although they stressed that they had received no intelligence to suggest that Jersey was under imminent threat.\n\nThe Island’s terror threat level remains at ‘substantial’, meaning an attack against the Island is a ‘strong possibility’. The UK’s threat level is ‘severe’, indicating there is intelligence to suggest an attack is ‘highly likely’.\n\nIn a statement the States police said: ‘In light of recent events in Paris and whilst no intelligence has been received concerning Jersey and there has been no change in the UK threat level, the States of Jersey Police has determined that as a precautionary measure it will conduct routine patrols of the harbour and airport until further notice and will ensure that all associated sailings and flights from the continent are appropriately covered by special branch and Customs staff.\n\n‘The States of Jersey Police have direct contact with UK police and security services staff and will await further updates’.\n\nMeanwhile in Gatwick several Islanders were stranded for hours as police and security staff placed the North Terminal on lock down for six hours following a security scare on Saturday.\n\nThe Jersey Rugby Athletic team had to cancel their game with Esher Rugby after the North Terminal was shut down and they were not allowed to leave.\n\nA 41-year-old man from France has now been charged with possession of an air rifle and a knife following the incident. Jerome Chauris, from Vendome, is due to appear at Crawley Magistrates’ Court on Monday.\n\nBomb disposal officers carried out a small controlled explosion as airport passengers and staff were taken to local hotels.\n\nDescribing being caught up in the scare, one Islanders, who did not want to be named, said: ‘We have been stuck here since 10.20 am. We were at baggage reclaim ready to walk out and the doors all closed. Apparently the MOD has done a controlled explosion. We were told there is a 200 metre exclusion zone,’ she said.\n\n‘They have given us all food and drink.’\n\nA spokesman for Ports of Jersey said there had been some delays to incoming British Airways flights on Saturday.\n\nAirline Flybe say anybody due to travel to Paris with them today or tomorrow can contact them to rebook their trip for a later date. Their customer service number is 01392 683 152."
