        "text": "Once there was a time when Taiwan was the vibrant art capital of Asia, and then Taiwan lost its position to Hong Kong and mainland China in the late 1990s. However, with new galleries and art fairs like Art Taipei and Taipei Dangdai, Taiwan’s capital city is reclaiming its position as one of Asia’s foremost art hubs. Local collectors from different generations are driving this momentum and bringing international attention to the flourishing art market in Taiwan. On the occasion of a vibrant contemporary art fair Taipei Dangdai this week, LARRY’S LIST has come up with this cheat sheet for you.\n\nBarry Lam\n\nOne of the foremost arts patron in Taiwan, his collection over 1,000 artworks include many works of Chinese paintings and calligraphy, in particular over 250 works by painter Zhang Daqian.

In terms of contemporary art involvement, he is chairman of the Contemporary Art Foundation which manages the MoCA Taipei.\n\nJay Chou\n\n@jaychou\n\nToday, the Mandopop King is not only recognized as one of Asia’s most acclaimed private art collectors, but he has also reached the status of a global cultural ambassador bridging art, the creative scene, and entertainment.
