        "text": "A few months after public protests here over the violent repression of democracy in Tiananmen Square, it's business as usual in Hong Kong. After years in New York, a young Chinese remarked that his native city ''had become a gigantic shopping mall.'' The so-called Hong Kong dream, a vision of the good life parallel to the American Dream, however, shouldn't be reduced to pure mercantilism. For the film scholar Esther Yau, Hong Kong's precarious existence represents a utopia, the right not to choose between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Nowhere is this utopia better expressed than in the film industry - where audiences may enjoy a taste of paradise lost long ago in Hollywood. In Hong Kong, film making is an unpretentious industry, designed for profit, popular entertainment and export to Japan, Taiwan and Korea.\n\nParadise, however, is in danger of being lost. The Hong Kong film industry is a brilliant form of escapism, for there is something to escape from. In 1997, the 99-year British concession will expire, and Hong Kong will come under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Government. The June 4 crackdown has increased the residents' anxieties - and the film industry has been especially affected by the events. Producers, directors and stars, torn between rage, fear and the desire to keep working, might see their world disappear altogether. Hong Kong's film industry has its mega-stars (Sylvia Chang, Anita Mui, Cora Miao, Chow Yun-fatt, Tony Leung) and its kung fu idols Jackie Chang and Samo Hung; its major studios (Golden Harvest, Cinema City, D and B); its Spielbergian producers (Tsui Hark); its maverick auteurs (Allen Fong); and a handful of talented women directors (such as Ann Hui - of ''Boat People'' fame - and Mabel Cheung).\n\nThe most popular genres are action thrillers and a hilarious mixture of slapstick, martial arts and ghost story. Even when parodic, Hong Kong films still stand for the magic of cinema, its power to tell a story and to create a better and more exciting world. Gangster films are especially bloody, yet mythical. The protagonists are elegant, charming, brave, loyal friends, honorable adversaries, expert marksmen, extraordinary acrobats and, above all, paragons of manliness. Because they stick to genres and formulas, Hong Kong products might be described as exploitation films - yet they leave room for experimentation. Jackie Chang's humor, generosity and comical stunts have revitalized the action film, as in ''Project A, Police Story.'' Tsui Hark brilliantly combines traditional martial arts and high-tech special effects, as in ''Zhu, Warrior of Sacred Mountain.''\n\nSince the 1970's, Hong Kong has become the Hollywood of Asia and one of the world's most prolific film centers. But a shadow looms over its creative energy - that of 1997, when Hong Kong is to be reunited with the People's Republic of China. And since June 4, 1989, the day of the Tiananmen violence, history seems to have quickened its pace.\n\n''Chinese often use the past to talk about the present,'' says Po Chim Leong. Born in England to an emigre Cantonese family, he moved to Hong Kong in the 60's. Channel 4 in London produced his film ''Ping Pong,'' exploring the identity crisis of a young ''B.B.C.'' (British-Born Chinese). In Asia, he is famous for his 1986 film, ''Hong Kong 1941.'' The British colonials leave, the Japanese Army arrives, plunging the city into lawlessness and violence. Three young people struggle to survive. One of them (played by Chow Yun-fatt) gallantly dies to let his best friend escape with the girl they both love.\n\nBeyond the romance, beyond the memory of the atrocities committed by the Japanese, ''Hong Kong 1941'' is pregnant with allusions to the present. ''When the Japanese officer distributes rice, he says, 'Have faith in me.' Those were the very words used by Deng Xiaoping to the Hong Kong businessmen who were preparing to do business on the mainland,'' explains Mr. Po.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
