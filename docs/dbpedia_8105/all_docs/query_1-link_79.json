        "text": "I. PARTY AFFAIRS\n\nPerhaps the major attraction of the BIC is the collection of documents on the structure and functioning of the Chinese Communist Party. These include unpublished reports, decisions, and communications from various levels of the Party's hierarchy in the periods 1928–1934 and 1937–1950. CCP materials are also available from the years of the First United Front (1922–1927) and from the interim period of the Long March and the establishment of the Resistance Base Areas (1934–1937), but only a scattered and limited selection.\n\nA. The Period of the Soviets, 1927–1934\n\nIn the years after Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of the CCP in Shanghai and Canton in 1927, the Chinese Communists confronted a critical challenge to their ideological legitimacy and political survival. Following decisions from the Sixth Party Congress held in the Soviet Union (1928), a succession of Party leaders attempted to rebuild the shattered CCP apparatus in the cities.1 Yet, as the prospects of an urban revolution in China diminished, the focus of Communist activities shifted to the rural Soviets established in Kiangsi and several other provinces.\n\nScholars interested in the last months of the First United Front and the subsequent effort of the leadership to rebuild the CCP, will find interesting, though limited, materials in the BIC. The Bureau holds two issues of a Shanghai District Party Magazine, published just before the Nationalist armies seized the city; a Central Committee report on the Canton Commune; and a CC resolution regarding propaganda and factionalism in the Party. 2 Other materials from this period—including a report of the Second Plenum of the Sixth Party Congress (1929), 3 minutes of an enlarged Politburo meeting in March 1930, 4 and the newspaper Red Flag Daily,5—document the attacks on Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Ch'ü Ch'iu-pai and trace the rise of Li Li-san. Of particular interest are a periodical, Shanghai Tide (Hu-ch'ao), issued under the auspices of Li's newly installed Party Secretariat (mi-shu-ch'u) in Shanghai and a letter from Ho Tzu-shu, a member of the Russian Returned Student faction assigned to the Shanghai Party Committee and one of the earliest opponents of Li.6 Especially important are the Bureau's collections of the Central Correspondence (Chung-yang t'ung-hsin);7 Central Circular (Chung-yang t'ung-kao);8 and the Organization Bulletin (Tsu-chih t'ung-hsun).9 These document the development of organization and of revolutionary strategies, and the policy conflicts that grew out of the Party's final attempts to seize control of China's cities in the late 1920s and early 1930s.10\n\nMaterials from the Party's center give an accurate account of its internal politics before 1937. Among Central Committee materials, 11 there is a particularly rich collection from 1932–1933.12 This collection covers major policy decisions by the new leaders from the Russian Returned Students faction, as well as Central directives on such topics as branch work, internal security, and cadre work style. Other documents demonstrate the commitment of the Russian Returned Students to the eradication of the \"Li Li-san Line\" and to the further \"Bolshevization\" of the Party.13 Finally, there is valuable material in the BIC bearing on purges of important Party leaders.14\n\nMajor publications of the CCP's Central Propaganda Bureau include Red Flag Weekly (Hung-ch'i chou-pao),15 Party Construction (Tang ti chien-she),16 and Struggle (Tou-cheng).17 Struggle was devoted primarily to the Shanghai Party organization and details such little-known aspects of the CCP in the 1930s as factory branch organization and the occupational composition of the Shanghai Party membership.18 Numerous issues of these periodicals can be acquired elsewhere, but the Bureau's collection appears to be more complete.\n\nMany documents in the BIC cover the provincial level of the CCP's organization. The majority are from the Kiangsu Party Committee, which was located in Shanghai, and the remainder are from Party committees in Anhwei, Chekiang, Fukien, Hopei, Shensi, Shantung, and Manchuria. 19 Numbering over one hundred catalog entries, they treat in depth the involvement of provincial committees in disputes that affected the entire CCP during this volatile period of its history. Among the most interesting are a complete set of the journal Lenin Life (Lieh-ning sheng-huo) published by the Kiangsu Provincial Committee during the CCP's underground struggle in Shanghai;20 scattered issues of Struggle and Study (Tou-cheng yü hsueh-hsi) from Shensi,21 and the newspaper Fukien Red Flag (Fu-chien hung-ch'i).22 In addition, special provincial reports, minutes of provincial Party meetings, and letters from provincial committees to cadres in the field and other CCP units are numerous and offer excellent sources for analyzing the diversity of CCP organization and practices below the central level.23 The minutes of an Enlarged Executive Committee of the Fukien Party organization24 and a document on criticism and self-criticism in the Shensi Provincial Committee25 are particularly revealing in this respect.\n\nAt lower levels of the Party—county, city and district, and branch—there are similar but far fewer documents in the BIC.26 There are some, though not many, documents from Party organizations in Shanghai, Tientsin, and Amoy,27 and some—still fewer—from CCP district organizations.28 The most plentiful collection of materials from lower levels consist of documents from approximately fifty counties.29 These include counties in Anhwei, Kiangsu, Fukien, Hupeh, and Kiangsi.30 A particularly noteworthy document is Draft Resolutions of the First Enlarged Meeting of the Liu-an County Committee, from Anhwei.31\n\nThe Bureau's holdings could also supplement research on the ideological struggle against various splinter groups within the CCP during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Some documents treat the Party's conflict in the early 1930s with the Trotskyites32 and the Third Party. In addition, it would be interesting to look at the CCP from the vantage point of the KMT Left, as it appears in such publications as the Democratic Weekly (Min-chu chou-k'an).33 Materials on these subjects, however, are widely available in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nDocuments from the CCP Soviets in the 1930s are not fully catalogued by the Bureau (as above) and are, consequently, difficult to assess. But discussions with the Bureau's staff and scholars familiar with the collection indicate that the BIC holds valuable material from the Central Kiangsi Soviet and from smaller rural Soviets such as O-Yü-Wan,34 Hsiang-O-hsi,35 and O-hsi.36 Some documents trace the establishment of the Soviets in the early 1930s and treat the general problems of building a Communist Party organization in the countryside.37 Others deal with specific policy decisions on land redistribution38—matters which are covered thoroughly in Hsiao Tso-liang's The Land Revolution in China.39 There is valuable documentation from both local units of the Soviets40 and the Central Soviet Organization,41 including a detailed chart of Party and government institutions in the Central Soviet. Finally, decisions of the Party \"Central\" in Shanghai which express their policy views on the Soviets are available.42\n\nB. The War of Resistance and the Civil War, 1937–1949\n\nDuring the first two years of the war with Japan, the Chinese Communist Party grew to tremendous size, but its development under wartime conditions was uneven and the new membership included landlords and other \"undesirables.\" In August 1939, the Central Committee issued an important directive on Party consolidation and initiated a major internal reform and study drive. In conjunction with this Party reform, the Central Committee began publication of the Communist (Kung-ch'an-tang jen) in September, which became the official Party organ during the war.43 Contributors included prominent Central Party leaders such as Liu Shao-ch'i, Wang Chia-hsiang, Li Fu-ch'un, Yang Sung, Li Wei-han, and Ai Ssu-ch'i. The Communist reprinted all the major Central Committee directives and occasionally offered local case studies of Party work. In the first issue the editors published the directive \"On Party Consolidation\" and devoted the remainder of the edition to articles on various problems of internal reform. In the same issue, Chang Wen-t'ien wrote on the rights and responsibilities of Party members,44 and an essay by Ch'en Yun discussed Party consolidation and mass work in the war zones.45 The third issue examined the problems of recruiting intellectuals and included an investigation report on Party branches in three villages of Yen-ch'uan, Shensi.46\n\nThe Communist was the model for numerous other Party periodicals published at various regional and district committee levels. The Shen-Kan-Ning Party Committee produced Unity (T'uan-chieh) from 1938 to 1943.47 In North China there were a variety of internal Party publications, among them the North China Bureau's Party Life (Tang ti sheng-huo), the South Hopeh Committee's Plains (P'ing-yuan), and the Chin-Chi-Yü Committee's War (Chan-tou). Unfortunately, the Bureau has only single issues of two such periodicals, the Chin-Ch'a-Chi Military Districts New Great Wall (Hsin ch'ang-ch'eng) and the Chi-Lu-Yü Committee's version of the Plains (P'ing-yuan).48\n\nIn wartime Party periodicals the BIC's strength is its holdings from Central China. It has twenty-seven issues of Dawn (Fo-hsiao), dating from April 1943 to July 1946.49 The Huai-pei Su-Wan-Yü Committee edited Dawn and published a variety of local studies, reports from other border area committees, and directives from the Central China Bureau. The inaugural issue, for instance, reprinted Jen Pi-shih's important report of January 1943 from the Northwest Bureau's Senior Cadre Conference. Contributors in other issues were local Party leaders such as Teng Tzu-hui, Liu Tzu-chiu, Feng Ting, and P'eng Hsueh-feng. Dawn also has several excellent accounts of the Rectification Drive (1942–1944) at the local level.\n\nThe BIC holds ten issues of Party Life (Tang ti sheng-huo), the secret internal publication of the New Fourth Army's Chiang-pei Unit Party Committee, which was located in the old O-Yü-Wan Soviet.50 The committee's first edition is dated January 1941 and includes a preface by the vice-commander of the New Fourth Army, Chang Yun-i. Often, the editors of Party Life published directives from the Central Committee and Central China Bureau as well as a number of local Chiang-pei and O-Yü-Wan Committee circulars. These include articles on the experiences and lessons of local Party work and essays promoting the study of Marxism-Leninism. Most of these concern the Party's internal reform drive and study movement of 1939–1941, and the Rectification Drive of 1942 to 1944, with emphasis on strengthening Party branch work and encouraging exemplary behavior by Party members.\n\nParty Bulletin (Tang-nei t'ung-hsun), published by the Huai-pei District Committee, concentrates on local affairs in Huai-pei from 1944 to 1945. The BIC has fifteen issues, with many articles written by local cadres on village inspection work, the Great Production Drive (1943–1946), rent and interest reduction, and branch reform.51 There are also scattered issues of several district committee magazines from Central China such as Branch Bulletin (Chih-pu t'ung-hsun), Mass Bulletin (Ch'ün-chung t'ung-hsun), and War Life (Chan-tou sheng-huo).52 Although there are only one or two issues of each, nonetheless, they offer a variety of materials on local and community Party affairs.\n\nThe BIC has several issues of two of Central China's more important internal Party magazines, the Central China Bureau's Central China Bulletin (Hua-chung t'ung-hsun) and the New Fourth Army Seventh Division's Truth (Chen-li).53 Two of the issues of Truth deal with special topics. The August 1943 edition treats the experiences of cadres as they built base area in North China and includes an important speech by P'eng Teh-huai.54 The February 1944 issue is on village investigation work in the Huai-pei region. In addition, there are also several journals from the Huai-hai and Huai-nan Districts, the most important of which is the Huai-nan Party Magazine (Huai-nan tang-k'an).55\n\nThese journals constitute the BIC's richest source on Party affairs during the War of Resistance (1937–1945) and the Civil War (1946–1949). They discuss mass mobilization and the problems of internal Party reform at the time of the land reform movement of the late 1940s. Moreover, the articles emphasize the Rectification Drive and its impact on local party work and economic construction at the community level.\n\nC. The Rectification Drive, 1942–1944\n\nStudents of Chinese Communist affairs have viewed the Rectification Drive from several perspectives. Some see it as essentially an educational movement aimed at indoctrinating cadres and Party members with a more distinctly Chinese version of Marxism-Leninism.56 Others suggest that it was a power struggle between Mao Tse-tung and the Russian Returned Students over crucial policy questions. 57 Yet others argue that it was primarily a crystallization of wartime experiences into the mass line.58 The BIC materials on rectification provide some new sources from which to reevaluate these interpretations.\n\nPerhaps the most valuable documents come from the Northwest Bureau Senior Cadre Conference (October 1942 to January 1943). Following the six-month Rectification Study Movement in Yenan, this conference instituted a shift from study to internal Party reform and it redefined leadership style and economic goals. The BIC holds six of the major speeches given at the conference and the Northwest Bureau's summary of Conference activities. Among them are reports by Lin Po-ch'ü, Ho Lung, Kao Kang, and Jen Pi-shih, as well as the complete text of Mao Tse-tung's Economic Problems and Financial Problems—a summary of economic construction activities in the Shen-Kan-Ning Border Region, which first appeared in the 1947 version of Mao's Selected Works, published by the Chin-Ch'a-Chi Committee.59\n\nA second group of documents includes various rectification and study materials from Communist base areas. For example, the Bureau has three volumes of a ten-volume set of rectification documents published by the Central Kiangsu Committee.60 This committee compiled a number of essays and reports from regional leaders such as Jao Shu-shih. Also available in the BIC is the Chi-Lu-Yü Administrative Office's similar two-volume set, which published a wide variety of speeches and reports of second-line Party leaders whose works had not been included in the well-known twenty-two study documents used in the Rectification Study Movement and authorized by the Central Committee Propaganda Bureau.61 Among them is an unusual collection of documents with three essays by Chang Wen-t'ien, who studied in the Soviet Union and is identified with the Russian Returned Students faction.62\n\nA third group of rectification materials includes a number of district and county committee documents. For example, the Sixth District Committee Propaganda Bureau in the Chi-Lu-Yü Border Region printed a mimeographed volume for the study movement with local directives on how to initiate a study drive and issue an official study plan.63 The Sixth District Committee also offered as reference materials a summary of the Shen-Kan-Ning experience and two excerpts from speeches by Chu Jui and Huang Ching on developing study and the nature of study itself.64 There are also materials from the county level and notes made by individual Party members on their own experiences in the Rectification Drive.65\n\nFinally, the BIC has the standard sources on rectification66 as well as several studies of the movement by Nationalist intelligence analysts.67 As for the rectification of Communist literature and propaganda, the BIC has only those documents commonly available in the West, such as Mao Tse-tung's speech at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art68 and a re-publication of Wang Shih-wei's The Wild Lily (Yeh pai-ho hua).69 In addition, there are two little known Communist critiques of Wang, one by Chou Yang and another a collection of articles by Fan Wen-Ian, Ai Ch'ing, and others.70 There are also Nationalist intelligence reports on the literary \"purge\" carried out by the CCP following Mao's speech, but these add little to the detailed information on the Wang Shih-wei case found in issues of the Liberation Daily (Chieh-fang jih-pao).71\n\nD. The Period of the People's Republic, 1949–1973\n\nThe BIC's holdings of post-1949 materials are understandably scarce, though there are some interesting exceptions. The collection of documents from the period immediately following the victory of the Communist Army includes original materials on cadre training and political study used by central, provincial, and local Party organs. From the Central Committee's Southern Bureau, for example, the BIC has several Communist Party Member Textbooks, 72 and from the Liao- yang City Party Committee there are numerous Political Study Reference Materials.73 In some materials, such as How to Carry Out Theoretical Study from Shanghai74 and Lectures on Basic Knowledge for Chinese Communist Party Members from the Wuhan Marxism-Leninism School,75 the importance of the cadre's theoretical education emerges, while in others there is considerable discussion of \"study\" (hsueh-hsi) during both the Civil War and post-Liberation periods.76 From provincial, county, and city Party committees there are handbooks and texts which describe propaganda work beginning in the late 1930s and extending through the early 1950s.77 How to be a Propaganda Worker and several Propaganda Handbooks from Shanghai are particularly interesting and voluminous collections.78\n\nIn addition to the documentation covering the Party's actions on the mainland in the early 1950s, there are also limited materials regarding CCP activity on Chinese islands. For example, a publication from Canton treats CCP operations on Hainan island79 and an investigation report conducted by the Bureau evaluates Communist organization on Taiwan up to 1950.80\n\nFinally, the BIC holds other documents collected from the mainland by the Nationalist authorities since the early 1950s. These include public newspapers and internal Party materials, but their exclusion from the Bureau's card catalogue makes the scope of these materials difficult to assess. The newspapers are local, coming from cities and provinces, among them: The Shanghai Evening News (1966), Yin-ch'uan Daily (Szechwan, 1958), Ch'engtu Daily (1958), Pao-t'ou Daily (Inner Mongolia, 1957), Sian Daily (1958), Nanking Daily (1956–1957), Harbin Daily (1957), Yunnan Daily (1956–1957, 1972), Sinkiang Daily (1957), Inner Mongolian Daily (1958), and even some Mongolian-language newspapers.81 Although we do not know the number of issues of each newspaper now available at the Bureau, these holdings appear limited, and only marginally important to research, especially for the period after 1953.\n\nClassified CCP documents come from the Party's highest levels and seem to be of considerable importance. These include Mao Tse-tung's Highest-level Directives on the \"rural rustification\" (hsia-fang) of the Red Guards,82 a cadre newspaper entitled Reference News,83 and the \"absolutely secret\" Documents of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee (1972),84 one of which treats the Lin Piao affair. There is also the Political Work Bulletin from the 1970s which focuses on local problems, such as agricultural mechanization in a Kwangsi district and cultural works in a Pao-shan, Yunnan production team.85\n\nFOOTNOTES TO CHAPTER I\n\n1.
