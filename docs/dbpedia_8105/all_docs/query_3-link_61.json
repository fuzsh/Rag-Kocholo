        "text": "Jet Li (born April 26, 1963, Beijing, China) is a Chinese film actor noted for his superlative martial arts skills and for his portrayals of virtuous, humble heroes.\n\nIn 1971 Li entered a summer sports program and was randomly assigned to a wushu (martial arts) class. At the age of nine, he received an award at the first wushu competition held in China since the Cultural Revolution. Li then spent half of each day in training and half in school before he began to train full-time. In 1974 he toured the United States with other young martial artists and even met Pres. Richard Nixon at the White House. That same year Li won the first of five men’s national championships. He retired from the sport in 1979.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAmerican Sports Nicknames\n\nIn 1982 Li made his film debut in Shaolin Si (The Shaolin Temple) as a young man who learns martial arts from the monks at the famed Shaolin Temple (noted as the legendary birthplace of Chinese martial arts). Shaolin Si was an enormous hit (with two sequels) and was credited with reviving interest in the martial arts in China. When the movie was released in the Philippines, the distributors there thought Li’s name was unpronounceable, so they changed it to Jet Li.\n\nLi directed and starred in Zhonghua Yingxiong (1986; Born to Defense), a commercial disappointment, but, for the first time, Li played a character in a period setting (the 1940s) who was defending the honour of China and its people from the insults of foreigners. He would return to this type of role often in his career. Li later made two undistinguished action films for Hong Kong studios that were filmed in the United States, one of which, Long Xing Tianxia (1989; The Master), marked the beginning of a long collaboration with director and producer Tsui Hark.\n\nIn Tsui’s 1991 film Wong Fei-hung (Once Upon a Time in China), Li played his most famous character, the historical martial arts master Wong Fei-hung, who fought against injustice and foreign encroachment at the end of the Qing dynasty. Li became a top star in Hong Kong and played Wong in three sequels. Many of his 1990s martial arts films are regarded as classics of the genre. Particularly noteworthy were the fantasy Xiaoao Jianghu zhi Dongfang Bubai (1992; Swordsman II, or The Legend of the Swordsman), the comedic Fong Sai-Yuk (1993; The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk), and Jingwu Yingxiong (1994; Fist of Legend), a remake of Bruce Lee’s Jingwumen (1972; Fist of Fury).\n\nLi made his Hollywood debut in a rare role as the villain in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). Thereafter his career was divided between China and Hollywood. Li was the lead in director Zhang Yimou’s Yingxiong (2002; Hero), a lavish and complexly plotted martial arts spectacular about assassins trying to kill Shihuangdi, the first emperor of China. He was acclaimed for his performance in Unleashed (2005; also called Danny the Dog) as a man raised since childhood by a gangster to be his enforcer."
