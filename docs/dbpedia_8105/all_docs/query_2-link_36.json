The absent fathers in Sino-French films by Taiwanese auteurs Cheng Yu-chieh, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang serve as metaphors for French auteurs. French New Wave films constitute the majority of the intertexts; however, early 1950s French cinema and even late nineteenth-century painting reflect the expansiveness of French influence. Despite the possibility of an orientalist dynamic, Taiwanese auteurs not only pay homage to their French ‘fathers’, and especially New Waver François Truffaut, but also strike out on their own, contributing innovative work to contemporary transnational cinemas.]\n\nBraester, Yomi. “Shards of Memory: Papa Can you Hear Me Sing? and the Demolished Spaces of Taiwan Urban Cinema.” Conference Paper, Remapping Taiwan (UCLA, Oct. 13-15, 2000).\n\n—–. “The Dream of Flying: Taipei and Beijing Cinematic Poetics of Demolition.” Tamkang Review (Summer 2000).\n\n—–. “If We Could Remember Everything, We Would Be Able to Fly: Taipei’s Cinematic Poetics of Demolition.” Modern Chinese Literature and Culture 15, 1 (Spring 2003): 29-62.\n\n—–. “Tales of a Porous City: Public Residences and Private Streets in Taipei Films.” In Charles Laughlin, ed., Contested Modernity in Chinese Literature.

The book considers the works of such prominent directors as Edward Yang, Tsai Ming-liang and Chang Tsuo-chi and their influence on Asian films, as well as emergent phenomenal directors such as Wei Te-sheng, Zero Chou, and Chung Mong-hong. It also explores the possibility of transnational and trans-local social sphere in the interstices of layered colonial legacies, nation-state domination, and global capitalism. Considering Taiwan cinema in the wake of globalization, it analyses how these films represent the socio-political transition among multiple colonial legacies, global capitalism, and the changing cross-strait relation between Taiwan and the Mainland China. The book discusses how these films represent nomadic urban middle class, displaced transnational migrant workers, roaming children and young gangsters, and explores how the continuity/disjuncture of globalization has not only carved into historical and personal memories and individual bodies, but also influenced the transnational production modes and marketing strategies of cinema.]\n\nChang, Jinn-Pei. “The Mind Space of Taipei’s Adolescents.” In Chen Ruxiu, ed., Xunzhao dianying zhong de Taibei (Focus on Taipei through Cinema).

Newcastle, UK: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2022.\n\n[Abstract: A number of Taiwanese scholars gate-kept, filtered, selected, and strategized to transfer Luce Irigaray’s, Hélène Cixous’s, and Julia Kristeva’s French feminist theories into their own national context by exerting their cross-lingual and cross-cultural academic power in the 1990s. They also reshaped, localized, acculturated, marketed, and Taiwanized these French feminist theories, which was essential for Taiwanese academia. According to French feminist literary theories, écriture féminine (“feminine writing”) refers to women’s own written self-expression used to escape from the patriarchal language system. Beginning with a description of the acculturation of French feminist literary theories, this book highlights how women’s own spoken voices or autobiographical written expressions appear in Taiwanese cinematic works when the camera is compared to the cinematic pen. It analytically digest the écriture féminine of parler-femme in the Taiwanese films The Butcher’s Wife, Taste of Life, Sex Appeal, and Ghosted.]\n\nChiao, Hsiung-ping 焦雄屏, ed.

Just as the Japanese translation of Western cinema brings into play traces of Japanese otherness, the Taiwanese translation of the Japanese translation disrupts the Japanese monopoly on the meaning of cinematic experience in colonial Taiwan. A key figure in this complex cultural translation was the benshi, a translator who performed alongside the screen to interpret the film for the audience. This study argues that an overemphasis on the interventional power of the benshi’s word does not do justice to the complex role of the benshi as a translator. In spite of its inscription of the cultural specific in the cinematic space, the presence of the benshi is also a reminder of an unfulfilled desire: the desire for the (foreign) image and the desire for the other. Insofar as the act of translation is a critical engagement with the challenges posed by the other, a simplistic celebration of local resistance does not help us fully address the complexity of cultural translation that defines the mediascape of the modern age.]\n\nChiu, Kuei-fen, Ming-yeh Rawnsley, and Gary Rawnsley, eds.

The book discusses key issues, including: why (until about 2008) Taiwan cinema underwent a decline, and how cinema is portraying current social changes in Taiwan, including changing youth culture and how it represents indigenous people in the historical narrative of Taiwan. The book also explores the reasons why current Taiwan cinema is receiving a much less enthusiastic response globally compared to its reception in previous decades.]\n\nChong, Woei Lien, “Taiwan Cinema at the 1997 International Rotterdam Film Festival: Comedy and Small-Scale Family Drama.” China Information 11, 4 (Spring 1997): 105-116.\n\n“Cinema.” The Republic of China Yearbook–Taiwan, 2001.\n\nDavis, Darrell William. “Trendy in Taiwan: Problems of Popularity in the Island’s Cinema.” In Darrell William Davis and Ru-Shou Robert Chen, eds.,Cinema Taiwan: Politics, Popularity and State of the Arts.

By honing in on the uses of sounds and words, I show that the principle of a unitary voice–voice understood both as the utterances of sound and the politico-cultural meaning of such utterances–organizes the earlier periods of the colonial and authoritarian rules and shapes later iterations of and formal reactions to them. Be it voice-over narration or captions and inter-titles, this article provides a historiographical lens through which the politics of representation in Taiwan documentary may be rethought. Furthermore, this article takes documentary not merely as a genre of non-fiction filmmaking. Rather, it insists on documentary as a mode, and indeed modes, of representation that do not belong exclusively to the non-fiction. Notions of “documentability” are considered together with the corollary tendency to “fictionalize” in cinema, fiction and non-fiction. Taiwan, with its complex histories in general and the specific context within which the polyglossiac practices of New Taiwan Documentary have blossomed in recent decades in particular, is a productive site to investigate the questions of “sound” in cinematic form and “voice” in representational politics.]\n\nHorng, Menghsin C. “Domestic Dislocations: Healthy Realism, Stardom, and the Cinematic Projection of Home in Postwar Taiwan.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 4, 1 (March 2010): 27-44.\n\n[Abstract: Healthy Realism was created under the auspices of the Nationalist Party (KMT) to project the party’s domestic legitimacy and establish the place of Mandarin-language cinema in the international market. I ascribe the success of Healthy Realism less to its privileged origins within the state-run studio or propagandistic authority, but more to the semiotic work of its stars as key vectors in the transmission of film ideology. As long as the on- and off-screen images of its stars cohered, the genre could maintain its claims to realism. I examine Beautiful Duckling (1965), Lonely Seventeen (1967), and Execution in Autumn (1972), tracking changes to the trope of home as expressed primarily through the star image of Tang Pao-yun. Changes to the genre and Tang’s image responded to geopolitical shifts, eventually exceeding both the formal and narrative constraints of Healthy Realism and exposing the ideological dissolution of ‘home’ under the preexisting authoritarian figurations.]\n\nHu, Brian. “Formula 17: Testing a Formula for Mainstream Cinema in Taiwan.” Senses of Cinema 34 (Jan.-Mar. 2005)\n\nHuang Ren.

This is a brief moment of populist politics in the film, and Aga’s rejection of a ‘false’ Taipei identity in favour of a more ‘true’ local identity relates to contemporary Taiwan’s contested political identity. The People’s Republic of China, which officially considers Taiwan a province of the mainland, insists that the world deny Taiwan independent nation status in international venues, considering Taiwan as encompassed by China under a ‘One China, Two Systems’ policy. In Cape No. 7, Aga’s cry becomes a means of denying that reductive imago of Taipei as province of China/Taipei as representative of all Taiwan. By translocating its story to Pingtung’s ethnically diverse and linguistically polyglot local communities, the film articulates a comprehensive and encompassing conception of Taiwan that is posed in opposition to Mandarin speaking ‘Chinese Taipei’. The film promotes a Taiwanese identity that consists of a diversity of political and cultural forms: Han Chinese as well as Hokklo, Hakka, aboriginal and immigrant. This paper explores the search for ‘the local’ in contemporary Taiwanese populist cinema.]\n\nKellner, Douglas. “New Taiwan Cinema in the 1980s.” Jump Cut 42 (1998): 101-15.\n\nKowallis, Jon. “The Diaspora in Postmodern Taiwan and Hong Kong Film: Framing Stan Lai’s The Peach Blossom Land with Allen Fong’s Ah Ying.” In Sheldon Lu, ed., Transnational Chinese Cinema: Identity, Nationhood, Gender.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2021.\n\n[Abstract: Why has Taiwanese film been so appealing to film directors, critics, and audiences across the world? This book argues that because Taiwan is a nation without hard political and economic power, cinema becomes a form of soft power tool that Taiwan uses to attract global attention, to gain support, and to build allies. Author Song Hwee Lim shows how this goal has been achieved by Taiwanese directors whose films win the hearts and minds of foreign audiences to make Taiwan a major force in world cinema. The book maps Taiwan’s cinematic output in the twenty-first century through the three keywords in the book’s subtitle-authorship, transnationality, historiography. Its object of analysis is the legacy of Taiwan New Cinema, a movement that begun in the early 1980s that has had a lasting impact upon filmmakers and cinephiles worldwide for nearly forty years. By examining case studies that include Hou Hsiao-hsien, Ang Lee, and Tsai Ming-liang, this book suggests that authorship is central to Taiwan cinema’s ability to transcend borders to the extent that the historiographical writing of Taiwan cinema has to be reimagined. It also looks at the scaling down of soft power from the global to the regional via a cultural imaginary called “little freshness”, which describes films and cultural products from Taiwan that have become hugely popular in China and Hong Kong. In presenting Taiwan cinema’s significance as a case of a small nation with enormous soft power, this book hopes to recast the terms and stakes of both cinema studies and soft power studies in academia.]\n\nLin, Sylvia Li-chun. Representing Atrocity in Taiwan: The 2/28 Incident and White Terror in Fiction and Film. NY: Columbia UP, 2007.\n\n[Abstract: In 1945, Taiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China, and after two years, accusations of corruption and a failing economy sparked a local protest that was brutally quashed by the Kuomintang government. The February Twenty-Eighth (or 2/28) Incident led to four decades of martial law that became known as the White Terror. During this period, talk of 2/28 was forbidden and all dissent violently suppressed, but since the lifting of martial law in 1987, this long-buried history has been revisited through commemoration and narrative, cinema and remembrance. Drawing on a wealth of secondary theoretical material as well as her own original research, Sylvia Li-chun Lin conducts a close analysis of the political, narrative, and ideological structures involved in the fictional and cinematic representations of the 2/28 Incident and White Terror. She assesses the role of individual and collective memory and institutionalized forgetting, while underscoring the dangers of re-creating a historical past and the risks of trivialization. She also compares her findings with scholarly works on the Holocaust and the aftermath of the atomic bombings of Japan, questioning the politics of forming public and personal memories and the political teleology of “closure.” This is the first book to be published in English on the 2/28 Incident and White Terror and offers a valuable matrix of comparison for studying the portrayal of atrocity in a specific locale.]\n\n—–. “Between Past and Future: Documentary Films on the 2/28 Incident in Taiwan.” Modern Chinese Literature and Culture 21, 1 (Spring 2009): 46-71.\n\nLin, Sylvia Li-chun and Tze-Lan Deborah Sang, eds. Documenting Taiwan on Film: Issues and Methods in New Documentaries. NY: Routledge, 2012.\n\n[Abstract: To date, there is but a handful of articles on documentary films from Taiwan. This volume seeks to remedy the paucity in this area of research and conduct a systematic analysis of the genre. Each contributor to the volume investigates the various aspects of documentary by focusing on one or two specific films that document social, political and cultural changes in recent Taiwanese history. Since the lifting of martial law, documentary has witnessed a revival in Taiwan, with increasing numbers of young, independent filmmakers covering a wide range of subject matter, in contrast to fiction films, which have been in steady decline in their appeal to local, Taiwanese viewers. These documentaries capture images of Taiwan in its transformation from an agricultural island to a capitalist economy in the global market, as well as from an authoritarian system to democracy. What make these documentaries a unique subject of academic inquiry lies not only in their exploration of local Taiwanese issues but, more importantly, in the contribution they make to the field of non-fiction film studies. As the former third-world countries and Soviet bloc begin to re-examine their past and document social changes on film, the case of Taiwan will undoubtedly become a valuable source of comparison and inspiration. These Taiwanese documentaries introduce a new, Asian perspective to the wealth of Anglo-American scholarship with the potential to serve as exemplar for countries undergoing similar political and social transformations.]\n\nLin, Wenchi. “The Representation of Taipei in Taiwan Films.” In Chen Ruxiu, ed., Xunzhao dianying zhong de Taibei (Focus on Taipei through Cinema).

This misconception prevents scholars from perceiving a strong link to the social reality of the 1970s in some of Qiong Yao’s popular films. By examining the positive images of working girls in two Qiong Yao films Lee Hsing directed in 1973, The Young Ones and The Heart with a Million Knots and Bai Jingrui’s 1976The Autumn Love Song, this essay argues that Qiong Yao films provide ‘realistic’ dreams of social mobility, making the romantic love even more appealing to the working-class females, the main body of Qiong Yao’s audience.]\n\n—–. “Of Femal Spies and National Heroes: A Brief History of Anti-Japanese Films in Taiwan from the 1950s to the 1970s.” In Michael Berry and Chiho Sawada, eds., Divided Lenses: Screen Memories of War in East Asia.

The Last Isle opens from where Taiwan film scholarship leaves off—the 1980s Taiwan New Cinema, focusing on relatively unknown contemporary films that are “unglobalizable,” such as Cape No. 7, Island Etude, Din Tao, and Seven Days in Heaven. It explores Taiwan films’ inextricability with trauma theory, the irony of loving and mourning Taiwan, multilingualism, local beliefs, and theatrical practices, including Ang Lee’s “white” films. The second half of the book analyzes Taiwan’s popular culture in Western-style food and drink, conditions over living and dying, and English education, concluding with the source of Taiwan’s anxiety—China. This book distinguishes itself from Taiwan scholarship in its stylistic crazy quilt of the scholarly interwoven with the personal, evidenced right from the outset in the poetic title “The Last Isle,” coupled with the “dissertating” subtitle. This approach intertwines the helix of reason and affect, scholarship and emotion. The Last Isle accomplishes a look at globalization from the bottom up, from a global Taiwan whose very existence is in doubt.]\n\nMarchetti, Gina. “Video Frames, Cinemascapes, and Cyberspace: Exploring Shu Lea Cheang’s Fresh Kill.” positions 9, 2 (Fall 2001): 401-22.

How does censorship affect the aesthetics and identity of film-making produced under political and market constraints? Focusing on the geopolitical regions of British Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China, this article delineates the impact of British colonial film censorship and the politics of cinematically representing revolutionary China during the Cold War. It reveals that British Hong Kong censors changed their strategy in the 1970s and 80s from suppressing mainland Chinese films to inhibiting films that might offend China from screening in Hong Kong. The evidence points to a distinctive picture of transregional smuggling and cinematic boundary-crossing, namely, the dangerous trafficking and interception of movie images, ideologies, and propaganda. Film screening of ‘China’ in Hong Kong and Taiwan was subject to strict official surveillance to quarantine undesirable public visuality and political discourses. The study examines film’s ambiguous expressions of China and Chineseness as it constantly negotiated the factors of colonialism, Chinese nationalism, and Cold War transnational politics.]\n\nNornes, Mark Abe and Yueh-yu Yeh. “Taiwanese Cinema.” A City of Sadness webproject.\n\nOu, Alice, ed.

This book updates the scholarship on Taiwan cinema by taking it into the twenty-first century. It is the first book to take a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating recent Taiwan films. The authors are specialists in cultural studies, history, and the social sciences, and they use different film materials and methodologies to analyze the ways in which filmmakers deal with the evolution of Taiwan’s society, economy, and culture in the new century. The emphasis is placed on the diversity of approaches that characterize recent Taiwan cinema. Taiwanese filmmakers use many forms and genres to tackle pressing issues. In sharp contrast to the late-twentieth-century New Wave filmmakers who were widely regarded as producing “art films” that had little impact on the domestic market, many recent Taiwan films have enjoyed huge commercial success in Taiwan. This book probes many crucial controversies: What are Taiwan’s meaningful cultural and historical connections to Japan? How do Taiwanese filmmakers and audiences feel about mainland China? How does Taiwan cinema deal with environmental issues, animal rights, human trafficking, sexuality, and the challenges facing ethnic minorities?]\n\nRawnsley, Ming-Yeh T. “Taiwanese-Language Cinema: State versus Market, National versus Transnational.” Archiv Orientalni 81, 3 (2013): 437-58.\n\n—–. “Politics of the Everday: Taiwanese-language Cinema of the 1950s-1960s.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 14, 20 (2020): 127-39.\n\nRiep, Steven. “Piecing Together the Past: The Notion of Recovery in Fiction and Film from Taiwan.” Modern China 38, 2 (March 2012): 199-232.\n\n[Abstract: Writers and filmmakers in Taiwan have sought to use the narrative techniques of classic detective fiction to recover events of the Nationalist government-imposed White Terror of the early 1950s to bring the once-concealed past to light. Fiction writer Chen Yingzhen (Ch’en Ying-chen) pioneered this technique in short fiction written in 1983 to bring before the public the events of the White Terror and to consider how guilt for the atrocities should be affixed. Wan Jen’s (Wan Ren) 1995 feature film Super Citizen Ko explores possibilities for memorialization and the notion of victimhood in its recovery of the Nationalist repression of progressive political movements and its impact on a former political prisoner and his family.

London: Routledge, 2022, 231-49.\n\n[Abstract: provides a study of the intertwining of touch, vision, and intimacy in contemporary art and films. In his discussions of mediated physical contact and conflicted relationships between different pairs of male protagonists, Rojas delves into “a dialectics of proximity and distance, intimacy and alienation.” Relying upon reciprocity and connectivity, tactile contact between individuals, perceived as being potentially more direct, intimate, and sensuous, is subject to more restrictions than other modes of sensory perception. Determined by a complex set of personal, cultural, social, religious, and institutional factors, physical contact thus acquires a range of significance entwining with different circumstances. In contemporary artist Song Dong’s work “Touching my father” (1997), Song projects his own hand image onto his father’s face and body to “caress” him in the process of the father’s unclothing. The work, overcoming his estranged relationship with his father and ethical and physical barriers, opens the possibilities for trans-generational affective connections. Through detailed examination of unexpected moments of physical intimacy (between lovers, acquaintances, or strangers) in the films of Wong Kar-wai 王家衛, Zhang Yuan 張元, and Tsai Ming-liang 蔡明亮, Rojas unfolds the delicate, nuanced dialectics of desire and alienation. In Happy Together (1997), East Palace West Palace (1996), and The River (1997), the male protagonist’s relationship with his male lover or even a stranger functions as a displaced substitution for his estranged relationship with his actual father. As Rojas’s sensitive readings of these films show, it is “precisely intimate tactile contact (typically prohibited in a familial relationship, yet compulsory in a sexual one) that functions as a fulcrum across which this process of displacement operates.” The critical exploration of sensuous tactility, intimacy, and alienation in a nexus of male romantic, erotic, and ethical relationships boils down to one deeply touching image, both literally and metaphorically: the touching hand.]\n\nSato, Tadao. “A Passage to Taiwan.” Cinemaya 15 (1992): 4-8.\n\nScruggs, Bert M. “The Postcolonial Appearance of Colonial Taiwan: Film and Memory.” Frontiers of Literary Studies in China 7, 2 (2013): 194-213.\n\n[Abstract: This preliminary consideration of genre and memory explores the appearance of colonial Taiwan in the work of Japanese and Taiwan filmmakers. Visuality and identification in cinema, the pragmatic and affective dimensions of memory, and the colonial and postcolonial viewing subject are discussed. Also noted in this essay are the apparatuses of recording and reproducing music and the human voice, ideologies, and time in Taiwan during the twentieth century. The examination of postcolonial and colonial documentaries and postcolonial fiction films suggests that colonial filmmakers often demonstrate a utopian outlook, while postcolonial cinema tends to adopt a dystopian, retrospective gaze. These examinations, in turn, comprise a reflection, on multiple levels, of diegetic register and on the uniquely Taiwanese visual and aural aspects of these multi-lingual films. In summary, this article is an attempt to highlight the powerful and sometimes subversive uses of film in the propagation and circulation of a postcolonial Taiwanese identity which transcends national boundaries, and the polarizing, moribund research that they engender, so that scholars might better understand the postcolonial condition.]\n\nShen, Shiao-Ying. “Where Has All the Capital Gone?

Why were these years the ‘last’, and who was watching? This article makes use of newspaper articles, advertisements, and the numbers, but focuses on questions of style. The 1969 film Zhang Di Seeks A-Zu, featuring pop singer Zhang Di and opera star Yang Lihua, well articulates the comedic and camp aesthetics of this period, as well as the renewed importance of opera culture across different media. These aesthetics gesture towards a particular audience and viewing culture, while offering alternative values to classical realist cinema.]\n\n—–. “Two Fools: Comedy as Dialectical Tension in mid-century Chinese Cinemas.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 12, 2 (2018): 127-41.\n\n[Abstract: Essay traces the complex lineage of Brother Wang and Brother Liu in Taiwanese cinema, beginning with the emergence of a ‘two fools’ (兩傻) genre in imported cinema from Hollywood and Hong Kong, a category which included classic Laurel and Hardy, late Abbott and Costello, the more contemporary Martin and Lewis, Cantonese song and dance film and Mandarin comedies from Cathay featuring the likes of King Hu, Liu Enjia and Jiang Guangchao. When the two fools genre was adapted in Taiwan, an additional social allegory of mainlander and islander solidarity came to the fore: thin actor Zhong Fucai was a local, while fat actor Li Guanzhang arrived from mainland China after 1949. Their unshakeable solidarity and many shared feasts suggest a utopian dimension to the comedy duo, in which homosocial friendship transcends all differences. The visual iconicity of their bodies sharing the frame and the low quality of sound in taiyupian meant that these films often leaned upon the plasmatic appeal of physical comedy instead of dialogue for comic effect, an aesthetic that would continue to dominate taiyupian comedies until the end of the 1960s.]\n\n—–. “No Longer Bond’s Girl: Historical Displacements of the Top Female Spy in 1960s Taiyupian.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 14, 20 (2020): 72-75.\n\nShih, Shu-mei. “Gender and a Geopolitical Desire: The Seduction of Mainland Women in Taiwan and Hong Kong Media.” In Mayfair Mei Hui Yang, ed.Spaces of Their Own: Women’s Public Sphere in Transnational China.

Puppets, Gods, and Brands: Theorizing the Age of Animation from Taiwan. Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 2019. [MCLC Resource Center review by Evelyn Shih]\n\n[Abstract: The early twenty-first century has seen an explosion of animation. Cartoon characters are everywhere—in cinema, television, and video games and as brand logos. There are new technological objects that seem to have lives of their own—from Facebook algorithms that suggest products for us to buy to robots that respond to human facial expressions. The ubiquity of animation is not a trivial side-effect of the development of digital technologies and the globalization of media markets. Rather, it points to a paradigm shift. In the last century, performance became a key term in academic and popular discourse: The idea that we construct identities through our gestures and speech proved extremely useful for thinking about many aspects of social life. The present volume proposes an anthropological concept of animation as a contrast and complement to performance: The idea that we construct social others by projecting parts of ourselves out into the world might prove useful for thinking about such topics as climate crisis, corporate branding, and social media. Like performance, animation can serve as a platform for comparisons of different cultures and historical eras. Teri Silvio presents an anthropology of animation through a detailed ethnographic account of how characters, objects, and abstract concepts are invested with lives, personalities, and powers—and how people interact with them—in contemporary Taiwan. The practices analyzed include the worship of wooden statues of Buddhist and Daoist deities and the recent craze for cute vinyl versions of these deities, as well as a wildly popular video fantasy series performed by puppets. She reveals that animation is, like performance, a concept that works differently in different contexts, and that animation practices are deeply informed by local traditions of thinking about the relationships between body and soul, spiritual power and the material world. The case of Taiwan, where Chinese traditions merge with Japanese and American popular culture, uncovers alternatives to seeing animation as either an expression of animism or as “playing God.” Looking at the contemporary world through the lens of animation will help us rethink relationships between global and local, identity and otherness, human and non-human.]\n\nSterk, Darryl. “Ironic Indigenous Primitivism: Taiwan’s First ‘Native Feature’ in an Era of Ethnic Tourism.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 8, 3 (2014): 209-225.\n\n[Abstract: How do contemporary indigenous filmmakers regard primitivism? By way of reply, this article examines Laha Mebow’s appropriation of a primitive Sayun in her 2011 film Finding Sayun. ‘The beautiful maiden’ Sayun was used in the 1943 Japanese film Sayon’s Bell to promote wartime mobilization in Taiwan, and has been used since the 1990s in local branding. Mebow seems ambivalent about Sayun: she identifies with Sayun, or at least with the Sayun inFinding Sayun, yet never loses critical distance. Mebow’s ambivalence plays out as generic hybridity: Finding Sayun is at once a metafilm, a documentary and a search for roots. Her ambivalence also plays out as irony, and this article argues that, in an era of ethnic tourism, ironic indigenous primitivism is a tactic of packaging a community and then getting a viewer or visitor to open up the package and see what’s inside.]\n\nSu, Chih-heng. “Colour Glass Ceiling: The Life and Death of Taiwanese-language Cinema.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 14, 20 (2020): 76-87.\n\nA Survey of the Motion Picture Industry in the Republic of China.

This implies that the New Cinema movement was ultimately the result of a carefully orchestrated policy on the part of the Taiwan authority. In truth, however, the New Cinema was more accidental than planned. The initial factors behind the movement were more domestic in orientation than foreign; the movement represented a makeshift attempt to save a domestic film industry that was slowly dying. The multiple awards received by Taiwanese filmmakers were thus unexpected benefits, which the authority and others were slow to recognize. Regardless of its origins, however, the New Cinema’s lasting impact is undeniable. To this day, many of the controversies first raised about the New Cinema remain core issues for Taiwan cinema.]\n\n—–. “Taiwanese Comedies under the Shadow of the Chinese Market.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 12, 2 (2018): 174-86.\n\n[Abstract: Comedy is arguably the most local of genres. Tropical Fish (1995) is a Taiwanese comedy that made no effort to disguise its local flavour, and was largely unseen outside of Taiwan. Recent Taiwanese comedies such as You Are the Apple of My Eye (2011), The Wonderful Wedding (2015) and Our Times (2015) have achieved not only success in Taiwan, but also unprecedented box office in the mainland Chinese market. Compared to Tropical Fish, all three films also seemingly tone down the local flavour to varying degrees. This is due to the irresistible pull of recent opportunities posed by the astronomical growth of the mainland Chinese market. This paper will analyze the economic forces that have resulted in changes in Taiwanese comedies themselves while at the same time showing that there are varying textual strategies for dealing with the ‘local’ flavour in this new economic climate where the booming Chinese market now has become a major consideration.]\n\nWang, Chun-chi. “Affinity and Difference between Japanese Cinema and Taiyu pian through a Comparative Study of Japanese and Taiyu pian Melodramas.” The Wenshan Review of Literature and Culture 6, 1 (Dec. 2012): 71-102.\n\n—–. “A Lurking Amivalence: The Discourse on Female Taiyupian Stars’ Experiences in Hong Kong.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 14, 20 (2020): 101-14.\n\nWang, George Chun Han. “A Brief History of Taiwanese Comedy Cinema.” Archiv orientální 90, 3 (2022): 595-616.\n\nWang, Junqi 王君琦, ed.

More specifically, Home Sweet Home provides an insight into the official position that the Chinese Nationalist Party (Guomindang, KMT) held with regard to Taiwanese students who studied abroad in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This article presents a schematic historical contextualization of the film and Bai Jingrui’s biographical background. I then focus on potential discrepancies between the projection of state policy and the formal elements of editing, setting and representations of psychological turmoil among the film’s primary characters.

However, since the democratization of the political landscape in Taiwan, Taiwanese cinema has become internationally fluid. As the case studies in this book demonstrate, filmmakers such as Hou Hsiao-hsien, Edward Yang, Tsai Ming-liang, and Ang Lee each engage with international audience expectations. New Taiwanese Cinema in Focus therefore presents the Taiwanese New Wave and Second Wave movements with an emphasis on intertextuality, citation and trans-cultural dialogue. Wilson argues that the cinema of Taiwan since the 1980s should be read emblematically; that is, as a representation of the greater paradox that exists in national and transnational cinema studies. She argues that these unlikely relationships create the need for a new way of thinking about ‘transnationalism’ altogether, making this an essential read for advanced students and scholars in both Film Studies and Asian Studies.]\n\nWu, Chia-Chi. “Festivals, Criticism and International Reputation of Taiwan New Cinema.” In Darrell William Davis and Ru-Shou Robert Chen, eds., Cinema Taiwan: Politics, Popularity and State of the Arts.

First, this article examines the historical significance and political reconstruction of the White Terror in response to the development and adaptation of Detention, while taking into account its multi-layered source material in history, cult culture, literature, and cinema. Historically bound, Detention blends foreign and local horror, fostering the gamers’ and viewers’ imagination of darkness embedded in the realm of the unknown and the dead. Second, this article brings into focus the mix of historical pain and horror genre with respect to the ghostly youth and monstrous past in Detention. The digital and cinematic remakes of the White Terror mediate the unaccountable trauma via the techno-enhanced immersive horror across screens. This unique strategy speaks to the gamers and spectators alike, especially the young generation, with profundity in the new age of entertainment. Third, this article identifies Detention as a political allegory in relation to the socio-cultural anxieties shared by the majority of the Taiwanese subjects in the contemporary era. In a political light, it not only echoes the ongoing campaign of transitional justice as promoted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the island, but also points to the universal pursuit of freedom and democracy against any totalitarian regime in the twenty-first century.]\n\nWu, Meiling. “Postsadness Taiwan New Cinema: Eat, Drink, Everyman, Everywoman.” In Sheldon Lu and Yueh-Yu Yeh, eds., Chinese-Language Film: Historiography, Poetics, Politics.

In this article, I would explore the contours of Xiaoqingxin Film in four aspects: (1) a tentative definition; (2) a style analysis; (3) a cause analysis: why Taiwan has overwhelming superiority in making this sub-genre; (4) a unique distribution mode. To provide a style analysis of Xiaoqingxin Film, I will not only observe its script, sound and cinematography, but also look into its genre bending. To conduct a media capital analysis of Xiaoqingxin Film, I would borrow the concept of “media capital” from Michael Curtin and pay particular attention to the fact that co-productions between Taiwan and Mainland China are popping up as Taiwan has relaxed trade embargoes with Mainland China. As shown by the successive box-office hits, the pan-Asian commercial success of Xiaoqingxin Film is not a one-hit wonder.

By examining three science fiction films made in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Chinese mainland in the late 1970s and early 1980s—that is, The Super Inframan(Zhongguo chaoren, 1975), God of War (Zhanshen, 1976), and Death Ray on Coral Island (Shanhudao shang de siguang, 1980)—this paper analyzes the ideologies and anxieties behind such encounters. These films present different “Chinese” pictures, revealing the fluidity of Chineseness, as well as the variety of frameworks within the genre of Chinese-language science fiction films. In this time of globalization, it is important to examine these early science fiction films in order to explore the relation between local social concerns and their artistic presentation.]\n\nYe Longyan 葉龍彥.

Beyond the conventional framework of privileging “New and Post-New Cinema,” or prominence of auteurs or single films, this volume is a comprehensive, judicious take on Taiwan cinema that fills gaps in the literature, offers a renewed historiography, and introduces new creative force and voices of Taiwan’s moving image culture to produce a leading and accessible work on Taiwan film and culture. Film-by-film is conceived as the main carrier of moving picture imagery for a majority of viewers, across the world. The curation offers an array of formal, historical, genre, sexual, social, and political frames, which provide a rich brew of contexts. This surfeit of meanings is carried by individual films, one by one, which breaks down abstractions into narrative bites and outsized emotions.]\n\nYeh, Long-Yann. “Historical Analysis of ‘Taipei Experience’ in Taiwanese-language Cinema.” In Chen Ruxiu, ed., Xunzhao dianying zhong de Taibei (Focus on Taipei through Cinema).

Durham: Duke University Press, 2004.\n\n[Abstract: In discussions of postcolonial nationhood and cultural identity, Taiwan is often overlooked. Yet the island—with its complex history of colonization—presents a particularly fascinating case of the struggle to define a “nation.” While the mainland Chinese government has been unequivocal in its resistance to Taiwanese independence, in Taiwan, government control has gradually passed from mainland Chinese immigrants to the Taiwanese themselves. Two decades of democratization and the arrival of consumer culture have made the island a truly global space. Envisioning Taiwan sorts through these complexities, skillfully weaving together history and cultural analysis to give a picture of Taiwanese identity and a lesson on the usefulness and the limits of contemporary cultural theory. Yip traces a distinctly Taiwanese sense of self vis-à-vis China, Japan, and the West through two of the island’s most important cultural movements: the hsiang-t’u (or “nativist”) literature of the 1960s and 1970s, and the Taiwanese New Cinema of the 1980s and 1990s. At the heart of the book are close readings of the work of the hsiang-t’u writer Hwang Chun-ming and the New Cinema filmmaker Hou Hsiao-hsien. Key figures in Taiwan’s assertion of a national identity separate and distinct from China, both artists portray in vibrant detail daily life on the island. Through Hwang’s and Hou’s work and their respective artistic movements, Yip explores “the imagining of a nation” on the local, national, and global levels. In the process, she exposes a perceptible shift away from traditional models of cultural authenticity toward a more fluid, postmodern hybridity—an evolution that reflects both Taiwan’s peculiar multicultural reality and broader trends in global culture.]\n\n—–. “Toward the Postmodern: Taiwanese New Cinema and Alternative Visions of Nation.” In Yip, Envisioning Taiwan: Fiction Cinema and the Nation in the Cultural Imaginary.

The book relates this important topic to the wider social, cultural, and institutional context, and discusses the relationship between the films and the changes that today are transforming each society. Among the areas explored are the differences between the three film industries, their creation of new types of screen hero and heroine, and their conflicts with traditional Chinese attitudes such as respect for age. The many films discussed provide fresh perspectives on the ways in which young people are coping with gender, sexuality, class, coming of age, the pressures of education, and major social shifts such as rural to urban migration. They show young adults in each society striving to construct new value systems for a complex, rapidly changing environment.]\n\nHong Kong\n\nAbbas, Ackar. “The New Hong Kong Cinema and the Deja Disparu.” Discourse 16, 3 (1994): 65-77.\n\n—–. “Dialectics of Deception.” Public Culture 11, 2 (1999): 347-63.

Yet, when Ian Aitken and Michael Ingham challenged this assumption, they discovered a rich cinematic tradition, dating back to the 1890s. Under-researched and often forgotten, documentary film-making in Hong Kong includes a thriving independent documentary film movement, a large archive of documentaries made by the colonial film units, and a number of classic British Official Films. Case studies from all three categories are examined in this book, including The Battle of Shanghai, The Sea and the Sky, Rising Sun and The Hong Kong Case. In-depth discussion and analysis of more recent Hong Kong independent documentaries focuses on works such as Cheung King-wai’s KJ: A Life in Music and films by Tammy Cheung and Evans Chan. With a particular focus on how these films address the historico-political dimension of their time, Hong Kong Documentary Film introduces students and scholars in Film Studies to this fascinating and largely unexplored cinematic tradition.]\n\nAnderson, D.

This resonates with a long tradition of subjugating Wang’s work within the context of other, much more integral figures, in which the cultural and economic motivators for his filmic aesthetics are insufficiently considered. Similarly, various elements of Wang’s work, especially his purported anti-Japanism, have long been subjected to conjecture and simplification, or else an overreliance on the incorporation of biographical details into textual analyses of his films. This article aims to disentangle and clarify the myths and misconceptions that complicate the story of Wang’s career. To avoid repeating prior mistakes – i.e., to prevent the narrative distortion of associated figures within Wang’s narrative – the article will use the political economy of cinema as a guiding framework. The overall aim is to present a decentralized view of The Chinese Boxer (1970) to evaluate the cultural and material factors that motivated Wang’s career peak and the film for which he is most remembered.]\n\nBarnard, Timothy P. “The Shaw Brothers’ Malay Films.” In Poshek Fu, ed., China Forever: The Shaw Brothers and Diasporic Cinema.

Dwelling on the world of signification conjured up through what I call the jianghu filmic imaginary,the analysis focuses on the ideological and utopian impulses registered in relation to a whole emotional complex of anxiety, bewilderment and despair in the works of some highly creative local filmmakers of the genre: Ching Siu-Tong, Ann Hui, Tsui Hark and Wong KarWai. The study draws theoretically from Castoriadis’s notion of the social imaginary and Bloch’s aesthetics of hope, to focus on the textual and contextual re-constructions of a number of very unconventional martial arts swordplay (wuxia) films made in Hong Kong in the last two decades: namely, Tsui’s Butterfly Murders (1979), Hui’s Romance of Book and Sword (1987), Ching/Tsui’s Swordsman II (1992), and Wong’s Ashes of Time (1994). By identifying the ideological and affective moments in the filmic imaginary,I want to trace what has been left in a ruined culture for utopian longings, and point to the presence/absence of ‘hope’ as the cultural imagination for an unknown and unknowable future (beyond 1997). It is my contention that an understanding of that peculiar form of popular imaginary at the unusual juncture of Hong Kong’s history can begin with a critical attempt to cope with this subtle practice of hope, so as to recognize (or reject) it as mediation in the process of our collective cultural crisis, anticipation and identification.]\n\nChang, Jing Jing. Screening Communities: Negotiating Narratives of Empire, Nation, and the Cold War in Hong Kong Cinema. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2019.\n\n[Abstract: Postwar Hong Kong cinema played an active role in building the colony’s community in the 1950s and 1960s. To Jing Jing Chang, the screening of movies in postwar Hong Kong was a process of showing the filmmakers’ visions for Hong Kong society and simultaneously an attempt to conceal their anxieties and mask their political agenda. It was a time when the city was a site of intense ideological struggles among the colonial government, Chinese Nationalists, and Communist sympathizers. The medium of film was recognized as a powerful tool for public persuasion and various camps competed to win over the hearts and minds of the audience. Screening Communities thus situates the history of postwar Hong Kong cinema at the intersection of Cold War politics, Chinese culture, and local society.]\n\nChang, Li-Mei. “Whose Fatal Ways: Mapping the Boundary and Consuming the Other in Border Crossing Films.” In See-kam Tan, Peter X.

It subsequently gave rise to a peculiar genre in Cantonese cinema, film adaptations of “airwave novels” (天空小說電影), which flourished in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. According to the records of the Hong Kong Film Archive, from 1949 to 1968 there were ninety-three film adaptations of radio novels and dramas. Besides drawing the historical contours of the radio-film network in the postwar colonial city, this article studies two exemplary radio stories-turned-films, Niehai chihun 孽海痴魂 (A Devoted Soul; 1949) and Cimu lei 慈母淚 (A Mother’s Tears; 1953), and scrutinizes their transmedial/transnational adaptation trajectories to shed light on intermedia aesthetic criticisms. This article describes how film technology reconstituted the oral and spoken in audiovisual space, in particular the embodiment and representation of the radio acoustic. The voice-over, indicative of the radio unconscious in the film, registers the existence of a consciousness already programmed by radio sounds that reconfigures the economy of filmic diegesis. This article further investigates how such medium self-reflexivity in the form of voice-overs destabilized the Manichean structure of melodrama as an established genre in Cantonese cinema, thus making space for forms of female agency amidst contending ideologies in early Cold War.]\n\nCheng, Pei-Pei. “Reminiscences of the Life of an Actress in Shaw Brothers’ Movietown.” Trs.

Its warm reception by audiences not only in Hong Kong, but in large parts of the Chinese diaspora, was because the wuxia pian — known as the martial arts movie to the West — had belonged to a long historical literary and political culture that traces back to China’s imperial past. Far from a novelty, the wuxia pian was a modernized visual medium with themes and characters that were already familiar to people who read and watched plays, operas, and wuxia novels. Moreover, wuxia filmmakers were not mere imitators of the latest cinematic advances from Hollywood, but instead were innovators interested in recreating the splendor of the past through cinema, drawing inspiration from traditional stories, music, and fighting techniques while experimenting with western film technology and theory. Through the looking glass of popular culture, this book explores what defined Chineseness in one of the most chaotic and fractious periods of Chinese history.]\n\nChong, Woei Lien, “Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Fruit Chan’s Little Cheung: Two Chinese Highlights at the 2001 International Rotterdam Film Festival.” China Information 15, 1 (2001): 166-196.\n\nChow, Yiu-fai and Jeroen de Kloet. “Flânerie and Acrophilia in the Postmetropolis: Rooftops in Hong Kong Cinema.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 7, 2 (2013): 139-55.\n\nChoy, Howard Y.F. “Schizophrenic Hong Kong: Postcolonial Identity Crisis in the Infernal Affairs Trilogy.” Transtexts(e)s transcultures: Journal of Global Cultural Studies 3 (2007).\n\nChu, Blanche. “The Ambivalence of History: Nostalgia Films Understood in the Post-Colonial Context.” Hong Kong Cultural Studies Bulletin 8/9 (Spring/Summer 1998): 41-54.\n\nChu, Rolanda. “Swordsman II and The East is Red: The ‘Hong Kong Film,’ Entertainment, and Gender.” Bright Lights Film Journal 13 (1994): 30-35, 46.\n\nChu, Yingchi.

It shows how Hong Kong’s leftist cinema built up an ‘in-between’ identity by conflating entertainment and edification, PRC concerns and the Hong Kong experience, and how it struggled to survive the multiple political confinements imposed by the Hong Kong government and the US and Taiwanese powers in Hong Kong, and the PRC’s periodic policies in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper argues that the dynamics of Hong Kong leftist cinema came from their dislocated position in both the socialist system/mainland China and the capitalist system/Hong Kong; meanwhile Hong Kong leftist cinemas’ difficulties lay in the border-crossing limits between the two systems.]\n\nEberhard, Wolfram.

Extraterritoriality scrutinises creative works in mainstream cinema, independent films, television, video artworks and documentaries – especially those by marginalised artists – actively rewriting and reconfiguring how Hong Kong cinema and media are to be defined and located.]\n\n—–. “Code-Mixing and Code-Switching in Classical Hong Kong Cinemas.” Concentric: Literary and Cultural Studies 49, 1 (2023): 27-47.\n\n[Abstract: Code-switching and -mixing have been prominent in Hong Kongers’ speech patterns. Yet, cinematic representations of these two practices seem to be rare in studio-produced films and have only emerged in experimental and independent films since the 1990s. In this article, I argue that the discrepancy between the commonplaceness of code-switching and -mixing in Hong Kongers’ everyday speech and its lack of representation in the cinema is deceptive. If we understand code-switching and -mixing not only as an interlinguistic practice, but also as intertopolectic (between different topolects) and intratopolectic (between registers of a topolect of language), code-switching and -mixing have always been part of Hong Kong cinema as narrational devices. Moreover, in some cinematic cases, code-switching and -mixing may be transposed to the level of film forms. In this article, I will first provide an overview of how code-switching and -mixing in Hong Kong have been discussed by linguists and point out some blind spots in their arguments. I will then conduct a comparative investigation into Cantonese literature and classical Cantonese cinema from the 1930s to the 1950s and demonstrate how interlinguistic, intertopolectic, and intratopolectic switching and mixing have always been part of it. I will then conduct a similar investigation into Cold War Mandarin literature in Hong Kong and its use of code-switching and -mixing, which will shed light on how Mandarin cinema in the 1950s transposes these practices to film forms. In both cases, code-switching and -mixing in the cinema negotiate the conflicting social relationships of the time.]\n\nFeng, Lin. “Star Endorsement and Hong Kong Cinema: The Social Mobility of Chow Yun-fat, 1986-1995.” Journal of Chinese Cinemas 5, 3 (Nov. 2012): 269-.\n\n[Abstract: Cinema has long been connected with the mass consumption in our society. This article uses Chinese star Chow Yun-fat as a case study to investigate the construction of a male star’s image as fashion and lifestyle icon in Hong Kong’s consumer culture between 1986 and 1995. In addition to examining the Chow’s star image in local advertisements released during the period of time, this article also explores the complex interaction of Chow’s cinematic persona with his extra-cinematic image in Hong Kong’s consumer culture. This article argues that the interaction between Chow’s on-screen images and his presence in consumer commercials creates a public space for Hong Kong’s new middle-class citizens to articulate the rise of their political and economic power, and to openly express their emerging sense of self.]\n\nFeng, Peter X. “False Consciousness and Double Conscioiusness: Race, Virtual Reality, and the Assimiliation of Hong Kong Action Cinema in The Matrix.” In See-kam Tan, Peter X.
