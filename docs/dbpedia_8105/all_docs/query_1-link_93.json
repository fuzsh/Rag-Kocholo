        "text": "Lai last month appointed Cho Jung-tai, 65, a former DPP chairman, as his cabinet chief.\n\nThe new cabinet, known as the Executive Yuan, is made up of 34 members – 26 men and just eight women, with an average age of 62.\n\nKey appointments include Cheng Li-chun, 54, a former culture minister, who was selected as Cho’s deputy and whose ties with cultural and civil groups could bolster support for Lai, particularly among young people.\n\nOther notable appointments include Kung Ming-hsin, 60, the cabinet’s new secretary general. Kung succeeds Li Meng-yen, and with his background in macroeconomics, Kung will play a role in coordinating between ministries on Taiwan’s national development policy. He recently proposed a review of the island’s energy policy to tackle the issue of power shortages.\n\nLin Chia-lung, 60, is the new foreign minister, succeeding Joseph Wu, who is now secretary general of Taiwan’s security council. Lin, who was previously secretary general of Tsai’s presidential office, is well-versed in the former leader’s foreign policy and is expected to align closely with her approach.\n\nWellington Koo, 65, succeeds Chiu Kuo-cheng as defence minister. As former secretary general of the security council, Koo is familiar with the US arms sales process and has been a primary conduit for Washington’s proposals on arms deals and strategic warfare concepts for the island. A key focus for Koo will be to advance transitional justice initiatives and eradicate authoritarian symbols within the military, particularly those linked to the late Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nChiu Chui-cheng, 58, takes the helm of the policymaking Mainland Affairs Council. Former deputy head of the council, Chiu has a strong background in cross-strait affairs and is regarded as a moderate who advocates for a pragmatic approach to engaging with Beijing.\n\nLiu Shyh-fang, 64, is the new interior minister, succeeding Lin Yu-chang. The cabinet’s former deputy secretary general and DPP lawmaker, Liu brings a wealth of knowledge in civil and human rights issues. She is a long-time vocal critic of Beijing.\n\nKuo Chih-hui, 71, also known as JW Kuo, a prominent figure in the semiconductor industry, is the economic affairs minister. A newcomer to Taiwan politics, Kuo has been entrusted with continuing Tsai’s strategy of reducing economic reliance on mainland China. Kuo is a co-founder of Topco Scientific, a supplier of electronic components that reportedly maintains business investments on the mainland.\n\nChuang Tsui-yun, 66, stays on as finance minister. Chuang was deputy finance minister before she took up the top job last year – the third woman to do so. A veteran with the finance ministry, Chuang began her career at the national property bureau in 1987."
