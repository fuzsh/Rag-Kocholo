        "text": "The nominations for the 17th annual Moët British Independent Film Awards were announced recently, at St Martins Lane, London by actor Jared Harris .\n\nJoint Directors, The Moët British Independent Film Awards’ Johanna von Fischer & Tessa Collinson said: \"This has been a record year for Mbifa with over 250 films submitted giving our dedicated members their toughest challenge to date. Hugely impressed by the quality of films and performances across all categories the shortlist demonstrates how the standard of creativity in British independent filmmaking continues to flourish year on year. The decision of who will walk away with one of the iconic Mbifa trophies* is now in the hands of our distinguished independent jury announced today. We are looking forward to seeing as many of the nominees as possible at the Awards on 7th December, to celebrate their incredible achievements.

Raindance congratulates all the talented filmmakers whose wonderful films make up this year's Mbifa nominations.”\n\nThe Pre-Selection Committee of over 70 members viewed a record breaking 250 plus films this year, out of which they selected the nominations, which were decided by ballot.\n\nThe winners of The Moët British Independent Film Awards are decided by an independent jury comprised of leading professionals and talent from the British film industry.\n\nIt was also announced that the Oscar® and BAFTA - winning Director Tom Hopper, whose film \"The King’s Speech\" picked up five awards, including Best British Independent Film at the 2010 Moët British Independent Film Awards, will chair the Jury who will decide the winners of the 2014 awards.\n\nHooper commented: \"I am honoured to preside over the Moët Bifa jury this year. It has been an extremely strong year for filmmaking here in Britain and I am looking forward to helping the very best of this year's independent films, get the recognition they deserve.\"\n\nThe Jury for 2014 includes: Jury Chair – Tom Hooper (Director), Jonathan Romney (Writer, Director), Jon S.

With Moët & Chandon being the champagne of choice for celebration at international film festivals and award ceremonies, we are delighted to toast to the success of all nominees, including those for the ‘Best British Independent Film’ award sponsored by Moët & Chandon.”\n\nThe winners will be announced at the much anticipated 17th awards ceremony on Sunday 7 December at the impressive Old Billingsgate in London.\n\nThe Moët British Independent Film Awards is proud to announce the following nominees for this year’s awards:\n\nBest British Independent Film\n\nSponsored by Moët & Chandon\n\n\"'71\"\n\n\"Calvary\"\n\n\"Mr Turner\"\n\n\"Pride\"\n\n\"The Imitation Game\"\n\nBest Director\n\nSponsored by AllCity & Intermission\n\nJohn Michael McDonagh – \"Calvary\"\n\nLenny Abrahamson – \"Frank\"\n\nMatthew Warchus – \"Pride\"\n\nMike Leigh – \"Mr Turner\"\n\nYann Demange – \"'71\"\n\nThe Douglas Hickox Award [Best Debut Director]\n\nSponsored by 3 Mills Studios\n\nDaniel Wolfe, Matthew Wolfe – \"Catch Me Daddy\"\n\nHong Khaou – \"Lilting\"\n\nIain Forsyth, Jane Pollard – \"20,000 Days on Earth\"\n\nMorgan Matthews – \"X+Y\"\n\nYann Demange – \"'71\"\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nSponsored by BBC Films\n\nGraham Moore – \"The Imitation Game\"\n\nGregory Burke – \"'71\"\n\nJohn Michael McDonagh – \"Calvary\"\n\nJon Ronson, Peter Straughan – \"Frank\"\n\nStephen Beresford – \"Pride\"\n\nBest Actress\n\nSponsored by M.A.C Cosmetics\n\nAlicia Vikander – \"Testament of Youth\"\n\nCheng Pei Pei – \"Lilting\"\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw – \"Belle\"\n\nKeira Knightley – \"The Imitation Game\"\n\nSameena Jabeen Ahmed – \"Catch Me Daddy\"\n\nBest Actor\n\nSponsored by Movado\n\nAsa Butterfield – \"X+Y\"\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch – \"The Imitation Game\"\n\nBrendan Gleeson – \"Calvary\"\n\nJack O'Connell – \"'71\"\n\nTimothy Spall – \"Mr Turner\"\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nDorothy Atkinson – \"Mr Turner\"\n\nImelda Staunton – \"Pride\"\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal – \"Frank\"\n\nSally Hawkins –\"X+Y\"\n\nSienna Guillory – \"The Goob\"\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSponsored by St Martins Lane\n\nAndrew Scott – \"Pride\"\n\nBen Schnetzer – \"Pride\"\n\nMichael Fassbender – \"Frank\"\n\nRafe Spall – \"X+Y\"\n\nSean Harris – \"‘71\"\n\nMost Promising Newcomer\n\nBen Schnetzer – \"Pride\"\n\nCara Delevingne – \"The Face of An Angel\"\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw – \"Belle\"\n\nLiam Walpole – \"The Goob\"\n\nSameena Jabeen Ahmed – \"Catch Me Daddy\"\n\nBest Achievement In Production\n\n\"'71\"\n\n\"20,000 Days on Earth\"\n\n\"Catch Me Daddy\"\n\n\"Lilting\"\n\n\"The Goob\"\n\nBest Technical Achievement\n\nChris Wyatt - Editing - \"'71\"\n\nDick Pope - Cinematography -\"Mr Turner\"\n\nRobbie Ryan - Cinematography - \"Catch Me Daddy\"\n\nStephen Rennicks - Music – \"Frank\"\n\nTat Radcliffe - Cinematography - \"'71\"\n\nBest DocumentarY\n\n\"20,000 Days on Earth\"\n\n\"Next Goal Wins\"\n\n\"Night Will Fall\"\n\n\"The Possibilities Are Endless\"\n\n\"Virunga\"\n\nBest British Short\n\n\"Crocodile\"\n\n\"Emotional Fusebox\"\n\n\"Keeping Up With The Joneses\"\n\n\"Slap\"\n\n\"The Kármán Line\"\n\nBest International Independent Film\n\n\"Blue Ruin\"\n\n\"Boyhood\"\n\n\"Fruitvale Station\"\n\n\"Ida\"\n\n\"The Badadook\"\n\nThe Raindance Award\n\n\"Flim: The Movie..\".\n\n\"Gregor\"\n\n\"Luna\"\n\n\"Keeping Rosy\"\n\n\"The Beat Beneath My Feet\"\n\nThe Richard Harris Award (for outstanding contribution by an actor to British Film)\n\nTo Be Announced\n\nThe Variety Award\n\nTo Be Announced\n\nThe Special Jury Prize\n\nAnnounced at the Moët British Independent Film Awards on Sunday 7th December\n\nNow in its 17th year, the Awards were created by Raindance in 1998 and set out to celebrate merit and achievement in independently funded British filmmaking, to honour new talent, and to promote British films and filmmaking to a wider public.\n\nPrevious winners of the prestigious Best British Independent Film Award include \"Metro Manila,\" \"Tyrannosaur,\" \"The King's Speech,\" \"Moon,\" \"Control,\" \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" \"The Constant Gardener\" and \"This is England\"\n\nProud supporters and patrons of The Moët British Independent Film Awards include Mike Figgis, Tom Hollander, Adrian Lester, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Helen Mirren, Samantha Morton, James Nesbitt, Michael Sheen, Trudie Styler, Tilda Swinton, Meera Syal, David Thewlis, Ray Winstone and Michael Winterbottom.\n\nThe Moët British Independent Film Awards would like to thank all its supporters, especially: Moët & Chandon, 3 Mills Studios, BBC Films, M.A.C Cosmetics, Movado, Raindance, St Martins Lane, Soho House, Swarovski, Variety, AllCity, Intermission."
