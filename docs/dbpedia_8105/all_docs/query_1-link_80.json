        "text": "HONG KONG – Fox International Productions will co-finance its first-ever production in Taiwan, writer-turned-director Giddens Ko’s follow-up to his 2011 hit You Are the Apple of My Eye.\n\nKung Fu, which like Apple is an adaptation of one of Ko’s own novels, will begin shooting next year, with a release date slated for 2015 with Twentieth Century Fox distributing, according to FIP. Comic Ritz is understood to be a co-financer on the project.\n\nPHOTOS: China Box Office: 10 Highest-Grossing Movies of All Time\n\nAt a press conference held in Taipei on Wednesday, Ko introduced a three-minute teaser made on a budget of $130,000 (NT$4 million). It features 6-year-old actress Chi Hsiao-hua, who makes her debut in the project.\n\nKung Fu revolves around a high-school student’s growing fascination with martial arts novels and how this changes his teenage life.\n\nPHOTOS: Robert Downey Jr. Goes to China\n\nBy financing rather just distributing the film, FIP is hedging its bets for Ko to repeat the success of Apple, which was a hit at home in Taiwan and, perhaps even more staggeringly, in Hong Kong, where its box-office revenues of $8 million (HK$61.9 million) propelled it past Stephen Chow’s Kung Fu Hustle to become the highest-grossing Chinese-language film ever released in the city."
