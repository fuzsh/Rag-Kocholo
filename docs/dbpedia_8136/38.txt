The village is situated on the slopes of Shooters Hill, part of the Dassett Hills and lies between the two main roads to Banbury, one from Coventry and one from Warwick. A recess in the rebuilt church has a thirteenth century coffin with an unusual carving of a deacon. The village is sometimes called Little Dassett or Dassett Parva.
