Nave window by Hardman Studios c1885.

Avon Dassett's Catholic church of St Joseph was built in 1854 using the local ironstone and is a charming example of early Victorian Gothic.

The church is modest in size but has an attractive interior (nave, chancel and south transept chapel) richly adorned with a complete set of stained glass windows by John Hardman Studios, including some very early examples of the studio's work in glass from the 1850s (richly coloured and designed though in some cases suffering from serious paint loss) in the main liturgical east and west windows, whilst a few lancets in the nave date from a few decades later.

The church is normally open only for services.
