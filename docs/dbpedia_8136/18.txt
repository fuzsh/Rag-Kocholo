Avon Carrow is located in Avon Dassett, the former residence of John Profumo, the Member of Parliament in the 1960 involved in a sex and spy scandal in that era.

The parish church of St John the Baptist is redundant. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade-II* listed building,[2] and is under the care of The Churches Conservation Trust.[3] The present building was built in 1868 on the site of an earlier church dating from the Norman era.[4] The architect was Charles Buckeridge.[3] The church was declared redundant on 11 May 1983, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. It is still used occasionally for concerts or community events.[5] Between May 2007 and September 2008 work was carried out on the spire at a cost of about Â£700,000, with the result that the church bells were rung on 21 February 2009, the first time for some decades.[5]
