        "meta_description": "On behalf of the people of the Parish Burton Dassett I warmly welcome you to All Saints’ church, a church near you, and hope that in due course we will have the pleasure of meeting you in person. The Parish which has two churches The Chapel of Ease in Northend and All Saints’ Church Burton Dassett is part of the Dassett Magna Group of Parishes. The church of All Saints’, a most beautiful and captivating Norman church is nestled in the Burton Dassett hills and known locally as the ‘Cathedral in the Hills’. Totally unspoilt, it was built in the 12th Century and in 2009 underwent an enormous restoration project to preserve and restore some of its medieval wall paintings. It is a very spiritual and tranquil place, of historical and architectural interest.\n\nWorship and Prayer are key to what we do and christians in small rural communities often feel called to worship locally, whatever their own denominations, churchmanship or ages. We value this diversity and are pleased that it is reflected in our pattern of worship across the month, which includes modern and traditional language Eucharists, informal Family Services, modern language Morning Prayer and traditional language Evening Prayer. You will find a wide range of styles of worship: from low key and quiet to grand and sometimes loud; traditional and formal to informal and creative. Services often include hymns - song is a wonderful way to worship God. There will be something in all our worship that will draw people of any age or background into a real experience of God’s loving presence in their lives and in the world. We also have live digital services online via ZOOM.\n\nLook at our service rota, plan your visit and we look forward to meeting you.\n\nSERVICES IN CHURCH each month at 11am\n\n1st Sunday - Holy Communion / Traditional Language Book of Common Prayer\n\nNovember to March - at the Chapel of Ease Northend\n\nApril to October- at All Saints’ Church Burton Dassett \n\n2nd Sunday - Morning Prayer - at the Chapel of Ease Northend  \n\n\n​3rd Sunday - Modern language Holy Communion - at the Chapel of Ease Northend\n\n​4th Sunday - Morning Prayer - at the Chapel of Ease Northend\n\n  \n\n\nLIVE DIGITAL SERVICES via Zoom\n\n11am Sunday - Live connection to ‘Worship in Church‘\n\n9.30am Monday to Friday - MORNING PRAYER  \n\n\nFor the services above please sign in to Zoom using the link below\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/84186737987?pwd=endRZlFPcFBKa0NheGk0aTFTQVBwQT09\n\nor use the following Meeting ID: 841 8673 7987 Password: 851314\n\n  \n\n\n6pm Monday to Friday - EVENING PRAYER\n\nTraditional Language - Book of Common Prayer\n\nFor the 6pm service please sign in to Zoom using the link below\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/87175428758?pwd=ZkVWUEZjanZuV1FMWG83Y0tldmcxdz09\n\nor use the following Meeting ID: 871 7542 8758 Password: 932651\n\n  \n\n\nWhether you have been to church before or are coming for the first time you are assured of a warm welcome!\n\n  \n\n\n\"The parish of Burton Dassett: All Saints is committed to the safeguarding of children, young people and adults.
