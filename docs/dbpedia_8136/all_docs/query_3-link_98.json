These recommendations put forth - backed by the data supplied by parishes - as well as future projections, illustrate our best faith effort to provide a plan that will ultimately strengthen the Catholic Church In Western New York.\n\nI understand these parish and worship site recommendations are difficult for many, as churches that have been home to generations of the faithful unfortunately have to merge and close for the future viability and vibrancy of our parishes and the diocese as a whole. Our effort to renew the diocese was hastened as we continue to work to satisfy the requirements of our Chapter 11 reorganization process.\n\nWe look forward over the next month to continue the dialogue with our parish leaders to decide on what is best for the diocese, and the faithful, moving forward. As always, you remain in my prayers, especially in light of this transformational time in our history.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
