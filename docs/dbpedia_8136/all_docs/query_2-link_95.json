        "text": "The numbers signing up for this walk kept steadily growing over the days leading up to the walk and we were a little concerned that the carpark might not be big enough.\n\nWe needn't have worried, our very own car park attendant, Superintendent Fuller arrived, not 1, not 2, but 24 hours early to ensure that order was maintained and that everybody parked in a sensible manner. In the end we had 22 walkers turn up, but thankfully not quite that many cars.\n\nWe left the lake side carpark at Farnborough heading out across the fields towards the village of Avon Dassett. Here we paused for a minute or two, just long enough for the group to humiliate me in the village stocks. I was less concerned about having rotten tomatoes thrown at me, and more about who was standing behind me!\n\nMoving on. we stopped in a nearby field for our coffee break.\n\nPassing through Burton Dassett church yard, we were soon arriving at the Burton Dassett Hills country park, and despite the chilly breeze on the hill top there were quite a few day trippers out enjoying the bracing air.\n\nWe paused to admire the views of Brailes Hill, Bredon Hill and in the distance The Malverns, and then looked for a slightly more sheltered spot for our lunch break.\n\nContinuing across more meadows we arrived at the village of Fenny Compton and then on to complete our circuit back in Farnborough.\n\nWith no nearby pub or tea shop suitable for afternoon refreshments, we decided to resurrect a Lockdown tradition of having tea and cake in the car park at the end of the walk.\n\nThe temperature had been a little chilly all day and so the mugs of tea were very welcome, along with the odd slice of cake, or three.\n\nThis was the first walk led by (another) Mark, and an excellent walk it turned out to be, and was clearly enjoyed by all who attended.\n\nThanks to Mark for leading the walk, to Bill for the loan of his table, and to Paul and Bill for taking the pictures."
