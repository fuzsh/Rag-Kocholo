        "text": "Avon Dassett is a village and parish in the Kington Hundred of Warwickshire, nestling among the Burton Dassett Hills about four miles east of Kineton and seven miles north of Banbury in Oxfordshire. According to the 2001 and the 2011 census' it had a population of 210.\n\nIsrael Tonge was at one stage appointed rector of Avon Dassett - although according to Tonge \"illegall practices\" prevented him taking up the position.[1]\n\nAvon Carrow is located in Avon Dassett, the former residence of John Profumo, the Member of Parliament in the 1960 involved in a sex and spy scandal in that era.\n\nThe parish church of St John the Baptist is redundant. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade-II* listed building,[2] and is under the care of The Churches Conservation Trust.[3] The present building was built in 1868 on the site of an earlier church dating from the Norman era.[4] The architect was Charles Buckeridge.[3] The church was declared redundant on 11 May 1983, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. It is still used occasionally for concerts or community events.[5] Between May 2007 and September 2008 work was carried out on the spire at a cost of about Â£700,000, with the result that the church bells were rung on 21 February 2009, the first time for some decades.[5]\n\nReferences\n\nWarwickshire Towns & Villages, by Geoff Allen (2000) ISBN 1-85058-642-X\n\n(\"Wikimedia Commons\" has material\n\nabout Avon Dassett)\n\nAvon Dassett Parish Council\n\nThis Warwickshire article is a stub: help to improve Wikishire"
