        "text": "OP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Friends,\n\nJust a question concerning the cult of these two Saints in both East and West.\n\nBoth Churches venerate the Mother of God with \"hyperdulia\" and the Theotokos is followed in the liturgical veneration by the Choirs of Holy Angels.\n\nAfter the Angels, the East honours John the Baptist and this most highly.\n\nThe cult of St Joseph came to the West from the East (via the Carmelites?).\n\nBut it would seem that the cult of St Joseph has developed much more highly than in the East.\n\nThe Latin Catholic view would see St Joseph as receiving the honour of \"Proto-dulia.\"\n\nBut in the East, the Forerunner is first after the Theotokos and the Angels.\n\nAny comments on this difference of emphasis on devotion to St Joseph? I understand that John the Baptist continues to be ahead of ST Joseph in the Litany of the Saints.\n\nOne of those questions I've always wanted to ask!\n\nAlex\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 2,532\n\nHi Alex,\n\nGood Monday morning!\n\nPresently in the Latin(I am trying to adjust to saying that instead of Roman) Catholic Church there just aren't the devotions to the saints to the extent there were when I was growing up prior to Vatican II although some have yet their private devotions and there is the litany said at the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. That is usually done weekly about once a year during Lent in most churches.\n\nInteresting question though and I have often wondered myself why the priority wasn't more towards the Baptist. I think the emphasis on St. Joseph over John the Baptist in the West was primarily due to St. Joseph being the spouse of Mary and foster father of Jesus, but I don't know where it started. As a kid I just knew it was a given. St. John the Baptist has , as you say, certainly been honored though.\n\nAn aside here I would like to share is that my mother has this huge devotion to Mary and Joseph. In fact she used to share that she wanted another baby so much she said a novena to St. Joseph and promised to name the baby, if it was a girl, Mary Josephine, after Mary and Joseph. It was a girl and here I am over 60 years later.\n\nActually I like the emphasis in the East better myself. I have always felt a certain kinship with the forerunner although I respect Joseph as well. It thrills me to see the icons of the forerunner in our Byzantine Catholic church.\n\nJust my nickel,\n\nPorter(Mary Jo)\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Friends,\n\nYes, it is interesting that the West believes that John the Baptist was actually conceived with the \"stain of Original Sin\" but was sanctified at the time of the Visitation.\n\nThis is one reason why the West has a feast of the Visitation, but not the Byzantine East.\n\nThe Byzantine tradition celebrates the Forerunner's Conception, meaning that, like the Theotokos, John was conceived in holiness!\n\nAs for St Nicholas, there is the feast of his Nativity on August 11 (OC).\n\nAs his Akathist shows, he was, by tradition, likewise conceived in holiness in his mother's womb which is why he was already born a saint!\n\nIn addition, St John the Theologian and Evangelist was translated bodily into heaven, according to the Byzantine liturgical tradition and according to the deuterocanonical book on him that that tradition is based on.\n\nSome have posited that the fact of his bodily translation and also his great personal purity and holiness COULD also mean that he was likewise sanctified at his conception . . .\n\nSt Joseph is honoured in the Byzantine East on the Sundays before and after the Nativity and also on the day of or after the feast itself (?).\n\nThe Oriental Orthodox also honour his repose on July 20th, the ancient date of his \"heavenly birthday.\" ( I don't know where the West got the date of March 19th, but I'm sure there was a good reason for it - the Melkites officially adopted that date for a separate feast of St Joseph).\n\nThe West's cult of St Joseph presents him as being a younger man when he married the Mother of God, a strong carpenter etc.\n\nThe East, on the other hand, presents Joseph as an elderly man, in his late eighties when he married the Virgin Mary - ostensibly to be her guardian.\n\nAnd, according to the deuterocanonical tradition, Joseph was a widower with six children from his previous marriage - his sons became disciples of Christ and Cleopas, Joseph's brother was among the two disciples who met the resurrected Christ on the road to Emmaus.\n\nIn addition, the East apparently forbids the depiction of St Joseph holding the Child Jesus (?).\n\nThese appear to be rather sharp differences between East and West over the cult of one so close to Christ.\n\nAlex\n\nOP\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 26,391\n\nLikes: 31\n\nDear Iconophile,\n\nThanks for sharing your devotion to St Joseph!\n\nGod bless your mother too!\n\nSt Joseph is our major Patron here in Canada, as you know, and his miraculous image is at the Basilica of Mount-Royal.\n\nBlessed Brother Andre prayed for the building of the Basilica and in his room his statue of St Joseph was always turned with his back to him, looking out the window.\n\nWhen asked about the peculiar position of the statue and why it wasn't facing him and others in the room, Bl. Andre said, \"He is looking across the street to where his shrine will one day stand!\"\n\nFinally, a poor carpenter with stomach cancer came and volunteered to work to build a shrine to St Joseph for Bl Andre. But, he said, how could he realistically do this since his condition prevented him from eating a proper meal so he could work?\n\nAt that, Bl. Andre, the man later said, looked at him and as he did, the carpenter felt a strange, wonderful warmth in his stomach.\n\n\"But St Joseph is healing you as we speak, is he not? said Bl. Andre with a smile . . .\n\nThe next day, the man ate his first full breakfast in a few years and got down to building the shrine!\n\nAlex"
