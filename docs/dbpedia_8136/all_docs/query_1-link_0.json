        "text": "A masterpiece of the Gothic Revival\n\nThis Victorian church, with its soaring spire, is a masterpiece built in fourteenth-century Gothic style and is set amongst trees in the Avon Dassett hills - a lovely place for a walk.\n\nCharles Buckeridge built it in golden Hornton sandstone in 1869 to replace a medieval church, which east window he reset in the west wall of the tower.\n\nThe high-ceilinged interior is inspiring and the style throughout is largely fourteenth century. The chancel remains a good example of a properly furnished sanctuary of the period, with oak altar and choirstalls, three stone seldilia and a grey Purbeck marble reredos with a cross at the centre. A recess in the north wall of the chancel contains the fine tomb of a deacon, thought to be Hugo who died in c.1240.\n\nIn 2009, as part of our 40th birthday celebration, we released a special recording of the 110-year-old bells from this church. The bells were able to ring again on 21 February, for the first time in 30 years, thanks to the restored bell tower, completed via a £700,000 restoraton project.\n\nPlease make a contribution towards the upkeep of this church via our at our red donate button. A donation can also by made by texting \"AVD\" to 70970 to donate £5 or 70191 to donate £10.\n\nThank you"
