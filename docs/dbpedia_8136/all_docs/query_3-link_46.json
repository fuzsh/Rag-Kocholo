        "text": "To serve the needs of the growing faith community in this part of Southern Nevada, composed of residents, weekend visitors and snowbirds who pray together, work together so as to build up the Body of Christ; to be witnesses, likewise, to the historical legacy of the first recorded Catholic Mass in Nevada celebrated in Laughlin in 1776 by Father Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary. We really are \"THE BIRTHPLACE AND THE HEART OF THE CATHOLIC FAITH IN NEVADA.\" And more and more, we are serving the growing spiritual needs of folks not only in Nevada, but also in Arizona and California. We are truly a tri-state parish located in the Southern tip of Nevada.\n\nThe Church encourages frequent, even daily, Holy Communion, but if at any time we cannot go to Mass in or out of this season of the coronavirus, we can still unite ourselves to the Eucharist through making a spiritual Communion.\n\nBy making an Act of Spiritual Communion, we express our faith in Christâ€™s Real Presence in the Eucharist and ask him to unite himself with us. Here is the Act of Spiritual Communion written by St. Alphonsus de Liguori:\n\nMy Jesus,\n\nI believe that You\n\nare present in the Most Holy Sacrament.\n\nI love You above all things,\n\nand I desire to receive You into my soul.\n\nSince I cannot at this moment\n\nreceive You sacramentally,\n\ncome at least spiritually into my heart.\n\nI embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You.\n\nNever permit me to be separated from You.\n\nAmen."
