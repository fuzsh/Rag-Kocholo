        "text": "THE GODMOTHER OF SOUL AIN'T SLOWING DOWN YET\n\nHaving spent over 50 years in the music business, Patti is more than just the lead singer behind the Labelle's sixties monster disco hit Lady Marmalade; the Godmother of Soul still can put her younger contemporaries in the shade!\n\nA SOUL LEGEND\n\nAt 79 years old, LaBelle demonstrates an enviable work ethic and continues to tour regularly, rather than sitting back and relaxing in her twilight years. On-screen she has enjoyed a new turn as an actress, appearing in shows such as Empire, Dancing with the Stars and American Horror Story: Freak Show.\n\nReuniting in 2008 with the rest of the LaBelle members Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash, together they Back to Now, their first full album as a group in 32 years, which featured a combination of new songs and singles recorded before the original Seventies break-up. The album was followed by a successful reunion tour."
