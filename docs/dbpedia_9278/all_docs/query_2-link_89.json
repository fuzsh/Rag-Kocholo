        "text": "Getty Images\n\nA visit from our Godmother (of soul, that is)\n\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — You had to have been living under a rock to go this long without hearing a song from Patti LaBelle. Her amazing voice has been blaring on the radios of the world for decades, and at a ripe age of 73, she's showing no signs of slowing down her strut.\n\nThat being said, she's coming to pay us a visit very soon!\n\nThat's right, in just a few short days, Ms. LaBelle will be heading to the St. George Theatre at 8 p.m. Feb. 16 to deliver the classic hits we all know and love. Tickets are $65 to $125 at the box office (718-442-2900) and Ticketmaster.com.\n\nUntil showtime, we're here to tell you why you should absolutely go and cheer on the icon:\n\n1. Every song she sings is a classic\n\nAs said above, LaBelle's work has been lauded by millions, and has transcended its original soul audience; crossing over into the popular mainstream scene very early on.\n\nShe sang the universally recognized \"Lady Marmalade\" with the Bluebelles, and after going solo went on to sing acclaimed and award-winning songs like \"You Are My Friend,\" \"If Only You Knew,\" \"New Attitude,\" \"On My Own\" — not to mention a host of classics covered other the years. It seems like she's never made a bad album, and there's at least one ultra-successful and tirelessly soulful song on every single release.\n\n2. Yes, she's a consummate diva, too\n\nNow, I was born just four months before this clip originated, so I unfortunately wouldn't be able to remember seeing it — even if I tried. But for those of you who witnessed it in real-time, I envy you.\n\nIn what can probably be called one of the strangest musical performances in history, Patti LaBelle was set to sing Donny Hathaway's \"This Christmas\" for the 1996 National Tree Lighting Ceremony.\n\nHowever, even before she started, the odds were stacked against her: From a badly done introduction, to a cue card man paying zero attention, even missing backup singers. LaBelle was having none of it, and she wasn't afraid of letting the whole country know how fed up she was.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is what's known as diehard professional VAMPING.\n\nWatch for yourself, and try not to cringe too hard. (And, btw, keep your kids under control if you happen to live in her apartment building because the Godmother WILL throw bottled water on them, trust.)\n\n3. She's an advocate for numerous causes\n\nLaBelle also is known to be a very selfless person, and has involved herself in multiple initiatives over the years.\n\nThese include everything from adoption rights to education for black college students. The video above features LaBelle taking John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to church at the Live Aid concert to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia.\n\nThis was something of a \"comeback\" performance, introducing the Godmother to a whole new (i.e. MTV) generation of fans.\n\nAfter she lost her mother to diabetes and LaBelle herself was diagnosed with it, she became a spokesperson for the American Diabetes Association.\n\nShe also was an early advocate for AIDS awareness -- long before it was a popular thing to do via little red ribbons at televised awards shows.\n\nVincent Caputo\n\n4. She's a fantastic cook\n\nAlright, I'll admit, this has nothing to do with her singing, but that doesn't excuse me from telling you all that Patti LaBelle has had a successful stint in the food business.\n\nNot only was there a moment in time in 2016 where Walmart was selling one of her sweet potato pies every second, she now has a line of \"fancy cakes,\" all of which are named after one of her hit songs. Now that's musical success you can taste!\n\nAlso, she's got her own Cooking Channel show, Patti LaBelle's Place, that you can watch some episodes of here.\n\n5. Her talk show appearances are a riot\n\nAs if being one of the best vocalists of all time AND being a master in the kitchen wasn't enough, LaBelle has been hilarious in nearly every talk show she's appeared on!\n\nTake this clip from the Tyra Show back in 2009 for example: This person between LaBelle and Tyra obviously picked the wrong woman to joke with, and she become the target of LaBelle's thermonuclear shade-throwing.\n\nOn a lighter note, just last December LaBelle appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, and it seems like the aforementioned tree lighting fiasco had slipped her mind.\n\n6. She's an experienced actress\n\nSpeaking of television, LaBelle has had her fair share of TV and film roles since her appearance in A Soldier's Story back in the 80s.\n\nLabelle has played a number of characters, including a number of cameos as herself. Some more recent roles include Dora Brown in American Horror Story and Gloria Thomas in Daytime Divas.\n\n7. She hadn't met Michael McDonald before recording \"On My Own\"\n\nWith a whopping 24 million views on YouTube, this song is undeniably popular. But for all of its apparent power and emotion, LaBelle and McDonald were not in the same recording studio singing their hearts out to each other.\n\n(They didn't need to be, 'cause The Godmother just has it like that.)\n\nWhile LaBelle recorded her half of the tune in Pennsylvania, McDonald did his in Los Angeles. The pair met for the first time on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson — after the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts.\n\n8. She's beloved by other famous artists\n\nAs the boring, average people that we are, we can only grovel at the feet of superstars on the level of Patti LaBelle, but just about every other noteworthy musician also has an unwavering respect for her.\n\nSo much so, that Mariah Carey outright asked LaBelle to be her Godmother, to which she gladly accepted! LaBelle admits that she saw something special in her, saying: \"I love that voice. You don't find many voices like that.\"\n\nLaBelle is also the Godmother of Cyndi Lauper's son Declyn, and also sang at Lauper's wedding.\n\n9. She's survived a turbulent family life.\n\nIt's terribly tragic that a person as kind and generous as Patti LaBelle has had to experience such an unnecessary amount of loss in her life.\n\nWhile mentioned before that she lost her mother to diabetes, she had lost her along with all three of her sisters to cancer and her father to emphysema in less than a decade.\n\nThe video for her song If You Asked Me To was filmed the day she buried her youngest sister Jackie Padgett, and the emotion is heartbreakingly real.\n\nBut not all of her personal life is marred with tragedy. Along with her biological son, she cares for her neighbor's two children after they lost their mother to pneumonia, and adopted her sister Jackie's two children after her death.\n\nVincent Caputo\n\n10. The conception of her name\n\nPatti LaBelle is most likely the only person you think of when you hear that last name (and I bet you're as tired of reading it as I am of typing it), but where did it come from?\n\nBorn Patricia Louise Holt-Edwards, the name LaBelle, which translates to \"the beautiful\" in French, was given to her by record executive Harold Robinson after hearing her and her first group, the Ordettes/Blue Belles, audition for a label signing and finding Patti: \"Too dark and too plain.\" He was also initially unimpressed by her."
