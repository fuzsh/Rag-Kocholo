        "text": "On Valentine’s Day, my sisters and I took my mom to see a Patti LaBelle Concert in Austin. First, let me just say it was awesome. Patti, you still got it girl! Get em!\n\nBut on top of enjoying the show, I also managed to walk away with four leadership lessons (as I tend to look for them in normal life :)).\n\nFirst Lesson. If you are doing something you love that you are great at, you can do it for a long time. Let's start with the fact that Patti is 77 years old. She even said it aloud herself in between sets. She has been singing since 1960 - so for 62 years! She was on stage for 60+ minutes, had two outfit changes, and not only sang but also danced. Her voice was full of energy, excitement, and passion. Everyone in the audience, the band, the backup singers….everyone in that building could feel her energy and fed from her enthusiasm. Although she was not directly telling us what to do, she was leading all of us into her world at her pace. As a leader, most times we are not directly telling people what to do. We are influencing their behavior and way of thinking to drive the team to the desired outcomes and goals. Our teams are mimicking our energy and pace almost like a music conductor. But it can feel more challenging to “conduct” an orchestra if some of the musicians are not playing the “right” instruments. Ensuring your team is operating in their super powers will drive innovation, keep the team engaged, and help align their passions to the desired outcomes.\n\nSecond Lesson. Even things you love to do can be hard. Clearly performing is something Patti loves to do. That was evident from watching her. But by the time she got to her second song, she shared with the audience that her hips hurt. You could tell she was uncomfortable at several moments during the concert. At some point, she took off her heels and sang barefoot. At another moment, she sat down in this beautiful green chair and sang one set. But each time she had to make an accommodation for herself, she “got back up again.” If she took off her heels for one song, she put them back on again for the next. And you best believe she got out of that chair to sing again standing! Even if we / our teams are operating in our super powers, that doesn’t mean the journey will be easy. We must continue to coach on persistence, resiliency, and tenacity because even things we love can be hard.\n\nThird Lesson. Always be your authentic self. At some point in the concert, Patti launched into what I would call “black church.” Now “black church” has many definitions in the African American community. What one imagines when they hear the phrase “black church” depends a lot on the experiences of each person. For me, black church takes me mentally directly to East Baptist Church in Pontotoc, MS. For me, it was sitting in the normal service (there was no separate church where kids went while their parents were in the main church) next to my sisters, mom, grandma, and Big Mama (great grandmother). We would sit there for hours (correct - more than 1, some days more than 2!!) listening to an amazing, soulful choir belt beautiful hymns, the Preacher preach (and sometimes shout) the word, the audience shout back at the Preacher (this was positive reinforcement for those who might have had doubts :)), the praise dancers dance, and the usual offering for the building fund (amongst other initiatives the church had prioritized). For me, the best part of black church was always the choir. Sometimes, I would sit there as a kid and wonder how in the world could they find that many people that could sing so well in a town of 6,015 inhabitants. They would sing beautiful gospel songs like Every Praise by Hezekiah Walker, You are the Living Word by Fred Hammond, and Center of My Joy by Richard Smallwood. The songs were so special and the voices so beautiful, that you could feel your spirit move inside of you without even listening to the actual sermon.\n\nWell Patti in the middle of her concert sang three of these amazing gospel songs. Many of the African American people in the concert who had similar images of black church as mine, started swaying, clapping, and praising God….just like what would happen in East Baptist back in Pontotoc. Now, in this day and age, many of us avoid touching religion to avoid offending someone or perhaps not feeling 100% comfortable to share their faith. But not Patti. She sang those songs just like the East Baptist Choir and those who were comfortable / knew the songs sang along - but naturally it wasn’t everyone. And she just kept singing. She just kept being her unapologetic, authentic self. And you know what happened….NOTHING. Once she switched back to her other hits, everyone went back to enjoying the concert. As Leaders, we have to find ways to create inclusive environments where people can be themselves in a respectful way. One’s beliefs do not have to be offensive to others. If we lead with grace and assume good intent, it will be easier to create an open environment. Innovation comes from the diversity and differences we all have to offer working toward a common goal. There is magic in bringing together a team of people who are all different.\n\nFourth Lesson. Being fierce is a choice. Now, you are not required to be fierce to lead. But, if you so choose to be, Patti teaches us that it is a choice. She started the concert in a knee length full sequin cocktail dress and ended in a beautiful, flowing, pants suit. Not only was Patti killing it in those dresses (again she is 77!) but she had her shoe collection on top of the piano (her heels that is) and would change heels throughout the performance. You could tell it was something about those shoes that made her feel like she was really performing. How we show up as leaders matters. Even if you do not actively choose to create your own style, you are creating a brand with your image everyday. I challenge you to proactively think about what you want it to be.\n\nA huge thanks to Patti LaBelle for gracing Austin with your fabulous presence !\n\nBe Bold. Be Brave. Be Confident. Be Fierce. Be YOU."
