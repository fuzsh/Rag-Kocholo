        "text": "Patti LaBelle has teased details of her upcoming album, hinting at a collaboration with one of Hip-Hop’s feature queens.\n\nThe Godmother of Soul revealed that she would be open to creating a song with Bronx rapper Cardi B on her upcoming album, slated for release later this year.\n\n“I’m still talking. I can still hear. I can see. I can walk. So, what a blessing. I’m still standing,” explained the singer to Entertainment Tonight at her surprise birthday party. “Age is a number. I’m 80 and still good.”\n\nShe continued to detail the new music in the works.\n\n“I haven’t had an album out in 20 years. So, I’m working on that now. It should be out at the end of this year and it’s called 8065,” LaBelle detailed. “I’m 80 years young, and 65 years in show business.”\n\nAnd of working with the “Bodak Yellow” rhymer, LaBelle elaborated, “Why not? She’s like one of my new best friends, and to know that she was into Patti LaBelle…She’s like my new buddy.”\n\nIf the collaboration comes to fruition, it will not be the first time the two musicians linked up creatively. Last year, Cardi B and Patti LaBelle partnered to spread holiday cheer with their respective food brands, Whip Shots Vodka and Good Life Pies.\n\nIn a clip shared on social media, the Grammy-winning rapper and the iconic soul singer combined the pumpkin flavor of the alcohol-infused whipped cream with the classic sweet potato pie.\n\n“Oh my God! It’s Patti LaBelle!” exclaimed the 31-year-old as she was greeted at the door.\n\nCardi continued to speak about her experience on Instagram, writing, “Being with Ms Patti and her family was such a honor. The way she speaks with such gentleness, calmness, and grace is soooo soothing.. I kept asking her questions just to hear her talk and one hug from her was so warm it makes you just feel welcome and like you knew her forever! So charming and so sweet but at the same time you can tell she can get real Philly on ya a** if she needs to!”\n\nTake a look at the Thanksgiving moment below."
