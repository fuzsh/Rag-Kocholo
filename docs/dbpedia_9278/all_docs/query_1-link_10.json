        "text": "Beautiful, simply does not describe the incomparable force known to the world as Patti LaBelle. Through the years, the songbird’s name has become synonymous with grace, style, and class. Her effortless ability to belt out classic rhythm and blues renditions, pop standards and spiritual sonnets has created the unique platform of versatility that the artist is known and revered for.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Patti’s resplendent voice has left an indelible mark all over the world. This Philadelphia born entertainer captured her first hit in 1962, as lead singer of The Bluebelles and went on to receive worldwide acclaim with the trailblazing and genre bending trio, Labelle. A solo artist since the 1970s, Patti has created timeless songs that have helped cement her place as a music icon and garnered her numerous honors, including GRAMMY Awards, American Music Awards, NAACP Image Awards, New York Times bestselling books and more.\n\nFrom music, to film and television, to books, to her successful food and lifestyle brand, Patti’s Good Life, living legend Patti LaBelle has shown her diversity and continued to break down barriers as an artist, entertainer, actress, author and entrepreneur."
