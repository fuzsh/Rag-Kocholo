        "text": "Singer Patti LaBelle is out with not one, but two albums this week: \"Live In Washington, D.C.,\" a previously unreleased recording of a 1982 concert, and \"The Essential Patti LaBelle.\"\n\nWhy release a concert album from 26 years ago?\n\n\"Why not?\" the double Grammy winner tells Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen. \"Why not that one and the essentials at the same time? The essentials have 30 songs that were recorded, three that were never released, the live is totally live. We did two shows that night. The doctor told me not to sing and I sang anyway. Got in trouble with the doctor but got my album done.\"\n\nAccording to LaBelle, producer Kenny Gamble brought the recording to her a year ago and suggested they release it. Gamble, along with producing and songwriting partner Leon Huff, created the legendary Philadelphia sound that came to prominence in the 1970s. LaBelle and Gamble grew up on the same street in Philly and have worked together for more than 30 years.\n\nAt 64, LaBelle is busier than ever.\n\nBesides constant touring and performing, she has a wig line called Patti LaBelle Hair and a new cooking DVD coming out in a month. She also has her own line of Patti LaBelle - Good Life hot sauce and relishes.\n\n\"One of them is called Hot Flash,\" she said. \"It is menopausal. A hot flash one, a mild one, some relish and stuff. It's in all major supermarkets.\"\n\nThis month she's back in the studio recording a reunion album with her original trio, LaBelle, with whom she had the 1975 No. 1 hit \"Lady Marmalade.\" Rocker Lenny Kravitz and Gamble are producing the album. The following month she starts on a solo album.\n\nWith all her hard work, she still finds time for her philanthropic work. A diabetic whose mother died of the disease at age 58, LaBelle serves as a spokeswoman for the National Medical Association, which administers a scholarship in her name, the National Minority AIDS Council's \"Live Long, Sugar\" campaign and the American Diabetes Association.\n\nShe also serves on the boards of the National Alzheimer Association and the National Cancer Institute."
