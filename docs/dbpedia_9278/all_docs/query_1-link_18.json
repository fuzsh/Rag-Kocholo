        "text": "This feature appears in the pages of V141 now available for purchase\n\nThe name Patti LaBelle has become synonymous with many things: the “Godmother of Soul,” a celebrated piemaker, the embodiment of warmth. And rightfully so—LaBelle has forged her way to the top, changing the landscape of American music in the process. But would you peg the soulful trailblazer as a prankster, too? Surely not. Her bandmate Nona Hendryx would say otherwise. In between sharing anecdotes of “that time in Lenny Kravitz’s kitchen” or “on tour with the Rolling Stones,” Hendryx reminisces on LaBelle’s playful side, recalling one time when LaBelle told them to get glammed up, only to pull the plug at the very end, saying they didn’t actually have an interview.\n\n“You were always doing things you thought were funny. You were the ultimate prankster,” Hendryx shares on Zoom, to which LaBelle responds with a hearty laugh. And as if the story couldn’t get more incredulous, it ends with Mick Jagger coming into the dressing room and breaking their tiff up.\n\nThis surprising quality about the two-time Grammy Award winner shows just how hard it is to pin down the singer. Despite all the monikers you may throw at LaBelle, just one fails to capture her richness. And just as LaBelle as a person is nuanced, so too is the singer. LaBelle’s voice blurs the lines between soul and gospel, having been influenced equally by both genres. Coming to prominence in the 1970s, a decade that was defined by the greatest generation of Soul singers–Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, and Gloria Gaynor, among others, LaBelle is a product of her environment. On the other hand, her gospel roots stretch back to her childhood, when her mother insisted she join the local church choir after hearing her voice. Having made a name for herself in her hometown of Philadelphia, LaBelle ultimately joined forces with fellow musicians Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash to form The Bluebelles, later known as LaBelle.\n\n“Back in the day, we were laid back, shut out, and hidden. But now, women are taking over the charts,” the musician shares. To which Hendryx nods in agreement, adding, “And part of it is a result of what we did in LaBelle. With their rebellious ensembles and frank engagement with sexuality, the group ploughed through numerous firsts–becoming the first Black group to play at New York’s Metropolitan Opera house and the first to ever be on the cover of Rolling Stone.\n\nNow, as she continues laying the foundation for the next generation of music makers, LaBelle, too, enters a new phase of her career. This month, LaBelle and her extensive discography head out on the road for what LaBelle endearingly calls a “gumbo pot of fun.” And in a career that spans more than six decades, LaBelle proves it truly only gets better with age. Along with plans to tour, the chart-topping musician is also working on an R&B album with the help of no other than Hendryx. “I want to keep putting my music out because it’s been too damn long.”\n\nTo celebrate this new chapter of her already illustrious career, Patti LaBelle reconvenes with her “day one,” Nona Hendryx, for a lively discussion about their LaBelle beginnings, current projects, and the state of music today.\n\nPATTI LABELLE: I was just thinking the other day about our beginnings [in the Bluebelles]. They were rough–and they were cute. Like that time we went from Philadelphia to California open for The Stones, remember that Nona?\n\nNONA HENDRYX: Yes, I do remember.\n\nPL: And the trouble I made before the show and how bad I was?\n\nNH: Oh, yes. I remember you used to play cards every day and took our money.\n\nPL: Every day I was playing cards. And when we got to California, I played a trick on you, Sarah [Dash], and Cindy [Birdsong]. I said we had a radio interview, and we stopped in Detroit to buy clothes. When we got there, I had nothing to do, but play a prank. I said we had to get all dressed up because we had an interview. The joke though was it was a radio interview so nobody could see you. So everybody got dressed and when it was time, I said sike.\n\nNH: We were really mad at you because you fooled us and you were always doing things you thought were funny. You were the ultimate prankster.\n\nPL: I’m excited to go back on tour again. It’s just a gumbo pot of fun for me. I’ve been away from the mic for two and a half years, so it feels great to get back out there. It feels like a brand new beginning.\n\nNH: Your voice has always inspired so many other singers. You have this spirit of connecting your voice with the lyrics in the song–and so many different types of music. It’s really wonderful for an artist to have that range and continue to be a popular, loved artist for over 60 years. That’s not something that many artists can claim.\n\nPL: Well, I’ve always said you were one of the best writers in the world. I mean, you’re so freaking smart. You know everything about music. I love you, honey.\n\nNH: Thank you. And I love you.\n\nPL: I know you do (laughs).\n\nNH: It’s truly an ongoing sisterhood.\n\nPL: The music industry now is so good for women. Back in the day we were laid back, shut out, and hidden. But now, women are taking over the charts. I don’t know how you see it Nona, but that’s how I see it.\n\nNH: And part of it is a result of what we did in LaBelle. I think in terms of being able to change how female artists were seen–creating and producing their own music. Also in terms stage performance. We broke out of the uniform–wig and dress wearing girl group–that had existed prior to LaBelle. So I think we were part of that change. Now, you have these young women who have come along and kept that ball moving forward.\n\nPL: I couldn’t agree more.\n\nPatti Labelle’s North American tour kicks off today.
