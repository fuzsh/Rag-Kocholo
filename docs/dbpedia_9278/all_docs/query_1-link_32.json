        "text": "Patti LaBelle has been giving her all through her recordings and onstage performances since 1961 when she led The Bluebelles to a million-selling hit with “I Sold My Heart To The Junkman.”\n\nSince then, the Philadelphia native has been a chart staple through a half-a-dozen hits with the futuristic trio Labelle and, later, stunning solo artist with over thirty charted singles. She’s been honored with two Grammy Awards, seven NAACP Image Awards, two American Music Awards, the Essence Triumphant Spirit Award, a Cable Ace Award, three Emmy nominations and a Soul Train Lifetime Achievement Award. Ms. LaBelle received a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, still the only one paid entirely by fans.\n\nPatti LaBelle also serves as the spokesperson for the National Minority AIDS Council’s “Live Long Sugar” campaign, and the National Cancer Institute."
