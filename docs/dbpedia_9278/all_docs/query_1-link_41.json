        "text": "Patricia Louise Holte-Edwards (born May 24, 1944), better known under the stage name, Patti LaBelle, is an American singer, author and actress. LaBelle spent sixteen years as lead singer of Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, who changed their name to Labelle in the early 1970s and released the disco song, \"Lady Marmalade\".\n\nLaBelle started her solo career shortly after the group disbanded in 1977 and crossed over to pop music with \"On My Own\", \"If Only You Knew\", \"If You Asked Me To\", \"Stir It Up\" and \"New Attitude\". She has also recorded R&B ballads such as \"You Are My Friend\" and \"Love, Need and Want You\".\n\nPatricia Louise Holte was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 24, 1944. Her father, Henry Holt, was a railroad worker and lounge singer. Her mother, Bertha Holt, was a domestic and housewife. Holt was one of four daughters (Vivian, Barbara, Patricia and Jacqueline). Holt recalls having a happy childhood but said being sexually molested at the age of seven led her to be shy and withdrawn. Holt's parents had an unhappy marriage. When Holt was twelve, her parents split up and Bertha Holt raised her daughters as a single mother. Holt's mother later adopted Claudette Grant, who would become one of Holt's closest friends."
