        "text": "These are my favorite records because I spend time with each one, doing my best to restore them to their former glory. Keeping these vintage records in rotation is why I love this stuff! (RECORD GRADING IS IN ITEM SPECIFICS)\n\nVintage Vinyl (VG and Up) - These records are sourced from estate sales, personal collection purchases, and record stores. They have been ultrasonically cleaned, play tested, placed in upgraded inner sleeves, and stored in polypropylene outer sleeves. They are guaranteed to play up to the grading standard listed, or send it back for a full refund.\n\nRead on to learn about my restoration process.\n\nEvery used record in my store is both hand and ultrasonically cleaned, play tested, and stored in upgraded rice paper inner sleeves and 4 mil polypropylene outer sleeves until they are shipped, using only the best mailers.\n\nUltrasonic Cleaning is a process that uses high-frequency sound waves to create tiny bubbles in a liquid bath. These bubbles help remove dust, dirt, oil, grease, fungus, and other contaminants from vinyl records without damaging them.\n\nIt requires zero contact with the record surface, unlike other methods that may scratch or wear out the vinyl.\n\nIt gets deep into the grooves, where many other methods cannot reach, and cleans them thoroughly.\n\nIt is fast and efficient, as it can clean multiple records at once in a short time.\n\nIt is environmentally friendly, as it uses water or mild cleaning agents that are biodegradable and safe\n\nReplacement Inner Sleeves:\n\nPaper inner sleeves cause scratches, scuffs, dust, and noise on the vinyl surface over time. Paper is abrasive and can wear away the record when you move it in and out of the sleeve, and degrades and leaves deposits on the record that get lodged in the grooves and affect the sound quality. Paper is also prone to static electricity, which can attract more dirt and dust to the record\n\nRice paper inner sleeves\n\nanti-static- they prevent the buildup of static electricity that can attract dust and dirt to the record surface and cause pops and clicks during playback.\n\nacid-free-they do not contain any chemicals that can damage the vinyl over time and cause discoloration or deterioration.\n\nrice paper layer adds extra rigidity and smoothness to the sleeve and makes it easier to insert and remove the record without scratching or scuffing it.\n\ntransparent, allowing you to see the record label and artwork without removing the sleeve.\n\n4 mil cast polypropylene outer sleeves:\n\nthicker and stronger than regular polypropylene sleeves, which means they can better resist tears, punctures, and abrasions b\n\ncrystal clear-they can display the record artwork and label without any distortion or glare, making even the oldest records look brand new.\n\nresealable flap so they can provide a tight and secure seal around the record, preventing dust, moisture, and air from entering."
