        "text": "Patti LaBelle (and her Belles in the 1960s: “I remember getting these dresses from the five and dime store — something really cheap.”\n\nPatti LaBelle Through The Years\n\nPatti Labelle, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dashas LaBelle in 1975: “You’re not going to look at a black woman unless she’s looking crazy or different…to do that we had to become these outrageous space queens and it worked.”\n\nPatti LaBelle Through The Years\n\n“This was at Live Aid in Philadelphia [in 1985] so I took my son and he was about 12 at the time. He was just looking around the room and there was Mick Jagger and Tina Turner and everybody backstage.”\n\nPatti LaBelle Through The Years\n\nPerforming “Acid Queen” with The Who in 1989: “[This dress] was very tight in the waist. Thankfully I only had one song to sing because it hurt.”\n\nPatti LaBelle Through The Years\n\nWearing Zang Toi to the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in 2003: “Don’t put on those drama stuff and it’s wrong. I try to stay in my lane and put on something that’s age appropriate and looks decent on Patti.”\n\nPatti LaBelle Through The Years\n\n“I’m very spontaneous — I’m a Gemini — I never do anything the same the second time. I’m a one time hit, then the next night it’s a different way of singing the music.”"
