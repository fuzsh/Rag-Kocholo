        "text": "She is a singer-songwriter and actress born Patricia Louis Holte in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who became a church choir member at the Beulah Baptist Church when she was ten years old.\n\nAfter winning a talent contest at high school when she was sixteen she joined up as the lead singer with three of her friends from there in 1960 and started the group the Ordettes. They became popular locally and after a couple of years changed the line-up in 1962. They went to the owner of a local record label where, after hearing Patti singing “I Sold My Heart to the Junkman”, they were signed and their name was changed to the Blue Belles to promote that song. After being sued for performing a lip-synching version on American Bandstand by The Starlets, who had originally recorded the song, the case was settled out of court and the group’s name was changed to Patti Bell and the Blue Belles.\n\nThey recorded the song “Down the Aisle” in 1963 which became their first hit which was a crossover hit on the R&B and Billboard charts. That same year they recorded their version of “You’ll Never Walk Alone” which became their second hit single in 1964 along with another chart entry “Danny Boy”.\n\nIn 1965 their record label ceased so they signed with Atlantic Records in New York and recorded twelve singles which only saw minor chart success. The label stopped working with the group in 1970. as did their manager, but after Dusty Springfield had spoken to the UK producer, Vicki Wickham, she agreed to manage them and changed their name to Labelle.

They then released Pressure Cookin’ but after little chart success they signed to Epic Records which led to the 1974 hit album Nightbirds, which went on to win an RIAA gold award. The album also contained their international chart topping song “Lady Marmalade” which topped the Billboard Hot 100, the Dutch Top 40 and the Canadian RPM singles chart.\n\nWithin a year they had featured on the front of Rolling Stone magazine and became the first rock and roll group to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House.

Further songs followed from 1978’s Tasty, 1979’s It’s Alright With Me and 1980’s Released with “Release (The Tension)” and “I Don’t Go Shopping” seeing the most success.\n\nShe changed her record label to Philadelphia International Records after 4 albums with Epic and released the album The Spirit’s In It in 1981. The following year she starred on Broadway in the musical Your Arms Too Short to Box with God and sang on Grover Washington’s “The Best Is Yet to Come” which earned her a Grammy nomination.\n\n1983 saw her releasing I’m in Love Again which gave her the R&B chart topping single “If You Only Knew” and the R&B top ten’s “Love, Need and Want You” as the first chart songs as a solo artist in 1984.
