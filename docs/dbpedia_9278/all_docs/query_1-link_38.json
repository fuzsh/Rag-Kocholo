        "text": "PATTI LABELLE\n\n2008 We Are Family Humanitarian Award Honoree\n\nBeautiful, simply does not describe the incomparable force known to the world as Patti LaBelle. As time continues to evolve, the soulful songbird's name has become synonymous with grace, style, elegance and class. Belting out classic rhythm and blues renditions, pop standards and spiritual sonnets have created the unique platform of versatility that Ms. Patti is known and revered for.\n\nIn between recording and touring, taping her TV One show, Living It Up With Patti LaBelle, acting – having recently in the Bryan Barber directed, OutKast movie Idlewild - and recently debuting her own wig line, The Patti LaBelle Collection, it's a small wonder that she has time for anything else. But, Patti makes time and the world is oh so happy that she does!\n\nIn late 2007 Patti introduced a new line of products called Patti LaBelle - The Good Life. The first items to hit shelves were five signature hot sauces and relishes. In May 2008, she will release her fifth book and third cookbook, Recipes for The Good Life, and an instructional cooking DVD. The cookbook will contain recipes and anecdotes that reflect Patti's philosophy that good cooking and entertainment comes from the heart. Other food products, dishes and cookware will be introduced later.\n\nIn addition to her amazing entertainment career, Ms. LaBelle's work as a humanitarian is just as legendary. She remains an advocate for adoption, foster care, Big Sisters and the United Negro College Fund, among many other initiatives. While Ms. LaBelle's celebrated career is respected world-wide, she has also endured and survived personal strife. Within a 10-year period, she lost her mother, three sisters and best friend to diabetes and cancer. In 1994, LaBelle was diagnosed with diabetes and shortly thereafter became a spokesperson for the American Diabetes Association.\n\nThe same motivation that had Patricia Louis Holt blossom from a choir member to lead vocalist for Patti LaBelle & The Bluebelles to a solo artist is the same energy that keeps her fire burning at six-three years young. \"Each year I grow, and that's a blessing from God. I do what I can do. I do what I feel God has given me the energy to do, so I just go out there and I do it…It's not about making money because I don't need money, but I need to sing. With a voice or without, I've got to get on that stage.\" And the world is thankful that Ms. Patti's voice sounds so good to our ears."
