        "text": "Patti LaBelle had to overcome a bit of a snafu during her tribute performance to the late Tina Turner at Sunday’s BET Awards.\n\nThe legendary singer performed Turner’s 1989 hit “(Simply) the Best,” but appeared to struggle with some of the lyrics.\n\n“I can’t see the words and I don’t know,” LaBelle sang to the crowd. “I’m trying y’all.”\n\nThe audience in the theater clapped and joined LaBelle and her background singers for the chorus to sing, “You’re simply the best!”\n\nSome viewers criticized LaBelle’s flub, while others defended the 79-year-old singer.\n\n“Only Patti LaBelle can sound that good and not only not the words but sing that she doesn’t know the words,” one viewer tweeted.\n\nActress and producer Holly Robinson Peete retweeted video of an audience member who said her section was blocking a teleprompter, which made it difficult for LaBelle to see the lyrics.\n\nRobinson Peete tweeted, “This Patti slander is wrong.”\n\nA spokesperson for BET confirmed LaBelle’s view was obstructed in a statement to CNN.\n\n“It was an extraordinary privilege to celebrate the life and legacy of Ms. Tina Turner at “BET Awards” 2023,” the statement read. “Having the incomparable Ms. Patti LaBelle on our stage honoring one of her contemporaries was an equal privilege. Due to the crowd’s enthusiasm, the teleprompter was obstructed, obscuring Ms. LaBelle’s view of the lyrics. Nonetheless, we couldn’t be more grateful to Ms. LaBelle for lending her incredible talent to this moment.”\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for LaBelle for comment.\n\nLaBelle finished strong, saying at the end of her performance, “God bless you, Tina Turner!”"
