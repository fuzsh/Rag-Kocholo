        "text": "Patti LaBelle; Grammy Award winning artist, actress, and chef and renowned as The Godmother of Soul. You know her name. You may not know how deep and rich her influence goes, but you will. The Picture Perfect team recently held the honor of working with the ICONIC Patti LaBelle in Philadelphia, her hometown. We aren’t yet ready to discuss our project, but our experience with her left us feeling inspired and moved by her contributions to American Music and culture. Some of our younger team members, familiar with her name, found themselves interested in seeing how her musical career influenced the past half century of music, culture, and Civil Rights.\n\nYou may not realize that some of her original songs have gone on to be sung again and again by different artists over the years. Hits like Moon Shadow and Lady Marmalade (Which was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame) have been re-sung so many times over the years, but we have Patti to thank for their origins.\n\nWhen you are scrolling through some of your favorite artists, you may find that they were influenced by LaBelle and even sampling some of her sound for their own hits. Artists like Nelly, Kanye, John Legend, Outkast, Mary J Blige have created music around her voice or in collaboration with the legend herself. So next time you hear “Home” by Kanye West, listen for the sweet sound of Miss Patti LaBelle’s influence on today’s music.\n\nShe isn't finished touching history though, today LaBelle is still active in programs like The Voice and The Masked Singer. She even recently had a street named after her in her hometown of Philadelphia, but that’s just the “Patti LaBelle Way”.\n\nMoved and honored by the experience, the Picture Perfect team wishes to extend a heartfelt thank you to Miss Patti LaBelle. It was a pleasure to share your company and cook up this special project we know is dear to your heart."
