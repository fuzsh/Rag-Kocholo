        "text": "Patti LaBelle turned 80 years old last week (May 24) and her close friend Whoopi Goldberg threw the music icon a surprise party attended by the likes of Gayle King, Fat Joe, Tamron Hall and more.\n\nEntertainment Tonight caught up with LaBelle at the party, where she revealed plans for her next album and a possible collaboration on the horizon with Cardi B.\n\nThe “On My Own” singer hailed the Bronx bombshell as her “new best friend” and said she loves the idea of working with the Grammy-winning rapper. “Why not,” she said of teaming up with Cardi B. “[Cardi’s] like one of my new best friends. And to know that she was into Patti LaBelle, she’s like my new buddy.”\n\nPatti LaBelle added that her upcoming album should arrive in 2024, and the title is inspired by her age combined with the amount of time she’s spent working in the music industry.\n\n“It should be out at the end of this year, and it’s called 8065,” she said. “I’m 80 years young and 65 years in show business.”\n\nIf they do hit the studio, it won’t be the first time Cardi and LaBelle linked up. The pair joined forces last Thanksgiving to combine their products for a delectable holiday side dish. Cardi B brought her pumpkin-flavored Whip Shots Vodka to Patti’s house to mix with her Good Life Pies for a sweet snack.\n\n“Being with Ms Patti and her family was such a honor,” Cardi said of the experience with LaBelle on Instagram. “The way she speaks with such gentleness, calmness, and grace is soooo soothing.. I kept asking her questions just to hear her talk and one hug from her was so warm it makes you just feel welcome and like you knew her forever!”\n\nShe continued: “So charming and so sweet but at the same time you can tell she can get real Philly on ya ass if she needs to! Thank you so much @mspattilabelle you are everything and I’m coming over for dinner every chance I get!!!\n\nWhile Cardi’s sophomore album is still in limbo, she remains in-demand when it comes to her features. She’s dropping another guest verse as part of the “Wanna Be” remix with Megan Thee Stallion and GloRilla on Friday (May 31).\n\nAs for Patti LaBelle, her last project to make the Billboard 200 came in 2007 with her holiday-themed Miss Patti’s Christmas, which reached No. 174.\n\nWatch Patti LaBelle talk about Cardi B and her new album below."
