        "text": "Danish Commitment to the 1990 Gulf War\n\nWithin a few days of Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent trade embargo sanctioned by the United Nations (UN) in August 1990, several NATO members began to prepare for a naval blockade in the gulf under the leadership of the United States. In the midst of a fierce debate among Danish political parties about the necessity of a UN mandate to join the operation, the blockade was sanctioned by the UN by the end of August 1990. The Danish government, seeing this as an opportunity to rebuild its reputation in NATO and particularly to mend the strained relations with the United States, decided to send the corvette-type ship Olfert Fischer to the gulf on September 12, 1990. The ship remained in the region after the war broke out in January 1991, but it did not actively participate in armed confrontation.248 I argue that Denmark’s decision to participate in the naval blockade against Iraq in 1990 was possible only because the footnote policy era that stymied the government’s relations with NATO ended in 1988. It is therefore necessary to go back to the 1980s and understand the politics of the footnote era to explain Denmark’s gulf commitment in 1990.\n\nThe footnote policy era is a fascinating “case study of minority Page 100 →parliamentarism”249 and marks the end of the “Atlantic Consensus” that had shaped Denmark’s foreign policy for nearly three decades until the early 1980s. The footnote era effectively began in 1982, when the Social Democratic Party joined the opposition ranks and was replaced by a minority coalition comprising the Conservatives and the Liberals alongside two other right-wing parties, the Center Party and the Christian People’s Party.250 Led by Prime Minister Poul Schlüter, this coalition occupied a total of 66 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, the Danish parliament, while the remaining seats belonged to the parties on the left, including the Social Democrats, Social Liberals, Socialist People’s Party, and the Left Socialists. This government survived the 1984 elections251 and continued its term until the elections in 1988.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1988, the Social Democrats spearheaded a fierce left-wing parliamentary opposition against the government. Known as the “alternative majority,” this group could dominate the government’s NATO policy through legislative motions.252 “Footnoting” was their key practice; the opposition parties forced the government repeatedly throughout this period to add footnotes to the bilateral communiqués to convey their dissent against NATO policies, particularly regarding nuclear issues.253 Doeser notes that during this six-year period, the alternative majority approved twenty-three parliamentary motions that contradicted the government’s NATO policy.254 These footnotes not only caused the government to decrease its political role and commitments in NATO, but they also invited backlash from the alliance and in particular disturbed the United States.255\n\nThe footnote policy era provides an excellent setting for assessing the policy viability explanation. It illustrates how an ideologically unified parliamentary opposition can obstruct the minority coalition’s foreign policy behavior. The minority status of Schlüter’s governing coalition in the parliament put it at a mathematical disadvantage and limited the cabinet’s ability to build a stronger relationship with NATO. Figure 4.1 below illustratesPage 101 → the distribution of parties in the Danish parliament by 1982, with the parties’ left-right positions reported in parentheses. (The governing parties are displayed in black and the opposition parties are in gray.) The government’s and the opposition’s respective seat shares are also reported in parentheses.256 As the figure shows, the ideological composition of the government as a pure right-wing coalition resulted in a similarly homogeneous opposition. The Social Liberals, which were actually supportive of the government’s domestic policy, aligned firmly with the leftist alternative majority in the foreign policy domain, further consolidating the “alternative majority.”257\n\nThe ideological composition of the minority coalition in Denmark therefore created a parliamentary opposition whose seats were not controlled by parties from different ideological backgrounds, as figure 4.1 shows. Instead, all the opposition parties from 1982 until 1988 belonged to the left of the political spectrum and were NATO-skeptic.258 The ideological composition of the government resulted in an absence of policy viability and allowed opposition parties to easily come together and develop an even stronger response to the government’s foreign policy toward NATO.\n\nBy 1988, the Conservative-Liberal coalition that had been in power since 1982 was becoming increasingly frustrated with the “alternative Page 102 →majority” and its ability to block foreign policy and impede the government’s willingness to commit, especially within the NATO framework. Indeed, the government was forced to call elections in 1988 precisely because the “alternative majority’s” foreign policy obstruction jeopardized the country’s future in the alliance. The parliamentary opposition was now forcing the government to explicitly ask NATO vessels to declare whether they carried nuclear weapons on board, which was not just against alliance decorum but also a clear signaling of distrust to Denmark’s transatlantic partners.259\n\nThe elections were held in May 1988 and resulted in a three-party minority government including the Conservatives, the Liberals, and, most importantly, the Social Liberals. After cooperating with the “alternative majority” for six years, the Social Liberals left the opposition and joined the two right-wing parties to form the next coalition. Figure 4.2 below illustrates the ideological distribution of the parties in the parliament following the 1988 elections, where the governing parties are displayed in black and the opposition parties are in gray.\n\nThe new minority coalition between the center-left Social Liberals and the right-wing Liberals and Conservatives is crucial to explaining the end of the footnote policy era and the subsequent decision to send the naval corvette to the gulf; Prime Minister Poul Schlüter explained that “the only possibility for the Conservatives and the Liberals to break up the parliamentary opposition and to put an end to the footnote policy was to create a three-party government with the Social Liberals.”260\n\nThe statement of the Conservative leader lends strong support for the policy viability hypothesis in explaining the government’s 1990 commitment in the gulf: In order to weaken the capacity of the majority opposition that continuously opposed the government’s foreign policy agenda throughout the 1980s, the ruling parties knew that they had to reach across the center of the political spectrum and cooperate with at least one of the opposition parties. Comparative politics scholars have also highlighted the ideological composition of this government and argued that the Conservatives and the Liberals were finally able to dismantle the alternative majority, particularly in the foreign policy realm.261\n\nThe footnote policy era thus came to an end in 1988. The Conservatives and the Liberals acted strategically as they formed the coalition with Page 103 →a leftist party that was closest to their respective ideological positions along the left-right political spectrum, as figure 4.2 shows. The Social Liberals were sympathetic to the coalition, as their position on the footnote policy had also evolved over time. The Social Liberal Party’s spokesperson said in 1988 that “the previous years’ politicization of foreign policy had not been beneficial . . . the improved superpower relations had created new opportunities for Denmark to act in the global arena,”262 implying that the Social Liberals’ were moving toward the Conservative-Liberal line.\n\nNow that the alternative majority was defeated by the incoming minority coalition, Denmark’s relations with NATO and the United States began to improve and take an activist turn. The coalition parties agreed that Danish activism in foreign policy was necessary. Still, it was still not an easy decision for the Social Liberals to accept the Conservative-Liberal proposal to join the gulf blockade in 1990. Although the right-wing members of the government argued for “the need to support the UN and the need to support the US in its conflict with Iraq,”263 the Social Liberals were at best lukewarm toward the idea, emphasizing that the party would support the blockade only if it was sanctioned by the United Nations.264 Luckily, the UN’s blessing came through shortly thereafter and the coalition put its proposal to participate in the blockade in August 1990. Although the Social Liberal leader remained skeptical of Denmark’s participation despite the UN mandate, the party did not go against the government line.265 They chose to vote for the proposal in the parliament because they were in the government and did not want to cause a coalition crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, in the opposition ranks, the Social Democrats were fiercely Page 104 →against participating in the blockade until the operation received the UN’s mandate.266 Once the UN sanctioned the naval blockade, however, the Social Democrats cooperated with the Social Liberals in the government and “emphasized the UN aspects of the operation” to convince the other opposition parties to vote for the government’s proposal.267 In other words, having the Social Liberal Party in the coalition helped the government to further penetrate the parliamentary opposition. The Social Democrats, in particular, found an ideologically familiar voice in the government with whom they could work in the run-up to the parliamentary vote. The UN mandate certainly came at the right time to facilitate this broad-based cooperation in the parliament. Still, the ability of the Conservative-Liberal front to ideologically fragment the opposition by adding the Social Liberals to its ranks was crucial to overcoming the political and structural barriers in the parliament that perpetuated the footnote policy era throughout the 1980s. The government’s ability to break the “alternative majority” gave it policy viability and allowed for a smoother dialogue between the government and the opposition, enabling Denmark to contribute to the naval blockade.\n\nPublic Opinion: To what extent was Danish public opinion influential in the government’s decision to participate in the gulf operation? By the end of the 1980s, the public had increasingly grown weary of footnote politics. One poll showed that those who strongly disagreed with the statement “We should leave NATO as soon as possible” had jumped from 54 percent in 1987 to 70 percent in 1988.268 Half of the respondents who were affiliated with left-wing and historically NATO-skeptic parties also disagreed with the statement, indicating that the opposition bloc had lost steam even among its own constituency.269 Most notably, 62 percent of Social Liberal voters were supportive of Denmark’s NATO membership by 1988, which “was the highest value ever recorded” for the party’s constituency in this issue area.270 This increase in support for continued Danish membership in NATO likely gave the Social Liberals the public vote of confidence to leave the “alternative majority” and consequently support the naval blockade in the gulf as part of the governing coalition, which was initiated by the United States and with other NATO members’ backing even before the UN mandate.\n\nPage 105 →The public’s support was not stable over time, however, as the 1990 election showed. Although the election was scheduled for 1992, it was held early following a parliamentary deadlock with the opposition Social Democrats over budget talks, resulting in the defeat of the governing Social Liberal Party.271 Evidence suggests that the Social Liberals’ loss was indicative of the declining public support for Danish presence in the gulf among left-wing voters. In a national poll conducted in the wake of the election, only 2.9 percent of the respondents reported that they had voted for the Social Liberal Party, although 72.4 percent of them agreed with the statement “Denmark should, as far as possible, make its views known and seek to influence development.” In stark contrast, 31.2 percent of the poll’s respondents reported that they had voted for the opposition Social Democratic Party in the 1990 election. Of those, 63.7 percent agreed with an alternative statement “Denmark should, as far as possible, refrain from interfering in such conflicts that do not directly affect us.”272 Among left-wing voters, the tide was thus turning against the Social Liberals and their position on the Persian Gulf operation.\n\nFollowing the election, the Social Liberals—who had voted for Denmark’s participation in the Persian Gulf as recently as three months prior—left the government and joined the parliamentary opposition, which began forcing the re-elected Conservative-Liberal minority coalition to withdraw the ship if war broke out.273 The leftist alternative majority opposition was therefore reunited by the end of 1990, when the right-wing government lost its only left-wing partner. The incoming Conservative-Liberal coalition occupied fifty-nine seats, whereas the leftist majority opposition had ninety-one seats in the new parliament.274 The ideological realignment of the opposition once again constrained the government, echoing the politics of the footnote era. The left-wing majority opposition limited the incoming Conservative-Liberal minority coalition’s room for maneuver in the military operation, which resulted in the decision to keep the Olfert Fischer in the Persian Gulf but out of the war zone.\n\nPage 106 →The preceding discussion suggests that public opinion did not have an independent effect on the September 1990 decision to send the naval ship, nor did it single-handedly shape the Conservative-Liberal minority coalition’s decision after the December 1990 election to keep it in the gulf but out of the war zone. Rather, the role of public opinion was observed most clearly in the context of the Social Liberal Party’s behavior before and after the December 1990 elections, embedded in the context of the impending fight in the gulf. Increased public support for NATO and the Social Liberals’ defection from the “alternative majority” went hand in hand with explaining the party’s vote for the September 1990 decision to participate in the naval blockade. Similarly, the party’s electoral loss in December 1990 resulted in its decision to leave the coalition and oppose further commitment in the gulf in the event that fighting broke out in Iraq. The government’s decision to maintain a limited Danish presence in Iraq was fundamentally shaped by the left-wing alternative majority that reunited when the Social Liberals defected from the government and joined the parliamentary opposition after December 1990.\n\nThreat to National Survival: Did Denmark approach the Persian Gulf operation as a response to a threat to survival that outweighed the effects of coalition governance on foreign policy? The short answer is no. Olesen contends that following the fall of the Soviet Union, Denmark visibly enjoyed a far more secure period in the early post–Cold War years.275 The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was thus not an existential threat to Denmark that could have motivated the country’s response and sidelined the effects of coalition politics. Nevertheless, the smaller extremist parties in the Folketing brought up terrorism as a threat, assessing the significance of the gulf operation in this context. A former leader of the far-right Progress Party at the time stated that “there is no doubt that terrorism is and remains enemy number 1 [sic] for the Progress Party and . . . we will do anything to prevent such terrorism from approaching NATO’s southern flank.”276 This rhetoric was not picked up by the government, however, during its deliberations to participate in the blockade.\n\nPolitical Leadership: As I argued in chapter 2, leaders are critical in the study of foreign policy, as their personal motivations, professional experience, or interest in the issue might drive them to challenge the institutional constraints of their domestic environment to pursue their foreign policy goals. Without a doubt, Danish foreign minister (later appointed as the Page 107 →leader of the Liberal Party) Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was a central actor in the country’s foreign policy apparatus in the wake of the footnote policy era and until the Conservative-Liberal government was voted out of office in 1993. How influential was Ellemann-Jensen in shaping Denmark’s commitment in the Persian Gulf?\n\nScholars of Danish foreign policy characterize Uffe Ellemann-Jensen as the foremost supporter of Denmark’s foreign policy activism during the early post–Cold War years.277 Indeed, it was Ellemann-Jensen himself who coined the term “active internationalism,” which experts still use to describe post-Cold War Danish foreign policy.278 Several accounts suggest that Ellemann-Jensen made it his personal objective not only to end the footnote policy period and demonstrate Danish commitment in the gulf, but also to transform Denmark’s foreign policy identity away from its social democratic, cosmopolitan roots into an active international actor that could easily be placed on the map in the post–Cold War international security environment.279\n\nWith Prime Minister Schlüter choosing to focus his attention on domestic political matters, Ellemann-Jensen was effectively the foreign policy tsar during the 1980s and the early 1990s.280 To what extent Ellemann-Jensen was a game changer in the run-up to the decision to participate in the Gulf War, however, is open to debate. On the one hand, he was courageous enough to announce without receiving any formal support from his government that Denmark would send a naval corvette to the gulf to assist in the blockade. He therefore publicly committed his government, bypassing both his prime minister and the Social Liberals, who were left “infuriated.”281 In this sense, Ellemann-Jensen certainly seized the opportunity to shape the government’s foreign policy in his own image.\n\nOn the other hand, the foreign minister had to compromise when the Social Liberals in the government and the Social Democrats in the opposition put significant constraints on his ability to maneuver.282 Even though he wanted the government to make more intense commitments beyond merely sending the Olfert Fischer and thereby strengthen Denmark’s relations with the United States and with NATO, he eventually backed down. Page 108 →He had to first wait for the UN mandate as emphasized by the Social Liberals in the government (and the Social Democrats in the opposition), and then seek support across both the coalition and opposition parties for the government’s proposal to join the blockade. In sum, despite Ellemann-Jensen’s strong personality and interest in changing Denmark’s international profile into an active citizen of the international community, his efforts in pushing Denmark to participate in the gulf operation were only as decisive as allowed by the Social Liberals and Social Democrats in the policymaking process, precisely due to the structural vulnerability of his government in the parliament.\n\nBy dispatching the Olfert Fischer to the Persian Gulf, Denmark made a significant commitment to the operation effort and deployed material capabilities beyond its borders “for the first time in modern history.”283 My analysis concludes that the ideological composition of the minority coalition and its relationship with the parliamentary opposition was central to explaining Denmark’s decision to both participate in the gulf blockade in September 1990 and to maintain a limited presence in the region afterwards. It was the partisan realignment in the parliament on foreign policy matters that shed light on the transformation of Denmark’s international behavior in the wake of the Cold War. The decision to send the naval ship was fundamentally facilitated by the Conservative-Liberal coalition’s ability to fragment the “alternative majority” in the parliament in 1988, include the Social Liberals in its ranks, and bring an end to the footnote policy era. The timing of the UN mandate certainly helped the government commit to the operation. The UN decision was instrumental, though, precisely because it smoothed over the partisan disparities both inside the government and between the government and the opposition; it alleviated the concerns of the Social Liberals, who were then able to reach out to the Social Democrats in the opposition for support.\n\nIn the same vein, the Conservative-Liberal coalition’s room to maneuver in the gulf was constrained as soon as the Social Liberals left the government in December 1990 and joined the leftist majority opposition in the parliament, which further supports the policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations raised in chapter 2. While the assertive political leadership of Ellemann-Jensen was visible throughout this period and specifically in the decision to participate in the naval blockade, Denmark’s commitment to it was made possible primarily by the participation of the Social Liberals in the right-oriented Conservative-Liberal coalition.\n\n‘Offensive’ Danish Foreign Policy and the 2003 Iraq War\n\nOnly the Americans have the military strength to disarm Saddam and liberate Iraq. But we have an obligation to help. We cannot just sail under a flag of convenience and let others fight for freedom and peace. There has in fact been too much of that kind in the past in Denmark. If we mean anything seriously about our democratic values, then we should also be ready to make a small contribution to the international coalition.\n\n—Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, March 26, 2003284\n\nThis chapter started with the assertion that Danish foreign policy in the post–Cold War era was marked by two major turning points. One of these was the decision to join the naval blockade in the Persian Gulf in 1990. Now that the footnote politics era was over, the gulf commitment decisively demonstrated the country’s new “activist” vision in the international arena.\n\nThe second major shift in Danish foreign policy came with the country’s 2003 decision to join the US-led war in Iraq, during which Denmark’s foreign policy activism took a “super-Atlanticist”—and, according to some, “offensive”—turn.285 Unlike the 1990 episode, however, the 2003 decision was made by a right-wing minority coalition that did not need to seek ideological fragmentation in the parliamentary opposition. Instead, the government logrolled with a right-wing opposition party to pass the war bill, eliminating the need to cooperate with left-wing parties in the parliament.\n\nOn March 18, 2003, the government, represented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Per Stig Møller proposed to the Folketing the commitment of “a submarine, a corvette, a team of doctors as well as a small contribution of staff and liaison personnel” to the Iraq war coalition.286 This proposal was accepted on March 21 by the parties in government, namely the Liberals and the Conservatives, as well as the right-wing Danish People’s Party in the opposition, while the leftist opposition partiesPage 110 → collectively voted against it. The war bill ultimately passed with “a slim majority of 11 votes.”287\n\nThe government that asked the Folketing for its support for Danish participation in the 2003 Iraq war came to power in November 2001 by defeating the Social Democratic minority government led by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who had occupied this post since 1993. The incoming minority coalition was led by the Liberal Party’s new leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who took over from Ellemann-Jensen in 1998, and it included the Conservative Party as its partner. The 2001 election was a historical victory for the Danish right; the Liberals won 56 seats in the 179-seat parliament, the Conservatives won 16, and the Danish People’s Party (DPP) won 22 seats. With outside support from the DPP, the Liberal-Conservative minority coalition could enjoy a pure right-wing majority in the parliament. In Pedersen’s words, “for the first time in 70 years, it was possible to find a majority for foreign policy that did not have to include the Social Liberals and the Social Democrats.”288\n\nEllemann-Jensen’s “activist” vision continued to define the Liberal Party’s foreign policy position under Anders Fogh Rasmussen’s leadership. For one, the party lambasted the politics of the footnote era in the strongest possible terms. The party’s foreign policy program in 2003 emphasized that the footnote era stood “as a monument of shame of Denmark’s passive and ambiguous attitude to the Soviet threat.”289 Anders Fogh Rasmussen was particularly adamant about confronting the anti-Atlanticist tone of the Social Liberal–Social Democratic bloc, using words like “betrayal” and “treason” to describe their foreign policy position during the Cold War.290 The Liberal Party’s foreign policy position in the 2000s was therefore both ideologically confrontational at home but also authoritatively more activist abroad and visibly sympathetic toward the transatlantic alliance and the United States in particular.\n\nThe Conservatives followed the Liberals in lockstep. Having governed together between 1982 and 1993, the two parties’ foreign policy visions were already convergent, championing a “more militant and more West-oriented foreign policy” compared to the leftist opposition in the parliament. Although Foreign Minister Per Stig Møller of the Conservative Party “argued in accordance with the traditional Danish foreign policy Page 111 →priorities when he stressed institutional rather than military activism,”291 in the run-up to the 2003 decision, the Conservatives did not stray from their Liberal counterparts and voted for the war bill in March 2003. In sum, the Anders Fogh Rasmussen coalition “made activism the emblem of its foreign policy and equated activism with a close alliance with the United States.”292 The 2003 decision was a dramatic demonstration of this vision.\n\nThe parliamentary opposition’s position on Iraq was not as homogeneous as that of the government. On the right side of the political spectrum, the DPP leader Pia Kjærsgaard argued just two days prior to the parliamentary vote that “I and the Danish People’s Party feel clearly that it is much better to put our weight behind the US in connection with this mission, than France or Germany [who had opposed the war.]”293 Kjærsgaard’s statement was in response to the Social Liberal–Social Democratic position; echoing the 1990 episode, the leftist parties of the opposition emphasized the need first for a UN mandate for the intervention and also argued for a multilateral operation as opposed to a primarily US-led effort.294 Indeed, “when the Prime Minister . . . chooses to join Washington’s dictates . . . rather than the possibility of a dialogue through a joint response from Brussels, the term ‘activism’ becomes a false mark,” said Mogens Lykketoft, the Social Democrats’ new leader, criticizing the government’s pro-United States position.295 The Social Democratic and Social Liberal parties instead “focused primarily on Denmark being a good international citizen and preserving international unity,” which would be best illustrated by the country’s insistence on a UN mandate for the operation.296\n\nThe parliament was therefore divided along ideological lines on the question of Danish participation in the war. The right-wing parties of the government and the DPP in the opposition supported joining the war coalition alongside the United States, whereas the left-wing parties, particularly the Social Liberals and the Social Democrats—the usual suspects—were against it. The Liberal-Conservative-DPP bloc’s historic win in the 2001 elections resulted in a right-wing parliamentary majority that effectively diminished the leftist opposition’s ability to form an “alternative opposition” the way it did during the footnote era. In this sense, Page 112 →however, one could argue that the minority coalition achieved “majority status in disguise.”297\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Danish governments need parliamentary support to participate in overseas military operations. Although the coalition parties were in agreement regarding Denmark’s participation in the Iraq war, their minority status in the parliament remained a structural impediment. This is where the opposition Danish People’s Party came into play. Even though Anders Fogh Rasmussen’s minority coalition did not fragment the leftist opposition the way the Schlüter government did in the aftermath of the 1988 elections, it was still successful at garnering enough votes in the parliament without the need to cooperate with the leftist opposition parties, all thanks to its logrolling relationship with the Danish People’s Party (DPP). Broadly speaking, logrolling entails “voting alliances” in the parliament and often involves the exchange of support across parties for each other’s policies.298 In the context of the 2003 Iraq war decision, the government’s structural vulnerability in a parliament that had actually facilitated the formation of a right-wing majority created an opportunity for the Liberals, Conservatives, and the DPP to work with each other.\n\nLogrolling took place precisely at this juncture. Although the three parties ultimately voted together on March 21, it took them some time to converge their policy positions. The Liberals had already been on board with the Bush administration’s justification for the war, which emphasized liberal values, democracy promotion, and human rights concerns.299 The DPP’s platform, however, did not align with these principles. In effect, the DPP’s support for the war “required some justification since the underlying principles were at odds with the traditional party line.”300 The coalition, under the leadership of the Liberal Party, thus consciously and gradually moved closer to the DPP line to secure the party’s support in the parliament for the March 2003 war bill.\n\nThis movement occurred in two distinct ways. The first entailed a classic clipping together of policies and began to take place months before the March vote. Since the coalition needed the DPP’s parliamentary support not just for foreign but also domestic policy, the latter used this vulnerability to its advantage by asking for side payments such as getting policy concessions on immigration and refugee laws, which were central pillars of Page 113 →the DPP platform.301 In the run-up to the 2002 and 2003 budget decisions, the coalition agreed to cooperate with the DPP and passed more stringent legislation on immigration and refugees as well as taking additional measures to decrease public expenditure and taxes in exchange for the DPP’s support.302 Indeed, as early as in 2002, the DPP leader declared, “The Danish People’s Party now runs all-round politics. We cannot be brushed aside as a single-issue party; we are now a government leading party, which is helping to secure the welfare state and is not afraid to carry out the necessary reforms of the Danish society ( . . . ) the Danish People’s Party has placed itself at the centre [sic] of Danish politics.”303\n\nSecond, the Liberal Party moved ideologically closer to the DPP’s policy platform by altering the content of what is known as the “cultural war” in Danish politics.304 This was crystallized in the run-up to the 2003 parliamentary vote and helped couch the justification for Denmark’s participation in the war in terms that were more sympathetic to the DPP. Originally, the “cultural war” debate was introduced by the Liberals to ostracize the politics of the Social Democrats and Social Liberals. In the context of foreign policy, for instance, the “cultural war” meant upending these parties’ understanding of Denmark as a “small state” and its noncommitment to the Atlantic alliance, such that participation in the Iraq war alongside the United States would be a gesture of solidarity with the Atlantic partners.305 Soon, however, the “cultural war” began to dovetail with the DPP platform and to emphasize “restrictive immigration policy and legal practice (tough on crime) and a showdown with state-financed expert committees and the political correctness of the political elite.”306 Other experts called this overture the “values policy.”307\n\nIn other words, the “cultural war” debate, which was originally directed against the Social Democrats and Social Liberals, was now being tailored intentionally to converge with the DPP’s policy platform to close the ideational gap between the DPP and the Liberal-Conservative coalition. In so doing, the DPP was also brought closer to the notion that Denmark’s participationPage 114 → in the Iraq war was part and parcel of this “cultural war” against the Social Democrats and Social Liberals.308\n\nIn sum, these two trajectories culminated in a much broader and more routinized pattern of legislative cooperation between the DPP and the Liberal-Conservative coalition, which completed the overarching context of logrolling for the March 2003 decision. This relationship between the coalition and the DPP over Denmark’s Iraq policy continued after the March 2003 vote. Kaarbo and Cantir explain that “the Danish People’s Party did indeed trade its votes for later deployment of peacekeepers in Iraq for concessions on asylum policies” as soon as May 2003, once the initial armed confrontation in Iraq was over.309 Referring to the right’s electoral victory, a DPP member said at the time that “the change in 2001 [was] not just a change in government, but a change of systems,”310 suggesting the consolidation of a right-wing Liberal-Conservative-DPP bloc even though the latter chose to remain outside the government. International observers grew increasingly cautious of this relationship, fearing that it was polarizing the Danish political system.311\n\nPublic Opinion: Was the Danish public influential in the government’s decision to join the war in Iraq alongside the United States? Jakobsen argues that traditionally, “the public at large favors Danish military participation in international operations.”312 As for the 2003 Iraq operation, however, the polls and the analysts’ observations suggest that while a notable proportion of the public did not favor the government’s proposal, this opposition was still not overwhelming enough to sway the government. A Gallup poll conducted three months prior to the March 2003 decision showed that a little more than 40 percent of respondents did not approve of Denmark’s participation in the war at all, whereas about 45 percent supported it either “in the form of a UN operation” or as “carried out by the US and its allies.”313 Another EOS-Gallup poll conducted in January 2003 asked whether respondents would support “Danish participation in a military intervention without UN mandate.” In that poll, 83 percent said such an intervention would be “unjustified.”314\n\nThe Danes’ opinions of the war thus varied dramatically in the run-up to the March vote, especially when a UN mandate was proposed as a Page 115 →condition for participation. Their support for the parties that voted for the war bill in March 2003, however, remained stagnant. The combined public support for the Liberal-Conservative coalition and the DPP stayed within the 50–51 percent range between the November 2001 elections and February 2003.315 In fact, the combined public support for the Liberals, Conservatives, and the DPP was as high as 51.5 percent one month after the war decision, which was only 0.8 percentage points lower than the share of votes these parties had collectively received in the November 2001 elections.316 Even though the parliament was deeply divided over the Iraq proposal and the polls showed some opposition to Denmark’s participation in the operation (particularly when the questions proposed the UN mandate as a condition), this public debate was not enough to sap the three parties’ electoral support over time or sway the government’s initial position to contribute to the war in Iraq.\n\nThreat to National Survival: To what extent was the 2003 episode framed around a “threat to national survival,” outweighing the effects of minority coalition governance on Denmark’s decision to commit to the Iraq war? The evidence points to the conclusion that although the notion of “threat” was utilized more clearly by the parties on the right than those on the left, when it was raised and what it entailed varied from one party to the next. As a result, its role in explaining the commitment decision was little to none.\n\nFor the Liberal-Conservative government, the 2003 war represented the US-led global community’s response to address new security threats like international terrorism, weak states, and weapons of mass destruction that emerged in the post–Cold War era, which could potentially challenge Denmark’s national security. In an opinion piece published in September 2003—nearly six months after the bill was passed in the parliament—Frank Laybourn, the Liberal Party’s foreign and security policy advisor, made this point clear. He stated that “international terrorism is a threat to our peace and security, and can strike any country and any population group—including Denmark and the Danes.”317 This, however, was not the government’s only, or even its primary, argument. Rather, it was one of the reasons it used to justify joining the war, along with the Iraqi regime’s human rights record and, importantly, the “duty” to stand by the United States, which “has come to our help on numerous occasions.”318\n\nThe notion of a “threat” was also used by the Danish People’s Party, Page 116 →but in different terms and long before the debate began over the country’s participation in the Iraq war. Most notably, the threat for the DPP was primarily domestic and ideational, and its real expression was September 11. Although the party argued in October 2001 that 9/11 would shape the party’s defense policy in the future, the attack resonated much more strongly with its anti-immigrant platform.319 The DPP leader Pia Kjærsgaard commented at the time that the threat was “everywhere in our midst.” Pointing out that “some” of the perpetrators of 9/11 “[were] described as ideal immigrants. But each one turned out to be a demon on commissioned work,”320 the party was signaling in obvious terms that it interpreted the “threat” in terms of Denmark’s own Muslim immigrant community rather than a remote Middle Eastern dictatorship.\n\nThe parties on the left, especially the Social Democrats, were the most ambiguous about their use of the language of a “threat.” Then Social Democratic leader and former prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen stressed in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks that it was necessary to see that “it is a different world we now live in,”321 referring to the new international security challenges. Interestingly, he adopted a more hawkish tone during the November 2001 parliamentary elections, stating: “We do not want to give up our way of life, our democracy, our values, our safety . . . our future is common—our security is also that of NATO and the US,”322 before the debate began over the possibility of joining a US-led military operation to topple Saddam Hussein. By 2002, however, both the Social Democratic323 and Social Liberal parties “refused to accept the threat perception expressed by the Liberals and the Conservatives,”324 drawing a clear line between themselves and the government. In sum, the political debate in Denmark over the 2003 Iraq war—or the broader post-9/11 security context that led to it—was only weakly influenced by the notion of a “threat to national security.” Even when it was utilized by the key political parties, it failed to outweigh the policy divergences between them and forge parliamentary unity, as one would expect from a true national security threat.\n\nPolitical Leadership: How powerful was political leadership in explaining the 2003 decision? For one, it is argued that the internal balance of power Page 117 →between the Liberals and Conservatives in the coalition had elevated the leadership of Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. International observers portray the relationship between the two governing parties as having “a big brother–little brother character” and explain that while Rasmussen and the Liberals had met their campaign promises, the Conservatives failed to do so under their leader, Bendt Bendtsen. This effectively allowed Rasmussen to “dominate the political agenda”325 and put his leadership skills far ahead of his coalition partner.\n\nAnalysts unanimously agree that Rasmussen also played a key role in the run-up to Denmark’s decision to join the 2003 war.326 Bo Elkjær, an award-winning Danish journalist, reported that Rasmussen was personally convinced of the war’s rationale as early as September 2002: “I am not in the slightest doubt that he possesses weapons of mass destruction and wishes to manufacture them,” the prime minister said at the time.327\n\nIn a similar vein, Mouritzen argues that the prime minister “himself took the decision, after a phone call from President Bush,” explaining how joining the war was his idea since the beginning.328 Henriksen and Ringsmose provide a detailed account of the close personal relationship that Rasmussen and President Bush developed in the post-9/11 period and especially on the eve of the war to suggest that Rasmussen was personally invested in the decision.329 There is ample evidence to support the argument that Rasmussen’s powerful position in the coalition government, his conviction about the war, and his personal relationship with the US president jointly influenced the government’s proposal to join the war in 2003.\n\nStill, Rasmussen’s leadership does not eliminate the role of coalition dynamics in explaining the 2003 episode. Since the decision to participate in the war constitutionally needed parliamentary consent, his coalition’s minority status in the parliament required it to seek the opposition’s support. The structural weakness of the coalition, in other words, simply compelled it to cooperate with the Danish People’s Party to secure the Page 118 →parliamentary vote for the war decision. It should be noted, however, that Rasmussen’s leadership was instrumental here as well; he was the one who used the “cultural war” frame to bring the DPP closer to his government’s preference point, as I explained earlier.\n\nTherefore, from the perspective of the policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations, the 2003 decision defies expectations. Denmark should not have been able to join the US-led war in Iraq since the minority coalition that made the proposal to the parliament was purely right-wing. Unable to reach across the aisle like the Schlüter coalition had done following the 1988 elections, Rasmussen’s Liberal-Conservative coalition allowed an ideologically unified leftist parliamentary opposition to challenge its foreign policy agenda and impede its ability to make international commitments. Yet the parliamentary vote was secured in March 2003. My analysis suggests that the logrolling relationship that took place between the right-wing minority coalition and the DPP remains the main explanation for Denmark’s 2003 decision to join the war, despite Rasmussen’s assertive leadership. The alignment that took place between the coalition and the DPP both in terms of clipping together each other’s policy interests and the formation of a unified front against the Social Democratic–Social Liberal bloc culminated in a right-wing parliamentary voting majority that resulted in the war decision.\n\nIn sum, the 1990 and the 2003 cases illustrate the conditions under which minority coalitions make commitments abroad. The 1990 decision to join the Persian Gulf blockade demonstrates the power of the policy viability and fragmented opposition explanations, for which the quantitative analyses reported in chapter 3 found support. The 2003 decision, on the other hand, constitutes a deviant case and shows that logrolling provides a strong alternative explanation for commitment behavior when the ideological composition of the minority coalition fails to fragment the opposition. Although minority coalitions suffer from a constant size disadvantage in the parliament, the 2003 decision illustrates that they actively seek and adopt strategies to overcome their disadvantaged position and tip the scale in their favor. Policy-based cooperation with opposition parties constitutes a key strategy to that end. Even when it is placed in the context of public opinion, national security threats, and political leadership, the dynamics of coalition politics continue to be the key explanation for both of these cases. These dynamics demonstrate how minority coalitions can act decisively abroad even though we often expect their structural weakness in the parliament to prevent them from doing so."
