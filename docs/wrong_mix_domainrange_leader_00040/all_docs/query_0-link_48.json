Turk.\n\nNOTICE OF THE EXISTENCE OF INFORMATION CONCERNING SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL;\n\nREQUEST THAT THE PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATE NAMED INDIVIDUALS FOR VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW AND PREPARE INDICTMENTS AGAINST THEM PURSUANT TO ARTICLES 18.1 AND 18.4 OF THE TRIBUNAL STATUTE.\n\nWHEREAS the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible\n\nfor Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the\n\nTerritory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 was established by the UN\n\nSecurity Council with \"the power to prosecute persons responsible for serious\n\nviolations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the\n\nformer Yugoslavia since 1991 in accordance with the provisions of\" its Statute\n\n(Article 1);\n\nAND WHEREAS by Article 2 of the said Statute, the Tribunal has the power \"to\n\nprosecute persons committing or ordering to be committed grave breaches of the\n\nGeneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, namely the following acts against persons\n\nor property protected under the provisions of the relevant Geneva Convention\n\nincluding the following:\n\n(a) wilful killing;\n\n(c) wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health;\n\n(d) extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity\n\nand carried out unlawfully and wantonly.\n\nAND WHEREAS by Article 3 of the said Statute, the International Tribunal shall\n\nhave the power to prosecute persons violating the laws or customs of war. Such\n\nviolations shall include, but not be limited to:\n\n(a) employment of poisonous weapons or other weapons to cause unnecessary\n\nsuffering;\n\n(b) wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not\n\njustified by military necessity;\n\n(c) attack, or bombardment, by whatever means, of undefended towns, villages,\n\ndwellings, or buildings;\n\n(d) seizure of, destruction or wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to\n\nreligion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, historic monuments and works of art\n\nand science.\n\nAND WHEREAS by Article 6 of the said Statute \"the International Tribunal shall\n\nhave jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to the provisions of the\n\npresent Statute;\"\n\nAND WHEREAS Article 7 of the said Statute provides for individual criminal\n\nresponsibility thus:\n\n1. A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and\n\nabetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a crime referred to in\n\narticles 2 to 5 of the present Statute, shall be individually responsible for\n\nthe crime.\n\n2. The official position of any accused person, whether as Head of State\n\nor Government or as a responsible Government official, shall not relieve such person of criminal\n\nresponsibility or mitigate punishment.\n\n3. The fact that any of the acts referred to in articles 2 to 5 of the present\n\nStatute was committed by a subordinate does not relieve his superior of\n\ncriminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the subordinate\n\nwas about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take\n\nthe necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the\n\nperpetrators thereof.\n\n4. The fact that an accused person acted pursuant to an order of a Government\n\nor of a superior shall not relieve him of criminal responsibility, but may be\n\nconsidered in mitigation of punishment if the International Tribunal determines\n\nthat justice so requires.\n\nAND WHEREAS Article 8 of the said Statute provides that the territorial and\n\ntemporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal shall extend to the territory of the\n\nformer Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including its land surface,\n\nairspace and territorial waters. The temporal jurisdiction of the International\n\nTribunal shall extend to a period beginning on 1 January 1991;\n\nAND WHEREAS by Article 9 of the said Statute the International Tribunal and\n\nnational courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute persons for\n\nserious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory\n\nof the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991 but the International Tribunal\n\nshall have primacy over national courts;\n\nAND WHEREAS Article 18 of the said Statute provides inter alia that:\n\n1. The Prosecutor shall initiate investigations ex-officio or on the basis of\n\ninformation obtained from any source, particularly from Governments, United\n\nNations organs, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The\n\nProsecutor shall assess the information received or obtained and decide whether\n\nthere is sufficient basis to proceed.\n\n2. The Prosecutor shall have the power to question suspects, victims and\n\nwitnesses, to collect evidence and to conduct on-site investigations. In\n\ncarrying out these tasks, the Prosecutor may, as appropriate, seek the\n\nassistance of the State authorities concerned.\n\n4. Upon a determination that a prima facie case exists, the Prosecutor shall\n\nprepare an indictment containing a concise statement of the facts and the crime\n\nor crimes with which the accused is charged under the Statute. The indictment\n\nshall be transmitted to a judge of the Trial Chamber.\n\nAND WHEREAS the President of the Tribunal, Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, in a\n\npress release of April 8, 1999, urged that:\n\nAll States and organisations in possession of information pertaining to the\n\nalleged commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal should\n\nmake such information available without delay to the Prosecutor.\n\nAND WHEREAS on April 30 in Geneva the United Nations High Commissioner for\n\nHuman Rights Mary Robinson in a speech to the Commission cited a letter from the\n\nProsecutor in which the Prosecutor stated:\n\nThe actions of individuals belonging to Serb forces, the Kosovo Liberation Army\n\n(KLA), or NATO may come under scrutiny, if it appears that serious violations\n\nof international humanitarian law have occurred.\n\nAND WHEREAS High Commissioner Robinson also stated in her speech:\n\nIn the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, large numbers of\n\ncivilians have incontestably been killed, civilian installations targeted on\n\nthe grounds that they are or could be of military application and NATO remains\n\nsole judge of what is or is not acceptable to bomb¹In this situation, the\n\nprinciple of proportionality must be adhered to by those carrying out the\n\nbombing campaign. It surely must be right to ask those carrying out the bombing\n\ncampaign to weigh the consequences of their campaign for civilians in the\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nAND WHEREAS NATO has carried out between 5,000 and 10,000 bombing missions over\n\nthe territories of the former Yugoslavia since March 24, 1999;\n\nAND WHEREAS NATO leaders have openly admitted targeting civilian infrastructure\n\nas well as military targets;\n\nAND WHEREAS the list of targets has included fuel depots, oil refineries,\n\ngovernment offices, power stations and communications links, such as roads,\n\ntunnels, bridges and railway links, including those not inside the region of,\n\nor in the vicinity of, Kosovo;\n\nAND WHEREAS in addition to these deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure\n\nand objects, there have been a great number of attacks which have caused direct\n\nphysical harm and death to civilians;\n\nAND WHEREAS it appears that these bombing missions have directly caused the\n\ndeath of approximately 1,000 civilian men, women and children and serious\n\ninjury to 4,500 more;\n\nAND WHEREAS instances of this nature include the 12 April bombing of a train\n\ntravelling from Belgrade to Ristovac as it crossed the bridge spanning the\n\nYuzhna Morava river at the Grdelica gorge, killing at least 10 passengers and\n\nwounding 16; the 15 April bombing of a refugee convoy in four separate\n\nlocations along a 12 mile stretch of the road that runs from Prizren to\n\nDjakovica, killing approximately 74 people; the 23 April bombing of Serbian\n\nTelevision editorial offices, killing approximately 15 people; the 27 April\n\nbombing of a residential district in Surdulica, killing 16 people including 12\n\nchildren; and the May 1 bombing of a bus on the Luzan bridge in Kosovo killing\n\nat least 34 people including 15 children;\n\nAND WHEREAS, though the above-named NATO leaders have claimed that these\n\nincidents were accidents, they have also admitted that they were an inevitable\n\nresult of their bombing strategy, a strategy which they appear to have\n\ncontinued unmodified and even to have intensified throughout these incidents;\n\nAND WHEREAS there is ample evidence in the public statements of NATO leaders\n\nthat these attacks on civilian targets are part of a deliberate attempt to\n\nterrorize the population to turn it against its leadership;\n\nAND WHEREAS the NATO bombing has done an estimated $100 billion dollars in\n\nproperty damage and completely destroyed or seriously damaged dozens of\n\nbridges, railways and railway stations, major roads, airports, including\n\ncivilian airports, hospitals and health care centres, television transmitters,\n\nmedieval monasteries and religious shrines, cultural-historical monuments and\n\nmuseums, hundreds of schools, faculties and facilities for students and\n\nchildren, thousands of dwellings and civilian industrial and agricultural\n\nfacilities;\n\nAND WHEREAS refineries and warehouses storing liquid raw materials and\n\nchemicals have been hit causing environmental contamination and exposing the civilian\n\npopulation to the emission of poisonous gases;\n\nAND WHEREAS the NATO bombings have also made use of weapons banned by\n\ninternational convention, including cruise missiles utilizing depleted uranium\n\nhighly toxic to human beings;\n\nAND WHEREAS credible detailed reports of the civilian death and destruction\n\ninflicted by the NATO bombing are attached as an Annex to this Notice;\n\nAND WHEREAS THEREFORE there is abundant evidence that many instances of serious\n\nviolations of international humanitarian law within the jurisdiction of the\n\nTribunal have been committed by NATO forces in the attack on Yugoslavia\n\ncommencing March 24 and continuing to this day;\n\nAND WHEREAS this evidence is readily available to the Prosecutor in eyewitness,\n\nvideotaped, televised and publicly broadcast reports, in press reports and on\n\nthe Internet, and in the evidence presented by the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia in its current complaint against the NATO countries before the\n\nInternational Court of Justice;\n\nAND WHEREAS all of the above-named persons, Heads of State and Government\n\nof the 19 NATO countries, their Foreign Ministers and Ministers of Defence, and\n\nofficials and military leaders of NATO, have admitted publicly to having agreed\n\nupon and ordered these actions, being fully aware of their nature and effects;\n\nAND WHEREAS the above-named persons have acted in open violation of the United\n\nNations Charter, which provides in so far as is relevant:\n\nArticle 2\n\n3. All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in\n\nsuch a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not\n\nendangered.\n\n4. All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat\n\nor use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of\n\nany state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United\n\nNations.\n\nArticle 33\n\n1. The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger\n\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek\n\na solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration,\n\njudicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other\n\npeaceful means of their own choice.\n\nArticle 37\n\n1. Should the parties to a dispute of the nature referred to in Article 33 fail\n\nto settle it by the means indicated in that Article, they shall refer it to the\n\nSecurity Council.\n\n2. If the Security Council deems that the continuance of the dispute is in fact\n\nlikely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, it\n\nshall decide whether to take action under Article 36 or to recommend such terms\n\nof settlement as it may consider appropriate.\n\nArticle 39\n\nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace,\n\nbreach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or\n\ndecide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to\n\nmaintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nArticle 41\n\nThe Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed\n\nforce are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon\n\nthe Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include\n\ncomplete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air,\n\npostal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance\n\nof diplomatic relations.\n\nArticle 42\n\nShould the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41\n\nwould be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by\n\nair, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore\n\ninternational peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations,\n\nblockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the\n\nUnited Nations.\n\nArticle 51\n\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or\n\ncollective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the\n\nUnited Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to\n\nmaintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the\n\nexercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the\n\nSecurity Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and\n\nresponsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any\n\ntime such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore\n\ninternational peace and security;\n\nAND WHEREAS the International Court of Justice has stated in ruling against\n\nUnited States intervention in Nicaragua:\n\nIn any event, while the United States might form its own appraisal of the\n\nsituation as to respect for human rights in Nicaragua, the use of force could\n\nnot be the appropriate method to monitor or ensure such respect. With regard to\n\nthe steps actually taken, the protection of human rights, a strictly\n\nhumanitarian objective, cannot be compatible with de mining of ports, the\n\ndestruction of oil installations, or again with de training, arming and\n\nequipping of the contras.\n\n(CASE CONCERNING THE MILITARY AND PARAMILITARY ACTIVITIES IN AND AGAINST NICARAGUA (NICARAGUA v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA) (MERITS) Judgment of 27 June, 1986, I.C.J. Reports, 1986, p.134-135, paragraphs 267 and 268)\n\nAND WHEREAS the above-named persons, Heads of State and Government of the 19\n\nNATO countries, their Foreign Ministers and Ministers of Defence, and officials\n\nand military leaders of NATO have acted in open violation of the NATO Treaty\n\nwhich provides in so far as is relevant:\n\nArticle 1\n\nThe Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to\n\nsettle any international dispute in which they may be involved by peaceful\n\nmeans in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are\n\nnot endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat\n\nor use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United\n\nNations.\n\nArticle 7\n\nThis Treaty does not affect, and shall not be interpreted as affecting in any\n\nway the rights and obligations under the Charter of the Parties which are\n\nmembers of the United Nations, or the primary responsibility of the Security\n\nCouncil for the maintenance of international peace and security;\n\nAND WHEREAS the above-named persons have acted in open violation of the\n\nProtocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the\n\nProtection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June\n\n1977, which provides as follows:\n\nArt 51. Protection of the civilian population\n\n1. The civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general\n\nprotection against dangers arising from military operations. To give effect to\n\nthis protection, the following rules, which are additional to other applicable\n\nrules of international law, shall be observed in all circumstances.\n\n2. The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not\n\nbe the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of\n\nwhich is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.\n\n3. Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and\n\nfor such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.\n\n4. Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are:\n\n(a) those which are not directed at a specific military objective;\n\n(b) those which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at\n\na specific military objective; or\n\n(c) those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot\n\nbe limited as required by this Protocol;\n\nand consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military\n\nobjectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.\n\n5. Among others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as\n\nindiscriminate:\n\n(a) an attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single\n\nmilitary objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military\n\nobjectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar\n\nconcentration of civilians or civilian objects;\n\nand\n\n(b) an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life,\n\ninjury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof,\n\nwhich would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military\n\nadvantage anticipated.\n\nArt 79. Measures or protection for journalists\n\n1.

At the same time, this aggression is a crime against peace,\n\nstability and humanity.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has warned on time the\n\nUnited Nations Security Council of a possible aggression, and during the\n\naggression itself it requested that it be immediately halted and\n\nmost strongly condemned. Had this legitimate request of the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia been met, enormous human sufferings and\n\ndestruction would have been avoided. The most illustrative examples\n\nare given below.\n\nKILLING AND PLIGHT OF THE CIVILIANS\n\nDuring the last thirty-six days of NATO aggression, the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia has been exposed to extensive civilian\n\ndestruction, unprecedented in modern history of the world. NATO\n\naggressors have focused their attacks primarily on civiliantargets,\n\ndirectly threatening the lives and fundamental human rights of the\n\nentire population of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. By bombing\n\nrelentlessly the cities, towns and villages throughout Yugoslavia,\n\nthe NATO aggressor has killed so far, in nine hundred attacks, more\n\nthan a thousand civilians, including a great number of children.\n\nOver five thousand people sustained injuries, many of whom will\n\nremain crippled for life. At the same time, several thousand private\n\nhomes and flats have been ruined, mostly in Belgrade, Nis, Cuprija,\n\nAleksinac, Pristina, etc. We shall present the most tragic instances\n\nof the killings and plight of the innocent civilian population.\n\nFifty-five passengers were killed and twenty-six injured in an\n\ninternational passenger train on the Belgrade-Thessaloniki line.\n\nMore than four hundred civilians were killed by NATO bombs in\n\nKosmet: in the centre of Pristina, in Djakovica, Prizren, Kosovo\n\nPolje, Urosevac, Kosovska Mitrovica, in refugee camps in Orahovac\n\nand Srbica, Vitina, etc.\n\nThirteen civilians were killed and twenty-five wounded in an attack on Kursumlija.\n\nTwelve civilians were killed and forty wounded in the bombing of Aleksinac.\n\nSixteen RTS workers were killed and seventeen wounded in the bombing of the\n\nheadquarters of this biggest adio and Television outlets in\n\nthe FRY. Unfortunately, the final number of victims has not been\n\nestablished yet since more victims have remained buried in the rubble.\n\nIn Pancevo, Cacak, Vranje and Nis the number of casualties has been\n\nincreasing each day.\n\nKILLING OF CHILDREN\n\nChildren are the most vulnerable category of the population,\n\ninnocent and defenceless which suffer in particular due to the\n\nbarbaric bombing of NATO aircraft, which is illustrated by the\n\nfollowing examples:\n\nThe killing of seven children in Srbica from cluster bombs;\n\nThe killing of five children from the Kodza family in the village\n\nof Doganovici near Urosevac on 24 April 1999 as a result of the\n\ndelayed effect of bombs (Edon, aged 3, Fisnik, aged 9, Osman, aged 13,\n\nBurim, aged 14 and Vajdet, aged 15. Six other children were also\n\ninjured in the same incident, two of them were seriously wounded.\n\nThe killing of a three-year old Milica Rakic in the Belgrade\n\nsuburb of Batajnica;\n\nThe killing of six children in the refugee centre in Djakovica and\n\n19 children in the refugee column on the Prizren-Djakovica road;\n\nThe death of a child in Kosovo Polje;\n\nThe killing of five years old girl Arta Lugic while her brothers\n\nNeron and Egzon and her sister Arijeta were seriously wounded in\n\nLipljane;\n\nThe killing of nine children in Kursumlija;\n\nThe killing of two children in Aleksinac, as well as other numerous examples.\n\nChildren are most often victims of the sprinkle cluster bombs\n\nwith delayed effect. The death toll on children would have been even\n\nmore tragic, had the missile struck the biggest Maternity Hospital in\n\nBelgrade (It exploded some thirty metres away from the Hospital).\n\nKILLING AND PLIGHT OF REFUGEES\n\nParticularly tragic is the fate of refugees, who convinced that\n\nthey should not believe the propaganda ploys on the alleged \"ethnic\n\ncleansing\" decided to return to their homes. Legitimate authorities\n\nof the FRY encourage them every day to do so and guarantee their\n\nsafety. On the occasion of a return of a large group of refugees,\n\non 14 April, on the Djakovica-Prizren road, NATO aircraft killed 75\n\ncitizens of the FRY and wounded 111. The attack of NATO aircraft\n\nwas systematically prepared and lasted for three hours. In this way,\n\nNATO has in the most brutal way \"demonstrated\" that the story of\n\n\"humanitarian catastrophe\" suits it only if it fits in the\n\nlegitimate aggression on the FRY, as well as that innocent\n\ncivilians are constantly taken advantage of for NATO interests in the\n\nBalkans.\n\nIn addition, NATO bombed several refugee camps in which Serbs\n\nexpelled from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were accommodated\n\n(Djakovica, Pristina, Kursumlija, etc). Several dozens of refugees\n\nwere killed, mostly children and the frail, ruthlessly ending their\n\ntragedy which came about in the wake of the break-up of Yugoslavia.\n\nBOMBING OF SURDULICA\n\nThe aggressors war planes bombed at noon, on 27 April 1999, the\n\nresidential area of the town of Surdulica. On that occasion 16\n\ncitizens were killed (including 12 children), while several dozen\n\nwere wounded out of which twenty persons remained in hospital for\n\nfurther medical treatment. Hundreds of houses were raised to the\n\nground or damaged. Special teams are still clearing up the debris\n\nso that it is not possible at the moment to estimate the real\n\nproportions of this notorious crime.\n\nASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL\n\nREPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC\n\nAn assassination attempt on the President of the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia on 22 April 1999 represents an organised terrorist act\n\nwithout precedent in the history of modern Europe. This is not only\n\na crime against a Head of a sovereign State, but primarily an\n\nattack on the democratically expressed will of a people and thus against\n\nthe foundations of the democratic values of the civilisation.\n\nAlthough the residence of the President of the Federal Republic of\n\nYugoslavia was targeted, this attack has also a symbolic meaning as\n\nif the targets had been the homes of all Yugoslav citizens. This\n\ncrime has caused abhorrence and condemnation by international\n\npublic. However, it is incomprehensible that the United Nations\n\nSecurity Council has remained silent and failed to condemn this\n\nterrorist act or the killings of civilians and children.\n\nCRIME AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH\n\nThe destruction of more than ten private radio and television\n\nstations, two dozen TV transmitters, as well as the bombing of the\n\nRadio and Television of Serbia building on 23 April 1999 represents\n\nthe biggest aggression against freedom of thought and a disgrace to\n\nthe civilization at the threshold of a third millennium.\n\nTransmitters at Iriski venac, Krnjaca, Mt Cer, Bukulja, Tornik,\n\nrnivrh, Jasetrebac, Ovcar, Grmija and others were destroyed, so that\n\nthe transmitter infrastructure at the entire territory of Serbia\n\nwas severely damaged. Two times in six days the studios and transmitter\n\nlocated at the business centre \"Usce\" which housed TV stations: BK\n\nTV, Pink, Kosava and SOS Channel, as well as several other radio\n\nstations were bombed.\n\nTransmitter of the TV station Palma was bombed and destroyed on 28\n\nApril 1999.\n\nThe satellite station \"Yugoslavia\" in the village of Prilike near\n\nIvanjica was severely damaged.\n\nBOMBING OF THE BUILDING OF THE RADIO AND\n\nTELEVISION OF SERBIA\n\nThe building was demolished taking a heavy toll during the bombing\n\nof the largest Radio and TV company in the Balkans with 7000 employees\n\nand the state-of-the-art infrastructurewhich was made available to hundreds\n\nof foreign correspondence.\n\nThe aim of this crime, in which 16 RTS workers were killed and 19\n\nwounded, was more than obvious: to suppress the right to a\n\ndifferent opinion and its being publicly expressed with a view to pursuing\n\nfurther war-mongering manipulation with the world public. Clearly,\n\nthe intention of NATO aggressors is to prevent the world public\n\nfrom learning the extensive scope of their crimes and to impose on the\n\nworld their totalitarian and single-minded perception. Many\n\nnewspapers in the world and renowned journalists have already\n\nraised their voice against the propaganda fabrications of the NATO\n\naggressors.\n\nFor all champions of the freedom of speech and for all\n\npeople committed to the right to freedom of expression, this destructive\n\nact represents the last warning alarm before NATO generals take\n\ncontrol over the aggressors' media.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF VITAL YUGOSLAV ECONOMIC FACILITIES\n\nAccording to the assessment of experts from Western countries, the\n\ndamage done to date by NATO air strikes is well in excess of one\n\nhundred billion US dollars. By the destruction of factories,\n\nbusiness capacities and production facilities, more than half a\n\nmillion people have lost their jobs and over two million of them\n\nremained without any kind of income. Destroyed are the industrial\n\ncomplexes in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Nis, Pancevo, Cacak,\n\nKraljevo, Valjevo, Pristina, Vranje, Kursumlija, Krusevac, Kula,\n\nGnjilane, Sremska Mitrovica and in other towns and cities.\n\nThe petrochemical industry of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\n\nhas been totally destroyed, as well as the largest Yugoslav factory of\n\nartificial fertilisers.\n\nPrivate entrepreneurs are a particular target of NATO aggression\n\nand the most glaring example of it is the destruction of the \"Usce\"\n\nbusiness centre in Novi Beograd which was hit on 21 and 27 April\n\n1999. That was one of the biggest business centres in the Balkans,\n\nwhich housed more than a hundred newly established private firms in\n\nfull business expansion, foreign representative offices, seven\n\nprivate Radio and TV stations and one of the most modern\n\npoli-clinics in the FRY. The building of this business centre is\n\nalso one of the landmarks of modern Belgrade.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF BRIDGES\n\nOn the false pretext of \"neutralizing the military power of the\n\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia\", the NATO aggressor started\n\nsystematic destruction of the major Yugoslav road and rail traffic\n\nroutes. About 20 bridges have been totally demolished so far and a\n\nfew dozen of them have been damaged. Also, several dozen major and\n\nlocal roads, airports, railway tracks, railway stations, etc. have\n\nbeen destroyed. All ruined facilities were part of costly capital\n\ninvestments, into which the resources and the efforts of several\n\ngenerations of Yugoslav citizens were pooled. All the facilities\n\nare strategic part of the European traffic infrastructure, and some of\n\nthem are of historical and cultural importance (\"The Wailing Bridge\"\n\nin Novi Sad, on which the Fascists killed several thousand Jews\n\nin the Second World War).\n\nAbout 30 bridges have been destroyed including those at\n\nthe strategic European E-75 corridor. By the destruction of the bridges\n\non the Danube river the aggressors have blocked the entire river\n\nnavigation at this traffic artery of the greatest importance for\n\nEuropean economy and the shortest link between the Northern and\n\nMediterranean sea (The Rhein-Mein-Danube route). Thus, the European\n\nshipping companies suffer each day the damage of over 20 million\n\nDM.\n\nExamples: Sloboda Bridge, Wailing Bridge, Zezelj Bridge and the\n\nbridge in Beska (all in the city of Novi Sad), several bridges on\n\nthe Ibar primary road and on the major railway lines.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER\n\nConcurrently with the humanitarian, NATO strikes have caused an\n\nenvironmental catastrophe which is endangering not only the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, but also the neighbouring countries and the\n\nentire European continent. Ecology does not recognize boundaries.\n\nThe NATO aggressor is thus teetering on the brink of another\n\nChernobyl in the heart of Europe. The destruction of petrochemical\n\ninstallations, the warehouses storing semi-processed and finished\n\nproducts of the chemical industry have already caused significant\n\nadverse effects on the health of the population of the Federal\n\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the neighbouring countries. During some\n\nof the air strikes it was pure luck that an environmental\n\ncatastrophe was not provoked spreading all over Europe.\n\nThe aggressor's attacks did not spare even huge forests, tourist\n\ncentres and the national parks on the mountains of Serbia\n\n(Kopaonik, Zlatibor, Divcibare, Tara, Prokletije, Sara, Fruska Gora). The\n\nozone layer was depleted by the exhaust gases. The Black Sea, Aegean and\n\nthe Adriatic basins, practically the entire Mediterranean, are\n\nthreatened by environmental pollution.\n\nExamples: Nitrogen factory in Pancevo, the oil refineries in\n\nPancevo and Novi Sad, the chemical company \"Prva iskra\" in Baric and others.\n\nHOSPITALS AND HEALTH INSTITUTIONS\n\nThe aggressors' bombings, calculated to provoke the greatest\n\npossible confusion and panic among innocent people, have damaged\n\nmany clinical and hospital centres, inflicting not only great\n\nmaterial damage to property (destruction of buildings and expensive\n\nmedical equipment), but also causing new health problems and\n\nintensifying psychological traumas among the sick people. The\n\ndestruction of all the three bridges in Novi Sad totally cut off\n\nand left, without the supply of water, the largest Yugoslav centre for\n\nthe treatment of cardiovascular diseases, to which several million\n\npeople gravitate. The Maternity Hospital in Belgrade, and the\n\nbiggest hospital in the Balkans (Military Medical Academy Hospital\n\nVMA), and the Orthopaedic hospital of Banjica, the hospitals in\n\nCuprija and Aleksinac, as well as the medical centres in Pristina\n\nand in many other towns were damaged.\n\nDESTRUCTION OF PRE-SCHOOL INSTITUTIONS, SCHOOLS\n\nAND UNIVERSITIES\n\nSince the outset of the aggression, NATO has put a stop to the\n\neducation of close to one million pupils and students in\n\nYugoslavia. Over three hundred facilities built for the education and\n\nupbringing of children and young people of all ages were destroyed. This will\n\ninevitably be reflected on the development and social integration\n\nof young people. Hard hit are university centre in Nis (Machine\n\nEngineering, Civil Engineering, Electronical, Technical, Law and\n\nEconomics faculties), in Pristina (Agricultural and Machine\n\nEngineering faculty) and Novi Sad (Faculty of Philosophy).\n\nDESTRUCTION OF WORLD CULTURAL HERITAGE\n\nON THE SOIL OF THE FR OF YUGOSLAVIA\n\nKosovo and Metohija in particular, but also the entire territory of\n\nthe FR of Yugoslavia, is a treasury of European culture and\n\ncivilization since ancient times. By violating all international\n\nconventions on the protection of civilization and its heritage, and\n\nin the pursuit of the spirit of aggressive nihilism and new\n\nbarbarity, more than 50 monasteries and churches have been severely\n\ndamaged thus far, as well as a couple of dozen of other cultural\n\nand historic monuments, some under UNESCO protection. Severe damage was\n\ncaused to the monastery of the Patriarchate of Pec (12th century),\n\nZica (13th century), Decani and Gracanica (14th century, under\n\nUNSECO protection), medieval towns of Zvecan (13th century) and\n\nSmederevo (15th century), Petrovaradin fortress (18th century),\n\nseventeen monasteries on Fruska Gora (15-18th century) and many\n\nother priceless historical monuments. The bombs have even destroyed\n\nmany cemeteries all across Yugoslavia.\n\nUSE OF PROHIBITED WEAPONS\n\nIn NATO attacks, the state-of-the-art weapons have been used, but\n\nalso those prohibited under international conventions, such as\n\ncluster bombs and slow activating bombs. In a month-long attacks on\n\ncivilian and other facilities in Serbia, NATO aircraft fired more\n\nthan 3,500 missiles, including 60 containers with 14,400 cluster\n\nbombs. As many as 3,600 cluster bombs were used in the attacks\n\nagainst towns in Kosmet - Pristina, Urosevac, Djakovica, Prizren\n\netc, and many other places and facilities in Serbia. Before the\n\nattacks, radio locators were dropped from the aircraft, found in\n\nthe vicinity of many civilian and business facilities in Serbia.\n\nCO-ORDINATION BETWEEN NATO AND TERRORISTS OF THE SO-CALLED \"KLA\"\n\nWhile before the onset of the aggression Albanian terrorists\n\ncounted on NATO aircraft as air support to their armed groups, now arming,\n\nequipping and transport of Albanians living in the USA and other\n\nwestern countries is under way, for actions in the FRY, with a view\n\nto making armed formations from them to serve as ground troops of\n\nthe \"Alliance\". Albanian terrorists are being trained and armed in\n\nthe camps in northern Albania - in Tropoje, Kukes and Bajram Curri\n\n(they are trained by British, US and Turkish commandos), and then\n\nillegally infiltrated into Kosovo and Metohija. Such activity, in\n\ndirect violation of the resolutions of Security Council, has been\n\nparticularly stepped up in April when concrete plans for ground\n\ninvasion against the FRY started to be hatched. So far, several\n\nhundred terrorists have been transported from the USA to Albania.\n\nPlans are made to equip, arm and train for coordinated actions with\n\nNATO, around 6,000 Albanians. According to western sources,\n\nAlbanian terrorists represent the main source of intelligence for NATO, of\n\nmilitary character or those aimed at spreading propaganda against\n\nour country.\n\nAt the moment it is difficult to perceive and evaluate all the\n\nhumanitarian, economic, environmental, health and other consequences\n\nof the NATO criminal aggression against the FR of Yugoslavia. The\n\ngreatest victim of the aggression is the entire Yugoslav people and\n\nits material and cultural resources. At the same time, the\n\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations, the NATO has created a\n\nprecedent which may a cast a shadow over the future of all peoples\n\nand sovereign States. The cause for concern is all the grater\n\nbecause, by combining pressure and promises, NATO is drawing an\n\nincreasing number of countries into its aggression against the FR\n\nof Yugoslavia, which will have long-term negative consequences on the\n\nfuture relations and co-operation between all Southeast European\n\ncountries. Attempts by NATO to justify its brutal aggression by an\n\nalleged care for the refugees may bring about an irreversible\n\ndegradation of the United Nations and involve this highest\n\ninternational forum in the crime against a country which is one of\n\nits founding members.\n\nCIVILIAN VICTIMS AND DEVASTATION IN NATO AGGRESSION\n\nON YUGOSLAVIA (April 23,1999)\n\nOVERVIEW OF DESTRUCTION OF CIVILIAN TARGETS ON THE TERRITORY OF THE FEDERAL\n\nREPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA AS A RESULT OF BARBARIC AND CRIMINAL AGGRESSION BY NATO, FROM 24 MARCH TO 19 APRIL 1999\n\nCIVILIAN CASUALTIES\n\nFrom the onset of NATO aggression against our country up to 19 April 1999, the\n\nNorth Atlantic Alliance made over 7,000 criminal attacks against the territory\n\nof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 700 warplanes, of which 530 combat\n\nplanes, were used; more than 2000 cruise missiles were launched and over 6,000\n\ntons of explosives were dropped.\n\nAbout 500 civilians were killed and more than 4,000 sustained\n\nserious injuries e.g.: in Kursumlija: 13 dead and 25 wounded;\n\nin Pancevo: 2 dead and 4 wounded;\n\nin Cacak: one dead and 7 wounded;\n\nin Kragujevac: over 120 workers were wounded during an attack on the car\n\nfactory \"Zastava\";\n\nin Vranje: two dead and 23 wounded;\n\nin Aleksinac: 12 dead and more than 40 wounded;\n\nin Nagavac village, Orahovac municipality: 11 dead and 5 wounded;\n\nin Pristina: 10 dead and 8 wounded;\n\nGrdelicka gorge: 55 killed and 16 wounded;\n\nattack on two refugee columns, with four cruise missiles, on the\n\nDjakovica-Prizren road: 75 killed and 100 wounded, of whom 26 critically;\n\nin the village of Srbica: 10 killed, among whom 7 children;\n\nBelgrade suburb of Batajnica: a three year old girl was killed,and\n\nfive civilians wounded.\n\nThree million children are endangered in our country as a result of war and\n\nbombardment by NATO criminals.\n\nAfter these barbarian attacks hundreds of thousands citizens have\n\nbeen exposed to poisonous gasses which can have a lasting\n\nconsequences on the health of the entire population and the\n\nenvironment.\n\nAfter the demolition of the Petrovaradin bridge, Novi Sad and\n\nPetrovaradin were cut of water supply (600 000 citizens) since the\n\nmain and city pipeline was constructed into the bridge. About one\n\nmillion citizens in our country are short of water supply due to the\n\nbombardment of NATO aggressors.\n\nAbout 500 000 workers became jobless due to the total destruction of industrial\n\nfacilities all around the country. Two million citizens have no means for\n\nliving and cannot ensure the minimum for existence.\n\nOverall material damage is enormous. Preliminary estimates indicate that\n\nbarbaric air strikes of the neo-fascist NATO alliance, since the beginning of\n\nthe unprovoked aggression on the SR of Yugoslavia,on industrial, commercial and\n\ncivil facilities and structures throughout our peace-loving country, have\n\nincurred damages in excess of 10 billion dollars.
