        "text": "Following the previous (December 1990) general elections, Prime Minister Poul Schluter and his conservative coalition Cabinet resigned in January 1993 over a refugees-related scandal and Mr. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen succeeded Mr. Schluter at the head of a centre-left coalition since his Social Democratic Party (SD) held a parliamentary plurality at the time. The centre-right groups had been in power since 1982.\n\nOn 29 August 1994, the election date was set for September – i.e., three months before the polling deadline. Economic issues dominated debate during the short campaign, as both the ruling coalition and its opponents sought to take credit for recent positive developments in this field – continued annual growth in the gross national product (GNP), paralleled by a low inflation rate and decreasing budget deficit. The two sides disagreed on the question of Denmark’s extensive welfare system, with Mr. Rasmussen pledging to bolster it and Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Liberal Party, advocating cuts so as to reduce the deficit further. The latter in fact generally called for more restraint on public spending to allow for lower taxes and to stimulate higher private-sector growth.\n\nOn polling day, the outgoing governing coalition – comprising the SD, the Radical Liberals (RV), the Centre Democrats (CD) and the Christian People’s Party (KrF) – lost a total of 14 seats while the Liberal gained an almost equivalent number to become the second-ranked party in the Folketing. Despite this turn of events, the SD and its allies (minus the KrF) were returned to power, Prime Minister Rasmussen and his Cabinet being sworn in on 26 September. As this minority Government controlled but 76 of the 179 Folketing seats (14 short of a majority), it would need the support of two other leftist parties including the extremist Red-Green Alliance, an anti-European Union group represented in Parliament for the first time. At the other end of the ideological gamut, the far-right, anti-foreigner Progress Party (FP) captured 11 seats, but its controversial extremist policies had led to criticism of Mr. Ellemann-Jensen during the campaign when he had proposed that the group participate in a right-wing governing alliance."
