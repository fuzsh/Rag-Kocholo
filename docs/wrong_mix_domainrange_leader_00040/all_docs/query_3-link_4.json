        "text": "Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former prime minister of Denmark, today announced that he is stepping down as president of the Party of European Socialists (PES) after seven-and-a-half years.\n\nRasmussen, 68, said his decision was mainly for health reasons. In a statement, he said: “My entire political career I have listened to the body politic and tried to make the best call. Now it is time to listen to the demands of my own body and make the responsible call.”\n\nHe said that, after several decades in national and European politics, “the time has come for me to focus on my family, on projects close to my heart in Denmark and trying to stay in good shape”.\n\nRasmussen worked for trade unions in Denmark for 14 years before being elected to the Danish parliament in 1988. He was leader of the Danish Social Democrats from 1992 to 2002, and in January 1993 became prime minister, a post he held until November 2001. In 2004, he became an MEP and was elected president of the PES. He stepped down as an MEP in 2009.\n\nRasmussen said he would leave the role after a PES convention in Brussels on 25-26 November. He said that the meeting would be the “biggest ever gathering of European progressives” and described it as a platform for launching the PES’s “shared dreams”.\n\nSenior PES figures will hold a meeting in Brussels on 24 November to discuss the leadership of the group. No successor is expected to be appointed until next year.\n\nThe PES brings together socialist, social democrat and labour parties from across Europe. It has 33 full member parties from across the EU and Norway, 12 associate parties and five observer parties. It is separate from the group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
