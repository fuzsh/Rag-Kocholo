        "text": "The jubilant face of anti-euro campaigner Pia Kjaersgaard was beamed onto a giant television screen feet away from Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.\n\nPolitical parties had set up camp in different rooms of the parliament, eating and drinking and waiting for the euro referendum result.\n\nAs it became clear the \"no\" campaign had won, there was the sound of popping champagne corks through some doorways, and groans of disbelief through others.\n\n\"I am feeling very sad,\" sighed Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft.\"\n\nIN DEPTH\n\nDenmark says no\n\nChanging face of Europe\n\nFellow Social Democrat Lotte Bundsgard, 23, drew deeply on a cigarette and said: \"I hope people in Britain and Sweden make a cleverer choice than we have.\"\n\nIn the room occupied by the Centrum Demokrats (Centre Democrats), campaigners sat stoney-faced at tables scattered with half-empty bottles of wine, obsolete \"Vote Yes\" placards arranged around the walls.\n\n\"I wanted it to be a yes,\" said campaigner Kristian Mortensen, 24, \"But I sensed early on it was going to be a no. I feel very down inside.\"\n\nMortensen's disappointment contrasted sharply with the mood in the Danish People's Party (DPP) room, where leader Kjaersgaard and her colleagues were in party mood.\n\n\"I have never felt better in the whole of my life,\" laughed economist Jens Wibeck, 31. \"Even the birth of my children doesn't compare.\"\n\nSuzanna Jensen, 48, a DPP candidate, added: \"It is difficult to explain just how good I feel. For weeks I've felt like I've had an ice cube in the pit of my stomach. Now we've won I just feel I can't put it into words. The Danish people have done the right thing.\"\n\nOut on the streets\n\nBut the DPP celebrations appeared subdued compared with those of Copenhagen's anarchists and communists.\n\nOne of the more unlikely elements of the whole referendum campaign was the uneasy alliance of left and right in opposition to Danish entry into the single currency.\n\nWhile Kjaearsgaard's neatly dressed supporters sipped champagne and nibbled gateau upstairs in the Folketing (parliament) building, outside a crowd of 700 young people -- all dreadlocks, flak-jackets and pierced noses -- erupted onto the square in front of the Christiansborg Palace.\n\nA mobile sound system was set up, fireworks let off, speeches made, red and black flags waved. Time and again the crowd broke into a chant of \"Enforce the strength of international solidarity.\"\n\n\"We despise Kjaersgaard and all her people,\" explained Jens, 24, \"But we agree with her in opposing the single currency. The European Union is a capitalist project, designed to help the rich. The sooner we get out of it the better.\"\n\nTomas Jenssen, 23, feels the same. An eloquent, impassioned young man, he stands in the centre of the rally waving a huge black and red flag.\n\n\"People say that everyone who opposes the single currency is an extreme nationalist, like the Danish People's Party,\" he says. \"But we're not. We're internationalists. We oppose racism, poverty, capitalism. We want a world that is fair for all. And the single currency doesn't provide that. I am just so damned happy we voted no.\"\n\nLater, as the crowds dispersed, Tomas and his girlfriend Valerie went to the Christianshavn Beboerhus (Christian's Harbour Community House), a left-wing collective of cafes, workshops and bars just outside the centre of town.\n\nHere the celebrations were continuing, although more sedately, for it was by now early morning. A disparate collection of hippies and anarchists were lounging around on barstools and sofas, laughing and soaking up the atmosphere.\n\nOne had obviously drunk too much, and was semi-passed out on the front steps. I asked him how he was feeling.\n\n\"About the result, brilliant,\" he slurred. \"About the alcohol, not so good.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nEurope weighs up Danish no vote\n\nSeptember 29, 2000\n\nVote could signal start of two-tier Europe\n\nSeptember 28, 2000\n\nDanes vote for the toss of a coin\n\nSeptember 28, 2000\n\nRELATED SITE:"
