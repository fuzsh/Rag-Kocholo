Since we’ve found 700 million pieces of people information on the Web, and have built 26 million summaries, we do occasionally get a few things wrong. They’re not always as entertaining as the one we made about you, but occasionally they are very funny. ZoomInfo’s is a 100% automated process, with no human editors, so even when we see mistake we won’t go in and manually repair it. We will learn from the mistake and rewrite the algorithm where the mistake originated, so that we learn and improve.\n\nIf you decide that you no longer want to be listed as the Prime Minister (judging by a few of the responses to your post, you might not want the title) you can actually register your summary, take ownership, and delete the incorrect information and add anything else you’d like the world to know. You will also have a handy url of your own once you do that so that you can link back to your summary, which will continue to grow as we find more information about you."
