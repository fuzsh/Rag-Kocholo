        "text": "A few months after Poul Nyrup Rasmussen became Prime Minister, his 24-year-old daughter, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, takes her own life. The tragedy throws Poul into the worst crisis of his life - at the same time that he has to hold the country's highest office. In 2 programmes, Poul Nyrup searches back in history to find out what kind of illness his daughter Signe suffered from, and whether he, as a father, could have done more to prevent the disaster."
