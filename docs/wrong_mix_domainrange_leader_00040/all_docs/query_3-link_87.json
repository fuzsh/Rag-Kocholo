        "text": "Rafi is a senior peer worker and project officer at Orygen who oversees a team of online peer workers on Orygen’s Moderated Online Social Therapy (MOST) as well as coordinates international student mental health peer work projects for education providers in Victoria, Australia. Within his roles Rafi supervises peer workers, provides input in the development of service delivery models for peer work, delivers workforce training and develops training resources for peer workers. Rafi is trained in intentional peer work principles which ensure that peer work projects are informed by best practice and conducted through the lens of lived experience.\n\nMy passion for lived experience within mental health comes from my own experience of help seeking and accessing support. Within the communities that I existed in, mental health concepts were stigmatised and not widely discussed. My diagnoses of mental ill health were met by family and friends with fear and anxiety rather than hope and optimism. By chance I came across peer work which gave meaning to my experiences and gave me an opportunity to be someone that I wished I had when I was seeking help.\n\nI now dedicate my professional life to promoting the importance of peer work and lived experience work within youth mental health contexts. I continue to be interested in this work to ensure that peer work programs and lived experience is implemented thoughtfully within organisations and that the voices of consumers and lived experience workers are represented and respected.\n\nMy name is Carolina Bermúdez and I was born in Bogotá, Colombia 36 years ago. I currently work as the Program Manager for Kindred Foundation in Colombia, an NGO we created with a group of colleagues from Australia, with the aim of supporting communities in their quest for wellbeing and mental health. While establishing Kindred, I faced an episode of depression myself. This boosted my inner call to work on this topic and encouraged me to get better to share my experience with others.\n\nI studied Anthropology and Philosophy, followed by a Master of Social Policy at the University of Melbourne. This has allowed me to work with Indigenous groups from Colombia and Australia, motivating me to reflect on different understandings of mental health and wellbeing. I have built a special interest on diverse approaches, exploring the intersections between spirituality, science and cultural logics. Thus, developing a strong conviction around the importance of articulating local knowledge, capacities and practices with services.\n\nProjects have allowed me to live such intersections in practice. Currently I am part of the initiative: “Embracing the traditional and the western: indigenous youth’s pursuit to promote mental well-being”, aimed at supporting youth from Vaupés. It is funded by Grand Challenges Canada and implemented by the Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Colombian Amazon. Also, years ago I supported the delivery of mental health workshops for young people in Bogotá as well as the consolidation of manuals for an NGO in Uganda that works with women suffering from depression. Moreover, we have recently been invited as Kindred to support Muisca Indigenous youth’ mental health; the Muisca being ancestral inhabitants of Bogotá.\n\nWorking with communities has allowed me to learn about the holistic and collective aspect of wellbeing and mental health, understanding us humans as integral and interconnected beings.\n\nProfessor Chen is Chi-li Pao Foundation Professor and Chair Professor of Department of Psychiatry at The University of Hong Kong. He has been leading the development of the early intervention for psychosis program in Hong Kong (the Hospital Authority EASY program is one of the first comprehensive early psychosis programs in Asia). Under his leadership, the HKU Psychosis Studies and Intervention Unit has been conducting key studies on schizophrenia and early psychosis. Studies have been published in over 400 papers in leading international journals including the British Medical Journal and the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nInternationally, Prof. Chen had served as Vice-President of the International Early Psychosis Association (with more than 2000 members worldwide) and the Foundation Chairman of the Asian Network for Early Psychosis (ANEP). He has also served on committees of prestigious international organizations such as the Schizophrenia International Research Society and the International Neuropsychiatric Association.\n\nProf. Chen is a recipient of The Richard J. Wyatt Award. The Richard J. Wyatt Award is awarded every two years at the International Early Psychosis Association Biennial Conference. It is awarded to an individual who has made a remarkable contribution to the area of early intervention.\n\nTara is an Australian early career psychologist who is passionate about supporting the well-being of children, adolescents, and young adults. Tara graduated with a Masters in Psychology at the University of Queensland in 2019, and is currently studying a PhD on climate anxiety in children and youth.\n\nTara advocates for involving and listening to youth voices on climate change related issues. Her research focus is to understand how parents, educators, clinicians, and policymakers can support children and youth to channel their climate anxiety in ways that are meaningful for themselves, as well as the planet. Through her work, she has engaged with professionals working in the education, medical, mental health, clean energy, and policy spaces.\n\nTara is also a passionate landscape artist, who loves to create nature scenes to inspire in others a sense of love and awe for the environment.\n\nAviwe Funani is the Waves for Change, Policy and Advocacy Manager providing free mental health services for youth.\n\nShe has a B.com Information Systems degree from the University of the Western Cape and a certificate in Strategic Business Management from the University of Cape Town.\n\nImpact Officer for the Cape Town, Global Shapers Community, an initiative of the World Economic Forum. Where she has led programmes empowering women. She is an alumni Youth Advisory Council member for global youth organisation Orygen Global.\n\nAwarded one of South Africa’s Inspiring Fifty women for 2019 by CoCreate SA and the Embassy of Netherlands in South Africa.\n\nShe uses her platforms to strategically bring positive change for youth and women in the African continent. She is a writer and poet who uses her words to touch on topics like mental health, spirituality, gender, and pan-Africanism.\n\nMy name is Henriette Grundtmann. I am 26 years old and live in Copenhagen, Denmark. I work as an assistant attorney mainly focusing on employment law, and in my spare time I volunteer at “The Social Network/ headspace”, where I give speeches about my own experiences regarding youth mental health.\n\nDuring elementary school and high school, I was never made aware of the importance of mental health. We were told that it very important that we planned ahead, and we were given a ton of school projects about: what do you want to do next in regard to education and jobs? It was never a question of: how do you feel, or what will make you happy?\n\nI was the straight-A-student who got an ulcer right before graduating high school because it was so important to get good grades. I was the law school-student who took three exams during a depression and daily anxiety attacks because taking a break was a failure.\n\nI volunteer at “The Social Network / headspace” because I want to make sure that the Danish youth is told that it is okay to be vulnerable. I want them to know that mental illness is just as acceptable and normal as physical illness.\n\nOf course, I cannot talk on the behalf of every young person in Denmark or just find a simple solution, but I believe that the first step must be asking the youth about what they experience and what solutions they imagine.\n\nSo, that is why I engage in youth mental health. I engage in youth mental health to bring the voice back to the youth. I engage to make sure that the youth, it actually regards, participates in setting the agenda.\n\nKia Ora\n\nMy name is Te Manaia and I am a Maori woman based in Rotorua, New Zealand. I am a student studying a Bachelor of Health Science in psychology as well as an visual artist. Art specifically painting for me is something that I have always been drawn to and I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to do that still. It has helped me specifically understand and navigate particularly challenging periods of my life such as my struggles with anxiety and depression. I think having had personal lived experiences with mental illness has really heightened my desire to want to help in that space and has made me more curious about understanding others, that is why I feel specifically drawn to study psychology. My overall aspirations in life is to help be a part of fixing the health inequities in the mental health space and also I think to empower people to heal in their own journeys with mental or physical difficulties, with a specific emphasise on creative arts as a tool to do so. I feel very grateful to have the opportunities to do many of these things and I don’t take it lightly.\n\nMy name is Siri Jo Genild (she/her/they/them), and I’m an 18-year-old, queer Danish student living and working in Copenhagen. I’m a climate- and political activist in DGUB (den grønne ungdomsbevægelse) as well as SUF (socialistisk ungdomsfront). I’ve been active for five years, and have helped start the sub-group in DGUB – UKO. I’ve co-planned several strikes, demonstrations, and other events regarding the demand for better climate policies. But apart from my activism, I’m deeply affected by the current state of the world, which translates into immense eco-anxiety.\n\nAs a young person, I have an authentic view of how the climate crisis affects young people’s mental health and well-being. I wish to use this knowledge to convey the depth of this climate grief and anxiety to mental health specialists. How eco-anxiety requires a different approach than other mental health cases, and how this grief turns into hopelessness and consequently – the inability to act. Because I believe eco-anxiety is one of the most critical and urgent issues, the mental health community faces.\n\nFatima-Zahra is a Moroccan psychologist and poet who brings together her background in program development, the use of systems thinking, and her rich experience in facilitating paradigm-shifting conversations to rethink mental health systems and policy.\n\nShe’s currently co-chairing the Expert Community Network at Orygen Global, serving as an advisor to the WEF’s Global Shapers Community and leading its Wellbeing Taskforce, and pursuing a MSc in Global Health at Koç University, with a mission to bring mental health to the heart of global agendas.\n\nShe previously co-founded a mental health startup, served on the board of various NGOs, and was invited to speak at the UK parliament, TEDx, and the WEF’s Annual Meeting, among other platforms.\n\nIn her free time, you’ll find her writing poetry, hosting conversations, and exploring various means of creative self-expression.\n\nRaj Mariwala is Director, Mariwala Health Initiative an advocacy, capacity building and grant-making organisation in India that focuses on mental health of marginalised communities. Other than drawing on lived experience of mental illness and a learning disability to inform work on mental health, Raj also has experience working on livelihoods and gender-sexuality. Currently, they serve on the advisory boards of the Lancet Commission on Stigma and Discrimination and Parcham, nonprofit that works with young marginalised women on human rights, equity and social justice. Raj is also a practicing canine and feline behaviourist.\n\nYouth mental health, especially in LMIC contexts is critical to address – after all – today more than 30% of the world’s population is young people and 90% of that number resides in LMICs. Yet, the discourse around youth mental health is led by the global North. So, one interest area is what does youth-led, participatory work look like when led by diverse youth from historically marginalised backgrounds?\n\nMy other interest is in addressing the public health issue of youth suicide which was the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds globally in 2019.
