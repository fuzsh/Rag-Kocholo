        "text": "But things were quite different only seven years ago, as Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen discovered when his country took over the presidency of the EU and the newly-appointed premier embarked on the traditional tour of Union capitals with a strong appeal: Europe must do more to tackle unemployment.\n\nThe reactions were anything but positive. “From John Major in Great Britain, from Helmut Kohl in Germany, from Felipe Gonzalez in Spain I have received the same message: we cannot do much more for employment. But I have told them: yes, together we can do more, and we should do it now,” he said at the time.\n\nIf veterans like Kohl and Gonzalez did not know much about their Danish colleague then, it was hardly their fault. Even to most Danish voters, Rasmussen was an unknown quantity who had spent only five years in politics and who had never held ministerial office before.\n\nToday, the European leaders he visited in 1993 have all left office, with only Rasmussen still in power, making him the doyen at Union summits. And since the Luxembourg summit in 1997, the fight against unemployment has been one of the cornerstones in the Union’s efforts to tackle issues important to ordinary citizens. “Rasmussen really deserves credit for bringing up unemployment at the European level years before it became ‘comme il faut’,” says one.\n\nDanish voters have also learned a great deal more about their prime minister. They now know that he is an amateur singer who is not afraid to give a moving interpretation of Love Me Tender on national television, but they are also all too familiar with his difficulty in cutting through the woolly rhetoric and delivering a clear message.\n\nBut even if Rasmussen has succeeded in putting social issues on the European agenda while largely abolishing joblessness in Denmark, and even if voters have twice prolonged his career as leader of a coalition government, he still has what is arguably the most challenging battle of his political career in front of him: the difficult task of convincing a majority of Danish voters to give up years of Euro-scepticism and agree to join the euro.\n\nIf he succeeds, he will be Denmark’s most successful political leader of modern times. But if he fails, critics will accuse him of having called the referendum prematurely and thereby being responsible for cementing Denmark’s position on the Union’s sidelines.\n\nWith polls showing a majority against giving up the krone, it is hard to say whether Rasmussen made the right decision when he decided to cut through a fruitless debate and called for a referendum on 28 September. “One could ask if he should not have waited until the notes and coins are actually there. That would allow the Danes to see that neither Germany or France will have disappeared after they have abolished their respective currencies. But if it is a ‘yes’ in September, Rasmussen will have written himself into the history books, because that would be the third time he has won a referendum on Europe,” says a leading Danish political analyst.\n\nBrought up in modest surroundings by working-class parents, Rasmussen has always had to work hard for what he wanted. His adolescence provided him with a very strong sense of righteousness. In the playground, he earned a reputation as the big boy who intervened when small kids were being bullied by the older pupils.\n\nHe went on to study economics and, while at university, made friends with other young Social Democrats ambitious to transform society. But unlike many of his fellow students, Rasmussen stayed out of politics and instead opted for a career in the federation of trade unions. He advanced steadily and masterminded a number of important compromises between employers and workers’ organisations.\n\nThe years he spent working for the federation made him an extremely skilled negotiator. He is good at finding a compromise acceptable to all, a talent which is essential in running a traditional Danish minority government. But he also uses his robust physique to tire out his opponents. This is an ability which has proven useful on more than one occasion at EU summits, such as when he stood firm in the face of heavy pressure from the Union heavyweights who wanted to prolong the existence of intra-EU duty free sales in Vienna in December 1998.\n\nRasmussen’s political career only took off in 1987 when former fellow student and Social Democratic Party chairman Svend Auken offered him a post as vice chairman. Rasmussen accepted and won a seat in parliament the following year. But what started as a partnership between two close friends turned into a political drama of rare brutality five years later.\n\nIn 1992, it was clear that ten years of leading different centre-right minority governments had worn down conservative Prime Minister Poul Schluter. But it was also increasingly clear that Auken did not enjoy the confidence of the small parties in the centre of Danish politics – and their support was essential for the Social Democrats to realise their dream of regaining power after a decade in opposition.\n\nIt nevertheless amounted to an earthquake in Danish politics when Rasmussen announced that he would challenge Auken’s leadership of the party at an extraordinary congress. It was the first time that a leader of the Social Democratic Party had been challenged from within and it split the party in two.\n\nAlthough politically inexperienced, Rasmussen won the race and was rewarded little more than six months later when he formed his first government together with the three centrist parties which had talked him into staging the coup against his political mentor.\n\nOne of the premier’s favourite bon mots is that ‘the devil is in the detail’, and he is extremely good at mastering details. But they have sometimes become his devil, such as when he cancelled a planned visit by the author Salman Rushdie to Denmark because of fears that terrorists would attempt to carry out the pending death sentence from Iran. His clumsy handling of the matter almost forced Rasmussen out of office.\n\nThere have been numerous similar occasions where political content has been overshadowed by unprofessional handling of a problem in the prime minister’s office. This has distracted attention from the fact that the Danish economy is in better shape than ever before and unemployment has been brought down to a level not seen since the Sixties.\n\nFor years, it has been said – and with some truth – that meetings with his European colleagues provide Rasmussen with a welcome break from the pinpricks of domestic politics. But ironically, it is precisely those colleagues who have provided him with the diabolical detail which threatens to boost support for the ‘no’ camp in the forthcoming euro referendum.\n\nThe bilateral sanctions imposed by Union governments on Austria have been a nightmare for the Danish prime minister, not only because they have fuelled many Danes’ fears that the EU will develop into a federal state, but also because clumsy handling of the issue in the Danish parliament caused Rasmussen serious trouble which could have brought about his downfall.\n\nThe prime minister has urged the Union’s key players not to swell the ranks of the ‘no’ voters by commenting too directly on the choice facing Denmark, warning that this would spark resentment at home.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, Denmark will take over the EU presidency whether or not it has joined the euro zone. If history repeats itself, a new premier will be appointed shortly before the country takes charge of Union business or at the beginning of the presidency. That was what happened when Rasmussen toppled his predecessor Poul Schluter. The odds on Rasmussen breaking that tradition will very much depend on the outcome of September’s vote."
