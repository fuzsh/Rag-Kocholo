        "text": "The European Commission in its Employment in Europe 2006 report describes flexicurity as an optimal balance between labour market flexibility and security for employees against labour market risks. The Commission’s interpretation of flexicurity involves replacing the notion of job security, a principle that dominated employment relations until recently, with that of ‘protection of people’. The flexicurity model, first implemented in Denmark by the social democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen in the 1990s, is a combination of easy hiring and firing (flexibility for employers) and high benefits for the unemployed (security for the employees). Perceived as a new way of viewing flexibility, flexicurity represents a means whereby employees and companies can better adapt to insecurities associated with global markets.\n\nThe EU has identified a set of common flexicurity principles and is exploring how countries can implement them through four components:\n\n• flexible and reliable contractual arrangements;\n\n• comprehensive lifelong learning strategies;\n\n• effective active labour market policies;\n\n• modern social security systems.\n\nSee Sutlana (2011) for a discussion of the implications for lifelong guidance of the concept of Flexicurity."
