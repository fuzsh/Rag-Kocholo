Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (PSE). - Mr President, I should like to say to President Sarkozy:

(FR) ‘being proactive in politics, that is the most difficult exercise’.

You and I both know that, President.

As you said yourself, Europe is about compromises but also ensuring dynamics. That is my point. I think you took Europe as far as you could go and as far as you could get the 27 prime ministers and heads of state, but please do not oversell the results. That goes especially for President Barroso. Do not oversell the result. If you do so, this will backfire against ordinary people’s trust in the European Union. We have an economic crisis at the moment and it is not over. As you said, it is not over. Please do not tell people that the economic stimulus package corresponds to 1.5% of GDP. It is not. If we take away the credit guarantees from this calculation for the moment and look at the real investments and the real demand, we are down to an average of about 0.6% of the European Union’s GDP. Yes we are, Mr Barroso. The economic calculations from Brueghel and from Copenhagen University confirm it. So be careful here.

The only two countries – and Britain has been criticised by Germany – that are reaching 1% of GDP in real economic stimulus are Gordon Brown’s country and Zapatero’s country. France is coming close. But the real difficulty for the time being lies in Berlin. I simply do not understand how Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, can tell people that what they are doing for employment in Europe at the present time is sufficient. That is not the case.

Mr President, I disagree with what Graham Watson said. You should not just relax. You should keep your energy because we need another stimulus package and we will need it quite soon, already by the spring. I hope that you will be active on 2 April in London and certainly also at the spring summit. As you said yourself, bringing Europe closer to people is about ensuring jobs for people.
