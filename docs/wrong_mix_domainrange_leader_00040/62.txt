On 19 February 1998, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) called general elections for the following month. In doing so, he sought « to ask voters whether they want a new Parliament which can continue the steady policy maintained over the past five years » (that is, since 1993, when Mr. Rasmussen became Prime Minister). The poll would thus be held prior to Denmark’s May 28 referendum on the June 1997 Amsterdam treaty calling for enlargement of the European Union. « We need a stable atmosphere ahead of the referendum », the Prime Minister said.

The three-week campaign ultimately focused as much on domestic as on foreign policy issues, as well as on the personalities of the party leaders. Debate centered on questions of immigration, tax cuts versus welfare, and the economy as a whole. In this connection, the Social Democrats, allied with the small Radical Party in the center-left governing coalition, defended their record in office, having lowered unemployment from 12% to 7% and ushered in a generally flourishing economic situation. The center-right opposition bloc was plagued by internal dissension between moderate and more extreme camps, as epitomized by the divergent views of the Liberal Party (Venstre), led by Mr. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and the far-right Danish People’s Party, headed by Ms. Pia Kjaersgaard. The latter, gaining in popularity, adopted a platform staunchly opposing immigration, tax and European rapprochement.

On election day, the outgoing minority Government (with 70 of 179 seats) defied opinion polls to eek out a victory by the narrowest of margins (one seat), as the Social Democrats and their allies (which also included the Socialist People’s Party) captured 90 seats to 89 for the opposition forces, which also embraced the Conservatives, Centre Democrats and Christian People’s Party. In this context, Mr. Rasmussen remained Prime Minister and unveiled a reshuffled centre-left coalition Cabinet on 23 March.
