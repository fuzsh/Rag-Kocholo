        "text": "New virtualization and fraud prevention solutions and other technologies driven by threat intelligence continue to strengthen Kaspersky Lab’s enterprise security portfolio.\n\nOn 15 April 2014, Kaspersky Lab revealed its vision of enterprise security at the company’s annual CyberSecurity Summit in San Francisco, U.S.A. The event focused on how enterprise IT security realities affected businesses worldwide and featured commentary and panel discussions from influential figures in IT security. At the event, Kaspersky Lab also announced several new security solutions that are now available, as well as planned solutions and business strategies that will guide the company’s growth throughout the year.\n\nA key theme discussed at the event included recent and significant changes to the IT security landscape: sophisticated attacks and complex cyber-espionage campaigns targeting corporations are “the new normal.” Another area of focus was how the IT industry also faces a rising tide of advanced threats specifically targeting financial service networks, a segment which requires specialized security solutions to meet their unique needs.\n\nTo lead the discussion of these core issues, Kaspersky Lab assembled leading experts in IT security from the corporate, government, financial systems, and IT management fields, including representatives of Facebook, Visa, The Boeing Company and Wells Fargo & Co. Tom Ridge, Former Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, delivered a keynote speech: “How Cyberwarfare Impacts Enterprise IT Security.”\n\nEugene Kaspersky, chairman and CEO of Kaspersky Lab, said: “These days cybercrime is no longer about stealing relatively small sums of money from ordinary users. As the IT security landscape evolves rapidly and gets more and more complex, the number of sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns targeting giant corporations is also sharply rising. Criminals are increasingly elaborate in designing their attacks and always try to exploit the weakest link in terms of security, which means that supply chains and contractors are targeted as well. This means that today threat intelligence is one of the top priorities for CIOs and CSOs, who need to ensure their defenses are flexible enough to withstand not just contemporary threats, but also the coming generation of cyber dangers.”\n\nKaspersky Lab expands its enterprise security portfolio\n\nTo equip enterprises with protection from these advanced threats, Kaspersky Lab’s solution portfolio is built on a foundation of threat intelligence and an ability to build technologies in-house instead of through acquisition. These two core company principles produce measurable advantages in protection for our customers, and are central components of the technology innovations which were announced at the Kaspersky CyberSecurity Summit to address critical areas of enterprise IT. The company announced a new expansion of Kaspersky Security for Virtualization, which brings security technologies to virtual endpoints that were previously difficult to secure without sacrificing network performance. The recently-announced Kaspersky Fraud Prevention platform was also highlighted as a way to combat cyber-attacks against financial service providers. Both solutions are now available to the public.\n\nThe comprehensive portfolio of Kaspersky Lab’s enterprise security solutions is complemented by Security Intelligence Services, including threat data analysis and reporting, Botnet tracking, and cybersecurity education programs, harnessing the company’s recognized threat intelligence to enhance protection of its business partners.\n\nLooking towards the future, Kaspersky Lab also discussed new opportunities for enterprise security growth, namely in the area of critical and industrial infrastructure protection, which requires technologies and products that fit the specific needs of industrial networks. These include not only products and solutions which will provide versatile protection for SCADA servers and engineering workstations, but also for PLC protection, network-level, and embedded security.\n\nIntelligence-Driven Solutions for Business\n\nKaspersky Lab’s enterprise security portfolio is built around the company’s core security intelligence, which encompasses award-winning endpoint protection technologies, a cloud-based network of global threat intelligence, and a multi-national team of prominent experts who discovered sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns such as Flame, Gauss, Red October, Winnti, NetTraveler, Kimsuky, Icefog and The Mask/Careto. The company maintains its focus on further development of its technologies by its own highly-skilled professionals, thus allowing for superior performance, tight integration, manageability, and better protection of enterprise IT infrastructures.\n\nNikolay Grebennikov, Chief Technology Officer of Kaspersky Lab, said: “We are always ready to counter cybercrime regardless its origin, target or sophistication. The effectiveness of our solutions is made possible by the fusion of our proven technological capabilities and our world-leading security threat research, which produces results that are unmatched by any other IT security organization.”\n\nThe foundation of the enterprise security portfolio, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business, takes full advantage of our world-leading threat intelligence ecosystem and provides a tiered security approach based on a single integrated platform to incorporate features including robust application, device and web control tools, data encryption, mobile endpoint security and MDM, and systems and patch management. Kaspersky Lab also offers dedicated solutions for File and Mail servers, Storage Systems, Internet Gateways, Collaboration Software, and industry-leading solutions for virtual machines in VMware, Citrix and Microsoft virtual environments.\n\nKaspersky Lab on the global enterprise security market\n\nIn 2013 Kaspersky Lab continued to deliver strong growth in the corporate IT security segment: 9% growth in the corporate segment overall and 18% in the enterprise segment*. Kaspersky Lab’s corporate client base exceeded 250,000 companies located around the globe, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses all the way up to large governmental and commercial organizations.\n\nIn order to reinforce the company’s cybersecurity intelligence foundations, in early 2014 Kaspersky Lab established an International Advisory Board to provide strategic advice in the IT security market to the company. Under the leadership of Howard Schmidt, former Cyber Advisor to both President Bush and President Obama, the Advisory Board brings together six internationally recognized experts in IT security from industry, the public sector and academia to provide practical guidance, insights and validation of the company’s priority business development areas. This Advisory Board represents a milestone for the company ensuring its development in the most appropriate strategic direction.\n\nThe company has been recently identified as a Leader in the most prominent and influential global analyst vendor assessments by the “Big Three” analytic agencies. This recognition is a remarkable achievement; only one market player has ever earned this status from all three organizations before.\n\n\"Kaspersky Lab has steadily and notably strengthened its position in the enterprise security market by delivering efficient endpoint protection suites and targeted security solutions The ability to provide solutions meeting customer needs has driven Kaspersky Lab's market share gains,\" said Charles Kolodgy, Research Vice President for IDC's Security Products. \"Additionally they have built a solid Threat Intelligence reputation through research exposing sophisticated attacks that employ designer malware. Kaspersky Lab is further enriching its enterprise portfolio with security intelligence services and solutions for under-served areas such as Critical Infrastructure Protection and online transaction security. These advancements cement their position as a vendor to watch in the enterprise security market.\"\n\nMore information available in the blog post of Peter Beardmore, Senior Director of Product Marketing, Kaspersky Lab.\n\n* Unaudited revenue growth 2013 vs. 2012"
