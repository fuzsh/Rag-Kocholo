However, some of the most effective solutions have been in existence for decades. In this talk, we’ll delve into the enduring value of these timeless testing tools. We’ll explore how established tools like Selenium, GNU Make, Maven, and Bash remain vital in today’s software development and testing toolkit even though they have been around for a long time (some were even invented before I was born). I’ll share examples of how these tools have addressed our testing and automation challenges, showcasing their adaptability, versatility, and reliability in various scenarios. I aim to demonstrate that sometimes, the “old” ways can indeed be the best ways.\n\nThree available editions of Windows Servers crucial to your organization’s op...\n\nThree available editions of Windows Servers crucial to your organization’s op...Q-Advise\n\nThree available editions of Windows Servers crucial to your organization’s operations Windows Server, Microsoft’s robust operating system, is the cornerstone of enterprise IT infrastructure, tailored for mission-critical operations. It helps in managing enterprise-level tasks, including data storage, applications, and communication. Proper licensing of Windows Server is essential for both legal compliance and optimal functionality within business environments. Windows Server comes in various edition and before any edition is used in your organization, it is required you license them appropriately. The licensing can be complex and capital demanding when you don’t know what you want or understand the licensing requirements. Even if successfully licensed, there are various activities you can practice as an organization to make sure your Server is operating optimally and there is real value for money. This requires a deeper understanding of best practices and our team of cloud and licensing experts can be of support. Send the team an email, info@q-advise.com let’s have a look at your needs, together with you decide which licensing model will best work in your case, assist you with savings options and share with you how pre-owned licensing can help you get licensed adequately also.\n\niBirds Services - Comprehensive Salesforce CRM and Software Development Solut...\n\niBirds Services - Comprehensive Salesforce CRM and Software Development Solut...vijayatibirds\n\nUnlock the full potential of your business with iBirds Services.

Have you ever tried to fix a bug where you just can’t understand what’s going on? This talk will give you practical steps to improve the observability of your Rails app, taking the time to understand and fix defects from hours or days to minutes. Rails 8 will bring an exciting new feature: built-in structured logging. This talk will delve into the transformative impact of structured logging on fixing bugs and saving engineers time. Structured logging, as a cornerstone of observability, offers a powerful way to handle logs compared to traditional text-based logs. This session will guide you through the nuances of structured logging in Rails, demonstrating how it can be used to gain better insights into your application’s behavior. This talk will be a practical, technical deep dive into how to make structured logging work with an existing Rails app. I talk about the Steps to Observable Software - a practical five step process for improving the observability of your Rails app.\n\nTest Polarity: Detecting Positive and Negative Tests (FSE 2024)\n\nTest Polarity: Detecting Positive and Negative Tests (FSE 2024)andrehoraa\n\nPositive tests (aka, happy path tests) cover the expected behavior of the program, while negative tests (aka, unhappy path tests) check the unexpected behavior. Ideally, test suites should have both positive and negative tests to better protect against regressions. In practice, unfortunately, we cannot easily identify whether a test is positive or negative. A better understanding of whether a test suite is more positive or negative is fundamental to assessing the overall test suite capability in testing expected and unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose test polarity, an automated approach to detect positive and negative tests. Our approach runs/monitors the test suite and collects runtime data about the application execution to classify the test methods as positive or negative. In a first evaluation, test polarity correctly classified 117 tests as as positive or negative. Finally, we provide a preliminary empirical study to analyze the test polarity of 2,054 test methods from 12 real-world test suites of the Python Standard Library. We find that most of the analyzed test methods are negative (88%) and a minority is positive (12%). However, there is a large variation per project: while some libraries have an equivalent number of positive and negative tests, others have mostly negative ones.\n\nMonitoring the Execution of 14K Tests: Methods Tend to Have One Path that Is ...\n\nMonitoring the Execution of 14K Tests: Methods Tend to Have One Path that Is ...andrehoraa\n\nThe literature has provided evidence that developers are likely to test some behaviors of the program and avoid other ones. Despite this observation, we still lack empirical evidence from real-world systems. In this paper, we propose to automatically identify the tested paths of a method as a way to detect the method’s behaviors. Then, we provide an empirical study to assess the tested paths quantitatively. We monitor the execution of 14,177 tests from 25 real-world Python systems and assess 11,425 tested paths from 2,357 methods. Overall, our empirical study shows that one tested path is prevalent and receives most of the calls, while others are significantly less executed. We find that the most frequently executed tested path of a method has 4x more calls than the second one. Based on these findings, we discuss practical implications for practitioners and researchers and future research directions.\n\nPathSpotter: Exploring Tested Paths to Discover Missing Tests (FSE 2024)\n\nPathSpotter: Exploring Tested Paths to Discover Missing Tests (FSE 2024)andrehoraa\n\nWhen creating test cases, ideally, developers should test both the expected and unexpected behaviors of the program to catch more bugs and avoid regressions. However, the literature has provided evidence that developers are more likely to test expected behaviors than unexpected ones. In this paper, we propose PathSpotter, a tool to automatically identify tested paths and support the detection of missing tests. Based on PathSpotter, we provide an approach to guide us in detecting missing tests. To evaluate it, we submitted pull requests with test improvements to open-source projects. As a result, 6 out of 8 pull requests were accepted and merged in relevant systems, including CPython, Pylint, and Jupyter Client. These pull requests created/updated 32 tests and added 80 novel assertions covering untested cases. This indicates that our test improvement solution is well received by open-source projects."
