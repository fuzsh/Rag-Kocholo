        "text": "Keynote Presentation\n\nMACRA: The Latest Accelerant to Value-Based Care: Are You Ready?\n\nMACRA, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, is the latest accelerant in our nation’s migration from volume-based healthcare delivery and reimbursement to a value-based environment. MACRA’s unprecedented design will forcefully push forward a transformation in the way healthcare is delivered in our nation – if CMS’ past models have been “carrots,” MACRA is a carrot that comes with a clear and meaningful stick. The implications of MACRA include new and demanding performance requirements for physicians; meaningful financial impact on physician practices; and the triggering of a new wave of consolidation, alignment and integration.\n\nWhile the new administration calls into question the future of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, as well as many other policies enacted over the last eight years, almost all recent commentary from healthcare experts and policy analysts posits that MACRA will not be repealed and is unlikely to be changed in a meaningful way, in part because of the strong bipartisan support it has had from the start, and because it is budget-neutral. Some details embedded in MACRA may be impacted – if the Medicare Shared Savings Program is unwound, for example, qualifying criteria for Advanced APMs will have to be redefined. In addition, to reduce the burden on clinicians, it is possible that the timing for MACRA roll-out will be lengthened with an extended “transition” period, and the qualifying threshold may be raised in order to exempt a larger number of clinicians from the Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS).\n\nGiven the initial reporting period for MACRA started January of 2017, there is compelling urgency for physicians and their health system partners to act now. A careful assessment of current performance and underlying capabilities along with consideration of options to address deficiencies is mandatory.\n\nAn effective MACRA strategy will need to include elements of clinical care transformation, advancement of IT/data management/analytics capabilities, an elevation of alignment and integration among physicians and health system partners, and strong vision and leadership. Those who procrastinate are missing an exceptional strategic opportunity and in fact taking a significant strategic risk.\n\nKeynote speaker:\n\nReactionary Panel Session\n\nHHS, MACRA, Mandatory Bundled Payments, and IT as a Difference Maker\n\nBeware, MACRA has arrived. As the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) continues an aggressive push to drive forward to mandatory bundled payments and capitation, IT's evolution is now a mandated regulation in the transition to a learning healthcare system.\n\nWith MACRA's deadline of January 1, 2017, the first year of provider reporting is already underway. Beyond this, mandatory bundled payments are visible on the horizon as the \"Post-EHR\" era progresses forward, with the bar being set high by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) as it relates to interoperability, reporting to present value of care, and to becoming an enterprise that is prepared for the next generation of healthcare.\n\nIn this session, join our expert presenter as we explore the intricacies of these policies, with a specific focus on MACRA and bundled payments, and how HIT leadership must position themselves and their organizations to receive the highest possible reimbursement-- contributing to a higher quality of care.\n\nModerator: Mark Hagland, Editor-in-Chief, Healthcare Informatics\n\nRobert Schwartz, MD, Principal, Chartis Group\n\nNirav Vakharia, MD, Vicechair - Population Health, Cleveland Clinic\n\nNiam Yaraghi, Ph.D., Fellow, The Brookings Institution\n\nForum-Style Panel Discussion\n\nManaging the HIE Relationship: Navigating the Data Exchange Partnership\n\nRegional health information exchanges (HIEs) have seen both a significant rise and fall in adoption and partnership rates across the country, and with providers, their needs, and with new system partnerships, meaningful data exchanges are a moving target.\n\nWill FHIR and APIs help exchange collaborations? Are operational state health information exchanges on the decline? What should organizations know to maintain a meaningful and effective partnership? In this guided, interactive, forum-style panel session, all of the burning questions are asked and answered as our executive panel addresses their journey and collaborations with HIEs and what to know to maintain a long-lasting and meaningful partnership.\n\nModerator:\n\nMark Hagland, Editor-in-Chief, Healthcare Informatics\n\nSallie Arnett, Vice President, Information Technology, Chief Information Officer, Licking Memorial Health Systems\n\nDavid Kaelber, MD, PhD, MPH, Internist and Pediatrician, Chief Medical Informatics Officer and Vice-President of Health Informatics, MetroHealth System\n\nDan Paoletti, Chief Executive Officer, CliniSync / Ohio Health Information Partnership\n\nJason Buckner, Senior Vice President, Informatics, The Health Collaborative\n\nT2 Talk\n\nApplying Healthcare Analytics to Change Provider Behavior​\n\nHealthcare institutions obtain a large amount of data on care provided to patients. Many times this data is used for process improvement and rarely to change provider behavior. However, connecting good data to a bonus plan can be a motivating force to change behavior.\n\nJoin Dr. Leslie Zun of Mount Sinai Hospital, for a discussion focusing not only on the means to correlate the data to patient care, but also the means to change and impact behaviors. Data can be linked to develop a successful provider bonus program, and data needs to be monitored to ensure changes and accountability. A model of the development and successful use of data as part of a provider bonus program will be illustrate the points made in the presentation. This session will highlight a real world example of the success of increasing physician compliance with order set utilization by connecting it to a bonus plan-- ultimately influencing outcomes for a better quality of care.\n\nLeslie Zun, MD, MBA, System Chair - Emergency Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital\n\nNetworking Lunch and Panel Discussion\n\nA Deeper Dive: Understanding the Next Generation of Cybersecurity Threats\n\nRecent developments, including the ransomware-based hijacking of the entire clinical information system architecture of a major health system based in Phoenix, are throwing a spotlight on the emerging, intensifying threat of direct hacks of EHR and HIS systems in hospitals and health systems. In this deeper-dive session, healthcare IT leaders will look at where the core threats are coming from and what CIOs, CISOs, and other healthcare IT senior leaders in patient care organizations need to do to protect their organizations, their patients, and the data of both.\n\nFrom ransomware variants like Locky and CryptoLocker to polymorphic trojan viruses like the Shifu Trojan, attendees will leave the session with a clearer understanding of the next generation of hacker threats impacting the current healthcare environment, and those lurking on the horizon. Discover the issues that CIOs, CISOs, and other healthcare IT leaders need to address and tackle to build a risk management and emergency protocol to quickly address these advanced threats and minimize downtime.\n\nModerator:\n\nMatthew Junod, JD, CISM, CISSP, Chief Information Security Officer, University of Toledo\n\nKevin Mooney, Esq., Sr. Director of Enterprise Data Governance, Cleveland Clinic\n\nPamela Banchy, RN-BC, PMP, CHCIO, CIO and VP of Clinical Informatics, Western Reserve Hospital - Western Reserve Health System\n\nBryan P. Smith, Supervisory Special Agent,FBI - Cleveland Division\n\nKaren Martinko, IT Security Manager, MetroHealth Systems\n\nJim Rice, DM/IST, Research Fellow, University of Phoenix, Head of Security Consulting Services, Sirius Computer Solutions\n\nPresentation\n\nChanging the Enterprise from the Data Up: Exploring Data Governance and Business Intelligence Initiatives at the Cleveland Clinic\n\nThe quality of data delivered to make decisions at a business and clinical level is of the utmost importance for today's providers-- at the Cleveland Clinic, the story has been ever-evolving.\n\nOriginally, business intelligence and analytics group at the Cleveland Clinic relied heavily upon hospital management dashboards, created to paint a picture of efficiency, efficacy of programs, and cost. But as key stakeholders in IT know, this was just the beginning, and the evolution-- years in the making.\n\nJoin two top minds from the Cleveland Clinic, as they describe the data governance, strategy and approach to providing high quality data quickly in the fast-paced environment of the Cleveland Clinic. Listen in as we delve into the business case that was made, how this data was monitored over time, how context was provided around this data to show value, and how information is being delivered beyond the walls of the IT or Analytics department to progress operations at the Cleveland Clinic forward.\n\nAndrew Proctor, Senior Director- Business Intelligence, Cleveland Clinic\n\nChristopher Donovan, Executive Director of Enterprise Information Management & Analytics, Cleveland Clinic\n\nT2 Talk\n\nKeys to Repelling Ransomware\n\nYour screen freezes. A dialogue box pops up. It says that your computer is locked, and your files will all be gone forever … unless you pay up.\n\nSince many victims are willing to pay the ransom, this type of cryptomalware continues to rise, netting millions of dollars for cybercriminals looking for a substantial return on their minimal investment.\n\nDuring this session, Kaspersky Lab’s Brent Graham will take you behind the front lines of cybersecurity to provide insights into this growing area of focus for vendors and cybercriminals alike.\n\nAreas of focus:\n\nAwareness of common ransomware scenarios and delivery mechanisms\n\nRansomware trends you need to know—before it’s too late\n\nWays you can avoid becoming ransomware’s next victim\n\nBrent Graham, Manager, Field Marketing, Kaspersky Lab North America\n\nForum-Style Panel Session\n\nAutomating and Stratifying Risk Through Effective Population Health Registries\n\nIn an era focused upon value, the term \"population health registry\" is certainly a vision providers are building upon. As wellness initiatives and the need for data surrounding at-risk patients on the rise, registries provide visibility into potential risk factors in patients with chronic conditions (heart disease, diabetes, etc.) and can create a priority for care management teams to emphasize follow up with these patients. However, for the maturing PHM program, the cost to maintain accuracy, reliability of data for physicians, and frustrations with workflow have all become key issues.\n\nIn this session, join our expert panel as we examine the current state of the population health registry, and the best practices to turn these registries into a powerful and meaningful PHM tool. Find out how organizations are introducing action automations, leveraging risk stratification, and grooming data for in-depth analytics to produce viable insights.\n\nModerator: Greg Rosencrance, MD FACP, Chairman, Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic\n\nNabil Chehade, MD, Senior Vice President of Population Health, MetroHealth System\n\nJustin Pestrue, MA, Administrative Director of Quality Analytics, University of Michigan Health\n\nAmber Gregg, MS, Director of Analytics and Innovation, CHAMPS Oncology\n\nEric Widen, President and CEO, HBI Solutions, Inc.\n\nPresentation\n\nHealth IT's Role in Combating the Zika and Ebola Menaces: What Providers Can Take Away from Public Health Emergencies\n\nThe reality of today's healthcare environment: The biggest tool in fighting the outbreak of deadly superviruses like Zika and Ebola, is data.\n\nIn a joint collaboration with the CDC, ONC is actively working to combat these public health emergencies by leveraging patient and population health trends data. By building an infrastructure, leveraging ever-changing and diverse vocabulary sets, and bringing together automated functionality for these initiatives, ONC is assembling a data set to study, detect, and respond to emerging public health threats. Yet, how is ONC addressing the challenges of interoperability, application of analytics tools, and perhaps most critically-- adapting these changes into the clinical workflow for partnering organizations?\n\nIn this engaging session, join James Daniel, Public Health Coordinator with the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC), as he outlines the lessons learned and best practices that CIOs and their teams should consider from this government program. Hear about the interoperability practices, workflows, and strategic oversight that providers can leverage to improve their own population health initiatives, and participate in the war against the supervirus.\n\nFloyd Eisenberg, MD, MPH, Transitional Vocabulary Task Force, Co-Chair, Health IT Standards Committee, Member, Public Health Task Force, Member\n\nKeynote Session\n\nBeating the MSSP Expectations: How Innovation Care Partners' ACO Has Thrived\n\nIn an era where accountable care organizations (ACOs) participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) are struggling mightily to meet expectations, only a choice few have thrived-- and Innovation Care Partners has been at the center of this, through innovation.\n\nInnovation Care Partners (formerly Scottsdale Health Partners) started their MSSP in 2014, their first performance year. Since then, they've saved $9.5 million against a total of 18,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 2015. For this 2015 performance year, Innovation Care Partners will receive a $4.5 million check.\n\nHow have they done it? Find out first hand, as nationally renowned speaker and Chief Medical Officer of Innovation Care Partners, Dr. Jim Whitfill, takes you behind the scenes with just how this feat was accomplished through significant IT innovations. Learn tools and strategies for pushing the envelope and positioning your organization for top-notch performance year.\n\nKeynote Speaker:\n\nT2 Talk\n\nEffectively Using Sociodemographic Data in Healthcare Analytics\n\nIndividual patient factors such as race, gender, age, income and employment along with a host of other sociodemographic indicators are known to play a large role in healthcare utilization and outcomes. These factors are used in patient mix adjustment methods, risk profiling algorithms and population health strategies across the country. While there is broad understanding at a public health level about how these influences impact communities and larger populations there is less thought or strategy around how to effectively employ this information at a health system or provider level. In this presentation we will discuss the opportunities and challenges to use sociodemographic indicators more effectively in a health system’s analytic efforts.\n\nWe will present both use cases and future directions for this critical dataspace. From data model design to advanced analytic methods and interpretation there exists tremendous value inherent in these factors if organizations can effectively navigate the associated risks.\n\nJustin Pestrue, MA, Administrative Director of Quality Analytics, University of Michigan Health\n\nT2 Talk\n\nAutomating Quality: The Advanced Metrics, Data, and Strategy Behind the Paperless ED\n\nAutomating healthcare delivery can be challenging in any setting, but especially in the Emergency Department. Having a single electronic medical record is critical to the care of patients at Western Reserve Hospital as over 50% of our inpatient admissions start in the emergency department.\n\nThrough technology, a dedicated clinical leadership team and a collaborative relationship with Information Technology & Services team, Western Reserve Hospital has been able to successfully implement all aspects of care delivery while maintaining and improving quality measures for our patients.\n\nAttend this session and learn how people, process and technology contributed to improving the patient experience at Western Reserve Health System.\n\nPamela Banchy, RN-BC, PMP, CHCIO, CIO and VP of Clinical Informatics, Western Reserve Hospital - Western Reserve Health System\n\nPresentation\n\nBuilding Integrated Clinical Dashboards Using FHIR\n\nFHIR is a rapidly evolving, dynamic standard for access to data in electronic health records (EHR). FHIR is typically associated with specific value-added functionality that individual EHRs do not provide. However, it also offers the opportunity to connect data for the same patient from different sources. As such, it can be a valuable \"on-demand\" form of health information exchange, provided the right infrastructure exists.\n\nRecently, the Regenstrief Institute piloted FHIR to connect data from the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) with those in an Epic installation. In one use case, we retrieved medication lists for patients from both information sources and designed a patient-centric medication reconciliation application. Importantly, a pre-existing, INPC-specific universal patient identifier obviated the need to perform patient matching.\n\nThis use case highlights the potential for FHIR to aggregate information from different sources into a patient-centric electronic health record.\n\nTitus K.

Time matters when dealing with this medical emergency. Sepsis requires urgent attention and rapid treatment for survival to occur. Studies show that for every one hour of delay in treating sepsis, the patient’s risk of death increases by 8%. A single 12-hour shift of a patient going untreated due to a lack of recognition increases a patient’s mortality risk by 96%. However, early recognition and treatment have been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this dangerous condition.\n\nRecognizing and diagnosing sepsis is challenging as there is no single sign or symptom of sepsis. Sepsis is a combination of factors that often occur over a period of time. Doctors diagnose sepsis using a number of physical findings as well as lab tests that check for signs of infection and organ damage. Many of the signs and symptoms of sepsis are the same as in other conditions, making sepsis difficult to diagnose in its early stages. Recognizing and diagnosing sepsis is unquestionably a serious matter. In many cases, an early or expedited response from the clinical team can prevent severe sepsis and, subsequently, septic shock from occurring.\n\nOne of the most efficient and effective methods to assist physicians in identifying sepsis is through a data driven approach. By aggregating and trending key data elements collected from a single patient over a period of hours, key clinical team members can act quickly and make informed decisions in the best interest of each patient to identify and treat sepsis.\n\nIn this engaging lunch presentation, hear from Sallie Arnett of Licking Memorial Health Systems, as she describes in depth how their clinical systems interact, monitor, and alert physicians to patients identified as a high-risk for sepsis. Through collaboration and interdisciplinary efforts, Licking Memorial has improved outcomes and mortality rates at their hospital--stemming the tide and risk of sepsis across their organization.\n\nSallie Arnett, Vice President, Information Technology, Chief Information Officer, Licking Memorial Health Systems\n\nT2 Talk\n\nImaging IT and Healthcare IT Interoperability\n\nIn this ever-changing world of healthcare IT, imaging has historically not been much of a factor. For various reasons, imaging IT has grown separately, largely through the advent and growth of PACS (Picture Archive and Communications Systems), and driven by the digitization of various imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI, and Digital Radiography.\n\nAs more imaging service lines throughout the service provider have gone digital, imaging IT has been forced to address commonality in the areas of image management and visualization. Now, with the advent of Population Health Management and Value-Based Care, the importance of imaging is once again under scrutiny. This discussion will focus on why imaging is important, why providers need to take it into account when strategizing healthcare IT strategies, and how imaging can become an integral part of healthcare IT.\n\nUsers will learn:\n\nThe driving forces behind PACS and imaging IT\n\nThe importance of emerging Enterprise imaging needs, and emerging technologies\n\nThe value of including imaging in Population Health Management-driven initiatives\n\nScenarios for implementation of imaging IT\n\nThe benefits of imaging IT and healthcare IT interoperability\n\nJoseph Marion, Principal, Healthcare Integration Strategies, LLC"
