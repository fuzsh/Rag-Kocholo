        "text": "This product has been replaced with our new plans: Kaspersky Standard, Kaspersky Plus, and Kaspersky Premium.\n\nUsing the same award-winning antivirus protection trusted and loved by over 400 million users, our new plans are available in a range of device / year options and are cross-OS compatible. Learn more about their advanced privacy and identity features here.\n\nThere are many antivirus options available, but Kaspersky is trusted by millions of users worldwide and our security plans have been consistently ranked as the best antivirus programs on the market. Our new security plans provide advanced security features, such as multiple layers of protection against various threats, real-time scanning, and frequent updates to keep your devices secure.\n\nKaspersky’s advanced security plans also include features such as a password manager and a VPN, providing additional layers of protection for your online activities.\n\nAntivirus software can sometimes slow down your computer due to the resources it uses to scan and detect potential threats. However, Kaspersky’s new security plans are designed to minimise the impact on system resources to prevent any significant slowdowns while still providing advanced protection against online threats.\n\nAdditionally, Kaspersky’s security software has a range of customisation options, allowing you to adjust scan settings and performance levels to find a balance between security and system performance.\n\nAntivirus programs can provide some protection against zero-day vulnerabilities by detecting and blocking previously unseen attacks.\n\nHowever, zero-day vulnerabilities refer to security holes that are unknown to the developer, making it difficult for antivirus software to prevent them entirely. Kaspersky’s security plans utilise behaviour-based detection techniques and advanced security measures to identify malicious activity and prevent attacks, providing an added layer of protection against zero-day threats.\n\nWhile no single security solution can fully protect against all risks, Kaspersky’s new plans are highly effective against a wide range of online threats, including zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\nAntivirus and anti-malware software are both designed to protect your computer from online threats, but they differ in terms of their scope of protection. Antivirus software is primarily focused on preventing viruses, worms, and other forms of malware from infecting your computer, while anti-malware software is designed to detect and remove a wider range of online threats, including viruses, spyware, Trojans, adware, and more.\n\nKaspersky’s security plans offer advanced protection against all types of online threats, providing comprehensive security for your devices and sensitive data."
