        "text": "Social Engineering and Phishing\n\nHofstra has been experiencing a large number of phishing emails that use âSocial Engineeringâ to get Hofstra employees to open attachments or click on links. The trend is now to target a single individual and create an email that will be of interest to that person. Opening the attachment or clicking on the link can either install malware on your machine or bring you to a fake login page.\n\nSome of the recent phishing emails we have seen include:\n\nCyber warfare is around the world\n\nItâs like a world war on an immense, digital, lightning-fast scale, and we want you to be prepared and safe. Norse Corp, an American cybersecurity company, hosts a world map that displays cyber attacks in real time. Some of these attacks are state-sponsored while others initiated by organized crime, or set off by hard to trace individuals. You can see the map here: https://threatmap.bitdefender.com/ and another here: http://cybermap.kaspersky.com.\n\nImage\n\nHofstra IT wants to do what it can to educate you on how to defend yourself and take a stand against these kinds of threats. The internet is an invaluable resource, but it can be a dangerous one to navigate without the right knowledge.\n\nComputer Software Can Hurt or Help\n\nYour computers (desktops, laptops, tablets, etc.) need frequent checkups!\n\nUp to date software is your computerâs immune system, defending you from infection of malware. Both Macs and PCs can get malware, a general term for malicious software. There are several ways to fix this.\n\nKeep your Operating System up to date. Windows XP, for example, has been around for a long time and is less secure than Windows 8. Mac OS X Snow Leopard is less secure than Mac OS X Yosemite. Consider upgrading your Operating System as this is the foundation of your computer software and enable any auto-update options built into those systems. In addition, consider the following:\n\nUse an Antivirus program. There are several good, free antivirus programs available, including Avast and AVG\n\nScan for Malware.Trustworthy, and free, scanners such as Malwarebytes can identify and remove insidious bits of software hiding among your legitimately installed applications. Malware is often installed totally without your consent when you visit sites on the web or click ânext-next-nextâ when installing free software from a questionable publisher. Clicking âuntil the windows go awayâ because you canât be bothered to read the content is like signing a contract without reading a word of it. âIâm sure itâs fine.â Itâs not."
