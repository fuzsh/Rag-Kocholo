        "text": "Endpoint security software company Kaspersky has acquired Brain4Net, a software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) solutions provider. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThis is technology M&A deal number 692 that MSSP Alert and sister site ChannelE2E have covered so far in 2021.\n\nBrain4Net has 18 employees listed on LinkedIn. The company has raised $8.6 million in funding through 2019. Also, Brain4Net provides a partner program for service providers and systems integrators. The program lets partners leverage Brain4Net's platform to help their customers leverage SDN and NFV technologies.\n\nBrain4Net's technology will allow Kaspersky to deliver a secure access service edge (SASE) that will encompass several security services, such as:\n\nIn addition, Kaspersky will use Brain4Net to deliver a new eXtended detection and response (XDR) offering, the buyer said. The offering will allow organizations to manage and protect networks, servers, virtual machines and other entry points for threats.\n\nKaspersky also will combine its security solutions and technologies with Brain4Net's network orchestration and control capabilities and expertise, the company stated. This will allow Kaspersky to deliver both security and connectivity services.\n\nKaspersky, Diplo Foundation Launch Cybersecurity Training Game\n\nThe Brain4Net acquisition comes after Kaspersky in October 2021 partnered with DiploFoundation, a Swiss-Maltese nonprofit educational organization that specializes in internet governance and digital policy, to develop an online cybersecurity training game. Diplomats and non-technical cyber professionals can use the game to learn about cyberattacks and how to respond to them.\n\nKaspersky provides security solutions and services to over 400 million users worldwide, though the company has faced scrutiny in the United States. Indeed, U.S. federal government agencies are not permitted to run Kaspersky's software because of potential ties to Russia's government. Kaspersky has repeatedly denied the accusation."
