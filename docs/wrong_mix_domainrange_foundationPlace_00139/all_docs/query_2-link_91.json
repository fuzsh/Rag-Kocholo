        "text": "By Byron V. Acohido\n\nIn our digital age, managing passwords effectively is crucial not just for our security while we’re alive, but also for ensuring our digital legacies are secure after we’re gone.\n\nA recent study by All About Cookies sheds light on the alarming lack of preparation most internet users have for their digital assets.\n\nThe All About Cookies study surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults to understand how prepared Americans are to pass on their digital inheritances. The results revealed that 67 percent of respondents have a plan to share banking account information, but only 24 percent include online account details in their wills.\n\nFurthermore, only 30 percent of people in relationships say their partner could easily access their online accounts in the event of their death. This indicates a significant gap in planning for digital assets compared to physical ones. Here are the key findings\n\n•Digital Asset Planning is Inadequate: While 65 percent of people have a will, only a quarter include information about their online accounts. This omission could leave families struggling to access essential digital information during an already difficult time.\n\n•Storing Passwords in Memory: An astonishing 39 percent of respondents store their digital information in their heads, which poses two significant risks: the potential loss of access if something happens to the individual and the increased likelihood of using simple, easily hackable passwords.\n\n•Lack of Sharing Credentials: Only 42 percent of people share login credentials with their spouse, and 34 percent haven’t shared their digital assets with anyone. This leaves many accounts vulnerable to being lost or inaccessible after death.\n\n•Unaccounted Online Assets: Half of the respondents have money in online accounts that their spouses are unaware of, with a median value of $8,000. This underscores the financial risks associated with inadequate digital asset planning.\n\nBest practice guidance\n\nGiven these insights, here are some best practices for securing your passwords and ensuring your digital legacy is well-managed:\n\n•Consider using a password manager: Instead of relying on memory, use a reputable password manager. These tools not only help generate and store complex passwords but also often include features for designating digital heirs. This ensures that your passwords and important information are accessible to your loved ones when needed.\n\n•Regularly update your will: Ensure that your will includes detailed instructions for accessing your digital assets. This should encompass banking information, social media accounts, investment portfolios, and any other significant online presence. Regular updates will keep this information current and comprehensive.\n\n•Share information securely: Discuss your digital asset plans with a trusted individual, whether it’s a spouse, family member, or attorney. Sharing this information securely ensures that your accounts can be managed in your absence without unnecessary complications.\n\n•Educate yourself and others: Make use of resources that help you understand digital asset management. For older adults, guides like “The Best Password Managers For Seniors” can be particularly useful. Educating yourself and your loved ones on these tools will enhance overall security.\n\n•Plan for all digital assets: Do not overlook any accounts. While banking and investment accounts are critical, also consider utilities, social media, email, and any other services you use regularly. Ensuring these are part of your digital plan will prevent any oversight.\n\n•Consider professional advice: If you’re unsure where to start, seek professional advice. Experts in digital security and estate planning can provide tailored recommendations that suit your specific situation and needs.\n\nThe All About Cookies study highlights a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of our digital lives—planning for the security and transfer of our digital assets. The big takeaway here is all too familiar.\n\nThis is yet more evidence that each one of us, as individual consumers, continue to carry a big burden for protecting and preserving every aspect of our digital lives, more so than ever and in so many different ways. There is potentially a ton of value in digital legacies. For one thing, thanks to the way we now collect all data, it is possible for future generations accesse details of how their forbearers lived their lives.\n\nSomething to ponder. I’ll keep watch and keep reporting.\n\nAcohido\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning business journalist Byron V.
