        "text": "Kaspersky and Bitdefender are established leaders in the antivirus world, although they may not be as well known to many consumers as providers such as Norton and McAfee. In this comparison, I will give you all the background information you need to know and take a look at the numbers behind each program’s performance and effectiveness against malware.\n\nI will be delving into the important things to consider before purchasing your antivirus software. I will compare the effectiveness of malware protection, PC performance, and the overall usability of the software. The comparable plans will be Kaspersky Total Protection and Bitdefender Premium Security, both excellent antivirus software for a novice or more technically savvy user.\n\nWant the short version? Who wins between Kaspersky and Bitdefender?\n\nBitdefender is my winner. It has superb protection against malware and other online threats, with minimal impact on my PC performance. It also has many added features such as secure data encryption and enhanced identity theft protection, plus the setup is simple and easy.\n\nHere’s what I found out when comparing Kaspersky to Bitdefender:\n\nSummary\n\nKaspersky\n\nPrivacy and identity theft protection\n\nEncrypted Browser\n\nFile Protection\n\nBitdefender\n\nMulti-layer Ransomware Protection\n\nUnlimited and secure VPN\n\nAdvanced Parental Controls\n\nBackground\n\nKaspersky\n\nKaspersky is one of the world’s largest privately-owned cybersecurity companies, with over 4,000 specialists working on online safety products. It operates in 200 countries and territories around the world and protects 400 million users worldwide. Endpoint security has always been the core of Kaspersky, and the company expects its future growth to be in the enterprise market. Kaspersky is constantly expanding its enterprise portfolio with security solutions and services to provide the best protection. Some experts are wary of Kaspersky due to its alleged links with the Russian government, although the company’s founder recently responded by saying there is no foundation for the claims made against Kaspersky by the U.S. Government.\n\nBitdefender\n\nBitdefender is a Romanian cybersecurity company and was founded in 2001. It protects half a billion users worldwide and it also works with government organizations, SMEs and private individuals across 150 countries. Bitdefender employs over 1600 people and is one of the most innovative IT security software vendors in the world today.\n\nPricing and Compatibility\n\nThe price of an antivirus program is one of the top points to consider for most consumers. Antivirus programs are an investment, especially if you opt for a more premium package. Bitdefender and Kaspersky are quite different in their pricing. For Kaspersky Total Security you will pay $89.99 to protect five devices, whereas Bitdefender Premium Security is $159.99 for ten devices. Both of these plans offer protection for a year, after which you can decide whether to renew.\n\nKaspersky offers a free basic antivirus software to protect against the core threats online, whereas Bitdefender has no free offering. The table below outlines the different packages and prices that both Kaspersky and Bitdefender offer.\n\nMany programs offer discounts for your first year. Kaspersky and Bitdefender are no different. Bitdefender offers $110 off your first year, making Bitdefender Premium Security $49.99. Kaspersky offers a savings of 70%, making your first year of Total Security $49.99.\n\nWhat happens if you’re not satisfied with your product? Both companies offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you are not happy with your product. It gives you the peace of mind of being able to test out the software and interface first.\n\nBoth Kaspersky and Bitdefender work with all the major operating systems, which include, Windows, MacOS, and Android devices.\n\nEffectiveness against malware\n\nThe most important thing about antivirus programs is protection. It’s important to choose one that provides all-round security when using your PC, whether for work or leisure. As digital threats become more and more sophisticated, it’s imperative to choose an antivirus with strong protection.\n\nTo find out which one came out on top in terms of protection, I ran a test to check for malware threats in real-time. The next step I took was to download sample malware files from The European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR). To decide how well the malware was detected, I turned off real-time detection and ran a full system scan and also a quick scan. The results are in the table below.\n\nAs you can see from the table, both Kaspersky and Bitdefender excelled in blocking and detecting the threats.\n\nBoth programs blocked all of the EICAR samples. The live samples were also blocked by Bitdefender. For Kaspersky, all live samples were deleted after unlocking and unzipping.\n\nFrom my tests, both programs detected, blocked, and deleted the samples efficiently.\n\nTo see if my results were accurate and to add more depth, I looked at some of the latest test results from some leading independent analysts: AV-Test and AV-Comparatives.\n\nThe first from AV Test looks at protection rates against malware attacks, inclusive of web and email threats. During March and April 2020, Bitdefender scored 100%. Kaspersky received a 100% score in March and 99% in April.\n\nNext, I looked at AV-Comparatives latest Malware Protection test from September 2019. Bitdefender scored 99.5% and Kaspersky 99.9%.\n\nAV-Comparatives false alarm test is also a useful tool in determining how many false positives occur when the antivirus program flags a non-malware file as malware. This can be extremely irritating for the user, resulting in false notifications and even preventing legitimate programs from running. In this test from September 2019, Bitdefender showed seven false alarms whilst Kaspersky showed zero.\n\nTo sum up, both Kaspersky and Bitdefender score very well in regards to protection rates, both in my own tests and the ones run independently by leading websites. As Kaspersky flagged zero false alarms, it edges out Bitdefender in detection rates.\n\nSee also: Common types of Malware explained\n\nImpact on PC Performance\n\nMost antivirus programs are relatively large pieces of software installed on your PC, so they can affect your PC’s performance when running scans in the background. To decipher which one is less impactful on my PC’s performance, I ran a number of tests and captured some data while running both a full scan and a quick scan.\n\nThe table below shows my findings for both the full scan and quick scan.\n\nTo sum up the findings, a full scan with Kaspersky took 227 minutes while Bitdefender took 110 minutes. However, Kaspersky only took 273 seconds for the quick scan while Bitdefender took 338 seconds.\n\nThe table also sums up the impact the scans had on my PC performance.\n\nThe findings in the table show that Bitdefender had lower CPU utilization at 32% when there was no scan running, compared to Kaspersky at 46%. The full scan utilization also showed similar results with Kaspersky recording 100% and Bitdefender 56%.\n\nAs with the malware protection test, I took a look at some more independent tests from the AV-Comparatives website to determine if my findings were similar to these benchmarking results. The test run by AV-Comparatives shows how each antivirus impacts on PC performance during eight common tasks:\n\nDownloading files\n\nBrowsing Websites\n\nFile Copying: First and subsequent run\n\nInstalling/uninstalling applications\n\nArchiving / unarchiving\n\nLaunching applications: First and subsequent run\n\nEach task is given a rating ranging between very fast and slow. In October 2019 Performance Test, Bitdefender and Kaspersky scored very fast in tests for all common tasks.\n\nBoth Kaspersky and Bitdefender are similar in performance and cannot be at all differentiated in AV Comparatives’ results. My own tests indicated Kaspersky was slightly faster and more responsive of the two programs.\n\nFeatures\n\nAs Bitdefender and Kaspersky have similar comparability in protection and performance, let’s take a look at the features both have to offer. Many antivirus programs come with an abundance of features to make them more appealing to potential customers. Below I have outlined the extra features of each program.\n\nKaspersky\n\nDefends against viruses, ransomware & more\n\nProtects without slowing you down\n\nEasy to set up and use\n\nPC Mac and Mobile\n\nBlocks phishing\n\nEncrypted browser\n\nSafe Kids\n\nPassword Manager\n\nFile Protection\n\nBitdefender\n\nUnlimited VPN traffic\n\nPriority Support\n\nDevice Optimiser\n\nWindows, macOS, Android and iOS protection\n\nParental Control\n\nMulti-layer ransomware protection\n\nProtection against malware, spyware, adware\n\nBoth programs offer some interesting features that users would benefit from. Below I have highlighted some key ones that might persuade you into purchasing each program.\n\nKaspersky\n\nSafe Kids Parental Controls – Includes ‘bad content’ blocker, GPS tracker, and more on PC, Mac & mobile. You will be able to easily manage and regulate your child’s activities online and check reports easily via your account.

Luckily, most programs are simple to sign up and install and Kaspersky and Bitdefender are no different. Both programs clearly highlight their discounts and price above the ‘Buy Now’ button on their website.\n\nKaspersky greets you with a pop-up window to upgrade to more devices, which is a handy reminder to make sure all your devices are protected, but could annoy some users.\n\nBoth programs have automatic renewal toggled on by default, so if you do not wish to renew the following year, switch this to off to avoid automatic renewal. Both programs only took a few minutes to go from purchase to installation.\n\nHow easy is the interface to use?\n\nBoth programs’ dashboards are clean and simple. When opening the dashboard for Bitdefender, you will be greeted by a ‘You are safe’ slogan. It also has the usual overview of your device and protection, privacy, and utilities section. There is also a section for you to share your suggestions and things you would like to see in any future updates.\n\nSimilarly, Kaspersky’s dashboard will give you a green check to let you know that everything is running accordingly. There are also common tools that you may need such as scan, database update, safe money, privacy protection, password manager, backup and restore, and parental control. This makes it really easy to navigate to the right section. The design is fairly simple, with a light grey and green color scheme.\n\nCustomer Support\n\nHaving reliable customer support is important when purchasing antivirus software. Having someone on hand to answer any questions or resolve problems gives you peace of mind for any future problems that may arise. Below is a brief summary of Kaspersky and Bitdefender’s customer support.\n\nKaspersky\n\nKaspersky technicians are on call via phone between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 a.m., seven days a week. Customer support is also available via email or online chat. There are also extensive videos, FAQs and other useful information you can find on its website if you do not wish to speak to someone directly.\n\nBitdefender\n\nBitdefender Premium Security offers an extensive support hub, with many common problems answered on its website or shown through online videos, which is great if you want an easy fix. If this is not doable, you can contact support via email, phone call, online chat, or through the expert community forum. Bitdefender is available to answer any questions 24/7, giving you that peace of mind if something goes wrong.\n\nWhich antivirus is more user-friendly?\n\nWhen it comes to user-friendliness, both Kaspersky and Bitdefender offer clean and simple dashboards that are a breeze to navigate. Both programs are a cinch to install and set up, with automatic renewal toggled on by default. However, Bitdefender’s interface is noted for being particularly clean and straightforward, which might give it a slight edge in user-friendliness.\n\nWhich antivirus has better speed and performance?\n\nIn terms of speed and performance, Bitdefender outshines Kaspersky. During tests, Bitdefender completed a full scan in 110 minutes compared to Kaspersky’s 227 minutes. For quick scans, Kaspersky was faster at 273 seconds versus Bitdefender’s 338 seconds. However, Bitdefender had lower CPU utilization during both full and quick scans, indicating a lesser impact on system performance.\n\nWhich antivirus offers better user privacy?\n\nRegarding user privacy, Kaspersky and Bitdefender both offer robust features that ensure your personal data is well-protected. However, Kaspersky’s zero false alarms in independent tests and its extensive privacy tools make it a slightly better option for users prioritizing privacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nKaspersky and Bitdefender rank fairly similarly in terms of protection and performance, with results being difficult to differentiate in my own tests and the independent tests done by AV-Test and AV-Comparatives.\n\nThey differ in the plans and pricing, with Bitdefender offering a great range of discounts for new sign-ups. Bitdefender is also much lighter than Kaspersky on system resources, and it was rapid to detect every malware samples I tested it with.\n\nOne of the most enticing features of Bitdefender is its unlimited VPN inclusion, which helps to protect your privacy as your browse, stream, and download on the web. It also includes a file shredder that wipes all traces of specified data from your system and performance optimizations that speed up your device.\n\nBitdefender is the better option for customer support, with a broader range of support options and availability 24/7. Its interface is clean and straightforward to use, and its money-back guarantee is easy to take advantage of, with refunds processed via live chat.\n\nSee also:"
