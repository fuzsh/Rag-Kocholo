        "text": "The innovative Kaspersky Security System platform is a dedicated solution designed to ensure the safety of information systems that demand enhanced security. It is available as an embeddable OEM component to manufacturers and vendors of comprehensive IT solutions. Examples of such solutions include ERP and electronic document management systems, smart grids, the Internet of Things or even critical infrastructure. At the global Embedded World industrial exhibition in Nuremberg, Kaspersky Lab and SYSGO showcased a security solution for safety-critical tasks which embeds the Kaspersky Security System within the real-time operating system PikeOS.\n\nSYSGO and Kaspersky Lab have announced the result of their partnership on integration of the new platform into the real-time operating system, PikeOS. Combined with PikeOS, Kaspersky Security System ensures that performed communications comply with security policies. It can be used in industrial systems to protect devices at the supervisory and control (SCADA) level, in connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to assure their proper behavior, and in automotive systems to separate the safety-critical subsystems from infotainment components connected to Internet, among others. While in operation, Kaspersky Security System does not impact the real-time performance of applications managing physical processes, making full use of the PikeOS hypervisor architecture. The solution created by the two organizations provides embedded security and allows organizations to retain and reuse existing certification artifacts.\n\n\"By teaming up with Kaspersky Lab we bring IT security to embedded systems,\" said Knut Degen, CEO of SYSGO. \"With the integration of Kaspersky Security System into PikeOS we can deliver a high-performance solution that will help our joint customers to secure their devices in the Internet of Things.\"\n\nKaspersky Security System’s key features include its ability to apply access control rules according to given security policy, classify the informational resources and configure the interaction of the components.\n\n“An analysis of the evolution of trends in cybercrime suggests that any information system without a trusted infosecurity module poses a threat to the security and integrity of business processes, and may potentially lead to serious consequences. This is what drives our team to continuously improve our IT security knowledge and solutions. With this new product, we help our partners make their IT systems more trusted and reliable without affecting their safety,” said Andrey Doukhvalov, Head of Future Technologies, Chief Strategy Architect at Kaspersky Lab. “Kaspersky Security System is a platform with a unique component makeup and feature set. It ensures the required level of cybersecurity for any IT system with demanding security requirements.”\n\nKaspersky Security System is delivered as an OEM component designed to integrate into information systems, and is suitable for use by software and hardware vendors, as well as system integrators. With Kaspersky Security System, the vendor or integrator can apply basic, default security policies or manually fine-tune their security configurations to meet the requirements presented by specific systems or business tasks.\n\nAs part of a global initiative to ensure the information security of critical infrastructure objects, Kaspersky Lab is working to create a suite of technologies and services. This includes Kaspersky Security System, a secure operating system, and other components to cover all levels of industrial automation. All these components are fully compatible with each other; and when used in combination, they offer the client the most effective protection for technology infrastructures.\n\nFor more information about Kaspersky Security System, please follow this link.\n\nAbout PikeOS\n\nPikeOS is a hypervisor intended for embedded systems with safety and security requirements. It is certified to highest safety and security standards such as DO-178B or IEC-61508. With real-time, virtualization and partitioning, it provides all the features needed to build today’s multi-functional and highly-integrated devices. The PikeOS architecture creates a foundation for critical systems allowing official approval by the authorities regarding safety and security standards. PikeOS is the only European software platform for smart devices in the Internet-of-Things.\n\nAbout SYSGO"
