        "text": "The company had appealed against the constitutionality of a directive by the Department of Homeland Security and provisions in the National Defence Authorisation Act asking government agencies to stop using its software.\n\nIn December 2017, Kaspersky filed an appeal against a September 2017 ban by the Department of Homeland Security on the use of its products in the public service.\n\nAnd in February this year, the company filed a case against a ban by Congress, codified in the NDAA for the fiscal year 2018, claiming that the ban was unconstitutional.\n\nThe ban took effect on 1 October.\n\nKaspersky's software was banned from use by US public sector agencies last year, following reports that Russia had exploited its software to spy on customers and obtain malware created by the NSA.\n\nReacting to the dismissal of the appeals, Kaspersky chief executive and founder Eugene Kaspersky said: \"The DC Circuit Court’s decision is disappointing, but the events of the past year that culminated in this decision were almost expected, and not just by our company, but by the cyber security industry in general.\n\n\"We’re sure that the issues involved in our litigation go far beyond technical aspects of US constitutional law; they include real-world problems concerning everyone: a progression of protectionism and balkanisation in a world of understated cyber-rivalry and highly sophisticated international cyber threats.\""
