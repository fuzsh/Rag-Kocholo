        "text": "What happened to my listing?\n\nIf your listing was removed based on a VeRO report, eBay sent you an email with details about why your listing was reported and how to contact the rights owner directly for more information. If you have concerns or questions about why your listing was removed, please contact the rights owner directly.\n\nContact us in the following circumstances\n\nYou can’t find the rights owner’s email address in your removal notification email.\n\nYou emailed the rights owner, but they haven’t replied after 5 business days.\n\nSellers are responsible for ensuring that any item they list on eBay is authentic and that the listing description doesn’t infringe on the rights of others.\n\nExamples of infringements\n\nItems that bear the rights owner’s trademark—such as a logo—but were not authorized by the rights owner.\n\nUnauthorized copies of audio, video, or other media.\n\nUnauthorized use of a rights owner’s images or text in a listing.\n\nTrademark infringement\n\nA trademark is a unique sign (such as a name, word, phrase, logo, or symbol) that a company uses to identify its products or services. For example, eBay is the name of our company, but it’s also a trademark used on our site and on various eBay products. Trademark laws are primarily designed to protect consumers from confusing one company’s goods or services with those of another.\n\nReplica and counterfeit\n\nIt’s illegal to sell counterfeits, fakes, or replicas of brand-name items. We don’t allow these items to be sold on eBay.\n\nExample\n\nItems that weren’t made by the manufacturer but the items are labeled with the brand, like a purse that has a Burberry label on it but wasn’t made by Burberry.\n\nBrand name misuse\n\nYou may not use brand names in your listing if the product isn’t manufactured by or compatible with that brand. You may use \"compatible with,\" \"fits,\" or \"for\" before a brand name if the item you are describing is specifically designed to be compatible with the products of that brand.\n\nExamples\n\nA generic case made for an iPhone uses the brand name \"Apple\".\n\nListing an adidas shoe and adding the brand name \"Nike\".\n\nLogo misuse\n\nIf you include logos in your listing descriptions, make sure you’re authorized to use them. Using someone’s logo without permission is a violation of trademark laws and can be misleading for buyers. Creating a logo that's similar to someone else’s can also be a trademark infringement.\n\nExample\n\nListing a branded item and including logos in your description or images without authorization.\n\nWarranty\n\nListings that contain a misrepresentation regarding an item’s warranty are in violation of trademark laws. Information relating to the warranty of a product is considered material information and should never be misrepresented. You should read the warranty or contact the manufacturer to be sure that the warranty is eligible for a buyer before mentioning it in a listing.\n\nExample\n\nListing a product and including information about the manufacturer's warranty without checking to see if it covers resale of the product.\n\nCopyright infringements\n\nA copyright is the legal protection given to authors of creative works such as movies, music, software, photographs, and books, both published and unpublished. Copyright protection prevents others from using the work without permission.\n\nImage and text\n\nUsing someone else’s image or description without permission could violate copyright laws. If you use text or an image that was created by someone else be sure that you have permission to use the text or image.\n\nExamples\n\nImages or text copied from other websites or internet searches.\n\nStock photos and text used without permission.\n\nScans or text copied from catalogs or advertisements.\n\nMedia, software, movies, paintings\n\nSelling unauthorized copies of media, software, movies, or paintings violates copyright laws. Unauthorized copies include but aren’t limited to backup, pirated, duplicated, or bootlegged copies. Copyright protection prevents others from using creative works without permission. It may also limit the right to distribute the copyrighted product.\n\nExamples\n\nBurning unauthorized copies of movies or music and selling the copies.\n\nOpened software subject to licensing agreements.\n\nCD-Rs or DVD-Rs that include multiple copies of books or images."
