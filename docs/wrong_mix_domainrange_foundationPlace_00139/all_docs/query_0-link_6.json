        "text": "“No, you’ll sleep in my bed.” A simple act of kindness no doubt altered the trajectory of my life. It was the interaction that ultimately led me to choose West Point over Annapolis – and it’s a lesson in how org culture ultimately attracts or repels interested individuals. I was a senior in high school and recruited by both Army and Navy. I hate to admit it now, but Navy had the initial edge. My older brother was my hero growing up, and he played football at USNA’s prep school in Newport, RI. Thus, I was pumped for my Navy recruiting trip. But my host, an upperclassman, kept introducing me to everyone during my visit as his “drag,” Naval Academy slang for a recruit who they had to “drag” around. He was nice enough, but pawned me off on some plebes to entertain me. I felt out-of-place, like a burden. A few weeks later, I went on my West Point recruiting trip. The coaching staff put me up with John DiMuzio, a plebe from NJ, where I’m from. John had a larger-than-life personality and introduced me to ALL his friends – not as his drag - but as “his” recruit. We had a blast at the hockey game despite walking in 14 in. of snow! He couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating. When it was time for bed, I went to lay down in the military cot that was in the room, just like I did during my Navy recruiting trip. “No, you’ll sleep in my bed,” John said. “I got the cot.” At the time (not true now), Navy had a more successful program. Better facilities. Better dorm rooms. Better town, restaurants, and bars (sorry Highland Falls). Better weather. But at West Point, I ran into better people – and that’s what made all the difference. This isn’t a slam of USNA nor a glorification of West Point – no doubt I could’ve had a much different experience during both recruiting trips. But John’s kindness made my decision easy. He’s no longer with us – John passed away in 2018 from brain cancer. But I think of him often, including every time I tell the story of why I chose West Point. Never underestimate the power that a cultural ambassador (or assassin) can have on your organization’s recruitment.\n\nNeed a mental health day? Take the day off. Pet pass away? Take the day off. Lose a family member? Take all the time you need. Having a bad hair day? Kick out early, go get a haircut. Kids sick? Work from home. Take care of your babies. Car break down? Go get it fixed. Check in later. Snow delay? Bad roads? Migraine? Cold? Out of town guests? Kid getting married? You’re getting married? In the grand scheme of things, we are at work for a lot of hours. Missing a few never hurt anyone. The business included. I’ve been known to hear someone sniffle in a Zoom call and I’m telling them to go take a hot shower and have a bowl of soup. Work will still be there when you get back. You aren’t missing anything. But a chance to build a snowman with your kids during the first snowfall of the year? A chance to take care of something urgent? If you want to build loyalty, give people the gift of unexpected grace. #resumewriting #grace #doyouwanttobuildasnowman"
