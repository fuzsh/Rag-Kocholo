INTRODUCING KASPERSKY SECURITY FOR VIRTUALIZATION | LIGHT AGENT Matvey Voytov Product Marketing\n\n2. VIRTUALIZATION BASICS\n\n4. HYPERVISOR – CORE OF VIRTUALIZATION 4 Hypervisor – specialized software which allows to create and operate virtual machines (VM). It manages physical computing resources sharing them among VM. Hardware Hypervisor VM VM VM VM VM\n\n5. VIRTUAL MACHINE – BASIC ELEMENT OF VIRTUALIZATION 5 Virtual Machine (VM) – isolated software environment that takes all necessary computing resources like CPU, RAM, HDD from hypervisor, which allows you to run different operating systems and applications on single host. Hardware Hypervisor Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8\n\n6. TWO MOST COMMON TYPES OF VIRTUALIZATION 6 Server Virtualization Infrastructure Desktop Virtualization Infrastructure (VDI) Hardware Hypervisor Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2012 Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8\n\n7. VIRTUALIZATION BENEFITS FOR BUSINESS VMVM IT-COSTS REDUCTION FLEXIBLE MANAGEMENT RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION HARDWARE INDEPENDENCE 7\n\n8. ►VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS ARE MORE SECURE THAN PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS? GUEST OS IS THE SAME TARGET FOR MALWARE AS USUAL OS. FROM MALWARE STANDPOINT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VM AND REAL PC. FALSE ►CYBERCRIMINALS DON’T TARGET VIRTUAL MACHINES?FALSE MORCUT (AKA CRISIS), THE FIRST TROJAN TARGETING VIRTUAL MACHINES, WAS IDENTIFIED IN 2012 ►MALWARE CAN’T SURVIVE THE DECOMMISSIONING OF NON-PERSISTENT VIRTUAL MACHINES?FALSE RESIDENT MALWARE CAN SECURITY IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 8\n\n9.

VIRTUALIZATION SECURITY SOLUTIONS & LIGHT AGENT APPROACH\n\n11. VIRTUAL SECURITY – THE OPTIONS 11 AGENTLESS NO PROTECTION LIGHT AGENT TRADITIONAL NOT AN OPTION! GREAT PROTECTION /INEFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION EASY DEPLOY/MANAGE FOR VMWARE FEATURE-RICH SECURITY\n\n12. Each guest protects itself - All set of antimalware bases locally at every VM, separate kernel to scan every VM •Excessive resource consumption •Update storms •Instant-On gaps •Lower VM densities AGENT-BASED SECURITY\n\n13. •Keeps VM density (consolidation ratio) high •No problems of Agent- based security, but.. •Less security •Only VMware AGENTLESS SECURITY 13\n\n15. PROACTIVE DEFENSE INCLUDING AUTOMATIC EXPLOIT PREVENTION LIGHT AGENT | FILE LEVEL PROTECTION 15 AWARD-WINNING ANTI-MALWARE ENGINE REAL-TIME RESPONSE TO ZERO-DAY THREATS - KASPERSKY SECURITY NETWORK CLOUD-BASED INTELLIGENCE DEEP-LEVEL SCANNING AT INDIVIDUAL MACHINE LEVEL, PROTECTING AGAINST THE MOST ADVANCED MALWARE\n\n16. LIGHT AGENT | NETWORK LEVEL PROTECTION 16 FEATURES HOST-BASED INTRUSION PROVENSION SYSTEM (HIPS) AND FIREWALL NETWORK ATTACK BLOCKER IDENTIFIES AND RESPONDS TO SUSPICIOUS TRAFFIC BEHAVIOUR IDENTIFIES AND BLOCKS LINKS TO PHISHING SITES\n\n17. WEB CONTROL APPLICATION CONTROL DEVICE CONTROL LIGHT AGENT | CONTROLS 17\n\n18. 18 Internet vSphere Microsoft Hyper-V Linux-based hypervisor VDI for internal use Servers with conf info Test bed KSV KSV Endpoint Endpoint Kaspersky Security Center (KSC) KSV | Agentless Kaspersky Endpoint SecurityKSV | Light Agent REAL LIFE CASE – WHAT SOLUTION TO CHOOSE\n\n19. 19 WHAT OUR SOLUTION IS COMPRISED OF *NB!! Kaspersky Security for Virtualization is managed via Kaspersky Security Center\n\n20. WHO CAN BENEFIT THE MOST FROM USING KASPERSKY SECURITY FOR VIRTUALIZATION? 20 Enterprises Service Providers Multi-hypervisor infrastructure owners ..as well as SMB\n\n21. WHAT MAKES OUR SOLUTION DIFFERENT? 21 Low performance impact on virtual infrastructure, thanks to optimized architecture and dedicated virtual appliance for AV-scan tasks1. Better protection quality, thanks to wide range of protection components and technologies, including Anti-Malware, Automatic Exploit Prevention, Application Control, HIPS, Firewall, Network Attack Blocker, and URL Scan. Comprehensive solution supporting multiple hypervisor platforms (VMware, Citrix and Hyper-V), set of protection components with flexible configuration. Efficient deployment and management of the entire IT infrastructure security with Kaspersky Security Center unified management solution. 1 2 3 4 1 – read more at http://www.kaspersky.com/about/news/compare/2014/Kaspersky-Lab-Tops- Competitors-in-Testing-of-Security-Software-in-Virtual-Environments\n\n22.
