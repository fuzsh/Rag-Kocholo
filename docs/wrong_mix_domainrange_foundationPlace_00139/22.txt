Eugene Kaspersky will draw upon Kaspersky Lab’s extensive role in working with international agencies including the UN, Interpol, Europol and AFCEA, to discuss the impact of the global cyber security landscape on Australia and its region. Providing policy and technological proposals to deal with the emerging dangers, Eugene will examine the latest trends in the cyber arena and their impact on critical infrastructure protection.

Eugene began his career in cybersecurity accidentally when his computer became infected with the ‘Cascade’ virus in 1989. Eugene’s specialized education in cryptography helped him analyze the encrypted virus, understand its behavior, and develop a removal tool for it. After successfully removing the virus, Eugene’s curiosity and passion for computer technology drove him to start analyzing more malicious programs and developing disinfection modules for them. This exotic collection of antivirus modules would eventually become the foundation for Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus database. Today the database is one of the most comprehensive and complete collections in cybersecurity, protecting systems from more than 100 million malicious programs.

In 1990 Eugene started gathering a team of like-minded enthusiast researchers to create the AVP Toolkit Pro antivirus program, which was recognized by the University of Hamburg in 1994 as the most effective antivirus software in the world.

Eugene and his colleagues then decided to establish their own independent company. In 1997 Kaspersky Lab was founded, with Eugene heading the company’s antivirus research. In 2007 he was named Kaspersky Lab’s CEO.

Today Kaspersky Lab is the world’s largest privately-held vendor of endpoint protection, operating in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. The company employs approximately 3,000 professionals and IT security specialists in dedicated regional offices across 30 countries and its cybersecurity technologies protect over 300 million users worldwide.

Eugene has earned a number of international awards for his technological, scientific and entrepreneurial achievements. He was voted the World’s Most Powerful Security Exec by SYS-CON Media in 2011, awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Plymouth University in 2012, and named one of Foreign Policy Magazine’s 2012 Top Global Thinkers for his contribution to IT security awareness on a global scale.
