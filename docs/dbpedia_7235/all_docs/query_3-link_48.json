        "text": "*SPOILER FREE*\n\nThis one is tough. I was very excited to read this book because the premise really grabbed me and so did the cover! This book is also my first contemporary horror. So, it was a lot to take in and I had a lot of expectations.\n\nI gave this book 3 out of 5 stars. Not because it wasn’t good, but because it wasn’t for me. It was also very very gruesome. When I refer to the gruesomeness of this book I am referring to how Stephen Graham Jones handles animals and all the horrible things that happen to them in this book. I do not have the stomach for any kind of harm coming to animals. And the fact that that kind of thing happens to many animals in the book– and that it is a huge premise of the book– kept me from truly enjoying the narrative. I always felt like I had my hand over my eyes to keep from seeing these horrible events. I will say that the harm to animals is not unwarranted. The humans in the book who harm the animals get their comeuppance.\n\nThe characters are also marvellous. I love how different each of them are and how Jones makes me feel like I know them. I didn’t need tons of exposition from other parts of the book to understand each of them. Very clever writing, indeed.\n\nThis book was not scary though– and this is coming from someone who gets very scared, very easily. I found Crimson Peak scary… This book was more haunting, and that works. You’ll never know when it is lurking in the background and you’ll never know who it is.\n\nI wish I had liked the book more but it just wasn’t the book for me. Jones has a wonderful narrative voice though and I cannot wait to read his other work!\n\nI don’t know when it started but, at some point between mid-university to earlier this year I became lost. Lost in myself, my path, my purpose, my goals, my dreams. And the more years that went by, the more lost I became. I got stuck in the deepest, darkest forest and there was no light to show me my way out. Lost and trapped are not good feelings. In hindsight, it took me way too long to listen to my intuition and realize what was going on. I should have trusted myself more. Nevertheless, it may have taken me a while but I got there. I am in a place now where I have finally begun to see some light and I’m following it, finding my path and aligning with the universe. It is all new to me, so it’s definitely a journey. And I have way more questions than answers right now but I am trusting in the Universe. That the Universe has guided me to where I need to be. At twenty-five years old I am finding my way.\n\nI really want to document this journey on my blog, since I have been so absent for so long. I write a journal about my spiritual journey, sure, but on here’s everything is public. I am going to hold myself accountable for my self improvement. So, look forward to more posts from me on here! Finally. I would also love it for you to share your stories with me! Send me a message on Insta (@Youfoundmarinasbooks) or comment below! We are all going on this journey together.\n\n✨ I am where I am meant to be and the only way through is forward. ✨\n\n“The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”\n\n― St. Augustine\n\nI developed my travel bug very early on in life. My grandparents took me all over the world as a child and it was always a positive experience. Even when I got food poisoning in Orlando, or stung by a jelly fish in Daytona, or threw up on the plane over the Atlantic Ocean and on a bus in Norwich, or incredibly sea sick in Alaska, these experiences were still all ones that I will cherish. For all the bad moments I made many many more positive ones. Now, in hindsight, all of these hiccups just add to my fondness for travel.\n\nThere are many reasons that I love to travel. Read on to get your wanderlust going (and if it’s constantly on, like mine, let me feed it with some fun stories)…\n\nHISTORY\n\nI love history. Period. I love all of it. One of my majors from my undergrad degree was an honours history degree. I especially love my ancient history so getting to travel to Rome and see the Coliseum was surreal. Walking on the Acropolis of Athens I couldn’t help but think about how many ancients walked the same steps that I was taking.\n\nIn Europe there are still very obvious signs of World War II around. Some places are more evident than others, but finding a bomb shelter in an English backyard or simply just being in Poland, you feel it.\n\nHistory is everywhere, it is in everyone and everything. Nothing makes me feel more connected to history than travel and there is no better way to experience it.\n\n“Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow.”\n\n― Anita Desai\n\nEXPLORE AND EXPERIENCE\n\nI have an inherent need to explore. When I was a kid, my grandparents and I would go for long walks. I would always ask to explore off the path, to go into the forest, or to climb the rocks. I always wanted to see more. Today, I feel just the same. I wanted to see every corner of Versailles, I wanted to take in every angle. I am terrified of heights but I still climbed the 243 steps up the Penitent Bridge in Wrocław just to see that breathtaking view of the city, and again in Warsaw to see the magical sunset. Another experience I will never forget was approaching Charles Bridge at sunrise and seeing Prague Castle illuminated like an absolute fairy tale. Unbelievably beautiful.\n\nOne of the most memorable things I have ever done, and perhaps the smallest in terms of how it may seem, was getting to see the statue of “Menelaus Carrying the Body of Patroclus.” I went back to see it three times. Once at night and twice in the day. It was surreal. Seeing art and history whilst amplifying my love for fiction and great literature was one of the top three experiences I have ever had in my life.\n\n“Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.”\n\n― Gustave Flaubert\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the Duomo. Speechless is how I felt quite often when I was in Florence.\n\n“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.”\n\n― Mark Twain, The Innocents Abroad / Roughing It\n\nGROWTH\n\nPerhaps most importantly, I love to travel because it helps me grow as a person. All the learning, and the experiencing change me for the better. Since I began my travelling (away from my immediate family) in 2014 I have grown to be a more confident person. I understand my strengths and my weaknesses what I enjoy and what I dislike. I have learned to control any anxiety I may have while travelling as best I can.\n\nTravelling not only helps my personal growth and understanding my connection to history but it also helps me understand where I come from. My dad’s side is English and I’ve visited England many times. My mom’s side is Armenian. I would love to go to Armenia one day to fully understand where I come from, but until then I will try experience it through my Armenian family in California. I was also fortunate enough to go to Greece, which is one of the countries where my mom grew up. I felt more connected to her there than I have since she passed away ten years ago. It was an amazing feeling.\n\nRecently, I have made travel a priority of mine. This is very difficult being a woman who will mostly be travelling solo, and as a woman who also makes only minimum wage. But travel has become so important to me and to my identity that I am determined to make it work.\n\nStay tuned to see a post on the top 10 places I want to visit in the world!\n\nWhere in the world have I travelled? Click HERE to find out!\n\nSo far, 2018 has been a great reading year. I don’t think there has ever been a year where, within the span of three months, I’ve managed to read five books (for pleasure). For me that’s such a win.\n\nI had originally set my 2018 Bookish New Years Resolution to read 30 books but the first couple of weeks in January didn’t go so well, in terms of bookish accomplishments. Then I heard that Ariel Bissett sets her goal to one book every year to take the pressure off. So, I changed my goal to 12 books. That’s one book a month; easy stuff. I am already seeing what a good idea it has turned out to be. According to GoodReads I am three-whole-books books ahead of schedule. It feels good.\n\nAnyway, you came here for spoiler-free mini-reviews of all the books that I’ve read. So, without further ado, it begins:\n\nHalf a King by Joe Abercrombie\n\n4/5 Stars\n\nThe main character in this book, Yarvi, is a Prince but he is destined for a life away from the throne. That is until his father, the king, is murdered. Thus ensues heartbreak, betrayal, and treason.\n\nHalf a King was not a fast-paced book, although the beginning is the exception– it thrusts you into the events and, before you know it, you’re hooked and rooting for poor Yarvi. There’s a lot of character growth in Yarvi and how could there not be when your family betrays you and you’re forcibly sold to a fierce sea-captain as a slave. Yarvi is resourceful and intelligent and, despite all the hardships he has endured, Yarvi is kind. He becomes a man during the events of this book but I’d have a tough time deciding if Half a King is character based or plot based.\n\nI’d say the driving force for this book (at least for me) is the possibility of catharsis. You can’t wait for Yarvi to get home one day and show his family and his people how strong he is, how much he’s suffered, and how misunderstood he has been. And we get a real treat of what I like to call “double-catharisis” at the end.\n\nMy only qualm with his book is that it was too short. I know it’s the first book in a series but this book needed more, especially as a borderline-high-fantasy. It needed more description, more character development of all of the characters, more conflict, more journeying. More of everything. Except the ending. The ending was prefect.\n\nDear Ijeawele, or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\n5/5 Stars\n\nWhen people ask me what I thought of this book I am always struck with how little I have to say. This is simply because my opinion can be wrapped up in a neat little sentence: Reading Adichie’s letters helped me change how I perceive things. If you want me to go on further: it helped me open my eyes and recognize things that I’d buried deep within me. These aspects of life Adichie mentions were things that, as a woman, I’d noticed and some things I didn’t realize that I’d noticed. But in reading this book, all of those underlying details that I’d buried deep within me because of the patriarchal society we live in, came to the surface and now I perceive the world differently. More importantly, I perceive the world more actively.\n\nEveryone should read this book no matter the gender that they identify with, no matter if they have children or not, no matter if they are fifteen years old or ninety-five.\n\nSea of Shadows by Kelly Armstrong\n\n3/5 Stars\n\nThere’s always that one book you want to love but turns out to be a dud. I don’t like to write negative things about books unless they’re really bad like how I felt about The Captive Prince so I’ll keep this “review” short. This books was really lacking in my opinion. Lacking in writing, lacking in character, lacking in plot. I was just not impressed. I think the most frustrating thing about it was that I could not pin down the two main characters: Moria and Ashyn. I think the problem there came from when we first meet Moria. In those first few pages I developed a sense for her character but when we meet again I found Moria’s initial characteristics in Ashyn and the confusion between the two never cleared. Beyond that, I won’t say much. I did find the story to be alluring, in that I wanted to find out what happened next. The writing, on the other hand, left everything to be desired which felt strange considering Armstrong’s status in the literary world.\n\nThe Telling Pool by David Clement-Davies\n\n4/5 Stars\n\nThis book has many mixed reviews and, as for me, I have very mixed feelings. While the writing was rich and the plot was loaded with many allegories and lessons, I can’t quite pinpoint the story’s nature or it’s intended audience. This is my first David Clement-Davies book so I look forward to seeing how this matches up to the likes of The Sight. I like how real this book was, how close to human nature, and how Rhodri’s thoughts process and develop throughout the book. It was a much slower read, especially having just read Sea of Shadows which takes the form of the most basic writing style and which I zipped through.\n\nI feel like I still need to process the story in order to properly review it. Maybe one day I’ll have my thoughts in order…\n\nCall Me By Your Name by Andre Aciman\n\n5/5 Stars\n\nBesides Adichie’s book (above), Call Me By Your Name is one of my favourite reads this year. I listened to it in the span of three days, I couldn’t get enough. I then proceeded to watch the movie and have declared myself obsessed. I don’t know if my obsession is in the story or in the idea of love. As a twenty-three year old woman who has never fallen in love, this Aciman fed me full of what it must be like to be in love (though Elio and Oliver’s love can also called infatuation– but I cannot argue that with so little evidence from my own life to draw from). This story is filled with so much of what it means to be human that reading it I felt raw at times. It was so beautiful. I want to review this in a separate post at some point because I have so much to say. Beyond that, I will leave you with this: Call Me By Your Name is one of my favourite books, though my impression just after reading it was that I wouldn’t call it one of my top five. Make of that what you will, I suppose.\n\nCurrently Reading:\n\nThe Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller (re-read)\n\nNorthanger Abbey by Jane Austen\n\nTulip Fever by Deborah Moggach\n\nSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSave\n\nThis is a compilation of excerpts from an essay I wrote during the summer for a history course at York University.\n\nPart I of the origin story is in my video below:\n\nPart II of the Origin Story:\n\nFrankenstein was written at a time when Britain was at the cusp of change; Britain was about to enter the first stages of its Industrial Revolution. Mary Shelley, born nearly half a century before the Industrial Revolution, was therefore raised in a society that served as a precursor to the technological transformations to come. Her society was both tolerant and intolerant of change, like many others who find themselves at the end of an era. The guidelines that were created to keep polite society refined were challenged by many, including Mary Shelley. Most who went against societal norms faced rejection in some form. For Shelley, her transgressions were numerous. Mainly, her “faults” were founded in her political beliefs and her relations with Percy Shelley. As a feminist, Mary Shelley was considered a radical, like her mother. Women were subject to very little freedom and enormous amounts of sexism.\n\nIt is a feminist rejection, or more accurately, the rejection of feminine choice and agency. In the novel, Mary Shelley has Frankenstein abort the creation of a female Creature. Frankenstein fears that the female he creates “will have desires and opinions that cannot be controlled by his male creature…” or even by Frankenstein himself. He also fears that this independent free will might be aggressive. Frankenstein fears this tremendous lack of control of the female he might create. If he were to create this female creature she might “[defy] that sexist aesthetic that insists that women be small, delicate, modest, passive, and sexually pleasing—but available only to their lawful husbands.”\n\nThe Creature has no name in the story though he does have a voice. This is the opposite of what Mary Shelley has as a woman, though nonetheless reminiscent. She has a name but her voice is hardly heard. Even in the publication of her book many believed, and still believe that she, a female, could not have possibly written the book, that it must have been a man.\n\nGoing against these sexist precursors of polite society was an easy route to alienation. Mary met Percy Shelley through her father. When Mary and Percy determined to be lovers some time later, Percy Shelley was married to another woman. Time went on and circumstances changed; they married in 1816 soon after Percy’s wife, Harriet, committed suicide. During this period before and after Mary and Percy’s marriage was when Frankenstein was conceived and created, though it was published after their union. This liaison with Percy Shelley was considered quite immoral. During the period before their marriage they had two children. As a result, Mary Shelley had a considerably difficult time being accepted into society. Unlike the Creature in Frankenstein, however, she did have a close circle of friends to rely upon. People reject the Creature because he is ugly, and in turn, people fear him. The family he secretly lives with at the beginning of his new life rejects him before they even know him, assuming he is harming the eldest member of the family.\n\nMary Shelley also experienced her fare share of paternal confusions and rejections. Mary Shelley’s mother died at childbirth and so, throughout her life, Mary worked to find and create a “nuclear family” on both her real life and in her many works of “fiction” Frankenstein then, is a literary illustration of what happens when a child is raised without a complete family filled with love and support. Mary Shelley also had a distinctive affection for her father, “later writing that her attachment to him bordered on the ‘romantic’ and was ‘excessive.’” He paid special attention to his daughters, though, after his wife’s death, he searched for another marriageable companion. When Godwin finally remarried, Mary did not take to her stepmother. This relationship had a negative effect on Mary’s relationship with her father to the extent that during a period of her life she found herself estranged from her father. Mary too was rejected by her father, arguably not to the same extent as her Creature.\n\nBibliography\n\nBeer, John. Romantic Consciousness. London: Palgrave MacMillan. 2003.\n\nBennett, Betty T.

People with anxiety are always expending extra energy just by being. Being. Like the phone with the flashlight left on, our energy depletes much faster than a person who is not plagued by an anxious mind. That’s without any kind of outside stimulation like social interaction. Add socialization into the mix and you’ve left your Pokemon GO app running, full brightness, with your flashlight on. Bye Bye battery.\n\nSo, working in retail is like an amplification of that drainage. Anxiety becomes a high intensity electricity coursing through your entire body for the length of the shift, before, and after. Not only do you have to deal with issues and conflict in the workplace, the simple task of conversing with customers and coworkers is maddeningly exhausting.\n\nThat phone call to your boss about changing your shift, or calling in sick, becomes your worst nightmare.\n\nAngry customers become seething monsters who feed off of all of your anxieties.\n\nThat pain in your neck from lifting all those boxes must be chronic.\n\nYou almost died putting the cardboard into the compactor.\n\nThis might all sound funny, but it is scary and it is real.\n\nOn top of all of this, it is in my personal nature to work full-tilt. I cannot slow down at work. I give it my all and nothing less. I smile, I speed walk (sometimes run), I circle the store for returns, I smile some more.\n\nIt is no surprise that a five hour shift feels like a 16 hour shift at the end of the day. All I want to do is curl up and sleep. Though I can only sleep after my brain has calmed down from the day. So, depending how late my shift goes (I work in a 24 hour store) that could be hours later.\n\nI have worked in retail for three years and I only told one of my co-workers that I suffer with anxiety yesterday. She was genuinely surprised. I must hide it well.\n\nThe task is not impossible, but it is extremely difficult. I am not sorry I do it, I do not dread each shift more than any anxiety-less person would. Every shift I have is a battle, it is a way for me to become stronger, to overcome anxiety. If I can do it, you can too. Remember, you are not alone.\n\nWhat do we say to the God of Anxiety? Not today.\n\nI hadn’t expected to enjoy Mary E. Pearson’s The Kiss of Deception when I placed the book on my shelf months ago, and I certainly felt no differently when I started the book last week. I began reading it simply to get it off my TBR, though I was curious what so many people were talking about.\n\nMy initial impartial feelings towards the tale came when I read the first line of the book: “Today was the day a thousand dreams would die and a single dream would be born.” The line felt forced, like it was trying too hard. I decided then that I would dislike the book.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nAlthough the going was slow for me, at first, I began to thoroughly like the book. I would find myself at work thinking about Lia, Rafe and Kaden. Now I need the second book. Only, there are three books coming out in the next three weeks that are going to cost me a fair amount of coin. And there are over 100 books on my TBR list. I know, I have a problem. These are good problems though.\n\nAs for the book, here are some of my thoughts:\n\nYes, the book does have a love triangle but it is not what you would expect. Pearson has written her book so that I never ever shipped Lia one of the love interests. Though they had their moments I could never trust him. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a sucker for the mysterious bad boy in books but this guy, I just can’t ever picture him as a love interest. So, in a way, it’s not an actual love interest. The love only goes one way.\n\nWhen I began the book and the perspectives changed I struck me hard. I hadn’t noticed the change in perspective that is written beneath the chapter number. I was not prepared. I got used to this after a while, after I was able to discern which character was Rafe and which character was Kaden. IT took me several chapters. After that, though, my enjoyment increased. (Sorry for the dry language; I’m in book withdrawal.)\n\nI also don’t quite understand the cover.\n\nLia’s crown is made of lavender in the book and on the cover there are pink and white flowers, for one. Who’s the girl holding the horse in the background beside the little tower? Pauline? What is the building supposed to be? Maybe I’m thinking too much. Also, the title does not feel serious enough. For the weight that the book carries in character development and strong plot work, the title seems to lie. The Kiss of Deception feels like a deception in itself. Without the back blurb for guidance, the title suggests that the novel is only about a deceptive love interest. This novel is so, so much more.\n\nMary E. Pearson is exceptional in her ability to describe and fill up space. I say this with the most admiration because that’s what I find most difficult in writing. The novel is nearly 500 pages and would be considerably– if not a third of the current size– shorter if it wasn’t for all of the descriptions, flashbacks, and change of perspective. Where in some novels this may become tedious and unnecessary, Pearson uses her skill well. It makes the book so much… deeper. (Again my arsenal of interesting synonyms is unavailable because I’m in book withdrawal).\n\nMy overall rating 3.5/5. On GoodReads I rated the book 4/5 because 3.5 isn’t an option. But 4/5 is just as good.\n\nI can’t wait to read the next instalment!\n\nHave you read the book? Tell me what you think. Do you have any other book recommendations for me? I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nCome find me!\n\nTwitter: marinasheartxo\n\nInstagram (Personal): MarinasHeart\n\nInstagram (Makeup): MakeupWithMarina\n\nInstagram (Fandom): LifeInFandom\n\nGoodReads\n\nPintrest"
