        "text": "Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound (trans. H. W. Smyth, adapted by L. Zhang)\n\nGreek Tragedy, 5th century BCE\n\nIn the 5th Century BCE at Athens, the Greek playwright Aeschylus wrote the tragedy, Prometheus Bound, which opens with Prometheus being chained to a rock in the Caucuses by Cratos and Bios, personifications of “Power” and “Force,” minions of Zeus and helpers of Hephaestus:\n\nEnter Power and Force, bringing with them the captive Prometheus; also Hephaestus.\n\nPOWER:\n\nWe come to the most remote limit of the earth, to Scythia, an empty place, where no one has ever set foot. And now, Hephaestus, you must obey the command of Father Zeus—to chain this criminal [5] up on the craggy rocks, binding him in unbreakable iron shackles. He has stolen fire, which belongs to you, and is the source of all arts, and he has given it to mortals. This is his offence; for this he must pay the penalty to the gods, [10] so that he learns to submit. to the rule of Zeus and cease his mankind-loving ways.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nPower and Force, you have done what Zeus commanded you to do. You do not need to do anything else. As for me—I do not have the nerve [15] to bind a kindred god to this rocky, icy cliff. But whatever happens, I need to muster up the courage to do it; for it is dangerous to disobey the command of father Zeus.\n\nYou, Prometheus! You righteous son of wise Themis! It is against my will as much as yours that I must nail you with unremovable brass bonds [20] to this deserted cliff, where you will neither hear nor see any mortal man; but, scorched by the sun’s bright beams, your flesh will scorch and whither. You will be glad when sparkling-robed night covers his brightness, [25] at least until the sun again scatters the morning frost. The burden of your pains will wear you down, since the one who will free you has not even been born yet.\n\nThis is the prize you get for championing men. Even though you are a god, you did not fear the anger of the gods, and [30] you gave mortals more honour than they deserved. Therefore, you must stand guard, upright, and sleepless on this joyless rock, groaning and wailing. For Zeus has a hard heart. [35] Every new ruler is merciless.\n\nPOWER:\n\nCome on, why do you stand there, delaying and pitying him?! Don’t you detest a god that is repugnant to the gods? He took your very own gift and gave it to mortals!\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nKinship is a strangely strong bond, and friendship as well.\n\nPOWER:\n\n[40] I agree; yet, can you possibly disobey the Father’s commands? Aren’t you afraid of doing that?\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nAs ever, you are pitiless, steeped in arrogance and cruelty.\n\nPOWER:\n\nYes, because it does no good to cry over him. Stop wasting your labour on something that does you no good.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\n[45] Ahhh, I hate my hateful craft!\n\nPOWER:\n\nWhy hate it? Your craft is not to blame for these troubles.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nNevertheless, I wish someone else had to do this job.\n\nPOWER:\n\nEvery job is burdensome, unless it is being ruler of the gods; [50] no one is free except Zeus.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nBecause of this job, I know! I can’t argue with that.\n\nPOWER:\n\nThen hurry up and throw the manacles around him, so that the Father doesn’t see you hesitating.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nAlright! The bands are ready, as you can see.\n\nPOWER:\n\n[55] Throw them around his wrists and strike them with your mighty hammer; chain him to the rocks.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nThere! The work is done and done well.\n\nPOWER:\n\nStrike harder, clamp him tight, leave nothing loose; he is very clever at finding his way out of desperate circumstances.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\n[60] This arm, at least, is fixed in place for good.\n\nPOWER:\n\nNow bind this one securely too, so that he learns that, in spite of all his cleverness, he is a fool compared to Zeus.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nNo one but Prometheus could find fault with my work.\n\nPOWER:\n\nNow pound the iron nail straight [65] through his chest with full force.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nAhhh, Prometheus, I feel your anguish!\n\nPOWER:\n\nWhat are you doing?! Cowering again and feeling pity for Zeus‘s enemies? Be careful that you aren’t feeling sorry for yourself some day!\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nYou are seeing a sight that is unbearable to see.\n\nPOWER:\n\n[70] I see this man getting his fair punishment. Come, strap in his torso.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nI know what I have to do; stop ordering me around.\n\nPOWER:\n\nIndeed, I will order you, yes and even more that that—I’ll hound you. Crouch down and bind his legs with force.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\n[75] There now! The work’s done and without too much effort.\n\nPOWER:\n\nNow, give the nails one last strong pounding; the boss is a harsh critic.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nYour ugly words match your ugly face.\n\nPOWER:\n\nBe a bleeding-heart then, [80] but don’t insult me.\n\nHEPHAESTUS:\n\nLet’s go. He’s all chained up.\n\nExit Hephaestus\n\nPOWER:\n\nThere now, indulge your arrogance! Keep taking the gods’ honours and giving them to mortals, who only live for a day. Can mortals help you now? [85] The gods are wrong to call you Prometheus, for you lack the forethought to get yourself out of this mess.\n\nExit Power and Force\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYou, bright sky, and you, swift-winged breezes, you, rivers, and [90] ocean waves with your infinite laughter! Universal mother Earth, and you, all-seeing sun, I call out to you! Look at what I, a god, have to endure from the gods!\n\nLook at the shameful torture I will suffer [95] for endless years! This is the bondage that the new commander of the blessed gods has put on me. Arghhhh! I cry out from my present agony and for the agony that will come. [100] When will it end!\n\nBut what am I saying? I know everything that will happen to me, in advance and in full. I need to bear this punishment as well as I can, knowing that [105] Necessity allows me no resistance or escape. But I can’t speak and I can’t be quiet about my fate. It is because I gave gifts to mortals that I am being punished, bound by [105] Necessity. I found and stored fire in a hollow fennel stalk [110], which acted as a teacher for humans in every art and craft. This is the offence for which I pay the penalty, bound and chained beneath the open sky.\n\nHey! What’s that? [115] What murmur do I hear? What smell floats up to me? Is it god or human or both? I cannot see. Has someone come to this cliff at the edge of the world to gawk at me as I suffer? Or for some other reason? Look at me! A doomed god, all chained up, [120] the enemy of Zeus, hated by everyone in his house because of my love of mortals. What’s that? What’s that rustling I hear close by? Birds? The air is whirring with the rush of wings. What is coming?\n\nThe Daughters of Ocean enter on a winged chariot\n\nCHORUS:\n\nDon’t be afraid! We have come to this cliff as your friends, [130] arriving on swift wings. Our father reluctantly gave his permission. Down in our caves, we felt the reverberations iron being pounded up on the mountain and our fear for you drove away any shyness that we had. [135] We have come so quickly in our flying chariot, that we forgot our sandals!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nAh! Ah! Children of fertile Tethys and of he who surrounds the whole earth with his sleepless current, children of [140] Ocean, look at me! Look at the fetters that bind me to the peak of this mountain, where I hold my unenviable post.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nI see, Prometheus! [145] Tears and trepidation spread over my eyes, as I first saw your body withering wretchedly. on this rock, in these iron chains. For there are new rulers in heaven, and Zeus governs with [150] harsh, new laws, replacing and negating the old powers.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI wish he had hurled me below the earth! Yes beneath Hades, host of the dead, into impenetrable Tartarus, [155] and had bound me ruthlessly there, in unremovable binds, so that no god or human could gloat over my agony! But, as it is, I am a miserable plaything for the wind, and my suffering delights my enemies.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[160] What god is so cruel that they delight in this? Who wouldn’t sympathize with you—except Zeus, of course? He is inflexible in his malice165] and keeps the Titans, the children of Uranus, in subjection to himself. He will not stop until he is either sated, or someone else uses cunning and tricks to seize his unassailable throne.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nActually, although right now I am tortured by these iron manacles, [170] the day will come when Zeus, the prince of the gods, will need me. He will ask me to reveal the future, how one day he will be stripped of all his power. But he won’t be able to persuade or charm me; [175] and I will never yield to his threats. I won’t divulge the secret, until he releases me from my cruel bonds and give me compensation for this outrage.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[180] You are bold and defiant, Prometheus. You do not yield before this bitter torture, and you speak your mind. But I am agitated by fear for you, [185] wondering to what safe habour you can steer your ship to end your sorrowful voyage. For Cronus‘ son [pb_glossary id=\"172\"]Zeus[/pb_glossary] is impervious to appeals and he is unrelenting.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI know that Zeus is harsh and [190] has his own form of justice; but nevertheless, one day he will let up, once he has been crushed in the way that I know he will be. Then, letting go of his anger, [195] he will be eager to be my friend.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nTell us the whole story. What crime does Zeus charge you with? What did he catch you doing? Why does he punish you like this? Tell us! Unless there is some good reason not to.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIt is painful to me to tell the story, [200] and painful to keep it silent. My case is unfortunate in every way.\n\nWhen conflict arose among the gods– with some eager to expel Cronus from his throne so that Zeus could rule, while others wanted [205] the opposite, so that Zeus would never win control over the gods—I tried to persuade the Titans, children of Uranus and Earth to accept Zeus as their new ruler. But I was unsuccessful. They rejected my ideas and thought that their physical strength [210] would let them win easily. My mother Themis, or Earth– she has many different names– had often told me the future what was fated. She told me that the victors would not win with brute strength and violence, [215] but by trickery. And even though I told them this, the Titans did not pay any attention to me. So I decided that it was best to join with my mother, [220] and volunteer for Zeus‘s side. And it is because of the advice that I gave him, that gloomy Tartarus now holds ancient Cronus and his allies. So I helped the tyrant of the gods [225] and this is how he repays me. It is a disease of tyranny to have no faith in one’s friends.\n\nHowever, you have asked why he torments me. I will tell you.\n\n[230] As soon as he sat on his father’s throne, Zeus immediately assigned to the gods their special privileges and powers. But paid no attention to the wretched mortals. He wanted to end [235] the whole race and create a new one in its place. Nobody dared to stand against him except for me— only I had the courage. I saved mortals so that their race was not eradicated and they did not descend permanently to the house of Hades. This is why I am tortured, [240] why I suffer painfully, pitifully. I, who pitied mortals, am deemed unworthy of pity myself. Instead I am disciplined mercilessly, a spectacle that shames the glory of Zeus.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nWhoever feels no compassion for you is iron-hearted and made of stone, Prometheus. [245] As for myself, I did not want this for you. Now that I see what you are suffering, my heart is in pain.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, well, at least to my friends I am a spectacle of pity.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nDid you maybe do something even worse?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[250] Yes, I allowed mortals to stop foreseeing their own deaths.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nWhat cure did you find for this affliction?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI put blind hope in their breasts.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nYou gave a great gift to mortals.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nAlso, I gave them fire.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[255] What! So these short-lived creatures have flame-eyed fire now?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, and they will learn many arts from it.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nThen this was the crime for which Zeus—\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nTorments me and allows me to respite from pain.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nWill there be no to your ordeal?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[260] No, none, except when he says so.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nBut how will he ever say so? What hope is there? Don’t you see that you are in the wrong? Though, it is unpleasant for me to talk about your crime, and it is painful for you. So, let’s stop. I hope you can find some escape.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[265] It’s easy for one who is out of harm’s way to give advice to one who is miserable. I knew all along what would happen. I did it anyway– I don’t deny it. Through helping mortals, I brought suffering on myself. [270] But I did not think that I would be punished like this, wasting away in the open air, on this desolate and bleak cliff. Don’t feel sorry for me anymore. Land your chariot, and listen [275] to what is going to happen to me in the future. Please, I beg you. Pity the one who is suffering. Indeed, suffering is impartial and, eventually, comes to everyone.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nWe are willing to listen, [280] Prometheus. So we will climb down from out swift, flying chariot, setting our light feet on the ground. We will leave the pure air, the pathway of birds, for the rugged ground. We want to hear [285] everything.\n\nOcean enters on a winged horse.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nI have made a long to journey to get here, Prometheus, riding this swift-winged birth without a bridle to guide it. [290] I feel compassion for you. I have to, because of our kinship, but even if we were not related, there is no one I respect more than you. [295] You know that this is the truth and I do not lie. Tell me, how can I help? You will never be able to say that you have a better friend than Ocean.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[300] Ha! What’s this? So you have also come to gawk at my suffering? How did you work up the courage to leave your stream and your rock caves to come to this iron land? Did you come [305] to see my predicament and sympathize with me? Just look at me— a spectacle! A friend to Zeus, who helped him gain his power. Look at how he tortures me!\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nI see, Prometheus. And even though I know you are wise, I’d like to give you some advice. [310] Know yourself and adapt yourself to the new times. There is a new ruler among the gods. Even though he is far away on his throne in the sky, Zeus might hear you, if you continue to speak so harshly, with such a sharp edge to your words. [315] Then your present trouble will seem like child’s play. Poor victim! Let go of your anger and look for a way out of this misery. Maybe you will think that this advice is old and dull, [320] but your plight, Prometheus, is what you get for your pride and boasting. You have not learned how to be humble. And you do not collapse under punishment. Instead, you add miseries on top of miseries. Take it from me: [325] do not add insult to injury, since a harsh king is in charge now, who is accountable to no one. I’m going to leave now and see whether I can negotiate for your release. Hold your tongue and quit your blustering. [330] Or, can it be that for all your infinite wisdom, you do not realize that a wagging tongue brings about its own destruction.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI envy you because, although you share in my troubles, you share none of the blame. Leave me alone and don’t let it concern you. [335] Do what you want, but you can’t persuade him Zeus. He is not easy to persuade. Be careful that you don’t harm yourself by undertaking this mission.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nClearly you are better at advising others than advising yourself. I base this observation on fact and not on heresay. [340] Don’t hold me back; I want to go. I’m confident that Zeus will grant me this favor and free you from your sufferings.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI will never stop thanking you for this. You certainly do not lack spirit! But don’t trouble yourself. Your efforts will be in vain and [345] will not help me, even if you want to take on the pain. No, keep quiet and stay safe. Even if things are hard for me, I wouldn’t wish this fate on anyone else. Not at all! Besides myself, I am distressed for [350] my brother Atlas, who, stands in the west, holding the pillar of heaven and earth on his shoulders, a hard burden to bear.\n\nI was saddened, too, when I saw Typhon, the earth-born inhabitant of the Cilician caves, the gruesome, hundred-headed monster, struck down violently [355]. He withstood all of the gods, hissing out terror from his horrid jaws, glaring from his hideous eyes, seeming as though he might conquer Zeus by force. [360] But Zeus struck him down with his unsleeping thunderbolt, the swooping lightening brand with its fiery breath. It charred the boasts on his tongue and, struck in his frightened heart, he was burned to ashes and all his strength was blasted away.\n\n[365] Now he is a helpless, sprawling bulk, lying pressed down by the narrows of the sea, beneath the roots of Mount Etna. And on the top summit Hephaestus sits and hammers out molten ore. One day, rivers of fire will burst forth [370] from there, devouring with savage jaws the fields of Sicily, the land of beautiful fruit. Typhon will send his boiling rage spewing out, hot, fire-breathing jets, even though he himself was charred by the blazing lightening of Zeus.\n\n[375] But you are experience, and I do not need to tell you. Save yourself, as best you can. I will strengthen my resolve, until Zeus abandons his wrath.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nDon’t you know, Prometheus, that [380] words are the best remedy for anger?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, if you tend to wound at the right time, and not while it is raging.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nWhat danger do you see in someone being eager to help you? Tell me.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[385] Wasted effort and stupid naiveté.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nThat’s my problem to deal with. It can be advantageous to seem like a fool, when one is actually very wise.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIt will look like my fault.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nYou clearly want me to go back home.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[390] Just so that you won’t bring hatred on yourself for taking my side.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nYou mean in the eyes of our new, omnipotent tyrant?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nBeware that you don’t turn his anger on yourself.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\nYour plight is instructive to me.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nGo away! Leave! Keep your sympathies to yourself.\n\nOCEANUS:\n\n[395] Well, now I want to go as much as you want me to leave. And my four-footed, winged beast impatiently beats the air with his wings; he’ll be happy to rest his knees in his stall at home.\n\nOcean exits.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nI mourn your unfortunate fate, Prometheus. [400] I soak my tender cheeks, shedding flowing streams of tears from my eyes. Zeus rules with his own harsh and unbending laws [405] and treats the old gods with disdain.\n\nNow the whole earth cries aloud in lamentation; ((lacuna)) . . .\n\nlament for your great flory and honour, [410] the honour that belonged to you and your brother. All mortals living in holy Asia share your anguished suffering.\n\n[415] And those who live in Colchis, the fearless, fighting maidens [the Amazons]; and the throng of Scythians, who live in the most remote region of the earth, bordering lake Maeotis.\n\n[420] And the warlike flower of Arabia, those who hold the high-cragged citadel near the Caucasus, a hostile group that roars amidst their sharp-pointed spears.\n\n[† [425] There is one other Titan who I have seen before this, distressed and caught in adamantine bonds—Atlas, unparalleled in strength, who moans as he supports [430] all of heaven on his back.]\n\nThe waves utter a cry as they fall, the deep sea laments, the black abyss of Hades rumbles in response, and the streams of pure-flowing rivers [435] weep for your miserable pain.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nDon't think that I am silent out of pride or stubbornness. Painful thoughts eat at my heart, as I see myself mistreated in this way. And yet, who else but I divvied up [440] the gifts for these new gods? But I won't mention it, because I wouldn't be telling you something you don't already know. Still, hear about how humans have suffered, about how foolish they used to be, how I have them sense and reason. [445] I do not say this to criticize them, but to explain why I helped them.\n\nIn the first place, they had eyes, but could not see; they had ears, but they did not understand. Like random shapes in dreams, they went their whole lives confused, [450] doing things at random with no purpose. They did not know how to build houses out of brick that face towards the sun, or how to work with wood. The lived in sunless caves underground, like swarming ants. They did not know how to tell when winter [455] was coming, or spring or summer. There were no signs of the changing season and everything seemed to happen at random, until I taught them how to read the risings and settings of the stars.\n\nI invented numbers for them– the best of the arts! I showed them how to combine letters so as to hold things in their memory– the mother of the Muses. I was the first one to use beasts to bear men's burdens, yoking them to collars and loading them with saddle bags. [465] I harnessed horses to chariots and taught them to obey the reins, as a status symbol. And it was me, not anyone else, who invented the chariot with cloth wings in which sailors roam over the sea.\n\nI may be wretched, but I invented all these arts [470] for humans. Yet, I cannot think of one clever trick to get myself out of my present bind.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nYou have endured sorrow and humiliation; you are out of your mind. Like a sick doctor, you have become despondent and cannot [475] find the cure for your own disease.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nListen to the rest and you will be even more amazed at the arts and resources I created. First of all, it used to be that if humans ever got sick, they had no defence. No healing food [480], no ointment, no drink. They wasted away without any medicine. Until I showed then how to mix up the soothing remedies that they now use to prevent illness. And I showed them many different ways to read the future [485]: how to tell which dreams will come true, how to interpret confusing voices and coincidences. I showed them augury (future telling from the flights of birds), noting which birds are auspicious and which ones suspicious; their different ways of life, which birds are friends and which enemies, and which ones sit together. I explained the smoothness of their entrails, and what colour of gall pleases [495] the gods. I showed them the speckled symmetry of the liver. I showed them the ritual of the thigh-bones wrapped in fat and how to burn the long backbone of the animal. I initiated them into this challenging cult. I gave them the ability to read signs from flames, which were opaque before. [500] But enough about these arts. Who else but me can say that he discovered bronze, iron, silver, and gold– all the beneficial elements that lie hidden in the earth? No one! Unless he is a liar. [505] In short, every art that humans have comes from Prometheus.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nDon't help mortals too much and ignore your own distress! Though, I'm confident that you will freed [510] from your bonds and will have power equal to that of Zeus.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nThat's not what Fate has in store for me. I will only escape after I have been humbled by infinite pangs and tortures. Necessity is stronger than skill.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[515] Who is the pilot of Necessity?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nThe three-bodied Fates and the Furies who never forget.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nIs it true that even Zeus has less power than them?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, to the extent that even he cannot avoid what is fated.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nBut, what is Zeus's fate, other than to hold eternal power?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[520] You cannot know this yet, so don't ask me.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nIt must be some great secret that you are covering up.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nLet's change the subject. It is too soon to talk about this. No matter what, it must be kept secret. For, it is only by keeping this information close that [525] I will be able to escape my shameful bonds and my misery.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nI pray that Zeus, who distributes everything to everyone, never has a reason to quarrel with me, [530] and that I never fail to sacrifice slain oxen to the gods, worshipping beside the always-flowing stream ofOcean, my father. [535] And I pray that I never say anything that offends them and that I always keep this rule fresh in my mind forever.\n\nIt is sweet to spend one's whole life full of hope, feeding the spirit with happy festivities. But I shudder [540] as I look at you, racked by infinite tortures. You are not afraid of Zeus, Prometheus, but instead, you stubbornly give too much honour to mortals.\n\n[545] But tell me, my friend, what did mortals ever do for you? What kind of benefit could such an ephemeral race ever give you? What aid? Didn't you see how frail and powerless they are? Fleeting as dreams, blind, and shackled. [550] Plans made by human beings will never be able to subvert the will of Zeus.\n\nI have learned this lesson by observing your fate, Prometheus. I thought about the difference [555] between this song that I am singing now and the one I sang before– about your wedding bed and your wedding bath. The song I sang to celebrate your marriage to our sister [560] Hesione, after you wooed her with lovely gifts.\n\nEnter Io\n\nIO:\n\nWhat is this land? Who are these people? Who do I see chained to the rock there, naked and exposed? What did you do to deserve such a punishment? [565] Where on earth have I wandered in my wretchedness?\n\nOh, oh! Aah! Aah!\n\nA gadfly, the ghost of earth-born Argus, is stinging me again! Keep him away, Earth! I am afraid when I see visions of that hundred-eyed herdsman. He still has his shifty gaze on me. [570] Even though he is dead, his spirit is not buried. He hounds me and drive me, starving and wretched, along the seashore.\n\n[575] The clear strains from the shepherd's [pb_glossary id=\"641\"]Argus[/pb_glossary] wax-bound pipes try to lull me to sleep. Ah! Ah! Where is this wandering taking me?\n\nAlas, alas! Where is my far-roaming wandering course taking me?How have I offended you, Zeus, such that you have bound me [580] to this yoke of misery—aah! What transgression have I committed to make you harass me like this– terrorizing me with a stinging gadfly? Burn me on the pyre, bury me in the earth, feed me to the monsters of sea, if you must, but grant me this one request! I have learned enough from my wandering. I do not know how to escape this suffering! Can you hear the voice of the horned maiden?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nHow can I not hear the girl driven to madness by the gadfly, the [590] daughter of Inachus? She is the one who inflames Zeus's heart with lust, and who now, because of Hera's hatred, is forced to wander endlessly.\n\nIO:\n\nHow do you know my father? Who are you?[595] How do you know my name? Tell me! Ah, I'm so unfortunate! So wretched and miserable! How do you know about this god-sent plague that is causing me to waste away, stinging me with its maddening goad? Ahhh! I come leaping crazily, [600] driven by hunger, the victim of Hera's machinations. Who, of all those who suffer– ahh! ahh!– suffers like me? Tell me [605] what more I must endure! What remedy or cure for my affliction! If you know, tell me! Tell the unfortunate, wandering girl.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI will tell you plainly and simply what you want to know [610]. I won't speak inscrutably or tell riddles. It is best to speak openly to friends. Look at me. I am Prometheus, the one who gave fire to humans.\n\nIO:\n\nBut why, as a benefactor of humans, do you suffer like this?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[615] I have just finished cataloguing and bemoaning my own hardships.\n\nIO:\n\nSo you won't do this favour for me?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWay what you want; I can tell you anything.\n\nIO:\n\nWho has chained you up in this ravine?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIt was Zeus's order, but Hephaestus's hand.\n\nIO:\n\n[620] And what was your crime?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI've said enough.\n\nIO:\n\nNo! Tell me also about the end of my wandering. When will it come?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIn your case, it's better to not know.\n\nIO:\n\n[625] Please, don't hide my future suffering from me.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIt's not that I don't want to tell you.\n\nIO:\n\nThen why your reluctance?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI'm willing; but I don't want to crush your spirit.\n\nIO:\n\nDon't be kinder to me than I am to myself.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[630] Since you insist, I'll say. Listen.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nWait! Allow us some enjoyment too. First let us ask her about her affliction and let her tell us herself the events that transpired and brought about this misery.\n\nThen you can tell her what she has left to face in the future.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[635] It's up to you, Io. They are your father's sisters. And it is worthwhile to indulge in tears over your bad luck, when you are likely to have a sympathetic ear.\n\nIO:\n\n[640] I can't say no. I will tell the truth about everything you ask. But I am ashamed to talk about this god-sent storm: the ruin of my body, and where it came from, swooping down on wretched me.\n\n[645] Night visions, always haunting my bedchamber, tried to beguile and seduce me, saying, \"Lucky girl, why do you stay a virgin, when you could have the most powerful lover? Zeus is inflamed with lust [650] for you and is eager to lay with you. Do not resist his advances, my child. Go to the meadow of Lerna, the land of deep pastures, where your father keeps his sheep and feeds his cattle, so that the eye of Zeus may may have some relief from its craving.”\n\n[655] This dream haunted me night after night, until I worked up the courage to tell my father about it. He sent many messengers to the oracles at Delphi and Dodona to try to find out [660] what he could say or do to please the gods. But they all returned with strangely worded oracles, riddling and obscure. Finally, my father received a clear, unmistakable command: [665] he was to banish me from my home and native land and I was to wander to most remotes limits of the earth. If he did not, Zeus would send a fiery thunderbolt to destroy his whole race.\n\nObeying this prophetic proclamation from Apollo, [670] he drove me out and barred from his house. He wish it and neither did I, but Zeus had placed a yoke of necessity on him, forcing him to act.\n\nImmediately I was disfigured, as you can see. Horns grew on my forehead, and [675] I rushed, stung by a sharp-fanged gadfly, leaping in frantic bounds to Cerchnea's sweet stream and Lerna's spring. But the earth-born herdsman, Argus, pursued me with unbounded rage, tracking my steps with his many eyes. [680] Suddenly and unexpectedly he died, but I am still tormented by the gadfly. It drives me from land to land, a god-sent plague.\n\nThat is what happened. If you know what troubles are coming, tell me. Don't try [685] to soothe me with lies because you pity me. Lying is the foulest sickness.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nAh! Ah! I never thought I would hear such strange things, [690] suffering so great to see and so great to endure. I feel like I have been struck with a two-pronged goad. Ah! Fate! Fate! [695] I shudder at Io's plight.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYou weep and shudder too soon. Wait until you hear the rest.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nGo on, tell us everything. The sick can take comfort in knowing what pain is still coming.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[700] You got what you first asked for– to hear about her ordeal from Io herself. Now listen to the rest: what she is fated to endure further at Hera's hand. [705] And you, Io, take my words to heart, so that you may learn how your wanderings will end.\n\nFirst, from here, turn towards the rising sun and make your way over the untilled plains. You will reach the Scythian nomads, who live [710] in thatched houses, on top of strong-wheeled wagons, and who carry powerful bows. Don't go near them, but stick to the rugged shore, where the roaring sea breaks, and pass beyond their land. From there, on your left you will find the country of the iron workers, [715] the Chalybes, . Beware of them. They are savage and should not be approached by strangers. Then you will reach the river Hybristes, whose name is appropriate. Do not cross this. It is too hard. Wait until you come to the Caucasus, highest of mountains,[720] from whose brow the river pours out in mighty fury. You must cross the crest of the mountain, which reachers up to the stars, and head southward. You will come to the Amazons, who loathe all men. In the future, they will [725] inhabit Themiscyra, near the Thermodon river, where, in front of the sea, is the rugged jaw of the city of Salmydessus.' It is an enemy to sailors and a step-mother to ships. The Amazons will happily guide you on your way. Next, at the narrow port of the harbour, you will reach [730] the Cimmerian isthmus. You must be brave and leave this place and pass through the channel of Maeotis. Forever afterwards, people will talk about your passing, and it will be called the Bosporus after you. Then you will leave Europe [735] and come to the continent of Asia.\n\nDoesn't it seem to you that the tyrant of the gods is violent in everything that he does? For this god, wanting to have sex with this mortal girl, has imposed these wanderings on her. My dear, you have gained a cruel suitor [740]. Everything that you have just heard– understand– is only the beginning of your trouble.\n\nIO:\n\nAh! Ah!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWhat! Are you crying again? Just wait until you hear the rest.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[745] Can it really be that you have more to tell her?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, a tempestuous sea of calamitous distress.\n\nIO:\n\nThen what point is there in living? What shouldn't I just throw myself off this cliff, so that I can be free [750] all my sufferings? It is better to die once and for all than to spend my days prolonging my misery.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nAh, you would find hard to endure what I have to. I am not destined to die. Though death would have freed me from my misery. [755] But there will be no limit to my suffering until Zeus is thrown from power.\n\nIO:\n\nWhat! Zeus will one day be thrown from power?!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYou, I think, would be glad to see that happen.\n\nIO:\n\nWhy now? It is at Zeus's hand that I suffer?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[760] Then be reassured that it will happen.\n\nIO:\n\nWho will strip him of his power?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nHe himself and his own empty-headed purposes.\n\nIO:\n\nHow? Tell me, please, if there is no harm in telling.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nHe will enter into a marriage that will destroy him.\n\nIO:\n\n[765] With a god or with a mortal? Tell me, if you can.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWhy ask with whom? I cannot speak of this.\n\nIO:\n\nWill his wife dethrone him?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, because she will give birth to a son who will be mightier than his father.\n\nIO:\n\nAnd has he no way to avert this doom?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[770] None except me, if I am released from my bondage.\n\nIO:\n\nWho would release you against Zeus's will?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nIt will be one of your own grandchildren?\n\nIO:\n\nWhat did you say? One of my children will release you from your misery?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes. One from the thirteenth generation of your descendants.\n\nIO:\n\n[775] Your prophecy is hard to understand.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nSo, don't ask about the rest of your sufferings, then.\n\nIO:\n\nDon't offer to me a favour and then withdraw it.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI will tell you one of two things.\n\nIO:\n\nWhat two things? Lay them out and I will choose.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[780] Here's the offer: choose whether you want me to tell you about your future sufferings or about the one who is going to free me.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nPlease tell her one and me the other. Don't keep the story from me! Tell her about her future wanderings, [785] and tell me who will free you. I want to know!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWell, since you insist, I won't refuse. I will tell you everything you want to know. First, I will tell you, Io, about your future, tormented wanderings. Sear it into your mind.\n\n[790] After you cross the stream that connects the two continents, you will turn towards the east, where the sun walks. Then you will cross the surging sea until you reach the Gorgonean plains of Cisthene, where the daughters of Phorcus dwell [ the Graeae ], three ancient maids. [795] They are shaped like swans and they possess one eye and one tooth between them. The sun does not shine on them, and neither does the moon. Close to them are their three sisters, the winged, snake-haired Gorgons, loathed by mankind. [800] No human can look at them and live. Guard against this danger. But now listen to another frightening spectacle. Watch out Zeus's sharp-beaked hounds, who do not bark– the gryphons– and [805] and the one-eyed Arimaspian people, who ride on horses, and who live around the floods of Pluto's stream that flows with gold. Do not approach them. Then you will come to a far-away country with dark-skinned people, who live by the waters of the sun, near the river Ethiope. [810] Follow the banks of this river until you reach the cataract, where the Nile sends forth its sacred, sweet stream from the Bybline mountains. The river will lead you to the land of three-angled Nilotis, where, it is declared, [815] Io, that, at last, you and your children will found your distant colony.\n\nIf any of this is confusing or hard to understand, just say so. I will repeat it. For I have more time available than I want.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nIf there is anything left or left out [820] about her dreadful wandering, say it. But if you have told us everything, than grant us the favour that we asked. Surely you remember it.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nShe has now heard everything up to the end of her travels. In addition, so that she knows that what I have said will come to pass, [825] I will describe the toils she endured before she came here, as proof that I know what I am talking about.\n\nI will pass over most of the weary tale, picking it at the end of your wanderings.\n\nWhen you reached the Molossian plains [830] and the sheer mountain ridge that encircles Dodona. There, in that place, is the oracle of Thesprotian Zeus, and the marvelous talking oak trees. They greeted you clearly as Zeus's famous [835] bride-to-be. Did that please you? then, stung by the gadfly, you rushed along the seaside path to the great gulf of Rhea, where you were driven back on your course. From that point on and forever in the future, that sea [840] will be called \"Ionian\" in memory of your crossing.\n\nThis, then, is evidence that I know more than I have shown. Now I will tell you all the rest, [845] picking up where I left off before.\n\nThere is a city called Canobus at the mouth of the Nile. There at last Zeus restores your sanity with a touch of his soft hand. [850] You will give birth to a dark skinned child, Epaphus, named for his conception. He will harvest the crops from all the land that is watered by the broad-flowing Nile. But in the fifth generation after him, fifty young women [the Danaids] will return to Argos, [855] fleeing unwanted marriages with their cousins. And the cousins will pursue them like falcons hunting doves, hearts on fire with lust, seeking unlawful marriages. But Zeus will prevent the marriages from being consummated. [860] The city of Argos will provide a home for the young women, where, in the middle of the night, each woman will slay her new husband, a daring deed done by a woman's hand. Each bride will take her husband's life, staining a two-edged sword with his blood. I wish Love would visit my enemies in the same way! [865] But one of the women will be overcome by her own desire. [pb_glossary id=\"1191\"]Hypermnestra[/pb_glossary] not to slay her groom. She will lose her resolve and decide to be called coward rather than murderer. So she will give birth to a royal line in Argos. [870] It would take a long story to explain all of this, but from her line there will be born a bold man [pb_glossary id=\"1591\"]Heracles[/pb_glossary], famous with the bow, who will free me from these toils. This is the oracle that my mother, the Titan Themis, told me, she who was born a long time ago. [875] How it will happen would take a long speech for me to tell you, and there wouldn't be any benefit in it.\n\nIO:\n\nOh! Oh! Ah! Pain and frenzy strike my brain with their invisible flames. I am stung by the gadfly's barb. [880] My heart knocks against my ribs in terror and by eyeballs roll wildly around and around. Madness drives me off course. I've lost control of my tongue [885] and a stream of turbid words beats recklessly against the billows of dark destruction.\n\nIo exits.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nHe was wise indeed who first thought and spoke this truth: [890] it is best to marry within one's own class. A poor man should not seek to marry among the wealthy or noble.\n\nImmortal Fates! [895] I pray that I am never a partner in the bed of Zeus and that I never have a groom who has descended from heaven. I shudder when I see the virgin Io, loveless and crushed [900] by her Hera-sent wanderings.\n\nI don't think marriage is anything to be feared when it is on equal terms. So I hope that no mightier gods cast their inescapable glances of lust on me. That would be a war impossible to fight and a source of resourceless misery. [905] I don't know what my fate would be, for I don't see how I could escape the designs of Zeus.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nThe day will come when Zeus, with his stubborn soul, will be humbled. He plots a union that will [910] hurl him from his sovereignty and throne into oblivion. The curse his father Cronus uttered as he fell from his ancient throne will be utterly fulfilled . None of the gods can show him how to escape his ruin except for me. [915] I know the way and means. So let him sit there in his self-assurance, trusting in his thunder and lightening bolt. They will not save him from shameful ruin. [920] He is preparing quite an adversary, despite himself, a prodigy, one who will find a flame mightier than lightening, and a deafening crash to outroar the thunder. A prodigy who will make [925] Poseidon's trident, that scourge of the sea and shaker of the land, shiver with fear. Then, wrecked upon this evil, Zeus will learn how different it is to be a ruler and a slave.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nSurely this is wishful thinking on your part, that you utter as a curse against Zeus.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWhat I have said will happen and it will be what I want.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[930] Should we really look out for someone to conquer Zeus?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYes, and he will bear pains more humiliating than mine on his neck.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nHow are you not afraid to taunt Zeus like this?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWhy should I be afraid? I am immortal.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nBut he might give you a punishment even worse than this.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[935] Let him, for all I care! I am prepared for anything.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nThey are wise who honour Necessity.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nWorship, adore, and fawn upon whoever is your lord. But I care less than nothing for Zeus Let him do his will, let him hold his power [940] for his little day. He will not hold sway over the gods for long. But look– over there I see his messenger, the servant of our new lord and master. He has surely come to announce some news.\n\nEnter Hermes\n\nHERMES:\n\nYou! I speak to you, you clever and crafty thief, you bitter wretch, [945] who has dishonoured the gods by stealing fire and giving it to mortals. Father Zeus orders you to say what marriage you boast of, which will cast him out of power. Tell me clearly and pointedly exactly as the case stands, [950] without games and riddles. Zeus gets angry at cryptic replies, so don't make me come back here again!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYou speech is oh so brave and swollen with pride, as befits a little minion of the gods. [955] You are young, as is your power. Do you think that you are untouchable, beyond the reach of grief? I seen two rulers cast out from these heights. I will leave to see a third, this present lord, cast out swiftly in shameful ruin. Do you think [960] I tremble before these upstart gods? Far from it. Not at all. Scurry back the way you came. You will get no answers from me.\n\nHERMES:\n\nIt was this same proud willfulness that earlier [965] brought you to this harbour of distress.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI wouldn't trade my hard fate for your servitude.\n\nHERMES:\n\nIt is no doubt better to serve this rock than to be the trusted messenger of Father Zeus!\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[970] It is fitting for the insolent to offer insults.\n\nHERMES:\n\nI think you revel in your present plight.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nRevel? Oh, I wish that I might see my enemies revelling in this way! And I count you too among them.\n\nHERMES:\n\nWhat! You blame me in some way for your calamities?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[975] Put simply, I hate all the gods that benefitted at my hands and pay me back with so unjustly.\n\nHERMES:\n\nYour words declare you mad.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nI may be mad—if it is madness to loathe one's enemies.\n\nHERMES:\n\nIf you were fortunate, you would be unbearable.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[980] Argh!\n\nHERMES:\n\n“Argh”? That is a word unknown to Zeus.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nBut ever-aging Time teaches all things.\n\nHERMES:\n\nBut you haven't even learned how to be moderate yet.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nOr else I would not have spoke to you, an underling.\n\nHERMES:\n\nIt seems that you will answer none of Father Zeus' demands.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[985] But there is actually much that owe him.\n\nHERMES:\n\nYou tease me as though I were a child.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nAren't you a child and even more foolish than a child if you expect to learn anything from me? And are you not a child and even more witless than a child if you expect to learn anything from me? There is no torment or device by which [990] Zeus will induce me to divulge what I know until he removes these injurious bonds. Let him hurl his blazing lightning and let the whole world convulse with white-winged blizzards and rumbling earthquakes. [995] None of this will convince me to tell him at whose hands he is fated to be hurled from his rule.\n\nHERMES:\n\nDoes this course really seem wise to you?\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nThis course was foreseen and determined a long time ago.\n\nHERMES:\n\nSubmit! Submit, you fool! Be wise [1000] in the face of your present sufferings.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\nYou harass me in vain. It is as though you were trying to persuade a wave. Know that fear of the will of Zeus will not give me a womanish mind. Nor will I ape women's ways, turning my hands upwards and begging my enemy to release me from these bonds. As if!\n\nHERMES:\n\nI think any more speaking will be useless. My entreaties do not soothe or soften you. You take the bit in your teeth like a new-harnessed [1010] colt and struggle against the reins. But your vehemence is useless. Stubborn people who are in the wrong profit less than those who are not stubborn at all. But if my words cannot persuade you, [1015] think about what a storm and a towering wave of inescapable woe will break over you. First, Father Zeus will shatter this jagged cliff with thunder and lightning, and will bury you, while the rock still holds you clasped in its embrace. [1020] Once a long stretch of time has gone by, you will return to the light of day. Then the winged hound of Zeus, the ravening eagle, coming as an uninvited feaster for the whole day, will tear your body, piece by piece with his savage appetite, and feast his fill [1025] on your liver until it is black with the gnawing.\n\nExpect no end to your agony until some god appears, who, sympathizing with you, will take it upon himself to descend into the sunless realm of Death and the dark depths of Tartarus.\n\n[1030] Consider yourself warned. This is not an idle boast, but the utter truth. For the mouth of Zeus does not know how to utter lies, but will bring every word to pass. Consider carefully and reflect. Never deem [1035] stubbornness better than wise counsel.\n\nCHORUS:\n\n[Hermes seems to finally say something useful; for he urges you to put your stubbornness aside and be wise. Take heed! It is shameful for the wise to persist in error.\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[1040] This fellow's ruckus is not news to me. But for an enemy to suffer at the hands of an enemy is not disgraceful. So therefore, let the forked curl of lightning be cast upon my head and let the sky [1045] be convulsed with thunder and the wrack of savage winds; let the hurricane shake the earth from its rooted base, and let the waves of the sea mingle the courses [1050] of the stars in heaven with their savage surge; let him lift me up high and hurl me down to black Tartarus with the swirling floods of stern Necessity. Whatever he does, he cannot kill me.\n\nHERMES:\n\nThese are the thoughts and words [1055] of a madman. How is this any different from raving? Where does his frenzy end? In any case, all you who sympathize with his anguish, [1060] withdraw from this spot quickly, so that the relentless roar of the thunder does not stun your senses.\n\nCHORUS:\n\nTry some other tack or urge me on some other course that is more convincing, because [1065] what you have said is unacceptable. How can you tell me to be a coward? I will suffer any fate along with him. I have learned to detest traitors and there is no pest [1070] I abhor more than this.\n\nHERMES:\n\nWell then, remember my warning and do not blame fate when you are in trouble. And do not say that it was Zeus who unexpectedly caused you [1075] to suffer. You will have only yourself to blame. You have been warned and it will not be suddenly or secretly that you are entangled in the inextricable net of calamity due to your own foolishness.\n\nExit Hermes\n\nPROMETHEUS:\n\n[1080] His word has turned into deed! Ah! The earth rocks! The thunder from the depths of Ocean rolls roaring past me. The fiery ringed lightening flashes forth! Whirlwinds toss the [1085] swirling dust. Wind blasts leap forth in hostile fury and strife. The sky is mixing. with the ocean. Look! You can can see the storm advancing against me! [1090] Zeus sends it to frighten me. Holy mother! Holy Ether who shines light on the world. Look at the wrongs I suffer!\n\nAmid thunder and lightning Prometheus vanishes from sight; and the daughters of Ocean disappear with him."
