        "text": "Will the new Robert Ludlum thriller you'll be reading this summer really be a Robert Ludlum? Well, the book's jacket will have this wordy irruption: ''Robert Ludlum's 'The Hades Factor' by Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds.'' Will this be pure Ludlum, or something slightly vitiated? Actually, it will be what is called in the packaging business ''line extension,'' which is the attempt to come up with a variation on a known product to expand the franchise. Is a Ludlum a Ludlum if a Lynds did the writing? No, not really.\n\nWhatever. Mr. Ludlum is just the latest of the brand-name -- read, best-selling -- thriller writers to lend their names and credibility, and more, they say, to novels they do not actually write themselves. In this new universe, Tom Clancy, who also collaborates on nonfiction and on CD-ROM games based on the characters he creates, is the McDonald's of author franchising. Clive Cussler and Richard Marcinko were among those who followed, and now Mr. Ludlum has joined the ranks.\n\nMoreover, is any of this misleading? Perhaps not exactly, but the implication is clear that the Clancys, the Cusslers and the Ludlums actually did more than scratch in some sentences here and there.\n\nIt is all economics, naturally. Twenty-five years ago the industry was horrified at the thought that a best-selling writer would create two books a year, one written under a name the public could not identify, thus robbing the book of a valuable selling point.\n\nSo publishers and writers of best-selling novels created a lucrative cycle. The writer would produce one hardcover best seller a year, and at the moment of its publication the author's last-year hardcover best seller would be reissued in paperback, the title thus becoming a cash machine a second time.\n\nWhy not double this, some asked? Well, even writers are human. What flagging author could be expected to write more than one hefty novel a year? Perhaps only Stephen King, who, it should be noted, does not collaborate, or tire, apparently. It should also be marked that Messrs. Clancy, Cussler and Ludlum intend to keep writing, on their own, the series novels that launched their franchises in the first place. (For instance, St. Martin's Press, which is publishing the joint-byline Ludlum trade paperback in June, is also publishing in hardcover this fall the latest international paranoia thriller written alone by Mr. Ludlum, ''The Prometheus Deception.'')\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
