        "text": "With a staggering 500 million copies sold worldwide, Robert Ludlum defined and popularized some of the most recognizable tropes within the thriller and spy fiction literary genres.\n\nWhile his name may not be on everyone’s lips, his works certainly are. His most famous work, the Bourne Trilogy, continues to captivate readers four decades after its inception, while his other works remain in the public eye through numerous adaptations and spinoff stories.\n\nHowever, navigating Ludlum’s immense bibliography can be an overwhelming task—one that grows even more complicated with the inclusion of other writers’ continuations of his series.\n\nIf you’re eager to read Robert Ludlum’s books in order and understand the intricate continuity of his works, you’re in the right place. Read ahead for a comprehensive guide to his bibliography and all the information you need to confidently immerse yourself in his world of crime, conspiracies, and mystery.\n\nRobert Ludlum, His Posthumous Work, and The Ludlum Brand\n\nAll Of Robert Ludlum’s and the Ludlum Brand’s Books In Order\n\nThe Road To Series\n\nThe Matarese Dynasty Series\n\nThe Jason Bourne Series\n\nThe Treadstone Series\n\nThe Covert-One Series\n\nThe Paul Janson Series\n\nStand Alone Books\n\nReading the Robert Ludlum Books In Order Is Easier Than It Seems\n\nRobert Ludlum, His Posthumous Work, and The Ludlum Brand\n\nIn life, Ludlum wrote over 20 novels and created a collection of series that were incredibly well-received by the public and remain some of the most well-known action sagas in popular culture.\n\nHowever, his untimely passing in 2001 left many of his works unfinished or in drafts. As such, Ludlum Entertainment—his state—soon greenlighted the publication of some of his drafts posthumously and later allowed multiple authors to continue his work.\n\nSince then, eleven authors have been authorized to publish works under the Ludlum brand—with his name cited on the cover of the books. Most of these writers have continued Ludlum’s series far beyond his original writing, adding up to 32 published novels, with many more scheduled to come out.\n\nAll Of Robert Ludlum’s and the Ludlum Brand’s Books In Order\n\nThere are two distinctive groups regarding Robert Ludlum’s books—the novels written by Ludlum himself and those penned by multiple authors under his brand name.\n\nTo simplify things, the following list of Robert Ludlum’s books in order is comprehensive and features both categories. In this manner, readers can understand the continuity of his universes while still being able to separate his life’s work from his legacy.\n\nFor convenience, the series will be listed first with the appropriate reading order, while the stand-alone books will be left for last.\n\nThe Road To Series\n\nThe Road To series is a duology written exclusively by Ludlum. However, the first book was published under the pen name Michael Shepherd.\n\nAction-packed yet witty, The Road To series is a comedy that follows General McKenzie Hawkings’s misadventures and his quest for over-the-top revenge after being kicked out of the Army.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Road to Gandolfo 1975 2 📚The Road to Omaha 1992\n\nThe Matarese Dynasty Series\n\nAnother duology by Ludlum, the Matarese Dynasty series, is a set of spy thrillers set during the Cold War. It centers around the Matarese—an international association of assassins responsible for a series of murders that threaten to send the world on the edge of apocalyptic disaster.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 The Matarese Circle 1979 2 The Matarese Countdown 1997\n\nThe Jason Bourne Series\n\nUndoubtedly Ludlum’s most popular series, it follows the titular spy, a man who suffers from amnesia yet has to come to terms with his past, present, and future.\n\nThe original saga written by Ludlum is comprised of three books.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Bourne Identity 1980 2 📚The Bourne Supremacy 1986 3 📚The Bourne Ultimatum 1990\n\nAfter Ludlum’s passing, Eric Van Lustbader continued the Jason Bourne saga with eleven more books.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 4 📚The Bourne Legacy 2004 5 📚The Bourne Betrayal 2007 6 📚 The Bourne Sanction 2008 7 📚The Bourne Deception\n\n2009 8 📚The Bourne Objective\n\n2010 9 📚The Bourne Dominion\n\n2011 10 📚 The Bourne Imperative\n\n2012 11 📚The Bourne Retribution\n\n2013 12 📚The Bourne Ascendancy\n\n2014 13 📚The Bourne Enigma\n\n2016 14 📚The Bourne Initiative\n\n2017\n\nIn 2018, Van Lustbader left the series, and Brian Freeman became the new head writer of the Bourne saga. He has published five novels to date, with more to come.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 15 📚The Bourne Evolution 2020 16 📚The Bourne Treachery 2021 17 📚The Bourne Sacrifice 2022 18 📚The Bourne Defiance 2023 19 📚The Bourne Shadow 2024\n\nThe Treadstone Series\n\nThis is a spinoff derived from the Jason Bourne series. It is published under the Robert Ludlum brand but has no books written by him; Joshua Hood is the sole author.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Treadstone Resurrection 2020 2 📚The Treadstone Exile 2021 3 📚The Treadstone Transgression 2022 4 📚The Treadstone Rendition 2023\n\nThe Covert-One Series\n\nThe Covert-One series is almost entirely postmortem, a collaborative effort between Robert Ludlum and multiple other authors. It follows the titular top-secret agency comprised of high-level experts working against threats moving in the shadows.\n\nThe first three books are written alongside other authors, as listed here.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Hades Factor 2000 2 📚The Cassandra Compact 2001 3 📚The Paris Option 2002\n\nSince then, each subsequent book has been written by different authors.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 4 📚The Altman Code 2003 5 📚The Lazarus Vendetta 2004 6 📚 The Moscow Vector 2005 7 📚 The Arctic Event 2007 8 📚 The Ares Decision 2011 9 📚 The Janus Reprisal 2012 10 📚 The Utopia Experiment 2013 11 📚 The Geneva Strategy 2015 12 📚 The Patriot Attack 2015\n\nThe Paul Janson Series\n\nThis series follows the titular hero, a man on the run after a mission goes wrong, and he uncovers deadly conspiracies. The first book in the series, The Janson Directive, was published posthumously.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Janson Directive 2002\n\nTen years later, the book became a series under the Ludlum brand by writer Paul Garrison, who has written three more books in the series to date.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 2 📚The Janson Command 2012 3 📚The Janson Option 2014 4 📚The Janson Equation 2015\n\nStand Alone Books\n\nThe following books are self-contained stories not connected to any other sagas within Ludlum’s creative universe; therefore, you are not required to read them in order.\n\nBook Title 📚📘📕 Year 📅 1 📚The Scarlatti Inheritance 1971 2 📚The Osterman Weekend 1972 3 📚The Matlock Paper 1973 4 📚Trevayne 1973 5 📚The Cry of the Halidon 1974 6 📚The Rhinemann Exchange 1974 7 📚The Gemini Contenders 1976 8 📚The Chancellor Manuscript 1977 9 📚The Holcroft Covenant 1978 10 📚The Parsifal Mosaic 1982 11 📚The Aquitaine Progression 1984 12 📚The Icarus Agenda 1988 13 📚The Scorpio Illusion 1993 14 📚The Apocalypse Watch 1995 15 📚The Prometheus Deception 2000 16 📚The Sigma Protocol 2001 17 📚The Tristan Betrayal 2003 18 📚The Ambler Warning 2005 19 📚The Bancroft Strategy 2006\n\nReading the Robert Ludlum Books In Order Is Easier Than It Seems\n\nAs overwhelming as Ludlum’s books can be, their lack of crossovers or prequels means that reading them in order can be an uncomplicated ordeal that does not require jumping back and forth.\n\nHowever, remember that as self-contained as his adventures are, all his series build up on the content of the previous entry, so reading them in order is the best way to explore the world of action and conspiracy he and his heirs have crafted."
