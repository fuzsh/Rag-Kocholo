        "text": "DECEPTION\n\nTranscript: DECEPTION Iago's deceit escalated with every lie and resulted with the ones who trusted him most dead. THANK YOU! Iago said this during his first scam. This is the next big step of deceit Iago took in order to destroy Othello. This scam resulted in Cassio losing his career while Iago became closer with Othello. Iago: \" Were I the Moor I would not be Iago. In following him I follow but myself; Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, But seeming so for my peculiar end. For when my outward action doth demonstrate the native act and figure of my heart in compliment extern, ’tis not long after but I will wear my heart upon my sleeve for daws to peck at. I am not what I am.\" (I.i.57–65) Act 1 Scene 1 Lines 54-62 How Iago's lies snowballed into an infectious poison that killed innocent lives. Lodovico is telling Iago that he is an evil man and that he should look at the suffering he has caused due to his deceit. Iago: \"Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousIt is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger,but, oh, what damnèd minutes tells he o'er who dotes, yet doubts— suspects, yet soundly loves! Act 3 Scene 3 lines 167-172 Iago's lies are beginning to pile up and he says it with ease. Iago: \"I do not know. Friends all but now, even now, in quarter, and in terms like bride and groom divesting them for bed. And then, but now, as if some planet had unwitted men, Swords out, and tilting one at other’s breasts in opposition bloody. I cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds, and would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it.\" Act 2 Scene 3 lines 169-177 The photo above shows how Iago is whispering Othello's greatest fears in his ear. As a result Othello is suffering tremendously. Iago composes a terrible lie to push Othello into insanity. Knowing that Othello will not be able to control his anger. Iago: In sleep I heard him say \"Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary, let us hide our love!\" And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, cry \"O sweet creature!\" then kiss me hard, as if he plucked up kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips, laid his leg o'er my thigh, and sigh, and kiss, and then cry \"Cursèd fate that gave thee to the Moor!\" Act 3 Scene 3 lines 418-426 Emilia telling Othello of how she gave Iago the strawberry embroidered handkerchief. In Conclusion... The image below represents the illusion of adultery that Iago explained to Othello. This image represents how Othello's vision is clouded with jealousy. Emilia: \"O thou dull Moor! That handkerchief thou speak’st of I found by fortune and did give my husband. For often, with a solemn earnestness—more than indeed belonged to such a trifle—he begged of me to steal it.\" Act 5 Scene 2 Lines 231-234 This lie gave Othello physical \"proof\" that Desdemona was having an affair. Iago went to great lengths to achieve that level of deceit. to create that \"proof\". Iago stages the final piece of proof to force Othello into a murderous state. Lodovico: \"O Spartan dog, more fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea, look on the tragic loading of this bed. This is thy work. The object poisons sight, let it be hid.\" Act 5 Scene 2 Lines 367-370 The snake represents Iago and how everyong sees him. I chose this image of Iago because it shows how Iago stirs up drama, then sits back and enjoys the show he created. Iago: \"I know not, that; but such a handkerchief- I am sure it was your wife-did I today see Cassio wipe his beard with.\" Act 3 Scene 4 lines 437-439 This quote shows Iago's dark side before he commits his crimes. He is confirming that he will be deceitful towards the Moor. This is how the snowball of lies began. This image represents how the handkerchief fell into the wrong hands. Cassio is not the only one laughing, so is Iago. This photo shows how Iago is at Othello's side and is gradually gaining his trust. Iago has gained complete control over Othello through jealousy and deceit. Emilia exposes Iago's deception towards Othello with the shocking truth. Iago has told Othello about his suspicions and is urging him not to be jealous. But this is a form of reverse psychology and he is burying the seed of fear in Othello's mind Pinocchio represents how Iago's lies are piling up. Iago: \"I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth than it should do offense to Micheal Cassio; yet I persuade myself to speak the truth shall nothing wrong him.\"Act 2 Scene 3 Lines 211-214 The mask represents how Iago will be putting on a fake persona of a trustworthy friend. Iago: \"I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin and let him find it. Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ. This may do something.The Moor already changes with my poison.Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons which at the first are scarce found to distaste,but with a little act upon the blood burn like the mines of sulfur.\" Act 3 Scene 3\n\nDeception\n\nTranscript: LADY MACBETH “ I have drugged their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die.” (ACT 2 SCENE 2 Paragraph 1 line 8) \" Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe Upon a dwarfish thief.\" - Angus Scene 2 lines 20-22 Angus is saying that Macbeth is very small and cant fit the part of a king. Macbeth deceived everyone by making everyone believe that he was a great king and that he was not the person who murdered the king by framing Duncan's sons. The plotting of Duncans death. “So is he mine; and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near’st of life. And though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down. And thence it is, That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons” (Macbeth, act 3, scene 1, lines 119-129) This is an act of deception on Macbeth’s part because he is explaining to himself that he needs to kill Banquo secretly otherwise mutual friends of theirs that he needs will turn against him. This is an act of deception because Macbeth istelling banquo if he helps with whatever he asks he will make an honour for him. But instead he kills him. “Were the graced person of our Banquo present, Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance.” (Macbeth, act 3 scene 4, lines 43-45) This is an act of deception of Macbeth’s part because he is lying to the party guests about Banquos whereabouts, making it seem as though he has nothing to do with Banquos absence. \"Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.\" -Messenger Scene 5. lines 36-37 Macbeth's messenger is telling him that he seems to see a moving forest about 3 miles away from the castle. The English army is decieving Macbeth and his messenger by carrying the branches to Birnam wood in front of them, giving off the impression from far away that a forest is moving their way. LADY MACBETH “Woe, alas! What, in our house?” (ACT SCENE 3 PAGE 5) Macbeth Motif Project verbal and actions of deception to secure Macbeth's throne and to make it last MACBETH “If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you” (ACT 2 SCENE 1 PAGE 2) MACBETH “Being unprepared, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought” (ACT 2 SCENE 1 Last paragraph line 17) This is an example of deception because lady Macbeth is saying the drunk guards are set up to take the blame of Duncans death. She had put so many drugs in their drink so they would not wake up. Do to being passed out when they were supposed to be guarding Duncans room. They could easily be put to blame for what her and her husband have done. Elements of Deception \"Our castle’s strength. Will laugh a siege to scorn\" - Macbeth Scene 5. lines 2-3 Macbeth is telling everyone that his castle is strong enough to defend them from the English army without a doubt. He is deceving the people in his castle because his castle will not be strong enough to defend them and himself Macbeth towards his followers “Apply to Banquo; present him eminence, Both with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are.” (Macbeth, act 3, scene 2, lines 33-37) This is an act of deception on Macbeth’s part because he is explaining to Lady Macbeth that they should flatter Banquo to the party guests in order to hide their true intentions of killing him. Theme Statement: “Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches? Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self. This I made good to you In our last conference, passed in probation with you, How you were borne in hand, how crossed, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say, “Thus did Banquo.”” (Macbeth, act 3, scene 1, lines 77-89) This is an act of deception on Macbeth’s part because he is trying to trick the murderers into killing Banquo by convincing them that Banquo is evil and he is good. By Jack, Charl, and Hannah This is an example of deception because Lady Macbeth is acting like she had no idea of the crime of Duncans death happened in her house when really she was the one who committed it. “We hear our bloody cousins are bestowed In England and in Ireland, not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention” (Macbeth, act 3, scene 1, lines 31-34) This is an act of deception on Macbeth’s part because he is covering up his murder of King Duncan by framing Malcolm and Donalbain, who have both fled the country. The Murder of Banquo This is an act of deception because Macbeth is saying he isn't prepared to"
