        "text": "I decided to do an experiment with OpenAI's GPT-4. I wanted to see if I could use it to get a complete inventory of all of our books. We have a lot, even though over the past five years we got rid of 2/3rds of them. That is, I think we still have 10 bookcases.\n\nMy experiment was going to be in three phases:\n\n1. Take a picture of one shelf, and have GPT-4 tell me the author and title of each book. I was hopeful that this would work, but not sure, and this is the critical part. I also knew I could have it put that information into a spreadsheet for later.\n\n2. Given a list of books by a specific author, tell me what books we don't have. Preferences to series that could be incomplete. Given its ability to search via Bing, I was confident that this part would work well.\n\n3. Given the complete list, recommend books and authors that I might like. I know that Amazon does this, but in general I think their recommendations are very superficial. I'm hoping it would recommend an author I've never heard of but fit in well with many of the genre series I like (or Elaine likes).\n\nThe results? I couldn't even get past step 1.\n\nWith a picture of an entire shelf, it totally made up authors and book titles, even though I told it not to do so. Now, I'm too surprised, as there was a small number of pixels on target (letters).\n\nHowever, when I took a close up image, it did a lot better, but still made up results. Even when I tried to correct it, it failed in annoying ways. So while it gets me to an 80% solution, I felt that it still would require too much work on my end to be practical.\n\nBelow, in numbered steps, I'll show what I asked and the results.\n\nI think this is an experiment I'll try again in few months, especially when there is a major upgrade.\n\n#1\n\nHere is the prompt I entered and the response: I'm going to give you an image of two rows from my bookshelf. I would like you to scan the image and give me a list of all the books by author and title and put them in a spreadsheet that I can download. Do not make up any of the names of the books author or title. If you don't know, say so. You can also search the internet to try to figure out what they are if you can only read partial stuff. This might be too hard for your capabilities, I'm doing an experiment to see if this will work. If the text is too small, I can take more pictures and load them in separately. Do you understand and have any questions or clarifications before I upload the image?\n\nChatGPT\n\nI understand your request. Please go ahead and upload the image of your bookshelf. If the text on the spines of the books is clear enough, I'll be able to identify the titles and authors for you. If the text is too small or unclear, you can indeed upload more images for a closer look. I'll do my best to identify them accurately. If there are any books I can't identify, I'll let you know. Once identified, I'll put the information into a spreadsheet for you to download.\n\nFeel free to upload the image when you're ready!\n\n#2\n\nI upload the image.\n\n#3\n\nChatGPT\n\nThank you for uploading the image. I'll now scan the image and list out the books by author and title. Please give me a moment to process this.\n\nHere's the list of books from the image you provided. For any titles or authors that are not fully legible, I have marked them as \"Unknown\":\n\nTop Shelf:\n\n1. Author: John Grisham - Title: The Testament\n\n2.

I will take another look at the image and provide you with the correct information. Please bear with me for a moment.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the image, here is the corrected list with the authors and titles that are visible and legible:\n\n<Gives the same author results with different titles, still totally wrong and made up>\n\n#5\n\nMe: Again, your got it completely wrong. The primary author of the top shelf is Robert b Parker, and the bottom shelf is Nagio Marsh.\n\nChatGPT\n\nI apologize for the inaccuracies. Due to the limitations of my current capabilities, I'm unable to accurately transcribe the small text on the book spines from the image. If you can provide the titles and authors, I can certainly help put them into a spreadsheet for you.\n\n#6\n\nMe: That is fine, seeing it at a distance could still be a problem. Let me test you on this image\n\n#7 (It got all of the books right, but missed the left most one and didn't note that)\n\nChatGPT\n\nThank you for providing a clearer image. Based on this image, here is the information for the Ngaio Marsh books visible:\n\n1. Title: Night at the Vulcan\n\n2. Title: Spinsters in Jeopardy\n\n3. Title: Death of a Fool\n\n4. Title: Singing in the Shrouds\n\n5. Title: False Scent\n\n6. Title: Hand in Glove\n\n7. Title: Dead Water\n\nThe author for all the books listed is Ngaio Marsh. I will now create a spreadsheet with this information for you to download. Please give me a moment to prepare the file.\n\nThe spreadsheet with the Ngaio Marsh books listed is now ready for download:\n\n[Ngaio Marsh Books Spreadsheet](sandbox:/mnt/data/Ngaio_Marsh_Books.csv]\n\n#8\n\nMe: For the moment, let's not do spreadsheets for download. I am still trying to test your capabilities. Let's try a totally new row\n\n#9\n\nChatGPT\n\nBased on the provided image, here are the titles of the books by Laurie R. King visible on the shelf:\n\n1. Locked Rooms\n\n2. The Game\n\n3. A Monstrous Regiment of Women\n\n4. A Letter of Mary\n\n5. The Beekeeper's Apprentice\n\n6. The Moor\n\n7. The Art of Detection\n\nAll these titles are part of Laurie R. King's Mary Russell series. If you need further assistance or another row of books, feel free to let me know.\n\n#10\n\nMe: One of those is incorrect, do you know which one?\n\nChatGPT\n\nYes, upon re-examination, \"The Art of Detection\" is not part of the Mary Russell series by Laurie R. King; it belongs to a different series featuring the character Kate Martinelli. The rest of the titles listed are indeed from the Mary Russell series. My apologies for the confusion. If there are any more tasks or any other way I can assist you, please let me know.\n\n#11\n\nMe: That is correct but also one of the titles you gave is incorrect. Do you know which one? <I didn't check if the above was correct, as I was more interested in the book \"The Moor\", which was not in the image>\n\nChatGPT\n\nUpon closer inspection, the correct titles from the image provided are:\n\n1. Locked Rooms\n\n2. The Game\n\n3. A Monstrous Regiment of Women\n\n4. The Moor (previously misidentified as \"A Letter of Mary\")\n\n5. The Beekeeper's Apprentice\n\n6. Justice Hall (previously misidentified as \"The Moor\")\n\n7. The Art of Detection (not part of the Mary Russell series)\n\nThe title \"A Letter of Mary\" was mistakenly included instead of \"Justice Hall.\" I apologize for the error.\n\n#12\n\nMe: Just so you know, a letter for Mary was correct. The more was the wrong one and that doesn't exist in the picture. I think I see the problem, the leftmost book doesn't have the title in the image which makes it hard to read. My apologies, as only the author is shown\n\nChatGPT:\n\nI appreciate the clarification. With the new information and omitting the leftmost book where only the author's name is visible, here is the corrected list of titles from the image:\n\n1. (Title not visible, only author Laurie R. King)\n\n2. Locked Rooms\n\n3. The Game\n\n4. A Monstrous Regiment of Women\n\n5. A Letter of Mary\n\n6. The Beekeeper's Apprentice\n\n7. Justice Hall\n\n8. The Art of Detection (not part of the Mary Russell series)\n\nThank you for your patience. If you have any more books or rows you would like to identify, please let me know.\n\n#13"
