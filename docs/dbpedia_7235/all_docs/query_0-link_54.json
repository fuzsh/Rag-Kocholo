Subverter in truth For selfish ends you can never reach the Absolute Do you really expect to be Taken so damn seriously? Watch history change in modern books Affecting our perception To idolize a virtual crook Is a well forethought deception You are aiming higher Want to play with fire The feeble you inspire Yes you do Scam in the guise of wisdom You despise just to make the skies Laugh at you A judgement on you is due without a doubt: By a bird of prey you’re going to have Your liver eaten out Now would you still expect to be Taken so damn seriously? Watch history change in modern books Affecting our perception To idolize a virtual crook Is a well forethought deception You are aiming higher Want to play with fire The feeble you inspire Yes you do Scam in the guise of wisdom You despise just to make the skies Laugh at you You are playing with fire\n\n3.\n\nThey Pull The Strings 02:31\n\nThey Pull The Strings ...Pull the strings again!.. Go! I don’t need the latest news to know just how we live: Where there is a scandal it’s easy to forgive They pull the strings and we dance, don’t ask why They make their moves and we fall, left to die I wonder what happens if I just keep my mouth shut, Obey and buy all that they’re offering to me – I might as well give up everything reduced to slavery, Never to be free... What seems to be so charming is rotting inside Make-believe and shallowness, to see this i can’t abide They pull the strings and we dance, don’t ask why They make their moves and we fall, left to die I wonder what happens if I put on a mask of apathy. Just let me see if it really helps to take away the pain - I might as well search for my own paradise on Jeopardy Lane... Wouldn’t it be insane?\n\n4.\n\nDiamond-cutter 02:39"
