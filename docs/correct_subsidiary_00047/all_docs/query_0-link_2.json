        "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Connetics Corporation (NASDAQ:CNCT - News), a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes dermatology products, today announced that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., a privately held company based in Coral Gables, Florida. Upon the closing of the transaction, holders of Connetics’ common stock will receive $17.50 per share in cash, representing a 62% premium to Connetics’ average closing price for the past four weeks. The aggregate value to be received by Connetics’ stockholders is approximately $640 million.\n\nThomas G. Wiggans, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Connetics, said, “The combination of Stiefel and Connetics will create the world’s premier dermatology company with a strong global presence in both branded and generic markets, dozens of marketed products and the most robust development pipeline in the industry. After the combination, Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. will have more than 3,500 employees worldwide, with more than 30 subsidiaries and sales in more than 100 countries.\n\n“This transaction delivers significant value to our stockholders and the combined entity will have substantial resources to bring innovative dermatology products to patients around the globe,” Mr. Wiggans continued. “The combined company will be positioned to continue the growth and build on the extraordinary success experienced by both Connetics and Stiefel. We look forward to putting together two powerful corporate cultures.”\n\nCharles W. Stiefel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Stiefel Laboratories, said, “The combination of Connetics and Stiefel Laboratories demonstrates our continued commitment to be the global leader in dermatology. We are very impressed with the innovative products, cutting-edge technology and talented workforce at Connetics. Our company will have an expansive product portfolio and pipeline for major disease categories across the field of dermatology.”\n\nThe parties anticipate closing the transaction in late 2006 or early 2007. The closing is subject to approval by holders of a majority of Connetics’ outstanding common stock, antitrust clearance and other customary closing conditions. Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as financial advisor to Connetics in connection with the transaction. The transaction was unanimously approved by Connetics’ Board of Directors.\n\nAbout the Transaction\n\nIn connection with the proposed merger, Connetics will file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Investors and security holders are advised to read the proxy statement, when it becomes available, and any other relevant documents filed by Connetics with the SEC because they will contain important information about the proposed merger. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain a free copy of the proxy statement, when available, and other documents filed by Connetics, from the SEC website at www.sec.gov or by contacting Connetics’ investor relations office at (650) 843-2851.\n\nConnetics’ directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Connetics in connection with the transaction. A description of certain of the interests of directors and executive officers of Connetics is set forth in the amended proxy statement for Connetics’ 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 21, 2006.
