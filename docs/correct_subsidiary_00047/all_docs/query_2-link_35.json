        "text": "3. Ratification of the selection, by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of CymaBay for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2023\n\n​​\n\nMajority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter\n\n​​\n\nFor\n\n4. Advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement\n\n​​\n\nMajority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter\n\n​​\n\nFor\n\n•\n\nTo be approved, Proposal 2, the approval of our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, must receive “FOR” votes from the holders of a majority of shares present in person (i.e. virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. If you mark your proxy to “ABSTAIN” from voting, it will have the same effect as an “AGAINST” vote. Broker non-votes will have no effect.\n\n•\n\nTo be approved, Proposal 3, ratification of selection by the Audit Committee of the Board of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of CymaBay for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, must receive “FOR” votes from the holders of a majority of shares present in person (i.e. virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. If you mark your proxy to “ABSTAIN” from voting, it will have the same effect as an “AGAINST” vote. Broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect. Although stockholder ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as CymaBay’s independent registered public accounting firm is not required, the Board is submitting Proposal 3 to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.\n\n•\n\nTo be approved, Proposal 4, the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation for our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, must receive “FOR” votes from the holders of a majority of shares present in person (i.e. virtually) or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. If you mark your proxy to “ABSTAIN” from voting, it will have the same effect as an “AGAINST” vote. Broker non-votes will have no effect.\n\n•\n\nSpecific disclosure of equity award vesting upon a corporate transaction or change in control. The 2023 Plan specifically provides that in the event of a corporate transaction or change in control of CymaBay (each, a “Transaction”), if the surviving or acquiring corporation (or its parent company) does not assume or continue outstanding equity awards under the 2023 Plan, or substitute similar equity awards for such outstanding equity awards, then with respect to any such equity awards that have not been assumed, continued or substituted and that are held by participants whose continuous service has not terminated prior to the Transaction, the vesting of such equity awards will be accelerated in full (and with respect to any performance-based equity awards, vesting will be deemed to be satisfied at the target level of performance).\n\n•\n\nRestrictions on dividends and dividend equivalents. The 2023 Plan provides that no dividends or dividend equivalents may be granted with respect to options or stock appreciation rights and that with respect to other awards: (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid with respect to any shares of our common stock subject to an equity award before the date such shares have vested, (ii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such shares under the terms of the applicable equity award agreement (including any vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to us on the date such shares are forfeited to or repurchased by us due to a failure to vest.\n\n•\n\nLimit on non-employee director compensation. The aggregate value of all cash and equity-based compensation paid or granted by us to any individual for service as a non-employee director of our Board with respect to any fiscal year of CymaBay will not exceed (i) $1,000,000 in total value or (ii) in the event such non-employee director is first appointed or elected to the Board during such fiscal year, $1,500,000 in total value, in each case calculating the value of any equity awards based on the grant date fair value of such equity awards for financial reporting purposes.\n\n1\n\nThe material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference in any filing of CymaBay under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing.\n\n(1)\n\nThese amounts are not cash compensation, but rather the aggregate fair value of the equity compensation granted to our non-employee directors during the fiscal year. The aggregate fair value is computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 23, 2023, regarding assumptions underlying valuation of equity awards. Each non-employee director was granted only one option award in 2022. The option award value for Ms. Dorling, Ms. Loewy, Mr. von Emster, Mr. Wiggans and Dr. Wills was approximately $150,000 on the date upon which the option was granted, as these options were annual options. The option award value for Dr. Lefebvre was approximately $300,000 on the date upon which the option was granted, as this option was an initial appointment option. See “Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy” below for a description of the option awards.\n\n*\n\nAn incentive award is an award that may be settled, at the sole discretion of CymaBay, by either (1) the holder’s purchase of the number of shares of our common stock at the applicable exercise price per share on the date of grant or (2) the holder’s receipt of a cash payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price per share on the date of grant, multiplied by the portion of the award being exercised.\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents the aggregate fair value of options granted for each fiscal year. The options’ shares vest in equal monthly installments over forty-eight months from January 1 of the applicable year, subject to the optionee’s continued employment or service with CymaBay. The options have a maximum term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination in certain situations related to cessation of employment or services. The aggregate fair value is computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed on March 23, 2023, regarding assumptions underlying our valuation of equity awards.\n\n(a)\n\nCompensation Actually Paid excludes the Stock Awards and Option Awards columns from the relevant fiscal year’s Summary Compensation Table total. The Rule 402(v) Equity Values instead reflect the aggregate of the following components, as applicable: (i) the fair value as of the end of the listed fiscal year of unvested equity awards granted in that year; (ii) the change in fair value during the listed fiscal year of equity awards granted in prior years that remained outstanding and unvested at the end of the listed fiscal year; and (iii) the change in fair value during the listed fiscal year through the vesting date of equity awards granted in prior years that vested during the listed fiscal year, less the fair value at the end of the prior year of awards granted prior to the listed fiscal year that failed to meet applicable vesting conditions during the listed fiscal year. Equity values are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, and the valuation assumptions used to calculate fair values did not materially differ from those disclosed at the time of the grant.\n\n•\n\n“cause” means the occurrence of any one or more of the following: (i) conviction of, or plea of no contest, with respect to any felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (ii) participation in a fraud or act of dishonesty that results in material harm to the company; (iii) intentional material violation of any contract or agreement between the executive and the company, including but not limited to their employment letter agreement or their Employee Agreement on Confidential Information and Inventions, or violation of any statutory duty that the executive owes to the company, but only if the executive does not correct any such violation within 30 days after written notice thereof has been provided to the executive (if such notice is reasonably practicable); or (iv) gross negligence or willful neglect of the executive’s job duties, as determined by the Board in good faith, but only if the executive does not correct such violation within 30 days after written notice thereof has been provided to the executive (if such notice is reasonably practicable);\n\n•\n\n“change in control” means an ownership change event (as defined below) or a series of related ownership change events (collectively, a “transaction”) wherein the stockholders of the company immediately before the transaction do not retain direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the company or, in the case of a transaction described in clause (iii) of the “ownership change event” definition, the corporation or other business entity to which the assets of the company were transferred (the “transferee”), as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial ownership includes, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership of the voting securities of one or more corporations or other business entities that own the company or the transferee, as the case may be, either directly or through one or more subsidiary corporations or other business entities;\n\n•\n\nan “ownership change event” is deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs with respect to the company: (i) the direct or indirect sale or exchange in a single or series of related transactions by the stockholders of the company of more than 50% of the voting stock of the company; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the company is a party; or (iii) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company; and\n\n•\n\n“good reason” means any one of the following events that occurs without the executive’s consent: (i) the material reduction in the executive’s responsibilities, authorities or functions as an employee of the company (but not merely a change in reporting relationships); (ii) a material reduction in the executive’s level of compensation (including base salary, fringe benefits and target bonus under any corporate-performance based bonus or incentive programs); (iii) a material change of the executive’s place of employment that results in an increase to the executive’s round trip commute of more than 20 miles; or (iv) the company’s material breach of the executive’s employment letter agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the executive must provide written notice to the General Counsel of the company and the Chief Executive Officer within 30 days after the date upon which such event first occurs, and allow the company 30 days thereafter (the “cure period”) during which the company may attempt to rescind or correct the matter giving rise to good reason. If the company does not rescind or correct the conduct giving rise to good reason to the executive’s reasonable satisfaction by the expiration of the cure period, the executive’s employment will then terminate with good reason as of such thirtieth day.\n\n(1)\n\nThis table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and principal stockholders and Schedules 13D and 13G filed with the SEC.
