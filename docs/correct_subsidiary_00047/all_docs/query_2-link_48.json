        "text": "ALAMEDA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exelixis, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXEL) (the “Company”) today announced that Carl Feldbaum, Esq. and Vincent Marchesi, M.D., Ph.D., two long-standing and valued members of the Board of Directors, will not stand for re-election at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”). As part of its ongoing refreshment program, the Board is recommending Tomas Heyman, current Chief Executive Officer of Interlaken Therapeutics and former President of Johnson & Johnson’s Corporate Venture Capital Group, and Robert Oliver, former President and Chief Executive Officer of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, for election as independent directors at the Company’s Annual Meeting to fill Mr. Feldbaum’s and Dr. Marchesi’s seats.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Messrs. Heyman and Oliver were originally nominated by Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C. (“Farallon”). As part of the Company’s efforts to reach an agreement with Farallon to avoid a proxy contest, in the third week of March numerous members of the Exelixis Board met individually with both candidates to assess their qualifications to serve as members of the Board. The Board subsequently agreed to appoint both Messrs. Heyman and Oliver to the Board as part of a proposed settlement agreement with Farallon. However, Farallon was unwilling to sign an agreement and demanded a highly unusual breadth and depth of access to company confidential and proprietary information as a non-negotiable part of any settlement, including unprecedented access to Exelixis’ pipeline, people and clinical trial data. While the Exelixis Board could not concede to Farallon’s information and access demands, the Board determined at the time of the interviews that Messrs. Heyman and Oliver were excellent candidates for the Board, and the failure of settlement negotiations with Farallon does not in any way affect that view.\n\n“ On behalf of the entire Board, I want to extend my deep appreciation to Carl and Vincent for their many contributions to Exelixis throughout their tenure. Both have been trusted partners and colleagues. Their wisdom and expertise have informed our strategy and have guided us on our path to leadership and value creation,” said Dr. Stelios Papadopoulos, Chairman of Exelixis’ Board of Directors.\n\n“ As we say goodbye to two outstanding leaders, we will ask shareholders to vote for Tomas and Bob as new independent Board members at our upcoming Annual Meeting. Their proposed addition to the Board is part of an ongoing refreshment plan that underscores our commitment to upholding best-in-class corporate governance to ensure we have the right balance of relevant skills and expertise to guide the Company’s continued evolution and long-term strategic plan,” Dr. Papadopoulos continued.\n\n“ Especially as a cancer survivor, I’ve been truly privileged to serve on this highest-caliber Board of scientists, physicians, CEOs and financial experts. Exelixis has an extraordinarily talented and dedicated team, and I anticipate great progress for this remarkable Company in the months and years ahead,” said Mr. Feldbaum.\n\n“ I leave Exelixis with a great sense of pride for the Company we have become and the progress we have made to improve the standard of care for cancer patients and create shareholder value. I look forward to following the progress of this talented team as they strive to develop the next wave of important cancer medicines,” said Dr. Marchesi.\n\nDr. Papadopoulos concluded, “ We are pleased to strengthen the Exelixis Board with new independent directors who embody the important skillsets our Board is looking for as we advance our strategy to become a global, multi-product oncology company. Tomas and Bob are highly respected leaders who bring a deep understanding of the biopharma industry and strong track records of overseeing growth and commercial success. We look forward to benefitting from their insights and expertise as Exelixis delivers innovative treatments for our patients and drives growth and value for shareholders.”\n\nThe Board’s slate for the Annual Meeting will consist of Maria Freire, Alan Garber, Tomas Heyman, Michael Morrissey, Robert Oliver, Stelios Papadopoulos, George Poste, Julie Anne Smith, Lance Willsey, Jacqueline Wright and Jack Wyszomierski. Following the Annual Meeting, the Board will be comprised of 11 directors, 10 of whom are independent and four of whom will have been elected in the last five years. The date of the Annual Meeting has not yet been scheduled.\n\nAbout Tomas Heyman\n\nMr. Heyman currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Interlaken Therapeutics.
