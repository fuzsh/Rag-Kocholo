        "text": "09 August 2007\n\nPartnering with The Blackstone Group provides robust platform for continued growth\n\nCORAL GABLES, Fla. – AUGUST 9, 2007 – Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. announced today that private equity funds of The Blackstone Group have agreed to make a $500 million minority investment in Stiefel Laboratories.\n\n“This is a carefully considered strategy,” company President and CEO Charles W. Stiefel said. “Stiefel Laboratories is on a strong upward trajectory that is sustained by our product development, licensing, and acquisition activities. Taking on a private equity partner increases our ability to accelerate that upward trend.”\n\nThe company considered a number of private equity firms and selected Blackstone through an evaluative process that examined a number of factors, including the compatibility of the two companies.\n\nCharles Stiefel emphasized the opportunities the deal brings to Stiefel Laboratories. “Following this investment, we will be in an even better position to make additional investments in products, technologies and companies,” he said.\n\nThe private equity funds of Blackstone will make a minority investment in Stiefel Laboratories. In connection therewith, Blackstone will have the right to designate for election one member of the company’s board of directors. The investment will be accomplished pursuant to the issuance by Stiefel Laboratories of a new class of preferred stock to the private equity funds of Blackstone. No current shareholders will sell any shares as part of the transaction.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. The closing is expected to occur in the next couple of days.\n\nStiefel Laboratories, the world’s largest independent pharmaceutical company specializing in dermatology, will continue to be privately held, and the Stiefel family will retain control and continue to hold a majority-share ownership of the company.\n\nChinh Chu, Senior Managing Director of Blackstone, commented, “We are excited to invest alongside the Stiefel family. Stiefel Laboratories has a robust and diversified product portfolio across the entire field of dermatology, with numerous pipeline products and international expansion opportunities. We are very impressed with Stiefel’s world-class management team, and we look forward to working with the team to continue the company’s strong growth trajectory.”\n\nBy many indicators, 2007 will be a banner year for Stiefel Laboratories. In addition to commemorating its 160th anniversary, the company celebrated the grand opening of its new research and development facility in Research Triangle Park, N.C., will launch two innovative prescription products using the VersaFoam® technology it acquired through the December 2006 acquisition of Connetics Corporation, and will enter the aesthetic dermatology market with its novel REVALÉSKIN™ skin care products.\n\nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc. acted as exclusive financial advisor and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP acted as legal counsel to Stiefel Laboratories on this transaction. Merrill Lynch & Co. and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP acted as advisors to Blackstone.\n\nAbout Stiefel Laboratories, Inc.\n\nFounded in 1847, Stiefel Laboratories (a privately held company) is the world’s largest independent pharmaceutical company specializing in dermatology.
