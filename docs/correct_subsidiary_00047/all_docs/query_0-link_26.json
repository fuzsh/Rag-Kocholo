        "text": "Barrier Therapeutics, a specialty drugmaker forced to pare back some of its research programs this spring, said yesterday it had agreed to be acquired by a private Florida company for $148 million.\n\nThe offer by Stiefel Laboratories amounts to $4.15 a share for the Princeton firm, which specializes in dermatology products. That represents an impressive 136 percent premium to Barrier's closing price of $1.76 a share Friday, but the stock has been on a downward track for 18 months. In early 2007, it traded at $8.41 a share.\n\nNews of the deal sent Barrier shares up $2.27, to $4.03 at the close of regular trading, an increase of 129 percent.\n\nStiefel is based in Coral Gables, Fla., and focuses solely on skin-care products. It has aggressively pursued acquisitions in recent years, including the $640 million purchase of the California dermatology company Connetics in 2006, and expects to clear $1 billion in sales this year.\n\nNegotiations between the two companies began in April and ended at 1:30 a.m. yesterday, when the merger agreement was signed, said Brent Stiefel, Stiefel Labs' executive vice president of products and development.\n\n\"We've known these guys for years, playing in the same space, and we've always admired them,\" he said.\n\nStiefel plans to commence a tender offer for a majority of Barrier shares, then absorb the company as a wholly owned subsidiary. It's unclear what effect the deal would have on Barrier's 130 employees or its New Jersey headquarters.\n\n\"We certainly have a lot of work to do,\" Stiefel said of integration plans. \"We're digging in as fast as we can to get there.\"\n\nBarrier had $24 million in sales last year, mostly from three dermatology products it has on the market, and expects a big increase in revenue this year. But the company replaced its chief executive earlier this year, and put several of the half-dozen drug candidates it has in its pipeline on hold in April, as it sought partnerships and other sources of funding.\n\nThe pipeline, which includes a treatment for toenail fungus in late-stage development, was a major draw for the Florida company.\n\n\"At the end of the day, this really strengthens our position as a leader in the dermatology field,\" Stiefel said.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter, pending regulatory approval."
