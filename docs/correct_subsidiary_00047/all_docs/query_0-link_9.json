        "text": "Barrier Therapeutics, a Princeton drugmaker that specializes in dermatological creams and gels, has agreed to be acquired by a private South Florida company for $148 million.\n\nThe tender offer by Stiefel Laboratories represents a 135 percent premium to Barrier's closing price Friday of $1.76 a share. If a majority of Barrier shareholders tender their shares, Stiefel will absorb Barrier as a subsidiary. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter.\n\nStiefel was founded in 1847 and focuses solely on dermatology products, such as Duac topical gel and the Revaleskin skin care line. Based in Coral Gables, Fla., it has been expanding steadily through acquisitions, such as the 2006 purchase of Connetics for $640 million.\n\nBarrier shares rose 130 percent to $4.04 a share as of 11:30 a.m."
