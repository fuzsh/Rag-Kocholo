Â§ 119(e) to United States Provisional Application No. 61/248,144 filed October 2, 2009 and entitled\n\n\"Surfactant-Free Water-Free Foamable Compositions, Breakable Foams and Their Uses; United States Provisional Application No. 61/322,148 filed April 8, 2010 and entitled \"Surfactant-Free Water-Free Foamable Compositions, Breakable Foams and Their Uses; United States Provisional Application No. 61/349,911 filed May 31, 2010 and entitled \"Surfactant-Free Water-Free Foamable Compositions, Breakable Foams and Their Uses; United States Provisional\n\nApplication No. 61/385,385 filed September 22, 2010 and entitled \"Surfactant-Free Water-Free Foamable Compositions, Breakable Foams and Gels and Their Uses; United States Provisional Application No. 61/331,126 filed May 4, 2010 and entitled \"Compositions, Gels and Foams with Rheology Modulators and Uses Thereof; and United States Provisional Application No.\n\n61/380,568 filed September 7, 2010 and entitled \"Surfactant-Free Water-Free Foamable\n\nCompositions and Breakable Foams and Their Uses; all of which are herein incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n[0002] Foam compositions with high amounts of hydrophobic solvents are little known in the art.\n\n[0003] Foams and, in particular, oleaginous single -phase foams are complicated systems which do not form under all circumstances. Slight shifts in foam composition, such as by the addition of active ingredients or the removal of any of the essential ingredients, may destabilize the foam.\n\n[0004] The prior art teaches oleaginous foam compositions require significant amounts of surface active agents to form and stabilize a foam. These compositions require various standard surfactants, as essential components.\n\n[0005] Surfactants are known as essential ingredients in foam compositions because of their amphiphilic properties and because they are considered essential in forming a foam. However, many surfactants are known to be irritating when left on the skin, as they can extract lipids from the skin, thereby damaging skin barrier and exposing the skin to contact with pro-inflammatory factors. (See for example: Effendy, I. and Maibach, H.I. \"Surfactants and Experimental Irritant Contact Dermatitis. \" Contact Dermatol., 33 (1995), 217-225). Many surfactants can also react with unstable active agents and lead to their rapid degradation.\n\n[0006] Briefly, the term surfactant has been often loosely used in the art to include substances which do not function effectively as stand alone surfactants to reduce surface tension between two substances or phases. Reduction of surface tension can be significant in foam technology in relation to the ability to create small stable bubbles. In the context herein, the term \"standard surfactant\" or \"customary surfactant\" refers to customary non-ionic, anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and amphiphilic surfactants. Many standard surfactants are derivatives of fatty alcohols or fatty acids, such as ethers or esters formed from such fatty alcohols or fatty acids with hydrophilic moieties, such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG). However, a native (non derivatized) fatty alcohol or fatty acid, or wax are not regarded as a standard surfactant.\n\n[0007] In the context herein the term \"foam adjuvant\" includes only fatty alcohols and fatty acids. These are amphiphatic, and essentially hydrophobic with a minor hydrophilic region. For the purposes of forming an emulsion these foam adjuvants, unlike \"standard\" or \"customary surfactants\", are not effective as stand-alone surfactants in foamable emulsion compositions, because of their very weak emulsifying capacity on their own. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids have been loosely described as co-surfactants in foamable emulsion compositions, because they assist customary surfactants to boost foam quality, help evolve the foaming properties and because they stabilize the foam in part because of their property as thickeners.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0008] The present application relates to foamable formulations and foams and their uses comprising hydrophobic solvents. It further relates to hydrophobic solvents with waxes. In particular it relates to waxes that are solid at room temperature. In addition, it relates to formulation with and without an active agent. Surprisingly, the application also relates to foamable formulations and foam without surfactants; and or without surfactants and foam adjuvants; and or without surfactants and polymeric agents; and or without surfactants and foam adjuvants and polymeric agents. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvents are provided as part of a drug carrier. For example certain drugs require hydrophobic solvents in order to solubilize them. In one or more other embodiments, the hydrophobic solvents are provided to facilitate or enhance the transdermal penetration or delivery of a drug. In one or more additional cases, the formulations are provided to have a water barrier effect at a target site, for example where the site of treatment is a damaged skin and the water barrier effect of\n\nhydrophobic solvents is desirable. In some embodiments the formulation may have some occlusivity. In some embodiments petrolatum is added to achieve or enhance an occlusive effect. The present application further relates to compositions comprising hydrophobic solvents and their uses.\n\n[0009] It is known in the art that foams can easily be formulated based on high amounts of water, in combination with surface active agents, foam adjuvants and polymeric agents. As described in the literature, hydrophobic solvents can have a de-foaming effect which makes the formulation of foams based on hydrophobic solvents - challenging. To overcome this challenge, the prior art requires the use of substantial levels of surfactants that act as efficient foaming agents. The prior art further teaches the incorporation of foam adjuvants, such as fatty alcohols and fatty acids, as foam boosting agents and also the incorporation of polymeric agents (e.g. gelling agents) as foam stabilizers, which can prolong the collapse time of a foam. Waxes may also be introduced into these surfactant based formulations but as will be appreciated, waxes, which are at ambient temperature can easily precipitate. Surface active agents are known to be irritating, especially ionic surface active agents and repeated use can cause dry skin and so it is desirable to reduce their use in pharmaceutical compositions intended to treat skin or mucosa. The technical problems to be overcome in formulating carriers and pharmaceutical compositions with hydrophobic solvent (a) without surfactant; and (b) without surfactant and foam adjuvant; and (c) without polymeric agents and (d) without water are multifold and include finding a suitable substitute for surfactant which provides foam generating properties; finding a suitable replacement that preferably does not need to have a foam adjuvant present with the surfactant (substitute), which if present would inter alia help to boost the foam and as an aid to the surfactant and preferably does not need to have a polymeric agent present with the surfactant (substitute), which if present would inter alia help prolong stability of the foam. It was surprisingly discovered in the present invention, that surface active agents can be advantageously eliminated and replaced by waxes in the context of hydrophobic solvent based- foams. Waxes possess several advantages over other foaming agents such as excellent skin compatibility, almost no chemical reactivity which ensures active ingredients stability and efficient skin occlusion which helps reducing skin water loss and can enhance skin penetration of active agents. Albeit waxes introduce their own additional problems into formulating foamable compositions and foams, including their tendency to solidify and precipitate out from a formulation, and to increase significantly the viscosity of an oleaginous composition, and to block canister valves, against which the formulations need to be designed so that the\n\nformulations are not negatively disturbed upon adding an effective amount of propellant and that the formulations are shakable and are homogenous and can readily reform at least upon mild or reasonable shaking prior to use.\n\n[0010] In one or more embodiments the drug carrier is formulated for use on sensitive target areas such as sensitive or damages skin areas, wounds, burns, mucosal membranes, body cavities and the eye. In one or more embodiments the composition is intended for use in treatment or prevention of eye infections.\n\n[0011] Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of standard surfactants. Also surprisingly it has been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of foam adjuvants (i.e fatty alcohols and fatty acids) known in the art. Further, unexpectedly, it has been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of standard polymeric agents (e.g. gelling agents). Thus, in one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant-free and substantially foam adjuvant-free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more preferred embodiments the oleaginous formulations and foams are free of standard surfactants and foam adjuvants. Thus, in one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant free and substantially polymeric agent free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more preferred embodiments the oleaginous formulations and foams are free of standard surfactants and polymers. Unexpectedly, it has further been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of standard surfactants, foam adjuvants and polymeric agents known in the art. Thus, in one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant free and substantially foam adjuvant free and substantially polymeric agent free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more preferred embodiments the oleaginous formulations and foams are free of surface active agents and foam adjuvants and polymeric agents. Moreover, it has been further discovered that these formulations and foams can be achieved over a large range of hydrophobic solvent content. There is thus provided easy to use, stable and non-irritating topical foam formulations, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, containing a stable or stabilized active pharmaceutical or cosmetic agent having a therapeutic or beneficial effect, intended for treatment of dermal and mucosal tissues free or substantially free of standard surface active agents and foam adjuvants.\n\n[0012] In one or more embodiments there is provided a safe and effective foamable carrier composition and foam comprising a hydrophobic solvent, an oleaginous foaming agent comprising a wax and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the propellant is about 1% to about 30% by weight of the total composition. In other certain embodiments, the concentration of the propellant is about 3% to about 25 % by weight of the total composition; or about 7% to about 17 %; or about 10% to about 14 %. In additional embodiments there is provided a safe and effective foamable pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition and foam comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic active agent, a hydrophobic solvent, a foaming agent comprising of a wax and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant. The percent by weight is based on weight foamable composition; where the ratio of composition other than propellant to propellant is from about 100: 1 to about 100:30; or from about 100:3 to about 100:25; or from about 100:7 to about 100: 17; or from about 100: 10 to about 100:14 The composition does not contain a surfactant or a foam adjuvant; and the foaming effect is achieved by the addition of the foamer agent, as specified herein. The hydrophobic solvent is present in a substantial amount. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent is at a concentration between about 40% to about 92% or about 50% to about 90% by weight, or about 40% to about 95% by weight or about 70% to about 90% by weight.. In alternative embodiments the formulation is formulated without propellant and delivered as a gel, ointment or rub. The total weight of the foaming agent which is a wax is about 8% to about 50% by weight of a wax. In one or more embodiments the amount of wax is less than 55%; or is less than about 54% ; or is less than about 53%; or is less than about 52%; or is less than about 51%; or is less than about 50% by weight; or is less than about 45%; or is less than about 40%; or is less than about 35%; or is less than about 30%; or is less than about 25%; or is less than about 20%; or is less than about 15% by weight. In one or more alternative embodiments the formulation comprises 0% to about 550% wax and about 45% to about 95% hydrophobic solvent. In certain embodiments the wax is about 1% to about 20% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 75% to about 94%. In certain embodiments the wax is about 21% to about 40% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 55% to about 74%. In certain embodiments the wax is about 41% to about 60% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 35% to about 54%. As will be appreciated from the above illustrative examples as the amount of wax is increased the amount of hydrophobic solvent is reduced. Accordingly, differing amounts of wax other than the amounts specified can be contemplated with a parallel increase or decrease in solvent as appropriate. In one or more embodiments their total amount (wax plus solvent) is between about 95% and about 100%. In one or more other embodiments the total amount is between about 92% and about 100%; or between about 90%> and about 100%; between about 85% and about 100%; or between about 90%> and about 95%>; or between about 90%> and about 98%> or between about 85%o and about 95%>; or between about 85% and about 98%>. .\n\n[0013] Upon dispensing the foamable carrier composition forms a breakable foam that is stable, yet breaks easily upon application of shear force.

The challenge is not just to achieve a quality foam but also to attain a formulation that will satisfy a plurality of two, three, four, five, six or more of the following property specifications simultaneously.\n\n[0033] Notably, the pressurized composition is flowable and releases a foam freely, even though it might be expected that such concentrations of wax would make the hydrophobic solvent very viscous or 'semi-solid'.\n\n1. Uniformity: The composition should be formulated so that it is and can remain uniform upon shaking and that it can reconstitute upon shaking without phase separation or precipitation over a reasonable time. This property is of importance when the product is intended to be a pharmaceutical product.\n\n2. Flowability: The composition, when placed in an aerosol container and pressurized with a propellant should be flowable such that it can be expelled through the canister valve. It should preferably also be shakable inside the container. These requirements create a formulation challenge, because non-viscous flowable and shakable compositions are prone to undergo phase separation or precipitation.\n\n3. Quality: Upon release from the can, the composition should generate a foam of good or excellent quality having low density and small bubble size.\n\n4. Stability/Breakability: The fine balance between stability and breakability of the foam coming out of the container is very delicate: on one hand the foam should preferable not be \"quick breaking\", i.e., it should be at least short term stable upon release from the pressurized container and not break as a result of exposure to skin temperature; and on the other hand, it should be \"breakable\", i.e., it should spread easily, break down and absorb into the skin or membrane upon application of mild shear force.\n\n5. Skin Feeling: To ensure patient compliance the skin feeling after application should be pleasant, and greasy or waxy residues should be minimal.\n\n6. Non-irritating: The above requirements should be achieved with the awareness that\n\nformulation excipients, especially surfactants, can be irritating, and should preferably be eliminated from the composition or reduced as much as possible.\n\n7. Delivery: Finally, the composition should also be designed to ensure efficient delivery of a therapeutic agent into the target site of treatment.\n\n8. Compatibility: The components of the composition should be compatible and not react with an active agent.\n\n[0034] Based on extensive investigations and trial and error experiments, it has been found that such properties can be achieved for formulations as described below and which are further advantageous because of the ability of hydrophobic solvents to dissolve or suspend certain active agents while providing an environment for the active agent which assists in preventing their degradation.\n\nCompositions\n\n[0035] All % values are provided on a weight (w/w) basis.\n\n[0036] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable carrier composition including:\n\n1 hydrophobic solvent\n\n2 foaming agent comprising a wax;\n\n3 liquefied or compressed gas propellant.\n\nWaxes\n\n[0037] In one or more embodiments the wax includes a paraffin wax. In one or more embodiments the paraffin wax includes a paraffin wax having a melting point or melting point range somewhere in between about 47Â°C to about 64Â°C. In one or more embodiments the paraffin wax includes a paraffin wax having a melting point of about 58Â°C to 62Â°C. In one or more embodiments the paraffin wax includes a paraffin wax having a melting point of about 51Â°C to 53Â°C. In one or more embodiments the paraffin wax includes a paraffin wax having a melting point of about 42Â°C to 44Â°C. In one or more embodiments the wax includes a beeswax. In one or more embodiments the wax includes a hydrogenated caster oil, which is a wax.\n\n[0038] Paraffin waxes are primarily mixtures of solid saturated hydrocarbons having the general formula CnH(2n+2).\n\n[0039] Unexpectedly it was found that paraffin waxes could form quality foam with oils without the assistance of surfactants, and/or foam adjuvants and/or polymers. Without being bound to a specific theory, the ability of paraffin wax to facilitate the formation of quality stable breakable foam with oils appears to relate to its unique molecular structure and size and resultant Van der Waals forces. Paraffin waxes are comprised primarily of long straight chain molecules having chains consisting of between about 20 to about 40 carbons. Higher melting point paraffin waxes will be expected to have a higher proportion of longer chains than lower melting waxes. Introduction of branched chains may result in a reduction of melting point. Without being bound to a specific theory, such long hydrocarbon chains exhibit momentary asymmetry in the electron distribution resulting in temporary dipoles that induce similar dipoles in nearby molecules (Van der Waals forces). This phenomenon is especially prevalent in long molecules like paraffin wax, and less so in the shorter (but otherwise similar) mineral oil.\n\n[0040] Apparently, the temporary dipole (+) (-) in one molecule induces a dipole in the opposite direction (-) (+) in another molecule. This interaction occurs between the paraffin wax and other compounds within the composition. Thus, it may be concluded that molecular ranges within about C20-C40 have preferred capabilities in terms of stable breakable foam formation.\n\n[0041] There seems to be another coinciding property of paraffin wax that may be involved with foam stability, which is its critical surface tension (\"CST\"). Hydrophobic behavior of surfaces is generally considered to occur when CST is less than 35 mN/m. At first, the decrease in critical surface tension is associated with oleophilic behavior, i.e. the wetting of the surfaces by hydrocarbon oils.\n\n[0042] Paraffin wax is unique among other hydrocarbon chains by having a CST of about 25 (e.g., 25.5), which is about in the middle of the hydrophobic range. Thus, paraffin waxes are somewhat amphipatic which may also contribute to foam stability. Notably, in comparison to longer hydrocarbons, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, paraffin wax is much more hydrophobic, thereby decreasing the surface tension of the hydrophobic solvents in the composition and facilitating foam formation and stabilization (the CST of polypropylene 31.0 and polyethylene 33.0).\n\n[0043] The chain length amongst other things is responsible for the different melting points of the paraffin waxes. It was found that higher melting point paraffin waxes could form quality foams with less material than lower melting point fractions. Without being bound by any theory, it may be postulated that since high melting point fractions have longer chains, the Van der Vaals forces are greater so lower amounts can facilitate the formation of quality short term thermally stable foams. Thus, in an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a paraffin wax, having CST of about 25; or between about 20 to about 30; or about 22 to about 28; about 23 to about 27; about 20 to about 30. In an embodiment selecting the CST of a wax is a means of providing a foamable formulation with a hydrophobic solvent that will generate a foam of quality that is at least short term stable.\n\n[0044] Hydrogenated castor oil consists mainly of triglycerides of hydroxystearic acid and is a solid wax. [0045] Beeswax contains, for example, a high proportion of wax esters (about 35 to 80%), which are linear monoesters of straight-chain fatty alcohols with even-numbered carbon chains from C24 to C36 esterified with straight-chain fatty acids such as 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids some with hydroxyl groups in the Ï-2 and Ï-3 positions. The wax esters can consist of C40 to C46 molecular species, Also present are free acids (about 14%) and carbohydrates (about 12%) as well as approximately 1% free wax alcohols and stearic esters of fatty acids.\n\n[0046] In one or more embodiments, the wax is a polyolefm such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylpentene , polybutene, a polyolefm elastomer, polyisobutylene , ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene Monomer (M-class) rubber, polyethylene terephthalate, polydicyclopentadiene, linear polyolefins, branched polyolefins, cyclic polyolefins, low density polyolefins, high density polyolefins, polyolefins with a low molecular weight, polyolefins with a high molecular weight, halogenated polyolefins and the like and mixture thereof.\n\n[0047] In one or more embodiments, the wax is polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl fluoride, polytetrafluoro ethylene, polychlorotrifluoro ethylene, polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, polymethylpentene and the like and mixture thereof.\n\n[0048] In one or more certain embodiments a fatty alcohol and or a fatty acid may be added to the wax.\n\n[0049] In one or more embodiments oily emollients are added to provide or improve a pleasant skin feeling, and or lubricating effect with reduced friction. In one or more embodiments volatile silicones are added to reduce greasy feeling. In one or more embodiments various waxes are added to improve rheology or stabilize foam structure.\n\n[0050] Surfactants play a role in foam formation and induce foam stability. In one or more embodiments the formulation is substantially or essentially free of surfactants. In one or more embodiments a small amount of surfactant may be added, preferably less than 1%. Scientific literature is not always accurate and may loosely or even inaccurately describe a substance as a surfactant. For example, fatty alcohols or fatty acids (in the absence of a base) when used in combination with classic surfactants have sometimes been referred to as surfactants, whereas at best they merely function as an aid to classic surfactant and may loosely be termed as a co- surfactant but they are not able to stabilize an emulsion and achieve a stable foam emulsion on their own without the presence of a true surfactant. (For more detail see \"co-surfactant\" below.) In the context of the present application such fatty acids and fatty alcohols are not surface active agents but are foam adjuvants. Similarly propoxylated lanolin oil derivatives have been loosely referred to as surfactants. In the context herein they are emollients (not surfactants). In one or more embodiments the composition is substantially free of foam adjuvants and comprises less than about 5% final concentration of foam adjuvants, preferably less than 2%, more preferably less than 1%. Where a formulation includes insignificant amounts of foam adjuvants it is considered to be essentially free of them. In one or more embodiments the composition is essentially free of foam adjuvants such as fatty alcohols and or fatty acids. In one or more embodiments a small amount of foam adjuvant may be added, preferably less than 1%. In one or more embodiments the composition is essentially free of propoxylated lanolin oil derivatives. In one or more embodiments the composition is essentially free of ethoxylated lanolin oil derivatives. In further embodiments the compositions are free of such derivatives. In one or more certain embodiments the composition is free of PPG, lanolin oils, such as PPG 40 PEG 60 lanolin oil. In one or more embodiments foam adjuvants (i.e. fatty alcohols and fatty acids) and additives (such as Si02 which acts as a thickener and can provide thixotropy) can be added to improve rheology or stabilize foam structure or as a protective agent. In one or more embodiments antioxidants can be used to prevent degradation /oxidation, for example, butylated\n\nhydroxytoluene, which is a fat soluble antioxidant.\n\n[0051] In one or more embodiments the foamable composition is substantially surfactant and foam adjuvant free. In one or more other embodiments it is essentially free of any surfactants and foam adjuvants.\n\n[0052] Upon release from an aerosol container, the foamable composition forms an expanded breakable foam suitable for topical administration.\n\n[0053] The foamable composition is suitable for administration to various body areas, including, but not limited to the skin, a body surface, a body cavity, a mucosal surface, e.g., the mucosa of the nose, mouth and eye, the ear, the respiratory system, the vagina or the rectum (severally and interchangeably termed herein \"target site\").\n\n[0054] In one or more embodiments, the composition is waterless. By waterless is meant that the composition contains no or substantially no, free or unassociated or absorbed water. It will be understood by a person of the art that to the extent the waterless solvents and substances miscible within them of the present disclosure are hydrophilic, they can contain water in an associated or unfree or absorbed form and may absorb water from the atmosphere. [0055] According to one or more embodiments, the foamable composition further comprises one or more cosmetic active agents or a pharmaceutical active agents (severally and\n\ninterchangeably termed herein \"active agent\").\n\n[0056] In one or more embodiments the carrier comprises an active agent which degrades in the presence of water, and in such cases the presence of water in the composition is clearly not desirable. Thus, in certain preferred embodiments, the composition is waterless. In other embodiments the active agent may tolerate the presence of a small amount of water and the waterless composition is substantially non-aqueous. The term \"substantially non-aqueous\" is intended to indicate that the waterless composition has water content preferably below about 2%, such as, below about 1.5%, below about 1%; or below about 0.5%>. In certain embodiments the amount of water is about or less than about 5%. Where water is present the formulation may be an emulsion or may form micelles or a colloid.\n\n[0057] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable therapeutic composition including:\n\n1. an active agent;\n\n2. a hydrophobic solvent between about 40% to about 92% by weight;\n\n3. a foaming agent comprising\n\nbetween about 8% to about 50%> by weight of wax;\n\n4. a liquefied or compressed gas propellant wherein the percent by weight is based on weight foamable composition; wherein the ratio of composition other than propellant to propellant is from about 100:3 to about 100:30; and wherein upon dispensing the foamable carrier composition forms a breakable foam that is stable, yet breaks easily upon application of shear force.\n\n[0058] In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent range is between about 35% to about 95%; about 40% to about 95%; about 40% to about 92%; about 45% to about 92%; about 50% to about 92%; about 55% to about 92%; about 60% to about 92%; about 40% to about 90%; about 45% to about 90%; about 50% to about 90%; about 55% to about 90%; about 60% to about 90%; about 40% to about 85%; about 45% to about 85%; about 50% to about 85%; about 55% to about 85%; about 60% to about 85% about 40% to about 80%; about 45% to about 80%; about 50% to about 80%; about 55% to about 80%; about 60% to about 80%; about 40% to about 70%; about 45% to about 70%; about 50% to about 70%; about 55% to about 70%; or about 60% to about 70% [0059] In one or more embodiments the wax range is between about 5% to about 52%; about 8% to about 52%; about 10% to about 52%; about 15% to about 52%; about 20% to about 52%; about 25% to about 52%; about 30% to about 52%; 5% to about 50%; about 8% to about 50%; about 10%) to about 50%>; about 15% to about 50%>; about 20%> to about 50%>; about 25% to about 50%; about 30% to about 50%; 5% to about 45%; about 8% to about 45%; about 10% to about 45%; about 15% to about 45%; about 20% to about 45%; about 25% to about 45%; or about 30% to about 45%; 5% to about 40%; about 8% to about 40%; about 10% to about 40%; about 15% to about 40%; about 20% to about 40%; about 25% to about 40%; or about 30% to about 40%;\n\n[0060] In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the therapeutic agent is suspended. In one or more embodiments the therapeutic agent is dissolved. In one or more embodiments it is partly suspended and partly dissolved. In one or more embodiments the suspended agent is evenly or homogenously distributed throughout the composition. In one or more embodiments homogeneity is achieved after shaking shortly before intended use.\n\n[0061] Formulations containing high amounts of hydrophobic solvents (such as mineral oil) are not prone to foaming. For example, it has been found that a formulation containing only mineral oil and propellants did not produce foam.. Similarly, formulations containing paraffin wax and propellant only did not produce foam. It has also been found that when a propellant is added to combinations of one or more different oils with relatively low levels of one or more different waxes in the absensce of foam stabilizers such as surfactants or foam adjuvants, foams were mostly not produced at all or were not of quality and collapsed rapidly. In other words they were not short term stable and breakable quality foams.\n\n[0062] Suprisingly, when propellant was added to formualtions containing a combination of certain hydrophobic solvents and waxes, preferably parafin wax, together having a total weight of about 100%) or about 95% , short term stable yet breakable quality foams were succesfully produced in the absence of customary surfactants and in the absence of customary foam adjuvants. Thus, unexpectedly it was discovered that wax has foaming or foam boosting properties of its own when formulated with hydrophobic solvents, such as mineral oil, and provides breakable short stable foams of good quality. The amount of wax required depends on the type of wax selected. In general, the amounts of parafin waxes having a higher melting point range needed to achieve a good quality foam can be less than the amounts of parafin waxes having a lower melting point range. Moreover, in general, higher amounts of hydrogenated caster oil wax or beeswax are needed to achieve a foam compared to parafin wax. Similarly, higher amounts of beeswax are needed to achieve a foam compared to hydrogenated caster oil wax [0063] For example, formulations containing between about 50% and about 90% heavy mineral oil and from about 10% to about 50% paraffin wax (having a melting point of about 51- 53Â°C) produced good to excellent quality foams that had a collapse time of about more than 2 minutes or about more than 3 minutes at 36Â°C. Excellent foams that were stable for more than 3 minutes were obtained in formulations having from about 15% to about 50%paraffin wax 51- 53Â°C. On the other hand formulations with parafin wax 51-53Â°C, 5% produced poor foam whilst 7.5% generated only fairly good foam.\n\n[0064] Also formulations containing about 60% heavy or light mineral oil and about 40% paraffin wax (having a melting point of about 42-44Â°C) produced excellent quality foams that displayed a collapse time of about or more than 1 minute or more than 2 minutes at 36Â°C depending on the propellant. On the other hand formulations with 20% of 42-44 resulted in a poor quality.\n\n[0065] In an embodiment foam quality may be improved by increasing the propellant, by say aliqots of 2% or 4%, for example, from 8% to about 12%. The actual amount of propellant increase that is suitable should be titrated from formulation to formulation.\n\n[0066] Furthermore, formulations containing between about 80% and about 90% heavy mineral oil and between about 10% and about 20% paraffin wax (having a melting point of about 58-62Â°C) produced excellent quality foams, having low density (between O. land 0.2g/mL) that exhibited a collapse time of about or more than 3 minutes at 36Â°C.\n\n[0067] Furthermore, different oleaginous foam formulation consisting of 80% of various oils and 20% paraffin wax (51-53 Â°C),or consisting of 80% heavy mineral oil and 20% paraffin wax (51-53 Â°C) and various propellants or consisting of heavy mineral oil between about 60%>-80%> and various waxes between about 20%>-40%> produced quality foams that showed a collapse time of about or more than 2 minutes or more than 3 minutes at 36Â°C.\n\n[0068] Furthermore, oleaginous foam formulation consisting of 80% heavy mineral oil and 20% paraffin wax (51-53 Â°C) showed physical stability in accelerated stability tests. There was hardly any change in foam quality, density or collapse time after 2 months of storage at 40Â°C. A decrease in formulation shakability was detected which may be explained by a partial solidification of the wax content with time. It may be overcome inter alia by increasing the propellant concentration of the formulation to about 12%, or by using a propellant having a higher vapor pressure such as propellant comprising propane. [0069] These results were surprising as no known foam stabilizing agent such as surfactants was present. Moreover, no fatty alcohol or fatty acid was needed, and formulations containing only hydorphobic solvents and waxes generated thermally stable quality foams.\n\n[0070] It has further been found that for high concentrations of wax, the inclusion of higher amounts of propellant was found useful in order to improve the flowability of the formulation within the canister, as indicated by the shakability results.\n\n[0071] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable carrier composition comprising a solvent, a wax and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant wherein the formulation provides upon dispensing a breakable foam of quality which has a collapse time at 36Â°C of about or more than 1 minute.

In one or more embodiments the composition further comprises one or more active agents.\n\n[0075] In one or more embodiments inclusion of higher amounts of propellant improves the flowability of the formulation. In one or more embodiments the improvement is more pronounced where there are high amounts of waxes within the canister.\n\n[0076] Furthermore, the formulations of the present invention comprising a hydrophobic solvent, for example, mineral oil, and a wax, for example, a paraffin wax 51-53 Â°C, and a propellant in an effective amount can provide foams of good quality in the presence of various active ingredients. In the context herein active pharmaceutical ingredients and active cosmetic ingredients are collectively termed \"active agent\" or \"active agents\". Formulations, for example, comprising minocycline HCl, mometasone fuorate, calcitriol and lidocaine produced breakable foams of quality which are stable and have a collapse time at 36Â°C of about or more than 1 minute.\n\n[0077] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable carrier composition comprising a solvent, a wax and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant and one or more active ingredients wherein the formulation provides upon dispensing a breakable foam of quality which has a collapse time at 36Â°C of about more than 1 minute.

[0082] In one or more embodiments, the composition is physically stable for at least two months.\n\n[0083] In one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant and foam adjuvant free composition comprising:\n\na) about 50% to about 90% by weight of a hydrophobic solvent;\n\nb) an oleaginous foaming agent comprising\n\ni) about 10%) to about 50%> by weight of paraffin wax;\n\nc) an active agent,\n\nd) a liquefied or compressed gas propellant\n\nwherein the percent by weight is based on weight of foamable composition; wherein the ratio of composition other than propellant to propellant is from about 100:3 to about 100:30;\n\nwherein upon dispensing the foamable carrier composition forms a breakable foam that is stable, yet breaks easily upon application of shear force, and\n\nwherein the active agent is compatible with in the formulation; wherein the formulation provides upon dispensing a breakable foam of quality which has a collapse time at 36Â°C of about more than 1 minute.\n\n[0084] It was observed that when a more solid paraffin wax was used the stabilty of the formualtion was improved yet shakability decreased (compare samples 023, 024 to samples 031, 032 respectively and also compare samples 035 to sample 013 respectively). It was also observed that the when light mineral oil was used as opposed to heavy mineral oil the shakability was improved (compare samples 029, 030 to samples 023, 024 respectively). It may be, without being bound by any theory, that apart from any other chemical differences between the different waxes, the observations may be accounted for in part or entitrity by the longer wax chain lengths in the higher melting point parafin waxes.\n\nHydrophobic Solvent\n\n[0085] In an embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises at least one hydrophobic organic solvent. A \"hydrophobic organic solvent\" (also termed \"hydrophobic solvent\") as used herein refers to a material having solubility in distilled water at ambient temperature of less than about 1 gm per 100 mL, more preferably less than about 0.5 gm per 100 mL, and most preferably less than about 0.1 gm per 100 mL. It is liquid at ambient temperature. The identification of a \"hydrophobic solvent\", as used herein, is not intended to characterize the solubilization capabilities of the solvent for any specific active agent or any other component of the foamable composition.

[0093] Non-limiting examples of oils from animal origin include herring oil, cod-liver oil and salmon oil.\n\n[0094] The hydrophobic solvent may be an emollient, i.e., a hydrophobic liquid having a softening or soothing effect especially to the skin. In some embodiments the liquid oil may contain a solid or semi solid hydrophobic matter at room temperature.\n\n[0095] Essential oil, which is usually a concentrated, hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants usually conveying characteristic fragrances. Non limiting examples include lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus. A therapeutic oil is a hydrophobic liquid which is said to have a therapeutic effect or to have associated with it certain healing properties. Therapeutic oils contain active biologically occurring molecules and, upon topical application, exert a therapeutic effect. Non limiting examples include manuka oil, rosehip oil, which contains retinoids and is known to reduce acne and post-acne scars, and tea tree oil, which possesses antimicrobial activity including antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties as well as any other therapeutically beneficial oil known in the art of herbal medication.

Non-limiting examples of silicone oils include a cyclomethicone, dimethicone, a polyalkyl siloxane, a polyaryl siloxane, a polyalkylaryl siloxane, a polyether siloxane copolymer, a poly(dimethylsiloxane)-(diphenyl-siloxane) copolymer, a dimethyl polysiloxane, an epoxy-modified silicone oil, a fatty acid-modified silicone oil, a fluoro group-modified silicone oil, a methylphenylpolysiloxane, phenyl\n\ntrimethicone and a polyether group-modified silicone oil.

Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the use of mixtures of two or more hydrophobic solvents is preferred.\n\n[0099] Yet, in certain embodiments, the hydrophobic solvent is a mixture of one or more liquid hydrophobic solvents, as listed above, together with an additional hydrophobic substance, which is not liquid (such as petrolatum), provided that the resultant mixture of all hydrophobic substances, is liquid at ambient temperature. In an embodiment the resultant mixture upon including propellant is liquid at ambient temperature. In certain embodiments the main hydrophobic substance in the formulation is a petrolatum, which is a semi solid, in combination with at least one liquid hydrophobic solvent. For example petrolatum may be added to provide a degree of occlusivity so that the formulation when applied to a skin surface can operate to increase skin moisture and or reduced transdermal water loss. In certain other embodiments a liquid hydrophobic solvent is not added. Fluidity of the composition can be achieved by utilizing liquidizing solvents (e.g. C12 C15 Alkyl benzoate) and or liquefied propellants and or optionally liquid adjuvants. Inclusion of higher amounts of propellant was found useful in order to improve flowability of the formulation from the canister or by using propellants having a higher vapor pressure.\n\nFatty Alcohol\n\n[0100] If at all present, the fatty alcohol is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 15 or more carbons in their carbon chain, such as cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol (or mixtures thereof). Other examples of fatty alcohols are arachidyl alcohol (C20), behenyl alcohol (C22), tetracosanol, hexacosanol, octacosanol, triacontanol, tetratriacontanol, 1- triacontanol (C30), as well as alcohols with longer carbon chains (up to C50). In one or more other embodiments, the fatty alcohol is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 14 or less carbons in their carbon chain, such as lauryl alcohol and myristyl alcohol. In an embodiment the fatty alcohol is a solid at room temperature.\n\n[0101] Fatty Acid\n\n[0102] If at all present the fatty acid can have 16 or more carbons in its carbon chain, such as hexadecanoic acid (CI 6), heptadecanoic acid, stearic acid (CI 8), arachidic acid (C20), behenic acid (C22), tetracosanoic acid (C24), hexacosanoic acid (C26, heptacosanoic acid (C27), octacosanoic acid (C28), triacontanoic acid, dotriacontanoic acid, tritriacontanoic acid, tetratriacontanoic acid and pentatriacontanoic acid, as well as fatty acids with longer carbon chains (up to C50), or mixtures thereof. In one or more other embodiments, the fatty acid is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 14 or less carbons in their carbon chain, such as dodecanoic acid, myristic acid, myristoleic acid, and lauric acid. In an embodiment the fatty acid is a solid at room temperature.\n\nWaxes\n\n[0103] The foaming agent includes a wax. The wax which usually acts as a type of foam adjuvant is included in the foamable compositions to evolve the foaming property of the composition and/or to stabilize the foam. Wax refers to paraffin wax or beeswax or hydrogenated castor oil or another substance with similar properties. The term wax refers to a class of substances with properties similar to beeswax, in respect of (i) plastic behavior at normal ambient temperatures, a melting point above approximately 45Â°C, (ii) a relatively low viscosity when melted (unlike many plastics); and (iii) hydrophobic nature. Suitable exemplary waxes which can be incorporated into the formulation include animal, vegetable, mineral or silicone based waxes which may be natural or synthetic such as, for example: beeswax, Chinese wax, lanolin (wool wax), shellac wax, bayberry wax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax, castor wax, esparto wax, japan wax, ouricury wax, rice bran wax, soy wax, hydrogenated oil such ashydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, or hydrogenated jojoba oil, mink wax, motan wax, ouricury wax, ozokerite, PEG-6 beeswax, rezowax, spent grain wax, stearyl dimethicone, paraffin waxes, such as paraffin 42-44, 51-53 58-62 wax, and the like and mixtures thereof. In one or more\n\nembodiments the wax is selected from a list comprising of a solid wax, an animal wax, a vegetable wax, a mineral wax, a natural wax or a synthetic wax. In certain embodiments the term wax can extend to hydrogenated oils. In one or more preferred embodiments, the wax is a beeswax or hydrogenated castor oil.\n\n[0104] In one or more embodiments the range of ratio of wax/ hydrophobic solvent can be about 100: 1 to about 1 : 100; or about 90: 1 to about 1 :45; or about 80: 1 to about 1 :40; or about 70: 1 to about 1 :35; or about 60: 1 to about 1 :30; or about 50:1 to about 1 :25; or about 40: 1 to about 1 :20; or about 30: 1 to about 1 : 15; or about 20: 1 to about 1 : 10; or about 15: 1 to about 1 :5; or about 10: 1 to about 1 : 1 ; or any ranges in between such as 1 :20 to 20 : 1 , or preferably from 1 : 15 to 15: 1. Preferably the range of the ratio of wax/ hydrophobic solvent can be selected from a list comprising of : about 1 : 10; about 10: 1; about 1 :9 to about 9: 1; or about 1 :7 to about 7: l;or about 3: 17 to about 17:3; or about 1 :4 to about 4: 1; or about 1 :3 to about 3: 1; or about 2:5 to about 5:2; or about 3:7 to about 7:3; or about 1 :2 to about 2: 1; or about 5:9 to about 9:5; or about 2:3 to about 3 :2; or about 9: 11 to about 11 :9;\n\n[0105] In one or more embodiments Shea butter may be further added to the composition. Shea butter may, for example, be used in addition to paraffin wax or bees wax or hydrogenated caster oil in order to enhance foam quality or to complement the action of one or more of them.\n\n[0106] In one or more embodiments the foaming agent can further include be a fatty alcohol and shea butter, or a fatty acid and shea butter or a combination of a fatty alcohol and a fatty acid and shea butter.\n\nPropellant\n\n[0107] The composition requires the addition of a propellant in order to generate a foam.\n\n[0108] Suitable propellants include volatile hydrocarbons such as butane, propane, isobutene or mixtures thereof. In one or more embodiments a hydrocarbon mixture AP-70 is used. In one or more other embodiments a lower pressure hydrocarbon mixture AP-46 is used. Both contain butane, propane, isobutene although in different proportions. AP-70 is composed of about 50% w/w of propane, about 20% w/w of isobutane and about 30%> w/w of propane. AP-46 is composed of about 16%> w/w of propane, about 82% w/w of isobutane and about 2% w/w of propane. Hydro fluorocarbon (HFC) propellants are also suitable as propellants in the context disclosed herein. Exemplary HFC propellants include 1,1,1,2 tetrafluorethane (Dymel 134), and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3 heptafluoropropane (Dymel 227). Dimethyl ether is also useful. In one or more embodiments use of compressed gases (e.g., air, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and nitrogen) is also possible.\n\n[0109] In one or more embodiments a combination of at least two propellants, selected from HFC, hydrocarbon propellants, dimethyl ether and compressed gases is contemplated.\n\n[0110] Yet, in additional embodiments, the propellant is a self-foaming propellant, i.e., a volatile liquid having a boiling point of less than the temperature of the target treatment site (such as the skin). An example of a post-foaming propellant is isopentane (bp=26Â°C)\n\n[0111] Any concentration of the propellant, which affords an acceptable foam, is useful in accordance with the present invention. In certain embodiments the propellant makes up between about 1% and about 30% of the foamable composition, or about 3% and 25%; and in certain preferred embodiments between about 5% and about 16% of the composition. In preparing the formulations the ingredients other than propellant are combined to 100% and the propellant is added thereafter so that the ratio of formulation to propellant can range from 100: 1 to 100:30 ; 100:4 to 100:25 or preferably 100:5 to 100: 16. Yet, in additional embodiments, the ratio of composition other than propellant to propellant is between about 100:20 and about 100:50.\n\n[0112] Due to environmental concerns, as well as compatibility considerations, propellants that are not environmentally friendly are in one or more embodiments to be avoided. So chlorofluoro carbons (CFC's), which are known to damage the ozone layer in the atmosphere, are essentially excluded from the formulations.\n\n[0113] In one or more embodiments, the propellant can also be used to expel formulation using a bag in can system or a can in can system as will be appreciated by someone skilled in the art. In certain embodiments the part of the propellant system is in the formulation and part separate from the formulation. In this way it is possible to reduce the amount of surfactant in the formulation but still provide good expulsion from the canister, where the foamable formulation is expelled quickly but without jetting or noise.\n\n[0114] In one or more embodiments a foam formulation is expelled from a standard pressurized canister where the propellant is part of formulation. Formulations can be expelled or helped to be expelled by using propellant which is separate from the formulation using a bag in can or can in can system. Although, these systems can be used with compressed air the pressure may not be sufficient to expel the formulation through the device and higher pressure propellant such as AP70 should be selected. In one or more embodiments, the formulation is packaged in bag in can systems or in can in can system. In one or more embodiments, the formulation is expelled from the canister using the pressure provided by the propellant mixed with the formulation. In one or more embodiments, the formulation is expelled from the canister using the pressure provided by the propellant stored in a compartment surrounding the formulation.\n\nAccording to other embodiments part of the propellant system is in the formulation and part of the propellant system is separate from the formulation, which is used to expel said formulation using a bag or can in can system. In this way it is possible to reduce the amount of propellant within the formulation and avoid unwanted gaseous effects, for example in vaginal applications, but still provide good expulsion from the canister, where the foamable formulation is expelled sufficiently quickly but without jetting or noise. So by way of example, between about 1% to 3%; or between about 2% to 4%; between about 3% to 5% propellant (ratio of formulation to propellant of 100: 1 to 3; 100: 2 to 4; 100: 3 to 5; respectively) is part of the formulation and a further amount of propellant is separate form the formulation and helps expel the formulation. In one or more embodiments a similar amount of propellant is in the formulation and a pump or other mechanical means is used to provide the additional expulsion force.\n\nModulating Agent\n\n[0115] In one or more embodiments the modulating agent is used in a waterless composition which is surfactant and adjuvant free. The term modulating agent is used to describe an agent which can improve the stability of or stabilize a carrier or a foamable composition and/or an active agent by modulating the effect of a substance or residue present in the carrier or composition. The substance or residue may, for example, be acidic or basic or buffer system (or combinations thereof) and potentially alter an artificial pH in a waterless or substantially nonaqueous environment, such as, by acting to modulate the ionic or polar characteristics and any acidity or basesity balance of a waterless or substantially non-aqueous carrier, composition, foamable carrier or foamable composition or resultant foam or it may be a chelating or sequestering or complexing agent or it may be one or more metal ions which may act as a potential catalyst in a waterless or substantially non-aqueous environment or it may be an ionization agent or it may be an oxidizing agent.\n\n[0116] In an embodiment , the modulating or additional component is a pH adjusting agent or a buffering agent and can be any of the known buffering systems used in pharmaceutical or cosmetic formulations as would be appreciated by a man of the art. It can also be an organic acid, a carboxylic acid, a fatty acid an amino acid, an aromatic acid, an alpha or beta hydroxyl acid an organic base or a nitrogen containing compound.\n\n[0117] In one or more further embodiments the modulating agent is used to describe an agent, which is a chelating or sequestering or complexing agent that is sufficiently soluble or functional in the waterless solvent to enable it to \"mop up\" or \"lock\" metal ions such as EDTA or other such pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable.\n\n[0118] Modulating agents may be added to the compositions of the subject invention, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 5%, of the composition. Where the active agent itself is the modulating agent alone or in combination with another modulating agent it will be added at an effective dose which may be outside these ranges. For example azaleic acid may be at about 15% of the composition. In an embodiment sufficient modulating agent is added to achieve an artificial pH in which the active agent is preferably stable. Such artificial pH may be acidic, maybe basic or may be neutral [0119] Further detail regarding modulating agents is found in co-pending Published U.S. Patent Application 2008/0206159, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference.\n\n[0120] The modulating agent to the foamable composition is useful for stabilizing pharmaceutical and cosmetic active agents which are unstable in certain pH conditions. It is known, for example, that active agents, which contain ester bond in their structure, tend to undergo hydrolysis of the ester bond at basic pH levels. Therefore, the addition of an agent, avoids the formation of basic pH condition, and thus, prevents degradation of such active agents. Many steroid compounds are known to undergo rearrangement at high pH, and again, adding an acidic modulating agent helps prevent such degradation. Another example of a pH-sensitive active agent is vitamin D, which degrades at low pH levels. In such a case, the addition of a basic modulating agent, such as triethanolamine is useful to maintain acceptable stability of this active agent.\n\n[0121] It is important to maintain skin surface pH in order to prevent susceptibility to bacterial skin infections or skin damage and disease. Thus, adding a modulating agent, which contributes to the stabilization of skin pH at the desirable level, is advantageous.\n\n[0122] In the same fashion, adding an acidic modulating agent to a foamable composition, which is intended for vaginal application is advantageous, since better protection against vaginal infection is attained in pH lower than 4.\n\n[0123] In one or more embodiments, the modulating agent may also be a preservative or an antioxidant or an ionization agent. Any preservative, antioxidant or ionization agents suitable for pharmaceutical or cosmetic application may be used. Non-limiting examples of antioxidants are tocopherol, tocopherol succinate, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and its salts, propyl galate, butylated hydroxy toluene and butyl hydroxy anisol. Non-limiting examples of positive ionization agents are benzyl conium chloride, and cetyl pyridium chloride. Non-limiting examples of negative ionization agents are sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium lauryl lactylate and phospholipids. In one or more embodiments the modulating agent is a flavonoid for example quercitin and/or rutin.\n\n[0124] A safe and effective amount of an anti-oxidant/radical scavenger may be added to the compositions of the subject invention, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 1% to about 5%, of the composition.\n\n[0125] In one or more embodiments the modulating agent used is compatible with the active ingredient(s). Ophthalmic Excipients\n\n[0126] In one or more embodiments the formulation may comprise excipients that are suitable for ophthalmic use. By virtue of their suitability for ophthalmic use they may in certain embodiments be applicable on other sensitive targets such as for use internal and or external wounds or burns or in body cavities. Excipients selected as part of a drug carrier that can be used with the active pharmaceutical ingredients are identified by compatibility studies with active ingredients to ascertain which are compatible for use with the active pharmaceutical ingredients, for example, by examining which do not react with and or promote break down of the active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\n[0127] Not all excipients are appropriate for opthlmic use. Some may not be approved and require additional studies to achieve regulatory approval. Some may be eliminated as\n\nincompatible with the active ingredient and some may be eliminated agents because of physical considerations (e.g. as indicated below). Some may have or require that an effect be modified by the addition of other ingredients (e.g. such as rheology modifiers).\n\n[0128] Oleaginous ointments are viscous preparations, which remain viscous when applied to the skin or other body surfaces; and they require extensive rubbing. Because of their viscosity, eye ointments cause blurred vision and consequent low tolerability, especially for long term treatment. Because of their high viscosity, drugs are trapped in the vehicle and cannot migrate through to their target site of action, for example, the skin or the eye.\n\n[0129] Liquid, non viscous oleaginous medications are also disadvantageous, as they spill easily and thus, are very inconvenient to use. In eye treatment, liquid drops are difficult to apply and they require lying on the back at rest for accurate administration. Furthermore, because of their low viscosity, liquid oil vehicles cannot carry suspended drugs, which tend to precipitate and if the viscosity is not high enough, thereby impairing the uniformity of the therapeutic product.\n\n[0130] In one or more embodiments the formulations are not highly viscous. In one or more other embodiments the formulations do not provide low viscosity. In one or more embodiments the formulations are thixotropic so that on application of shear force their viscosity decreases and they become more flowable. On one or more embodiments the formulations are foams which are breakable on shear force. In one or more embodiments the foams are based on thixotropic gel formulations. In one or more embodiments the viscosity of the formulation prior to addition of propellant is more than about lOOOcps and less than about 25,000 cps. Additional components\n\n[0131] In an embodiment, a composition disclosed herein includes one or more additional components. Such additional components include but are not limited to anti perspirants, antistatic agents, bulking agents, cleansers, colorants, skin conditioners, deodorants, diluents, dyes, fragrances, hair conditioners, herbal extracts, humectants, keratolytic agents, modulating agents, pearlescent aids, perfuming agents, pH modifying or stabilizing agents, skin penetration or permeation enhancers, softeners, solubilizers, sunscreens, sun blocking agents, sunless tanning agents, viscosity modifiers, flavanoids and vitamins. As is known to one skilled in the art, in some instances a specific additional component may have more than one activity, function or effect.\n\n[0132] In certain embodiments, the additional component is an oil soluble preservative, or an oil soluble antioxidant, or an oil soluble radical scavenger, or an oil soluble complexing agent, or an oil soluble pigment or dye.\n\nDefinitions\n\n[0133] All % values are provided on a weight (w/w) basis.\n\n[0134] By the term \"about\" herein it is meant that a figure or range of figures can vary plus or minus up to 30%. So in this embodiment if a figure of \"about 1\" is provided then the amount can be up to 1.3 or from 0.70. In other embodiments it can reflect a variation of plus or minus 20%. In still further embodiments it can describe a variation of plus or minus 10%. In still further embodiments it can describe a variation of plus or minus 5%. As will be appreciated by one of the art there is some reasonable flexibility in formulating compositions such that where one or more ingredients are varied successful formulations may still be made even if an amount falls slightly outside the range. Therefore, to allow for this possibility amounts are qualified by about. In one or more other embodiments the figures may be read without the prefix about.\n\n[0135] The term \"waterless,\" as used herein, means that the composition contains no, or substantially no, free or unassociated or absorbed water. Similarly, \"waterless\" or \"substantially waterless\" carriers contain at most incidental and trace amounts of water.\n\n[0136] By the term \"single phase\" herein it is meant that after addition of propellant to the composition or carrier, the liquid components of the foamable composition or carrier are fully miscible, and the solid components if any, are either dissolved or suspended in the composition. By substantially a single phase is meant that the composition or carrier after addition of propellant is primarily or essentially a single phase as explained above, but may also have present a small amount of material which is capable of forming or may form a separate phase amounting to less than about 5% of the composition or carrier after the addition of propellant, preferably less than about 3%, and more preferably less than about 1%.\n\n[0137] The term \"unstable active agent\" as used herein, means an active agent which is oxidized and/or degraded within less than a day, and in some cases, in less than an hour upon exposure to air, light, skin or water under ambient conditions.\n\n[0138] The term \"co-surfactant\" as used herein, means a molecule which on its own is not able to form and stabilize satisfactorily an oil in water emulsion but when used in combination with a surfactant the co-surfactant has properties, which can allow it to help surfactants to create an emulsion and can boost the stabilizing power or effect of the surfactant and can include, for example, a fatty alcohol, such as cetyl alcohol or a fatty acid such as stearic acid. Cetyl alcohol is a waxy hydrophobic substance that can be emulsified with water using a surfactant. Some substances may have more than one function and for example, fatty alcohols can in some formulations act as a co-solvent. In certain circumstances a co-surfactant can itself be converted in to a surfactant or soap by, for example, adding a base, such as, triethanolamine to a fatty acid like stearic acid.\n\n[0139] The identification of a \"polyol\", as used herein, is an organic substance that contains at least two hydroxy groups in its molecular structure.\n\n[0140] In one or more embodiments, the polyol is a diol (a compound that contains two hydroxy groups in its molecular structure). Examples of diols include propylene glycol (e.g.,\n\n1.2- propylene glycol and 1,3-propylene glycol), butanediol (e.g., 1 ,2-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol,\n\n2.3- butanediol and 1 ,4-butanediol), butanediol (e.g., 1,3-butanediol and 1 ,4-butenediol), butynediol, pentanediol (e.g., pentane-l,2-diol, pentane- 1,3 -diol, pentane-l,4-diol, pentane-1,5- diol, pentane-2,3-diol and pentane-2,4-diol), hexanediol (e.g., hexane-l,6-diol hexane-2,3-diol and hexane-2,56-diol), octanediol (e.g., 1,8-octanediol), neopentyl glycol, 2 -methyl- 1,3- propanediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and dibutylene glycol.\n\n[0141] In one or more embodiments, the polyol is a triol (a compound that contains three hydroxy groups in its molecular structure), such as glycerin, butane- 1,2,3-triol, butane- 1,2,4-triol and hexane-l,2,6-triol. [0142] In one or more embodiments, the polyol is a saccharide. Exemplary saccharides include, but are not limited to monosaccharide, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and sugar alcohols.\n\n[0143] A monosaccharide is a simple sugar that cannot be hydrolysed to smaller units.\n\nEmpirical formula is (CH20)n and range in size from trioses (n=3) to heptoses (n=7).\n\nExemplary monosaccharide compounds are ribose, glucose, fructose and galactose.\n\n[0144] Disaccharides are made up of two monosaccharides joined together, such as sucrose, maltose and lactose.\n\n[0145] In one or more embodiments, the polyol is a sugar alcohol (also known as a polyol, polyhydric alcohol, or polyalcohol) is a hydrogenated form of saccharide, whose carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone, reducing sugar) has been reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group. They are commonly used for replacing sucrose in foodstuffs, often in combination with high intensity artificial sweeteners to counter the low sweetness. Some exemplary sugar alcohols, which are suitable for use according to the present invention are mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol. (Maltitol and lactitol are not completely hydrogenated compounds - they are a monosaccharide combined with a polyhydric alcohol.) Mixtures of polyols, including (1) at least one polyol selected from a diol and a triol; and (2) a saccharide are contemplated within the scope of the present disclosure.\n\n[0146] According to some embodiments, the composition is polyol-free i.e., free of polyols.
