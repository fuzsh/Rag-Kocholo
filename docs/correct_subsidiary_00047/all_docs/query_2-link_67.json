Slight shifts in foam composition, such as by the addition of active ingredients or the removal of any of the essential ingredients, may destabilize the foam.\n\n[0004] The prior art teaches oleaginous foam compositions require significant amounts of surface active agents to form a foam. These compositions require various standard surfactants, as essential components.\n\n[0005] Surfactants are known as essential ingredients in foam compositions because of their amphiphilic properties and because they are considered essential in forming a foam. However, many surfactants are known to be irritating when left on the skin, as they can extract lipids from the skin, thereby damaging skin barrier and exposing the skin to contact with pro-inflammatory factors. (See for example: Effendy, I. and Maibach, H.I. \"Surfactants and Experimental Irritant Contact Dermatitis. \" Contact Dermatol., 33 (1995), 217-225). Many surfactants can also react with unstable active agents and lead to their rapid degradation.\n\n[0006] Briefly, the term surfactant has been often loosely used in the art to include substances which do not function effectively as stand alone surfactants to reduce surface tension between two substances or phases. Reduction of surface tension can be significant in foam technology in relation to the ability to create small stable bubbles. In the context herein, the term \"standard surfactant\" or \"customary surfactant\" refers to customary non-ionic, anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and amphiphilic surfactants. Many standard surfactants are derivatives of fatty alcohols or fatty acids, such as ethers or esters formed from such fatty alcohols or fatty acids with hydrophilic moieties, such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG). However, a native (non derivatized) fatty alcohol or fatty acid, as well as waxes are not regarded as a standard surfactant.\n\n[0007] In the context herein the term \"foam adjuvant\" includes only native fatty alcohols and fatty acids. These are amphiphatic, and essentially hydrophobic with a minor hydrophilic region. For the purposes of forming an emulsion these foam adjuvants, unlike \"standard\" or \"customary surfactants\", are not effective as stand-alone surfactants in foamable emulsion compositions, because of their very weak emulsifying capacity on their own. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids have been loosely described as co-surfactants in foamable emulsion compositions, because they assist customary surfactants to boost foam quality, help evolve the foaming properties and because they stabilize the foam in part because of their property as thickeners.\n\nSUMMARY\n\n[0008] The present application relates to oleaginous foamable formulations and foams and their uses comprising hydrophobic solvents. In addition, it relates to formulations with an active agent. Surprisingly, the application also relates to foamable formulations and foam without surfactants; and/or without surfactants and polymeric agents. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvents are provided as part of a drug carrier. For example certain drugs require hydrophobic solvents in order to solubilize them. In one or more other embodiments, the hydrophobic solvents are provided to facilitate or enhance the transdermal penetration or delivery of a drug. In one or more additional cases, the hydrophobic solvents are provided to have an occlusive effect at the target site, for example where the site of treatment is a damaged skin and the occlusive effect of hydrophobic solvents is desirable. The application further describes semi solid gel compositions that liquefy on application of mild shear force such as gentle rubbing.\n\n[0009] It is known in the art that foams can easily be formulated based on high amounts of water, in combination with surface active agents, foam adjuvants and polymeric agents. As described in the literature, hydrophobic solvents can have a de-foaming effect which makes the formulation of foams based on hydrophobic solvents challenging, especially in compositions that do not contain water. To overcome this challenge, the prior art requires the use of substantial levels of surfactants that act as foaming agents. Surface active agents are known to be irritating, especially ionic surface active agents and repeated use can cause dry skin and so it is desirable to reduce their use in pharmaceutical compositions intended to treat skin or mucosa. The prior art further teaches the incorporation of foam adjuvants, such as fatty alcohols and fatty acids, as foam stabilizing agents and also the incorporation of polymeric agents (e.g. gelling agents) as foam stabilizers, which can prolong the collapse time of a foam. Waxes may also be introduced into these surfactant-based formulations but as will be appreciated, waxes, which are solids at ambient temperature, can easily precipitate.\n\n[0010] The technical problems to be overcome in formulating carriers and pharmaceutical compositions with hydrophobic solvent (a) without surfactants; and/or (b) without polymeric agents and/or (c) without water and/or (e) without short chain alcohols and/or (f) without polyols; are multifold and include finding a suitable substitute for surfactant which provides foam generating properties; finding a suitable replacement that preferably does not need to have a foam adjuvant present with the surfactant (substitute), which if present would inter alia help to boost the foam and as an aid to the surfactant and preferably does not need to have a polymeric agent present with the surfactant (substitute), which if present would inter alia help prolong stability of the foam.\n\n[0011] It was surprisingly discovered in the present invention, that surface active agents can be advantageously eliminated and replaced by foam adjuvants and waxes in the context of hydrophobic solvent based-foams. Waxes possess several advantages over other foaming agents such as excellent skin compatibility, almost no chemical reactivity which ensures active ingredients stability and efficient skin occlusion which helps reducing skin water loss and can enhance skin penetration of active agents. Albeit waxes introduce their own additional problems into formulating foamable compositions and foams, including their tendency to solidify and precipitate out from a formulation and to block canister valves, against which the formulations need to be designed so that the formulations are not negatively disturbed upon adding an effective amount of propellant and that the formulations are shakable and are homogenous and can readily reform at least upon mild or reasonable shaking prior to use.\n\n[0012] Incorporated in or added to the above is the aspect of how to provide formulations in which unstable active ingredients, such as tetracyclines, which readily degrade can nevertheless remain sufficiently chemically stable for prolonged periods of time such that allowing for a reasonable or acceptable amount of breakdown (for example as may be accepted by a regulatory drug authority) they remain capable of providing a therapeutic effect or prevention or remission of a disorder or disease (hereinafter \"chemically stable\"). A further challenge is providing and delivering a composition in which the active agent is homogenous. Additionally the formulations should avoid the use of substances, which can be irritating if applied to a sensitive target or can cause depletion or drying or soreness on repeated use.\n\n[0013] Incorporated in or added to the above is the aspect of how to provide physically stable formulations which are at least short term stable upon release from the pressurized container and not break as a result of exposure to skin temperature. Foams which are structurally stable on the skin for at least one minute are termed \"short term stable\" carriers or foams. In another aspect of physically stability the foamable formulation including propellant remains homogenous and does not separate to any significant extent for at least one minute after being shaken (hereinafter \"physically stable\").\n\n[0014] A feature of a product for cosmetic or medical use is long term stability. Propellants, which are a mixture of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, tend to impair the stability. The foamable compositions herein are surprisingly stable, even in the absence of customary surfactants. Following accelerated stability studies, they demonstrate desirable texture; they form fine bubble structures that do not break immediately upon contact with a surface, spread easily on the treated area and absorb quickly. In one or more embodiments the foam composition has an acceptable shelf-life of at least six months. In one or more embodiments the foam composition has an acceptable shelf-life of at least one year, In one or more embodiments the foam\n\ncomposition has an acceptable shelf- life of at least 15 months, or at least 18 months or at least 21 months or at least two years at ambient temperature.\n\n[0015] In one or more embodiments there is provided a composition which is a single phase.\n\n[0016] In one or more embodiments there is provided a composition which prevents the degradation of the active ingredient upon application on the target site of treatment. [0017] Thanks to the absence of surfactants in the compositions, the oleaginous formulations and foams of the present invention, containing different concentrations of minocycline hydrochloride, demonstrated no signs of irritation as demonstrated using an in vitro irritation HET-CAM test. In one or more embodiments the drug carrier is formulated for use on sensitive targets such as the eye. In one or more embodiments the active pharmaceutical ingredients are formulated for use on sensitive target areas such as sensitive or damaged skin areas, wounds, burns, mucosal membranes, and body cavities. Hydrophobic solvents that are suitable, for example, for eye treatment or for use in wounds or burns. In one or more embodiments the drug carrier and the respective pharmaceutical composition with an active agent are both formulated for use on sensitive targets such as the eye. In one or more embodiments the composition is intended for use in treatment or prevention of eye infections.\n\n[0018] Unexpectedly, it has been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of standard surfactants. Thus, in one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more embodiments, there is provided an essentially surfactant free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more preferred embodiments the oleaginous formulations and foams are free of surfactants. Further, unexpectedly, it has been discovered that quality oleaginous formulations and foams can be achieved without the presence of significant amounts of standard polymeric agents (e.g. gelling agents). Thus, in one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant-free and substantially polymeric agent-free oleaginous formulation or foam. In one or more preferred embodiments the oleaginous formulations and foams are free of standard surfactants and polymers. Moreover, it has been further discovered that these formulations and foams can be achieved over a large range of hydrophobic solvent content. There is thus provided easy to use, chemically and physically stable and non-irritating topical foam formulations, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, containing a stable or stabilized active pharmaceutical or cosmetic agent having a therapeutic or beneficial effect, intended for treatment of dermal and mucosal tissues free or substantially free of standard surfactants and/or polymeric agents.\n\n[0019] In one or more embodiments there is provided a safe and effective foamable carrier composition and foam comprising a hydrophobic solvent, an oleaginous foamer complex (also termed \"foamer complex\"), comprising a first member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty alcohol; and a second member, comprising about 0.1 % to about 20%> by weight of (i) a fatty acid; and/or (ii) a wax; and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant. In one or more embodiments the foamer agent comprises a paraffin wax alone or in combination with the first member and/or the second member. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the propellant is about 3% to about 30% by weight of the total composition.\n\n[0020] In other certain embodiments, the concentration of the propellant is about 1% to about 3%) by weight of the total composition; or about 3% to about 25%; or about 7% to about 17%; or about 10% to about 14%. Where a bag in can or can in can system is used where part of the propellant is in the formulation and part separate from the formulation, the amount in the formulation may be as little as about 1% by weight of the total composition. In additional embodiments there is provided a safe and effective foamable pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition and foam comprising at least one active agent. In additional embodiments there is provided a safe and effective foamable pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition and foam comprising an effective amount of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic active agent, a hydrophobic solvent, a foamer complex and a liquefied or compressed gas propellant.\n\n[0021] The percent by weight is based on weight foamable composition; where the ratio of composition other than propellant to propellant is from about 100: 1 to about 100:30; or from about 100:3 to about 100:30; or from about 100:4 to about 100:25; or from about 100:7 to about 100: 17; or from about 100: 10 to about 100: 14 or from any one of the lower ratios to any one of the higher ratios.\n\n[0022] In one or more embodiments there is provided a composition comprising a propellant having a vapor pressure between about 10 psi and about 130 psi . In one or more embodiments there is provided a composition comprising a propellant which is hydrocarbon propellant or a hydrofluorocarbon or another environmentally acceptable propellant.\n\n[0023] The composition does not contain a surfactant; and the foaming effect is achieved by the addition of the foamer complex, as specified herein. The hydrophobic solvent is present in a substantial amount. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent is at a concentration between about 60% to about 95% by weight, or about 70% to about 90% by weight. In alternative embodiments the formulation, is formulated without propellant and delivered as a gel, ointment or rub. In one or more embodiments the composition comprises a concentration between about 1% to about 80% by weight petrolatum and about 15% to about 94% by weight hydrophobic solvent, wherein the total amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In one or more alternative embodiments the formulation comprises 0% to about 80%) by weight petrolatum and about 15% to about 95% by weight hydrophobic solvent, provided that if present the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight.\n\n[0024] In one or more alternative embodiments the formulation comprises 0% to about 91% petrolatum and about 4% to about 95% hydrophobic solvent, provided that if present the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In one or more alternative embodiments the formulation comprises 0% to about 95% petrolatum and about 0%) to about 95% hydrophobic solvent, provided that if present the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight.\n\n[0025] In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 1% to about 20% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 75% to about 94% provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 21 ) to about 40%) and the hydrophobic solvent is about 55% to about 74% provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 41% to about 60% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 35% to about 54% provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 61% to about 70%) and the hydrophobic solvent is about 25% to about 34% provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 61% to about 80% and the hydrophobic solvent is about 15% to about 34% provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight.\n\n[0026] In certain embodiments the petrolatum is about 81% to about 95% and the\n\nhydrophobic solvent is about 0.1% to about 14% , provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. According to additional embodiments where a petrolatum is present the formulation comprises about 1% to about 80% petrolatum and about 15% to about 94% hydrophobic solvent, provided that the combined amount of hydrophobic solvent and petrolatum is at least about 60% by weight. In further embodiments petrolatum may be in excess of about 80% (see for example formulation A8 in Table 9, which produced foam of excellent quality. In one or more embodiments, there is provided a foamable formulation comprising petrolatum in excess of about 80%, optionally a liquid oil, a fatty alcohol, and a wax, wherein the formulation generates quality breakable foam. In one or more embodiments, there is provided a foamable formulation comprising petrolatum in excess of about 80%, optionally a liquid oil, a fatty alcohol and/or a fatty acid, and/or a wax, wherein the formulation generates quality breakable foam. In one or more other embodiments, there is provided a foamable formulation comprising petrolatum in excess of about 80%, a liquid oil, and at least one of a fatty alcohol and/or a fatty acid, and/or a wax, wherein the formulation generates quality breakable foam.\n\n[0027] As will be appreciated from the above illustrative examples as the amount of petrolatum is increased the amount of hydrophobic solvent is reduced.

and foam properties\n\n[0060] In one or more embodiments, the composition is a gel that when packaged into an aerosol canister, equipped with a valve and pressurized with a liquid or pressurized gas propellant is capable of releasing a foam of quality that is breakable upon application of shear force but is not thermolabile at about or close to body temperature (about 36Â°C).\n\n[0061] The ability to achieve quality foam with a substantial concentration of hydrophobic solvent without a surfactant and/or without a polymer is surprising, because usually, such solvents are not prone to creating a foam. The challenge is not just to achieve a quality foam but also to attain a formulation that will satisfy a plurality of two, three, four, five, six or more of the following property specifications simultaneously.\n\n[0062] Notably, the pressurized composition is flowable and releases a foam freely, even though it might be expected that such concentrations of a fatty alcohol and fatty acid would make the hydrophobic solvent 'gel' or 'semi-solid'.\n\n1. Uniformity: The composition should be formulated so that it is and can remain uniform without phase separation or precipitation over time. This property is of high importance when the product is intended to be a pharmaceutical product.\n\n2. Flowability: The composition, when placed in an aerosol container and pressurized with a propellant should be flowable such that it can be expelled through the canister valve. It should preferably also be shakable inside the container. These requirements create a formulation challenge, because non-viscous flowable and shakable compositions are prone to undergo phase separation or precipitation.\n\n3. Quality: Upon release from the can, the composition should generate a foam of good or excellent quality having low density and small bubble size. 4. Stability/Breakability: The fine balance between stability and breakability of the foam coming out of the container is very delicate: on one hand the foam should preferably not be \"quick breaking\", i.e., it should be at least short term stable upon release from the pressurized container and not break as a result of exposure to skin temperature; and on the other hand, it should be \"breakable\", i.e., it should spread easily, break down and absorb into the skin or membrane upon application of mild shear force.\n\n5. Skin Feeling: To ensure patient compliance the skin feeling after application should be pleasant, and greasy or waxy residues should be minimal.\n\n6. Non-irritating: The above requirements should be achieved with the awareness that\n\nformulation excipients, especially surfactants, can be irritating, and should preferably be eliminated from the composition or reduced as much as possible.\n\n7. Delivery: Finally, the composition should also be designed to ensure efficient delivery of a therapeutic agent into the target site of treatment.\n\n8. Compatibility: The components of the composition should be compatible and not react with an active agent.\n\n[0063] Based on extensive investigations and trial and error experiments, it has been found that such properties can be achieved for formulations as described below and which are further advantageous because of the ability of hydrophobic solvents to dissolve or suspend certain active agents while providing an environment for the active agent which assists in preventing their degradation. In one or more embodiments there is provided a composition which is adapted to prevent the degradation of the active ingredient during storage in the canister and also upon application on the target site of treatment.\n\n[0064] In one or more embodiments there is provided prior to adding propellant a solid or semi- solid composition or gel. In one or more embodiments the composition or gel is a liquid. Examples of a liquid gel include where a propellant is added to the formulation (which prior to adding the propellant is a gel) or where the gel is loose or such that when subjected to gravity will pour or become liquid. In one or more embodiments the composition is thixotropic.\n\nCompositions\n\n[0065] All % values are provided on a weight (w/w) basis.\n\n[0066] In one or more embodiments where ever a phrase is used to refer to a concentration of above X% or below X% it can also include X% or of above about X% or below about X% it can also include about X%. [0067] In one or more embodiments the term \"about\" has its usual meaning in the context of pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations to allow for reasonable variations in amounts that can achieve the same effect. In one or more embodiments about can encompass a range of plus and minus 20%. In one or more embodiments about can encompass a range of plus and minus 10%.\n\n[0068] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable carrier composition including:\n\n1. a hydrophobic solvent\n\n2. a foamer complex comprising:\n\ni. a first member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty alcohol; and\n\nii. a second member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20%> by weight of\n\n1. a fatty acid; and/or\n\n2. a wax; or\n\n3. a liquefied or compressed gas propellant.\n\n[0069] In one or more certain embodiments shea butter may replace the second member.\n\n[0070] In one or more embodiments oily emollients are added to provide or improve a pleasant skin feeling, and/or lubricating effect with reduced friction. In one or more embodiments volatile silicones are added to reduce greasy feeling. In one or more embodiments waxes are added to improve rheology or stabilize foam structure. Surfactants play a role in foam formation and induce foam stability. In one or more embodiments the formulation is substantially or essentially free of surfactants. In one or more alternative embodiments a small amount of surfactant may be added preferably less than 1%. Scientific literature is not always accurate and may loosely or even inaccurately describe a substance as a surfactant. For example, fatty alcohols or fatty acids (in the absence of a base) when used in combination with classic surfactants have sometimes been referred to as surfactants, whereas at best they merely function as an aid to classic surfactant and may loosely be termed as a co-surfactant but they are not able to stabilize an emulsion and achieve a stable foam emulsion on their own without the presence of a true surfactant. (For more detail see \"co-surfactant\" below.) In the context of the present application such fatty acids and fatty alcohols are not surface active agents but are foam adjuvants. Similarly propoxylated lanolin oil derivatives have been loosely referred to as surfactants. In the context herein they are emollients not surfactants. In one or more embodiments the composition is essentially free of propoxylated lanolin oil derivatives. In one or more embodiments the composition is essentially free of ethoxylated lanolin oil derivatives. In further embodiments the compositions are free of such derivatives. In one or more certain embodiments the composition is free of PPG, lanolin oils, such as PPG 40 PEG 60 lanolin oil. In one or more embodiments foam adjuvants (e.g. fatty alcohols and fatty acids) and additives (such as Si02 which acts as a thickener and can provide thixotropy) are added to improve rheology or stabilize foam structure or as a protective agent. In one or more embodiments antioxidants can be used to prevent degradation /oxidation, for example, butylated hydroxytoluene, which is a fat soluble antioxidant.\n\n[0071] In one or more embodiments the foamable composition is substantially surfactant free. In one or more other embodiments it is essentially free of any surfactants.\n\n[0072] Upon release from an aerosol container, the foamable composition forms an expanded thermally stable breakable foam suitable for topical administration.\n\n[0073] The foamable composition is suitable for administration to various body areas, including, but not limited to the skin, a body surface, a body cavity, a mucosal surface, e.g., the mucosa of the nose, mouth and eye, the ear, the respiratory system, the vagina or the rectum (severally and interchangeably termed herein \"target site\").\n\n[0074] In one or more embodiments, the composition is waterless. By waterless is meant that the composition contains no or substantially no, free or unassociated or absorbed water. It will be understood by a person of the art that to the extent the waterless solvents and substances miscible with them of the present disclosure are hydrophilic, they can contain water in an associated or unfree or absorbed form and may absorb water from the atmosphere.\n\n[0075] According to one or more embodiments, the foamable composition further comprises one or more cosmetic active agents or a pharmaceutical active agents (severally and\n\ninterchangeably termed herein \"active agent\").\n\n[0076] In one or more embodiments the carrier comprises an active pharmaceutical or cosmetic agent which degrades in the presence of water, and in such cases the presence of water in the composition is clearly not desirable. Thus, in certain preferred embodiments, the composition is waterless. In other embodiments the active agent may tolerate the presence of a small amount of water and the waterless composition is substantially non-aqueous. The term \"substantially non-aqueous\" is intended to indicate that the waterless composition has water content preferably below about 2%, such as, below about 1.5%, below about 1%; or below about 0.5%. In one or more alternative embodiments, where for example, the formulation is for cosmetic purposes or where the active agent is not sensitive to water the formulation may contain low amounts of water of up to about 25%. In certain embodiments the amount of water is about or less than about 20%. In certain embodiments the amount of water is about or less than about 15%. In certain embodiments the amount of water is about or less than about 10%. In certain embodiments the amount of water is about or less than about 5%. Where water is present the formulation may be an emulsion or may form micelles or a colloid. In one or more embodiments the emulsion formulation has some resistance to centrifugation. In one or more embodiments the emulsion formulation is substantially resistant to centrifugation at about lOOOrpm for a few minutes or for about up to 10 minutes.\n\n[0077] In one or more embodiments there is provided a foamable therapeutic composition including:\n\n1. an active agent;\n\n2. a hydrophobic solvent\n\n3. a foamer complex comprising:\n\ni. a first member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty alcohol; and\n\nii. a second member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20%> by weight of\n\n1. a fatty acid; and/or\n\n2. a wax; or\n\n4. a liquefied or compressed gas propellant.\n\n[0078] In one or more embodiments, at least a portion of the therapeutic agent is suspended or dissolved evenly throughout the entire composition.\n\n[0079] It has been discovered that formulations containing high amount of a hydrophobic solvents (such as mineral oil) are not prone to foaming. Surprisingly, it has been further discovered that the combination of a fatty alcohol and fatty acid and/or a wax has foam boosting properties and provides breakable foams of good quality in the absence of customary surfactants. It has been discovered that fatty alcohols or fatty acids with a saturated carbon chain of between 16 to 22 carbons combined have outstanding foam boosting properties. It has been further discovered that the combination of a fatty alcohol with a fatty acid and a wax has improved foaming properties. It has been discovered that different factors can influence foaming properties. Non limiting examples include: a) the ratio of fatty alcohol to fatty acid e. g. foams of excellent quality that did not collapse after 180 seconds at 36Â°C were obtained with a ratio of fatty alcohol: fatty acid of 1 : 1 and a total concentration of fatty alcohol together with fatty acid ranging from about 7% to about 10%; b) the ratio of beeswax to hydrogenated castor oil; e.g. foams of good quality that did not collapse after 180 seconds at 36Â°C were obtained with a ratio of beeswax to hydrogenated castor oil of 1 : 1 or more, c) ratio of fatty alcohol to wax e.g. foams of good quality that did not collapse after 180 seconds at 36Â°C were obtained with a ratio of fatty alcohol to wax of 2:3 to 3:2. d) the type and concentration of propellant e.g. AP-70 and\n\nTetrafluoroethane improved foam quality in comparison to A-46.\n\n[0080] Furthermore, the oleaginous formulations of the present invention can provide foams of good quality in the presence of various active ingredients. It was found for example that compositions of the present invention comprising one or more of Doxycycline Hyclate, Betamethasone Valerate, Progesterone, Terbinafme, Metronidazole, Mometasone Furoate, Calcitriol, Calcipotriol and Naproxen can give rise to breakable foams of good to excellent quality which did not collapse for at least 2 minutes at 36Â°C.\n\n[0081] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is a vitamin A or a derivative or analog thereof.\n\n[0082] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is a vitamin E or a derivative or analog thereof.\n\n[0083] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is a vitamin K or a derivative or analog thereof.\n\n[0084] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is a vitamin F or a derivative or analog thereof.\n\n[0085] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is vitamin D or a derivative or analog thereof.\n\n[0086] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is calcipotriol.\n\n[0087] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is calcitriol.\n\n[0088] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is corticosteroid.\n\n[0089] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is mometasone furoate.\n\n[0090] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is doxycycline hyclate.\n\n[0091] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is betamethasone valerate. [0092] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is progesterone.\n\n[0093] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is terbinafme.\n\n[0094] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is metronidazole.\n\n[0095] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is naproxen.\n\n[0096] In one or more embodiments, the active agent is one or more of doxycycline hyclate, betamethasone valerate, progesterone, terbinafme, metronidazole, mometasone furoate, calcitriol, calcipotriol and naproxen.\n\n[0097] In one or more embodiments, the composition is essentially free of polyols.\n\n[0098] In one or more embodiments, composition is capable of providing intradermal delivery of the active agent into the skin with minimal or negligible transdermal delivery.\n\n[0099] In one or more embodiments, the composition has some preservative efficacy.\n\n[0100] In one or more embodiments, the composition is for use in eye infections.\n\n[0101] In one or more embodiments, the composition is physically and chemically stable for at least two months and wherein the active agent is compatible with and chemically stable in the composition.\n\n[0102] In one or more embodiments, the composition is physically and chemically stable for at least three months and wherein the active agent is compatible with and chemically stable in the composition.\n\n[0103] In one or more embodiments, the composition is physically and chemically stable for at least six months and wherein the active agent is compatible with and chemically stable in the composition.\n\n[0104] It was further found that different waxes had a different influence pre foam\n\nformulation (PFF) homogeneity. For example beeswax resulted PFF separation (decrease in homogeneity), whereas hydrogenated castor oil increased homogeneity. Paraffin wax 51-53 induced PFF separation in placebo formulation however homogeneity was surprisingly regained upon addition of minocycline. In one or more embodiments hydrogenated caster oil is used to prevent separation or to restore homogeneity. In one or more embodiments a tetracycline is used to prevent separation or to restore homogeneity. In one or more embodiments a paraffin is used to prevent separation or to restore homogeneity. [0105] In one or more embodiments, there is provided a substantially surfactant free composition comprising:\n\na) about 60% to about 95% by weight of a hydrophobic solvent;\n\nb) an oleaginous foamer complex comprising:\n\n(1) about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty alcohol; and\n\n(2) about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty acid and/or a wax; or\n\nc) an active agent,\n\nwherein the active agent is compatible with and chemically stable in the composition.\n\nHydrophobic Solvent\n\n[0106] In an embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises at least one hydrophobic organic solvent. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic organic solvent should be compatible with the active ingredient. Oils which are incompatible are omitted. For example, minocycline compositions will be free of pomegranate seed oil. A \"hydrophobic organic solvent\" (also termed \"hydrophobic solvent\") as used herein refers to a material having solubility in distilled water at ambient temperature of less than about 1 gm per 100 mL, more preferably less than about 0.5 gm per 100 mL, and most preferably less than about 0.1 gm per 100 mL. It is liquid at ambient temperature. The identification of a \"hydrophobic solvent\", as used herein, is not intended to characterize the solubilization capabilities of the solvent for any specific active agent or any other component of the foamable composition. Rather, such term is provided to aid in the identification of materials suitable for use as a hydrophobic solvent in the foamable compositions described herein.\n\n[0107] In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent is present at a concentration of about 60% to about 95% or about 65% to about 90%; or about 70% to about 90% or about 75% to about 85%.\n\n[0108] In one or more embodiments, the composition of the present invention comprises at least one hydrophobic solvent, selected from the group consisting of an oil including a mineral oil, a hydrocarbon oil, an ester oil, a liquid triglyceride oil, an oil of plant origin, an oil from animal origin, an unsaturated or polyunsaturated oil, a diglyceride, a PPG alkyl ether and a silicone oil.

In certain other embodiments a liquid hydrophobic solvent is not added. Fluidity of the composition can be achieved by utilizing liquidizing solvents (e.g. C12 C15 Alkyl benzoate) and/or liquefied propellants and/or optionally liquid adjuvants. Inclusion of higher amounts of propellant was found useful in order to improve flowability of the formulation from the canister or by using propellants having a higher vapor pressure.\n\n[0121] In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent is a natural oil, extracted from plants, such as the fruit of olives or avocado or from their seeds, such as, grape seed oil or pomegranate seed oil. Non limiting examples of suitable oils, which can also have a therapeutic effect, include almond oil, avocado oil, calendula oil, coconut oil, cocoglycerides, grape seed oil, jojoba oil, peanut oil, pomegranate seed oil, soy bean oil, and wheat germ oil. In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic solvent is a hydrocarbon based oil, such as light mineral oil or heavy mineral oil. Each oil has its own unique characteristics, as will be appreciated by a man of the art. Some are readily absorbed onto the skin, whist others are heavier or greasy and are less easily absorbed. It should be kept in mind that greasiness is a subjective feeling. With this caveat in mind pomegranate and avocado are thought to be oils with a greasier feeling. On the other hand jojoba, almond, grape seed, calendula and peanut oils are not considered greasy.\n\nSomewhere in between are soybean, wheat germ and coconut oils. Some oils have a strong natural odor, such as pomegranate seed oil whilst others display a milder odor, such as soybean, wheat germ, avocado, and almond. Others display a subtle or almost non existent odor, such as, jojoba, coconut, grape seed, calendula and peanut oil. Sometimes odor is a reflection of the level of processing the oil has undergone with a lower or disappearing odor reflecting a higher level of oil refinement. In an embodiment oils are blended to facilitate good absorption with unctuous occlusive properties. In one or more embodiments fragrance can be added to mask distinctive odors of oils. In one or more embodiments the oil is a mixture of two or more oils.\n\nFoamer Complex Components\n\n[0122] The foamer complex comprises: a first member, comprising about 0.1% to about 20% by weight of a fatty alcohol; and a second member, comprising about 0.1 %> to about 20%> by weight of a fatty acid; and/or a wax. In certain embodiments the amount of the first and second members respectively comprises about 0.4% to about 18% by weight. In certain embodiments the amount of the first and second members each respectively comprises about 0.6% to about 12% by weight. In certain embodiments the amount of the first and second members each respectively comprises about 0.8% to about 10% by weight. In certain embodiments the amount of the first and second members each respectively comprises about 2% to about 7% by weight. In certain other embodiments, the concentration of each member respectively can be within any one of the following ranges (i) between about 0.1 % and about 1%, (ii) between about 1% and about 5%, (iii) between about 5% and about 10%, or (iv) between about 10% and about 20%. In one or more embodiments, each member is at a concentration at about 5% to about 10% by weight.\n\nFatty Alcohol\n\n[0123] The foamer complex includes a fatty alcohol. The fatty alcohol which acts as a foam adjuvant is included in the foamable compositions as a main constituent, to evolve the foaming property of the composition and/or to stabilize the foam. In one or more embodiments, the fatty alcohol is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 15 or more carbons in their carbon chain, such as cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol (or mixtures thereof). Other examples of fatty alcohols are arachidyl alcohol (C20), behenyl alcohol (C22), tetracosanol, hexacosanol, octacosanol, triacontanol, tetratriacontanol,l-triacontanol (C30), as well as alcohols with longer carbon chains (up to C50). In one or more embodiments the fatty alcohol has a carbon chain length of 14 to 22 carbons. In one or more other embodiments, the fatty alcohol is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 14 or less carbons in their carbon chain, such as lauryl alcohol and myristyl alcohol. In an embodiment the fatty alcohol is a solid at room temperature. In an embodiment where the formulation is very viscous liquid fatty acids or fatty alcohols may for example be added, for example isostearic acid.\n\n[0124] In one or more preferred embodiments, the fatty alcohol is cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol and combinations thereof. Fatty alcohols, derived from beeswax and including a mixture of alcohols, a majority of which has at least 20 carbon atoms in their carbon chain, are suitable as fatty alcohols in the context herein. In certain embodiments the amount of the fatty alcohol required to support the foam system can be approximately inversely related to the length of its carbon chains. In one or more other embodiments, the fatty alcohol is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 14 or less carbons in their carbon chain, such as myristyl alcohol. Fatty alcohols are also useful in facilitating improved spreadability and absorption of the composition.\n\n[0125] Fatty alcohols are amphiphatic, however unlike customary surfactants, they cannot usually function as stand-alone surfactants, because of their very weak emulsifying capacity. They are occasionally used as non-ionic co-emulsifiers, i.e., and are commonly used as thickeners (Surfactants in personal care products and decorative cosmetics By Linda D. Rhein, Mitchell Schlossman, Anthony O'Lenick, P., Third Edition, 2006, p. 247). Fatty alcohols are generally regarded as safe and they are not considered as irritants.\n\n[0126] An important property of the fatty alcohols used in context of the composition disclosed herein is related to their therapeutic properties per se. Long chain saturated and mono unsaturated fatty alcohols, e.g., stearyl alcohol, erucyl alcohol, arachidyl alcohol and behenyl alcohol (docosanol) have been reported to possess antiviral, antiinfective, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties (see, U.S. Patent No. 4,874,794). Longer chain fatty alcohols, e.g., tetracosanol, hexacosanol, heptacosanol, octacosanol, triacontanol, etc., are also known for their metabolism modifying properties and tissue energizing properties.\n\nFatty Acid\n\n[0127] The foamer complex further includes a fatty acid. The fatty acid which acts as a foam adjuvant is included in the foamable compositions to evolve the foaming property of the composition and/or to stabilize the foam. In one or more embodiments the fatty acid can have 16 or more carbons in its carbon chain, such as hexadecanoic acid (CI 6) heptadecanoic acid ,stearic acid (CI 8), arachidic acid (C20), behenic acid (C22), tetracosanoic acid (C24), hexacosanoic acid (C26), heptacosanoic acid (C27), octacosanoic acid (C28), triacontanoic acid, dotriacontanoic acid, tritriacontanoic acid, tetratriacontanoic acid and pentatriacontanoic acid, as well as fatty acids with longer carbon chains (up to C50), or mixtures thereof. In one or more other embodiments, the fatty acid is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols having 14 or less carbons in their carbon chain, such as dodecanoic acid myristic acid, myristoleic acid, and lauric acid.\n\n[0128] Optionally, the carbon atom chain of the fatty acid may have at least one double bond; alternatively, the fatty acid can be a branched fatty acid. The carbon chain of the fatty acid also can be substituted with a hydroxyl group, such as 12-hydroxy stearic acid. In one or more preferred embodiments, the fatty acid is stearic acid.\n\nWaxes\n\n[0129] The oleaginous foamer complex may include a wax. The wax which acts as a foam adjuvant is included in the foamable compositions to evolve the foaming property of the composition and/or to stabilize the foam. Wax refers to beeswax or another substance with similar properties. The term wax refers to a class of substances with properties similar to beeswax, in respect of (i) plastic behavior at normal ambient temperatures, a melting point above approximately 45Â°C, (ii) a relatively low viscosity when melted (unlike many plastics); and (iii) hydrophobic nature. Suitable exemplary waxes which can be incorporated into the formulation include animal, vegetable, mineral or silicone based waxes which may be natural or synthetic such as, for example: beeswax, Chinese wax, lanolin (wool wax), shellac wax, bayberry wax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax, castor wax, esparto wax, japan wax, ouricury wax, rice bran wax, soy wax, hydrogenated oil such as hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, or hydrogenated jojoba oil, mink wax, motan wax, ouricury wax, ozokerite, PEG-6 beeswax, rezowax, spent grain wax, stearyl dimethicone, paraffin waxes, such as paraffin 42-44, 51-53, 58- 62 wax, and the like and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the term wax can extend to hydrogenated oils. In one or more preferred embodiments, the wax is a beeswax or hydrogenated castor oil.\n\n[0130] Paraffin wax is unique among other hydrocarbon chains by having a CST of about 25 (e.g., 25.5), which is about in the middle of the hydrophobic range. Thus, paraffin waxes are somewhat amphipatic which may also contribute to foam stability. Notably, in comparison to longer hydrocarbons, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, paraffin wax is much more hydrophobic, thereby decreasing the surface tension of the hydrophobic solvents in the composition and facilitating foam formation and stabilization (the CST of polypropylene 31.0 and polyethylene 33.0).\n\n[0131] Hydrogenated castor oil consists mainly of triglycerides of hydroxystearic acid and is a solid wax.\n\n[0132] Beeswax contains a high proportion of wax esters (35 to 80%), which are linear monoesters of straight-chain fatty alcohols with even-numbered carbon chains from C24 to C36 esterified with straight-chain fatty acids such as 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids some with hydroxyl groups in the Ï-2 and Ï-3 positions. The wax esters consist of C40 to C46 molecular species, Also present are free acids (about 14%) and carbohydrates (about 12%) as well as approximately 1% free wax alcohols and stearic esters of fatty acids.\n\n[0133] In one or more embodiments, the wax is a polyolefm such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polymethylpentene , polybutene, a polyolefm elastomer, polyisobutylene , ethylene propylene rubber, ethylene propylene diene Monomer (M-class) rubber, polyethylene terephthalate, polydicyclopentadiene, linear polyolefms, branched polyolefms, cyclic polyolefins, low density polyolefins, high density polyolefins, polyolefins with a low molecular weight, polyolefins with a high molecular weight, halogenated polyolefins and the like and mixture thereof.\n\n[0134] In one or more embodiments, the wax is polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl fluoride, polytetrafiuoro ethylene, polychlorotrifiuoro ethylene, polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, polymethylpentene and the like and mixture thereof.\n\n[0135] In an embodiment the wax is selected from the group consisting of beeswax, Chinese wax, lanolin wax, shellac wax, bayberry wax, candeliUa wax, carnauba wax, castor wax, esparto wax, japan wax, ouricury wax, rice bran wax, soy wax, a hydrogenated oil, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, or hydrogenated jojoba oil, mink wax, montan wax, ozokerite, PEG-6 beeswax, rezo wax, spent grain wax, stearyl dimethicone, a paraffin wax, paraffin 58- 62Â°C wax , paraffin 51 -53Â°C wax, paraffin 42-44Â°C wax.\n\n[0136] In an embodiment the wax is selected from the waxes, as described in \"The Complete Technology Book on Wax and Polishes, Publisher: Asia Pacific Business Press Inc., 2006\" as incorporated herein by reference.\n\n[0137] In one or more embodiments the wax includes vegetable wax, bayberry wax, candeliUa wax, carnauba wax, flower wax, sandy wax, fat wax, cotton wax, esparto wax, fir wax, flax wax, Japan wax, ouricury wax, palm waxes, Cuban palm wax, rice-oil wax, sugar cane wax, ucuhuba wax, or cocoa butter.\n\n[0138] In one or more embodiments the wax includes synthetic mineral wax, fischer-tropsch wax, duroxon wax, or polymekon wax.\n\n[0139] In one or more embodiments the wax includes miscellaneous synthetic waxes, albacer wax, atlasene wax, BASF waxes, cardis waxes, ceramid, glyco Waxes, flexo wax, or oxazoline waxes.\n\nCombination of a fatty alcohol and a fatty acid and/or a wax\n\n[0140] In Example 11, which looks at prior art formulations with a fatty alcohol, alone, a foam of good quality is not obtained. When, however, a fatty alcohol (or a mixture of fatty alcohols) is combined with a fatty acid (or a mixture of fatty acids) and/or a wax (or a mixture of waxes), they can, surprisingly, act synergistically to produce a good quality breakable foam. These successful combinations of a fatty alcohol and a fatty acid or a fatty alcohol and a wax are referred to herein as \"foamer complexes\".\n\n[0141] In one or more embodiments, the foamer complex is a synergistic combination of a fatty alcohol (or a mixture of fatty alcohols) and a fatty acid (or a mixture of fatty acids).\n\n[0142] In one or more embodiments, the foamer complex is a synergistic combination of a fatty alcohol (or a mixture of fatty alcohols) and a wax (or a mixture of waxes).\n\n[0143] In one or more embodiments, the foamer complex is a synergistic combination of a fatty alcohol (or a mixture of fatty alcohols), a fatty acid (or a mixture of fatty acids) and a wax (or a mixture of waxes).\n\n[0144] In one or more embodiments the range of ratio of fatty alcohol to fatty acid/wax can be about 100: 1 to about 1 : 100; or about 90:1 to about 1 :45; or about 80: 1 to about 1 :40; or about 70: 1 to about 1 :35; or about 60: 1 to about 1 :30; or about 50:1 to about 1 :25; or about 40: 1 to about 1 :20; or about 30: 1 to about 1 : 15; or about 20: 1 to about 1 : 10; or about 15: 1 to about 1 :5; or about 10: 1 to about 1 : 1 ; or any ranges in between such as 1 :20 to 20 : 1 , or preferably from 1 : 10 to 10: 1, or 1 :4 to 4: 1, or 2:3 or 3:2.\n\nCombination of a fatty alcohol and a fatty acid and/or shea butter\n\n[0145] In one or more embodiments the foamer complex can be a fatty alcohol and shea butter, a fatty acid and shea butter or a combination of a fatty alcohol and a fatty acid and shea butter. Shea butter may, for example, be used instead of paraffin wax or instead of bees wax or instead of hydrogenated caster oil or to complement one or more of them. As can be appreciated from Example 22, wax and/or shea butter comprising complexes can be effective with petrolatum based compositions.\n\n[0146] In one or more embodiments oily emollients are added to provide or improve a pleasant skin feeling, and/or lubricating effect with reduced friction. In one or more embodiments volatile silicones are added to reduce greasy feeling. In one or more embodiments various waxes are added to improve rheology or stabilize foam structure.\n\nPropellant\n\n[0147] The composition requires the addition of a propellant in order to generate a foam.\n\n[0148] Suitable propellants include volatile hydrocarbons such as butane, propane, isobutene or mixtures thereof. In one or more embodiments a hydrocarbon mixture AP-70 is used. In one or more other embodiments a lower pressure hydrocarbon mixture AP-46 is used. Both contain butane, propane, isobut"
