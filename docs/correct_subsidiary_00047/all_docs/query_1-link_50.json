        "meta_description": "Puma Biotechnology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care.  Puma in-licensed the global development and commercialization rights to PB272 (neratinib, oral), PB272 (neratinib, intravenous), and PB357 in 2011.  In 2022, Puma in-licensed global research and development and commercial rights to alisertib, a selective, small molecule, orally administered inhibitor of aurora kinase A.\n\nNeratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4.  Puma has been focused on developing the oral version of neratinib, and its most advanced drug candidates are directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.  Puma believes that neratinib has clinical applications in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2.\n\nNeratinib, oral was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Puma commenced commercial sales of the drug in 2017 and it is marketed in the United States as NERLYNX® tablets.  In February 2020, NERLYNX was also approved by the FDA in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting.  \n\nNERLYNX was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission in 2018 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor-positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.  Commercial sales commenced in the European Union in 2019. \n\nPuma has entered into additional exclusive license agreements with various parties to commercialize NERLYNX in regions outside the United States, including the European Union, Canada, Latin America, Greater China, Israel, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, the Middle East, and parts of Africa.  Puma plans to continue to pursue the commercialization of NERLYNX outside the United States. \n\nAlisertib is an adenosine triphosphatecompetitive and reversible inhibitor of aurora kinase A and results in disruption of mitosis leading to apoptosis of rapidly proliferating tumor cells that are dependent on aurora kinase A. Alisertib has been tested in clinical trials in patients with metastatic cancers including breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, peripheral T cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia.  Puma initially intends to focus the development of alisertib on the treatment of patients with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) HER2-negative breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and small cell lung cancer. \n\nAlan H. Auerbach has served as Chairman of the Board, CEO and President of Puma Biotechnology, Inc. since he founded the Company in 2010.  Prior to Puma, Mr. Auerbach served as CEO, President and a Member of the Board of Directors of Cougar Biotechnology, Inc., from its inception in 2003 until its acquisition by Johnson & Johnson in July 2009.\n\nFrom July 2009 until January 2010, Mr. Auerbach served as Co-Chairman of the Integration Steering Committee at Cougar (as part of J&J), providing leadership and oversight for the development and global commercialization of Cougar's lead product candidate, abiraterone acetate.  Abiraterone (Zytiga) was approved for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer in the U.S. in April 2011 and in the EU in September 2011.\n\nPrior to founding Cougar, from June 1998 to April 2003 Mr. Auerbach was Vice President, Senior Research Analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, where he was responsible for research coverage of small- and mid-cap biotechnology companies, with a focus on oncology. He had primary responsibility for technical, scientific and clinical due diligence, and selected biotechnology companies followed by the company. In 2002, Mr. Auerbach ranked second in the NASDAQ/Starmine survey of analyst performance for stock picking in biotechnology. From August 1997 to May 1998, Mr. Auerbach was Vice President, Research Analyst at the Seidler Companies, Inc., where he was responsible for research coverage of small-cap biotechnology companies. Prior to his work as a securities analyst, Mr. Auerbach worked for Diagnostic Products Corporation, where he designed and implemented clinical trials in the field of oncology.\n\nMr. Auerbach received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University and an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Southern California.\n\nPuma Biotechnology, Inc., founded in 2010, is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.
