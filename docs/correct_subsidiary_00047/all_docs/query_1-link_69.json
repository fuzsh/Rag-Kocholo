Next the businesses will under perform and corporate scrutiny will mount and then they'll fire Bill.\n\nWe've all seen the movie before.\n\nNice spin to your story, but the reality is that he has built businesses. With Stiefel, it resulted in the sale to GSK and the Stiefel family walked away with huge $$$. As for your story, Bill was not fired.....it was you that was fired. Truth hurts, moron.\n\nNice spin to your story, but the reality is that he has built businesses. With Stiefel, it resulted in the sale to GSK and the Stiefel family walked away with huge $$$. As for your story, Bill was not fired.....it was you that was fired. Truth hurts, moron.\n\nIt was nice of Bill to make all that money for the Stiefel family. What was it that the employees got ?\n\nA former employee of Stiefel Laboratories won a $1.5 million verdict on allegations that the Coral Gables-based company defrauded its employee shareholders during its $2.9 billion sale to GlaxoSmithKline in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, U.S. District Judge James King blocked a $226 million lawsuit against Steifel from the former employees from obtaining class action certification, but he allowed individuals to pursue the claims separately. The lawsuit alleged that the employees were told the stock was worth $16,469 per share, but the companyâ€™s directors, including former Chairman and CEO Charles Stiefel, knew it was really worth $60,000 per share. The company re-purchased shares from employees at the lower value.\n\nNow, following a jury trial, Judge King has awarded former Stiefel Labs employee Timothy Finnerty $1.5 million in damages against Stiefel Labs and its former CEO. Finnerty was represented by Podhurst Orseck attorney Peter Prieto and attorney Norman S. Segall . Other lawsuits against the company are pending.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission also has a civil lawsuit against Stiefel Labs and Stiefel over similar allegations. The company and Stiefel are disputing the claims.\n\nObserving the thread from the beginning, it is amusing to see the back and forth argument between these two, three, four or however many people are commenting. The one thing that does stand out is the person who claims he is \"not Bill\". For someone who is \"not Bill\", they spend an awful lot of time and effort to respond and defend anything regarding Bill. If you aren't Bill, who the hell are you ? And why do you care so much by responding to every single comment made, in such a timely manner ? Amazing ! Please, for the amusement of us all...continue on !\n\nObserving the thread from the beginning, it is amusing to see the back and forth argument between these two, three, four or however many people are commenting.

I actually don't mind sour grapes either...so I don't know why you are trying to call me out for some reason. I was merely making an observation.\n\nBtw, the truth is becoming more and more apparent...you may actually be Bill ! Thanks for responding & have a great weekend Bill !!!\n\nI really didn't have an axe to grind.

This thing is getting more screwed up by the day. Just read the GSK board and you will see.\n\nI was a fan of Bill for a long time. The company grew tremendously when he became our leader. Much of that came with buying companies and products. He is a great communicator and you want to believe him. So what happened? Well, R&D failed to deliver as well as various goofs by manufacturing. Sure, you can try to blame someone else, but it is the job of the leader to make sure everyone executes. You can't take credit for the good things and then blame others for the failures. Ask around. Most people will tell you that he mentally checked out about a year before leaving.\n\nHere we are today. Most of the sales have disappeared and very few of us are left. Stiefel is all but gone. Very sad."
