        "text": "Bio\n\nEugene Bauer is immediate past co-founder, Chief Medical Officer and member of the board of directors of Dermira, Inc., a biotechnology company recently acquired by Eli Lilly and Company. Prior to founding Dermira, he served as a member of the board of directors of Peplin, Inc., where he also was its President and Chief Medical Officer, until Peplinâ€™s acquisition by LEO Pharma in 2009. During 2004-2008, Dr. Bauer was Chief Executive Officer of Neosil, Inc., a clinical stage dermatology company, acquired by Peplin, Inc., in 2008. Prior to that he was co-founder and member of the board of directors at Connetics, a commercial dermatology company acquired by Stiefel Laboratories in 2009. Before initiating a career in industry, Dr. Bauer served as Chairman of the Department of Dermatology (1988-1995) and as the Dean of the School of Medicine (1995-2001) of Stanford University. He is currently Lucy Becker Professor, Emeritus, in Stanford University School of Medicine, a position he has held since 2002.\n\nDr. Bauer has served on the boards of directors of a number of public and private companies, including Aevi Genomic Medicine, Inc. (formerly Medgenics, Inc.), First Wave Technologies, Inc., and Kadmon Holdings, Inc.\n\nDr. Bauer was a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded investigator for 25 years and has served on numerous advisory groups for the NIH. He has been elected to several honorific societies, including the National Academy of Medicine of the United States.\n\nDr. Bauer received a B.S. in medicine and an M.D. from Northwestern University.\n\nCurrent Research and Scholarly Interests\n\nThe three areas of research are:\n\n(1) defining the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in connective tissue remodeling of the skin;\n\n(2) defining the macromolecular structures and their interactions in the cutaneous basement membrane zone (BMZ); and\n\n(3) developing methods for delivery of extracutaneous gene therapy in epidermolysis bullosa.\n\nMatrix metalloproteinases are pivotal enzymes in connective tissue remodeling. The events in signal transduction that govern MMP expression and activity and expression of inhibitory proteins are crucial for understanding wound healing, tumorigenesis, and certain genetic diseases.\n\nThe cutaneous BMZ is a complex structure at the interface of the epidermis and dermis. The synthesis, secretion and organization of macromolecules of the BMZ involve regulatory events that dictate integrity of the skin, that are crucial for wound healing, and that can be aberrant in genetic diseases. Our laboratory focuses on discovery, cloning, sequencing, and creating gene therapy approaches for patients with hereditary forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a serious (potentially lethal) skin disease."
