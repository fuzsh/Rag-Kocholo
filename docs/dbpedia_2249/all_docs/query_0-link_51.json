The young family affair (the lineupconsisted of two brothers and threeof their cousins, one of which was 12-year-old drummer Andy Galeon) debuted in 1987 withThe Ultraviolence, their fastest and heaviestalbum, but also their most conventional, as the followups Frolic Through The Parkand Act are where the band really started to spread theirwings, cultivating a loyal following with their highly inventive take onthrash. With the departure of vocalist Mark Osegueda, however, the banddecided to change both name and style, and so twoalbums were released as The Organization, neither of which really caught on with the public,and the band quietly faded away.The members carried on in various local bands (one of which was Swarm), but it wasn't until 2002 that four ofthe five originalmembers got back together and officially reformed the band. May 2004 sees the first product of the reunion, in the form ofTheArt Of Dying. In many respects the new album continues where the last left off, though their unique style preventing thealbum from soundingstale or dated. Death Angel remains one of the creative forces in thrash, and The Art Of Dying is a welcomecomeback from the band. Â« hide"
