        "text": "It’d be impossible to pinpoint one exact moment in time that truly encapsulates the long, colorful and often bloody history of heavy metal, but if forced to choose, 1985 would make for a strong contender. The genre had finally begun to find its footing, emerging from the hazy days of the proto-metal 70s to gain strength, power and, most importantly, speed.\n\nBy that point, the bloated 70s heavy rock titans had fallen out of favor, displaced by leaner upstarts. The new wave of British heavy metal had already washed up on American shores, bringing with it all of the style and finesse of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, as well as the wilder and grittier sounds of Motorhead, Saxon and Venom. Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin launched their first reunion attempts. Iron Maiden, still high on the fumes of 1984’s triumphant Powerslave, set a high-water mark for live albums with Live After Death, while Venom released Possessed, Judas Priest set to work on Turbo, Saxon gave no ground with Innocence Is No Excuse, and all-woman outfit Girlschool hit the ground hard with Running Wild.\n\nOn the west coast and on the airwaves, glam was still king. The Sunset Strip was alive with the wailing solos, risqué spandex and sky-high hair of bands like Poison, Mötley Crüe and Cinderella, while New Jersey’s Bon Jovi held it down out east – and Guns N’ Roses would come to rule them all.\n\nTwo popular outfits, the LA Guns and Hollywood Rose, had imploded in tandem. From their ashes rose one of hard rock’s most famous bands, and two of its most revered (and polarizing) figures: the flame-haired Axl Rose and the top-hatted, hard-partying Slash. And while Guns N’ Roses’ 80s output sounds pretty tame by today’s standards – especially if you’re used to blasting Watain, not Warrant – when those first few albums came out they were regarded as downright dangerous.\n\nEven as bands like Quiet Riot, Ratt and Alice Cooper were still enjoying considerable popularity and mainstream exposure, something darker began to bubble up beneath the surface. The nascent snarl of early punk rock had already smeared itself all over metal’s pristine finish several years before. (Just listen to Venom’s breakthrough Black Metal and try to deny it.) It crystallized into what would forever be known thereafter as “crossover thrash”, best exemplified by one of metal’s very first supergroups, Stormtroopers of Death.\n\nThey burst on the scene with a built-for-controversy debut album entitled Speak English or Die. Composed of members of Anthrax, Nuclear Assault and brusque young vocalist Billy “Mosh” Milano, SOD turned heads both with their infuriatingly catchy, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it punk-charged thrash blasts, and lyrics that ranged from tongue-in-cheek to downright ignorant, of which bassist (and metal legend in his own right) Dan Lilker has stated plainly: “The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.” It’s probably no coincidence that the same year saw Carnivore’s debut – the gory shock-thrash band led by brooding frontman Pete Steele, before he headed into gloomier pastures with Type O Negative.\n\nBy the time 1985 hit, thrash metal itself was off to a healthy head start, beginning several years prior with the rise of the Bay Area titans-to-be Metallica, Exodus and Megadeth, LA’s Slayer and New York City’s Anthrax. That year saw Exodus release Bonded by Blood, which remains their most hallowed work. Anthrax released Spreading the Disease, their first album to feature legendary vocalist Joey Belladonna. Slayer unleashed Hell Awaits upon the unwitting masses. Megadeth released their brazen debut, Killing Is My Business ... and Business Is Good! while frontman Dave Mustaine’s former bandmates in Metallica were holed up writing the follow-up to 1984’s Ride the Lightning, an album that would become 1986’s watershed Master of Puppets.\n\nApocalypse-obsessed New Yorkers Nuclear Assault also released a pair of demos, while Florida death metal began taking baby steps toward greatness with the release of a slew of Death demos and rehearsal tapes (more than a dozen in 1985 alone). Heretic transitioned into Morbid Angel, and San Francisco’s Possessed released their great death/thrash milestone, Seven Churches. Chicago’s Trouble saw the light on their soon-to-be-classic The Skull; that same year, Oakland’s Neurosis formed and soon began their measured evolution from crusty hardcore punks into today’s revered elder statesmen of doom.\n\nOf course, 1985’s metal dominance was not purely an American phenomenon. Down south, Sepultura scoured South America with their Bestial Devastation EP – unwittingly influencing another gang of Brazilian teenagers to dub themselves Sarcófago and make its dark mark upon the still-embryonic black metal genre.\n\nAcross the sea in Germany, Kreator offered up their debut, Endless Pain; Helloween kept the heavy metal faith on Walls of Jericho; and trad metallers Warlock (helmed by Doro Pesch) released their second LP, Hellbound. In the UK, punks-turned-speed fiends Napalm Death were busy inventing grindcore (1985 saw the debut of their lauded Hatred Surge EP) as Carcass honed their craft up north and Extreme Noise Terror formed on the fringes of the crustcore scene.\n\nIn Switzerland, Hellhammer’s primitive, thrash-influenced noise transitioned into the more refined yet no less barbaric sounds of Celtic Frost, whose timeless debut To Mega Therion was released in 1985. Denmark’s Mercyful Fate had already released two of its greatest classics – 1983’s Melissa and 1984’s Don’t Break the Oath – and demonic ringleader King Diamond had just set out on what would become an amazingly long-lived, successful solo career of his own. In Sweden, Quorthon, the sole mastermind behind Bathory, unleashed the sadistic darkness of The Return upon Scandinavia. Mayhem would soon rain Pure Fucking Armageddon upon the heads of the faithful, Tormentor would rise up from the Hungarian shadows, and Master’s Hammer would soon kickstart a grand legacy of Czech black metal brilliance ... but that’s another story.\n\nI could go on, marveling over the seemingly endless number of milestones that litter that particular set of 365 days, but I daresay you get the idea. Thirty years since it first gripped the genre in an iron fist, 1985 still radiates pure metal magic. Ten years earlier came the stripped-down Motorhead as a reaction to disco’s excess; 1995 brought us some of the best Scandinavian extreme metal the world has ever seen; 2005 saw the rise of mainstream metalcore and a modern obsession with technique."
