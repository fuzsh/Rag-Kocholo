        "text": "Thrash Metal was (and some times still is) a cornerstone of the heavy metal genre throughout the 1980s decade. Never has there been a movement that all have had a similar approach and attitude but all different sound (for some). Thrash Metal was a mix between speed metal, New Wave British heavy metal and hardcore punk into one mix and it’s a subgenre that both the most recognizable & appealing that ever came out of the metal community. Thrash is the most commercially successful division of heavy metal that still makes an everlasting appeal for those who grew up with the bands and new comers of the scene. Of course anyone will tell you that the big four is all you need to know about thrash (i.e. Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, & Anthrax). If that really is all you pay attention to then you’re really missing out the very best that the metal scene has to offer. Check these ten bands out that really is the definite best metal bands.\n\nNumber 10. – Slayer\n\nSlayer is one of those metal acts that’s highly mistaken as a great band for being sonically heavy, and only that. Mainly I blame Reign in Blood the band’s biggest appeal that the rest of their discography after it has always sounded the same damn shit; making them clearly one-trick-ponies at its finest. Their approach as musicians (if you can really call them that) is to be the heaviest band alive. Great job accomplishing that, but what about the melodies and variety of tones other than sounding like Reign in Blood all the goddamn time? Any band can be heavier and heavier all they want, but the substance of the sound becomes stale and always expected. They’ve done enough doing too many Satanic music throughout their existence and they’re running out of anything creative which is why I’m not going to miss them much once they finish their final tour in 2019.\n\nNumber 9. – Sodom\n\nThere’s nothing like German heavy metal and for a band from that country to tackle their own take of Thrash means that something violence & loud is approaching. With fifteen LP released under their belt, they’ve shown that they’re a mainstay for many fans of Thrash. How can you ever disregard the awesomeness of Agent Orange & Persecution Mania? They’re really not only the band’s two masterpieces but also some of the best that Thrash had to offer. It’s unfortunate that Sodom has suffered a lot of their appeal with nearly every release through the 1990s to today. I just somehow go autopilot when trying to finish any of their recent releases and continue to gravitate towards the two albums that put them on the map.\n\nNumber 8. – Exodus\n\nWho can ever forget how truly nightmarish Exodus’s debut album “Bounded By Blood” was upon first listen. That album cover made so many non-metal fans disturbed for ages and the rest of us knew that it was a statement. I wish I can put Exodus in higher regard, but they’ve been cursed with inconsistent releases by having an equal amount of good albums & bad albums under their discography. The band has been really doing very well for themselves remaining relevant all of these years and their recent releases are still listenable. It’s just unfortunate for Exodus that Bounded By Blood is their flagship album and never have they’ve been capable of topping it off.\n\nNumber 7. – Metallica\n\nI bet some of you casual Thrash fans are insulted that Metallica didn’t make it to number one; let alone enter any spot in the top five. I’ll never will dispute any of Metallica’s accomplishment for the Thrash Metal scene throughout their time in the 1980s. “Kill Em All,” “Ride The Lightning,” “Master of Puppets,” & “…And Justice For All” will always be replayed more times than we watch Star Wars. But can you really ignore their true creative downfall past those albums onward? “The Black Album,” “Load,” & “Reload” were hardly even Thrash and fall under… just metal for the lack of a better term. Metallica is even responsible for some of the worst albums ever created like “St. Anger,” & “Lulu” that were sonic abominations; never can ever be considered music. Nearly everything Metallica released nowadays has been really examples of them being victims of their own success. Though whenever the metal scene gets any buzz, it’s normally Metallica being the ones getting the spotlight. But popularity will never be quality. Just watch any of them play live with their recent songs and you’ll be seeing the crowd waiting for the next song to play so they can sing along. What a way to waste die-hard fans’ time. I’d rather just play their first four albums instead of going to see them live to remind me that they’re not the same band.\n\nNumber 6. – Sepultura\n\nEveryone needs to remember that Thrash is not exclusive to America & European countries because a Brazilian Thrash band crashed the party. Unlike every Thrash band that lost their edge and identity when the 1990s rolled in, Sepultura was some of the few bands that still made Thrash from becoming extinct when other metal subgenres emerged. I still am puzzled whether “Beneath the Remains,” “Arise,” “Chaos A.D.,” or “Roots” really is truly Sepultura’s best album. Even their releases in the modern day, Sepultura has still remain consistent and never forgot their roots from the Thrash scene. Sepultura is that band that makes sure that their sound never runs out of steam nor do they begin to run out of ideas to keep the band moving. Nevertheless, Sepultura has carried on, led by guitarist Kisser, and their efforts have hardly been in vain – it’s just that fans will never be at peace over the way Sepultura’s incredible career was so rudely interrupted, while always hoping against hope for the group’s “classic” foursome to bury the hatchet. Hey, stranger reunions have happened in the realm of rock and roll bands, so we can only hope…\n\nNumber 5. – Testament\n\nIf you’re discussing about any band outside of the big four, Testament always seems to be mentioned in many conversations. Testament may not be the wildest or heaviest band around, but they are some of the boldest Thrash bands you’ll ever come across. You can simply tell that their sound’s lasting appeal will keep the band thriving throughout the ages. I’ll never forget my time with “Practice What You Preach” being the perfect introduction for me before jumping into “The Legacy,” “The New Order,” and “The Gathering” that made me convinced that they deserved more recognition than what they’re getting right now. Testament plays it smart by releasing albums wisely by just celebrating what they released for a good while then jump to the next project when the time is right. Though I await for something greater than “The Gathering” their latest album “Brotherhood of the Snake” still convinces me that they area great band after all of these years. It’s Thrash Bands like Testament that makes the term “Big Four Thrash Bands” completely meaningless when they’re not included.\n\nNumber 4. – Death Angel\n\nIt goes without saying that Death Angel is the most underrated Thrash metal band ever. It’s such a shame that the metal community does a piss poor job in not showing us this band as much because Death Angel has no bad album in their discography. Unlike the likes of Metallica, the band knew when it was time to begin, time to go on hiatus, and when is it appropriate to make a return. Because they know what’s the right timing for the band and how to innovate thrash riffs and songwriting, is why Death Angel doesn’t have a single bad album in their discography. Death Angel know how to satisfy an audience whose hungry for the thrash sound that’s absent from their favorite bands. Death Angel is always a great substitute for fun when there’s nothing going on. Though they were absent in the 1990s, but their return in the mid-2000s made all of us fans welcome them in open arms. In a matter fact, Death Angel’s modern releases is every bit as good as, if not better than, their early days during their first run. That’s every bit of a sign of a good group of musicians if I ever saw one.\n\nNumber 3. – Kreator\n\nUnlike all the others below the list, Kreator never seized to display how violent German Thrash metal can possibly be. Beating out other German thrash bands like Destruction & Sodom, Kreator proved to be the kings of thrash in all of Europe. Keator is just one of those rare bands that hardly has a band album in their discography. This thrash band hardly ever toned down their reckless sound and continue to explore that they can get away with. It’s okay for bands like Slayer to get heavy but if there’s an absence in melodies and various styles of song writing then you failed as a musician. That’s something Kreator constantly does; always find a way to get heavy but never abandon melodies that makes thrash a musical sensation. Nevertheless, Kreator weathered these challenges more nimbly than most ‘80s metal survivors, and delivered a string of adventurous, occasionally superior records, between 1992’s Renewal and 1999’s Endorama. And when the new millennium dawned, Kreator were ready to thrash once again, with stellar efforts like Violent Revolution and Phantom Antichrist beating most of their original peers to the punch, and showing the next generation how things were done at the beginning. As of today, nothing hints that Kreator plan on slowing down or relinquishing their Teutonic thrash throne anytime soon nor they ever will.\n\nNumber 2. – Megadeth\n\nIn my eyes, the only band that’s within the “Big Four Thrash Bands” that is not only the best but still is able to musically impress me is Megadeth. As much as Dave Mustaine feels bitter being kicked out of Metallica, it happens to be the best thing that ever happened to him. As much as Metallica completely abandoned the sound that’s loved around the world, Megadeth remained that sound and continue its evolution. I always will feel right at home when Vic Rattlehead still makes his mascot appearance for the band and never sound like a different band. Part of it’s success is Mustaine’s is that he never changed. Even his recent faith in Christ did not ruin any once of the band’s sound. All this nuclear apocalypse, government conspiracies, and anarchy against all government figures made the band what they are. Sure they still make rivalries and controversies since the band existed and they have made plenty of bad albums along the way, but Megadeth certainly makes up for it when they pick themselves back up and continue making better albums. Not a single bad record can ever make any of us fans turn away because we’re guaranteed that we’ll be treated with the next best thing from the band. Megadeth has been my favorite rebels in music that makes all punk & metal bands envy that they can still go. Go ahead an start listening to Megadeth and you can see why it’s one of thetoplister’s favorite bands.\n\nNumber 1. – Overkill\n\nOut of all the bands I’ve ever encountered in my lifetime, this New Jersey Thrash Metal band has remained the most consistent. While everyone in the list tried to deviate themselves from their roots, Overkill never forgot. Who else was still making 1980s style thrash when everyone moved on in the 1990s? Fucking nineteen albums in their discography, the band has never changed; only evolved. Overkill’s greatness still lies on the music that they’ve accomplished in the past and the nonstop masterpieces being created today. They are consistently heavy even if they are experimenting with other subgenres or if they are adding different elements into their albums. All of their ideas never felt out of place, but felt like great additions to thrash since hardly anyone is able to do so. Who really gives a fuck about what thrash band is or isn’t in the “Big Four of Thrash Bands” because Overkill is above all that labeling; even going far as being the combination of all of them into one! New Jersey’s Overkill almost certainly find themselves leading many fans’ second bracket for the genre, having led the charge for neck-wrecking speed metal for over thirty years. How can you not consider Overkill an all time great after all they’ve accomplished? I grantee to you that your favorite musicians is doomed to make a really bad album (if they’re still making music today), but Overkill is one of those rare bands that does absolutely no wrong!\n\nRelated Articles"
