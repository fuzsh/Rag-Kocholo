        "text": "“Every teenager needs a mosh pit in their life,” long-haired, 17-year-old James Johns tells me on a recent afternoon.\n\nThe drummer for local heavy metal band Wretched Angel, Johns is hoping to get momentum going for more all-ages rock shows in Huntsville.\n\nThe city is currently without a dedicated all-ages venue, for music fans under 21. But Huntsville has a cool history of all-ages gigs, going back to ‘80s punk and metal gigs held at the National Guard Armory and old Carriage Inn, featuring local heroes like heshers Skeletal Earth and even underground heroes Fugazi. In recent years, there was a short-lived all-ages venue called TrashBone that hosted DIY-type bands.\n\nWith the help of his dad, Johns is putting on an all-ages show 7 p.m. Saturday at arts center Lowe Mill, address 2211 Seminole Drive. Wretched Angels, which also features singer/guitarist Anthony Andaluz, bassist Logan Bardin and guitarist Stacy Spearman, are the headliners. Also on the bill: Birmingham thrash band Iron Law, Huntsville metal duo Tellurian Complex and local horror-punks The Casket Kids. Cover is five bucks.\n\nThe show’s taking place in Lowe Mill’s First-Floor Connector Room, a bare-bones space where influential Los Angeles punk band X performed in 2018. Johns hopes Wretched Angel’s Saturday show will be the start of monthly or at least quarterly all-ages shows.\n\n“It’s kind of scary because we have no idea who’s gonna show up. There may be five, there may be 500,” Johns says. Judging from social media interest, he’s guessing attendance will be in the 100 to 200 range.\n\nAll the musicians in Wretched Angel are 19 or under. It’s important, musically and socially, for young bands to be able to play for audiences their own age.\n\nJohns, a home-schooled high-school junior says, “Grissom High School and Lee High School have a lot of punk and alternative kids who really need something like this and don’t really know where to find it.” He says local teenagers he knows have turned to drugs or violence because they’re bored. “There’s nothing to do, school is hard and people get bullied,” Johns says, “Everybody has to have a place where they can have a voice and just have fun, you know, without doing anything dumb.”\n\nWith a lack of all-ages venue in Huntsville, Wretched Angel has traveled for gigs in Birmingham, which has a more robust scene. Notably, DIY venue The Firehouse and also promoter Brian Burx’s recurring Punk Rock Art Show.\n\nIn Huntsville, Johns is grateful for the opportunities a couple local bars have given his band to play. But in those situations, the band’s mostly just playing for older biker-dudes. Doing all-ages shows that bring teenagers to bars isn’t a great fit for reasons you probably don’t need spelled out. On the flip side, hosting cash-strapped minors, and the inherent risk involved, doesn’t make fiscal sense for most bar or restaurant owners, who make their money off beverage and/or food sales.\n\nJohns grew up in a house filled with music. His dad, Keating Johns, is an engineer by trade who’s played in local bands like Instant Karma and Milltowne. When Keating’s wife was pregnant with James, he played music from Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart to his unborn son in the womb.\n\nJames began taking drum lessons at the ripe age of 5. After learning beats ranging from jazz-fusion to Latin-percussion, around 13 he fell under the spell of metal. His favorite drummers include Slayer’s Dave Lombardo. James’ nickname is “Animal,” a nod to a certain drumming Muppet as well as late Motorhead drummer Phil Taylor.\n\nBack in the ‘80s, Keating grew up in Huntsville going to Armory all-ages shows. “Seeing people my own age play live inspired me to want to pick up the guitar,” Keating says. That’s part of his motivation to help get all-ages shows happening more frequently again in Huntsville. “I want other kids to have that same experience,” Keating says.\n\nRenting the Lowe Mill space for Saturday’s Huntsville show isn’t cheap. It’s around $675. James and Keating aren’t aiming for a rainmaker, just to break even. Hence keeping the cover low.\n\nIn addition to the requisite Facebook event page, the Wretched Angel dudes have promoted the gig the old-fashioned way. They’ve put up flyers at music stores, gas stations, smoke shops, wherever. If this first show does OK, and they can put on others, Johns says they might also do all-ages shows for other music genres, including rock, punk and rap.\n\nJames and Keating have been working with Lowe Mill events coordinator Jana Savanapridi. For Lowe Mill, hosting an all-ages show is a way to introduce a younger audience to the facility.\n\nThe cause also hits home with Savanapridi on a personal level. “In my experience,” she says, “the all-ages shows I’ve been to have been some of the best. The audiences are all in because they’re not there for anything else other than the band. Like, sometimes you go to a bar and bands happen to be playing and you might like them as a side-effect.”\n\nMuch has been made in mainstream media about today’s teens loving rap and ignoring rock. But Johns is turned off by modern hip-hop because “all the lyrics became about talking really dirty things about women, drugs and just bragging about how cool your life is.” Instead he was drawn to the angst and rebellion in metal. “Metal comes from a place of being misunderstood,” Johns says. “And giving yourself a voice. But then, I love ‘80s hip-hop like N.W.A and Public Enemy because that stuff comes from the same place that metal does.”\n\nThis year, Metallica’s 1986 classic “Master of Puppets” zoomed to the center of pop-culture, after Netflix horror series “Stranger Things” featured the song in a scene in which metalhead character Eddie Munson plays the song on guitar to summon demons. Well, Johns is a real-life Eddie Munson. He’s been wearing bullet-belts and battle-jackets daily, long before the “Master of Puppets” synch.\n\nHis band has an umlaut-worthy örigin story. Johns met Andaluz two years ago after Andaluz answered a pentagram-adorned flyer Johns posted looking for other teen metal musicians. “Anthony was actually going to take down his flyer he already put up,” Johns says. “He was like, ‘I’m never gonna find a drummer.’ And the day he went to do that, he saw my flyer and was like ‘I found the guy.’” Later on, Johns and Andaluz connected with Bardin at a local arts event.\n\nInitially, they played straight-up thrash and used the not-great band name of Covid. “Yeah, everybody thought that was kind of dumb,” Johns admits of the appellation. After Spearman came into the fold later, bringing a vintage death-metal influence, the band’s sound changed so they changed the name too. A banner with the spooky Wretched Angel logo now hangs behind the band onstage when they perform, blazing away on Marshall stacks, Flying V guitars and double-kickdrum Tama kit.\n\nWretched Angel’s setlist includes original songs like “Cesspool,” which opens with Iron Maiden-style guitar harmonies and cover songs like Slayer’s tornadic “Angel of Death.” Judging from a live video clip, the band summons the fast fury thrash-fans expect.\n\nAsked about his band’s ambitions, James Johns says cutting a demo/EP is in the cards. “In the next couple of years, we’re going to be touring more. None of us want to be rock stars. We just want to have enough money to live and support ourselves with music.”\n\nThe past couple years, Huntsville has experienced seismic improvements in music here. It’s mostly been top-down, with the addition of headliner venues Orion Amphitheater and Mars Music Hall, and the city’s creation of a full-time music-officer.\n\nBut there have also been exciting local-level initiatives. Specifically, new live-music concepts Sluice Fest, Porch Fest and Women In Music Weekend. Solidifying an all-ages scene would add another crucial strata.\n\n“The main thing about Huntsville that’s being promoted right now,” James Johns says, “in terms of local music is singer/songwriter, indie, alternative bands. But there’s been punk and metal since like 1980 in Huntsville, and just no one really knows about it.” Donnie Sharp, the singer from trailblazing local hardcore punk band The Knockabouts and currently horror-rockers The Go-Go Killers, has been a mentor to Johns and helped Wretched Angel get gigs.\n\nHuntsville music’s got legit buzz now, including a recent Rolling Stone feature. But the city’s still never produced a breakthrough artist or band. When it does, it likely won’t be a seasoned act from here that finally “makes it” but some kid. Maybe the kind of kid who plays all-ages shows.\n\nMORE ON MUSIC\n\n12 yesteryear Huntsville venues popular musicians played\n\nWes Scantlin talks Puddle of Mudd hits, being misunderstood\n\nDaru Jones on playing drums for Jack White, Meg White’s drum skills\n\nCourtney Barnett is indie-rock’s coolest singer-guitarist-songwriter triple-threat\n\nAnn Wilson talks Heart, Muscle Shoals album, Led Zeppelin\n\n‘80s guitar hero Tracii Guns talks L.A.
