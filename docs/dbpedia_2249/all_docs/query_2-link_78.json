Arch Enemy has so far released nine studio albums, with their sixth album “Doomsday Machine” reaching number 87 on the Billboard 200. Critics have described the band’s sound as a blend of progressive and death metal, which allows them to still provide metalheads with the influence of their hardcore music today.\n\n#9: Nightwish\n\nAs with Arch Enemy, this symphonic metal band was also formed in the ‘90s when metal music was changing shape. Although Nightwish has been successful in their home country of Finland since their debut album “Angels Fall First”, they would only achieve international fame with the release of later records like “Oceanborn,” “Wishmaster” and “Century Child”. With big hits like “Wish I Had an Angel” and “Amaranth” though, it’s no wonder they are one of the most successful Finnish bands in the world.\n\n#8: Volbeat\n\nNot many bands can get away with mixing hard rock with Johnny Cash and Elvis Presley, but this Danish band does just that. Dating back to 2001, all five of their albums have received gold status in their native Denmark. While their previous albums have garnered success, their fourth record “Beyond Hell/Above Heaven” was notably met with critical acclaim in Europe and was also their first album to receive Billboard 200 chart success.

Most of their albums achieved chart success, but it was their sixth album “Dark Adrenaline” that achieved top 20 status when it hit number 15 on the Billboard 200 in 2012. Meanwhile, songs like their Depeche Mode cover “Enjoy the Silence”, “Trip the Darkness” and “Spellbound” are hits not to be missed.

The band has released five albums as of 2015, all of which have earned praise from critics and fans alike. 2008's “The Way of All Flesh” was cited as one of the year's best by Metal Hammer while 2012's “L'Enfant Sauvage” has been their highest charting album in North America to date, hitting 34 on the Billboard 200.\n\n#5: Children of Bodom\n\nAlso known for their fusion of musical styles, which some critics and fans label as melodic death metal, power metal and thrash metal, Children of Bodom are also one of the most popular and successful bands in their home country of Finland. In fact, they’ve sold over 250,000 records there alone. Their third album “Follow the Reaper”, became their first album to receive gold status at home, with their 6 other records achieving the same status since then while also achieving chart success on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, 2015 saw the release of their album “I Worship Chaos”, proving that they’re still going strong.\n\n#4: Five Finger Death Punch\n\nThis American heavy metal band has sold more than 2.5 million albums in the United States alone since their formation in 2005.

Although a few band members have come and gone, Fiver Finger Death Punch are still going strong today and are showing no signs of slipping.\n\n#3: Mastodon\n\nThis American sludge metal band are known for their sludge-stoner-metal outfits while also being considered one of the greatest metal bands of their generation. With six albums under their belts since their 2002 début, Mastodon turned heads with their Moby-Dick based concept album “Leviathan,” while 2006 saw the band get a nod of approval from stoner rock champion Josh Homme when he guested on the band's “Colony of Birchmen”. The public, meanwhile, threw support at the band as well, pushing later records “The Hunter” and “Once More 'Round the Sun” into the top 10 of the Billboard 200 charts.\n\n#2: Bullet for My Valentine\n\nOriginally named Jeff Killed John before they changing their name the one we know today as a result of financial troubles and a different musical direction, this metalcore and hard rock band have sold over 5 million albums worldwide. Not only that, but they’ve earned Billboard 200 chart success with each and every album they’ve released since 2005 so far . With influences such as Guns N’ Roses, AC/DC and many others inspiring the Welsh band’s musical personality, Bullet for My Valentine continue to rock hard – and with the top 10 chart status of their 2015 album “Venom,” it looks like they gonna keep things that way.\n\nBefore we rock on with our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n- In Flames\n\n- Meshuggah\n\n- Trivium\n\n- Underoath\n\n- Amon Amarth\n\n#1: Killswitch Engage\n\nConsidered one of the founders of metalcore and one of more prominent bands of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement, Killswitch Engage currently has six albums to their credit and over 4 million records sold in their native U.S. alone. Known as much for their combination of extreme metal and hardcore as they are for Grammy-nominated hits like “In Due Time,” Killswitch Engage have gained praise from the get-go. Their 2000 debut album is considered to be one of the most successful albums in the metalcore genre, while their 2009 self-titled release and 2013's “Disarm the Descent” both topped out at #7 on the Billboard 200.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
