        "text": "Just the other day, I was wondering what happened to the San Fransisco thrash metal band Heathen. So after spinning a copy of Breaking The Silence, I decided to find out. It seemed that Heathen has being groomed for success. They were in the right place at the right time (in the Golden Era of thrash metal), they got on all the suitable tours, had big-name rock producers (Ronny Montrose) producing them, and even seemed to be getting a push from the record company?\n\nBreaking The Silence Full Album\n\nSo what happened? Why did thrash metal success elude Heathen?\n\nI was aware that the only two albums were Breaking the Silence (1987) and Victims of Deception (1991). Victims came out right as the thrash metal scene was wiped out by grunge, but Breaking the Silence had a small amount of airplay and even a video for the Sweet cover “Set Me Free” in rotation on Headbangers Ball.\n\nDuring the “Breaking” heyday of the band, they were plagued with lineup changes, which led to the long period between their first two records. Guitarist (and absolute shedder) Lee Atlus was the only stable member during that time.\n\nVictim Of Deception Full Album\n\nIn 2005 Lee Atlus replaced Rick Hunolt on guitar in Exodus, which he still plays with to this day.\n\nReunions 2009 / 2020\n\nIn 2009 the band reunited and released The Evolution Of Chaos. Heathen toured for a few months before again being hit with more lineup changes, which lead to further inactivity.\n\nIn 2020, Heathen reformed again and released Empire Of The Blind, though the band is skeptical about how much they will be able to tour to support the album due to the glut of bands wanting to get on the road after COVID.\n\nI hope that brings your up to date!"
