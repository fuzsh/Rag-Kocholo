        "text": "Death Angel is an American thrash metal band that was formed in 1982 in the San Francisco Bay Area. The band's members include Mark Osegueda on vocals, Rob Cavestany and Ted Aguilar on guitars, Damien Sisson on bass, and Will Carroll on drums. Death Angel is known for their aggressive and fast-paced music, which has gained them a loyal following of fans over the years.\n\nThe band's early years were marked by a series of demo recordings that showcased their raw energy and intense songwriting. They soon caught the attention of Metallica, who were also based in the Bay Area, and were signed to their label, Megaforce Records. In 1987, Death Angel released their debut album, \"The Ultra-Violence,\" which received critical acclaim and established them as one of the leading bands in the thrash metal scene.\n\nOver the years, Death Angel has continued to release a string of successful albums, including \"Frolic Through the Park\" (1988), \"Act III\" (1990), and \"The Art of Dying\" (2004). The band's music has evolved over time, incorporating elements of funk, jazz, and other genres while still maintaining their trademark intensity and aggression.\n\nOne of the defining features of Death Angel's music is their lyrics, which often deal with themes of death, violence, and social issues. The band's songwriting is often politically charged, with songs that tackle topics such as police brutality, war, and the environment.\n\nDespite their success, Death Angel has also experienced its share of setbacks. In 1990, drummer Andy Galeon was involved in a serious car accident that forced the band to go on hiatus for several years. They eventually reunited in 2001 and have continued to tour and release new music ever since.\n\nThroughout their career, Death Angel has remained committed to their fans and to the thrash metal scene. They have performed at countless festivals and shows around the world and have consistently received positive reviews for their live performances. Their fans appreciate their high-energy shows and the band's willingness to connect with them on a personal level."
