        "meta_description": "W.A.S.P.: Few Bands in the history of Rock N’ Roll have ever incited the love, the hate, the raw emotional effect this Band has had on the world. From the very beginning, in the small venues of Los Angeles California, and later to the numerous countries worldwide that banned these Winged Assassins from performing live, the Band’s unique style of Shock and Rock caused Religious organizations, Local City Councils, Parliaments, and the Washington D.C. Senate to hold hearings in an effort to bar this group from selling records and trashing stages everywhere they played. The band’s founding member, frontman Blackie Lawless, has led the group as its lead vocalist and primary songwriter since its beginning. His unique brand of visual, social and political comment took the group to worldwide heights and sold millions of records alongside a legacy of sold out shows across the globe for 4 decades. Joined by bassist Mike Duda and guitarist Doug Blair, whose tenures in the band span 26 and 18 years respectively, along with drummer extraordinaire Aquiles Priester, will take the Band and the Fans back to where it all started. Complete with the stage show extravaganza that many fans never saw live. ARMORED SAINT:  One of the select few true metal bands to emerge from the glitzy Sunset Strip scene, Armored Saint specializes in a style of no-frills metal that has more in common with New Wave of British Heavy Metal acts like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Saxon. The band issued a trio of influential albums in the 1980s (March of the Saint, Delirious Nomad, and Raising Fear) before ceasing operations in the early ’90s after the passing of original guitarist David Prichard. Re-forming in 1999, the group has continued to stand at the nexus of thrash and hard rock, releasing their hard-hitting eighth full-length effort, Punching the Sky, in 2020. UNTO OTHERS: Unto Others is a metal band from Portland, Oregon that was originally formed in 2017 under the name Idle Hands by former members of Spellcaster. The band’s sound is a mix of heavy metal, goth rock, and new wave, with influences from The Sisters of Mercy, Killing Joke, and The Mission. Gabriel Franco, the band’s vocalist and guitarist, cites Spanish rock band Héroes del Silencio as his biggest influence. Franco’s gothic-style vocals are said to complement the band’s emotional and melodic guitar work.",
