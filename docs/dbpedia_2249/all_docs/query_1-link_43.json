        "text": "While the live metal scene in San Antonio has stretched off to include more genres and subgenres of all different types of music (which is awesome), it’s undeniable that we still dig metal here. What with us showing up in the tens of thousands to bands like Metallica and even in the hundreds for the black metal giants Mayhem, it’s clear – we still dig the heavy shit.\n\nIn the every-once-in-a-while-metal-news we bring to you on occasion, we thought y’all might want to know about this DVD documentary series coming out covering the rise of thrash metal in Los Angeles aptly named The Rise of L.A. Thrash Metal.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, MetalRock Films will release part one of the new two-part series directed by Bob Nalbandian with narration by David Ellefson of thrash legends Megadeth. The documentary focuses on the Los Angeles thrash metal uprising of the early/mid '80s and acts as a follow-up to the first two Inside Metal titles, The Pioneers of LA Hard Rock & Metal and LA Metal Scene Explodes. It also includes exclusive, in-depth content and interviews with heavy metal icons and those who helped build the scene.\n\nThroughout history, the San Francisco Bay Area has long been deemed as the epicenter for thrash metal, but this DVD explores the idea that Los Angeles is the rightful birthplace of three of the \"Big 4\" thrash bands and is the breeding grounds for unconventional thrash/punk-metal bands. But we all know without San Antonio’s support, none of that shit probably would’ve have been as big as it is today amiright?\n\nCheck out a few clips from the documentary below.\n\nGene Holgan (Dark Angel, Death, Strapping Young Lad, Devin Townsend, Fear Factory, Opeth, Unearth, Dethklok and Testament) talking about the first time he met James Hetfield:\n\nLars Ulrich discussing punk music and Metallica's early influences:\n\nAnd the actual trailer:\n\nFor more information visit metalrockfilms.com."
