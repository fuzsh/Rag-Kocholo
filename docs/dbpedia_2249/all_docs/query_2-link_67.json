        "text": "Why?\n\nI really love finding out how all the different parts of the Rock, Punk and Metal spectrum mix together. I love hearing something like a Pantera song and knowing which part comes from where, and how it would sound totally different without such and such an album.\n\nI also really enjoy reading lists and countdowns of things like The 100 Best Metal Albums Of All Time, 100 Rock Albums You Must Own, The Most Influential Rock Albums In History, 200 Metal Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, The Greatest Heavy Metal Bands Ever, and so on; as well as any Documentary Film or TV Show on or related to the genre, such as Heavy Metal Louder Than Life, The Decline Of Western Civilization, American Hardcore, Such Hawks Such Hounds, Until The Light Takes Us, Global Metal, Metal Evolution, Heavy:The Story Of Metal and so on.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe following is a list of 1000 (Originally 50, 100, 250 and 500 but it kind of snowballed) studio albums from various genres and sub-genres that constantly appear in such lists, countdowns and top-one-hundreds, that a metal fan would arguably need to have heard or at least know about in order to claim to have a full and comprehensive understanding of metal.\n\nWhy was that album included?\n\nThe majority are either genre-defining albums, genre-starting albums or hugely influential albums that inspired hundreds of other bands. They either developed the artistic or commercial legitimacy of the nebulous meta-world of Metal or are in-part responsible for either its credibility or popularity.\n\nI’ve tried to keep repetition to a minimum, however if an artist has multiple entries on this list there could be a number of reasons; They might display clear influence to disparate groups across each included release, or else all of the included albums by one singular artist may individually feature perpetually covered or copied tracks, or tracks that are often featured on genre compilation cds and radio/music-tv programming…\n\nOr the artists with multiple releases may either showcase exploration into significantly different musical territory across the separate releases that got included or else showcase historically significant line-up changes, technological advances or artistic trends (eg. the albums were important in creation, popularization or revival of things like concept albums, blast beats, synthesizers, lyrical trends or necro-production etc).\n\nOr of course, it could just be the case where the band were on an unstoppable run of brilliant albums, and all of the albums together are considered a must-have period of the band. Sometimes there’s just no arguing with an unstoppable run of classics.\n\nSome of the albums may have you scratching your head as to they they were included here. There are usually one of two reasons for this. Firstly; Metal didn’t just start one day perfectly formed and unarguably Metal. It came together in fits and starts, things hinted at being Metal for years before any band wrote an entire Metal album. Bands would have one metal song, or even just one metal riff, or even simply an attitude that would inspire future metal musicians of one subgenre or another.\n\nSecondly; Metal is a constantly changing and evolving form of music that both takes from other genres to become diverse and gets taken by other genres as well. Some albums by Metal bands sound nothing like traditional Metal and some albums by Punk, Rock, Blues, Pop, Hip-Hop, Electronic or Jazz bands can include a lot of influences from Metal. The more that you hear, the more you understand where the boundaries are and where the boundaries aren’t. The more you hear that isn’t close to a boundary, the more definitively you understand both what the center is like and how that center relates to things that are far out on the borderline of no longer being Metal. Basically, if you listen to every album on this list, you’ll know what you are talking about when it comes to Metal. You’ll know what an artist is doing and where it came from, you’ll understand more clearly how all the different pieces of the puzzle fit together.\n\nI Don’t Like This List…\n\nTo be honest, it is literally impossible for one person to ever understand everything about Metal fully, you’d have to hear every album, demo or riff made in a garage by every musician, ever, since the dawn of time. Not all the albums here even are metal, but hearing them will broaden your understanding of what metal in its entirety actually is.\n\n…and before that puts you on the defensive, for clarity I’d like to state this: I’m not saying that if you haven’t listened to all of these that you know nothing about Metal, only that you don’t know everything about Metal. The main gist of the list is that Metal comes in all shapes and sizes.\n\nThe composition of the list is roughly as follows:\n\nThe Different Types Of Metal – 73%\n\nThe Rock Music That Got Us To Metal – 17%\n\nThe Punk Music That Got Us To Metal – 8%\n\nThe Alternative Music That Changed Metal – 2%\n\nSure, there’s some Pop Punk and Rap in there to demonstrate how bands like A Day To Remember mix Pop Punk sounds with Metal sounds, or how Black Sabbath and others added Rap in the 90s/00s. Don’t let that “get your back up” but don’t forget there’s over 60 Black Metal related albums and around 90 Death Metal related albums.\n\nIf you still wonder why an album is included in this list then listen to it and find out why! You may not enjoy every album that you hear, but you will understand Metal more completely with each one that you do hear, which of course is the reason for the list in the first place. Its an important moment in every Metal fan’s journey when they finally accept that Metal isn’t just the bits of Metal they enjoy and that things aren’t “not Metal” just because you don’t like them or understand them.\n\nIf you disagree with a subgenre’s existence (eg. “Classic Rock” or “Hair Metal”), or an artist’s designated sub-genre in this list (Eg. Why is Mortis alongside Black Metal artists?), try not to get too bogged down in that head-space. While some subgenre categorizations are a matter of fact (ie. Nirvana are definitely not Black Metal and Dragonforce are definitely not Hardcore Punk) its important to remember that subgenres are initially awkwardly built around groups of bands who kind of sound a bit alike, live a bit close to eachother or have one non-musical commonality between them and sometimes its not until years later that bands notice a subgenre exists and specifically try to play within that subgenre. For this reason some people disagree over whether Alice In Chains or Pearl Jam are Grunge or not.\n\nSecondly subgenres are a matter of consensus. If enough informed and reasonable people agree upon something then it exists, even if you disagree just because you don’t enjoy it. Maybe it didn’t definitely exist when it first started getting mentioned, but over time enough bands started sounding that way and identifying as that subgenre and suddenly it does exist.\n\nThirdly, the lines between some subgenres are blurred and often bands are creative and diverse enough to fit into a subgenre on some songs, or parts of songs, but not others. For this reason some people disagree over whether Metal Church and Anvil are Thrash or not. At the end of the day, if more people associate a band with a particular subgenre or scene than don’t, and a lot of their music sounds like that subgenre, then arguing is going to be a waste of time.\n\nIf you have a suggestion for an album that this list is missing out on then feel free to send me a comment, I’m always interested in learning more.\n\nNow; With all that explanation out of the way, keep a positive attitude and an open mind, and please enjoy this fan-made and non-for-profit, labour-of-love list of 1,000 albums that will help you understand Metal, or at least serve to give newcomers a starting-point with some recommendations:\n\nMaterial Covered Includes: Early Rock, Psychedelic, Progressive Rock, Classic Rock, Heavy Metal, Glam, NWOBHM & Metal, Thrash Metal, Groove Metal , Death Metal, Technical-Death, Melodeath, Black Metal, Power Metal, Folk Metal, Symphonic Metal, Progressive Metal, Doom Metal, Sludge Metal, Metalcore, Deathcore, Djent\n\nPunk , Hardcore , Grunge , Pop-Punk , Emo, The Wave, Stoner, Industrial , Nu Metal\n\nThe List:\n\nElvis Presley – Elvis Presley, 1956, Rock And Roll, USA\n\nChuck Berry – Chuck Berry Is On Top, 1959, Rock N Roll, USA\n\nLittle Richard – Here’s Little Richard, 1957, Rock N Roll, USA\n\nHowlin’ Wolf – Moanin’ In The Moonlight, 1959, Blues, USA\n\nWillie Dixon – I AM The Blues, 1970, Blues, USA\n\nBo Diddley – Go Bo Diddley, 1959, Rock And Roll, USA\n\nLink Wray – Link Wray & The Wraymen, 1962, Rock And Roll, USA\n\nDick Dale – Surfer’s Choice, 1962, Surf, USA\n\nBob Dylan – Highway 61 Revisited, 1965, Mixed (With Folk & Rock) USA\n\nThe Yardbirds – Having A Rave Up With The Yardbirds, 1965, Rock, USA\n\nThe Sonics – Here Are The Sonics, 1965, Garage Rock, USA\n\nThe Troggs – From Nowhere – The Troggs, 1966, Classic Rock, UK\n\nSteppenwolf – Steppenwolf, 1968, Classic Rock, Canada\n\nThe Kinks – Kinks, 1964, Classic Rock, UK\n\nBuffalo Springfield – Buffalo Springfield Again, 1967, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Folk), USA\n\nGun – Race With The Devil, 1968, Classic Rock, UK\n\nSpooky Tooth – Spooky Two, 1969, Classic Rock, UK\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Sticky Fingers, 1971, Classic Rock, UK\n\nThe Rolling Stones – Exile On Main St., 1972, Classic Rock, UK\n\nDavid Bowie – The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars, 1972, Glam-Rock, UK\n\n***\n\nThis music was important in the development of Metal, some of the most influential work on the first generation of Metal musicians came from this period. Many of these albums influenced or made careers for the journalists, producers, A&R men, equipment manufacturers and fans that directly and indirectly allowed Metal to develop in the way that it did . They helped to cement and legitimize the rock genre which would later spin off into the Psychedelic, Progressive Rock, Hard Rock and eventually Heavy Metal Rock-subgenres.\n\nIn addition to the fans at the time, such as Motörhead’s Lemmy or Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, many musicians from later periods as diverse as AC/DC, Guns N Roses, Yes, Heart, Mountain, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Journey, Spineshank, Entombed, Clutch and Monster Magnet would take influence or cover songs from this pre-metal world. Due to its reputation and the media perpetuation of its quality and importance, fans from every generation will look back to this music and find inspiration.\n\nThis era of music has caused a definitive and long-lasting ripple effect on every subsequent generation of musicians. Bands both trying to sound like this, and trying not to sound like this have had direct and indirect impacts on the moulding and changing of various subgenres. Where would Grunge, Glam or Prog be without David Bowie?\n\nVocal styles, production techniques, equipment, and lyrical approaches from this era are constantly being used, emulated, revived (well, slightly differently or ironically), forgotten about or deliberately ignored and all this has a constant wave effect on the ongoing history of Rock music and its offspring Punk and Metal.\n\n***\n\nThe Beatles – Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, 1967, Psychedelic, UK\n\nThe Beatles – The Beatles, 1968, Psychedelic, UK\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators – The Psychedelic Sounds Of The 13th Floor Elevators, 1966, Psychedelic, USA\n\nBig Brother And The Holding Company – Cheap Thrills, 1968, Psychedelic, USA\n\nThe Crazy World Of Arthur Brown – This Is The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown, 1968, Psychedelic, UK\n\nCoven – Witchcraft Destroys Minds And Reaps Souls, 1969, Mixed (With Psychedelic & Classic Rock) UK\n\nSir Lord Baltimore – Kingdom Come, 1970, Mixed (With Psychedelic & Classic Rock) UK\n\nCaptain Beyond – Captain Beyond, 1972, Mixed (With Psychedelic & Classic Rock) UK\n\nBlue Cheer – Vincebus Erputum, 1968, Mixed (With Psychedelic) USA\n\nIron Butterfly – In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, 1968, Psychedelic, UK\n\nCream – Disraeli Gears, 1967, Psychedelic, UK\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience – Are You Experienced, 1967, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Psychedelic) UK\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience – Electric Ladyland, 1968, Mixed (With Classic Rock, Prog & Psychedelic) UK\n\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico – The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1967, Mixed (With Psychedelic) UK\n\nThe Doors – L.A.

Psychedelic lyrical themes including drug taking, insanity and dark fantasy have cropped up ever since their first popularization in the sixties and there is scarcely one subgenre which doesn’t have at least one band that takes the music in a Psychedelic direction. The popularity of this genre gave Progressive Rock a start, directly and indirectly, as fans of Psychedelic bands who started their own bands ended up playing Progressive Rock and also as Psychedelic bands taking things to the next level would themselves become Progressive Rock.\n\nIt also resulted in some of the first instances of screaming vocals, heavily distorted guitars and aggressively attacked drumkits (although the Jazz world had a hell of a lot of influence there too), which would go on to have a profound effect on the development of Metal and inspire musicians who liked this new sound to refine it and make whole songs or albums from these Metal-esque moments by Psychedelic bands.\n\nThe influence of Psychedelic music can also be found in a lot of Stoner Rock and Metal music, with a lot of effects loops, album covers and reverb choices being directly influenced by old 60s bands. Early Monster Magnet owes a huge debt to the Psychedelic Scene for example, as indeed does Kylesa. Compare them to the more straight forward Fu Manchu and Black Tusk from each of their respective scenes and see what a difference a Psychedelic influence makes even when you play everything else similarly. Even certain Black Metal bands take influence from psychadelic music of this era.\n\n***\n\nKing Crimson – In The Court Of The Crimson King, 1969, Prog, UK\n\nKing Crimson – Larks’ Tongues In Aspic, 1973, Prog, UK\n\nKing Crimson – Red, 1974, Prog, UK\n\nKing Crimson – Three Of A Perfect Pair, 1984, Prog, UK\n\nKing Crimson – The Power To Believe, 2003, Mixed (With Prog & Metal) UK\n\nELP – Emerson, Lake & Palmer, 1970, Prog, UK\n\nELP – Brain Salad Surgery, 1973, Prog, UK\n\nGenesis – Foxtrot, 1972, Prog, UK\n\nGenesis – Selling England By The Pound, 1973, Prog, UK\n\nGenesis – The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, 1974, Prog, UK\n\nJethro Tull – Aqualung, 1971, Prog, UK\n\nJethro Tull – Thick As A Brick, 1972, Prog, UK\n\nJethro Tull – Broadsword & The Beast, 1982, Prog, UK\n\nPink Floyd – The Dark Side Of The Moon, 1973, Prog, UK\n\nPink Floyd – Wish You Were Here, 1974, Prog, UK\n\nPink Floyd – Animals, 1977, Prog, UK\n\nPink Floyd – The Wall, 1979, Prog, UK\n\nGentle Giant – Octopus, 1971, Prog, UK, Reviewed Here\n\nVan Der Graaf Generator – Pawn Hearts, 1971, Prog, UK\n\nVan Der Graaf Generator – Godbluff, 1975, Prog, UK\n\nFlower Travelin Band – Satori, 1971, Prog, Japan\n\nRush – 2112, 1976, Prog, Canada\n\nRush – Hemispheres, 1978, Prog, Canada\n\nRush – Moving Pictures, 1981, Prog, Canada\n\nYes – The Yes Album, 1971, Prog, UK\n\nYes – Fragile, 1971, Prog, UK\n\nYes – Close To The Edge, 1972, Prog, UK\n\nYes – Relayer, 1974, Prog, UK\n\nCamel – The Snow Goose, 1975, Prog, UK\n\nKansas – Leftoverture, 1976, Prog, USA\n\nHawkwind – Hall Of The Mountain Grill, 1974, Prog, UK\n\nAphrodite’s Child – 666, 1972, Prog, Greece\n\nMarillion – Script For A Jester’s Tear, 1983, Prog, UK\n\nMarillion – Misplaced Childhood, 1985, Prog, UK\n\nIQ – The Wake, 1985, Prog, UK\n\nNick Drake – Bryter Layter, 1970, Mixed (With Prog & Folk) UK\n\nBudgie – Budgie, 1971, Mixed (With Prog & Heavy Metal) UK\n\nBudgie – Never Turn You Back On A Friend, 1973, Mixed (With Prog & Heavy Metal) UK\n\nBudgie – Bandolier, 1975, Mixed (With Prog & Heavy Metal) UK\n\nBudgie – Never Turn You Back On A Friend, 1973, Mixed (With Prog & Heavy Metal) UK\n\nUriah Heap – Look At Yourself, 1971, Mixed (Prog & Classic Rock) UK\n\nUriah Heap – Demons And Wizards, 1972, Mixed (Prog & Classic Rock) UK\n\nAtomic Rooster – Death Walks Behind You, 1971, Mixed (Prog & Classic Rock) UK\n\nWishbone Ash – Argus, 1972, Mixed (Prog & Hard Rock) UK\n\nQueen – Queen II, 1973, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Prog) UK\n\nQueen – Queen II, 1974, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Prog) UK\n\nQueen – Sheer Heart Attack, 1974, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Prog) UK\n\nQueen – A Night At The Opera, 1975, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Prog) UK\n\nMeat Loaf – Bat Out Of Hell, 1977, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Prog) USA\n\n***\n\nAs well as having an obvious impact on the later movements like first-wave Progressive Metal; Progressive Rock, which was as much an attitude as an actual genre, had an impact on thousands of bands from all subsequent eras and scenes who wanted to take things in complex, sophisticated or artistic directions. It had an effect on the keyboard players who would play in certain Hair Metal and Power Metal bands, it had an effect on Black Metal musicians like Ishan who wanted to create grand orchestral work and it had an effect on many guitarists who would take inspiration from the unusual and difficult ways that Prog bands chose to play them.\n\nEven the development and popularization of instruments like the Chapman Stick had a direct impact and influence on bands like Scale The Summit.\n\nFurthermore; as with what happened with Psychedelic music, Prog bands experimented with all sorts of sounds, and tracks like King Crimson’s ‘Larks Tongues In Aspic Part 2′ and Genesis’ ‘Dancing With The Moonlit Knight,’ as well as ELP’s ‘Knife Edge,’ Van Der Graaf Generator’s ‘Arrow’ and Jethro Tull’s ‘Aqualung’ contained some of the heaviest music ever written at the time. Flower Travelin Band were particularly metallic. The first Genesis album had drumming on it that actually resembles the Blast Beat and their fourth album contains some of the earliest recorded examples of guitar tapping.\n\nThe development of the rock opera and concept album had an influence on Progressive Metal bands as well as other bands who later would write concept albums without identifying as being Progressive bands, including Fear Factory and Marilyn Manson.\n\nTwo of Metal’s most important and influential bands ever; Iron Maiden and Judas Priest became inspired to play because of Prog bands, and some of their early work shares sonic similarities with the likes of Rush (Maiden’s ‘Prodigal Son,’ Saxon’s ‘Rainbow Theme’) and Pink Floyd (Priest’s ‘Run Of The Mill’). The guitar influence of Wishbone Ash similarly cannot be overstated.\n\nNumerous musicians, including Ozzy Osbourne, Forbidden and Between The Buried And Me have covered King Crimson. Iron Maiden as well as the Alternative/Stoner band Clutch and the Hair Metal band W.A.S.P have covered Jethro Tull, Mushroomhead have covered Pink Floyd and Extreme Metal band Opeth took a large influence from Camel to the point where their track ‘Benighted’ bares an almost cover-like resemblance to Camel’s ‘Never Let Go.’\n\nUriah Heap have been covered by Gamma Ray and W.A.S.P.\n\nThe popularity and perceived extremes of Prog also paved the way for the reactionary simple and honest music of Punk. Without Prog there would be no reason for much Punk music to have been made and also a less valid chance of it gaining the same level of popularity that it did.\n\nFurthermore, the non-muscial influence of Progressive Rock on Metal is again noteworthy. Progressive Rock musicians such as Gentle Giant’s Derick Shulman went on to form or work for important Record Labels in the history and development of Metal.\n\n***\n\nLed Zeppelin – Led Zeppelin, 1969, Classic Rock, UK\n\nLed Zeppelin – Led Zeppelin II, 1969, Classic Rock, UK\n\nLed Zeppelin – Led Zepp IV, 1971, Classic Rock, UK\n\nDeep Purple – In Rock, 1970, Classic Rock, UK, Reviewed Here\n\nDeep Purple – Machine Head, 1971, Classic Rock, UK, Reviewed Here\n\nDeep Purple – Burn, 1974, Classic Rock, UK, Reviewed Here\n\nDeep Purple – Purpendicular, 1996, Classic Rock, UK, Reviewed Here\n\nFree – Fire & Water, 1970, Classic Rock, UK\n\nThe Who – My Generation, 1965, Classic Rock, UK\n\nThe Who – Tommy, 1969, Mixed (With Classic Rock) UK\n\nThe Who – Who’s Next, 1971, Mixed (With Classic Rock) UK\n\nKiss – Kiss, 1974, Classic Rock, USA\n\nKiss – Destroyer, 1976, Classic Rock, USA\n\nKiss – Creatures Of The Night, 1982, Heavy Metal, USA\n\nKiss – Revenge, 1992, Classic Rock, USA\n\nKiss – Sonic Boom, 2009, Classic Rock, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nHeart – Dreamboat Annie, 1976, Classic Rock, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nHeart – Little Queen, 1977, Classic Rock, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nGrand Funk Railroad – Closer To Home, 1970, Classic Rock, USA\n\nGrand Funk Railroad – E Pluribus Funk, 1971, Classic Rock, USA\n\nGrand Funk Railroad – We’re An American Band, 1973, Classic Rock, USA\n\nT.

Anthrax, Megadeth, Death Angel and many others from the world of Thrash covered Kiss, as well as bands as diverse as Nirvana (even if sarcastically), Robot Lords Of Tokyo, Skid Row etc\n\nDeep Purple’s In Rock was spectacularly heavy for its time and their track ‘Smoke On The Water’ from Machine Head is one of the most famous guitar riffs of all time, it has been performed live by Rainbow, Gillan and even Black Sabbath. The song has been covered by Power Metal band Metallium, the Thrash band Sepultura and even by Iron Maiden.\n\nAlice Cooper and Thin Lizzy influenced and were covered by bands as diverse as Anthrax, Megadeth, Guns N Roses, Bon Jovie, Poison, Krokus, Sevendust, Everclear, Mastodon, Grave Digger and Six Feet Under.\n\nThin Lizzy’s guitar sound and often vocal patterns too were hugely influential on NWOBHM bands, and its hard to listening to deep cuts from bands like early Saxon, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Diamond Head, Samson etc. and not hear Thin Lizzy’s ghost. Thin Lizzy’s music has been covered by the likes of Thrash bands Anthrax, Megadeth, Sodom, The Accüsed… Power Metal bands Helloween, Gamma Ray, Primal Fear, Running Wild… Death Metal bands Vader, Six Feet Under… Alternative bands Smashing Pumpkins, Everclear, Rollins Band, Ash… Emo band Funeral For A Friend… Rock bands Bon Jovi, Blue Murder, Gun, Def Leppard, The Replacments, Pretty Maids… Hardcore band Hellnation… Folk Metal band Skyclad….

Firstly, the success of Lynyrd Skynyrd and their influence on guitarists is equal to that of bands like Queen, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. Secondly, the genre’s impact can be felt in the world of Sludge Metal, where bands like Acid Bath, Baroness, Black Tusk and others owe a large part of their sound to their Southern roots.\n\nPantera and the bands that Pantera inspired owe a large part of their sound to the Southern Rock movement, and bands like Drive By Truckers, Blackstone Cherry and Halfway To Gone mix contemporary music with Southern Rock to create their own sounds. Anyone who have their music described as southern-fried in magazines (even the Nu Metal band Soil) often owes part of their sound to the southern scene.\n\nIts impact can also be felt in unexpected sources, such as Coheed And Cambria (who have covered ZZ Top and made known their love of Gov’t Mule) and Metallica (who have covered Lynyrd Skynyrd) as well as Corrosion Of Conformity’s and Ozzy Osbourne’s guitarists Pepper Keenan and Zack Wylde, who took strong musical influence from it.\n\nAlambama Thunderpussy, Weedeater, Black Label Society, Coheed And Cambria, Metallica, Armoured Saint, Tesla, Shinedown, Deftones, The Hellacopters and more have covered Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nFirewind & Warrant have covered Blackfoot.

As with Classic Rock, a great deal of what Metal is was defined by this period and this is responsible for so much of the vocal styles, lyrical themes, guitar and drum techniques and the favoured production styles and tonal choices of almost every subsequent generation of Metal musicians.\n\nThis is the absolute foundation of Metal. Make this music faster and it becomes Speed Metal, make it both faster and heavier and it becomes Thrash Metal, add a lot of harmonies and melody and it can become Power Metal or Glam Metal depending on how you handle it. Add extra instruments to it and it can become Folk Metal or Symphonic Metal, and moving away from its sound or structure into other musical territories can result in Prog Metal or Nu Metal depending on how its handled. Rapping or Yodeling? Dj Scratches or Fiddles?\n\nStoner bands have covered Blue Öyster Cult, Metalcore bands have covered Dio, bands from Anthrax to Fozzy to Dream Theater have taken inspiration from Journey and Testament have covered Scorpions.\n\nAC/DC have been covered by Exodus, Onslaught, Annihilator, Anthrax, Trust, Mutiny Within, Iced Earth, Grave Digger, Six Feet Under, Wolf, Omen, Bullet For My Valentine, Living Colour, Kid Rock, Refused, Hinder, Ugly Kid Joe, The Dwarves, The Atomic Bitchwax, Crippled Black Phoenix, W.A.S.P, Guns N’ Roses, Twisted Sister, Quiet Riot, Warrant, La Guns, Great White, Night Ranger, Godflesh, Marilyn Manson, Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet 13, Dropkick Murphies, Dayglo Abortions, Flipper and more.\n\nBlack Sabbath are credited with the invention of Heavy Metal, their influence can be felt all over the Rock, Punk and Metal spectrum, and with individual tracks the band have even spawned entire subgenres. For example ‘Symptom Of The Universe’ contains all the key ingredients for Thrash Metal and it was covered by the Thrash Band Sepultura (as well as the Stoner band Orange Goblin and the Alternative Metal band Helmet).\n\nFurthermore the trio of ‘Sweet Leaf,’ ‘Electric Funeral’ and ‘Into The Void’ collectively contain the key ingredients to the Stoner sound and the Doom sound, and have been resemble-to-the-point-of-covered by Sleep as well actually covered by the Stoner bands Kyuss, Monster Magnet & Orange Goblin, as well as the the Groove Metal band Pantera, the Thrash bands Sacred Reich and Exhorder, the Nu Metal band Godsmack, the Alternative/Grunge/Sludge band The Melvins, the Power Metal band Iced Earth and even Ugly Kid Joe)\n\nIf you want to be pedantic you could even argue that ‘Supertzar’ almost planted the seeds for Symphonic Metal, after a fashion.\n\n***\n\nAerosmith – Toys In The Attic, 1975, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Glam) USA\n\nAerosmith – Pump, 1989, Mixed (Hard Rock & Glam) USA\n\nKix – Kix, 1981, Mixed (With Classic Rock, Heavy Metal & Glam) Australia\n\nDef Leppard – Pyromania, 1983, Mixed (With Heavy Metal & Glam) UK\n\nDef Leppard – Hysteria, 1987, Mixed (With Heavy Metal & Glam) UK\n\nWhitesnake – Love Hunter, 1979, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Heavy Metal) UK\n\nWhitesnake – Whitesnake, 1987, Mixed (With Heavy Metal & Glam) UK\n\nQuiet Riot – Metal Health, 1983, Mixed (With Classic Rock & Glam) USA\n\nTwisted Sister – Under The Blade, 1982, Glam, USA\n\nTwisted Sister – Stay Hungry, 1984, Mixed (With Glam & Heavy Metal), USA\n\nHanoi Rocks – Two Steps From The Move, 1984, Mixed (With Glam & Punk & Heavy Metal), Finland\n\nMotley Crüe – Shout At The Devil, 1983, Mixed (With Glam & Heavy Metal), USA\n\nMotley Crüe – Dr. Feelgood, 1989, Mixed (With Glam & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nMotley Crüe – Motley Crüe, 1994, Mixed (With Glam & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nDokken – Tooth And Nail, 1985, Mixed (With Glam & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nRatt – Invasion Of Your Privacy, 1985, Glam, USA\n\nStryper – To Hell With The Devil, 1986, Glam, USA\n\nGreat White – Once Bitten, 1987, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nGreat White – …Twice Shy, 1989, Glam, USA\n\nWhite Lion – Pride, 1987, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nWarrant – Cherry Pie, 1990, Glam, USA\n\nPoison – Look What The Cat Dragged In, 1986, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nPoison – Open Up And Say …Ahhh!, 1988, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nCinderella – Night Songs, 1987, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nEurope – The Final Countdown, 1986, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nBon Jovi – Slippery When Wet, 1986, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nBon Jovi – New Jersey, 1988, Mixed (With Glam & Pop) USA\n\nSkid Row – Skid Row, 1989, Mixed (With Glam, Hard Rock & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nSkid Row – Slave To The Grind, 1991, Mixed (With Glam, Hard Rock & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nGuns N Roses – Appetite For Destruction, 1987, Mixed (With Glam, Hard Rock & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nGuns N Roses – Use Your Illusion 1, 1991, Mixed (With Glam, Hard Rock & Heavy Metal) USA\n\nW.A.S.P – W.A.S.P, 1984, Heavy Metal, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nW.A.S.P – The Last Command, 1985, Heavy Metal, USA\n\nW.A.S.P – The Crimson Idol, 1992, Heavy Metal, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nGeorgia Satellites – Georgia Satellites , 1986, Mixed (With Glam and Southern Rock) USA\n\nDangerous Toys – Dangerous Toys, 1989, Mixed (With Glam and Southern Rock) USA\n\nSlaughter – Stick It To Ya, 1990, Mixed (With Glam and Heavy Metal) USA\n\nTesla – Mechanical Resistance, 1984, Mixed (With Glam and Heavy Metal) UK\n\nThunder – Backstreet Symphony, 1990, Mixed (With Glam and Heavy Metal) UK\n\nLita Ford – Lita, 1988, Mixed (With Glam, Pop and Heavy Metal) USA\n\nThe Darkness – Permission To Land, 2003, Mixed (With Glam & Hard Rock) UK\n\nSteel Panther – Feel The Steel, 2009, Mixed (With Glam & Hard Rock) UK\n\n***\n\nA lot of the early work of Hair Metal bands, such as ‘Burn In Hell’ by Twisted Sister, or Dokken’s ‘Bullets To Spare’ was very similar to traditional Heavy Metal; before the more keyboard, ballad and production-job focused wave of Glam Bands became popular. This may go some way to explain why the earlier bands got called Metal, while the later bands got called Glam, Gypsy Rock or other related terms. Many members of the American public often confuse the most accessible pop-side of the Glam movement with all Metal, which explains why Grunge and Prog musicians mistook Metal as a simplistic genre for so long.\n\nWhile some Metal purists may overlook the entire genre because of what hit-obsessed record company executives turned the genre into when bands mixed Glam with Pop music, its important to remember that there are songs by bands like W.A.S.P and even Ratt that sound almost indistinguishable from traditional Heavy Metal in the tradition of Sabbath, Priest and Maiden (If you haven’t heard any such Metallic Hair Metal, click here). Even when they weren’t that heavy, they were often at a level of heaviness similar to 70s Hard Rock acts like Areosmith and Kiss.\n\nThe commercial impact of Hair Metal drew numerous new fans into becoming Rock and even Metal fans, and had an impact on existing bands who took elements of the Hair Metal sound into their own sound. Judas Priest famously took influence from Hair Metal lyrical themes and synth sounds to a massive hysterical critical and fan backlash and Rainbow, Def Leppard and Whitesnake all incorporated parts of it.\n\nConversely, In reaction to the melodic and poppier sound of Hair Metal, many Metal bands (especially Thrash bands) were inspired to become even faster, heavier and darker than they already were.\n\nFurthermore, like Prog’s impact on Punk, Hair Metal’s popularity and perceived excess also had a direct impact on the formation and popularity of the reactionary Grunge and Stoner Rock genres (two sides of the return-to-Classic-Rock-and-Metal’s-Spirit idea, which saw bands back-pedalling away from Hair Metal and starting bands with a sound and spirit more akin to the Zeppelins and Sabbaths of the 70s).\n\nHair Metal bands were influenced from a variety of different sources. AC/DC, David Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper and Queen seem to be the most prevalent, although Pop, Prog Rock and Southern Rock bands also crept in there.\n\nDokken covered ELP, The Beatles and the Yardbirds, members of them have played on Iron Maiden and Rush tribute albums. Ratt have covered Creedence Clearwater Revival. Cinderella have covered Janis Joplin and Scorpions. W.A.S.P have covered Ray Charles, Jethro Tull, Mountain, Deep Purple, Humble Pie, Uriah Heap, Chuck Berry, The Who, Elton John, Queen and more. Hanoi Rocks have covered The Stooges, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Hall & Oats. Warrant have covered AC/DC, Nazareth, Blackfoot, Areosmith, Queen. Def Leppard have covered ELO, T-Rex, Sweet, Jeff Beck, Thin Lizzy, David Bowie, Alice Cooper, Mott The Hoople, Badfinger, Engelbert Humperdinck, Rod Stewart, Roxy Music, The Kink and The Rolling Stones.

Extreme have covered The Beatles, Wild Cherry, Queen and Kiss. Great White have covered Humble Pie, Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix, Badfinger, Robin Trower, Led Zeppelin, X, Free, Jefferson Airplane, The Who, Bob Dylan, Savoy Brown. Tesla have covered Peter Frampton, Traffic, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Who, Bad Company, Aerosmith, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Montrose, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and Jeff Beck. Enuff Z’Nuff covered Cheap Trick, John Lennon, The Beatles, David Bowie, Queen and David Lee Roth. Mr. Big have covered Cat Stevens, Free, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. Britny Fox have covered Nazareth and Slade. Stryper have covered Judas Priest, Kansas, Scorpions, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, UFO, Van Halen, Ozzy, Boston, Sweet, Kiss, Iron Maiden and Earth Wind & Fire. Lita Ford covered Alice Cooper, Monstrose and Generation X.\n\nEven though a vocal minority of purists would like to delete the Hair Metal chapter from Metal’s History, it is there, and it did influence everything which came after it in one way or another.

Some bands, like Motörhead and Iron Maiden became some of the most important, influential and iconic bands in the history of Metal, but some like Diamond Head, Angel Witch and Tygers Of Pan Tang are more famous today for their influence on bands like Metallica. Bands like Angel Witch and especially Venom were particularly influential on Thrash Metal and later various Extreme Metal styles.\n\nSome music by bands like Tygers Of Pan Tang and Saxon can sound more like Thin Lizzy than Metallica so its always interesting to listen to the broad and diverse Spectrum of NWOBHM bands. Just as the basis of bands in the Grunge movement varied from Punk to Hardcore to Noise to Classic Rock to Heavy Metal to Hair Metal, often two NWOBHM artists would sounds vastly different, one with a softer Rock sound, one more Progressive Rock influenced, and another sounding almost like Thrash, Black or Power Metal at times.\n\nIn recent years there has come to be a New Wave Of Traditional Heavy Metal sub-subgenre in which artist seek to replicate the sound, spirit and ideals of this era of music (more so than Stoner Rock and Power Metal already did in their own ways). Bands like White Wizzard, Cauldron, Enforcer, Holy Grail, Wolf, Ram, Steelwing and countless others can fall into this category. However since the time has passed, there is often little to distinguish some artists from fitting into another subgenre such as Stoner Metal (in the case of The Sword, Blood Ceremony and Grand Magus) Folk Metal (in the case of Slough Feg) or Power Metal (in the majority of borderline cases and bands with names derived from Judas Priest lyrics). Some artists can toe the line between NWOTHM and Thrash Revival, they are reviving an old school sound from the eighties but can’t help mixing in some of their other influences.\n\nSometimes reviving sounds from the early 80s isn’t enough to actually designate a band as either NWOTHM however. Some Metalcore bands such as Bullet For My Valentine and Shadows Fall sometimes intend to come across as a revival of Thrash or Trad Metal but their choice of production styles and choruses separate them from the generally agreed upon Thrash Revival or NWOTHM sound.\n\nIn any case, none of these later bands would sound anything like they do without the NWOBHM and Traditional Heavy Metal bands of the late seventies to mid-eighties.\n\n***\n\nMetallica – Kill ‘Em All, 1983, Thrash, USA\n\nMetallica – Ride The Lightning, 1984, Thrash, USA\n\nMetallica – Master Of Puppets, 1986, Thrash, USA\n\nMetallica – …And Justice For All, 1988, Thrash, USA\n\nMetallica – Metallica, 1991, Mixed (With Thrash & Hard Rock) USA\n\nMegadeth – Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying?, 1986, Thrash, USA\n\nMegadeth – Rust In Peace, 1990, Thrash, USA\n\nMegadeth – Countdown To Extinction, 1992, Mixed (With Thrash & Hard Rock) USA\n\nMegadeth – Endgame, 2009, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nAnthrax – Fistful Of Metal, 1983, Thrash, USA\n\nAnthrax – Among The Living, 1987, Thrash, USA\n\nAnthrax – The Sound Of White Noise, 1991, (Mixed with Thrash & Hard Rock) USA\n\nSlayer – Show No Mercy, 1983, Thrash, USA\n\nSlayer – Hell Awaits, 1985, Thrash, USA\n\nSlayer – Reign In Blood, 1986, Thrash, USA\n\nSlayer – South Of Heaven, 1988, Thrash, USA\n\nSlayer – Seasons In The Abyss, 1990, Thrash, USA\n\nOnslaught – The Force, 1986, Thrash, UK\n\nExodus – Bonded By Blood, 1985, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nExodus – Fabulous Disaster, 1989, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nExodus – Tempo Of The Damned, 2004, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nExodus – The Atrocity Exhibition Exhibit A, 2007, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nTestament – The Legacy, 1987, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nTestament – Practice What You Preach, 1989, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nTestament – The Gathering, 1999, Thrash, USA\n\nOverkill – Taking Over, 1987, Thrash, USA\n\nOverkill – The Years Of Decay, 1989, Thrash, USA\n\nOverkill – Horrorscope, 1991, Thrash, USA\n\nOverkill – Iron Bound, 2010, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nNuclear Assault – Survive, 1988, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nNuclear Assault – Handle With Care, 1989, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nSacred Reich – The American Way, 1990, Thrash, USA\n\nDark Angel – Darkness Descends, 1986, Thrash, USA\n\nForbidden – Forbidden Evil, 1988, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nDeath Angel – The Ultra-Violence, 1987, Thrash, USA\n\nDeath Angel – Act III, 1990, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nVio-lence – Eternal Nightmare, 1988, Thrash, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nFlotsam & Jetsam – Doomsday & The Deceiver, 1986, Thrash, USA\n\nFlotsam & Jetsam – No Place For Disgrace, 1988, Thrash, USA\n\nLääz Rockit – Know Your Enemy, 1987, Thrash, USA\n\nSepultura – Beneath The Remains, 1989, Thrash, Brazil\n\nSepultura – Arise, 1993, Thrash, Brazil\n\nKreator – Pleasure To Kill, 1986, Thrash, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nKreator – Extreme Aggression, 1989, Thrash, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nKreator – Hordes Of Chaos, 2009, Thrash, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nSodom – Obsessed By Cruelty, 1986, Mixed (Thrash Metal & Black Metal), Germany\n\nSodom – Agent Orange, 1989, Thrash, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nSodom – M-16, 2001, Thrash, Germany\n\nDestruction – Eternal Devastation, 1986, Thrash, Germany\n\nTankard – Zombie Attack, 1986, Thrash, Germany\n\nExumer – Possesed By Fire, 1986, Thrash, Germany\n\nHoly Terror – Terror & Submission, 1986, Thrash, Germany\n\nVoivod – War & Pain 1984, Thrash, Canada\n\nAnnihilator – Alice In Hell, 1989, Thrash, Canada\n\nAnnihilator – Never Neverland, 1990, Thrash, Canada\n\nWatchtower – Energetic Disasembly, 1985, Mixed (With Thrash & Prog) USA\n\nWatchtower – Control & Reistance, 1989, Mixed (With Thrash & Prog) USA\n\nRealm – Endless War, 1988, Mixed (With Thrash & Prog) USA\n\nArtillery – By Inheritance, 1990, Thrash, Denmark\n\nSadus – Swallowed In Black, 1990, Thrash, USA\n\nSabbat – History Of A Time To Come, 1988, Mixed (With Thrash, Prog, Black & Death) UK\n\nPosessed – Seven Churches, 1985, Mixed (With Thrash & Death) USA\n\nPosessed – Beyond The Gates, 1986, Mixed (With Thrash & Death) USA\n\nBathory – Bathory, 1984, Mixed (With Thrash, Black & Death) Sweden\n\nBathory – Under The Sign Of The Black Mark, 1987, Mixed (With Thrash, Black & Death) Sweden\n\nBathory – Blood Fire Death, 1988, Mixed (Thrash Metal & Black Metal), Sweden\n\nCeltic Frost – Morbid Tales, 1984, Mixed, Switzerland\n\nCeltic Frost – To The Mega Therion, 1985, Mixed, Switzerland\n\nCeltic Frost – Into The Pandemonium, 1987, Mixed (Avant-Garde) Switzerland\n\nHellhammer – Apocalyptic Raids 1990 AD, 1990, Mixed (with Black Metal) Switzerland\n\n***\n\nThrash Metal’s importance in the history, definition and continuing evolution of Metal cannot be understated and instances of Thrash Metal’s biggest bands’ influence on subsequent generations are almost too numerous to count. Although a lot of people may consider Thrash as an extreme subgenre, in a lot of ways it is sort of a distillation of the real heart and soul of most of Metal’s core sounds and values.\n\nDuring the commercial peak of Hair Metal, when bands made music with part of Metal’s key sound and popularized it to a wider audience at the expense of what certain Metal fans considered Metal’s core values and credibility; Thrash Metal took that key sound, attitude and those core values and did its best to highlighted them, at times deliberately cultivating an audience of anti-Hair Metal fans as a sort of gut-level marketing technique (in the same way that many Punk bands had done to Prog a decade earlier).\n\nMany of the Thrash bands took influence from the original Heavy Metal bands and the NWOBHM movement, as well as from the Punk Movement (as well of course as from Motörhead who combined elements of the two) and combined them in such a way as to create a new subgenre the primary characteristics of which were speed and aggression (more so than could already be said for Rock, Punk and Metal Music in general that is).\n\nIn the early years of Thrash, bands like Metallica, Anthrax and Overkill combined the key elements of these two styles, covering or taking influence from tracks by the likes of Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden (and Diamond Head especially in the case of Metallica) as much as by the likes of GBH, Sex Pistols and Dead Boys.\n\nIn the later years of Thrash’s first incarnation, bands began writing longer, more complex tracks and albums like ‘…And Justice For All’ and ‘The Years Of Decay,’ which demonstrated a very progressive attitude but without actually becoming full-out Prog albums.\n\nAfter Thrash became popular several existing Metal bands, such a Judas Priest, Accept and Raven took on elements of Thrash Metal into their own sound. This was also true of Punk and Hardcore Punk bands, which gave rise to the Crossover Thrash sub-subgenre, in which Thrash Metal bands like Nuclear Assault, M.O.D and others would take large elements of the Hardcore Punk sound into their own Thrash music and Punk and Hardcore Punk bands like The Exploited, Corrosion Of Conformity, D.R.I etc would make Punk music that incorporated a lot of Thrash Metal’s sounds.\n\nThrash Metal also played a large part in the invention and popularization of the emerging Death Metal, Power Metal, Prog Metal and Black Metal Subgenres, as well as the later Groove Metal, Melodeath, Metalcore and Thrash Revival subgenres. Types of riffs, general approaches to instruments and drumming styles that were either invented or popularized by early pioneers such as Dave Mustaine, Dave Lombardo, Cliff Burton and Gary Holt can be found to some extent or other in most forms of Metal that came afterwards:\n\nThe Blast Beat, a key component of most Grindcore, Black Metal and Death Metal albums was arguably invented (or at least popularized) by Charlie Benante on Crossover Thrash band S.O.D’s debut album.\n\nHelloween, who are one of the most important bands in the history of Power Metal started off as a Thrash Metal band.\n\nProg Metal band Dream Theater have covered numerous tracks by Metallica, including the entire ‘Master Of Puppets’ album.\n\nMany of the early Death Metal albums still featured a lot of key Thrash Metal musical tropes, and the genre was arguably named in a song by Possessed, who were considered a Thrash band by many (although some fans have retroactively deigned them a Death Metal band). Many Death Metal bands, from Decapitated to Six Feet Under have covered music by Thrash Metal bands, especially Slayer. Cannibal Corpse have covered Metallica and Napalm Death have covered songs by both Sepultura and Kreator.\n\nThe Thrash Metal bands Sodom and Sabbat, along with several ‘War Metal’ or ‘Viking Metal’ bands like Celtic Frost, Venom, Hellhammer and Bathory who were at least partially Thrash Metal were heavily influential on Black Metal bands to the point of being considered part of a First Wave Of Black Metal that pre-dates the actual establishment of the genre as its recognized today (the first wave of which is considered to be the second wave of Black Metal by purists).\n\nCradle Of Filth, who are associated with but separate from Black Metal, have covered both Slayer and Sodom.\n\nThrash also influenced Metalcore bands; like Shadows Fall and Trivum, who made their love of Thrash Metal known frequently sonically, in interviews and in their choice of covers are sometimes actually referred to as Thrash Metal bands by certain fans and even magazines. Chimaira took considerable lead guitar influence from Metallica and Lamb Of God owe a large portion of their sound to Slayer.\n\nThe Thrash Metal band Anthrax even played a hand in the popularization of Rap Metal/Nu Metal due to the success of their track ‘Bring The Noise’ which was a reworking of a track by the Hip-Hop band Public Enemy and actually featured Public Enemy rapping over Thrash Metal guitar riffs, something of a unique event at the time. They rapped over their own music even earlier on the track ‘I’m The Man.’ Metallica, Megadeth and Sepultura also had an influential impact on the Nu Metal subgenre with their Self-Titled (Black), ‘Countdown To Extinction’ and ‘Roots’ albums respectively. Furthermore, Thrash had, in part, an indirect impact on the Nu Metal (and in fact Doom Metal) movement through a reactionary contrast to its focus on speed, while the non-relenting intensity of most Thrash songs also had a similar effect on Grunge and Nu Metal songs which then chose to have much more broken up and dynamic song structures, after a decade of what some of those bands would have considered to be bands taking things to far in one direction.\n\nRecently; there has been a revival of Thrash Metal movement, featuring bands like Municipal Waste, Revoker, Gama Bomb, SSS, Evile and others, in which bands attempt to largely recreate the sound of classic 1980s Thrash Metal often as strictly as possible.\n\nLike other forms of music, Thrash musician’s non-musical work is sometimes noteworthy, such as Thrash Musicians like Ross Robinson and Andy Sneap going on to become important producers who have a hand in defining what the current sound of Metal is.\n\nOverall; Thrash Metal, especially its most important and famous bands and albums, had and continues to have an unarguable impact on the history and sound of Metal music.\n\n***\n\nPissing Razors – Cast Down The Plague, 1999, Groove, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nPantera – Cowboys From Hell, 1990, Mixed (With Thrash & Groove) USA, Reviewed Here\n\nPantera – Vulgar Display Of Power, 1992, Groove, USA,\n\nPantera – Far Beyond Driven, 1994, Groove, USA\n\nMachine Head – Burn My Eyes, 1994, Groove, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nMachine Head – The More Things Change, 1997, Groove, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nMachine Head – The Blackening, 2007, Mixed (With Groove, Thrash & Metalcore) USA, Reviewed Here\n\nSepultura – Chaos AD, 1993, Groove, Brazil\n\nSepultura – Roots, 1996, Mixed (With Groove & Nu Metal) Brazil\n\nSepultura – Roorback, 2003, Mixed (With Groove & Crossover) Brazil\n\nFear Factory – Demanufacture, 1995, Groove, USA,\n\nFear Factory – Obsolete, 1998, Groove, USA\n\nFear Factory – Mechanize, 2010, Groove, USA\n\nChannel Zero – Stigmatized For Life, 1993, Groove, Belgium\n\nProng – Cleansing, 1994, Mixed, USA\n\nBlack Label Society – Sonic Brew, 1998, Mixed (With Groove & Stoner) USA,\n\nReviewed Here\n\nBlack Label Society – 1919 Eternal, 2002, Mixed (With Groove,Stoner & Nu Metal) USA, Reviewed Here\n\nBlack Label Society – The Blessed Hellride, 2002, Mixed (With Groove,Stoner & Nu Metal) USA, Reviewed Here\n\nBlack Label Society – Order Of The Black, 2010, Mixed (With Groove & Stoner) USA, Reviewed Here\n\nGwar – Scumdogs Of The Universe, 1991, Mixed, USA\n\n****\n\nGroove Metal was directly influenced by Thrash and is also known by certain fans as “Post Thrash,” or even actually just considered to still be Thrash by others. It isn’t technically a real subgenre on its own, but the post-Thrash release of albums like Chaos AD, Vulgar Display Of Power and Demanufacture has had an unmistakably large impact on the world of Metal.\n\nThe Thrash band Exhorder’s music bares a lot of sonic similarities with Groove Metal and had a direct and audible influence on the definitive Groove Metal band Pantera’s music. Pantera singer Phil Anselmo had even been a roadie for Exhorder at a time when Pantera were primarily playing a Glam/Hair derived form of music.\n\nSepultura, who released one of the definitive Groove Metal albums of all time in ‘Chaos AD’ were primarily a Thrash Metal band before its release (as well as being considered a Death Metal band by many fans).\n\nRobb Flynn of the influential Groove Metal band was a member of the Thrash Metal band Vio-lence and took a large part of the Thrash style with him into Machine Head’s sound.\n\n****\n\nCoroner – Mental Vortex, 1990, Mixed (with Thrash &

Lyrically, vocally, and in terms of speed, heaviness and detuning, atonality and the physical challenge of actually being able to play the music, Death Metal is often the absolute extreme of each characteristic, or very close to the absolute extreme.\n\nDeath Metal’s popularity and limitations on popularity affected several bands. Fear Factory for example actually started out as a Death Metal band before developing their signature sound, and Entombed, who released some of the genre’s most definitive material on their first two albums eventually mixed it with Hard Rock with the ‘Wolverine Blues’ album. Morbid Angel combined it with Nu Metal and Industrial music on ‘Illud Divinium Insanus.’ Carcass and Napalm Death combined Grindcore with Death Metal on their ‘The Necroticism’ and ‘Harmony Corruption’ albums, although Carcass then went on to combine this with Traditional Heavy Metal and make one of the most influential albums for Melodeath bands in ‘Heartwork.’\n\nOne of the biggest influences that Death Metal had on other forms of music was in the form of the popularization of guttural Death Vocals, which other bands since Death Metal became popular often use sparingly either as backing vocals, for a few brief sections per song or in rare instances for a whole out-of-character track. Even Mondo Generator and Green Day for example each have at least one song (‘Girls Like Christ’ and ‘Take Back’ respectively) in which Death Vocals are used over the bands’ normal Punk music.\n\nIn addition to the vocal style, the general intensity and perceived brutality of the genre influenced many popular non-Death Metal bands. Pantera famously made their music heavier on Far Beyond Driven due to a love of the genre, and Slipknot incorporated death influenced Blast Beats into their second though to fourth albums. Soulfly, who started off as a combination Nu Metal and Groove Metal band gradually incorporated many Thrash and later Death Metal elements into their sound over the years and have featured guest vocal appearances from Death Metal singers including David Vincent of Morbid Angel and Travis Ryan of Cattle Decapitation.\n\nThe combination of Death Metal with other subgenres such as Grindcore and Traditional Heavy Metal gave rise to subgenres such as Goregrind and Melodic Death Metal. Bands from Pig Destroyer and The Berzerker to Soilwork and At The Gates owe a large part of their sound to Death Metal.\n\nDeath Metal also had a clear and direct influence on Metalcore. Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall and Parkway Drive for example have taken influence from Death Metal to form a part of their sound, primarily through the aforementioned vocals but also through subtle guitar influences. Chimaira took an even more direct guitar influence from Six Feet Under and Cannibal Corpse. Slipknot are also heavily influenced by several Death Metal artists, including Deicide and bands like Messugah and later Periphery and Uneven Structure were directly and indirectly influenced by Death Metal’s prevalent atonal guitar style and low tunings.\n\nThe sub-subgenre of Deathcore is a form of Metalcore that is even more specifically inclusive of Death Metal tropes. Much like Crossover Thrash, the music came both from excessively Death Metal influenced Metalcore bands as well as from excessively Metalcore influenced Death Metal bands. Bands like Job For A Cowboy and Whitechapel can sound strictly Death Metal one moment and play things a Death Metal band would never play moments later.\n\nFrom the early Death Metal-esque Thrash albums of Sepultura and Possesed to the Tampa Scene, to technical and progressive Death Metal bands, as well as Blackened Death Metal bands who combine elements of both Black and Death Metal, and Melodic Death Metal bands with inspirational lead guitarists; Death Metal has had a wide and lasting influence on the sound and history of Metal ever since its invention, most notably in the field of extreme metal, but also on a surprising number of bigger and more commercial bands too.\n\n***\n\nCarcass – Symphonies Of Sickness, 1989, Grindcore, UK\n\nCarcass – Necroticism, 1991, Mixed (With Grindcore & Death) UK\n\nCarcass – Heartwork, 1993, Mixed (With Grindcore & Melodeath) UK\n\nNapalm Death – Scum, 1987, Grindcore, UK\n\nNapalm Death – Harmony Corruption, 1987, Mixed (With Grindcore & Death) UK, Reviewed Here\n\nNapalm Death – Fear Emptiness Despair, 1994, Mixed (With Death, Groove & Grindcore) UK, Reviewed Here\n\nNapalm Death – Enemy Of The Music Business, 2000, Mixed (With Death, Groove & Grindcore) UK, Reviewed Here\n\nExtreme Noise Terror – Holocaust In Your Head, 1989, Grindcore, UK\n\nRepulsion – Horrified, 1986/1989, Grindcore, UK\n\nTerrorizer – World Downfall, 1989, Grindcore, USA\n\nImpetigo – Ultimate Mondo Cannibale, 1990, Grindcore, USA\n\nBrutal Truth – Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses, 1992, Grindcore, USA\n\nBrutal Truth – Sounds Of The Animal Kingdom, 1997, (With Grindcore, Crust Punk and Prog) USA\n\nAnal Cunt – Everyone Should Be Killed, 1994, Grindcore, USA\n\nBrujeria – Matando Güeros, 1993, Grindcore, USA\n\nAgoraphobic Nosebleed – Honky Reduction, 1998, Grindcore, USA\n\nAgoraphobic Nosebleed – Altered States Of America, 2003, Grindcore, USA\n\nMortician – Chainsaw Dismemberment, 1999, Grindcore, USA\n\nMortician – Darkest Day Of Horror, 2003, Grindcore, USA\n\nPig Destroyer – Prowler In The Yard, 2001, Grindcore, USA\n\nPig Destroyer – Terifyer, 2006, Grindcore, USA\n\nNasum – Inhale/Exhale, 1998, Grindcore, Sweden\n\nNasum – Human 2.0, 2000, Grindcore, Sweden\n\nCephalic Carnage – Anomalies, 2005, Mixed (With Grindcore & Death) USA\n\nThe Berzerker – Dissimulate, 2002, Mixed, Australia\n\nExhumed – Anatomy Is Destiny, 2003, Mixed, USA\n\nCattle Decapitation – Humanure, 2004, Mixed, USA\n\n*** Grindcore has is roots in both Anarchopunk and Hardcore Punk, but over the years has mixed together with elements of other extreme Metal subgenres in interesting ways. There are Crossover points that are Death Metal bands playing Grindcore riffs, Black Metal bands using extremely brief song durations, Grindcore bands changing into Death Metal bands over time. Members of Grindcore albums have joined, toured with, worked as a producer on or had their records produced by members of Death Metal bands or Thrash bands or even Hardcore bands.\n\nFor example Exhumed have covered Possesed, King Diamond and Sodom. Exhumed’s debut was produced by Death’s James Murphy. Travis from Cattle Decapitation has guest appeared with Soulfly and Chimaira. Both Deicide’s Glen Benton and Obituary’s John Tardy appear on Napalm Death’s ‘Unfit Earth.’ Decaptiated have covered Napalm Death. Vader have covered Terrorizer.\n\nAt times the distinction between Grindcore and Death Metal becomes blurred, and Deathgrind and Goregrind are used to term bands like this, although over time these bands have influenced other artists to the point of starting distinct genres of their own.\n\nSome bands have mixed progressive ideas, or electronic sounds with it to create new and interesting variations on the base sound.\n\nCarcass branched off into Melodeath, influencing countless artists and Napalm Death continuously reinvent themselves.\n\nBands like Exhumed (as covered by Job For A Cowboy) and Agoraphobic Nosebleed have been influential on the Deathcore subgenre. ***\n\nEmperor – In The Nightside Eclipse, 1994, Black, Norway\n\nEmperor – Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, 1997,

subgenres by mixing with other sounds such as industrial, ambient, soundscape, folk, thrash, death, prog, shoegaze etc.\n\nChildren Of Bodom and Opeth both have artistic roots in Black Metal but present entirely different sounds.\n\nBands mix parts of Black Metal with hardcore, early Swedish Death Metal and modern punk to create new music. Trap Them, Black Breath and Kvelertak would sound utterly different if not for the influence of Black Metal. Even Metalcore bands like Chimaira owe at least one song’s sound to the influence of Black Metal.\n\n***\n\nSkyclad – The Wayward Sons Of Mother Earth, 1991, Folk-Metal, UK\n\nCruachan – Tuatha Na Gael, 1995, Folk-Metal, Ireland\n\nThe Lord Weird Slough Feg – The Lord Weird Slough Feg, 1996, Folk-Metal, USA\n\nSlough Feg – Ape Uprising, 2009, Folk-Metal, USA\n\nMägo de Oz – Mägo de Oz, 1994, Mixed (Folk and Metal) Spain\n\nTýr – Ragnarok, 2006, Folk-Metal, Faroe Islands\n\nMoonsorrow – Voimasta Ja Kunniasta, 2001, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nMoonsorrow – Kivenkantaja, 2003, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nEnsiferum – Ensiferum, 2001, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nEnsfirium – Unsung Heroes, 2012, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nFinntroll – Jaktens Tid, 2001, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nАpkoha – Гой, Роде, гой!, 2009, Folk-Metal, Russia\n\nSIG:AR:TYR – Beyond The North Winds, 2008, Folk-Metal, Canada\n\nHeidevolk – Uit Oude Grond, 2010, Folk-Metal, Netherlands\n\nKorpiklaani – Tales Along This Road, 2006, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nMetsatöll – Äio, 2010, Folk-Metal, Estonia\n\nTurisas – The Varangian Way, 2007, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nTurisas – Stand Up And Fight, 2011, Folk-Metal, Finland\n\nAlestorm – Captain Morgan’s Revenge, 2008, Folk-Metal, UK\n\n***\n\nFolk Metal is a vague term that can apply to a whole host of vastly different bands. Adding folk instrumentation, playing reinterpretations of traditional folk pieces or having folklore based lyrics and imagery all can land a band with the folk metal tag. The bands may have their roots in Black Metal, Melodic Death Metal, Power Metal, Thrash Metal (or anything else) and two folk metal bands may share almost no sonic similarities excluding the fact that they use additional bow or wind based instruments and may write lyrics about folklore, or in some cases alcohol. Commonly, the vocals may not be delivered in English as frequently as they would be in other subgenres.\n\nWith that being said, there are many Folk Metal bands who share a similar aesthetic in terms of their metal influence and not just their folk influence. Two of the most common types of Folk Metal are those rooted in Melodic European Power Metal and those rooted in Black Metal.\n\nThere are folk metal bands who take things very seriously and bands who are very over the top and silly, there are bands with comedy overtones and who dress in costumes as well as those who just play Metal as any normal band, but with parts of their music rooted in folk music.\n\nSimilarly, many bands may use folk influences, additional instrumentation, sing about their own cultures or in their own languages but still escape the term, for example Soulfly and Jurojin.\n\n***\n\nHaggard – And Thou Shalt The Seer, 1997, Mixed (with Symphonic & Doom), Germany\n\nNightwish – Oceanborn, 1998, Symphonic, Finland\n\nEpica – Design Your Universe, 2009, Symphonic, Netherlands\n\nTherion – Theli, 1996, Symphonic, Sweden\n\nWithin Temptation – The Silent Force, 2004, Symphonic, Netherlands\n\nDelain – April Rain, 2009, Symphonic, Netherlands\n\nAmberian Dawn – River Of Tuoni, 2008, Symphonic, Finland\n\nEquilibrium – Sagas, 2008, Symphonic, Germany\n\nPythia – The Sepent’s Curse, 2012, Symphonic, UK\n\nXandria – Neverworld’s End, 2012, Symphonic, Germany\n\n****\n\nMuch like Folk Metal, Symphonic Metal is a very vague subgenre title and not entirely agreed upon by Metal fans and musicologists. Many Metal bands may work with a Symphony orchestra and not get labeled as Symphonic Metal. There are also very Symphonic Black Metal albums by Dimmu Borgir and Emperor (to name but a few) that are not often called Symphonic Black Metal and there are very symphonic Power Metal albums by Rhapsody that aren’t always called Symphonic Metal, because they don’t specifically sound like Amber Dawn and Nightwish.\n\nSimilarly there are Nu Metal and Alternative Metal bands that utilize very similar sounds, approaches and imagery to Symphonic Metal (ie. In This Moment, Lacuna Coil) but are not routinely called Symphonic Metal, because the non-symphonic components of their sound are too different. Sometimes the combination of the two styles is jokingly referred to as “Corset Metal” due to the prominence of Female lead singers in Gothic clothing.\n\nFleshgod Apocalypse have popularized the idea of Symphonic Death Metal in recent years.\n\nSymphonic Metal bands often have their roots in Power Metal, Classical Music, Progressive Rock and Gothic Music, often with Neoclassical influenced guitar and a very prominent Keyboard Player. However while this sentence could easily describe Children Of Bodom, the exact blend of influences seems to be key to making a band get categorized as Symphonic Metal.\n\n****\n\nHelloween – Walls Of Jericho, 1985, Mixed (With Thrash & Power) Germany\n\nHelloween – Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part I, 1987, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nHelloween – Keeper Of The Seven Keys Part II, 1988, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nHelloween – Time Of The Oath, 1996, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nHelloween – Straight Out Of Hell, 2013, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nGamma Ray – Heading For Tomorrow, 1990, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nGamma Ray – Land Of The Free, 1995, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nGamma Ray – No World Order, 2001, Power, Germany, Reviewed Here\n\nIron Savior – Iron Savior , 1999, Power, Germany\n\nFreedom Call – Crystal Empire, 1999, Power, Germany\n\nPrimal Fear – Jaws Of Death, 2001, Power, Germany\n\nManowar – Into Glory Ride, 1983, Power, USA\n\nManowar – Hail To England, 1984, Power, USA\n\nManowar – Sign Of The Hammer, 1984, Power, USA\n\nManowar – Kings Of Metal, 1988, Power, USA Reviewed Here\n\nVicious Rumors – Digital Dictator, 1988, Power, USA\n\nVicious Rumors – Vicious Rumors, 1990, Power, USA\n\nHammerfall – Glory To The Be Brave, 1997, Power, Sweden, Reviewed Here\n\nIced Earth – Night Of The Stormrider, 1991, Power, USA\n\nIced Earth – Something Wicked This Way Comes, 1998, Power, USA, Reviewed Here\n\nStratovarius – Dream Space, 1994, Power, Finland\n\nStratovarius – Visions, 1997, Power, Finland, Reviewed Here\n\nStratovarius – Infinite, 2000, Power, Finland, Reviewed Here\n\nSonata Arctica – Ecliptica, 1999, Power, Finland\n\nEdguy – Theater Of Salvation, 1999, Power, Germany\n\nRhapsody (Of Fire) – Symphony Of The Enchanted Lands, 1998, Power, Italy\n\nAngra – Angels Cry, 1993, Power, Brazil\n\nAngra – Holy Land, 1996, Mixed (With Power & Prog) Brazil\n\nFalconer – Chapters From A Vale Forlorn, 2002, Power, Sweeden\n\nDragonforce – Inhuman Rampage, 2006, Power, UK\n\nSabbaton – Carolus Rex, 2012, Power, Sweden\n\nNevermore – The Politics Of Ecstasy, 1996, Power, USA\n\nNevermore – This Godless Endevour, 2005, Power, USA\n\n****\n\nThe basic template for Power Metal is laid down by the mixture of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. The bands often place a lot of emphasis on virtuosity and an over-the-top spirit. They usually add especially fast music (although usually without the sheer ferocity of Thrash), and a lot of very grand sing-along choruses. Often Dio era Rainbow and Queen will inform the sound, and most bands, especially in later waves, like to play “cheesy” ballads.\n\nMany Power Metal bands also like to employ lead Keyboards, in the tradition of Deep Purple, often dueling solos between a keyboard player and a guitarist …although it is not a requirement (in fact the keystone album for the Genre, Keeper Of The Seven Keys by Helloween, doesn’t feature a lead keyboardist).\n\nYngvie Malmsteen, Accept, The Scorpions and Running Wild were all huge influences on a lot of Power Metal bands and help to define its “European Sound.”\n\nAlthough Power Metal is often thought of as being really European, that is only part of the story. The Genre is often split into two spiritual camps: 1) “Melodic” or European Power Metal (although bands from non-Euopeans often play this kind of music and 2) USPM – The American Kind – (although bands from non-Americans often play this kind of music).\n\nWith USPM, especially the later stuff, a huge early-Metallica and Painkiller-era-Judas Priest is often detectable. Bands like Savatage, Crimson Glory and Queensryche (who fit comfortably into early Prog Metal brackets as well) can be viewed as a sort of first wave of USPM and inform a lot of the sound too. The influence of Warning era Queensryche on Iced Earth for example is absolutely undeniable (just compare ‘Roads To Madness’ and ‘Melancholy [Holy Martyr]’ to see how much).\n\nOnly Two camps is an oversimplification of course, as there are different approaches, attitudes and mixtures with which bands can take things. Power Metal bands can often blur the lines between Folk Metal, Prog Metal, Melodic Death Metal or Thrash Metal on different songs or albums. Grave Digger are heavier than Stratovarius but not quite as heavy as Children Of Bodom.\n\n****\n\nX Japan – Blue Blood, 1989, Mixed (With Power & Prog) Japan\n\nSymphony X – The Divine Wings Of

Judas Priest, usually based around grand melodic vocal lines and occasional piercing screams as well as frequent guitar solos.\n\nIn many cases it wasn’t until the late 80s where the bands would become fully progressive by taking a more obvious sonic influence from Prog bands as well as using existing Prog traditions such as writing concept albums.\n\nThese more Traditional Progressive Metal bands (which should be an oxymoron, surely?) like Savatage, Crimson Glory, Fates Warning etc had a lot of sonic similarities with both the earlier work of Power Metal bands (Such as Helloween’s ‘Keeper Of The Seven Keys’ title track) as well as the more theatrical moments from Thrash Metal bands (such as Overkill’s three self-titled tracks and Annihilator’s ‘Fun Palace’).\n\nThe extremely strong crossover between all these subgenres, at a stage when subgenres were more truly subgenres with less of a claim to separate-genre-status than they arguably have today, is a contributing factor in why certain people view certain blatantly Metal acts by today’s broader standards as not actually being Metal. The mutual sonic link between genres in this arbitrary point in the evolution of Metal (long after the actual beginning, but before several of the important innovations) however is not actually definitive of the boundaries of the entire Metal genre as they stand today, and things which fall outside the sonic boundaries of this period can still be considered as Metal.\n\nIt wasn’t so much until the mid-to-late 90s when bands would become truly progressive by writing music that was utterly unique from anything that had ever came before. As opposed to simply writing Metal songs with a Prog influence, they would come to truly progress the boundaries of what Metal could sound like and indeed what still ‘counted as’ Metal.\n\nWith the popularization of Grunge and then the wider Alternative Rock/Metal movement which included among other things early Pop-Punk, Brit Rock, Stoner Rock as well as certain Pop and Singer Songwriter musicians, the scope of areas within which Metal could be Progressed widened.\n\nTool, for example, emerged in the middle of the Grunge scene and since became one of the most influential and important bands in the Metal scene.\n\nLater; Queensrÿche, who were one of the originators of what is considered to be the Traditional Prog Metal sound actually mixed Progressive Metal with Grunge on 1997’s ‘Hear In The Now Frontier’ and with Alternative Metal on ‘Tribe.’ Mudvayne conversely mixed Nu Metal with Prog on ‘L.D 50’ and Rush mixed an Alternative music sound with their own on their ‘Counterparts’ album.\n\nBands like Mastodon and Baroness later combined influences from the Sludge scene they emerged from and combined that with already Sludge-influenced Post Metal bands like Neurosis and Isis as well as selected Progressive Rock traits to once again create genuinely Progressive Metal that bypasses the aforementioned Traditional Prog Metal sound but still deserves the ‘Progressive’ description. Without Hardcore Punk like Black Flag and Flipper inspiring Sludgey Grunge and Metal derived bands like The Melvins and Neurosis, the shape of Prog Metal today would be radically different.\n\nFurthermore, without the existence and influence of Metal as it stands today, several important Prog bands (such as Porcupine Tree and The Mars Volta) would sound vastly different. Even band’s from the very beginning of Prog, including King Crimson themselves actually incorporated Metal into their sound on recent albums.\n\nProg Metal is a very important influence on the Djent movement and many Djent bands are sometimes categorized as Progressive Metal.\n\nFurthermore; in addition to the music that is commonly considered to be either Prog or Post Metal, some Thrash Metal and Death Metal bands display the kind of innovative thinking and musical complexity of progressive bands, but still stick within their subgenre’s stylistic boundaries, and ignore the addition and influence of popular Prog tropes such as the inclusion of mellotron, and are defined separately as technical rather than progressive although the distinction is often very subtle and often blurred (sometimes people use “Technical” as a substitute term for “Progressive” however usually it also has distinct connotations of a specific sound and direction in and of itself).\n\n***\n\nNeurosis – Through Silver In Blood, 1996, Mixed (With Sludge, Post Metal & Prog) USA\n\nNeurosis – Times Of Grace, 1999, Mixed (With Sludge, Post-Metal & Prog) USA\n\nCult Of Luna – Somewhere Along The Highway, 2006, Mixed (With Post Metal) Sweden\n\nIsis – Oceanic, 2002, Post-Metal, USA\n\nIsis – In The Absence Of Truth, 2006, Post-Metal, USA\n\nRosetta – Galilean Satellites, 2005, Post-Metal, USA\n\nRed Sparrowes – At The Soundless Dawn, 2005, Post-Metal, USA\n\nPelican – The Fire In Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, 2005, Mixed (With Post-Metal) USA\n\nThe Ocean – Precambrian, 2007, Post-Metal, USA\n\nJesu – Conquerer, 2007, Post-Metal, UK\n\nRussian Circles – Enter, 2006, Post-Metal, USA\n\nGiant Squid – Cenotes, 2011, Post-Metal, USA\n\nToday Is The Day – Temple Of The Morning Star, 1997, Mixed, USA\n\nUnsanse – Unsane, 1991, Mixed, USA\n\n***\n\nSeparate from Prog Metal, the Progressive genre of Post-Metal exists. Post Metal is analogous to Post Rock in its attitude and conventions, but distinct due to its much heavier and intense sound. It is often characterized by a focus on texture as well as favouring of long slow build-ups, instrumental music, use of repetition to create depth and layers and slow challenging. Neurosis, one of the genre’s most famous acts started their career as a straight up Hardcore Punk band, and with each album moved further and further into unique and unexplored musical territories which combined Metal with numerous influences, including folk.\n\n***\n\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers – Mother’s Milk, 1989, Mixed (With Rock, Metal & Funk) USA\n\nFaith No More – The Real Thing, 1989, Mixed (With Nu Metal & Funk) USA\n\nFaith No More – Angel Dust, 1992, Mixed (With Nu Metal) USA\n\nLiving Colour – Vivid, 1988, Mixed (with Funk) USA\n\nUgly Kid Joe – America’s Least Wanted, 2003, Mixed (With Groove, Funk & Hard Rock) USA\n\nExtreme – Pornograffiti, 1990, Mixed (With Funk, Glam, Hard Rock & Heavy Metal), USA\n\nFishbone – Give A Monkey A Brain And He’ll Swear He’s The Center Of The Universe, 1993, Mixed (With Funk), USA\n\nPrimus – Sailing The Seas Of Cheese, 1991, Mixed (With Funk), USA\n\nInfectious Grooves – The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move…It’s the Infectious Grooves, 1991, Mixed (With Funk), USA\n\nMr. Bungle – Mr. Bungle, 1991, Mixed, USA\n\n***\n\nDuring the late 80s and throughout the 90s, there was a trend of incorporating elements of Funk into rock and metal. This became popular in the Alternative and Nu Metal scenes but also came up in unexpected areas like Hair Metal, Thrash Metal and Death Metal on a smaller scale. Some bands would do it for one song only, or only on their demos, before getting signed and dropping the funk side of their sound due to a change in the musical climate, for example Slipknot and Powerman 5000.\n\nSeveral of the more successful albums to feature this cross over of styles went on to be influential to a multitude of other bands from various spheres.\n\n***\n\nNine Inch Nails – Pretty Hate Machine, 1989, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nNine Inch Nails – The Downward Spiral, 1994, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nNine Inch Nails – The Fragile, 1999, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nSkinny Puppy – Mind The Perpetual Intercourse, 1986, Mixed (With Industrial), Canada\n\nSkinny Puppy – Rabies, 1989, Mixed (With Industrial), Canada\n\nMinistry – The Land Of Rape And Honey, 1988, Industrial, USA\n\nMinistry – Psalm 69, 1992, Industrial, USA\n\nPigface – Gub, 1991, Industrial, USA\n\nChemlab – Burn Out At The Hydrogen Bar, 1993, Industrial, USA\n\n16 Volt – Wisdom, 1993, Industrial, USA\n\nMarilyn Manson – Antichrist Superstar, 1996, Mixed, (With Industrial) USA,\n\nMarilyn Manson – Mechanical Animals, 1998, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nMarilyn Manson – Holywood, 2000, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nRammstein – Mutter, 2001, Mixed (With Industrial) Germany\n\nKMFDM – Naïve, 1990, Industrial, Germany\n\nGodflesh – Street Cleaner, 1989, Mixed (With Industrial) UK\n\nThrobbing Gristle – The Second Annual Report, 1977, Mixed (With Industrial) UK\n\nStabbing Westward – Wither Blister Burn & Peel, 1996, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nFront Line Assembly – Tactical Neural Implant, 1992, Mixed (With Industrial) Canada\n\nFilter – Title Of Record, 1999, Mixed (With Industrial) USA\n\nKilling Joke – Pandemonium, 1994, Mixed (With Industrial & Post Punk) UK\n\nKilling Joke – Killing Joke, 2003, Mixed (With Industrial, Metal & Post Punk) UK\n\nWhite Zombie – Astro-Creep 2000, 1995, Mixed (With Industrial & Groove) USA\n\nRob Zombie – Hellbilly Deluxe, 1998, Mixed (With Industrial, Groove & Nu Metal) USA\n\n***\n\nExtreme and Progressive Metal took large influence from Industrial Music.
