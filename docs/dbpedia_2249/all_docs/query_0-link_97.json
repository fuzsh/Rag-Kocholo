        "text": "Tried and true are Death Angel, being one of the original Bay Area Thrash bands to make Thrash Metal the juggernaut that it is today. “Killing Season” is like a fine tuned Thrash machine that is steam rolling out of control, and that is a compliment! Bravo to these guys for continuing to move forward and make such a legitimate Thrash Metal release. Mark Osegueda is superb at vocals! You have to appreciate that Scott Ian from Anthrax and Brian Posehn lend a hand on gang vocals with Death Angel. The searing guitars, heavy hitting bass and jaw dropping drumming will have you raising your fist in pure uncontrollable excitement. I hope Death Angel knows “Killing Season” is not just a brilliant Thrash Metal statement, it is a Metal masterpiece as well."
