        "text": "Led Zeppelin\n\nLed Zeppelin was made up of guitarist Jimmy Page, vocalist Robert Plant, bassist/multi-instrumentalist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The group is seen by many as one of the most influential groups of all time, and certainly one of the most influential on the development of hard rock and heavy metal. All the musicians had been part of the British Blues Revival, and the importance of blues in their music lasted through their entire career.\n\nJimmy Page was an important session guitarist who became a member of the Yardbirds in 1966 alongside Jeff Beck. The group slowly dwindled until 1968 when Page was the only remaining member and was contractually obligated to fulfill performances for a Scandinavian tour. He contacted Robert Plant, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham to join him for the tour, billed as the “New Yardbirds”. Eventually, the group felt good enough to leave the Yardbirds’ legacy behind them and came up with a new name, Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe group began performing concerts and put together a list of songs that mixed blues classics and heavy blues influenced originals. Early songs such as “Dazed and Confused” feature a descending riff in the bass and distorted guitar. Their first album, Led Zeppelin (1969), features a mixture of heavy, riff-based sound as the core of their music with some traditional blues songs (including two written by Willie Dixon) and even some acoustic music. Robert Plant’s intense, high pitched screaming vocal style was featured on the heavier songs, and his style was enormously influential on heavy metal singers that came after him. In the song “Good Times Bad Times” (Ch. 15 Listening Examples), the use of space within the primary riff during the A section allows gaps where John Bonham provides drum fills. The vocal line follows this sense of space, so that significant chunks of the A section showcase these drum fills. The B section provides the “chorus” where the title is stated, sung via group vocals. This is followed by a brief C section that provides contrast and features Robert Plant singing in an uncharacteristically low vocal register. Formally, the song can be described as ABCB>Guitar Solo>BA(with guitar solo), an interesting and somewhat atypical song form. The guitar work of Jimmy Page during these solos show his blues influence filtered through his distorted amplifier and his high energy, fast, frantic style.\n\nAn instrumental piece for acoustic guitar and written by Jimmy Page called “Black Mountain Side” was included on the album, demonstrating a softer dynamic and representing a blend of American Blues and Folk with Eastern musical styles such as Indian music. The piece uses a non-standard tuning. This tuning is occasionally used by Country blues musicians, but Page evokes atypical rock sounds from this tuning.\n\nOn their second album, Led Zeppelin II (1969), the group continued on the path of heavy, guitar riff-based songs. The influence of the blues is not as apparent on this album though they use elements of classic blues songs in their originals. Unlike the first album, original songs took up almost the entire album. They began to explore acoustic and folk-based sounds in their music on this album in combination with the increasingly heavy sounds. “Ramble On” features an acoustic A section that has a folk/country feel with acoustic guitars and light percussion, though Plant’s vocals become increasingly aggressive as the section goes on. The B section is dynamically contrasting with heavy, distorted guitars, heavy drums, and screaming vocals. A brief C section features a line played by two distorted guitars over the backdrop of the folk-style A section and leads back into another B section. The full form is laid out as follows: ABACBAB.\n\nThe song “Whole Lotta Love” is one of the band’s most popular, featuring an iconic opening riff and sexually suggestive lyrics. It is also the source of some controversy as the band was successfully sued by blues composer Willie Dixon as the song contained elements of a blues written by Dixon called “You Need Love”.\n\nOn Led Zeppelin III (1970) the group began exploring acoustic music to an even greater extent than before. The cover design was innovative and featured a revolving cardboard disc behind the main cover that featured a collage of images. The disc could be rotated and as it rotated a variety of these images would show up in cut out holes in the front cover.\n\nMany of the songs on III were acoustic and featured alongside the band’s heavy songs, making for an eclectic and varied listening experience. Many of these songs were written by Plant and Page at a cottage in the English countryside which likely inspired the acoustic direction that dominates the music. The album opens with the incredibly intense and heavy “Immigrant Song” which features a short, repetitive riff and pounding drums. A vocal howl adds to the intensity of the groove the band has set up. The second song is called “Friends” and introduces the acoustic side of the album. This song uses acoustic guitar as the primary accompaniment (rather than distorted electric guitar) with orchestral strings occasionally providing the melody. It also utilizes a musical scale that is often used in Eastern European and Middle Eastern folk music adding a unique, worldly atmosphere. It is sometimes referred to as the “Gypsy Scale”, and I demonstrate it below (Listening Examples 15.1).\n\nIn the live setting, improvisations were incorporated into their sound, and Robert Plant’s vocals played an important part in these. Page and Plant would often use call and response where they would go back and forth, sometimes imitating one another. See the interesting example below from a concert at Royal Albert Hall in 1970. Also, often in live performance the group would incorporate their acoustic material into sets devoted to the acoustic songs. This created a huge dynamic range and exciting peaks and valleys for the listener.\n\nLed Zeppelin began work on their fourth album, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), and it would turn out to be their most popular and successful album. The album continued to integrate acoustic sounds and a variety of influences, but, compared to III, their hard rock sound returned to its previous dominance. Classic rock songs such as “Black Dog”, “Rock and Roll”, and the stylistically diverse epic “Stairway to Heaven” came from this album. Folk-inspired songs which featured acoustic instruments such as “Going to California” were also featured. The song “Rock and Roll” is a heavy, fast, energetic number that serves as a return to form for the group in a way as it features a variant on the classic 12-bar blues form which was displayed so heavily on their first release. The guitar riffs are seemingly classic blues or early rock, but filtered through Page’s hard rock distorted guitar sound. Lyrically, the line “It’s been a long time since I rock and rolled” harkens back to the band’s roots as well, though the lyrics themselves don’t follow the standard AAB pattern of 12-bar blues.\n\nThe best known song off the album (and one of the most revered compositions in rock history) is “Stairway to Heaven”. The song is an 8 minute epic that runs the band’s stylistic gamut, building slowly and gradually from quiet, folk-based acoustic sounds to heavy, distorted and loud, giving it a wide dynamic range. This form resembles movements from classical works more than standard pop song forms which often feature either one repeating section or two contrasting sections. The music starts as a simple folk-style acoustic guitar melody which serves to accompany a soft vocal melody. The instrumentation includes a choir of recorders (played by John Paul Jones) which evoke a medieval folk music atmosphere. The second section of the music begins around 2:15 when electric piano and electric 12-string guitar join the musical texture. Plant’s voice continues to grow in intensity as the sections build. Finally, the drums and bass join in around 4:20, or just over halfway into the song. Around 5:33, the transition into the final section begins. A guitar solo (completely improvised at that) takes over for the vocals and the music is a simple descending three-chord pattern that repeats underneath the guitar solo. Around 6:45 the music has completely transformed into classic Zeppelin hard rock with Plant’s voice returning in a high-pitched scream. The tempo slows down into a last statement by Plant’s voice unaccompanied by the band singing a line from the first section.\n\nThe group continued touring around the world, selling out practically everywhere they played. The constant touring lasted into 1973 before the band finally took an extended respite from live performance. In 1973 the band released Houses of the Holy, continuing the mixture of styles from their previous albums. John Paul Jones began taking a larger role within the productions, particularly through his use of the Mellotron to emulate the sounds of orchestral instruments. The band was also exploring funk (see “The Crunge” in Ch. 15.1 Listening Examples) and reggae in addition to hard rock, blues, folk, and country. Acoustic instruments are featured alongside as usual, but the hard-edge tone of the electric guitars and drums are retained. This is the sound of a band experimenting without abandoning their roots.\n\nAfter releasing Physical Graffiti in 1975, the band embarked on another tour of the U.S. and Europe before taking another extended break from the rigors of touring, lasting until 1977. Graffiti includes new songs as well as outtakes from albums dating all the way back to the sessions for Led Zeppelin III. The album was very successful and represents a culmination of almost everything the band had done stylistically at that point. The song Kashmir (Ch. 15.1 Listening Examples) blends rock instruments with orchestral strings, and uses two rhythmic patterns simultaneously; the drums play a 4 beat pattern while the instruments play a riff in a 3 beat pattern.\n\nBy 1976, the band began running into problems and setbacks. Plant was injured in a car accident that contributed to the decision to take a break from touring. During the 1977 tour, there were fan riots, fights between promoters and Zeppelin’s crew, Bonham and Page were running into substance abuse problems, and then Plant received news that his young son, Karac, had become ill and died while Plant was on the road. At this point the band cancelled the tour.\n\nThe band released In Through the Out Door in 1978 to mixed reviews and embarked on a short European tour in 1980. Though they were scheduled to perform a North American tour, this never materialized as John Bonham died an alcohol-related death. At this point the band declined to continue as Led Zeppelin. They released one more album consisting mainly of unreleased material, Coda, in 1982 and have reunited a handful of times since. The most notable reunion occurred in 2007 when the group reunited with John Bonham’s son, Jason Bonham, performing on drums. Led Zeppelin remains one of the most popular and influential in popular music."
