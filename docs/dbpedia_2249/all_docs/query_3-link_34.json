        "text": "Death Angel – The Enigma Years 1987-1990 (HNE Recordings)\n\nIn 1983 a bunch of spotty Bay Area kids recorded a tape called Heavy Metal Insanity.\n\nIt did what it said on the tin.\n\nAnd it made a big noise on San Francisco’s underground scene.\n\nIf Death Angel’s early work took its lead from NWOBHM’s heavier hitters then within two years their thrash metal credentials were sealed.\n\nMetallica’s Kirk Hammett — who’d met the band at a record store signing — produced the highly collectible Kill As One demo.\n\nAnd suddenly the Big Four were looking over their shoulders as the new kids on the block made their play for the big leagues.\n\nBut that’s another story.\n\nDeath Angel determined to Kill As One\n\nBack to Kill As One and the three-track showcase of Death Angel’s raw talent is tagged on to the end of The Ultra-Violence in this 4CD collection.\n\nFeaturing the title track, fan favourite Thrashers and The Ultra-Violence, it’s an early glimpse of a band fired up by the fearlessness of youth.\n\nAnd it’s the sound of teenage angst, burning ambition and a keen ear for metal melody all rolled into one.\n\nNo wonder Hammett loved what he heard.\n\nThe Ultra-Violence is ultra special\n\nBy 1987 The Ultra-Violence was a fully-fledged album featuring polished reworkings of the Kill As One songs and killer additions including Evil Priest, Voracious Souls and the magnificent Mistress Of Pain.\n\nAs an exceptionally assured debut it destroyed any lingering doubts that Death Angel might be a flaky flash in the pan.\n\nAnd the decision to produce The Ultra-Violence with sleaze grinder Davy Vain proved inspired.\n\nRetaining Death Angel’s raw aggression, the man helming the band’s Enigma debut nevertheless positioned vocalist Mark Osegueda as a singer far more nuanced than many of his hell-for-leather peers.\n\nJoin Death Angel on a Frolic Through The Park\n\nNo wonder Vain reprised a fruitful partnership in time for 1988’s Frolic Through The Park.\n\nBy now Death Angel were chasing the coat tails of Metallica, Slayer et al and label bosses truly believed album number two would be the game changer.\n\nBut don’t let the fact that it limped into the top 150 of the Billboard charts fool you.\n\nFrolic… is a fully blown thrash metal assault and features some of Death Angel’s finest work in the shape of Why Do You Do This, Shores Of Sin and the outstanding Guilty Of Innocence.\n\nFounder Rob Cavestany’s fusion of breakneck riffs and thought-provoking lyrics outclassed so many of the genre’s lame also-rans.\n\nAnd for a while the frantic Frolic… had Death Angel lording it over Exodus, Testament and Overkill in the race to become thrash’s Fantastic Fifth.\n\nAll seven minutes of Confused represent heavy music at its brain melting best and the live version on disc three is a treat to behold.\n\nDeath Angel live and dangerous\n\nIt’s never a great start when your favourite band complains of feedback on stage barely before a note has been struck.\n\nBut that’s exactly how Death Angel introduce their summer 1988 show at Amsterdam’s Paradiso.\n\nReassuringly, things go from strength to strength after that early misstep.\n\nAnd this fascinating bridge between Frolic… and 1990’s Act III (the band’s first and last record for Geffen) is a must for thrash metal devotees obsessed with the genre’s rapid evolution.\n\nSure, speed is of the essence for Cavestany and co. but Osegueda works tirelessly to hit the high notes at the right time and make a case for measured melody.\n\nAt a time when Metallica were already on the road to the Black album and Anthrax’s rap rock was asking difficult questions of thrash metal’s long-term future, Death Angel were more than capable of reinventing the wheel and reviving the scene.\n\nOf course Act III — surely the band’s most complete and compelling album until 2010’s rousing Relentless Retribution rewrote the rulebook — did just that.\n\nOsegueda’s vocals reached a whole new level and Cavestany combined pacey fretwork within a less familiar trad metal framework.\n\nBut what of the rest of The Enigma Years?\n\nDeath Angel: a rare treat\n\nA comprehensive collection of Death Angel’s formative years comes to a typically bludgeoning conclusion with the reissue of 2005’s Rarities collection.\n\nIt’s easy to imagine The Morrows Memoirs making the cut on Act III and just as difficult to propose a better example of punk-fuelled metal thrashing mayhem than the ‘Garage Recording’ of Frolic Through The Park.\n\nSome of these demos come across as exceptionally silly: Samson would sound embarrassingly out of place on just about any Death Angel album.\n\nBut The Hurt is a fear-inducing barrage of foreboding thrash metal and who knows why this rarely heard classic never made the cut?\n\nWith Death Angel on hiatus for a decade through the 1990s heavy music was somehow weaker.\n\nIn 2020 the band remains a staple of the thinking man’s thrash.\n\nAnd this rewarding insight into their formative years reveals just why those wide-eyed Bay Area kids were built to last."
