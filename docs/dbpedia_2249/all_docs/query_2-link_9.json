        "text": "Here comes another among the old guard of thrash metal that have been on something of a winning streak recently. Alongside Flotsam & Jetsam, Overkill, Testament and many others, the San Franciscans of Death Angel have released a whole slew of great records since reforming in 2001. The good news is that, being probably the youngest of the veteran thrash acts, Death Angel look set to keep headbanging for years to come. 2016’s The Evil Divide was a tour de force of vicious speed metal which seemed to hit every thrash fan’s collective G spot – therefore I was naturally excited about the inevitable conclusion to the trilogy of albums. The Dream Calls For Blood was grand; The Evil Divide was an all-out assault; now what does newbie Humanicide do?\n\nIn reality, not all that much. Generally speaking, this is a messy album with layers missing and a length that drags, despite being shorter than TDCFB. It’s difficult to identify, but there really is a certain X factor that’s absent on Humanicide, making it more of a chore to listen to all the way through. What is certain is that the production quality is noticeably thinner than on the previous opus. Guitars don’t pack as much of a punch, the bass is nowhere near as crunchy, and drums are a tad on the flat side. Thankfully, Osegueda’s voice is still as youthful and sneery as ever. He rules the roost on this album, deftly switching from rough barks to a more melodic tone such as on more sonorous numbers like “Revelation Song”. Speaking of that track, it’s probably one of the more ‘cutting room floor’ songs on the disc – being void of vibrancy and dragging on for far too long.\n\nHumanicide shines on its first three songs. The opening title-track heralds us in with a grandiose intro before slashing our faces with a great thrash riff; “Divine Defector” has a cool mix of extreme irregular groove and extreme speed with some blast-beats here and there and a weird chunky riff under the solo section; then “Aggressor” is an all-out thrash monster with the best riff and shout-along chorus on the record. This is followed by the more punk-influenced “I Came For Blood” – sure, it’s full of attitude and velocity, but the more treble-based riffwork is a step down from the power of the first three songs. After this, the LP gets a little hazy for me. The extended piano outro to “Immortal Behated” is completely unnecessary and has me sleeping before the awesome riff set of “Alive & Screaming” can perk me back up again.\n\n“The Pack” is one of those great mid-paced thrash marches containing a beastly performance from Osegueda. However, the last group of songs really blend into one and my attention completely erodes over their course. Maybe it’s the fact that The Evil Divide made such an impact and hit like a sledgehammer that makes Humanicide feel like a moderate letdown in comparison. The solo sections are all blazing and pretty much flawless; there are some fabulous riffs sprinkled across the whole 48 minutes; Mark’s screams and barks drive the whole momentum…but there’s just a magic element missing that isn’t letting this one gel for me.\n\nUpon first glance I admit I didn't find this latest Death Angel album to be all that appealing. The Humanicide title seems trite and cliche for a thrash disc, and even though the artwork for these three wolf mascots is on point, I thought it also felt a little generic that three of the last four albums they put out had nearly the same artwork, with slight shifts in color scheme and whatever part of the post-apocalypse they were pawing their way through. After popping in the disc, though, most of my worries disappeared, because it turns out this is just another example of the modern Death Angel doing its homework and getting it right. Maybe not as right as on the two albums before it, which it seems to be a hybrid of, but it was generally a good listen with a lot of dense, headbanging and yet another palette of powerful riffs by the Cavestany/Aguilar team that moves in a lockstep you rarely hear outside of bands like classic Artillery.\n\nThis record moves. And it is angry. West Coast thrash metal evolved to incorporate a wide array of influences, between technical thrash and groove metal. Flashy, well-written solos sputter out from the gapless network of energetic rhythm patterns, while the bass and drums keep really damn busy forcing it all into the same concrete lattice of impenetrable power. I will say this album has a higher ratio of forgettable riffs than the two before it, but not for lack of trying, it's just that its particular configurations didn't quite worm their way into my earholes as much. I mean, when you get down to it, while a lot of the material here is very well arranged, it's just not so catchy and feels like a lot of material you've heard from decades of thrash bands, only paraphrased into more punchy cuts. Mark Osegueda's vocals here feel a little more pinched than the last couple discs, and there were also some lines where I thought he sounded so much like Erik A.K. from Flotsam & Jetsam that I had to look up that he hadn't taken over those duties for this album. Weirdly, I think I was more into the drums on this than the last two albums with Will Carroll, perhaps just a dash more potent personality.\n\nThey bring in a few guest soloists like Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom and Jason Suecof of Capharnaum (and recording engineer of many well known records), but I hardly noticed because the band's own guitarists could probably have done with them equal flair. I dug quite a few of the songs, but if I were to pick a few out of a lineup with the three albums before it, they'd have to be \"The Pack\" for its more interesting rhythms and well timed gang shouts, and \"Revelation Song\" because it very much took me by surprise with its huge heavy metal riffs and great, groovy rhythm bridges during the leads. Basically the tunes where they sort of break off from the dextrous clip most of this material is flying past at. But in the end, Humanicide is well in line with Relentless Retribution, The Dream Calls for Blood and The Evil Divide as the most consistent streak the band has ever had in its decades of existence. No, I'm not going to pull this off the rack over \"Evil Priest\" or \"Voracious Souls\", but any of these four albums would sound great through the car speakers when I just want a thrash album that cares about what the fuck it's doing. When this phoenix finally emerged from the creative ashes about a decade ago, it decided it would stay aloft.\n\n-autothrall\n\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n\nApocalyptic imagery and thrash metal have been common bedfellows for about as long as the latter has been in existence, but the concept of a pack of wolves rampaging across the ruined landscape and toting the skulls of rams as helmets is a fairly novel concept. All the same, it is an image that has served one of the Bay Area thrash scene’s early stalwarts, namely Death Angel, quite well since the inception of the current decade with the release of their vertebrae-destroying 6th album Relentless Retribution. Barring their last and equally deadly album The Evil Divide, which opted for a death’s head moth album cover like an outtake from Silence Of The Lambs, the pack of ram-skull adorned canines have been a consistent image that could well be considered the band’s newly adopted mascots, in much the same fashion as Eddie has for Iron Maiden or Vic has for Megadeth, and their latest offering Humanicide pulls no punches in the fang-baring, riff-happy metallic department.\n\nFor the uninitiated into the history of this old guard thrash institution, which traces its roots back to 1982 when thrash metal was just starting to creep into the scene via Metallica and Overkill’s respective punk-infused interpretations of the NWOBHM sound, Death Angel has been one of the star beneficiaries of the old guard wherein the renewed interest in the style of the mid-2000s is concerned. Initially achieving a truly dangerous and ear-piercing niche within the mid-80s Bay Area scene with their killer debut LP The Ultra-Violence, they foundered a bit in the latter period of the style’s ascendency and ultimately succumbed to the poisonous cancer of the grunge takeover, only to come raging back upon their reformation with a sound that has been hearkening more and more to their original, frenetic and riff-crazed format with each successive release, and this time around they’ve hit dangerously close to matching their original foray into greatness 32 years prior.\n\nWhile presented in a modern production gloss that is about as massive and chock full of studio sample-packed punch as any Exodus release since 2004’s Tempo Of The Damned, there is a blatant tendency in the songwriting towards the heavy metal-rooted conservatism that’s been more a staple of bands that have been trying to recapture the older, rustic sound of the 1980s. Proving that old tricks still prove to be the best ones, things come raging out of floodgates with the album’s opener and title song “Humanicide”, which can be best described as a modern thrash emulation of the intro of Judas Priest’s iconic 1982 album Screaming For Vengeance, kicking off on a basic harmonized guitar melody comparable to “The Hellion” and chased by a hyper-speed thrashing reinterpretation of “Electric Eye”. Similarly, this album’s featured speed metal anthem “I Came For Blood” definitely brings a melodic heavy metal on crack meets Motorhead vibe to the table, tempered by a more cutting and high-pitched, yet ultimately gravely and appropriately mean vocal display out of Mark Osegueda.\n\nDull moments are a non-factor on this album, and whether things are going at full speed or creeping in a ballad-like or groovy pace, the musical picture being painted is a balanced one where no instrument is permitted to slouch. Truth be told, there is a sort of late 80s Testament-inspired sense of haunting mysticism meets a thudding modern thrash assault to stylistically mixed offerings like “Aggressor” and “Immortal Behated” that works about as well as the overt neck-destroying wrath of speeders like “Divine Defector” and “Alive and Screaming”. The whole package is a brilliant hybrid of melodic guitar leads and pounding heaviness that runs of the gambit of early west coast influences, though the chief ones continue to be that of Exodus and Testament. Perhaps the lone exception, and arguably the most distinctive offering to be found on here other than the title song and “I Came For Blood”, is the ultra-melodic and diabolical leanings of “Of Rats And Men”, arguably the most memorable song to come out of Death Angel’s arsenal since their reformation.\n\nDespite the revival of the thrash metal brand being an ongoing thing for a little over 15 years, there may yet still be some old guard skeptics who have dismissed pretty much everything released in the style following 1992. It is arguable that this album was made to order in winning over such persons to the current craze, as it reaches back to that vintage sound just enough to avoid either being a full on throwback or a cynical attempt at passing a modern groove metal/metalcore sound as thrash metal (aka Shovel Headed Kill Machine). But for the steadfast thrashers out there who have stuck with it through thick and thin, Humanicide is yet another validation of this sub-genre’s staying power out of a band that has been delivering the goods consistently, albeit while packing even more of a punch. In short, the apocalypse has rarely kicked this much ass, so put on your ram-skull hats and let’s get this Armageddon train rolling!\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonic-perspectives.com)\n\nSay what you will about where San Francisco, California thrashers Death Angel were musically in 1991 as their nearly decade-long transformation from enthusiastic and talented speed metal kids into a thoughtful band of young men on a major label remains an inspiring story that would seem nigh impossible to recreate today. The decade beyond that initial split up a year after their third album, ‘Act III’ (1990), would see a lot of that youthful momentum somewhat squandered within the realm of accessible hard rock. Well, this is a blessing in many respects because unlike most recognizable classic thrash names that’d made it to the majors, Death Angel had experimented with accessible music under a different brand and not sullied their good name. With The Organization and later Swarm under their belts it was only a matter of waiting ’til thrash metal came back into fashion and by chance a tribute to keep Chuck Billy alive and kicking in 2001 was the catalyst for that return. Since 2004 they’ve release six full-lengths of generally high quality and solidified themselves as a consistent arena metal band that’d never stray from pure thrash metal since. On this their fourth full-length in a row with producer Jason Suecof and sixth with Nuclear Blast it’d seem that the roll Death Angel have been on still persists at maximum momentum.\n\nThough I’d concede that ‘The Ultra-Violence’ (1987) is enough of a classic to warrant good vibes towards Death Angel as a ‘legacy’ artist their early run of albums cannot be considered as important for their actual legacy with fans as their run of good will since 2004. Well spoke, intelligent, tirelessly professional, amicably connective with fans, and always a strong stage presence it becomes difficult to find any reason not to respect how well maintained Death Angel have been these last fifteen years. I’m not going to pretend ‘Killing Season’ (2008) was any good, it wasn’t, nor would I suggest that I’d personally bought any of their comeback records beyond ‘The Art of Dying’ (2004) which I still consider one of their best albums. I would say that a fan of old school thrash metal and a modern arena metal fan could find some reasonable compromise in any of their last six records, particularly the signal boost they received since working with Suecof. ‘The Evil Divide’ (2016) was just on the cusp of leaning all the way back to a completely ‘classic’ thrash metal sound and as frustratingly close as it was then today we’re gifted ‘Humanicide’ and album that is easily their most exemplar outing since 2004.\n\nIt might seem like I’d been a longtime fan of this band but honestly I think I was about ten years old (circa ’92-’93ish) when my older brother first showed me his early collection of classic and modern heavy metal records and Death Angel were admittedly a joke to both of us. Why? He had a busted copy of ‘Frolic in the Park’ (1988) and the whole idea of prancing through the park only to have metal swoop in had me rolling on the floor. ‘The Ultra-Violence’ was something to hold onto otherwise but I probably wouldn’t give it a chance until the late 90’s at best. Nostalgia for classic thrash does admittedly attract me to the sonic aesthetic ‘style’ of this record whereas the sound is pretty standard headphone boom that is mixed comfortably loud for the modern Overkill (or perhaps Nevermore) crowd. In terms of fidelity and dry ambiance much of the weight and muscle of the record is given directly to the overblown rhythm guitars. In this sense it is immediately reminiscent of modern arena metal bands but thankfully several of the ten songs within come with an accessible style of thrash metal riffing in hand. “Humanicide” is the centerpiece of the album and we’re given it as quickly as possible, for many this song alone will hold much (or all) of the value to be found on this ninth Death Angel record and surely the song earns it with a tightly wound “Holy Wars… The Punishment Due” riffs and jogging Havok-esque refrains. From that point on there are a couple of ripping thrashers (“Divine Defector”, “Alive and Screaming”) but the rest of the tracklist is a bit all over the place in terms of style with some funk, some arena rock, a near ballad, and a fan anthem rounding out the rest of the listen. Style points aside, the best tracks on ‘Humanicide’ aren’t necessarily the most ripping thrashers so, if you’re just an old school die-hard you’re only going to vibe with about third of the goings-on here.\n\nThe sleepy fade-outs and spiraling basslines of the otherwise punchy “Aggressor” is just left-of-center enough to stand out in the jumbled tracklist. The alt-metal arena stomps and awkward fusion break of “Revelation Song” begins to feel like Flotsam and Jetsam‘s inadvisable ‘Drift’ era experimentation yet breaks up the otherwise fairly uninspired verve of the latter half of the album with some unusual energy. What more or less saves the second half of the album will depend which version you get as the bonus track “The Day I Walked Away”, which I believe was unreleased from the previous album session, is easily one of the strongest pieces on the whole record. The full listen is certainly uneven in hindsight and especially as I picked through each song for closer analysis. As a casual spin it felt more varied and expressive than expected but tracks like “Immortal Behated” really start to grate for their length and style. If you’re not shaken by an overtly accessible thrash metal record in 2019 this is undoubtedly one of the best released in recent memory. As for my own admittedly ‘underground’ and traditional metal leaning taste, I felt ‘Humanicide’ was a heavy and entertaining record that was perhaps self-consciously mixed as loud as possible and it became a bit of a headache to focus on beyond first impressions. I liked what I was hearing with an open mind but the absolute thunder of the record did become tiresome when attempting successive listens.\n\nWithout question ‘Humanicide’ is one of the best records Death Angel have produced since reforming. In building upon the ambitions of the previous album but also amping up the archetypal Bay Area thrash metal approach to rhythm guitar work this ninth record from the band feels energized and right back to their point of origin. Don’t jump into it expecting straight thrash, though. A good mix of their modern arena metal sounds and the intricate sort of heavy metal songwriting the band have become known for makes up at least half of the roughly 45 minute album. Don’t let the heavy first impression overshadow all of the smaller improvements that’ve been made in tweaking their sound across these last four collaborations with Suecof, who continues to be a wise choice. My recommendation for ‘Humanicide’ is mid-to-high depending upon what you’re looking for in an ninth Death Angel album, I went in thinking it was a pure Bay Area thrash record and ended up with a strong modern metal album with nods to the era the band was birthed into. For preview I’d suggest “Humanicide” is the unavoidable anchor for the album with the two tracks after it providing great accompaniment, otherwise I’d point to “Divine Defector” and “Revelation Song” as my personal favorites.\n\nAttribution: https://grizzlybutts.com/2019/05/28/death-angel-humanicide-2019-review/\n\nHere we are with the newest album of the youngest of Bay Area’s giants: Death Angel. Ninth on their discography, this album is the ultimate sound this band has strived to present to the metal scene. It is rich, well-written, well-executed and mindful in all aspects. It doesn’t drag; it doesn’t bore; it is impactful and wide-ranging in its sound, vocally and musically. So far, it is the thrash of the year.\n\nThe journey begins with the title track, Humanicide. Since the first note, you feel the vibe of a thrash odyssey and that builds up to a relentless riff, topped by a scream after which Mark Osegueda delivers his voice full force throughout the track. The riff is a killer and the break is headbanger-friendly and it will be a mosh pit staple for certain. The two solos then are nothing less than absolute classic. What comes next is a thrashy-death jack hammer called Divine Defector. This song is, in one word, INSANE! Especially the way Mark unleashes his voice over the uninhibited, brute force of Will Carroll’s drum and Ted Aguilar and Rob Cavestany’s guitar threads.\n\nAggressor comes next with a touch of prog, followed by the Punk piece I Came for Blood, taking us to the embryonic days of thrash, when the thrashers were elbowing their way out of hardcore punk and into Thrash. In fact, this track is much in the same vein as DA’s first studio album The Ultra-Violence (1987). From raw vigor then we are cast into an alarming atmosphere and for a minute music is replaced with ambience. That is Immortal Behated. Several tempo shifts, perceptible bass work, a solo riff and acoustic guitar and piano outro mark the features of this track and with it Side A draws to a close.\n\nThe first half of the album is a comprehensive package in itself. It is a voyage from the bands early days to what could be the future sound of the band in the years to come. It demonstrations an extensive auditory scope, as well as keeping within the genre; it’s like walking on the frontiers of thrash and overstepping the lines here and there into other realms, yet with a solid charisma we know of the band. What comes on the second side is half characteristic Death Angel and half the band’s experimentation on the borders.\n\nAlive and Screaming is what the band is after all these years. A “self-expression” of DA and an inspiring tale for “those who follow [to] carry on”. The band’s homage to their fans is the next song, taking its title from what they are collectively known as: The Pack. This pair of songs is complementary, and they mirror each other- fast-paced, riff-driven, headbangable, and interactive in nature owing to the catchy singalongs. The same mood carries over to the next on the list, Ghost of Me, with its solos a bit more tremendous (and more “whammied”) and Damien Sisson’s bass more prominent. The classic heavy metal piece, Revelation Song, is a break in the thrashiness of Side B; it is very Teutonic in riffs and structure in general. The closer, Of Rats and Men, parallels the opening track in structure and sound. It portrays another classic thrash work; it is up-tempo and dynamic, filled with robust singing and incorporating a haunting riff. As for the bonus track, not only isn’t it redundant, but it actually adds a nuance to the overall aural experience of the album. The pace is slower, the music is more melodic, the vocals are partly clean and the mix is less packed, so it definitely shouldn’t be skipped.\n\nThe music is top-tier, no doubt, yet the lyrics leave room for improvement. Even though they are tightly fabricated and several unconventional vocabulary items and rhyme patters can be spotted here and there, the majority of the lyrics are rather generic Thrash; Humanicide is about evil, Revelation Song about the evil that humans do, Of Rats and Men about how degenerate people can get and Divine Defector about wars of faiths, only to name a few. However, there is this piece called The Pack, which as I mentioned earlier is a tribute to the fans, that is worthy of praise. Despite having a not-so-uncommon motif, the likes of which we have certainly come across before, this song can feel the fans’ hearts with righteous pride and joy, the same people who adhered to the band and their cause for years and now they got what they deserved. So good job there.\n\nTo sum up, it is indisputably an album to own, to listen to and to show off to those who aren’t a fan of these Thrash gods. The music, including the vocals, leaves you impressed, it sure is repeatable (I have headbanged to it over a dozen times and it is still as good as new; the more I listen to and get to memorize the lyrics, the more I enjoy this experience as a whole) and the whole album is a comprehensive musical pack. It is the undisputed, definitive thrash of 2019.\n\nHighlights: The Pack - Divine Defector – Alive and Screaming - Humanicide - Ghost of Me – Of Rats and Men\n\nRating:\n\nLyrics: 8.5\n\nArtwork: 8.5\n\nMusicianship: 10\n\nVocals: 9.5\n\nOverall: 9.2"
