        "text": "Top 20 Metal Albums of 2023\n\nWe determine the top albums of the year by compiling the scores from each contributor’s top 20 list. The top albums of the year are full albums (no EPs or demos) released in 2023. They are new studio albums for the year, not re-recordings, re-releases, cover songs, or live albums. Below the combined top 20, you will find links to each individual staff member’s personal “best of” lists, which, besides their top albums, contain categories such as best new band, best DVD/Blu-Ray/Stream, best metal book, disappointments of the year, greatest hopes for 2024, personal metal discovery of the year, and various other categories.\n\nOf all the years I’ve been compiling the overall staff list, I think this year is the one where each of our contributors has lists that are very different from each other. There is, of course, some overlap, which allowed us to make a top 20. Usually, it’s easy to make a top 30, but this year, after 20, basically, the list would just be each member’s #1 and #2 picks, even if no one else had them in their lists! So the top 20 does at least reflect the collective opinion of the staff. However, for a full and even more varied list of albums, be sure to see the staff lists below the top 20.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n-EvilG\n\nTop 20\n\n#1. Obituary – Dying Of Everything\n\nReview\n\nFlorida death metal legends Obituary offer returned in 2023 with their 11th album “Dying Of Everything”. The album is equal parts bruising ass kickers, chunky, chuggy, sometimes downright catchy crunchers, and low and slow death march numbers. At its core are the mammoth, mercilessly deliberate riffs and hooks of Trevor Peres and Ken Andrews powered by the thunking drums of Tardy’s brother Donald, a familiar sound that has made Obituary something of an “AC/DC of death metal” over the years, but which continues to resonate – and often crush, as is the case here. Though still instantly and strikingly familiar, the album nevertheless offers subtle twists and turns, with a few more furious gallops, some of the band’s most listener-friendly hooks ever.\n\nObituary could easily justify soldiering on as a legacy act and fall back on the considerable strengths of their landmark first two albums, Slowly We Rot and Cause of Death from 30 years ago. But like some others from back in the day – Obituary still sound energized, relevant and vital, and continue to build momentum instead of merely coasting along.\n\n#2. Overkill – Scorched\n\nReview\n\nStaying true to their thrash roots, yet still innovating, Overkill have come up with an album that puts the “bang” in absolute banger. Overkill have reemerged to bludgeon your ears with their 20th studio album, Scorched, which is the thrash metal album of 2023! Like death and taxes, the one thing you can count on in life is Overkill will release a soul-crushing album, and with Scorched, they have done it again! Overkill was one of the bands leading the charge for thrash metal since the 80s and responsible for penning some of the most enduring thrash metal anthems, including “Hello from the Gutter,” “Rotten to the Core,” “Coma,” and “I Hate,” to name just a few. Going strong for 42 years (directly from Bobby Blitz, who said the band was formed in 1981), they do not show any signs of slowing down; they are an unwavering musical staple to their fans. The band has been wrecking your neck their entire career, and Scorched is pure thrashing brilliance and deserves to be cranked loud – a testament to how these seasoned veterans kick major ass.\n\n#3. Hellripper – Warlocks Grim and Withered Hags\n\nReview\n\nJames McBain is back with another blistering slab of blackened speed metal! Hellripper’s third full length, Warlocks Grim & Withered Hags, is his most ambitious album to date and this ambition paid off.\n\n#4. KK’S Priest – The Sinner Rides Again\n\nFormer Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing’s band KK’s Priest returned in 2023 with their second album “The Sinner Rides Again”. Despite the derivative song titles, the music and vocals of Tim “Ripper” Owens have won over many fans. In the words of KK “this amazing and unique style of music must be preserved for as long as possible and I feel it within me to continue to play my role, as I always have, and to defend this metal genre, which we all know and love.” We’re glad he didn’t hang up his guitar for good and is back playing aggressive heavy metal.\n\n#5. Blackbraid – Blackbraid II\n\nReview\n\nJust over a year before Blackbraid II, the debut album from American black metal project BLACKBRAID I was unleashed upon the world. This unique project was the brainchild of multi-instrumentalist who goes by Sgah’gahsowáh, which is a Mohawk name that means “the witch hawk.” Coming from the Adirondack Mountains in New York, this is an interesting take on Native American inspired folk/black metal. The direction and focus of this project is one of the best to be introduced to black metal in a long time; and it seems to be taking the world by storm. Yeah, this absolutely lives up to the hype!\n\n#6. Sacred Outcry – Towers of Gold\n\nReviews\n\nIn the crowded world of True/Power Metal there are a ton of great bands out there. Sacred Outcry has an enormous buzz if only for one reason; their singer. The new singer is a man known to all True Power Metal people – Daniel Heiman, aka Ethereal Magnanimus, of Lost Horizon. SACRED OUTCRY don’t reinvent the wheel but in a genre known for stability, consistency and a genre where high value is placed on execution above originality, this is a major bonus. Every player is top-notch and of course the crowning glory is the majestic and powerful voice of Heiman. There is a lot of talk about TOWER OF GOLD and ‘album of the year’ in the same sentence by the Power Metal community and the hype and the talk is well deserved.\n\n#7. U.D.O. – Touchdown\n\nReview\n\nFor the delight of the fans, the last two decades has seen U.D.O. outing out a new studio album every two years. On any given day TOUCHDOWN could be your favourite of them. TOUCHDOWN is the bands 18th full-length studio album, an amazing accomplishment by any standard! In pre-releases interviews Udo said that the state of the modern world has inspired him to write a fairly angry, heavy album, and he is not wrong. U.D.O. albums have all been pretty consistent for decades now but this one has just a little more edge. Inexperienced listeners or casual fans probably won’t notice a difference but there is a noticeable uptick in speed and aggression on TOUCHDOWN.\n\n#8. Iron Savior – Firestar\n\nReview\n\nIRON SAVIOR is one of the most consistent bands as far as output. You can play their complete works on shuffle and have hours of killer of metal listening enjoyment. To be this far along in your career and be able to make what is one of the best albums of that career, that is not something done by most bands but they have done just that.\n\n#9. Cannibal Corpse – Chaos Horrific\n\nThe death metal icons CANNIBAL CORPSE released their 16th studio album, Chaos Horrific in 2023. How they keep up the intensity for 35 is one of the mysteries of metal.\n\n#10. Moonlight Sorcery – Horned Lord of the Thorned Castle\n\nReview\n\nFinland’s MOONLIGHT SORCERY formed in 2018 and have released a couple of EPs and a few singles before releasing their debut full length, Horned Lord of the Thorned Castle. If it’s Symphonic/Melodic Black Metal that you seek, then this band should be on your playlist!\n\n#11. Primal Fear – Code Red\n\nThe ever reliable German metallers return with their 14th album CODE RED. Let’s face it, if you like the band, then you no doubt still love their mix of power metal meets riff heavy metal.\n\n#12. Sulphur Aeon – Seven Crowns and Seven Seals\n\nIf you love death metal, it’s highly likely you have heard and love Sulphur Aeon. The German band formed in 2010 and captivated fans quickly. Their 4th album came in 2023.\n\n#13. Immortal – War Against All\n\nNorway’s legendary Immortal returned with their 10th studio album (their second without Abbath) in 2023. The record was composed and performed by Demonaz, featuring some session members, like in earlier recordings.\n\n#14. Beyond The Black – self titled\n\nReleased in early January 2023, at risk of being forgotten by the end of the year, we have an album which stayed in the minds and hearts of enough contributors to get this album into the top list. This German symphonic metal first shot to fame in 2015 and returned with their finest 2023. The self-titled fifth album from the band offers a collection of ten tracks, creating captivating symphonic metal that strikes a balance between vibrancy and melody, with a duration of forty-two minutes.\n\n#15. Crypta – Shades of Sorrow\n\nReview\n\nBrazilian death metalers Crypta some in at number 15 with their second studio album. With ‘Shades of Sorrow,’ the band remains loyal to the distinctive sound initially showcased on their debut album, seamlessly fusing elements of classic and contemporary death metal, enriched by pronounced influences from extreme and black metal.\n\n#16. Prong – State Of Emergency\n\nProng returns stronger than ever in 2023 with the release of their 13th studio album, ‘State of Emergency’. It stands as a resounding comeback for the band, delivering a potent display of East Coast USA aggression enveloped in the perennially stylish and enduring Prong sound.\n\n#17. Metallica – 72 Seasons\n\nReview\n\nMetallica’s 11th album overall, and first in 7 years came in 2023. There is no barrier smashing going on here. Just some good ole heavy metal that does not suck! Metallica presents a solid body of work reminiscent of the latter part of the 80s and early 90s. While most of the album sounds fresh, there are moments of familiarity. It is almost like being excited for a new AC/DC album. It’s their formula, and it works for them. There is no way anyone who says they are a metal fan could say that the latest offering from Metallica sucks. You don’t have to like it, as we all have different tastes.\n\n#18. Night Demon – Outsider\n\nEmerging from Ventura, California, the power trio Night Demon has been sculpting high-quality NWOBHM-influenced traditional metal for well over a decade. Their latest musical endeavor, “Outsider,” exhibits a gracefully orchestrated journey, effortlessly oscillating between somber, slow passages and formidable, heavy moments, all executed with an air of masterful assurance. The album’s rich tapestry of sounds caters to the diverse tastes of heavy metal enthusiasts across various metal sub-genres.\n\n#19. Alcatrazz – Take no Prisoners\n\nReview\n\n#20\n\nAs mentioned in the intro, unlike most years, there wasn’t a huge amount of overlap in the contributors lists. With #20 there was a tie between 7 albums. So rather than make this a top 27, we’ve decided to award to the 20th spot equally to the following albums (in alphabetical order):\n\nBlackflow – Seeds Of Downfall, Culak – Dreamforge, Fifth Angel – When Angels Kill, In Flames – Foregone, Valdrin – Throne of the Lunar Soul, Vocifer – Jurupary, Wayfarer – American Gothic.\n\nStaff Lists"
