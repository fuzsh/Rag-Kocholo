        "text": "Slayer joins forces with special guests Anthrax and Death Angel this fall for a performance in Abbotsford as part of their North American tour.\n\nThe concert takes place at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 20 at Abbotsford Centre. Tickets go on sale Friday, May 13.\n\nFans will hear their favorite Slayer songs from the band's 30-year-plus discography, as well as a few of the newer songs from Repentless, named the Metal Album of the Year by Guitar World.\n\nSlayer and Anthrax stormed through Europe together last fall, amassing a string of sensational live reviews.\n\nThis will be Death Angel’s first tour with Slayer.\n\nTwo-time Grammy winners Slayer have also accumulated numerous gold albums and other awards over the year.\n\nSlayer's founding member, guitarist Jeff Hanneman, passed away in 2013, and Exodus guitarist Gary Holt has been filling in for him since.\n\nPaul Bostaph, who was Slayer's drummer from 1994 to 2001, has rejoined bassist/vocalist Tom Araya and guitarist Kerry King.\n\nIn September 2015, Slayer released Repentless, its 12th studio album, the first without Hanneman and the first with producer Terry Date, to widespread rave reviews and the highest chart debut of the band's career.\n\nThe band also teamed up with director BJ McDonnell for two high-concept music videos for the albums Repentless and You Against You.\n\nAnthrax celebrates its 35th anniversary this year with the release of one of the year's most-anticipated metal/thrash albums, For All Kings.\n\nThe band has sold more than 10 million units and has received multiple gold and platinum certifications, six Grammy nominations and a host of other accolades.\n\nAnthrax helped break down race and genre barriers in 1988 when they collaborated with Public Enemy on Bring The Noise and became a card-carrying member of The Big Four – with Metallica, Slayer and Megadeth – to define the speed/thrash metal genre.\n\nThey were also the first metal band to have their music heard on Mars when NASA played Got The Time to wake up the Mars Rover.\n\nTheir single Breathing Lightning is currently a top-40 track on rock radio.\n\nDeath Angel’s eighth album The Evil Divide is a culmination of almost 30 years of music, starting with their debut album The Ultra-Violence in 1987.\n\nThe classic Frolic Through the Park began to cement their legacy and earned the distinction of landing on the list of the Top 10 Thrash Albums NOT Released by the Big 4.\n\nThe group broke up following 1990’s Act III, but reunited in 2004 on Art of Dying.\n\nTickets for the concert are available at the venue box office, all Ticketmaster outlets, online at ticketmaster.ca and by phone at 1-855-985-5000.\n\nTickets are $49 and $69, plus service fees and charges."
