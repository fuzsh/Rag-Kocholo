        "text": "Tickets\n\nW.A.S.P. Album One Alive 2024 World Tour with Special Death Angel and Unto Others\n\nW.A.S.P.: Few Bands in the history of Rock N’ Roll have ever incited the love, the hate, the raw emotional effect this Band has had on the world. From the very beginning, in the small venues of Los Angeles California, and later to the numerous countries worldwide that banned these Winged Assassins from performing live, the Band’s unique style of Shock and Rock caused Religious organizations, Local City Councils, Parliaments, and the Washington D.C. Senate to hold hearings in an effort to bar this group from selling records and trashing stages everywhere they played.\n\nThe band’s founding member, frontman Blackie Lawless, has led the group as its lead vocalist and primary songwriter since its beginning. His unique brand of visual, social and political comment took the group to worldwide heights and sold millions of records alongside a legacy of sold out shows across the globe for 4 decades.\n\nJoined by bassist Mike Duda and guitarist Doug Blair, whose tenures in the band span 26 and 18 years respectively, along with drummer extraordinaire Aquiles Priester, will take the Band and the Fans back to where it all started. Complete with the stage show extravaganza that many fans never saw live.\n\nDEATH ANGEL: Not every band can live up to a legacy, but every once in a while a group exceeds expectations by pushing boundaries in a genre they’ve helped create. DEATH ANGEL is one such band and with Killing Season they have raised the bar for themselves as well as maybe even creating a new genre most aptly described as “thrash n’ roll”. Among the youngest bands ever to storm the metal genre, DEATH ANGEL have come to be known as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the thriving Bay Area Thrash Metal Scene in the early 1980s."
