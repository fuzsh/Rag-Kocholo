        "text": "When it comes to bands like Radiohead, Led Zeppelin or Red Hot Chili Peppers, people often consider them to be the most influential bands in their respective genres. However, that's not always the case. More often than not, the most famous bands in the world were influenced by some of the least famous. They are influenced by the bands in the underground that aren't afraid to experiment or don't care what others think. Although they may gain a cult following, they never reach the mainstream. These are the bands that drive the music industry forward, always pushing the boundaries, trading creativity for fame.\n\nSee which genre owes its existence to the band Kraftwerk.\n\nUFO Was In The Shadow Of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath\n\nUFO is an English rock band, formed in London in 1968. Over the years, they transitioned from their classic rock beginnings into heavy metal. During their 50-year career, they released 22 studio records as well as numerous other releases. However, they were in the shadow of bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, which led to them only achieving moderate success throughout the 1970s and '80s.\n\nAccording to some, between 1974 and 1978, they produced some of the greatest heavy metal music of the era. This is mostly thanks to guitarist Michael Schenker who left The Scorpions to join the group. Although the group almost disappeared entirely by the end of the 1980s, they still tour today."
