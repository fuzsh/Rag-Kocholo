        "text": "Here is a little thing I wrote about speed and thrash metal. Sorry about the typos. I have yet to proof it.\n\nTHRASH METAL DEFINED\n\nThrash metal is a subgenre of heavy metal that generally is credited to\n\nbands like Metallica, Slayer and Exodus. The origins of thrash metal are\n\ntraced to the early '80s, when a handful of bands began incorporating the\n\nsound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) scene with elements of\n\npunk. Venom, a band who is often mislabeled as black metal, were also one o\n\nthe early bands to combine heavy metal with the speed and edge of punk.\n\nThrash, along with speed metal, are relatively similar in style, but thrash\n\ngenerally is more aggressive, has more dissonant guitar riffs and sometimes\n\nincorporates harsher vocal styles. Because of this thrash is a bit hard to\n\ncategorize. Many bands that were labeled thrash when they began have\n\nexplored other terrains or simply have added other influences to their\n\nsound, making the subgenre even more categorized and hard to describe. From\n\nthrash came death metal, crossover, black metal, groove metal, etc. Some\n\nbands have even incorporated non-metal genres such as classical, jazz and\n\neven rap..\n\nFor the most part, the musical base of thrash is composed of fast paced time\n\nsignatures, fast and sometimes complex guitar riffs, often times layered\n\nwith guitar solos. The speed and pacing of the songs is usually what defines\n\nbasic thrash metal, along with the aggressive vocals and intense drum work.\n\nFrantic bass drum use is also common.\n\nSPEED METAL DEFINED\n\nSpeed metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that is similar to thrash\n\nmetal and has many of the same roots. Speed metal tends to be more melodic\n\nand many times has less harsh vocals, although not always.\n\n'Speed' metal came about several years before thrash in the early 80s. In\n\nthe late 70s and early 80s, there was a wave of bands like Motorhead, Raven\n\nand Savage who had incorporated punk and metal and were considered to be\n\nspeed metal. Also, bands such as Judas Priest, Exciter and Accept are also\n\ncredited with helping start the genre. In a very loose sense, Speed Metal\n\ncan be seen as Heavy Metal played at a much faster pace.\n\nOne of the earliest speed metal songs is arguably Deep Purple's \"Speed King\"\n\n(from the 1970 In Rock LP) or \"Highway Star\", from the 1972 LP Machine Head.\n\nMany consider Helloween's \"Walls of Jerico\" to be one of the defining albums\n\nof the genre. Some other notable bands would be Helstar, Powermad, Agent\n\nSteel and Reverend, who featured ex-Metal Church vocalist David Wayne. Many\n\nbands now incorporate speed metal and mix it with classic metal. Many of\n\nthese bands are now labled power metal. Even in the mid-80's bands who were\n\ngenerally referred to as speed metal would also be called power metal. Such\n\nis the case with Metal Church.\n\nDistinguishing between thrash metal and speed metal is often difficult\n\nbecause often bands cross over to each genre. While Metallica were\n\nconsidered one of the first 'thrash' bands, many consider Metallica to be\n\nspeed metal.\n\nHISTORY OF SPEED AND THRASH METAL\n\nIt is impossible to say exactly when thrash metal began. Some say it began\n\nwith the punk influenced metal of Motorhead, whose self-titled album (1977)\n\nand \"Overkill\" (1979) albums were hugely influencial to many thrash bands.\n\nOthers site Venom's \"Welcome to Hell\" (1981), Raven's \"Rock Until You Drop\"\n\n(1981) or even earlier metal classics\n\nlike Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\" (1975). Venom would be a huge\n\ninfluence on the development of thrash metal as well as black metal and\n\ndeath metal. Still others list Accept's \"Fast as a Shark\" (1982) as one of\n\nthe first true thrash metal songs with it's steady double bass assault. Of\n\ncourse just about any speed or thrash metal band is indebted to Judas Priest\n\nwho gave us such early speed metal classics as \"Tyrant\" (1976) and\n\n\"Exciter\" (1978) . (The seminal version of \"Tyrant\" was later released on\n\n1979's \"Unleashed in the East\" with an uptempo drum delivery and a vicious\n\nguitar sound).\n\nMotörhead's \"Overkill\" LP (1979) would give the name to a New York band that\n\nwould write what some consider the first thrash metal song in 1981, \"Unleash\n\nthe Beast Within\". Also the short-lived Southern California garage band\n\nLeather Charm would write \"Hit the Lights\". Of course, this band would give\n\nway to Metallica with guitarist/vocalist/songwriter James Hetfield, soon\n\njoined by guitarist/songwriter Dave Mustaine. The band Metal Church recorded\n\na few rehearsal tapes in 1980-81, which were similar to the early Metallica,\n\nthough not quite as thrashy. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was offered a\n\nspot in Metal Church in 1980 but then later kicked out again. Also on the\n\nscene at the time packing local clubs in California was a band called\n\nExodus, whose live show would influence another local California band called\n\nDragon Slayer to shorten their name and begin playing faster songs.\n\nThe first thrash metal demo may very well be Metal Church's \"Red Skies\" from\n\nlate 1981. An instrumental demo that combined thrash, speed, and power\n\nmetal. It was soon overshadowed by their October 1982 \"Four Hymns\" demo.\n\nMetallica were second on with their \"Power Metal\" demo (April 1982), then\n\n\"No Life 'til Leather\" (July 1982) and the first with a studio LP (Kill 'Em\n\nAll, July 1983). Their sound was heavily influenced by some of the NWOBHM\n\nbands at the time, especially Motorhead and Diamond Head of which Metallica\n\nwould later pay homage to. The \"No Life 'til Leather\" demo, whose name\n\ninfluenced the name of this site, would also influence a band rising up in\n\nNew York called Anthrax. Of course in the years to follow, Anthrax,\n\nMetallica, Slayer and another band called Megadeth would gain mainstream\n\nsuccess and would be labeled the Big Four of Thrash. Also released in 1982\n\nwas the second album by Canadian metal band Anvil titled \"Metal on Metal\"\n\nwith several songs that leaned in a thrashier direction and would be a huge\n\ninfluence on both the NWOBHM scene as well as the growing thrash and speed\n\nmetal genres.\n\nIn Europe, Artillery recorded a demo in November, 1983. Their \"We Are the\n\nDead\" took a Black Sabbath inspired direction, resulting in a thrash metal\n\nform that was not quite as fast as that of Metallica but had similar riff\n\nideas. Also released in 1993 was the debut album from Canada's Exciter\n\n(\"Heavy Metal Maniac\"). In the U.S., Slayer released their first studio\n\nalbum \"Show No Mercy\". Slayer became a huge influence on the growing thrash\n\nscene in Europe with bands like Sodom, Destruction and Kreator following\n\ntheir example.\n\nThrash metal took off in 1984 or so, with Overkill releasing their second\n\ndemo \"Feel the Fire\", and Slayer's seminal \"Haunting the Chapel\" EP, which\n\nfeatured the song \"Chemical Warfare\" which had a darker and heavier sound.\n\n1984 marked the year that thrash pioneers Exodus finally released a full\n\nlength album titled \"Bonded by Blood\". The following year Slayer's \"Hell\n\nAwaits\" and Overkill's \"Feel the Firew\" would be released and outside of the\n\nU.S., the German band Kreator released their debut album (\"Endless Pain\"),\n\nas did Destruction (\"Sentence of Death \"). That same year Brazilian band\n\nSepultura released their EP \"Bestial Devastation\". Also Megadeth, formed by\n\ncanned Metallica axeman Dave Mustaine, debuted with the release of \"Killing\n\nIs My Business...And Business Is Good!\", another hugely influencial thrash\n\nmetal album. Anthrax's debut \"Fistful of Metal\" was released this year, as\n\nwas Metallica's seminal \"Ride the Lightning,\" which coincidentally also\n\nfeatured co-writing credits by Medgadeth's Dave Mustaine. The fued between\n\nMustaine and his former Metallica bandmates would be one of the most well\n\npublicised fueds in metal history.\n\nIn Germany, Running Wild would release their speed metal debut \"Gates of\n\nPurgatory\" and Grave Digger released their debut \"Heavy Metal Breakdown\".\n\nWhile neither of these could be considered thrash, both we important to the\n\nhistory of speed metal and power metal.\n\nOne big force in presenting new thrash bands to the masses in the early 80's\n\nwere the Metal Massacre albums put out by Metal Blade Records. These albums\n\nwould introduce the world to bands like Metallica, Overkill, Slayer,\n\nAbbatoir, Viovod, Possessed, Nasty Savage, Hirax and Hellhammer.\n\n1985 saw debut releases from Germany's Helloween and Avenger, who would\n\nlater rename themselves Rage. Both bands were important to the ever growing\n\nspeed metal scene. Helloween in particular would go on to influence an\n\nentire movement of European power metal bands. Just like America had their\n\n\"big four\" of thrash, Europe had their \"big four\" of 80's German power metal\n\nwhich included Rage, Helloween, Grave Digger and Running Wild.\n\n1986 was a landmark year for thrash, with some of the greatest thrash albums\n\nof all time being released in this year. Metallica signed to a major label\n\n(Elektra) and put out what many consider to be their finest recording\n\n\"Master of Puppets\". Dark Angel put out \"Darkness Descends\", which is one of\n\nthe heaviest and fastest thrash albums at the time. Slayer's \"Reign in\n\nBlood\" is universally acclaimed as the bands finest, and also German band\n\nKreator released the highly influencial \"Pleasure to Kill\", which set new\n\nstandards for brutality and would be a heavy influence on the death metal\n\ngenre. Megadeth also signed to a major label and released \"Peace Sells...\n\nBut Who's Buying?\", featuring a video that would take off on the new and\n\npopular music video format MTV. Nuclear Assault, featuring an ex-member of\n\nAnthrax debuted with the punkish \"Game Over\". Hobbs' Angel Of Death emerged\n\nfrom Australia, playing a brand of thrash metal drawing heavily on early\n\nSlayer, yet geared towards the European market. Cacaphony released their\n\n\"Speed Metal Symphony\" this same year and featured guitarist Marty Friedman\n\nwho would soon join the ranks of Megadeth.\n\nIn 1987 Anthrax released their renowned \"Among the Living\" album. While\n\nAnthrax's own music, was considerably more melodic than other more\n\nprogressive thrash bands, they were nonetheless labled thrash, as opposed to\n\npunk, probably due to the prevalent punk influence.\n\nThrash metal developed in the mid 1980s to split into many subgenres and\n\ninfluenced a lot of bands like Death and Possessed. Many still argue which\n\nof these two bands were the first death-metal bands. Some bands combined\n\nspeed metal and thrash metal, like the aforementioned Megadeth, and also\n\nHelstar, Testament, and Heathen. Watchtower's Energetic Disassembly (1985)\n\nwas an underground favorite and set new standards in technical, jazzy\n\nsongwriting, as did bands like Coroner and Annihilator, which would lead way\n\nfor technical death metal bands like Atheist and Cynic, as well as later\n\nefforts by the aforementioned Death.\n\nBy 1987 and '88 or so the genre was quite saturated with new bands with\n\nmajor labels like Atlantic and Epic jumping on the thrash metal bandwagaon.\n\nMany classic albums would emerge from this time from bands such Testament\n\nand Vio-lence. Another band out of California would buck the system and\n\npresent a whole new take on thrash metal. Vengeance, later renamed Vengeance\n\nRising, released their first demo in 1987 and soon after the seminal \"Human\n\nSacrifice\" CD which matched the intensity of many of the the already\n\nestablished thrash bands but had lyrics that were based out of the Bible,\n\nrather than the darker lyrics generally associated with the movement.\n\nSeveral bands followed soon after including Believer (\"Extraction from\n\nMortality\" 1989) and Deliverance (1989). Bands like Metallica and Megadeth\n\nbegan expanding their sound. \"Rust in Peace\" (1990) by Megadeth is sometimes\n\nthought to be the band's last classic thrash metal album, and to this day it\n\nis still thought to be one of Megadeth's finest works. Also Metallica\n\nreleased their fourth album \"...And Justice For All\" (1988) , after the\n\ndeath of original bassist Cliff Burton. This album included longer songs,\n\nmore progressive songwriting and what at the time was considered James\n\nHetfields' best guitar riffs. The album also has the bands' first video, the\n\nWorld War 1 themed song, \"One.\"\n\nThe early 90's would see an virtual sea of new bands putting out thrash\n\nmetal with major labels and independent labels alike releasing albums.\n\nLabels like Combat and Roadrunner were known for their roster of thrash\n\nbands, while labels that helped start the scene in the early 80's like\n\nMegaforce were soon snapped up by the majors. Even punk bands like Suicidal\n\nTendencies and D.R.I. had crossed over to a thrash direction. By the\n\nmid-1990's thrash was at a stale mate and many of the popular bands\n\nincluding Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer were moving in different\n\ndirections, while many other bands were forced to quit altogether. Grunge\n\nand alternative became the flavor of the day. Metallica released two albums,\n\nLoad (1996), and Re-Load (1997), that had more rock and alternative songs.\n\nDespite their massive success, many of their core fan base felt the band was\n\nselling out and catering to trends. Anthrax as well, departed with longtime\n\nvocalist Joey Belladonna and released an album that moved away from the\n\nthrash sound with former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush. Megadeth were\n\nalso experimenting with more radio friendly sounds in the late 1990s.\n\nThrash metal has made something of a comeback in the late 1990s. Many bands\n\nlike Overkill and Slayer were still forging on, while some of the bands who\n\nhad given up were reforming and have released new albums. Bands like\n\nKreator, Exodus, Death Angel, Destruction, Sodom and Nuclear Assault have\n\nall seen new releases that are usually critically acclaimed by thrash fans.\n\nEven Megadeth returned with a 'comeback' album, The System Has Failed which\n\nwhile not 'true' thrash, was a hybrid of thrash and power metal."
