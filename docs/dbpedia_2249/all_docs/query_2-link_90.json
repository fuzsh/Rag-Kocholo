        "text": "To The Nameless Dead: A Conversation With Alan Averill\n\nComing at the end of what was either a terrible or fantastic year for metal, depending on your perspective, experimental metal trailblazers Primordial\n\nreleased the fantastic Where Greater Men Have Fallen. The record stands as an achievement not only for the influential band itself but for the fact that extreme music isn’t solely tied to fantastical tales or boneheaded self-imposed escapism from reality. Not that those things are without merit, of course, only that Primordial, and specifically the voice that descants over the music’s power by way of Alan Averill’s stratospheric singing, have given over the strength and command of their music to the dark and catastrophic realities that more and more recently seem to embody the only essence of our present day world. Talking to Averill is unsurprisingly serious business, but it’s also a glimpse into the mind of a musician who holds himself to an unwavering standard of honesty and self-awareness. Alan and I talked at length about this and several other things as well in this special interview feature.\n\nIt’s always a point of curiosity and amazement for me when a band with a long career continues to challenge themselves despite having the easier option of sticking with what’s always worked. What was the mindset for Primordial going into Where Greater Men Have Fallen?\n\nNot really that different from that many of the other ones. I mean, you’re aware that it’s album eight, fundamentally not much has changed. We still rehearse the same way. We still kind of operate like a dysfunctional family. We’re not a rehearse a week, plotting, planning type band. We don’t lay out a strategy. We don’t do anything like that. We start the sole process of writing the songs, and it gets to a place where they’re fifty to seventy percent, and we start to think about the studio. It takes a couple of years between albums because everybody has their own life going on. It’s not a professional band, really. We don’t socialize together, so we might not see each other for months between if we have nothing to do. It doesn’t really exist like a normal functioning band in that respect. It kicks into life when it needs to. We’re under no obligation necessarily to make that happen. It just happens when it happens.\n\nThe one thing that you are conscious of, and I think I was very conscious of, is that heavy metal by and large is a young man’s game, and that most bands make their best albums in their first one, two, or three albums. Trying to replicate the same energy and aggression when you’re forty as when you’re eighteen is very difficult. Thankfully I haven’t managed to lose that sense of rage or anger or having nothing to write about anymore. But we are very conscious of stepping outside of the process, outside of the studio to ask yourself “Is the band still vital sounding? Does it still sound committed? Does it sound like we mean it? Does it sound like we’re as angry and furious as ever? Does it still sound like we’re as full of energy as before?” And that’s why I think bands sound tired, because they set into a groove of comfortable songwriting, or they just run out of things to say. I think because we’re not exactly a typical band, maybe we’ve managed to hopefully hold onto that thing – that X-Factor thing.\n\nYou’re a writer yourself which certainly gives you a perspective on heavy metal culture and the growth that’s happened there over the last several years. There is that cliché that speaks to longevity being this curse of sorts where bands fade from initial greatness into mediocrity or redundancy. I think bands like Primordial offer a counterpoint to that, though. You can still have that rage, regardless of how long you’ve been channeling it through your music.\n\nThe thing about Primordial is that it’s heavy metal in a kind of un-heavy metal way. The blueprint when we started out in the beginning; we weren’t black metal in the orthodox sense, and we weren’t heavy metal in the strict sense. We did have a slightly different take on the structure, the tone, the style, and the objectives were not purely aggression and not purely the riff, the Tipton-Downing style riff. We had other elements where there would be a black metal or even some moments of traditional music, so we never set out ourselves to be the most aggressive, the most this, the most that, the most anything, so we really didn’t have those things to lose in a way like a traditional heavy metal band or black metal band might or death metal. Having said that, we’ve never felt bound or constrained by being a heavy metal band. Primordial is never going to go through an electronic phase, cut our hair, and pretend to listen to Depeche Mode. We’re never gonna get in female vocals, and we’re never going to get into an acoustic album and embarrass ourselves. We’re never going to do those things. For me it was just like Sabbath or something where the band was about the songwriting.\n\nAnd that’s one thing that hamstrings heavy metal is that sense that it’s either feast or famine where you’re either experimenting to compromise your core sense of creative focus or you’re playing it safe. Of course there’s the tired old sentiment concerning authenticity and that sort of bullshit.\n\nI don’t know. I quite admire both. I admire orthodoxy. I admire stubborn ignorance in these matters. I admire sticking to a principle and just saying “No. We don’t wish to evolve.” I mean, I don’t think black metal should evolve one iota. I disagree completely with that idea. If you place other idealistic, moral objectives on it then it ceases to be black metal, and there’s no argument there. My opinion has not evolved in twenty-four years on that, and I’m quite proud of that, and I think that that stubbornness and refusal to acknowledge those things is also admirable. Because heavy metal can often be diluted by these things just like in 1989, I didn’t want to hear funk in my thrash and Sacred Rite could get fucked. No then, no now (laughs), so orthodoxy is very important, but at the same time if I wanted to make an album on my own terms influenced by Johnny Cash, Wovenhand, and Hank Williams, and Waylon Jennings, then I can make a country or Americana album if I want to.\n\nI don’t feel bound by anything, really, but at the same time I can kind of stand and admire both principles, which is the stubborn refusal to change. A band like Solstafir who started out very much with their beaten black metal like us, and now they’re where they are, and it’s a natural progression. It maybe depends on whether it’s forced or not. I don’t know so yes and no is the answer in both a very extreme way is the only way I can respect it. Anything middle ground is just showboating and kind of pointless to me. Because you know the death of thrash metal was when thrash metal bands started wearing Rush t-shirts. I didn’t wanna see that. I wanted Satan, leather, studs, and spikes, Seven Churches, and Pleasure to Kill. I didn’t want 1990s thrash, and that’s why it died because death metal put it out of its misery, and then black metal put death metal out of its misery when it became Hawaiian shorts and MTV. It kind of goes around in cycles. I also love Rush, by the way (laughs).\n\nOkay (laughs). I feel like we can continue the interview if that’s the case. I was gonna ask.\n\nOh, I know (laughs). But I think you have to embrace that traditionalism sometimes I think.\n\nAbsolutely. I think seeing the relationship that extreme music has had with the media evolve over the past few years is a fascinating paradigm shift not only for music but for culture in a strange way. Where do you see heavy metal now juxtaposed against 1987 or 1989.\n\nGenerally it’s awful compared to it (laughs). No, it’s a complicated question on so many levels. In the year 1986, the best bands were the biggest bands, and whether that was Iron Maiden or Priest or Dio but also whether it was Kreator or Megadeth or Slayer. Good bands were generally the biggest bands. You can’t tell me that the biggest bands in hard rock and heavy metal now are the best bands, because that’s just not true. Kids like Volbeats. They like Nightwish. They like Five Finger Death Punch. They like Bullet For My Valentine. They like Motionless in White. They like awful bands, and I’m not just being an old man. By and large, the most popular bands in the mainstream whether it’s drivel like Apocalyptica or whatever the fuck it is with the rubbish violin and cellos. It’s novelty music. It’s novelty this, that, or the other, kids by and large like rubbish. The best music being made without a question of a doubt is within the underground, and within the underground there’s a whole host of really interesting great bands, and there’s a groundswell of people moving towards that. The thing is, you’re not going to find those bands selling a hell of a lot of records. There’s a handful of bands who can exist on their own terms like Behemoth or something and make a great album like The Satanist sort of take on the mainstream, but they’re still probably only selling 100,000 records to X-awful band’s 5 or 600,000 records. Having said that, all of it exists in a microcosm compared to how rock music was twenty-five or thirty years ago.\n\nSadly the last great hurrah of rock music was nü metal, but I think in 2015 we’re living in an era where socially it is a complete victory of pop culture and pop music. Realistically, rock music has very little resonance with young people these days. It more or less means nothing except nostalgia. I mean, AC/DC can sell over ten million copies of Black Ice for example seven or eight years ago, but not a single band who sounded like AC/DC could sell 100,000 records. The Darkness was maybe the last one that sold maybe three or four million records with their debut, but by and large, traditionally themed bands or rock bands I think have no purchase in the modern music industry. It’s all pop music. It’s the ultimate victory of pop music’s sort of pederastic, pedophiliac intentions to sell music designed for prepubescent men and boys and girls to nineteen year olds. Grown adults will listen to music designed for eleven-year-olds and not feel ashamed, and these are the kids that pick on the goth kids at school, whereas when I was thirteen we picked on the kids who had no identity because if you had no identity, you were obviously lacking in something. Popular music has sort of turned society on its head in this way. You’ll see constant stories in the media from old bands saying it’s impossible to tour America, no one shows up, there’s no sales, this, that, or the other.\n\nIt makes me think personally of those most dynamic changes in art and culture coming at the sort of apex of mediocrity with some kind of movement born out of what’s seen as a culture’s self-inflicted unevenness. Do you see the current culture being ripe for that kind of shift in the dynamic or have the variables changed too much?\n\nNo, I don’t see much hope at all really. I think we’re living almost essentially in a socially, culturally artistic ice age where banality and mediocrity have now triumphed as a virtue. You go to the cinema like the one around the corner from me – eight films being advertised outside, five of which are fucking cartoons and not kids going to see cartoons; it’s adults going to see cartoons. Every other film is a fucking superhero movie. I think we’re living in an age where not enough people are just going, “You know what? Get fucked. Stop being a child.” I understand the world is a dark place, and not everyone wants to be reminded of that very often, but I see this in festivals all across Europe. We promote it, we play, we have our fans, and we’re not a small band, but it doesn’t make a difference to me, but I watch kids freaking out to some stupid grindcore with goat masks, and that’s all fine and very well, but if this is what you listen to, then don’t ever think that you can have the same weight of argument as someone like me when it comes to music or art or even the criticism and appraisal of these things because you’ve opted out. You’ve revoked your right to be a floating voter.\n\nI think we’re living in an age where not enough people are told that anymore. It frustrates me that no one takes anything seriously anymore, so in that respect Primordial is deathly serious. There’s not even a percentage that can be open to any interpretation of irony. We’re funny people. We have a great time doing it, but we take it deathly serious, and it has to be, because we have to make it sound against these things. The artistic merit of the things we hold dear are by and large slipping away, and in the mainstream they’re most definitely slipping away. Like I said, it seems like the mental age of the average nineteen-year-old is now stuck about twelve or thirteen. You look at some of the popular music that shaped teenagers in the 1980s where there was The Smiths or The Cure, or whether it was early Joy Division or New Order – I mean, I knew kids who were thirteen and Crass was their gospel. This influenced them to go and get into whether it was anarcho-veganism or anti this, that, and the other, and now I meet nineteen year olds who come up to me when I’m DJing sometimes, and they listen to One Direction, and it’s like “Really? You’re listening to music for twelve-year-old girls?” And the answer has to be “Get fucked. No.” Obviously this has nothing to do with me, essentially, because I just don’t listen to music like this.\n\nI think it’s also important to note that there aren’t cool parents anymore. If you’re in your early twenties now and you have kids, you’re kids are growing up probably listening to whatever music you were listening to five or ten years ago which is probably rubbish, whereas I grew up listening to Chuck Berry, The Rolling Stones, Fairport Convention – these are the records I heard. If you’re gonna grow up now and you’re gonna hear Katy Perry or something then no wonder you’re kids are gonna grow up with no taste. I also think unfortunately that when you’re driving around and you’re in America, and you listen to American rock radio, it’s so nostalgia-driven just because there aren’t any really big heavy metal or hard rock bands anymore. I don’t blame it in some respects, but it is very difficult to break through that veil.\n\nCultural heritage is something that’s obviously very important to you and what Primordial accomplishes, however subtly, with its music. It’s something that in some respects is lost on American audiences simply because so many of us have trouble rooting ourselves to a cultural identity that’s a sort of homebase, if that makes sense. In my mind it kind of drives a myth of self-actualization for American culture where the identity is a myth or, worse yet, an appropriation of another culture.\n\nPersonally I’d be far more into Johnny Cash than I would be into Irish traditional music. I don’t like Irish traditional music. I’d rather listen to Hank Williams, to be honest. I find the influence of 50s American music, whether it’s the blues or country music, has been far more important to me than Irish traditional music, which is generally a tourist trap for me in Ireland. I’m just not interested in that. I think perhaps what you’re speaking to, though, is the romantic connection between Ireland and this Celtic-folk sort of thing that’s very vague and odd thing, and nobody’s really sure how to put their finger on it, but it’s what makes Ireland a sort of attractive place that people haven’t visited yet (laughs). So many people, their heritage traditionally comes from here, but the thing about Primordial is that it’s fact and not fiction, so when we sing for example “The Coffin Ships,” it’s an actual thing that happened. For people who don’t read the lyrics, they feel the songs are about mythology and folklore, but there’s none that are about that. There are maybe two or three that are written on those terms, but it’s supposed to be an allegorical tale, which has some modern purchase so people can see something modern in those old tales. Those have never been of interest to me. There’s more Primordial lyrics about the formation of nations and states after the First World War than there is about anything like that. It’s a complicated answer, but I think that probably American music in the 20th Century has been more important for most Europeans.\n\nSpeaking of your lyrics, there is that very pointed discussion about those historical and current contexts. Specifically with Where Greater Men Have Fallen there’s an incredibly broad sense of that. Do you find that your criticism and misanthropy regarding our current world culture is something that informed this album perhaps more than in any previous Primordial releases?\n\nYeah, I think it’s a dark record. It’s got a lot of grim subject matter. The last one Redemption at the Puritan’s Hand was a little bit looking inward. It was a little bit about the structures of faith that we surround ourselves with to deal with death and mortality. This one was sort of looking outward, and when I started writing the lyrics I told them that I wasn’t gonna have a general theme for this, but it definitely seemed to me that a hundred years on from the First Great War from 1914-2014, I looked at the hundred years between that to examine where we’d come as a people. I started in this kind of strange place in the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893 or 1894 with just this bizarre building of a city within a city, and I was just fascinated by it and also by the principle that all these countries in the world were invited to display their technological/industrial/scientific advancements. I traced that to the First World War, so what I was looking at was the concept that at the end of the 19th Century, people were looking at the 20th Century as the great era of promise and perhaps as the golden age of man, and in that 20th Century we just ushered in a century of slaughter. We split the atom. We sent millions and millions to their deaths, and that relative era of prosperity, at least in Europe at the end of the 1990s, and with the Balkan Conflict, and Rwanda notwithstanding, the European model seemed to be working on some level, and now that’s kind of fallen apart, and so now we have IS a mile from the Turkish border, 60,000 Europeans joining their ranks which is more than most country’s standing army.\n\nWe’re looking at everything from Charlie Hebdo which hadn’t happened at the time to the Arab Spring to a very, very dark future for the world, and so the album reflects that. I mean, it’s not all dark. “Wield Lightning to Split the Sun” is deliberately placed last a sort of glimmer of hope, but the overall theme of the album is that someone greater than you has already failed trying to do what you are trying to do, whether that may be love or war or even good intentions of changing the world. It’s kind of admitting that yes, essentially the war is lost from here on, and we’re past the tipping point of no return, and all it is now is about reductionism. I understand that Primordial isn’t for everyone. If you’re a teenager, and you’re more looking for the heavy metal holiday camp festival season every summer and drinking with your mates in the sun, the last thing on your mind is worrying about Islamic fundamentalists killing a dozen journalists in your city and ushering in a new era of economic race war on the streets. It’s not really what you want to think about. But on some level, there’s me in the magazine, and you might be reading it and thinking “It’s happening. It’s coming,” and I fully believe that. No wonder I get tons of letters to all these magazines over here with people saying “Oh, this fucking guy again. Why is he going on again about blah, blah, blah,” and that’s alright if you’re the kind of person who wants to switch off and watch X-Factor and not engage with the world on that level, and that’s what most of the world wants to do.\n\nI mean, even heavy metal is traditionally about escape, which is often the difference between a band like ours and others. It’s just that I think heavy metal became emasculated and lost its teeth. That sense of escape when you sing about fiction as opposed to fact is somewhat difficult for people to fully get behind, and the older I get the worse I get (laughs). I mean, I just watched the video of this fucking Jordanian pilot be burned alive before speaking to you so this is what’s on my mind. I’m not sitting around watching cartoons and playing computer games. That’s just not me.\n\nYou mentioned Chuck Berry a moment ago, and I wanted to dig further into those beginnings for you personally. Where did it all begin as far as your relationship to music as an artist? Was there a specific song or artist that helped spark that creative desire?\n\nI think it was kind of like you’re aware of music as a kid on the radio and stuff, and thankfully being a kid growing up in the 80s you were kind of spoiled by how good pop music was. Pop music wasn’t back then the dirty word that it should be now. But I think somewhere around I’d guess 1983, my dad used to play ZZ Top Eliminator around the house, and I remember that was the first time I’d really connected with rock music, and very shortly after that my uncle got out of the rock he was into and into new wave and stuff and swapped UFO for Gary Numan, but thankfully I just got all of his records and tapes. So at nine or ten I suppose it would’ve been UFO that was my favorite band, which sort of morphed into AC/DC, and very quickly the slippery slope to Priest and Maiden to Megadeth and Possessed and Dark Angel, Venom, Morbid Angel. I suppose around thirteen, which was ’88, it would’ve been the first time seeing bands like Metallica and Slayer, watching James Hetfield and going: “That’s it. I wanna be on the other side of the barrier.”\n\nYou mentioning Priest and Maiden specifically makes me of course think about your own very distinctive vocal style. Do you see Halford and Dickinson as direct or at least partial influences on how you developed your singing voice?\n\nYeah, for sure. Oddly enough, I hadn’t really thought about singing singing until we got to about thirteen or fourteen, but by then it was more that I wanted to be like Bathory Hammerheart or Celtic Frost Into the Pandemonium, Candlemass and also Nemesis, the band before Candlemass. I used to sing along with that when I was around thirteen or fourteen. Oddly enough I also ended up singing with Candlemass last year which was cool. In the beginning it was more the black metal elements like Celtic Frost informing what I was trying to do, and then after a couple of albums I started to realize that I could sing a bit, and then I sort of went back to where I was before that. I began to really up my game, cease to be a hobbyist. The band got bigger, the responsibility got bigger, and I just felt a responsibility to step up to the plate and decide whether I was an average singer doing the best I can, or a little bit better than that, and true enough when I started going back to the Bruce Dickinsons and Blackie Lawless and Paul Rodgers, and all these late 60s and 70s rock singers, and taking a little bit here and there, and then robbing the odd phrasing from David Coverdale (laughs), I found that I could do it better. I also found that by keeping fit I could do it better, so a little bit of confidence and a little bit of faith in your abilities as a musician and trusting your instincts. Because sometimes when you don’t know that much either about the recording process or the songwriting process or the structure of music, every now and again a bad gig will knock your confidence a lot. I just realized that no, I can do this. You may not be Dio, but you can at least be the best whoever or whatever it is that you can be.\n\nThanks to Alan for his time.\n\nPosted in Alan Averillblack metalheavy metalPrimordialinterviews\n\n15 notes\n\nPrev"
