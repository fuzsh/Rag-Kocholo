        "text": "There has recently been some discussion about Megadeth and Anthrax, which makes me think this place is not so metal-phobic as it first seemed. Furthermore, I have just had a quite long (and not a little sweaty) listening session with a couple of Artillery and Destruction albums, so in that spirit, here's a thrash metal thread.\n\nDiscuss whatever you will. Anything goes. Do you like thrash metal? What bands are your favourite? What are your top 10 (20, , 50, 100...) thrash metal albums? Were you around when it was developing and what did you think of it? Any live experiences? Etc.\n\nThose who are less favourable towards this subgenre are also more than welcome to post. I promise that I will not consider any \"anti-\" posts to be threadcraps, no matter how vitriolic, and no attempts will be made to convert anyone who doesn't like thrash metal. I simply want to see the full spectrum of responses. So, do you hate thrash metal? Are you ambivalent towards it? Do you happen to like older, classic heavy metal, but dislike thrash metal? I am especially interested in hearing from people who like heavy metal in general, but not thrash.\n\nOf course, the \"now playing\" posts and discussions about masterings are also welcome.\n\nFor me, the album that introduced me to thrash metal was Ride the Lightning. More precisely, it was a tape dubbed by my best friend's brother, and it didn't even contain all 8 songs. But I remember the first three being there, along with \"Creeping Death\", and that was enough. This was a completely new world for me. The combination of the aggression and the darkness with the precision and the sense of song developing on an epic scale spoke to my 12-year old self who had previously been affected by the theatricality of Queen, the soundscapes of Pink Floyd, the mystical tension of The Doors, and the hardness of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple. Ride the Lightning fulfilled ALL those needs and then some.\n\nSixteen years later, this is my top 10 of thrash metal albums:\n\nMegadeth – Peace Sells… But Who’s Buying?\n\nMetallica – Ride the Lightning\n\nArtillery – Terror Squad\n\nSepultura – Arise\n\nSlayer – Reign in Blood\n\nArtillery – By Inheritance\n\nMegadeth – Rust in Peace\n\nVoivod – War and Pain\n\nDestruction – Live Without Sense\n\nNuclear Assault – Game Over\n\nDiscuss, relax, and enjoy.\n\nYeah, really. What's up with that?!?\n\nWell, all are entitled to their tastes. And there are a lot of metal lovers here for sure.\n\nI'm a definite metalhead, but not so into thrash. Find it can be a little...too much or something, like the newer wave of bands with some guy (or Steve Harris' daughter) hollering in a fake low voice. However, I really appreciate the energy in this sub-genre, both recorded and live. Saw Metallica touring Master of Puppets and Megadeth touring for Peace Sells and much later The System Has Failed. But my favorite thrash show (I don't count recent Metallica as 100% thrash any more) was a 2006-ish Anthrax show. UNBELIEVABLE energy, blowing away the previous time I saw them back when \"I Am The Man\" was out. The \"Thank You\" from stage was answered by a \"NO! THANK YOU!\" screamed by the guy in front of me-to which I thought \"Hell Yeah\" and hollered \"Amen!\"\n\nWell, I'm not sure where you got that impression from. Of all the controversial genres, metal is actually the most respected if not necessarily loved on here. Disco, even punk and especially hip hop get far more hate (though thankfully even that has died down quite a bit recently). It's true that apart from the odd later prog metal band like Opeth and Tool there isn't much discussion beyond the usual traditional metal/NWOBHM/thrash acts mainly centred round the 1970s to early 1990s (Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Judas Priest, Dio, Iron Maiden, Metallica) - there's not many fans of, say, death, black, power, sludge or doom metal as far as I can tell - but on the whole this place has never struck me as metal-phobic.\n\nAnyway, just to add my little contribution (sorry, for once you won't be getting an analytical essay from me, maybe later though ) Metallica are along with Sonic Youth and The Cure my favourite acts of the 1980s, with Ride the Lightning one of my top three 1980s albums. Not so much a fan of Kill 'em All, however - it was groundbreaking and all but compared to what followed feels rather crude and it's too raw and unrelentless, James Hetfield's screaming vocals barely qualify as singing most of the time (this would be rectified from RTL on) and it really needs a ballad or two like Fade to Black to provide much needed contrast.\n\nContrary to many, I love the black album but not without some reservations; I actually really wish they had continued with that style and at the same time kept the quality - one \"sell-out\" album can't be blamed for twenty years of declining inspiration, much though many metal purists, diehard Metallica fans included, like to believe that that album was the beginning of the end. I'd also like to explore more Slayer - based on hearing Reign in Blood and Rust in Peace I think I'd like them quite a bit more than Megadeth, primarily because of the stronger vocals.\n\nI was a major fan of thrash in the 80s. Once I discovered Metallica and Slayer in 1984 I pretty much abandoned mainstream metal (Iron Maiden being one of the exceptions). It was the perfect style of music for an anti-social teenager and basically served the function of therapy. Loved the energy, the agression, the precision required to pull it off.\n\nI did get burnt out on the genre and felt it was starting to chase it's own tail by the time 1989 rolled around, my musical tastes started to evolve and I stopped following it by 1992.\n\nI've regained my appreciation for some of it over the past few years, though a little bit at a time does the trick. I'll probably never get over my Metallica-burnout, just WAY too overplayed for too many years...but Slayer still sounds totally fresh to me.\n\nFavorite bands: Slayer, Coroner, Kreator, Megadeth (up through Rust In Peace), Sepultura, Sodom, Overkill. Celtic Frost and Voivod are two of my favorite bands from that era but I've never really considered them \"thrash\" in the strictest sense. I never really was a big fan of Anthrax but I enjoyed some songs here and there.\n\nYes, you're right, browsing the forum, first as a long-time lurker, and then as a member, I did see a lot of love for classic metal. But I also saw a lot of prejudice, ignorance, and hostility towards more extreme forms of metal, so my intro made a reference to that. I'm glad that the thread is free of that so far, although, as I said, all sorts of responses are welcome, at least on this thread.\n\nI've seen you write about Ride the Lightning before. It is something else entirely, isn't it? As for Slayer, Tom's most melodic vocals, I believe, are to be found on Show No Mercy (which bears a strong NWOBHM influence, and is generally a good entry point for fans of classic heavy metal) and South of Heaven, where the band slowed down significantly and Tom started singing again (in places).\n\nLiked the \"big 4\" (Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer, Megadeth) during my formative years. Kill 'em All, ...And Justice for All, Among the Living are among my favorites.\n\nMetallica: My favorite of the four, and I loved everything they did up until the Black Album- after that I still followed them, but had nowhere near the interest as what the early music was. I still listen to Kill 'em All quite a bit today. Other than the crappy mastering, Death Magnetic was much, much closer to the album I've wanted from them since ...And Justice For All.\n\nAnthrax: I loved Spreading the Disease and Among the Living. State of Euphoria and Persistence of Time were good. My biggest problem with them was with all the changes in the lineup and musical direction.. I can appreciate the changes made more today, but I wasn't big on them without Belladonna.\n\nSlayer: Many of my friends into Slayer were more of the Reign in Blood-era camp- I was not. I thought South of Heaven was more coherent and their best album, and I can still listen to it today.\n\nMegadeth: This was the one case where I liked several of their albums that came after thrash metal's peak moreso than their earlier \"classic\" efforts.\n\nIt was back in 1983 and a Seattle rock station, the mighty KISW had a 1 hour program called \"Metal Shop\" that aired every Wednesday night and it was were I heard \"Phantom Lord\" from Metallica for the first time. Shock and awe. The following weekend I picked up the album and was somewhat astoundished at the price of $15.99(at that time 'Kill 'Em All' was released on the Canadian independent label, Banzai). I was blown away and it had even more of a profound impact on me than Iron Maiden's s/t debut from a few years earlier. Slayer's 'Hell Awaits' took it to the next level but it was 'Reign In Blood' were it was a rapid descent to the 9th. level of hell. Pure power. An maniacal onslaught. Contrary, noxious, ill intentions and crushed the lame, struggling and suffering mainstream music of the mid '80's. Period!\n\nThe Unholy Trinity:\n\nReign In Blood\n\nSouth Of Heaven\n\nSeasons In The Abyss\n\nLike others have mentioned, Thrash was on the slide in the early '90's and Grunge started to rise. I got back into it in 2006 as that was the beginning of a resurgence and last year probably the best three releases were from some of the old guard: Testament, Overkill and Kreator. There doesn't seem to be any newer artist(s) that have picked up the torch. Maybe Vektor?\n\n1. Reign In Blood - Slayer\n\n2. South Of Heaven - Slayer\n\n3. Seasons In The Abyss - Slayer\n\n4. Kill 'Em All - Metallica\n\n5. Master Of Puppets - Metallica\n\n6. By Inheritance - Artillery\n\n7. Darkness Descends - Dark Angel\n\n8. Rust In Peace - Megadeth\n\n9. Dimension Hatross - Voivod\n\n10. No More Color - Coroner\n\n11. None Shall Defy - Infernal Majesty\n\n12. Illusions - Sadus\n\n13. Black Future - Vektor"
