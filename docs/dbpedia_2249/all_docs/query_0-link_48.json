        "text": "Bay Area thrashers DEATH ANGEL are set to enter the studio in a few weeks to begin recording the follow-up to 2019’s “Humanicide” album\n\nDEATH ANGEL are thrash metal legends known for blistering riffs, socially conscious lyrics, and a relentless live show.\n\nThis past Saturday (June 29), DEATH ANGEL drummer Will Carroll posted the following to his Facebook page: “So….I’ll be entering the recording studio in a few weeks to track drums for DEATH ANGEL‘s tenth studio album. It will be my fifth album with the band (seventh if you count the 2 live albums).\n\n“Rob [Cavestany, DEATH ANGEL guitarist] and I have been working our asses off demoing and rehearsing these songs to get them as tight and as well thought out as possible.\n\n“This is the longest preproduction I’ve ever been a part of and the longest for the band since I’ve joined.\n\n“We’ve been jamming to the songs live while listening to the demos (with drums and second guitar taken out) along with a click. It took some getting use to but things are flowing great now.\n\n“This is the most prepared I’ve ever been for a recording.\n\n“These new songs are a wild Thrash Metal ride and beyond.\n\n“Let’s do this.”\n\nDEATH ANGEL vocalist Mark Osegueda also happens to be the featured singer on Kerry King‘s debut solo album, “From Hell I Rise”, which arrived on May 17 via Reigning Phoenix Music.\n\nDEATH ANGEL: Deep Cuts, Live Shows, and a Brush with Mortality\n\nDEATH ANGEL are no strangers to pushing boundaries. In November 2021, they unleashed a live album titled “The Bastard Tracks,” a deep dive into their musical vault. Recorded at their San Francisco hometown gig at The Great American Music Hall, “The Bastard Tracks” served up a feast of rarely and never performed songs, a treat for die-hard fans. This collection was released digitally and on various physical formats including CD, vinyl, and Blu-ray.\n\nBut live shows weren’t the only focus for DEATH ANGEL. In October 2020, they dropped the “Under Pressure” EP, featuring a scorching cover of the QUEEN + David Bowie classic alongside a brand new track, “Faded Remains.” The EP also included acoustic renditions of fan favorites “A Room With A View” and “Revelation Song.” Heavyweight production came courtesy of Max Norman (Ozzy Osbourne, MEGADETH) on the mixing desk and mastering legend Ted Jensen (LAMB OF GOD, MACHINE HEAD) adding the final polish.\n\nSpeaking of legendary, DEATH ANGEL‘s 2019 album “Humanicide” saw them reunite with producer and friend Jason Suecof (DEICIDE, TRIVIUM) for recording and mixing duties. Mastering was entrusted to the esteemed Ted Jensen (SLIPKNOT, PANTERA) who brought the album to life with his signature touch. Artist Brent Elliott White (LAMB OF GOD, MEGADETH) crafted the ominous album artwork, perfectly capturing the intensity of the music within.\n\nDEATH ANGEL‘s journey hasn’t been without its challenges. In March 2020, drummer Will Carroll faced a brush with mortality after contracting COVID-19. He spent nearly two critical weeks on a ventilator, a harrowing experience that put the entire metal scene on edge. Thankfully, Carroll made a full recovery.\n\nOn a brighter note, “Humanicide” garnered DEATH ANGEL their first-ever Grammy nomination in the “Best Metal Performance” category, a testament to their enduring legacy."
