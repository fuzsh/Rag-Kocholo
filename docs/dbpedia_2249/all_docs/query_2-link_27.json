        "text": "..inquiry widening..\n\nBy: Max\n\nI am a beginner guitarist and I have been listening to thrash metal & hardcore for almost all my life. My hears tell me that for example Jeff Hannemann's solos, “often” sound like they have a similar or standard interval to the chord progression, I believe they are not really \"chaotic\" but they fall often in a specific interval that, yes, could sound atonal but is often the same interval that in my humble opinion is thought to be just slightly “dissonant” but not completely atonal because is at often “at the same interval” and the dissonance sounds always the same in many, many songs and riffs, not only from Slayers. I believe that Abhishek was asking not only about that scales to use but about those specific slightly “dissonant” intervals between the root note or the main tonality of the chord progression and the dissonant scale in use that, for me, is often at a specific interval. I would be curious to know if my hearing is wrong or not and if there is or not that custom interval and often, what is it. Characteristics of Slayer solos\n\nBy: Anonymous\n\nIn regard to the type of solos that are typical (and argueably unique in Slayer's stuff, I have seen many misleading suggestions as to what scales Jeff and Kerry play. Many anti slayer guitarists will argue that it is just random crap played fast. Others say they use chromatic scales, while some claim they use phrygian/lochrian/natural minor.\n\nWhile there is some element of truth to all these claims, they all miss one fact; there is no mistaking a Slayer solo, and while many guitarists claim they know the answer to the sound of Slayer's solos, they are at best only half right.\n\nThe secret to the Slayer solo sound is to play major scales over the minor key. Eg: A typical Slayer song in the Key of Eminor/Phrygian/lochrian/chromatic will more than likely have predominantly Emajor/lydian scales used in the solo.\n\nThat's why they sound so fucked up. If you don't believe this, just look at a typical Slayer solo in Tab pro, eg: Angel of Death"
