Regarding the three concerts I posted, this is clearly the best sounding, it's a full set, and the individual behind the video camera did a much better job of capturing the band, as they utilized both tight shots and panoramic views of the stage.\n\n1.

Kill As One 1:26:15-1:32:09\n\nEverything I've uploaded, is essentially what is out there from Death Angel in 1988. The band actually played two shows on 07-09-1988. At the last minute they played the \"Metal Attack Festival\" in Eibergen in the Netherlands, and then played their second show in Amsterdam at the Paradiso later that day. The Paradiso is the infamous show, which was recorded by the bands label at the time, Enigma Records, and released two years later under the title \"Fall From Grace\". The band hadn't given consent to its release, and the quality is generally recognized as barely above that of an audience recorded bootleg.\n\nDeath Angel had been touring Europe for the better part of a month, and playing new songs off of \"Frolic Through The Park\", which most were unfamiliar with at that point, due to a distribution problem gone a muck. Mark Osegueda talks about this in an interview that he did with \"Voices From the Darkside\" a few years ago.\n\nMark: \"It was interesting because that album was supposed to be released simultaneously there and in the states and what had happened, a subsidiary in Europe lost their distribution. So we got out there with no album except for in England with Music For Nations - but outside of England no one had it and it was quite interesting as we did have a set that combined the two albums so it was odd. But some people had bootlegs already of the album so that helped - you know back then people were so voracious for any type of Thrash music all over the world, let alone a San Francisco Thrash band so the crowds were still wonderful, very wonderful.\"\n\nThe summer of 1988, was Death Angel's baptism of Europe, and namely that which were the expansive open air festivals, such as the Roskilde Festival in Denmark and the Kuusrock Festival in Finland. This was Death Angel at the Kuusrock Festival in Oulu, Finland on 07-16-1988. Unfortunately, only a portion of this concert was shot or uploaded. Enjoy what you can get from this time period, because there isn't a whole hell of a lot of classic concert footage of Death Angel out there. Here's an excerpt also from Mark's interview with \"Voices From the Darkside\", as he talks about what it was like playing at those open air festivals for the first time.\n\nMark: \"Oh yeah - both festivals were amazing - as far as Roskilde that was the biggest show DEATH ANGEL had ever played, 75,000 people, it was with STING and INXS, it was mind blowing, I mean it was 1988, we were kids and we just had an amazing time. We got great reviews for the show and it opened a lot of doors for us there in Denmark and it was phenomenal. The Kuusrock fest in Finland too was amazing, we couldn't believe the response we got there. We had never been up there that far north in Finland, it was a two night festival and on the second day it was U.D.O. and DEATH ANGEL along with a bunch of other bands but we were the top two. The day prior included Stevie Ray Vaughn, it was just unbelievable and the crowds were unbelievable, they were chasing us down the streets and stuff, it was amazing! I have fond memories of both.\"\n\n1. Ultra-Violence (Intro Only) 0:00-1:16\n\n2. Mind Rape 1:17-6:27\n\n3. Why You Do This 6:43-12:00\n\n4. Voracious Souls 13:15-19:02\n\n5.

Unfortunately, the audio only comes out of one speaker, but the show is killer. Death Angel were a very hungry band, with a ton of energy on this night. The crowd was raucous this night, as security (or the Bear Patrol as my good friend's brother used to call them) were busy all night fending off various crowd surfers. This was a set that was cut a little short, which had the band racing through their set, due to an unknown 1:00 A.M noise ordinance. Some of the highlights are seeing Gus Pepa's lead work on \"Why You Do This', Mark talking about how utterly disgusting the men's bathroom was at The Channel, Mark goofing on M.T.V. as it pertains to the network maybe showing the band's second video (\"Bored\"), and finally the band trying to get through \"Kill As One\" as the ordinance comes into effect. Maybe it's hyperbole on my part, but I think what separates heavy metal as a genre apart from other genres of music, is what occurs during the song \"Kill As One\". It's a cool moment, as various band members are having their sound shut down by the club, yet those who still have sound trudge on!\n\n1. Mind Rape 0:00-5:36\n\n2. Why You Do This 6:42-12:14\n\n3.

On the one hand, Death Angel was quickly establishing themselves as a force within the genre known as thrash. While on the other hand, the band was a victim of the heavy handedness, which was Geffen records and the band’s management. Naivety within the business model which is the music industry, along with the almost fatal injuries of Andy Galeon in late 1990, derailed what was the youthful energy which had been Death Angel. By 1991 the band was no more. Mark Osegueda literally disappeared from the music industry, and by all accounts was reclusive for the better part of eight years. He switched coasts, and sought out education as his refuge. Rob, Dennis, and Andy would eventually resurface in The Organization. Gus left not only the music industry, but left the country for the Philippines. It’s funny how art imitates life, as the third act is a model often used in writing for what is known as the resolution. For years, it looked like “Act III” was Death Angel’s resolution…\n\nThe opening track “Seemingly Endless Time” begins with waves washing up on the shore line and this feeling of serenity. It’s the calm before the storm effect, which many producers have used as a means to make heavier ~ aggressive albums sound more menacing. Though I’m not a fan of over produced albums, it seems to work here. In that first twenty seconds, the listener is indoctrinated into what Death Angel sounds like with a greater production budget, as Max Norman would take over the helm. The sound is slicker, but the brutality still exists. “Act III” by all accounts is “Frolic through the Park” part II, as elements of funk, punk, and thrash are intertwined to create a sound not found among their contemporaries. Though much of the album is steeped in wonderful vocal harmonies, “Seemingly Endless Time” sets the trend. In a weird way, Death Angel from a metal perspective, are my 5th Dimension, Lady Antebellum, The Spinners, Fleetwood Mac and various Doo-Wop groups, whom I love. From a lyrical standpoint, “Seemingly Endless Time” is hauntingly prophetic, as the band would be no more within a year’s time.\n\nThe second track “Stop” has these wonderful time signature changes, with what I believe is the best chorus on the album, and one of my favorites in all of the thrash metal genre. The backup vocals or harmonies of Death Angel are second to none as well. Mark Osegueda goes from singing to talking in these hushed tones, which always worked so well on these early Death Angel offerings. Even though I still really like him as a vocalist, I enjoyed his vocal approach much more in the earlier days of Death Angel. “Stop” is not only my favorite song on “Act III”, but it’s easily in my top five of their catalog.\n\nThe third track, “Veil of Deception” is a brave two and one half minute number to showcase the real talent of the band. I’m guessing listeners were shocked when the band never stopped playing their acoustics for the electric. Though there were points in “Frolic Through the Park”, especially with songs such as “Open Up”, where the band clearly was going against the grain, “Veil of Deception” is the band embarking on a musical dirge, akin to “Tangerine” by Led Zeppelin, “In Search of the Peace of Mind” by the Scorpions or “Before the Dawn” by Judas Priest. “Veil of Deception” was Rob Cavestany’s earliest foray into the world of acoustics and intelligent lyrical compositions, which would be showcased much later down the road with his 2006 solo effort “Lines On the Road.”\n\nThe importance of the fourth track “The Organization” can’t be overstated enough. It served its purpose on two fronts. It’s not only a great song, but it would become a future band name, but I will get to that in future installments. “The Organization”, like that of “Stop” has these great time signature changes chock- full of wonderful riffs. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Andy Galeon on this song, as not only is he a co-writer on “The Organization”, but his playing is beyond tight. It’s hard to believe this young man was only seventeen when this album was recorded, as he plays like a seasoned veteran throughout “Act III”.\n\nThe fifth track “Discontinued” is a song that could’ve easily shown up on “Frolic Through the Park”. Though there’s no mistaking “Discontinued” as a metal song, it has that all too familiar funk feel, with a little punk mixed in for good measure. Andy and Dennis have their signature writing styles all over this number. “Discontinued” is easily that song where the band goes all over the map. It’s this type of non-formulaic approach that was setting Death Angel apart from their contemporaries.\n\nBefore there was “Nothing Else Matters” or “Return to Serenity”, there was the sixth track on “Act III”, titled “Room With a View”. If “Veil of Deception” didn’t freak out many of the masses, then “Room With a View” did, as any preconceived notions of what this band should sound like were dismissed with this offering. As a nineteen year old listener, I probably fell into the category of lunkhead metal fan, who questioned this type of song. It wouldn’t be until years later where I would finally be able to appreciate the idea of a musician taking their non-metal influences and incorporating that musical dynamic into a song. These musical endeavors by bands such as Death Angel tended to incite a very derisive response from their often dictatorial fan base, who would quickly label that band as sellouts…\n\nAs much as I love Mark Osegueda as the vocalist for Death Angel, Rob Cavestany really does a great job on his limited duties as lead vocalist, as he alternates with Mark on the seventh track “Stagnant”. Once again there is that ever present funk feel, which means Andy Galeon has his signature style all over this tune. This song is so kick ass, because it once again goes all over the place. There’s no formulaic rule to it, it’s just fun! The background vocals ~ harmonies on this song might quite possibly be Death Angel at their best, as I think the chorus so clearly illustrates. “Stagnant” is one of those songs that just gets better with repeated listening’s. If there was a song that I would introduce to a non-thrash metal fan, it very well might be this one.\n\nThe eighth track “Ex-TC” has what I consider one of the most peculiar beginnings, as it sounds like there’s been some sort of editing snafu within the studio and the beginning of the song was chopped off, sort of like the ending to Black Sabbath’s “Hole In the Sky.” Though not a bad song by any means, it doesn’t get repeated listening's like many of the other tracks on this album. “Ex-TC” has that vibe like that of “Stop” and is one of the few songs with a solo from Gus Pepa, as he splits leads with Rob on this particular tune.\n\n“Disturbing the Peace”, the ninth track, sounds like something that might have been a left over from the “Ultra-Violence”. It’s a straight up thrash song, minus the funk influences which can be found throughout this album, though it does have some of that ever present punk vibe to it. It also has a nice thick bass sound from Dennis, which is fairly evident from the get go. Though I like the album version of this song, I think the live version is much more punishing. Unfortunately, this song is rarely played live.\n\nThe tenth and final track “Falling Asleep” also sounds like a song that could have been left over from the “Ultra-Violence” days. For the most part \"Falling Asleep\" delivers, except for the “Rockabye baby” part in the middle of the song. It’s probably one of those shortsighted ideas that Max Norman thought would be cool, which really didn’t work out in the end. Hence, it’s the last song on the album.\n\n....next, life after Death Angel! The Organization\n\nLast edited by metalinmyveins on Tue Aug 18, 2015 9:04 am; edited 1 time in total\n\nFast Forward two years, Death Angel was no more. Here was a band which had established a foothold within the industry and were seemingly going to be the next big thing. But like many circumstances in life, Death Angel were dealt a domino effect of blows, which proved too much to overcome. Had Andy Galeon not been critically injured in late 1990, maybe the band would have persevered and not faded into obscurity. Andy's injuries and Death Angel's label (Geffen) ever growing frustration towards the band not replacing Andy over the short term, signaled the end. You either kowtow to a label and work within the contextual framework of what was probably a really bad deal or you break up. Death Angel chose the latter. Mark Osegueda, fed up with the industry, quit the music business, switched coasts and went to college. Rob, Andy, Dennis and Gus soldiered on and became The Organization, named after the song, which can be found on Act III.\n\nTrack 1: Bottom Dog 0:00 - 5:19\n\nTrack 2: Bringer of Bad Vibes 5:20 - 11:01\n\nTrack 3: Been Nice Knowing You 11:02 - 15:46\n\nTrack 4: 20 Years 15:47 - 18:50\n\nBefore delving into the bands self titled album, I thought it would be cool to hear some early versions of three of those songs which would make it onto their first album. With the departure of Mark Osegueda, Rob Cavestany would assume the vocal duties, though Andy's vocals would prove to be prominent as well, as the two would operate much like that of dual lead guitarists. Track one is \"Bottom Dog\", which is one of my least favorites off their self titled album. I never cared for the over produced track, with all the barking dogs. The demo version at least strips away most of that over produced sound. I much prefer the demo version. Track two is \"Bringer of Bad Vibes\", which would eventually become \"Bringer\". I prefer the original title, as it's a more ominous title. I love both the demo and what was to come on their self titled album. There are certain elements which clearly pave the way for a new sound and then there are signature Death Angel moments, from that of the heavy riffs, to Andy's heavy drum style, to the ripping solo by Rob. This song could have easily been on Act III. The third track is \"Been Nice Knowing You\", which was also a longer titled demo version. On the album it would be \"Been Nice\". This is my favorite track off their self titled, and once again the old Death Angel writing style can be found all over this one. I'm not surprised that two of the three heaviest tracks surfaced on the demo first. Obviously the guys were still in the same head space that they were two years prior. The fourth and final track on the demo was called \"20 Years\". It's easily the most forgettable track. It's not bad, but this tune would be a harbinger of things to come for what would show up on their self titled. This track would not make it onto the next record. I want to say parts of this song were used on the next record though...\n\n...Next 1993's self titled The Organization\n\n1993\n\n1. Free Burning (4:44)\n\n2. Policy (5:50)\n\n3. Lift (3:46)\n\n4. Bringer (4:47)\n\n5. Brainstorm (5:51)\n\n6. Bottom Dog (4:54)\n\n7. Wonder (5:09)\n\n8. Withdrawal (5:22)\n\n9. The Past (5:27)\n\n10. Been Nice (5:36)\n\nThere are some bands that can't pull off a radical sound change, but The Organization did, and they did it very well. Mark Osegueda had by all accounts retired from music, but the original four were still there. All was not lost though, as Rob Cavestany would take over lead vocal duties along with the resonant sounding Andy Galeon, whose vocals could be heard all over this album. I don't even want to call Andy Galeon a backup vocalist, because that would be disingenuous. Many times Rob and Andy's vocals were interchangeable. Like that of \"Frolic Through the Park\" or \"Act III\", harmonizing would be a factor that made them standout from other bands both past and present. The Organization for the most part concentrated on the heavy riff versus that of the breakneck speed riff that would define them on various Death Angel albums. Guitar solos were still part of the make up of the band, but were devoid of all the note cramming, which was a staple in the thrash genre.\n\nThe Organization's self titled album was a blend of Death Angel's earliest days as a four piece, when they idolized being the next Iron Maiden or Accept and what was clearly the new musical rage, alternative rock music. I enjoyed that burgeoning sound of '93 like many others, but looking back, The Organization's music from their self titled album sounded smarter. The Organization should have been much bigger, rather than some obscure footnote from the early 90's, but the band was a poster boy for the pejorative attitude of music fans, critics, and lastly the record companies. Some bands are allowed to be decade busters, but bands like The Organization were not one of them. The tried and true Death Angel fan wanted their band back and the nexus which was your grunge, alternative, Seattle sound community wanted them vanquished.\n\n\"Free Burning\" is track one and is a good lead off track, especially if you're looking to reel in a new listener. Every time I hear the opening riff, I hear Seven Mary Three's \"Cumbersome\". It makes me wonder if the guys from Seven Mary Three heard this riff as well as it's sort of uncanny how similar they are. Like I stated earlier, this song has the blue print of Rob and Andy sharing lead vocal duties, with great harmonizing on the chorus. Andy even shows off his rapping skills at the 2:25 mark.\n\nTrack two \"Policy\" has some really nice solo work over a somber sort of riff to start things off, which carries into a riff like that of \"Free Burning\". The riff at the 3:05 mark hearkens back to something that would have come from a decade earlier, which for myself is the high point of the song. I love how the end of the song reverts back to the very beginning.\n\n\"Lift\" is the third track and has a very jazzy feel to it and is a song where Dennis stands out on bass and Andy on the drums. This song has the distinction of having a horn section, which doesn't take away from the overall heaviness of the song. I love the second half of this song!\n\nTrack four is \"Bringer\" and ranks as one of my favorites on the album. The harmonies sung over the haunting riff create a very dark and moody atmosphere. This is one of those songs that feels like it's a harbinger for something really heavy. It doesn't disappoint! Even though I like the first three songs on this album, \"Bringer\" makes you forget about the first three songs, due to the fact that this is the type of a song that most resembles Death Angel! Andy Galeon handles the lead vocals on this great song.\n\n\"Brainstorm\" is track five and easily my least favorite. It's too damn pedestrian for my liking, especially after what preceded it. It's a bass driven song that doesn't really go anywhere. The guitars do eventually kick in, but are quickly replaced by Dennis' bass once again. The harmonies like the rest of the album are very good, but not enough to save this song. Andy once again has a chance to show of rapping abilities. At least the end of the song has some good lead work.\n\nTrack six is \"Bottom Dog\" and like \"Brainstorm\", it doesn't really go anywhere for myself. Rob's lead work during the initial stages of the song is pretty good. The main problem I have with this song is, it feels like it's going to go somewhere, but then it doesn't deliver, especially during the last third, with the horribly over produced nature of this song. The lyrics are goofy as well. The harmonies are awesome though. That aspect makes me really miss Andy in the current incarnation of Death Angel.\n\n\"Wonder\", which is track seven, is a song that is a precursor to Rob Cavestany's 2007 solo effort \"Lines on the Road\" or at least the first half of the song. The great thing about this album is how these songs are all over the place. The riff at the 2:07 mark is one of the heaviest of the album. This song, though not my favorite, has maybe my favorite solo on the album. This song more than any on the album, always grows on me. Like other songs, the ending is a rehash of its beginnings.\n\nTrack eight is \"Withdrawal\" and is a great instrumental. Like \"Bringer\", this is a song that could have been in the Death Angel catalog. As great as this song is, it has a very over produced middle section. I think this song could do without that, but other than that, this song rules. \"Withdrawal\" has a very abrupt ending like that of Sabbath's \"Hole In the Sky\".\n\n\"The Past\" is track nine and ranks as my second favorite song on the album. I'm a firm believer in heavier songs being bolstered by their acoustic beginnings. The main riff is infectious and is quite possibly my favorite on the album. Rob's solo totally rips on this one as well. This is one heavy damn song!\n\nTrack ten is \"Been Nice\" and it is my favorite tune on the album. Though the song sounds something that was pretty modern for 1993, I love this song for the chorus and the great harmonies. This song was a great way to cap off a really underappreciated album. Normally I think cursing is sort of juvenile on songs, but it works so well on this last tune!\n\n.....1995's Savor the Flavor\n\n1995\n\n1. Savor the Flavor (2:36)\n\n2. So Full of Lies (4:31)\n\n3.

Though I don't dislike the album, it's somewhat laborious to get through. The production on this album sort of sucks, due to Andy Galeon's drum sound being so thin on the majority of the album. 1995 for all intents and purposes was a chasm of musical hell for me. Metal bands were going through an identity crisis, AOR bands which once dominated a decade earlier were all but extinct and pop music was just becoming less and less interesting. During this time and shortly after, the musical climate ushered in the resurrection of the boy band, the pre-pubescent female act who could strike a pose and lip-sync all over the stage, much to the delight of its new simpleton audience. The music from that city in the great Pacific Northwest was running on borrowed time and RAP, which was once somewhat likable and dangerous in the 80's, would become a derivative (hip-hop) of its humbling roots. In many ways, the American public was being served a giant piece of simplicity and devouring it and has done so ever since. There was a cultural paradigm shift going on before our eyes, and the singer songwriter was taking the brunt. I don't think music, as it relates to the masses has ever been the same since. What I thought would have been a short shelf life, regarding what was becoming popular in 1995, has literally staked its claim to this day in 2016.\n\nThe title track \"Savor the Flavor\" kicks things off and is listenable. If you were enjoying music like Seven Mary Three, Gin Blossoms, Better Than Ezra, Silverchair, Collective Soul, then this album would probably speak to you. It's weird that this album didn't get more of a look back in the day, considering the musical elements that were on display.\n\n\"So Full of Lies\" is a song that I gravitate more than many of the others on this album. It has a really nice heavy feel to it, with some nice bass work from Dennis, along with that familiar vocal transition between Rob and Andy. Even though it's not what I would call Death Angel-esque, there are those dynamics in play, especially as it pertains to the opening riff. The difference being, the song settles into something more akin to what was a part of the alternative music scene.\n\nThe third track \"Doomsday Eve\" is another song that I'm surprised that alternative rock scene music fan didn't eat up. The opening riff is basically the blue print guitar sound during that time. What separates it of course from many bands during that day are the Cavestany riffs, which still sound complex, but are not as drawn out like that of your typical lead guitarist from a thrash scene.\n\n\"A Way Today\" is the fourth track and is the first track for me that is sort of a turd. It's a little more bass driven, but that's not the problem. It's just a bad bass line and the song really never goes anyway for me.\n\nThe fifth track, \"A Long Today\" an acoustic number, is boring and bland. I'm all about acoustic music, but this sounds like a b-side from the band Tonic.\n\n\"The Chase\", which is the sixth track, starts off with some promise, especially after the last two tracks, but any of the intensity which could be felt at the beginning, limps its way to the finish line. The chorus is okay, but there just isn't much sustainability in this track. One keeps hoping for more, but it never really delivers.\n\nThe seventh track, \"War 25\" is one of the highlights of the album and bucks the trend of what I felt were a string of weaker tracks. The riff, all though repetitive, is unmistakably catchy. Some times the simplest of chords works well and that is true with this track. Around the 2:33 mark the song moves into a totally different direction. \"War 25\" is one of those songs that hearkens back to what made bands self titled album so appealing.\n\n\"Begin a Life\", the eighth track has a nice opening riff, which is intertwined throughout the song, all the while working off of Rob's vocals, which are more up front along with Dennis bass noodling. The bridge in the song has an enjoyable mellow feel, which accentuates the heavier parts of the song. I wish the song was little bit longer.\n\nThe ninth track, \"The Drought\", is the high point of this album in my humbling opinion. It's the heaviest song on the album and is a very different sounding song. It has a very distorted, punk like vocal to it, with a very punk like riff. Normally I enjoy the dueling vocals of Rob and Andy, but I wish this would have been the time where Andy wasn't involved vocally. The dissonance of this song, is what makes it so great. There's a great raw feeling to \"The Drought\" for the most part, but then it tries to become a little too cute.\n\n\"Insomnia\", the tenth track isn't bad, but I don't like the acoustical interludes that are used throughout the song. Does it make the heavier parts sound even heavier? Without a doubt! I just don't like when bands get gimmicky with their songs and this one just is to an extent.\n\nThe eleventh track, \"Stupid Mood\", sounds like a song from a band that I used to go see in Tempe in 1996, named \"The Stumbles\". This song quite possibly more than any on the album, sounds the most dated to me for this time period. I hate the production on this song, as the bass is much more up front, then that of the guitars. It's as if the band was trying to meet the cliche quota from this time period. It's like, hey guys, is there anyway we can get some of those bass driven goobers, who lap up the alternative rock scene, because they have weak guitar players. The problem with this, Rob and Gus were not only established musicians, but also very talented.\n\n\"By the Time\", is a really nice somber, mellow tune, which has a really nice heavy section in the middle and then reverts back to that somber, mellow feel and it works strangely well for the last tune. It's much better than any of the other slower acoustic numbers. It fades out nicely and wraps up an album, which by all accounts is at least an average listen. It has its moments. Having said that, the next incarnation of former Death Angel members was the bands highest point, known as...\n\n(At the 5:33 mark the band covers Steely Dan's \"Do It Again\")\n\nThe Swarm"
