The piece is accompanied by a nice photograph of the Conservative skills minister and George Osbone ally on a Boris Bike next to London's South Bank skatepark. The magazine insists the framing was not deliberate. But Hancock may want to drop the prime minister a note given a reshuffle is due any moment."
