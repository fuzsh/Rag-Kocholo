        "text": "Matt Hancock is in the I’m a Celebrity jungle: a better compensated version of the role he played as health secretary in the Covid pandemic and his stint in the ducking stool as disgraced Cabinet minister, caught in a passionate office clinch with his suave senior advisor Gina Coladangelo. As his old boss, the former Chancellor George Osborne, confided to friends: “My midlife crisis was better.”\n\nHancock is on the show because of his libidinous extra-office activity and because otherwise, evening telly would not give a toss about upper mid-rank ministers in a declining government. This last point explains why in his first episode last night, Matt was prepared to be covered in bugs and slime.\n\nHe was a toothy, engaging, public-schoolboy-turned-army-officer type – and a bit nicer and more clubbable than most of the viewers probably recall. “Very good skin,” observed Seann Walsh, his comedian co-sufferer (honestly, if you have done a top government job and been accused of messing up the early period of the pandemic, you will take that and feel happy).\n\nAnt and Dec, the show’s ringmasters, mused that it was amazing that a former top minister was “washing creepy crawlies out of his butt-crack”. Given the present economic choices, I am not sure this is the worst option at all.\n\nMatt was “happy to be here” and riffing off Wind in the Willows in his attire as a Mr Toad gilet-clad Uniqlo dude. He’s also quite good at this sort of hokum because (spoiler alert) politicians, even unpopular ones, are quite good at naff TV, because they exceed low expectations.\n\n“My folks ran a small business,” said Matt in the middle of the foliage, for no apparent reason, other than to be mildly human and mid-market Tory. Hancock came across as a driven man – a flawed politician, capable of shaking off marriage to a very devoted wife, to move on to his next life.\n\nThis is also the “tell”: of a figure who does not think that failure is what the media village and political orthodoxy says it is. Encountering the star of the slime-show at a media event recently, I was struck by how unfazed he is about criticism: imagine yourself not giving a toss about the things your family, peers, and colleagues care about – and how liberating that can be. Voters might even remember your name afterwards.\n\n“Why did you come in?” asked Scarlette Douglas, a TV presenter, serving up a clay pigeon to an expert shot. Hancock burbled something about politicians being not what we think they are. True story alert: they are exactly what you think they are.\n\nIt reminded me of David Cameron, Hancock’s first backer, inviting him for a consolatory whisky when his infidelity had been revealed in the embarrassing leak of his affair. The ex-PM expressed his sympathy, and cited the pressures of public life on relationships. “Yeah,” replied Hancock jauntily. ”It’s a mixed picture…”\n\nIn short, this is why Hancock is in the telly-jungle. He believes that a Tory politician, post-Cameron, post-Johnson, post-Brexit, post-Covid, post office grope, post everything, can via the magic of mass TV work his way back to post-defeat Tory politics. He might yet be right. “There are few ways to show that politicians are human beings,” mediated the reprobate. “I need to peel myself back a bit.”\n\n“I am not sure reality TV is the way to do that,” countered Charlene White, a fellow jungler.\n\nThe Bushtucker trial, I can reveal, as a co-suffering panellist at BBC Radio 4’s Moral Maze with Michael Buerk, who endured it, is properly hard. People who did it never shut up about the trauma.\n\n“I can’t believe Matt Hancock is in the jungle,” commented Ant and Dec in the most scripted line of the most scripted mass TV show ever. I can, and so can David Cameron and anyone who knows Matt Hancock – and discerning viewers, so can you.\n\nWe left Matt in the “tentacles of terror”. It’s a mixed picture."
