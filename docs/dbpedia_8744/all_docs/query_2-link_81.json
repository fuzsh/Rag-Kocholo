        "text": "Mr Cameron was said to have described the decision to exclude his employer’s firm, Greensill Capital, from the multibillion-pound scheme as ‘nuts’.\n\nDavid Cameron\n\nPA Archive\n\nSam Blewett10 April 2021\n\nDavid Cameron took scandal-hit financier Lex Greensill for a “private drink” with Health SecretaryMatt Hancock to discuss a payment scheme later rolled out in the NHS\n\nThe Sunday Times also reported that the Treasury reconsidered Mr Greensill’s application for an emergency coronavirus loan after the former prime minister messaged a senior adviser to Boris Johnson.\n\nMr Cameron was said to have described the decision to exclude his employer’s firm, Greensill Capital, from the multibillion-pound scheme as “nuts” and pressed for the Chancellor to reconsider.\n\n“What we need is for Rishi (Sunak) to have a good look at this and ask officials to find a way of making it work,” Mr Cameron wrote last year.\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nPA Wire\n\nThe developments are the latest in a lobbying controversy that has dogged the Conservative former prime minister in recent weeks.\n\nQuestions were mounting over his efforts to secure access for the finance company, which later collapsed putting thousands of UK steelmaking jobs at risk.\n\nMr Greensill was understood to have written to Mr Hancock’s office about the payment scheme in August 2019, copying in NHS England chairman Lord Prior, before the Health Secretary commissioned advice from officials.\n\nAn ally of Mr Hancock confirmed a drink took place between Mr Cameron, the Health Secretary and the Australian financier in October 2019.\n\nMr Greensill’s firm at the time wanted to introduce a flexible scheme to pay doctors and nurses either daily or weekly.\n\nRead More\n\nTransfer news LIVE!

Greensill met all costs themselves.”\n\nMeanwhile, it was understood that Mr Cameron’s message to the Prime Minister’s adviser was forwarded on to the Treasury.\n\nBut it could not be immediately confirmed whether the lobbying did lead to the Treasury reconsidering its move to reject the loan scheme application.\n\nA No 10 spokesman: “Throughout the pandemic, an immense number of businesses contacted Downing Street with representations; these were passed on to relevant departments.”\n\nThis week, it emerged the Chancellor responded to private texts from Mr Cameron saying he had “pushed” officials to consider plans that could have helped Greensill in 2020.\n\nLabour called for Mr Sunak to “come out of hiding” and make a statement to Parliament about the “growing scandal”, and reiterated demands for an investigation.\n\nShadow chief secretary to the treasury Bridget Phillipson said: “Every day brings fresh revelations about the culture of cronyism at the heart of this Conservative Government.\n\n“Through David Cameron, Greensill looks to have had the run of Government from Number 10 down, including access to millions of pounds of public money.”\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
