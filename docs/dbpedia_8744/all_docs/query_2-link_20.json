        "text": "A Cabinet minister has defended two major Tory figures embroiled in separate cronyism scandals against accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nEnvironment secretary George Eustice said former prime minister David Cameron ‘meticulously observed the rules’ and had done no wrong when lobbying for failing finance firm Greensill Capital.\n\nHe also rejected accusations of conflicts of interest against Matt Hancock over the health secretary’s stake in a family company with NHS contracts.\n\nMr Cameron sent texts to Rishi Sunak in April last year which appear to have prompted efforts by the chancellor to grease the wheels for emergency Covid loans sought by Greensill.\n\nThe company was told it did not qualify and eventually collapsed, but Boris Johnson has ordered a formal probe into whether lobbying rules were broken or need to be changed.\n\nAsked about former prime minister’s conduct, Mr Eustice told Sky’s Sophie Ridge On Sunday: ‘Well look, he himself has said that with hindsight it probably would have been better if, rather than texting ministers, if he had instead written letters to set out his views more formally.\n\n‘But I think the real point is. ‘has he done anything wrong?’ Well, on the face of it, no. There’s a review that is going on, we mustn’t prejudge that.\n\nIn a statement last week Mr Cameron accepted that he should have communicated ‘through only the most formal of channels’ and there were ‘important lessons’ to be learned.\n\nMr Eustice denied the former PM ‘took advantage’ of any rules, adding: ‘He meticulously observed the rules there that he himself actually put in place after some concerns around lobbying a decade ago.\n\n‘He put in place these restrictions on what ministers can do for a period of two years.\n\n‘But look, he himself has conceded that with hindsight, if he had his time again, he wouldn’t have texted Rishi Sunak and wouldn’t have texted others – he would instead have written through formal channels.’\n\nMr Hancock was found to have accepted shares in Topwood Limited, an NHS contractor part-owned by his sister, which he declared in March this year.\n\nMr Eustice insisted the health secretary followed the rules when it came to declaring his 15 per cent stake in the company, which specialises in secure storage, scanning and shredding of documents.\n\nThe environment secretary added: ‘The reason we know about this is because Matt Hancock did what all ministers do in this case, which is to declare that interest.\n\n‘And so he did the right thing, he declared that. He had no role whatsoever around that business – so, yes, there is nothing wrong with ministers having financial interests, providing they declare them in the appropriate way.\n\nAsked whether lobbying rules were ‘broken’ if ministers are allowed to hold stakes in companies profiting from their Government department’s contracts, the Cabinet minister replied: ‘I’m not sure I would agree with that.\n\n‘Ministers can move around a lot – famously we tend not to spend too long in one particular role.’\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page."
