        "text": "GB News: Matt Hancock’s lawyer has rant at channel\n\nMatt Hancock will be the latest high-profile politician to appear before the Covid-19 inquiry as hearings continue into Government preparedness for the pandemic.\n\nThe former health secretary, who helped steer the coronavirus response before being forced to quit in June 2021, will give evidence to Lady Hallett’s inquiry today (June 27).\n\nHis attendance at the inquiry comes after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, another former health secretary, admitted that “group-think” helped lead to a “narrowness of thinking” that failed to expand pandemic preparedness beyond planning for a flu outbreak.\n\nFormer deputy chief medical officer Dame Jenny Harries was yesterday quizzed on the capacity of the UK health system as well as the organisational reforms before the Covid outbreak.\n\nMr Hancock became health secretary in mid-2018, but his political career was torpedoed after footage emerged in 2021 of his embrace with aide Gina Coladangelo.\n\nRead more... Hancock terrified of being 'pushed down escalator' by angry anti-vaxxer [LATEST]\n\nHe was central to the Government’s pandemic era decision-making and messaging, with his own recollections of the period likely to be a crucial part of the inquiry.\n\nA leak of more than a 100,000 of his WhatsApp messages by journalist Isabel Oakeshott, many of which were published earlier this year, provided a glimpse into the inner workings of Government during the period.\n\nThe West Suffolk MP, who will stand down at the next general election, has faced questions in the past about the policy on Covid testing and nursing homes.\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron, former chancellor George Osborne and chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty are all among those who have appeared before the committee so far.\n\nMeanwhile, a former parliamentary private secretary to Mr Hancock has apologised for attending an event in Parliament while Covid restrictions were still in place.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I attended the event briefly, I did not drink and I did not celebrate my birthday. I went home shortly after to be with my family.\n\n“I apologise unreservedly for a momentary error of judgment in attending the event.”"
