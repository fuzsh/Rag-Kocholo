        "text": "Isabel Oakeshott has admitted she didn't tell Matt Hancock she was going to leak 100,000 of his WhatsApp messages before sharing them with the Daily Telegraph.\n\nThe Brexiteer journalist and political commentator has passed on more than 2.3 million words from exchanges the former health secretary and his colleagues had about COVID policy at the height of the pandemic.\n\nHer leak broke the non-disclosure agreement she signed that promised she would only use the messages on background to ghost write Mr Hancock's book, Pandemic Diaries.\n\nShe has vehemently defended her decision, which she claims is \"overwhelmingly\" in the public interest - as she believes the inquiry into the government response to the pandemic will take far too long to achieve genuine justice.\n\nBut her reported breach of contract has led to criticism from Conservative MPs and journalists - particularly in light of other controversies she has been involved in.\n\nFrom King Charles's school to political journalist\n\nMs Oakeshott was born in Westminster in the mid-1970s before moving to Scotland.\n\nShe attended fee-paying schools St George's in Edinburgh and Gordonstoun in Moray - where both King Charles and his father the Duke of Edinburgh went.\n\nAfter graduating with a history degree from the University of Bristol she moved back to Scotland to begin her journalism career in local newspapers.\n\nIn the early 2000s she moved to London to be the Evening Standard's health correspondent.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe key WhatsApp exchanges\n\nAnalysis: explosive message lay COVID policy bare\n\nThree years later she took her first steps into political journalism and joined the Sunday Times, where in 2010 she was made political editor and in 2011 she was named Political Journalist of the Year at the Press Awards.\n\nA year-long stint as the Daily Mail's political editor-at-large followed before jobs at GB News presenting her show The Briefing with Isabel Oakeshott in 2021 and as TalkTV's international editor from mid-2022.\n\nShe has three children and was previously married to the American Nigel Rosser. She has since been in a long-term relationship with Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party.\n\nMatt Hancock's book is the 10th she has worked on.\n\nMP imprisoned and ambassador forced to resign\n\nFollowing the publication of The Lockdown Files in The Telegraph, Mr Hancock accused Ms Oakeshott of a \"massive betrayal and breach of trust\".\n\nBut many of his former Tory colleagues have questioned his decision to entrust her with the archive - even with legal protection.\n\nWhat is an NDA?\n\nIn 2011 when she was working at The Sunday Times she agreed to write a story about Vicky Pryce - the ex-wife of former Liberal Democrat minister Chris Huhne, who Ms Pryce had separated from following an affair.\n\nMs Pryce told Ms Oakeshott she had taken points on her driving licence for a speeding offence Mr Huhne committed.\n\nShe discussed with Ms Oakeshott over email how they might report the story to discredit Mr Huhne.\n\nBut the front-page article that materialised led to the Crown Prosecution Service revisiting the incident, requesting the email exchanges, and ultimately both Ms Pryce and Mr Huhne being sentenced to eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice.\n\nIn 2015 she co-authored a biography of then-prime minister David Cameron with the Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft.\n\nHe had felt let down by Mr Cameron, having donated millions to the 2015 election campaign only to be denied a top job in his coalition government.\n\nThe book, Call Me Dave, failed to have major success and was largely remembered for the claim Mr Cameron engaged in a sex act with a dead pig while at Oxford University.\n\nHe fiercely denied it and Ms Oakeshott later admitted she only had one source to back the allegation up.\n\n\"It's my judgment that the MP was not making it up, although I accept there was a possibility he could have been slightly deranged,\" she told a book festival audience.\n\nAs an ardent Brexiteer, in 2016 she helped write Arron Banks's book The Bad Boys of Brexit on his account of the EU referendum.\n\nThe Leave.EU founder gave her his texts and emails from the time, which Ms Oakeshott later published in the Sunday Times, revealing he had far more dealings with Russian officials than he had previously admitted.\n\nThree years later in 2019 she wrote a series of articles in the Mail on Sunday that revealed the UK ambassador to the United States Sir Kim Darroch had described Donald Trump's presidency as \"inept\" and \"utterly dysfunctional\".\n\nHe was forced to resign, conceding his position had become untenable.\n\nBut following the saga there were claims the story had not been hers - and instead the work of a teenage freelance journalist called Steven Edginton - who was involved with the Brexit Party and had wanted to stay anonymous to avoid any repercussions.\n\nHancock and Oakeshott have 'absolutely nothing in common'\n\nDuring the pandemic, she quickly declared herself a lockdown-sceptic, claiming that outside of clinical environments face masks are merely \"political\" and \"nothing to do with genuine infection control\".\n\nAfter Mr Hancock's lockdown-breaking affair with aide Gina Coladangelo forced him to resign, Ms Oakeshott worked with him on his memoir for a year.\n\nShe has claimed she wasn't paid for her work, saying it was \"richly rewarding in other ways\".\n\nBut soon after its publication in December last year, Ms Oakeshott wrote a piece for The Spectator alluding to her motives in co-authoring the book.\n\nIn it she admitted the pair have \"almost nothing in common\" and that they \"fundamentally disagree\" over how COVID should have been dealt with.\n\n'I broke NDA, but it wasn't personal'\n\nShe hinted: \"Journalists don't only interrogate people they disagree with. Quite the reverse.\n\n\"What better way to find out what really happenedâ€¦ than to align myself with the key player?\"\n\nMr Hancock says his leaked messages have been \"spun to fit an anti-lockdown agenda\" and denies he \"ignored\" advice to test all people entering care homes in England.\n\nWhen asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if Ms Oakeshott warned the former minister about her plans to leak the messages, she said: \"I didn't tell him.\"\n\nShe added in a statement: \"Hard though it may be for him to believe, this isn't about Matt Hancock, or indeed any other individual politician. Nor is it about me.\n\n\"We were all let down by the response to the pandemic and repeated unnecessary lockdowns.\n\n\"I make no apology whatsoever for acting in the national interest: the worst betrayal of all would be to cover up these truths.\""
