        "text": "Back in 2010, when he was still leader of the Opposition, David Cameron warned political lobbying and the lack of transparency around it was going to be one of the next big scandals to come out of Westminster.\n\nMr Cameron predicted correctly, although he probably didn’t imagine it would be he at the centre of such a scandal.\n\nNevertheless, the row over the access financier Lex Greensill had to the highest levels of Government – through Mr Cameron – and concerns over the blurred lines between private companies and public policy have been escalating over recent weeks, leaving many questions unanswered.\n\nHere’s how the scandal unfolded.\n\n2010\n\nDavid Cameron, then the leader of the Conservative Party, gives a major election campaign speech titled ‘Rebuilding Trust in Politics’.\n\nIn it he warned ministerial lobbying would follow in the shadow of the 2009 expenses row and become the next scandal to corrode public faith in politicians.\n\nHe said the issue of “secret corporate lobbying” had “tainted our politics for too long”, and, through “the quiet word in your ear, the ex-ministers and ex-advisors for hire”, it had exposed “the far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money”.\n\nHe said his party “believe[d] in competition, not cronyism”, and argued the Conservatives would “be the party that sorts all this out”.\n\n2011\n\nLex Greensill was brought in to work with the Government by the former Cabinet Secretary, Jeremy Heywood.\n\nUnder Mr Cameron’s premiership he continued to work as an unpaid advisor.\n\nHe promoted his scheme to encourage large companies to use supply chain finance (SCF) to enable their suppliers to access low cost credit. It was then adopted by NHS trusts.\n\n2012\n\nGreensill had initially worked on supply-chain finance, which allows businesses to pay off debts quickly through Citibank, but the firm worked independently from 2012.\n\n2018\n\nTwo years after resigning as Prime Minister (which is the amount of time passed during which the regulator cannot intervene in an appointment), Mr Cameron is appointed as an adviser to Greensill Capital.\n\n2019\n\nLex Greensill wrote to Matt Hancock’s office about using the payment scheme in the NHS. The pair later met for a drink.\n\n2020\n\nMr Cameron contacted Chancellor Rishi Sunak, as well as two other Treasury ministers, asking for Greensill to get the largest possible Government-backed Covid loans on offer through the Covid corporate financing facility (CCFF).\n\nGreensill was refused access to the CCFF, but it was accepted as an accredited lender on the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS), which allowed it to offer government-backed loans of up to £50m.\n\nMarch 2021\n\nSwiss banks closed funds linked to the business over concerns about its true value, plunging the firm into crisis.\n\nGreensill sought insolvency protection in Australia and a rescue deal.\n\nIn the same month, the Financial Times reported it had attempted to contact Mr Cameron for a comment regarding the company’s ties to the Government.\n\nOn 8 March, Greensill Capital filed for administration. Steelmaker Liberty, which is backed by Greensill, paused production.\n\n19 March 2021\n\nIt is reported that Mr Cameron lobbied senior Government officials to give Greensill Capital special access to the largest Covid loans just months before the lender collapsed.\n\n21 March 2021\n\nAnother report in The Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron text Mr Sunak back in 2020 in the hope of gaining Greensill access to the Government-backed loans.\n\n25 March 2021\n\nFormal investigation launched into whether Mr Cameron broke lobbying rules by the registrar of consultant lobbyists. He is cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n30 March 2021\n\nA business card emerged that appeared to confirm that Lex Greensill had a role at the heart of Downing Street, prompting Labour to renew its calls for a full investigation into Cameron’s role.\n\n2 April 2021\n\ni revealed that more than 60 members of Mr Cameron’s administration have taken up private-sector jobs with some link to their Government portfolio within two years of stepping down.\n\nThis prompted further questions as to the “revolving door” of politics and leads to calls for reform of the regulator, Acoba.\n\n4 April 2021\n\nLabour called for changes to lobbying laws and demanded the register of lobbyists is extended to include in-house advisors.\n\n8 April 2021\n\nThe Treasury released messages sent by Mr Sunak to Mr Cameron in which he said he had “pushed the team” to find a way for Greensill to gain access to the loans.\n\n11 April 2021\n\nMr Cameron published a detailed statement on the issue in which he denied breaking the rules but conceded he had reflected on his conduct and that “important lessons” would be learned.\n\n12 April 2021\n\nCabinet Office announced an inquiry into Greensill lobbying, which is to be led by the legal expert Nigel Boardman.\n\n13 April 2021\n\nLord Pickles, chair of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), revealed in a letter to the Cabinet Office that a senior civil servant was given permission to advise Greensill Capital while still being paid in a Government role.\n\nChief commercial officer Bill Crothers was also allowed to advise Greensill part-time while on the public payroll in 2015.\n\n14 April 2021\n\nLabour tried to force a motion which would require the establishment of a specific parliamentary committee to lead the probe into Greensill lobbying amid concerns the Broadman review would not be independent enough. It was voted down by Tories in the Commons.\n\nMeanwhile the Treasury Select Committee announced its own probe.\n\nThe Cabinet Office called on all departments to reveal details of staff with second jobs.\n\n15 April 2021\n\ni revealed a senior member of the independent lobbying regulator runs his own firm advertising his access to ministers at the highest echelons of power.\n\nAndrew Cumpsty sits on Acoba, which monitors appointments of former ministers and civil servants, and runs a communications company and a business lobby group that boasts of its connections to ministers and Conservative Cabinet members.\n\nLord Pickles, Chair of Acoba, defended the decision to MPs. However, he added that the recent revelations suggest there have been “no boundaries at all” in the heart of Whitehall.\n\nThe Public Administration and Constitutional Affiairs Committee and the Public Accounts Committee both announced their own probes into the row."
