        "text": "It has emerged that Mr Cameron took Mr Greensill for a “private drink” with Mr Hancock to discuss a payment scheme later rolled out in the NHS.\n\nThe Sunday Times also reported that the Treasury reconsidered Mr Greensill’s application for an emergency coronavirus loan after the former prime minister messaged a senior adviser to Boris Johnson.\n\nMr Cameron was said to have described the decision to exclude his employer’s firm, Greensill Capital, from the multibillion-pound scheme as “nuts” and pressed for the Chancellor to reconsider.\n\n“What we need is for Rishi (Sunak) to have a good look at this and ask officials to find a way of making it work,” Mr Cameron wrote last year.\n\nThe developments are the latest in a lobbying controversy that has dogged the Conservative former prime minister in recent weeks.\n\nQuestions were mounting over his efforts to secure access for the finance company, which later collapsed putting thousands of UK steelmaking jobs at risk.\n\nMr Greensill was understood to have written to Mr Hancock’s office about the payment scheme in August 2019, copying in NHS England chairman Lord Prior, before the Health Secretary commissioned advice from officials.\n\nAn ally of Mr Hancock confirmed a drink took place between Mr Cameron, the Health Secretary and the Australian financier in October 2019.\n\nMr Greensill’s firm at the time wanted to introduce a flexible scheme to pay doctors and nurses either daily or weekly.\n\nNHS SBS, a joint venture between the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and a French IT firm, went on to announce in October last year that Earnd, a mobile app that was then a division of Greensill, would be available free-of-charge to NHS employees to access their pay.\n\nMr Hancock had referred Mr Greensill to work directly with the NHS rather than his department, according to the ally, who insisted the final decision to use the scheme was for local NHS employers.\n\n“Matt acted in entirely the correct way – he updated officials on the business that was discussed, as is appropriate,” the friend said.\n\nMr Cameron is yet to comment publicly about the “growing scandal”, as Labour has called it.\n\nBut a source close to the former prime minister said: “David Cameron was an enthusiastic champion of Greensill’s pay product, Earnd, and met with various people to discuss its rollout across the NHS.”\n\nA DHSC spokesman said: “The wellbeing of NHS staff is the top priority of the department and Health Secretary.\n\n“Our approach was and is that local NHS employers are best placed to decide how different pay flexibilities fit with their overall pay and reward offer for their staff.”"
