        "text": "The 34-year-old, a former aide of chancellor George Osborne, has been promoted from a junior ministerial role to the more senior post by prime minister David Cameron.\n\nIn his new role he will also take on responsibility for enterprise, particularly small businesses.\n\nThe MP took to Twitter shortly after Mr Cameron announced his move on the social media site to say:'Delighted PM has asked me to be Minister of State for Skills & Enterprise in BIS & DfE. A lot done, a lot more to do.'\n\nIt is a step up from his role as parliamentary undersecretary of state, where he has been in charge of further education, the government's skills strategy and apprenticeships, among other things.\n\nA minister of state is the middle in a hierarchy of three types of minister, with a secretary of state role the next step on the career latter.\n\nMr Hancock, who was elected in 2010, was an economist at the Bank of England between 2000 and 2005 before working for the then shadow chancellor Mr Osborne.\n\nHe stepped down after he was selected as the Conservative candidate for West Suffolk.\n\nHe became a member of the influential Public Accounts Committee shortly after becoming an MP, before he was given the junior minister post last year."
