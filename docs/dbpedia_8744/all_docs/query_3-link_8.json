        "text": "It’s great to be here and to see the room so packed. As you say, it's good timing to have this. We booked this event months in advance, but we couldn't have known actually that a discussion like the one that we're having tonight is so important.\n\nLooking at the news this weekend and looking at what was going on in other conferences sometimes felt like I'm a Conservative… Get Me Out of Here.\n\nThere is a debate going on in the Conservative party and it is absolutely vital that people who understand and love modern Britain, who are liberal in thought and positive in outlook win that debate within the party and I think that matters for where the party is heading and where the country's heading. Bright Blue is absolutely at the forefront of that debate, it has always been unabashed at making the argument for positive, forward-looking, liberal Conservative principles and so I thank you for that thank you for all the work that you've done and for everybody here in support.\n\nI'm in a slightly odd situation because as a Conservative MP, for some unknown reason last autumn I picked up hundreds of thousands of followers on my social media platforms who are mostly under the age of 30 and I've got this following which I've never really had before, so I think I get a sense through that of what people are looking for and what young people are looking for in their politics.\n\nIt's not a sort of preachy, telling everybody what to do, it's about fixing problems and my view is that those of us who believe in a liberal Conservative agenda have got to stand up to the Conservative Corbynistas who just want to divide people and understand that Conservatives govern well and win elections when we build coalitions, when we collaborate with people and when we solve real-world problems rather than trying to exclude anybody with a sense of ideological impurity.\n\nAbove all, we have to govern well, and I call them Conservative Corbynistas because essentially, it's the same. Instead of concentrating on the politics of progress of the people, they preach the same sort of cancel culture and virtue signalling that they say that they abhor on the left.\n\nIf you think about it in electoral terms, the 2019 election wasn't about replacing the ‘blue wall’ with the ‘red wall’, it was about building the ‘red wall’ on top of the ‘blue wall’, it was about building a bigger coalition.\n\nAnd I've got some pretty harrowing news. In the local elections 2 weeks ago, we polled 8% of the under-25s. You might say ‘twas ever thus’, under 25s do not often vote Conservative. However, for the 25- to 49-year-olds that figure was 10%. 10% of 25- to 49-year-olds voted Conservative. That’s down by half since the 2019 election and in 2015, they were 32% and 36%. It is a massive seismic change and we cannot afford to let go on.\n\nWe need to have credible policies that address the issues that younger people care about and I say younger, I mean we're talking about people who are under the age of 50 which of course means that things everybody cares about like the cost of living and the NHS but also increasingly the subjects that matter more to younger generations like housing, the environment and an area I’m particularly passionate about, the digital revolution which today means how we regulate and think about artificial intelligence.\n\nThese subjects really matter, but what doesn't matter is a divisive culture war. We've got to bring people together with us, and we've got to embody the socially liberal positive values that people under 50 overwhelmingly support because if we don't do that then the conservative party will die.\n\nWe should also have a decent policy debate about some of the things that we hear about and unite us across the Conservative party. I've heard a lot in the last week about tax-cutting and about deregulation. When these can be done in a long-term credible way, I'm strongly in favour of them.\n\nIn fact, when in the last generation did we have the most successful deregulatory agenda? Answer: under David Cameron in the coalition.\n\nWhen in the last generation did we best cut taxes? The answer is under George Osborne as Chancellor.\n\nWhen did we have the fastest growth in recent times? The answer was in 2016 when the UK was the fastest-growing economy in the G7.\n\nConservatives can deliver this in office, but we deliver it best from the centre ground of British politics and with a positive liberal agenda. This has got a long and positive history in the Conservative Party from the Factory Acts, the enfranchisement of women, the right to buy, gay marriage and now online safety.\n\nThese positive forward-looking agendas that really deliver for people are what the Conservative Party does.\n\nI know that Rishi Sunak understands this and to save the party and win the election he's got to reject those who want to take things backwards in time. Instead, we know that our liberal Conservative set of ideas are the best for the country and the best for the party.\n\nSo be brave my liberal Conservative friends! Get out there and make the argument. Together, we can make sure that we stand up to the reactionaries wherever we find them and instead make sure that we can deliver for our country and for our party.\n\nThere is a path to victory at the next election but it involves caring about modern Britain, embracing modern Britain and putting forward a positive vision and I know we can do that. Thank you very much."
