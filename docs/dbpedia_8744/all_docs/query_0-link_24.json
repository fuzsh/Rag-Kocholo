        "text": "LONDON — Through the chaos of Brexit, COVID-19 and Tory regicide, there’s been one reassuring constant: Matt Hancock in the news.\n\nSometimes of his own making, but often not, the former health secretary tends to find himself the center of attention.\n\nCurrently, he’s riding out days of coverage about his handling of the pandemic, after a journalist to whom he handed thousands of his WhatsApp messages for his memoirs decided to … pass them on to a newspaper.\n\nHere are seven times Hancock has ended up in the spotlight:\n\nSack to the future\n\nA fresh-faced Hancock had his first unwanted experience with the spotlight when he failed to look behind him during a photoshoot.\n\nLooming over the then-minister for skills in the 2014 pic — taken as part of an interview with Total Politics magazine — was a clear-as-day piece of graffiti about his boss at the time: “Sack Cameron!”\n\nDavid Cameron clearly didn’t mind the gaffe so much — given he actually promoted Hancock to minister for business a week later.\n\nThe app\n\nWestminster was left bemused when Hancock — then the digital minister, in fairness — launched the Matt Hancock App in 2018 as a way of engaging with his constituents.\n\nThe app, in theory, promised to rival Twitter and Facebook as the social network of the future.\n\nIn practice, it was plagued with data usage worries and was permanently shuttered in 2022. But we’ll always have the memories.\n\nThe COVID year\n\nWhen he was appointed as health secretary in 2018 under Theresa May, Hancock can’t have imagined the center-stage role running the government’s response to a global pandemic that would follow two years later.\n\nHe became a household name, regularly helming prime-time COVID press conferences while the virus raged. He was known as a key advocate for stricter rules in the government, often sparking rows with the more skeptical Boris Johnson.\n\nHancock also repeatedly clashed with Dominic Cummings, the former PM’s combative one-time chief aide.\n\nCummings used an appearance at a parliament committee hearing to suggest that “tens of thousands of people died who didn’t need to die” during the early days of the pandemic under Hancock’s control, and that the former health secretary should have been fired for “15 to 20” different things.\n\nHe was eventually fired, but not for any of the reasons Cummings suggested.\n\nSteamy clinch\n\nHancock was forced to quit his high-profile government job after it emerged he had broken coronavirus rules he helped to write.\n\nThe Sun newspaper published in 2021 photographs of the married Hancock engaged in a kiss with his aide Gina Coladangelo, while the U.K. was still following strict social distancing regulations.\n\nTo date, he has not held another job in government. Coladangelo and Hancock are now a couple.\n\nReality check(book)\n\nHancock hoped to get back into government when Rishi Sunak entered Downing Street in October last year.\n\nAfter it became clear that wasn’t going to happen — when Sunak completely ignored Hancock outside No. 10 — he decided against life as a normal backbench MP.\n\nInstead, Hancock jetted off to the Australian jungle to take part in the reality show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here.”\n\nOver two weeks of grueling camp life with other celebrities, Hancock faced down several snakes, took part in karaoke and ate “willy con carne” — a camel’s penis. “Soft and crunchy,” was his verdict on the appendage.\n\nHancock would finish third on the reality show, while his profile on social media apps such as TikTok grew thanks to his TV time.\n\nHis animal-genital-gorging escapades came with a heavy price, however. Hancock lost the Tory whip before he’d even landed in Australia.\n\nEveryone from Sunak to Tory members in his own constituency lined up to attack Hancock’s decision to spend time away from his duties in London and West Sussex during a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAmid the local criticism, he eventually announced he wouldn’t stand again as an MP at the next election.\n\nThe diaries\n\nIn December last year, Hancock released “Pandemic Diaries,” an inside account of his experiences during the pandemic.\n\nBefore his entrance into the jungle, Hancock had announced plans to publish the diaries, despite earlier directly denying he was planning a memoir when asked by POLITICO.\n\nWritten with the anti-lockdown journalist Isabel Oakeshott (more on her in a bit), the book charted the former health secretary’s experience of pushing for tighter lockdown restrictions.\n\nHancock gave Oakeshott access to thousands of his WhatsApp text messages from the time to help her write the book. Should be fine, he (potentially) mused.\n\nReviews were mixed. The Guardian’s Gaby Hinsliff argued that the diaries were clearly written after the fact, allowing Hancock to seem “brilliantly prescient.” Tim Stanley in the right-leaning Telegraph compared Hancock’s tone in the book to the cringe-comedy character Alan Partridge.\n\nNeedless to say, Hancock did not have the last laugh.\n\nThe Hancock leaks\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Hancock heard rumors that a big story about him was brewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concerned MP texted his co-author Oakeshott, asking her if she had “any clues” about what was going on. Oakeshott didn’t reply.\n\nHer reason for ignoring Hancock became clear when the Daily Telegraph published their Lockdown Files investigation — all of which is based on around 100,000 of Hancock’s own WhatsApp messages, which Oakeshott had passed on to the newspaper without Hancock’s knowledge or permission.\n\nThe newspaper is expected to publish stories about Hancock and the government’s handling of the pandemic relating to the material in the texts for days to come.\n\nHancock is now embroiled in a war of words with Oakeshott, whom he accused Thursday of a “massive betrayal.” The journalist said Thursday that Hancock sent her a “menacing” text at 1.22 a.m., something his team denies.\n\n“You have made a big mistake,” Hancock texted Oakeshott.\n\nMistake or not, the leak thrust Hancock back into the spotlight — where he always seems to end up.\n\nAdvertisement"
