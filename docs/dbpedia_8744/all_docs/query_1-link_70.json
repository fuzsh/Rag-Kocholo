        "text": "After leading the nation through the pandemic as England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock has resigned in the aftermath of his affair with an aide that broke his own coronavirus rules.\n\nThe senior minister, who had held three cabinet positions before reaching his 40th birthday, announced his resignation in a video and formal letter to the Prime Minister.\n\nHe said: “I understand the enormous sacrifices that everybody in this country has made, you have made.\n\n“And those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them and that’s why I’ve got to resign.”\n\nAppointed Health Secretary in 2018 after spending 18 months in the culture brief, he has been a prominent figure for the Government during its handling of the coronavirus pandemic until his resignation on Saturday.\n\nFollowing a series of uncomfortable headlines in recent weeks, Mr Hancock faced pressure to stand down after pictures emerged depicting the married minister appearing to kiss his adviser Gina Coladangelo.\n\nThe CCTV images published in The Sun were taken on May 6 when guidance on social distancing were still in place, with hugging between people from different households recommended against.\n\nThis came after the Prime Minister’s former aide Dominic Cummings shared text messages this month in which Boris Johnson is said to have called the Health Secretary – who caught coronavirus last year – “totally f***ing useless”.\n\nMr Cummings accused the senior minister of lying to the Prime Minister over promises to protect those in care homes during the first wave of Covid-19 infections by testing new residents before being admitted.\n\nMr Hancock has dismissed claims he lied and called Mr Johnson’s “hopeless” jibe “ancient history”.\n\nDuring the first face-to-face meeting this week between the Queen and Mr Johnson since the pandemic started, the monarch called Mr Hancock a “poor man” following his time in the limelight since the crisis kicked off in March 2020.\n\nMr Hancock, who in 2018 became the only MP in British politics to launch his own app, took only eight years to rise from West Suffolk MP to Health Secretary.\n\nThe former has made a big play of his varied life before entering politics.\n\nThe Oxford and Cambridge educated father-of-three previously worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as chief of staff to George Osborne when he was shadow chancellor of the Exchequer, before becoming an MP.\n\nMr Hancock, who is said to have met Ms Coladangelo at university, has been married to his wife Martha for 15 years and they have three children together.\n\nMs Coladangelo, the lobbyist and aide who Mr Hancock is claimed to have had an affair with, told a BBC Radio 4 profile on the politician that the pair met at the Oxford University student radio station, Oxygen FM, where she was a news reader and he a sports reporter.\n\nMatt Hancock resigns - tell us what you think - click here.\n\nThe marketing and communications director at Oliver Bonas, a British retailer founded by her husband Oliver Tress, told the BBC about how Mr Hancock had “told a white lie” to his radio news desk after failing to make it to cover an international rugby match.\n\nShe said: “He actually overslept and hot-footed it to the train but didn’t make it to Twickenham in time from Oxford, so had to get off the train at Reading, find a pub, watch the first half in a pub and then go to a phone box outside and report in.\n\n“So he told a white lie, pretended he was at Twickenham watching the rugby when in fact he was in a pub in Reading.”\n\nThe Cheshire-raised politician first attended cabinet after being appointed Minister for the Cabinet Office in 2015 by then prime minister David Cameron.\n\nMr Cameron’s successor Theresa May later promoted him to the role of culture secretary.\n\nThe 42-year-old initially threw his hat into the ring to replace Mrs May in No 10 during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership contest, but withdrew from the leadership race part way through and was quick to throw his weight behind Mr Johnson.\n\nHe was among the handful of ministers to retain his brief when Mr Johnson took power in July 2019, making him one of the most prominent ministers when coronavirus rocked Britain eight months later.\n\nMr Hancock said he is looking forward to “supporting the Government and the Prime Minister from the back benches to make sure that we can get out of this pandemic” in his resignation video."
