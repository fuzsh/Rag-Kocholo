        "text": "Matt Hancock admitted he thought the Prime Minister would resign yesterday at lunchtime\n\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock calls for Boris Johnson to resign\n\nMatt Hancock appeared on Good Morning Britain to condemn the Prime Minister's lack of resignation.\n\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock joined Good Morning Britain this morning to discuss an unprecedented number of MPs resigning from their posts. Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard quizzed Mr Hancock on whether or not Boris Johnson will step down and if he will take his place.\n\n‌\n\nSusanna asked if he is surprised the Prime Minister \"isn't reading the room better\" which Mr Hancock confirmed. He said: \"Yes, I assumed he was going to resign yesterday at lunchtime.\n\nREAD MORE: Newsreader red faced after being caught with feet up on desk\n\n\"So many people in his own cabinet were telling him to go and there are conventions in place and one of them is if you lose half of your cabinet then you stand down and there's a reason for that because it's clearly going to happen because the mechanics are more important than the fact Boris has lost the confidence of the majority in parliament. It'll be better if he does resign today rather than later.\"\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nQuizzed on how many people remain in Boris Johnson's ear telling him to stay, Mr Hancock admitted he didn't know. He said: \"I have no idea and I've supported him through thick and thin because I believe he got the big calls right during the pandemic and Ukraine but it gets to a point where unfortunately he has to go.\"\n\nMentioning how dangerous this could be in a wider picture, referencing possible international interference from the likes of President Putin, Susanna asked if this is something the Conservative party are taking seriously. Mr Hancock said: \"It's in the national interest the Prime Minister stands down.\n\n\"He could continue as a caretaker Prime Minister in the way Theresa May and David Cameron have before him and on those international affairs he's been very strong, he has the strong support of the whole of Parliament so he could continue to deliver what is needed to stand up to Putin as a caretaker Prime Minister while there is a leadership election.\"\n\n‌\n\nWrapping the interview up, when asked if he would put his name forward for the position of Prime Minister, Mr Hancock said: \"I am not going to be standing but I do care very much about what the next Prime Minister stands for and it's really important it's about uniting the country and somebody that can appeal to the north and south of the broad church of the Conservative movement.\"\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nThe Chase's biggest ever wins including Scouser who dominated the show\n\n‌\n\nThree Liverpool restaurants 'do city proud' on Come Dine With Me: The Professionals\n\nNetflix Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown swoons over Liverpudlian trait\n\nChristine McGuinness says 'send help' as she organises twins' birthday party alone\n\n‌\n\nITV Loose Women Coleen Nolan mortified as co-star 'calls' her a 'slippery pig'"
