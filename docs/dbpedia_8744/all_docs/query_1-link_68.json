        "text": "The Covid Inquiry, the official examination into the Government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, opened in London on Tuesday, June 13.\n\nChaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a former Court of Appeal judge, the inquiry includes public hearings as politicians, health experts and civil servants provide insight into the UK’s response and preparedness to the global health crisis.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former prime minister, will be among those called to give evidence over the course of proceedings, which was set up to help learn lessons for future pandemics.\n\nHere are some key questions explained:\n\nWhat will the independent inquiry examine?\n\nLaunched by Mr Johnson in May 2021, the primary objectives are to assess the UK’s response to and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which began circulating in the UK in early 2020, and to learn lessons for the future.\n\nWhen announcing the inquiry, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK’s handling of the pandemic would be “under the microscope”.\n\nIt will also cover decisions made in devolved administrations.\n\nHow long will it take?\n\nNo formal deadline has been set but with public hearings due to be held until 2026 it is likely to take three years to conclude.\n\nBaroness Hallett will split the work of the inquiry into six parts, or modules as they are known as.\n\nThe first to be investigated are: resilience and preparedness, core UK decision-making and political governance and the impact of Covid on healthcare systems.\n\nThe next three, which will include hearings in 2024 and 2025 are: the UK care sector, vaccines, therapeutics and antiviral treatment and government procurement.\n\nWhat issues are likely to be scrutinised?\n\nBaroness Hallett is expected to examine the most controversial and impactful aspects of the Government’s response which may include:\n\nThe decision on when to place the UK into its first lockdown in 2020 - experts say the date restrictions that were put in place could have saved thousands of lives if it was imposed earlier than March 23.\n\nThe move to halt community testing on March 12.\n\nThe approach taken towards care homes - around 40 per cent of Covid deaths were recorded in the first three months of the pandemic - concerns over the lack of testing, PPE shortages and the discharging of patients from hospital when Covid first hit will likely be discussed.\n\nLevel of restrictions imposed during lockdown - the inquiry is likely to examine whether the rules imposed during lockdown were proportionate as the pandemic progressed.\n\nOver 80 days in 2020, England went from the so-called “rule of six”, where social gatherings of more than six people will be against the law.\n\nWho has already given evidence?\n\nThe inquiry has already heard from Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, who said the UK’s approach to pandemic planning was “completely wrong”.\n\nDavid Cameron, the former prime minister between 2010 and 2016, and his chancellor George Osborne, both gave evidence in the second week of the inquiry.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt, who was the health secretary between 2012 and 2018, also gave evidence this same week.\n\nDame Sally Davies, who was chief medical officer for England from 2011 to 2019, has also given evidence, telling the inquiry that lockdown “damaged a generation of children”.\n\nWho will be called to give evidence?\n\nThe inquiry has sent requests for written evidence to hundreds of people including 38 to government departments and quangos.\n\nWitness timetables are only published by the inquiry a week in advance, so it is not clear exactly who will be called to give evidence for each module.\n\nThis week, the inquiry heard from Dame Jenny Harries, the former deputy chief medical officer, as well as Matt Hancock, who was health secretary between 2018-2021.\n\nIt will hear evidence today from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s former first minister, amongst other former Scottish government figures.\n\nBoris Johnson is expected to appear in front of the inquiry to give evidence later this year, but the exact dates of his appearance have yet to be confirmed.\n\nAs well as politicians the inquiry will question scientists and pandemic planners, including those who sat on the Government’s Scientific Advisory Group.\n\nHow will the inquiry examine evidence?\n\nThe inquiry has already received tens of thousands of documents and will speak to hundreds of witnesses, sometimes sitting in the devolved nations.\n\nIt is split into six investigations, called modules, which will each examine different areas relating to the pandemic.\n\nModule 1 will look at resilience and preparedness, whether the Government had properly planned for and was ready for the pandemic.\n\nThe second module will look at core UK decision making and political governance including the initial response and political and civil servant’s actions.\n\nModule 3 will look at healthcare systems including primary care, NHS backlogs and the capacity of hospitals to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe fourth module will look at vaccines and therapeutics while the fifth module will examine procurement.\n\nThe final module will look at the care sector across the country.\n\nHow much will the inquiry cost?\n\nThe inquiry has spent £23 million before it has listened to any evidence and has issued more than £100 million worth of contracts.\n\nTussell a company that monitors government contracts has said that the inquiry has handed out contracts worth £126 million, most of which is being used for digital services to manage evidence and lawyers."
