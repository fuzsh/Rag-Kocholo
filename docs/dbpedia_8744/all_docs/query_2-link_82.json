        "text": "Matt Hancock faces a daunting battle over controversial moves to hand himself more powers over hospitals amid opposition from within the health service and some of his own MPs.\n\nThe Health Secretary is yet to win full support from Downing Street for his reform blueprint for the National Health Service, which will be published within weeks, i understands.\n\nA key element of the planned Health and Care Bill will return control over NHS England and its associated bodies to Mr Hancock and his successors.\n\nThe politically charged move sets the scene for parliamentary skirmishes reminiscent of the storm which engulfed David Cameron’s government when it overhauled the NHS a decade ago.\n\nThe issue has been given an added edge by the multiple questions facing Mr Hancock over his handling of the nation’s response to the coronavirus crisis.\n\n“If you look at what’s gone well and badly in the pandemic, then Hancock was responsible for testing, PPE, social care. What was the NHS responsible for? Making sure people got the care they needed and the roll-out of the vaccination programme,” a Whitehall source told i.\n\nAlthough Mr Hancock has strong personal support from some of his backbenchers following the recent attacks on him by Dominic Cummings, other MPs raised fears over the wisdom of the move.\n\nAnd multiple sources told i that Number 10 is not fully behind the reforms in their current form.\n\nA senior Tory said: “None of us can work out why Matt wants all these powers. He doesn’t seem to realise that with great power comes great responsibility. He’ll get to boss people around more. But he’ll also get the blame when things go wrong.”\n\nAnother MP said: “Do I want the Secretary of State to have even more power? What do you think? Why are they overhauling the NHS right now? It’s going to take up so much time and energy when my constituents are sitting on waiting lists. What are they thinking?”\n\nOther Conservative MPs said the Health Secretary’s position had grown since he was targeted for bitter criticism last month by Boris Johnson’s former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.\n\n“He is very active on WhatsApp. If someone says on WhatsApp that they have a problem with a local health issue he is always very responsive even though he is Secretary of State,” a former minister said.\n\nThe Commons health committee has said it welcomed the “direction of travel” proposed in the reforms, but said there was not “adequate detail on how the new powers proposed for the Secretary of State will be used”.\n\nIt added: “Nor does it set out the necessary safeguards to ensure that the powers do not open the door to the politicisation of the NHS.”\n\nThe Cameron government provoked a storm ten years ago when the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley pushed through a major NHS reorganisation – even though the plans were not mentioned in the Tory manifesto.\n\nOne Whitehall figure has warned the new legislation could become “Lansley mark two”, referring to the battles endured by Lord Lansley to get his plans through Parliament.\n\nWhat is included in the proposed reforms?\n\nPowers for ministers\n\nThe Health Secretary’s authority over the health service, which was given day-to-day independence nine years ago, will increase. The Bill will grant ministers the powers to issue orders to NHS England and to block changes to the configuration of local hospitals.\n\nMr Hancock told MPs earlier this year that clinical decisions should be independent, but said that “when the NHS is the public’s top domestic priority” and “when the quality of our healthcare matters to every single citizen and every one of our constituents, the NHS must be accountable to ministers”.\n\nBetter integration of health and care\n\nEnsuring hospitals, GPs, home care and care homes, community health services, and mental health services work more closely together through an Integrated Care System (IGC) in every part of England. The Government says it is removing “transactional bureaucracy” and patients are being given a statutory right to choose their treatment.\n\nRestructuring the NHS\n\nThe IGCs will replace the clinical commissioning groups set up to buy care under the 2012 reforms. Hospitals, GPs and councils will sit on their boards.\n\nCollaboration\n\nNHS organisations will have a statutory duty to collaborate as rules requiring the competitive tendering of contracts are ditched.\n\nPublic health\n\nA 9pm watershed will be introduced for television advertisements for food and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt from next April, along with a total online ban. Firms with more than 250 employees will also be forced to list calories on the food they serve.\n\nMinisters will gain the powers to order that food packets carry health warnings.\n\nSafety\n\nThe Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch will gain legal powers. It investigates healthcare incidents and “the most serious patient safety risks”."
