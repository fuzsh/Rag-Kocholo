        "text": "Businesses from across the UK will provide their support to make next week’s NATO Summit a success, Business Minister Matthew Hancock announced today (29 August 2014).\n\nBAE Systems, Raytheon UK, General Dynamics UK, Lockheed Martin UK and Airbus have been confirmed as official supporters of the event and will provide financial backing and showcase cutting edge technologies at Celtic Manor in Newport during September’s summit.\n\nAll of the companies are major employers with bases in Wales and all invest in building skills by providing apprenticeships.\n\nThe defence industry generates over £22 billion per year for the UK economy and directly employs 162,400 people, including 4,900 apprentices and trainees. The industry indirectly supports a further 114,200 jobs.\n\nEquipment on display at Celtic Manor will include:\n\nGeneral Dynamic’s next-generation SCOUT SV armoured fighting vehicle – in development just outside Blackwood near Newport. As well as their Foxhound, the newest military vehicle\n\nBAE Systems’ Terrier, the Army’s remote-controlled armoured engineering vehicle\n\nfull scale replicas of the Eurofighter Typhoon fast jet and the F-35B Joint Strike Fighter Lightning II stealth fast jet. Approximately 15% of the Joint Strike Fighter programme involves work carried out in the UK, with more than 130 British companies contributing to the supply chain. Overall the programme is worth over £1 billion to UK industry every year, and will support around 25,000 British jobs over the next 24 years\n\nThe BMW Group and Jaguar Land Rover will also support the summit by providing transport to the delegates.\n\nBusiness Minister Matthew Hancock said:\n\nThis week shines a spotlight on the UK’s thriving defence industry. As part of our long term economic plan, we are working closely with the defence sector to secure new investment, highly-skilled jobs and build a better and brighter future for Britain.\n\nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon said:\n\nThe defence industry is hugely important to our security and economy. These companies work every day to ensure our Armed Forces have the best equipment in the world and I welcome their involvement in showcasing some of that during the NATO Summit.\n\nThe news comes after a GREAT reception to showcase Welsh business, education and tourism hosted by First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones and the Secretary of State for Wales Stephen Crabb earlier this week. More than 200 guests attended the event at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to find out how both governments are promoting Wales overseas using the UK’s extensive overseas network and to see some examples of Wales’ finest produce.\n\nOn Wednesday (27 August 2014) Business Secretary Vince Cable also jointly announced a UK Investment Summit with Wales Office Secretary of State Stephen Crabb and Welsh Government Business Secretary Edwina Hart. To run on November 20 and 21 2014, the summit will be held in Newport, Wales, and focus on new technologies.\n\nWith 60 world leaders, 70 foreign and defence chiefs, 4,000 delegates and up to 1,500 international media all set to attend the NATO Summit, the influx of visitors will deliver an economic boost for south Wales. This follows the release last month of annual investment figures from UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) which showed that Wales registered an 18% increase in inward investment over the past year compared to 2012/2013.\n\nThrough the Defence Growth Partnership (DGP), the government is working closely with industry to ensure the UK retains its competitive advantage and maximises opportunities in increasingly competitive global markets. At last month’s (July 2014) Farnborough International Airshow, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the DGP’s Implementation Plan, which set out a package of measures to improve the UK’s competitiveness, support collaboration, strengthen international focus and build on strengths in air capabilities and intelligent systems for export-led growth. The defence industry generates over £22 billion per year for the UK economy and directly employs 162,400 people, including 4,900 apprentices and trainees. The industry indirectly supports a further 114,200 jobs.\n\nBAE Systems, General Dynamics UK, Lockheed Martin UK and Airbus all run apprenticeship programmes in areas including engineering, business, logistics, desktop support and commercial support. The BMW Group and Jaguar Land Rover also have apprenticeship schemes.\n\nNotes to Editors"
