        "text": "Not only is Hancock being held accountable for every clinical, organisational, procurement and staffing decision of one of the biggest employers in the world (with 1.4 million employees) but he is grappling too with the institutional stasis and statist mindset of important elements thereof (hello Public Health England) and trying to pull levers which won’t move, as a result of the flawed governance architecture bequeathed him as a result of Andrew Lansley’s ill-conceived Health and Social Care Act 2012 (Full disclosure: Yes, I voted for it).\n\nIt’s for that reason that the NHS is still not at its capacity for PPE provision, is still not able to effect key purchasing outcomes across the NHS estate in a timely and focused way and with just seven days to go and why the Health Secretary is being tortured each day by a cohort of unfriendly journalists over his pledge of achieving 100,000 Covid 19 tests each day by 30th April - it’s now at 39,000 but it’s a target he is almost inevitably going to miss.\n\nYes, he’s ruffled feathers in the Cabinet and across government - such as his injudicious remarks about the PM last summer - but he’s also remained quietly confident, calm under pressure, candid, professional and plausible. He’s the first Health Secretary to seriously tackle poor communications in the NHS and to try to utilise the power of technology to help NHS staff deliver a better but cost effective service to patients.\n\nMatt Hancock is unlikely to allow tactical diversions like the fuss over the UK’s participation in the EU PPE procurement project - which has delivered zero pieces of kit to zero patients thus far - to obscure the achievement of the big picture strategic objectives, which will be what voters will judge him, his ministerial team and his boss the Prime Minister on.\n\nSpecifically, the lockdown and social distancing has been largely observed as a result of the most significant usurpation of civil liberties (arguably) in modern British history and the NHS has proved itself resilient and capable of holding back the tide of infection, disease and death, avoiding the calamity witnessed in parts of the United States, Italy and potentially soon in Japan, where hospital intensive care units have collapsed under the strain of insufficient staffing, equipment and sheer weight of patient numbers. What more do people demand?\n\nThe good ship Hancock has remained seaworthy through the squalls of Tory politics (as befits the former Minister for Portsmouth) despite labouring under a number of disadvantages: Since the defenestration of his mentor, protector and strongest advocate, the Tory Party’s most powerful capo dei capi in the Cameron era, George Osborne, a man of considerable charm and cunning but one who bore many grudges, Hancock has been short of a power base, hence his fleeting four day leadership election campaign last June. Not only is he a symbol of the ancien regime of 2005-16 but he very evidently picked the wrong team in the Brexit wars and many folk see that Leave v Remain schism, as well as hostility to Boris Johnson, together with a perception of a “born to rule” mentality, in judging him.\n\nUnfair? Maybe.\n\nDry your tears. Matt has a hide like a pangolin, is clever, hardworking, single-minded and Machiavellian and has infinite reserves of ambition and self-belief. A man who played cricket at the North Pole and suffered frostbite as a result and races horses for fun, is unlikely to be intimidated by a little customary friendly fire from rivals.\n\nThis is a guy who was a Bank of England economist, effortlessly inherited a safe seat, who Osborne brought in to his inner circle for his smart economic analyses, a man who has sat at the top table in Opposition and Government, wrote tax policy, helped set up the Office of Budget Responsibility and went eyeball to eyeball with Treasury mandarins to show who was boss when Osborne took over as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010. He also has an excellent and popular Parliamentary aide in Steve Double, who will have helped him smooth troubled waters in the Parliamentary Conservative Party as well as a team of media savvy and smart junior Ministers.\n\nThose who write him off might be making a mistake. Having lived through the triumphs and travails of the Cameron epoch and the valley of death that was the EU Referendum result and the disastrous May interregnum, Hancock has an eye on the future and understands the essentially fatuous nature of the 24 hour “gotcha” news cycle and the breathless hunt for scandal, u-turn, gaffe and obfuscation and the fact it’s white noise for most voters. He also comprehends the perils of hubris and elitism. Despite past history, the Prime Minister will have appreciated his staying power and loyalty during his absence leading to the unplanned and temporary and unprecedented power vacuum in Downing Street.\n\nHe’ll be content to take his chance with posterity in a year or three or five. He certainly has time on his side and will probably outlast his many enemies.\n\nStewart Jackson was a Conservative MP from 2005-17, Chief of Staff to Rt Hon David Davis MP as Brexit Secretary 2017-18 and was Strategic Counsel at CTF Partners 2018-20"
