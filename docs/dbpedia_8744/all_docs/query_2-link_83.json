        "text": "LONDON — David Cameron, the former British prime minister, is to face a formal investigation into his business dealings after revelations that he lobbied former colleagues by text message and over drinks on behalf of an Anglo-Australian finance firm.\n\nDowning Street announced the review on Monday after weeks of publicity about claims that Mr. Cameron, who stepped down as prime minister in 2016, had approached cabinet ministers on behalf of the firm, Greensill Capital, which has now collapsed.\n\nMr. Cameron was a friend and rival of the current prime minister, Boris Johnson — first at Eton College, Britain’s most famous high school, then at Oxford University and finally within the Conservative Party, which they both went on to lead.\n\nThe allegations come at a sensitive moment for Mr. Johnson, whose government has been accused of cronyism and favoritism toward Conservative Party supporters in awarding lucrative contracts during the coronavirus crisis.\n\n“The pandemic has raised the stakes on ethics in public life,” said Hannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government, a think tank, who once ran an official committee on standards.\n\n“Not only is it more important for lobbying to be transparent during a time of emergency when government has deliberately suspended normal rules on procurement and public appointments in order to respond at speed,” she said, “but the idea of politicians benefiting from the crisis by lining their pockets is particularly offensive.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
