        "text": "Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has appeared on ITV Good Morning Britain and revealed whether he will run for Prime Minister. He discussed Boris Johnson's future on Thursday.\n\nMr Hancock told Susanna Reid : \"Yes, I assumed he was going to resign yesterday at lunchtime.\" He added: \"So many people in his own cabinet were telling him to go and there are conventions in place and one of them is if you lose half of your cabinet then you stand down and there's a reason for that because it's clearly going to happen because the mechanics are more important than the fact Boris has lost the confidence of the majority in parliament.\n\n\"It'll be better if he does resign today rather than later.\" He added: \"I have no idea and I've supported him through thick and thin because I believe he got the big calls right during the pandemic and Ukraine but it gets to a point where unfortunately he has to go.\"\n\nREAD MOREKate Middleton and Prince William used three subtle signs to communicate in Wimbledon royal box\n\nHe said: \"It's in the national interest the Prime Minister stands down. He could continue as a caretaker Prime Minister in the way Theresa May and David Cameron have before him and on those international affairs he's been very strong, he has the strong support of the whole of Parliament so he could continue to deliver what is needed to stand up to Putin as a caretaker Prime Minister while there is a leadership election.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would put his name forward for the position of Prime Minister, Mr Hancock said: \"I am not going to be standing but I do care very much about what the next Prime Minister stands for and it's really important it's about uniting the country and somebody that can appeal to the north and south of the broad church of the Conservative movement.\"\n\nREAD MOREBREAKING Boris Johnson told to quit by group of ministers at Downing Street\n\nREAD MOREThousands of women issued £8,900 warning after DWP mix-up\n\nREAD MOREChristine McGuinness breaks silence on 'difficult times' amid Paddy split rumours\n\nREAD MOREUK set for sizzling 32C July heatwave as Met Office speaks out\n\nREAD MOREPaul O'Grady shares personal update he didn't think would ever happen"
