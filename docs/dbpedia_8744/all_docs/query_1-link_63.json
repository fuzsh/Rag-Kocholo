        "text": "Even though the next general election may not be until January 2025 at the latest, a number of MPs have already announced they will not be standing the next time the country goes to the polls.\n\nThose who have announced their intention to leave parliament in the next few years range from the longest standing female MP, Labour's Harriet Harman, to one of those only elected at the last election in 2019, Conservative MP Dehenna Davison.\n\nRead more: How does the number of MPs stepping down compare to previous years?\n\nHere is a full list of all the MPs standing down at the next election:\n\nJames Heappey (CON)\n\nArmed forces minister James Heappey announced he will leave his government post and stand down at the next election.\n\nThe MP for the Wells constituency in Somerset decided to leave parliament because of personal reasons, a source close to him told Sky News.\n\nThe announcement came amid growing disquiet among Conservative MPs and military insiders that the budget failed to announce new funding for the armed forces.\n\nHowever, a source close to Mr Heappey said while \"of course he thinks there should be more money - it's not why he's resigning\".\n\nBrandon Lewis (CON)\n\nBrandon Lewis, the former Northern Ireland secretary, also confirmed he will stand down as an MP at the next general election.\n\nMr Lewis, also a former chairman of the Conservative Party, said he was proud of \"the small part I have been able to play in public life\".\n\nTheresa May (CON)\n\nThe former prime minister has joined the scores of Tory MPs standing down at the next election after 27 years of representing her constituency of Maidenhead.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to her local newspaper, Mrs May said she had taken the \"difficult decision\" to quit the Commons, saying causes including her Global Commission on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking \"have been taking an increasing amount of my time\".\n\nThe 67-year-old also pledged her support to Rishi Sunak and said she believed the Conservatives could win the next election.\n\n\"As I pass the baton on I will be working with my successor to secure a Conservative victory in Maidenhead. I remain committed to supporting Rishi Sunak and the government and believe that the Conservatives can win the election,\" she said.\n\n\"I have always said there is no greater privilege than being an MP; I have served as home secretary and prime minister but none of that would have been possible without the people of Maidenhead and the constituency which I have been proud to call my home.\"\n\nKwasi Kwarteng (CON)\n\nKwasi Kwarteng, the former chancellor and Conservative MP for Spelthorne, has announced he will stand down at the next election.\n\nAn MP since 2010, he was appointed chancellor by Liz Truss during her brief tenure as prime minister, but was later sacked after his mini-budget caused turmoil in the markets and forced her to resign.\n\nPrior to serving as chancellor, Mr Kwarteng served in roles including Brexit minister and was business minister before he was promoted to the Cabinet as business secretary by Boris Johnson in January 2021.\n\nShortly after the Truss administration collapsed, Mr Kwarteng admitted he and Ms Truss \"blew it\" and got \"carried away\" with bringing in sweeping economic reforms.\n\nWriting on social media, Mr Kwarteng said: \"I informed my association chair of my decision not to stand at the next general election.\n\n\"It has been an honour to serve the residents of Spelthorne since 2010, and I shall continue to do so for the remainder of my time in parliament.\"\n\nBob Neill (CON)\n\nSir Bob Neill first entered parliament when he was elected in the 2006 Bromley and Chislehurst by-election.\n\nNow a senior backbencher, Sir Bob has also held government posts in the past, including as a local government minister during the coalition years.\n\nHe has also chaired a number of parliamentary committees and currently leads the justice select committee.\n\nIn a post on X, Sir Bob said he was standing down to spend more time with his family.\n\n\"I am grateful for the huge privilege to be MP for Bromley & Chislehurst, but there comes a time to put family first,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But I shall look for other ways to champion the causes I have fought for in parliament: the rule of law, stroke care, opera and the arts, Gibraltar and more.\"\n\nMike Freer (CON)\n\nConservative minister Mike Freer announced he was quitting parliament after more than a decade, telling Sky News: \"There comes a point when you just have to say, enough.\"\n\nMr Freer, who has served as the MP for Finchley and Golders Green since 2010, said an arson attack on his constituency office in north London on Christmas Eve was \"the last straw\".\n\nIt was the latest in a string of incidents - including what he described as a \"narrow miss\" after the killer of his colleague, Southend MP Sir David Amess, had also watched his Finchley office before killing Sir David at a constituency surgery.\n\nMr Freer told Politics Hub With Sophy Ridge he had reached the moment where \"the level of risk becomes too much\".\n\nHe also said the impact on his family \"when they see you going out to do some part of your job in a stab vest\" was \"really not fair on them\".\n\nThe Tory MP also called for action from social media companies to \"get to the root cause\" of the problem, saying people are \"being given the green light to feel they have got open season on their public servants\" through the platforms.\n\nOliver Heald (CON)\n\nOliver Heald, an MP for 32 years, will not stand in the election this year, saying he wants to spend more time with his grandchildren.\n\n\"It has been a great privilege to serve the people of this wonderful constituency since 1992 and to have won the confidence of the majority of electors in eight general elections. I shall continue to work hard for the people of North East Hertfordshire until the election and I shall continue to support the Conservative cause and the prime minister,\" he said.\n\nMr Heald served as pensions minister under John Major, as solicitor general under David Cameron and as justice minister under Theresa May.\n\nSir James Duddridge (CON)\n\nSir James Duddridge, a former minister and the MP for Rochford and South East, said it had been an \"honour\" to serve as the constituency's MPs but that he would not stand at the next election.\n\nIn a letter to his local association, he wrote: \"I have notified my Association Chairman of my decision not to stand at the next General Election. It has been an honour to serve as the MP for Rochford and Southend East since 2005. I will continue to serve my constituents, and I look forward to new challenges.\"\n\nBob Stewart (IND, former CON)\n\nThe 74-year-old former army officer, who surrendered the Conservative whip after he was convicted of racial abuse, said it was \"time for a new candidate\" for his seat, which is expected to change at the next election.\n\nMr Stewart, who has represented the London constituency of Beckenham since 2010, revealed his decision in a brief statement on X which did not refer to his recent court case.\n\nMr Stewart said in the post: \"Serving Beckenham as its member of parliament for 13 years has been an honour and privilege.\n\n\"I am incredibly grateful to everyone who has given me this opportunity.\n\n\"However, it is time for a new candidate, so I will not be seeking re-election at the next election.\"\n\nThe geographical boundary of the Beckenham constituency is expected to become Beckenham and Penge at the next general election following a review aimed at equalising population sizes across the seats at Westminster.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Stewart was found guilty at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court of racially abusing an activist by telling him to \"go back to Bahrain\".\n\nNick Gibb (CON)\n\nLong-serving schools minister Nick Gibb will take up a diplomatic role after the election after serving as the MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for 26 years.\n\nMr Gibb, who served as schools minister under David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, said he remained an \"enthusiastic supporter of the prime minister's leadership\".\n\n\"I am proud that over my 10 years as a minister standards in schools have risen. England is 4th in the world in reading as a result of the phonics reforms and we are rising internationally for maths and English. We have transformed the curriculum so that it is knowledge rich,\" he said.\n\nJohn Baron (CON)\n\nJohn Baron will stand down at the next election after serving as an MP since 2001.\n\nMr Baron was first elected as the MP for Billericay & District from 2001 and then Basildon & Billericay from 2010.\n\nHe said that although he believed Rishi Sunak would win the next election due to his \"competence and compassion\", he had decided the \"time has come for me to move on\".\n\n\"It has been a great honour and privilege to serve my constituents, and I thank all for their support and kindness over the years. I have been lucky to make many friends.\"\n\nJamie Wallis (CON)\n\nThe MP for Bridgend, who came out as transgender in March 2022, said he was seeking a new seat outside Wales - but that he was doing so \"with a sense of humour\".\n\nIn July that year, Mr Wallis was disqualified from driving for six months and fined £2,500 after being found guilty of three traffic offences.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News' Sophy Ridge in 2022, Mr Wallis - who still prefers the pronouns he and him - revealed he had felt this way for a \"very long time\".\n\n\"I have gender dysphoria... that is the medical diagnosis that is required for a legal change of gender but it is also the condition that describes that lack of reconciliation between what you look like and what your body says and how you feel on the inside.\"\n\nLisa Cameron (CON)\n\nFormerly of the SNP, Lisa Cameron defected to the Tories last year over what she called the \"toxic and bullying SNP Westminster group\".\n\nDr Cameron said she and her family have been forced into hiding after receiving a barrage of threatening messages, including one in which someone said: \"I hope you burn\".\n\nThe MP for East Kilbride, Strathaven & Lesmahagow, a former NHS psychologist, criticised her treatment by the SNP and its leadership after she spoke out about her colleague, Patrick Grady.\n\nMr Grady was suspended from the House of Commons for two days last year after he was found to have made an \"unwanted sexual advance\" to a member of party staff in 2016.\n\nDr Cameron defied calls for a by-election to be held in her seat and she she would remain the MP until the next election.\n\nChris Grayling (CON)\n\nFormer transport secretary Chris Grayling recently announced he will not defend Epsom and Ewell at the next election - the seat he has held since 2001.\n\nThe MP said he had been successfully treated for prostate cancer earlier this year and the diagnosis had led him to decide it was \"time for change\".\n\nMr Grayling served in both David Cameron and Theresa May's governments, most recently as transport secretary from 2016 to 2019 - where he earned the nickname \"failing Grayling\" after presiding over a series of mishaps.\n\nAlok Sharma (CON)\n\nConservative former cabinet member Sir Alok Sharma is also standing down from parliament.\n\nSir Alok, who chaired the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, has been critical of Rishi Sunak after he watered down the government's climate commitments.\n\nSir Alok said \"it'd be incredibly damaging for business confidence, for inward investment, if the political consensus that we have forged in our country on the environment and climate action is fractured.\n\n\"And, frankly, I really do not believe that it's going to help any political party electorally which chooses to go down this path.\"\n\nIn his letter to his constituency announcing his decision, the MP for Reading West said he will still \"champion in parliament the causes I care deeply about, especially climate action\".\n\nSir Alok's seat, which he has held since 2010, is being changed as part of the review of constituency boundaries before the next election, expected in 2024. It will be renamed Reading West and Mid Berkshire.\n\nBen Wallace (CON)\n\nBen Wallace was appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson when he became prime minister in 2019.\n\nHe stayed in the job when he was ousted from Downing Street and remained in-post during the short tenure of Liz Truss - and that of Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe announcement he is stepping down at the next election came after rumours he had tried and failed to become the next leader of NATO.\n\n\"I went into politics in the Scottish parliament in 1999. That's 24 years. I've spent well over seven years with three phones by my bed,\" he told The Times.\n\nIt also came after he told a press conference that the UK was not an \"Amazon\" delivery service for weapons to Ukraine - in contrast to his long-standing support of their fight against Russia.\n\nDominic Raab (CON)\n\nFormer justice secretary and deputy prime minister Dominic Raab will stand down at the next election after serving as an MP since 2010.\n\nHis decision comes a month after he quit Rishi Sunak's cabinet over claims he bullied civil servants.\n\nMr Raab is currently the Conservative MP for Esher and Walton in Surrey, where a slender majority of 2,743 has made his seat a key target for the Lib Dems.\n\nMr Raab has \"become increasingly concerned\" about the pressure the job has placed on his young family, according to a letter explaining his decision seen by The Telegraph.\n\nLast month, a bullying probe into the former cabinet minister's behaviour concluded he acted in an \"intimidating way\" and was \"unreasonably and persistently aggressive\" in meetings.\n\nSajid Javid (CON)\n\nSajid Javid has written to the chair of his constituency party in Bromsgrove to say he will not stand at the next general election.\n\nHe was unsuccessful in his bid for Conservative Party leadership in 2022 and had previously held a number of positions in cabinet, including chancellor, health secretary and business secretary.\n\n\"It has been a decision I have wrestled with for some time, but I have ultimately concluded not to stand again for what would be my fifth election,\" he said.\n\n\"Being the local MP and serving in Government has been the privilege of my life and I am immensely grateful for the opportunity to serve. I always sought to make decisions in the national interest, and in line with my values, and I can only hope my best was sufficient.\"\n\nBromsgrove is considered a safe Conservative seat, with Mr Javid winning a majority of just over 23,000 votes in the 2019 general election.\n\nMatt Hancock (IND, former CON)\n\nThe former health secretary wrote to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on 7 December to let him know he would not be standing for the Conservatives at the next election.\n\nHe was suspended from the party in November after he announced he was going on reality TV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here but said in his letter the chief whip \"made clear\" last week he would restore the whip \"in due course, but that is now not necessary\".\n\nRevealing he will not be standing 10 days after finishing third on I'm A Celeb, Mr Hancock said: \"There was a time when I thought the only way to influence the public debate was in parliament, but I've realised there's far more to it than that.\n\n\"For my part, I want to do things differently. I have discovered a whole new world of possibilities which I am excited to explore - new ways for me to communicate with people of all ages and from all backgrounds.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old MP, who has a 23,194 majority in his West Suffolk constituency, said he wants to champion issues \"dear to my heart\", including better support for dyslexic children.\n\nNadine Dorries (CON)\n\nIn announcing her intention to stand down at the next general election, former culture secretary Ms Dorries blamed the \"sheer stupidity\" of her colleagues who \"got rid of Boris Johnson\".\n\nThe Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire fought back tears as she delivered the news on her TalkTV show, saying the decision had followed \"much soul-searching\".\n\nMs Dorries is a staunch supporter of the former PM and has not hidden her views on Rishi Sunak since he became prime minister.\n\nShe said: \"Those MPs who drank the Kool-Aid and got rid of Boris Johnson are already asking themselves the question: who next?\n\n\"And I'm afraid that the lack of cohesion, the infighting and occasionally the sheer stupidity from those who think we could remove a sitting prime minister, who secured a higher percentage of the vote share than Tony Blair did in 1997, just three short years ago...\n\n\"That [they think] they could do that and the public would let us get away with it, I'm afraid it's this behaviour that I now just have to remove myself from.\"\n\nAs she began welling up, she added: \"And so despite it being a job that I've loved for every year I've done it, I'm now off. Oh gosh, I've just said it out loud, there's no going back now.\"\n\nGeorge Eustice (CON)\n\nFormer environment secretary George Eustice said it was a \"difficult decision\", but after 15 years as the MP for Camborne and Redruth, he wants to take the opportunity to have another career outside politics.\n\nThe senior Tory was secretary of state under Boris Johnson, from February 2020 until September 2022.\n\nAnnouncing his decision, Mr Eustice said: \"By the time of the next election, I will have been in politics for 25 years, including almost 15 years as a member of parliament.\n\n\"I will also be 53 and I want the opportunity to do a final career outside politics so have decided not to seek re-election.

But to be frank, it has meant I haven't had anything like a normal life for a 20-something,\" she said.\n\nMs Davison, 29, was thought to have represented a new style of Conservatism which demolished large swathes of Labour's \"Red Wall\" of seats in the snap election three years ago.\n\nWilliam Wragg (CON)\n\nSenior Tory Mr Wragg has also confirmed he will not run again.\n\nHe is the vice-chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers and has held the Hazel Grove constituency in Greater Manchester since 2015.\n\nHe took the seat from the Liberal Democrats and, in

commitment into law in 2019 when serving as a minister in former PM Theresa May's government.\n\nSir Gary Streeter (CON)\n\nThe long-standing South West Devon MP will also not seek re-election.\n\nSir

privilege to represent this consistency for over 30 years, but the time has come for me to step back and let a younger person take over.\"\n\nSir Gary, who was knighted in 2018, said he had \"great confidence that under Rishi Sunak's leadership our country will recover strongly from recent challenges\".\n\nChloe Smith (CON)\n\nThe former work and pensions secretary is another Conservative MP who has announced she will not continue her parliamentary career.\n\nMs Smith, who served in Liz Truss's cabinet during her brief tenure in Number 10, has held the Norwich North seat since 2009.\n\nWhen

and when you find yourself beginning to wonder what life without midnight sittings of the House and a dairy built around the whims of the Whips' Office might look like - it is probably time to step back.\"\n\nSir Paul holds a 12,041 majority at present, but his Mole Valley constituency is due to be split before the next election -
