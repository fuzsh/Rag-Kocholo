LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Matthew Hancock has been named as Britain's new business enterprise and energy minister as one of a number of changes to the cabinet.

Prime Minister David Cameron on Tuesday pushed through his biggest government shake-up since coming to power in 2010, making changes aimed at boosting the popularity of the Conservatives ahead of a general election next year.

Hancock has served as a member of parliament for West Suffolk since 2010 and previously worked as an economist at the Bank of England and as an adviser to Chancellor George Osborne.

Former energy minister Michael Fallon, who was a supporter of moves to try to exploit Britain's shale gas resources, has become defence secretary.

In another appointment, Amber Rudd was named to replace Greg Barker as minister of state for the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC).

Rudd has served as member of parliament for East Sussex since 2010 and has also worked for Osborne. (Reporting By Susanna Twidale; editing by Jane Baird)
