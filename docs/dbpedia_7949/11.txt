Description - Butterfly by Sonya Hartnett

A gripping, beautifully observed tale of what a teenage girl will do to keep her friends, by one of Australia's finest writers, Sonya Hartnett.

On the verge of her fourteenth birthday, Plum knows her life will change. But she has no idea how.

Over the coming weeks, her beautiful neighbour Maureen will show her how she might fly. Her adored older brothers will court catastrophe in worlds that she barely knows exist. And her friends - her worst enemies - will tease and test, smelling weakness. They will try to lead her on and take her down.

Who ever forgets what happens when you're fourteen?
