Finally, I tap three words.\n\nAre you okay?\n\nI add xoxo. My name. Hit send. Wait a bit and check email. Nothing. Check again. Nothing. Cry. Sleep. Look again. Please answer, I pray. Still nothing.\n\nWhen Dad died, I set up an account on Ancestry. Kicking myself for not doing it while he lived. Some while later, I forget how long, I get a message. Hello, it says. I am your cousin in Kyiv. So good to find you here.\n\nOh my God, I reply, what a miracle. I am so glad you found me!\n\nBarely got to know each other. Comparing faces. Look, this is grandpapa. Like your grandpa, yes? My English is okay, no? It’s good, it’s good. Uncle is gone? I am so sorry, cousin. Then Putin dropped bombs. On Kyiv.\n\nTwo years. I don’t know where she is. If she is. Some things, no one teaches us. Because no one can. Like how to carry not knowing for so long."
