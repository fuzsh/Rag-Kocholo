I include my favorite book quotes from Unlikely Animals, frequently asked questions, a brief synopsis, book club discussion questions, similar books, and more!\n\nContent warnings: Terminal illness, grief, cancer, death of a parent, substance use disorder, dementia, child death mentioned, infidelity mentioned, suicide attempt mentioned\n\nUnlikely Animals Book Review / Summary\n\nONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post, Book Riot • Longlisted for the Joyce Carol Oates Prize\n\nUnlikely Animals is a unique, heartwarming story about a girl named Emma who returns to her small-town home in New Hampshire after dropping out of medical school.\n\nHer childhood home is dealing with a very real opioid crisis. And her father, Clive, is dying of brain cancer.\n\nWhile that’s reason enough for many to come home, Emma’s return is much more complicated.\n\nThe Charm\n\nGrowing up, she was known in her town as a healer because of what her father affectionately named “the Charm.”\n\nIt didn’t take long for people to realize she had a gift—a touch of magic—and the Charm garnered a lot of attention throughout her life. But her gift fizzles out when she needs it most: for her brother’s drug addiction and now her father’s illness.\n\nWhen she returns from city life, burned out and aimless, there are many tensions in her family that unravel and play out in surprising ways.\n\nClive’s Eccentric Life\n\nCaring for her father—who’s hallucinating small animals and forgetting big and small details of his life—turns out to be a complicated mess.\n\nNot only is Clive hallucinating animals but he has visions of the ghost of long-dead naturalist Ernest Harold Baynes, known as the “Doctor Doolittle” of his time.\n\nWell, if this all sounds a little strange and a little paranormal (perfect for a fall book club pick!), buckle up, because there’s another layer that makes this story so interesting and delightful . . .\n\nThe novel is told in omniscient point of view, narrated by the dead in the local Maple Street Cemetery. And spoiler alert, I loved it.\n\nThe Perfect Literary Fiction\n\nThere’s much more to this story, including a childhood best friend who goes missing who Clive is hell-bent on finding. There’s a bit of romance, quirky school kid characters, and some seriously hilarious moments.\n\nBut at its core, this tragicomic book is about imperfect relationships, finding your place in the world, letting go of expectations, forgiveness, and what it looks like to embrace the strange and wonderful and sometimes hurtful parts of being human.\n\nAs Clive would put it, “a poet loves anything that better illuminates the daily horror of being alive.”\n\nMy Thoughts: Unlikely Animals Review\n\nI adored Unlikely Animals. Absolutely adored it. This may be one of my new favorite books, and I have to apologize now for the disorganized gushing!\n\nClive Sterling\n\nZany Clive Sterling is one of the most endearing, interesting, well-drawn characters I’ve read in a long time. Perhaps this is the best way to describe him pre-brain tumor:\n\n“He’d always been more eccentric than other dads, not the kind of dad who putters around the house fixing things. Instead, he was riding his motorcycle, practicing with his metal band, drinking too much, and reciting poetry when no one was asking for poetry.”\n\nEmma and her family are so real, and I know I will always care about them and think of them often.\n\nWitty Humor\n\nThis book is so very funny. I don’t know if it’s just my humor, but the dry dialogue, descriptions, POV—it was all so smart and funny, with a healthy dose of wit and sarcasm. I mean, even with the heavy plot of a parent dying of brain cancer in a small town overrun with a very real opioid epidemic—and many other downright depressing things—there’s a lightness that shines through. We don’t stay in the dark for very long.\n\nFractured Relationships\n\nAnnie Hartnett so perfectly captures that fractured relationship between childhood best friends who have grown apart but deeply care about each other. Here’s a glimpse:\n\nPeople talk a lot about first loves, or the love of your life, but people don’t say as much about the friend of your life. . . . No one ever stops loving their high school best friend, no matter how we lose them. Some of us at Maple Street had lost our childhood best friends to world wars, to polio, to childbirth, to other violent ends, or just to plain old boring time and separation, but we’d all taken a piece of that love to the grave. That first love. It had shaped us all. . . . Someone you had failed to always be there for, like you’d sworn you would, sworn best friends forever and ever, two halves of the same heart, unable to survive without the other. Someone who you hadn’t been able to help, in the end. There was no name for that mixture of grief and guilt and shame.\n\n—Annie HarTnett, Unlikely Animals\n\nThe Ghosts of Maple Street Cemetery\n\nThe Greek chorus of the buried folks at Maple Street Cemetery was, in my opinion, the best part of Unlikely Animals. They cheered on the characters from afar, but they also appreciated those unseen, smaller moments that make up a life.\n\nThe ghosts on Maple Street had rules to abide by. They couldn’t meddle in the affairs of the living:\n\nThe first rule is, of course, No Meddling, and if you meddle too much your spirit can explode. A gone-in-a-flash type of thing. A bright light, a puff of smoke, a slight lingering stench. The second rule explains the Importance of Caring for the People of Everton. If you stop caring about the events of the living, you’re in direct violation of the rules of our cemetery, and your soul shrivels up before it disappears, like a browning, withering houseplant. . . . We try our best not to meddle. Some of our rules are silly, added over the years, rules like No Lawn Games and No Evil-Doing and No Unnecessary Singing, but we take those first two rules as seriously as we can.\n\n—Annie Hartnett, Unlikely Animals\n\nThe Historical Retellings of Naturalist Ernest Harold Baynes\n\nAnother part of the Unlikely Animals summary that makes this book so charming is the selected excerpts and photographs of naturalist Ernest Harold Baynes (b. 1868–d. 1925).\n\nHe was known as the “real-life Doctor Doolittle of New Hampshire,” and his wife Louise and all of their eccentric stories of caring for wild animals.\n\nI strongly recommend reading the author’s note at the end of book, which details how this story came to be. I have such immense respect for Annie Hartnett’s process!\n\nClive becomes enamored with his ghost friend and begins to take on some of his earthly habits, like caring for Rasputin the fox and Moses the dog.\n\nMy Unlikely Animals review, at its heart, is that this is such a tender, enchanting story, and I have to say Annie Hartnett’s wild talent has the ability to make you fall in love with this small town and its ordinary miracles.\n\nFavorite Quotes from Unlikely Animals by Annie Hartnett\n\nNot knowing what happens next and the fear associated with the not-knowing, that uncertainty and anticipations is what makes us human.\n\n—Annie Hartnett, Unlikely Animals\n\nAnticipatory grief, it’s called, when you’re sad about something that hasn’t happened yet. Oh man, we thought at Maple Street, how we missed the excruciating pain of being alive.\n\n—Annie Hartnett, Unlikely Animals\n\nThat’s why we like living with animals so much; they exhibit their joy so outwardly, remind us how to be better alive.\n\n—annie Hartnett, Unlikely Animals\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Unlikely Animals\n\nWhat is the book Unlikely Animals about?\n\nUnlikely Animals is about a natural-born healer named Emma who finds herself back at home in her small town as her father is dying of a brain tumor.
