        "text": "ReadPlus\n\n“A delightful story of taking steps to solve a problem, the story also promotes environmental concerns as insects including butterflies and bees are becoming less prevalent as the cities reduce the environment in which these animals thrive.”\n\nA Kiwi’s Book Reviews\n\n“A cute story that has valuable lessons without being preachy”\n\nThe Source Review\n\n“Arielle Li’s pictures capture the spirit of this charming story. Her city is a grim bank of drab-coloured skyscrapers, with Olivia’s balcony forming a bright beacon of flowers. She has also painted thousands of butterflies.”\n\nSunday Star Times\n\n“Her latest book helps kids understand that loneliness and the need for friendship crosses all age groups and cultural boundaries, and that a sense of community comes from the joy of nurturing nature around us and taking the time to connect with each other.”\n\nNZ Moths & Butterflies Org | Feb Newsletter 2024\n\n“The story shows children that they don’t need material objects or large properties in order to be happy; they can add a touch of magic to their lives whatever their situation may be. A great story to add to your collection!”\n\nTomorrow’s Schools Today\n\n“Butterfly Girl is a charming and sensitively illustrated book about friendship and making space for animals, even in an urban environment.”\n\nReading Time\n\n“This is a beautiful book for four- to eight-year-olds and is a timely story as we are all encouraged to create gardens to attract those beneficial and beautiful insects.”\n\nPicture Book Parents\n\n“Butterfly Girl is a story that can help young children feel positive about their capacity to manage change and to influence their own environment, an idea that is increasingly important to explore in light of the profound environmental challenges facing the world.”\n\nReading With a Chance of Tacos\n\n“I like that it’s a sense of helping others and making something bland really nice. Ten out of ten tacos!”\n\nBuzz Words\n\n“Celebrates the beauty of butterflies and nature. Butterflies are popular with children and this story is sure to be too.”\n\nKids On The Coast\n\n“This fantastic book reminds us of the beauty of adding colour to our lives, and the illustrations are so wonderfully drawn and coloured that they’ll captivate any reader. What makes this story even more remarkable is its poetic style and how it brilliantly portrays the common challenges kids face while growing up..”\n\nJust So Stories\n\n“Ashley Kwok’s text is perfectly suited to the ebb and flow of Olivia’s experience, and Arielle Li’s gorgeous pastel illustrations are exactly right for the mood of the story. Altogether, it is both charming and valuable in a teaching context as well as for pure personal enjoyment, and I highly recommend it to you for Littles from around 4 years upwards.”\n\nSunday Telegraph\n\n“This is a simple, powerful story with many themes – environment, community, friendship”\n\nBlue Wolf Reviews\n\n“At the back of the book Butterfly Girl, there is a double page spread giving tips on how to grow your own butterfly garden. It is suggested that you find a sunny spot, add colour, rocks and water and sparkle.”"
