        "text": "Two Versions – Surviving Twin Brother or Surviving Twin Sister (darker skin tones) – please use the dropdown menu to select your choice.\n\nPlease note a donation will go to The Skye High Foundation from the sale of every book.\n\nIf you are a hospital or charitable organisation and wish to order multiple copies, can you please email your request to the team – at info@lossbooks.com and we will send out an order form and discount rate card for multiple purchases.\n\nWe are UK-based but ship all over the world.\n\n‘The Story of My Purple Butterfly’ – by Kate Polley\n\nKate wrote this book, especially for The Skye High Foundation. The Foundation was set up to help families dealing with the loss of a baby who was part of a multiple birth. They created the purple butterfly cot card, which is to be placed in an incubator or cot in memory of their sibling. The cot card is used in conjunction with a poster that is placed around maternity and neonatal units, which explains the meaning of the purple butterfly. The cot card allows families the opportunity to make others around them aware of the journey they are going through.\n\nThe book, a story of hope and comfort, has been written for surviving twins, to help them to talk about and remember their twin. The purple butterfly represents the twin and is a reminder that although no longer here on earth, their twin is always around them. It is a book of love and remembrance and helps families to talk and share their feelings around loss and grief, providing a happy memory to support their loss.\n\nTo SEE INSIDE the book there is an option below the order boxes to flip through all the pages (the surviving boy twin sibling option is the example shown, but the girl surviving twin sibling is exactly the same but with baby girl images instead of the boy images)."
