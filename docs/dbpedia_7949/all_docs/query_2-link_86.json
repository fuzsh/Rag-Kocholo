        "text": "Olivia and her butterfly friends spend all of their time together, until one day everything changes, and Olivia and her mother move to an apartment in the city.\n\nOlivia is heartbroken because she doesn’t want to leave her butterfly friends behind but her mother assures her that she will make new friends in the city.\n\nWhen Olivia and her mum arrive in the city, it’s so grey and gloomy that everyone is sheltering inside. Olivia waits for new friends to come and play but no one appears.\n\nSo Olivia stands on her empty concrete apartment balcony and calls out to her butterfly friends — because they always come when she needs them. But this time, even her butterfly friends don’t appear.\n\nThen Olivia remembers that butterflies need colorful nectar plants, a puddle pool and rocks to rest their wings on, but Olivia doesn’t have a garden anymore so she decides to build a butterfly balcony garden using whatever she can find. Olivia waits and waits and waits but her butterflies stay away.\n\nJust as Olivia is about to lose hope, a gust of wind blows flowers from her balcony garden across the grey sky and onto her neighbors’ balconies. People of all ages and cultural ethnicities appear on their balconies to pick up the flowers, and Olivia suddenly knows exactly what she needs to do to attract (human and butterfly) friends.\n\nAshling Kwok is a children’s author from Sydney. She is obsessed with children’s literature and loves immersing herself in a magical world where anything is possible. When she’s not working on her manuscripts, Ashling can be found scouring local bookstores in search of inspiration. She hopes to continue to write stories that take children on a journey and hopefully touch their hearts.\n\nArielle Li is a Taiwanese–Australian illustrator based in Adelaide. She has been passionate about creating art from a young age and has been pursuing illustration as a career since 2019. When she’s not working, she enjoys long walks at the beach, chasing her cats around the house and practising Taekwondo.\n\nReadPlus\n\n“A delightful story of taking steps to solve a problem, the story also promotes environmental concerns as insects including butterflies and bees are becoming less prevalent as the cities reduce the environment in which these animals thrive.”\n\nA Kiwi’s Book Reviews\n\n“A cute story that has valuable lessons without being preachy”\n\nThe Source Review\n\n“Arielle Li’s pictures capture the spirit of this charming story. Her city is a grim bank of drab-coloured skyscrapers, with Olivia’s balcony forming a bright beacon of flowers. She has also painted thousands of butterflies.”\n\nSunday Star Times\n\n“Her latest book helps kids understand that loneliness and the need for friendship crosses all age groups and cultural boundaries, and that a sense of community comes from the joy of nurturing nature around us and taking the time to connect with each other.”\n\nNZ Moths & Butterflies Org, Feb Newsletter 2024\n\n“The story shows children that they don’t need material objects or large properties in order to be happy; they can add a touch of magic to their lives whatever their situation may be. A great story to add to your collection!”\n\nTomorrow’s Schools Today\n\n“Butterfly Girl is a charming and sensitively illustrated book about friendship and making space for animals, even in an urban environment.”\n\nReading Time\n\n“This is a beautiful book for four- to eight-year-olds and is a timely story as we are all encouraged to create gardens to attract those beneficial and beautiful insects.”\n\nPicture Book Parents\n\n“Butterfly Girl is a story that can help young children feel positive about their capacity to manage change and to influence their own environment, an idea that is increasingly important to explore in light of the profound environmental challenges facing the world.”\n\nReading With a Chance of Tacos\n\n“I like that it’s a sense of helping others and making something bland really nice. Ten out of ten tacos!”\n\nBuzz Words\n\n“Celebrates the beauty of butterflies and nature. Butterflies are popular with children and this story is sure to be too.”\n\nKids On The Coast\n\n“This fantastic book reminds us of the beauty of adding colour to our lives, and the illustrations are so wonderfully drawn and coloured that they’ll captivate any reader. What makes this story even more remarkable is its poetic style and how it brilliantly portrays the common challenges kids face while growing up..”\n\nJust So Stories\n\n“Ashley Kwok’s text is perfectly suited to the ebb and flow of Olivia’s experience, and Arielle Li’s gorgeous pastel illustrations are exactly right for the mood of the story. Altogether, it is both charming and valuable in a teaching context as well as for pure personal enjoyment, and I highly recommend it to you for Littles from around 4 years upwards.”\n\nSunday Telegraph\n\n“This is a simple, powerful story with many themes – environment, community, friendship”\n\nBlue Wolf Reviews\n\n“At the back of the book Butterfly Girl, there is a double page spread giving tips on how to grow your own butterfly garden. It is suggested that you find a sunny spot, add colour, rocks and water and sparkle.”\n\nArmadillo Magazine | active book blog\n\n“a pleasant inspiring read which would make a good addition to your nature themed library.”"
