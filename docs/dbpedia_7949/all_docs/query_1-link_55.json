        "text": "Sonya Louise Hartnett (born March 23, 1968, in Melbourne) is an Australian author of fiction for adults, young adults, and children. She has been called \"the finest Australian writer of her generation\". For her career contribution to \"children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense\" Hartnett won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award from the Swedish Arts Council in 2008, the biggest prize in children's literature.\n\nShe has published books as Sonya Hartnett, S. L. Hartnett, and Cameron S. Redfern.\n\nPersonal life and education\n\nHartnett was born March 23, 1968, in Melbourne, Australia to Philip Joseph and Virginia Mary Hartnett. In 1988, she received a Bachelor of Arts from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.\n\nCareer\n\nHartnett was thirteen years old when she wrote her first novel and fifteen when it was published for the adult market in Australia, Trouble All the Way (Adelaide: Rigby Publishers, 1984). For years she has written about one novel annually. Although she is often classified as a writer of young adult fiction, Hartnett does not consider this label entirely accurate: \"I've been perceived as a young adult writer whereas my books have never really been young adult novels in the sort of classic sense of the idea.\" She believes the distinction is not so important in Britain as in her native land.\n\nAccording to the National Library of Australia, \"The novel for which Hartnett has achieved the most critical (and controversial) acclaim was Sleeping Dogs\". .....\n\nMany of Hartnett's books have been published in the UK and in North America. For Thursday's Child (2000, UK 2002), she won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. In 2008 she won the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award which is administered by the Swedish Arts Council.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nIn 2000 and 2003, The Sydney Morning Herald named Hartnett one of their Young Novelists of the Year.\n\nIn 2008, Hartnett received the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, which annually honours an author of children's books whose \"a body of work known for its unflinching focus on the toughest aspects of life.\"\n\nIn 2016, Shelf Awareness included Golden Boys on their list of the best teen novels of the year."
