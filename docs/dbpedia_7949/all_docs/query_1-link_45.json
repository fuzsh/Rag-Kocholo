Harnett\n\nThomas Dunne Books: St. Martin's Press\n\nLONGLISTED FOR 2016 INT'L DUBLIN LITERARY AWARD\n\nJOHN GARDNER FICTION BOOK AWARD WINNER\n\nAPPALACHIAN BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD WINNER\n\n\"THE BEST NOVEL OF 2014.\"~PROVIDENCE JOURNAL\n\n#1 AUDIBLE BEST SELLER\n\nAMAZON BEST SELLER\n\nGOODREADS BOOK GROUP WORTHY TITLE\n\nLIBRARY JOURNAL's \"Debuts with Buzz\" Selection\n\nSAN DIEGO MAGAZINE's '5 Books to Read This Month'\n\nBookBrowse Top 2015 Book Club Reccomendation\n\nNYC Irish Arts Center 2015 Book Day Pick\n\nMore press for The Hollow Ground...\n\nInspired by real-life events, the underground mine fires ravaging a Pennsylvania coal town lead eleven-year-old Brigid Howley to make a grisly discovery in a long-abandoned bootleg mine shaft. In the aftermath, old secrets threaten to prove just as dangerous to the Howleys as the burning, hollow ground beneath their feet.\n\nAn extraordinary debut with an atmospheric, voice-driven narrative and an indelible sense of place. Lovers of literary fiction will find in Harnett’s young, determined protagonist a character as heartbreakingly captivating as Scout Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\n“The Hollow Ground is a coming-of-age novel, a murder mystery, a family saga, and an American tragedy of an environmentally and economically devastated region. But most of all, it’s a painful and powerful story of love and survival.” — David Gates, Pulitzer Prize finalist\n\n\"A grand achievement, a story fierce in its honesty about family love and betrayal.” — Maureen Howard, National Book Critics Circle Award winner\n\n\"...sure to become a classic.\" -Fresh Fiction"
