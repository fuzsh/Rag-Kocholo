What an absolutely devastatingly gorgeous heartbreaking stunning book!!!… One of the best debut novels I’ve ever read… I was devastated by the end… Once it sucks you in then you’re not coming out until the very last page. Absolutely unputdownable!!!’ Bookworm86, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI blamed my son for the death of my daughter…\n\nFrail butterfly enthusiast Maggie Muir has lived a lonely life in her huge remote house on the Cornish cliffs for many years. Once a mother with two beautiful children, the sudden death of Maggie’s daughter, forever a little girl in her fairy nightdress, ripped the family apart and caused her son Lucas to flee to the other side of the world. But now Maggie is dying and there is something she needs her son to know.\n\nAs Maggie grows increasingly frail, twenty-five-year-old Erin, who has fled London with a broken heart, arrives to take care of her. Maggie begs Erin to help her find Lucas, who now lives in a far-away place of searing heat and pearly sands.\n\nBut when Erin tracks Lucas down, it quickly becomes clear that he is hiding something too. What really happened the night his sister died, when a little boy with freckles on his nose made a terrible mistake? And if Erin untangles the web of deceit between mother and son, does she risk learning something unforgiveable about the person she has come to love very deeply?\n\nA heart-wrenching but uplifting page-turner about a family ripped apart by guilt and lies, and forgiveness. Set against the storms of the Cornish coast and silvery tropical sands of a distant paradise, The Butterfly Garden is a story of love, loss and letting go. Fans of Jojo Moyes, Harriet Evans and Lucinda Riley will be gripped.\n\nWhat everyone’s saying about The Butterfly Garden:\n\n‘Had me hooked from the start.
