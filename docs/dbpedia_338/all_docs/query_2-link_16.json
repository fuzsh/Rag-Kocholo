        "text": "West Valley College (theater) sits on the traditional and unceded homeland of the Tamien Nation and Muwekma Ohlone peoples. We acknowledge that these peoples never ceded from these lands and we as uninvited guests see that we now reside on land they took care of.\n\nWe recognize that we benefit from the land that was taken from them. Our nation-state was founded upon their lands and continues to enact exclusions and erasures of Indigenous peoples.\n\nThis acknowledgment demonstrates a promise to start the dismantling of ongoing legacies of settler colonialism and continuing to do so. We also recognize and acknowledge the many Indeginous Nations who continue to resist, live, and uphold their sacred relations across their lands.\n\nWe wish to recognize and pay respects to the Ancestors, Elders, and Relatives of the Tamien Nation, Muwekma Ohlone communities and by affirming their sovereign rights as first peoples."
