        "text": "June 27, 2024\n\nMedia Contacts:\n\nDr. Diana Garza, vice president of student affairs, dgarza@wvc.edu, 509-682-6805\n\nDr. Jennifer Korfiatis, interim public information officer, jkorfiatis@wvc.edu, 509-682-6650\n\nAracely Mendoza has been named as the interim director of Wenatchee Valley College Concurrent Enrollment Programs. She will replace Maria Christina Monroe, whose last day was June 14.\n\nMendoza, who has worked at Wenatchee Valley College since November 2021, was the educational planner for Concurrent Enrollment Programs before becoming the interim director. She was also a Running Start student at WVC, and Maria Christina Monroe was her advisor.\n\n“It really is a full circle moment for me from being a student to a navigator and now an interim in this position,” Mendoza said.\n\nAfter she graduated from WVC with an associate of arts and sciences transfer degree, she transferred to Washington State University, where she earned a dual degree in anthropology and digital technology.\n\n“I have always enjoyed working with students and helping my community, and I hope to continue by working closely with our partners in our school districts,” Mendoza said.\n\n“Aracely has been a participant of our program as a high school student and staff. Her insider perspective is an excellent foundation to step into the interim role and ensure we have limited interruption to our services,” said Dr. Diana Garza, vice president of student affairs.\n\nWVC’s Concurrent Enrollment Programs include Running Start, Career and Technical Education, and College in the High School. All three programs allow students to simultaneously earn high school credit and college credit, accelerating them through higher education and into their chosen careers. WVC partners with 19 school districts for the CTE program and 7 districts for the CHS program. Running Start served 19 districts this spring.\n\n###\n\nWenatchee Valley College enriches North Central Washington by serving educational and cultural needs of communities and residents throughout the service area. The college is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion for all students and employees and provides high-quality transfer, liberal arts, professional/technical, basic skills and continuing education for students of diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds.
