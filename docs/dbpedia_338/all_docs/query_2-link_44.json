        "text": "If someone you know is being abused, they need your support. They may not ask for it directly, but if you express your concern, it may help them to break the silence and seek assistance. The victim may be experiencing shame, isolation, embarrassment, and denial of the severity of their situation. Many victims say fear, shame and embarrassment are powerful barriers to their seeking help. Let the victim know you care and that you are concerned about their safety. Gently ask direct questions about the person’s situation. If they do not want to talk, try again another time. If they disclose information about their situation:\n\nListen to what the person says. Give the person time and space to talk without interruptions.\n\nBelieve what the person says. Some situations may sound different than anything you may have experienced. Let the person know that you believe them and that you believe the violence will not go away on its own, but will only get worse. If you were ever abused, share your experiences; this may help the person feel that they are not alone.\n\nDo not blame the victim for the abuse. Questions like, “What did you do to provoke him?” put the responsibility for the abuse on the victim instead of the person who was abusive. Explain that they are not alone, and that the abuse is not their fault. Explain that there is no excuse for domestic violence.\n\nDo not discriminate against the person by judging, blaming, or assuming stereotypes that explain away the abuse.\n\nKeep what they tell you confidential. Shame and embarrassment are barriers for victims seeking assistance, but fear of what the batterer may do to them for telling about the abuse is a deadly risk this victim may be taking to tell you their story. Keep them safe – don’t talk about it without their permission.\n\nAllow the person to make his or her own decisions. Don’t rush to give opinions or tell the person what to do. Offer options if you are familiar with options. If you are not sure about options, help the person seek the assistance of a domestic violence advocate. Always respect the person’s right to make their own decisions. The most empowering thing you can do is honor that right. Whatever you do, do not give up.\n\nYou may belong to one or more community organizations that can take a stand against domestic violence. These organizations can be formal or informal and can include such entities as: faith based organizations, employment based organizations, private businesses, youth groups, sports organizations, civic organizations, senior centers, social groups, home owners groups, community watch groups, special interest groups, informal neighborhood groups, parenting groups, school based groups, or any other group you connect with. Any place where people come together for a common purpose is an opportunity to educate and raise awareness about an issue that affects us all. A group or community-based approach to ending violence is a very effective way of reaching out to a greater number of people. Resources, time and creative energy can be combined to create changes in attitudes and behaviors. People working together can send a community wide message that there’s no excuse for domestic violence and it is our business.\n\nHow you can get your group started:\n\nContact your local domestic violence program and invite them to come and speak to your group. Learn more about the issue and what the needs are for your community.\n\nDetermine a focus for your response. You may choose to reach out to a particular group of people such as people of color, people with disabilities, people in later life, the gay and lesbian community, men, healthcare workers, clergy, teens, parents, or other groups.\n\nDetermine your message. If you plan to reach potential victims, you may want to focus your message on what domestic violence is and where they can go for assistance. If you are reaching out to potential responders to domestic violence, your message may be that domestic violence is your business.\n\nDetermine how to get your message to the group you are focusing on. There are many ways to reach people ranging from word of mouth to extensive media campaigns. Some simple suggestions and sample public awareness materials are included in this packet."
