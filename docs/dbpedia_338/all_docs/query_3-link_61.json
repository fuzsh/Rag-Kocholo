        "text": "By Charlene Lattea, WVU Online | Wednesday, May 17, 2023\n\nThinking of earning a business degree? Explore how much business majors make and where there is the most growth and opportunity in the years ahead.\n\nWhat kind of salary would you like to make?\n\nTo get the most out of your career, business is one of the most versatile and high-paying professions you can go into. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), business and financial professionals earned a median annual salary of $76,570 as of May 2021.\n\nBusiness is one of the most popular degrees in the United States because business majors across the board make a higher salary than workers in any other occupation.\n\nFor this reason, the job market in business has become very competitive, with many jobs now requiring even more education.\n\nIs A Business Degree Right For You?\n\nJust because business is a good degree that pays well, that doesn’t mean it is the right degree for you.\n\nTo figure that out, you have to consider your own interests that may translate well into a business career, as well as your interest in learning the skills that a business degree has to offer.\n\nAfter all, you will be making a significant investment of both time and money if you decide to pursue a business degree.\n\nIt may take four years or even longer to get the kind of business education you want and years of experience to reach the salary level you desire.\n\nTo maximize your investment, you should decide in advance what things you enjoy doing and how they will make you happy working in business.\n\nOnly by doing this kind of evaluation can you decide whether or not a business degree is worth it to you.\n\nNew technology and a shift in the work culture throughout the world are other reasons business majors need more knowledge and experience, especially with the technology that has been developed in just the past few years, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, data analytics, blockchain development, cloud computing, user-centric design, and more.\n\nToday’s business degrees will provide you with this training, and they can open up a world of opportunities for you.\n\nHow Much Do Business Majors Make?\n\nWhen we talk about high-salary jobs, it is always a range of salaries that depend on many factors. Also, some business majors, such as an MBA, might get you into a higher salary bracket more quickly than others.\n\nWhen looking at potential careers and related salaries, remember to look at projected job growth because this will make a big difference in the long run.\n\nLet’s look at some starting salaries, as of May 2023, for popular high-paying jobs within the business field, along with salaries for more senior positions that you could aspire to in the future.\n\nAccountant – As of 2023, the entry-level salary for an accountant in the United States is approximately $57,031 per year. With ten years of experience, you can expect to make $70,817.\n\nFinancial Analysts – As of 2023, the median entry-level salary for financial analysts averages $68,411 per year, but with ten years of experience, it raises to $87,947.\n\nSales Manager – In May 2023, the average entry-level salary for a sales manager is $78,450, but with ten years of experience, it raises to $92,864.\n\nAs you can see, experience makes a big difference in your expected earnings, but so do many other factors. Read on to find out what other things influence salary ranges and earning potential.\n\nFactors That Influence Earning Potential in Business\n\nThere are many factors that will determine the salary ranges and earning potential you will encounter as a business professional, both early in your career and later when you take on senior status.\n\nAs you think about what kind of salary you could make, consider the following factors:\n\n1. Specialization\n\nMarketing, data analytics, cybersecurity, finance, human resource management, healthcare management, and economics are some of the areas of specialization that are popular in business and pay the most right now.\n\n2. Years of experience\n\nAs we discussed earlier, projected job growth and the number of years you have been working in a career field will make a big difference in your salary.\n\n3. Job sector\n\nSome of these include manufacturing, healthcare, education, online services, and finance/banking. In general, working with investments and accounts leads to higher pay, but you should take into account what job sectors are growing right now, and there are many new opportunities available.\n\n4. Location\n\nSome of the highest-paying jobs for business majors have traditionally been located on the East or West Coast, specifically in California, Washington D.C., Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. This is also changing as job seekers look for a better work-life balance, and new technology allows workers to be located anywhere in the world.\n\n5. Work environment\n\nJobs that require long hours and extended travel and are fast-paced usually pay a lot more. In these positions, you will probably also be interacting with top management as well as influential clients.\n\n6. Job performance\n\nAre you ambitious, able to handle your workload, and always asking for more? Do you represent your organization well, do good in the community, and take on outside projects as part of the team? If so, you are performing at a high level which will also get you a higher salary.\n\n7. Your education level\n\nPossible degrees in the business field include associate degree, bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or MBA, and doctorate. The higher the degree, the higher your salary is likely to be.\n\nThis will also determine the types of jobs you’re qualified to do. An MBA holder has different job opportunities than someone with an associate degree.\n\n8. License and Certification\n\nThis is required in some business fields and proves that you have the qualifications to meet your professional obligations. Some of these include certified supply chain professional (CSCP); certified public accountant (CPA); salesforce administrator certification (SAC); certified financial planner (CFP); and certified financial analyst (CFA).\n\nYour education level, along with any licensure or certification, are among the most important factors guaranteeing a high salary.\n\nAccording to Indeed (as of May 2023), the average salary for accountants in the United States is $61,508 per year in the United States.\n\nIf you become a certified public accountant (CPA), you can expect to earn about 30% more, and if you become a certified internal auditor, you can expect to earn approximately 48% more.\n\n15 Highest-Paying Business Majors\n\nThese are some of the highest-paying business majors, with the average salaries.\n\n#1 Marketing\n\nMarketing Manager Average Salary: $73,240\n\nAverage Low Salary: $46,280\n\nAverage High Salary: $115,904\n\nPopular jobs in marketing: marketing research analyst, marketing manager, social media director, brand manager, advertising and promotions manager, public relations manager, search marketing strategist\n\nA marketing degree gives students analytical skills in product merchandising, consumer behavior and effective campaign organization.\n\nThey learn how to gather and interpret consumer information in order to make strategic decisions with current or new products.
