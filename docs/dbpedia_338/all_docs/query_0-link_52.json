With our new campaign — Unlocking Democracy — we’re calling on people like you, who share our vision for elections that are fair and free, to help us ensure California is a place where the promise of democracy is realized for everyone.\n\nEvery dollar helps us unlock democracy in California. Please give what you can today.\n\nOver the last two years, we’ve fought to counter the voter disenfranchisement that stems from structured misinformation. We need your continued support to make sure voters can wield their democratic power.\n\nTogether, we:\n\nDeveloped and launched a full scale Get Out the Vote effort for the 2021 Governor Recall Election. With text banking, postcards, targeted social media and voter education placed in over 20 in-language Asian and Hispanic media outlets across the state, we reached more than 1.5 million historically under-resourced voters in California in nine languages.\n\nCreated and supported both Voter’s Edge, an online ballot planning tool available in English and Spanish, and the Easy Voter Guide, a community-reviewed guide to California’s ballots produced in five languages. Together, these non-partisan tools give voters understandable information and increase their knowledge and confidence in voting.\n\nReached more than six million people with our Youth Get Out the Vote campaign using TikTok and Snapchat to meet young voters where they are and get them to cast their ballots. This campaign won four national awards of excellence from the Public Relations Society of America, and two national awards of excellence from the Hispanic Public Relations Society.\n\nWith your help, we’ve supported more than nine million voters in confidently casting ballots in the past two years. Now that the assaults on our democracy are stronger than ever, we have to start working right now to support even more voters in 2022."
