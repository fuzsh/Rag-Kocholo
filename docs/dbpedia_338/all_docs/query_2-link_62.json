        "text": "​The Center for Women Veterans has developed a survey designed to help understand why women veterans are NOT accessing their benefits and services. The survey is anonymous and takes less than 5 minutes to complete​.\n\nFor more information: ​Center for Women Veterans - Survey​\n\n​Through the Federal VA, veterans answer a series of questions to get customized step-by-step instructions on how to apply for a discharge upgrade or correction.\n\nIf your application goes through and your discharge is upgraded, you’ll be eligible for the VA benefits you earned during your period of service.\n\nApply for a Discharge Upgrade​\n\n“I Am Not Invisible” is a remarkable exhibition featuring 20 portraits of Oregon women military veterans. The project is the brainchild of PSU Veterans Resource Center Director Felita Singleton and ODVA Women Veterans Coordinator Elizabeth Estabrooks. After debuting Feb 24 at the Portland Art Museum, the exhibit began a traveling campaign, and will be appearing at various locations throughout the state.\n\nFor more information: I Am Not Invisible​\n\nTo Request IANI Exhibit: IANI Exhibit Request Form​\n\n​The Center for Women Veterans’ (CWV) mission is to monitor and coordinate VA’s administration of health care, benefits, services, and programs for women Veterans.\n\nThey serve as an advocate for cultural transformation and to raise awareness of the responsibility to treat women Veterans with dignity and respect to #BringWomenVeteransHome2VA.\n\nFor More Information: Center for Women Veterans (CWV)​\n\nAccording to the VA, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 8 men experience some form of sexual assault, harassment or rape on active duty, and according to the Oregon Women’s Health Study, 59% of Oregon women veterans surveyed stated they experienced some form of sexual assault (including harassment) while on active duty. Further, some research suggests those identifying as LGBTQ are disproportionately exposed to military sexual trauma.\n\nIf you experienced any form of sexual assault, harassment, rape, or domestic violence while on active duty and still suffer mental or physical health problems today, you are eligible to receive counseling and services at the VA, regardless of discharge status, time in service, or disability status. You may also be eligible for service-connected disability benefits as a result of these experiences.\n\nIf you have not filed for benefits or you filed and were denied and would like to learn more about the changed rules regarding filing for these benefits, please contact your local VSO​ or the Oregon Women Veterans Coordinator.\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nOregon Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence\n\nVA Services for Military Sexual Trauma\n\nMST and IPV Coordinators:\n\nPortland\n\nGuy Tyler, LCSW\n\n(360) 696-4061 x31591\n\nGuy.Tyler@va.gov\n\nAysha Crain, LCSW\n\n(503) 220-3476\n\nAysha.Crain2@va.gov\n\nRoseburg\n\nTamera Dreier, MSW, LCSW\n\n(541) 440-1000 x45199\n\nTamera.Dreier@va.gov\n\nWhite City\n\nBrynne Johannsen, PhD\n\n(541) 826-2111 x3046\n\nBrynne.Johannsen@va.gov\n\nWalla Walla\n\nJennifer Oetman, LICSW\n\n(509) 525-5200 x26976\n\nJennifer.Oetman@va.gov\n\nBoise\n\nWendy Coffman, LCSW, LMFT\n\n(208) 422-1000 x4201\n\nWendy.Coffman@va.gov\n\nWomen Veterans Program Managers advise and advocate for women veterans and can help coordinates all the services you may need, from primary care to specialized care for chronic conditions or reproductive health.\n\nChoose a location below to be directed to the webpage for the Women Veterans Program Manager at each site.\n\nPortland VA Health Care System\n\nRoseburg VA Health Care System\n\nSouthern Oregon Rehabilitation Center & Clinics (SORCC)\n\nWalla Walla VAMC\n\nBoise VAMC​\n\n​For more information: Federal VA: Women Veterans Program Managers"
