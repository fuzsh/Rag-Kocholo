I am honored to be a representative of my neighbors and community in our state government.\n\n2022 “Round-table Talk” with Representative Weight … published in the West Valley City Journal\n\nNOVEMBER 2022 (Page TBD) — Your Vote for Representative People in Utah House District 26 are smart. They watched for ballots to arrive and are learning about candidates before returning ballots or voting on November 8. Voters are asking great questions about background and viewpoints. They are interested in priorities and principles that guide a representative’s work. I’m excited to talk about what it actually means to listen and to serve.\n\nI am not new to public service. For over 32 years as a teacher, I was oriented in my work and purpose to the young people in my classroom and in the community. Their parents and I worked as partners to support students in setting goals and achieving them. As a representative, I am still oriented to families and safe, rich learning environments.\n\nI am a process person. It’s meaningful to me to assure good information, thoughtful consideration, and purposeful decisions. Those steps are critical in reaching positive outcomes and necessary for accountability to the people who place trust in representative leadership. Political agendas invalidate process.\n\nI vote for futures. Today we have better and broader views to provide beneficial direction and decision-making for the next generations. Parents and grandparents in House District 26 are thoughtful of the opportunities and challenges their young people will see. My job in representing Utahns means looking forward with insightful questions and strong ideas.\n\nThank you, residents in House District 26, for your time, observations, and investment in our kids, neighborhoods, and state! My door is always open.\n\nOCTOBER 2022 (Page 15) — Some Voter Basics Our ballots arrive in October. Then, we’ll have about three weeks to decide our votes. From my experience in teaching at Hunter High and Cyprus High, I know how strongly people care about the issues that directly affect their households and neighborhoods. People believe in hard work and doing their share, and they expect elected leaders to work for policies that build secure, prosperous communities.\n\nI’m impressed that most voters are really common-sense thinkers, ready to learn about this year’s state and county candidates and ask good questions about what we can do together. So what are the topics?\n\nEducation – People want good teachers and are shocked to learn that they are paid much less than other professionals with the same qualifications. Yes, salaries for teachers and para educators are critical, and what also makes a huge difference is our realization and respect for what they do every day for every child in their classroom. Just like us, they are interested in good discussions and ideas to solve problems.\n\nTaxes – In general, every level of government has some taxing authority along with the responsibility to account for how revenue is spent. Specifically, in our neighborhoods, people want fair taxes and recognize our state tax on food is unfair and unnecessary. Specifically, on the issue of accountability, the recent audit raises great questions about state tax dollars going to the Utah Inland Port, important in all our local discussions about economy, air quality, health risks, housing, and our kids’ futures.\n\nExtremism – Utahns are problem solvers by nature! We believe in sharing ideas, noting common goals, and working toward agreements. We know that ideas that divide people are destructive, and we want leaders who coordinate productive discussions.\n\nThank you for your active role in our community. I look forward to learning more about your ideas!\n\nSEPTEMBER 2022 (Page 10) — Serving Utah & Utahns Still true in 2022: Just as when I first ran for a Utah House seat, my job is to work on legislation to benefit people and communities. Still true: Coming from a career in which I focused on young people and their acquisition of knowledge and skills to support their future aspirations, I understand many of the challenges for them and their families. Still true: My views on state policy must be shaped by conversations I have with constituents, research that is reliable and unbiased, and recommendations from those with education and experience in a policy area. I value informed discussion.\n\nNew in 2022: More individuals believe they are more important than the community they live in – their neighborhood, school network, city, state. More individuals believe that numerous “others” are focused on hurting them. More individuals share sensational stories about how powerless our values and votes have become. A more politicized state government exists because of these beliefs and stories.\n\nMore true in 2022: Our individual votes have more power than ever – voters have more access, more initiative, and more awareness. We hear a lot of judgmental statements and see behaviors based on sanctimonious views, BUT we are generally troubled by them, the hatefulness, the purpose to create chaos. We have concerns and questions, our common sense is strong, and we really do have common interests.\n\nServing you in our state House of Representatives is about laws that preserve our freedoms and a place where we can see a healthy, prosperous future for our kids. In this “political” position, my job is to invite valid, practical contributions of ideas and direction from various views and experiences. In 2022, I will hear the divisive rants and insistent stances, but I will continue to endorse and work with genuine interest in building together.\n\nAUGUST 2022 (Page 5) — Politics vs. Problem Solving No wonder people are frustrated about voting choices these days. We expect to learn about different solutions to issues faced by our family or neighborhood or school. Instead, we’re bombarded with declarations about the evils or ideals of a political group or person. We’re given diatribes instead of discussions and pertinent ideas. Even talking about our Constitution often gets diverted from the framework for problem-solving leadership it provides.\n\nWe are left with the same issues and interests in quality education; safe homes and neighborhoods; affordability of food, housing, healthcare; jobs that provide opportunity and security; good quality air and water in our kids’ futures.\n\nI propose some questions in candidate meetings to focus on topics that directly affect us: “What do we know?” “What more do we need to understand?” “What steps can we each take to improve the situation?” Instead of looking to one person to define and direct everything, each person is valuable for contributing and deciding. We all benefit from the outcome, and we all grow during the process. These are questions and concepts I hold as your state representative and why I want to continue working together.\n\nI’m excited about conversations I am having with people as this year’s election cycle revs up. I’m learning more of your concerns but also your ideas. I’m hearing thoughtful possibilities as well as valid complaints. I’m listening to neighbors express strong points for finding solutions. I am the candidate for representing you at the State Capitol, and together, we make a smart, community-oriented, and issue-focused force.\n\nA good political platform creates opportunities and invites responsible contributions for problem solving. Thanks to all who contact me about your observations and ideas!\n\nJULY 2022 (Page 10) — Campaign Responsibility My mother, an active voter all her adult life, recently told me she has never seen the kind of hatefully politicized environment we have now. During the primary campaign in her town, she received the expected information from candidates, but then got mailers with strong messages against one candidate. The point was simply to distract or confuse voters. No dummy, my mother realized the emotional exaggerations and obvious distortions and was even more secure with her vote for the candidate being defamed. Additionally, she has a new level of disgust for anonymous misinformation and those who distribute it – people we agree are cowards.\n\nAs the campaign season for the November elections begins, I am enthusiastic about additional meetings with neighbors to hear their views and share ideas. Just as I see the successes and concerns in my part of the community, I’m grateful for others who point out issues in their neighborhoods. Our system of government is designed to inform a selected representative about needs and suggestions in an open dialogue for problem solving. There is no place in this process for undermining the integrity and trust that have served to build community, economy, and networks that benefit us all.\n\nPart of every political campaign is candidates’ descriptions of what we believe about government and areas that government influences. I ran for office because I observed state policy effects on my work with students in my classroom. My political experience has showed me the importance of everyone’s viewpoints and participation to improve situations. The most valuable commitment I make in my campaign and my service is to the positive, truthful process of listening, studying, and considering ideas. Thank you for bringing your voice, or as inscribed in our state House, “vox populi.”\n\nJUNE 2022 (Page 10) — Elections 2022 Elections again? Yes. Some people are realizing that voting is (always has been) an annual exercise. Different elections happen in different cycles. Last year, West Valley City elected new council members and a new mayor. This year, there are elections for state legislators, some county positions, and various school board seats. We’re also watching a statewide primary and general election for one of Utah’s U.S. senators. These officials serve two-, four-, or six-year terms, and primaries add to the sense of perpetual elections. It’s helpful that, even with possible exasperation, we all remind each other which elections are coming up, who is running for what office, and to cast our votes!\n\nLike mine, all 75 seats of the Utah House of Representatives are up for election in 2022. Like me, most representatives are running for re-election. The focus in June will be on primary elections like that one for U.S. Senate. There is a list of all election cycle deadlines at Got-Vote.org, but if you are a registered Republican, you will receive a mail-in ballot soon or can vote in person later in the month. The election date is June 28, and after the July 12 official announcement, we’ll know the candidates for that and all the general elections.\n\nEvery year’s elections are important, and many consider the closer the position to the neighborhood, the more effect it has. For me, I rely on neighbors and shared ideas to guide my votes in the legislature. In my appointed roles in commissions and committees and as a proud spokesperson of WVC, understanding your experiences is vital!\n\nI look forward to talking with you this summer, as always, and I encourage you to include this year’s elections in your conversations and activities!\n\nMAY 2022 (Page 16) — Walking For me, involvement in politics is about people and what I can do to make connections. My early interest in government processes led to my desire to understand the relationship between “the people” and “the government.” After all, people make the choices that result in their governing bodies, and it’s people who can best help elected leaders understand their community, neighborhood, and household needs. As a teacher, I saw the effects of elected officials’ decisions on my job, my students’ learning, and their families’ lives. I worked to inform elected leaders about situations and circumstances all educators observe every day. Now, my role as a state representative is to understand the experiences of my neighbors, their jobs and workplace conditions, the stability of their households, the conditions and opportunities at their kids’ schools, the dynamics of our community’s economic health, and environmental qualities that affect all of those. I’ve been on both sides of making connections. So I walk.\n\nI walk at the fitness center, among others on the track, playing pickle ball or basketball, working out with weights or on equipment. I walk in neighborhoods, noting the homes and yards and pets and projects of the people who live around me. I see them leaving for work, holding kids’ hands on their way to school, or cleaning out garages, and I stop to talk about their garden or new driveway or broken fence … or why they’re unable to walk or work or buy food.\n\nWalking maintains my connections to the people I represent and the realities in their lives. It gives me time to think about what they tell me and what I can do to assure opportunities, safety, futures, and freedom. For me, politics isn’t about partisan views, it’s about working together for our neighbors and community. I look forward to seeing you on a walk sometime and learning your thoughts and ideas or just passing some good time together.\n\nAPRIL 2022 — Legislation for Community and Common Good Legislators get ideas for changes to laws from a variety of sources – constituent issues, local leaders, students, organizations. During the 2022 legislative session, we considered bills on a wide range of topics, from designating a state crustacean to water metering to our annual budget. For proper process and responsible voting, we rely on and are grateful for experts’ reports, dialog with those who best understand complexities of issues, and from communication we receive from constituents. Proper process and responsible voting also require our decisions to be based on reliable, unbiased information, with thought and consideration of whole communities – interdependent networks like neighborhoods, school communities, workforce groups, as well as municipalities, counties, or special districts. The challenge for all representative leaders has always been to balance the needs and rights of individuals with those of the communities we are all part of. The “common good” is a strong theme and required commitment in our work for good policy.\n\nAn additional level of challenge these days comes when we receive messages from a few individuals who make insistent demands with little or no regard for others, often with little regard even for discussion. In a recent email, following others with non-negotiable expectations, no reliable research, and no reflection on community impact, the writer accuses lawmakers of being “part of the wrecking crew brought in to bring down this great nation” – pretty harsh judgement with no thought toward legislators’ care and consideration.\n\nIt’s true that each of the 104 legislators brings an individual view to the job, but we all pledge to act in the best interest of all the people of Utah. Thank you for recognizing how meaningful that is to us as we note the range of circumstances and aspirations across the state.\n\nMARCH 2022 — Grateful for Conversations During the legislative session, some bills and topics ignite mass email campaigns. Often organizations supply text and automated systems so individuals can simply click and send, whether or not they have read or understood the email with their name attached. Sometimes organizations send emails in the names of people on lists compiled on a related issue, without the knowledge or consent of those people on the new topic. Another mass email strategy is to broadcast information to convince people that a bill must be passed or stopped as a matter of critical importance, sometimes in almost threatening tones. Then we legislators receive messages making imperative appeals or demands, sometimes with implied threats.\n\nWhat is most effective and welcomed are messages that respectfully describe your views and requests about a bill or issue. Like most people, when we receive a short note with specific, reasonable ideas, we naturally remember and value the message. We appreciate the invitation to an exchange of thoughts and considerations. We want to support you even if we have different views on the topic.\n\nWhen the 2022 session concludes on March 5, various organizations will publish their ratings of how our legislative votes align with their positions. Simple. Too simple. Votes on bills must be “yes” or “no,” but the evaluation of various points of a bill and related concepts is important. The thoughtful conversations about the issues are important. The interactions among people who care about policy decisions and the considerations behind them are deeply meaningful these days. I’m grateful for the calls and emails that come with thought and tone that reflect sincere interest in good, balanced policies for people, our community, and the future.\n\nFEBRUARY 2022 — Priority: Community Much of my expression in this column is about neighborhoods – the homes, nearby schools, churches, grocery store; the retired folks and working parents, toddlers and teenagers; the teachers, mail deliverers, and store clerks who comprise what we each call “my neighborhood.”\n\nWe derive a significant part of our self-awareness from our neighborhoods. We are inevitably shaped by the area where we live and environment that surrounds us … especially true, the longer we live in the same neighborhood. Additionally, what we do in our neighborhood makes a difference for us and every other person there, even though we may not always realize it. Each of us contributes to the awareness and understanding that build caring practices, pride, and safety in the area where our address is.\n\nRecent shooting deaths and injury of teens in West Valley City have highlighted both the caring and also the responsibility we have to all our families when we choose to live in a neighborhood. Each time an act of gun violence affects one of us, it becomes a neighborhood experience, a violation of the trust we give each other that guns will be responsibly managed. As neighbors, we are responsible to store guns securely when we aren’t carrying them. Our neighbors trust that those with firearms understand their lethal power and how to safely carry and use them. We rely gun owners to keep them and ammunition separately locked away from young children, from possible home invaders, from teens who are easily intrigued.\n\nWe are re-orienting after the latest shootings among young people. Once again, we will re-set our expectation that gun owners will recognize and take responsible steps and restore some lost trust that firearms can be safe. We know there are more guns around, and we thank owners who are increasingly conscientious with them. Thank you for caring about our community.\n\nJANUARY 2022 (Page 11) — Utah Legislature 2022 To many people, the Legislature is a distant group of people, elected to work at the State Capitol on complicated laws that regularly impact our lives unexpectedly. The topics and processes can seem obscure or sometimes purposely exclusive to public input. This is not the intent but getting involved definitely requires some knowledge and time. And it doesn’t help understanding or interest to see insistent extremists dominating media images by crowding meeting rooms and intimidating other attendees.\n\nThe reality is that every level of government, from local school boards to city, state, and federal elected leaders, relies on an established set of rules for every part of its process work. These rules always provide for public notification, participation, and rules changes when necessary. They also require certain behaviors and steps for participants – elected officials and members of the public – so the process is clear, fair, and manageable. The more people who learn and participate, the better balanced the procedures and less interference from unruly attendees. Upholding the basic rules is truly a community view and support system.\n\nAs the 2022 State Legislature approaches, beginning on January 18, I urge you to check out the website le.utah.gov. Just exploring the site provides a lot of information about the process and meetings that will be our daily routine through March 4. You can give yourself a civics education curriculum by noting the calendar of committee meetings (now accessible online), the language of bills any legislator is sponsoring, and the activity in the House and Senate. All our legislator contact information is on the website and you can sign up to receive update emails on any topic or bill.\n\nIn my job, I am oriented to our West Valley City neighborhoods and the people of Utah. I look forward to hearing your questions and ideas about the work I am doing at the State Capitol.\n\n2021 “Round-table Talk” with Representative Weight … published in the West Valley City Journal\n\nDECEMBER 2021 (Page 10) — Your Role in Legislative Committee Meetings Picture twenty students – junior or senior high – sitting in legislators’ chairs in a committee room at the Capitol. Add another group in the public section of the room, with roles to comment their support or opposition in discussion of real bills. Actual legislators like me are the committee chair and bill sponsors, but students are co-presenters of the bills. This is the stage for committee hearing simulations that began earlier this year, as part of an educational outreach on an important public role in our government.\n\nA group of us in the House of Representatives designed the committee simulations to help our young people learn about procedures, experience roles of governance, and even share ideas at home. Thanks to our state education standards, we have a solid framework for simulation objectives and details. Our message is that, while registering and voting are critical, understanding law-making steps and being confident to interact with legislators builds a necessary dynamic for truly representative government.\n\nFrom my teaching career, I definitely have an educator perspective on legislators understanding more about constituents and “the people” learning to participate in our government. Few people want an “immersion” level of involvement, but we also have strong distaste for the behaviors of uninformed and unruly people making demands and suggesting threats, with little regard for simple rules of discussion our kids learn throughout school.\n\nFor legislators, while we are wishing “Happy Holidays, we are also busy getting ready for the 45-day session. On January 18, we will begin the 2022 Legislative Session, with an intense schedule of committee hearings where every bill will be presented for public comment. We invite your emails and calls, but I hope you’ll take note of the committees where everyone can now participate online. It’s easy to join in through our website calendar at www.le.utah.gov. Happy Holidays and I’ll see you on the Hill in January!\n\nNOVEMBER 2021 (Page 3) — Values, Votes, and Accountability In a recent West Valley City meeting of the Independent Redistricting Commission, one commissioner emphatically pronounced that accountability was the real point of the map consideration and that would only come with my vote and those of other legislators on the final maps. I agree with his point about my accountability, but I question that commissioner’s value of process, particularly since he quit his sworn duties at the critical time of decision-making. I question a leader who challenges the significance of broad inclusion and deep deliberation that the Independent Commission has provided Utah. As I expressed in the meeting that day, after the exclusive and secretive selection of district maps ten years ago, those who have publicly shared their ideas and comments this time are truly valuable leaders in our communities.\n\nMaps are a huge topic of discussion these days, but other issues will be or must be on the table for the people of West Valley City and their elected leaders. What information, open discussions, and opportunities are offered for participation and deeper involvement by residents? With emphasis on growth and commerce, what analysis and reporting will be easily available on sustaining jobs, renewable energy, air quality, traffic design, transit options, affordable housing, and health impacts from all the development in and around our city? What avenues do our young people, a huge segment of our population, have to learn and contribute?\n\nYes, as an elected official, I recognize my accountability in the role and on the votes I make. Additionally, with all that goes on under the direction of elected and selected government, I encourage and am deeply grateful for those who participate with thoughtfulness toward community interests and understanding that a diverse array of views has always strengthened our neighborhoods. I always look forward to hearing from you.\n\nOCTOBER 2021 (Page 9) — Today’s Decisions, Future Lives About one-third of the people in House District 31, the legislative district I represent, are under voting age. That makes me very conscious that how I think and vote as a legislator will affect not only current Utahns but will influence conditions for our young people throughout their lives – in their families, their jobs, their health, the way they travel, their opportunities. In any policy debate these days, it’s my duty to consider my voting options for how they will shape circumstances in ten, twenty, fifty years, and even longer. People my age have seen the impact of well-balanced decisions and also choices that are politically driven, and we understand how critical directions are determined by how conscientiously long-term outcomes are regarded.\n\nRight now, we state lawmakers are noting no more “low-hanging fruit” in some critical decision areas. We have addressed the problems that have easier, more immediate solutions – less controversial, less complex, with less budget impact. We are now challenging each other with the harder questions and listening to thoughtful ideas. But I also hear avoidance, denial, and redirection away from serious concerns, especially if speakers are engaged in certain political biases.\n\nAs legislators, our priority must be to the people whose lives and futures we represent. As we regard topics of air quality and its relation to health, water and conservation, transportation and population impacts, and how “economy” translates to vibrant communities and fair opportunities, there is no place for extremism or presumption in our decision-making. It means listening and collaboration. I’m always excited for input from engaged neighbors, and in these days of uncertainty, I’m so grateful to collaborate and rely on the expertise of all the trained and dedicated people in our state departments.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021 (Page 15) — Responsibility and Who Matters The “role of government” is a subject that increasingly underlies many political conversations these days. It’s a complex topic and a huge discussion on its own – more than can be addressed in one session, lesson, or essay. And it ultimately connects to what is presented, practiced, and emphasized in our civics education courses. The idea raises thoughts about history, institutions, and all it means to participate in a representative form of government.\n\nFor us elected, our primary guide is expected to be and must be the consideration of impacts on and future conditions and opportunities for those we represent. I point this out to groups of students I lead on tours at the Capitol, that as a current elected representative, my votes and proposed legislation are based on what I can estimate and hope for them – the jobs, neighborhoods, and environment that will evolve from governmental oversight and direction today.\n\nThat does not mean the loudest, most demanding voices “win.” That does not mean and has never meant that all individuals will be satisfied by responses or votes made in the consideration of community welfare. That does not mean my elected colleagues and I will not be influenced by our own experiences and views. But it also does not mean that one political party view can dominate.\n\nDeveloping connections between “government” and “the governed” is a responsibility of both. However, we all understand that government holds institutional power, and we agree that responsibility of power requires extra steps – reliable information, genuine listening, and truthful accountability. Our government, including me and other representatives, owes the people policy decisions that uphold them and their communities.\n\nAUGUST 2021 (Page 16) — Important: This Year’s Elections That’s right – elections this year. Although we won’t see prominent headlines or perpetual media chat about candidates, our 2021 votes are even more valuable in these local elections. That’s because we will be voting for our neighbors running for city leadership. Those are the leaders we can join at regular meetings about neighborhood conditions, local taxes, the city budget, and city department ideas.\n\nOne confusion comes from the Ranked Choice Voting method being used in many cities – not in West Valley City. Our city council voted to hold traditional primary elections in August and then the general election in November. With Ranked Choice Voting, ballots will go out only for November, and all candidates in each race will be ranked in order of preference. It will be interesting to compare reactions to the different voting methods.\n\nYou can get lots of information about our West Valley City and other elections at the WVC website or the Salt Lake County Clerk website.\n\nAnd now some key questions: Are you registered to vote? — Once you do that, you will always get a ballot in the mail! Will you vote? — Make a plan and do that. You can even register on election days if you vote at a polling place. Do you know the candidates? — Take a few minutes to see their online information. Take a few more minutes to note questions and ask them. Candidates want to share ideas.\n\nI am part of a formal state civics education working group, established by the legislature earlier this year. The huge concern behind the legislation was lack of engagement and misunderstanding of voting, voting rights, and government systems. Our kids are ready to talk about civics and participation in our community. Let’s learn and talk about candidates and elections with them. Also, feel free to invite me! I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!\n\nJULY 2021 (Page 6) — Listen. Then Ask Questions Committee meeting. Presentation from an agency on goals and accomplishments. Invitation to visit the agency to learn more. My job is to listen and take notes. This is part of Legislative oversight of our state government, and we legislators meet amazing staff and learn about the expertise in our state offices.\n\nI follow the analysis points in the report, and then my job is to ask questions. I want to be clear about the work and its purpose. I want to assure good tax dollar investment. I want transparency and accountability to Utahns for government actions.\n\nOne area for questions is the Inland Port project, and I have growing concerns as some key issues continue unanswered. Port properties lie mostly within Salt Lake City, but the Port construction, facilities, and operations will directly impact West Valley City people and neighborhoods.\n\nMost questions are simple, basic, and common to developments, especially when they involve the size and state investment of the Port. As questions continue, they are increasing in number and level of interest. Responses include positive exclamations about economic benefits and jobs, but important information is still missing from reports and planning documents.\n\nWho, exactly, will the Port facilities employ? As a state-funded entity, how will the Port employment plan integrate workforce needs with state training and education systems? What job qualities, opportunities, safety, and pay are projected and assured? What studies are being done to illustrate impacts on air quality for the “downwinder” residents of West Valley City? What do traffic analyses and projections show about emission levels, monitoring systems, and response mechanisms? We hear descriptions of a “green port.” What are specific plans and requirements for electric vehicles and Utah research?\n\nTransparency and accountability rely on questions. This is a great opportunity for all to join in the job of asking the Utah Inland Port Authority.\n\nJUNE 2021 (Page 8) — Accountability Brief summary (you likely know this part): In May, the state legislature met for a special session. Following Constitutional requirements and procedures, and in collaboration on requested topics, Governor Cox proclaimed the session with a list of topics that called for urgent, necessary action, in line with criteria and heedful of the taxpayer dollars associated with special sessions. The day before the special session, in closed partisan meetings, a small group of right-wing legislators persuaded their leaders to call “extraordinary” sessions in both houses and address topics on which the governor realized much more deliberation is needed.\n\nUnlike Utah’s special session process, various rules and procedures were suspended and only one political group directed and decided the steps and topics for the extraordinary sessions. Instead of Utah representatives in agreement to present and debate two extremely controversial topics, one-fourth of Utah’s legislative body were strategically excluded until formal meetings began. In contradiction of transparency, language of the bills was unavailable to Utahns, including legislators, until less than six hours before the first and only debate, interrupting the important work in the special session.\n\nWhat Utahns witnessed and what must be very concerning to us all was usurpation of representation that belongs to all Utahns, particularly when we disagree. Utahns deserve and, as a legislator, I have the responsibility for opportunities to hear different views, to understand opposing points, to research and consult, and to participate in a fair process. What Utahns witnessed was a small, radical group, taking possession of power that belongs to the whole representative body and all the people it serves. What we witnessed and what I experienced as a legislator was a successful uprising against civics fundamentals that we count on to provide orderly, fair, and reasonable deliberation for lawmaking in our state.\n\nI am proud to represent people who characteristically stand for complete and fair process and the accountability that provides. Let’s keep talking and listening.\n\nMAY 2021 (Page 18) — Good Jobs When I talk to people I represent, I hear knowledgeable, practical comments about a broad number of issues. One thing people realize, especially with the pandemic, is how connected one topic, such as jobs, is to others – education leads to job choice; transportation relates to getting to and from a job; household economy depends on what a job pays and provides in other benefits; a worker’s physical and mental wellbeing are affected by job conditions. Additionally, parents explain how concerned they are about air quality and other environmental ratings for their kids, and they recognize how certain jobs affect quality of life for everyone.\n\nAs Utah grows in population and develops all the systems that support more people, we understand the importance of standards in all areas of that development. In particular, “good jobs” is not just about how many people are employed or how many jobs there are. Not only do our workers deserve jobs that support their households, we all expect jobs to protect employees and employee groups who have ideas for improvement. We expect safeguards for workers and also operations that maintain qualities for healthy environments in our neighborhoods, no matter how close our neighborhood is to a jobsite.\n\nWhen we talk about “jobs,” we each have a role because we are talking about the intersections with other topics. Each worker’s role is to join with other workers, organize, choose a spokesperson to discuss views with others, including employers. Each family member’s role is to observe and share ideas, especially with the workers in the house. Each student’s role is to ask questions and learn how jobs affect economy and also environment. Employers’ roles are to share ideas with employees, especially with employee spokespersons. And legislators, along with other public officials? Our roles are to understand the intersecting ideas and concerns, then establish balanced policies for jobs that are truly good jobs.\n\nAPRIL 2021 (Page 11) — Ask a Student During the 2021 Utah Legislative Session, House Bill 338 was introduced by a 16-year-old student. The bill sponsor was her representative, and I am a member of the committee to which she presented. The student’s name is Dhati, and by the finish of her amazing presentation, many committee members expressed excited hope to see her in the state legislature as soon as possible. What impressed me even more was seeing my colleagues realize the potential of a civically engaged student.\n\nThe bill proposed that, in local school board elections, 16- and 17-year-olds be allowed to vote. They would receive ballots for only that race – the election of a person from their neighborhood, who represents their family, who influences decisions about their school, who is expected at their school regularly to understand the culture, the issues, and ideas for problem solving. The committee voted to move the bill on to the next step – consideration by all 75 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe idea to include high school students, even in a neighborhood election, is challenging to those who haven’t talked to a student about voting and elected office. I have. I have seen and heard them share research about candidates and compare leadership qualities. They talk about values, concepts from social studies classes, and what good representation is. Students are more engaged and informed than many of their parents. Students who don’t know details about the Constitution still understand how meaningful an election is, and the idea of voting motivates them to learn more about our government and participation. That’s the purpose of civics education. Facts about history and government become truly significant when we have a reason to understand more. We can learn about citizenship from kids. Just ask a student.\n\nMARCH 2021 (Page 7) — Representing District 31 and Utah We elected officials come from a political process. Needless to say, the 2020 election was as political and oppositional as most of us have seen, and voters were subjected to extremist views as national campaigns worked to influence votes. Local elections like ours in District 31 were quite civil, but the effect of national emotions lingers among those elected as well as the people they serve. For us elected, the job now is to represent everyone – to step back and view topics and concerns on a broader scale, with input and insights from the community, and to work for the interests of all. The job now calls for balance, being aware of bias and prejudice, and choosing affiliations carefully.\n\nThat doesn’t mean political bias and persuasion don’t show up in some bills each session. That’s where the variety of representatives’ backgrounds and views bring us to a rich, productive debate. The variety of experiences raises a spectrum of discussion points, exposes extremes, and allows us to understand and vote for what will meet the needs and interests of Utahns. Even with a super majority – over three-to-one ratio of Republicans to Democrats in our legislature – we can trust that process most of the time.\n\nWhat is important to me is giving fair consideration to all the ideas and concerns I receive from people in District 31. Even if I’m not able to reply right away, I read or listen to messages. They all help me provide comments in committee hearings and shape my thinking for votes on the House floor. They also help me see details I might clarify when it seems there are misunderstandings. I love to brag to my legislator colleagues about the common sense and goodness of the people in District 31 and all of West Valley City. Thank you for that opportunity!\n\nFEBRUARY 2021 (Page 12) — Policies and People In a committee meeting the first week of the legislative session, a person on Zoom commented about activism. The topic was civics education and civic engagement. The comment was that civics programs “turn children into activists for progressive causes.” What they need instead is knowledge of the Constitution. The speaker suggested that knowledge leads to engagement, but implied that only certain types of participation were desirable. Even though I have seen the opposite of her description from my interactions with students, it was helpful to understand her beliefs as we discussed and then voted on the bill.\n\nPolicy-making in Utah and the U.S. is designed to include people and their ideas. In any group of people, we expect differences - different backgrounds, different experiences, different circumstances – that create a range of views and thoughts. That variety is important to understand and acknowledge in creating laws that people can agree to uphold. Listening and sharing ideas is necessary and powerful for us state lawmakers, and we rely on people who contribute their views in the process steps for deciding laws. We rely best on people who take the care and time to learn the points and purpose of a bill they want to influence.\n\nWhen students or any of us learn the text of the Constitution and also take action like contacting community leaders, making public comment, and joining others in the dialog, everyone benefits. In the last few years, we have witnessed outcomes from people acting without knowledge and also people retreating from participation even when they have informed views to contribute. As many have noted, this is a time of transition and recognition of our peaceful roles and power in our government processes. I look forward to your participation by signing up for my newsletter and contacting me.\n\nJANUARY 2021 (Page 19) — New Education Committee Member In the 2021 legislative session, I will join the Education Standing Committee. That means I will hear and vote on legislation about education from members of the Utah House of Representatives. My votes will help determine if the full House will receive bills for consideration. I’m excited about the appointment and also very thoughtful about my experiences and views from teaching for 32 years.\n\nMost decisions in our public education system are made by administrators and local school boards. State lawmakers are protective of local authority, but we also recognize our role in assuring quality, equity, and access to education for all Utah students. And we have a strong position about accountability and public trust. My views from the classroom are critical in the discussion that has often been dominated by policy makers with more background in politics and capitalism than education. My experience with students, their parents, and school communities provides valuable insight about effects of policies on learning. My continuing role among teachers and school staff provides expert information for my legislative colleagues about realities for the adults who teach and provide other services for our students.\n\nIn 1998, laws designated certain decisions to another authority, the charter school system. Currently, about 1.1% of Utah students attend charter schools. However, all Utah taxpayers contribute to the support of charter schools and there is interest from some to increase that support. School choice is a topic for all Utahns, with rising questions about the selection of students, funding, and accountability. My questions and legislative research are about quality and opportunity for students, teachers, and staff. I look forward to hearing from you to assure good education policy in Utah. That is the meaningfulness of working together.\n\n2020 “Round-table Talk” with Representative Weight … published in the West Valley City Journal\n\nDECEMBER 2020 (Page 5) — Together, Respect and Responsibility The teacher in me brings vocabulary notes to this column. With COVID, re-election, and looking to 2021, I reflect on words that deserve clarification among us.\n\nTogether. In past columns, you have seen expressions of my interest in and commitment to healthy neighborhoods and civic involvement that sustains them. Voters have given me the honor of representing a district of strong, independent thinkers who also generally understand the benefits of working together to recognize and resolve problems. We share observations and experiences, and we create dynamic support for each other to move forward in even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nRespect. I come from a family with diverse points of view about politics and policy, including some hot-button topics like the role of government, gun regulation, reproductive and civil rights. This year has given us extraordinary opportunities to practice values held through generations. It has increased my admiration and respect for others who have held safe space to express without judgement and with openness to ideas that bother us. Being “safely bothered” encourages me in my interactions with others, including legislators, whose respect makes their ideas easier to understand. We can still disagree, but with expanded regard.\n\nResponsibility. It is satisfying to contribute to my community. It makes a difference, and I see roles and opportunities for anyone to demonstrate their leader qualities. The last months have brought many of us into discussions about individual Constitutional rights. However, good leaders also emphasize the civic responsibilities that unite us and build our communities.\n\nAmong other things, COVID in 2020 has shown us that working together with respect and responsible behavior is fundamental to getting through the pandemic. Thank you for being part of the positive power.\n\nNOVEMBER 2020 (Page 13) — My Name on Your Ballot Reading the Constitutions of Utah and the United States is a good assignment, even after our school social studies courses. In Utah, “all political power is inherent in the people” appears in the first article of our Constitution. That phrase makes the elected leaders we choose responsible to us, our families, and our communities. As your State Representative, I design my objectives from conversations with you.\n\nMy legislative goals are rooted in what makes communities thrive. From decades of working with students and their families, I know that fair taxes, good jobs, quality education, and accessible healthcare provide stability in our neighborhoods and our economy. They allow us all to participate fully in our communities.\n\nWhen individuals have good education and training, they qualify for jobs with incomes that sustain households and support local businesses. When families have reliable healthcare for regular preventative procedures as well as at times when they need treatment, physical and mental health improves throughout the community. When we know that our West Valley City Police Department holds the first national certification in Utah for their extensive training and skills, we have assurance of effective law enforcement as well as good investment of our tax dollars.\n\nMy name, Elizabeth Weight, on your ballot is your option to re-elect a leader who uses guiding points from you to work with other state and local leaders in developing sensible, balanced policy that honors the dignity of all individuals, with recognition of our amazing diversity and the future we want for our children. I’m excited to keep sharing ideas with you!\n\nOCTOBER 2020 (Page 17) — Your Vote and My Duty Since its start, the 2020 election cycle has been unique. We candidates have regularly assessed how to deliver messages with COVID considerations. As always, I want to address the issues and topics on voters’ minds. And this year, the climate is more politicized than usual. It might be useful to understand more about my view of the job of being your representative.\n\nMy background is public school teaching. During my 32-year career, I taught in grades 7 through 12. I worked with gifted learners, high achievers, kids with severe mental illnesses, youth in state custody, “regular” kids, and all their parents. I came to the job of State Representative with awareness from these families of the broad spectrum of effects from jobs, food security, health care, air quality, transportation, and safety on lives and learning. Every condition and situation at home reflects itself at school, and I reflect on those in all my work as a legislator.\n\nThe job includes my connections among stakeholders, research, budget, and with other legislators on four committees as well as in hundreds of votes for West Valley families during legislative sessions. I am also an appointed member in two important commissions – the Women in the Economy and Judicial Conduct Commissions.\n\nMy most important role is listening to and sharing ideas with the people I represent. When I vote, speak, and sponsor legislation, my duty is to what benefits our families, neighborhoods, and economy. Your vote for me is a vote for honoring the whole job of representing you.\n\nAbout your ballot: Ballots arrive the week after October 13. Every registered voter in Utah will receive a ballot in the mail. Now is the time to make a voting plan. Check your registration. Learn about candidates and issues. Check websites Voterise.org and Vote.Utah.gov. The best way to vote: mail your ballot by October 27.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2020 (Page 3) — Government by the People I live in an HOA community, a neighborhood where we own our homes, but we also jointly own the areas all around our houses. We share ownership, we share expenses for community utilities and maintenance, and we share in regular savings deposits for big projects like roofs and sidewalks. To coordinate and organize decision-making among the 135 co-owners, we elect a mini government, our Association Board. Like any group of voters, we participate to different degrees. As in any neighborhood, some become observers, listeners, and spokespersons to help the board better understand the details in their parts of the community. Each board member and neighborhood activist plays a role in the quality of the place where we live. They all make a difference.\n\nWe who walk around our neighborhoods notice details about trees and sidewalks, lawns and rain gutters. We end up in conversations where we learn about each other’s pets and kids and jobs. During more walks and chats over time, we learn more about each other’s views and values. And we learn what qualities about the neighborhood we like and want to improve. We grow each other’s views and ideas, and maybe we decide to get more neighbors into the discussion. Maybe the idea evolves into a project or activity, goal or direction for the community. This is a government connection, too.\n\nWhat I learn from walking and talking to neighbors, within my HOA and beyond, is we all want to make a difference where we live. Whether it’s an association board or city council or state legislature, people want to be held in regard for the part they take. They want practical, sensible, and fair decisions from the people they elect. They want their votes to count for something.\n\nI agree. Let’s keep working together for the best qualities in our community.\n\nAUGUST 2020 (Page 7) — We Need This Vocabulary Lesson Some people I talk to want to be finished with all the racism and social justice issues in the news, what lives matter, and what “should” happen. However, once a conversation develops, we start to explore our terms for specific meanings and what results in public policy effects we really expect.\n\nFor example, someone is telling me about equality in reference to laws and government. The original topic might be police or taxes or another part of our system. We soon realize there’s a misconception about “equality” and that word is inadequate for what we are discussing. We switch to another term to continue and consider what is fair. The term we must use is “equity.”\n\nIn Utah, we place a high value on fairness. This summer, many of us have participated in justice protests, and I have received hundreds of emails about constitutional expectations. Protests and emails might seem bold actions, but even in casual conversations with neighbors and friends, we talk about people having equal access and opportunity to reach their potential. When people get resources and support they need to overcome unfair, unequal circumstances, that’s equity.\n\nCOVID19 has shown us various systems designed to be equal for everyone but are actually equal only for those who can access them. Internet service doesn’t reach into all areas of our state. Many jobs cannot be done from home. Many jobs don’t pay enough for emergency saving or healthcare. Thousands of Utah children do not get sufficient food for healthy development and learning. Many Utah students have special learning needs.\n\nUtahns have always had the grit to deal with unfair circumstances like these, and we have a history of community spirit to address them and provide opportunity. We understand that equal outcomes do not come simply from equal treatment. We know we stand on uneven ground and that creating structures and responses to even out the steps makes a better system for all of us. That’s equity.\n\nJULY 2020 (Page 3) — Persons Before Politics I’m calling this election cycle the year of “don’t ask don’t tell” votes. As we have noted our own thoughts and decisions about pandemic conditions, police violence, and institutional racism, we are giving our values and integrity a good workout. In our internal dialogues, we can hear our views develop and identify the reasons for our conclusions. We are comparing our decisions with direction from elected leaders, and we’re making judgments based on the distinctions. Many of us are growing beyond simple political party loyalty. We are even realizing the harm of following party directives and descriptions because the more we learn, the more we appreciate the complex community realities around us and the people who seek election to make a difference.\n\nAs candidates, people like me are required to identify ourselves with a political party. Now, even state school board candidates must choose one of those party labels, even though education has long been kept separate from partisan descriptors. This year, crisis situations, community needs, and our elected leaders’ responses have given us a new set of guidelines for our voting choices, some we may not want to speak out loud. This year, we still remember destructive tax reform and overturned voter initiatives, and we might feel compelled to really understand the background and character of the candidates on our ballots. This year, motivations from our lives can direct our votes, and they may not align with our past traditions of voting on party lines.\n\nOn our November ballots, we will not see an option to vote for a single party. New state law frees us to look at each race and each name. Our experiences in these historic times and our reflections about recent decisions dominated by a super majority give us the responsibility to look past political party affiliations to candidates we choose because they actually stand for values we share.\n\nJUNE 2020 (Page 5) — Transparency, Trust, and Taxes When our state government took action to protect Utahns from COVID19, there wasn’t time to go through all the regular steps of legislative deliberation. That’s what emergency proclamations are for; they define situations that allow executive officials to take quick steps for the health and safety of the population. Even then, there are requirements and limits under such declarations, and we trust leaders to act with good information and the integrity of their office. We must be able to trust leaders in emergencies. We want to be able to trust them at all times. That is why elected leaders must be clear and open in their positions of representation and leadership, even in times of no emergency. That is why seeing and understanding elected officials’ actions is a primary consideration in voting.\n\nAs the state pandemic response developed and we could note more details, some of us legislators grew concerned about expenditures on questionable items, products and processes that didn’t align with valid information or with the guidance of our state public health or economic experts. Even in this time of emergency and necessity for quick response, certain contracts were suspicious. We asked about steps and documents that are required, even in crisis situations. We wondered about other contracts. Some skilled journalists investigated and provided the public with information, some of it logical, some of it more concerning, much of it disappointing in its corruption of public trust. When we eventually heard the governor’s promise about proper contracts in the future, how much confidence in representative leaders had already been lost?\n\nAt this point in the COVID19 response, we state legislators are reviewing and reconsidering budget items, the allocation of federal relief funds, and layers of impact from the pandemic. We hold a great responsibility to view tax revenue not just as dollars but as a civic contribution from each taxpayer. I agree with you: in order to uphold the trust placed in us elected leaders, our actions must be transparent and purposeful, especially now.\n\nMAY 2020 (page 12) — Public Schools, Our Pandemic Resilience Network I called my sister recently to chat, but I really needed to acknowledge her and the role she has adapted during the pandemic. She has a key position in the high school where she works and is one of those primary figures coordinating each day’s new “routine” activities as well as addressing whatever unpredictable situations arise. Since the beginning of our Safe-At-Home response to the pandemic, we all have a new appreciation of what teachers, staff, and administrators manage and accomplish. They oversee the operations of class time, movement, and meeting education expectations. But they and the thousands of kids usually in Utah schools every day make up micro communities where everyone has a purposeful role, and where social issues, classroom topics, “workplace” scenarios, and personal interactions create an interwoven network. Just as in our larger communities beyond schools, the people of different ages, personalities, and backgrounds in our public schools experience daily activities of civic membership. Additionally, in our public schools, they have a support structure in which to learn, understand, and acknowledge each other and their civic responsibilities. In our school communities, problem-solving steps and skills develop – of course, for resolving math questions, but also for application in work, home, and personal relationships. From the interactive steps around reading and writing in a school setting, more knowledge is built and ideas shared and views debated. Learning about history, science, and literature is expanded in the reflections among students and teachers, but often including administrators and staff, because they’re all part of the school “citizenship.”\n\nAs people dispersed for safety during the pandemic, the school network and individual roles within it have remained the most dynamic structure across our state. The quality of each person’s participation in each school community has contributed to the strength and spirit of courage and resilience in our neighborhoods. Thank you, students, teachers, staff, administrators, and school volunteers for illustrating civic duty, initiative, and leadership. Thanks especially to my sister, Deborah Hoehne, Principle Secretary at Layton High School and inspirational Utah citizen.\n\nAPRIL 2020 (page 18) — Role of Government During the legislative session, a common question about a proposed bill is whether it fits the role of government. With the steps in response to COVID19, questions have become more specific – whether the government role and emphasis should address economic or health or household needs, whether the first focus goes to private business, to public safety, or to the impacts on people’s lives. A primary purpose of government is for elected leaders to show up as people, listening to experts, being spokespersons in a well-informed and coordinated management of elements that affect all these areas, starting with the well-being of the people they serve.\n\nCertainly, on all levels and in all branches of government, thoughtful preparation is part of the role, so necessary networks are established and sustained. What we have seen in the Coronavirus response is the value of perspective, planning, and practice before the emergency occurs. In Utah, we’re pretty good at foresight, and we are learning even more.\n\nAs your state representative, my views start with people and their lives. When government leaders build trustworthy security for daily routines, our neighborhoods and communities thrive and are positioned for resiliency in challenging times. That provides a stable source of support for our businesses and economy. In my work for West Valley residents and Utah, I agree with a growing majority of people across the country about some foundational pieces for building sureness in all circumstances: good jobs affordable, quality healthcare investment in children empowerment of people over special interests equal opportunity for all sustainable infrastructure, resilience, and innovation clean air, water, and energy. Underlying it all, for community stability and for accomplishing all our short- and long-term visions, I work most for your trust that I will listen, care, and communicate truthfully. Thank you for taking your role in our community!\n\nMARCH 2020 (page 11) — Process Play-outs This session, as I have evaluated legislation in committees and on the floor of the House of Representatives, I have grown more aware of the intricacies, nuances, and variations in the process steps and rules that frame our work. House Bill 72, to establish safety standards in certain railroad workplaces, has been in preparation meetings for three years. For over an hour, committee members listened to details and explanations from different perspectives – those of workers, managers, analysts of other state practices. Even when the vote was against passing the bill to the full House for consideration, there was no denying the examination had been thorough and informative.\n\nWith another, very simple bill, I had planned for misunderstanding, but I never anticipated the loud statewide reaction it would receive. HB152 would have repealed a high school test in our state code. The Education Committee voted approval with enthusiastic support. But as soon as the bill posted to the House calendar, feedback reflected clear misconceptions. Organizations chose positions on the bill – those with research supported it; those with uninformed biases supported a substitute bill published by another representative. In the House debate, the substitute bill was adopted. That meant, in the confusing process considered a “hijack,” I became the sponsor of a bill I disagreed with. I was glad to see the final vote against my own bill. The good news is that, with statewide awareness of the bill, Utahns now know about a piece of curricula, rarely put into state law, and the fact that it is purposeless. They also have another view of each representative’s thinking, as the votes illustrate.\n\nOne other bill has waited to be moved to a committee for initial hearing. My job with that is to speak with leaders to learn the reasons. Sometimes a simple revision changes the view. The reality is that sometimes a bill’s basic concept might decide its fate with no hearing. In even that case, however, public awareness and contact to legislators is always helpful. That’s why I’m grateful to hear from you!\n\nFEBRUARY 2020 (page 13) —- In Session The news tells you we legislators are “in session.” That means that, as the Utah House District 31 representative, I am at the State Capitol for ten to fifteen hours a day, in committee rooms and the House of Representatives, reading, listening, and voting on proposals for state law changes. It’s intense and exhilarating work. It’s awareness-building and values-defining. I learn on the Hill, and I’m grateful for the conversations in which I learn from the people in West Valley City.\n\nDistrict 31 includes those who live in the north area of the city. I represent people who have a range of perspectives on issues and policies and politics. I represent people with extremely diverse backgrounds, situations, and experiences. And my main guide is that I represent people. As I listen to bills, I consider how the proposed law will affect the daily lives of workers, parents, students, government operations, and the future. I know and respect the different views among those I represent, even when my vote might not be in agreement.\n\nWhen I was a teacher, I was glad to have purposeful, well-vetted standards to provide a framework by which to design my instruction. As a representative, my job is to understand and regard a much broader view than my own. For that, I look to a set of common goals among Utahns. I read and listen to bills with interest in how they will provide good jobs, affordable quality healthcare, and invest in children. I agree with policies that empower people over special interests and assure equal opportunity for all. And I approve bills that invest in clean air, water, and energy, and that support sustainable infrastructure, resilience, and innovation.\n\nIn a time when politics has given us considerable uncertainties about policy direction, your views and these goals make a difference!\n\nJANUARY 2020 January means the beginning of the Utah Legislative Session. Official meetings begin on the 27th, but I have been working for months on legislative proposals. Since the confusing and controversial tax legislation passed in the December special session, commentary continues about how well legislators listen. For me, I believe it is my purpose and responsibility as a state representative to understand views of those I serve, and I’m grateful when you contact me. Based on my study, along with information from your emails and calls, my vote on tax restructuring is a “no.”\n\nRegardless of the topic, my decision process for all votes is influenced by some concepts that provide a foundation for my civic thinking. Two concepts are accountability and investment. Both require consideration of what works well for communities as well as individuals, for future circumstances as well as what seems favorable right now.\n\nAccountability reflects the expectations we have with each other. More communication and interaction allow us to better understand each other’s ideas and views for results. When I see a need for new or different state law, the more I know and exchange ideas with others, the more we all contribute to the proposal. We understand its benefit and accept the elements with which we may not fully agree. The collaboration creates results that are accountable to everyone.\n\nInvestment has become a priority in my representation of West Valley and Utah. Whatever my own experience and knowledge, impacts of my votes on the future are at least as important as immediate outcomes. That applies particularly with subjects like taxes. My vote on taxes will always be guided by the security for future education outcomes and the impact on the quality of people’s lives.\n\nWith these civics concepts, I look forward to hearing from you in the 2020 session!\n\nSome 2018 “Round-table Talk” with Representative Weight … published monthly in the West Valley City Journal\n\nDecember 2018 –Representing with a Broad View In November, I was excited to participate in a conference to introduce a Utah student scholarship winner and to share ideas with other women lawmakers. The agenda included a variety of topics such as professional licensing and newborn screening, women-owned businesses and school choice. We attended workshops, presentations, luncheons, and recognition ceremonies, as well as an energetic team-building activity in which I helped our team points, with much encouragement, by completing a yoga handstand. A strong principle at this conference was to work past political barriers to address the issues we all agree need serious attention. We conscientiously avoided common political party views so we could listen and respond with our own ideas in our own words. It was a valuable guideline to generate more authentic discussion, but it turned out to add a truly educational and beneficial dimension to every conversation at the conference! We weren’t striving just to confine ourselves to rules of civility. We were designing the specific elements of our thoughts and expressions to create the most productive discussions and problem solutions. Did we avoid disagreements or oppositional interactions? Not at all! However, the way we made our comments was to more precisely point out details or to describe causes and effects we could see. Yes, this took deliberation and care, but we all appreciated the remarkable quality of our overall experience. The broader view made us all better presenters and representatives.\n\nNovember 2018 – Ballots Getting Counted, but the Conversations Continue Even though most ballots arrived in the mail the second week of October, many people are still thinking about them. Ballots may go back in the mail until Monday, November 5, and early voting, in person, is open until Friday, November 2. Of course, Election Day on Tuesday, November 6, will still be a popular voting time, and registrations can even be completed for a provisional ballot on that day. Thanks to our county clerk, Sherrie Swenson, we have numerous options for convenient voting. I am excited and impressed by the conversations and questions about this 2018 ballot. We have an historic set of voting choices, with seven questions going directly to all Utah voters, along with the candidate elections and judge retention decisions. Even people who aren’t old enough to vote are interested in the proposed amendments and propositions. As the legislature plans to go into its third special session this year, there are growing questions about the meaningfulness of the Proposition 2 vote. Our ballot decisions about medical cannabis will confirm what Utahns have been requesting of the legislature for years and be a guiding power in that session. What we see is people using their voices in our democratic system. What we hear are the objections to domination by any single view or political party. Better than a civics course, this year’s observations, concerns, dialog, and research have created lessons in how our government should work and how elected officials should lead and represent. I applaud those who are asking the questions and speaking up with your ideas! Take pride in taking part!\n\nOctober 2018 – Your Vote, Your Power, Your Kitchen, and the Ripple Effect Our ballots will arrive in the mail soon. They will list candidate names, and they will provide every Utah voter with yes-no questions for new state laws. We have never had a ballot so rich with choices for us, the people. We have succeeded in bringing key issues out to us when lawmakers would not answer our call. Now, the opportunity, but also the responsibility lies with us. It’s homework time. First, we have an excellent resource to answer questions about voting and our ballot. Our county clerk, Sherrie Swenson, makes our local voting process extra-ordinarily clear and accessible to voters, as well as secure from threats to our election system. At the website GOT-VOTE.ORG, Sherrie and her staff regularly update information to provide answers about ballots and voting. Next, with our mail-in ballots, we have time to research and share ideas before we vote. That’s the part I am told is taking place in kitchens or dining rooms. We can look at candidate handouts or give them a call to talk or answer questions. We can read more and share thoughts about those seven statewide questions on topics like school funding, fair redistricting, and medical cannabis. Then, we mark and mail our ballots and spread the word that we have voted! That “I voted” message gives even more power to your vote. That signal creates a ripple effect where other ripples intersect and more voters join in. In a year when voting is expected to be low, our votes and messaging can generate an amazing outcome! The conversation about your 2018 ballot has started. Please join me!\n\nSeptember 2018 – Our November, 2018 Ballot ! ? If it seems like there are elections going on all the time these days, there are. Utah primary elections took place in June, but since then, several other states have held primary or special elections. Tuesday, November 6 is the day of the final voting in the general midterm election throughout the country. However, we will receive our mail-in ballots in mid-October. Voting is simple. Keeping track of all the dates requires a calendar – information is below! In addition, this year’s ballot will be the most complex we have seen. We will vote to elect officials, but we will also be asked seven questions about new laws that we, the voters, are choosing directly. Four of the questions come from the response of voters when the state legislature has not responded to appeals for certain laws. After demonstrating broad support throughout the state, new laws will get a final vote from the public. In three other questions, voters will decide amendments that have been proposed for the Utah Constitution by the state legislature. It might feel like a lot of “homework,” but it’s an exciting process to learn about this year’s variety of decisions we, the voters, are directing. As a state representative, but always in teacher thinking, I believe it’s part of my role to help people understand their ballot choices. On my Liz4Utah.com website, I am building information pieces to explain and link to more details. Also, I can answer questions when I see you at a Neighbor Talk or at your door. Topics include School funding New roads Medicaid expansion Medical cannabis Voting districts Tax exemptions and Special legislative sessions. Please join me in the conversation about your 2018 ballot!\n\nAugust 2018 On the platform are seven panelists, representing five different political parties. We are answering questions from a group of college freshmen, honors students from around the state. Many are activists with established perspectives on issues and goals to work in politics someday. All are high achievers and skilled in critical thinking. The purpose of the panel is to illustrate state politics with views from different Utah party leaders. From our responses, the students can learn more about party fundamentals, but also about individual perspectives within parties. The goal is to broaden awareness and understanding – a great idea for anyone! As questions are asked and answered, the panelists seem to define themselves by two ways of thinking. Some are strictly anchored to ideologies and make constant references to texts and party policies. The others describe experiences that led them to their political affiliation and continue to raise thoughts about their party. I take away ideas that parallel how we view and create laws. We can fashion laws based on narrow rules, but history and society have shown that real experiences and consideration for general welfare are more effective bases. Precedent and principles provide a secure framework. I also consider responsible behavior as a strong guideline. This means putting ideas into law that follow beneficial practices already routine for many people. The law can acknowledge good practice for healthy communities, as well as provide guidelines and regulations to expand those behaviors among others. Reinforcing responsible behavior has become notable in recent discussions of law. One such discussion is consideration of community zoning conditions that maintain uniformity and property values. Another topic is school safety. Although the issues create an entire, separate debate, with numerous views about shootings, security, and a variety of rights involved, the topic definitely points out the need to acknowledge, follow, and increase responsible behaviors.\n\nJuly 2018 I sit with five other legislators and thirty-three teachers in their seminar group to share experiences and insights. I remember my excitement and anticipation when I participated in the seminar as a teacher, and I look forward to the discussion from the other view, now as a state representative. Our focus is the quality of civics education, and the teachers will each prepare an instructional unit as part of the program. Considering what topics and ideas to discuss with the teachers, I reflect on my recent address to new citizens at a naturalization ceremony. There, I had acknowledged the steps and learning each person had accomplished. I had emphasized how the life stories and cultures they brought now added to the stories of others, like my ancestors, to build and enrich this state and our country. Because Flag Day was near, I had noted the meaningfulness of the colors and design of the American flag and that it was dedicated in 1777, even before the colonies had won independence to become another, separate country. I think about the speeches I have heard other legislators make about the importance of civics education and what our young people need to understand about government and must realize as their civic responsibilities. I also remember my resentment of their legislation that impacted my teaching and my students’ learning, when the lawmakers had consulted no classroom teachers or students about effective coursework. Now, as a legislator, I regularly remind myself of what the word “represent” signifies among those who are represented. So, to the teachers, I acknowledge them and their role with students to understand, appreciate, and participate in our democratic process. I explain my duties as an elected official. And I note that, as civics is the study of the rights and duties of citizens, when we or our students can observe and participate in this type of discussion about who we are, what we do, and the influences of government in our lives, it is civics “class” for all involved.\n\nSome 2017 “On the Radar” with Representative Weight\n\nDecember 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nMagnificently multi-dimensional – that’s what life is as a state legislator. The array of activities in my day can include visiting the elementary school down the street, leading a tour at the State Capitol, meeting to research and discuss a piece of legislation, but also steaming vegetables for dinner, replacing the intake valve on the upstairs toilet, and taking my dog Skipper for a haircut.\n\nIn this season, I am focused on the holidays but also “the session.” Since March, I have spent time with my family as well as noted your ideas and observations from summer Neighbor Talks and monthly interim meetings. Thoughts and conversations have been percolating into legislative action. And, on a continuing theme, in a recent interview, I stressed that persistent points and direction from you supply critical perspective for good policy. In all these dimensions, the value of interaction and the First Amendment gains emphasis. ~\n\nEach day, I note the pattern of clouds in the sky, the sounds and coolness in the air, and my fortune of a warm, safe place to live. I am able to serve as a legislator because I have had opportunities for health, education, and financial security that we agree everyone should have. Our community of people who appreciate strength as well as generosity, honesty and audacity, independence but also outreach are my purpose and inspiration for public service, formerly as a teacher and now as a state representative. Heading into 2018, I have never been more aware and encouraged by the work we do together to sustain healthy and dynamic neighborhoods in our state.\n\nNovember 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nOur November 7 ballot elections will direct the next steps in our city government, in Granite School District construction plans, and in our new representation from Congressional District 3. Meanwhile, five initiatives for new state laws are gaining signatures to place them on next year’s ballot. And, in that 2018 election cycle, we will choose from a range of state, county, and federal candidates. More people are recognizing the value of their individual vote, but also the power of the information, ideas, and discussion that we consider beforehand.\n\nNotable among political topics these days are those involving tax increases. We expect accountability from our elected officials, but we are also being asked to look at community investments in the form of higher taxes. Just as with individual budgets and expenditures, it’s a matter of balance as well as responsibility to goals and values.\n\nThere are a number of questions to explore: What are the purposes or needs met by a current tax or an increase? Our conversations usually portray needs to improve roads, sidewalks, or community services, especially schools, police, and fire. How do the decision-makers prioritize needs and community values? Here, alignment of our views with candidates’ becomes even more significant after election time. How are taxes apportioned among businesses and private individuals, families, and those on fixed incomes? In order to attract business, leaders often negotiate specialized taxes as incentives. What are the long-term benefits or needs of a proposed tax or fee increase, and what are projections for other revenue? Currently, there are important questions about plans for a water pipeline and series of dams to supply water to the Wasatch Front. The projects would cost Utahns billions of dollars and are based on an idea that population could someday exceed supply.\n\nOur votes are important, but the questions and dialogue we share are key to the fair design of resources necessary to support our homes, communities, and lifestyles. Thank you for your involvement in the process!\n\nOctober 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nGreetings, in the last quarter of 2017!\n\nAs this year’s municipal election cycle enters its last month, we will find our mail-in ballots soon after October 17. If you’re looking for information, check out links at the West Valley City website wvc-ut.gov. Yes, you can still register online. And thank you for being an active voter!\n\nEven as I give this reminder about city elections, I note that my position as a state representative might seem to preclude me from business in other government levels. Respect for jurisdiction is definitely a point among lawmakers and residents. However, this summer, as Operation Rio-Grande has rolled out, we have seen how critical it is for governments to collaborate. Then, in September, Governor Herbert called a special session of the legislature to consider bills related to “the problem in Salt Lake.”\n\nNormally, an issue in one city is not expected OR accepted by lawmakers at the state level. However, since March, we have learned about conditions and circumstances around homelessness and seen the overlaps for city, county, and state policy-makers. Speaker Hughes, Mayors McAdams and Biskupski, along with police and numerous agencies, have worked together on ideas, argued differences, and pushed out decisions. The complexities of home-lessness have evolved into a statewide discussion, increasingly recognized as a statewide issue.\n\nJust as I must understand jurisdictions, I consider it my role to help others learn about all levels of our government system. The topics at our Neighbor Talk gatherings have included the initiatives gathering sig-natures for the 2018 ballot; county property taxes, affected by teacher salaries; the 2017 bond election for Granite District’s building plans; and the National Popular Vote bill we expect at the 2018 legislative session. All of these offer everyone a role for involvement and sharing ideas. I see activism and collaboration as a new normal, and I’m glad to help you join in!\n\nSeptember 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nBack-to-school images typically include sales, supplies, new clothes, and bulletin boards. Family thoughts shift to courses, carpools, and classmates. At one time, there was an expectation for legislators to note the school calendar and plan visits in order to better understand the views and experiences where the work is done, to learn from the real experts: our teachers and support staff. This year, as a legislator guest, I will join students and our education experts in classrooms throughout District 31.\n\nFor decades, our state legislators have passed laws that increasingly impact teachers’ work and students’ learning experience with decreasing dialogue from those they presume to support. In the name of “better education,” lawmakers may meet with administrators or, with even more distance from the classroom, sponsor bills in which language is composed by for-profit education businesses or political organizations. Teachers, parents, and students regularly watch and wait to learn new requirements designed “on their behalf.”\n\nI propose that we re-establish our traditional, neighborhood schools as the primary source of guiding expertise for policy-makers and policies under state consideration. We can all learn from our teachers, who are trained leaders, dedicated to our children and their futures. We can note the significant roles and characters of our secretaries, custodians, bus drivers, and other support staff who run the front-line operations in all our school facilities. We can applaud our principals and other administrators who direct the numerous elements and personnel under their super-vision. And, we can acknowledge families and neighbors for the initial and immediate inspiration and sustenance of our kids’ success.\n\nBack-to-school is the return to and affirmation of community-building, surely a good learning place for elected leaders. I’m looking forward to meeting staff and students while we share lessons!\n\nAugust 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nWhat influences our thinking about government? Where do we get our in-formation? On what do we base our opinions? At Neighbor Talk gatherings, teen-agers, young families, and retired people from a range of backgrounds, who use their “public voices” in a variety of roles are showing up to share views. The main point is that we are participating in the discussion and then creating new dialog with friends and neighbors. These ideas and observations inform me as your State Representative at the Capitol, and we all gain a more complete under-standing about the impacts of government direction. I value the opportunity to meet you, and I am constantly impressed by the thoughts and experiences you share. The next Neighbor Talks are August 10th and 24th. Watch for announcements to see the location in your neighborhood.\n\nNews media and social media give regular portrayals of the issues on our minds, but it’s the realities in our lives and the lives of our families, friends, and neighbors that are meaningful. It’s listening and civil interaction that lead to reasonable conclusions. It is the extension of the conversation, later to others, that gives all of us a balanced, authentic view, open to even more ideas. And it is this level of understanding that builds strong communities instead of feeding the fears that some are so ready to promote. I am excited to be part of the dynamic dialog developing in the West Valley neighbor-hoods I represent.\n\nHere are some topics coming up in our discussions: Transportation, Teacher Pay, Taxes, Law Enforcement, Air Quality, Liquor Laws, Healthcare, Elections. I hope you’ll give me a call or send an email to let me know more about your thoughts and ideas.\n\nJuly 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nNeighbor Talks have begun! Twice each month, I meet in a neighborhood location to talk about issues and report about my work for you at the state Capitol. At the June 15 discussion, one focus was on road construction and plans for the transportation system in our area. With this, the air quality is a growing concern, particularly around our schools. Rising population, emissions, transit, jobs, and taxes are all on our minds. At Neighbor Talks, we are sharing ideas and working together as neighbors to grow our local grassroots voice about these issues. We also discuss my role to include your perspectives and observations in state policy processes. The next Neighbor Talks are planned for July 13 and 27. Watch for announcements of locations!\n\nWestfest! At my booth, shared with Senator Karen Mayne, people noticed the maps of city council districts where elections will take place in the fall. Again this year, elections in West Valley City will be done by mail-in (or drop-box) ballots, beginning with the August primary vote. You will receive a ballot if you are registered, and you can check on that at wvc-ut.gov. More than ever, people are recognizing that our closest government connection is our city leader elections and how much difference each vote makes.\n\n“Talking politics” has become an interesting endeavor, with new dimensions and dynamics. I get energized by the sensible, intelligent, and articulate thoughts I hear in West Valley conversations. More than ever, we are examining our expectations about how levels and structures of government relate to us. We notice our own opinions and reasoning. We look for avenues to engage and take effective action in ways that fit inside our risk margins. I invite you to bring your ideas and friends to the next Neighbor Talk!\n\nJune 2017 – On the Radar with Representative Weight\n\nWe legislators finished the 2017 regular session with over 500 bills for the governor, but also with follow-up business on our minds. During the months before the next session, we will meet in committees to discuss reports and consider other changes in state law, particularly as they affect our local communities and neighborhoods.\n\nHere are some of the issues on my radar:\n\nA new homeless facility: This is set for South Salt Lake, but it’s just across the Jordan River near our Cultural Celebration Center. We now know the population will be 300 men, but there are still many questions.\n\nRoad construction: This is quite obvious around Hunter High School as this phase of the Mountain View Corridor expansion takes place. Planned development of 7200 West as a primary access to the new prison and proposed inland port is coming and will impact established housing and create new air quality issues.\n\nEducation: As a teacher, I share this with every parent as a top priority. As a legislator, I also note the fundamental role of education in a stable economy.\n\nI’m excited to work with other West Valley leaders and learn more about the smart planning, coordination, and management that make our city successful. Please join in the conversations on these and other issues at upcoming town halls starting in June – to be announced on Facebook or email to join the contact list."
