        "text": "May 22, 2024\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nLevi Vega-Sanchez, CAMP director, (509) 682-6974, lvega-sanchez@wvc.edu\n\nJennifer Korfiatis, interim public information officer, (509) 682-6650, jkorfiatis@wvc.edu\n\nAs the College Assistance Migrant Program at Wenatchee Valley College is preparing to celebrate the accomplishments of CAMP scholars from Cohort 14 (2022-2023) upon their upcoming graduation and Cohort 15’s (2023-2024) completion of their first year of college, they have received additional reason to celebrate: they received a $2.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Migrant Education. With a 15-year legacy at WVC, this achievement secures full program funding through 2029.\n\n“We are deeply honored to receive recognition for the success of this program,” said WVC CAMP Director Levi Vega-Sanchez. “This funding enables WVC CAMP to persist in our mission, providing comprehensive services and fostering positive educational experiences, thereby empowering students to successfully finish college and launch meaningful careers.”\n\nWVC CAMP, a federally funded program, is designed to help students from migrant and seasonal farm working backgrounds during their first year of college. The program provides academic and financial support services to empower students, so they have a strong foundation to build upon as they work toward a bachelor's degree.\n\n“We would like to thank CAMP students, WVC staff and leadership, and our community for their unwavering support during this grant rewrite process,” said Vega-Sanchez. “This experience has allowed us to reflect on the remarkable work that has been done over the past 15 years. The dedication of our former CAMP staff and the inspiring achievements of our CAMP alumni have empowered us to continue to build on the solid foundation that they have laid.”\n\nWVC’s CAMP is one of only nine programs funded across Washington state and has served 825 students since its establishment in 2009.\n\nWhile applying to renew the grant, WVC CAMP received letters of support from community partners, including North Central Educational Service District, CAFÉ, The Hispanic Business Council, Migrant Student Data Recruitment & Support, Eastmont School District, Wenatchee School District, Cascade School District, Lake Chelan School District, NCW Libraries, Opportunities Industrialization Center of Washington, WorkSource, the YMCA, and Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction.\n\n“We look forward to serving our counties within the WVC service district, guiding and advocating for our future and former students, while also seeking to uphold the culture of excellence that has been established in this program since 2009,” Vega-Sanchez continued. “From the bottom of our hearts, we thank every person who has supported CAMP at WVC.\"\n\nWVC CAMP is now accepting applications for the 2024-2025 school year. For more information, please visit the WVC CAMP website.\n\n###\n\nWenatchee Valley College enriches North Central Washington by serving educational and cultural needs of communities and residents throughout the service area.
