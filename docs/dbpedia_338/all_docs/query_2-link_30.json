        "text": "\"Faith & Blue Weekend provides a mechanism for our law enforcement professionals and our community members to relate on common ground. I know that our entire community, including our police officers, [is] stronger and more resilient as result of participating.\"\n\n\"“I find tremendous value in any collaborative initiative that builds partnerships, educates, and breaks down biases amongst law enforcement and the citizens we serve. The National Faith & Blue Weekend event that we participated in was a first for me. I found the event to be enormously valuable for all who participated.\"\n\n\"This is a very great program. A great way to do outreach to your community and continue the work we’ve been doing to build relationships with our communities, legitimacy and trust.\"\n\n\"As you can see, [the Faith & Blue toolkit] takes all the thinking out of it. You can just go onto the website and it is basically like following a recipe.\"\n\n\"Hope is the belief that destiny will not be written for us, but by us. By the men and women who are not content to settle for the world as it is. But who have the courage to make the world as it should be.\"\n\n\"Issues around criminal justice and policing are the prevailing issues of our time. National Faith & Blue Weekend is an effort like never before to elevate the voices of the majority of the American people who recognize that transformation is necessary, but law enforcement cannot do it alone.\"\n\n\"We want to meet you where you are… where you feel safe, where you feel most at home… and show you that we can be trusted.\"\n\n\"We commenced our sponsorship of Faith & Blue in the first year of the event, 2020. We were heartened by the mission of deepening mutual understanding between residents of all backgrounds and public safety professionals who represent every role in law enforcement. The event itself was a tremendous success and a beautiful example of what is possible when we get to know each other on a personal level. For that reason, we were enthused to continue our sponsorship in 2021 and were inspired by the 2,000 activities that took place in every state of the nation.\"\n\n\"Our Foundation believes deeply in the vision of Faith & Blue – creating a safer, more equitable world for all. We are so grateful to the participating community organizations, faith leaders, and law enforcement professionals who made the 2021 Faith & Blue so successful. With more than 100,000 people participating this year, they are moving mountains.\"\n\n\"We appreciate the opportunity to work with all partners in this initiative in support of strengthening their communities. We encourage continued efforts to increase this collaboration and build relationships beyond National Faith & Blue Weekend, including during the new Quarterly Days of Engagement. By coming together, we can enhance the foundations of safe, just, and unified communities.\""
