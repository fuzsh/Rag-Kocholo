        "text": "Public Health is a dynamic field that provides career opportunities in a wide variety of settings including federal, state, and local health agencies, community health departments, healthcare organizations, hospitals, allied health providers, HMOâ€™s, research organizations, crisis agencies, educational institutions, and many other areas. The Public Health Science for Transfer degree (AS-T in Public Health Science) is designed to prepare students for related programs at the bachelor's degree level and provides comprehensive preparation for upper-division work in health-related majors. Students will be able to apply a multidimensional approach to health that incorporates the study of social, behavioral, and physiological sciences. Additionally, the degree provides an introduction to various career pathways within this field. Public Health Science includes the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. It bridges the gap between scientific discoveries and the application of research in the community to improve the quality of life. The degree is interdisciplinary in nature and students will gain an understanding of the biopsychosocial basis for health and healthy populations. Public health professionals work to track disease outbreaks, reduce health disparities, advocate for healthcare equity and accessibility, and shed light on why some of us are more likely to suffer from poor health than others. Public health professionals also work to prevent problems from happening or recurring through implementing educational programs, recommending policies, administering services and conducting research. The Associate in Science in Public Health Science for Transfer degree (AS-T in Public Health Science) is a 60-unit program which provides students the lower division coursework required for transfer to a CSU institution for the major in Health Science, Health Science with Health Education option, Health Science with Public Health option, Health Science with Community Health option, Health Science with Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Health Education, Public Health, Public Health Promotion, Kinesiology with Health Education, Kinesiology with Health Science option, Kinesiology with Health and Wellness Promotion, Kinesiology with Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Collaborative Health and Human Services with Community Health option, and majors in related fields in pursuit of a baccalaureate degree. Students must complete the following requirements: 1. 60 semester or 90 quarter CSU-transferable units 2. the California State University-General Education-Breadth pattern (CSU GE-Breadth); OR the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) pattern. 3. a minimum of 18 semester or 27 quarter units in the major or area of emphasis as determined by the community college district. 4. obtainment of a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. 5. earn a grade of C or better in all courses required for the major or area of emphasis.\n\nMajor Core Requirements (31-32 units)\n\nCourse NumberCourse TitleUnitsHSCI008Contemporary Health3 unitsHSCI014Concepts of Public Health and Society3 unitsSelect one:\n\nMATH010\n\nMATH010H\n\nElementary Statistics\n\nHonors Elementary Statistics\n\n4 units\n\n4 unitsBIOL 010 and BIOL 010L must be taken together.\n\nBIOL010\n\nBIOL010L\n\nIntroduction to Biology\n\nIntroduction to Biology Lab\n\n3 units\n\n1 unitSelect one:\n\nCHEM002\n\nCHEM001A\n\nIntroductory Chemistry\n\nGeneral Chemistry\n\n4 units\n\n5 unitsPSYC001General Psychology3 unitsBIOL047Human Anatomy5 unitsBIOL048Human Physiology5 units\n\nMajor Electives List A (3-5 units)\n\nCourse NumberCourse TitleUnitsBIOL045Microbiology5 unitsHSCI010Human Sexuality3 unitsNUTR015Human Nutrition3 units\n\nTotal Major Units: 34-37 units\n\nCSU transferable electives courses are required when the major units plus transfer GE units total is less than 60."
