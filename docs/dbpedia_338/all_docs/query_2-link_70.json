        "text": "🌟 Celebrating Pioneers in Venture Capital 🌟 . Today on #MondayMoversandShakers, we CELEBRATE the phenomenal Arian Simone and Ayana Parsons, the driving forces behind the Fearless Fund — the world's first VC fund built by Women of Color (WOC) for WOC. 🙌🏾✨ . Arian, the President and CEO, is more than just a title. With an MBA from Florida A&M and 17+ years of entrepreneurial prowess, she's a force in the industry. From curating billion-dollar campaigns for renowned corporate giants to founding Fearless Magazine, her journey and dedication are nothing short of inspirational. 🌍🚀 . Then we have Ayana Parsons, the COO, who brings a wealth of knowledge from consumer markets and international business strategy. With nearly two decades of experience and a past role as the Global Head of Retail at the World Economic Forum, Ayana's expertise is instrumental in shaping Fearless Fund's transformative vision. 🌐💼 . What's special about the Fearless Fund? They're more than just a VC; they're rectifiers. They're working tirelessly to bridge the shocking gap in venture capital funding for WOC founders, ensuring they receive the rightful opportunities and capital they deserve. 💡 . Despite women-led companies performing 63% better on average, the numbers tell a tale of disparity. In 2018, only 2.2% of VC funding went to female-founded companies, and even less than 1% to WOC-founded businesses. Fearless Fund was established to shatter these barriers, and in doing so, redefine the narrative for WOC-led businesses. . Having recently attended the Fearless Fund summit, I was deeply moved by their mission and impact. Meeting Ayana personally only reinforced my belief in the power of collaboration, especially during trying times. We share an unwavering commitment to empowering founders, and together, our collaborative ecosystem can ignite significant change. 🔥❤️ . To the entire Fearless Fund team and community navigating the unjust lawsuit, remember: challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what makes life meaningful. . Here's to resilience, collaboration, and the future we are all building. 🔥 . #fearlessfund #venturecapital #empowerment #wocinbusiness #changemakers #womenofcolor #fundingequality #businessinnovation #femalefounders #breakingbarriers #startupgrowth #entrepreneurshipforall\n\nAs a startup founder in your company's earliest days, you've got to wear many hats: as leader, fundraiser, product developer, head of HR and marketer. As Nvidia's founder-CEO Jensen Huang put it in a recent interview, you've got to continually trick yourself into thinking it isn't as hard as it really is. The Bain Capital Ventures team has been through all of these ups and downs building and investing in companies, and we want to share some insights that can help you avoid unnecessary mistakes that make the journey even harder. That's why I'm happy to finally share a new early-stage guide called The Head Start — with lessons for each of those hats mentioned above. You'll find contributions from Noah Breslow, Leslie Crowe, Sarah Hinkfuss, Kevin Zhang, Amit S Bhatti, Saanya Ojha, Slater Stich, Jeff Williams, Allison Braley and Matt Harris. We've also included a downloadable fundraising pitch deck guide to walk you through the must-haves, paired with slides from BCV portfolio companies to show you what good looks like. We'll be adding to it over time, as well. If you're a founder or working at a startup, we hope this becomes the type of page you bookmark and come back to. I'd love to hear what you think! #venturecapital #fundraising #leadership #marketing #startups\n\nThank you to Gary Stewart for inviting me Anthony Matos, Sherrise Pond, Kange Kaneene, and Ricardo Roberts to speak at the Yale School of Management Private Equity & Venture Capital Symposium about the experience of diverse and female founders. And - thank you also to Tsikata Apenyo for organizing an incredible event. We spent a lot of the panel talking about fundraising -- and I had the opportunity to share stories about Mirra Levitt and my seed round in 2017 where we were both pregnant and we heard feedback like \"you don't make my spidey sense tingle\" and \"sounds like a nice lifestyle business for two moms.\" Persistence paid off for us, and we found fabulous supportive investors like HearstLab (focused on female founders, thank you Eve Burton for believing in us) and Great Oaks Venture Capital. The earliest stages are the hardest, I think, particularly for diverse and female founders. There's often nothing for investors to go on except for the market size, idea and who the founders are. And, when VCs are pattern-matching, consciously or not, they are thinking about the archetypes of other successful founders, who... newsflash... are mostly white men. Just yesterday, Priori held its annual company kick-off, and we were lucky to have Andy Dunn, founder of Bonobos, speak, and one of his 'hot-takes' was that building a start-up is like eating glass. That is even more true for diverse and female founders, and I'm grateful at least to play a small part in shining a spotlight. Andy also said working a start-up is the best job you'll ever have. 10 years in, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n#FounderDiaries are in full swing as I flashback to the Half Moon Bay venture summit I attended several years ago. I had the chance to learn from Tim Draper and his father, William Draper, of DFJ Ventures and when I recall that day, it's hard to forget the flip that was switched for me in an otherwise turbulent chapter. I remember feeling out of place at this venture event: I was not yet a #founder, freshly out of cancer treatment, post-divorce court, and only just finding normalcy with my kids in our new chapter. We (me and my imposter syndrome) had no business being in that room. Then, things changed. Amidst the luncheon small talk, the man next to me leaned over to say, “Up until recently, the average age of DFJ portfolio CEOs has been south of 30 years old — today it's north of 40.” \"Well, I'm north of 40,\" I thought as my new friend went back to his salad and I lit up inside. I ditched my clingy imposter syndrome and the fear that came with it and morphed into a sponge. I soaked up every drop of #founder wisdom I could and laughed that I had written myself off as \"done\" and \"past the point of founder.\" My lunch mate and the Drapers ignited a drive within me to let go of my fears and tackle a new venture, no matter my age. 'North of 40' is the new 'south of 30!' Being a founder is HARD, no matter your birth year; age is not (and cannot be) a factor in founder greatness. Fearlessness, however, makes ALL the difference and is thankfully ageless. Holding both the ability to be fearless in your pursuits AND the permission to feel fear when justified seems to be a key ingredient in the makeup of a founder, not their age. Whether you're south of 30,' 'north of 40,' or somewhere in between, age is NOT a factor in success. Venturing into the unknown without being held back by fear is what sets founders up for success. As I type this, Team LUWI is putting finishing touches on a project I CANNOT WAIT to share more about. We're confident, excited, and fearless about what's to come; Here's to those flip-switching moments that we can look back on with gratitude and always learn from! More to come!\n\nI'm a pretty honest guy, so I lean into and share my failures (learnings) a lot. But the other day, my mate Bobbi Montgomery Heath dropped me a voice note that went something along the lines of: \"It's awesome that you share the lessons you've learned and where things have gone wrong, but maybe take the time to share what's gone well too, because clearly they have!\" And she's right. I think lots of us are shy of celebrating successes, it feels like we're bragging or maybe being too salesy. But the reality is that whilst our failures may inform us, it's our successes that define us. So as we head into the last stretch of 2023, here are a few of mine, EmergeOne's and our clients' over the last few years: 📈 Runrating 7 figure top line. 🧑🏼💻 Built a growing team of 27 tech and venture CFOs, FDs and finance pros. 🚪 Took Go Instore (Now Emplifi) through an exit for a BIG number. 💸 Current client AutogenAI just raised ~$20m from Blossom Capital. 💰 And Continuum Industries bagged $10m led by Singular. 💵 Whilst Log my Care raised >£3m. 🧠 With QV Bioelectronics raising £2m + >£800k in grants. 🏦 And raising £750k debt for LDSK (LiveDOOH Signkick). 🚀 We've launched a fractional fund CFO offering to help emerging VC funds. 🎙️ Interviewed 100+ awesome VCs, angels, founders on Nothing Ventured. ✍🏾 Launched a newsletter with over 1,100 organic subscribers. 🍸 Sponsored our first ever event for the London Venture Capital Network. 👱🏻♀️ Hired the brilliant Karla McNeilage to boost our presence cross platform.

Starting a business is a big and sometimes terrifying step. There are many factors to consider, such as finding the right co-founders, understanding the competition, and identifying and anticipating your customers' needs. Fuelling your business's growth with Venture Capital funding adds another layer of complexity, with increased expectations on go-to-market, market potential, and the gruelling commitment it takes from founders. That's why Antler is partnering with AlbionVC, Sie Ventures, JV Investment Network and WVC:E to give ambitious entrepreneurs the opportunity to learn from the founders a few steps ahead of them and learn from seasoned venture capitalists. This half-day with Google for Startups features panels and workshops for you to hear from top founders on their journey of building their businesses and practical insights from investors: 🚀 Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital 🚀 Susan Lin, Partner at Felix Capital 🚀 Nicole A.
