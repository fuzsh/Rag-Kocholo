        "text": "I have NEVER liked working out, especially in a gym! I LOVE F45! All of the trainers I have worked out with are so encouraging and helpful. They have done a great job creating a community. I feel better than I have felt in years! I am 58 years old‚Ä¶ if I can do it, so can you!!\n\nI am a former OTF member that was looking for a change and a challenge and found that at F45! I have seen more results in the 6 months I‚Äôve been a member than the 5 years I was a member at OTF. The coaches at F45 are knowledgeable and make the workouts enjoyable!\n\nI‚Äôve been attending F45 for six months now, and I can confidently say it has been a transformative experience. The trainers are exceptional, pushing me to new heights while maintaining a fun and supportive atmosphere. The workouts are exhilarating, targeting different muscle groups and boosting my fitness level. The sense of camaraderie among fellow members is inspiring.\n\nFor well over a year, I have been a dedicated member of the F45 community, an experience that has completely transformed my life. I‚Äôve shed 45lbs, not only achieving but truly thriving in the fittest condition I‚Äôve ever been. The newfound vitality I‚Äôve gained extends beyond the gym ‚Äì it energizes my home life and elicits an abundance of compliments.\n\nI had to have time off recently due to a work injury. Since I have re-started back all the coaches have been encouraging and providing me exercise modifications. It is honestly such a great feeling because I can still work hard with the adjustments the coaches give me.\n\nI‚Äôve been a member for 5 years now and would never consider another gym! Staff are not only friendly and welcoming they are knowledgeable whether it be needing help with swapping out exercises due to injuries or nutritional advice! WOULD 100% Recommend coming into our studio and join the fun! üí™üèº\n\nF45 is not just a place to work out, get fit and get your wellbeing and fitness goals‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so so much more. Is a big family a support group of incredible non judgemental people who will encourage you in your journey and celebrate your victories. F45 changed my view about working out!\n\nSessions have been just fantastic! A varied range of people in the classes from beginners to really advanced so I didn‚Äôt feel too out of my depth when joining. I can already see great results after 6 weeks ‚Äì instructors are really helpful, friendly and super supportive to get technique right."
