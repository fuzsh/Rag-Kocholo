        "text": "We are committed to providing increased access to emergency trauma care to rural Americans. In a life- or limb-threatening medical emergency, a successful patient recovery often depends on the amount of time it takes to deliver that patient to the trauma center or advanced health care medical center. Approximately 90 percent of Air Evacâ€™s patient transports originate from a rural area as defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That is why more than 90 percent of our aircraft are based in rural areas.\n\nYour Future in Helicopter Air Ambulance Services\n\nAir Evac Lifeteam (AEL) is the preeminent provider of air ambulance services to communities in need of advanced emergency health care and rapid medical transport. AEL operates more than 150 helicopter air ambulance bases across 18 states. Flight crews, consisting of a pilot, flight nurse and flight paramedic, are on duty seven days a week to respond to the scene of an emergency, or provide transportation between medical facilities."
