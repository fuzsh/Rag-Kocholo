        "text": "The West Valley Connector (WVC) project will be a 100% zero-emission Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, the first stage of the San Bernardino County zero-emission Bus Initiative and second BRT route in San Bernardino County.\n\nPhase I of the project is 19 miles and will upgrade a portion of existing Route 61 which runs along Holt Boulevard, adding approximately 3.5 miles as center running, dedicated bus-only lanes. There will be 21 stations in Phase I that will provide an improved transit connection to Ontario International Airport (ONT) and help build transit connectivity by linking ONT, two Metrolink lines (San Bernardino and Riverside) and multiple major activity centers along the route including Ontario Mills and Victoria Gardens. Headways will be 10 minutes in the peak commute period and 15 minutes off-peak, providing a high level of service to the community.\n\nNew Traffic Patterns on Holt Boulevard\n\nStarting the week of March 25, drivers will notice a new traffic pattern on Holt Boulevard between Corona Avenue and Grove Avenue. Crews will restripe and shift all lanes of traffic to the south to create a protected work area along westbound (WB) Holt Boulevard while construction takes place to widen the WB roadway to accommodate the new center running bus lane. Motorists are encouraged to plan ahead, leave early, and follow construction signage for the new lane configuration.\n\nIn the coming weeks, crews will continue these activities in phases on WB Holt Boulevard along the future center-running BRT lane between Central Avenue and Corona Avenue. Motorists are encouraged to plan ahead, leave early, and follow construction signage for the new lane configuration.\n\nThis configuration will be in place for approximately 10 months. Two lanes will be maintained in each direction of Holt Boulevard during this time, however street parking will be eliminated in the work zones for the duration of the project.\n\nOnce work is complete along WB Holt Boulevard, all lanes will shift north to the newly constructed roadway and crews will perform the same work in the opposite direction to accommodate the widening of the eastbound (EB) roadway."
