        "text": "One method of understanding the meanings of new words is to analyze the different parts of the word and the meanings of those parts. Many new words are formed by adding an affix (a prefix or a suffix) to the beginning or end of a Latin or Greek root or root word.\n\nPrefixes are added to the beginning of root words; suffixes are added to the end of root words. Prefixes and suffixes are word parts that carry meaning. For example, the prefix un- means means “not” or “the opposite of” as in the word unusual, and the suffix -est means “the most” as in the word smartest.\n\nCommon prefixes\n\nPrefixDefinitionExamplesanti-againstanticlimaxde-oppositedevaluedis-not; opposite ofdiscoveren-, em-cause toenact, empowerfore-before; front offoreshadow, forearmin-, im-inincome, impulsein-, im-, il-, ir-notindirect, immoral, illiterate, irreverentinter-between; amonginterruptmid-middlemidfieldmis-wronglymisspellnon-notnonviolentover-over; too muchovereatpre-beforepreviewre-againrewritesemi-half; partly; not fullysemifinalsub-undersubwaysuper-above; beyondsuperhumantrans-acrosstransmitun-not; opposite ofunusualunder-under; too littleunderestimate\n\nDownload a copy of the common prefixes chart.\n\nCommon suffixes\n\nSuffixDefinitionExamples-able, -ibleis; can beaffordable, sensible-al, -ialhaving characteristics ofuniversal, facial-edpast tense verbs; adjectivesthe dog walked,\n\nthe walked dog-enmade ofgolden-er, -orone who;\n\nperson connected withteacher, professor-ermoretaller-estthe mosttallest-fulfull ofhelpful-ichaving characteristics ofpoetic-ingverb forms;\n\npresent participlessleeping-ion, -tion, -ation,\n\n-tionact; processsubmission, motion,\n\nrelation, edition-ity, -tystate ofactivity, society-ive, -ative,\n\n-itiveadjective form of nounactive, comparative,\n\nsensitive-lesswithouthopeless-lyhow something islovely-mentstate of being; act ofcontentment-nessstate of; condition ofopenness-ous, -eous, -ioushaving qualities ofriotous, courageous,\n\ngracious-s, -esmore than onetrains, trenches-ycharacterized bygloomy"
