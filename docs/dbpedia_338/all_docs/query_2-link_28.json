Together we will canvass neighborhoods and knock on doors to ensure homes have working smoke alarms. We will also educate families about home fire safety, build evacuation plans with them and document our services.\n\nWhen you arrive at the event location, follow the signs to check in. When everyone has arrived, there may be a short rally which gives us an opportunity to provide simple training and tips, as well as to celebrate you for generously volunteering your time!\n\nYou'll meet your installation team members (if you don't already know them) and receive supplies such as smoke alarms, a drill, educational materials, and a map of your route for the day. Then it's time to head out!\n\nMost of your day will be spent visiting homes, installing smoke alarms, and providing home fire safety education to residents. You may be given scheduled appointments at particular homes on your route, or you may be knocking on doors to offer to install free smoke alarms, or a combination of both. In either case, you will be providing a valuable service to your community and helping to save lives.\n\nAbsolutely! We prefer everyone to register ahead of time so we are prepared to provide an excellent volunteer experience. If you don’t have time to register ahead, that’s okay, we will have forms available onsite.\n\nYouth under 18 may volunteer at Sound the Alarm events but we do require parental consent. Please print out and have your parent/guardian fill out the Parental Consent form. Bring it with you to the registration table on the day of the event. Youth can serve in the documenter and educator positions on installation teams."
