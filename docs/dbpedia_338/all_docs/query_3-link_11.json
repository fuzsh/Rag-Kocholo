        "text": "It's always interesting to see how people act toward something. Following a lot of marketers, and being in a marketing position myself, I see a lot of trends come and go. I see people jump on the bandwagons as they come, hoping to stand out. I see people champion platforms like Meerkat as the next big revolution, only to see movement shift to Twitter's own client Periscope.\n\nI've used social media since 2004, when I finally joined MySpace and was greeted by my then best friend Tom. Facebook quickly followed, then nothing kind of happened with any momentum for a while later. I'm currently on those platforms, Instagram and SnapChat.\n\nAs a person, adopting social media makes sense so long as you have a use for them. It's fun to play around, and that's how I'll discover whether something would be of use for my position. Can this have a workable benefit? Will spending time, money and resources learning and adapting this platform produce real results for our department?\n\nSeeing peer departments, colleges, universities and the like adopt every single social platform is often confusing. Social media is, without a doubt, very important for colleges to engage the student body - that's where they are. Even when they're \"taking notes,\" they're on social media.\n\nBut not every brand, company or department needs every social media account. Today I saw a small event have an Instagram account. It took me back, because the event doesn't last for long - what is the benefit of me, or a follower, to engage with that? Without a built-in or established follower count, the chances of getting any real result back or engagement is likely low.\n\nAt Eberly, we have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, a LinkedIn University page (work in progress) and, because Google-related reasons, Google+. Each of those has different positives and negatives and different missions for us. We spent about 3 weeks coming up with uses for the LinkedIn page, research how our peers were using it and the kinds of things we think would add value in the college's goals. We didn't take it lightly, and we still aren't. We're thinking, concocting, simmering away with ideas to make it valuable for anyone to consider connecting with us.\n\nEach platform must have a point, and each point must have goals. 'Goals' is an easy buzzword to throw around, but I liken it to my time at Arts & Entertainment putting butts in seats - you have to have a reason for everything you do. What's the benefit of a SnapChat account for a small department? What good would a Facebook page for a one-time event do?\n\nAt Arts & Entertainment, we were selling shows. We were selling a fun night out, a great time with family and friends, an experience you'll talk about for days, weeks, years later. At Eberly, we're selling the college experience. What our students will learn here will transform their lives. They'll look back fondly at their time here, and hopefully as alumni, they'll want to keep following us with interest.\n\nSimply putting out content to fill blank space on these platforms is not the answer, nor does it serve any purpose. Social media is there to promote, to raise awareness, to sell something. It only works when you genuinely have something worth sharing, giving a benefit to the follower and a reason to keep following.\n\nOh, and not every single thing you do needs a hashtag.\n\n#blessed"
