        "text": "In partnership with the Matewan Public Library, we’ve planned a special outing for our coalfield kids and families. Following a book reading from Cora’s Faces Behind the Dust, kids will participate in a special craft led by our town librarian, Kathi Sherrill. We’re also planning a show-and-tell of Mine Wars era artifacts as well as a scavenger hunt throughout the Museum. We’ll be providing lunch, too!\n\nEach year on the date closest to the anniversary of the May 19 Battle of Matewan, the Town of Matewan hosts its annual Heritage Day, which features the live re-enactment of the shootout! This year, the Museum pitched in with some events of our own! All of our events were held inside the Museum’s very own community center, which will grow into a new shared resource in the coming years! In case you missed it, we’re recapping some special moments from this weekend’s events.\n\nBring your stories, your treasures, and your appetite! The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum is thrilled to announce a series of Community Archiving Days designed to preserve and share the rich tapestry of the coalfields. Whether it's a quilt passed down through generations, photos capturing moments in time, or articles that tell the tales of struggle and triumph, we want to document it for posterity.\n\nThis June, Thomas and I had the pleasure of visiting the Buffalo Creek Memorial Library in Man, West Virginia. It was an inspirational trip, and it solidified the intricate and powerful connection between libraries and museums in our communities.\n\nThese bandanas gave rise to the slang term “rednecks”, referring to the multiracial, multiethnic collective that rose up in solidarity with each other to fight for their right to unionize.\n\nIt’s hard for me to believe that I’ve already been a part of the West Virginia Mine Wars Museum team for just over a year. It seems like yesterday that I came up to the Museum for my orientation. This has been one of the busiest, most productive years of my life and career, and I wanted to give folks some insight into what I’ve been doing this past year with the Museum."
