        "text": "Keynote Speaker - Mark Black\n\nResilience Expert, Speaker, Consultant, Coach\n\nResurgo Training Solutions, Inc.\n\nIn 2005, Mark Black became the only man in history to complete a marathon with someone else's heart and lungs.\n\nHe has worked with more than 150,000 people and spoken to more than 500 audiences; written and contributed to several books including: Live Life from the Heart and Chicken Soup for the Canadian Soul.\n\nHis clients include Mercedes-Benz, Exxon Mobil, Amway, Sun Life, professional associations and all levels of government.\n\nA husband and father of three, Mark was born with a life-threatening heart defect, and underwent open-heart surgery on his first day of life, and was not expected to live a long life.\n\nMark had battled his condition and its limitations for twenty-two years when his doctors informed him that time had run out. His heart was failing badly and without a rare heart and double-lung transplant, he would not survive another year.\n\nIn October 2001, Mark moved thousands of kilometers from home and was put on the transplant waiting list where he spent almost a with time running out. By the grace of God, a donor was found and Mark received a second chance at life and has not wasted a moment since because he knows exactly how precious time is.\n\nMark's transplant is a treatment, not a cure.\n\nHe continues to take medication to prevent rejection of the organs. The average lifespan of someone with his transplant is 5-10 years. It's been 16 years since Mark's transplant. He is in his 40s. It is very unlikely Mark will live to see his 50's. This is what makes his message so powerful. He lives the strategies and principles he teaches and is filled with passion and purpose for his work precisely because he doesn't know how much more time he'll be afforded to do it.\n\nJohn Beckius\n\nExecutive Director, Air Cargo Division\n\nTransportation Security Administration\n\nJohn Beckius started his Federal Government career when he joined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a Special Agent in 1991 in Indianapolis, Indiana.
