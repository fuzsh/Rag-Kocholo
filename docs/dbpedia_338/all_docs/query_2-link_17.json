        "text": "The League of Women Voters of California is a 501(c) 4 grassroots membership nonprofit working to build a more equitable California for all who live here. We are a nonpartisan organization, which means that we do not support or oppose candidates or political parties. However, we are a political organization and we work to engage all Californians in acting on the issues that matter to them, to build political power and voice in communities historically underrepresented in the halls of government, to enact solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing our state, and to drive every eligible voter to cast their ballot. We are an intersectional, inclusive, and multi-issue organization.\n\nWe have a powerful member based network of over 60 local, grassroots Leagues across the state who work on local issues, develop and train local civic leaders, and organize around critical policy and social issues. We use an integrated voter engagement model, which research shows is one of the best ways to increase voter turnout and civic participation. Integrated Voter Engagement means that we work on the ground in our communities year round to engage people in issues and advocacy, and do not just reach out to our communities leading up to elections. But we ramp up our efforts in election years to fully engage people to turn out, vote, and use their power.\n\nOur sister 501(c)3 organization, the League of Women Voters of California Education Fund is fully focused on countering mis/disinformation, community education, voter engagement, and closing the voter/civic participation gap in California.\n\nOur Mission\n\nEmpowering Voters. Defending Democracy.\n\nOUR VISION\n\nWe envision a democracy where every person has the desire, the right, the knowledge, and the confidence to participate.\n\nMembership\n\nBe the change. League members across the country, the state, and in local communities are driving change, building a democracy for people not politicians, engaging voters, and fighting for equity for all people. Protecting our democracy and working for justice will take every one of us â€“ and there is a home in the League for everyone. We welcome all people who share our vision for a more equitable California for all.\n\nJoin the League, and you will:\n\nBe at the forefront of moving forward justice and equity in our state;\n\nHave the opportunity to work in community on issues that matter to YOU;\n\nBe a leader in building a better democracy for all people;\n\nEnsure ALL votes are counted and ALL voices are heard;\n\nBe a member of the local, state and national Leagues;\n\nKnow that your support adds to our grassroots strength, our political power, our influence, and our financial resources to make progress."
