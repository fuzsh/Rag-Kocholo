        "text": "Episode 31 of Petworking features Daniella Morgan-Pascualvaca from Mella Pet Care, and discusses the company's innovative approach to at-home pet diagnostics, along with its experience in the venture capital ecosystem, where it was selected to participate in the Leap Venture Studio, and received an investment from Mark Cuban on Shark Tank.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from the episode:\n\nMella is bringing vet-grade diagnostics into pet parents' homes, addressing the gap in preventative care.\n\nIts devices (thermometers and scales) help establish baseline health data, crucial for early detection of issues.\n\nStress-free home measurements provide more accurate data than stressful vet visits.\n\nMella's unified software platform integrates data from multiple devices, simplifying pet health monitoring.\n\nFuture plans include a pet blood pressure monitor and telehealth integration.\n\nStrategic partnerships have been key to Mella's growth:\n\nLeap Venture Studio provided crucial mentorship and market research.\n\nShark Tank appearance led to investment from Mark Cuban, boosting visibility.\n\nAlong with other companies offering pet parents solutions to monitor their pet's health at home, Mella Pet Care is at the forefront of a shift in the pet healthcare paradigm. By empowering pet parents with tools to monitor their pets' health consistently, they're addressing a critical gap in preventative care.\n\nThe future of pet healthcare promises to be more proactive and data-driven, potentially leading to earlier detection of health issues, more informed veterinary care, and ultimately, healthier, happier pets.\n\nNationwide recently announced that it will cancel pet insurance coverage for about 100,000 pets, citing rising veterinary costs and profitability concerns.\n\nWhile the company stated that the cancellations were not based on specific pet characteristics like age, breed, or claim history, the sad reality of the situation is that many older pets will be affected by this decision. This is a crucial point because:\n\nThese pets are often the most in need of insurance coverage due to higher healthcare needs\n\nThey may face significant difficulties finding alternative coverage because almost all pet insurance carriers exclude pre-existing conditions\n\nThis situation could create a serious insurance gap for a vulnerable group of pets and their owners, and underscores a significant problem in the pet insurance market. Because pets are considered property in the eyes of the law, we're left with a situation where a health insurance product is underwritten as property & casualty insurance. As such, pet owners who have paid for a lifetime of insurance coverage for their pets may face a situation where the lifetime investment that they made to ensure that their pets have insurance coverage when they need it most goes for naught.\n\nIn light of this concerning development, on the latest episode of Petworking, I sat down with Miles Thorson of Odie Pet Insurance to discuss the implications and potential solutions for affected pet owners. Our conversation revealed some promising innovations in the pet insurance industry that could help address these challenges.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the episode:\n\nMiles and I discussed Nationwide's recent announcement to cancel coverage for about 100,000 pets, citing rising veterinary costs and profitability concerns.\n\nMiles explained that inflation in veterinary care costs is a real issue, driven by factors like vet shortages and burnout.\n\nWe highlighted the problem of older pets potentially losing coverage and facing difficulties finding new insurance due to pre-existing conditions.\n\nMiles introduced Odie Pet Insurance's new approach, which includes:\n\nExtending coverage back to the date of a pet's prior policy when switching from another provider\n\nAiming to broaden the pet insurance market with lower entry barriers and more options\n\nNot considering healed conditions as pre-existing when switching policies\n\nWe also discussed the broader implications for the pet insurance industry, including:\n\nThe need for more consumer-friendly regulations.\n\nThe potential for pet insurance to help reduce veterinary burnout by enabling more pets to receive care\n\nThe importance of educating consumers about the value of pet insurance\n\nMiles talked about Odie's plans to use data and technology to offer more personalized pricing and coverage, including:\n\nPartnerships with pet spend reward cards to gather data on pet care habits\n\nIntegrating pharmacy capabilities into their member portal\n\nUsing data to identify trends and offer more favorable rates to responsible pet owners\n\nFinally, we explored the potential for pet insurance companies to contribute to pet nutrition research and improve overall pet health outcomes.\n\nThe conversation concluded with a discussion on how increasing pet insurance adoption could lead to better health outcomes for pets and potentially transform the animal healthcare paradigm.\n\nIf you're a pet parent, you've likely experienced the anxiety of wondering if your furry companion is in pain or discomfort. However, for many pet parents, the cost of veterinary care, and the inability to know whether a pet is truly experiencing health issues, results in a decision to postpone a visit to the vet, which ultimately results in poor health outcomes for the pet.\n\nAs a pet parent, I've experienced firsthand the critical importance of early detection. My journey with Peony has been a testament to this:\n\nShortly after adopting her in 2017, Peony pulled a groin muscle. During treatment, a routine SNAP test revealed she was heartworm positive - a condition she had tested negative for at the shelter. Catching this early was potentially life-saving.\n\nIn 2019, while petting Peony, I felt a lump. My immediate decision to have it checked led to an early melanoma diagnosis, significantly improving her prognosis.\n\nMore recently, we were able to address neurological episodes promptly due to timely veterinary intervention.\n\nThese experiences underscore the irreplaceable value of attentive pet parenting and regular vet check-ups. But imagine having a device that could alert you to potential health issues even between these crucial moments of discovery and scheduled visits. That's where Maven.Pet comes in.\n\nOn the latest episode of Petworking, I had the pleasure of speaking with Guilherme Coelho, co-founder and CEO of Maven.Pet, about their AI-driven, innovative wearable health monitoring device for pets.\n\nHere's how Maven's AI is changing the game:\n\n24/7 Health Monitoring: Maven's device attaches to a pet's collar, continuously tracking vital health metrics like respiratory rate, activity levels, and sleep patterns. But it's not just collecting data - the AI is constantly analyzing this information in real-time.\n\nEarly Detection is Key: Inspired by a personal experience with late-stage canine arthritis, Maven aims to catch health issues earlier, potentially improving outcomes and reducing treatment costs.\n\nPersonalized Baselines: The AI establishes a unique health baseline for each pet, considering factors like breed, age, and medical history. This allows for truly individualized health monitoring.\n\nVeterinary Integration: By partnering with clinics and integrating with practice management systems (PIMs), Maven provides vets with valuable insights between visits. By connecting with PIMS, Maven can access a pet's complete medical history, provide vets with pre-appointment insights, and flag potential issues based on both real-time and historical data\n\nAI-Powered Analysis: An artificial intelligence system analyzes the data, flagging potential issues for veterinary review. By processing vast amounts of data, the AI can identify subtle changes that might escape human notice, potentially predicting health issues before obvious symptoms appear.\n\nBalancing Information: While vets receive detailed data, pet owners get a simplified app view to avoid unnecessary worry.\n\nFuture Potential: There's exciting potential for partnerships with pet insurance companies to offer data-driven, personalized pricing.\n\nThe Maven system represents a significant step forward in preventative pet healthcare. By providing vets with a more complete picture of a pet's health over time, it enables earlier interventions and potentially better outcomes. It's not about replacing professional judgment, but enhancing it. The AI provides vets with pre-appointment insights and flags potential issues, empowering them to make more informed decisions. For pet owners, it offers peace of mind knowing their furry family members are being continuously monitored.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on wearable health monitoring for pets? How do you see technology shaping the future of veterinary care?\n\nð§ Listen to the full episode to learn more about the game-changing potential of wearable pet health monitors and why they could become an essentia\n\nThis podcast episode features Peter Kenseth, Vice President & Partner at Maia Strategy Group, interviewing Miles Thorson, founder and CEO of Odie Pet Insurance.\n\nKey points discussed:\n\nPet insurance adoption is still low in the US (~4% for dogs), so there is a huge potential market. Most carriers are not competing for share yet, but trying to grow the overall market.\n\nOdie Pet Insurance is taking a novel approach by focusing on distribution through employee benefits and white labeling, rather than selling directly to consumers. This helps lower customer acquisition costs.\n\nThey are offering more flexible coverage options and price points to appeal to a broader range of customers.\n\nMiles sees an opportunity for pet insurers to work with vets, pet food companies, and others in the pet health ecosystem to drive better health outcomes, which benefits everyone.\n\nOdie is exploring partnerships around pet nutrition, genetic testing, medications, and more to provide added value to customers and control costs.\n\nMiles believes pet insurance carriers need to innovate with their coverage models, use of data/technology, and partnerships to make pet insurance more accessible and demonstrate its value to pet owners.\n\nOverall, the discussion focused on the current state of the pet insurance market, Odie's differentiated approach, and opportunities for pet insurers to expand adoption by providing more value to pet owners through an ecosystem approach working with vets and pet health companies.\n\nIn this episode of Petworking, host Peter Kenseth interviews Greg Kean, Global VP of Innovation & Nutrition at Wellness Pet Company. They discuss Wellness's extensive testing protocols for its pet food products, which go above and beyond the industry standard.\n\nKey points from the discussion:\n\nWellness is investing 3-4 million dollars to put their entire product portfolio through AAFCO feeding trials, even though this is not required if diets meet AAFCO nutrient profiles.\n\nThis testing helps build confidence with veterinarians recommending Wellness products, as vets don't always receive extensive nutrition training.\n\nBefore even doing AAFCO trials, Wellness conducts digestibility, stool quality, and palatability testing, as well as urine pH for cat diets. Any novel diets or ingredients also undergo feeding trials.\n\nGreg discusses the need for more companion animal nutrition research overall, and how the industry is funding much of this itself in the absence of government funding.\n\nThey discuss trends around unprocessed/raw diets vs kibble, noting that more research is needed on health impacts. Kibble remains important for accessibility of pet ownership.\n\nWith a shrinking pet food market post-pandemic, innovation will focus on addressing consumer needs in affordable ways and educating on new food formats.\n\nThe future may bring more functional diets for health and longevity, but Greg emphasizes the importance of having sound research before making claims, while maintaining healthy body weight remains key.\n\nOverall, the discussion highlights Wellness's commitment to extensively testing its products to ensure optimal nutrition, as well as broader issues around advancing pet food science and innovation."
