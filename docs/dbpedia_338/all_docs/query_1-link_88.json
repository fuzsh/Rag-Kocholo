        "text": "Joel Sartore was ranked by our subscribers as one of the tippy-top presenters ever hosted at The Richmond Forum over our 38 years of programs. He was the perfect combination of fun, funny, informative, open, honest, serious and inspirational as well as incredibly accomplished in his work and presentation of it. Our world will benefit greatly with more people like Joel Sartore. I’m certain he is inspiring a whole generation of people who will act in more responsible ways of living on and sharing our planet with the beautiful diversity of life he shared with us.\n\nJoel struck a chord with 800 of our employees who were lucky enough to see his amazing presentation. His wit, passion and his insights on gathering different perspectives can provide value to all types of organizations. We loved Joel Sartore!\n\nYou’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll want to rise up in support of the species, great and small, that are threatened on our planet. Mr. Sartore’s photos, combined with stories of heartbreak and triumph, will stay with you long after the presentation is over.\n\nBuilding The Photo Ark\n\nGo behind the scenes with Joel as he travels the globe to photograph the world’s most toxic, outrageous, colorful, and beautiful animals. Things can go wrong—and they often do—but getting up close and personal is what it’s all about.\n\nLife as a National Geographic Photographer\n\nJoel shares a lively, intimate, and humorous look at what could be the best (and worst) job in the world as he plays expedition leader, psychologist, medic, accountant, and coach, not to mention photographer. It’s all just another day at the office when you’re on assignment for National Geographic.\n\nGrounded: A Reflection on Life and Land\n\nWhen his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, Joel knew that it was time to stay home for a while. In doing so, he reconnected not just with his family but also with why he takes photos in the first place."
