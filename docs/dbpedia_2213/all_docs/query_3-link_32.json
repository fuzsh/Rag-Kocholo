Specialists are trained primarily in anthropology and in music, but the multidisciplinary nature of the subject leads to different interpretations.\n\nFolk Music\n\nMusic that has been submitted to the process of oral transmission. Acoustic music performed by a solo act or a small ensemble, often written by the performer(s), rendered in very simple arrangements, and dealing with social or personal issues to which most lay persons can easily relate.\n\nWorld Music\n\nThis loosely defined term describes the local, folk, or roots music of a particular cultural group, society, or nation, oftentimes presented in conjunction with elements of religion, politics, and social customs. The term may refer to any music outside the western-art tradition."
