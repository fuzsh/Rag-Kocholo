        "text": "The concept of Africanity traverses many decades, being a socio-political ethos or cogitation perceived as manifest reaction against slavery and colonization. As a resistance mode, imbuement of the Africanity philosophy has shaped people of African descent in the Diaspora and many post-slavery generations all over the world in maintaining their African roots identity. This paper examines the concept of Africanity in the 21 st Century Africa, using the Nigerian popular music scene as a paradigm. Against the backdrop of the present mainstream Hip hop music style referred to as \" Afro hip hop \" , the study will use music and video analytical procedures with the objective of identifying the various media through which hip hop artistes project their Africanity. It is quite evident that music artistes still strive to maintain their African identity despite subscribing to a Western originated music style. This is made manifest through language use, nomenclature, message, visual projection, and sonic arrangement among other parameters.\n\nBeginning of the article: \"‘Popular culture’ is a broad term, especially if the meaning of ‘culture’ is understood as referring to “[…] whatever is distinctive about the ‘way of life’ of a people, community, nation or social group.” (Hall 1997: 2) However, for the purpose of this collection of articles, a useful distinction is between cultural practices such as drinking, eating, sports, fashion or religion and those forms of popular culture which are, in a more narrow sense, artistic cultural expressions, encompassing different genres such as music, theatre, dance, visual arts and literature. As Barber (1997: 1) points out, music is the first form of popular culture in Africa which has been (noticed and) studied outside the African continent. (cf. Fabian 1997 [1978]: 18) The still rather strong focus on music in the study of popular culture is also reflected in this special issue which is almost exclusively dedicated to this genre. 1 Popular culture has long been regarded as an unworthy subject of academic study (cf. Fabian 1997 [1978]: 18, Street 2001: 302, Marchart 2008: 11) – an attitude which was upheld perhaps even more strongly by academics in Africa as Wa Mungai (2008: 58) notes with reference to Kenya. This rejection was largely based on a perception of popular culture as “trash”, as an inferior kind of culture. (cf. Newell 2002: 3, cf. Hobsbawm 1995 [1994]: 514) Scholarly discussions of popular culture in Africa have for long revolved around the question of ‘authenticity’; especially with regard to popular music the introduction of musical elements from Western musical styles has often been viewed as a loss of it. (Kirkegaard 2002: 13) [...]\" Full reference: Englert, Birgit. 2008. Popular Music and Politics in Africa – Some Introductory Reflections. In: Stichproben. Vienna Journal of African Studies, Nr. 14, 1-15.\n\nSYNOPSIS This paper is based on the prologue for a new version of my Highlife Time that was originally a 51 chapter book on West African African highlife and related forms of music, published by Anansesem Press in Accra in 1994 and then 1996. [the 1996 version of Highlife Time is available on www.academia.edu]. A few years ago the publisher asked me to update and expand Highlife Time into a 65 chapter book which I completed in late 2013. Plans are now being made to publish the new edition book this year, 2017. However, already the new book is slightly out-of-date and there have been many new developments in the Ghanaian music scene. These include some developments touched on in the main text of the newest edition of Highlife Time, such as jama hiplife that, instead of using imported hiphop beats, utilises 'jama' rhythms, which is what the youth now call highlife and other local beats. Then there is the azonto club dance that is also based on jama beats, the rise of the 'Sahelian' or 'Savannah' sounds of northern Ghanaian music stars, electronic 'contemporary highlife' and R&B influenced Afropop. Even newer with the Ghanaian youth is Jamaican dancehall and its Afro-dancehall spinoff, and a Pan African club dance known as 'afrobeats' (nb. not Fela Kuti's Afrobeat) of which the Ghanaian azonto was an early example. I also talk of the way the century old 'Highlife Imagination' has crossed over to the new millennial generation and is influencing various forms of current Ghanaian music. In the text of this article I sometimes refer to chapter headings-which are the ones found in the yet unpublished 2017 version of Highlife Time. Nevertheless, readers may find this article of interest as it is based on the latest work I have done on the Ghanaian music scene. This paper is divided into three Sections SECTION ONE: Examines briefly some general recent trends in the Ghanaian musical scene and industry. SECTION TWO: Looks at 17 broad musical genres-both old and new-that I have identified as comprising the Ghanaian musical repertoire; and that I compare to 17 'musical pots' simmering on a large artistic stove. SECTION THREE: Discusses how the 'Highlife Imagination' has crossed into the new millennium, despite all the changing technologies, youth fashions and outside influences. Indeed, highlife music and its 'jama' beats now dominate most of Ghana's major popular music genres, such as hiplife, local gospel dance-music, azonto/afrobeats, Afro-dancehall and 'contemporary highlife'."
