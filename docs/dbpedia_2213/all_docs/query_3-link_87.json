        "text": "What to expect when visiting Geneva — your Geneva travel guide\n\nCentred at the point the River Rhône flows from Lake Geneva, Geneva is only nominally within Switzerland’s borders. It's squeezed into a bulge of land that shares just 4km of internal border with its neighbouring Swiss canton, but 108km with France.\n\nSmall it may be, but Geneva is one of the most demographically diverse cities in Europe — 39 percent of the resident population is non-Swiss.\n\nContributing to the fluid nature of the population are the thirty thousand French frontaliers who commute to Geneva from just over the border, benefiting from a high Swiss salary and relatively low French living expenses.\n\nGeneva is home to dozens of international organizations. Two of them — the United Nations’ European headquarters and the International Committee of the Red Cross — allow visitors a glimpse of the unseen lifeblood of the city. Namely, the diplomatic and administrative flair that has made Geneva world capital of bureaucracy.\n\nGeneva is also one of the reasons you voted Switzerland one of the most beautiful countries in the world. What's more, Geneva gets glowing mentions in our run-down of things to do in Switzerland this summer.\n\nFor more detail on the wider region, read our Lake Geneva travel guide.\n\nTop attractions and things to do in Geneva\n\n1. Cathédrale St-Pierre\n\nGeneva’s Calvinist heritage is laid bare in the stark interior of this historic church. The Cathédrale St-Pierre is a mishmash of architectural elements, from twelfth century Gothic to a Neoclassical portico that’s more reminiscent of a museum than a church.\n\nBe sure to spend time in the delightful Chapelle des Macchabées. Added in 1397, it's last on the left before you leave.\n\n2. Jet d’Eau\n\nThe origins of Geneva's iconic lakeside fountain lie in an attempt to solve a problem with the city’s water-pumping system.\n\nBy the time the reservoir was in operation and the fountain had become unnecessary, a few wily Genevois had caught onto its power as a tourist attraction. As such, it's a must-see during your Geneva vacation.\n\nToday it spurts a single jet of water an incredible 140m into the air, with 500 litres of water forced out of the nozzle every second at about 200kph.\n\n3. Carouge\n\nArtists' workshops and Italianate architecture lend a Mediterranean ambience to this lively suburb. In 1754 the King of Sardinia envisioned Carouge as a trading competitor to Geneva and turned it into a refuge for Catholics, Protestant, and Jews.\n\nToday Carouge is still something of a refuge from the city. Its quiet, attractive streets are packed with artists’ workshops and old-style cafés, making it a highlight of any Geneva travel experience.\n\n4. Les Pâquis\n\nEngaging street life abounds in the multi-ethnic district of Les Pâquis that spreads east of Rue du Mont-Blanc.\n\nThis cosmopolitan area is centred on the long Rue de Berne, and crammed with restaurants and cafés devoted to every conceivable cuisine, from Senegalese to Filipino.\n\n5. Musée de la Croix-Rouge\n\nHoused within the headquarters of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Musée International de la Croix-Rouge chronicles the history of modern conflict.\n\nThe museum-with-a-conscience also features interactive displays revealing the role the Red Cross has played in providing aid to combatants and civilians caught up in war and natural disasters.\n\n6. UN tour\n\nTours of the UN building are packed with star quality for those who want to hobnob with history. This is the world’s single largest conference centre for top-level international politicking — when the news reports on “negotiations in Geneva”, they mean here.\n\nTo learn more, take an expert-guided United Nations tour of Geneva.\n\nRough Guides tip: To increase your chances of a great holiday, read how many days you need to spend in Switzerland.\n\n7. CERN\n\nCERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, was established in 1954 as an international physics research centre. In 1989, CERN was the birthplace of the World Wide Web.\n\nToday scientifically curious visitors head to the site to gain insights to a place where 2500 scientists seek answers to fundamental questions about the universe.\n\nTo see a host of the city's modern and old world attractions, book a guided tour of Geneva's international quarters and Old Town, or combine a city tour with a boat cruise.\n\nTravelling with kids? A self-guided scavenger hunt and city tour might just keep the whole family entertained.\n\nWhich areas should you visit in Geneva?\n\nGenevois orient the city centre around the Rhône, which flows west into France from the Rade. The narrow lake harbour is flanked by grand facades.\n\nThe Rive Gauche, on the south bank, takes in a grid of waterfront streets which comprise the main shopping district (Les Rues-Basses) and the adjacent high ground of the Old Town. Just south is the university, spilling over into Plainpalais.\n\nBeyond this is lively Carouge, characterized by artisans’ workshops.\n\nSix bridges, including the main Pont du Mont-Blanc, link the Rive Gauche to the Rive Droite waterfront, where most of Geneva’s grand hotels sit.\n\nBehind them lies the Gare de Cornavin, the main train station, alongside the cosmopolitan and occasionally rough Les Pâquis district.\n\nThe international area, 1.5km north and centred on Place des Nations, is home to the European headquarters of the UN, set amid a clutch of world bodies – not least the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nBest places to stay in Geneva\n\nAt first sight, Geneva’s accommodation scene can appear to consist solely of grandiose palace hotels catering to diplomats and the international glitterati.\n\nThat said, more affordable accommodation is available if you know where to look, though booking ahead is essential, since all affordable rooms can easily get snapped up by delegates to the continuous round of conferences and international events.\n\nVacant rooms in Geneva’s two hostels are likewise at a premium, though thankfully both are comparatively large, sleeping hundreds of people between them.\n\nCologny\n\nLocated 6km northeast of the Geneva, Cologny has long been known as an exclusive suburb. With country lanes weaving between woods, and large detached houses set back behind walls, the contrast with Geneva is striking.\n\nIt's easy to see why the tourist office has dubbed Cologny the “Beverly Hills of Geneva”.\n\nCanoeing and rafting trips\n\nRafting Genève runs canoeing, rafting and kayaking trips daily on the Arve’s 8km of rapids, as well as whitewater trips on the Dranse and elsewhere.\n\nYou can also rent canoes and kayaks and make tandem paragliding jumps off Mont Salève.\n\nIf you're into exhilerating activities, read up on the best outdoor experiences in Switzerland.\n\nIntrepid female travellers might also want to explore women only outdoor activities in Switzerland — all created by and for women.\n\nWhatever kind of trip you're looking for, The Rough Guide to Switzerland and our run-down of things not to miss in Switzerland will help you plan — think of them as your personal travel guide to Switzerland.\n\nNot a fan of planning? You could book a hassle-free tailor-made trip to Switzerland, with customisable itineraries curated by local experts covering everything from unforgettable highlights of Switzerland, to touring the Grand Circle.\n\nWe may earn commission when you click on links in this article, but this doesn’t influence our editorial standards.
