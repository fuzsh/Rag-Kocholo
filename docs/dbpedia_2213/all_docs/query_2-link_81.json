Although the journal is not specifically ethnomusicological, the topics and papers lend themselves quite well to the values of social justice and advocacy that are present in a number of EM studies. Each volume also includes a review for recent albums and/or texts on music and politics. - Stadnicki\n\nMUSICultures This is the bilingual (FR/ENG) academic journal for The Canadian Society for Traditional Music through York University.

Each issue covers a specific topic, from Sacred Music in Latin America to Children’s Music and Musical Instruments. Interestingly, these journals are written entirely in English, despite being published in Berlin. JSTOR unfortunately does not offer all of its issues – the latest one being from 2011 – however, the journal’s website does indicate that it is a new series. This journal is particularly noteworthy as it began in 1957. - Julia\n\nEthnomusicology Forum (http://www.bfe.org.uk/ethnomusicology-forum) In association with Routledge, the British Forum for Ethnomusicology has published this journal three times per year since 2011. “Ethnomusicology Forum” was originally the British Journal of Ethnomusicology. The goal of the journal is to provide an opportunity for the presentation of both new and critical thinking in the field of ethnomusicology. - Julia\n\nMusic and Korea This is a journal of the Society for Korean Music. Actually, this society does not limit their scholarly area on only Korean traditional music. It deals with a wide arrange of musical phenomenon, events in Korea. In modern EM, however, Ethnomusic does not mean only ethnic, exotic, and non-Western music but local current music as well. Moreover, the official title in English is Music and Korea, but its direct translation is Music and (Korean) Nationality. For this reason, this journal can be one of EM. This journal can be found through this link. (http://www.musickorea.org/html/sub03_04.asp)\n\nJournals including EM and WM\n\n(musicology, etc.)\n\nAppalachian Journal This interdisciplinary journal is published by Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina and features sutdies of the mountain region's musical culture very prominently amongst those in a variety of other topics, including folklore, history, politics, and ecology.

Oral History can be accessed through the jstor database. - Dana\n\nAfrican Studies (1942-present) The journal, originally named Bantu Studies (1921-41), is an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed journal that focuses on a variety of topics related to social issues relevant to Africa. While the journal’s priority seems more directed to political issues, from an ethnomusicological standpoint, it proves beneficial in showing how literature, dance, music and art integrate into these political questions. What I liked particularly about the journal was the global collaboration that built up its “identity” as a scholarly resource. The editorial board is comprised of academics from around the world; however, the collaboration at its place of publication, South Africa at the University of Witwatersrand, is what recognizes that these are not merely studies on African topics, but African perspectives on topics. The journal contains over 300 articles focusing directly on music. - Nick\n\nOpera Quarterly (1983-present) The articles published by this journal may place strong emphasis on the art music European opera, but there are many other areas of focus. In the past I have found this journal particularly useful in research Chinese opera. Since the journal’s inception there have been over 3000 articles published on the subject, those discussing the art form itself, while others discuss social issues surrounding the subject. The journal’s online access is regularly monitored with an archive that is excellent for navigating searches. - Nick\n\nLatin American Music Review, This online and printed journal explores many areas including historical, ethnographic, and socio-cultural subjects.

Our library has Focus on Music of South Africa, by Carol Muller, in its holdings (ML 3760 M85 2008), but it appears that Focus on Gamelan Music of Indonesia has also recently been published. It might be interesting to see what additional titles are forthcoming, but no information on that is readily accessible at Taylor & Francis’ website so far. - Laryssa\n\nAfrican American Music in Global Perspective (University of Illinois Press) Edited by Laurie Matheson, Portia K. Maultsby, and Mellonee V. Burnim, this new monograph series (2007-2011) focuses on underrepresented topics and issues in black music studies.

Featuring nineteen books in total (so far), the entirety of the series is available at the university library. - Dana\n\nRoutledge Studies in Ethnomusicology Routledge's recent series features both monographs and edited collections.

Interesting sidebar: Apparently, according to the library database, this text is approved for use in Alberta school curriculum, but a look at the fairly theoretical introductory chapter makes me wonder if it’s been used in that context???
