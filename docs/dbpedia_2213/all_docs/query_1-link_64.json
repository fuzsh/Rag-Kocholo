        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Rough Guide to Essential Blues CDs celebrates the first century of the blues by selecting a hundred of the finest blues CDs currently available. Some are little-known historical documents, others have sold in their millions; together, they tell a fascinating story of the music’s development, but all are included, first and foremost, because they make fabulous listening.\n\nAs folk wisdom almost has it, writing about the blues is like whistling about chickens. Even defining the blues is all but impossible. No one knows where it came from; it just seemed to emerge fully fledged, a hundred years ago, among black Americans of the so-called Deep South. While elements of the music can be traced back to West Africa, bottleneck guitar seems to have originated in Hawaii, and many early 'blues' songs were actually written for the vaudeville stage. Nonetheless, the blues has remained strongly identified with the South; almost all of the artists included here were born somewhere between East Texas and Georgia, even if they eventually found fame in the cities of the North.\n\nThe best-known version of blues history concentrates on the pre-World War II 'Delta blues' of Mississippi, as played on acoustic instruments by artists like Son House and Robert Johnson. This was adapted from the late 1940s onwards by Mississippian migrants to Chicago, notably Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, to create the urban blues. That majestic tradition forms the core of this book, but newcomers to the music will find much more besides, including the lighter, more technically accomplished guitar-picking styles of Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nIn the early days, record companies used the label \"blues\" as a catch-all description for a very broad spectrum of black popular music, but in the last fifty years the definition has narrowed as the blues has proved to be the bedrock from which genres such as rock’n’roll, R&B, soul and even rock have split away. I have, therefore excluded those artists – such as Little Richard, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Jimi Hendrix – who started in the blues but moved on before producing their greatest work.\n\nThanks to still-creative veterans like John Lee Hooker and R.L. Burnside, as well as newcomers like Corey Harris and Alvin Hart, the blues is maintaining its capacity to delight and surprise now that it has entered the twenty-first century. Inevitably, however, there’s an emphasis here on the seminal recordings of the 1920s and 1930s. Devotees of more recent artists may spot what they regard as glaring omissions; deciding how to make room for them is a much harder task, and I still regret having to restrict such major figures as Howlin’ Wolf to just one album."
