        "text": "Nashville, Tennessee's capital city, is located in the north central part of the state on the Cumberland River. Founded in 1779 and named for Francis Nash, a Continental Army General during the American Revolutionary War, Nashville is the most populous city in Tennessee and one of the nation's fastest growing economies.\n\nCalled \"Music City,\" Nashville is home to the Grand Ole Opry, known for country music performances and legends like Johnny Cash, Reba McIntire, Loretta Lynn, Minnie Pearl, Vince Gill and others who have graced the stage there. The Ryman Auditorium has also seen stars like Dolly Parton and Hank Williams, and now hosts shows of all genres. Bars, restaurants, and performance venues offer live music every day of the week, and it's not just country music. Bluegrass, rock, pop, and a wide range of styles can be heard throughout the city.\n\nAnother nickname for Nashville is \"Athens of the South\" for its many institutions of higher learning, including Vanderbilt University, Tennessee State University, and Belmont. The Parthenon in Centennial Park, a full-scale replica of the original in Athens, is a reminder of the city's reputation. It was built in 1897 for the state's Centennial Exposition.\n\nTime Zone\n\nNashville is in the Central Time Zone, though the state of Tennessee is divided into Eastern Time Zone and Central Time Zone. (Daylight Savings Time is observed seasonally.)\n\nBest Time to Go\n\nSpring (April, May) and Autumn (September, October) are good times to visit Nashville because the weather is generally comfortable. The summer months of July and August are quite warm and humid, and winter is often cold and rainy. If weather is not an issue, it may be more economical to visit during winter months when there are fewer tourists.\n\nFestivals like the springtime Cherry Blossom Festival, Fashion Week, CMA Fest, Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, Pride Festival, Nashville Film Festival, or Germantown's Oktoberfest attract visitors based on their interest in the event rather than the time of year.\n\nThings to Know\n\nThe elegant Schermerhorn Symphony Center, located downtown across from the Country Music Hall of Fame is the place to hear classical, jazz, world music, and Broadway.\n\nNashville is the home of Hot Chicken, and Prince's Hot Chicken is considered the original. Choose your heat level from Plain to XXX Hot, but be aware that they really mean XXX HOT!\n\nThe AT&T Building is nicknamed the Batman Building because its two towers make it resemble Batman's pointed ears.\n\nNashville was the first Southern city to desegregate public establishments after a series of downtown sit-ins by African-American college students in 1960.\n\nElvis Presley recorded more than 200 of his songs on Music Row at RCA's Studio B. (The year-round Christmas lights there commemorate his recording of his Christmas album when they were put up in July, along with a Christmas tree, to inspire the holiday mood.)\n\nTennessee is called \"The Volunteer State.\" Volunteer soldiers from Tennessee played a large role in the War of 1812, especially during the Battle of New Orleans. Later in the Mexican-American War of 1846, Tennessee sent 30,000 soldiers for the effort.\n\nNashville is home to the National Football League Titans, the National Hockey League Predators, and Major League Soccer team the Nashville Soccer Club. The city also has a minor league baseball team, the Sounds.\n\nA Nashville hotel led to the name of Maxwell House coffee. Their popular brew was given the hotel's name, and, during a 1907 stay, President Theodore Roosevelt supposedly said, \"Good to the last drop,\" creating the brand's familiar slogan.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nNashville's main public transit system, WeGo Public Transit, has purple buses covering more than 50 routes throughout the city. Plan ahead of time using the service's convenient trip planner as a guide. WeGo offers an bus service to and from the Nashville Airport (BNA). It also offers a park and ride service with free parking at designated locations\n\nThe Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) operates ten bus routes between Nashville and several other cities as well as linking riders with the WeGo system. In addition, RTA oversees the Music City Star regional rail line.\n\nTaxis, Uber, and Lyft all operate in Nashville.\n\nBest Hotels\n\nDowntown\n\nBobby Hotel\n\nAddress: 230 Fourth Avenue North\n\nPhone: (615) 782-7100\n\nBook Now\n\nThis creative hotel in historic Printers Alley offers luxury, fun, and a variety of rooms, including one and two-bedroom suites.
