        "text": "Hilton Head's 12 miles of beaches and slow pace of life have drawn families and travelers for decades. Two dozen golf courses weave through the island's 25,000 acres, including the internationally renowned Harbour Town Golf Links. Balmy, breezy weather makes it a haven for world-class tennis and excellent inshore fishing, while an island-wide network of paved trails makes it possible to travel the island from end to end via bicycle.\n\nBefore 1956, when the first bridge opened, Hilton Head was a sleepy Southern island. It takes its name from Captain William Hilton, who claimed it for the British crown in 1663. Hundreds of enslaved people toiled on the island's cotton and rice plantations before Union soldiers liberated them in 1861, leading to a century of Gullah-Geechee culture. In the 1960s, the island saw the rapid expansion of tourist infrastructure.\n\nToday, Hilton Head's rich cultural and natural history is evident in a tray of oysters at Hudson's Seafood House on the Docks, or in the sweetgrass baskets on display at the Coastal Discovery Museum. New influences, like chef Philippe Feret of Hilton Head Social Bakery, lend the island a worldly flair, while old-school hangouts, like the Lowcountry Backyard, keep it anchored in tradition.\n\nHilton Head is a place to relax, challenge yourself at a world-class golf course, and then relax some more. The island invites long family bike rides, or lazy days wandering back and forth between the beach and an oceanfront pool. Most of all, it's a place to slow down and enjoy the Lowcountry lifestyle.\n\nTime Zone\n\nEastern Standard Time\n\nBest Time to Go\n\nHilton Head comes alive during summer, when families descend from the Midwest and across the East Coast for a week of R&R. Shoulder season — April to May (with the exception of the RBC Heritage golf tournament) and September to October (unless there's a hurricane circling offshore) — shows off the island at its best, with moderate temperatures in the 80s, warm water in the ocean, and fewer crowds at restaurants and popular attractions. During winter, the pace slows dramatically, and it's possible to walk for miles on mostly deserted beaches.\n\nThings to Know\n\nHilton Head seems like a small island, but driving from one end to the other can easily take a half-hour during peak season. You're here to relax, so choose your accommodations based on the part of the island you want to spend the most time on. The Sea Pines Resort dominates the southern half, and offers enough beaches, shops, restaurants, and attractions so you never have to leave. But beaches on the island's north end, including near hotels like The Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa, don't get as crowded on busy summer weekends as others closer to the island's middle. Finally, golfers should book tee times well in advance — this is one of the world's premier golfing destinations, so you'll need reservations and a timely arrival.\n\nCurrency: U.S. Dollar\n\nLanguage: English\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nUnless you plan to stay put at a single resort for the duration of your trip, a car is a necessity on Hilton Head. Uber and Lyft both service the island and are readily available.\n\nFor guests staying within the 4,500-acre Sea Pines Resort, a free trolley shuttles you from Harbour Town to South Beach Marina Village and the beach.\n\nVisitors wanting to explore nearby Daufuskie Island or downtown Savannah can hop aboard the Spirit of Harbour Town with Vagabond Cruise, enjoying a ride down the river and four hours to explore the island or the city.\n\nBest Hotels\n\n01 of 31\n\nBeach House, a Holiday Inn Resort\n\nAddress: 1 South Forest Beach Dr., Hilton Head, SC 2992\n\nPhone: (855) 474-2882\n\nBook Now\n\nThis resort's centerpiece, the rollicking Tiki Hut beachfront bar, hosts one of the island's biggest parties every afternoon.

But even though there's a dedicated beach clubhouse (and additional pool) for resort guests — accessible via shuttle or bike path — the distance from the ocean makes it best for guests who plan on spending most of their time at the pool, playing golf, or at other nearby attractions.\n\n03 of 31\n\nThe Inn & Club at Harbour Town\n\nAddress: 7 Lighthouse Ln., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 363-8100\n\nBook Now\n\nRooms at this elegant inn overlook the first tee at the famous Harbour Town Golf Links, making it the perfect place to stay if you're playing a round.

Get pampered at the Arum Spa, or simply kick back in a poolside cabana for the afternoon. Generously sized rooms boast at least 450 square feet, but are set back from the beach, allowing the attractive grounds to take center stage.\n\n07 of 31\n\nThe Westin Hilton Head Island Resort & Spa\n\nAddress: 2 Grasslawn Ave., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 681-4000\n\nBook Now\n\nThis resort's commanding beachfront presence is mirrored by soaring ceilings in indoor communal spaces and comfortable balconies overlooking the ocean and pool complex.

Chef and owner Philippe Feret, a native of Normandy, France, once helmed the kitchen at New York's Tavern on the Green. Today, he enjoys a slower pace of life, delighting patrons with homemade quiche and fougasse (stuffed baguettes). The bakery's location in Shelter Cove includes attractive outdoor seating along the waterfront.\n\n09 of 31\n\nHudson's Seafood House on the Docks\n\nAddress: 1 Hudson Rd., Hilton Head SC 29926\n\nPhone: (843) 681-2772\n\nDating back to 1967, Hudson's may be an institution, but it doesn't rely on tourists to keep business bustling. The forward-thinking restaurant doubles as an aquaculture operation, growing its own oysters and allowing the kitchen to source 90% of its seafood from the waters around Hilton Head. The laid-back vibe extends through the winding dining rooms and expansive outdoor porch. First come, first served.\n\n10 of 31\n\nLinks, an American Grill\n\nAddress: 11 Lighthouse Ln., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 363-8380\n\nSurf and turf are the primary offerings at this elegant dining room located directly on the Harbour Town Golf Links, but the smartest orders are the specials from chef RJ Dye, a veteran of Fig and The Ordinary in Charleston.

Outdoor seating is available, and reservations are recommended for dinner.\n\n11 of 31\n\nA Lowcountry Backyard Restaurant\n\nAddress: 32 Palmetto Bay Rd., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 785-9273\n\nThis laid-back outdoor joint is perfect for families and those looking for authentic local flavors.

The wine list, cocktail program (including several on draft), and weekend brunch each deserve high praise. Reservations are not required, and indoor and patio seating are available.\n\n13 of 31\n\nOmbra Cucina Italiana\n\nAddress: 1000 William Hilton Pkwy., #G2, Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 842-5505\n\nThe traditional menu at this restaurant includes classic antipasti like carpaccio (thinly sliced beef) and mussels sauteed in white wine.

Grab a cold beer and a seat inside or on the porch to dig in, or kick back at the bar to watch a game. There's a late-night menu and a hopping bar scene on weekends, plus a second location in Bluffton. No reservations.\n\n15 of 31\n\nSanta Fe Cafe\n\nAddress: 807 William Hilton Pkwy., #700, Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (843) 785-3838\n\nThe chimichangas are rightfully called \"outrageous\" at this hopping spot serving generously sized fajitas, burritos, and seafood entrees, including blackened local redfish.

Each April, the course hosts the RBC Heritage PGA golf tournament, bringing major stars — and big crowds — to the island.\n\n20 of 31\n\nHarbour Town Lighthouse Museum\n\nAddress: 149 Lighthouse Rd., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nPhone: (866) 305-9814\n\nThe candy-cane-striped lighthouse is the island's most iconic landmark, presiding over Harbour Town and the 18th hole of the Harbour Town Golf Links course.

During the summer, seeing alligators basking in the sun is almost a guarantee from the boardwalks overlooking the lake.\n\n24 of 31\n\nStoney-Baynard Ruins\n\nAddress: Plantation Dr., Hilton Head, SC 29928\n\nTucked away in the middle of a neighborhood within The Sea Pines Resort, this 18th-century home is one of the best remaining examples of \"oyster shell tabby\" architecture.
