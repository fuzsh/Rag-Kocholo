        "text": "Music has the power to transport us, change our moods, and conjure memories. And, for many travelers, music is closely linked to travel. It can helps us understand the people and culture of a place, break down language barriers, and sear certain moments into our memories forever.\n\nWith help from members of our Travel Community and Going staff, we've created the ultimate travel playlist of 100 travel songs. Some reference specific places, others showcase the musical talent of a specific country, and others simply celebrate the joy of exploration.\n\nHere, in no particular order, are 100 of our favorite travel songs.\n\n56 songs that reference specific places in the title or lyrics\n\nSure, some of these songs, such Paris by the Chainsmokers or Toto’s Africa, actually have little to do with the specific place; it’s just used as the title or the setting for the story. But others not only reference a country or city, they also evoke a specific sense of that particular place or tell a story about that destination.\n\nFor example, in Marrakech Express, Crosby, Stills & Nash recount scenes from a train ride Nash actually took in 1966. In London Calling, the Clash sing about the social issues facing London in the late 70s. In Walking in Memphis, Marc Cohn croons about his experience wandering the city. And Simon & Garfunkel's America was inspired by a road trip that Paul Simon took with his girlfriend.\n\nHere are some of our favorite songs that mention a specific city or country, and a snippet of the lyrics.\n\nListen when: you're on a $388 flight to Vienna, or a $671 flight to Johannesburg, or a $353 flight to Paris, or...\n\n1.

One Night in Bangkok – Murray Head\n\nOne night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster\n\nThe bars are temples but the pearls ain't free\n\nYou'll find a god in every golden cloister\n\nA little flesh, a little history\n\nI can feel an angel sliding up to me\n\n‍\n\n3.

Africa – Toto\n\nThe wild dogs cry out in the night\n\nAs they grow restless, longing for some solitary company\n\nI know that I must do what's right\n\nAs sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti\n\nI seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become\n\nIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you\n\nThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do\n\nI bless the rains down in Africa\n\nGonna take some time to do the things we never have\n\nBonus: Check out the 2018 cover by Weezer and this awesome 2016 video from Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard.\n\n5.
