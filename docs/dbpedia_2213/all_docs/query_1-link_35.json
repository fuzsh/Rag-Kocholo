        "text": "Founded in 1994 by husband and wife team Phil Stanton and Colombian-born Sandra Alayón-Stanton, World Music Network consists of four record labels – Music Rough Guides, Riverboat Records, Introducing and Think Global. Music Rough Guides releases the Rough Guides CD compilations.\n\nMusic Rough Guides has been releasing the Rough Guide music series in association with the Rough Guides travel book publishers since 1994, when the first world music book and album in that series were released. Since then Music Rough Guides have covered destinations as diverse as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Japan, and Hungary. They have also covered musical styles such as merengue music, klezmer, salsa and Bollywood.\n\n(Read more at Wikipedia.)\n\n[]\n\nJohn Peel played numerous various artist (v/a) compilations put out in the Rough Guides series on his radio shows from the late 1990s until his final programmes in 2004, reflecting his continuing interest in world music, despite misgivings about the term, as well as other \"roots\" and traditional forms. Albums given airtime included one on the music of Haiti[1] that was compiled by his friend and colleague Andy Kershaw, who also featured the series extensively on his own programmes.[2]\n\nThe wide range of collections played most heavily by JP included Rough Guides to Hawaii, African Rap, Congolese Soukous, and Merengue & Bachata. The latter two were also included in his Peel's Record Box monthly selections for the BBC website.[3] [4]\n\nWhile the vast majority of Rough Guide releases focused on a single country or musical style, Peel also played one track from a single-artist collection in the series, \"Absa Gueye\" by Youssou N'Dour, on 28 August 2002.[5]\n\nPlays[]\n\n(The following list of JP radio plays of Rough Guide v/a compilations is chronological, by date of first known play of the release.
