        "text": "MAHLATHINI AND THE MAHOTELLA QUEENS\n\nMbaqanga\n\n(Verve World)\n\nThey are the grandmothers and grandfather of mbaqanga, the township jive mix of rhythm and blues with Zulu folk. Their recordings from the sixties and seventies were coveted by collectors, and when the craze took hold in the eighties, they were headliners. The problem is, they are more and more an imitation of themselves. The production is slicker, the look more and more out of step with reality. Myself and a number of others in the audience at Town Hall in NYC last year felt like anachronistic throwbacks watching \"the Zulu show\" instead of active participants in a vital new music. In recordings and live appearances, the group is more and more treated like icons rather than musicians. As originators of the style, they can hardly be accused of \"revivalism\" but what little change there has been in their music has been cosmetic, marketing ploys rather than integral changes. The live shows are more often in formal concert settings than in a place where you are encouraged to do what the music makes you want to do: dance. (Try dancing in the aisles at Town Hall!) The good news is, this new album goes back to the rootsy sound of their early career. No attempts were made to make disco-pop with the likes of Art Of Noise, the synthesizers and cute production tricks are way in the background. I just wish that a band with the talent of Makhona Tshole, and singers capable of the elation and energy of Mahlathini and The Queens, would push a little harder and take some serious risks.\n\nLOKETO Extra Ball\n\n\"The history of Zairean music begins with the formation of 'Lingala.' This came about when the Belgians wanted to build the railroad. The people they recruited came from everywhere and spoke many languages. A common language was needed - Lingala... It was the wives of the railroad workers who helped develop Zairean music. They used to get together and play \"kebo,\" without instruments, but with handclapping... Now my style is always changing in time with the technical changes..., and the public's taste. It is important to play African music but to use the best techniques possible in order to convince the public.\" (-Tabu Ley, in a 1985 interview with Ronnie Graham, from his \"Guide To Contemporary African Music\" DeCapo Press, NY 1988)...\n\nNo other music from Africa has more \"convinced the public\" around the world than the soukous of Congo and Zaire. And if there is a name on the scene that's better known than Diblo, I can't think of it. His guitar playing has become legend, his style imitated and envied all over Paris and Kinshasa. Together with singers Aurlus Mabele and Jean Baron, he has brought the band Loketo into the popular forefront. Based on a solid commitment to musicianship over techno-wizardry, Loketo plays hard rhythms and sparse melody. On their latest, Extra Ball (a pinball reference) they carry on. While most of the album is dependably soukous, there are some small but notable change ups towards the end. \"Mondo Ry\" features a spacious, fuzzy guitar solo that clearly counters the bell-like sound you've come to expect. \"Tcheke Linha\" offers a traditional Baluba rhythm structure, with a different backbeat and bite. While there are few surprises in, there are no let downs. Loketo continues to avoid tilting and keeps winning and Extra Ball.\n\nLES TETES BRULEES\n\nHot Heads\n\nShanachie\n\nForget all the hype you have heard about this band being \"the punk sensation of Africa.\" They are neither Africa's speed metal demons nor are they screaming anti-establishment types. The punk moniker comes from their wild makeup and dress, not their music. And their outfits are of minor consequence. (Besides, who stole from whom? Africa has had the world \"out-punked\" for a century when it comes to headgear and makeup.) What Les Tetes Brulees are is clean, tight, unadorned bikutsi, a traditional Cameroonian style that no one had heard of a year ago, but that every writer in the world speaks of with old familiarity now that this band has hit the touring circuit. It's a speedy style of soukous or zouk, replacing Zaire's slow sensuality with their own brand of hyper sexuality. You'll find traces of soca, soul and 60s acid, especially in the powerful guitar playing. If there is a connection with 80s punk, it is in their rejection of technological trappings. This music is straight forward, electric guitar and drum stuff, no fluff, no filler. Must I pick a cut? \"Papa.\" This is swirling madness, a non-stop barrage of guitars and voices, fat bottomed bass and complex drum patterns. But there's not a loser in the lot on Hot Heads. This crew gives new meaning to the phrase \"strike up the band.\"\n\nALI HASSAN KUBAN From Nubia To Cairo\n\n(Shanachie)\n\nGather together equal measures of Sudan's Abdel Aziz el Mubarek, The Musicians of The Nile and the Farfisa whine of Cheb Khaled or the Archies and you get a rough idea of what's in store on this journey From Nubia To Cairo. This is wonderful music; bright, spirited and exotic. North Africa's mix of cultures has made it one of the truly international cultures, crossed by Turks, Romans, Arabs, Christians and the omnipresent Euro-American radio and cassettes. The combination has yielded much fruit, including the currently famous rai music of Algeria and Paris. But this is something else again. Ali Hassan Kuban successfully bridges both sides of the musical Nile, wading into traditional music one moment, then diving head first into the crosscurrents of modern pop. Horns, keyboards, drums and accordion are the primary colors. Ouds, African percussion and voice are the local color. Unlike the more incessant push of rai, this music has a romantic pull to it. It is more resistant to the cliche and the simplified dance groove. There are subtle similarities to the Congolese rhumba, sharing the same insinuations if not the same melodies or rhythms. Irresistible cuts would have to include sinewy \"Yah Nasma Yah Halina\" and \"Sukkar, Sukkar, Sukkar\" which shares with the Archies not only the organ sound, but lyrics that make a good argument for not reading the translations. This is an album by a unique artist with a sound like no one else. Take the your listeners on the trip.\n\nKANDA BONGO MAN Zing Zong\n\n(Hannibal)\n\nWhile I think that soukous as an \"established\" style is going through some bad times, stagnating in its own popularity and overblown sense of fashion, there are still the pleasant surprises here and there. Kanda Bongo Man is one of them. His relaxed and bright delivery is a relief from the self important tedium of many of the big stars. Driven along by the lead guitars of Dally and this year's new string wonder Nene Tchakou, his music is still fresh and bouncy, never straying far from well worn grooves, but never getting caught in the ruts either. If there is an award for charm out there, here is the man to give it too. Even on record it comes through, a confidence that never turns to ego, and a voice that never turns to clay. Good cuts to stir up a current on a hot summer day: \"Zing Zong,\" a tribute to the late brothers Soki, former band mates; the inspirational \"Yesu Christu\" (another trend to watch out for!); and \"Mosali,\" with a great bass line and a smooth rhumba and horn line up. Why does this succeed where others have failed? Maybe it's the fact that there's not a sample in sight, and nary an electro-beat to be heard. Maybe its the naturalness of Kanda's delivery. It's that small certain something that makes the difference between a competent performance and an special one. Some folks have it; some folks don't. Kanda Bongo Man definitely HAS it. Enjoy!"
