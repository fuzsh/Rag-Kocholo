Classical crossover hitmaker Katherine Jenkins really has cause for Celebration today as her new album reaches the Top 10 in the pop charts.

The record, called Celebration has also scored Jenkins her twelfth Classical No.1 album in 12 years – making her the most successful artist in UK classical chart history.

Celebration entered the Official UK Albums Chart at number seven, ahead of Justin Bieber and Jess Glynne, and just behind Beyonce, Prince, Adele and Sia. To mark her chart success, Katherine Jenkins will be enjoying a well-earned slice of cake.

The good news comes for the 35-year-old singer after she announced that she'd be returning to Wales for a special Christmas concert, at Swansea's Brangwyn Hall.

Katherine’s patriotic album is a joyous collection of the greatest music from the United Kingdom, combining seven new songs with 13 favourites selected by Katherine from her hit recordings.

It includes such beloved tunes as Rule Britannia, Jerusalem, I Vow To Thee My Country, Ae Fond Kiss, Land Of My Fathers, and also a full rendition of God Save the Queen in its rarely-heard, three-verse form.

The album is also Katherine’s first since having a baby, and opens with the poignant song This Mother’s Heart.

Katherine will be performing, by request, at the Queen’s birthday celebrations at Windsor Castle in May, and will be giving her own celebratory concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall and Hampton Court Palace in June.
