        "text": "WACKERS, The\n\nRandy Bishop (guitar, vocals) / Bob Segarini (guitar, vocals) / William “Kootch” Trochim (bass, guitar) / Ernie Earnsaw (drums) / Mike Stull (guitar, bass) / J.P. Lauzon (guitar) / Jerry Mercer (drums; temporary 1973) / Norman Vosko (bass; replaced Trochim) / Wayne Cullen (drums)\n\nIn 1971 Bob Segarini and Randy Bishop were on the way up with their California dream band, The Wackers, living a post-Beatle existence criss-crossing North American clubs in an attempt to capture the rock and roll brass ring. Elektra Records had already given them a one-album shot under the name Roxy and so label president Jac Holzman found their newly configured glam pop act an antidote to the pretense of label mates The Doors. As a tightly knit five-piece – which included Segarini’s former Family Tree band mate Bill “Kootch” Trochim (bass, guitar), Ernie Earnshaw (drums) and Mike Stull (guitar, bass) – The Wackers entered musical stage right with the Gary Usher produced ‘Wackering Heights’ in 1971. And on subsequent trips to Montréal –where they eventually decided to permanently stay – they recorded ‘Hot Wacks’ which was released in 1972. Mike Stull soon left and J.P. Lauzon joined the band in the summer of 1973.The Wackers’ future was up in the air and they returned to California to figure out their next move. While there, Bishop, Trochim, and Segarini were fooling around in Wally Heider’s San Francisco Studio and started to record an album as The Duck Brothers (as in Huey, Dewey, and Louie). Their label, Elektra, caught wind of the project and sent the band back to Montréal with producer Mark Abramson, (Judy Collins) to start a proper follow-up Wackers release. While Earnshaw continued his vacation in California, The Wackers begin recording ‘Shredder’ with Jerry Mercer on drums. Earnshaw returned near the end of recording and managed to appear on the song “Tonight” – breaking his wrist shortly after. The album gave the Wackers their only legitimate hit single in Canada with the tune “Day and Night” while the song charted in Cashbox Magazine in the US and peaked at No.79 the week of December 16, 1972. They decided not to leave Montréal and became the defacto house band at legendary club ‘The Mustache’ as foreign dignitaries. It allowed them to hold musical court. Meanwhile, they attempted a live recording at the Westport Country Playhouse in the spring of 1973 with songs from the performance being bootlegged for years after. But, eventually, Elektra rejected the demos for the band’s fourth album – ‘Wack N’ Roll’ – and because they had failed to crack Top40 radio stateside, they no longer had the backing of their musical power brokers. The last show as the original The Wackers was in Ottawa, Ontario in September 1973. Bishop went solo and by 1974, Kootch and Segarini were keeping the fire burning with a new single on Polydor featuring bassist Norman Vosko. By 1975, The Wackers was officially over. Segarini and Trochim next put together The Dudes with the founding members of April Wine (Ritchie and David Henman) and future April Wine guitarist Brian Greenway. Earnshaw returned to Eureka, California where he worked for KIEM-TV; Bishop eventually returned to the US as well and went on to become a top songwriter in Nashville. Mike Stull passed away of a heart attack in 2002 while riding his motorcycle. Though the band never received the recognition of other power pop contemporaries like The Raspberries, Big Star or Badfinger, The Wackers lived on in infamy through the retelling of their anecdotal mythology filtering out of Montréal for more than three decades. Segarini never gave up hope in seeing the recognition – if not the fortunes – they deserved. Affirmation came in 2006 when Elektra optioned the band’s catalog to Collector’s Choice for CD re-issue stateside. A final stamp of approval came from Elektra’s Jac Holzman who sang the band’s praises in his 2007 biography “Follow The Music”. On July 24th, 2011, Segarini’s old band The Wackers reunited after 38 years for one show at Cherry Cola’s in Toronto, Ontario. The demos and mixes for ‘Wack N’ Roll’ were dusted off and sold as CDR’s from the stage. An official release is still pending; Bob Segarini died after a lengthy illness on July 10, 2023; The Wackers would reunite one final time on July 14, 2024 for a tribute event to Bob Segarini in Toronto. The line-up was Rand Bishop, Jeff Stattner, Norman Vosko, and Wayne Cullen. With notes from Bob Segarini, Ernie Earnshaw, and Kootch Trochim.

Brother Joel Wade started out playing trumpet, studying under Bobby Hales, then was later drawn to guitar. At the urging of his brother Brett, Joel took up bass and was soon recruited by Stallion Thumrock following the band’s first tour of the US. In early 1972, Bell and Brett Wade met with Claire Lawrence and Bill Henderson (The Collectors/ Chilliwack) to ask if they would consider producing Stallion Thumrock. Soon after, Keith Lawrence would become their manager and arrange the details for a recording contract. Time was scheduled in at the legendary A & M studio in Hollywood, California to record the band’s well rehearsed live repertoire of original songs. The tracks took only three days to record and an additional three days to overdub vocals and mix. The self-titled LP was released under the Haida Records label – distributed by A & M Canada. The single “Mayday” was released and the band launched two Trans-Canada concert tours to promote the album including a stop at the CBC in Toronto. Within six months following the tours they had disbanded. Brothers Brett and Joel Wade were signed to Epic Records and released the “Which Wade?” album in 1979. Following the CBS Records deal, Joel Wade signed an international songwriting deal with BMG. He has performed and produced numerous recording sessions with world renowned musicians Ringo Starr, Harry Neilson, Bob Rock, and Rik Emmett. Wade currently lives in Tulsa and records solo including his latest, 2005, CD ‘Don’t Look Back’.

By the time she was 20 she had released an independent cassette entitled ‘Ground Floor’. The following year, she participated in her Mom & aunt’s family album Kate & Anna McGarrigle’s ‘The McGarrigle Hour’ performing the song “Year of the Dragon”. Following this project, she began singing backup vocals for her brother, Rufus Wainwright. In 1999 she released a six-song self-titled EP. Wainwright was also following her passion for acting and after completing her drama studies at Montréal’s Concordia University, she moved to New York City, where she pursued her priority as a singer-songwriter. Determined to create her own path, and not one as the daughter of two famous musicians, Wainwright struggled to establish herself and make her own way through the business. In 2001, Wainwright recorded “Star Crossed Lovers” with Propellerheads for the Red Hot Organization’s Duke Ellington tribute compilation ‘Red Hot + Indigo’ to raise AIDS awareness through various charities. Two more independent EPs followed – ‘Factory’ (2001) and ‘Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole’ (2004). In 2004 she’d met producer Brad Albetta, who worked with her in pre-production and finally the production of 2005’s self-titled full-length debut album on Rounder in the US and Maple Music Recordings in Canada.In 2006 she performed Leonard Cohen’s “Tower of Song” and “The Traitor” at the Cohen tribute concert, film and CD entitled ‘Leonard Cohen: I’m Your Man’. In May 2007 Wainwright, mother Kate McGarrigle and cousin Lily Lanken performed “Golden Hair” and “See Emily Play” at the Syd Barrett memorial concert at the Barbican Centre in London, England. She also appeared at Bonnaroo, Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, V Festival (with Snow Patrol), Lollapalooza, and a performance at the Hollywood Bowl in September 2007 with Rufus Wainwright. She would also join Annie Lennox (Eurythmics) plus 22 other female artists to raise awareness about transmission of HIV to unborn children in Africa. The single “Sing”, featuring most of the same women’s ensemble singers, was released on World AIDS Day in December 2007. Wainwright would work with BRad Albetta again on her sophomore album, ‘I Know You’re Married But I’ve Got Feelings Too’, released in June 2008. The album’s guest musicians included Pete Townshend (The Who), Donald Fagen (Steely Dan), Garth Hudson (The Band), Kate & Anna McGarrigle as well as her brother Rufus. Wainwright’s latest is 2012’s ‘Come Home To Mama’.\n\nSingles\n\n2005 Factory/Pretty Good Day/Baby (Drowned In Sound – UK)\n\n2005 When the Day Is Short/New York, New York/I Was In the House When the House Burned Down (Live) ((Drowned In Sound – UK) DiS-012CD\n\n2005 Far Away (Drowned In Sound – UK) DiS-0015CDR\n\n2008 Bleeding All Over You (Radio Mix)/Love Is a Stranger [7″] (Drowned In Sound – UK) DiS-0038\n\n2008 Comin’ Tonight (Drowned in Sound – UK)\n\n2008 You Cheated Me (Drowned in Sound – UK)\n\n2012 Proserpina (Cooperative – UK) COOPR-567\n\n2012 Can You Believe It (Cooperative – UK) COOPR-568\n\nwith RUFUS WAINWRIGHT/MARTHA WAINWRIGHT\n\n1988 Tommy Come Back/[split w/RUFUS WAINWRIGHT] [7″] (Les Éditions La Fête)\n\nwith LIAM FROST featuring MARTHA WAINWRIGHT\n\n2010 Your Hand In Mind (Emperor – UK)\n\nwith SNOW PATROL featuring MARTHA WAINWRIGHT\n\n2010 Set the Fire To the Third Bar/You’re All I Have (Live) (Fiction – UK) STF-1\n\nAlbums\n\n1997 Ground Floor [cassette] (independent)\n\n1999 Martha Wainwright [6-song EP] (Querbes Service/Nettwerk) 36384\n\n2001 Factory [4-song EP] (Querbes Service/Nettwerk) 36385\n\n2004 Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole [4-song EP] (Querbes)\n\n2005 Martha Wainwright (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6445\n\n2005 I Will Internalize [5-song EP] (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6452\n\n2008 I Know You’re Married But I’ve Got Feelings Too (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6484\n\n2009 Daytrotter Session [5-song DigiFile] (Daytrotter – US)\n\n2010 Sans fusils, ni souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright’s Piaf Record (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6523\n\n2010 Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, à Paris [5-song EP] (Cooperative – UK)\n\n2012 Tiny Desk Concert [3-sing DigiFile] (NPR)\n\n2012 Come Home To Mama (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6545\n\n2013 Trauma: Chansons De La Série Télé Saison #4 (Maple Musc/Universal) MRCD-6548\n\n2016 Goodnight City (Cadence/Universal) CADCD-6606\n\n2021 Love Will Be Reborn (Pheromone) PHERCD-1062\n\nwith THE WAINRIGHT SISTERS\n\n2015 Songs In The Dark (Maple Music/Universal) MRCD-6580\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\nwith KATE & ANNA McGARRIGLE Featuring RUFUS WAINWRIGHT\n\n1998 “Allez-vous en” and “Year of the Dragon” on ‘The McGarrigle Hour'(Hannibal/Rykodisc) HNCD-1417\n\nWAINWRIGHT, Rufus\n\nBorn: July 22, 1973 in Rhinebeck, New York, USA\n\nThe Montréal-based son of folk singer-songwriters Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, is a classically trained pianist who grew up loving opera. During his formative years he often toured with his mother (Kate) and aunt (Anna), The McGarrigle Sisters, and the at the ripe old age of 14 earned both a JUNO Award nomination and Genie Award nomination for his writing and performance of a song in the television film ‘Tommy Tricker And The Stamp Traveler’. Wainwright studied piano and composition at McGill University’s Faculty of Music which he never completed. He was signed to the fledgling Dreamworks label that was so new and understaffed that they gave Wainwright free reign over his artistic vision and nearly unlimited budget. 56 songs were recorded over two years in Los Angeles, the self-titled, 12-song, debut features the production work of Jon Brion (Fiona Apple) and Pierre Marchand (Sarah McLachlan), with string arrangements done by Van Dyke Parks (Randy Newman, Ry Cooder, Brian Wilson) and backing harmonies provided by sister Martha Wainwright. Rolling Stone Magazine would declare Wainwright “Best New Artist of the Year’. He would also be nominated by the Gay & Lesbian American Music Awards for ‘Album of the Year’, ‘Pop Recording of the Year’ and ‘Video of the Year’, while winning for ‘Best New Artist’. Wainwright won a GLAAD Media Award for ‘Outstanding Music Album’ and a JUNO Award for ‘Best Alternative Album’. Despite these accolades the album failed to chart anywhere in the world. He toured with Sean Lennon and then began his first headline tour in the fall of 1998. In March 1999, Wainwright would begin a house gig at Maxwell’s in Hoboken, New Jersey. Wainwright lived in the Chelsea Hotel in New York City for six months which allowed him to write material for his second album. Pierre Marchand returned to produce the sessions for the record, ‘Poses’, which was released in June 2001.

They were able to make fast friends and tour with the likes of The Pursuit Of Happiness, The Barenaked Ladies, Junkhouse, Andrew Cash, The Northern Pikes and The Tragically Hip. Two notable demo tapes made the rounds in clubs and on record company desks in 1989 and 1990 which got them nominations for two CFNY-FM CASBY Awards for ‘Most Promising Band’ and ‘Best Western Canadian Band’. With the help of producer John Switzer they were able to record their debut CD ‘Lik My Traktor’ and followed this up with two VideoFACT funded videos for “Old” and “Alone Again”. Like the Barenaked Ladies that same year, their independent release gained such widespread critical praise that it sold 7,000 copies word of mouth, club gigging and frequent exposure on College radio not to mention two cross-Canada tours. It was only a matter of time before Warner Music decided to move in and re-issue the disc to a Canada-wide audience in 1993. Then Warner stuck them back on their third cross Canada tour with labelmates The Barenaked Ladies. The band got a push in Australia from Crowded House’s co-manager who likened Plumb’s voice to that band’s Neil Finn and ‘Lik My Traktor’ was released Down Under to critical acclaim. Suddenly, laurels were thrown at them: a Juno Award as ‘Best New Group’ and a coveted Campus Entertainment award as “Best Contemporary Music Recording Artists”. They wrote and recorded “Simple Brain” for Martin Scorsese executive produced film “Naked In New York”, and released an EP of new songs in Canada for their insatiable fans. On October 1st, 1994, in London, England, 27 months after the initial indie release of ‘Lik My Traktor’, the Waltons performed their 350th and final date in its support. The album had reached gold by the time they returned to Canada to start the next record. In 1995 they released ‘Cock’s Crow’ with producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda (Barenaked Ladies, Shuffle Demons, Vital Sines, Spirit Of The West) and featured guest appearances by members of Spirit Of The West and the Rheostatics. Three years later The Waltons released ‘Empire Hotel’ and another three years before their live album ‘Liv’ on Maple Music. The band called it a day in 2002.\n\nSingles\n\n1992 Colder Than You (Warner Music) WEA-18\n\n1992 In The Meantime (Reprise/Warner Music) PR0-CD-6636\n\n1993 The Naked Rain (Sire/Warner Music) 9633\n\n1995 End Of The World (Sire/Warner Music) 9188\n\n1995 Wascana (Warner Music)\n\n1995 Michelangelo’s Tummy (Warner Music) WEA-49\n\n1995 Wait For Me (Radio Edit) (Sire/Warner) PRCD-9292-2\n\n1998 Beats The Hell Out Of Me (Warner Music)\n\nAlbums\n\n1989 89 Demonstrations [cassette] (independent)\n\n1990 Demo Sandwich [cassette] (independent) WAL-CD0001\n\n1991 Lik My Traktor (independent) WAL-CD0002\n\n1993 Lik My Traktor [re-issue](Warner Music) 093624544524\n\n1994 Simple Brain [EP] (Warner Music) 96143\n\n1995 Cock’s Crow (Warner Music) 99435\n\n1998 Empire Hotel (Warner Music) 21388\n\n2001 Liv (Maple Music/Universal) 075-005\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1994 “Simple Brain” on ‘Naked In New York City” (Warner Music)\n\n1994 “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” on ‘Borrowed Tunes: A Tribute to Neil Young’ (Sony) 80199\n\n1995 “Simple Brain” on ‘The Kumbaya Album 1995’ (Warner Music) CD-11719\n\n1999 “Beats The Hell Out of Me” on ‘Friends Again’ (Reprise – US) 9-47100-2\n\nwith MOE BERG & THE WALTONS\n\n1995 “Gretzky Rocks” on ‘The Kumbaya Album 1995’ (Warner) CD-11719\n\nWAMMEE, The\n\nLonnie James (drums) / Michael (Lopez) Phillips (bass, vocals) / Richard Carstens (guitar, vocals)\n\nFrom Toronto, Ontario.

After moving to St. John’s in the mid-1960s, guitarist Gordon Quinton became lead guitarist of the local bands The Krystals and The Mountain Men. Returning to the acoustic guitar a few years later, he performed at coffeehouses and met Mary McKim, John Lacey, and Boyd Norman. The formed the band Country Dream along with Dennis Browne and Neil Rosenberg. By 1970, Quinton, Norman, and Lacey had a trio called Ward 6. They were invited by producer Tom Cahill to be the house band for a season on CBC-TV’s ‘All Around The Circle.’ Ward Six released an eponymous, nationally distributed album in 1971 to wide acclaim. Gordon Quinton has since produced nine instrumental guitar recordings – seven of which were on his own Woodnight Records label. He has also contributed musically on several recordings by local artists including John White, John Lane, Doug Lane, Johnny Cameron, Phyllis Morrissey, Shirley Montague, John Lacey, Craig Young and Larry Foley.

He sang and played guitar and wrote songs with Stephen Stohn. Ward was signed to Warner Brothers who brought in session musicians from the Brecker Brothers, the Average White Band and Moe Koffman himself to fabricate a studio record that didn’t even feature Ward’s own guitar playing – merely his voice. They released his debut ‘Spark of Desire’ in 1978 which spawned the commercial radio hit “Maybe Your Heart”. Unfortunately, a hit record in Canada does not necessarily mean a hit in the US and Warner stateside passed on the album and singles, leaving Ward with Canada as his sole market. His deal with Warner soured and Ward found himself, aside from writing more songs and touring sporadically, taking acting lessons and doing improv at Second City. He also wrote the Cover Girls song “The Boy Next Door”. In 1981 he signed with Edmonton-based House Of Lords Records who released his sophomore effort called, fittingly, ‘Time Stands Still’ which was produced by Jack Richardson (Guess Who). When MuchMusic launched its 24 hour video network (originally 8 hours repeated 3 times) Ward was recruited as one of the first on-air VeeJays who, between airing videos and interviewing rock stars would concoct ridiculous on-air skits utilizing many ‘characters’ in skit fashion and often accompanied by a rogues gallery of performers. One of these performers was his live-in girlfriend and aspiring vocalist Alannah Byles. She changed her name to Myles and did a backing vocals spot with Sheree Jeacocke and Shawne Jackson-Troiano on his Attic Records EP called ‘Christopher Ward’ in 1987. Their teaming would be fruitful as Ward developed her as an artist, writing most of the songs (or co-writing with David Tyson) that became the basis for her debut album. He initiated a meeting with Atlantic Records which led to a deal for Alannah. The self-titled debut album spawned the hits “Love Is” and the multi-million selling “Black Velvet” in 1989 and 1990. The song would also have an after life on country charts as a No.1 for Robin Lee. Ward quit his gig at MuchMusic and moved to LA after the success of Myles’ debut and also wrote several songs for the follow-up, ‘Rockinghorse’, which wasn’t quite as successful for Myles. In his early days, Ward was a member of Second City, along with a seventeen year old Mike Myers. Myers was a frequent guest on City Limits when Ward was the show’s host. In the ’90s Ward appeared in the ‘Austin Powers’ movies as a band member of the semi-fictional group Ming Tea, along with Mike Myers, Matthew Sweet, and Susannah Hoffs (The Bangles). Ward has written or co-written songs for Diana Ross, Wynonna Judd, Amanda Marshall, Tina Arena, Roch Voisine, Meredith Brooks, and Hilary Duff, among others. Ward moved to Paris, France in 2001 with his family to write a children’s novel, but has since returned to live in Toronto; in 2021 Ward released a new album entitled ‘Same River Twice’ where he revisited his hit songs including his own version of Alannah Myles’ hit “Black Velvet.” with notes from James Crammond and Robin Ward.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 Lost In A Love Song/Play One For Your Mother (Warners) CW-4033\n\n1977 Once In A Long Time/Dance Away (Warners) CW-4034\n\n1978 Maybe Your Heart/Dreamboat (Warners) CW-4035\n\n1978 Imagine A Song/Roll On Like a Wheel (Warners) CW-72000\n\n1979 No Time To Cry/Sweet Rose (Warners) CW-5501\n\n1981 So Long To Baby Jane/Mainstreet Kid (House Of Lords/Warners) HOL-2007\n\n1981 Heart Breakin’ Beauty/Steal My Heart (House Of Lords/Warners) HOL-2009\n\n1981 Future Girl/Time Stands Still (House of Lords/Warners) HOL-2010\n\n1981 Words On The Wire/Sonny Say You Will (House Of Lords/Warners) HOL-2014\n\n1987 Boys And Girls/Just Like Me (Attic) ATT-356\n\n1987 What Kind of Love/Two Can Play (Attic) ATT-362\n\n1988 Twist Of Fate/Take A Chance (MCA) MCA-52284\n\nAlbums\n\n1978 Spark of Desire (Warner) KWSC-92000\n\n1981 Time Stands Still (House Of Lords) HLR-10004\n\n1986 Christopher Ward [EP] (Attic) MIN-102\n\n2021 Same River Twice [DigiFile]\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1993 “Boys and Girls” on ‘Caught In the Attic’ [3CDs] (Attic) ATTIC-XX\n\nWARD, Nancy\n\nHamilton, Ontario multi-instrumentalist who was in Tranquillity Base with Ian Thomas as their keyboardist.

His first introduction to guitar was one his father brought home in hopes of learning but the guitar quickly disappeared again. He then sang in music classes in school, but instrumental training would come a few years later. Donmoyer, as a young teenager, learned lap steel guitar and was soon playing tunes by The Ventures, The Surfaris and other ‘Surf Bands’ of that era. Rock and pop guitar licks on a “Hawaiian style” guitar was unheard of, and his guitar teacher Richard Crotty was intrigued to the point that Donmoyer was hired as a student teacher. By 1963, the bug had bit, and Rick Donmoyer found himself in several bands. His first paying gig was with The Turbines while still in high school. Donmoyer hooke up with Jim Walker, Al Bowen, Scotty Lewis, and Brian Bickley to form The Kingbees. They went through several member changes that also included Pete Cassidy and John Csincsik. Some time later with classical guitarist-turned-bassist Terry Brett, the band was re-named The Wot. Meanwhile, folk-singer and guitarist Dana Snitch had been floating in and out of bands when Rick Donmoyer and Jim Walker met up with him in Toronto in the mid 60’s. Together they proceeded to seek out more players to form an R&B group with Dana playing bass. The rehearsals were both difficult to stage and non-cohesive so things fell apart, and Snitch headed to college in North Bay. He later returned to form the three-piece folk group Thomas Dana & Co. doing standards of the day and composing. He finished school and found himself as a guest artist doing warm-up gigs with Mass Destruction (featuring Donmoyer, Walker and Brett) in Woodstock, Ontario. Snitch was invited to play with the band as rhythm guitarist in its dying days. With the nucleus of Donmoyer (lead guitar, vocals), Terry Brett (bass), and Snitch (rhythm guitar, vocals) auditions were held to find a drummer. This is where they found Terry Hook. Dana Snitch would then expanded his roll to keyboardist, and after many rehearsals in the Hook basement in 1968, the heavier Warpig emerged. They released their self-titled debut with executive producer Robert Thomson and engineer Ken Fresian on Fonthill Records in 1972. With the popularity of the band increasing across Southern Ontario, London Records signed them, and re-issued a re-mastered record in 1973 with two re-recorded tracks in the running order: “Rock Star” and “Flaggit” with engineer Terry Brown (Rush, Max Webster, Klaatu). Warpig charted for seven weeks on the RPM charts peaking at No.52 with their single “Rock Star” in the summer of 1973. A second album, begun with engineer Tom Brennand of Deep Purple fame, was never completed. With the departure of Terry Hook from Warpig in 1974, followed a year later by Snitch, there were several attempts to carry on, but the heart of the band was gone; Donmoyer played and sang for many more years with various groups including the long surviving road-warrior band Ash Mountain until leaving the road and re-marrying. Employed in a music store and also as a “live sound” technician in Burlington Ontario for a few years, Donmoyer then landed a job in sales with Yorkville Sound where he is now District Sales Manager; 30 years after the band split up, the original album is still selling on Ebay for record amounts and has been bootlegged on CD and vinyl in the US and Europe. In January 2004, Donmoyer phoned Snitch, now living in New Brunswick, and after a get together in the spring of 2004 they decided to collaborate on completion of their long un-released original material along with some new song ideas. An authorized re-release of the original Warpig album was issued in 2006 on Relapse Records. with notes from Rick Donmoyer.\n\nSingles\n\n1972 Rock Star/Flaggit (London) M-17452\n\nAlbums\n\n1972 Warpig (Fonthill) F-103\n\n1973 Warpig [re-issue with alternate tracks] (London) NAS-13528\n\n2006 Warpig [CD re-issue] (Relapse/BMG) RR-6591\n\nWARREN, Cindy\n\nWarren first worked as a cosmetologist for Lionel Richie who encouraged her to pursue a career in music.

Their self-titled Serbia/Croatia released debut album on RTB Records attracted the attention of Attic Records and so the band relocated to Canada where they added Platt and Gretsch (ex-Frank Soda & The Imps). With the new line-up they released their self-titled debut in 1984, performed about ten shows, then promptly split up; Gretsch went on to join The Carpet Frogs; Platt joined Bayb with Doug Baynam and Wayne Sebrey. with notes from Jamie Larsen.\n\nSingles\n\n1984 Try Again/Money Lover (Attic) AT-323\n\nAlbums\n\n1983 Warriors (RTB – SERBIA) 2520079\n\n1983 Love Machine [4-song 12″ EP] (RTB – SERBIA) 1520113\n\n1984 Warriors (Attic) ATM-1206\n\nWASCANA\n\nDrew Lawrence (drums) / Mick Grainger (guitar) / Gerry Klein (vocals) / Brian Davis (guitar) / Norm Allard (saxophone) / Tom Toddington (trombone) / George Martin (trumpet) / Bob Deutscher (guitars) / Daryl Gutheil (keyboards) / Don Gutheil (vocals) / Rich Petersen (drums; replaced Lawrence 1973) / Craig Kaleal (drums) / Ken “Spider” Sinnaeve (bass) / Kenny Shields (vocals)\n\nFormed in the fall of 1970 in Regina, Saskatchewan at a boarding house owned by Duncan Blewett – one of the pioneers of LSD – the band originally called themselves Smoke. It featured Lawrence, Davis, and Klein who had all been in the band Stonehenge Slum Clearance together. Songwriter Mick Grainger suggested they take their name from the flowing Saskatchewan river Wascana and so they rebranded themselves. As the band mutated Lawrence brought in trumpet player George Martin, while Grainger brought in Bob Deutscher and the two Gutheil brothers both from the recently disbanded group Andantes. As the band pushed into more experimental jazz territory, Grainger found himself on the outside and left the band. Deutscher and Darryl Gutheil would take on the writing chores. Their very first gig took place at the University of Saskatchewan on January 29, 1971. The were well received and found themselves on the road throughout the province and points west. ith a catalog of road-tested original material under their belts, Wascana’s headed to CHED studios in Edmonton on July 17, 1971 for their first recording session with producer Tommy Banks. That same summer Vancouver booking agent Bruce Allen sent one of his agents, Shelley Siegel (future owner of Mushroom Records) to check the band out. He was so impressed, Allen booked Wascana to do the opening shows at the newly launched The Body Shop in Vancouver for the week of the 16th to 20th of August 1971. Wascana would then appear at the 2nd annual Woodtick festival known as “Woodtick Plus” on August 29, 1971 in Saskatoon. Several festivals in British Columbia followed. Siegel later took the band into Can-Base Studio in British Columbia to lay down an album’s worth of songs, but there was no follow through and the tapes were shelved. Tommy Banks would soon come calling wanting to release a single from the recordings the band had done back at CHED. The group had evolved and changed their sound through that summer and turned down the offer. Instead, in 1972, Wascana was invited to appear on CBC radio program ‘Great Canadian Gold Rush’ with host Terry David Mulligan. Wth producer Claire Lawrence (Collectors, Chilliwack), the band went into Century 21 Studio in Winnipeg to record four songs that would become a 7″ EP. The recordings interested musician and CBC National Rock Works radio host Ian Thomas (ex-Tranquillity Base) who took the band into the CBC Regina studio in February 1973 to record five more songs. In the Spring of 1973, Thomas took the band back to Century 21 studio where they recorded seven more songs. They shopped the album’s worth of material and got no interest. However, the staff at Century 21 were very impressed with the musical skill and professionalsm of the band itself. The studio, owned by members of The Eternals, had a production deal to record radio jingles and sound-alike generic hits albums. They signed Wascana to a two album deal with several radio jingles during the winter of 1973. The albums were released under the studio’s production band name The House of Random. They would appear on fifty commercial radio jingles for the likes of Husky Oil and Safeway among others. The productions weren’t what Wascana wanted to play, but the pay was very good. But during 1973 both Lawrence and Allard had begun following the teaching of the Krishna organization ISKCON. The band’s performances in clubs where alcohol was served conflicted with Krishna doctrine and it became apparent that Wascana was not aligned with Lawrence and Allard’s new philosophies. Wascana played their last gig in its original configuration at the Marigold in Regina on October 6, 1973. Lawrence moved briefly to Toronto, then headed to Los Angeles to become a Sanskrit translator, and a vedic astrologer. Allard left for Montreal to continue his work for ISKCON. A second iteration of the band with Rich Petersen replacing Lawrence began playing live in early 1974. But he would soon leave to return to Edmonton and Don Guthiel left as well. Their replacements were Craig Kaleal and Ken “Spider” Sinnaeve. Not long after Kaleal asked his old Witness Inc. bandmate Kenny Shields to join on vocals. The band carried on playing live through their demise in 1975; Darryl Guthiel, Shields, and Sinnaeve would form Streetheart.

Washbrook’s two brothers were child stars in the late 1950s: Johnny Washbrook appeared in ‘My Friend Flicka’ and Donald Washbrook in ‘Petticoat Junction’. Meanwhile Rick, by age 10, found himself drawn to music where he was encouraged to sing at a Christian camp he attended on Big Bear Lake, in California. Washbrook would later sing as a mezzo soprano in Saint Michael’s Choir. With his voice eventually deepening into a baritone, by 1970 he realized he also wanted to accompany himself on guitar. In 1971, the Washbrook family moved to Canada where Washbrook seriously began to study music. He studied with Italian classical guitar teacher John Perone weekly at Toronto’s Royal Conservatory of Music. Following high school, Washbrook attended Fanshawe College and studied record production and engineering in 1979. After finishing his music education, Washbrook ventured west in 1981. He accepted odd jobs to earn money so he could travel the Alaska Highway with his guitar. He played gigs at roadhouses along the way. In 1982, Washbrook returned to Markham, Ontario where his folks lived and studied privately for 3 years from Paul Reid of Humber College. Between 1986 and 1987, Washbrook released his first album – ‘Summer Roads’ – from which the title track and three other singles were significant Adult Contemporary/Country hits on Canadian radio. “I Don’t Believe” went to No.9 on Adult Contemporary radio across Canada. In 1992, Washbrook co-wrote “Rescued by the Arms of Love”, released by the Canadian band Glass Tiger. The record went to No.1 in Canada and No.3 on the Billboard Charts in the United States which opened many career doors for Washbrook as a recording artist, teacher and producer including a a SOCAN Award for co-writing. Washbrook has traveled extensively to make a living from his craft between 1983 and 2004 doing everything from bar gigs to lounges to cruise ships, and traveled the world performing in Tahiti, Costa Rica, Switzerland as well as throughout Ontario. A career highlight was performing for Prince Philip. In 2000, Washbrook recorded a CD tribute to the legendary guitarist Lenny Breau called ‘A Gypsy’s Bed’ which received accolades in ‘Guitar Player’ magazine stateside. As well, when the cream of Nashville’s session players heard Washbrook’s guitar playing they invited him to perform and teach at the Chet Atkins Festival in 2004 and 2005. After the release of his tribute to Lenny Breau, Washbrook was going to promote and tour his new CD, but unfortunately contracted adult chicken pox. This resulted in him being bedridden for eight months and he lost almost all movement in his left arm from ulnar nerve damage. He had to stop performing live. It was more than two years before he played live again and did studio work. In 2006 Washbrook released ‘Roncesvalles Tango’ during a period of renewed recorded. Meanwhile, between 2001 and 2008, Washbrook studied with Toronto jazz piano player Bob Erlendson who appeared on Washbrook’s 2009 album ‘West Mystic.’ He is a dedicated teacher, loves doing studio session work, producing and is branching into writing music for films. Washbrook teaches privately and also by correspondence through the use of cassettes.\n\nSingles\n\n1986 I Don’t Believe\n\n1986 Little Bit/Summer Roads (CC) RW-8601\n\n1986 I Don’t Believe/[same] (CC) RW-8602\n\n1986 Summer Roads/Little Road\n\n1987 Burgundy Girl/[same] (CC) RW-8703\n\nAlbums\n\n1997 Live At Dines-eez\n\n1998 Tapestry of Soul\n\n1999 Wedding In The Rain (Rick Washbrook)\n\n2001 A Gypsy’s Bed: A Tribute To Lenny Breau [2CD] (Rick Washbrook)\n\n2006 Roncesvalles Tango\n\n2007 Christmas Guitar In the Village Roncesvalles\n\n2008 Rick Washbrook\n\n2009 West Mystic\n\n2010 1906\n\nWASHBURN, Dan\n\nBorn: Daniel Myron Washburn\n\nFrom Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nSingles\n\n1989 Fiddle On The Mantle/[same] (Northumberland) NR-2222\n\n1990 You Make It Easy/[same] (Northumberland) NR-2225\n\n1990 Let Him Go/[same] (Northumberland) NR-2231\n\n1990 The King Of Man I Am/[same] (Northumberland) NR-2233-AA\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1989 “Forever Never Ends” on ‘QMFM Country 105 Peterborough – Country Harvest’ (QMFM) RDRCD-184\n\nWASHINGTON, Jackie\n\nBorn: November 12, 1919 in Hamilton, Ontario;\n\nDied: June 27, 2009 in Hamilton, Ontario\n\nIn 1919, Jackie Washington was born into a decidedly musical family, and was raised on a steady diet of the music his father, John Washington, brought into the home in the form of countless 78 RPM records and the songs he played on his button accordion and fiddle. By 1930, the younger Washington was performing regularly with his brothers Dickie, Reg and Ormsby in the Hamilton, Ontario area as The Four Washingtons. Their mother bought them a guitar, which went to Ormsby, the oldest of the four brothers. By the time they made it to their first gig with the guitar, it had gone terribly out of tune. Ormsby tried to play the instrument at the gig, but the results were disastrous. The guitar was then handed down to Jackie, who fell in love with the instrument. In the summer of 1938, tragedy struck the Washington family as Ormsby drowned in a swimming accident. A deeply saddened Jackie returned to Hamilton, where he found employment as a porter on Canadian Pacific Railroad’s sleeping cars. Developing a love for the steam trains and the Canadian landscape, Washington traveled across Central and Western Canada with his guitar slung across his shoulder. Among the country’s railroad workers, it soon became a known fact that when Jackie Washington would come to town, you could bet on a party happening that night. In the many years that followed, Washington’s accomplishments and experiences began to accumulate. He made the acquaintance of some of the most revered names in black music as they stopped by the Washington household on their way through town. Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong were among the many who stopped by to trade tunes with Jackie and enjoy Mrs. Washington’s home cooking. In 1948 Washington became Canada’s first black DJ on CHML-AM spinning records, performing live, and featuring guest appearances by jazz stars of the day. Nat “King” Cole heard Washington perform his original tune “Alone In the Dark” and wanted to record the song. For whatever reason, Washington refused. From the 1960’s onward, Washington focused on performing his songs and traditional folk tunes on an acoustic guitar. As part of the burgeoning Canadian folk scene he shared stages with up and coming acts including Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot (both of whom he would record with on their albums). He performed at London’s Home County Festival every year since its inception in 1975, and was an annual favourite in Sudbury. He released his debut solo album ‘Blues and Sentimental’ in 1976 and played with saxophonist Freddie Purser at the Windsor and Royal Taverns in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1980 Washington played the part of the janitor in the film adaptation of the play ‘Hank Williams: The Show He Never Gave’. He also released two singles on Hamilton’s Roto-Noto Records including “Is You Or Is You Ain’t My Baby?” with King Biscuit guesting. Washington was nominated for a JUNO Award in 1993 for ‘Best Roots & Traditional Album’, along with Ken Whiteley and Mose Scarlett for their album ‘Where Old Friends Meet’. In 1995 he was inducted into Hamilton’s Gallery of Distinction and released three albums that year. He won The Toronto Blues Society’s Lifetime Achievement ‘Blues With A Feeling Award’ at the Maple Blues Awards in 1998. The Ontario Council of Folk Festivals gave him the ‘Estelle Klein Lifetime Achievement Award’ in 2001. In 2002 he was inducted into the Canadian Jazz & Blues Hall of Fame. In 2003 he received an honorary ‘Doctorate in Humanities’ from Hamilton’s McMaster University. The Jackie Washington Rotary Park in Hamilton was dedicated in his name in 2004. Washington performed alongside Mose Scarlett and Ken Whiteley until his death in June 2009. with notes from Erin Benjamin (OCFF).\n\nSingles\n\nwith JACKIE WASHINGTON & THE MYSTERY BAND\n\n198- Day and Night Blues (Roto-Noto) RN-1014\n\n198- Is You Or Is You Ain’t My Baby?/Day and Night Blues (Roto-Noto) RN-1015\n\nAlbums\n\n1976 Blues and Sentimental (Knight) 11K-2001\n\n1995 Jackie Washington and Friends in Concert on December 4, 1994 (Sound of Jazz Concerts)\n\n1995 Keeping Out of Mischief (Pyramid) PD-014\n\n1998 Midnight Choo-Choo (Borealis) BCD-112\n\nwith MOSE SCARLETT, JACKIE WASHINGTON & KEN WHITELEY\n\n1991 Where Old Friends Meet (Borealis) PD-006\n\n1995 Three By Three: Old Friends Meet Again [3CD] (Pyramid) PD-013/014/015\n\n1999 We’ll Meet Again (Borealis) BCD-120\n\n2003 Sitting On A Rainbow (Borealis) BCD-153\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1976 “In My Solitude” on ‘Mariposa Folk Festival 1976’ (Mariposa) M76-002\n\nWASTED LIVES\n\nPhil Smith (vocals) / Brad Kent (guitar) / Colin Griffiths (guitar) / Mary Armstrong (bass) / Andy Graffiti (drums)Wasted Lives was formed by Brad Kent after being kicked out of his previous band DOA.

They became road warriors from their home base of Winnipeg playing 150 dates across Canada every year for 4 years. One show in particular, at Toronto’s legendary Horseshoe Tavern in 1991 attracted the attention of producer Chris Wardman’s girlfriend. She promised to put Wardman in touch with the band. Wardman eventually made it out to one of their shows and promised them a production commitment. He rushed them into Manta sound studio for some 2-track live off the floor demos and between other production chores, flew out to Winnipeg to properly produce a three song demo. Jake Gold’s The Management Trust (David GoGo, The Tragically Hip) also had their eye on the band and signed them to not only a management deal but to their music production outfit Sumo Productions. Using their clout with MCA Records, Sumo was able to release the band’s debut McLaren Furnace Room’ in 1992. Immediately compared to their label mates, The Tragically Hip, the band spent two more albums trying to make a mark for themselves with strong showings and rigorous touring of the albums In The Trees’ (1994) and Brand New Day’ (1996). After touring for Brand New Day’ they took a very short break before writing the next record. With the band living in different cities they wrote the album in Toronto and Winnipeg and after a year on the road they became quite homesick. In late 1997 the band went to Seattle to record their next album with producer Adam Kasper. The result was 1998’s Silent Radar’. The CD of the album included a CD-activated key’ to access multi-media material in a secret area of the band’s Internet website. The CD activated website was the first use of this technology for a major-label band. The band performed on April 2, 1998 as part of the Horseshoe Tavern’s 50th Anniversary and the performance was broadcast live on CFNY-FM. The band carried on without drummer Sammy Kohn in 2003. After the band fell apart in 2004, Ken Tizzard went on to join Thornley and Shadrak with Thornley drummer Sekou; The Watchmen reunited, with Kohn, in 2008. With notes from Lindsay Honeyman, Sammy Kohn, Kim Allison and Ken Tizzard.\n\nSingles\n\n1992 Run and Hide (Sumo/MCA)\n\n1992 Cracked (Sumo/MCA)\n\n1993 Must To Be Free (Sumo/MCA)\n\n1994 Boneyard Tree (Sumo/MCA) MCADS-9450\n\n1994 All Uncovered (Sumo/MCA) MCADS-9483\n\n1996 Zoom/Boneyard Tree (Live) (Sumo/MCA) MCADS- 9688\n\n1997 Stereo (EMI) DPRO-1678\n\n1997 Stereo/Any Day Now [7”] (EMI) 72438-5880172438-58801\n\n1998 Any Day Now (Radio Edit)/Stereo (Live Acoustic)/I’m Blind (EMI – Australia) 8867492\n\n1998 Any Day Now (Radio Edit)/Any Day Now (Album Version) (EMI – Netherlands) DPRO-1768\n\n1999 Brighter Hell (EMI)\n\nAlbums\n\n1989 The Watchmen [4-song cassette] (The Watchmen)\n\n1992 McLaren Furnace Room (Sumo/MCA) MCAMD-10697\n\n1994 In The Trees (Sumo/MCA) MCASD-11105\n\n1996 Brand New Day (Sumo/MCA) MCASD-81009\n\n1996 Beach Tunes [3-song EP] MCADS- 9629\n\n1997 Two Live Tracks & One Great Song [3-song EP] DPRO-7087\n\n1998 Silent Radar (EMI) 72438 59031 2 0\n\n1998 Live Radar [bonus with ‘Silent Radar’] (EMI) DPRO-1743\n\n2001 Slowmotion (EMI) 52457\n\n2014 In The Trees – Deluxe [2CD] (Universal) 0253797770\n\n2017 Live And In Stereo (Fifth Kid) FKR-014\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1992 “Run & Hide” on ‘New Stuff’ (MMS) NSCD-001\n\n1995 “34 Dead St.” on ‘The Kumbaya Album 1995’ (Warner) CD-11719\n\n1998 “Say Something (Live)” on ‘Edgefest 98 Rarities & Collectables’ (EMI) DPRO-1738\n\n1999 “I’m Blind” on ‘Much @ Edgefest 1999’ (MCA)\n\nWATER WALK, The\n\nDale Darlington (vocals, guitar) / Ike Eidsness (drums, percussion) / David Kershaw (bass, horns, keyboards) / Lynne Kellman (vocals, keys, violin; 1989)\n\nThe Water Walk was formed in Vancouver, British Columbia in October of 1985. After rehearsing and perfecting their original material they played a series of local support spots and soon entered the studio to work on demoing their songs. In January 1987 the band signed with Nettwerk Records and re-entered the studio with producer Dave Ogilvie (54-40, Grapes Of Wrath, Skinny Puppy). The Water Walk released their self-titled debut album in 1987. They were well received by critics but they supplemented their time as the house band that played on Sarah McLachlan’s first album and then Lava Hay. Kershaw would leave Water Walk and stay on with Lava Hay (and, later, Mae Moore’s band). Eidsness left soon after. Darlington brought in vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Lynne Kellman and returned to the studio with producer Greg Reely (Sarah McLachlan, Moev, Caterwaul). In August of 1990 The Water Walk released their second album ‘(Thingamajig)’ on Nettwerk through I.R.S Records. The album did well but the group lost momentum and finally split up in 1993; Darlington got into film and video work and currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia; Kellman signed to RCA Records in 1995 and released ‘In the Galaxy’ under the name Another Girl in late 1996 which failed to sell, but was critically acclaimed. She is currently in a band with former members of The Matthew Good Band, Copyright, and others called CLIC; Eidsness went on to join Royal Grand Prix. with notes from Richard Rice, and Ralph Alfonso.\n\nAlbums\n\n1987 The Water Walk (Nettwerk) NTL-30013\n\n1990 (Thingamajig) (I.R.S./Nettwerk) X2-13038\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1987 “Colours” on ‘Nettwerk Sound Sampler: Food For Thought’ (Nettwerk) NTL-30007\n\n1988 “Never Leaving Eden Again” on ‘Nettwerk Sound Sampler: Food For Thought Volume 2’ (Nettwerk) NTL-30025\n\nWATERS, Sneezy\n\nBorn: Peter Hodgson on March 1, 1945 in Ottawa, Ontario\n\nSinger-songwriter, guitarist Peter Hodgson Sneezy Waters, began his musical career as a member of The Children with Bruce Cockburn, and later with Rosewood Dream for the Canadian music delegation at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan. In the early 1970s, he took on the stage name Sneezy Waters and assembled a backing band called The Excellent Band. They became regular performers at folk festivals and nightclubs across Canada. In November 1977, Waters created the music revue ‘Hank Williams: The Show He Never Gave’ that debuted at the Beacon Arms Hotel in Ottawa, Ontario. He took the show on the road and would execute over 300 performances across Canada and the U.S. with one special performance at a cultural exhibition in Berlin in 1983. During this period he released his first solo album ‘(You’ve Got) Sawdust on the Floor of Your Heart’ in 1978).

The movie was nominated for ‘Best Country Motion Picture’ at the Academy of Country Music Awards in 1984. Waters won the ‘Best Actor’ award for the role at the ‘3e Festival International du Film Musicale’ in Grenoble, France the same year. Waters also released an album called ‘Sneezy Waters Sings Hank Williams’ in 1981, songs of which would later appear in the National Film Board of Canada movie ‘John Cat.’ During the 1980s he acted in CBC-TV shows ‘Backstretch’ and ‘Blind Faith’ (a role that earned him an ACTRA award nomination), as well as in an episode of the new ‘Twilight Zone’. He continued to perform across Canada, as Sneezy Waters And His Very Fine Band which led to musical appearances on shows like ‘The Family Brown Show’, ‘The Alan Thicke Show’, and ‘The Tommy Hunter Show.’ Water also produced the soundtrack of ‘Terminal Blues’ for the National Arts Centre of Canada. and music from his Hank Williams album is featured in the film ‘John Cat’ for the National Film Board of Canada. Water was inducted into the Ottawa Valley Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997.

Samson following his departure from the band Propaghandi. The group featured members of competing Winnipeg punk act Red Fisher John P. Sutton and Jason Tait so that they might create something more commercially accessible. Through a deal with indie label G7 Welcoming Committee The Weakerthans released their debut album, ‘Fallow’, in 1997 to positive reviews. Guitarist Stephen Carroll (ex-Painted Thin), joined the band and appeared on their sophomore album ‘Left and Leaving’ in 2000 which was produced by Ian Blurton [In 2005 the album placed in the Top10 ‘Best Canadian Albums of All Time’ readers’ poll in Chart Magazine].In 2003, the band moved to Epitaph Records and recorded their third album with Ian Blurton producing once more. ‘Reconstruction Site’ was released in 2003 and became a critical and commercial success garnering them plenty of Canadian radio play. By August of 2004 Sutton left the group and was replaced by Greg Smith. The album ‘Reunion Tour’ was released in September 2007. Their label, Epitaph, also re-issued the band’s first two indie albums in November that year. Following The Weakerthans’ appearance at the Barenaked Ladies’ annual ‘Ships and Dip’ sea cruise, the band went on hiatus while Samson released a series of novelty 7″ singles (and a subsequent solo album). The Mahones resumed with a live record entitled ‘Live at the Burton Cummings Theatre’ in March 2010. They then went to work on a collaboration with Jim Bryson entitled ‘The Falcon Lake Incident’ which was released in October 2010.\n\nSingles\n\n2001 Watermark (G7 Welcoming Committee) G7-018\n\n2002 Fallow (G7 Welcoming Committee)\n\n2007 Civil Twilight (Epitaph) 86877-251\n\nAlbums\n\n1997 Fallow (G7 Welcoming Committee) G7-003\n\n2000 Left and Leaving (G7 Welcoming Committee) G7-013\n\n2003 Reconstruction Site (Epitaph) 86682\n\n2007 Reunion Tour (Epitaph) 86877\n\nwith JIM BRYSON & THE WEAKERTHANS\n\n2010 The Falcon Lake Incident\n\nWEATHERMEN, The\n\nDoug Watt (bass) / Iain Grant (electric guitar, backing vocals) / Marty Coles (drums, backing vocals) / Seth Matson (vocals, acoustic guitar)\n\nFrom Guelph, Ontario.; Doug Watt and Marty Coles would go on to Celtic Blue and Uisce Beatha; Doug Watt died September 18, 2019.

They hung around the city playing guitar and singing to anyone that would listen. They later met up with Mike O’Neil and asked him to join. Soon after the trio connected with John Dufek who played bass guitar. In 1971 Wednesday was born. They began to play the Ontario circuit performing covers of contemporary hits and 1950’s standards. With some recording at Manta Studios in Toronto they put together their first single “Hang On Girl” with producer John Driscoll. The record came out on the Toronto offshoot label of the Ampex tape company but the label couldn’t get the record significant airplay. By the time they’d honed their live chops in 1973 they had remade the Wayne Cochran song “Last Kiss”. This time Driscoll hand delivered the single to radio stations where CFTR-AM played it immediately and indefinitely. Influential 1050 CHUM-AM jumped on the track and the song went to No.2, giving way to an avalanche of Canadian radio support. This buzz spilled over into the US market and the record made Billboard’s ‘Hot 100’. The song would go on to sell well over 200,000 copies. The band was awarded a ‘RPM Maple Leaf Award’ for outstanding sales (1973) and were nominated for several JUNOS as well. A debut album was cut in 1974 with a second hit, “Teen Angel” (1974) making it to No.15. Performing around Canada, and a few dates in the US, led to massive fan support followed by some time off to record a follow-up record. A new single in 1975, “Fly Away” made it to No. 21 on the charts and was followed by a cover of the Beatles classic “She’s A Woman”. But Ampex was having problems and the next single “Here Today, Gone Tomorrow” (originally intended as Ampex #AC-1375) became the first single on Driscoll’s newly formed Skyline Records. In 1976 Wednesday released their sophomore album ‘Loving You Baby’. The title track, an Elton John/Bernie Taupin composition reached No.17. By 1977 the band had started pushing for more of its own compositions. They wanted to break away from cover tunes and into more power pop/glam material a la Sweet. To that extent, they rechristened the band ‘Wenzday’ and released ‘Nearly Made It’ that year. Still, songs like Les Emmerson’s “I Was Built For Comfort”, Dion’s “Ruby Baby” and the Martin-Coulter (Bay City Rollers) song “Fancy Pants” were added to appease Skyline execs who wanted a repeat of their two previous gold records. The singles and the album faired poorly and Begg left in 1978. He would later work in the bands Lockerbie, The Scott Street Band, as well as recording with the groups The Edge, and The September Skye Band. Wednesday carried on with drummer Fred Duvall, but after a single featuring their versions of The Turtles’ “Elenore” and Tommy Roe’s “Sheila, the band called it quits. A reformed Wednesday still perform frequently in the Oshawa area; The band was inducted into the Oshawa Music Hall of Fame in the summer of 2022; Randy Begg passed away December 20, 2022. with notes from Kelly Devoe, John Driscoll, Mark Riley, Dan Brisebois, Paul Andrew Smith, and Randy Begg.\n\nSingles\n\n1971 Hang On Girl/Velvet Colours (Ampex) AC-1304\n\n1973 Last Kiss/Without You (Ampex) AC-1325\n\n1974 Teen Angel/Taking Me Home (Ampex) AC-1355\n\n1974 Roses Are Red/Ride (Ampex) AC-1362\n\n1975 Fly Away/Good Time Girl (Ampex) AC-1365\n\n1975 She’s A Woman/Good Time Girl (Ampex) AC-1370\n\n1975 Last Kiss/Sunday (Sussex – UK) SR-507\n\n1975 Last Kiss/Teen Angel (Skyline/Quality) SLGT-194X\n\n1975 Here Today, Gone Tomorrow/What’s On My Mind (Skyline) SKY-001\n\n1976 Loving You Baby/Don’t Let Me Wait Too Long (Skyline/Quality) SKY-003\n\n1976 Doin’ The Best I Can/Could You Refuse Her (Skyline) SKY-006\n\n1981 Elenore/Sheila (Quality) 2397\n\nas WENZDAY\n\n1976 Ruby Baby/Melody Moon (Skyline/Quality) SKY-011\n\n1977 Fancy Pants/Through Your Head (Skyline/Quality) SKY-012\n\n1977 Ride Me/Nearly Made It (Skyline/Quality) SKY-014\n\n1977 Now You’re A Lady/Dream Queen (Skyline/Quality) SKY-016\n\nAlbums\n\n1974 Last Kiss (Ampex) AC-10152\n\n1976 Loving You Baby (Skyline) SKY-10160\n\nas WENZDAY\n\n1977 Nearly Made It (Skyline/Quality) SKY-10164\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1973 “Last Kiss” on ‘Concept’ [Gold] (Concept 376/Arc) PRP-208\n\n1973 “Last Kiss” on ‘Sound Explosion’ (K-Tel) TC-213\n\n1973 “Teen Angel” on ‘Canadian Mint’ (K-Tel) TC-215\n\n1974 “Fly Away” on ‘Sounds Spectacular’ (K-Tel) TC-222\n\n1975 “Last Kiss” on ‘Canada Gold – 22 Karat Hits’ (K-Tel) TC-225\n\n1975 “Fly Away” on ‘Music Express’ (K-Tel) TC-228\n\n1976 “Loving You Baby” on ‘Mindbender’ (K-Tel) TC-231\n\n1976 “Loving You Baby” on ‘Canada’s Finest’ (K-Tel) TC-232\n\nWEED\n\nCristina Handrabur (vocals) / Dan Handrabur (keyboards, violins, guitars, turntables, vocals)\n\nExperimental duo from Vancouver, British Columbia featuring former Off And Gone member Dan Handrabur.

With bass player Joe Chithalen they performed under the name Weeping Tile. They eventually added Gord Tough and Smirnios to round out the line-up later that year. In 1994 they recorded a seven 7 cassette. In 1995 they re-issued the cassette on CD under the name ‘eePee’ but Harmer sound found herself having to rebuild the act from scratch with her sister, Mary, Luther Wright, and Camille Giroux coming on board. It was this line-up that was signed to WEA Records where they released several successful albums including 1997’s ‘Valentino’ which featured the addition of new bassist Sticky Henderson. Following national touring to support the album – where Weeping Tile’s members switched instruments after their performances and played as The Wadds – the band lost their deal with WEA. They managed to record another independent cassette in 1998 entitled ‘This Great Black Night’ before splitting up; Harmer would go on to a successful solo career starting with her first album on Universal in 2000; Henderson would join Merrill Nisker (aka Peaches) in The Shits and later played in Ass Machine. Her most recent projects have been Music Maul and Velvet Claws; Wright formed his own band Luther Wright & The Wrongs and made headlines in recent years by recording a note-for-note Country recreation of Pink Floyd’s album ‘The Wall’; between Harmer’s solo projects the band occasionally reunites in Kingston, Ontario to play for fun. In 2007 they recorded “Public Square” for a Rheostatics tribute album.
