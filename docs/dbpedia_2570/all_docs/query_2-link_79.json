        "text": "Katherine Jenkins’ three-year-old daughter is on her album and we feel a little unaccomplished.\n\nWhat were you doing for the first three years of your life?\n\nWe suspect your daily activities did not including laying down some vocals in the studio.\n\nWhile other kids wet their pants and draw on the walls with crayons, young Aaliyah Reign has been getting a head start in her showbiz career.\n\nHer opera singing mum revealed her daughter makes a surprise appearance on her ‘most personal’ album to date, Guiding Light, during an interview on ITV1’s Lorraine on Monday morning.\n\nThe 38-year-old appeared on the morning show to talk about her new music, being a mother-of-two and that unexpected feud she had with Alfie Boe, her former West End co-star.\n\n‘My daughter features a little on there [the album], she reads a little line,’ the Hallelujah singer, who is also mum to son Xander Robert, said of her new project.\n\nShe added: ‘My son is seven months, to take him into the studio was really lovely. It’s been a really lovely, happy album to make.’\n\n‘I’m absolutely loving being a mum. It’s the best thing that ever happened,’ Katherine continued.\n\nThis comes after the mezzo-soprano found herself in hot water after Alfie Boe defaced a picture of the star in HMV.\n\nJust last week she confirmed that the singer had called her a c***, and has scrawled the word across the poster of her.\n\nHowever, despite the apparent bad feelings, it turns out Katherine has no feud against the Les Miserables star.\n\nShe told Lorraine: ‘I sort of feel like I don’t want to talk about it – there’s no feud from my side.’\n\nWhen Lorraine asked about the poster, she added: ‘HMV staff told me that when I arrived there.\n\n‘But it’s Christmas and I just want to focus on that – I wish Alfie all the best and I don’t know why I happened.’\n\nThe star confirmed the news when chatting on Loose Women earlier this week.\n\nHere she addressed the situation and revealed what had actually happened.\n\nAlfie has refused to comment on the incident, however, Katherine told the panel: ‘I wish I could tell you that story isn’t true, but that did happen.\n\n‘We were in Manchester and I’d read there was this big feud between us; I don’t know anything about a feud. I’ve got two kids and an album out – I don’t have time to be arguing with anybody.’\n\nShe added: ‘I don’t know what makes somebody do that. You’d have to ask him, really, but obviously, it’s upsetting. Nobody wants to read that.’\n\nHowever, if anyone thought a little C-bomb was going to bring Katherine down they were wrong.\n\n‘I’m a big girl and I just want to talk about happier things and not let that affect this week,’ the singer assured.\n\nLorraine airs weekdays at 8.30 on ITV.\n\nMORE : Harry and Meghan reject William and Kate’s offer of a place to stay at Christmas"
