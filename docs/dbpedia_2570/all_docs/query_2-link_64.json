        "text": "The biggest selling classical artist of the century, Katherine Jenkins OBE, announces the release of her 14th studio album, ‘Cinema Paradiso’ and 2021 UK Tour including a date at the Hall.\n\nComprised of 15 iconic tracks, ‘Cinema Paradiso’ is a collection of unforgettable songs from some of the world’s best loved movie moments including; ‘Moon River’ from Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Pinocchio’s‘When You Wish Upon A Star’, ‘Tonight’ from West Side Story, featuring fellow Welsh star, Luke Evans, as well as themes from Schindler’s List, Lord of the Rings and Dances with Wolves.\n\nKatherine says – “I’ve always loved movie soundtracks. I wanted to create an iconic movie moment with this record – all the best film musical themes that we know and love, all together on one album. The last few albums I’ve made have been inspired by what’s happening in my own world. This one in particular was inspired by the things that were going on around me. Having played my first movie role last year, it felt like a natural transition for me.”\n\nRecent exciting endeavours in the world of film have been a huge inspiration in the making of the new album – one of which is Katherine’s role in the upcoming film ‘Minamata’, directed by her husband Andrew Levitas.\n\nThis film not only sees Katherine star in her first movie role, but she also co-wrote the title track with Eminem’s right hand woman Skylar Grey, and performed on the film score written by Sakamoto, the Academy Award winner, singer, songwriter, record producer, activist, and actor. ‘Minamata’ is yet another example of why Katherine is one of the world’s most prolific artists – a true example of her multifaceted talents. She stars alongside Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy in ‘Minamata’ which is set for release later on this year. Katherine has recently returned from the Berlin International Film Festival where ‘Minamata’ received its world premiere and glowing reviews from the film industry and fans alike."
