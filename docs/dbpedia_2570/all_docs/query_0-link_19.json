        "text": "Blondie\n\nDebbie Harry – circa 1977\n\n“I know a girl from a lonely street / Cold as ice cream but still as sweet” – ‘Sunday Girl’ (Chris Stein)\n\nIn 1979 the battle lines are clear. On one side is new wave, the better-mannered offspring of punk rock. On the opposing side is disco, a dance-oriented style of music. “Disco sucks,” proclaim new wave fans, sneering at the vapid dance grooves of disco. The patrons of disco don’t even bother acknowledging the existence of new wave, being entirely concerned with their own hedonistic pursuits. However, American new wave band Blondie is poised to bridge these differences with a song called ‘Heart Of Glass’.\n\nThe frontperson of Blondie is Debbie Harry. She is born Angela Tremble on 1 July 1945 in Miami, Florida, U.S.A. At three months of age, the baby is adopted by Richard Smith Harry and Catherine Harry (nee Peters) and renamed Deborah Ann Harry. Debbie Harry never knows her biological parents. “I know who I am, and it would be an insult to the Harrys,” says Debbie of her refusal to seek out her birth parents. Later she concedes, “I wanted to track them down; I figured I should do it before they were gone. But I was limited by the legalities of that kind of search in the U.S.” So the result of Debbie’s efforts is, “Nothing.”\n\nRichard and Catherine Harry are the proprietors of a gift shop in Hawthorne, New Jersey – though Richard is also described as ‘a salesman.’ As a child, Debbie Harry daydreams that Hollywood movie star Marilyn Monroe may be her real mother. Asked of her youthful ambitions, Debbie claims she wanted, “To be famous, what else?” Debbie Harry begins dyeing her hair when she is 12, experimenting with various shades of violet before settling on her trademark blonde tresses. Debbie attends Hawthorne High School from which she graduates in 1963. Her early musical influences include rock ‘n’ roll pioneers Fats Domino and Bo Diddley. “What I really wanted was to be a beatnik, I really wanted to be an underground artist,” Debbie recollects. So her influences also include the beats and their favoured music, jazz. “I had a boyfriend who was hip. We’d go to the Village [i.e. Greenwich Village in New York] to see bands.”\n\nDebbie Harry continues her education at Centenary College in Hackettstown, New Jersey. She graduates in 1965 with an Associate of Arts degree.\n\nIn the late 1960s Debbie Harry moves to New York City. While nurturing musical ambitions, Debbie works at a number of jobs over the next few years. She is a secretary at the New York office of BBC Radio for a year. Debbie works as a barmaid and as a waitress at a New York club called Max’s Kansas City. Debbie Harry is a beautician; a go-go dancer in a Union City, New Jersey, discotheque; and works as a [brunette] Playboy bunny. “Being hot never hurts,” she acknowledges. Debbie Harry also works in New York City’s first Head Shop (a store that sells paraphernalia related to the use of cannabis and other recreational drugs).\n\nFrom early 1967 to late 1968 Debbie Harry provides backing vocals for a folk rock group called Wind In The Willows. The band’s name is taken from Kenneth Grahame’s children’s book ‘The Wind in the Willows’ (1908). The other members of Wind In The Willows are: Paul Klein (vocals, guitar), Peter Britain (vocals, guitar), Ida X (a.k.a. Ida Andrews) (flute), Wayne Kirby (keyboards), Steve ‘Marvello’ De Phillips (bass), Gil Fields (drums), Anton Carysforth (drums) and ‘Freddy’ (spiritual advisor). The band records only one album, ‘Wind In The Willows’ (1968), before breaking up.\n\nDebbie Harry is briefly part of a four-piece female vocal group called The B-Girls.\n\nFrom October 1973 to July 1974 Debbie Harry is one third of a female vocal group called The Stilettos (sometimes rendered as ‘The Stilettoes’). The other two girls are Elda Gentile and Amanda Jones (though sometimes Rosie Ross also provides vocals). With dyed-blonde hair, The Stilettos sing ‘high camp songs’ such as ‘Lady Marmalade’ and ‘Leader Of The Pack’. One of the customers who attends a Stilettos gig likes the act, but likes Debbie Harry even more. His name is Chris Stein.\n\nChristopher Stein is born on 5 January 1950 in Brooklyn, New York. He is the only child of Ben and Estelle Stein, a Jewish couple. Chris attends PS [Public School] 199 for grades one to six. He wants to be an Egyptologist until, at age 11, Chris’ parents buy him his first guitar and his focus changes to music. Chris Stein goes on to junior high at Andres Hudde. Stein runs into trouble when he moves on to Midwood High School. “I was thrown out for having long hair. It was in the 1960s. That was the reason I was given. I was probably acting up a little. It was in the middle of my junior year in high school [1965] and the Dean of the school was a kind of severe fellow.” Chris Stein and a couple of his fellow students are ejected but various civil liberties pressure groups protest and an offer is extended to return to Midwood “within a week or two.” However, “My mom found a cheap private school,” so Chris Stein finishes high school at Quintanos School for Young Professionals. Apparently, Chris Stein then spends some time as an art student.\n\nFrom early 1973 to October 1973, Chris Stein is in a band called The Magic Tramps. The group consists of: Eric Emerson (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Young Blood (guitar), Larry Chaplin (violin), Walter Ego (bass) and Sesu [no other name] (drums).\n\nSo Chris Stein sees Debbie Harry in The Stilettos and a bond forms between the two. “It was easy to relate to the complete stranger in the audience,” Debbie reports. “Chris and I first started working together in 1973.” Chris claims there is “an affinity” between them. “We’re very much on the same page,” he adds. Debbie concludes, “I’m an idiot. He’s a fool. Perfect!”\n\nDebbie Harry and Chris Stein become lovers and Chris joins The Stilettos backing band. At this point, Debbie Harry, Elda Gentile and Amanda Jones have a small group of backing musicians: Chris Stein (guitar), Fred Smith (born 10 April 1948) (guitar) and Billy O’Connor (4 October 1953-29 March 2015) (drums).\n\nIn July 1974 Debbie Harry and Chris Stein take The Stilettos backing musicians with them and form a new act. This band is briefly known as Angel And The Snake. It then becomes Blondie. The new name is derived from the term of address – “Hey, Blondie!” – truck drivers use when they spy the group’s lead singer with her dyed blonde hair on the streets.\n\nThe debut line-up of Blondie in August 1974 is: Debbie Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Fred Smith (bass), Billy O’Connor (drums) and two backing vocalists known only as Jackie and Julie.\n\nIn October 1974 the membership of Blondie shifts to this configuration: Debbie Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Ivan Kral (born 12 May 1948 in Prague, Czechoslovakia) (guitar), Fred Smith (bass), Clem Burke (drums), Tish Bellomo (backing vocals) and her sister, Eileen ‘Snooky’ Bellomo (backing vocals).\n\n(Note: Departing Blondie drummer Billy O’Connor has a stroke in July 2014 and dies of related complications in March of the following year.)\n\nClem Burke is born Clement Bozewski on 24 November 1955 in Bayonne, New Jersey. Clem works with the Saint Andrew Bridgmen Drum and Bugle Corps in Bayonne. In the late 1960s-early 1970s Clem Burke plays drums in Total Environment and The Sweet Willie Jam Band, two cover bands in the Bayonne area.\n\nThe line-up of Blondie is further refined. The backing vocalists are dispensed with and Fred Smith and Ivan Kral move on to other bands – respectively, Television and The Patti Smith Group. The August 1975 version of Blondie is: Debbie Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), Gary Valentine (bass) and Clem Burke (drums).\n\nJimmy Destri is born James Mollica on 13 April 1954 in Brooklyn, New York. He comes from an Italian family background. Jimmy’s father is a novelist who writes screenplays and, later, advertising copy. Jimmy’s mother is a housewife. Jimmy Destri/Mollica has a sister named Donna. Jimmy grows up in Borough Park in Brooklyn in his grandmother’s house. Music is part of the family life. Jimmy’s uncle plays drums in Joey Dee And The Starliters who have a no. 1 single in February 1962 with ‘Peppermint Twist’. James Mollica teaches himself to play drums, bass and piano. He then finds gigs with local bands. True to his Italian background, the lad attends Catholic schools and goes on to Bishop Ford Central Catholic High School in Brooklyn. Jimmy Destri drops out of high school to join his first band, 86 Proof. In the early 1970s he plays in a group called Milk And Cookies.\n\nGary Valentine is born Gary Joseph Lachman on 24 December 1955 in Bayonne, New Jersey. Gary Valentine is a friend of Blondie’s drummer, Clem Burke (also from Bayonne). It is Burke who recruits Valentine to join Blondie in April 1975.\n\nBlondie build up ‘a sizable underground following’ playing in New York clubs such as CBGBs, Max’s Kansas City and Club 51. (Ironically, Debbie Harry had previously worked as a waitress at Max’s Kansas City.) “In the early days, I often felt that I was taking a math test when we were playing,” recalls Chris Stein. “It was a profound feeling of having to prove myself.”\n\nBlondie come to the attention of producer Richard Gottehrer who helps them secure a recording contract with the Private Stock label in 1976.\n\nThe music of Blondie is usually identified as punk rock or new wave. While The Stilettos made a virtue out of ‘high camp’ renditions of old songs, in their earliest form Blondie produce ‘an original updating of early 1960s girl group clichés.’ Although there is still a certain arch quality to their songs, it is less blatantly tongue-in-cheek. Punk rock is a mid-1970s deconstruction of the pretentiousness weighing down rock music. “We were very minimal when we started, very rough-edged,” explains vocalist Debbie Harry of how Blondie fit into the punk ethos. “The punk period was about wanting change, having a more urbane kind of sensibility and some weird kind of wit,” she adds. Actually, this description sounds more like new wave, the genre which succeeds punk and the style which is a more appropriate label for Blondie. The raw aggression of punk is absent from new wave which shares a similar back-to-basics, hard-and-fast propulsive quality but incorporates a quirkier, wilfully odd worldview. As time passes, even new wave proves too limiting a tag for Blondie. More and more strands become woven into their musical tapestry. Debbie Harry recalls discussions that went, “Let’s do this experiment. Let’s mix up a bit of disco and techno sounds with a rock beat. Let’s do it with reggae. Let’s try some rap.”\n\nAlthough Blondie record some cover versions of songs by other recording artists and occasionally involve outside composers, most of the band’s repertoire is written within the group. The most prolific songwriting team in Blondie is Debbie Harry and Chris Stein. “I really, really like writing songs,” asserts Harry. Just as Stein and Harry are complementary as a romantic couple, the chemistry extends to their songwriting. “He was fun and interesting and cute. And we just had a good time together. Our personalities blend – we spark off each other,” says Debbie. Unless otherwise stated, all Blondie songs referred to here are co-written by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein.\n\nMuch of the focus of Blondie is centred on their lead vocalist and frontperson Debbie Harry. She is the ‘much-photographed sex symbol of rock.’ Harry is ‘a pop-culture pin-up of the media age.’ Perhaps most notoriously, Blondie’s vocalist is the ‘Marilyn Monroe of rock.’ Debbie’s singing is given significantly less attention by the press, but it is noted that, ‘though Harry’s pretty soprano is seemingly unsuited for rock, she catches the bite of the music in her phrasing.’\n\nBlondie’s first single is ‘X Offender’, released on 17 June 1976. The song was originally titled ‘Sex Offender’, but is changed to avoid ‘stirring up controversy.’ ‘X Offender’ is co-written by vocalist Debbie Harry and bassist Gary Valentine. The track is produced by Richard Gottehrer. It is a witty song with Debbie’s narrator lusting after the “big and fine…public defender” who has arrested her. The cheesy organ, the sighing backing vocals and twanging guitar solo are all hallmarks of the female vocal group hits of the early 1960s that Blondie is emulating – or parodying. ‘X Offender’ is ‘commercially ignored’ and fails to chart.\n\nThe B side to ‘X Offender’ is a song called ‘In The Flesh’. The Australian television rock program ‘Countdown’ accidentally plays ‘In The Flesh’ instead of ‘X Offender’ in a characteristically lovable blunder by the show’s music director, Ian ‘Molly’ Meldrum. However, the video gets such a good reaction that ‘In The Flesh’ (AUS no. 2) becomes Blondie’s second single in October 1976. It becomes a freakish hit in Australia and Blondie’s first hit anywhere in the world. ‘In The Flesh’ ‘seems naughtier than it really is’ since it is not talking about getting naked, but rather refers to meeting in person. However, given Debbie Harry’s sex symbol purring, such alternative interpretations are perhaps not important. Even more so than ‘X Offender’, ‘In The Flesh’ sounds like a lost song from fifteen years earlier with its cooing backing vocals and gently tinkling backing. Those backing vocals are provided by Micki Harris, Hilda Harris and Ellie Greenwich. The last-named actually co-wrote hits for The Ronettes and The Crystals, the same female vocal acts Blondie is aping.\n\nThe debut album, ‘Blondie’ (1976) (UK no. 75, AUS no. 14), is released on Private Stock in December. Production duties are divided amongst Richard Gottehrer, Craig Leon and Alan Betrock. Previous singles ‘X Offender’ and ‘In The Flesh’ are on this album. Also present is Blondie’s next single, ‘Rip Her To Shreds’ (AUS no. 81). While the previous singles echoed the sounds of yesteryear, ‘Rip Her To Shreds’ is a spiky slice of punk rock/new wave with a sardonic and sneering vocal from Debbie Harry as she verbally attacks some luckless girl: “Won’t you look at that hair!…Check out those shoes!…She’s so dull…” It’s impossible to take seriously, so the effect is humorous rather than nasty. Overall, ‘Blondie’ has a ‘whiff of nostalgia’ and ‘harks back to the girl group sound.’\n\nOn 4 July 1977 bassist Gary Valentine leaves Blondie. He goes on to form his own band, The Know. This group exists from 1978 to around 1980. Much later, in 1996 Gary Valentine moves to London, England. Reverting to his birth name of Gary Lachman, he becomes a full-time writer. Gary Lachman is perhaps best known for writing about the occult, his work being published in ‘The Fortean Times.’\n\nIn August 1977 Frank Infante replaces Gary Valentine as Blondie’s bassist. Actually it’s a little more complicated than that as will be seen and Infante will not remain on bass but this too will be detailed further at a later stage.\n\nFrank Infante is born on 15 November 1951 in New York. He begins his career in music playing guitar with ‘heavy electric blues groups’ such as The Elegant End and World War III. In 1972-1974 Frank Infante is part of the ‘glam punk band’ Sniper. The other members are: Jeff Starship (vocals), Danny Wray (guitar), Bob Butani (guitar), Peter (Morgan) Morales (bass) and Patrick Franklyn (drums). Jeff Starship is a pseudonym for Jeffrey Hyman who, under another pseudonym – Joey Ramone – goes on to front The Ramones, perhaps New York’s most famous punk rock band.\n\nOn 1 September 1977 Blondie sign a recording contract with Chrysalis Records. Chrysalis is a much bigger organisation than Private Stock, Blondie’s previous label. The debut album, ‘Blondie’, is rereleased by Chrysalis.\n\nBlondie tour Australia in December 1977. Vocalist Debbie Harry notes that, “Australia had the best smack [i.e. heroin] in the world!”\n\nBlondie’s second album, ‘Plastic Letters’ (1978) (US no. 72, UK no. 10, AUS no. 64), is released in February. This is the group’s first work for Chrysalis who will issue all of Blondie’s albums up to and including 1982. ‘Plastic Letters’ is produced by Richard Gottehrer. Blondie’s newest member, Frank Infante, is not shown with the band in the cover photo. He plays bass on only some of the tracks on this album; the balance feature guitarist Chris Stein pulling double duty as bassist as well as guitarist. The simplest explanation for these curiosities is that ‘Plastic Letters’ was partially completed before Frank Infante joined the band. The first single is a cover version of ‘Denise’, a 1963 hit for Randy And The Rainbows. Blondie’s version is given a sex-change to better suit a female vocalist and titled ‘Denis’ (UK no. 2, AUS no. 12). ‘Denis’ is pronounced ‘De-NEE’ and is the French version of Dennis. So it is only fitting that vocalist Debbie Harry lapses into French part way through the song – though she does not speak French and is only following phonetic guidance. It is Debbie’s idea to record the song, though the rest of Blondie require some convincing. Debbie says, “Look, if we do an oldie right, the American DJs [disc jockeys] will play it, and I think we could have a hit.” Well, she’s half right. ‘Denis’ is a big hit…in the U.K. “I wasn’t even thinking of foreign countries,” Debbie insists. “I just wanted to break in the States.” It is Blondie’s first big U.K. success but that country frequently supports the group from this point, irrespective of America’s reaction. “It was absolutely thrilling,” Debbie says of the U.K. response. The other standout from ‘Plastic Letters’ is Gary Valentine’s ‘(I’m Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear’ (UK no. 10). The bassist may be gone, but his song about “levitating lovers” with an “extra sense” who use the “psychic frequencies” maintains an appropriately supernatural contact. Valentine wrote the song for Lisa Jane Persky, his girlfriend at the time. ‘Denis’ and ‘(I’m Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear’ are still essentially girl group songs with a new wave patina. ‘Plastic Letters’ is considered ‘darker’ than ‘Blondie’.\n\nBlondie expands to a six-piece band in 1978 with the addition of bassist Nigel Harrison. This allows Frank Infante to shift to guitar so Blondie has two guitarists: Frank Infante and Chris Stein.\n\nNigel Harrison is born on 24 April 1951 in Stockport, Cheshire, England – making him the only British-born member of the American group Blondie. Nigel Harrison starts his music career in the early 1970s in a band called Farm. He then moves on to Silverhead (1972-1974). Harrison was playing in a band called Nite City immediately before joining Blondie.\n\nThe definitive Blondie line-up is now assembled in 1978: Debbie Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Frank Infante (guitar), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), Nigel Harrison (bass) and Clem Burke (drums).\n\nBlondie’s third album, ‘Parallel Lines’ (1978) (US no. 6, UK no. 1, AUS no. 2), is their finest work. Released in September, this is the first of four consecutive Blondie albums produced by Mike Chapman. The album title comes from a poem (or the start of a lyric) written by vocalist Debbie Harry and placed with the rest of the album’s lyrics – though there is no song called ‘Parallel Lines’ on the album. Although there are still traces of the swooning girly songs evoking the past, Blondie’s third album is more aggressively new wave and adds more colours to the group’s musical palette. At first, ‘Parallel Lines’ follows the pattern of Blondie having hits in the U.K. that go unappreciated in their homeland. The masterful ‘Picture This’ (UK no. 12, AUS no. 88) navigates a path between a seductive gentleness and a shouted assertiveness. Keyboardist Jimmy Destri shares songwriting credit on ‘Picture This’ with vocalist Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein. The hammering ‘Hanging On The Telephone’ (UK no. 5, AUS no. 39) is a cover version of a 1976 song by Los Angeles power pop trio The Nerves. Also present is a fairly faithful rendition of Buddy Holly’s 1957 song ‘I’m Gonna Love You Too’. But it is the disco hybrid ‘Heart Of Glass’ (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 1) that really marks a breakthrough for Blondie. It starts out as a blues song that is in their set for years. The tune takes on a different style as explained by its new working title, ‘The Disco Song’. Chris Stein explains, “[It] was kind of like ‘Rock The Boat Baby’ [‘Rock The Boat’, a 1974 hit for The Hues Corporation, is ‘an early example of what will later be called disco’]. It went through a few transformations. We thought we sounded like Kraftwerk [a German act known for their robotic synthesiser sound].” Drummer Clem Burke admits, “I was trying to get that groove that the drummer for [disco act] The Bee Gees had.” In any case, ‘Heart Of Glass’ works very well. It tops the U.K. singles chart on 10 February 1979 and 24 February 1979 to 2 March 1979 and goes on to top the U.S. singles chart as well on 28 April 1979. There are some cries of ‘sell-out’ from disgruntled new wave fans but generally Blondie’s balancing act of musical genres is well accepted. ‘Sunday Girl’ (UK no. 1, AUS no. 1) also tops the U.K. chart on 2 June 1979 – but is overlooked in the U.S. Written by Chris Stein alone, ‘Sunday Girl’ is allegedly a ‘paean to Debbie’s pet pussycat.’ It may well be the group’s single finest moment. Though ‘Heart Of Glass’ is more commercially successful, ‘Sunday Girl’ is more representative, showcasing all that is best about Blondie’s blend of art, style and nous. ‘One Way Or Another’ (US no. 24, UK no. 98), co-written by Debbie Harry and bassist Nigel Harrison, is a stalker anthem given a reversal in the tail. Other noteworthy tracks on ‘Parallel Lines’ include Chris Stein’s meditative ‘Fade Away And Radiate’, Frank Infante’s rough and ready ‘I Know But I Don’t Know’ and Debbie Harry’s dismissive closing track, ‘Just Go Away’. ‘Parallel Lines’ is described as ‘a perfect synthesis of raw punk edge, 1960s pop smarts and the cool new wave glamour Blondie invented.’\n\nIn the wake of ‘Parallel Lines’, Blondie is arguably ‘the biggest pop band on the planet.’ Success brings its own challenges. The media attention lavished upon lead singer Debbie Harry creates some tension within the band. In 1979 members of Blondie take to wearing buttons bearing the slogan ‘Blondie is a group.’\n\n‘Eat To The Beat’ (1979) (US no. 17, UK no. 1, AUS no. 9) is issued in October. The crashing power pop chords and drum rolls of ‘Dreaming’ (US no. 27, UK no. 2, AUS no. 53) launch the album and Ellie Greenwich provides backing vocals on the song. ‘Union City Blues’ (UK no. 13) with its ringing endorsement of “Power…Passion” is co-written by vocalist Debbie Harry and bassist Nigel Harrison. In ‘The Hardest Part’ (US no. 84), a squawking guitar riff and percolating rhythm section underlie a tribute to the “Big men of steel behind the steering wheel” of an armoured car. With its pulsating groove, ‘Atomic’ (US no. 34, UK no. 1, AUS no. 12) is the most obvious heir to ‘Heart Of Glass’. Co-written by Debbie Harry and Blondie’s keyboards player Jimmy Destri, it dutifully tops the U.K. charts from 1 March 1980 to 15 March 1980. The actual subject of ‘Atomic’ is a bit difficult to pin down. Is it nuclear paranoia? Something is definitely getting blown up, but…what? “Oh, your hair is beautiful tonight,” rhapsodises Debbie Harry with Ellie Greenwich again lending vocal support. ‘Eat To The Beat’ is an album of great stylistic variety. Chris Stein’s ‘Shayla’ is dreamy. ‘Slow Motion’, co-written by Jimmy Destri and Laura Davis, is perfect pop with background vocals by Lorna Luft, the daughter of Hollywood movie legend Judy Garland. Lorna Luft also lends her talents to ‘Accidents Never Happen’, a Jimmy Destri song with a new wave sheen. The title track, ‘Eat To The Beat’, is a slavering frenzy composed by Debbie Harry and Nigel Harrison. ‘Die Young, Stay Pretty’ toys with reggae. The flat-out closing track ‘Living In The Real World’ is written by Jimmy Destri and has his sister, Donna Destri, on backing vocals.\n\nBlondie score another transatlantic no. 1 single with ‘Call Me’ (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 2) from the soundtrack of the movie ‘American Gigolo’ (1980). Italian disco producer Giorgio Moroder is tasked with composing the theme. Originally, he wanted Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac to sing the piece but, instead, Debbie Harry co-writes with Moroder and Blondie (the band) delivers a more muscular, guitar-driven sound than may have been expected, though of course it also reflects the disco experiments of both Moroder and Blondie. ‘Call Me’ tops the U.K. singles chart from 19 April 1980 to 26 April 1980 and the U.S. singles chart from 19 April 1980 to 24 May 1980.\n\nBlondie contribute to another movie soundtrack in 1980. ‘Roadie’ (1980), released to cinemas on 13 June, includes Blondie’s cover version of Johnny Cash’s 1963 song, ‘Ring Of Fire’.\n\n‘Autoamerican’ (1980) (US no. 7, UK no. 3, AUS no. 8), the fifth album by Blondie, is issued in November. “I think it’s a Blondie tradition that all our albums sort of have a wide spread of styles,” observes vocalist Debbie Harry. The coconut-sweet sort-of-reggae song ‘The Tide Is High’ (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 4) is a cover version of the 1967 rocksteady piece by The Paragons, a Jamaican male vocal group. ‘The Tide Is High’ tops the U.K. singles chart from 22 November 1980 to 29 November 1980 and the U.S. singles chart on 31 January 1981. Although Blondie’s crossover disco hit ‘Heart Of Glass’ is justly acknowledged as pioneering, perhaps an even greater achievement is ‘Rapture’ (US no. 1, UK no. 5, AUS no. 5), the first rap hit by a white recording act. Over a hypnotic beat, Debbie Harry sings most of the song in an ethereal helium squeak but drops to her natural ‘Noo Yawk’ accent for a bizarre rap about a “Man from Mars who eats guitars.” ‘Rapture’ reverses the usual pattern of Blondie’s commercial fortunes by topping the U.S. chart from 28 March 1981 to 4 April 1981 and being less successful in the U.K. Debbie Harry muses over Blondie’s career and decides that, “The one that stands out for me on many levels is ‘Rapture’. I think that…was a real breakthrough, musically…the first rap song that has its own music [rather than scratching or sampling older music].” On ‘Autoamerican’, Blondie ‘leave their progressive pop sound behind’ but they ‘introduce different ethnic musical styles to the largely white, hard rock’ audience. However, on this album ‘the band’s eclectic style reflects a diminished participation by its members.’\n\nEvidence of this ‘diminished participation’ surfaces when guitarist Frank Infante sues Blondie, charging that he isn’t being used on their records. Infante’s claim is quietly settled and he remains a member of the band.\n\nA potentially more telling blow to Blondie’s future emerges on 12 February 1981 when vocalist Debbie Harry announces she will be making a solo album. To many, Debbie Harry and Blondie are synonymous. If she has success as a solo artist, then is there any future for Blondie as a group?\n\n‘Koo Koo’ (1981) (US no. 25, UK no. 6, AUS no. 16), released in July, is the Debbie Harry solo album. She distances herself from Blondie in two ways. The cover photo shows the singer with her own naturally dark hair; she is not a blonde. Additionally, as a solo act, a lot of Debbie Harry’s material is written for her by other songwriters. In this case, ‘Koo Koo’ is produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers of disco act Chic. They also write the disc’s biggest singles, ‘Backfired’ (US no. 43, UK no. 32, AUS no. 23) and ‘The Jam Was Moving’ (US no. 82).\n\nWith the group dormant, Chrysalis issues the compilation album ‘The Best Of Blondie’ (1981) (US no. 30, UK no. 4, AUS no. 1) in October.\n\nBlondie’s keyboards player Jimmy Destri issues a solo album, ‘Heart On A Wall’ (1981).\n\nBlondie reconvenes for ‘The Hunter’ (1982) (US no. 33, UK no. 9, AUS no. 15) in May. Rather than subject her locks to another dose of peroxide, Debbie Harry wears platinum-coloured wigs in the publicity shots for this disc. ‘Island Of Lost Souls’ (US no. 37, UK no. 11, AUS no. 13) offers ‘catchy calypso charm’ but, although this is an original, it seems very much in the mould of the earlier ‘The Tide Is High’. ‘War Child’ (UK no. 39, AUS no. 96), co-written by vocalist Debbie Harry and bassist Nigel Harrison, is awash in rippling synthesisers. A cover version of Smokey Robinson’s 1966 song ‘The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game’ (first recorded in 1966 by Robinson’s group, The Miracles) gives this album its name. ‘The Hunter’ is ‘a commercial disappointment’ and ‘relatively unsuccessful.’\n\n‘There is a feeling that things have run their course, not to mention internal conflicts and health problems, and Blondie disbands at the end of a North American tour.’ The break-up of Blondie is publicly announced in November 1982.\n\nIn 1983 guitarist Chris Stein is diagnosed with Pemphigus Vulgaris – a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucus membranes. Due to her lover’s illness, vocalist Debbie Harry ‘takes a few years off to care for him.’ When asked if this was difficult for her, Harry responds, “Difficult for me? Much more difficult for him, obviously. People say that I nursed him, but I was his mate, you know, and went to the hospital and stayed with him, but he was under very professional care.” During this time, some rather unflattering pictures of Debbie Harry appear in the media showing her blonde once more but not looking at her best and having gained weight. “Being five foot four, it’s important to keep a proportion, because I can get very round very quickly,” she admits.\n\nDuring Chris Stein’s illness, Debbie Harry performs the song ‘Rush Rush’ (US no. 105, UK no. 87, AUS no. 25) for the soundtrack of the movie ‘Scarface’ (1983). ‘Rush Rush’ is co-written by Debbie Harry and Giorgio Moroder.\n\nDebbie Harry’s second solo album, ‘Rockbird’ (1986) (US no. 97, UK no. 31, AUS no. 18), is released in November. This album includes ‘French Kissin’ In The U.S.A.’ (US no. 57, UK no. 8, AUS no. 4) (written by Chuck Lorre), ‘In Love With Love’ (US no. 70) (written by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein) and ‘Free To Fall’ (written by Debbie Harry and Seth Justman).\n\n‘Once More Into The Bleach’ (1988) (UK no. 50, AUS no. 47) is credited to Debbie Harry and Blondie. It is an album of remixes of old songs. ‘Denis (remix)’ (UK no. 50) and ‘Call Me (remix)’ (UK no. 61) from this disc are minor showings in the U.K. singles chart.\n\n‘Def, Dumb & Blonde’ (1989) (US no. 123, UK no. 12, AUS no. 10) is credited to Deborah Harry. It is the first of her solo works to use the full name of Deborah instead of Debbie. All will subsequently use the full name. The most successful song from this album is ‘I Want That Man’ (UK no. 13, AUS no. 2), a track penned by Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie, two members of the U.K. pop group The Thompson Twins. This disc also yields ‘Brite Side’ (UK no. 59) (written by Deborah Harry and Chris Stein), ‘Sweet And Low’ (UK no. 57, AUS no. 30) (written by Toni C. [Antoinette Colandero] and Deborah Harry) and ‘Maybe For Sure’ (UK no. 89, AUS no. 151) (written by Deborah Harry and Chris Stein).\n\nChris Stein and Debbie Harry break-up as a couple in 1989 but continue to work together in a musical capacity.\n\nThe split with Chris Stein is just part of a larger series of problems for Debbie Harry. She admits that in the late 1980s she was “absolutely” addicted to drugs – including heroin – for “a couple of years.” What was the trigger for this? According to Harry, “It was depression…Our record company dropped us, our manager walked out, the Internal Revenue Service [i.e. the U.S. tax office] walked in. Everything fell apart and I fell apart along with it. But ice cream was great.” Stein and Harry both do a stint in a rehab facility to get past their drug problems.\n\n‘The Complete Picture: The Very Best Of Deborah Harry And Blondie’ (1991) (UK no. 3, AUS no. 6) is released in March. Also in 1991 is ‘Well Did You Evah!’ (UK no. 42, AUS no. 106), a duet between Deborah Harry and proto punk legend Iggy Pop for the AIDS benefit album ‘Red Hot + Blue’ (1991).\n\nDeborah Harry’s fourth solo album is ‘Debravation’ (1993) (UK no. 24). This disc features ‘I Can See Clearly’ (UK no. 23), a song written by Arthur Baker and Tony McIlwane.\n\n‘Beautiful: The Remix Album’ (1995) (UK no. 25) again reworks Blondie’s past. Like its remix predecessor, this set also results in some U.K. chart placings for ‘Atomic (remix)’ (UK no. 19), ‘Heart Of Glass (remix)’ (UK no. 15) and ‘Union City Blue (remix)’ (UK no. 31).\n\nIn 1995 Deborah Harry plays some shows with The Jazz Passengers.\n\nIn 1995-1996 Deborah Harry is romantically linked to magician and comedian Penn Jillette.\n\nIn 1997 Deborah Harry and Chris Stein bring Blondie back together again. But before going into that, let’s look at what the other members of Blondie have been doing since the band broke up in 1982.\n\nDrummer Clem Burke works with a band called Checkered Past (1982-1984). Another member of this outfit is ex-Blondie bassist Nigel Harrison. The band records one album, ‘Checkered Past’ (1984). Clem Burke keeps busy working with The Romantics, Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Dramarama, The Fleshtones, Iggy Pop and Joan Jett. He is probably best known for a mid-1980s stint with The Eurythmics and a couple of shows in 1987 with The Ramones (under the alias of Elvis Ramone).\n\nKeyboardist Jimmy Destri does something different after Blondie’s 1982 break-up. He starts a company that buys old buildings, renovates the premises, and then sells the buildings to new owners.\n\nGuitarist Frank Infante works with Joan Jett, Stiv Bators, Sylvain Sylvain, Iggy Pop and The Divinyls.\n\nBassist Nigel Harrison plays in Checkered Past with Clem Burke as recounted above.\n\nBlondie reunites in 1997 as a five-piece band with a line-up of: Deborah Harry (vocals), Chris Stein (guitar), Jimmy Destri (keyboards), Gary Valentine (bass) and Clem Burke (drums). The reunited band plays their first gig on 31 May 1997. A live album, ‘Picture This’ (1997), is released by EMI/Capitol in October.\n\nEx-Blondie members Frank Infante and Nigel Harrison bring a lawsuit against Blondie because of their exclusion from the reunion – but they are unsuccessful.\n\nFrank Infante goes on to work with The New York Dolls in 2010. He also forms his own trio, Infante’s Inferno, with Steve Fishman (bass) and Clem Burke (drums) – the latter moonlighting from Blondie.\n\nNigel Harrison forms an ‘experimental power pop group’ called The Grabs. They release the album ‘Sex, Fashion And Money’ (2005).\n\nGary Valentine (a.k.a. Gary Lachman) takes part in the 1997 Blondie reunion – but doesn’t remain with Blondie. Instead, in 1998 he forms a group called Fire Escape with Ruth Jones (violin). They record one EP which is issued ‘with little fanfare.’ Gary Lachman resumes his literary career.\n\nThe four veteran members of Blondie – Deborah Harry, Chris Stein, Jimmy Destri and Clem Burke – are supplemented in 1997 by Paul Carbonara (guitar) and Leigh Fox (bass).\n\n‘Atomic: The Very Best Of Blondie’ (1998) (UK no. 12) is issued by Chrysalis/EMI to capitalise on the renewed interest in Blondie.\n\n‘No Exit’ (1999) (US no. 18, UK no. 3, AUS no. 72), issued on the Beyond label in February, is the first Blondie album of new material in nearly seventeen years. ‘No Exit’ is produced by Craig Leon. The best moments on the album are two songs written by keyboardist Jimmy Destri. The ‘infectious’ ‘Maria’ (US no. 82, UK no. 1, AUS no. 2) is another U.K. chart topper. ‘Nothing Is Real But The Girl’ (UK no. 26) is a new wave throwback – and the last Blondie single to chart. Rapper Coolio is featured on the title track, ‘No Exit’, and is co-credited with the song’s authorship alongside Deborah Harry, Jimmy Destri, Chris Stein and Romy Ashby.\n\nAnother concert recording is issued, this one on the Beyond label in November: ‘Live’ (US) / ‘Livid’ (UK) (1999).\n\nIn 1999 guitarist Chris Stein marries actress Barbara Sicuranza. Chris and Barbara have two daughters, Akira and Valentina.\n\nSometime around 2000 it seems that Blondie’s keyboardist Jimmy Destri marries. His wife is named Roberta. They have three children: a son named James (born 2001) and daughters named Rienna (born 2009) and Eileen.\n\nBlondie’s drummer, Clem Burke, marries in 2002. His wife, Ellen, is a paediatric nurse.\n\nEMI/Capitol issue a ‘Greatest Hits’ (2002) (UK no. 38) album by Blondie in September.\n\n‘The Curse Of Blondie’ (2003) (US no. 160, UK no. 36, AUS no. 83) is released in October by Sanctuary (US) and Epic (UK). The disc is produced by Steve Thompson. The best known song from this set is probably ‘Good Boys’ which vocalist Deborah Harry co-writes with Kevin Griffin of U.S. alt-rock act Better Than Ezra.\n\nBlondie’s line-up is further augmented in 2003 with Jimi K. Bones (guitar) and Kevin Patrick (a.k.a. Kevin Topping) (keyboards). Bones only plays with Blondie in 2003, leaving thereafter.\n\nIn 2004 keyboardist Jimmy Destri leaves Blondie ‘to deal with [his] drug addiction.’ Despite a successful stint in rehab, Destri is not invited to return to Blondie. In December 2010 Destri works as a full-time drug counsellor/therapist at the outpatient recovery centre of the Carnegie Hill Institute of New York City. In 2012 he starts his own band, Jimmy Destri And The Sound Grenade.\n\n‘Live By Request’ (2004) is a Blondie concert album issued by Sanctuary. ‘Greatest Hits: Sight And Sound’ (2005) (UK no. 48) is put out by EMI/Capitol.\n\nDeborah Harry takes time out for a new solo album, ‘Necessary Evil’ (2007) (UK no. 86).\n\nKeyboardist Kevin Patrick (a.k.a. Kevin Topping) drops out of Blondie in 2007. He is replaced in 2008 by Matt Katz-Bohen (keyboards).\n\n‘At The BBC’ (2010) is a set of live Blondie performances prepared for radio broadcast. Chrysalis issues this disc.\n\nGuitarist Paul Carbonara leaves Blondie in 2010. His role is filled the same year by Tommy Kessler (guitar).\n\n‘Panic Of Girls’ (2011) (UK no. 73) is a new Blondie album released on the Five Seven label. The disc is produced by Jeff Saltzman. The three remaining members of Blondie – Deborah Harry, Chris Stein and Clem Burke – are aided on this disc by Tommy Kessler (guitar), Matt Katz-Bohen (keyboards) and Leigh Fox (bass) (ex-guitarist Paul Carbonara played on some tracks before his departure). The album generates no hit singles but a couple of the better known tracks are ‘Mother’ and ‘What I Heard’. ‘Mother’ is co-written by Deborah Harry, Kato Khandwala and Ben Phillips (Khandwala produces this track). ‘What I Heard’ is co-written by keyboardist Matt Katz-Bohen and his wife, Laurel Katz-Bohen (nee Barclay).\n\nIn April 2014 Deborah Harry reveals that she is bisexual, but does not name any of her female lovers. In another interview, she says, “I have had my sexual relationships with women, yes…I am probably more heterosexual than I am homosexual, or even bisexual.”\n\n‘Ghosts Of Download (Blondie 4(0) Ever)’ (2014) (US no. 109, UK no. 16, AUS no. 72) is released in May on Five Seven. This is a two disc set. The first disc is ‘Greatest Hits Redux’ with new recordings of past hits. The second disc, ‘Ghosts Of Download’, is all-new material. Production credits are shared amongst Matt Katz-Bohen, Kato Khandwala, Craig Leon, Jeff Saltzman and Chris Stein. ‘A Rose By Any Other Name’ (written by Matt and Laurel Katz-Bohen) is a duet with Beth Ditto of Gossip. ‘Sugar On The Side’ is a reggae song featuring Systema Solar. It is written by Chris Stein, Jeff Saltzman, Natalie Hawkins and Systema Solar. ‘I Want To Drag You Around’ is written by Matthew Barus.\n\nSince Blondie’s 1977 reunion, drummer Clem Burke has kept busy with a number of additional projects. He is a member of the following groups: Infante’s Inferno; Slinky Vagabond (2007); The International Swingers (December 2011); and The Empty Hearts (2014). Burke also works with: Wanda Jackson; The Ramones – for a second time (2004); Nancy Sinatra (2004-2005); Kathy Valentine from The Go-Go’s (no relation to ex-Blondie guitarist Gary Valentine) (2005); The Magic Christian; The Hugh Cornwell Band – the group led by the ex-frontman of U.K. punk band The Stranglers; The Split Squad; and Little Steven.\n\n‘Pollinator’ (2017) (US no. 63, UK no. 4, AUS no. 29), released on 5 May, is a new Blondie album produced by John Congleton. This disc has a ‘more band-oriented sound’ rather than ‘electronic music.’ Many of the tracks here are written (or co-written) by musicians who were inspired by Blondie back in the heyday of the group. None of the singles lifted from this set reach the charts. ‘Fun’ is co-written by Dave Sitek (of TV On The Radio) along with Adam Feiress, Daniel Ledinsky and Eric Hassle. This is rock music enhanced with squiggly dance traits. Are Deborah Harry’s vocals on this track auto-tuned? ‘Long Time’ is penned by black U.K. singer Dev Hynes (a.k.a. Lightspeed Champion a.k.a. Blood Orange). ‘Too Much’ is written by Blondie’s keyboardist Matt Katz-Bohen and his wife, Laurel. ‘Doom Or Destiny’ (written by Deborah Harry and Chris Stein) adds Joan Jett vocals to the chorus and is ‘good, new wave punk.’ Other songwriting contributors include Johnny Marr (The Smiths) on ‘My Monster’ and Nick Valensi (The Strokes) and Sia on ‘Best Day Ever’.\n\n‘Face It: A Memoir’ (2019) is an autobiography by Debbie Harry, based on interviews she grants to Sylvie Simmons. The book is published by HarperCollins on 1 October.\n\nBlondie’s ‘Heart Of Glass’ bridged the vast gulf between new wave and disco. Other Blondie recordings successfully absorbed such genres as reggae (‘The Tide Is High’) and rap (‘Rapture’). This ability to assimilate other styles is perhaps not so surprising when it is remembered that, at first, Blondie specialised in creating songs such as ‘In The Flesh’ that were pastiches of girl group records of the early 1960s. Yet, Blondie were more than just mimics. Their native punk/new wave approach underlay and informed much of their best work (1976-1982). Moreover, the artistic sensibilities of Debbie Harry, Chris Stein and their comrades made this sonic patchwork cohesive. Perhaps Stein put it best when he wittily observed, “We’re a pop art band, not a pop band.” ‘Blondie was rightly acclaimed as one of the most influential bands of their generation.’ They were ‘the most commercially successful band to emerge from the New York punk/new wave community of the late 1970s.’\n\nSources:\n\n‘Friday On My Mind’ by Ed Nimmervoll (Five Mile Press, 2004) p. 114, 115, 120\n\nwikipedia.org as at 9 March 2016, 2 January 2018\n\nInternet Movie Database – imdb.com – as at 11 March 2016\n\n‘Saga Magazine’ (U.K. magazine) – ‘Blondie Bombshell: Debbie Harry Interview’ by Nina Myskow (23 April 2014) (reproduced on saga.co.uk)\n\n‘The Guardian’ (U.K. newspaper) – ‘Don’t Call Me Debbie’ by Sean O’Hagan (12 May 2002) (reproduced on theguardian.com)\n\nbrainyquote.com as at 10 March 2016\n\n‘The Illustrated Rock Handbook’ edited by Roxanne Streeter, Ray Bonds (Salamander Books, 1983) p. 25, 26, 27\n\n‘The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll’, ‘The Sound of New York City’ by John Rockwell (Plexus Publishing Limited,1992) p.554\n\n‘The One Show’ (U.K. television program, BBC Network) – Deborah Harry and Chris Stein interview conducted by Matt Baker and Alex Jones (June 2013)\n\ninterviewmagazine.com ‘Debbie Harry’ by Rick Moody (17 March 2014)\n\nbing.com as at 12 March 2016\n\n‘The Rolling Stone Rock Almanac’ by the Editors of ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine (Papermac, 1984) p. 12, 229, 272, 274, 295, 296, 297, 310, 311, 312, 313, 318, 322, 323, 324, 325\n\n‘Greatest Hits’ – Sleeve notes by Steve Pafford (Chrysalis Records, 2002) p. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n\n‘The History of Rock’ by Mark Paytress (Parragon Books, 2011) p. 193\n\n‘People’ (Australian magazine) – ‘Brazen Blondie Bungie’ – no author credited (8 May 1990) (reproduced on rip-her-to-shreds.com)\n\n‘The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time’ – ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine (February 2004) p. 52\n\nallmusic.com, ‘Blondie’ by William Ruhlmann as at 10 March 2016\n\ndiscogs.com as at 19 March 2016\n\n‘The Independent’ (U.K. newspaper) – ‘Debbie Harry Admits Drug Addiction’ – no author credited (21 March 2011) (reproduced on independent.co.uk)\n\nNotable Names Database – nndb.com – as at 10 March 2016\n\njimmydestri.com @ 2012\n\n‘Daily Mail’ (U.K. newspaper) – ‘My “Sensual Nights” with Women by Debbie Harry: Blondie Star Reveals she is Bisexual Despite Relationship with Bandmate’ by Chris Hastings via 2 (above)\n\n‘Diva’ magazine interview with Deborah Harry via 20 (above)\n\n‘Herald Sun’ (Melbourne, Australia newspaper) – review of ‘Ghosts Of Download (Blondie 4(0) Ever)’ by Cameron Adams (5 June 2014) p. 44\n\nlyricsfreak.com as at 8 September 2014\n\n‘Herald Sun’ (Melbourne, Australia, newspaper) – Review of ‘Pollinator’ by Cameron Adams (4 May 2017) p. 35\n\namazon.com as at 5 January 2020\n\nSong lyrics copyright Chrysalis Music Group Inc. with the exception of ‘Sunday Girl’ (Chrysalis Music obo Monster Island Music Pub Corp., Chrysalis Music)\n\nLast revised 25 January 2020\n\nThe B-52’s\n\nCindy Wilson – circa 1989\n\n“Everybody goes to parties / They dance this mess around” – ‘Dance This Mess Around’ (The B-52’s)\n\nAIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a frightening disease. It is a degenerative illness that is usually fatal, though in at least some cases its progress can be slowed and the patient’s life extended. Often, it is not AIDS itself that is fatal. As its full name implies, AIDS weakens the body’s immune system. Consequently, another disease – such as cancer or pneumonia – is contracted and it is this secondary infection that leads to death. Though it may not be strictly accurate, AIDS is often associated with homosexuality. Ricky Wilson of The B-52’s dies as a result of AIDS-related illness. He was quiet about his sexuality, but that is one of the few quiet things about The B-52’s.\n\nRicky Helton Wilson (19 March 1953-12 October 1985) is born in Athens, Georgia, U.S.A. His younger sister, Cynthia Leigh Wilson, is born on 28 February 1957. Ricky and Cindy share a birthplace and will both become members of The B-52’s. Ricky and Cindy are the children of Bobby Jack Wilson and his wife Linda J. Wilson (nee Mairholtz). Bobby Wilson is a fireman and a veteran of the U.S. Army. The marriage between Bobby and Linda must have ended sometime during their children’s youth, because there is a reference to Ricky and Cindy having a step-mother who is a factory worker.\n\nRicky Wilson develops an interest in music ‘at an early age.’ He learns to play guitar. Ricky Wilson attends Clarke Central High School in Athens, Georgia. A summer job at the local landfill earns Ricky enough money to buy a two-track tape recorder. This allows him to capture his guitar playing and early attempts at songwriting. ‘The Looking Glass’ is a local ‘head shop’ (i.e. they sell things related to smoking cannabis and various other stuff of interest to their clientele). In mid-1969 Ricky Wilson meets another local youth at ‘The Looking Glass’ who shares his interest in music and Eastern mysticism. This boy’s name is Keith Strickland.\n\nJulian Keith Strickland is born on 26 October 1953 in Athens, Georgia. His father operates the Southeastern Stages bus station in Athens. Keith has a brother. Like Ricky Wilson, Keith Strickland displays an early aptitude for music. Keith’s mother can play piano by ear. When Keith is 5 or 6 years old he begins to pick out tunes in a similar fashion at the family piano. He then moves on to drums, but doesn’t start playing guitar until he is 16 to 18. Keith Strickland attends Clarke Central High School but is in the grade below Ricky Wilson since he is a little younger. One of Keith Strickland’s classmates at Clarke is future Hollywood actress Kim Basinger.\n\nRicky Wilson confesses he is gay to Keith Strickland while both boys are in their teens.\n\nIn mid-1969 Ricky Wilson and Keith Strickland put together an act called Loon. They begin to write songs together and aspire to play live gigs – but that doesn’t happen. Instead, from 1969 to 1971 Ricky Wilson and Keith Strickland play in a band called Black Narcissus (a name that is perhaps inspired by the 1947 movie of the same name?) with their high school friends Pete Love and Owen Scott III.\n\nRicky Wilson graduates from high school in 1971. Keith Strickland graduates from high school in 1972. The two boys wander around Europe for a year before returning home to Athens, Georgia. The duo goes back to Europe for another year before winding up back home again. Ricky and Keith then begin working for Keith’s father at the Southeastern Stages bus station.\n\nAlthough Ricky Wilson, Cindy Wilson and Keith Strickland all come from Athens, Georgia, the other two members of what will become The B-52’s – Fred Schneider and Kate Pierson – are both from New Jersey.\n\nFrederick William Schneider III is born on 1 July 1951 in Newark, New Jersey. Fred grows up with an eclectic bunch of musical influences. He claims his first love was Broadway show tunes. Fred then takes an interest in Halloween songs and Christmas songs. Finally, he moves on to the danceable pop hits coming from the Motown Records stable of recording artists. During his youth, Fred Schneider moves with his family from Newark, New Jersey, to Belleville, New Jersey. But when he considers a college degree, Fred looks further afield. “I was interested in wildlife conservation, and I chose Georgia because they supposedly had a good forestry school.” However that doesn’t work out as well as Fred hopes. “I switched to journalism,” he explains. For his final project, Fred Schneider writes a book of poetry that is published as ‘Bleb’ (1975). Fred Schneider then drops out of school. “I stayed in Athens,” he says, “because I liked the town a lot.” Fred Schneider works as a janitor, acts as a driver for the charity ‘Meals on Wheels’ and gets a job as a waiter at El Dorado, a local vegetarian eatery.\n\nKatherine Elizabeth Pierson is born on 27 April 1948 in Weehawken, New Jersey. This means that Kate Pierson is the eldest of the five future members of The B-52’s. Although born in Weehawken, she is raised in Rutherford, New Jersey. Music is part of the Pierson household. “My father played this beautiful Gretsch guitar,” Kate recalls. “He was in a big band [i.e. a large group, playing the kind of swing music made famous by the likes of Glenn Miller], and then when he got married, he stopped.” Young Kate also shows an aptitude for music. “I played piano. I was in chorus and choir and stuff at school,” she says. At high school, Kate Pierson takes inspiration from folk rock musician Bob Dylan and forms her own folk group. In 1964 she discovers the music of British band The Beatles and moves towards rock music. Kate Pierson forms a band called The Sun Donuts. She then goes on to attend Wheaton College in Massachusetts, transferring to Boston University where Pierson obtains a journalism degree. Like Ricky Wilson and Keith Strickland, Kate Pierson travels around Europe for a time. “I was a barmaid in Newcastle [in England],” she reminisces. When she returns to the U.S.A., Kate Pierson is accompanied by ‘a male friend from Manchester [in England].’ (Note: One account refers to ‘her English husband’ but there is nothing else to suggest the pair wed so it seems more likely that they just lived together in a manner similar to a married couple.) Kate’s companion is unable to find work in Boston because he lacks the proper papers. A friend promises Kate’s partner work in Athens, Georgia, so the couple move south. “I used to live on a mini-farm [in Athens],” Kate says. It’s what she describes as “a hippie, back-to-the-land thing…I kept goats, rode a bike, grew vegetables.” It doesn’t appear to be very lucrative though. To earn a living, Kate Pierson works as a paste-up artist in the type shop of a local newspaper.\n\nAthens, Georgia, is a ‘college town.’ It is home to the University of Georgia. Cindy Wilson claims that, “Athens was great because there were so many influences because of the college that you didn’t get in most Southern towns. It was a great place to grow up and become creative. We had to make our own fun.” Ricky Wilson, Cindy Wilson, Keith Strickland, Fred Schneider and Kate Pierson meet socially. “We were friends, kinda arty bohemian types who just liked to hang out and party together,” says Kate Pierson. “It wasn’t just us,” she adds. “It was Jeremy Ayers and Robert Waldrop and a whole bunch of other people.”\n\nThe idea of forming a band arises on ‘an October night in 1976.’ At a local Chinese restaurant called HuNan, Ricky Wilson, Cindy Wilson, Keith Strickland, Fred Schneider and Kate Pierson share a tropical drink called a ‘flaming volcano.’ A jam session follows. The five of them enjoy themselves and decide to form a band. The line-up is: Fred Schneider (vocals), Cindy Wilson (vocals), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Ricky Wilson (guitar) and Keith Strickland (drums). This is the basic set-up, but many of the group play additional instruments depending on the needs of the song. For instance, Cindy Wilson plays bongoes and guitar and Kate Pierson plays keyboard bass and guitar. Generally, the band gets by without a bass player since Ricky Wilson’s guitar tunings and Kate Pierson’s keyboards cover that end of their sound.\n\nFred Schneider acknowledges the origin of the band’s name: “Keith [Strickland] came up with The B-52’s.” Keith says, “I was having this dream one night. It was about this lounge band that had a woman keyboard player and she introduced the band as The B-52’s. I sprang up out of bed and said, ‘That’s it! The B-52’s!’” It is also the designation for a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the American aircraft the B-52 bomber. Naturally, Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson try to adopt this hairstyle. “When we first started, we had a hairdresser in Athens, Laverne, and she just teased up Cindy’s and my hair so big,” marvels Pierson. As a matter of practicality, the girls often wear wigs.\n\nThe B-52’s play their first gig at a place called Julia’s in Athens on 14 February (Valentine’s Day) 1977. It’s a party for their friends. “There were only seventeen people. We made seventeen bucks,” notes Fred Schneider. It’s a memorable night for Cindy Wilson, the youngest of the group, because she meets her future husband, an art student named Keith Bennett. “He was an artistic weirdo and I related to that right off,” says Cindy.\n\nThe B-52’s ambitions are humble. They just aim ‘to amuse themselves at parties.’ ‘The band members have little or no previous musical experience, and perform most of their earliest shows with taped guitar and percussion accompaniment.’ Cindy Wilson works as a waitress at a local restaurant called Kress: “I had to get a job because it was my job to buy a microphone,” Cindy explains.\n\nIn April 1978, one of The B-52’s earliest original compositions, ‘Rock Lobster’ is released on DB Records. Around the same time the group gets the opportunity to play gigs at New York City venues like CBGBs and Max’s Kansas City. “My parents lent us their station wagon [to get to New York],” points out Ricky Wilson. The group becomes a ‘sensation.’ Gary Kurfirst becomes their manager. In early 1979, a recording contract is signed with Warner Bros. (U.S., Australia) and Island (U.K.).\n\nThe mid-1970s is the time of the punk rock revolution. “We started in the punk era,” agrees Keith Strickland. “But coming from Athens we had absolutely no sense of what punk was [since the U.S. punk scene was mainly in New York and Los Angeles].” The B-52’s is usually considered to be a new wave band, one of a group of acts that don’t ‘sound like punk rock but nevertheless owe their existence to the new punk-inspired aesthetic.’ (i.e. do-it-yourself, non-conformist, back to basics) New wave is quirkier and less aggressive than punk.\n\nThe B-52’s have ‘an outrageous stage image which includes mini-skirts, go-go boots, toy instruments and music that combines high camp with irresistible rhythms.’ “We always dressed like this,” says Kate Pierson. “We always shopped at thrift stores; it was sort of a pastime…It wasn’t a conscious decision to recreate the 1950s or 1960s or anything. It was just for fun.” The sound of The B-52’s is as outrageous as their stage apparel. Most commonly, all three of The B-52’s vocalists chip in on each track. Less frequently, the two girls sing together. In the minority of cases when there is just one singer, it is usually Cindy Wilson. Fred Schneider doesn’t really sing the lyrics so much as intone them. Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson scream, warble and harmonise. “The way Cindy and I do our harmonies is completely unique,” insists Pierson. “It just comes out of a feeling, you know, and we’re just winging it.” Kate Pierson also provides cheesy organ trills. Ricky Wilson employs ‘open tunings’ on his guitar. He removes the two middle strings as he doesn’t have any use for them – though he does sometimes play with five strings rather than four (a standard guitar has six strings). “He really had a vision,” Cindy Wilson says of her brother. “He was one of the strongest elements of The B-52’s from the beginning.” Behind the drum kit, Keith Strickland flails away at a manic pace, trying to follow Ricky Wilson’s eccentric arrangements. Kate Pierson lists among the band’s influences Nino Rota (who wrote the music for Italian director Frederico Fellini’s surrealist films); 1960’s British pop singer Dusty Springfield; Yoko Ono, the avant-garde partner of ex-Beatle John Lennon; and the Godfather of Soul, James Brown. Fred Schneider tries to sum up The B-52’s sound this way: “We just did our own thing, which was a combination of rock ‘n’ roll, funk, and Fellini, and game show host, and corn, and mysticism.” But it is Kate Pierson who probably provides the best definition: “We’re [a] self-proclaimed tacky little dance band from Athens, Georgia. And sometimes America’s greatest party band.”\n\nAlthough The B-52’s record a few cover versions and outside compositions, most of their material is original – and, usually, written by the group as a whole. “We write a communal type of music,” says Kate Pierson. “When we first started writing songs together, we wrote collectively, and we still do. Some songs in the beginning were individually written by Ricky [Wilson] or a collaboration between Ricky and Fred [Schneider]…although we all added our bits.” Keith Strickland claims, “Ricky and I used to write the music together.” Even thematically, The B-52’s are a bit contrary. “It’s all about fun,” yelps Cindy Wilson. In contrast, Kate Pierson despairs of, “Everyone calling us whacky, whacky, whacky and they didn’t understand the incredible seriousness of the band.”\n\nThe debut album, ‘The B-52’s’ (1979) (US no. 59, UK no. 22, AUS no. 7), is released on 6 July on Warner Bros. (U.S., Australia) and Island (U.K.). The disc is produced by Island Records boss Chris Blackwell. It requires careful handling to capture the group’s originality and Blackwell performs the task admirably. ‘Rock Lobster’ (US no. 56, UK no. 37, AUS no. 3) is rerecorded for the album. The song is co-written by vocalist Fred Schneider and guitarist Ricky Wilson. Keyboardist Kate Pierson explains that, “Fred started with the lyrics. He had gone to this disco…I think it was called the 2001 Disco, and he saw these crustaceans that were projected onto the wall, saw a rock lobster, and…I guess he wrote some lines about it,” she concludes, breaking into laughter. Keith Strickland, the band’s drummer, remembers that Ricky Wilson asked him if he would like to hear “the stupidest guitar line ever.” It is, of course, the riff that becomes ‘Rock Lobster’ and Keith is quick to encourage his colleague. Ricky’s guitar part seems to borrow from the rumbling guitar of the ‘James Bond’ movie theme and Duane Eddy’s playing on the theme for the 1958-1961 television detective show ‘Peter Gunn’. Lyrically, ‘Rock Lobster’ seems to be the soundtrack to a mutant offspring of a Ray Harryhausen stop-motion monster movie and one of Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon’s ‘Beach Blanket Bingo’ films. Schneider casts an eye over, “Boy’s in bikinis / Girls in surfboards,” and urges, “Pass the tanning butter.” Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson provide a bizarre series of shrieks and ululations to accompany each example of sea life Fred itemises. “HERE COMES A BIKINI WHALE!” cries Fred at the climax as Cindy unleashes her best horror movie starlet scream. ‘Rock Lobster’ has a polarising effect. Those who like it think it is utterly brilliant; those who dislike it find it so bizarre, it’s offensive. Perhaps due to the element of surprise, this mini-epic of madness remains the finest song in the repertoire of The B-52’s. It becomes a freakish hit in Australia. Other highlights on the album include ‘Planet Claire’ (AUS no. 43) and ‘There’s A Moon In The Sky (Called The Moon)’, pieces that sound like they belong to some long forgotten sci-fi B-movie. ‘Planet Claire’ is co-written by Fred Schneider and Keith Strickland. “Some say she’s from Mars / Or one of the seven stars / That shine after 3.30 in the morning,” Schneider sings/says before hollering at the top of his voice, “WELL SHE ISN’T,” and adding ominously, “She came from Planet Claire.” ‘There’s A Moon In The Sky (Called The Moon) is one of three songs on the album credited to The B-52’s collectively as authors. The others are ‘Dance This Mess Around’ and ‘Lava’. ‘Dance This Mess Around’ is a spotlight for Cindy Wilson where she howls with unaccountable anguish, “Why don’t you dance with me / I’m not no Limburger (i.e. a particularly smelly type of cheese).” ‘Lava’ is a lusty tribute to human geology: “My love’s eruptin’ like a red hot volcano.” Ricky Wilson co-writes two tracks with acquaintances from the group’s social clique in Athens. Jeremy Ayers co-writes ’52 Girls’, a recitation of cool chicks from the 1960s (plus “Kate and Cindy”!). Robert Waldrop is co-author of ‘Hero Worship’, a lovelorn dedication to a dreamboat. The B-52’s (minus Cindy Wilson) write ‘6060-842’, the title being a number to dial for “a very nice time.” Rounding out the album is a cover version of ‘Downtown’, British pop singer Petula Clarke’s song from 1964. Although the general public is unprepared for this concoction, ‘The B-52’s’ is the group’s finest album, ‘a collection of manic, bizarre and eminently danceable songs.’ “We never thought it would get past our circle of friends in Athens,” says Fred Schneider modestly.\n\nIn the wake of the release of ‘The B-52’s’, the group tours through summer 1979 at gigs ranging from New York’s Central Park to Australia. “It was so glamorous coming into Australia…We were just like stars,” recalls vocalist Cindy Wilson. The B-52’s appear on ‘Countdown’, the pop television show of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “I think we broke in England and Australia before we broke in America,” Cindy adds.\n\nThe B-52’s’ second album, ‘Wild Planet’ (1980) (US no. 18, UK no. 18, AUS no. 12), is released on 27 August and the rest of the world begins to catch up on the band’s style. More people are getting the joke. ‘Wild Planet’ is co-produced by Rhett Davies, The B-52’s and Chris Blackwell. The album is spearheaded by the infectious jive of ‘Private Idaho’ (US no. 74, AUS no. 11), a group composition. Director Gus Van Sant is inspired to borrow the song’s title for the movie ‘My Own Private Idaho’ (1991). ‘Give Me Back My Man’ (UK no. 61), written by The B-52’s sans Kate Pierson, is a song that showcases vocalist Cindy Wilson. “I’ll give you fish, I’ll give you candy,” she promises in a winningly mixed-up manner. Her strident demand is backed by odd, boxy percussion in this relatively spare arrangement. ‘Party Out Of Bounds’ is about a “Surpriiise paaarty” that gets out of control – but “Who’s to blame?” It’s an eccentric good time piece written by the whole band. Five of the nine tracks on ‘Wild Planet’ were written before the group’s debut album was recorded, so it is perhaps understandable that ‘Wild Planet’ shows ‘little musical progress.’\n\nThe B-52’s perform ‘Rock Lobster’ in Paul Simon’s movie ‘One-Trick Pony’ (1980) released on 3 October. A sensitive folky singer-songwriter like Simon seems an odd companion for The B-52’s, but the group attracts a wide variety of fans.\n\n‘Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson’s vocal acrobatics…recall the earlier work of Yoko Ono.’ Ex-Beatle John Lennon seems to realise this too and it serves to inspire him to come out of his self-imposed early retirement and release ‘Double Fantasy’ (1980) in November, an album shared equally between his songs and those of his wife, Yoko Ono.\n\nFrom 1981 until at least 1983, the five members of The B-52’s all live together in the same house.\n\nThe EP ‘Party Mix’ (US no. 55, UK no. 36, AUS no. 80), released in July 1981, contains only remixes from the first two albums by The B-52’s. That is, the contents are earlier songs they have released given new arrangements or reworkings.\n\nThe B-52’s begin work on new recordings with David Byrne. The leader of New York new wave band Talking Heads seems like a good choice to act as producer. However ‘conflicts between the band and Byrne’ result in a halt being called to the work. The resultant ‘Mesopotamia’ (US no. 35, UK no. 18, AUS no. 79) is released as a ‘mini-album’ on 27 January 1982. Some consider ‘Mesopotamia’ to be an EP, but with six tracks and a running time of around thirty minutes, the ‘mini-album’ designation seems more fitting. The title track, ‘Mesopotamia’, is funky and, predictably, sounds a bit like the Afro-funk experiments of Talking Heads. Written by the group as a whole, the song ‘Mesopotamia’ toys with “ancient culture” from “six or eight thousand years ago” and offers to “meet you by the third pyramid.” Both ‘Loveland’ and ‘Nip It In The Bud’ feature vocalist Cindy Wilson. On ‘Mesopotamia’, The B-52’s ‘largely abandon their trademark sense of humour.’\n\n‘Whammy’ (1983) (US no. 29, UK no. 33, AUS no. 97), released in April, marks ‘a move into electronic territory.’ Steven Stanley produces this disc. Synthesisers and drum machines figure in the sound of the album. “At this point, Keith [Strickland] didn’t want to play drums anymore,” explains keyboardist Kate Pierson about the musical tone of the time. ‘Whammy Kiss’ gives the album its title. ‘Whammy Kiss’ is a group composition as is ‘Song For A Future Generation’ (UK no. 63). Propulsive and futuristic, the latter coos, “Let’s meet and have a baby now!” Each of the group members introduces themselves in ‘Song For A Future Generation’ together with their astrological sign and their likes. Perhaps the most amusing is Cindy Wilson’s offering: “I like Chihuahuas and Chinese noodles” – presumably not together. The B-52’s buddy Robert Waldrop contributes the lyrics for ‘Legal Tender’ (US no. 81), a slice of synthetic robo-funk in which Kate and Cindy sing a story that’s apparently about printing counterfeit currency. ‘Don’t Worry’ has lyrics penned by Yoko Ono. However, conflict with Yoko leads to ‘Don’t Worry’ being removed after initial pressings and replaced by ‘Moon 83’ – a remixed version of ‘There’s A Moon In The Sky (Called The Moon)’ from the group’s first album.\n\nIt is during the recording sessions for ‘Whammy’ that Ricky Wilson learns he has AIDS. He confides in Keith Strickland, but keeps his illness from the rest of the group. Even Ricky’s sister, Cindy, is kept in the dark: “Ricky didn’t tell me what was going on. I can’t tell you what was in his mind…He didn’t tell anybody else but Keith Strickland and that was his choice,” she says. Kate Pierson suggests that Ricky kept his illness secret because he “did not want anyone to worry about him or fuss about him.”\n\n‘Fred Schneider & The Shake Society’ (1984) is a solo album by The B-52’s’ frontman.\n\nOn 21 April 1985 Cindy Wilson marries Keith Bennett. The art student she met back at The B-52’s gig on Valentine’s Day in 1977 became a guitar technician for Cindy’s brother Ricky Wilson and then an advertising executive, but is still described as an ‘artist/musician.’ Cindy and Keith have children but are very private about their offspring. So far as can be ascertained, they have a daughter named India (born 1990) and a son (born 1999). One account has it that there is a third child. This may be true but no supporting information has been found. (Note: Cindy’s daughter is named after India Wilkes. This character is the sister of Ashley Wilkes in the film ‘Gone with the Wind’ (1939).)\n\nRicky Wilson dies on 12 October 1985 from complications related to AIDS. He was 32. “When Ricky passed away in 1985,” explains Kate Pierson, “a decision was made by Ricky and Cindy’s family – her uncle wanted to protect their father, and so he said, ‘Let’s not mention that Ricky had AIDS.’” So his death is initially attributed to lymph cancer. This may well be more accurate since the nature of AIDS is to weaken the immune system; the secondary cancer infection may have been what was truly fatal. Cindy Wilson notes, “It kind of threw me for a loop when all of a sudden I got a phone call from the hospital saying, ‘Your brother’s dying.’ And then I never did get to say goodbye to him. So it really screwed me up.”\n\n‘Bouncing Off The Satellites’ (1986) (US no. 85, UK no. 74, AUS no. 73) is completed before Ricky Wilson’s death but, since it is not released until 8 September 1986, it comes out after his passing. The album is produced by Tony Mansfield. ‘Summer Of Love’ (US no. 90) draws some attention and ‘Wig’ (UK no. 79) celebrates their hairpieces. Cindy Wilson handles the solo vocal on ‘Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland’. This tumbling piece of funk has nothing to do with the 1964 bossa nova song ‘Girl From Ipanema’ by Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz. ‘In light of [Ricky] Wilson’s death, the group finds it impossible to promote [this] album, and they spend the next few years in seclusion.’\n\n‘Dance This Mess Around: The Best Of The B-52’s’ (1986) (UK no. 36) is a compilation album created for the U.K. only.\n\n‘Fred Schneider and Other Unrelated Works’ (1987) is the second book of poetry by The B-52’s vocalist.\n\n‘Cosmic Thing’ (1989) (US no. 4, UK no. 8, AUS no. 1) in June signifies the return of The B-52’s. With this release, the group migrates to Reprise Records. The B-52’s are now managed by Steven Jensen and Martin Kirkup. ‘Cosmic Thing’ brings together songs from two different recording sessions. Six of the ten tracks are produced by Nile Rodgers (of Chic) while the remaining four fall under the supervision of Don Was (of Was (Not Was)). Without Ricky Wilson, former drummer Keith Strickland moves over to guitar. Although the songwriting is still credited to the group as a whole, Strickland says, “I write the individual instrument parts and arrange the instrumental compositions myself.” The first single from the album is ‘Channel Z’ (UK no. 61, AUS no. 145), which Strickland describes as, “our environmental anthem.” ‘Love Shack’ (US no. 3, UK no. 2, AUS no. 1) is a song about a makeshift rural dance venue and it is warm and funny. “There was a place in Athens [Georgia] called the Hawaiian Ha-Le that…was kind of the model for the Love Shack,” advises Kate Pierson. It is “one of the happiest songs and [most] successful songs we did,” notes Cindy Wilson, who yells out the strange line, “Tin roof…rusted!” in this song. ‘Channel Z’ and ‘Love Shack’ are both from the Don Was sessions. Nile Rodgers produces the other two singles pulled from this set: ‘Roam’ and ‘Deadbeat Club’. ‘Roam’ (US no. 3, UK no. 17, AUS no. 11) is an ode to travelling. It benefits from one of this album’s innovations. The close harmony vocals of Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson are now more tuneful and conventional. Long-time friend of The B-52’s Robert Waldrop pens the lyrics for ‘Roam’. “I don’t want to call it nostalgia,” says Pierson, “because I don’t think we were maudlin or anything [but] we started thinking about early times in Athens, like ‘Deadbeat Club’, [after Ricky Wilson died].” Indeed, ‘Deadbeat Club’ (US no. 30, AUS no. 73) seems autobiographical, recalling the early days when they were “Wild girls and boys going out for a big time” and finding themselves dancing “In torn sheets in the rain.” The best of the rest of the album are probably the hyperactive title track ‘Cosmic Thing’ and the more laid-back sway of ‘Dry County’, both produced by Nile Rodgers. Cindy Wilson concludes that, “While we were doing ‘Cosmic Thing’ it was a healing exercise as much as anything else and who knew it was going to be a big hit?”\n\nAlthough Keith Strickland switched from drums to guitar with ‘Cosmic Thing’ it was only part of a larger musical shift. When Ricky Wilson was alive, the group compensated for their odd musical configuration with equally unusual musical arrangements. Now, a more traditional structure is embraced. On ‘Cosmic Thing’ the following musicians contribute: Keith Strickland, Nile Rodgers (guitars); Tommy Mandell, Keith Strickland, Philippe Saisse, Kate Pierson, Richard Hilton, Sara Lee (keyboards); Sara Lee (bass); Steve Ferrone, Sonny Emory, Charlie Drayton, Leroy Clouden (drums); Fred Schneider (percussion) and the Uptown Horns – Chris Cioe, Paul Literal, Arno Hecht, Bob Funk, Carl Beatty – on ‘Love Shack’. In practice, in subsequent times The B-52’s are augmented in the studio and in concert by: Nick Lashley (guitar); Paul Gordon (keyboards); Pat Irwin (guitar, keyboards); Sara Lee, Tracy Wormworth (bass); and Zachary Alford, Stirling Campbell (drums).\n\nIn 1990 vocalist Cindy Wilson leaves The B-52’s. Although she soldiered on to make ‘Cosmic Thing’ after the death of her brother, Cindy states, “I got burned out by the stress of losing Ricky [Wilson]…I was devastated.” She moves to Atlanta and starts a family. In retrospect, Cindy regrets leaving the group (“It was a bad decision”) but acknowledges the good that comes from the move (“I’ve got two children and that’s beautiful”).\n\nIn 1990 Kate Pierson duets with Iggy Pop on the latter’s single ‘Candy’ (US no. 28, UK no. 67).\n\nThe solo album ‘Fred Schneider & The Shake Society’ (1984) is rereleased under the title ‘Fred Schneider’ (1991). Fred also releases the 1991 solo single ‘Monster’ (US no. 85).\n\nKate Pierson duets with R.E.M. on their 1991 hit ‘Shiny Happy People’ (US no. 10, UK no. 6, AUS no. 19). Like The B-52’s, R.E.M. hail from Athens, Georgia.\n\n‘Good Stuff’ (1992) (US no. 16, UK no. 8, AUS no. 36) is co-produced by Nile Rodgers, Don Was and Russ Titelman. On this disc, The B-52’s are reduced to the trio of Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson and Keith Strickland. The title track, ‘Good Stuff’ (US no. 28, UK no. 21, AUS no. 56), is a strong funk piece with a more rock-oriented guitar line. It urges, “Take me down where the good stuff grows / Love you nice, tickle your nose.” Regular co-conspirator Robert Waldrop provides the lyrics for ‘Revolution Earth’. Other notable tracks on this album are ‘Tell It Like It T-I-Is’ (UK no. 61), ‘Is That You Mo-Dean?’ (UK no. 78) and ‘Hot Pants Explosion’ (UK no. 78). ‘Good Stuff’ is described as The B-52’s ‘most overtly political album.’\n\nIn an interview with ‘Q’ magazine in 1992, Keith Strickland of The B-52’s comes out as gay. He has a boyfriend named Mark.\n\nJulee Cruise sings on The B-52’s’ ‘Good Stuff’ tour in 1992-1993 as a replacement for Cindy Wilson.\n\nCindy Wilson rejoins The B-52’s in 1994.\n\n‘The Flintstones’ (1994), the live-action movie version of the Hanna-Barbera television cartoon (1960-1966), includes an appearance by The B-52’s…as The BC-52’s. They also perform the song ‘(Meet) The Flintstones’ (US no. 33, UK no. 3, AUS no. 54).\n\nThe B-52’s’ vocalist Fred Schneider releases another solo album, ‘Just Fred’ (1996).\n\nThe compilation album ‘Time Capsule: Songs For A Future Generation’ (1998) (US no. 93, AUS no. 40) includes two new songs: ‘Debbie’ and ‘Hallucinating Pluto’. Supposedly, ‘Debbie’ is a tribute to Debbie Harry, lead vocalist of fellow U.S. new wave act Blondie – the “Shellshock, supersonic blonde”. The track sounds a bit more rock than the usual B-52’s fare, with rough guitars giving it a welcome bite.\n\nIn 1999 Cindy Wilson takes maternity leave from The B-52’s. She is replaced on tour by Gail Ann Dorsey.\n\nCindy Wilson returns to The B-52’s in 2001.\n\nWarner Bros. Records issue the compilation album ‘Nude On The Moon: The B-52’s Anthology’ (2002) (US no. 136).\n\nIn 2003 The Cindy Wilson Band provides an outlet for the original solo compositions of The B-52’s vocalist.\n\nIn 2005 Kate Pierson of The B-52’s gives an interview in which she says she has ‘been dating a woman for almost a year now.’ Kate is described as ‘wild and bisexual.’ Kate Pierson has actually been with her partner, Monica Coleman, since 2003.\n\n‘Funplex’ (2008) (US no. 11, UK no. 73, AUS no. 93) is the first album of new material by The B-52’s in sixteen years. Produced by Steve Osborne, the disc is released on the Astralwerks label. According to guitarist Keith Strickland, “It’s loud, sexy rock ‘n’ roll with the beat turned up to hot pink.” The single, ‘Pump’, seems to support this theory: “Pump it up, give it up, turn up the track / Hard kiss, love chain.” Another of the album’s songs, ‘Juliet Of The Spirits’, is inspired by the Frederico Fellini directed film ‘Juliet of the Spirits’ (1965) (a.k.a. ‘Giulietta Degli Spiriti’). All tracks on this album are jointly composed by the four members of the group. ‘Funplex’ is considered ‘a slick, synthesiser-driven effort.’ In 2008 The B-52’s drop the apostrophe from their name becoming The B-52s. (Here, when referring to the band’s history in general, the apostrophe is retained since it was present for the greater part of their career.)\n\nIn 2008 Fred Schneider starts a side project: The Superions. This ‘comedy synth pop band’ is a trio in which Schneider works with Noah Brodie and Dan Marshall. The Superions offer up the 2008 single ‘Totally Nude Island’. This is followed by the 2009 single ‘Who Threw That Ham At Me’. 2010 is a busy year for The Superions with the self-titled EP ‘The Superions’, the singles ‘Those Sexy Saucer Girls’ and ‘Fruitcake’ as well as the album ‘Destination: Christmas’ (2010). 2011 brings the EP ‘Batbaby’ and the single ‘Konnichiwa’ is issued by The Superions in 2014.\n\nIn 2010 Fred Schneider outs himself as gay on the ‘Howard Stern Show’ on radio. He explains that he came out to his mother while she was doing housework. Apparently Mrs Schneider just said she already knew that and kept vacuuming.\n\nOn 13 December 2012, Keith Strickland retires from touring with The B-52s, but remains part of the group. “It is the path I know in my heart I must follow,” Strickland says in the announcement.\n\nKate Pierson releases a solo album, ‘Guitars And Microphones’ (2015), in February.\n\nOn 3 August 2015 Kate Pierson marries her partner Monica Coleman in Hawaii. The couple operate a pair of motels: ‘Kate’s Lazy Meadow’ in Mount Tremper, New York, and ‘Kate’s Lazy Desert’ in Landers, California.\n\nWhen Ricky Wilson died in 1985, the fact that AIDS had a role in his demise was initially downplayed. Ricky’s own sexual orientation was kept out of general public knowledge. There is a certain irony that, after Ricky Wilson’s death, Keith Strickland and Fred Schneider revealed they are homosexual and Kate Pierson confessed to being bisexual and went so far as to marry her female partner. This left Cindy Wilson as the only heterosexual member in the history of The B-52’s. Since it is unlikely that her colleagues suddenly changed their sexual orientations, it is almost certainly the case that The B-52’s were always predominantly gay. It is perhaps a measure of how society changed that what was once a taboo subject became openly discussed and acknowledged. When Cindy Wilson said, “Watching us onstage showed [fans] it was OK to be different,” she was probably referring to the band’s unusual style of attire but, in a broader sense, The B-52’s showed it was OK to be different sexually. Musically, ‘The B-52’s’ (1979) and ‘Cosmic Thing’ (1989) seem to be the clear peaks of the band’s career. The B-52’s were a band that ‘settled into a cult stardom that was just this side of obscurity’ and showcased a ‘campy, thrift-store aesthetic.’\n\nSources:\n\nwikipedia.org as at 27 February 2016\n\nbiography.com – ‘Cindy Wilson’ – no author credited – as at 27 February 2016\n\nInternet Movie Database – imdb.com – as at 29 February 2016\n\nmetrolyrics.com as at 28 February 2016\n\nweepingelvis.com – ‘Interview: Keith Strickland of The B-52s: Putting It All Together’ by Pat Ferrise (28 April 2012)\n\niheartguitar.com – ‘Interview: Keith Strickland of The B-52s’ by Peter Hodgson (11 November 2011)\n\n‘Rolling Stone’ (U.S. rock magazine) – ‘Interview: The B-52’s’ by James Henke – issue 332 (11 December 1980) (reproduced on rollingstone.com)\n\nbiography.com – ‘Fred Schneider’ – no author credited – as at 28 February 2016\n\nNotable Names Database – nndb.com – as at 28 February 2016\n\namerica.aljazeera.com – ‘Kate Pierson Talks to Adam May’(30 April 2015)\n\nbiography.com – ‘Kate Pierson’ – no author credited – as at 28 February 2016\n\n‘The Daily Telegraph’ (U.K. newspaper) – ‘B-52s: The Love Shack Shakes Again’ by Robert Sandall (3 April 2008) (reproduced on telegraph.co.uk)\n\n‘Quintessential Covina’ (U.S. television program) Public Access Channel 33 – B-52’s interview conducted by Jeff Plummer (1989)\n\n‘The Age’ (Melbourne, Australia, newspaper) – ‘Bouffant Bombshell’ – Cindy Wilson interview conducted by Jo Roberts (27 November 2009) (reproduced on theage.com.au)\n\n‘Atlanta Woman’ (U.S. magazine) – ‘Here’s to the Party’ – Cindy Wilson interview conducted by Mary Welch (April 2006) (reproduced on marywelchwriter.com)\n\navclub.com – ‘Kate Pierson of The B-52s’ – interview conducted by Will Harris (1 November 2011)\n\ntheb52s.com via 2 (above)\n\n‘The B-52’s’ – Anonymous sleeve notes to the CD reissue (Warner Brothers Records, 1979) p. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11\n\n‘The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll’, ‘Alternative Scenes: America’ by Ken Tucker (Plexus Publishing Limited,1992) p.576\n\nallmusic.com, ‘The B-52’s’ by Jason Ankeny as at 28 February 2016\n\n‘The History Of Rock’ by Mark Paytress (Parragon Books, 2011) p. 191\n\nlyricsfreak.com as at 28 February 2016\n\n‘Rolling Stone Rock Almanac’ by the Editors of ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine (Papermac, 1984) p. 318\n\n‘EMP: Experience Music Project’ (24 July 2010) via 1 (above)\n\nclatl.com – Creative Loafing – ‘The B-52’s: Welcome to Cindy Wilson’s Love Shack’ by Lee Valentine Smith (26 July 2007)\n\npopcultureclassics.com – ‘B-52’s Flying High Again’ by Paul Freeman (1998)\n\n‘Cosmic Thing’ – Anonymous sleeve notes (Reprise Records, 1989) p. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n\nprince.org – ‘Kate Pierson Likes the Ladies’ by Tony Giampetruzzi (6 July 2005)\n\n‘Rolling Stone’ (U.S. rock magazine) – ‘First B-52s Album in Sixteen Years’ (24 October 2007) via 1 (above)\n\nqueerid.com – ‘B-52s’ Fred Schneider is Gay!’ (2010)\n\nfacebook.com via 1 (above)\n\nyoutube.com as at 28 February 2016\n\nSong lyrics copyright Boo-Fant Tunes, Inc. with the exceptions of: ‘Give Me Back My Man’ (Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, BMG Rights Management); ‘Party Out Of Bounds’, ‘Song for A Future Generation’, ‘Good Stuff’ and ‘Debbie’ (all Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC); ‘Mesopotamia’ (EMI Music Publishing); ‘Love Shack’ and ‘Dead Beat Club’ (Man Woman Together Now!

An arrest has been made for a violation of The Mann Act A.K.A. the White Slave Traffic Act. The statute makes it illegal to coerce, entice, or transport females across State lines for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or any other immoral purpose. The person reporting the offence is the aforementioned female. Janice Norine Escalanti is a 14 year old Apache girl who only managed two years at high school. The alleged offender has a police record. He did a three year stint (1944 to 1947) in reform school for attempted robbery. It is now 23 December 1959. The accused is Chuck Berry.\n\nCharles Edward Anderson Berry (18 October 1926-18 March 2017) is born at six fifty-nine a.m. at 2320 Goode Avenue, St Louis, Missouri, U.S.A. He is the son of Henry William Berry and Martha Bell Berry (nee Banks). Chuck Berry’s parents were the grandchildren of slaves. Henry Berry is a carpenter as well as a deacon at the Antioch Baptist Church. Martha Berry is ‘one of the few black women of her generation to gain a college education.’ She is a certified public school Principal.\n\nChuck Berry is the fourth of six children. His siblings are Henry, Thelma, Lucy, Paul and Martha.\n\nThe Berry family settles in Elleadsville – ‘The Ville’ – St Louis. This is ‘a self-contained middle class black community that is a haven for black-owned businesses and institutions.’ Little Chuck doesn’t even see anyone who is not African-American until he is 3 years old. The first white people he sees are firemen putting out a blaze. “Daddy told me they were white people, and their skin was always white that way, day or night,” Chuck recalls.\n\nIn 1929 the Berry family buys a radio. This brings a variety of sounds into the household. Chuck Berry remembers listening to country music on the radio at home in St Louis, though this is rather unusual in an African-American home since the audience for country music is predominantly white. The Baptist choir from Henry Berry’s church practices in the kitchen of the deacon’s home. When Chuck is 6, he begins singing in the church choir. The Berry family has a piano and Chuck’s eldest sister, Thelma, takes lessons in classical piano playing. Chuck is interested in the instrument too but his other big sister, Lucy, keeps her annoying kid brother away from the piano. Lucy sings and also plays classical music on piano.\n\nChuck Berry attends Cottage Avenue Elementary School. As a boy, his hobbies include carpentry and photography. His father, Henry Berry, is keen to encourage his son in woodwork since Henry is a carpenter. Similarly, it is Chuck’s uncle, Harry Davis – who is a professional photographer – who motivates the boy to take an interest in that craft.\n\nChuck Berry moves on to Sumner High School. This is ‘a prestigious private institution that is the first all-black high school west of the Mississippi’ river. Although he comes from a middle class background with relatively articulate and educated parents, at high school Chuck Berry’s attitude to school work does not reflect this. He is ‘uninterested in studies’ and is characterised as a ‘troublemaker.’\n\nChuck Berry’s first public performance as a singer takes place in 1941. Still at Sumner High, he sings ‘Confessin’ The Blues’. This is a recent hit recorded by Jay McShann’s Orchestra with Walter Brown on vocals. A blues song with a sassy sexual overtone, it’s a bold choice for a youngster. Chuck only sings; the guitar accompaniment is provided by fellow student Tommy Stevens. The experience does inspire Chuck to take up the guitar himself. He gets a second-hand guitar from Joe Sherman, a St Louis blues singer. Chuck is given lessons in playing the guitar by Ira Harris, a neighbourhood barber. Chuck Berry’s influences are a mixed bag. He looks up to blues guitarist T-Bone Walker; Carl Hogan, who plays guitar with saxophonist Louis Jordan’s rhythm and blues band; and Charlie Christian, guitarist in Benny Goodman’s big band swing group. “The big band is my era,” Berry later says proudly.\n\nAs a teenager, apart from music Chuck Berry’s interests are fairly typical. He tries to get girls to ride with him in his V-8 Ford motor car. His first regular girlfriend is a lass named Margie. Berry sings in his school glee clubs.\n\nIn 1944, while still at Sumner High School, Chuck Berry and two of his friends decide to drive all the way to California. They only go from St Louis to Kansas City on the other side of Missouri before their plans go astray. The boys find a pistol in a parking lot. Gun in hand, they rob three stores: a bakery, a clothing store and a barbershop. After stealing a car, Chuck Berry and his pals are arrested by the police.\n\nConvicted of armed robbery, Chuck Berry is sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri. He serves a three year sentence from 1944 to 1947. During his time at reform school, Berry does some boxing and forms a singing quartet. The vocal group is good enough to be allowed to perform some shows outside the detention facility. Chuck Berry is released on his 21st birthday, 18 October 1947.\n\nOn 28 October 1948 Chuck Berry marries Themetta ‘Toddy’ Suggs. His wife’s father came from Calcutta, India. Chuck and his wife go on to have four children: Darlin Ingrid (born 3 October 1950), Melody Exes (born 1952), Aloha Isa Lei and Charles Edward Jr. In 1950 Berry buys a house in Whittier Street where he raises his family.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1951 Chuck Berry works at a bewildering array of positions, trying to financially support himself and his family. He is employed by two automobile assembly factories, one of which is the General Motors Fisher Body Plant. Berry trains as a beautician at Poro College of Cosmetology and works as a hairdresser. He is a janitor at the apartment building where his wife lived and at the General Motors Fisher Body Plant. Chuck Berry assists his father as a carpenter and freelances as a photographer. Allegedly, he wants to become a professional photographer like his uncle and it is in order to earn money to buy cameras that he begins singing and playing music.\n\nChuck Berry aspires to be a big band guitarist but that style of music has all but died out by the early 1950s. Tommy Stevens, who accompanied Chuck at high school on ‘Confessin’ The Blues’, invites his friend to join his group for a gig at a club called Huff’s Garden on 13 June 1952. This is Chuck Berry’s first professional show…and he earns six dollars! Needless to say, Chuck has to continue doing carpentry jobs with his father to make some money. On the last day of 1952 The St John’s Trio find themselves without a saxophone player since their horn-man has caught a cold. Pianist Johnnie Johnson and drummer Ebby Harding are reluctant to give up the lucrative New Year’s Eve gig so Johnson calls upon guitarist Chuck Berry, whom he met a year earlier. The gig goes well, the saxophone player is permanently dropped and the act becomes The Chuck Berry Trio. Pianist Johnnie Johnson becomes Chuck Berry’s most frequent musical partner over the years to come.\n\nThe Chuck Berry Trio regularly plays at the Cosmopolitan Club in St Louis. The group plays blues and ballads but, unusually, they also play country music. Chuck Berry explains that, “Curiosity provoked me to lay a lot of our country stuff on our predominantly black audience and some of our black audience began whispering, ‘Who is that black hillbilly at the Cosmo?’ After they laughed at me a few times, they began requesting the hillbilly stuff and enjoyed dancing to it.”\n\nIn early May 1955 Ralph Burris, a friend of Chuck Berry, goes to Chicago, Illinois, to visit his mother. Chuck joins him for the trip. Chicago is an important city for blues music so Berry takes the opportunity to catch a show by the great blues artist Muddy Waters. After the show, Berry introduces himself backstage and asks Muddy Waters about who he can contact to get a recording contract. Muddy Waters suggests Chicago’s Chess Records, run by the brothers Phil and Leonard Chess. Two days later, Berry gets a meeting with Leonard Chess. The aspiring recording artist is told to submit a demo tape with a couple of songs. Back in St Louis, Berry prepares such a tape. Chess Records responds with an offer of a recording session. Chuck Berry’s career as a recording artist is about to begin.\n\nChuck Berry’s music is rock ‘n’ roll. He is described as ‘the father of rock ‘n’ roll.’ More accurately, he is one of a handful of artist who lay down the foundations of what will come to be called rock ‘n’ roll. Berry himself refers to the likes of Bill Haley, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley and Little Richard as being amongst this group of first generation rock ‘n’ roll acts. Rock ‘n’ roll is a collision of white country and western music with black rhythm and blues. As an African-American, Berry comes up through blues and its more danceable cousin, rhythm and blues. But his adoption of country music as well distinguishes him as a rock ‘n’ roll performer.\n\nImportantly, Chuck Berry is not just a singer or a guitarist, he is a songwriter. Although he will record cover versions of others’ songs, he writes most of his own material. Certainly, Chuck Berry’s best known songs are those he pens himself. In writing his songs, Berry codifies the nature of rock ‘n’ roll. He writes songs about teenagers’ main concerns: cars, girls, school, rock ‘n’ roll. At this point, Berry is around 30 years old. He is not a teenager. It is a commercial decision to write songs to appeal to a teenage market. This does not detract from the canny and incisive accomplishment of his body or work. Though Berry does nothing to disguise his racial origins, he concentrates on clear diction to better emphasise his witty words, eschewing the blurring of notes and vocal stylings of many other black recording artists. “I’d rather have more people hear the melody and the words than a few people have a good feeling from a complex arrangement of a song…The lyrics were what we were pushing,” he says. There is a playful quality to Chuck Berry’s lyrics. He delights in the joys of the English language, but is not averse to bending rules of grammar, pronunciation and logic to accentuate his humour and verse. “I love poetry. I love rhyming,” says Berry. But these are songs, not sonnets. Chuck Berry’s music has a drive and vitality that gives it both wide appeal and longevity. “My music is simple stuff,” he shrugs, but this elemental nature makes them the bedrock of so much music that follows in rock’s history. “The nature and backbone of my beat is boogie, and the muscle of my music is melodies that are simple,” Berry testifies. The country twang of Chuck Berry’s guitar may be a novelty to African-American listeners, but the rowdy burst of noise – a kind of supercharged blues – is a revelation to white kids.\n\nChuck Berry’s first recording session takes place on 21 May 1955. He cuts two songs. They are the two pieces that secured him a recording contract with Chess Records. They become the songs released on his first single.\n\nChuck Berry’s debut single, ‘Maybellene’ (US no. 5) backed with ‘Wee Wee Hours’, is released in July 1955. Backing up Berry’s vocals and guitar are Johnnie Johnson (piano), Willie Dixon (bass), Jerome Green (maracas) and Jasper Thomas (drums). ‘Maybellene’ is adapted from a traditional country song called ‘Ida Red’, popularised in a version by Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys in 1938. Berry’s mutated version had been going under the name of ‘Ida May’, but Leonard Chess – as co-producer with his brother Phil – is not entirely satisfied. The name of the song is changed to ‘Maybellene’, but there are conflicting accounts of where that name comes from. Pianist Johnnie Johnson recalls that there was a discarded box of ‘Maybellene’ brand mascara in the studio and it was this that inspired Leonard Chess to choose it as the song’s new title. Chuck Berry claims that the name comes from a cartoon cow in a third grade reader. ‘Maybellene’ sets out Berry’s style with its storyline of fast cars and girls. “’Maybellene’ was very much a country song, with country lyrics,” claims Chuck Berry. “Maybe a little faster, but basically it was country.” In practice, ‘Maybellene’ springs to life with an over-amplified guitar that skates perilously close to distortion and then engages in a call-and-response trade with Berry’s voice for the focus. The drumbeats seem to be moving too fast for the rest of the song and the guitar and voice spend the running time caught in the current, trying to catch up. Now, ‘Maybellene’ is credited to Chuck Berry as sole author, but originally it was co-credited to Berry, Alan Freed and Russ Fratto. Alan Freed is the radio disc jockey who devises the term ‘rock ‘n’ roll.’ Charitably, it has been said that Freed ‘possibly suggested modifications to enhance [‘Maybellene’s] commercial potential.’ More cynically, it is argued that Freed ‘accepted the payola perk of a credit as co-author and added “Maybellene” to his playlist.’ Russ Fratto is also a DJ (disc jockey) but a local one who is also a friend of Chuck Berry. Fratto gives his share of the royalties to the singer. His name was added to the credits in a wily move to ensure that Berry receives more money from the sales of the single than Freed. In any case, ‘Maybellene’ becomes a hit. “There is no way to explain how you feel when you first hear your first recording for the first time in your first new car,” exults Chuck Berry. The single’s flipside, ‘Wee Wee Hours’ (also written by Chuck Berry) is a slower, more traditional blues song, reportedly inspired by his teenage girlfriend, Margie. The original plan had been for ‘Wee Wee Hours’ to be the A side (a blues song for a Chicago record label) but Leonard Chess preferred the more unusual ‘Maybellene’.\n\nWhile promoting ‘Maybellene’, Chuck Berry and his band pile into a car wearing the outfits in which they will perform. On arrival, Berry finds his suit badly creased and crumpled. To avoid displaying this mishap, Berry does an old party trick on stage. “When I was a kid,” Chuck says, “I used to scoot under the table whenever company would come around. My sisters or parents would tell me to go under the table, y’know. And I’d do it. It was like an entertainment for the family or aunts or whatever. And one time, Paramount it was, the Brooklyn Paramount [Theatre], I did it in the act on an instrumental and played my guitar and I got a big ovation. So I coined it as one of the things I should do in the act.” Crouched down over his guitar, Chuck Berry hops around in a squatting posture. This is the origin of his trademark ‘duck walk’. While Berry may be the originator of one of rock’s most identifiable guitar sounds, he is – first and foremost – a showman.\n\nChuck Berry releases two more singles in 1955 and though both of them do well on the rhythm and blues charts, unlike ‘Maybellene’ they are not hits on the pop chart. ‘Thirty Days’ is described as a ‘more self-consciously hillbilly’ song. The other single is ‘No Money Down’ b/w ‘Downbound Train’. ‘No Money Down’ is a tale of “motorvatin’” as Chuck the narrator trades in his “broken down, ragged Ford” for a new convertible with “TV and a phone / So I can call my baby when I’m drivin’ alone.” The flipside, ‘Downbound Train’, is an anomaly. It is full of gospel dread and involves an encounter with Satan. It is about the only evidence in his musical catalogue of Berry being raised in the household of a Baptist deacon.\n\nMoving into 1956, Chuck Berry returns to the pop charts with ‘Roll Over Beethoven’ (US no. 29), released in May. The song is inspired by memories of his sister Lucy’s domination of the family record player with her classical music discs. Chuck’s composition is a song of praise for the new born medium of rock ‘n’ roll: “Gonna write a little letter / Gonna mail it to my local DJ / It’s a jumpin’ little record / I want my jockey to p"
