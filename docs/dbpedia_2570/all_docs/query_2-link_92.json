        "text": "Welsh classical singer Katherine Jenkins has released her seventh album Believe and will head out on her first solo UK arena tour in March.\n\nThe 29-year-old from Neath, a mezzo-soprano, studied at the Royal Academy of Music before her 2004 debut album spent eight weeks at the top of the UK Classical charts.\n\nHer pop crossover sound has seen her sell more than four million records.\n\nIN 2010 YOU’RE HEADING OUT ON A UK TOUR, ARE YOU EXCITED?\n\nOh my gosh, yes! It’s my first solo arena tour and I loved the experience of doing the arenas when I was doing Viva La Diva with Darcey Bussell, but obviously this is going to be exciting because I’m going to be on my own for the first time. I’m also really excited about the new album, and I’ll play a lot of the new songs on the tour dates – it’s all very exciting.\n\nIS THE IDEA OF STANDING IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NERVE-WRACKING?\n\nI have to say I generally don’t get nervous. I’m normally about as calm now when I’m talking to you as I am when I’m onstage. If I forget the words, which does happen, I normally make a joke and we’ll have a bit of a laugh about it. When there are tour dates approaching, it makes me want to work hard and give a great show and do a great performance. We’ll just see what happens.\n\nYOU’VE BEEN GIVEN THE TITLE ’THE NEW FORCES SWEETHEART’ – ARE YOU PROUD?\n\nWhen I was given it, it was a huge compliment but I immediately wanted to feel I should earn the title rather than just be given it. That’s why I still go out and sing. I’m involved in the British Forces Foundation. I still want to be as involved as I can be, so it’s something which is very close to my heart.\n\nDO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS WHO ARE IN THE ARMED FORCES?\n\nI’ve got lots of friends whose sons or brothers are in the forces, and the reason I wanted to become involved was because of my association with going to see the Chelsea pensioners, and then having gone out and entertained the troops in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. I get lots of letters and the more I go out there, the bigger the impact it has on me. I realise what an amazing job they are all doing and how hard it is for them away from their families, and I have so much respect for them. Whenever they ask me to go out there, I will be there for them.\n\nWHAT WAS IT LIKE GROWING UP IN SOUTH WALES?\n\nThere’s a lot of music in South Wales from things like competitions, and most of the towns and villages have male voice choirs, so there’s a lot of singing going on there anyway. I certainly felt like my community supported my singing when I was younger, and I’m still very lucky to be supported today. I’m not sure if I would have had the same success or chances if I hadn’t grown up in that area, because there were so many places I could pursue my singing in.\n\nYOU WERE AN A-GRADE STUDENT WEREN’T YOU?\n\nYes, and I was in the choir and any school productions. I really liked school and enjoyed it. My parents always encouraged me to work hard, and I was a bit of a swot.\n\nWHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL, DID YOU LIKE POP AS WELL AS CLASSICAL MUSIC?\n\nI did, and still do that today. I think that’s something I think people are shocked at. I’m like any other 29-year-old in that I like whatever’s in the charts and I like to go out dancing. I just happen to love opera too. My friends always understood that I did something slightly different to everybody else and accepted that. I think that was important. Being in a position where I had to sing in assemblies to my year group, there could have been a lot of teasing but they were actually quite kind.\n\nWHEN YOU GO BACK HOME TO NEATH, DO YOU GET THE STAR TREATMENT?\n\nNo I don’t! That’s why I like going home. Everyone’s always asking, ’What are you doing now?’ – they want to know if I’ve got any exciting stories. I’ve lived in the same town since I was born and these people have known me all my life and they don’t think I’m anything special, which I find really nice. It allows me to go home and be able to take the dogs up to the park.\n\nDO YOU THINK CLASSICAL MUSIC HAS AN IMAGE PROBLEM?\n\nClassical music at times can seem intimidating, and I can totally understand that because I felt intimidated when I was younger, but I’m trying to show people it really doesn’t need to be like that. You can go and enjoy it and it doesn’t matter about how much money you’ve got or what you wear. Classical music really was the pop music of its day. It really was music for the masses.\n\nWHAT OTHER ARTISTS DO YOU LIKE?\n\nEveryone from Kylie to Kanye West and Madonna, Amy Winehouse, Take That – I have a pretty wide-ranging taste. I like anything which is fun and I can have a good dance to.\n\nARE YOU A BIT OF A WORKAHOLIC?\n\nI love what I do, and even if I get some time off I’m thinking, ’Why am I not working?’. It’s about finding the right balance. When I do get to spend time with my family, it’s sacred and real quality time.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR HOPES FOR THE FUTURE?\n\nI’m really excited about the new album and I’m going to try to break America - I’ll just see how that goes. I’ll be working really hard. I’d also like to do some opera. Finally, not yet but definitely in the future, I’d love to have my own family – that is really important to me.\n\nNext page: Katherine's tour dates\n\nKATHERINE JENKINS’ MARCH 2010 ARENA TOUR DATES\n\nMar 3: Birmingham NIA\n\nMar 4: Glasgow Clyde Auditorium\n\nMar 6: Newcastle Metro Radio Arena\n\nMar 7: Nottingham Trent FM Arena\n\nMar 9: Bournemouth Intl Centre\n\nMar 10: Brighton Centre\n\nMar 12: Manchester MEN Arena\n\nMar 13: London The O2\n\nMar 15: Cardiff International Arena\n\nMar 18: Liverpool Echo Arena\n\nMar 19: Sheffield Arena"
