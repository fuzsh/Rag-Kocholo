        "text": "Elegant Nicole Kidman, known as one of Hollywood's top Australian imports, was actually born in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were there on educational visas.\n\nKidman is the daughter of Janelle Ann (Glenny), a nursing instructor, and Antony David Kidman, a biochemist and clinical psychologist. She is of English, Irish, and Scottish descent. Shortly after her birth, the family moved to Washington, D.C., where Nicole's father pursued his research on breast cancer, and then, three years later, made the pilgrimage back to her parents' native Sydney in Australia, where Nicole was raised. Young Nicole's first love was ballet, but she eventually took up mime and drama as well (her first stage role was a bleating sheep in an elementary school Christmas pageant). In her adolescent years, acting edged out the other arts and became a kind of refuge -- as her classmates sought out fun in the sun, the fair-skinned Kidman retreated to dark rehearsal halls to practice her craft. She worked regularly at the Philip Street Theater, where she once received a personal letter of praise and encouragement from audience member Jane Campion (then a film student). Kidman eventually dropped out of high school to pursue acting full-time. She broke into movies at age 16, landing a role in the Australian holiday favorite 40 Grad im Schatten (1983). That appearance touched off a flurry of film and television offers, including a lead in Die BMX-Bande (1983) and a turn as a schoolgirl-turned-protester in the miniseries Vietnam (1987) (for which she won her first Australian Film Institute Award). With the help of an American agent, she eventually made her US debut opposite Sam Neill in the at-sea thriller Todesstille (1989).\n\nKidman's next casting coup scored her more than exposure. While starring as Tom Cruise's doctor/love interest in the racetrack romance Tage des Donners (1990), she won over the Hollywood hunk hook, line and sinker. After a whirlwind courtship (and decent box office returns), the couple wed on December 24, 1990. Determined not to let her new marital status overshadow her fledgling career, the actress pressed on. She appeared as a catty high school senior in the Australian film Flirting - Spiel mit der Liebe (1991), then as Dustin Hoffman's moll in the gangster flick Billy Bathgate (1991). She reunited with Cruise for In einem fernen Land (1992), the story of young Irish lovers who flee to America in the late 1800s, and starred opposite Michael Keaton in the tear-tugger Mein Leben f√ºr dich (1993). Despite her steady employment, critics and moviegoers still had not quite warmed to Kidman as a leading lady. She tried to spice up her image by seducing Val Kilmer in Batman Forever (1995), but achieved her real breakthrough with Gus Van Sant's To Die For (1995). As a fame-crazed housewife determined to eliminate any obstacle in her path, Kidman proved that she had an impressive range and deadly comic timing. She took home a Golden Globe and several critics' awards for the performance. In 1996, Kidman stepped into a corset to work with her countrywoman and onetime admirer, Jane Campion, on the adaptation of Henry James's Portrait of a Lady (1996). A few months later, she tore across the screen as a nuclear weapons expert in Projekt: Peacemaker (1997), adding \"action star\" to her professional repertoire.\n\nShe and Cruise then disappeared into a notoriously long, secretive shoot for Stanley Kubrick's sexual thriller Eyes Wide Shut (1999). The couple's on-screen shenanigans prompted an increase in public speculation about their sex life (rumors had long been circulating that their marriage was a cover-up for Cruise's rumored homosexuality); tired of denying tabloid attacks, they successfully sued The Star for a story alleging that they needed a sex therapist to coach them through love scenes. Family life has always been a priority for Kidman. Born to social activists (mother was a feminist; father, a labor advocate), Nicole and her little sister, Antonia Kidman, discussed current events around the dinner table and participated in their parents' campaigns by passing out pamphlets on street corners. When her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, 17-year-old Nicole stopped working and took a massage course so that she could provide physical therapy (her mother eventually beat the cancer). She and Cruise adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1993) and Connor Antony (born 1995). Despite their rock-solid image, the couple announced in early 2001 that they were separating due to career conflicts. Her marriage to Cruise ended mid-summer of 2001.\n\nAmy Lou Adams was born in Vicenza, Veneto, Italy, to American parents, Kathryn (Hicken) and Richard Kent Adams, a U.S. serviceman who was stationed at Caserma Ederle in Italy at the time. She was raised in a Mormon family of seven children in Castle Rock, Colorado, and has English, as well as smaller amounts of Danish, Swiss-German, and Norwegian, ancestry.\n\nAdams sang in the school choir at Douglas County High School and was an apprentice dancer at a local dance company, with the ambition of becoming a ballerina. However, she worked as a greeter at The Gap and as a Hooters hostess to support herself before finding work as a dancer at Boulder's Dinner Theatre and Country Dinner Playhouse in such productions as \"Brigadoon\" and \"A Chorus Line\". It was there that she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner-theater director who asked her to move to Chanhassen, Minnesota for more regional dinner theatre work.\n\nNursing a pulled muscle that kept her from dancing, she was free to audition for a part in Gnadenlos sch√∂n (1999), which was filming nearby in Minnesota. During the filming, Kirstie Alley encouraged her to move to Los Angeles, where she soon won a part in the Fox television version of the film, Eiskalte Engel (1999), in the part played in the film by Sarah Michelle Gellar, \"Kathryn Merteuil\". Although three episodes were filmed, the troubled series never aired. Instead, parts of the episodes were cobbled together and released as the direct-to-video Eiskalte Engel 2 (2000). After more failed television spots, she landed a major role in Catch Me If You Can (2002), playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. But this did not provide the break-through she might have hoped for, with no work being offered for about a year. She eventually returned to television, and joined the short-lived series, Dr. Vegas (2004).\n\nHer role in the low-budget independent film Junik√§fer (2005) (which was shot in 21 days) got her real attention, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as other awards. The following year, her ability to look like a wide-eyed Disney animated heroine helped her to be chosen from about 300 actresses auditioning for the role of \"Giselle\" in the animated/live-action feature film, Verw√ºnscht (2007), which would prove to be her major break-through role. Her vivacious yet innocent portrayal allowed her to use her singing and dancing talents. Her performance garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.\n\nAdams next appeared in the major production, Der Krieg des Charlie Wilson (2007), and went on to act in the independent film, Sunshine Cleaning (2008), which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Her role as \"Sister James\" in Glaubensfrage (2008) brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild award, and a British Academy Film award. She appeared as Amelia Earhart in Nachts im Museum 2 (2009) and as a post-9/11 hot line counselor, aspiring writer, amateur cook and blogger in Julie & Julia (2009). In the early 2010s, she starred with Jason Segel in Die Muppets (2011), with Philip Seymour Hoffman in Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012), and alongside Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Back in the Game (2012). She played reporter Lois Lane in Man of Steel (2013) and con artist Sydney Prosser in American Hustle (2013), before portraying real-life artist Margaret Keane in Tim Burton's biopic Big Eyes (2014).\n\nIn 2016, she reprised her role as Lane in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and headlined Denis Villeneuve's science fiction drama Arrival (2016) and Tom Ford's dark thriller Nocturnal Animals (2016). In 2018, she received another Oscar nomination, her sixth, for starring as Lynne Cheney in the biographical drama Vice - Der zweite Mann (2018), opposite Christian Bale as Dick Cheney.\n\nThe woman who will always be remembered as the crazy, accident-prone, lovable Lucy Ricardo was born Lucille Desiree Ball on August 6, 1911 in Jamestown, New York, the daughter of Desiree Evelyn \"DeDe\" (Hunt) and Henry Durrell \"Had\" Ball. Her father died before she was four, and her mother worked several jobs, so she and her younger brother were raised by their grandparents. Always willing to take responsibility for her brother and young cousins, she was a restless teenager who yearned to \"make some noise\". She entered a dramatic school in New York City, but while her classmate Bette Davis received all the raves, she was sent home; \"too shy\". She found some work modeling for Hattie Carnegie's and, in 1933, she was chosen to be a \"Goldwyn Girl\" and appear in the film Roman Scandals (1933).\n\nShe was put under contract to RKO Radio Pictures and several small roles, including one in Ich tanz mich in dein Herz hinein (1935), followed. Eventually, she received starring roles in B-pictures and, occasionally, a good role in an A-picture, like in B√ºhneneingang (1937) or The Big Street (1942). While filming Too Many Girls (1940), she met and fell madly in love with a young Cuban actor-musician named Desi Arnaz. Despite different personalities, lifestyles, religions and ages (he was six years younger), he fell hard, too, and after a passionate romance, they eloped and were married in November 1940. Lucy soon switched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she got better roles in films such as Du Barry Was a Lady (1943); Best Foot Forward (1943) and the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy vehicle Zu klug f√ºr die Liebe (1945). In 1948, she took a starring role in the radio comedy \"My Favorite Husband\", in which she played the scatterbrained wife of a Midwestern banker. In 1950, CBS came knocking with the offer of turning it into a television series. After convincing the network brass to let Desi play her husband and to sign over the rights to and creative control over the series to them, work began on the most popular and universally beloved sitcom of all time.\n\nWith I Love Lucy (1951), she and Desi promoted the 3-camera technique now the standard in filming sitcoms using 35mm film (the earliest known example of the 3-camera technique is the first Russian feature film, \"Defence of Sevastopol\" in 1911). Desi syndicated I Love Lucy. Lucille Ball was the first woman to own her own studio as the head of Desilu Productions.\n\nLucille Ball died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, age 77, of an acute aortic aneurysm on April 26, 1989 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nJulianne Moore was born Julie Anne Smith in Fort Bragg, North Carolina on December 3, 1960, the daughter of Anne (Love), a social worker, and Peter Moore Smith, a paratrooper, colonel, and later military judge. Her mother moved to the U.S. in 1951, from Greenock, Scotland. Her father, from Burlington, New Jersey, has German, Irish, Welsh, German-Jewish, and English ancestry.\n\nMoore spent the early years of her life in over two dozen locations around the world with her parents, during her father's military career. She finally found her place at Boston University, where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in acting from the School of the Performing Arts. After graduation (in 1983), She took the stage name \"Julianne Moore\" because there was another actress named \"Julie Anne Smith\". Julianne moved to New York and worked extensively in theater, including appearances off-Broadway in two Caryl Churchill plays, Serious Money and Ice Cream With Hot Fudge and as Ophelia in Hamlet at The Guthrie Theatre. But despite her formal training, Julianne fell into the attractive actress' trap of the mid-1980's: TV soaps and miniseries. She appeared briefly in the daytime serial The Edge of Night (1956) and from 1985 to 1988 she played two half-sisters Frannie and Sabrina on the soap Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956). This performance later led to an Outstanding Ing√©nue Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Her subsequent appearances were in mostly forgettable TV-movies, such as M√∂rderische News (1989), The Last to Go (1991) and Hexenjagd in L.A. (1991).\n\nShe made her entrance into the big screen with 1990's Geschichten aus der Schattenwelt (1990), where she played the victim of a mummy. Two years later, Julianne appeared in feature films with supporting parts in Die Hand an der Wiege (1992) and the comedy Betty Lou - Der ganz normale Wahnsinn (1992). She kept winning better and more powerful roles as time went on, including a small but memorable role as a doctor who spots Kimble Harrison Ford and attempts to thwart his escape in Auf der Flucht (1993). (A role that made such an impression on Steven Spielberg that he cast her in the Jurassic Park (1993) sequel without an audition in 1997). In one of Moore's most distinguished performances, she recapitulated her \"beguiling Yelena\" from Andre Gregory's workshop version of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in Louis Malle's critically acclaimed Vanya - 42. Stra√üe (1994). Director Todd Haynes gave Julianne her first opportunity to take on a lead role in Safe (1995). Her portrayal of Carol White, an affluent L.A. housewife who develops an inexplicable allergic reaction to her environment, won critical praise as well as an Independent Spirit Award nomination.\n\nLater that year she found her way into romantic comedy, co-starring as Hugh Grant's pregnant girlfriend in Neun Monate (1995). Following films included Assassins - Die Killer (1995), where she played an electronics security expert targeted for death (next to Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas) and Mein Mann Picasso (1996), where she played Dora Maar, one of the numerous lovers of Picasso (portrayed by her hero, Anthony Hopkins). A year later, after co-starring in Spielberg's Vergessene Welt: Jurassic Park (1997), opposite Jeff Goldblum, a young and unknown director, Paul Thomas Anderson asked Julianne to appear in his movie, Boogie Nights (1997). Despite her misgivings, she finally was won over by the script and her decision to play the role of Amber Waves, a loving porn star who acts as a mother figure to a ragtag crew, proved to be a wise one, since she received both Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Julianne started 1998 by playing an erotic artist in The Big Lebowski (1998), continued with a small role in the social comedy Chicago Cab (1997) and ended with a subtle performance in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho (1960). 1999 had Moore as busy as an actress can be.\n\nAs the century closed, Julianne starred in a number of high-profile projects, beginning with Robert Altman's Cookies Fortune - Aufruhr in Holly Springs (1999) , in which she was cast as the mentally challenged but adorable sister of a decidedly unhinged Glenn Close. A portrayal of the scheming Mrs. Cheveley followed in Oliver Parker's Ein perfekter Ehemann (1999) with a number of critics asserting that Moore was the best part of the movie. She then enjoyed another collaboration with director Anderson in Magnolia (1999) and continued with an outstanding performance in Das Ende einer Aff√§re (1999), for which she garnered another Oscar nomination. She ended 1999 with another great performance, that of a grieving mother in Unschuldig verfolgt (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.\n\nMarcia Anne Cross was born on March 25, 1962 in Marlborough, Massachusetts. As a child, Marcia always wanted to be an actress, so she set out to have a career in acting. Cross graduated from the Juilliard School in New York, a naturally gifted girl. Her career began in 1984, when she joined the cast of the daytime soap opera The Edge of Night (1956). After six months, the show ended its 28-year run. The following year, in 1985, she starred opposite Carroll O'Connor in the television film Brooklyn Murder (1985). Then she landed the lead role in Pros & Cons (1986) with comedienne Sheryl Lee Ralph. She kept busy by starring in Die letzten Tage von Frank und Jesse James (1986) with many famous figures in Hollywood - including June Carter Cash, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson. Marcia's career was looking up when she was cast as Kate Roberts in another daytime soap opera, Liebe, L√ºge, Leidenschaft (1968), and as Tanya in Another World (1964). Marcia was then seen opposite Tim Daly in the tearjerker romance Verr√ºckte Zeiten (1988). Verr√ºckte Zeiten (1988) was a television pilot that never got picked up, but is still very acclaimed to this day. Marcia was then cast as Ruth Fielding in Todfreunde - Bad Influence (1990), a thriller that starred Cross, Rob Lowe and James Spader.\n\nShe joined the cast of Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens (1979) - an incredibly famous nighttime soap opera in 1991. After a year, she left to do work on a new television series called Melrose Place (1992). She was cast as the psychotic Dr. Kimberly Shaw on the prime-time soap opera. The show was a pop-culture phenomenon, going down in history as one of the most entertaining and memorable shows of the 1990s. Marcia, who was starring opposite Heather Locklear, Courtney Thorne-Smith and others, emerged as the fan favorite of the show. Then her longtime companion and fiance, Richard Jordan, died in 1993. Marcia reigned on, starring in films like Female Perversions (1996) opposite Tilda Swinton and Always Say Goodbye (1997) opposite Emmy-nominee Polly Draper, throughout her long run on \"Melrose Place\". In 1997, she left the show in order to get her Master's Degree in Psychology. From 1997 to 2003, she continued to act regularly. She starred in Auf der Woge des Erfolgs (2000), a critically acclaimed film, got herself the lead role in Schmutziges Erbe (2001), starred in The Wind Effect (2003), a disturbing film about family, and even filmed Eastwick (2002), a television pilot that never was picked up. Eastwick (2002) was based on the film Die Hexen von Eastwick (1987), and Marcia was cast in the Susan Sarandon role.\n\nShe got back into the public eye by joining the cast of the critically-acclaimed television series Everwood (2002) with Treat Williams. After a year on the show, she left it when she auditioned for a new television series, Desperate Housewives (2004). In 2004, Marcia was cast as Bree Van De Kamp in Desperate Housewives (2004), which went on to be a monster-hit with the critics and audiences. Marcia began to be nominated for very prestigious awards - including the Emmy Award, Golden Globe, Golden Satellite Award, and a Television Critics' Association Award. Marcia even won a Screen Actors Guild Award in 2005.\n\nLindsay Dee Lohan was born in New York City, on 2 July 1986, to Dina Lohan and Michael Lohan. She began her career at age three as a Ford model, and also made appearances in over sixty television commercials, including spots for The Gap, Pizza Hut, Wendy's, and Jell-O (opposite Bill Cosby). Lohan made her acting debut in 1996 as the third actress to play Ali Fowler in the television drama Another World (1964). Shortly afterward she was hand-picked by Oscar-nominated writer Nancy Meyers as estranged twin sisters in an adaptation by Walt Disney Pictures of a novel by Erich K√§stner, which marked Meyers' directorial debut. Lohan's first feature film, Ein Zwilling kommt selten allein (1998), a remake of Die Verm√§hlung ihrer Eltern geben bekannt (1961), was a modest commercial success, earning her widespread critical acclaim and a Young Artist award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film, as well as Blockbuster Entertainment and YoungStar award nominations.\n\nAfter signing a three-movie contract with Disney, she returned to the small screen to star in the made-for-TV movies Zum Leben erweckt (2000) (opposite Tyra Banks) and Lass dir was einfallen! (2002) (opposite Bug Hall). She also appeared as Rose in the pilot episode of the short-lived comedy series Bette (2000), which starred Bette Midler.\n\nIn June 2001 Lohan took a brief hiatus from acting. Her music career was launched over a year later, when Estefan Enterprises made a five-album production deal with her in September 2002, and she signed a recording contract with the reactivated Casablanca Records.\n\nHowever, Lohan was not turning her back on her blossoming acting career. Just over a month previously she had been cast opposite Jamie Lee Curtis for another Disney adaptation of a novel, this time a fantasy comedy by Mary Rodgers. Freaky Friday - Ein voll verr√ºckter Freitag (2003), a remake of Ein ganz verr√ºckter Freitag (1976), was a huge hit (generating over $160 million in worldwide box office receipts) and critics were spellbound by delightful performances from Lohan and Curtis (who went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for her work). In addition, Lohan won the 2004 MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female, as well as a Saturn award nomination and another Young Artist award nomination.\n\nLohan relocated permanently to Los Angeles between projects and moved into an apartment with fellow actress Raven-Symon√©. She also dated pop star Aaron Carter for a short time.\n\nHer next acting role was the title character in the comedy Bekenntnisse einer Highschool-Diva (2004), a Disney adaptation of the novel by Dyan Sheldon. The film received scathing reviews upon its release and died a quick death at the box office, but even the harshest of critics were impressed by Lohan's charming turn as aspiring actress Lola.\n\nLohan's next project, Girls Club - Vorsicht bissig! (2004), saw her reunite with Freaky Friday - Ein voll verr√ºckter Freitag (2003) director Mark Waters. Inspired by a non-fiction book by Rosalind Wiseman and written by Saturday Night Live (1975) scribe Tina Fey, the high-school comedy-drama opened to glowing reviews and grossed $86 million in the US. This earned her status as a bankable actress, and a salary of $7.5 million for the Donald Petrie romantic comedy Zum Gl√ºck gek√ºsst (2006).\n\nOne of the most sought-after young actresses in the industry, she starred in Bobby (2006) (opposite Demi Moore and Sharon Stone), the Disney fantasy adventure Herbie Fully Loaded - Ein toller K√§fer startet durch (2005) (a pseudo-sequel to Ein toller K√§fer (1969)) and the critically acclaimed Robert Altman's Last Radio Show (2006). On top of a thriving film career Lohan also launched a music career, releasing her debut album, \"Speak,\" which hit shelves in December 2004.\n\nIn 2009 Lohan launched her own fashion line titled 6126, mainly focusing on the production of women's leggings. By spring she launched a self-tanning spray line titled \"Sevin Nyne\" and by the end of the year she became an artistic designer for fashion house Ungaro.\n\nLindsay continues her career in acting, having played a supporting role in the action film Machete (2010).\n\nLily began working as an actress when she was 6 years old, then returned to film when she was 16 in Marilyn Manson's adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. In 2009 she played the female lead in Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus.

Lily wrote and presented a six-part TV series on contemporary art for Sky Arts, shoots photography and directed her first short film Wild Rubber in 2012.\n\nLily has worked with notable photographers and artists from Steven Meisel to Gilliam Wearing. She was the youngest model to appear on the cover of British Vogue, and was listed by French Vogue as one of the top 30 models of the 2000s. As an advocate for sociopolitical and environmental issues, Lily has employed technology, writing, filmmaking and public speaking as means to build awareness and encourage dialogue. Lily was awarded a First Class BA in History of Art from Cambridge University in 2011. In 2013 she co-founded Impossible.com: a technology company that uses technology to solve social and environmental problems.\n\nLily has spoken at Davos, Google's Zeitgeist, Wired and Web Summit, was an affiliate at the Berkman Center at Harvard University, and holds an Honorary Doctor of Letters from GCU. Lily is a patron of the EJF and has worked significantly with WWF. She writes often for national and international press.

She will next be seen starring opposite Nicholas Cage in the thriller Longlegs, set for a 2024 worldwide theatrical release. She also just appeared on Fox's The Masked Singer as Dandelion, winning her first episode with her rendition of Over The Rainbow. Recent sightings include psychological drama Fuzzy Head (2023); I Care A Lot (2021) on Netflix, starring Rosamund Pike and Dianne Wiest; as a killer in Lifetime Network's true crime drama The Disappearance of Cari Farver (2022) and as Zelda on the final season of Orange Is The New Black.\n\nAlicia is also a familiar face to Christmas audiences for her 10 holiday movies, many of which have featured her original music and continue to air every year.\n\nWitt spent 5 weeks in the Billboard Top 30 AC Radio chart with her single Chasing Shadows, off her 2021 album The Conduit, which she co-produced alongside Jordan Lehning and Bill Reynolds. Her newest release is 2023's Witness, led by the title track, which debuted in April. A classically trained former competitive pianist, Alicia's music has been described as 'sharply personal, boldly melodic pop originals in the Carole King/Billy Joel vein' and 'touching lost-and-found love ballads' (Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\nWitt's many films include Two Weeks' Notice, Last Holiday, The Upside of Anger, Mr. Holland's Opus, Urban Legend, Four Rooms, 88 Minutes, Vanilla Sky, and Fun, for which she was awarded the Special Jury Recognition Award from the Sundance Film Festival, and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.\n\nAlicia received rave reviews for her role as Paula in Season 6 of AMC's critically acclaimed series The Walking Dead. Witt also appeared during Season 4 of ABC's 'Nashville' as country star Autumn Chase and in Season 3 of David Lynch's Twin Peaks on Showtime, reprising her role from the original as Gerstein Hayward. Other TV includes FOX's The Exorcist; Law & Order: Criminal Intent; The Mentalist; Friday Night Lights; The Sopranos; Cybill; Ally McBeal; and Twin Peaks.\n\nAlicia has performed her original piano-driven pop music all over the world, including at the renowned Grand Ole Opry. She has also opened for Ben Folds Five, Rachel Platten, and Jimmy Webb, to name a few. Her 2018 release, 15000 Days, was produced by Grammy-winning producer Jacquire King (James Bay, Norah Jones, Kings of Leon, Dawes). Witt's previous album, Revisionary History, was produced by Ben Folds and was hailed as 'Grey Seal era Elton John, an alt-universe Fiona Apple, and a film noir chanteuse notching her nights in cigarette burns on the fallboard' (Nashville Scene).\n\nWitt's first book, Small Changes, came out in Fall 2021 from Harper Horizon. The book is an inspiring, welcoming and simple yet effective guide to health, happiness and sustainable living. Instead of promoting a rigid diet, Small Changes offers readers a stress-and-judgment-free approach for enacting easy, incremental changes across all areas of life.\n\nOn stage, Witt starred in Neil LaBute's Tony nominated play Reasons to Be Pretty at the Geffen Playhouse. She also appeared at London's Royal Court theatre in Terry Johnson's Piano/Forte and made her West End debut with The Shape of Things. She has performed at Williamstown Theatre Festival and has made many appearances in the 24-Hour Plays on Broadway and the 24-Hour Musicals off-Broadway.\n\nRose McGowan is an American actress and director, known for her contribution to independent film. Since the age of nineteen, she has appeared in acclaimed films by Gregg Araki, Wes Craven, Brian De Palma, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. In 2014, her directorial debut Dawn (2014) was nominated for the Short Film Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Rose Arianna McGowan was born on September 5, 1973 in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, to American parents Terri and Daniel Patrick McGowan. She is the second eldest of six siblings, and has Irish, French, and English ancestry. As a young child, she was raised within the Italian chapter of the Children of God. During the early 1980s, her family severed ties with the community and migrated to Eugene, Oregon, USA. Following the divorce of her parents, Rose relocated to Gig Harbor, Washington, to live with her grandmother. At age 14, McGowan was accused of drug use by a family friend and committed to rehabilitation. She has consistently maintained the decision was unjustified. Upon release, she spent a year without a home and was emancipated from her parents by the age of 15. McGowan's career as an actor began with Generation der Verdammten (1995). Originally intended for Jordan Ladd, the character of Amy Blue was, coincidentally, awarded to McGowan by an associate of director Gregg Araki. For her performance, she was nominated at the 1995 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance. Subsequently cast in Wes Craven's Scream - Schrei! (1996), she experienced further success when the project defied expectations to become one of the highest grossing films of the year. The innovative career of McGowan was overshadowed throughout much of the 1990s by her high-profile relationship with musician Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson). Strong performances in Der lange Weg der Leidenschaft (1997), Lewis & Clark & George (1997), Southie (1998) and Der zuckers√º√üe Tod (1999) were largely unseen by the general public. When the relationship ended between Rose and Manson in 2001, she remarked: \"There is great love, but our lifestyle difference is, unfortunately, even greater\". Rose continued to work solidly, appearing in a string of soft-sounding studio and independent films. Performances from this period included: a political activist in Showtime's Killing Yard - M√∂rderischer Auftrag (2001), a grifter in Strange Hearts (2002) and a factory worker in \"Stealing Bess\" (aka Vacuums (2003)). She was re-introduced to the mainstream as Paige Matthews in Aaron Spelling's Charmed: Zauberhafte Hexen (1998), a popular television series for which she devoted five consecutive years. When \"Charmed\" finished its run in 2006, McGowan emerged in top form. Critics praised her efforts in Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007), and Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof - Todsicher (2007). In several interviews, McGowan has expressed a general apathy and disdain for Hollywood. Despite this, her work ethic remains strong. Following her recent marriage to LA-based artist Davey Detail, the actress has resolved to purse further projects as a director.\n\nDebra Messing was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, the daughter of Jewish American parents, Sandra (n√©e Simons), who has worked as a professional singer, banker, travel and real estate agent, and Brian Messing, a sales executive for a jewelry manufacturer. When Messing was three, she moved with her parents and her older brother, Brett, to East Greenwich, a small town outside Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nDuring her high school years, she acted (and sang) in a number of high school productions, including the starring role in the musical \"Annie\" and \"Fiddler On the Roof.\" Messing took lessons in dance, singing, and acting. In 1986, she was Rhode Island's Junior Miss and competed in Mobile, Alabama in the America's Junior Miss scholarship program. While her parents encouraged her dream of becoming an actress, they also urged her to complete a liberal arts education before deciding on acting as a career. Following their advice, she attended Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1990, after graduating summa cum laude from Brandeis with a bachelor's degree in theater arts, Messing gained admission to the elite Graduate Acting Program (which accepts only about 15 new students annually) at New York University, where she earned a master's degree in fine arts after three years.\n\nIn 1998, Messing played a lead role as the bio-anthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC's dramatic science fiction television series Prey. During this time her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show Will & Grace. Messing was inclined to take some time off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating out Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as a romantic rival of Grace's. Will & Grace became a ratings success, and Messing gained renown.\n\nIn 2002, she was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" by People Magazine. TV Guide picked her as its \"Best Dressed Woman\" in 2003. Messing met her husband, Daniel Zelman (an actor and screenwriter), on their first day as graduate students at NYU. The two were married on September 3, 2000, and live in New York City. On April 7, 2004, Messing gave birth to their son, Roman Walker Zelman.\n\nAlan Tudyk was born in El Paso, Texas, but grew up in Plano, where he attended Plano Sr. High. In 1990, he went on to study drama at Lon Morris Jr. College. While there, he was awarded the Academic Excellence Award for Drama. He was also named Most Likely to Succeed and Sophomore Beau. During this time, Alan was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity.\n\nAfter leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before earning a degree.\n\nAfter a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with \"Epic Proportions.\" He quickly became a sought-after comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Tage (2000) and Ritter aus Leidenschaft (2001).\n\nIn 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly: Der Aufbruch der Serenity (2002). Although it lasted only eleven episodes, this may be Alan's most well-known and best-loved role. No other networks would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen version of the series. While awaiting the final news of Firefly's fate, Alan played the beloved Steve the Pirate in the movie Voll auf die N√ºsse (2004) and the voice of the robot Sonny in I, Robot (2004).\n\nIn 2005, Alan finally reprised the role of Wash in Serenity: Flucht in neue Welten (2005), the feature-film version of the series Firefly.
