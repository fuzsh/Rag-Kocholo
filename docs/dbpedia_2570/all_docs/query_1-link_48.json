        "text": "The Oregon Ducks were voted to their highest preseason ranking in the USA Today Coaches Poll in over a decade. This week, the publication released its preseason rankings, and the Oregon football program was voted into the Top three.\n\nOregon received 1228 points in the ranking system, falling just shy of No. 1 Georgia (46 first-place votes/1364 total points) and No. 1 Ohio State (seven first-place votes/1302 total points). The top ten is made up of Georgia, Ohio State, Oregon, Texas, Alabama, Ole Miss, Notre Dame, Michigan, Penn State, and Florida State.\n\nThe Ducks head into its first year in the Big Ten Conference this season, and the expanded league has six teams ranked inside the Top 25: Ohio State (2), Oregon (3), Michigan (8), Penn State (9), USC (23), and Iowa (25).\n\nDuring the 2024 season, the Ducks will play two ranked opponents in the preseason poll: Ohio State in Autzen Stadium in October and then on the road at Michigan in early November. Oregon opponents Washington, Boise State, Wisconsin, and Maryland also all received votes but were not included in the Top 25 rankings.\n\nThe last time Oregon was a preseason top-three team in the Coaches' Poll was back in 2013 when the Ducks were voted No. 3 going into the season. That year the Ducks finished the season 11-2 and won the Alamo Bowl. Oregon was also voted preseason No. 3 going into the 2011 season by the Coaches Poll. The Ducks finished that season 12-2 and they won the Rose Bowl.\n\n\"Certainly excited about the direction of our team, where we're headed,\" said Oregon head coach Dan Lanning earlier in fall camp. \"I feel like we have a healthy team right now. You talk about eliminating distractions, and that's really what a big part of these next few weeks is for our guys, is focusing on things that we can control, and what makes our team a great team this year.\""
