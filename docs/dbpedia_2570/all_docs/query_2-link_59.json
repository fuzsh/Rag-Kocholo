        "text": "brynismyname said:\n\nClearly she's not even bothering to try and be an opera singer any more. She always said she would never perform in an opera because her voice wasn't matured enough (which is nonsense, there are plenty of sopranos her age who perform in the opera)... yet she seems to have even given up releasing opera songs on her records, and her voice has got weaker if anything.\n\n- She was never an 'opera' singer. She was signed to Universal as a \"classical\" - not \"opera\" - artist, and was performing tracks written by Gary Barlow by 2007. Most of her recognisable performances are not arias.\n\n- She said a mezzo-soprano's voice fully develops at around the age of 30, and not much earlier, which is when most mezzo-soprano singers begin opera careers. This is a fairly well-established fact; a lot of younger mezzo-sopranos use microphones and backing tapes. She said she would consider taking an opera lead after she turned 30, which was in June 2010, but when you've just signed a massive Warner Music record deal, are touring the world, including arenas, and working on a new album with John Shanks et al, it's not going to be top of her priorities.\n\n- This is deliberately performed in her 'pop' voice, much like \"Tell Me I'm Not Dreaming\" from the \"Believe\" Platinum Edition. Warner signed her as a classical-contemporary crossover, in the vein of Michael Buble; her last album included covers of Evanescence, Queen and Sarah McLachlan as adult contemporary tracks, not necessarily classical. \"Daydream\" is in the same vein; it includes her performing in her 'pop' voice and classical voice, and the album is a mix of both: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Daydream-Katherine-Jenkins/dp/B005GU8ECK"
