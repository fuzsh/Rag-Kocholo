        "text": "By Jason M. Rubin\n\nIf you’re brave enough to dip your toes into a musical unknown, there are pleasures aplenty to be had in this recording, in which Joe Jackson takes us on what purports to be a musicological excavation of the works of a long-forgotten figure of the English Music Hall era.\n\nMore than any other rock performer — including such mercurial songwriters as Bob Dylan and Neil Young — Joe Jackson has been committed to confounding his fans throughout his career. Remember, this is the guy who set the standard for sneery new wave in the late ’70s, then veered off into reggae and dub, swing jazz and jump blues, Nuyorican, classical music, and musical theater, with occasional returns to rock. Jackson is no dilettante in any of these genres: he studied musical composition at London’s prestigious Royal Academy of Music on a merit scholarship. He also doesn’t seem to care whether any of these excursions are successful — he’s in it for the adventure, and his fans are welcome to come aboard or beg off as they wish.\n\nOn his newest album, with the absurdly complex title, Mr. Joe Jackson Presents: Max Champion in “What a Racket!”, Jackson takes us on what purports to be a musicological excavation of the works of a long-forgotten figure of the English Music Hall era, Max Champion. Music Hall — akin to America’s vaudeville in historical time frame, working-class origins, and variety of entertainments — is not a new mine for pop music; among others, Paul McCartney has had a long-held fascination with the form. What gives this project a particularly Jacksonian conceit is that Max Champion never existed. Jackson has made up an elaborate backstory to justify his desire to write and record 11 songs in this very old-fashioned stye, featuring cockney vocals, Gilbert & Sullivanesque patter, and backing by a small orchestra. But in fact there was no Champion (other than Jackson himself), and the one photo of him looks a lot like Jackson in disguise.\n\nDoes any of this matter? To my mind yes, because it actually drew me into an appreciation of what Jackson has accomplished here. I will admit I turned my nose up when I first heard the concept of the album and one track on YouTube about a month ago. When asked to review it, I envisioned saying that this musician I have admired for so long has finally made it impossible for his fans to follow him. Then I heard the album. It’s peculiar but delightful. Even at a modest 11 songs spanning 41 minutes, the fascination begins to wear off toward the end. But I expect repeated listenings may fix that. The best of the material, though, shows Jackson to be flexing brand new musical muscles. Unlike Jumpin’ Jive, his album paying tribute to Louis Jordan and Cab Calloway, Jackson has composed a set of songs that really feel authentic to the time period they are meant to convey — kind of like Eric Idle and Neil Innes’s brilliant Beatles parody, The Rutles.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why Jackson would be drawn to Music Hall. He and it share a certain bawdiness, humor, and keen interest in variety. Some of the tunes on this album feel like drinking songs, with the pints served by saucy, busty barmaids. The opening track, “Why, Why, Why?” is about the futility of life — but rather than be down about it, the singer exhorts all to drink and joke. Relentlessly tuneful, “The Sporting Life” pokes fun at Jackson’s own unathleticism. A couple of songs feature Gilbert & Sullivan–inspired tongue-twisting word salads; one, “Think of the Show,” is structurally and melodically similar to “Lord Chancellor’s Nightmare Song” (recorded by Todd Rundgren back in 1974) from the G&S comic opera Iolanthe.\n\nThe risqué aspects of Music Hall are on ribald display throughout. In a romantic-sounding waltz tune titled “The Shades of Night,” the singer walks the streets at night looking into people’s windows, hoping to peep at couples having sex. Jackson’s fillip at the end of the song is pretty delicious. Similarly, the ballad “Dear Old Mum” notes that “Mum” had 10 kids, who all were “happy and hygienic” — until they started dying one by one while Mum drank gin and turned tricks. But the song most laced with double entendres is “The Bishop and the Actress,” which features this verse:\n\nSaid the bishop to the actress, it’s you that I adore\n\nBut we mustn’t meet out in the street\n\nI’ll come in your back door\n\nSaid the actress to the bishop, proceed with caution there\n\nA man in your position\n\nMust take care\n\nThough the album stylistically brings forth the ghosts of Music Hall, sonically it resembles Jackson’s previous album, 2019’s Fool. As with that album, What a Racket! features a dark (or perhaps sepia-toned) atmospheric production that perhaps preserves the echoes of the era that our restlessly curious and creative hero is currently focusing on. The real question is where Jackson will go next. He apparently is planning to tour this album next year, so that question won’t be answered anytime soon. In the meantime, if you’re brave enough to dip your toes into a musical unknown, there are pleasures aplenty to be had in this recording. Whether or not there ever was a Max Champion, what’s important here is that there is indeed a Joe Jackson, who continues to challenge the lazy ears and programmed tastes of the listening public. After all these years, Jackson just wants to have fun, and that’s a good thing.\n\nNote: Jackson’s tour will land at the Wilbur in Boston on Tuesday, June 4, 2024. The evening promises an opening set by Jackson on his own, followed by a set featuring the new album backed by a nine-piece band."
