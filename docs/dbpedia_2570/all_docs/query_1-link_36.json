        "meta_description": "\"I used to see the old fellows in their 40s, talking about the book they were going to write someday. I was determined I was not going to be like that.\" David McCullough was encouraged by the success of his first book, The Johnstown Flood, but he was still faced with a difficult decision, to trade a steady and satisfying job for the insecurities of life as a full-time writer with a growing family to support. With his wife's encouragement, he took the plunge and has never looked back. Today he is a bestselling author, and one of America's most distinguished historians. He has received not one but two Pulitzer Prizes, for John Adams and for Truman, both biographies of U.S. presidents. He has also won two National Book Awards, for The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, and Mornings on Horseback, the story of young Theodore Roosevelt's struggle to manhood. His voice has long been familiar to public television audiences as the narrator of The Civil War and The Great Bridge (adapted from his own book on the building of the Brooklyn Bridge); his words have brought history to life for millions.",

        "text": "That’s a lot of typewriter ribbon.\n\nDavid McCullough: A lot of ribbon and a lot of overhauls over the years. Maybe the typewriter is writing the books, so maybe I better stay loyal to that one. It’s a marvelous machine. It’s a beautiful example of a great piece of machinery made in America.\n\nWas there a particular experience in your youth that you believe had a formative influence on you?\n\nDavid McCullough: One of my own children once said to me, “Pop, I don’t think you’re going to be a great writer, because you had such a wonderful childhood and all of our great writers have supposedly had miserable childhoods.” I had a marvelous childhood.\n\nI grew up in a family of four sons who are all quite different from each other and who all had very active interests. I have a brother who is a wonderful musician and very interested in the history of music. I have a brother who is a scientist and gifted in technology who builds computers for use under water in oceanographic studies. I have another brother who is a very good businessman and who has had a strong and important career in business.\n\nWe went to the public schools, and we had lots of friends, and we played on baseball teams and football teams, and ran on the track team, and all of that. I was in the dramatics at school, I worked on the newspaper. I thought I was going to be a painter. I drew the cartoons for the paper. I painted portraits. I sang in the glee club. I did all of that, and I loved all of it. I loved school, every day. It wasn’t cool to say you liked school, of course, but I did. And it was the same in college, and it’s been the same since.\n\nI think it’s very important not to typecast people and especially yourself. Because what you may be interested in now, or what you may show signs of ability in now may not be what you’re interested in later on, or may not be where your ability emerges later on.\n\nWhat books do you think influenced you when you were growing up?\n\nDavid McCullough: We had the classics, published by Scribners, all the great stories by Robert Louis Stevenson and the rest which were illustrated by the great N.C. Wyeth. In those days, when childhood diseases were extended, you were home with the measles or mumps or chicken pox for two or three weeks at a time, and you were supposed to stay in bed. There wasn’t any television, there wasn’t much to do, so I would stare at those paintings in those books by the hour. I didn’t read them all. I loved to just look at those pictures and study every detail. I could sit down and draw most of those pictures right now without having to refresh my memory because they were so exciting to me. I entered into that. “What was it like to have been there?” You know, those wonderful pictures in The Last of the Mohicans for example. And the imagination ran wild! Then I began reading, and I couldn’t read enough. I couldn’t stop. I read mostly fiction. I write history and biography, but for my own pleasure I read fiction, and poetry, and drama.\n\nWhat are your favorites?\n\nDavid McCullough: Oh, my. Almost all of Willa Cather, and Wallace Stegner, who I think is one of the literary giants of our time. I love to read mysteries. I love Dickens — who doesn’t love Dickens? — either on stage or movies, but more in the printed page. And, I love the theater. I saw Frank Fay in Harvey when the road company came to Pittsburgh. I saw Brando in Streetcar. I saw plays like Inherit the Wind, and I thought, “Look at the possibilities in history as drama!”\n\nAll of those things you wanted to be as a kid, you really can be as a historian, can’t you? You’re putting on a drama.\n\nDavid McCullough: Well you can. I don’t think you can underestimate the impact of the movies on my generation. I don’t think we’re going to understand that for a long time, but the movies were how we saw the world.\n\nWhen I said earlier I couldn’t wait to go to New York, it was because of the way New York was portrayed in the movies. When you got to New York, boy, you know, there it was. “You can do anything, be anything!” And it wasn’t all about work and manufacturing and business, which really was what Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was primarily about. And the heroes of those movies — very important to understand that — the Henry Fonda characters, the Spencer Tracy characters, real heroes. And Jimmy Stewart! I think Jimmy — If I were to ask who most influenced me, maybe it was Jimmy Stewart, the parts he played and the way he was. And of course the fact that he came from Western Pennsylvania, which is not very far from where I grew up.\n\nThere’s a resemblance, too.\n\nDavid McCullough: Oh, you think so? Oh, that’s a wonderful compliment. His father ran a hardware store and he went off to Princeton, and my father had an electrical supply business and I got to go to Yale, and I thought that’s fine. But, you see…\n\nJimmy Stewart — the part Jimmy Stewart is playing — is very important. He’s almost always playing the same part, and that is the seemingly ordinary, decent American who — when put to the test in an extreme situation — rises to the occasion and does the extraordinary. And that’s an old, old story in our American way of life. In fact, it’s the story of Harry Truman, which is what I’ve spent the largest part of my creative writing life working on, a project of 10 years. That’s the story of Harry Truman, the seemingly ordinary fellow who — put to the test — rises to the occasion and does the extraordinary. And, I think we like that story because that’s the story of our country.\n\nWe are all, in effect, ordinary people who have been given an extraordinary opportunity and presented, therefore, with an extraordinary problem. Can we rise to the occasion and be extraordinary? We had the Founding Fathers, who set this very idealistic, lofty, aspiring set of rules, and guidelines, and design for the ultimate culture, civilization, way of life we were going to create here, and then they leave the stage. Can we live up to the promise of their concept?\n\nAnd that’s the story of the Brooklyn Bridge. The father has the dream of this extraordinary bridge, this unprecedented bridge. He is killed. He dies at the very beginning. His son has to take over. Can he carry out the father’s exceptional, idealistic conception? Those early Founders of our country, in a way, set the bar — if you’ve ever been a high jumper — set the bar very high. Can we — are we up to jumping that high? And if we don’t, that’s all right. We’re at least trying.\n\nWhat does the American Dream mean to you?\n\nDavid McCullough: I think the American dream is the good society. It’s the city on the hill. It’s what the Founding Fathers talked about, where justice is a way of life, where fundamental rights of citizenship are honored, where the individual counts, but where pulling together in the spirit of all being in the same boat can achieve more than any individual can in isolation or independently. I think it means education. This country was founded on the idea that education for all — education at its best — is not just good for the individual, it’s essential to the system. The system won’t work unless we have an educated population. Democracy demands it. It’s the old line in Jefferson: “Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free, expects what never was and never will be.”\n\nIn education, you find yourself. When you go to college, and later when you decide about graduation school or vocation, don’t limit your focus. It would be as if you walked into a wonderful buffet banquet, and you took your plate, and you went up and filled the plate with the first thing you saw because it looked so good. Look it all over. Sample a little bit of everything for as long as you can, because that’s why you’re going to college. And when you finish college, that’s just the beginning. It doesn’t stop. It keeps on going.\n\nIf your experience is anything like mine, the most important books you’re going to read in your life you’re going to read after college. The most important and inspiring people you’re going to meet in life are going to come after college. The windows, the doors will be flung open for you in college by very fine people, and that certainly happened to me.\n\nWhen I got to Yale, I had the privilege, the exciting experience of being one of the students of Vincent Scully. He was simply magnificent for generations of Yale undergraduates, because he opened up the doors. He opened up our eyes to so much more than we ever had had before, and that keeps on happening right through life. It’s like gravity, it’s accelerative, and it’s fueled by curiosity. It’s fueled by our innate human desire to know, to experience, and to be lifted out of ourselves — both our physical selves, and by the limitations of our biological clocks — to a much larger world.\n\nTime and place. You, all of us, each of us, is limited to how much time we have on Earth by the biological clock. Now do we want, therefore, to have the experience of being alive constrained to that time only? No. It would be like saying, “You live there. You must stay in that one spot where you are in space all of your life.” So you are no more required to stay in one spot in time than you are in space and that time travel you can do is in history. It’s in the past, which is the larger experience of humankind on Earth. And the past isn’t just history in the usual literal sense. It’s music, art, history. It’s culture, language, culture, and you can experience all of that, the more you know, because you can go back as far as you want, out as far as you want, and suddenly you’re infinitely more alive, and that’s what history is about. History is about life, about people.\n\nI think what we must do in education, for example, is to bring the lab techniques used in science to the teaching of the humanities, to the teaching of history, and English, and journalism, and the arts. That’s the great thing about the arts. You don’t learn to paint, except by painting. You don’t learn to play the piano, except by playing the piano. By the same token, I think you become an historian, I think you become a scholar by being required to do original scholarly work, original detective work of a kind that’s involved with doing scholarly research. And once you do that, once you get on that track, you catch the bug, and you find out that this is really exciting.\n\nNow scientists know that, and scientists know that when they teach science. But in English, in the humanities, I think we’re behind on it. And make no mistake, the humanities are immensely important, and the arts are immensely important, and this decline in the teaching of the arts and the humanities in our school system — particularly our public school system, and in the grade schools of our country — is a disgrace. It’s a shame. We’re cheating our children. And the idea that the arts are any less important, any less vital to a culture than history or mathematics or science is a dangerous misconception; bad for the country, bad for our way of life because all of these things are an extension of the experience of being alive.\n\nThank you very much. It’s been a great pleasure talking with you.\n\nDavid McCullough: You’re welcome."
