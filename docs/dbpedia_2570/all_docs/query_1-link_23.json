        "text": "6 New Paperbacks to Read This Week\n\nOn the hunt for your next read? Barack Obama’s memoir “A Promised Land” is out in paperback, along with an investigation into cobalt mining in Congo, a philosophical defense of failure and more.\n\nHere are six paperbacks we recommend →\n\nMy Name Is Iris, by Brando Skyhorse\n\nIris Prince, the conservative Mexican American woman who narrates this novel, is “sardonic and ruthless in her observations,” our reviewer wrote. When she moves to a mostly white suburb after a divorce, a wall inexplicably grows in her front yard, getting taller each night, undermining both her belief in the rules and her relationship with America.\n\nA Promised Land, by Barack Obama\n\nWhen this first volume of Barack Obama’s presidential memoirs was published, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie praised it, writing that “it is not merely that this book avoids being ponderous, as might be expected, even forgiven, of a hefty memoir, but that it is nearly always pleasurable to read.”\n\nCobalt Red: How the Blood of the Congo Powers Our Lives, by Siddharth Kara\n\n“Few nations are blessed with a more diverse abundance of resource riches than the Congo. No country in the world has been more severely exploited,” Kara writes early in this investigation into the abuses of people and the environment endemic to cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a process that powers the lithium batteries in iPhones.\n\nAs Rich as the King: A Tale of Casablanca, by Abigail Assor; translated by Natasha Lehrer\n\nThis prizewinning romance, first published in France, follows Sarah, a poor teenage French expat, and Driss, a wealthy Moroccan, as they navigate Casablanca’s alleys along with barriers of class and nationality.\n\n.\n\nThe Crow Valley Karaoke Championships, by Ali Bryan\n\nA year earlier, forest fires claimed the life of a local karaoke legend. Now, the town of Crow Valley is hosting a karaoke competition in his memory, but between a prison break and the conflicting goals of its attendees, all might not go according to plan. Our reviewer called this novel “part antic farce, part character study” and “a thoroughly fun read.”\n\nIn Praise of Failure: Four Lessons in Humility, by Costica Bradatan\n\nAnalyzing failure in social, spiritual and other spheres of life, a philosopher argues in favor of letting it lead us to humility. Our critic Jennifer Szalai found it absorbing, “even — or especially — when I felt uncomfortable with its implications.”\n\nRead more books news:\n\nIf the Vicious Drug Lord Doesn’t Get Them, the Deadly Storm Might\n\nBrenda Wineapple Has Come Around on Historical Fiction\n\n1 of 8\n\nItem 1 of 8\n\n1 of 8"
