        "text": "2005 single by the Game\n\n\"Dreams\" is a song by American rapper the Game, from his debut album, The Documentary. It was released as the fifth official single from the album in all territories except France, which saw \"Higher\" released there first. The song was produced by Kanye West and features a sample of \"No Money Down\" by soul music singer Jerry Butler. The song is dedicated to Yetunde Price (the elder half-sister of tennis stars Serena Williams and Venus Williams), who was shot dead on September 14, 2003; the Williams' also came from the Game's hometown of Compton, California. The lyrics cite the Dr. Dre album 2001 being released \"in 2001\", when it was actually released in 1999. The song was placed 5th on About.com's Best Hip-Hop Songs of 2005.\n\n\"Dreams\" debuted at No. 97 and peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The single was also commercially successful in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe music video was directed by Phillip Atwell and it features cameos by R&B singer and actress Mýa, Dr. Dre, veteran singer Jim Gilstrap and comedian Michael Colyar. It also features graffiti that memorializes the deceased artists and historical figures mentioned in the song.\n\nAaliyah Dana Haughton (January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001)\n\nLisa Nicole Lopes (Left Eye) (May 27, 1971 – April 25, 2002)\n\nJam Master Jay (January 21, 1965 – October 30, 2002)\n\nYetunde Price (August 9, 1972 – September 14, 2003)\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968)\n\nTupac Shakur (June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996)\n\nHuey Percy Newton (February 17, 1942 – August 22, 1989)\n\nEric Lynn Wright (Eazy-E) (September 7, 1964 – March 26, 1995)\n\nChristopher Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.)

It is a mix between \"Dreams\" and \"A Dream\", which is a track featuring the Notorious B.I.G. from Jay-Z's 2002 album The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse. It combines a chopped and screwed version of B.I.G.'s a cappella verse on \"A Dream\" (which is Juicy's first verse) with the instrumental of \"Dreams\".\n\nThere is also another official remix of the song with Trey Songz in which Trey Songz sings the second verse.\n\nAn unreleased version of Dreams leaked onto the internet in October 2011. This version features similar lyrics to the final version with revised themes and content, with the Game reflecting on events in his own life as opposed to reflecting on the legacies left by rap legends. It leaked labeled as \"Original Version\".\n\n\"Dreams\" (Album version)\n\n\"Dreams\" (Live from Dublin)\n\n\"Dreams\" (Instrumental)\n\n\"Dreams\" (Video)\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales United Kingdom (BPI)[22] Silver 200,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone."
