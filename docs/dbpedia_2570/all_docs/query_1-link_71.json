        "text": "WATERLOO – Last year’s two Yates Cup finalists do battle again on Saturday, September 24, as the No. 3 Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks (3-0) host the McMaster Marauders (2-1) at University Stadium in The Score Television Network’s second week of University Rush, presented by Wilson Sports Equipment (broadcast time is 2:00pm ET).\n\nThese two rivals last met in the Ontario University Athletics championship game on Nov. 13, 2004, which the hometown Golden Hawks won 31-19 for their first Yates Cup victory since 1991. Laurier narrowly came out on top when the two programs played in the regular season, a 34-33 thriller in Waterloo in week four. The Golden Hawks rallied to score 10 points in the final 5:06 of that meeting, capped off with a 25-yard field goal by Brian Devlin (Sarnia, ON) with just 24 seconds left in the game.\n\nFor McMaster, this week’s match-up has major implications as they failed to earn a spot in the Canadian Interuniversity Sport Top 10 this week for the first time since September 15, 1998. The Marauders need to rebound both physically and psychologically after suffering a 55-31 defeat last Saturday at the hands of the Western Mustangs. Western overcame an early 28-3 deficit to score 45 unanswered points and run away from a shocked McMaster team. Third-year quarterback Adam Archibald (Kingston, ON) was forced out of the game after taking a big hit in the second half and his status is currently listed as day-to-day.\n\nThe Marauders looked impressive in building the 25-point lead over Western, particularly Archibald, who completed 13 of 22 passes for 257 yards and a pair of touchdown strikes to Rob Serviss (Waterloo, ON) and BJ Malott (Kitchener, ON). But McMaster’s defense, which allowed an OUA-low 119 points in eight regular season games combined last year, struggled against the high-powered Mustangs offence, despite producing a 35-yard fumble recovery touchdown from defensive end Jeff Robertshaw (Hamilton, ON) in the opening quarter. McMaster has given up 95 points in the first three games of 2005 but a better effort against the powerful Golden Hawks would put them right back on track in the OUA race.\n\nLaurier enters the game ranked among the elite teams in the nation with three straight wins out of the gate (now 13 in a row in regular season play), the latest coming in Saturday’s 21-14 road win over the Ottawa Gee-Gees to spoil homecoming for the hosts from the nation’s capital. Fifth-year quarterback Ryan Pyear (Belleville, ON), a 2nd Team CIS All-Canadian in 2004, has been a rock for head coach Gary Jeffries’s talented team. Pyear has passed for 627 yards with seven touchdowns and just a single interception in Laurier’s three victories over Queen’s, Windsor and Ottawa. Running back Nick Cameron (Waterloo, ON), ranked second in the CIS with 405 rushing yards, has averaged 135 yards and a touchdown over three games, while Joel Wright (Stoney Creek, ON) has hauled in four touchdown passes to pace the receiving corps. Linebacker Anthony Maggiacomo (Cambridge, ON) leads the team with 12 solo tackles and one assisted tackle.\n\nLast season’s two big wins proved that the Golden Hawks have gotten over the hump with their nemesis from Hamilton. Before defeating McMaster in both the regular season and title games, Laurier had lost five consecutive times to the Marauders, including two defeats in the Yates Cup (2000 and 2003).\n\nThe Score Television Network Ltd.
