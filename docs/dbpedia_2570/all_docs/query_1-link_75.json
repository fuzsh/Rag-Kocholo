        "text": "SingEd Sheeran\n\n\"Sing\" was inspired by a girl that Ed Sheeran met in Las Vegas in the summer of 2013, when \"one thing led to another and now she's kissing my mouth.\"\n\nContagiousThe Isley Brothers\n\nThe Isley Brother's song, \"Contagious,\" peaked at #19 on the Billboard Hot 100. This meant that the band of brothers became the first group to score a Top 50 hit in six consecutive decades on the chart.\n\nYellow LedbetterPearl Jam\n\nEddie Vedder often changes the words when he sings \"Yellow Ledbetter.\" The basic story is about a guy whose brother dies in the first Gulf War. Apparently, bad news in the army is delivered in yellow envelopes.\n\nUnder The BridgeRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers' biggest hit is \"Under The Bridge,\" a ballad not typical of their sound. Frontman Anthony Kiedis wrote the lyric after an acute bout of loneliness.\n\nFoxy LadyJimi Hendrix\n\nJimi Hendrix opened for The Monkees on their 1967 tour, and it did not go well. The young, mostly female crowd shouted \"Davy\" when Hendrix sang the word \"Lady\" in \"Foxy Lady\" in honor of who they came to see: Monkees lead singer Davy Jones.\n\nThe PhoenixFall Out Boy\n\nFall Out Boy's \"The Phoenix\" samples the classical work \"Allegro Non Troppo,\" which was composed by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1941. Vocalist Patrick Stump was inspired by \"the creepiness\" of the strings.\n\nMacabre Mother Goose: The Dark Side of Children's SongsSong Writing\n\n\"London Bridge,\" \"Ring Around the Rosie\" and \"It's Raining, It's Pouring\" are just a few examples of shockingly morbid children's songs.\n\nBenny MardonesSongwriter Interviews\n\nHis song \"Into The Night\" is one of the most-played of all time. For Benny, it took him to hell and back.\n\nRamonesFact or Fiction\n\nA band so baffling, even their names were contrived. Check your score in the Ramones version of Fact or Fiction.\n\nTim McIlrath of Rise AgainstSongwriter Interviews\n\nRise Against frontman Tim McIlrath explains the meanings behind some of their biggest songs and names the sci-fi books that have influenced him.\n\nJason Newsted (ex-Metallica)Songwriter Interviews\n\nThe former Metallica bassist talks about his first time writing a song with James Hetfield, and how a hand-me-down iPad has changed his songwriting."
