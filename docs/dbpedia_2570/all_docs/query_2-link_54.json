        "text": "At the age of 24 Katherine Jenkins was propelled to international acclaim. Upon the launch of her debut album, Premiere, the world sat up and listened to crisp, clean tone of the Neath born Operatic vocalist. Since then she has shown that there is more to her artistry than meets the eye. From collaborations with Darcey Bussell to her recent strikingly diverse appearance on The Masked Singer, she always delivers the goods, but we always want her to return with a new album of classically reworked musical numbers.\n\nThankfully the wait is over as she delivers her thirteenth studio album, Cinema Paradiso. As the title suggests, this is a collection that leans of cinematic inspiration and was headed up by the rather wonderful reworking of the effortlessly magical When You Wish Upon A Star.\n\nWith the Pinocchio classic opening the new album, Jenkins does not solely deliver the timeless Disney magic, but pulls together a collection that visits West Side Story, A Star Is Born and Schindler's List. Each song that she reworks into her own inimitable style is tenderly approached, with an air of faithfulness to the original, while sprinkling a rather healthy dose of her own magical dust.\n\nWhile the Luke Evans duet Somewhere/Tonight is a clear stand-out moment within the collection, with its closest competition coming from a faultless rendition of Moon River, Jenkins manages to bring something special to each of the albums 15 tracks."
