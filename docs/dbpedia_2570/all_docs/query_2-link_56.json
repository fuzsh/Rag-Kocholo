        "text": "I’ve been working with London Institute of Contemporary Christianity (LICC) on a project called Changing the Soundtrack. We’re trying to sing songs in church that fully reflect our theology, so we don’t forget about our 9-5, the context we live in and the rest of our lives outside of Sunday morning. 'We seek your kingdom’, which was released last year, and was certainly an attempt to do that.\n\nI was talking to Mark Greene, who wrote The Servant Queen ten years ago, and we thought: It will be a very painful time when the Queen passes - actually quite a wobbly time, both psychologically and spiritually, for the nation. We decided it might be good to create something that would give voice to people’s feelings and call them to prayer.\n\n'Tears and celebrations' is not just a song about the Queen, but a hymn to God in praise and worship of him, thanks to him, and then grieving and lament to him.\n\nIt was quite strange to think of writing something that, to be honest, might only be sung by people for two or three weeks, but we felt it would do a really important job in the moment we’re in right now.\n\nMany people will know the beautiful melody we’ve set the words to, as it is the famous Welsh tune of 'Here is love vast as the ocean’.\n\nI was just sitting at the piano one day playing that tune, and these words started to form:\n\nWe see tears and celebration,\n\nFor this life so dignified,\n\nBearing thanks and hearts of sadness,\n\nTo the God of death and life.\n\nAs he takes her to his promise,\n\nOf an audience with the King,\n\nWe remember all she gave us,\n\nWreaths of gratitude we bring.\n\nIn these days of change and trial,\n\nBe the rock on which we stand,\n\nWhen we fear in this new season,\n\nHold us firmly in your hands.\n\nMay we rise to her example,\n\nTo be humble, kind and fair,\n\nSwift to pray and slow to anger,\n\nChoosing faith and not despair.\n\nIn the midst of coronation,\n\nShe once knelt in silent prayer,\n\nOil was poured in Christ’s commission,\n\nCalled to lead her people there.\n\nMay we know that same anointing,\n\nMove in royal authority,\n\nThen speak liberty and healing,\n\nTo a world in need of peace.\n\nLord forgive, when pride and envy,\n\nLeave our nation bruised and stained,\n\nTurn us back towards our calling,\n\nTo make your name great again.\n\nMay we rise above divisions,\n\nLord, our brokenness we bring,\n\nThat a more united kingdom,\n\nWould give glory to the King.\n\nWhen our days are at their dimming,\n\nAnd our work on earth is done,\n\nMay we hear as does our sovereign,\n\n‘Faithful servant, welcome home.’\n\nMay we rise with Christ to witness,\n\nA new heav’n and earth displayed,\n\nOurs a robe that will not tarnish,\n\nHers a crown that will not fade.\n\nAlternate Verse 4 for Commonwealth:\n\nWe beheld her sure compassion,\n\nFor the last and for the least,\n\nStraddling races, tribes and nations,\n\nForging bonds of family.\n\nMay this commonwealth now echo,\n\nThe wide kingdom of our King.\n\nReconciled through Christ who suffered,\n\nAll our stories we will bring.\n\nWe had to make some calls pretty quickly after hearing the news of the Queen's death last Thursday. But this incredible, stellar list of professionals came together: the world-renowned singer Katherine Jenkins, an amazing filmmaker Andy Hutch, the wonderful maestro Jazz pianist Mark Edwards and the producer who has worked on much of what the Church has listened to over the past 30 years, Neil Costello.\n\nWhen we all arrived in Wiston Chapel to record the audio and make the video, it was a very profound moment; it was like a turning of the seasons.\n\nI think all of us are experiencing different things right now. Mark Edwards, who arranged the track, did so through the night in the 12 hours after the Queen's death. So for him, it was an incredibly emotional, responsive act.\n\nThis song calls us all to our knees at this time - to ask for God’s favour and blessing, and to seek his forgiveness for when we, as a nation, have gone away from what he’s called us to.\n\nI’m reminded of the scripture that says: \"If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves…” (2 Chronicles 7:14) As a nation, we’ve not always been great at humility. And I wonder whether this season might call us to a greater level of humility? If the events of the prayer breakfast are anything to go by, it shows that actually, sometimes there’s a response when we come in humility."
