        "text": "Every day, the federal government enacts impactful policy changes through the executive branch and its agencies. The Brookings Center on Regulation and Markets Regulatory Tracker (“Reg Tracker”) provides background information and status updates on a curated selection of particularly important regulatory changes. Using our tracker, you can learn more about the background of different rules, discover the impact of potential regulations, and monitor a regulation’s progress through rulemaking. We include standard rules as well as guidance documents, executive orders, and other actions across ten key policy areas. While the relaunched Reg Tracker focuses on regulatory changes enacted under Biden, our previous entries tracking regulatory changes during the Trump administration can be accessed through the “Trump archives” checkbox.\n\nFor a more thorough explanation of the Reg Tracker, including an overview of the rulemaking process, guidance on how to use the Reg Tracker’s interactive features, and an explanation of how entries are selected, click here. For regular updates from the Reg Tracker and new research from the Center on Regulation and Markets, subscribe to our newsletter."
