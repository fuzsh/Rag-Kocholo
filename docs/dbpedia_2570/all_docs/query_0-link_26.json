Although often grouped with the much broader category of “reality” programmes, this is not a book about reality television in general. “Reality” television includes a wide range of sub-genres that include a variety of fly-on-the-wall style filming of situations that are either naturally occurring in locations such as hotels, airports, holiday resorts, retail outlets, and so on, or are contrived by television producers and confined to fixed location indoor and outdoor sets. Another critical feature of the shows being put under the spotlight here is their competitive element. People enter them in the hope of winning a prize. The prize might be money, a job or new career opportunity, or, for many contestants, simply the exposure they get. Even so, the book will not look at all reality competition-based programmes. Instead, its analysis will centre on how these shows enable participants to demonstrate a specific type or range of abilities, and on who survives the different kinds of endurance tests these shows represent and comes to be liked best by viewers at home. From this review of contestants’ performance, we will also look at what kind of legacy they take away from the show. Did their lives change? Or did they return to their normal lives (whatever “normality” may have been for them)? The notion of “talent” is also a critical concept here in the selection of the shows for examination. It defines a specific type of reality show that features “real” people, but which also requires them to demonstrate an ability, aptitude or skill of a particular kind that is relevant to a specific end-goal. That end-goal, within the context of the programme, is to win the competition. The talent in question might entail some kind of performance art, physical appearance, practical skill or entrepreneurship. After the show, contestants might then go on to pursue a new life. This\n\n2\n\nChapter One\n\ntype of outcome can be true of other “reality” shows—such as The Big Brother franchise—in which participants have to simply endure without showing any special talent. These shows will not feature as part of the analysis presented here because they are not primarily defined by a “talent contest” element. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, talent shows have come to dominate the mainstream (and many minor) television schedules. Many of these shows have centred on finding new entertainers, especially in popular music. The shows themselves have often grown into internationally traded franchises that are televised all round the world. The best known, and most talked about, include the Popstars, Pop Idol, X Factor and The Voice franchises. Other competition formats have also become highly popular that have involved finding new talent for the fashion industry (Next Top Model), cooking (MasterChef), and the business world (The Apprentice).\n\nThe Value of Reality TV Shows The growth of reality television programming has created a new stock of non-unionised and cheaply employed performers that has diversified the pool of “talent” for the medium and resulted in economies to employment costs.1 Reality television has brought about some radical restructuring of the traditional media entertainment businesses. This effect has been felt around the world where the old unionised agreements in American and other film and television industries have evolved to accommodate more flexible employment practices.2 There are some performers who appear in reality TV shows and who entered because they saw it as a pathway to fame and traditional forms of “celebrity”. Some of these contestants actually achieved their ambitions—although the longevity of their new career has varied. The focus of this book is on those contestants who entered competitions leading to a specific career path. The career tracks focused on here are popular music, general entertainment, fashion modelling, professional cookery and the world of business. These shows have transformed the face of popular television and challenged the dominance of soap operas and major sports events in the audience ratings. They have attracted widespread media coverage and 1 Collins, S. (2008) Making the most out of 15 minutes: reality TV’s dispensable celebrity. Television & New Media, 9(2), 87-110. 2 Carter, B. (2003) Reality shows alter the way to do business. New York Times, January 24th. A1, C14.\n\nCareer Capital of Reality TV Talent Competitions\n\n3\n\nbecome not only highly popular sources of entertainment but also sources of stories in the mainstream news media that have further served to boost the public profile of each show and many of its contestants. The emergence of modern formats of competition shows, featuring established celebrities and celebrity wannabes in which the progress of contestants through the contest is largely determined by public vote, has created an impression of increased audience involvement in programming and, more especially, of an empowerment of viewers to determine televised competition outcomes.3 Although this observation may have some resonance with what is taking place, it would be naïve to presume that producers have relinquished all control over their cultural commodities. The popular trend of reality television is driven by conventional economic imperatives.4 The illusion of audience empowerment has been driven by the interactive nature of some of the competition talent shows, which has allowed viewers to take part in determining the outcomes for performers. In the popular music and entertainment franchises such as Pop Idol, The X Factor, The Voice and (America’s/Britain’s) Got Talent, for instance, it is the viewers’ votes that ultimately determine who wins. Of course, the producers do not relinquish all their control over how the competition unfolds. They can determine the power that expert judging panels are given to decide certain outcomes. The judges make the initial selections before the contest is thrown open to the public vote. The producers can also influence public feelings about contestants through the kind of backstory they have; the ways they are filmed and through the nature of spinoff publicity that is released to the news media about them. How much the audience at home likes specific contestants can, therefore, be subtly manipulated by television producers.5 Although ultimately reality TV shows benefit the producers in relevant economic terms, they can hand over to the public a degree of power that viewers would not normally be able to exert with other television genres. The fact that these shows feature apparently “ordinary” people invites 3 Enli, G. S.

This can be a powerful factor, and did not originate with televised reality talent competitions. Traditional television quiz and game shows featured members of the public as contestants and their degree of success in the show would depend upon their own performance. People at home might identify with them because they were ordinary people like themselves. With these shows, however, the viewers could not generally influence the outcome. This last point has also applied to many televised competition talent contests where the winners were selected by an “expert” judging panel. The empowerment of the viewers’ vote, however, can mean that competitors might survive longer than their performances warranted if they are very popular with the audience. In this context, it is interesting to recall the progress of news correspondent John Sergeant in the BBC’s popular Strictly Come Dancing contest. Even to an unseasoned eye, Sergeant was clearly one of the worst dancers in the competition, and yet he lasted longer than competitors who received higher scores in the studio from the expert judging panel because viewers at home voted for him in sufficiently large numbers. When it became clear that some judges felt he should be ejected from the competition and cast doubt on the viewers’ judgements, this created a setting in which the public engaged in a campaign to keep Sergeant in the competition, regardless of the quality of his dancing. Although this outcome worked against the show’s ethos of discovering the best natural dancing talent from amongst previously untrained celebrities, it also benefited the value of the show by attracting a huge amount of spin-off publicity in the media more generally.6 Reality talent contests have also been found to have further, though limited, spin-off economic benefits for other worlds of performance, such as the theatre, with some of these televised competitions finding new performers to star in re-runs of tired music theatre shows. One report by the Society of London Theatre found that although television talent contest shows such as How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?, I’d Do Anything, and Any Dream Will Do, that auditioned contestants for theatre productions managed by Lord (Andrew) Lloyd Webber and televised by the BBC had been criticised by the theatre elite, they had been instrumental in bringing new audiences into the theatre. New London West End shows such as “The Sound of Music”, “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” and “Oliver”, which had been cast through television talent shows, had drawn in newer, younger audiences; but there 6 See Enli, G. (2009) op.cit.\n\nCareer Capital of Reality TV Talent Competitions\n\n5\n\nwas less positive evidence that these audiences subsequently went to see more traditional theatre performances.7 Despite the hopes of their contestants, the main beneficiaries of television talent shows overall are their producers and the networks that transmit them. Some of these shows have been proven to attract large audiences for their networks which, in turn, are translated into healthy advertising revenues or market shares that justify public funding. As we will see, however, many of these shows tend to have a limited shelf life and some lose audiences quickly and dramatically once their novelty with viewers at home has worn off. These shows need to be constantly refreshed and, ultimately, they must consistently recruit talented and interesting contestants who are likeable. The contemporary versions of reality talent shows in the twenty-first century have also proven to be profitable for their production companies through widespread international sales of their formats. In this book, we will examine eight franchises. All eight have been sold around the world. At the time of writing this book, in 2013, the most successful franchise so far in terms of the number of television markets in which it is shown has been Next Top Model (52 markets); followed by Got Talent (51), Pop Idol (47), The Voice (45), The X Factor (41), Popstars (37), MasterChef (35) and The Apprentice (28).8 The popularity of these shows means that the eventual winners, and often many of those contestants who reach the final stages, receive a great deal of personal publicity and attain instant celebrity status. For some, this dramatic rise to fame can prove difficult to handle. These shows have been criticised for not preparing contestants properly for the attention that is to come. This outcome can be especially problematic for very young contestants. In the popular music- and entertainment-themed franchises such as Pop Idol, entrants can be as young as 16, while in others such as The X Factor 7 Smith, A.

Viewers of the first season of The X Factor in the United States in 2011 will have seen 13-year-old Rachel Crow break down in hysterics after the judges voted her off the show. Despite finishing in a respectable fifth place, in a competition that featured some very talented adult competitors, she had been led to believe by those close to her that she would win and was desperately upset when she found out she would not. Another episode occurred during the semi-finals of variety talent show, Britain’s Got Talent, when 10-year-old singer Hollie Steel was reduced to tears when she forgot the words of her song. She was initially told she could not perform again, but this decision was later reversed by the show’s creator and panel judge, Simon Cowell. The incident, however, led to widespread calls, including from the UK government’s Secretary of State for Culture Andy Burnham, for a minimum age restriction to be introduced for such shows.9 Established artists have also criticised these talent show formats for putting children under excessive pressure and providing short-cuts to success that some believe ought to be earned over a longer period.10 Careers of this kind need to be nurtured over time, and there is a view among some purists that true artists commit themselves to hard work with little or no reward because of their passion for the craft. Critics claim that television talent shows circumvent this type of apprenticeship and, in turn, undermine the kind of commitment needed to develop and then sustain a successful career in the entertainment business. In one report, Elton John was quoted as saying, “I’m not a fan of talent shows. I probably wouldn’t have lasted if I’d gone on one.” He argued that shows such as The X Factor had little to do with cultivating musical talent. “I like Simon Cowell, but what he does is entertainment. TV vaults you to superstardom and then you have to back it up, which is hard.”11\n\n9 Singh, Anita. (2009, 5th June) Britain’s Got Talent: Government launches review into child performers.

Accessed 9th April 2013.\n\nCareer Capital of Reality TV Talent Competitions\n\n7\n\nIn response to criticisms about “instant stardom” some of the contestants—especially the older ones—have argued that they have served their time with low-level careers and equally low earnings, and that their commitment to music, for instance, was often subsidised by doing other menial work.12 What the Got Talent, Idol, X Factor franchises provide are new platforms to help such artists break through when traditional routes have drawn a blank. The big question, perhaps, is whether these shows do actually deliver what the contestants hope for. For sure, celebrity status is there for the taking. But even the talentless can achieve a few moments of fame, if they are quirky enough when they appear on these shows, simply by virtue of the size of the audiences that are watching. However, does lasting career success follow for many contestants? This is the question that lies at the heart of this book. It presents an analysis of outcomes for contestants of selected, contemporary television talent shows. The auditioning themes we will focus on are those for entry into careers in popular music as recording artists, in wider forms of entertainment (and not just in music), in fashion as models, in cooking as professional cooks or chefs, and in business as entrepreneurs. The popular music shows placed under the microscope here are Popstars, Pop Idol, The X Factor and The Voice. The entertainment shows are from the Got Talent franchise. The fashion industry shows comprise the Next Top Model franchise. The cookery theme focuses on the MasterChef franchise, with some references to other shows in this area. The business theme focuses on The Apprentice franchise. Versions of these shows have been selected for close analysis from the United States and United Kingdom, and, in the case of popular music and cooking, also from Australia.\n\nHistory of Television Talent Shows—America Most of the contemporary talent programmes have featured among the most watched shows on television. Despite claims often made by their founders that they represent fresh departures in televised entertainment, talent contests had formed part of mainstream television schedules for many decades before the Got Talents, Pop Idols, X Factors and Apprentices had even been conceived. In fact, many of these earlier shows sowed the seeds of the formats used by the productions that populate our television screens in the twenty-first century. 12 Thompson, Gayle.

Accessed 11th July 2013.\n\n8\n\nChapter One\n\nIn America, a number of talent competitions were televised from the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s and 1960s. These programmes were highly popular with the audiences of the time and discovered and nurtured new and emergent talent. Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts ran for ten years from 1948 to 1958 on the CBS TV network. It had previously been broadcast on radio. The show ran to a simple formula: talent scouts discovered new artists and brought them to New York, from where the show was televised. Here, they went through off-air auditions, with a few being chosen to appear on the show. Each act was rated by a studio audience applause meter, and the contestant whose performance moved the dial the highest won the show. The show was successful in discovering a number of singers who went on to become major performing and recording artists, including Tony Bennett, Pat Boone, Lenny Bruce, Patsy Cline, Rosemary Clooney, and Steve Lawrence.13 Another radio talent show that migrated across to television, and ran for even longer, from 1948 to 1970, was The Original Amateur Hour. It had started on radio in 1934. Once established on television, with its presenter, Ted Mack; it became known as Ted Mack’s Original Amateur Hour. In terms of diversity of its performers, this show was similar to the contemporary Got Talent contests: while singers could compete in this show, they were featured alongside acrobats and jugglers, comedians, dancers, instrumental musicians, magicians and others. The best-known discoveries from this show included Ann-Marget, Irene Cara, Gladys Knight and Jim Stafford. A cluster of other early talent shows appeared during this same era that had short life spans of only a season or two. These included Talent Jackpot in 1949, Henry Morgan’s Great Talent Hunt in 1951, and The Talent Shop in 1951–1952. Talent Jackpot was shown on the DuMont TV network, and aired for just five weeks. There was also a one-off summer show. Contestants competed for a money prize and the outcome was decided by studio audience applause. Henry Morgan’s Great Talent Hunt appeared on NBC and featured people who had unusual abilities. Henry Morgan was well known to American TV audiences in the early 1950s as a regular panellist on TV game shows such as What’s My Line? The Talent Show was another DuMont network production that aired for just less than six months. It was co-hosted by Fred Robbins and Pat Adair who auditioned young people in a New York drugstore.14 13 David Weinstein. (2004) The Forgotten Network: DuMont and the Birth of American Television. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. 14 Tom Brooks and Earle Marsh. (1964) The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows. 3rd. ed. New York, NY: Ballantine Books.\n\nCareer Capital of Reality TV Talent Competitions\n\n9\n\nOne of the best-known early talent shows was The Gong Show, which ran on NBC from 1976 to 1980. The show is well known for its notoriety involving its run-ins with censors, as much as for the audiences it attracted. The decision to transmit it in the middle of the day meant that its ratings would always be modest compared with those of peak-time shows. The show is also interesting because its judging format bears a striking resemblance to those used by a number of contemporary television talent shows. The Gong Show was hosted by Chuck Barris and also—in line with the format of most contemporary talent shows—used a judging panel of three celebrity judges. Resident judges, at various times, on this show were Phyllis Diller, Artie Johnson, Jaye P. Morgan, Rex Reed, and Rip Taylor, who were joined by other celebrity panellists. Amateur performers would walk out on stage and perform their particular act, which might comprise a singing, dancing, comedic or other such performance, or something very odd and unusual. If any of the judges took a dislike to an act, they could strike a gong, at which point the act was over. If the act survived for a minimum time-duration (which varied across series from 20 seconds to 45 seconds) without being gonged, the judges would then each award the performer points between zero and ten. The entertainment value of the show was enhanced by judges signalling to the studio audience (and audience at home) their intentions “to gong” a performance by standing up and raising their mallet as if to strike their gong, but then delaying actually doing so. The act that achieved the highest score at the end of The Gong Show received a cash prize. It is not difficult to see similarities between the judging format of The Gong Show and the buzzing of judges on disliked acts in shows such as America’s/Britain’s Got Talent. The reverse of this can be seen in the contemporary competition show The Voice in which judges signal to the audience in the studio and at home that they are about to hit their button to turn their chair around to see the contestant who is singing, thus preserving the competitor’s future in the show for a little while longer. The Gong Show franchise was trialled in a number of other countries, including Australia, Germany, India, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, but enjoyed only limited runs outside the Far East. One of the longest running talent shows on American television was Star Search, which ran from 1983 to 1995. It was hosted by Ed McMahon, who had been a sidekick of American TV icon, Johnny Carson. It began life being televised in the Earl Carroll Theatre in Hollywood and then later moved to the Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida. It resurfaced briefly in 2003–2004, with Arsenio Hall as host. Acts were\n\n10\n\nChapter One\n\nauditioned from ten categories: Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Junior Vocalist (second half of the season), Teen Vocalist (first half of the season), Junior Dance (first half of the season), Teen Dance (second half of the season), Vocal Group, Comedy, Dance, and Spokesmodel.15 The presence of a model category alongside entertainment performer auditions made for an unusual combination but, in this respect, Star Search was a forerunner, not only of contemporary variety talent shows such as the Got Talent franchise, but also of the Next Top Model franchise. Eight categories took part in each show. Acts had to audition offcamera to gain entry to the show. Two acts competed, per category, in each show. These were differentiated into champion (winner from previous week) and challenger. In the reprise series, which ran over two seasons in 2003–2004, the performance categories were Junior and Adult Singer, Comedy and Modelling in the first season, with Modelling replaced by Dance in the second season. In this format, all acts were assessed by a panel of four judges. Each judge could award an act a score, ranging from one to four (and later five) stars. The act within each category that achieved the highest average score from the judges was declared that week’s winner and competed again the next week. If there was a tie in the judges’ scores, a studio audience vote was used to decide which contender in each category would move forward in the competition. Each performer was required to win a number of shows in a row to earn entry into the next round. This generally comprised three or four wins in succession. As the show evolved, eventually, once three winners had been found for each category, two new performers were found, and the cycle started over again. The winners moved forward to a semi-final round in which acts were assessed by five judges. At this stage, the judges’ scores were not revealed, but the winning acts moved into the final. In the last show, the winners of Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Vocal Group, Comedy and Dance were awarded a first prize, each worth US$100,000. No recording or other performance contracts were awarded as part of the prize in any of these categories, but a number of category champions secured contracts later. This was true in the case of the first two male vocalist champions, Sam Harris and Durell Coleman; female vocalist champion in series three, Linda Eder, and early vocal group winners, Sawyer Brown and Limited Warranty.

These include such luminaries as Beyonce Knowles (female vocalist), Destiny’s Child (vocal group), Alanis Morissette (female vocalist), Rosie O’Donnell (comedy), LeAnne Rimes (junior female vocalist), Ray Romano (comedy), Adam Sandler (comedy), Jessica Simpson (female vocalist), Sharon Stone (model), Jim Tavare (comedy), and Justin Timberlake (male vocalist, who performed as Justin Randall). A number of young contestants used Star Search as experience before moving on as adults to more contemporary talent shows. Several young contenders in the 2003–2004 reprise Star Search shows also appeared within the next year or two as contestants in American Idol and America’s Got Talent, where they generally performed well. David Archuletta, who won Junior Vocalist on Star Search in 2003, subsequently finished as runner-up in American Idol, Season Seven, in 2007. Another junior competitor in the 2003 season of Star Search, Diana DeGarmo, finished as runner-up in American Idol in 2004. Kimberly Caldwell, who performed as a female vocalist in the 2003 season, finished seventh in the second series of American Idol, in 2004. Another young female vocalist in 2004, Bianca Ryan, went on to become the first winner of America’s Got Talent, in 2006.\n\nHistory of Television Talent Shows—Britain Talent shows have been a constant feature of television in Britain since the earliest days of popular broadcasting. It was, however, commercial broadcasting rather than the BBC that championed these shows. The first televised talent show was Carroll Levis Discoveries, which was produced in 1957 by ATV London for the new Independent Television (ITV) channel. Carroll Levis was a Canadian impresario and talent scout. At the time, it became the most-watched programme on television alongside that other stalwart of early television entertainment (and another noncompetitive platform of talent discovery), Sunday Night at the London Palladium. As with many of the shows of this era, initial auditions took place beforehand, and the acts that appeared on the show were judged by studio or theatre audience applause. The Discoveries show found a number of 16 Gordon, William A. (2002) op.cit.\n\n12\n\nChapter One\n\nacts that went on to enjoy successful careers in show business, such as comedian and long-time radio panel show and TV quiz show host, Nicholas Parsons. There is also on record a performance on Sunday 15th February 1959 of three familiar sounding teenage singers/musicians from Liverpool in a group called The Quarrymen—John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison.17 The second major television talent show in Britain was transmitted over a number of seasons, spanning a period of more than 20 years from 1956 to 1978, and was called Opportunity Knocks. The original show began life on BBC Radio in 1949 and then moved to Radio Luxembourg in the 1950s. It was taken up by ITV for a two-month run during the summer of 1956. It then re-appeared in 1964 and was shown every year until 1978. Throughout this long run, it was hosted by Canadian Hughie Green. The show was then brought back to the screen by the BBC in spring 1987, and ran through to the summer of 1990. It was hosted for the first two of these seasons by comedian Bob Monkhouse and then for the final year by another comedian, Les Dawson.18 Opportunity Knocks was known for showcasing, not just standard forms of entertainment such as singers, musicians, dancers, comedians, impressionists, and ventriloquists, but also a range of novelty acts, including acrobats, jugglers, animal acts, and other strange performances. The show’s best-known alumni are not dominated by traditional acts, although it is fair to say that Opportunity Knocks was successful in discovering a number of these, and especially comedians. The last ever presenter of the show, Les Dawson, was a former winner. However, among the best-remembered acts, perhaps, are Pam Ayres, a poet who read amusing, self-penned observations on life in verse, and Tony Holland, the body builder who could twitch his muscles to music. The winning acts each week were decided by the viewing public. In the early ITV version of the show, the public voted by post and the winner was announced at the beginning of the next week’s show. In the later BBC version of the show, a telephone voting system replaced the postal vote. Many of the format features of Opportunity Knocks can be found in contemporary television talent shows such as the Pop Idol, Got Talent and X Factor franchises, and most especially in the use of telephone voting to decide the winners. 17 See: www.whirligigtv.yuku.com/topic/9299/Carroll-Levis-Discoveries#.UWK _7KI3vbM.

Accessed 26th July 2013.\n\nCareer Capital of Reality TV Talent Competitions\n\n13\n\nDuring the 1970s, a competitor emerged for Opportunity Knocks in the form of a show called New Faces. The show had two runs on ITV, first between 1973 and 1978 and then later between 1986 and 1988. In New Faces, the fate of the performers rested entirely in the hands of the judging panel. The panel comprised four judges drawn from the worlds of entertainment, journalism, music, and television, and included Clifford Davis, Noel Edmonds, Alan Freeman, Tony Hatch, Mickie Most, Ted Ray, Ed Stewart, and Muriel Young. Each act received marks out of ten across three aspects of their performance: presentation, content and star quality. This meant that an act could potentially receive a maximum score of 120 points: only one act ever achieved this score, and that was singer, Patti Boulaye, in her winning finale performance. The act with the highest score each week passed through to the next round. The show discovered and provided useful career development platforms for many talented and successful entertainers, the best known of which are Michael Barrymore, Patti Boulaye, Marti Caine, Jim Davidson, Les Dennis, Lenny Henry, Joe Pasquale, and Victoria Wood. Other contestants enjoyed mixed fortunes after the show. The pop group Showaddywaddy, who won in 1973, enjoyed a successful recording and performing career after winning with ten Top Ten singles, and was still touring 40 years later, while pop-soul duo, Sheer Elegance had just two chart-making singles after appearing in 1975 before folding.19 Once again, there are aspects of New Faces that are represented in the contemporary talent shows on television. When he first appeared as a member of the judging panel in American Idol, Simon Cowell attracted a great deal of negative publicity about his tough, uncompromising style of evaluation and the straight-talking way in which he was prepared to tell talentless acts that they were wasting their time. This style not only contrasted sharply with that of his fellow judges, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson, but was also seen as a departure from the American way of always finding positives even when an act has performed poorly. Yet Cowell was not the creator of this style of judging—even though he built a successful and highly lucrative career out of it. New Faces is probably best remembered for the acerbic judging of Tony Hatch and Mickie Most, who were—in talent show judging terms—the Simon Cowells of their day. On one occasion, for instance, Hatch, upon finding an instrumental music act particularly tedious, gave it a score of zero.\n\n19 Roberts, David. (2006) British Hit Singles and Albums, 13th Edition. London, UK: Guinness World Records Limited.\n\n14\n\nChapter One\n\nIn between the early and later runs of New Faces, the ITV network brought another talent show to the screen between 1980 and 1982, called Search for a Star. This show replaced an expert judging panel with a viewers’ panel. The viewers’ panel actually comprised a number of regional panels that represented different ITV regions across the UK. The regional panellists gave votes to each act, with the camera switching to each regional spokesperson to allow the presenter to collect their scores for the acts. The eventual winner was promised a one-off “TV special” networked across the country on ITV, with the winner being top of the bill. The show failed to catch on with the viewers and did not discover any major acts with longevity.20 A more successful television talent show, at least in terms of its popularity with the audience at home, was Stars in Their Eyes. In this show, contestants were given the opportunity to dress up as one of their favourite celebrity singers and impersonate them as closely as possible. Later on, celebrity versions of the show were also televised. Contestants competed in initial heats, with the winner of each heat being invited back to take part in a grand finale from which an outright winner would emerge. Each act would be introduced through a brief film, voxpop, in which they talked about their lives and gave clues about the famous performer they were going to impersonate. The show ran for 16 series between August 1990 and March 2005. Because the contestants were performing as much as a tribute to their favourites singers as to find a platform for their own talents, and given that they were not appearing as themselves anyway, Stars in Their Eyes served more as a piece of stand-alone entertainment than as a format for the discovery and nurturing of new singing talent. Having said that, one of the winners from Series 11 in 2000, Gary Mullen, who appeared as Freddie Mercury, subsequently went on to become one of the UK’s leading Queen tribute acts. A further talent show that appeared before the modern era of televised talent contests was The Big, Big Talent Show. This short-lived series ran from 1996 to 1997 on ITV and failed to become established as a ratings winner. Despite its short shelf life, it did produce a small number of alumni who have enjoyed career success since—most notably comedians Omid Djalili and Ed Byrne, and singer Charlotte Church. The first winner of The X Factor, Steve Brookstein, also appeared on this show. The Big, Big Talent Show is worth mentioning because of its historical precedent of offering to the eventual winner the prize of an appearance at the Royal 20 BBC.

As a talent contest for variety acts, this show can be seen as the precursor of the Got Talent franchise that enjoyed much more success, both in terms of audience popularity and discovery of talent, ten years later.\n\nCareer Legacies of TV Talent Shows Television talent shows have been popular sources of entertainment with audiences at home, and their value to the networks that transmit them is founded upon their ability to draw large audiences and, in turn, on commercial networks, large advertising revenues. For the contestants, though, these shows represent platforms on which they can raise their public profile. This is vitally important to those seeking to develop careers as entertainers and for those seeking entry into the world of business or a profession, because they provide exposure of a more selective kind to potential future employers who can provide contestants with these desired career paths. These two features can work together. The success of a show in television audience terms will determine its longevity. Without the show, the career opportunities that draw in contestants disappear. Without interesting contestants, the television audiences will disappear. This book is concerned with the legacy of television’s talent shows for contestants. To what extent can contestants in these shows expect to develop a successful career in the field for which they have auditioned? Does winning one of these shows bring career success? Can simply being a participant be career enhancing? We will track down what happens to contestants across a range of television talent shows of the twenty-first century in the fields of music and variety entertainment, fashion modelling, professional cookery, and commercial business. It will become apparent that for some participants, and especially for some winners, being in these shows brought lifechanging career opportunities that they might not otherwise have got. For other participants, including some eventual winners, the careers for which they auditioned were either short-lived or never happened. Some found career fulfilment and success, but not in the field for which they auditioned on television. Many returned to their former lives and obscurity. Some contestants nevertheless enjoyed occupational success, albeit out of the limelight. Billy Pearce was a finalist in the 1986 season of New Faces and went on to enjoy a short-lived and well-paid career as a comedian with his own driver to take him to and from venues. As he said in one interview, “Suddenly I’m earning £3,000 to £4,000 a night turning over half a million\n\n16\n\nChapter One\n\na year plus.” A few years later, after bookings dried up, Pearce lost all his money and was reduced to making pantomime appearances.21 The idea that being on a television talent contest is a guaranteed route to fame and fortune is not supported. While this can happen, it applies only to a minority of contestants. This observation is reinforced by the career outcomes of winners and finalists on shows such as Popstars, American Idol and The X Factor, where celebrity status is sought, as well as in other contests such as MasterChef and The Apprentice where noncelebrity career development is being sought. On Popstars: The Rivals in the UK in 2002, the emergent girl band, Girls Aloud and boy band, One True Voice, were technically joint winners of the show but subsequently enjoyed contrasting fortunes in their pop music careers. Girls Aloud went straight to number one in the UK singles charts with their debut record, “Sound of the Underground”, keeping One True Voice at number two with “Sacred Trust/After You’re Gone”. The boys disbanded six months later while the girls went on to enjoy a further ten years of career success as a band and, in some cases, also as solo artistes.22 From American Idol, artists such as Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Adam Lambert have gone on to achieve great success as recording artists and musical performers. Others such as Lee DeWyze, Kris Allen and Ruben Studdard have enjoyed only temporary success or failed to achieve much from the outset, despite having the same exposure in the competition. From The X Factor, Leona Lewis (who won) and One Direction (who came third) have gone on to achieve international stardom and considerable personal wealth in just a few years. In contrast, Steve Brookstein (who won) is back playing in pubs and clubs, as he did before the competition. On the original format of The Apprentice, the winners were awarded a job with a leading entrepreneur. In the American version of the show, this has meant gaining a one-year contract within the business empire of the show’s host, Donald Trump. In the British version of the show, winners were employed by Trump’s equivalent, Alan (Lord) Sugar. In later versions of the UK show, the prize switched from a job with Sugar to an investment of £250,000 in a business proposition of the winning 21 Hudson, Alex.

In the U.S. show, Trump eventually gave up on auditioning unknown contestants amidst rapidly falling TV audiences, and switched to shows that featured well-known celebrities playing to win money for charity. Few winners of The Apprentice lasted beyond that first year in employment with the show’s host and, despite its founding premise, few went on to develop their own businesses. Indeed, few of the top-ten finishers who left the show established new business interests as a direct consequence of the experience. Many of those who did subsequently run their own companies had done so before they entered The Apprentice and went back to these businesses afterwards. As an analysis of this series later in this book will show, there is little conclusive evidence that being on The Apprentice benefited contestants’ business careers through the acquisition of enhanced business acumen. If anything, any benefits from being on the show derived more from the publicity value it bestowed on them, by raising their public profile among viewers at home. A few benefited from the celebrity capital they gained from being on the show, and subsequently established careers in the media as radio and television presenters and reporters. Should we be surprised by all of this? Lessons learned from television talent show history teach us that we should not. If we look back through the early shows on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts, The Gong Show, New Faces, Opportunity Knocks and Star Search, all of which ran for multiple seasons, between them they probably auditioned more than 5,000 contestants of whom fewer than 100 went on to become lasting household names. For others, there was some fleeting fame that was quickly extinguished once the public memory of their appearances on a talent show had faded. Take the following case study. In 1971, 12-year-old singer Neil Reid won Opportunity Knocks. He released a single, “Mother of Mine” which was beaten to the Christmas number one spot in the charts by The New Seekers singing “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing”. Nonetheless, Reid’s record went on to sell 2.5 million copies worldwide and he became the youngest person in British recording history to have a number one album. For the next couple of years he performed at sell-out tours around the UK. Then, from across the Atlantic, along came “little” Jimmy Osmond, the latest in a line of singing siblings, who superseded him as a teenage pop sensation. By 1974, after falling record sales, Reid was dropped by his record company and was reduced from headlining his own concerts to serving as a support act at seaside summer season shows. This is how his career continued into his thirties when he got out of show\n\n18\n\nChapter One\n\nbusiness, moved into the finance sector and developed a successful new career with his own consultancy.23 The lessons of television talent show history, therefore, teach us that getting on a talent show is one thing, but enjoying lasting career success is another. Winning the show can increase the likelihood that success will follow, but this outcome is not guaranteed. Sometimes, those who do not win go on to greater success than do those who come out on top. Furthermore, the career legacy of taking part in a televised talent contest can take participants in directions other than ones they had intended. Those seeking stardom as entertainers might end up in the world of business, while those seeking business or specialised professional careers might end up as media personalities. In the chapters that follow, we will explore the fortunes of those who have taken part in a variety of talent shows across different career categories. Are these shows beneficial to the future lives of their participants? Do contestants get what they deserve—that is, does the outcome of a talent competition reflect the quality and consistency of their performance? To what extent does taking part in a television talent contest amount to little more than a sabbatical from everyday reality, while ultimately having no significant, lasting impact upon that reality?\n\n23 BBC Today.

Accessed 11th July 2013.\n\nCHAPTER TWO FINDING POP STARS\n\nThe modern era of TV talent shows that have focused on discovery of new singers and recording artists, has been led by two major franchises—Pop Idol and X Factor. Later on, a new franchise also emerged called The Voice that offered the twist of initial “blind” auditions with the judges hearing but not seeing the contestants. American Idol has been at the forefront of this genre for well over ten years, but it did not start in the United States. The American phenomenon was based on a British show called Pop Idol, which itself spun off from an earlier format called Popstars that had originated in New Zealand and then was further developed in Australia. After spawning the Idol format, however, Popstars continued in its own right in some markets. The Popstars franchise started in New Zealand in 1999 and in its original format it took the form of a reality television show about the formation of a pop music band. In the first New Zealand series, producer Jonathan Dowling auditioned applicants for a new all-girl band called True Bliss. This band had a short lifespan of around a year, but was re-formed with four of the original five members in 2012. The format was subsequently licensed to Screentime in Australia. It was later sold to Tresor TV in Germany. Eventually the format was sold to more than 50 countries worldwide. Despite the widespread international take-up of the show, in many countries it enjoyed a fairly brief shelf life, and was dropped within a few seasons after television audiences fell away once the novelty had worn off. In virtually every country that took the franchise, it ran for no more than three seasons. The main exception was Germany, where the show ran for nine seasons. Its longevity here was probably helped by the fact that it was rested for the years 2002, 2005 and 2011. The demise of Popstars was undoubtedly also driven by the emergence of other more glamorous and entertaining formats led by the Pop Idol and X Factor franchises, in which viewers at home got to play an important part in the selection of winning contestants.\n\n20\n\nChapter Two\n\nThe initial Australian series produced three winning acts that subsequently enjoyed some success as recording artists. The first season was won by allgirl group called Bardot.1 After winning the show in 2000, they released a single (“Poison”) and an album (“Bardot”) which both got to number one in the charts in Australia and New Zealand and also performed well in parts of Asia. In 2001, they released a further album (“Play It Like That”) from which two spin-off singles got into the top five in the Australian charts. They decided to split up in 2002. By the end of their short career as a group, Bardot had achieved six Top Twenty singles in the Australian charts and completed two successful tours in Australia. Internationally, however, their music made little impact. The individual members of the group all embarked on solo singing careers but enjoyed limited success. Two of the girls (Sophie Monk and Tiffani Wood) released three albums between them, but only one of these made it into the Top Forty. Four of them released singles over the next few years but these mostly finished outside the Top Twenty in the charts.2 The second season of Popstars in Australia was won by boy-girl band, Scandal’us. They released just two singles, the first of which reached number one in the Australian charts and the second crept into the Top Thirty. Their album “Startin’ Somethin’” reached number two in the album charts in their homeland. They also disbanded in 2002. Two of the band’s members (Tamara Jaber and Jason Bird) subsequently enjoyed limited chart success as solo artists.3 The third season of Popstars in Australia, in 2002, was won by solo singer, Scott Cain. He already had a profile in his home country as a member of a band called Funkapation, and also as a solo artist. His single and album recordings after the show, however, provided no evidence that winning Popstars had significantly benefited his career as a recording artist. His first solo single after the show reached number seven in Australia’s pop music charts, but his follow up was only a modest success, eventually just creeping inside the Top Forty. He later went on to establish a successful career as a television presenter and enjoyed further modest success as a recording artist.4 1 Sydney Morning Herald. (2003, 10th May) “The blond one”.

By this time, the Idol franchise had reached Australia with the launch of Australian Idol. The first winner and runner-up in the Idol show, Guy Sebastian and Shannon Nolf, both enjoyed significant success with their respective debut albums and this encouraged the producers of Popstars to resurrect their show.5 Popstars Live was won by Kayne Taylor. An album that featured cover versions of well-known songs by the finalists, together with a spin-off single, failed to make the top echelons of the Australian charts. The show’s winner released a debut single that got into the Top Ten, and runner-up, Miranda Murphy, released a single that made the Top Twenty. Neither of these two artists had any further significant chart success. In contrast, competitors that appeared in Australian Idol enjoyed more success in some cases. The first winner in 2003, Guy Sebastien, is a singer-songwriter who has enjoyed a buoyant career in popular music and was even selected as a judge for the 2011 season of Australia’s version of The X Factor. The winner of Season Two in 2004, Casey Donovan, was just 16 at the time and continued to make records that enjoyed limited chart success and also performed in musical theatre. Of the other winners, Damien Leith (2006), Wes Carr (2008) and Stan Walker (2009), each had several albums of which most charted well in the Australian album charts, while Katie DeAraugo (2005) and Natalie Gauci (2007) had more limited chart success. In considering whether appearing in, and more especially winning, these reality talent contests represents a good career move, up to 2012, Popstars, around the world, produced artists who delivered 42 number one hit singles for the winners, across 12 countries in which the show was televised. As with the show itself, however, for most of the winners or finalists lasting career success as a recording artist tended to be elusive. This pattern was repeated in respect of winners and finalists of many of the subsequent franchises that superseded Popstars around the world. For all those who enjoyed success as recording artists, there were many more who did not.\n\nwww.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=3539916.

As with the New Zealand and Australian formats that preceded it, Popstars in the UK adopted a fly-on-the-wall documentary perspective about the way a modern pop group gets formed. A judging panel of three experts, a television producer (Nigel Lythgoe), a music promoter (Nicki Chapman) and a music mogul (Paul Adam,) auditioned aspiring pop singers, in different parts of the UK, who sang briefly in front of them. Those judged as the best were invited back for further auditions in London. Over a number of weeks, the judges eliminated contestants until they were left with ten finalists. These aspirants were put through their paces with yet more auditions and the judges made their final selections of five contestants, not only on the basis of their abilities as singers, but also in terms of who made the best fit as a group. The first series eventually created a new band that comprised three girls (Myleene Klass, Kym Marsh and Suzanne Shaw) and two boys (Danny Foster and Noel Sullivan) called Hear’say, which enjoyed shortlived success and eventually split up after less than two years. As a band, they nevertheless managed to sell three million records internationally and achieved two number one singles in the UK pop charts.6 The three girls and one of the boys went on to forge successful solo careers in acting, musical theatre and television presenting/modelling, while the other boy struggled to maintain a career in show business. Danny Foster made an ill-fated return to reality talent television by appearing in the second season of the UK version of The Voice, but failed to get any of the judges to take him on at the blind auditions.7 The losing five contestants in the final round of Popstars UK (Michelle Heaton, Tony Lundon, Kevin Simm, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young) formed their own pop group, called Liberty X, which went on to enjoy several years of charttopping success, with ten UK Top Twenty singles. Perhaps the most successful male contestant from the first UK series of Popstars was Darius Danesh (who later reverted his original surname of Campbell) who was eliminated half-way through, but later entered the first Pop Idol competition in 2001 and finished third. He then enjoyed some success as a recording artist, starred in musical theatre in London’s West End and won\n\n6 Malone, Maria. (2001, 1st February) Popstars—The Making of a Band.

This voting aspect was also integrated into the second Popstars series. While judges selected contestants in initial rounds of auditions, the later rounds were televised live and the survival of contestants after each show was determined by television viewers who could vote for their favourites by telephone or using a Red Button on their digital TV remote controls (if they had one). Both the all-boy band and all-girl band had five members. Both bands released records at the end of the series with the aim of becoming the topselling record at Christmas. The girls won the chart competition with their debut single, “Sound of the Underground”, finishing top of the charts and the boys’ double A-sided, debut single, “Sacred Trust/After You’re Gone”, reaching the second spot. Girls Aloud went on to enjoy significant success as recording artists and concert performers for the next ten years, part of the time as solo artists as well as in their band. In contrast, One True Voice released one more Top Twenty single and split up less than two years after they had formed.\n\nPop Idol UK Pop Idol was launched in the United Kingdom in 2001 on the leading commercial channel, ITV. Simon Fuller took credit as the show’s creator and adopted an audience voting system after initial auditions in which a judging panel made the selections. It was this series that saw the debut of Simon Cowell as a judge—a role he subsequently went on to make his 8 Daily Record and Sunday Mail.

Nicki Chapman was retained from the Popstars panel and the two other panel members were Neil Fox (a well-known radio disc jockey) and Pete Waterman (a successful UK record producer). This show sought to find new solo recording artists.10 Pop Idol quickly became extremely popular with the British viewing public. It was one of the most watched shows on ITV—the UK’s leading commercial network—and was extremely profitable for the channel, not only because of the advertising revenue it generated, but also because, once the live shows started, the channel took a share of the revenues from telephone calls made by viewers in lodging their votes each week for their favourite contestants. The format followed a number of rounds that have since become well established across music and entertainment talent shows of this kind. In the first round auditions, contestants sang in front of the judging panel and the four judges had total control over their fate. Those who sang poorly often faced harsh criticism from the judges and especially from Simon Cowell who was, at this time, unknown to the general public. The reactions of the panel became an integral part of the entertainment value of the show. The severity of some of the criticism levelled against the contestants, triggered controversy that was often publicly played out, attracting even more attention to the show.11 After the first round, contestants that survived the cut were auditioned further in London, where the judges produced a longlist of 50 who went forward into the third round. At this point, auditions took place in a television studio. The contestants were split into five groups of ten, and over five pre-recorded shows they each sang one song. The judges offered their opinions about each performance and at the end of the show, and phone lines were opened for viewers at home to vote for their favourite contestant. A results show was then transmitted later on the same evening and the two contestants that obtained the highest number of votes from the television audience moved forward into the final ten. In the second series of the UK Pop Idol, a wild card round was introduced in which the judges selected ten contestants who had previously failed to attract enough audience votes and gave them a second chance. In this case, the contestant who obtained the highest number of audience votes went through to the final round and was joined by a second contender, selected by the judges.

This meant that the final round had 12 contestants instead of 10. In the final stage, a series of live television shows was broadcast where the contestants sang, accompanied either by a live band or recorded backing track. Each week, a specific music theme or genre was featured. The judges provided critiques of each performance but the fate of the contestants was determined by viewers’ votes. A live results show was transmitted later the same evening when the contestant with the fewest votes from viewers at home was eliminated. This process was repeated week after week until three finalists competed for the ultimate prize. Pop Idol UK ran for just two series. Simon Cowell had already joined the inaugural judging panel of its U.S. counterpart, American Idol. Furthermore, after the second UK series, Cowell had begun formulating ideas for his own singing talent show, The X Factor, on which he then appeared as a judge. The first series of Pop Idol UK was won by Will Young, with Gareth Gates finishing second and Darius Danesh (originally from Popstars) in third place. The second series was won by Scottish singer Michelle McManus.\n\nPop Idol UK Legacy The person who benefited the most in legacy terms was Simon Fuller, who first rose to prominence as manager of the Spice Girls,12 and who brought the format across from Australia. He subsequently rolled out the format around the world. The show is now televised in 110 countries. Its U.S. counterpart, American Idol, became the top-rated show on U.S. network television for over seven years. The contestants from these early series, however, met with more mixed career success. Young, Gates and Danesh all enjoyed early recording successes in the UK, with singles that reached the top of the pop music charts. Young has continued to enjoyed great success as a recording artist, writing his own material and regularly going on tour. He released best-selling albums in 2002 (“From Now On”), 2003 (“Friday’s Child”), 2005 (“Keep On”), 2008 (“Let it Go”) and 2011 (“Echoes”). By 2012, he had won two BRIT music industry awards from 12 nominations. He also ventured into acting\n\n12 Bowes, Elena. (1997, 30th June) The Marketing 100: Spice Girls: Simon Fuller.

It was calculated that by then he had amassed a personal wealth of around £13 million.13 Gareth Gates had a run of success with seven singles that achieved top five slots in the UK pop music charts and then, as his recording career waned, he moved into musical theatre. He has had lead roles in the London West End and provincial theatre circuits in several shows. His recording career was relatively successful in that he sold more than three million records, but was short-lived with both his record sales and concert sales resulting in his being dropped by his record label, BMG, only two years after coming second in Series One of Pop Idol UK. His disappearance from the mainstream music scene was underlined by a television documentary about him titled “Whatever Happened to Gareth Gates?”14 He released a third album in 2007 from which two Top Thirty singles were spun off. The album was his least successful to date, however, and remained in the albums charts for only two weeks. In 2009, he was given an opportunity to switch the direction of his career when he was offered the lead role in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on London’s West End stage.15 After four months as Joseph, he joined the touring cast of Les Miserables and after 15 months on the road joined the cast of the West End production for a further eight months. He later appeared in the touring cast of the musical, Legally Blond. He has continued to tour as a solo artist and make appearances in provincial and regional variety theatre shows and musical festivals.16 Darius Danesh, who later changed his name to Darius Campbell, had a shorter-lived recording career, but also switched to musical theatre and won leading roles in Chicago, Gone with the Wind and Guys and Dolls. After finishing third in Pop Idol, Campbell declined an offer to record for Simon Cowell and, instead, signed a five-album deal with another music producer (Steve Lillywhite). His first single topped the charts and his first album was also a best-seller. He wrote all the songs on the album. He 13 The Mirror.

His next high profile appearance was as a contestant in the new series, Popstar to Operastar in which eight singers from other genres were trained to sing opera. Campbell won. He has continued to work in musical theatre with regular West End appearances.18 Other Series One finalists, Zoe Birkett, Jessica Garlick, and Rosie Ribbons also had some limited chart success and moved into musical theatre. Birkett was only 16 when she finished fourth in the show—the highest-placed female contestant. She signed a record deal and released one single, and then her recording career stalled. Since then, she has made a living in musical theatre and pantomime appearances.19 Garlick was selected as the UK entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2002 and finished joint third—a highly creditable performance. Afterwards, her music career floundered and she took a break from it to start a family.20 Ribbons signed to a record deal reportedly worth well over a million pounds after finishing sixth.21 She released two singles that enjoyed minor chart success and no albums. She migrated to Australia for a time, where she entered Australian Idol and reached the semi-final stage.22 She later returned to the UK to try to revitalise her recording career and has supported other artists on their albums.23 17 McNulty, Bernadette.

The winner, Michelle McManus, enjoyed initial chart success with her debut single “All This Time” which achieved number one spot, and her debut album (“The Meaning of Love”), which went to number three. Her second single release struggled, however, and her association with Simon Fuller’s management agency came to an end in 2005. Since then she has established a career that mixes radio and television presenting and some live performances, with newspaper journalism in Scotland. She has continued to work with music as well, but without a major recording deal. 24\n\nAmerican Idol American Idol was launched in June 2002 as a franchise extension of an earlier British talent contest called Pop Idol. While Pop Idol floundered, American Idol went on to become one of the most watched television shows in the United States. It was rated as the number one television show in America for seven years in succession from 2004. Simon Cowell emerged as one of the biggest celebrities on American television. His willingness to talk straight to contestants and not pull any punches if he thought they lacked talent or had performed poorly was a fresh departure for American viewers and the contestants, but they eventually accepted and even warmed to his critical style. Indeed, it was Simon the contestants usually wanted most to impress out of the initial three judges. The purpose of the Idol franchise has been to find new solo recording artists. A panel of expert judges plays a part in the initial selection of contestants before their fate is determined by viewers’ votes. At this later stage, the judges continue to critique the performances in live television shows. The U.S. show adopted a panel of three judges rather than four as in the UK. It was originally planned to have a fourth judge but in both Series One and Two the proposed judges withdrew before the season began. The three judges were Cowell, plus musician and producer, Randy Jackson and pop star and dancer, Paula Abdul. By Season Eight a fourth judge—Kara DioGuardi—joined the panel. In Season Nine Paula Abdul failed to agree personal terms with the show’s producers and was replaced by comedienne and chat show host, Ellen Degeneres. She left after one series. Then Cowell announced he was 24 See: www.edfringe.com/whats-on/musicals-and-operas/michelle-mcmanus-themusicals; www.bbc.co/uk/music/artists/6eca5ff6-2a70-4632-aea7-b3ccc8d07509.

The last panel line-up comprised Jackson plus Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj. In 2013, Jackson departed the show along with Carey and Minaj. The show’s format follows much the same structure as Pop Idol UK. After initial stages of auditions, during which the show’s producers and then its judging panel choose the contestants that will go on to later stages in the competition at the live TV shows stages, the television audience is invited to vote for their favourites and viewers alone determine the fate of the acts. In the first round of selections by the judging panel, contestants seek to obtain a gold ticket that means they have been chosen to go to Hollywood for a further series of auditions. For the first nine seasons there were three elimination rounds held in Hollywood in which the contestants performed as individuals, then in small groups of their own choosing and then a further solo performance round. Eliminations occurred at the end of each of these rounds. In the seventh season the group round was dropped and some contestants were put through to the final Hollywood round after their first solo performance. Others had to perform a second solo performance before the final Hollywood round. From Season Ten, a new round was added, which was held in Las Vegas, and which included group and solo performances. During a semi-final stage, between 24 and 36 contestants were selected across different seasons to appear in further televised rounds following which viewers were allowed to vote. These shows have taken place in a small studio theatre with other contestants and contestants’ families and friends looking on. Viewers’ votes determine whether each contestant will proceed to the final stage. Ultimately, 12 finalists have usually been chosen for the finals that are broadcast from CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The finals stage grew from eight weeks in Season One to 12 weeks by Season Ten. Each week, contestants performed a solo piece and the one who attracted the least viewers’ votes was eliminated. Each week was usually defined by music from a specific genre or theme, or by a specific artist or songwriter. The winner of the show has been given a recording deal with a major label and contracted to Simon Fuller’s agency, 19 Management. Other finalists have obtained recording contracts as well as the eventual winner. While the winners can usually expect to earn a considerable sum in the 25 Elber, Lynn.

Contestants eliminated before the grand finale have done well after appearing on American Idol. Equally, many have not attained lasting fame and fortune. During the later stages of the competition, the judges provide critiques of the performances of contestants but have little or no control over the eventual winners and losers, with that decision being handed over to the viewers at home.\n\nAmerican Idol Legacy The series has spawned a number of successful recording artists as well as contestants who have gone on to forge careers in the media and show business even though not necessarily as chart-topping singers. Acts that have released chart-topping albums have included Clay Aiken, Kelly Clarkson, Chris Daughtry, Fantasia Barrino, Jennifer Hudson, Adam Lambert, Kellie Pickler, Jordin Sparks, Ruben Studdard and Carrie Underwood. It is not always the ultimate winners who have enjoyed the greatest recording success later on. Clay Aiken, David Archuletta and Adam Lambert came second, Daughtry finished fourth, Kellie Pickler came sixth and Jennifer Hudson was eliminated in seventh position. Within the next two years, however, Hudson went on to win a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her part in the biopic Dream Girls in 2005. This success, understandably, gave a boost to her recording career. In the first season of American Idol, the eventual winner, Kelly Clarkson, did not initially stand out as a contender, but in the final rounds she turned in a number of exceptional performances. Subsequently, Clarkson has become established in the pop music mainstream and has been the show’s second most successful recording artist in terms of worldwide sales, after the season four winner, Carrie Underwood. By 2012, Clarkson had sold 11.7 million albums and had achieved 24.1 million downloads of her singles.26 Clarkson has the accolade of singing the best-selling single release of all time from an American Idol artist with “Stronger”.27 In the second season, a two-horse race emerged between Ruben Studdard (the eventual winner) and Clay Aiken. The finish was very close, with Studdard getting around 134,000 more votes than Aiken out of 24 26 Bronson, F.

The show’s producers later announced that Aiken had been the front-runner for most of the finals in terms of the viewer vote. Both Aiken and Studdard subsequently enjoyed some success as recording artists, with Aiken later switching over to musical theatre. In 2010, they even toured together in a series of concerts around the U.S.28 By 2012, Aiken had outperformed Studdard, with nearly five million album sales, placing him fourth in the Idol albums sales chart, compared to the latter’s 2.6 million sales, which placed him sixth in the same chart.29 Kimberley Locke finished third in the second season. She signed an initial record deal with Curb Records after the show and released two albums over the next four years that enjoyed modest chart success (finishing 16th and 160th respectively in the US Billboard Charts), together with several spin-off singles that also managed low chart placements.30 A Christmas album, released in 2007, failed to reach the charts. After six years, she parted from her record company and signed a new record deal with Randy Jackson’s label, Dream Merchant 21. This agreement was restricted to singles releases only and one record was produced. A year later, she was releasing records independently. Josh Gracin came fourth in Season Two and made it to 15th place in the Idol albums chart, with 800,000 sales from three albums. Most of these sales (over 700,000) came from his first album.31 The third season was dominated by female singers, and three in particular stood out— Fantasia Barrino (who won), LaToya London (4th) and Jennifer Hudson (7th). Despite their talent, a shock result occurred in finals week seven when they occupied the bottom three places in the viewer vote, with Hudson controversially eliminated. As noted earlier, she eventually went on to win a Hollywood Oscar and a Grammy.\n\n28 See: examiner.com.

As a recording artist she was the fifth most successful that Idol had produced, with over 2.9 million sales from her first three albums.32 The second most successful recording artist from this season was Jennifer Hudson, with over 1.3 million sales placing her 10th in the Idol Top Twenty of 2012.33 DeGarmo came 29th in the Idol albums chart, with 168,000 album sales from a single album release and LaToya London entered at number 39, with just 58,000 sales from one album.34 One of the most “successful” unsuccessful contestants from this season was William Hung who was eliminated at the initial auditions stage. His unique version of “She Bangs” by Ricky Martin caught the audience’s imagination, was replayed during the series, resulted in his being brought back for a special appearance in the Grande Finale, and won him a record deal. Hung finished above both Diane DeGarmo and LaToya London in the Idol albums chart with nearly quarter of a million sales.35 In Season Four, the upper age limit was pushed back to 28 years. The finale was contended by Carrie Underwood and Bo Bice. Underwood came out on top and subsequently forged a highly successful recording and performing career. She has become American Idol’s highest selling recording artist with 13.2 million album sales by July 2012 and 22.5 million digital downloads of her singles.36 Bice’s recording career did not reach the heights of Underwood’s, but he did feature in the Idol Top Twenty in terms of album sales in 2012, with sales of around 750,000.37 Season Five was a highly successful series in terms of television ratings.

His debut album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. McCreery came 7th in the Idol all-time album chart in 2012. His debut album and follow-up Christmas album together achieved sales of over 1.5 million.54 Runner-up www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090521/-ENTERTAIN-90521001.

She entered the Idol all-time albums sale chart at number 24 with her debut album selling over 300,000 copies.55 In Season Eleven, the judging panel remained unchanged, although this was to be the last appearances by Jennifer Lopez (though she re-joined the show in 2014) and Steven Tyler. The competition was won by Phillip Phillips against teenager Jessica Sanchez. Phillips released his debut album in 2012 and it won a Gold award and sold over 800,000 copies. This placed him 14th in the Idol all-time albums sales chart.56 Sanchez has not yet registered in the album charts, although she did land a record deal after Idol finished.57\n\nTalent Contests as a Trigger to a Successful Career in Music Trying to determine whether the performance of contestants in the show was linked to their success after they left it is not easy for these talent contests. Although the producers know which contestants got the most votes, this data is not usually released. The numbers of votes cast for specific contestants, however, can be a misleading metric because it does not represent the number of people who voted, but could instead be influenced by the extent to which a contestant obtained repeat or “redial” votes from the same supporters. Across these singing talent shows, it has not been unknown for orchestrated campaigns to be run by supporters of specific contestants and, in some cases, the outcome is that lesser competitors get further in the show than they deserve on the basis of either their talent or their performances. Clearly, we do know how far in the competition different contestants reach because it is public knowledge which contestant is eliminated during each round or after each live show, in the final stages.

Sometimes there are contestants who are spotted from the early stages as potential stars who go on to deliver. On other occasions, early frontrunners fade, particularly when confronted with music genres that do not suit their vocal range of style. There are others who come through only in the later stages—and sometimes these contestants go on to win. American Idol has created some hugely successful recording artists. The stand-out performers are Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry, and Carrie Underwood, in terms of record sales and music awards. Underwood is probably rightfully judged as the most successful artist to emerge yet from this franchise. By 2012, she had won 15 Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards and five Grammy Awards. Clarkson is comfortably in second place with 12 Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards and two Grammy Awards. Daughtry has six Billboard Music Awards and four American Music Awards to his credit. Jennifer Hudson has a single Grammy Award but also one Academy Award.\n\nThe Winners The first winner of American Idol in 2002 was Kelly Clarkson. Over the next 10 years she released five studio albums, one compilation album, three EPs, 25 singles, two video albums and 24 music videos. Her five studio albums were released in 2003 (“Thankful”), 2004 (“Breakaway”), 2007 (“My December”), 2009 (“All I Ever Wanted”) and 2011 (“Stronger”). All five albums have charted strongly in the US album charts, peaking at numbers 1, 3, 2, 1, and 2 respectively. The first album achieved nearly 2.8 million sales in the USA, the second album was her most successful yet, with 6.3 million sales, while album number three achieved over 800,000 sales; album four managed nearly one million sales and album five exceeded one million sales. All Clarkson’s albums after “Breakaway” have also charted highly in other prominent markets, such as the United Kingdom (3rd, 2nd, 3rd and 5th). Twelve of her singles have achieved Top Ten chart positions in the US single charts and 24 in the Billboard Top 100. She has headlined in nine major tours. By 2012, her recordings had achieved 14 Gold awards (500,000 units sold), 10 Platinum awards (1m units sold), and three multiPlatinum awards (2m+ units sold). She has won one Country Music Association Award, four American Music Awards, and 13 Billboard\n\n38\n\nChapter Two\n\nMusic Awards. She has become established as a major recording artist and performer on the international stage. Season Two was won by Ruben Studdard. Up to 2012 Studdard had released five studio albums and one compilation album. The studio albums were released in 2003 (“Soulful”); 2004 (“I Need An Angel”); 2006 (“The Return”); 2009 (“Love Is”) and 2012 (“Letters from Birmingham”). His early albums enjoyed great success, but the later ones sold less well, although all made the Top Twenty in the US Rhythm and Blues charts. In the US Billboard album charts, his records reached numbers 1, 20, 8, 36 and 73, respectively. Sales figures slumped progressively and significantly across these outputs. Studdard’s first album, titled “Soulful”, turned Platinum, with U.S. sales that reached 1.8 million units. His second album, “I Need an Angel”, turned Gold with nearly half a million in sales. His third album performed only half as well as his second in terms of sales, while the fourth and fifth albums achieved poor sales. His compilation album “Playlist: The Very Best of Ruben Studdard” was released in 2012 and sold the least of all his albums.58 Studdard also released 11 singles, w"
