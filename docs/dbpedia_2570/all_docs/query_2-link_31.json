        "text": "Katherine Jenkins has announced she will release a new classical album called ‘Home Sweet Home’ to mark ten years since her debut LP.\n\nIt has been a decade since the release of her debut offering ‘Premiere’ in 2004 – one of the fastest selling classical albums of all time.\n\nOn her new LP, Katherine, 34, said: “Making this album has been an absolute dream. I am so thankful to be in a place where creativity is encouraged, classical music is understood & where I’ve been allowed to return to where my heart lies musically.\n\n“This record is me at my most natural, my most authentic and I can’t wait to share it with my very valued fans.”\n\nHer new record covers a broad landscape of the world’s most popular classical composers – Bach, Beethoven, Elgar and Holst – alongside the 21st century’s most streamed composer, Ludovico Einaudi, with a pioneering vocal transcription of his global hit ‘I Giorni’.\n\nThis weekend she will be premiering some of the new tracks from the album at Edinburgh Castle (July 19) and Westonbirt, Gloucestershire (July 20)."
