You have been a selfless constant in our lives, knowing just what to say in our darkest hours.\n\n“You inspired us with your dignity, your duty and your grace. I am proud to have lived during your reign, honoured to have sung for you and privileged to have known you. Rest in peace and rise in glory ma'am.”\n\nThe lyrics to ‘God Save the King’ are:\n\n‘God save our gracious King!\n\nLong live our noble King!\n\nGod save the King!\n\nSend him victorious,\n\nHappy and glorious,\n\nLong to reign over us:\n\nGod save the King!\n\nThy choicest gifts in store,\n\nOn him be pleased to pour;\n\nLong may he reign:\n\nMay he defend our laws,\n\nAnd ever give us cause,\n\nWith heart and voice to sing,\n\nGod save the King!’"
