        "text": "Blink-182 is an American pop punk rock band from San Diego, California in 1992. The group has consisted of Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, Travis Barker and Scott Raynor. The group has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nBlink-182 came to prominence in the early 90s punk scene in California where their energetic shows made them a hit with crowds. The group was signed to independent label Cargo Records where they released their debut album “Cheshire Cat”. While the album was not commercially successful, it picked up a lot of buzz and is considered an iconic pop punk album of the time.\n\nThe buzz generated by this first album caused a bidding war between multiple mainstream labels and the band eventually signed with MCA. Drummer Scott Raynor’s disagreement with this decision contributed to his drifting from the band and he was eventually fired in 1998 and replaced by Travis Barker.\n\nWith the new record label and new line up settled, Blink-182 released “Enema of the State” in 1999 and quickly rose to fame with singles “Adam’s Song”, “All the Small Things” and “What’s My Age Again?” all receiving regular airtime on MTV. The album was the band’s most successful release to date and went to number 9 on the US Billboard chart.\n\nThe stress of constant touring and promotion as well as differences about where the band should go with their next album boiled to a head and caused the band to go on an indefinite hiatus in 2005. After Travis Barker was involved in a serious plane crash, the group reunited in 2008 and went on to start work on their sixth studio album, “Neighborhoods”, which was released in 2011 and charted at number 2 in the US.\n\nBlink-182 has cited The Ramones, The Cure and The Vandals, amongst others, as influences for their music, but the reality is that Blink-182 are massive influencers and inspirations for musicians all around the world. The band inspired the second wave of pop punk music in the new millennium and also single-handedly bought this music into the mainstream. For this reason, their music will certainly live on for generations.\n\nRead more\n\nWell let me start off by saying that this was my first rock concert that I have ever been too. It was amazing, the sound was amazing and they were amazing. I've always liked Blink-182 because they were kind of more on the \"nice\" side of rock. Not like heavy metal. When they performed in Phoenix, the opening acts were A Day To Remember and All Time low. I am not sure if that is the same for everyone. If you don't like heavy metal than I would suggest skipping the All Time Low act. Also, don't be in a rush to go to there concert because I got there at 6:00, the doors opened at 7:30. They started playing around 9:30. So its okay if you were a little late.\n\nPARENTS\n\nSexual jokes;\n\nThey do make jokes about sex... A lot of jokes about sex and some of them are worse than others. But the only people who made jokes were the opening acts.\n\nProfanity;\n\nThere is DEFINITELY a lot of cursing. But what do you expect? It's a Blink-182 concert.\n\nViolence;\n\nWhen I went there we sat pretty close to the stage. The pit is a little crazy but nothing to bad. There will be a lot of drugs, smoking, and alcohol there. I sat behind a guy that was totally drunk and there are people smoking EVERYWHERE.\n\nIf your child is 9 or younger, Please leave them home, it's just not safe. And if it means that you can't go to the concert, than just stay home. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nIf your child is 10-14, I think they should go with a parent/guardian.\n\nIf your child is 15-16 I would say, make sure they have some adult supervision available to them if they ever got in an emergency.\n\nIf your child is 17+, I think they will be fine depending on how mature they are.\n\nVIP;\n\nIt's not worth it. You go to a five minuet sound check and for the meet and greet, you don't even do anything. It's just not worth spending your money.\n\nEven though the VIP is a rip off, I would still, highly suggest you go to there concert, it was phenomenal.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nWAIT FOR IT !!!........... LIL WAYNE cancelled just hours before the show (rolling my eyes) so needless to say happy we showed up at 9pm because instead of lil wayne the fans were entertained by music mashups of rock and rap (crappy mix ups by the way) and music by the backstreet boys or n sync not sure which boy band it was but i was super annoyed when i heard the near sold out crowd singing along of \"i want it that way\" really crappy song but all these idiots were singing along like it was 6th grade but on to the positive blink 182 put on a great set for a whole 60 minutes yep 1 hour started at 9:30 was done by 10:30 great set pyro,smoke,cool video stage set up NO TOM DELONGE some new guy not his fault he played great but it wasnt teb same he didnt really sound like TOM so it was like blink 182 karaoke for some of the songs and the short set time I mean shit lil wayne doesnt show these guys could have saved the day and played longer but in typical rock star fashion they charged full price for tickets delivered half of a show and a short set disapointed much ? YEAH I WAS hate to say it but I mean it wasnt a 20 dollar ticket here tickets were not cheap but the amount of entertainment vs the amount paid for the ticket was not EQUAL felt pretty ripped off as a whole save your money this go round NOT WORTH THE CASH plus we drove 4 hours to go to this show so a few hundred dollars later we got and hour of a headliner entertainment hell KISS are 70 years old and played for 2 and a half hours the tickets were pricey but hell they were showmen and lots of fire,pyro,smoke,fireworks,ect stunts elevating risers ect so you tell me if its worth it to go see 40 year old entitled punks vs 70 year old vets who are doing a cash grab no doubt but are still delivering an experirience\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nBlink 182 has been my favorite band as a kid back in ‘96 when I first heard of them and will always be. I finally got to see them live for the first tine ever in 2016, 20 years later because they came close to my hometown in Greenville, SC. Then about 3 months later to my actual hometown in Charleston, SC. I was close to the middle up front and had the time of my life. I thank the whole band for making one person’s dream come true just to see you live. I’ve always wanted to meet Mark and Travis!! I was so like it’s cool when Mark tried to throw me a pick but it landed short and he apologized and he Ent on with the show. But my heart filled up with joy when, in my opinion, the greatest drummer in the whole universe, Travis Barker!!!!, acknowledged me when I gave him a thumbs up. Wish I could meet and talk to then!! A dream for a lifetime. Blink 182 you will always be number 1 to me and hold a special place in my heart as you do to millions of fans!! Love you all and can’t wait for the bext album!! Including Mark’s new band aka The Side Piece. Mark if you ever read this’ please don’t take offense to the comment. Blink 4 Life!! Peace...\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThink early 2000s fashion, baggy jeans, chains, and terrible hair, ‘say it ain’t so, I will not go, turn the lights off, carry me home’. This song takes me right back to my young teenage self, jumping round my bedroom with a hairbrush as a microphone. Back in 2012 when I got asked if I would like to go and see Blink-182 live, I thought, sure!\n\nAlthough my enthusiasm for them had somewhat dwindled over the last decade, it’s always fun to have a bit of a throwback and that’s exactly what I was hoping for when I went to their London O2 Arena concert. Even from the upper tier of the arena, the sound quality was amazing and as they game out on stage they began playing ‘Feeling This’ over the tumultuous sound of a cheering arena crowd.\n\nThe atmosphere was fuelled by the incredible set of the album cover and laser lights dancing across the stage and out towards the audience. As the show progressed, they began singing more and more classic, culminating in ‘All the Small Things’, which is what everyone was desperate to hear.\n\nThey really did put on a fantastic show, great vocals, performance, and energy, I’m so glad I went.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThere's not much to say about a Blink-182 live show apart from the fact it must be seen to be believed. Having been pioneers of the pop/punk revival of the 90's, Blink have a huge string of cult hits and a fan base of all ages who continue to fill out their shows with no sign of slowing down.\n\nThe cheers are raised as the band confidently take to stage, running around, laughing, joking from the offset as if they were about to start a garage jam session rather than entertain thousands. This air of carelessness carries on as Blink are not a band who take themselves seriously during performance, during mass singalongs to 'What's My Age Again' they are often jovially moving around stage and baiting the crowds below.\n\nThe act does get a little relentless as it can feel as if the band hasn't really grown up since its formation. Although there are moments of sincerity in the form of 'I Miss You' and a well performed cover of 'Hybrid Moments' by Misfits. 'All The Small Things' obviously receives the best reaction, and the performance of this cult anthem is incredibly fun.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nTook my 2 songs (20 & 16). Wanted to see both Frank Turner - who I've seen loads - and Blink\n\nManaged to get access to O2 Priority & use their cloakrooms & loos before going into the Arena.\n\nFrank T & The Sleeping Souls as always nailed it.
