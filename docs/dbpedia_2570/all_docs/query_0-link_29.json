        "text": "Since the turn of the millennium, the Ashgate Popular and Folk Music Series has provided a number of important studies on popular music. Klein’s contribution on pre-existing popular music in advertising is one of the most recent, and it examines a field of research on the periphery of traditional musicology. Thus, the subject of the book is important and the scope is wide-ranging. In addition to musicologists, media and communication researchers ought to be able to find something of interest as well. Inspired by the following observation, “in marketing, and particularly in television commercials, popular music has become ubiquitous” (Klein, 2009, p. 1), Klein sets out to explain and discuss why pre-existing popular music in advertising has become ubiquitous and what the consequences are for music, the music industry, and for marketing. Empirically, the examination is based on 29 in-depth interviews with respondents who all occupy positions with direct influence on the business of so...\n\nThis thesis focuses on the question on how music placement and sonic branding have been influenced. by the leading schools of consumer marketing from the second half of the twentieth century until the present day. It provides a historical overview and musical analysis of four Coca-Cola television commercials from holiday campaigns from four distinct decades in marketing history. The leading theories of consumer marketing started to shift since the fifties from a company-oriented perspective towards a consumer-oriented perspective. This led to the rise of multisensory marketing, where the experiential factor of consumers became key for company branding. This development, which is still ongoing, has also had a significant impact on the use, composition, and arrangement of sound in advertisement. This research uses case and literature study to compare the developments and use of sound in television commercials with the historical developments of marketing theory. Furthermore, this study also focuses on musical variables like key, tempo, progression, and instrumentation in order to analyze a theoretical ‘ideal’ combination for the most effective sound in advertisements and branding. This will be done through literature study and secondary research, which combines the field of marketing and psychology with the field of musicology. Parameters such as a low arousal, a high level of familiarity and a high perceived pleasure are noted as the most important factors to organize sound in the most effective way for television commercials. (Dubé, Chebat, and Morin 1995, 305-320) The four Coca-Cola holiday commercials are analyzed regarding these parameters and are compared with the leading marketing theory of their relevant decades. The noticeable developments regarding music placement and sonic branding are described to identify a significant influence.\n\nAbstract: Nicole Lizee is an award-winning classical music composer/performer who composes for string quartet, electronic music, turntable, film and other media. She has emerged as a major new voice in new classical composition winning the coveted Canada Council for the Arts Jules Léger Prize (2013) for new Canadian chamber music with her work White Label Experiment, and commissioned by the Kronos Quartet among many other prestigious ensembles. This article seeks to investigate her relation to various aspects of her work- from marketing and promotion to inspiration and creation in the context of “avant garde” work. How can marketing continue to be part of the art itself? Does instinctively not fitting into a box allow for greater freedom to explore classical and chamber music in the broader context of film and other media. What other factors may be contributing to the inspired vitality of her work? Approached through an in-depth interview by Howard Wiseman, York University film/screenwriting professor and former member of the band “Lighthouse,” following Lizee’s recent performance of “Hitchcock Etudes” with the “Music In the Barns Chamber Ensemble” at Toronto’s Artscape Wychwood Barns. This article followed a live interview conducted on stage .\n\nThis article describes a study involving 557 participants that investigated effects of respondents’ sociodemographic background on their rating of appeal and congruency of music in television commercials, with a focus on classical music. Though research indicates that there are connections between listeners’ musical preferences and their social backgrounds, and targeted advertising is premised on the notion that consumers can be divided and marketed to by sociodemographic categories, the results of the study suggest that sociodemographic background may not play a central role when it comes to the processing of music and images together in commercials, whether classical or other. In its use of SurveyMonkey’s Audience service to assemble participants, the study is exploratory in nature, suggesting a po- tential new resource for research on audiovisual media.\n\nDespite Mervyn Cooke’s assertion that the use of Bach’s music in film is, among classical composers, “perhaps the most susceptible to contrasting interpretations,” I argue in this article that in the case of recent television commercials, Bach has more or less taken on a single function: reassurance. It is no coincidence that most companies that use Bach in their commercials offer financial or insurance services (including American Express, MetLife, and Allstate), thus requiring a message of trust. But even commercials for non-finance products, like Wix.com, Healthy Choice Café Steamers, and Papa Murphy’s Pizza, have used Bach as the sound of reassurance. Furthermore, it is a particular subset of works that continually reappears in such contexts, particularly the Prelude from the Violoncello Suite No. 1 in G Major BWV 1007 and the Prelude in C Major from the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I. Drawing on Bach scholarship, screen music scholarship, my own empirical studies on the reception of classical music in television commercials, and interviews with advertising creative directors, I demonstrate how and why Bach’s music has in commercials come to represent the sound of “good hands” (to invoke Allstate Insurance’s motto). In the process, I reveal that what might seem on the surface to be an obvious association is actually the result of negotiations among aesthetic, semiotic, and socio-demographic factors, and especially the evolution of television advertising in recent decades."
